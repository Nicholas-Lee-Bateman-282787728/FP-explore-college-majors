Besides being a Robin Williams fan, this movie was great even if he wasn't in it.  The visual  effects are incredible(it was nominated for two Oscars for them) and the  picture it creates of the afterlife is one I have never imagined.  I  especially like the explanation of what happens to suicides, which if  you're further interested in that or any other ""theory"" in this  movie you can read MUCH more in detail in the book version by Robert  Matheson.  The movie is much different from the book, but also much better.  The plot includes a lot about before he and she goes to heaven and hell.  Personally, this movie has one of the greatest beginnings and endings I  have ever seen.",918777600,,810,4.503448275862069

1032282,5,6305297525,"One of the most imaginative films you'll ever watch. It reminds me of the Wizard of Oz, Tron, or The Neverending Story. Extremely bold. Is this what happens when you die? Who the hell knows (no pun intended), however it is a touching story that frames the most important moments in our lives in a storybook that is the human experience. Love, loss, pain, devotion, and transcendence.  Not recommended for cynics, hardcore religious fundamentalists, but to people with an open mind.

Also recommended: Ghost, Contact, Always, Resurrection (with Ellen Burstyn)",1514419200,2,558,5.188888888888889

1032361,5,6305297525,"Robin Williams excels in this film. A brief synopsis Robin is a physician who has a wonderful life until his children die in a car accident. His wife whom he loves very much is unable to handle their death and ultimately commits suicide. Robin eventually dies and is transported to heaven , he encounters many people he met in his life including his dead son. His one hope is to see his wife again but is told that since she killed herself she is in a special place where she can never leave.  Still determined to see her, his guide takes him there, where he travels through limbo (children people floating), purgatory (multitude of faces in darkness voicing their sins) and to hell itself ! He encounters his lost wife who is living in their earthly house which is decrepit and dark, she perseverates on her circumstances and will not leave but he convinces her to do so. What makes this movie special is not the special effects which are great but the inclusion of eclectic religious dogma. The ending is wonderful , which focuses on the love we should have for each other and the love that God has for us.",1507852800,,1108,4.485148514851486

It tried way too hard, and in doing so, fell flat on its face.

Heaven will be living with Him in joy, love, and bliss we can't even fathom - the Bible says, it has not entered the mind of man, what God has for us. Hell does not exist now and it not eternal, those scenes in this movie were tragic and horrible. The only reason someone will not be in heaven is because they chose not to, sadly those that do choose not to follow the Lord will pay the debt of their sin and cease to exist.

I love all the hidden truths in this film, we all ascend and descend depending on our energies and choices. It's sad, being reminded about oblivion.  Energy really doesn't escape that dimension, however, this fairy tale movie made it seem less laughable, yeah right, someone  goes to hell and returns with another person. nope!  Doesn't ever happen.
It's a gorgeous film.  I love watching robin williams in anything, I miss him, beat he went to Heaven.  I wonder if he'll come back as a comedian, or a Dr, or a rock star, he sure had a bright light to him. Oh wait, he committed suicide, that's that I guess.",1494806400,,730,4.451127819548872

The big question is, would you sacrifice yourself for your spouse/ significant other the way he did?

1033426,5,6305297525,"Awe-inspiring.  Behold what Robin Williams at his finest, a sterling support cast led by the heart-breaking Annabella Sciorra, and a palette of mind-bending special effects can do.  Visions of a wet-paint heaven and an insidious hell I will never forget--Dante's Inferno wasn't this vivid.  I first saw this film in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, and wondered what the Spanish-speaking audience made of it.  As for me, I've watched it a number of times since, and even though at points it's pretty grueling, in the end it's a piece of cinematic redemption.  It's film victories like this that justify the whole writhing, whining, clichd mess that Hollywood has become--could there still be hope for the human race via the old ""silver screen?""",1464652800,,736,5.1
1033427,4,6305297525,"This movie has the evocative power of a lucid dream.  If you have ever dreamed of a loved one who has died, then I think this movie will speak to you.  If you believe in heaven and hell, I think you will have a helluva heavenly ride. Robin Williams tones down his comic delivery and his dramatic chops are at the top of his game. This movie is my favorite, among his many excellent serious turns. The art direction is stunning. The entire cast, including Cuba Gooding, Jr., and Max Von Sydow take the abstract premise with the confident commitment of real artists.",1464134400,9,564,4.466019417475728

1033534,4,6305297525,"4**** for graphic art, for the performances, but not for the script.  (Someone else here called it ""an interesting experiment"") and I agree.  This movie ""idea"" was a good one but it did little to clarify a ""consciousness"" after-death.  And,, we forget that ""soul-mate"" does not exist.  It is an idea and an ideal that exist in our culture as a principle to practice: it means that one has found a person that they like a whole lot and find them highly tolerable and those feelings appear to be real and permanent.  Okay: so now you can see how I looked at the movie and analyzed what I saw.  The subject grabbed me mentally so it ceased to be entertainment and I watched it to see how they ''treated'' the subject of ""life"" after death.

I love Robin Williams' talent.  And I will look at a few more performances of his work before I leave his front-porch-(page) here on Amazon.

1034039,5,6305297525,"One of my favorite Robin Williams movies. Robin is very serious in this movie and plays his character so well. The movie has several Christian themes including suicide, purgatory, Heaven, hell and the ""answer"" to ""do animals go to Heaven?"" Robin Williams made this movie after he switched his religious affiliation with Catholicism to Episcopal. One of the reasons Robin Williams gave for leaving the Catholic Church was that being an Episcopalian was twice as much fun and had half the guilt. The movie does cover Catholicism's belief that people who commit suicide cannot go to Heaven, and in this film Robin Williams, after he dies and goes to Heaven, chooses to leave Heaven and join his wife (a suicide victim) in purgatory.
It is a love story but with some unexpected twists and turns. You will love the ending!",1447804800,,817,4.8428571428571425

1034619,2,6305297525,"Quickie Review:

Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert once gave this movie two enthusiastic thumbs up. But if you go back and watch their review you'll notice they avoid talking about the script, editing, and story and focus solely on the visuals. Well, there's a reason for that.

I'm sorry, but with all due respect to the immensely talented and sorely missed Siskel, Ebert, and Williams, this movie is awful. It is visually stunning and so very creative, but that does not make it a good MOVIE. Not in this form. It has some interesting ideas, but the finished product fails to deliver on nearly every one of them, taking easy outs and weakly wrapping it all in a pretty bow. It groans under its own self importance and lacks the muscle to hold it all in place. When I watched it recently I was astounded to find that the picture I once held in such high regard when I was a teenager was actually a jumbled mess rife with cornball cliches barely hidden beneath a thin veneer of pretty eye-candy. The editing was atrocious, the story was a first draft amateur mess that excused its flaws by barely being one step above ""it's all just a dream."" The only redeeming factors are the visuals and Williams' acting. He owned every frame, every moment. But let's be honest here, you could get the most talented actor in the world to play out an episode of Honey Boo Boo and that wouldn't make it Shakespeare.

Individual scenes, when taken alone and out of context of the movie, are brilliant. As short films in an anthology they may have worked, but strung together the way they were and paced the way they were they come across less like an actual movie and more like someone trying to trick the audience into mistaking a high school student's short story as an epic masterpiece.

In the end, the reason this movie was most hard to watch was to see such effort, such craft, being wasted on such a terrible screenplay and burdened by the director's misguided need to play at making an ""art house picture.""",1433116800,,1991,4.522222222222222

1034802,5,6305297525,I believe this movie demonstrates quite well that we often create our own hell. I suppose the one thing that might offend some is the depiction of an afterlife that is not explicitly Christian. Be that as it may I would still encourage everyone to watch this movie with an open mind. The ultimate irony is that this movie also shows something that many might find difficult to reconcile with Robin Williams death. I would encourage everyone to view it with compassion.,1428969600,,468,4.719512195121951

The first time I watched this film I was actually not intending to watch it at all because I saw it advertised on TV but because of the special effects it seemed to be to be rather childish. But fate made me sit in front of the TV just when the film was starting and I watched it from start to end. The story is very inspiring, a real love story, not of princes and princesses but a love story in the real world, which shows that love does really conquer it all. Watch it and be as inspired as I was. Too bad that it didn't inspire my marriage.....  . Of course Robin Williams is one of the greatest actors of our times. Too bad he had to die so early.

The photography and the effects on this movie are amazing for that years. I think that this is a great movie to watch on a 4k screen the colors should pop up beautifully.

1035317,5,6305297525,"This movie is without a doubt one of Robin Williams best movies. It is VERY intense, very serious and has amazing special effects and acting. After the untimely deaths of both of his children, Chris's (Robin) wife is distraught and not long after, Chris is killed in a traffic accident, leading him to go to Heaven. After this, he discovers his wife killed herself and goes to Hell. The movie is about how Robin's character travels to Hell to try and save her from the demise as a suicide victim. It's very good, and the trailer and summary doesn't do it justice. It will be worth your money.",1420416000,,592,4.4907407407407405

The rich script by Richard Matheson and even-handed performance by Robin Williams worked well for me. It's a story that is really about *something* for a change, not just another mindless fantasy or action romp, although it has elements of those things, but done with imagination, artistry and restraint.",1420329600,,453,5.135135135135135

1036039,5,6305297525,"This is a tour de force performance by Robin Williams. It is made all the more poignant because the film's gist is that he has to save his wife from hell because she killed herself. In light of his own suicide, to see him saving someone else is almost a shattering experience. I did cry watching it.

The after life is splendidly recreated with every imaginative leap one could possibly make. On the box you see a dog by his side and that is the dog who died some years before his character died. That hit me very forcibly too. I saw this film originally in the movie theater when it came out in 1991. I was a fan of it then and I recollect most people were not.

My opinion has not changed in the intervening years. I could have stood a lighter hand on the music perhaps but that's just a quibble. After I initially saw the film I tried to read the novel. It was written in the 1950s by Richard Mathieson. I only got part way through it but the sheer imagination of the movie was just not there on the written page. Or perhaps it was that Robin Williams was not on the written page. It is hard to believe that a guy who could act such a serious part was also a world class stand up comic. He does manage to deliver a comic line near the end that I can't imagine any other actor pulling off given that he was inside of this serious script. You really need to see him in this if you have never seen this film before.  Bring a kleenex with you.

1036045,5,6305297525,"This movie is, to me, one of Robin Williams greatest features.  From the story line to the visual art graphics, to the cast and the directing, it is pure brilliance.  It is a believable, spiritual, mystical movie.  One that I can say, w/o a doubt, is a true type of story.  Cubba Gooding was the perfect choice to have as one of the main characters.  He and Robin both were so convincing, funny (of course) but also very serious.  The other cast members also added so much depth to the story.  Robin made this movie so believable, that even skeptics would have to reconsider their logic regarding the afterlife and reincarnation.  What Dreams May Come taps into the realm of Twin Flames (true soul mates) and does a fantastic job of explaining what it is like to be one.  In fact, this is a movie that could explain much to someone who is going through a spiritual  awaking, right now, and is looking for some type of validation or answers to their questions on the topic of Twin Flames/Soul Mates.  I could watch this movie over and over and never get bored.  Just with the colors of the art, this movie makes an impact.
Pure Brilliance, entertaining, and also very believable as to what is going on in the world of an awakening.  Highly recommend to all...even the skeptics.  I feel this movie may change their perspective on this subject.  With Robin starring in this one, this movie really could be the one to change a skeptics mind on the afterlife and soul mates.",1413072000,,1469,4.511363636363637

It is still as gorgeous and mindblowing as when I first saw it on the screen. The special effects, especially the painterly, Impressionistic treatment of the afterlife still takes my breath away. The fantasy like sequences, even the depictions of Hell are unforgettable. The story is just as haunting, even more so with Robin Williams' death. I remember thinking a long time ago how unusually romantic and soulful his performance was since I was used to seeing him in so many comedic roles. Sciorra looks even lovelier and her performance still poignant. This movie is such a treasure, such a classic.

The basic premise that is possible to visit Hell, Purgatory and Heaven has no basis in fact, as far as I'm concerned. But the plot gives food for thought.

1036138,5,6305297525,"This is a deeply emotional and dramatic look at death and the possibility of life after death.  One of Robin Williams' best dramatic performances, and definitely one of his classics.  This look at life after death is very philosophical, and is appropriate for people of every belief.  It is not specific to a specific doctrine, or, I would say, any doctrine at all.  Instead it takes a look at the possibility, and incorporates aspects of almost every major system of belief within that realm of possibility.  What it does really well is show people in many different forms coming to grips with death and its inevitability, and how that affects us all.  It is a great story about family, true and unconditional love, and unbreakable bonds that are created in these relationships.

I'm an avid moviegoer & I never tire of watching this. I would say it's a bittersweet movie about death & the afterlife. In fact, I hope I'm blessed in having the exact same surroundings when my time comes. Robin Williams role reveals his dramatic side of acting (a multi-facet genius ....who'll never be duplicated..MISS YOU, Robin..RIP). Annabella Sciorra, as his wife (who is awesome), as well. Cuba Gooding Jr. gives a fine performance also.

To me, it has a metaphysical tone in the movie.  I know everyone has their own opinions of life, death and life after death, but I think it is nice to think that when we die we have a choice to create our own afterlife. I think Robin Williams was a brilliant man and especially in that he could act in comedies as well as in dramas and I'm glad he was the actor for this movie.",1412035200,,512,4.009803921568627

1036319,3,6305297525,"THE FILM: WHAT DREAMS MAY COME is a visual feast (especially for 1998) that explores some weighty themes, but ultimately feels artificial and thinly painted. Robin Williams is Chris Nielsen, a doctor who suffers a great tragedy and ultimately is taken by fate as well. While in the afterlife, he goes on a journey to reunite himself with his wife. First of all, let me say that I don't subscribe to a belief in an afterlife, but the fact that the movie treats it as an objective thing wasn't really a problem for me. What was a problem was that the whole story was set up so quickly that the core relationship you're supposed to care about wasn't believable. Sure, the screenwriter covered themselves by having Chris and his wife (Annabella Sciorra) be ""soulmates,"" but this felt like a cop-out from actually doing some character development and building a believable relationship. However, the sentiment expressed by Chris' journey is an understandable one. It tells the story of a man who literally goes to hell and back just to be with the one he loves. Aside from that, the best part of the movie is the visual flair with which the afterlife is realized. One of Chris' passions is painting, and his early experiences there are very much painting-like. This film won the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects in 1999, and from what I could tell, it was definitely deserved. The effects weren't necessarily realistic, but they were impressionistic and artistic. On the downside, the metaphysical content and ideas are practically shoved down the viewers throats. There are many conversations laden with language that's supposed to sound like it's important, but the story never really lives up to these lofty ideas. Also, when you create a fantasy world there are often rules established to that everything isn't pure chaos. Here, there are some rules established but the film doesn't stick to them. At times, it's unclear how the afterlife works, which could be confusing to some people (assuming they even believe in such a thing). Overall, this is a very spiritual film that aspires to greatness, but is only ok. Robin Williams and the rest of the cast give excellent performances, but the visuals only serve to paint over the cracks in the story.

THE DISC: The film is very beautiful to look at, and it is reproduced wonderfully here on Blu-ray. There are also a number of extra features which are great supplements to the film. The first of these is an alternate ending that actually is significantly different than the one used for theaters. The next is a 15 minute featurette that has interviews with the cast and crew about the production and basic information about their characters. While it was nice to have this, it felt like more of a fluff piece than something that really delves into the meaning of the film. The last featurette is a five-minute exploration on the visual effects. Being that this film was highly dependent on the visual effects, I would have expected more, but it was nice to see how some of the shots were created. Rounding things out is a feature-length audio commentary by the director, Vincent Ward, and two theatrical trailers.

OVERALL: This isn't one of Robin Williams' best films, but the visual effects and core sentiment expressed make it worthy of viewing. There is also a decent amount of extras, for people who enjoy supplementary material. It's not an essential purchase, except maybe for die-hard Robin Williams fans or people who like very spiritual stories.",1410912000,,3509,4.866220735785953

1036438,3,6305297525,"The first part of the movie zooms by without developing any of the characters so you I didn't have much investment in who lives or dies and I couldn't really relate to anyone.  Their depiction and concept of Heaven and Hell was interesting. The storyline sounded interesting; !st Robin William's children die in an accident and he and his wife are devastated, then Robin, himself dies in another accident and his wife is so depressed after losing her whole family that she commits suicide. In the movie, Robin and the children go to Heaven but since suicide is a sin, his wife goes to Hell.  If you think this is a spoiler, you would be wrong; this all happens in a very short time after the movie starts. The rest of the movie is focused on Robin trying to get his wife out of Hell and into Heaven. If it had been done differently, I think it could have been a really good movie but for me it dragged on, and I almost fell asleep, in fact, I may have dozed off a couple of times. I like movies I don't want to end; this one, I couldn't wait for it to end. I have read somewhere that this movie is a sleeper and if you watch it over and over you will get it, more, and understand it better and you will see that it is really a very good movie, however; I can't bring myself to sit through it again but if you are game to find out then this is the movie for you.",1410480000,,1361,4.093632958801498

From my reading in near-death experiences, Buddhist literature on the Bardo, rebirth, etc.; I believe this film best captures what we on this side 'know' of the immediate afterlife than any movie on the subject. It's visually stunning and well acted, and has a very compelling plot. It's all the more poignant given how Robin Williams died.  I definitely place it amongst my top 5 favorite Robin William films.",1410307200,,505,5.011904761904762

1036598,5,6305297525,"What Dreams May Come. This movie showcases Robin Williams acting skills quite well. It is a story of a loving family that is struck twice by death,first the couple's two children. Four years later, the husband is killed in a massive car crash. The movie shows Chris (Robin Williams), the husband, going to Heaven. While exploring his heaven he finds that his wife has comitted suicide.

The rest of the movie shows Chris discovering his children and a long time mentor as he explores Heaven and searchs Hell for Annie, his wife. This is Robin  Williams acting in a Drama. It is not full of laughs, but it is not devoid of humor.

If you are a Robin Williams fan or simply like romantic stories about going to or being in Heaven, this is a movie to see. It is similar in tone to Patch Adams or One Hour Photo. If you are looking for a Laughfest,try watching something else.

May Robin Williams rest in peace.",1409961600,,907,4.445783132530121

1036656,5,6305297525,"Good movie that shows a more serious side of Robin Williams. While the background for the movie is set mostly in the afterlife it really explores what love can mean and how it can become toxic. Christy's journey to find and save his wife from hell after she commits suicide provides a glimpse into how a narrowly focused love can miss other people that also share the same journey. The ending provides a kickoff to another chance for Christy and Annabelle to share their lives and love while overcoming challenges.

The imagery is beautifully done and creates a world it is easy to be immersed in. Have tissues ready, a good movie to watch.",1409788800,,640,4.614035087719298
1036657,5,6305297525,"'What Dreams May Come' in my own personal opinion, this is the best movie and best actor, Robin Williams I have ever seen. We will all miss Williams, yet, this movie is very elusive in many ways of what happens to his children and then, his wife in the movie.

Anyhoo, I'd seen it before and remember thinking that it was just weird. It's still a bit weird. The ideas are innovative, but the execution of it feels preachy to me. It's really dark. I think you'd have to be in the right head space to watch it and enjoy it. I mean, it is about death and grief. It's interesting.

1036920,5,6305297525,"This is a beautiful film in every way, with an unforgettable performance by Robin Williams. Now that Williams has departed the earth, it is even more poignant to see his gentle but fiercely loving portrayals in this movie and in the film World's Greatest Dad.  In his life and as an actor, Robin's great heart shown through his every action, and that is never more vividly shown than in the roles he played in these two films.  His eyes reveal a heartfelt love touched with sadness, conveying to the audience a depth of emotion that goes far beyond acting. You get the feeling you are seeing the real Robin Williams, beneath his often-worn clown mask. What Dreams May Come is an educational film about the afterlife, from a book by Richard Matheson. It is based on numerous reports of near-death experiencers, who tell us that death is merely a transition from one world into another and that life continues on eternally. But most especially, in this film we learn that love transcends all dimensions and truly is the most powerful force in the universe.  Robin Williams and the love, laughter (and tears) he contributed to the world in his short life will live on--in his films and in our hearts.",1408924800,7,1197,4.690476190476191

1037000,5,6305297525,"This final film in my marathon I saved for the last because it is my favorite of all his movies.  Having grown up with Robin Williams, it's hard to believe he won't be there to crack another joke for us tomorrow, but I thank him for everything he's given to us, his adoring public.  I know suicide is a sin in Christianity, a theme that this movie (and novel) is based on in part, but still I'd like to think he wasn't at fault and it was his sickness that took over for that one second that really counted.  Or, that Heaven will forgive someone whose energy sped through several lifetimes in one, and just got tired.

I'm tearing up as I write this review because this is a really moving story, not only because I want to believe that Robin Williams found the peace and happiness he couldn't find with the living, but because it's about hope, and true love and redemption -- all really heavy themes -- played against a beautiful backdrop that is like a vibrant, living oil painting.

This is pure eye candy for visual thinkers like me, where a picture speaks a thousand words.  It's also very romantic when you watch a man dive into the unthinkable to find his one true love and save her.

Though every character is technically ""on the other side"" it's a happy ending when you think everyone who has ever touched your life will be waiting for you when you get there.

I'd like to believe that Mr. Williams' Heaven is exactly as he imagined it and when the rest of us catch up, he'll still be there to crack us another joke.

I usually stay away from movies like this because they bring me down but because Robin Williams is in it, I made an exception. The story focuses on Christy who dies after an accident and wakes up in heaven guided by an angel. Leaving his wife, Annie a widow years after losing their two children, she takes her life. But because she committed suicide she cannot be with Christy and has been condemned to an eternity of suffering. After being told that no one has been brought back from the hell Annie has been condemned to,
Christy vows to bring Annie back. This movie turned me into mush but I loved it. It is one of the most romantic movies I have seen in a long time.",1408492800,,760,4.284722222222222

Certainly a broad variety of faith-based beliefs offer their points of view. The uncertainty of what dreams may come was the crux of Hamlet's soliloquy (the title is derived from one of its lines) and this film poignantly weaves the ""what ifs"" as an offering for viewers to ponder. I found the whole context to be ultimately uplifting despite the heartache that goes hand in hand with act of departing, those coping with the departures, and what the dearly departed encounter. My hope is that what comes next is a spectacular journey to another realm brimming over with infinite possibilities. I viewed it when first released in theatres, again when I've seen it on TV, and purchased it this week after Williams' passing knowing it was how I wanted to reflect upon his boundless talents.",1408233600,3,919,4.859872611464968

1037431,5,6305297525,"I usually don't write film reviews, but with the passing of Robin Williams, I felt a need to express some feelings for the man and the actor who I truly adored.
I remembered when I first saw the trailer for the movie, I was blown away. It felt like living in a Monet painting. I had never truly seen anything like it before.
To think that this film was made over 15 years ago, yet the visual effects still look great today is a testament to its achievement.

**Minor spoiler alert**
To the film itself - the premise is that Robin Williams' character is involved in an accident and dies. Because he doesn't want to leave his wife and his family, his spirit lingers on to look after her. His guardian angel in the afterlife is played by Cuba Gooding Jr., who guides him and eases his transition into the afterlife. This part of the movie is still light-hearted, very colorful, very serene. This is the most visually beautiful part of the movie. However, things turn for the worse when Williams' wife can't bear his loss any longer, and takes her own life. Suicide is one of the ultimate sins, so instead of joining Williams, her spirit must go to Hell. The story of the movie is Williams' journey to rescue his wife's spirit and allow her to join him in Heaven, which is an almost impossible task considering such a feat has never been accomplished before. In the basic sense, this is a story of how Love can triumph over anything.

This movie might not be one of Robin's best acting, but it does belong in your collection if you want something visually beautiful, and if you're a fan of his. It's one of those films, like ""The Cell,"" whose visuals will always stick with you and withstand the test of time.

It obviously made it all the more poignant, and, as I'd already been weeping, I cried through much of the film. I had to wonder how much of this haunting story and its many questions about life, death, life-after-death, suicide and redemption resonated in William's sorely tormented mind at the time he took his own life.

The movie itself is a visually wonderful, often painfully beautifully, often tragically diabolical, much as in a Bosch grotesque yet fantastical image. It is a fine cast, although the ending is a bit perturbingly abrupt/too clean cut.

I will watch it again, but probably not for quite some time. It's a lot of emotions to handle, maybe too many, but though-provoking and memorable.",1408060800,9,777,4.923664122137405

1037608,5,6305297525,"Like millions all over the world, I'm deeply saddened about the loss of Robin Williams. What a truly gifted, funny, talented, marvelous man he was, and he will never be forgotten.

""What Dreams May Come"" is not only my favorite Robin Williams movie, but it is also my favorite film of all-time. I saw this film 5 times in the theatre when it came out back in 1998. It touched me so deeply on so many different levels, and it still does. It's the most beautiful love story I have ever seen on film, both of romantic love and the love of family. The movie also speaks to me spiritually, as it explores quite wonderfully the ""what-if"" possibilities of the afterlife. This film always takes me on the most amazing journey every time I watch it. Robin Williams' heartfelt performance is nothing short of outstanding, as are the performances of Annabella Sciorra, Cuba Gooding Jr., and Max Von Sydow. Vincent Ward's direction is superb. And the visuals of the afterlife in this film, both Heaven and Hell....those magnificent, Oscar-winning visuals....""What Dreams May Come"", even now, still stands for me as the most breathtakingly beautiful-looking film I have ever seen. And the ending of this movie....simply perfect.

Back in 1998, ""What Dreams May Come"", probably because of it's heavy subject matter, was not well-received on its initial release, despite that Visual Effects Oscar (and some very high praise from Siskel & Ebert, two of the very few critics who *did* recognize the film's greatness at the time). But I'm so glad to see that the passing of time has been very kind to ""What Dreams May Come"", with more and more people discovering this wonderful film, and not only discovering it, but understanding it, appreciating it, and being moved by it. And despite the terrible, heartbreaking tragedy of losing Robin Williams, ""What Dreams May Come"", as well as Robin's magnificent performance in it, now takes on a whole new poignancy.

I am grateful to know that people are now turning to ""What Dreams May Come"" in droves to remember Robin Williams by, as evidenced by the film's new resurgence in popularity. Of course people are watching his other great films too. So am I. For great bellylaughs, Robin's hilarious voicework in ""Aladdin"" and ""Robots"" will do very nicely. ""Good Morning Vietnam"" and ""Awakenings"" are also great Robin Williams movies. But ""What Dreams May Come"", in particular, seems to be the people's #1 choice of the man's film work at the moment, and for this I am very, very happy.

I think that is all I can say. I love Robin Williams, and I love ""What Dreams May Come"". God bless you, Robin. Thank you for all the joy that you gave us. Be at peace.",1407974400,,2678,4.765086206896552

1037744,5,6305297525,"This is honestly one of my favorite movies. They address not just the bright side of the ideas of what happens when one passes on but also the negative side such as hell. They bring up many different religions of the here and now and address a few of the different levels of the plans of existence.

The acting is great and this movie is one of my favorite Robin Williams movies. I do find it ironic they address what happens to people who take their own life and Williams took part as the lead in this movie and he took his own life many years later.

It really is a good movie and it doesn't stick to just one religious ideology of the after life which makes me happy to see. Because it's not just heaven is clouds and angles flying everywhere like most movies focus on when they talk about heaven.",1407974400,,800,4.222222222222222

Quirky in spots, the plot is saved by interesting (and at times rather imaginative) visuals. However, the sub-plots and flashback sequences may make this hard to understand if you're not completely following everything.

1038500,5,6305297525,"This outstanding movie is an emotional home run.  A grand slam that clears the bases bringing home loss, pain, grief, and joy. Fully expressed and realized in the surprising visuals (Ellen M. Somers), magnificent photography (Eduardo Serra) and carried throughout with an intoxicating musical score (Michael Kamen and The London Metropolitan Orchestra) that hauntingly swells with intensity. Vincent Ward impeccably directs a visual feast portrayed through paintings.  They literally come to life throughout the film placing the viewer into another dimension all within the changes of Chris Nielsen (Robin Williams) and perfectly ethereal Annie's (Annabella Sciorra) realities.

The two meet quite suddenly while vacationing and remarkably find that they are truly soulmates.  They may not fully realize its beauty at this venture but as time passes the wonder becomes more and more evident.  A lifetime together is altogether inevitable as they marry, have two children and begin a lovely family life.  What is immediately sorrowful is the tragic accident that takes the lives of their children and throws the couple into gut-wrenching grief.

The story jumps ahead four years while the pain of loss is taking any life from the brilliantly artistic Annie.  Her paintings (done by Stephen Hannock) are being affected and her mind is becoming more distraught.  It is then that a freak accident happens again and Chris dies.  She is left alone, her family gone and also her own will to live.  From this moribund beginning comes a fantastic living tale of a husband's passionate and overwhelming love for his wife driving him through heaven and hell to find her.

Chris' journey begins in a heaven that he has created for himself but seen through the paintings of Annie.  An angel guide, Albert (Cuba Gooding Jr.), is there to aid him in realizing that he has died and must go on separately.  His creation is awash in vibrant color with an identifiable use of the color blue from the start of the film.  What he sees and makes true for himself is what Annie creates or has created.  The look at morality is done without a major pull onto any certain religion so it can astoundingly stretch the boundaries.  It's quite another view of the afterlife that is as imaginarily beautiful in its heaven as it is as boldly macabre in its hell.

Annie takes her own life.  Albert gives this information to Chris who becomes desperate to save his wife from the hell she has also created.  The movie treats the act of suicide very differently than the way it may be viewed by some, with more of a compassionate tone.  As freeing as Chris' reality may be, Annie's is quite deliberately confining.  The visuals and the sets come to life and seduce the viewer into a horrifically confused state of mind.  The Tracker (Max Von Sydow) takes Chris to places where no other has ever gone, as nobody has ever been brought back from this terrifying place.  Annie does not know him here, she has slipped into her mind and birthed a place of repetitive torture.

Based on the novel by Richard Matheson with a masterful screenplay by Ron Bass, the story jumps off the screen and truly captivates.  A very active movie that effectually works all the way around, digging deep to portray this transcendent love between husband and wife.

I remember the movie being bashed and laughed at and decided to come on Amazon to see if people had changed their minds. Four stars and 600 plus ratings later, I was happy to see that people had. In these difficult times when we lose loved one way too often, this movie is hope-filled and a balm against such loss. More than that, it is a testament to the power of love. There are a few sayings about love: that it is forever and can overcome any obstacle. This movie brings both to light. I applaud the director, the cast and the crew. This has become a timeless classic for myself and many many others...",1371513600,,905,4.425149700598802
1038622,5,6305297525,"This film is a most fascinating depiction of the possible reality of life beyond this life. While I do not personally believe in an after life of any type of hell, I do see the truth of the hell people create for themselves and others on this planet now.
Jesus Christ himself said that ""The kingdom of God is within you."" It stands to reason that so is Hell.
My favorite scene is when Robin William's character finds his wife in her hell and tries to connect with her. The dialogue that comes out of his mouth is absolute truth!
In our world culture, men are taught not to feel anything that is less than wonderful.- with the exception of anger. The sad result is the frustration of inability to connect with others, especially the opposite sex, emotionally.
When Robin's character decides it's better to live in hell with the one he loves than live in heaven without her, he takes the plunge, the risk of being doomed to hell forever, only to find that that is the only way his wife can FEEL his love, which empowers her to come out of her hell.
Oh if every man could watch that film and wake up to the meaning and abiltiy to connect with others on an emotional level, they would find that they can leave hell and enter into heaven in their relationships.  Not everyone is willing, nor necessarily able, yet many could have a much different life experience if they learned the lessons that Robin's character was able to learn.

1038835,4,6305297525,"You probably need to be someone who can handle your emotional state of mind to keep it together while watching this one...

What Dreams May Come is a really emotional love story... but not right away.  Quite the opposite in the beginning.  This part is about Robin Williams first losing his kids in a car accident, then losing himself in a separate car accident, and finally losing his wife to suicide.  Now that's what I call the ultimate depressing storyline!  However, it's not *entirely* devoted to sadness (hence the ""love story"" part).

What happens is that Robin Williams eventually arrives in what appears to be either someone's imagination with painted backgrounds, or heaven itself.  Robin Williams is easily the star of this movie and receives the most attention.  For a little while, Robin Williams appears to be here alone and finds himself exploring the curiosities of this unexplainable and high imaginative world, but soon he meets up with his deceased dog now as a younger pup, and another man (and later on, a shrink with important knowledge concerning people's fate).  We then learn Robin is actually in heaven and the paintings are part of his wifes drawings.  Interesting stuff.

As a viewer, you'll be totally caught up in the beautifully created backgrounds.  Nothing like I've ever seen in a movie, that's for sure.  The one segment with a bird flying above and soaring through painted skies is a highlight.

Unfortunately this movie isn't without a few minor flaws.  For one thing, I'm not crazy about the belief that those who commit suicide go somewhere else.  I don't believe this personally- that's why I don't like it.  However that's not the reason I'm lowering the overall rating to 4-stars.  It wouldn't be fair to lower the rating based on personal beliefs anyway.  It's how the beauty and adventure of the heavenly state we experience in the first half is exchanged for a slow-moving emotional journey to find Robin's wife in the second half.  A good chunk of this is, I'm afraid, quite boring (due to so many romantic and meaningful flashbacks between Robin and his wife).  But I suppose a second viewing might change my mind.

The ending is amazing though.  About the best way to wrap up these events.  Overall, a really well-made movie with a unique spin on the afterlife.  I'm warning you though- it CAN get really emotional on a few occasions, and if you're easily bored you've been warned about the second half.",1360713600,,2452,4.836538461538462

1038926,2,6305297525,"This movie had some beautiful parts - mainly the art theme and beautiful coloring. But for me it wasn't believable mainly because of a lack of character development. The love story between Chris and Anna didn't draw me in. There just wasn't any chemistry between them in the beginning, and their love affair (i.e. their becoming ""soul mates"") happened too fast for me to feel like I witnessed or felt it happen. Then came their two kids who we were watching the funeral for just a few minutes after first meeting them. Again, very little character development. The deaths of the children should have caused me to feel the hurt and loss that Chris and Anna would feel as their parents. But, instead, it was very fairly unemotional for me because there was no chance for me to connect with them as characters. This movie could have been done so much better. It seems rushed and, well, carelessly put together. It is hard to follow and even borders on ridiculous at points.

The actors did a good job with what they were given to work with. Robin Williams, being the funny guy that he is, can sometimes be hard to believe in a romantic role. But, I've seen a couple of other movies of his where he was able to pull it off so I don't lay the blame on him. Annabella Sciorra's acting was fine as was Cuba Gooding Jr's (whose presence helped carry this movie along, in my opinion - - that is, until it was revealed who his character really was).

Having the children become other people in ""heaven"" just increased the distance I already felt from their characters. Finally, the end of the movie with the family reuniting in ""heaven"" brought the chaotic storyline to a close and I was able to smile because they were at least all together and it was over.

I did not expect anyone to ""go to hell"" for suicide after loosing their children and then later their spouse.  It was a turnoff.  I don't believe those in deep despair are to be jugdged totally by this desperate single action. Its as if their whole life counted for zero and a horrid few months or years of unbearable grief makes them horrible enough to burn forever.  How mean and how silly for US to come to that belief. I think when outside horrors kill one's spirit and ability to go on, that many suicides are not thought out in any way.  And they are very personal..not meant to harm anyone else.  PTSD comes to mind.. loosing all one's family is another. (and the Bible was written by man btw)  Suprised Robin would do this movie.",1355529600,,872,4.351851851851852

ROBIN WILLIAMS is absolutely BRILLIANT in this role. His performance is STELLAR.

CUBA GOODING JR.(I think he is a great actor equally capable in drama/melodrama and comedy) is REALLY, REALLY GOOD in his role, as well (he has not appeared in movies nearly as often as he should have). ANNABELLA SCIORRA deftly holds her own with a performance that STUNNINGLY equals her costars performances. ENORMOUS PERFORMANCES by everyone in the movie. BREATHTAKING ACTING.
The movie is slow. It did not bother me (especially considering the exceptional acting, the EXQUISITE visuals, and the AMAZING SPECIAL EFFECTS (especially the depiction of HELL--off the chart GOOD). BUT others may find the pace annoying.

1038965,5,6305297525,"Hi,

 It's a beautiful movie yet, as with most movies to movie form, it's a very trimmed version of the book which contains a massive amount of information.  Most of which is accurate...aside from the Christian view...which usually lacks correct information.

 The movie uses paintings as a way to show how our thoughts create our world....which is very different than the book.  The directory did convert it nicely to film.  However, and I really like that both endings are included.  Well made movies, like this, usually inspire people to go to the book to get more info.  I didn't really feel that with the movie.  My life's experiences have very much been about what the movie is about, so I already Know things the movie was talking about well before ever seeing it, and I remember Past Lives but I focus on Now.  It's not a Believe System for me..it IS Knowing.  I remember also, before being Born. Not many do, and that's something that IS touched on in this movie.  Step away from the Churchianity Belief System (which I was never indoctrinated into) and you'll See the many Truths this movie speaks of.  Note, please, that I'm not typing about Christianity as the 2 are very, very different.

 There is No Death, only Life...on many levels/dimensions and there is NOT just 1 Life.  That is a very popular misinformation and in NO religion has that ever been Taught.  This movie makes very clear what Heaven and Hell are...Emotional!  Not actual PLACES Unless Your ""Belief System"" is that a Hell exists, then you'll Create it for Yourself.  It's awesome to know, You're in control...either way.  I Love Life, and the Leading Edge Adventure that it is.  It's a Wonderful gateway movie to the Book.  Please read it, but without Brainwashed Church views.  Then you'll get the Truth that's being shared.

 If you want to REALLY know More... Check into The Law of Attraction.  Abraham-Hicks.  Also get the movie, The Celestine Prophecy. It speaks of the Power we Have within Us.

1039090,4,6305297525,"In every sense of the word, this is the most romantic movie I can remember. That does not mean it is all sentimental hugs and kisses. It delves darkly into isolation and longing, death and despair; like an extended romantic poem, it presents some intensely subjective visions of a man's relationship to others and to the natural and supernatural worlds. In fact, as director Vincent Ward admits near the end of an excellent commentary track, this is nothing less than a New Age reworking of the ancient legend of Orpheus, who descended into the deepest depths of Hades' realm in hope of finding his beloved wife and restoring her to life and light. In this movie, however, the husband dies first and then begins his quest to be reunited with his love.

Any review of this film--and any brief excerpt promoting it--must communicate a sense that it is visually dazzling, finding unprecedented techniques to create properly dreamlike visions of afterlife situations: The characters are immersed in settings vast and brilliant, inspired by a dozen painters from various eras of art history, brushstrokes and all. More surprising, perhaps, is the formidable acting of Annabella Sciorra and especially Robin Williams, communicating a whole palette of nuanced emotions in a noncomic role. (How could anyone complain of a lack of chemistry between them!) The movie's structure is unorthodox, with its strategically positioned, unexpectedly believable flashbacks, and throughout the journey, Michael Kamen's lush orchestral score sweeps us onward, adding hugely to the emotional experience. The surround sound is likewise spectacular.

The weak link, if any, is the script. At best, it is properly unpredictable and sometimes exquisitely crafted (as in Chris's eulogy at the funeral of his teenage son). At other times it becomes unnecessarily vulgar or takes a few steps toward pretentiousness, which means that some viewers may be pardoned for finding individual moments off-putting or vaguely silly. All the same, we feel a bit cheated when an occasional line is hard to hear clearly on first viewing--for instance, because of Max von Sydow's accent. Though his relatively brief performance as a rather grumpy spiritual ""tracker"" is too understated and matter-of-fact for my taste, old von Sydow does get one of the best moments, when he dramatically warns our hero that the real danger of Hell is not physical torment but losing one's sanity and, by implication, one's soul. And if this film succeeds in provoking some fresh thoughts and feelings about all our preconceptions regarding life after death, surely that in itself is a triumph.

As a bonus feature, the DVD includes an early, alternative version of the movie's final two scenes (with their postproduction aspects not fully polished). I have a slight preference for this original ending, though I might have left its last two minutes on the cutting-room floor. While it presents a different, more explicit, more complex picture of what lies ahead for the two soul mates, it does not drastically change the feeling or message of the movie. We might also recognize that the theatrically released ending, though sometimes dismissed as overly ""cute,"" does a neater job of bringing the story full circle.

(There is one slight problem with the DVD, as both the trailers and the alternative ending have been vertically squeezed to an aspect ratio of nearly 3:1, making the actors appear fatter than they are. By contrast, the feature film is presented with an aspect ratio a bit narrower than the advertised 2.35:1, making us wonder whether the extreme left and right edges of the image have been chopped off.)

At a time when virtually every Hollywood product steals ideas from countless films that came before, _What Dreams May Come_ is genuinely original and unique, not to say profoundly beautiful. It may appeal to the same audience as other modern ""love stronger than death"" movies such as _Defending Your Life_ and _Just Like Heaven_, yet it is more serious and far more ambitious in its aims than those two. Connoisseurs of classic international cinema may observe some thematic connections with the works of Jean Cocteau, or may note that Vincent Ward and his team capture some of Powell and Pressburger's creative excitement about exploiting Technicolor in the service of a surreal spirit. More simply, _What Dreams May Come_ does what movies ought to do but rarely achieve: instead of merely telling a story, it helps us see the world in a new way, through *moving* visual images that no other medium could so effectively present.

1039092,4,6305297525,"Whenever Robin Williams stars in a film that is out of the ordinary of his comedic roles, he shows what acting is about.  ""What Dreams May Come"" is one of the examples of Williams's diverse filmography that surpasses the humor he is so well know for.  The film focuses on how one handles grief and loss, but what is unique is how it is approached -- much like an artist's blank canvas.  As personal expressions are interpreted within the canvas in the form of colorful and emotional images, one realizes that the memories and the images can forever be embedded within the frame of a canvas.  For Williams's character Chris, that appears to be the case but not quite coincidental because his wife Annie (Annabella Sciorra) was an artist.  Chris and Annie's subject on the canvas is coming to terms with their children's death.

Through present events and flashbacks before the loss, Director Vincent Ward shows that Chris and Annie lived an average life.  Their life changes after their children's accident and the quick turn of events that have Chris, especially Annie struggling to overcome their grief.  Certain parts of the film may pay reminders to other films that depict characters encountering or about to encounter life changing moments, ""It's A Wonderful Life,"" ""City of Angels,"" ""Heaven Can Wait,"" and ""Meet Joe Black.""  Indeed, all of these films possess a metaphysical quality, but ""What Dreams May Come"" may stand out from all of the above.  Chris appears to be in limbo between heaven and hell, and it is where he first ends up that looks like paradise - his wife's paintings, beautiful and celestial.  However, he is not alone in his journey and is accompanied by the first doctor that he had interned with, Albert (Cuba Gooding, Jr.).  And one wonders of the significance of each and every character or events that Chris experiences, which may make the viewer think beyond appearances.  Ward is very suggestive of the storyline that delves much deeper into the examination of natural order and choice and how it relates to how individuals deal with loss.

""What Dreams May Come"" is thought provoking and questions may arise throughout the film and after.  So many words can describe the story being told within the film, but one phrase comes to mind, life is like a painting.",1340496000,,2291,4.838461538461538

There, he discovers his power to create anything that is produced in his own mind. Albert (Gooding, Jr.), his longtime mentor, guides him through the process.

What Dreams May Come is a very beautiful film. Even if it's very different from the original novel (which I have never read, by the way), it does its job very well with its fantastic visuals. The heavenly landscapes created by the human mind are very creative: special effects are particularly stunning. The plot may be a little thin, but the most important elements in this film are the visuals. The acting is also satisfactory: Robin Williams plays yet another dramatic role without a hitch. He is completely convincing as a man who [almost] finds himself in harmony in heaven. Annabella Sciorra is lovely and memorable as Collins who is struggling to cope with her huge personal loss. Cuba Gooding Jr. gives a terrific performance as Albert: it's clear that he is enjoying himself with the role.

I had no real idea what I was in for with this film, but it is probably the most visually stunning film I've ever seen.  If you like art you will love this film just for the gorgeous art references.  It's unbelievably beautiful at times and darkly frightening at others.

The story is truly heartbreaking, but worth the journey.  All in all a cathartic experience (and isn't that one of the great outcomes of a fine film?)

In fact before you watch it ask yourself if you got all the actors in Hollywood together with their feel-good reality-is-what-you-make-of-it mumbo jumbo to decide what the afterlife would be like what you'll come up with is probably this movie.  The ending has a twist in the last couple minutes that is just so typical of the kind of people who think that falling in love is better than being in love (ie - shallow people who aren't very good at maintaining relationships).  To someone like me who prizes wisdom above the torturous path to get wisdom, well ... let's just say that it seems those who don't probably have never gained wisdom in the first place and spend to much time romanticizing the way things were than appreciating what really happened and getting on with eternity.  In short, if that's what heaven is like (and I'm confident it isn't) then no wonder why so few people are interested in getting there.  Sad thing is ... I think most people think that's what it is and don't yet realize what a drag that kind of eternity would be.  IMO there is so much more to the universe and the rest of eternity than what's on this amazing little planet ... this life is just a stepping stone to get there, and well if I were to do a movie about what I think the afterlife is like ... it would blow your mind if you thought this movie came even moderately close.

I don't know if that was due to what he was witnessing or a realization ... but regardless I think film could not come close to do justice to what the world beyond this one is really like, let alone the reality of what the purpose of our existence here really is about.",1325721600,,1847,4.2722063037249285

This movie is not saying to everyone this is heaven.  I like a lot of the parts of this movie. There were also parts I did not like.  I would like to believe that heaven for me is an environment I could create and spend eternity in peace and happiness.  That is what I and I mean I would like.  However if someones idea of heaven is living with God looking over your shoulder or angels all around them,  or ghosts flying around, etc you get my point, then I say great.  However that is not my view of what I want heaven to be for me.  Again people are not open minded enough to look and say hey it is okay your opinion is different than mind that is what makes this world interesting that we all are different and have different beliefs.  I love the idea of a person that is willing to risk their happiness just to be with the one they love because they do not want them to be alone.  Even if they do not remember them.  So very few people have what it takes to be self sacrifing. That is one of the thing I took away from the movie as well as the strong emotion of love.

Okay, so the special effects were cool, but that really doesn't make up for the bad acting and lack of plot. Also, the special effects were better suited for a children's fantasy movie, although the theme was very mature -- dealing with death, heaven, hell and suicide. It just left me shaking my head in confusion. And plus, the main character (Chris) was completely uncaring about his children, and more interested in his stupid dog and a TREE one minute, but then a loving, doting father. Honestly?!?! Talk about mixed messages. This really could have been an interesting story, the main idea was thought-provoking, but it was executed in such a haphazard manner. There were tons of holes in the plot, supposedly there are not ruled in heaven, and then suddenly there are. This could have been a good movie, but unfortunately it very fell short of my expectations.",1309996800,4,1103,4.810526315789474
1039207,4,6305297525,"Wonderful movie, but there's plenty out there on that and the DVD reviews cover that just fine.

Image quality is for the most part a substantial upgrade over the DVD, especially for the impressionist painting sequences, where you can really see the brush strokes and a just incredible level of detail. There are some later scenes which aren't quite as good, especially the flashback sequences with the son, but they were like that on the DVD. The parts that the PQ matters for are gorgeous. If you loved the look of this movie you WILL want this Blu Ray.

Didn't really notice improvements in the sound. It's still a 5.1 soundtrack, no better no worse as far as I could tell from a single viewing.

The alternate ending (the one from the Richard Matheson story the movie is a pretty dammed faithful adaptation of) is 16x9 in a 4x3 ratio box. So it takes up about a quarter of the screen. Granted was not very good video quality to begin with, but still an odd choice. You'd think it wouldn't have been that difficult to just set it to a full 16x9. But the PQ of it wouldn't have been any better.

That being said, the romantic story that holds it together works incredibly well. Robin Williams fits perfectly into this movie. He manages to convey the right sense of emotion for each scene, yet remaining capable of the occasional odd bits of humor. Everything just fits together so well in such an emotional masterpiece.

I have never read the book. That being said, having read some of Masterson's work and reading the differences between the film and book I can say this is probably a much more enjoyable movie for its genre. If they were to have been true to the book I'd imagine it would be much less of a beautiful love story, and much more of a metaphysical view of the afterlife.",1303430400,,854,4.618421052631579

It may be rather slow at times, and while it might have served better ""movie-wise"" for something to be more fast paced, they worked instead at the feeling of hopelessness as Chris (Robin Williams) searches for his soulmate and wife in purgatory after she killed herself, due to the death of Chris, her husband, and her children.

All in all, the concept that is conveyed still corroborates with all the other sources I have found concerning death, life after death, and reincarnation, and that ""hell"" is a personal one that can only be set free by those who recognize this and make the choice to cross over to the light (the other side).

1039279,5,6305297525,"Lately I've been on a Robin Williams kick, having enjoyed Bicentennial Man recently.  I picked up this DVD and though the film tends to be maudlin at times, overall is quite a production!

Philosophy:

In my studies I had discovered that thought is greater than reality, and that you are not your arms, legs or brain, but you are you as a spiritual being.  The film emphasized this without beating you over the head with its spiritual thought & inspiration, but was necessary to develop this concept for the film to make sense!

Annie & Chris:

Annie & Chris meet with the typical Hollywood ""cute moment.""  They ram their boats into each other in Europe.  Annie has claimed Switzerland in the name of Minnesota and Chris just claims her for his bride.  We don't get a lot of character development here until well into the film.  The flashback sequences are done well and are at times extremely emotional.  Their life looks great until their children get killed in a car crash.  Annie blames herself and goes into a deep depression which she never recovers.

Mythology:

There are ancient tales of the hero travelling into the depths of hell to recover his love.  Even the gates of hell in the film had a large ship with the name Cerberus (the three headed dog, natch!) on front!  The imagery of heaven and hell are well-presented.  The crazy Raphaelian paintings; the upside-down cathedral; the heaven created that is actually made of paint! Crazy!

Ending:

The movie slam-punches grief until you can just cry with the anguish that  Annie feels.  The film tastefully covers the areas of suicide and never giving up.  And even when you lose, you win (still trying to wrap my wits  on this one).  Movie critics have said that Robin Williams and Annabella Sciorra were not in tune in this film, but I beg to disagree.  At times maudlin and heart-wrenching, the actors do indeed put their heart into their work and come  out shining.

DVD:

Has an alternate ending which I'm glad was not in the final cut.  The actual ending was more a message of hope that did not drag the story way out.  The ""making of"" segment with a few words from the novelist Richard Matheson was also enjoyable.

Recommended!

The summary got me hooked; I opened the case and it was empty, so I decided to get the movie here off of Amazon. I was really looking forward to watching it. It did have many good points in it, however it was missing the things that really connect the audience to what's happening in the movie. The most emotional part of the movie is when each of the characters loses a loved one, mainly the character played by Robin Williams . This is constructed well, but it comes too soon for the viewers to really have a connection to the loss; you don't learn more about each of the characters until later, after their death.
The characters were also unrelatable. They had likes, dislikes, jobs, wishes that were separated from the audience. They were generally good characters, but they didn't help the audience bond with them, which is a key element in any movie.
Overall, the movie was also really depressing. It had some high points, but those were too whimsical to make up for the low points. I wouldn't recommend it.

1039347,1,6305297525,"I read the book when it first came out and have re-read it thru the years, as it's one of my all time favorites.  I always thought it would make a wonderful movie and waited for years until this one finally came out in the late 90s....I was so excited when I heard that it was finally going to be made into a movie...until I saw the movie.  I don't believe I have ever been more disappointed in my life in a book-to-movie movie.

They took way too many liberties with regards to changes in the movie that it almost made it seem like a totally different story.  By killing off the children (which did not happen in the book) it made it seem like the grief Ann would have felt at losing Chris would not have been life shattering enough.  THEN they killed him off.  The point of the whole story was the closness between Chris and Ann...THEIR bond...which was stronger than anything else in their lives.  That was the point of the story.  And while I love Robin Williams, I felt that his portrayal of Chris bordered on silliness.  Hollywood even had to change Chris' profession...I guess him being a writer wasn't acceptable enough.....they made him a doctor.

To say I was highly disappointed in the movie is an understatement.  I don't blame Richard Matheson for being disappointed as well..... "" I was disappointed in it, because it changed a good deal of my story, and I thought by their desire to have the two children die before him - they did that because they felt that if she committed suicide and left children behind, the audience would not like her, which, you know, may or may not be true - but it made for terrible complications, I thought, especially when they decided not even to identify them in the afterlife but to have them disguised as various other people."" Richard Matheson - quote.

Well, said Richard.  I guess Hollywood felt that they knew more about your book than you did.  Evidently not because the movie, in my opinion, was AWFUL!!!!! I do give credit to special effects, though......without them, the movie was a disaster.

FORGET THE MOVIE..........READ THE BOOK!!!!",1263254400,27,2094,4.591397849462366
1039348,5,6305297525,"Aside from traditional teachings about heaven or hell, this movie explores possibilities beyond what most of us ever consider feasible and therefore we tend to disregard this kind of thinking before we acknowledge the beauty and transcending wonder of just might be the best movie to define the kind of love most of us really, honestly desire to be part of - both sides of such a depth of loving another person. Anabella Sciorra is a an absolutely beautiful woman who was able to find her prince charming fairy tale type partner and then through accidental death loses him and finds herself unable to get past the grieving over her loss. Robin Williams is the character married to Anabella's character, and the film takes us through several channels of him discovering heaven to be quite different than he anticipated. Then this fantastic adventure of imagination and splendor includes Robin Williams deciding in his role to seek out what may or may not be conquerable regarding the experiences of heaven and hell. Normally I don't like extremely serious dramas about very wealthy people who are so successful in life, because of how hard I've worked at it myself and just never have found open doors for me. But I couldn't help getting caught up in this film because in my heart I still hope for that kind of love, that kind of commitment to be reciprocated in a loving relationship, and this film does a super job of challenging my attention and some of the elements of the writer's imagination are simply put, fascinating beyond anything I had seen before I viewed this film. It came out almost 12 years ago, but the special effects and depth of entertainment would be just as well received today.

It starts out with tragedy and takes a very long time to swoop out of it - in the end it is an uplifting movie, and amazingly crafted both visually and philosophically - but for the majority of the movie it grips you hard by your emotional core and doesn't let go.
The visual style is incredible, the special effects way ahead of their time, and a take on both cinematic presentation and the afterlife unlike any I've ever seen before.

It can be at times a little heavy-handed and overly serious, but with both incredibly strong performances across the board and a deeply compelling story. This movie definitely goes high on my list as a little-known must see movie.",1260489600,2,725,4.451127819548872

I didn't see it in the theater but finally saw it on DVD when it came out.  Yes, this movie is so vividly colorful and amazing.
But on the flip side, it is profoundly sad and gut-wrenching too. I ended up having to stop watching it half-way through and come back to finish
watching it a few hours later.

One thing that bothered me though was the discontinuous story-line. It was often hard to follow as the story seemed to jump around chronologically
and some of the situations were confusing and unclear.

But all in all, I did like the movie and found it amazing to watch. I would recommend it. I think its a good example of ""love conquers all"" even through
heaven and hell and the afterlife.",1257033600,,836,4.415584415584416
1039417,4,6305297525,"First and foremost, if you are interested in Samkhya Philosophy / Yogic self-cultivation and death and dying, this film was pretty much made for you.  If not, you may be disappointed.  Please do a modicum of research on this topic before watching as it will make the entire premise of the film more understandable.  For example, you'll notice that no one knows who or what God is at this stage, which just follows suit with the philosophy.  Divine interaction in the afterlife occurs more intimately at the karana and parusha realms.  I my opinion, this film follows the philosophy to a T, so in this sense I think the movie is spot on.  I get the feeling that many reviewed this move projecting values upon it that were never there in the first place.

My biggest concern with this movie is that the casting is absolutely horrible.  I mean just awful!  To boot, the writing seemed just sorta tossed together.  It's as if they had this great idea and nifty special effects, but then just figured that if they got a big name star, the rest would just take care of itself.  Well, it didn't.

Robin Williams plays a static, overly impulsive and stubborn man who seems to spout useless clichs whenever given the chance.  His daughter is pretty much stoic and his son seems a bit out of his league.  The only believable character is his wife.  As I'm not a big fan of Cuba Gooding jr. I don't feel my commentary on his lack-luster and spastic performance is very meaningful.

Without getting too much into the plot, how the after life functions seems right on.  In the film, Williams is met by a spirit guide, allowed to make his peace with this life and then move on to the astral dimension where imagination and creativity reign.  As we find out, he's not very good at it at first.  Also, the view on personal hell is spot on in my book too.  Some of the more broad metaphysical assumption seem a little contrived, like the whole needing a guide to find someone, seemed a little forced, but it added to the plot a bit.

I'll give this film a four stars as I feel that it followed its own philosophy quite well and because I feel it to be good when alternative (pronounced, ""non-Christian"") views of the afterlife are made accessible to the public.  I'm still on the fence about giving it three due to the terrible acting and script, but the visual beauty of some scenes seals the deal at four.",1256860800,,2390,4.471131639722864
1039418,5,6305297525,"...that's the simplest that I can describe this film, which has become very dear to me.  It's a story about two people who find each other while on vacation and discover they are soulmates. They eventually marry and have children, and eventually lose those children to a tragic accident. Not exactly a spoiler here, as we fast-forward into the future about 10-13 years when the children are in junior high and high school. But when Chris, magnificently portrayed by Robin Williams, is killed in a tragic accident himself four years after that devastating accident, it leaves a shattered Annie (Annabella Sciorra) behind, all alone and fragile. In a nutshell, she attempts to find solace in suicide, but this act of desperation and despair leaves her forever inaccessible to her family and Heaven, or so one would think... And I'll leave it at that.
Don't look for religious overtones here, as some of the themes depicted may not coincide with your own views. Regardless, it is still a beautiful story; it was when Matheson wrote it, and it was given a new vibrancy with the motion picture.

However, What Dreams May Come is a tragedy that helped me center my understandings of true love.

Several friends recommended I view the movie, but I was relunctant to because of the heavy subject matter. I began the movie disgruntled that the tragedy occured so soon; I misperceived initially that it would be about this guy coping with his wife's unfortunate death.

Fortunately, I was wrong. Instead, the next hour and a half revealed the meat that could lay behind the terms ""soulmates"", ""destiny"", and ""linked hearts"" when the intimate connection between two people is true. I finished the movie with tear-stained cheeks, a half-smile, and the irreducible belief that there are spaces where true love persosts.

1039485,4,6305297525,"I will be perfectly honest ... with myself.
I am a huge fan of Robin Williams' work, and I found him sympathetic enough that I found a kind of chemistry between the characters of Christy and Annie that was deeper than on-screen sexual destiny.  I completely bought into the more mature and engaging chemistry of two people who have shared some of the most important, most wonderful, and most painful experiences life can offer.  Add to this that the actors who play the children are gifted in bringing us around to liking them and being concerned over what bothers them.  There are only two role left, well, one actually...but I don't want to ruin that little tweak.  Suffice it to say that I am ever impressed by Cuba Gooding, Jr's emotional range and depth and his remarkable ability to share his outstanding interpretation of his character with us, and as for Max Von Sydow?  Who else can be so charming, strong, fatherly, and somehow frightening all at once?  For many of us, he will ever be the iconic ""old priest"" -- Father Merin from a little movie that never quite gives up its hold on #1 on the list of scariest movies ever made.

So that's the technical stuff.  Now for the honesty.

It is possible that this film is emotionally manipulative, and I know some critics that denounce such exhibits of film making prowess as ""cheesy,"" ""predictable,"" and ""pushy.""  Twenty years ago, Robin starred in another emo machine called Dead Poets Society.  Again, critics who have not the talent to elicit more than cynicism panned the film because it succeeded in creating an emotional response.  Tell me Romeo & Juliet is anything but a calculated tear-jerker.  Shall we give Shakespeare one star?  So what's it all add up to?  Simply this honest statement:  I've not cried at a film like this since Dead Poets.  That film I cried at as a child beginning his first year of teaching.

1039540,4,6305297525,"The first reviewer has more than adequately written about the story of the film, and much better than I ever could.

First, let me say that I've always had a fndness for Robin Williams' films. OK, he's sometimes schmaltzy, but for a long time he was only given schmaltzy and/or cartoonish roles. What did anyone expect? People who are still biased against him might want to check out his later work.

Anyway. I recently tuned into this film out of idle curiosity, and found myself completely mesmerized by the highly saturated colors and pretty realistic visual effects used in the film. I have to say that color and visual texture are some of my favorite things in movies; watching a richly-shaded film like ""Girl With a Pearl Earring"" is, for me, to experience two hours of pure visceral delight.

I really didn't care too much about what the film had to say about the living and the dead. But I tend not to get my philosophies from movies.

A film critic once called the film ""Barry Lyndon"" ""a feast for the eyes, a famine for the mind."" And some may say the same of ""What Dreams May Come,"" which at least is not hobbled by the wretched excesses of Stanley Kubrick's self-indulgent direction. But all the same, beauty should be celebrated. Too little of it comes out of Hollywood these days.

The scriptwriters and director couldn't have done it without a deep understanding of the afterlife and the natural principle of reincarnation. Kudo to the editor for ""cutting"" the scenes with master precision, and going back and forth showing the emotional aspect of humans and the evolution of the souls.

Are we coming back to Earth to take conscious of the unconscious? Or are we going back to the ""5th dimension"" over & over again to re-evaluate our progress, as souls, and then make plans for the next reincarnation with our soul group? Could it be that the ultimate Divine plan is the reintegration of the souls with the Godhead?

Some people accumulate a lot of toys and a lot of money in their lifetime on Earth ...and then, they die!
If there is no afterlife, why are we humans fighting so much the tribulations of life itself? Could it be perhaps that we have a lesson to learn in this short lifespan? Jesus Himself was teaching reincarnation to His Apostles. The message of Jesus the Essene was fairly simple to the initiated and, unfortunately, so distorted by Churchianity. What a shame!
 Are some Christians so blind as not being able to read the ""Holy"" Bible? Or, are they too busy listening to the babbling of the Bible thumpers?

The children, as part of their soul group, also had some lessons to learn and teach. Albert is an old soul that reincarnated into the doctor's son, and Leona, another old soul, reincarnated as the daughter. (Projecting these two old souls with different skin colors was real genius)

Everything in the known and unknown Universe is ""vibration"" pulsating at different rate of speed from the essence of God (or whichever name you want to give Him). Chris through persistence, courage, and tremendous Love, reached out to another vibration to help his soul mate back into the right path.

1039559,5,6305297525,"What Dreams May Come is a great movie that touches on possible aspects of what may follow after death. It posits that there may indeed be a reality, however counter-intuitive, of life after death. This movie is based on the book writen in the 70s. Some may consider the book better than the movie, but as a person who has read the book too, I would not necessarily say that. I think the book is also very good, but at the same time I just think that the book and movie are just different ways of portraying the same subject. Some of the themes and elements are the same, even though the book goes into far more details on the subject.

I just think that the book and movie are both very good, but they are also very different. One is not necessarily better than the other, but the movie rendition of the book, while not an exact replica of the story therein, is a very good rendition. This movie won an Oscar, so that should tell all about how great this motion picture experience really is.

Robin Williams, Cuba Gooding Jr. and Max Von Sidow all do absolutely excellent acting jobs. The special effects are dazzling and tremendous! The concepts about life after death are also very thought provoking. In fact, these concepts are based on alledged facts that Richard Matheson himself uncovered doing research for his book. Even on the front piece of the book he mentions that the research on the subject of life after death in his story is solid and accurate, even though the story itself is fictional account that is woven around the theory of life after death.

For anyone with an open mind and/or has any concerns or interests in what may indeed be the fate of us all after death, I highly recommend this very telling tale. The story is sometimes shocking, sometimes happy and sometimes very sad. But overall I don't think anyone seeing this movie will be disappointed in it whatsoever. I think most people will be pleasantly surprised by the story and special effects and the intellectual stimulation they may get out of watching this film.

There are obvious religious arguements to be made in the absense of ""God"" in the afterlife, and after death having the abillity to continue to move our fate forward in the afterlife for a better end result. Anyway you slice it this movie will react with the viewer in a powerful way, and it will be different for everyboby. Example, I would feel much different viewing the loss of children perhaps if I wasn't a parent myself, and could agonize with the uncomprehensible loss of a child, for me events like that have impact. The loss of your own life in the middle of busy life events due to a split second tragedy, leaving those behind crazy for your loss...and the guilt you would feel if you could experience what your death did to the lives of the ones you leave behind. This film really is not supposed to be Heaven or Hell, just what momments of your own personal relationships and memories could best describe your own individual "" forever "" if you could take it all with you. I think Robin Williams and the whole cast is wonderful, viseral and heartbreaking and they will touch you and make you think, the artificial worlds they inhabit are nothing short of breathtaking. this movie is really an examination of the life of a couple and a family and where these lives end up forever when life on earth is done, and ultimately it's a wonderful conclusion.

1039564,4,6305297525,"Robin Williams in a serious role? Could work.
Robin Williams with an emotionally unstable wife? Ironic.
Robin Williams dies and goes through heaven and hell? Cinematic gold.

Robin Williams plays Chris Nielsen, a doctor devoted to his artist wife, Annie, played by Annabella Sciorra. They're a loving couple that have experienced the heartbreak of losing their children in a car wreck. But when Chris is killed in a car crash as well, he must learn to move on and accept his death. He watches over his widow for the first few days after having died. But then he is transported into a ""heaven"" which he manifests, a beautiful world of paint inspired by his wife's art. His former mentor played by Cuba Gooding, Jr., who is also dead but not what he appears to be, guides him as he creates his own reality. But when Annie commits suicide Chris must journey into a dark netherworld to save her. There she has created her own afterlife, a ""hell"" to match her despair and pain. Chris enlists the aid of a tracker, played by Max von Sydow who is also dead and yet again not what he appears to be, who will help him find Annie. Along the way Chris is reunited with his children and learns that only through faith and vulnerability can one become strong enough to heal.

The film is directed by Vincent Ward and is a startling example of spiritual and psychological storytelling, even if the screenplay is convoluted at times. The film is based upon&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/the-book-by-Richard-Matheson/dp/0765361183/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">the book by Richard Matheson</a>. Visually the film is absolutely breathtaking and gives us for the first time in centuries, a truly original idea of what life after death may look like. What hurts the film is the awkward way the story unfolds through flashbacks. Some films can handle a non-linear story but the editor fails to set up a proper chronology before assembling this epic picture. However viewers should not be deterred by this minor annoyance. It's still worth seeing... again and again.

The affordably priced DVD includes the following special features: audio commentary with Vincent Ward, alternate ending, two featurettes, photo gallery, cast & filmmakers' bios and filmographies, and dual interactive menus (one for Heaven and one for Hell).

1039565,1,6305297525,"If you want to know about Heaven and Hell, it's all in the Bible. God has already given us a glimpse of both and this movie isn't even close.

The main issue I have with this movie is that the message, theme and core story of the film are not original and created ideas of the author and script writers. The author didn't just sit down and think up the idea of God, the afterlife, Heaven and Hell and the ways to these places. God has provided us with all of this information in the Bible and most people know this. God tells us of these places and how anyone will enter into either domain. Apparently, the author disagrees with what God has told us and has taken the and descriptions of those places and twisted them into his own vision. Which makes this whole idea a blatant lie, contradiction and attack on God's word. The author and movie makers knew this and did it anyway. This is why I diagree with the whole concept of the story and film. This also makes reviewing the actors performances, cinematography, graphics, and music score moot.

In this movie, you can make your own Heaven, and God has no name as not to offend anyone (political correctness strikes again). He's portrayed as ""somewhere up there"", even in His own Kingdom. The name Jesus isn't even spoken, even though He sits at the right hand of the Father and is Lord, king and judge of all. I thank God that this idea of Heaven isn't even close to the real one. People just hang around or fly around and create their own customized heaven, nonsense. People are also exactly the same in this heaven as they are on earth. Theres pain, anger and swearing in this idea of heaven. You can even take God's name in vain there!!! I don't think so. God's Heaven is peace and joy for those who have called upon the name of Jesus Christ as Lord before death. In the movie, everyone is totally consumed with their own feelings for each other and there's no love for God which should be the greatest and strongest love of all. There's also the option of reincarnation, which is also not Biblical at all. Why would you ever want to come back here anyway after you were already in Heaven? The real Heaven that is, not this boring and self indugent one of the movie. The Bible also makes it clear that no one can cross over from Heaven to Hell or Hell to Heaven. This movie disreagards that too and makes that possible. God gave man dominion over the earth, but Heaven is His.

Which brings us to the other side, Hell. This movie also directly contradicts the Bible by saying, ""the real Hell is your life gone wrong"". No, the real Hell was made for the devil and his demons. Hell is also a place for those who've rejected Jesus Christ as Lord. God's word clearly states that there is only one unforgivable sin, and that is to blaspheme the Holy Spirit, which means to reject Jesus Christ as Lord and make God out to be a liar by denying the truth.  The movie also says, ""Hell isn't all fire and torment"". That's also wrong, God has already told us that it is. All of our senses are intact and there is searing heat, pain and knowledge of where you are and that you put yourself there by rejecting God's way of salvation through His Son Jesus Christ. The movie also allows for those in Hell to go to Heaven. Wrong. Judgement is final and eternal. God is in control. But the movie yet again wants man to be in control. The Hell in this movie is a total joy and paradise compared to the real Hell. In the real Hell, there is no moment of peace, even to sit and be depressed. No one returns and all is ultimate suffering and torment. But the worst of it all is being separated from God forever and knowing that you could have accepted the free offer of salvation through Jesus Christ.

This movie portrays secular society's false sense of hope that we're all basically good, without need of salvation and that as long as we don't kill anyone, we're all going to Heaven. It's just not true. We're all sinners, just the same and all in need of salvation. God doesn't send us to Hell, without Jesus, we're already on our way there. We're already condemned and sitting on death row. Jesus bore the sins of the world on His own shoulders so that we may forgiven and be freed from condemnation. We can be saved if we'll just accept what He did. Repent, call upon his name and ask Him into your life as Lord and Savior. You can know God now and His great and abounding love for you. Now is the time of salvation, life can end for anyone of us at anytime. Call upon the name of the Lord while He may be found.

Jesus said, ""Trust in God, trust also in me. In my Fathers house are many mansions, if it were not so, I would have told you. I am going to prepare a place for you. I will come back and take you with me that you also may be where I am. I am the way the truth and the life. No one comes to the father except through me"". (John 14:1-6)

Because God so loved the world, He sacrificed His only Son Jesus Christ, and all those who repent and call on the name of the Lord Jesus will be saved. God didn't send His Son into the world to condemn it but that the world through him may be saved. (John 3:16-17)",1209427200,5,5153,4.246687054026504

No mere love story in the conventional sense, it delves into the deepest of human despair, with a stunning performance by Annabella Sciorra, and just when you think you have shed more tears during this movie than all the other movies you've ever seen in your entire life put together, it reaches deep inside your psyche and pulls out the boldest, most heartwrenching understanding you've ever had about the POWER OF LOVE.

To be willing to go to the depths of 'hell' itself for your love, is the profound concept illustrated in What Dreams May Come. In addition, the concepts of creating our own reality, soul mates, and the nature of 'heaven' and 'hell' are explored in exquisite depth.

I can't say enough about the quality of this movie. No other movie (that I've ever seen anyway) has ever come close to its caliber. Oddly enough, this is one of those rare instances in which the movie was actually better than the book.

What Dreams May Come did take the Academy Award (1998) for Visual Effects.
You will see why in the first half hour of the movie and it only gets better.

Music: The late great Michal Kamen (April 15, 1948 - November 18, 2003)
did his usual fantastic job. His music is a perfect compliment to the acting and the visuals.

I can't help but be amused by all the Heaven/Hell comments. This story is not meant to be a serious comment on the nature of Heaven and Hell. The setting is purely a plot device - a way to deal tangibly with the ideas presented. The movie (and book) are not concerned with the feasibility of traveling from one literal afterworld to another; they are concerned with the worlds we create for ourselves in this life and the way in which we can rescue and be rescued by sacrificial love.

1039628,4,6305297525,"When I was 21, I moved to London, and lived in a flatshare where I didn't get on well with my flatmates, and didn't know anyone else.  So some nights after work, I'd go to the bookshop in WHSmith in Victoria train station and flick through the books...where I came across ""I Am Legend"" by Richard Matheson - it was so gripping that I read it standing there and then, in the bookshop before even buying it.  Later I sought out books by the same author, and though a completely different book in every way, the same thing happened with ""What Dreams May Come"" (one of the most moving books I've ever read - proved to me that I was more of a romatic than I'd admitted to myself, hehe)...

When I recently bought this film (some time later), I was in a somewhat emotionally fragile mood & seeking something uplifting and life affirming (& to restore my confidence in love and romance).
This film was certainly enjoyable, and Robin Williams plays the main character with heart...but the it just fell short of what I was expecting, and hoping for...

If you were to forgive the melted Velveeta look that this movie purports to be Heaven (cheesey indeed), and forgive Robin Williams (again) for trying so desperately to be liked in films such as this (the worst of the lot), you simply cannot overlook the injustice behind the storyline this movie asks us to buy.

Forget about the simplistic assumptions the movie delivers (such as DOGS belong in Heaven, but SPIDERS are all in Hell!), can we really believe that Robin's character sneaks into hell to rescue his wife, and that God is off cleaning his toilet and so misses this event? If meaning is tied to the REASON people are sent to certain afterlifes, then we can agree Robin's wife was in no fair way doomed to be sent to Hell. How can we feel good about afterlife justice if we buy into the fact that she has been sent there?

Logic, folks, prevents me from enjoying this film. I am happy to suspend reality in order to enjoy films, but when a wretched film like ""What Dreams May Come"" dares to discuss afterlife in the sense that it does, it leaves you feeling bitter. Does anyone believe that Robin's wife is the ONLY one in Hell to suffer this kind of injustice? What about the innumerable others that suffered similiar fates, only to be left there because no Robin will come about to save them? The ideas behind this film sicken me, and it is among the worst movie I have ever had the misfortune of being subjected to.",1197244800,,1445,4.486692015209125
1039660,2,6305297525,"If you're looking for a movie to show off your new hd-tv, this is probably a great choice, especially if you want to turn off your brain and just gawk at the pretty colors. If you're the type of person who is impressed with the likes of ""The Celestine Prophecy"" you'll probably love this. Unfortunately, if you're a cinemaphile who wants something like a plot, witty dialogue, and all the other trimmings of a ""great"" film, you'd best look elsewhere.

WDMC was very uneven, with the first 45 minutes or so crawling by, and the last act a hurried rush. I quickly lost interest in the film for the first half, as the admittedly impressive visuals became sensory overload and actually wore out their welcome. I was keenly aware that the ""story"" was bare-bones, and suspected that this was just a vehicle to show off ILM's latest advances. What passes for ""plot conflict"" was introduced way too late, and was resolved too quickly, and too unsatisfactorly: we get the ""happy Hollywood schlock ending"" where everything works out for the best, but I was at a loss to figure out just HOW that happened. Maybe the book gets into it better, but the happy ending was jarringly forced with no discernable explanation, and actually struck me as the result of test screening polls where the audience wanted everything to end just peachy.

The ""plot"" is gause-thin, and since I minored in Theology, I almost immediately recognized it as an unambitious lifting of Emanuel Swedenborg's theory that ""the afterlife is what you make of it"" -- with a few variations thrown in to force a plot conflict.

I haven't read the book, so I can't compare/contrast the film to that -- a few reviews said the book is better, or at least fleshes out the movie. I defer to them on that, but based on the movie itself, have absolutely no desire to track down a copy.

Although I'm sure this final comment will draw the ire of this film's proponents, I honestly see this film appealing to only two types of people: drug users looking for something pretty to stare at, and New Age-types wanting a feel good/""I'm secure"" type of film.

The movie is visually pleasant, full of vibrant colors and beautiful images.  At times, the settings look nearly identical to Kincaid paintings.  While nice, it gets to be a bit too much to watch.

*Acting*
Robin Williams parrots every ""serious"" role he's ever played.  Annabella Sciorra is incredible (meaning lacking credibility) as a grieving mother and wife.  Sure, she does a great job of being ""depressed"" but there's something robotic about her grief.

*Script and Dialog*
One word: campy.

*Spiritual matters*
The skeleton for the plot is, more or less, a traditional Christian understanding of heaven and hell. Superimposed over top of that are beliefs of all sorts of other faiths and philosophies.  The result: heaven and ell that are completely defined by each individual inhabitant, a heaven and hell of the mind.  Heaven is escapable through reincarnation and hell through believing in one's self or forgiving one's self.  If it were only that easy, would there be a hell at all?

1039753,5,6305297525,"There's an author by the name of Richard Matheson, who's better known for his horror fiction (I Am Legend and Hell House) and the teleplays that he wrote for the original Twilight Zone series in the sixties (the most famous being Nightmare at 30,000 Feet).  This is the man who had the greatest influence on Stephen King when he was a teenager and an aspiring writer.  What many people don't know is that Richard Matheson also wrote two very powerful novels about undying love and soul mates, both of which were turned into successful movies--Somewhere In Time in 1980 and What Dreams May Come in 1998.  This posting is about What Dreams May Come.

What Dreams May Come was written by Richard Matheson as a way of saying a big ""thank you"" to his wonderful wife.  He wanted to write a book that would show his love for her in a very special way.  When the novel was originally published, one of the producers of Somewhere In Time read it and decided that he would eventually turn the book into a movie.  This finally came about in 1998.  The movie, What Dreams May Come, starred Robin Williams as Chris Nielsen and Annabella Sciorra as his wife, Annie.  The story is a sad one; yet, it does have a positive ending.  More importantly, it has a strong message about life after death and how we choose to come into this life to be with the people we love and need to learn from.  In a sense, this is the unique power of love.  When you truly love someone, the energy of that emotion never goes away, no matter how many years or centuries may pass.  Love is eternal.

The story of What Dreams May Come (there are plot spoilers here, so beware) deals with a middle-aged couple that has lost their two children due to a traffic accident.  They have struggled to rebuild their lives and to carry on their journey together.  But, another traffic accident takes Chris's life, and Annie is left alone to deal with her guilt and heartache and emptiness.  As Chris's spirit gradually accepts his death, he moves into the after life, or to a very special place that's built on happy memories from his previous life.  You could say that it's the place where dreams are born.  He meets the man who helped trained him to be a doctor and is guided by him in an effort to readjust to this new state of being.  Eventually Chris will encounter his two children, whose memories have never left his heart.  In time, however, he finds out that Annie has committed suicide.  She found herself unable to go on without him.  Because of her belief system and because her death is a suicide, Annie's spirit ends up in what might be referred to as hell.  Chris refuses to accept that he may never see Annie again and decides to go after her.  Though no spirit has ever done this before, Chris is determined to make the journey to hell and to bring his wife back.  This is the strength of his love for her.  If he can't bring Annie back, then he'll stay in hell with her for the rest of his existence.

Needless to say, you need a big box of Kleenexes when you watch What Dreams May Come.  This movie has a number of poignant moments about true love and death and the people who are interconnected to us.  The photography and special effects are awesome.  The movie makes you believe in life after death, and that it can be the most beautiful place that one's mind can imagine.  I think this is one of the reasons the film had such a powerful affect upon me.  When I saw it at the movie theater in 1998, I continued to sit there for at least ten minutes after the end credits had rolled.  I wasn't the only one, either.  That night, I went to see it again with some friends, and we all seemed to experience the same kind of sensation when the movie ended.  It touched something deep within us that was desperately needed.  I think that as human beings, we need these very special experiences every so often in order to keep us moving through the ups and downs of life.  Without these moments in time that touch our hearts and souls, we would simply be moving forward as if on autopilot.  There's about twenty-five minutes of extras on this DVD that deal with the making of the movie.  Highly recommended!",1168214400,5,4173,4.396866840731071

1039795,4,6305297525,"""What Dreams May Come"" is based on a novel by Richard Matheson ('A Stir of Echoes'), stars Robin Williams ('Good Will Hunting'), and won the 1998 Academy Award for Best Visual Effects. That's a well deserved Oscar, because this film has some of the most beautiful visual effects and art direction I've ever seen put on screen before. Williams plays Chris Nielson who tells us how he met the love of his life, Annie (Annabella Sciorra, 'The Hand That Rocks the Cradle'). Chris and Annie get married and have two children...But their world is rocked when the two children die in a car accident. They return to their normal life, for the most part, but then Chris dies in a car accident leaving Annie alone. With a man named Albert (Cuba Gooding Jr.) to guide him, Chris begins to explore heaven which is of his own creation (he builds it from Annie's paintings); But then Annie commits suicide, which guarantees her eternal damnation in Hell. I know this sounds like a book/movie written by a religious fanatic, but this movie (and rightly so) doesn't even really touch down on the subject of religion. The movie, despite its beauty and wonderful performances, isn't a masterpiece. As far as visuals, it is for sure...But the story tends to drag and become dull. Williams and Sciorra hit all the right notes as the devastated couple and Gooding Jr. gives a joyous performance. Max Von Sydow ('Needful Things') is also great as The Tracker who helps lead Chris into Hell to find Annie. The movie's got a beautiful story and a wonderful (if not melancholy) ending, but it's more to be appreciated than enjoyed.

1039800,2,6305297525,"After reading the other reviews of this film, I wonder what chromosomes I am missing.  I truly disliked this film.  So, how could I be so off from the other reviewers?

Stories about Heaven and Hell are always going to get my attention.  It's refreshing and thought-provoking to witness the manifestation of one person's particular vision of the after-life.  This one portrays Heaven as a paint-gushing melange of impressionist imitation, splattered with a bucket of revisionist theology.  Hey, it's a hollywood movie, so you have to prepare yourself for a lot of that kind of thing.

That all said, the visualizations of Heaven and Hell are impressive and very unique.  There is more than a fair share of Dante Algieri in the Hell sequences (Max Von Sydow puts a surly spin on Virgil).  The film makers did a great job putting the author's literary concepts on to the screen.  From this standpoint, the film is robust and memorable.

Unfortunately, when the story departs from the paint and focuses on the actual characters, the whole thing comes to a stand-still.  Robin Williams is not compelling enough to carry his character.  Annabella Sciorra seems to be straining to make a connection with the somewhat limited Williams in this complicated relationship that has the tendency to drift into sappy sentimentalism.

Is this a good marriage?  Are they good parents?  Is Williams' character a good father?  It's not clear what is going on with this family.  I think the director let a lot of this back-story material slide into the background in order to focus more intensely on the visuals.  This was a mistake for me.  When all is said and done, the needs and motivations of the characters create the desire for the viewer to reach some point of closure or conclusion for the people they are trying to connect with in the film.  When the characters are muddled or ill-defined it's tough to care.

The last straw comes when we have to endure the ""Movie of the Week"" ending of this film.  the DVD offers two ending possibities.  After seeing the alternate ending you will be grateful that the director chose the ending he did.  Triteness prevails over all at the end of this laborious, obtuse film.

I would recommend you watch this film with the sound down.  Replace the dialogue with some Debussy or Sate instead.",1143849600,3,2317,4.8
1039801,3,6305297525,"Milton in Paradise Lost has Lucifer say that the mind can make a hell of heaven or a heaven of hell.  Apparently, someone decided to take that idea and run with it.

My biggest complaint was the depiction of the family.  This family was the driving force behind the movie: husband and wife, father and daughter, father and son, mother and daughter.  So, this needed to be a very good family.  And they constantly TELL us how much they love each other, but the only scenes we are SHOWN are ones in which they are fighting with each other, arguing with each other or just being neutral (the exception is the first meeting between the two leads).  According to studies in Sociology of the Family, one third of families are the fighting kind of family.  Apparently, the screenwriter thought that by portraying this kind of family, he was portraying a good family.  Unfortunately, the other two thirds won't be impressed.  So, for us the movie falls flat.

A word about the myth-metaphysic: it must take a megalomaniac to undertake the paint of picture of heaven and hell.  Personally, I didn't care for either as here portrayed.  Probably this is why Islam will prevail.  Islam doesn't footsy around with heavenly choirs or with paint, water and goo.  It cuts to the chase and promises everyone 53 virgins when they die.

1039802,5,6305297525,"The film is one of the few that I enjoy immensely under repeated  viewings. In very basic  terms, this is a romance, a love, persisting through time and space. Based on a 1978 Matheson book, it takes some liberties with the book's story line, but in the end it produces a great story. Whilst the FX is very heavy in the movie, it is a necessary addendum to the story. In fact, wonderfully so. As is noted in the commentary, both Williams  and Sciorra have worked together before, and it shows.
The chemistry they have, Robin Williams' intensity, especially  with the script comment ""It's not about understanding, its about NOT GIVING UP""; all in all this film is a rare work that illustrates the power of persistance, and the power of a love renowned for beauty.
The key extra is the commentary; the director provides some great insights into the film. And the feature which is short, covers some good points. I personally love the commentary comment that  says  ""I spent some time in Australia for my sins"". Tasmania excepted :-).

It's always odd to see couples who fight about going to the movies or not wanting to visit your in-laws(which I won't argue with), here's a film where you're literally willing to go to Hell and back for the one you love. It's the very idea of true love that's for once on screen and the hope of what happens when death literally does you part.

Chris meets Annie one day and the 2 become inseperable and get married. Years later they have 2 kids, which unfortunately are taken away from them in one day. Years later, celebrating an anniversary, Chris is also taken away. In the afterlife, he experiences everything spectacular your eyes can see, except one problem: due to grief and her suicide, Annie has to go to Hell. So Chris decides to go to Hell and bring her back.

Beating Mighty Joe Young and Armageddon in the Visual Effects Oscar race, the film definately looks beautiful and colorful, especially in the afterlife where it resembles freshly painted canvas. For me personally where it gets lost is when we go to Hell when there's several funky shots that look a bit too CG but for the most part it's a very lush looking film.

Acting wise it's very solid with Robin Williams finally showing he can be charming and likable without being manic and hyperactive(Robots, Aladdin anyone?) and Annabella Sciorra is great as the doomed wife. Oddly enough they don't have much chemistry which is odd, both are good performances but not enough chemistry. Everybody else is great including Cuba Gooding Jr as a kind of afterlife helper.

It's the kind of film where it's depressing and hopeful at the same time. The idea of killing off an entire family and one of them goes to Hell is quite sad but everything else gives us hope about where we'll end up when we ""shuffle off this mortal coil"". It's a rare film where there's enough religious and spiritual imagery and concepts without being kind of ""doesn't our way of life rule"" which I always hated about those kind of films. You can be thought provoking without being evangelists in disguise.

1039851,1,6305297525,"I had a hard time following the sub-plot of constant flashbacks.  However, if you watch this for theological insights, you will be misled.

Theological Mistakes:

#1. Hell is not about judgement.  If you believe that, how can you claim to be Christian?  Romans 5:12 ""Sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin.""  1 John 3:8 ""He who does what is sinful is of the devil, because the devil has been sinning from the beginning.""  But the good news is that Jesus died on the cross.  1 John 1:7 ""The blood of Jesus, his Son, purifies us from every sin.""  Galatians 3:13 ""Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us.""

#2. Where is God in this movie?  Christopher, the main character played by Robin Williams, says that he NEEDS his wife so he can be happy.  So, he doesn't God to be happy?  Heaven, in a matter of speaking, is the presence of God.  Cuba Gooding Jr.'s character thought that God's presence even in heaven is removed from the people in heaven.  God says in Psalm 16:11 ""You fill me with joy in your presence, with eternal pleasures at your right hand.""

#3 & 4 No one from heaven can rescue anyone in hell, plus no one going back to earth would do any better at convincing an unbeliever if that unbeliever does not accept Jesus without stuff like that.  Luke 16:22-31 ""The time came when the beggar died and the angels carried him to Abraham's side. The rich man also died and was buried. In hell, where he was in torment, he looked up and saw Abraham far away, with Lazarus by his side. So he called to him, 'Father Abraham, have pity on me and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, because I am in agony in this fire.'  ""But Abraham replied, 'Son, remember that in your lifetime you received your good things, while Lazarus received bad things, but now he is comforted here and you are in agony.  And besides all this, between us and you a great chasm has been fixed, so that those who want to go from here to you cannot, nor can anyone cross over from there to us.'  ""He answered, 'Then I beg you, father, send Lazarus to my father's house, for I have five brothers. Let him warn them, so that they will not also come to this place of torment.'  ""Abraham replied, 'They have Moses and the Prophets; let them listen to them.'  "" 'No, father Abraham,' he said, 'but if someone from the dead goes to them, they will repent.'  ""He said to him, 'If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets, they will not be convinced even if someone rises from the dead.' """,1133481600,10,2547,4.304621848739496

This movie was such a disappointment after about the first 45 minutes or so, especially when it got to the hell part. I even had to quit watching at that particular part because of boredom. I was also disappointed because of Robin Williams' character giving up HEAVEN to be with his SUICIDAL wife. Now how lame is that???

1039904,3,6305297525,"I generally love most films featuring the fabulously funny Robin Williams. But it's even better when he does a more serious role, a step away from what he's normally known for. (See also One Hour Photo.) This film is the kinda film I don't think most people would be interested in, but it's worth a look, just to see the interpretations of Heaven & Hell. And a fabulously moving performance by Annabella Sciorra.

What I didn't like about this film was the interpretation of Heaven. But each to their own I suppose. Everyone makes their 'own' Heaven apparently, and Chris (Robin Williams) ends up 'living' in his wife's paintings. What's cool is that if she adds to the painting, he sees it too. If she removes it, he sees that as well.

It's a hard time for Annabella Sciorra's character, she loses her two children, and then four years later, loses her husband. (And how on earth did they make Robin's character look so YOUNG in some of the flashback scenes?! He looked similar to how he did in his Mork & Mindy days.) She ends up committing suicide, but suicides don't realise what they've done, and go to Hell. (She also looks much younger than she did in The Hand That Rocks The Cradle, and has managed to find a good hairstylist, and makeup artist.)

I much preferred the interpretation of Hell to Heaven for some strange reason. It wasn't stereotyped, like other films, with lots of flames, and a big red devil with a big red fork thing. It was very dark & just so different.

You can really feel the chemistry between Annabella & Robin, their love for each other in the film is portrayed so strongly. It is the one film where true love lasts beyond life, and into the next. It almost makes you believe in it.

It would be interesting to read a review from a person who doesn't believe in Heaven or Hell I think. I believe in one, but not the other. Kind of. But I'm just so grateful to the director for not doing a stereotypical view of Hell, as I thought it would have happened.

1039905,4,6305297525,"This movie contains a profound but slightly inaccurate message about life after death and reincarnation. For example, this movie talks about everlasting hell for souls who commit suicide. But this message is inaccurate to say the least.

(This is a profound statement with very deep implications) However the philosophical view on reincarnation in this film is fairly accurate.

Forgetting the message in this film, this picture is one of the most sentimental movies of all time. The director's view on soul mates is very accurate and gives hope to millions of lovers everywhere. Death is simply not the end of our existence; when death arrives, we simply change form and this message is very reassuring to the millions of souls who fear death. Robin's acting is top class and I am surprised that he did not win an Oscar for this movie.

1039908,1,6305297525,"This movie paints a depressing picture of the afterlife.  It's very new age-ish.  It's theme is that Heaven or Hell is created in our own minds and circumstances.  I feel that the story itself is so unbelievable that it's hard to really ""buy"" what's going on.  For example, Robin Williams is in Heaven.  Okay, but, he is unhappy!  That right there is a problem.  For those that make it to Heaven, there are no more tears, no more sadness.  Here it's no different than here on Earth.  And, Hell is depicted as people under water, lost in a sea of turmoil, loneliness.  Hell is about the unquenchable fire tormenting people day and night!!!  Now, Robin Williams' ability to leave Heaven and go to Hell was so dumb.  I mean, if that was the case, people from Hell could traverse to Heaven.  So, if this is the case why do these two places exist?  To me this movie doesn't depict a comforting representation of Heaven or a terrible, horrifying Hell.  The story, is simple.  Robin goes to Heaven, his wife goes to Hell because of a suicide and he makes his way to Hell to get her and bring her back.  In the end, she ends up with him in Heaven with there son and a dog and a representation of their house and they both live, well, happily ever-after.  I am very, very skeptical of movies that depict places like Heaven and Hell.  There are no movies that have faithfully come close.  Is it visually stunning?  It's okay, the graphics and such are okay, nothing ""breathtaking"".  Is it believable?  Certainly not.  Would I recommend it?  Definitely not.  It will only confuse you.  If you want a story about how a man's love for his wife makes him got to the extremes, find another movie.  If you want a movie that represents Heaven and Hell, stay away from this movie because it'll only confuse and depress you.  If you want to learn about Heaven and Hell, read the Bible.

1039910,3,6305297525,"This is a typical Robin Williams film, sentimental to the extreme which is fine if that's what you are expecting. If you are expecting a true rendition of Richard Matheson's book then forget it. The only similarity to the book is that Chris Nielsen, the main character, dies and discovers there is life after death. From thereon in the story differs wildly. The book focuses more on Chris's voyage of discovery in the afterlife and on his being drawn to his wife whose grieving is preventing him from fully letting go of his earthly life. The film sees the poor woman left grieving for not only Chris, but her two children who have been killed in a car crash.

All that aside, is this a good film? It depends on your expectations. The effects are excellent and the colour rendition of `heaven' is truly amazing if somewhat Dali like in its surrealism. Heaven is portrayed a place from a renaissance painting. Hell is shown as a dark and despairing place, pretty much as you would expect but again filmed with flair and a brilliant eye for detail. Chris's guide through the afterlife is played, with style, by Cuba Gooding Junior. Visually this film is a feast but the storyline will leave most viewers depressed and drained. It isn't a comfortable movie to watch. Unlike the book which, although very sad at times, portrays a more positive note, the movie leaves you with a feeling of  desperation that so much tragedy could happen to one family.

It is probably worth viewing this film at least once as long as you are not depressed at the time...just keep tissues by your side. It isn't a movie you would want to watch time and time again.",1129248000,5,1641,4.593856655290103

The concept of the script as a whole is also fantastic: the struggle of a husband to recuperate his wife who committed suicide, after he finally ""runs"" into his (also) dead children in heaven.

It does have a nice message and a happy ending; but it misses many of the points put forth so well in the book that could have found their way into the movie. The technology was there in the late nineties, it could have been done, yet a bizarre painting motif was chosen.

Uh-oh...another jerk who says the book was better than the movie. I know, I know... but when a storyline that worked so well on paper is changed so radically to please a mass audience that the director or producers felt couldn't understand...well, to say I was disappointed is an understatement. Many times during the course of the movie I found myself thinking, What? No, no, no; that's not how it happened! Uh! You're missing the point!

Yep, I read Richard Matheson's ""What Dreams May Come"" prior to seeing the movie. If you haven't read the book, it is an extraordinary piece of work worthy of your time. And I know you'll always have a group of people that says the book was better than the movie. But when the movie strays so far from the actual story, it becomes problematic.

While Matheson wove many abstract ideas through his story line, it still worked very well and helped me grasp the metaphysical ideas he was putting forth. I has certainly changed the way I view life and death: why we're here, where we've been, and where we're going. I have no problem recommending this book to anyone.

After enjoying the book so much, I really looked forward to seeing how it translated to film.

I was soundly disappointed. Not only did the characters change radically (the Neilson children die? Albert is Chris's son? Ann's a painter?), but several of the main principles were ignored (i.e suicides are condemned...forever?). To me it seemed as if the screenplay writers were saying, Film audiences aren't sophisticated enough to understand the book; let's dumb it down a bit and slap a happy ending on it.

That's too bad. Film audiences not only missed some really interesting theological and metaphysical ideas, they also missed out an a darn good storyline.

Was the message the same? Yes. The basic premise was there: heaven is a state of mind that continues after you pass on. But the similarities end there. And what was with the jabs at the Psychiatric profession?

I honestly think Robin Williams and Annabella Sciorra were good choices; they're great actors, but they were given a very weak screenplay to work with. Had they just gone ""by the book,"" they could have done just fine. Unfortunately, they came off as pale imitations of Matson's Chris and Ann.

It's about what it takes in a person to surmount tragedy, to take it in fully, to surmount it, to build more of a life even in the presence of that tragedy, and to continue even in the enveloping fact of death. And yadda yadda yadda.

I like this movie, but all that chick-lit surmounting stuff doesn't do it for me. What does is good visuals, and this movie has never been equalled. Turn off the sound if you want, just drink in this magnificent achievement for the eyes. That first sight of heaven is all about juicy, wet paint. Hell is not just a church inverted, it's a gray place. Red fabric, billowing in the wind carries another message, though I'm not sure what. Blue shirts most often carry a message, too - again, I'm not sure what.

In the larger sense, this movie is about Life (but I disagree with it). It's about Death (and I disagree again), then it's about more life (and I still disagree). Well, that doesn't matter much.

It's OK to like this movie for its tear-jerking side. It's better to like this for the stereotypes that it breaks, or that it uses in unique ways. It's best to sit back and let a unique visual experience open up in front of you.

1040017,4,6305297525,"When I first saw this film in 1998, I was horrified because it was so different from the novel I had just read.  I wanted to see a film more faithful to the novel and the beauty and awe I felt when I read it.  This is not that movie.

I decided to watch this film again on its own merits.  I haven't read the novel for years, so I'm able to see this film with fresh eyes, and judge it on its own merits.  Its not the novel, and maybe someday there will be a film that is a closer representation of the novel, but this film presents the director's vision and still provides excellent insights into the afterlife.  For that, its worth watching and owning.

This film is visually stunning as they recreated a world as one might expect if a person lived in a painting, or a place that resembled a painting.  Having seen some actual works by Renoir, I know the feeling of being transported into another realm on the basis of a painting.  This film does it perfectly.  The symbology and recurring patterns (sailboats, for example) work exceptionally well.

The biggest changes made from the novel is that this film is about a family's connection in life and the afterlife, and the focus is on the relationships between husband and wife, father and son, and father and daughter.  Robin Williams plays Chris Nielson, who meets his soulmate in Italy, and they marry and have two children, who die in a tragic car accident.  The wife, played by the exceptional Annabella Sciorra, is institutionalized after the tragedy, and does get better...until her husband also dies in a freak accident.  He finds himself in heaven and she's left to grieve alone, which is a burden too heavy for her to overcome.  In heaven, Chris meets a few people who explain how the afterlife works (and its so much better in the novel) and then he's hit with the news that his wife had killed herself and was now in a hell of her own creation.  He decides to brave the dangers of hell (because one can lose one's mind being surrounded by tormented souls and the thoughts they carry) to rescue her.  This is a story of a love so deep, that a man is willing to give up heaven to be with the woman he loves in her self created hell.  Amazing!

This dvd also includes the original ending, and while it was more faithful to the novel (and one I would've preferred), I also know why they changed it to the ""cutesy ending"" we see.  Unfortunately, it downplays the way reincarnation supposedly works (the original ending was more realistic) and presents it as some adorable, Americanized version of reincarnation...which is more fantasy than reality.  However, imperfect this film is, I give it four stars because of the importance of such a film in bringing any vision of the afterlife to public consciousness.  There are not enough films like this being made and I'm one who would love to see more films about heaven and the afterlife (besides ""Defending Your Life"", ""Ghost"", ""The Sixth Sense"", ""Chances Are"", ""Made in Heaven"" to name a few).  This is one of the better ones out there...but the novel is so much better.  If you haven't seen this film or read the novel, I recommend seeing the film first then reading the novel.  If you do it the other way, you run the risk like me...of having such a beautiful vision in your head and being disappointed that the film is nothing like your vision.  This film deserves to be seen on its own merits.

Michael Kamen's score is also lush and wonderful.  The movie, however, is definitely a mixed bag.  Starting off with enough tragedy to induce suicidal tendencies, WHAT DREAMS MAY COME offers us a view of the afterlife; it does reaffirm the power of love, but it also whitewashes the suicide issue, and its reincarnation ending is just too over the top for my personal tastes.  I also think the casting of Cuba Gooding Jr. was a big mistake; when we find out who he is, it's hard to really believe it.  Robin Williams is certainly more subdued than usual, but I couldn't help feeling his performance was more of a ""hey look at the comic actor playing a dramatic role.""  Annabella Sciorra fares much better, showing us the descent of her character and her ""redemption.""  Max von Sydow's role could have been played by any numerous character actors, but his presence also lends a sort of legitimacy to the movie.

Yes, visually it is fantastic, it is facinating and ""dreamy"" to watch (and becomes this way anything but boring) but the story however -well, the image of the life after death becomes chaos, the theory on hell (I realize this is no ""religious""-movie, just imagination vaguely based on the faith in God) -but here in the afterlife everything is just as confusing as it is in the life on earth. The story offers no beliavable ""attempts"" of giving any answers, even in ""Heaven"" there is pain -and frustrations. The topic is real love. But real love does not save the couple (or the family) What Dreams May Come introduce us to. And frankly, the drama is nearly embarrassing -tragic after tragic, too much. And the ending, isn't ""Heaven"" a place worth staying? ""No, let's do it all again -life after all was so fantastic!""

Silly story, fantastic picture! Recommended!",1110672000,2,965,4.95679012345679
1040020,5,6305297525,"Few comic actors have the versatility as Robin Williams--perhaps Jim Carrey--but ""What Dreams May Come,"" is the purest example of his soft side to date (Okay, ""Patch Adams"" comes close, but it's somewhat sappy in spots).

  What possesed director Ward to turn an American Golden-Age novel into a breathtaking motion picture must've been divine; every aspect of the movie leaves the viewer in awe, from the opening to the closing credits.

  ""Dreams"" begins in flashback, where we see two strangers (Willams and Sciorra) vacationing in the Swiss Alps bump schooners, and find thier lifetime partners.

 From there we move to thier family, living in NYC--complete with heart-sick 11-year-old daughter (her pet labrador dies), and emotionally-torn son, who's difficulty at school causes Williams to withdraw him into home-schooling. Then, on a mild spring morning, an auto accident kills both son and daughter. Subsequently, Williams is killed in a freak car pile-up incident, and finds himself in heaven, with Gooding, Jr. and Chao as his angelic guides.

He must save his painter/wife from the twisted (but--along with paradise--technically stunning piece of movie magic) hell that she has created in her suicide.

  Ward's direction throughout all, surpasses even that of James Caneron's, even if for only ""Dreams."" One cannot watch this heartfelt film enough times, trust me. Williams' computer-riden paradise (actually his favorite painting by his wife, of the spot of thier first meeting) is a big highlight, but the entire film is a rollercoaster through an abstract heaven and hell that's truly unforgettable.

  Probably one of ""Dream""'s most underappreciated facets is it's score, provided by master Michael Kamen, and adapted from a tune by the little-known innovational band Sigura Rose. It is Kamen's glorious thematic scoring that brings the truest vibrance to the love story and characters of ""What Dreams May Come.""

Finally, the supporting cast provides stellar performances (look for Von Syndow as a reincarnated ex-colleague of Willams' character), even the children. ""Dream""'s reuniting ending, I have to say is probably the reason this film brings me to flat-out bawling-like-a-baby, every time I see it. Do not pass this masterpeice up, it's worth it.

1040080,4,6305297525,"The best parts of this film are the excellent visual effects and the superb art direction.  The story is actually quite somber with death and the effect of sin on the afterlife being major, heavy themes.  The finest acting performance here comes from Annabella Sciorra, who survives the deaths of her two children with the help of her husband (played by a subdued Robin Williams), only to lose her husband a few years later.  That's when the story takes off.  Robin William's character, like all who enter the afterlife as good people, creates his own Heaven from his past experiences.  In his case, he was a huge fan of painting, and his painted Heaven is a one-of-a-kind visual effects creation.  After he becomes accustomed to his afterlife he is told that his wife commited suicide and will not be joining him in his Heaven, ever.  But True Love knows no bounds, and he obtains a tracker and eventually journeys into the circles of Hell (Dante-style, frequently reminiscent of the epic poem ""Infernus"") to find his beloved.  The realms in which this sojourn takes him are truly frightening and have many distrubing images.  While the ending is a little too schmaltzy for my tastes (even the alternate ending on the DVD has a similar feel to it), it is the type of ending the audience wants and deserves.  I just think they lay it on the viewer too thickly.  Robin Williams tries hard here and is more often good than not, but he ultimately feels miscast in this role.  Annabella Sciorra's performance more than makes up for Robin Williams being, well, 'himself' too often.  But the two leads do have some good chemistry together.  That, and the sublime special effects mixed with some spectacular set designs make this film work.  The DVD features are also enlightening and worth seeing.

1040081,4,6305297525,"Robin Williams and Annabella Sciorra star in this moving film about the depths of true love and the lengths one will go to to stay with their loved one.  Williams stars as Chris, a neurologist, and Sciorra stars as Annie, an artist.  They have a perfect life with two wondefrul children until the unthinkable happens and the children are killed in a tragic car accident.  Four years later, Annie and Chris have just begun to heal their wounds when, unfortunately, tragedy strikes again.  On a rain-slicked highway, there is a terrible car accident.  Chris stops his car and sees if he can help one of the victims when he is hit and killed by another car.

After his death, Chris is met by a messenger named Albert, played by Cuba Gooding Jr., who takes Chris to his own personal afterlife, which contains images from Annie's art, right down to their dreamhouse which they planned to build some day.

Meanwhile, Annie, who has suffered through the loss of her children and now her husband, ends up taking her own life.  Due to her suicide, she is condemned to hell.  Chris, with the help of Albert, traverse heaven and hell to save Annie from an eternity of despair and trepidation.

I found this to be a very uplifting movie.  Williams is excellent as Chris, and Sciorra's performance as Annie is very powerful.  I enjoyed watching the transformation of both Chris and Annie throughout the film.  At the beginning, Chris was somewhat shy and reserved, but by the end, he had become much more courageous and not afraid to fight for what he wanted.  Meeanwhile, Annie went from a very happy person to a somewhat hardened person due to the loss of her children and husband.  Cuba Gooding Jr. and Max Von Sydow give excellent supporting performances.

I highly recommend this movie.  The acting is first rate and the message is very powerful; love knows no bounds, not even death.  Watch and enjoy a great uplifting experience.",1106006400,3,1923,4.706586826347305

His acting in this movie is superb, and even believable, even though it's totally unbelievable. Which makes it even better. What's also great about this movie is that anyone who has had a soul mate, maybe to the point of obsession, can appreciate this movie. It's a desire to keep your love, even if it means crossing over Hell to do it.

The film was moving, and I look forward to watching it again and checking out the DVD so many have mentioned.  The extremes in ratings were entertaining to read.  It was interesting to read the references to CS Lewis, Monteverdi's Orfeo, and William Blake's Marriage of Heaven and Hell.  What nobody has mentioned is that the heaven and hell scenes are based on Emmanuel Swedenborg's visions in his book, Heaven and Hell.  A Swedish genius in the 1700's, Swedenborg is a mystic and understands the dynamics of living systems, having first been a mechanical engineering genius, before developing his unusual and fascinating theology.  Blake was one of the signers of the charter for the first Swedenborg Church in London, by the way, and Swedenborg influenced Wordsworth, Yeats, John Muir, Emerson, Thoreau, Helen Keller, Mary Baker Eddy, Carl Jung, and others.

The movie could have been a bit better with a slightly different cast, most noticeably either another actress as Robin William's great love Annie, or Robin himself replaced by someone else. Acting isn't quite Oscar-worthy but convincing enough.

Lo and behold, 15 years later they did. I couldn't wait to see. When I did I was extremely disappointed. I hated that the screenwriters felt the need to change the original story line so much, because I did not see the need to change so lovely and magical a story line. For me, that completely ruined the movie. If I had not read the book first I would have probably enjoyed it more. If I were Mr. Matheson, I would have felt violated by all the changes, which in the movie, turned out to be contrived, cheesy and predictable.

1040089,4,6305297525,"There are surprisingly few movies dealing with a nonterrestrial afterlife.  While there are hundreds of films dealing with the existence of individuals following death as embodied or disembodied spirits on earth, there are remarkably few that provide any glimpse of heaven.  The few that do tend to present it as an inconceivably white, vast, and indistinct place, from HERE COMES MR. JORDAN to A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH to THE HORN BLOWS AT MIDNIGHT.  In contrast to these other films, WHAT DREAMS MAY COME stands out as one of the most intensely colorful, beautiful, and vividly concrete films in cinema history.
The cast of the film is strong, but it would be a mistake to imagine that they are the reason for the film's success.  Robin Williams as Chris Nielsen, Cuba Gooding Jr., Rosalind Chao (who I previously mainly knew only from STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION), Max von Sydow, and the lovely but underused (not only in this film, but by Hollywood in general) Annabella Sciorra all hand in wonderful performances, but they are largely overwhelmed by the astonishing beauty of the sets, the inconceivably vivid colors, and the marvelous use of light.  No performers could have competed, though they try gamely.
I find the film especially interesting for theological reasons.  Ron Bass based the screenplay on a novel by Richard Mattheson.  I must confess to not knowing the work of either, but I would lay heavy money that one of them (probably Mattheson) knew well C. S. Lewis's THE GREAT DIVORCE.  In that work Lewis was concerned to lay out a concept of heaven and hell that did not regard God as responsible for sending people to hell.  Instead, he described an afterlife in which people in hell still had the option of leaving hell and departing for heaven.  These two ideas--of people placing themselves in hell and of having the option to leave hell for heaven--drive the metaphysics of WHAT DREAMS MAY COME, as I'm sure anyone who has seen the film will recognize.
So why do I give the film only four stars after all the nice things I have said about it?  Primarily because the film doesn't really have all that much of a story to tell.  The plot feels like a short subject stretched to feature length film proportions.  Once you subtract all the amazing visuals, there simply wasn't that much to the film.  The challenge for the filmmakers was primarily padding out the action of the film.  Nonetheless, I do recommend this as an interesting and intensely beautiful film, despite the slender narrative.
Interestingly, the title of the film comes from Hamlet's famous soliloquy, in which he ponders whether or not to commit suicide.  In the end, he decides not to because of the dreams that the dead may dream, presumably worse for having killed oneself.  But such dreams did not prevent Annie Nielsen in the film from committing suicide.  It is a nice ironical touch.",1089417600,18,2885,4.805668016194332

There have been many films that deal with the afterlife. However, I feel that What Dreams May Come did the best job illustrating the afterlife and what it can be like. The special effects are amazing in this film when it comes to showcasing Heaven and Hell. The overall story is extremely powerful because of Chris's determination to save his wife Annie. The film shows that the bond between soul mates is hard to break. This is also an extremely emotional film as well. I was bawling like a baby througout he film, and I rarely cry when watching a movie.

What's really important here is how the visual aspect of the film makes you feel.  The storyline is secondary, and for good reason.  It's hard to follow for one, what with the timeline jumping back and forth.  For another, it's a journey into the arena of faith and theology with barely a mention of God.  It's basically a hodgepodge of new age/reincarnation belief, psychobabble, and ultraromanticism.  I consider the storyline nothing more than a tool to explore the possibilities of modern technology in moviemaking.  In this regard this movie excels.  An incredibly vivid imagination and adventurist spirit on the part of those who created this movie brought it from a 20 year old script to the finished product - a cinematic impressionist masterpiece.  (Much of the artwork was actually taken from the works of Van Gogh and Monet.)

Don't get me wrong I laughed all the way through that movie, but know one said that this movie was suppose to be entertainment for someone that doesn't entertain easy.

1040198,4,6305297525,"I know ""What Dreams May Come"" is a constant punching bag for movie critics alike and it wasn't exactly a blockbuster smash for Robin Williams but I sincerely like this film. I first saw ""What Dreams May Come"" when it was in the movie theaters. It was total eye candy with the gorgeous colors and the art-like quality. I felt like I was watching an artist creating his art work. The premise of the film is a bit silly. Robin Williams's character Chris is killed in a freak accident, leaving his emotionally unstable wife Annie played by Annabella Sciorra devasted and alone. The viewer also finds out that their two children were killed earlier in a car accident so when Chris dies, Annabella is  completely consumed by grief and chooses that life is not worth living any more. Chris is sent to heaven which is basically a Monet painting. The bright vivid colors were stunning and made it a joy to watch. Cuba Gooding Jr. welcomes Chris into the after life and eventually helps Chris in his quest to find Annie. At the time, I enjoyed the storyline but as I was watching it tonight on tv, I never realized until now just how hokey the storyline and dialogue could be. Despite the hokiness of the film, I still enjoy watching ""What Dreams May Come"". I think my favorite scenes had to be when Chris literally went to purgatory. The images and colors were spectacular. Those scenes of people falling from the waves as well as from the air and exploding when hitting the ground was stunning to say the least. Those scenes were pure eye candy. ""What Dreams May Come"" is a good movie. It isn't nowhere as emotionally manipulative as ""Patch Adams"" was except maybe for a few scenes that involved the children. Otherwise ""What Dreams May Come"" is a good popcorn movie. It may not be Masterpiece Theater but I will take this movie over something as tripe as ""Patch Adams"" or overblown as ""Armaggedeon"" any day.",1077062400,,1900,4.588235294117647
1040199,5,6305297525,"While a world without tragedy may be desirable for us mortals, it is unfortunately not in our fate. Sometimes everyday people with normal lives are thrust into calamity. And sometimes that calamity is so devastating, our faith and happiness are quickly smeared into mud. If anyone can imagine their child dying in a gory accident, they still cannot imagine the internal agony that would follow. Now double that tragedy. Triple that tragedy, and you have the basis for a heart-gripping and believable tale. The character, Annie, understandably, cannot easily recover from her loss and withdraws psychologically. Her pain envelops her, and she commits suicide. As an artist, she was more prone to an emotional perception of her environment. While in good times her painting expressed her joy, it also controls the strokes of her brushes in bad times.

 The movie follows this dark course, but delivers a twist. It offers hope. While delivering the audience through a powerful action-filled experience into the afterlife, it is laced with an encryption of spiritual enlightenment. Tuning into Annie's mind, the liquid texture of an artist's palette becomes an underpainting to the visual renderings of the film. Chris's journey to rescue his soulmate Annie is a moving decline through graphic levels of hell that rival the images of the painter Bosch. As he struggles through fallen souls and wrecked landscapes, his appreciation of the gift of inner life becomes more apparent. He is finding himself, as he is searching for Annie.

 Although most traditional religious thought is unclear in their written doctrines on suicide, leaving the outcome of suicide victims open to mortal pessimists, this story offers a brighter take. In this new view, the audience is able to transcend the judgements of theorists, and discover an afterlife that is as mutable as oil colors on a plate of glass. A beautiful rendition. Only in discovering who we are, and why we are where we are, are we finally able to attain the heavenlike destiny that God has set aside for us.

 Perhaps in the real afterlife we are not saturated with doctrination and separated by denomination. Hopefully we humans are finally able to set aside our prejudices of religious zealism and ignorance that so separates us here.

Yet, I think that I would like it even if the camera work and effects were not so beautifully done. This is because I also find it the most thoughtful and mature film on the topic of the afterlife to ever come out of Hollywood.
The concept that we have to gradually overcome our preconceptions after death has the ring of truth to it. The metaphor of the art-loving Chris Nielsen seeing the afterlife as a great expressionistic canvas- until his guide rips through it to show him the next level is quite well done. This seeing beyond appearances and preconceptions to recognise our fellow beings as they really are is also quite profound. Personally, I enjoyed the fact that the deceased family dog seemed to be the only one that had no trouble adapting to his new surroundings.
Yet, this isn't a piece of new-age mind candy. Nielsen's wife's decent into despair after his death, followed by his epic quest into the depths of ""hell"" to rescue her, is positively mythological. I especially enjoyed Max Von Sydow as the the psychopomp guide (looking exactly like Carl Jung.)",1058659200,6,1217,4.745283018867925

It was never used so it wasn't ""polished"" but it is a wonderful spin.  I like it better than the original ending.  I won't spoil it for you but it is quite a bit longer than the ending actually used and fits better with the rest of the film.
The film itself is wonderful.  The bulk of the movie deals with the reality of perception (note, I did not say the perception of reality).  The only subject matter I have seen close to this was in Seth Speaks.  They skirt around God and the actual heaven so there should be no offense. The only reference to God is by Cuba Gooding who, when asked where God figures in on all this, answers to the effect that he's out there watching us.  Chris (Robin Williams) is in his own 'part' of heaven and Annie is in her own 'part' of hell.  The City of Gold can be seen in the distance but is never entered into.  No matter what your religion, you should not take offense (if you do, you are trying).

But when he's good, he's very good; ""Garp"", for example, was aa reasonably good film elevated by an above-average performance by Williams.
In this movie, Williams does occasionally slip into excessive bathos, but I'm willing to forgive him that, as the film is so beautiful overall. The story, as other have recounted, is one of love that lives beyond the grave- to hell and back, as it were. Most of the acting is very good, and dialogue, for the most part, is well written. The film does sometimes slip into what some may see as excessive sentimentalism, but this is a sentimental subject after all, and the film is really a fairy tale. It requires a certain assumption of innocence on the part of the viewer. Approach it that way, and you'l enjoy it.

1040268,4,6305297525,"As a complete film 'What Dreams May Come' fails to meet criteria that critics tend to expect. While the plot is pedestrian it still works on a visceral and metaphoric level. The dialog is frequently mundaine to manipulative, yet isn't that part of the movie going experience? Can't something be interesting without being profound?
For me the answer is yes, not every film needs to be profound. Sometimes I just want to be entertained and that can be in a number of ways. Another negative, the score detracts because it is so obvious, yet with all of these problems I sat through the film in awe and bought into the idea of a person's will to make things right. It's archetypal drama that dares to be positive in a time where ambigious and tragic films or mindless comedies that rely on shock value and often ugly humor seem to be all the rage.
The acting is very good, Robin Williams doesn't mug his way through the part as some have implied. Some backlash could be the 'nice guy' syndrome around his previous and even future films. If you identify with that issue you'll not enjoy what is a multifaceted performance.
Any film that can get me to suspend disbelief even in poorly scripted moments does something right and in this case there are several positives to mention.
The set design and lighting are dazzling. The realization of living your own reality is the films strongest suit because the design flawlessly creates the various worlds in What Dreams May Come.
Besides the great, oscar winning visual effects the casting is excellent with enough genuinely surprising moments to keep suspense while developing the slender plot. Cuba Gooding Jr. does great work as a guide in heaven or wherever you care to call it. As an actor he has learned to become whatever the character requires without overacting.
While a moody, even sombre film, What Dreams May Come is visually arresting with solid acting that makes a hackneyed Hollywood script emotionally satisfying and even gives you something to think about.
Although not a 5 star film, What Dreams May Come still satisfies in terms of entertainment. The DVD is as vibrant as the film and has interesting extras.",1041206400,2,2166,4.778666666666667

exteriors that were shot in Glacier National Park. I have had the privilege of seeing the park in person.

1040332,5,6305297525,"One of the most interesting things about this film is the place it has in the career of actor Robin Williams.  For those who maybe don't remember his television show and his early movies he was more or less strictly a comedic actor.  This movie goes so far beyond the type of work he was doing early in his career in terms of the meaning and topic that it is really pretty wild.  He has managed in this film to break so far out of the type cast situation he was in early on that it in and of itself is remarkable.
This is a film about heaven and hell and the nature of the afterlife.  This film while it does have some funny parts also has some very sad parts because you can only wonder what it would feel like to die and realize your wife who you loved more than any other has gone to hell.  Whats worse you are partly to blame and she is the only one missing from your family in heaven including as I recall the dog.
The portrayal of the afterlife is really pretty cool with heaven being a beautiful and fun place and hell being dark, ugly, and despairing.  Would you willfully reject heaven and descend into hell to save your spouse if you are separated in the afterlife?  That is a pretty hard question for people of faith given what is generally taught regarding the demons, pain, suffering, despair, and agonies associated with Satan.  It is this very what if situation that confronts Williams.
This is a fantastic tale for adults if you ask me but frankly its a little too deep and dark in places to be appropriate for younger members of the family.  If you watch it with kids be prepared to explain why the mommy went to hell for committing suicide in ending her life in despair.  If your kids are ready to deal with the serious questions regarding the afterlife then its really not a graphic violent depiction of hell but rather a nightmare come true depiction in which every essence of existence is dark, dirty, decayed, and destitute.  No one is on fire or picked on by evil beings in a physical sense it is psychological torture.
I really like this film because quite frankly I found it to be incredibly original in its concept and execution.  I can think of no other movie really like it except perhaps Jacobs Ladder but this takes a step beyond it in that Williams starts out in a really beautiful setting when he dies and then descends into the lake of fire to try to save his wife because his love for her is so strong.
Yes it is a metaphysical storyline and yet it is about love and making the ultimate sacrifice of ones eternal fate for the love of another.  Ill not tell you the end but I will say there are things that you may not expect.
I saw this on a rental but it is one of the select titles I myself will be buying for my library because it is something I could watch periodically with friends and family.  I recommend it to people of faith, of a spiritual persuasion, and for those who like stunning special effects because it is in my opinion a very special movie with an apocalyptic overtone of sorts (if you see it and are aware of it at any rate).

1040335,3,6305297525,"The movie plays out like an ode to Dante, finding Robin Williams reaching to the depths of hell to find his wife after she commits suicide.  A couple things really grabbed me about this movie.  One thing was Robin Williams performance and his growing depth as an actor.  In the beginning, before he dies, he is visibally a scarred, emotionally conflicted person because of his childrens' deaths.  He plays the character with such warmth and down to earth sadness that is almost unmatched.  It's clearly a result of award winning work on Good Will Hunting.
The second thing that grabbed was the undeniably beautiful visuals.  They almost play with the senses by showing us the beauty of heaven in what's probably the best description ever captured on screen.  Then, we're taken on a journey through hell.  It's unspeakably dark and unspeakably sad.  I was moved as Robin Williams went through the pit of all the condemned people and then as he confronted his wife.  The scenes are dar, emotional, and disturbing.
The movie's only deterrents I think come from the ending.  I wasn't really moved by the ending.  Two endings are offered on this disc and the one that they went with is the superior one while the alternate ending seemed to be too dramatic and too sad.  I guess from a theological perspective, however, the ending that was used didn't work for me.  You didn't know whether to feel happy or sad and you didn't feel that it was the right way for things to end.  It felt forced and a bit uninspired where the rest of the film was drenched in emotional energy.
Despite it's shortcomings, however, Robing Williams's performance, the amazing visuals, and depth of emotion create a pretty compelling and original piece of work.",1017014400,10,1731,4.761744966442953
1040336,5,6305297525,"I read the Book What Dreams May Come By Richard Matheson first, long before I saw the movie. The Book was very very good-I really liked it. But The reincarnation I had a hard time understanding-in the book, that is. The movie made it amazingly clear.
Then I saw the movie. It started out quite different from the book-Showing Chris and Annie's first meeting. I really liked this new beginning-it gave them a closer kind of feel.
When their two children died, I felt kind of like I wasn't sitting in my living room anymore-but like my mind was somwhere else-wondering where they had gone-what heaven is like.
When Chris gets to his own personal 'heaven' after his death, I found myself imagining my own personal paradise, one perfectly for me. I loved that feeling that you got throughout this whole movie-like as if you were saying ""What if that were me?""
Hell was much liked it had been in the book-utterly terrifying but amazing in its way.
But Annie's personal prison was far worse than any physical Hell-it was the mental hell, the one that we all know we have buried deep deep inside, and if we lived in it, like she would have had to, most of us would go completely and utterly insane-I know I would.
Robin Williams-he's just-he's just. You know. Just...Lets just put it this way-if I could act like that, I'd get a billion requests for movie scripts a year. There could never be another Chris-Robin IS Chris.
Cuba Gooding Jr. is very good as well. His role as Albert could not have been a better pick.
So when all is said and done, and the movie is over and you're sitting in the darkness, pondering what it was all trying to say, you wonder...wonder if maybe that beloved cat or dog you had as a child will come running and will knock you over and cover you with licks when you're dead and up in your heaven amoung the sky-maybe, just like Katie. And maybe, we'll keep our own heaven inside, just like our hell.",1016150400,7,1919,4.454545454545454
1040337,4,6305297525,"Sure, this is no Star Wars or Sound of Music, but the questionably overly-fantastic visuals are a necessary and fun way to convey a robust and intellectually intriguing view on the afterlife. I'm withholding a star for it's SciFi-Channel-esque seperation between audiance and characters. This movie was well placed for production style on the SciFi channel, but the content of the message and the effective portrayal of heaven, hell, and the unusual and fantastically beautiful bond between the characters was quite effective, if once in a while a little dry. For me, the moderate dryness of some of the near-monologue descriptive style of the script was made up for by the creativity of the message. While this might have been done better in a ""version 2"" with a more ""blockbuster"" attitude and a less ""pristine clean"" look we're seeing from the boomers trying to appeal to the Gen-Y's, I was positively thrilled to see someone writing down and acting out this version of the afterlife. For me the story of the characters' struggle was no more or less a tearjerker than the theological views being described. The theology alone makes the movie well worth watching. Robin Williams' brilliance shines in this venue, even though the combination threatens to be too lighthearted or a little too SciFi-Channel-shallow.

This very sweet story of transcendental love is well worth watching, but by doing so you will run the risk of positively adoring it!

I have a second perspective, however, which must be emphasized. The hair! This movie has some seriously top-of-the-line Bob Haircut content! Whoever chose and styled Annabella Sciorra's hair truly knows the beauty of the Bob, and in this case the Pageboy! (my apologies for not being able to give credit by name here) For appearance (and acting) this role couldn't have been better cast! If ever I were to recommend movies based on hairstyles to someone with an affinity for the Bob, this would be one of my top choices. Lots of Bob content, excellently done. If the story and theology themselves weren't enough, anyone wishing to add to the Bob Haircut movie collection could do far worse than to add this one to their library! If you liked Drop Dead Fred, Real Genius, The Professional, The Amateur, or anything with Louise Brooks because of the hair, add this one to your wish list ASAP!

The eye candy provided in the technique of oil-painting on film screen (newly developed for this movie) makes the film worth seeing by itself- it's one of the most beautiful sights I have ever seen in my life (on- or off-screen). The metaphysics is unfortunately all over the map and very off-target, but I don't recommend going to the movies for good theology. The movie does have some very inspiring messages about the need for hope; without which we die. I appreciated the perspective that hell is where people go when they no longer have hope- it made the best sense I had ever seen of the idea that suicides would go to hell. The basis of depression is a lack of hope, and lack of hope at it's basis is sin- in the sense of the original Hebrew, meaning ""to miss the mark"". God's best for us was to have hope- to trust, and to have, as the Greek defines the word, ""expectant Joy"". As expressed in What Dreams, suicide is the ultimate expression of a lack of hope- in essence one is choosing to not trust God, and choosing to not be in the place of hope, but the place of despair. If we are designed for hope, and choose to deny that, we have denied the basis of all reality. Annie chooses depression, and so her world becomes what she desires, and what she can handle- a world without hope. hell. Because of it's treatment of hope and despair, I would recommend that if you are feeling depressed, see this movie.

The story is not only off-putting and depressing,but incoherently told,with no structure or involvement. Needless to say as it meanders on towards the end,it starts to get incredibly boring,despite Williams,Annibela Scorria,Cuba Gooding Jr. and Max Von Sydow trying hard. But it's sloppily directed by Vincent Ward. When you see how reliant it becomes on special effects,you know you're in trouble. Wheras Patch Adams was actually a true story,which never tend to be as entertaining as fiction,it carefully timed the comedy and the serious drama moments,which resulted in something great. Here,it is consistently downbeat and overly sentimental,which results in a one dimensional ,thoroughly unappealling affair.

I've never seen anything quite like this movie.  It's courageous.  It takes on the subject of death in a way no other movie has attempted.  The movie has shades of Jacob's Ladder at times, and a bit of Dark City in it's approach.  But at the same time it's both sweet and romantic.

I'm a video editor by profession, and it takes a lot to make my jaw drop because I know how most of this stuff is done, and I was blown away.  But there's a depth here that goes beyond visuals.

I would have thought the ending more interesting if Ward had ended with Chris (Robin Williams) giving up his chance at eternity in heaven to spend eternity in hell with Alicia (Annabella Sciora), but I think someone thought it would be a harder sell at the box office.  Cuba Gooding, Jr. and Max Von Sydow shine.  The alternate ending on this film (provided on the DVD) was even stranger.  It gives a nod to 2001: A Space Odyssey.  If you're willing to watch an epic vision about the subject of death, buy this one.  I place it in my top 20 films of all time.",1003017600,7,1574,4.296928327645051

In having attempted this, the movie earns points for being somewhat groundbreaking.
Robin Williams is his predictable boundless self, and drives the movie well.  Annabella Sciorra is strained in the role as his wife.  Moreover, the two lack any intensity in chemistry - as a result, the 'love for eternity' theme of the movie seems more concept than reality.

Yet for all its nauseating flaws, the movie's got a few killer scenes that are both visually stunning AND thought provoking to boot! This alone is so extremely rare in these last days of the decline of Western civilisation, that it is worth catching. For me, it was a poignant expression of Sartre's immortal insight that 'Hell is other people'. Indeed. And heaven is a garden of eden with perhaps just one or two other people. Yet another symptom of the building population explosion anxiety, where humans increasingly detest each other merely because there are so many of them who are just like us!!!",998697600,,853,4.8493150684931505

Robin Williams is quite possibly the greatest actor to ever walk the earth.  He's primarily known as a comedian (and a great one at that), but he proves here that he's just as capable of doing drama, and better at it than anyone else.  Anabella Sciorra is worth an honorable mention, as well.  If she didn't win an award for this, it's quite a crime.  The basic plot of this story: everybody dies!  Robin and Ana are a married couple, with several kids, and they all die at different times.  Robin and his children are in heaven, and Ana (who commits suicide) goes to hell.  But, Robin doesn't want any part of heaven if he can't be with the girl he loves, so he goes in to save her.  Basically, this is the ultimate love story (how many people would go to hell for the one they loved?).  The story is brilliant, and the special effects are amazing.  This is a very heavily dramatic movie, by the way, and it may almost be too much to take for some, but it is a really excellent movie, one of the best ever made.

This movie makes you think about fate and afterlife and soulmates... all concepts that people vary over gratly.  It has to be one of the most beautiful movies ever created.  It is visually stunning.  It is exciting and romantic and sad.  Without giving too much away.. as some of the other reviewers here have done... I will say that Williams is reunited with his children in the afterlife and the way he finds them is sweet and heartening.  This movie will make you think about those you love and what you would do if they were gone...
There is so much to say about the movie, but I don't want to spoil it for anyone.
I diidn't like that alternate ending on the DVD, but the concept was interesting... it was not executed well... I'm a big fan of ""bookends"" so the original ending appealed to me for obvious reasons.  The special features are fantastic... Especially if you enjoy the film's art.
I now know how I'll paint my little girl's bedroom someday.
If you are not open to ideas of afterlife or anything that varies from your typical white clouds and angels playing harps, this film is not for you.",994550400,5,1109,4.465346534653466
1040405,5,6305297525,"A movie is rarely made with such intense creativity. The artistic quality is completely unique, stunning and makes this visually exciting.

Two souls meet and are soul mates beyond reality. Sunlit beauty entices you into the story. Emotional elements take hold of your heart and capture your attention in a way only one other movie has. This is a modern version of Somewhere in Time, with a more inventive twist. Only that movie made me feel the same way. What Dreams May Come is far more creative and captures the emotions of life with such truth. Yet, seems to have a similar theme.

When Chris Nielsen and Annie meet on a lake, they never imagine they will go to hell and back, in life and in death. This is an intellectual look at how heaven and hell might be and is worth watching for those aspects alone. This is a journey into Chris' mind in life and in death. Robin Williams (Chris) and Annabella Sciorra's (Annie) acting is so wonderful. I kept thinking it is a sign of a good actor when they can play so many parts in one movie. Annabella's character goes from goddess to suicidal mother and then tortured soul. Robin's character goes from calm to courageous.

Chris and Annie go through more than the normal human will ever be required to endure. When Chris dies and finds out his wife has committed suicide, he vows to find her tortured soul and bring her back to the heaven he has created for himself in his mind. He says something so profound about life and explains how he misses, books, naps and kisses. It will make you value life more.

This is a quest for everlasting love and happiness in the afterlife. While I don't believe in reincarnation, that aspect plays a role in the story which is amusing. The originality in this movie is beyond creative. Having Chris end up in a heaven made of paint when he loves paintings was so wonderful! The flying creatures were so incredible and the fact that you could be anyone you wanted to be, freeing.

A movie that will deepen your belief in a heaven and may even cause you to seek God and discover your soul. The aspects of respect, loyalty, courage, family, trust, love, belief in someone and endless devotion play out beautifully in the characters lives.

This is a movie I will watch again and again and am so pleased I purchased it. Life can take us in its teeth and shake us around. It is in the next life where we will gain our reward or punishment.

""I didn't get to say goodbye."" was what Chris said in this movie and that hit me hard because I just lost my grandmother and didn't get to say goodbye to her. Realizing that she is perhaps in the heaven of her dreams, maybe cooking in a kitchen of her imagination with my grandfather, maybe riding around in my grandfather's boat in an ocean of his imagination made me feel more at peace with my loss.

A deeply spiritual and intellectual story about issues we all care about! Don't miss it, it is spectacular and magical.

1040488,3,6305297525,"This movie is interesting because it tries to approach the idea of human mortality from an all-encompassing philosophical system by drawing on several different philsophical and theological ideas simultaneously so that no one religion or belief system is emphasized moreso than the other.  By using this approach, the movie attempts to examine and communicate the raw truths of life and death.  The film also communicates to its audience in raw emotion through the use of archetypical characters with often melodramatic performances that succeed even though they shouldn't.  The images of Hell are obviously inspired by Dante's ""Inferno"".  Though the Hell visuals are impressive, they by no means capture the hopelessness and despair of Hell.  What's most impressive is the director's attempt at visually capturing on film an idea of Heaven.  The attempt alone deserves merit and this is where the film's visuals succeed the most.  On DVD, the colors are rich and bright and serve as a good reference disc to check to see if your TV is calibrated properly.  There are generous extras and the audio mix is about average.

1040490,4,6305297525,"Firstly, it deserved it's Academy award for Visual Effects . The painted style of Robin William's ""heaven"" is breath-taking. You begin to appreciate this scene more after you go through the ""extras"" on the DVD where the SFX people explain the efforts that had gone into it. You marvel at the SFX of the movie but I wonder if one would still be amazed considering the glut of plotless SFX movies in these times. The overall picture quality of the DVD is good and the dolby digital 5.1 sound is excellent with good surround effects !
Coming to the movie, it starts of with a breathtaking scene of Switzerland (the scene was actually shot in Montana) with it's lush surroundings and the crystal clear water with the breathtaking mountains in the backdrop. You can almost smell the flowers and one is inclined to take a deep-breath on experiencing the opening scene.
The movie then starts to crawl for the next 20 minutes or so. I guess the director was probably trying to build up the characters and their interactions but nonetheless, it crawls a bit. Once that's over the tempo starts to build up !
And yea ... the alternate ending if of lessor audio/video quality but is pretty nice nonetheless. I like the part in which Cuba Gooding says ""What do you mean by 'I' ? Is it your arm, your leg ... we are IN a house but we are NOT the house..."" and implies that when we are finished with a house we move on and it's the same with our body and soul. The depiction of hell is pretty gloomy and at the same time leaves us confused as to what to make of the director's interpretation and depiction of the scenes.",991699200,7,1605,4.425675675675675

Robin Williams was wonderful, as usual, and I've always loved Annabella Sciorra since I saw her in ""True Love"".  But parts of the movie seemed to drag on and on and on till I was ready to pluck out my own eyeballs and run screaming up the aisle.

I suppose I would recommend it for two things: the special effects, which are unique and extraordinarily well-done for the time, and the interpretation of hell (wasn't that impressed with the interpretation of heaven -- could've been less boring, i.e., is that all there is?)  Hell was vastly interesting -- if people are destined to go to hell, they find not a burning lake of fire, but rather the hell they created for themselves while on earth when they had free choice to make of life whatever they could or would.

1040494,2,6305297525,"Just when you thought there were plenty of tearjerkers out there, another one arrives with zealous comedian/actor Robin Williams holding its limp foundation on his star-powered shoulders. Williams arrives fresh from an Oscar win from the Damon/Affleck juggernaut ""Good Will Hunting"" and plays it straight again, this time chock-full o' feigned waterworks and insufferable gloom. There is nothing but a river of tears and sorrow to row this pitiful storyline along, a tale that relentlessly tugs at the heart strings with concepts such as traversing the boundaries of hell to rescue the people you love the most. I think I'm getting weepy myself...sniff...
With Oscar-winning Technicolor scenery that screams Photoshop, ""What Dreams May Come"" is a web designer's wet dream and a film critic's worst nightmare. Its ocean of visual aura is not enough to keep its mawkish screenplay afloat and therefore every performance, whether mediocre or exceptional, suffers as a result. The story begins with a man named Chris Nielsen (Williams) vacationing in the beautiful countryside of Sweden where he meets his future wife Annie (Sciorra); their encounter is endearing and they almost immediately fall in love. From there, it flashes forward with small segments of their marriage and then to a beautiful home where they are parents to a teenage daughter and son. The film doesn't waste any time converting to a somber note when their children are killed in a fatal car crash. Chris follows them to the hereafter only years later, dying in a horrid collision himself and Annie is left all alone, a victim of unpreventable circumstance coping with the deaths of the people she loved the most. Chris, on the other hand, must elucidate and understand the extraordinary bond between he and his wife, tapping each other's souls through the light years between heaven and earth.
There may not be any real romance in this movie, but there isn't an ounce of chemistry between Williams and his co-star, he never acute at the leading man bit and Sciorra not much of a romantic figure herself. Out of all the crybabies in this dour ditty, she's the best of the bawlers; sad to say it's her ONLY asset. Had she been paired with a more prominent and charismatic actor, her role might've been more noteworthy.
Williams is practiced at sculpting a pitiable mug, the watery eyes and lip biting his key devices (watch ""Mrs. Doubtfire"", ""Good Morning, Vietnam"" and ""Patch Adams"" for the signature sniveling). Unfortunately, you not only have sympathy for his character but you feel sorry for Williams himself for undertaking such a schmaltzy assignment. I feel that Robin is capable of more than this and ""Good Will Hunting"" proved that. He has a fellow Oscar winner working alongside him; Cuba Gooding, Jr. is Chris's watchdog, a sentinel who makes sure that Chris makes a smooth transition from death to the hereafter. He does an admiral job but this is not the movie for him, either. If you really want to see Cuba work some magic, watch his Oscar-winning performance in ""Jerry Maguire"" or his sympathetic portrayal of a ghetto-raised adolescent in ""Boyz N' The Hood"".
""What Dreams May Come"" may be a visually stunning piece, but its lackluster and certainly hackneyed dialogue and overly emotional sentiments make it a maudlin cataclysm. I'd take Disney thoroughfare over this big-budget balderdash any day.",982108800,13,3383,5.053667262969588
1040495,5,6305297525,"There is such a profound sense of drama, magic and emotion behind the story in ""What Dreams May Come,"" a film based on the novel by Richard Matheson. There is a strong story with which anyone who loves someone else can identify, as well as an austentatious and elegant scope of visual and auditory imagery that jumps right for your eyes onscreen. Matheson's visions of heaven and hell are magnificently realized here, as well as the love between two people that is unbreakable, even after death.
The movie begins with the chance meeting of two American tourists traveling in Switzerland. Soon after, Chris and Annie become inseperable, and after their wedding, they bear two children. Many years later, Ian and Marie are killed in a car collision, leaving their parents distraught yet overcoming. Another couple of years later, Chris dies in a car accident as well, on his way to celebrate the ""Double D"" anniversary of his wife's emotional recovery from their childrens' deaths. This begins his trip into heaven, which is rocky at first during his attempts to console his living wife, then graduating into his acceptance of his immortality and ascemding into heaven, which turns out to be the creation of his own thoughts and settings. When he realizes that he is not completely happy without Annie, he becomes depressed, so it is no surprise that when Annie commits suicide and is sent to hell, he readies himself to rescue his wife from her emotional confines that keep her in her prison of eternal darkness.
The story for this movie is very ambitious, as are the filmmakers who bring it to life. There is an abundance of vivid memories in the form of flashbacks, many of which are precisely used to move the plot along and keep the story moving. Instead of becoming bored with the ongoing story of Annie and Chris's married and parental life, I found myself becoming more and more entranced as their lives unfolded, and say what you will, but the only way to tell a story like this is through flashbacks. If you were to take all of the memories and place them in order at the beginning of the movie, the audience would forget about the important moments that have an effects on the actions and events that take place in later instances of the film. Each one is a separate piece of the puzzle, and they all fit together quite well.
This film is one of those movies that showcases the possibilities for filmmaking in the future. Really, when you think about it, there is no way that the movie could have been made thirty years ago and still have the same impact as it does now. The settings and scenery play the most important role of the movie, for they provide the reason for the emotion and action that affects our characters. The beginning shots in Switzerland show us beautiful vistas of mountains and lakes, which will later become the inspiration for Chris's heaven, as well as many of the paintings Annie creates. Their home bursts forth with color and brightness, proving that color plays a big role in the film. When everyone is alive, everything seems light and airy. After Chris's death, all is dark, and the walls of the home seem dismal and gray. One scene in particular is a scene in which Chris watches his children being driven away in their van down a long line of lilac trees, a slight fog covering the scene. Their is that brilliance of color, yet the dark fog makes us uneasy, hence the accident that kills their children.
Heaven is elegantly portrayed in this film, and is done so with a new twist: that each person has their own private heaven created in the image of their own personal desires and thoughts. Chris's heaven is based on the paintings of his wife, from the mountains of Switzerland to a small island in the middle of a mountain lake with an opulent, airy house. The filmmakers give each scene the precise look of a painting, even after the special effects fade, using vivid colors, lots of flowers and mountainous backdrops, to transport us into Chris's new world. This is one of the most incredible film achievements ever, taking us to a special place that is warm, inviting, and personifies every thought we, as an audience, have ever had for beauty and vision.
Hell is given a truly horrifying and intense treatment, displaying visions of suffering as well as the personal and emotional pain of life that haunts us all. Somewhat like the way in which Heaven is created, Hell is seen as a persons's ""life gone wrong,"" which allows for the creation of their pain-driven eternity. The gateway to hell is a stunning visual image, a vast, smoky graveyard of smoldering shipwrecks that creak and groan. There is also a dismal, endless sea of decrepit faces of hell's inhabitants, that groan and scream at one another. The most striking of all the settings is the overturned cathedral, where Annie resides. The columns rise from the ceiling and go on forever into the darkness, which gives the whole place a sense of the neverending.
There is a unique chemistry between the two leads that carries on the film's emotion and power. Robin Williams is charming, humorous and bold as Chris Nielsen, and through his acting and talent, he is able to make us believe in the love that Chris holds for Annie. Annabella Sciorra is moving as Annie, embodying all of the emotions and grief that set the stage for the second half of the story. When the two are together onscreen, they are happy and in love, and we buy it because they make it appear very authentic. Cuba Gooding, Jr. plays the angel that brings Chris to heaven, doing well in his performance of helping Chris through his struggle to realize his death. Max von Sydow, whose part is not as big as others he has had, is the tracker who takes them all to hell, and his words of wisdom keep the film's informative angle moving.
""What Dreams May Come"" will go down in history as one of the most innovative and spectacular films ever made, full of ambition and inspiration. In its story, we are taken on a journey of the human heart, as well as a striking vision of what may lie in store for everyone under God's eye.",981936000,234,6099,4.6377079482439925

He also comments on the poor portral of the afterlife in many movies, showing clouds, etc. He is mostly right about that, but one great exception is the film ""Defending Your Life"".

1040557,5,6305297525,"What Dreams May Come is a very powerful movie.  Simply put, it can make you think some very deep thoughts.
  The story is very moving and brilliantly crafted.  The main character is a doctor named Chris (Robin Williams).  He has a wife (Annabella Sciorra) and two kids.  His family is great and he seems to be living the American dream.  Then his children are killed in a car accident and his life is shattered.  He spends the next four years trying to recover from the tragedy.  Then he is killed in another traffic accident and the story takes off as he goes to the beautiful afterlife.
  The movie seamlessly transitions from present to flashback to give a sense that time is irrelevant in the afterlife and to fill in the rest of the story.  The first person he sees is a young version of the doctor he apprenticed under (Cuba Gooding Jr.) who later turns out to be someone else, but I won't tell you because I don't want to ruin any parts of the movie.  He is then taken to a beautiful heaven, which is actually his mental re-creation of one of his wife's paintings.  He later learns that his wife has committed suicide and in doing so has trapped herself in a never-ending spiral of guilt (a.k.a. Hell).  Chris then has to travel to the depths of Hell to find and attempt to bring back his wife.
  This movie is loaded with abstract thoughts and themes.  For example: Your obsessions in life will become your afterlife; Thought is real, physical is the illusion; God lets bad things happen to good people; and far too many others for me to list here.

Williams' despondent wife sentences herself to the film's interpretation of hell by killing herself: a dark, empty house at the end of the world, apparently. His extra-worldly guide (played by Cuba Gooding, Jr.) tries to stop Williams from making the journey to reclaim his wife's soul, but Robin will not be deterred. My main problem with the film was primarily its dull pacing, but other factors were all too apparent. For instance, the script was way too earnest and simplistic; it trivializes the afterlife as just a big circus, a place where God is not evident. That, to me, is truly scary. I'm sure New Age aficianados will nod their heads in close-mouthed assent at the Daliesque view of the afterWorld, but it is just too secular and sanitized to be real. I will admit that the special effects are fantastic (which is the reason I gave it one star), but these special effects do not a great film make (witness ""Star Wars, Episode I""). This was a real downer film, and its willy-nilly version of the world beyond this just cannot be rationalized. Avoid at all costs.",972950400,17,1729,4.864406779661017

I was never a fan of Impressionism, 'till this movie.  I went on the Internet hoping to buy copies of some of the paintings in  this movie. No success as of yet, but I'll keep trying. And I'm no fan of  Robin Williams; matter of fact I'm not keen on him at all, but he did a  great job in this picture.
What's the premise of this movie? A family  dies and goes to ""heaven."" First the kids, then Robin, then the  wife. However, Robin's wife winds up in the ghetto of the afterlife, and  off he goes to save her. I don't want to say anymore and ruin the movie for  you.

This is a  beautiful love story about two soulmates, Chris (Robin Williams) and Annie  (Annabella Sciorra).  Tragically, they lose both of their children in a car  accident. Soon afterwards, Chris dies in a car accident as well, leaving  Annie alone bereaved.  Chris comes back, in the Spirit, to try and comfort  his wife.  She can not see or hear him...or can she?
After much suffering  over her loss, Annie commits suicide.  Chris is happy when he is told in  his own private paradise.  But there is a problem.  Annie went to hell  because she ""violated the natural order of her journey.""  Chris  responds to the terrible news with ""I'm her soulmate, I can find  her.""  When told he does not understand he replies ""it is not  about understanding! It's about NOT giving up!"" Chris is determined to  find Annie no matter what the cost. ""What Dreams May Come"" is  beautiful from start to finish but Chris' search is what touched me the  most. This movie is about agape love--love so pure that it transcends  reason or consequence.  Follow Chris through a journey into the heart of  love.
This is Robin Williams in one of his best dramatic performances;  a must-have for any fan of his.  Annabella Sciorra is a wonderful actress  and she and Robin successfully portray soulmates.  The script is one of the  best I've ever heard, full of beautiful thought-provoking lines (such as  the title above.)

The visuals are sometimes beautiful, often overdone, never  really necessary, and most of the time not even very interesting. Robin  Williams and Annabella Sciorra are supposed to be soul mates, but there is  nothing special about their relationship to make you think that it can last  other than the script constantly reminding us (especially considering that  she's a manic depressive and always moody). Their existence is supposed to  have been sublime - but as I said, nothing about it seems worthy of the  title. The children (who die early on), were apparently so neglected and  felt so unloved by their parents that when they died they decided to be  other people whom they believe their father really did love or admire. (By  the way, those ""plot"" twists do not even manage to be passingly  interesting, only confusing and reminders that this movie will never end)  None of them are even likeable, the restrained performances do not help and  only increase your lack of involvement or interest in their lives (or  deaths. Whatever). This movie wanted to be good, god knows it tries  desperately - but in the end it is one cliched mess after one overly long  scene after yet another pointless flashback (as I said, the script has to  remind us that their love was perfect since we get no sense of it on our  own).

The use of CGI to  create a heaven uniquely personalised to Robin Williams' character is  stunning - his version of paradise is based on his wife's paintings, and  everything is textured as if it's really made out of oil paint.  The  flowers, the sky, the shimmering surface of the lake - everything is almost  unimaginably beautiful.  The Hell he visits is a nasty place, though it's  not quite as impressive as the film's visions of Heaven.
'What Dreams May  Come' is only disappointing when you consider the message behind the story;  muddled together from dozens of religions, philosphies and New Age beliefs,  it ends up being a vision of the afterlife with very skewed morals: when  the hero's wife commits suicide, she is condemned to spend eternity in  Hell!  I mean, come on!  This is a terrible message.  I was also  unimpressed by the central couple's ultimate reincarnation as  toddlers-in-love - this was awfully cheesy.  If you want more intelligent  examinations of mortality / the afterlife, watch 'The Sixth Sense' or even  'Being John Malkovich'.

Robin Williams will stop at  nothing to reach his wife in the afterworld.  When he is told he can never  see her again for all eternity, he is still determined to get to her  somehow, and he seeks the help of some different ""spirits"" to do  so, as Orfeo searched for Euridice in the afterworld through the g-ds.
As soon as I heard about this movie, I had to see it, as it sounded so  similar to ""Orfeo.""  I was curious to see what a more modern-day,  American version of the first popular Italian opera would look like on  film.  It was even more spectacular than I would have ever pictured  it.
The effects in this movie were outstanding.  The movie depicts the  afterworld as a place which I view as realistic, yet surrealistic.  It is a  very comforting film, and I believe that any person with a terminal illness  would find comfort in watching a film like this.

His wife Annie(Annabella  Sciorra), who has suffered the loss of their children with him in the past,  is so devastated she kills herself and descends into Hell. Cuba Gooding Jnr  plays a jovial Heaven 'guide', who shows Chris around and what he can  create for himself, but this stiry proves that he loves Annie so much he  would, quite literally, endure hell to be with her again. This movie had it  all - spectacular visual effects depicting heaven and hell, brilliant  performances all round(Robin Williams makes any movie he does worth  watching, with the possible exception of that turkey called NINE MONTHS)  and a story that will make you think about life in a different angle. The  inverted cathedral images of Hell were an imaginative touch, along with the  sea of faces and Max Von Sydow as a kind of dark man, or tracker, leading  Williams into Hell.

The Oscar it earned for its visual effects was  extremely well deserved (and actually got me re-interested in seeing the  film on DVD). Spectacular visuals, moving score, excellent audio effects  and special features available on DVD only (Beautiful PC Wallpaper  downloads and an alternate movie ending).
I SO wanted this to be one of  the great films of all time -- it isn't; it could have used more character  development so we care more about the characters besides just the Robin  Williams character -- but if you want your DVD player to blow your socks  off and stretch the limits of the home entertainment medium, this has a  chance to be, and remain, one of the great DVD releases of all time.  The  DVD conversion is great; the disc will ""drip"" from your TV and  speakers.  The acting performances are excellent, considering how easily  they could be lost by the computer generated visuals.  It's the script that  could not bear the weight of the film and even so, it is not a bad script  at all really, just should have been more memorable and less plodding.
It  is also a great movie to watch with your spouse or significant other.  Watch it on a day when you are ticked off at something somebody did that  day -- cut you off on the road; was rude to you at work; bothered you at  home -- and you'll treat the REST of that day, and many more, with a whole  new outlook.

The movie is simply astounding. It adheres to the book  in all the most important aspects, and does so with the most beautiful  cinematography and special effects I have ever seen. This is not a  special-effects movie; it is a film about life and death and love, and all  of the wonderful scenery is only enhancement.  On the DVD, there is an  alternate ending, which is more in tune with the original ending in the  book, and which, to me, is better. The ending which the producers decided  was more acceptable I found too saccharine and not in tune with the rest of  the story.

OK, OK, I shed a tear when the dog showed up in Heaven, what can I say... But  those FX!  As eye candy this movie rates higher than most anything since  Fantasia.  The FX are of a whole new order. They open up a new era of  possibility in fantasy, horror, and SF film-making.
I agree with the pro  reviewer who didn't find any chemistry between the leads.  I found these  two ""soul mates"" pretty unconvincing, so that rather weakened the  most basic premise.  It's not that the leads were incompetent actors, they  emoted like crazy and conveyed pain and grief and all that stuff;  it's  just that they did not as successfully emote a steady tenderness and  intimacy -- nor was there sufficient backstory between their ""meet  cute"" moment and their later (wow, so affluent!) domestic existence.  Did they really have to be such yuppies?  could this story not have been  realized using more ordinary citizens?
I really have mixed feelings about  the ""disguising"" of characters in the post-mortal world.  The  director may be trying to make a ""profound"" statement about  people's external appearances being irrelevant to the real person inside --  OK, I'll give them some benefit of the doubt.  But on the other hand,  there's something unpleasant about a cine-world in which the only non-white  people turn out to be just masks for the protagonist's whitebread teenage  kids.  Good intentions or no, I didn't care for that touch.
I'm sure I  will watch it again, just to wallow in all that lush visual beauty.  I may  even sniffle a bit over the dog the 2nd time around.

1041475,2,6305297525,"Robin Williams and Cuba Gooding, Jr. got lucky at the Oscars one year. So, the director of ""Dreams"" decides that he'll get them together to make this film.
All right. That's fine.
Then, you have to get your  hands on a ""great"" script, drafted from a novel by...Richard  Matheson...old Twilight Zone writer, wrote ""Duel"", ""The  Legend of Hell House"", ""I Am Legend"", and the great  ""Somewhere in Time""...
You're rolling along now.
Now to shoot  your movie. Give your audience something to stare at so they won't get  bored with all the droning-on about meta-physics and what-not. Ooooo...look  at the pretty colors...and that wierd bird-thing...that's basically it,  folks. It's pretty all right. Pretty shallow.
In fact, the only character  with ANY depth whatsoever in this film is Chris, played by Robin Williams,  in a film that is essentially, 1998's ""Soldier"" without the  violence and with a brighter set. It's really unfortunate, too. This film  had the potential to be great. And on a visual level, it is...don't get me  wrong! In fact, it IS a shoe-in for Art Direction at this year's Oscars and  has a run for its money against ""Armageddon"" for Visual  Effects.
But there's really not much more than that. We're supposed to  see the long-dead family dog running across the flower-field(which looks  like a Robert Frost poem after five doses of Crack) and cry because Chris  sees him again. But Vincent Ward(director of ""Map of the Human  Heart"") feels that we really don't have to know much about such  characters, and thus, kills them off as he sees fit. At least THE DOG had  more flesh than Chris's psycho wife, Annie. And when he DOES kill them, you  sit there and wait for the funeral to end, because you really never knew  the deceased that well and they're so one-dimensional anyhow, that you  really didn't care to meet them in the first place. That's part of the  reason that you don't cry in this film. Even Robin Williams(in a  heart-tugging performance) almost feels to the audience, like an actor who  is improvising with zombies that can't think of what to say when he talks  to them. And the only really weepy parts are when we're force-fed the  slow-motion shots of funerals and crying flight attendants who just may or  may not be your family in disguise. Imagine, telling somebody that your son  sucked at football and that he wished he could teach him better before he  died, then all of the sudden...WHAMMO!!! The previously African-American  guy that was standing next to you is SUDDENLY YOUR SON. And that the flight  attendant you smiled at that you are talking to in Heaven suddenly becomes  YOUR DAUGHTER!!! And that the old guy who was taking you through Hell is  suddenly that African American guy who is your son...kinda...sorta...I  think... Why does everyone you know have to be in disguise? Why can't they  just come out and say, ""Dad, I missed you""?
And they said that  ""Mission Impossible"" was confusing. This makes that film easier  to understand than Sesame Street!
Not much intensity is here either. You  expect an epic trip through hell and right as Chris is ready to face his  fear, we hit a flashback that lets us in on Chris's life; one of about  eighty-thousand that are sprinkled about this movie like too much spice.  Why couldn't we have known these things earlier? It not only throws the  viewer off, it ruins the pacing of the film.
And ""Heaven""  relies heavily on your beliefs. I believe in Heaven, but I don't believe in  a lot of the mind-crap that was fed to me from this movie. I have lost a  lot of people in my family, but I really don't believe that they're in  their own place, walking around some paint field. Then that means my father  is teaching a classroom of kids 24-7 and my grand-father is in some brothel  in World War 2, getting fed grapes by the clientele. Dante can say what he  wants, but I don't agree with his fundamentalism. Hell is creative and all,  but there's really no punishment for the banished souls. Unless some guy  from Heaven just happens to be trying to rescue his wife and accidentally  ends up walking on your face(see the film and you'll get it).
I don't  know. I really wanted to like this movie, but there wasn't much  explanation. Instead, the director focuses too much on making you stare at  floating bodies while the characters all drone on about whether or not they  should have made different choices. If I want to listen to this, I would  have gone to an art-gallery and listened to my Aunt talk to me for two  hours.
It would have been the same thing, believe me.

1041550,5,6305297525,"While it was nearly 3 months ago, this movie still moves me.  There have been many movies that attempt to celebrate the power of love yet ""Dreams"" expands this to embellish the eternal bonds of soul  mates.  Bring your mate, bring the tissue and bring extra ticket money to  see the details of the fabulous scenes you missed.",919728000,,325,4.551724137931035
1041551,5,6305297525,"Though it seemed to start off a little fast, this movie has the power to pull the viewer inside within a few short minutes of its beginning and not let go until days after.  The theme hits hard, as though the viewer is  being is hit by a car.  The pain and suffering can be felt through the tv  screen.  It was interesting to see the director's interpretation of what  heaven is like.  I recommend it to anyone who wants (or needs) to believe  and discover what dreams may come.",919555200,,478,4.233333333333333

7889636,4,6305297525,"If anyone hasn't seen this, it is a fine example of Robin Williams as a dramatic actor.  With a talented cast behind him, this movie delves into its subject matter with emotion and gusto.  Be advised that some parts get pretty dreary and dark.  Cuba Gooding Jr., Max Von Sydow, and Annabella Sciorra also star.",1525046400,,310,4.6
