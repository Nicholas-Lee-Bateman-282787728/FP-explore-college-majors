1085368,4,6305899592,"Traveller takes on the subject of the eponymous groups of ethnic Irish con artists (there are also Scottish and English counterparts)of the Southeastern, Central and Southern United States with considerable (but not complete) authenticity.  These groups typically fall short of the 'big cons' described in The Sting and some other con artist films, and instead concentrate on selling defective trailers and doing ""homers"" or  construction and driveway repair scams.  What the film does best with its fine cast of perfomers (even Mark Wahlberg, a vastly overrated actor does a good job playing himself in a role where it fits) is give an insight into the social milieu of the Travelers.  This which forms a culture much like that of gypsies, which few Americans realize exists among peoples who came here from the British isles.  Bill Paxton does his usual fine job in an understated role and my only criticism is that the film is just a bit quick and incomplete in providing a resolution of the issues.  When Traveller was released it wasn't pushed very hard or circulated very widely and, as a result, few people were aware of it.  This was an injustice, because it is far above the norm of Hollywood productions.",1019952000,17,1214,4.921568627450981
1085369,4,6305899592,"I picked up this title, solely based on the cast. And they do not disappoint you. Very strong acting, and a tidy little story line, keeps this movie well paced. A great little sleeper. Bill Paxton is amazing. If you him enjoyed 'One False Move', this film takes his acting back to those days. So pick it up, and enjoy.",1004918400,3,318,4.316666666666666

7897054,4,6305899592,"Bill Paxton plays a character who is a hustler and a ""gypsy"".  He belongs to the tribe of so called Irish Travellers who live in a trailer park, isolated from the rest of the mainstream.  They live their lives by scamming people, pulling tricks and making easy money in the rural south.  There are certain unwritten codes of conduct that these people live by.  Outsiders are strictly fobidden, and ""tricks"" are meant to support Travellers extended families and elderly.

So one day, a young man (played by Mark Wahlberg) apeears to the clan that used to be his father's before his father decided to marry a woman who was an outsider herself.  Suddenly an orphan, this young man decides to turn to the only family he knows for help.  He is not easily accepted and it takes Paxton's character Booky to take him uder his wing in order to help me learn how to make money on the road.

All is well, until one day, during one of their ""tricks"" a woman (played by Julianna Margulies) comes between these two men.  Loyalties are tested.  One day, they decide to pull a big scam that tips off another tribe of gypsies (these are of the Eastern European kind).  A sort of war erupts and it is a kind of game where there are no prisoners.  Winner takes all.

I liked the movie.  It is better that any type of gangster/mob movies.  These are people who pull tricks, but will not shy away from killing is all other resources are exhausted.  It is also a story of basic human need to be surrounded by love and people who can save us from loneliness, unhappiness and despair.",1355961600,,1560,4.440140845070423
7897055,4,6305899592,"Good movie with Bill Paxton and Mark Wahlberg, But then I like anything with Mark Wahlberg.  I have seen every movie of Mark Wahlberg's and I would rate this in the top half of his 25 movies.  Good watching!",1309824000,,207,4.282051282051282

7897057,3,6305899592,"This flick is pretty weak.  This considering some of the actors in this movie are some of my favorites.  If they weren't in it I would have given it 2 stars.  Why this movie is rated by others as high as it is, is beyond me.  I purchased this movie because of the other reviews and I am very disappointed with it.",1252454400,2,313,4.0
