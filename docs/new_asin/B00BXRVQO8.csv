5680829,5,B00BXRVQO8,"As a huge fan of The Walking Dead , I was expecting a UK version of it . I was mistaken and in a very fantastic way .This is a story of Fear , Hate ,Not Understanding and most of all love and acceptance !I do not want to give too much of the story away .But I warn you ... you will cry and judge yourself in as how you would handle this world . The story could go further I hope to see it does .Bring back Rick !!",1370649600,6,413,3.5494505494505493
5680830,5,B00BXRVQO8,"Always been a huge fan of Zombie/Apocalyptic movies, so when I found out this series had come out and was available on Amazon instant video I was extremely excited, especially since The Walking Dead won't come back till this fall. I wasn't sure how this show would turn out, seeing as its a different aspect of how a Zombie apocalypse could turn out. After seeing Warm Bodies,(which was a great Zombie film btw) and the way they flipped the script on Zombie movies, I was hoping In The Flesh would turn out the same way in a sense; but for Zombie TV shows. I can say I am extremely satisfied. After watching just the first episode, I couldn't help but thinking how good the show really is, especially the way they they portray this Partially Deceased Syndrome. I feel its more realistic to the way the government, and society, would go about controlling and trying to medicate the Partially Deceased, because of the way the government presently plays a huge role in the Pharmaceutical market. I am highly surprised by the way the plot has already developed in only the first episode. This is a must watch show for any Zombie/Apocalyptic movie fans like me.",1370649600,9,1156,4.64390243902439
5680831,5,B00BXRVQO8,"Not your typical zombie movie. Not by a mile.

Remember the days of science fiction at its best in the 50's, 60's and 70's? Well, this series reminded me of what is so great about the genre. It gets you thinking of things you never thought about before.

This is a wonderful series and if you miss it you will be the poorer for it. Beautifully done. A+ work by everyone involved.",1367193600,12,379,4.25

5680833,4,B00BXRVQO8,A bit predictable with its analogy to the bigotries people spew at those who are different but the human drama is well fleshed out . . . and it takes the idea of Warm Bodies and expands it to the continued co-existence of the undead with the alive.,1484265600,,248,4.1875

5680836,5,B00BXRVQO8,"Zombies are returned to British society, after successfully undergoing ongoing treatments with a new process that removes their bloodthirst, returns their human feelings, but does not cure their affliction.  The first season concerns the reintroduction of the zombies, focused on the main character who returns to a small town that was a hotbed of anti-zombie resistance - a resistance army that included the sister with whom he now shares a house. The conflicts that arise between the ex-warriors, ex-zombies,  and families that love both of the, are very  complex and entertaining.",1477353600,,583,5.384615384615385
5680837,5,B00BXRVQO8,"This was so good. I love sad things and I also love gay things. I also love things that are politically charged. There is a clear commentary on race relations... Despite there being a nearly entirely white cast. There's a really insightful interpretation of both sides of this conflict. Also, what's more horrific than realizing that the creatures you've been killing ruthlessly and who have been attaching you right back and eating corpses are still human! Very good. Very entertaining. Newberry is very cute. Five thumbs up.",1473897600,,526,5.057471264367816

5680843,5,B00BXRVQO8,"This is no ordinary zombie series. The story line, characters, and family and social dynamics are realistic, thought-provoking, and sometimes heart-breaking. None of the characters is two-dimensional, and none is flawless or carelessly realized. The acting is subtle, effective and engaging. The second season has six episodes and ended on a note that begs a third season, but I understand it has been off the air for a few years and no new material is in sight. This is the sort of show you have to get a friend to watch just so you can talk about it.

That guy in the artwork for this show? He mopes. He snivels. He mopes some more. His ""rebel"" little sister (she's got a MISFITS poster! She wears DOCS!) mopes. She snivels. She snivels some more.

Well done, well acted, and with all the controversy over Syrian immigrants, I see some political undertones to the message, as well...maybe that's just me, though.

5680858,5,B00BXRVQO8,"This is one of those TV shows that only comes along every once in a great while. It's unusual, different, unique. Someone had an original idea. We've all seen zombies shows but this isn't one of those.

While it certainly deals with the subject of the ""undead"" it very much explores the aspect of what is still alive in the afflicted, both physically and mentally. Along the way, it touches on certain social issues people have to deal with in real life. Fear of the unknown, discrimination, prejudice, but also tolerance and love.

The main character, Keiran has to find his way through an elaborate emotional labyrinth as he is trying to physically become a human being again and fit into the little village he grew up in.
The viewer gets drawn into his journey and slowly discovers the secrets that led to the The Rising and why Keiran is one of the risen.

Cinematography is excellent - very dark, moody and realistic feeling. Outstanding writing, acting and make up. It's a shame they canceled the show after 2 seasons. However, the majority of the key plotlines are being revealed and it is still very much worth watching.",1449792000,,1128,4.686868686868687

5680860,5,B00BXRVQO8,"Here's a show for folks sick of the seriouser-than-thou zombie madness over at AMC. This brilliant, patch black comedy gives the genre a welcome twist.

A satire with a serious, dramatic message, In the Flesh is a mature, emotionally nuanced, and exquisitely crafted drama, set four years after an apocalyptic event called the Rising led to the resurrection of 140,000 recently deceased folks across Britain, hungry for human flesh.

Instead of showing the havoc, In the Flesh examines its aftereffects. The zombies have either been eradicated or cured, thanks to the National Health Service. Relabeled Partially Deceased Syndrome sufferers, they are stuffed full of serum and sent back home.

Things don't go so smoothly for one returnee, Kieren ""Ren"" Walker (Luke Newberry), a gay teen from a small rural town who is met with distrust and hatred when he returns home.

In the Flesh, which stars Kenneth Cranham as the town's hate-mongering priest, Steve Evets as a gun-toting zombie killer, and David Walmsley as his closeted zombie son, strikes a remarkable balance between comedy and tragedy as it explores the deep roots of prejudice, whether it's aimed at immigrants, gays and lesbians - or the partially dead.",1449014400,,1216,5.157360406091371
5680861,5,B00BXRVQO8,"So, this is quite a unique show. In the best way possible, I should say.
It's unique both aesthetically and story-wise, with an emphasis on character development and exploration rather then action, which for a show centered around zombies, more or less, isn't the norm.
The acting feels very real and the show in general is immersive, but not jarringly so. I found myself going ""okay just one more episode..."" many times, until I watched the series and then restarted watching it again.

The major downside for this series is that it was canceled January 2015 despite it's acclaim, and is unfinished. If you can't stand watching something that is NOT finished, and may never be finished, then consider not watching it if that's going to disturb you. For me, it's fine because I have [maybe unrealistic] high hopes it will be either picked up by the BBC again or by a streaming service. [Hint, hint, Amazon.]

There aren't a lot of shows with supernatural elements that have queer main characters (with mental illness, also) at least I've found. While that is one reason I watched it [besides I like horror, which this really isn't except for gore, which was well done.] it's not the ONLY reason to watch it. While these things are part of these characters stories, it's not the main focus and honestly is the best way I've seen queer characters handled; it not BEING the main focus of that particular character, and not the only noteworthy trait of that character. So if these two traits are not 100% relatable to you, don't fret too much, you may still enjoy the show.

TL;DR
If you like: Small town dynamics, dreary settings, family issues, queer characters, realistic characters.
If you tolerate: Gore, violence, self harm, suicide, vomit, romance, character death, drug use, ableism [specifically towards mental illness], moderate sexual situations, religion discussion.

Basically I 100% think it's worth watching and supporting, so buy it? Maybe if enough people buy it and watch it, it'll get picked up again.
Anyways, the first season gives you a good feel for series as a whole, and it's only a few episodes.",1448928000,2,2117,4.872222222222222

5680865,5,B00BXRVQO8,"In the Flesh is absolutely one of my favorite shows and is a masterpiece of British drama. It tackles trauma, loss, and grief in a realistic and engaging way and addresses stigma, depression, and family life in a way no other program I am aware of has. I'm immensely proud of this show and everyone who worked on it. It uses the 'Zombie trope' that is so popular in a way that is not only original but very well executed, and I can certainly say it is my favorite piece of Zombie media. The seamless portrayal of LGBT characters is also incredibly refreshing, not stereotyped or fussed over, and that kind of representation is delightful. I highly recommend the show and frequently drag friends, family, and near strangers to my living room and marathon the series for them and I have yet to see the show not immediately well-received. Also, this show introduced me to the music of Keaton Henson, which I think not only perfectly compliments the program, but is in general excellent music so I also have the show to thank for that. If an In the Flesh film ever needs a kickstarter, I will definitely be one of the first to donate.",1445472000,,1130,4.517073170731707

I don't know how long. Honestly, it is so smart. It is admittidly on the liberal side. But just the fact that I have to a dress that!

5680890,5,B00BXRVQO8,"""In The Flesh"" is not just your typical zombie drama -- in fact, it's one of the (very) rare series where the ""zombies"" (PDS-sufferers) are the focal point. Season 1 was off to a great start with compelling characters trying to live out their lives in the fictional town of Roarton, particularly those who are PDS-sufferers (pretty diverse cast might I add, in terms of strong LGBT and female characters), and Season 2 kicks it up a notch as we follow Kieren struggling to find his place and be accepted in an increasingly prejudiced town. Tie that in with themes of other mental illnesses, such as depression and PTSD, and stories of religious extremism on both ends, and you have what is arguably one of the most captivating stories of the 21st-century when it comes to treating the mentally ill not just as topics, but people.

Despite such wonderful themes, ""In The Flesh"" is facing cancellation after only two seasons. For those interested in saving this phenomenal show, look up the #RENEWINTHEFLESH and the many petitions requesting Amazon and Netflix to pick up the series -- it'd mean a lot to a great deal of people.",1422835200,,1126,4.744897959183674

How does the politics of the stranger, the immigrant work? How do the excluded and the despised and the persecuted get changed?

The people of his home village, Roarton, are still reeling from the recent devastation of the Rising and subsequent war. Some are still reluctant to give up arms.
The resulting conflict forms a rich, complex, and often very dark drama that draws from real-life social issues to great effect. Parallels to the struggles of mentally ill, war trauma survivors and lgbt people make all this zombie stuff feel real and important.
In The Flesh is startling, heartbreaking, and bravely original. I highly recommend it.
(ITF is very little like the other big zombie horror drama on television, The Walking Dead, though it might serve as a sort of post-zombie-cure sequel with a very different tone.)",1422230400,,900,5.046979865771812

In The Flesh deals with many forms of prejudice sensitively, and in a way that doesn't smack you over the head with preachy-ness. Season 2 is even stronger in this respect; with double the amount of episodes to play with, nothing is black and white, and ALL of the characters have points of view we can sympathise with. Having recently re-watched seasons 1 and 2, I can honestly say that I found the storytelling even more complex and touching the second time around. I just can't think of another show like it. It should never have been cancelled. It deserves to come back.",1421798400,,740,4.571428571428571

In the Flesh is one of the most original, touching fantasy stories I've ever encountered. It has extremely endearing characters with extraordinary realness and depth, and they've earned AT LEAST one more season to show us more of their wonderful story. Even disregarding the cliffhangers at the end of the second season, this show has so much more to give, so much insight to share about how important it is to overcome prejudice, to embrace diversity, to celebrate life and all the joys it brings, no matter how much we're haunted by fears and miseries of the past. What we have here is raw, honest, and loving like nothing else. It comforts and inspires me and so many others, and I hope we'll get to see at least one more season!

If doesn't have all the humor of some of those other movies,and it is significantly more gritty (which is to its credit, I think) but what it does have is a unique way of looking at zombies.  I like this new take on zombies as merely diseased humans- who can be cured!  Yay!  But this sets up all sorts of social tensions.  Do we really want the zombies back after they've eaten our mates?  Do we trust them?  There are all sorts of ways you can see this series as an allegory for real things going on in the world today- which is, of course, how Romero saw his original zombies (because parts of those movies were quite clearly social commentary).  I bought this, and I am really glad I did, and I am looking forward to more episodes, because it's thoughtful, well acted, entertaining, and I can't always predict where it's going to go- and I like that.  There are some genuinely moving scenes in this as well (when you see the father and daughter zombies- I found them deeply moving in a way I would not have anticipated- one does not expect to be reminded of some of the deepest human relationships in a zombie series).",1421193600,,1220,4.349557522123894

I like that it takes a different angle on the zombie storyline (which never was a favorite of mine) and makes it about their recovery and prejudice against those who are different and in my opinion does a really go job showing what PTSD is like as well.

5680915,5,B00BXRVQO8,"This is easily the best zombie series since The Walking Dead, although it deals with the aftermath of  the Zombie Apocalypse, known here as ""The Rising."" It's set at a time when medical science has perfected a cure for zombies, who in politically correct terms, are referred to as suffering from Partially Dead Syndrome (PDS). The central character is Kieren Walker, an eighteen-year-old boy who has killed himself when his best friend Rick Macy dies in an explosion. Both boys return as zombies and later, with treatment, as PDS patients. Doctors deliver each boy to his own home in a small Lancashire village where zombies are hated and a vigilante group sets about destroying them. One of the leaders in the group is Rick's own father, who is in denial that his returned son is one of the ""rotters,"" as the zombies are called. The town's chief hater, however, is the pastor of the local church, whose sermons are spewed with venom toward the reformed zombies.  Another central PDS character is Amy Dyer, a young woman who has died of leukemia prior to her rising from the dead. All three young people try to adjust to a town that doesn't want them, and family members who have mixed feelings. The first season has only three episodes (the third of which is emotionally devastating). The second series has six episodes and concerns a revolutionary underground group of former zombies. The BBC has yet to announce if there will be a third season in 2015. The show has won a well-deserved BAFTA (the British Academy Award) for its fine quality.",1417910400,,1544,4.757462686567164

In the Flesh is such a unique take on the zombie story! Victims, once dead, rose from the grave much like the ravenous zombies we are all oh so used to, but were eventually treated and returned to their normal, pre-death selves. There's a catch though: they're partially diseased. Their skin is pale, their eyes are yellow, and they don't eat. Do you get the (minimal) gore and the thrill of a normal zombie story? Yes! Do you get an analysis of oppression, discrimination, and how society views the ""freaks"" of the world? Yes! Even better, the show has wonderful representation of the LGBTQ community.

5680942,4,B00BXRVQO8,"Somewhere between the meditative French masterpiece 'Les Revenants' and the apocalyptic brutality of 'The Walking Dead', the BBC zombodrama 'In the Flesh' is an earnest exploration of prejudice, second chances, and the possibility or impossibility of forgiving others and ourselves.

The story focuses on Keiron, who was one of many to rise from the grave as a flesh-eating zombie, but who is now himself again, having gone through the drug treatment that rebuilds the memory and eradicates the terrible hunger. Returning home to a small English town hit hard by the zombie plague, he finds attitudes toward 'Partial Death Syndrome' sufferers like himself range from nervously polite to violently hostile. With bigotry propagated by the local preacher and the leader of the local militia regarded as heroes for protecting the townsfolk and combating the undead hordes, Keiron finds his homecoming a depressing experience. The fact that his younger sister is one of the hardline heroes of the 'Human Volunteer Force' militia, who advocate killing instead of curing all 'PDS' sufferers, creates a tension bordering on the murderous.


The judgement and hatred directed toward Keiron only exacerbates the guilt that gnaws on his still rotting brain. Haunted by the one memory he has of his Zombie-self -- in which he attacks and kills a young woman in a grocery market/pharmacy -- he never makes excuses for his 'crimes' (as justifiable as they might be), and initially accepts the scorn directed at him. Flashbacks reveal more of that traumatic experience in increments, until he remembers the true source of the antagonism between he and his sister. The young woman who became his victim was, it tuns out, his sister's best friend, Lisa... and she happened to be there with her. The shock of confronting her zombified brother as he devoured her girlfriend's corpse was too much. After killing the other zombies in the store, she couldn't bring herself to kill undead-Keiron. Her own guilt over freezing up when Lisa still might have been saved was redirected at Keiron, whose culpability and own feelings of remorse made him a convenient scapegoat.

The unexpected return of the militia leaders' soldier son, pushes the action toward the season finale, and offers more revelations: Keiron had been in a gay relationship with this very much in-the-closet soldier, named Rick. When he ended things between them and shipped out for combat in the Middle East, a distraught Keiron committed suicide. Rick's hateful, bigoted father has been in denial regarding his sons's sexuality. So when Rick comes home as PTS case, he reverts back into denial mode, continuing his crusade to murder all the 'Rotters', even recruiting him into the Militia, pretending not to notice that his perfect, heroic son is a zombie too.

The writing is excellent, putting a slightly different spin on an over-saturated genre, forgoing the blood-and-guts for a philosophical experiment in guilt, forgiveness, and denial. It occasionally lapses into cliche and predictability, but not often. The cast is uniformly excellent as well; it seems as if the Brits are less superficial in their casting than Hollywood, valuing an actors talents over their looks. While it never achieves the profound emotional engagement and heart-breaking poignancy of 'Les Revenants', that's like criticizing 'The Shield' for never rivalling the brilliance of 'The Wire'; one is very good, the other is a masterpiece. 'In the Flesh' is no masterpiece, but it is a thought-provoking horror-drama that is very entertaining. Unfortunately, the British proclivity for 3 or 4 episodes per season makes this closer to a long movie than an entire season. Hopefully, the BBC will smarten up and release a combined 1st and 2nd season edition on Blu-ray. Even so, it's still just 7 episodes, so keep it in mind when you consider buying. This would be a good series to watch on Prime.  {82/100}",1407974400,,3930,5.161695447409733

Even though technically this show is about zombies, it's more about them as people and their struggles and conflict on living their second lives. It's a show about real issues and topics of the world. Ex: discrimination, ""racism"", prejudice, the after effects of war on a community and the people, hate crimes, etc.

Something worth mentioning is Kieren's sexuality. It's handled so subtlety and beautifully. You come to realize it on your own watching the show. It's not in the script for someone to mention offhandedly for the audience sake.

I haven't been so captivated by a show since I discovered the BBC's Sherlock.  In the Flesh takes zombie norms and cliches and throws them out the window for an entirely new play on the genre.  The actors truly make the characters shine, most notably Kieren Walker (Luke Newberry) and Amy Dyer (Emily Bevan).

And I have to applaud In the Flesh for featuring tough issues, such as sexual orientation, self hatred, family struggles, and mob culture.  This is so much more than a mere zombie show.  I like The Walking Dead, but for me the plot is predictable and slow.  Not so with In the Flesh: this show will keep you on the edge of your seat wondering what happens next.

It's an incredible series, one that explores the concept of what it means to be human. It explores mindless discrimination, and how it's based on fear and ignorance. It's the same way in our society. It explores relationships. If you can't understand a warm-blooded human falling in love with, or sleeping with a cold blooded ""Partially Dead"", then you have no imagination; appreciation is unavailable to you. A pity. Maybe at least you can empathize with someone who unexpectedly returns home to a family that is at once celebratory, fearful, resentful of your death, and who ultimately must decide whether fear and rejection, or love and acceptance, will win out.

I did not find this an easy program to watch but, more importantly a totally compelling story .  I love the fact that it explores nature vs nurture and that anyone or anything can be cured ( until series 2).  I further love that the l scenery as it is typical Northern England.

No, it really isn't that simple. It's so much more.
To be honest, I was looking for something to fill the void while I await the return of The Walking Dead but what I found was a whole new world to fall into. It's dark and frightening but not in the way you'd think. Sure, there are plenty of zombies or as they call them ""Rotters"" but they're in some ways more human than the living.

5680982,5,B00BXRVQO8,"I'll admit that I myself am getting tired of the whole zombie craze. Oh, I love zombies, but we have seen more zombie flicks and works of fiction since The Walking Dead hit screens in 2010. And you know something, if I was 13 when that show premiered, I probably would have loved it, but I was a grumpy 19 year old and I hated it. And now four years later, I've finally cut my teeth on BBC Three's brilliant new sleeper hit and a show that is on its way to becoming a huge phenomenon, In the Flesh. And man, a lot of the zombies here are (understandably) grumpy too, but that's besides the point. I'll admit that having heard about the whole concept and having caught the last ten minutes of a recent episode on the Space Channel here in Canada, that's when I finally gave in.

In the Flesh is an absolutely brilliant zombie series that is something so much more. The show doesn't think you're stupid, it's very rich in character and has absolutely brilliant performances, the story is compelling and it doesn't throw unnecessary gore at the screen to keep you awake. It's a drama, first and foremost, and a compelling one at that. It's also sadly very relevant to today's society and explores issues that are going in in the world right now with zombies as the allegory- be it for homosexuals, people of different colour, religion, etc. But most importantly is that Dominic Mitchell shifts his sole focus to the characters and he is so good at making us care about these characters. Add to that one of the best lead actors in years, Luke Newberry, and you have a show that deserves to be a major hit.

The story revolves around 24 year old Kieren Walker. He is a zombie, one of the many who rose from the dead in an apocalyptic event called ""the rising"". He's a handsome, soft-spoken and conservative individual who took his own life 5 years back when his best friend (or was it more?) died in Afghanistan. He, and many of the other zombies are referred to as sufferers of ""Partially Deceased Syndrome"" (the politically correct version of the word ""zombie"") and is reminded that what happened in their untreated state is not their fault. He returns to his family, and almost immediately is faced with the task of trying to make peace with them after all those years ago, when he killed himself. Adjusting to home life isn't hard at first, but it soon gets tough when he has to put up with discrimination from the townsfolk on a regular basis and is commonly referred to as a ""rotter"" (basically a fantastical n-word for zombies)... and must deal with his extreme,y zombie-phobic sister, who helped kill zombies during the rising. He meets a new friend named Amy, who herself is a PDS sufferer and begins to immerse himself into society again, but he has a lot of confronting of his own demons to do before he can allow himself to live a normal life again.

This show is fantastic because it makes you think, it challenges you to consider what you would do if you were in Kieren's situation, and you can't help but feel bad for poor Kieren and want to give him a hug. So many shows nowadays try too hard by forcing cliched issues in to make you care for the characters, but Mitchell shows these characters as people who aren't exactly perfect, but are interesting in their own right. The absolutely fantastic cast helps it too- Newberry's performance is absolutely fantastic and never once over-acts or under-acts, you believe every word out of his mouth. Bevan's performance as Amy Dyer is equally charming and you can't help but love her. And even the bleak and depressing atmosphere of the show presented enhances the real sense of hopelessness and despair present throughout the show- in addition to the absolutely stellar writing from Dom Mitchell.

In short, this is a new show that deserves to be a hit. As I type this, I'm all caught up and am anticipating Sunday's series 2 finale. By all means, check it out.",1401840000,,3918,4.553191489361702

However, one thing I did not pay attention to when making my purchase was the absurdly short running time (around three hours all told).  Normally when you think of a television series you're thinking of somewhere around 13+ episodes for a season.  In my mind less than that is just a mini-series.  My recommendation would be skip the DVD's and simply purchase the episodes through Amazon instant videos (at current pricing the DVD is $15, the ""season"" is $1.99 per episode or $4.99 for the ""season,"" for HD the ""season"" $7.99).",1401408000,7,710,4.795081967213115

if you are at all incredulous, i promise you that watching will make a believer and advocate of you. this is not your average zombie flick. if the grotesqueries of the genre generally repel you, this is a great way to come to see these for what they are: analogies and metaphors meant to illuminate the human condition. in this case ***SPOILER ALERT*** the very common (and PATHETIC) practice of demonising non-absolutely-heterosexual people is paralleled and made deftly salient, and exposed for the empty waste of lives that it is.

The characters are persecuted for being different, even though they had no choice in the matter. They are accused by the local vicar of being evil and engaging in despicable acts of sin. Meanwhile the PDS sufferers are faced with hatred, segregration, and even murder for simply being who they are. Which is exactly how the LGTB community has been treated throughout the world.

5681023,5,B00BXRVQO8,OMG... Awesome show... Wish we had made it before the Brits... We could have made it bloodier and gotten away with it,1383782400,,117,4.363636363636363
5681024,5,B00BXRVQO8,"Interesting premise, carried on well. Very enjoyable viewing and not the ordinary zombie ideas, which I do appreciate. The story takes place after all the zombie-fighting, showing how the survivors deal with the returning former zombies (not well).",1383523200,,248,5.552631578947368
5681025,5,B00BXRVQO8,"""In The Flesh"" is the ""Coming Home"" for the zombie genre. Dominic Mitchell, like Isaac Marion before him, has given the humanity back to a much-maligned movie ""monster"". The actors, their performances, the stark rural settings, and the unique premise that zombies can be managed with medicine and makeup is ""Spot On"", as the Brits would say. In just three episodes, the series manages, without explanation, to reveal the backstory of the ""Rising"" and the government's attempts to deal with the problems of mainstreaming the ""PDS sufferers"" into society, and shows how that effort is failing due to hatred, prejudice and fear of the survivors of the ""Rising"". This is a MUST-SEE series for fans of the Zombie genre.",1381449600,,714,5.008403361344538
5681026,5,B00BXRVQO8,"If you didn't catch this 3 part mini series, now's the time. Get your popcorn ready for a creative, thoughtful and masterful ride!!!",1377820800,,132,4.782608695652174
5681027,1,B00BXRVQO8,"Ok I love Zombies.  I love new ideas involving them.  I do not, however, enjoy wasting my money on a snooze feast of a show!  It's slow moving, the dialogue is boring, and it has a blah over all feel to it.  Don't waste your money!!!",1377388800,2,233,4.0
5681028,5,B00BXRVQO8,"I was glued to the television! One of the better zombie show/movie I've seen. The plot was different, but in a good way.  Overall I give it 5 stars and recommend it to any zombie lover, it was fantastic!",1377129600,,203,4.205128205128205
5681029,5,B00BXRVQO8,im a gore and horror guy but this story was interesting and fresh. im excited to see where the writers will go with this. this is worth the small price and im hoping this lasts to at least 100 episodes.,1374969600,,202,4.075
5681030,4,B00BXRVQO8,"I watched this show because of my interest in the zombie genre, yet became captured in the social commentary and the amazing amount of questions the show creates with the situation the charactgers are in.

The world has been flipped on it's head, and death is no longer death, but a new, seemingly immortal beginning, even for those who chose to take their own lives. The questions that come to mind as I put myself into the character's minds are startling. This show could go on for years as the characters struggle with the new realities of their dead friends and family coming back to them, not only alive, but with their own intellectful needs, emotions, issues, and unanswered questions.

This isn't a great show, but it is an intriguing one. It is a BBC show which can be hard to decipher at times with the English dialect. The actors are stellar with their parts, givng them truly human, questioning personas that we would all have given the nature of their situation. I hope that this series continues to confront the moral and social dilemas that the characters are bound to face.",1374710400,,1089,4.666666666666667
5681031,5,B00BXRVQO8,"An amazing twist on the zombie genre. Very fresh and relatable, even for those who are tired of zombie films.",1373673600,,109,4.5
5681032,5,B00BXRVQO8,"I've seen a lot of zombie shows and movies.  This one brought on a whole range of emotions.  Viewers should know that while there is action and suspense, that isn't what this short series is about.  It is about prejudice and hate.  It does show radical religious views in a bad light.  Sadly there are folks that can't see past the log in their own eyes.  (A Christian reference)

Think of this as a mini series or a three part movie rather than episodes in a tv series.  We are so used to good programs being cancelled that when something comes up with only 3 episodes we assume that it was cut short and therefore not very good.  NOT with this one!  It was meant to be 3 episodes, and wraps everything up in a powerful ending.",1373414400,,728,4.248175182481752
5681033,4,B00BXRVQO8,"I like the show,  It has good stories and characters.  It answers the questions I would ask about recovering from being a zombie.",1373241600,,129,4.565217391304348
5681034,5,B00BXRVQO8,Curse the BBC for making really short mini-seasons of great shows like this and Luther.  A great concept andreally well done.,1373241600,,125,4.9523809523809526
5681035,5,B00BXRVQO8,"Remember George Romero's original zombie movies? He intended social commentary, and quite a bit of it, inside of the zombie apocalypse world. In The Flesh does the same in spades. The only thing I can complain about, is that there isn't enough of it. Three hours of this first season only gets us (viewers) into the current situation, a bit of the history, and into the main character's personality and homelife.
I've watched all 3 episodes, I still need more. What is the serum that helps rehab the zombies? What happens to the zombies that don't respond to the drug? Who is running the zombie underground group, and what are their plans?
The SFX in this series are top notch, at ""World War Z"" or ""The Walking Dead"" level. They don't disappoint.",1372550400,,746,4.659090909090909
5681036,4,B00BXRVQO8,"Unlike 'Walking Dead', I found myself empathizing with the struggles of the PDS survivors and with their suffering and well-portrayed families.",1372204800,,143,5.857142857142857
5681037,4,B00BXRVQO8,I enjoyed watching this show.  I thought the story was very interesting and a great addition to the zombie genre.,1372204800,,113,4.65
5681038,5,B00BXRVQO8,"I love it...a zombie show that is completely different than any other one before it.
My only criticism is that it too short...only three episodes...why?  I want more!!",1372118400,,167,4.964285714285714
5681039,5,B00BXRVQO8,I questioned the plot at first thinking how on earth can a show like this be good? After the first show it grabbed me. I had to watch the second and then the third. I hope there's more to come soon.,1372032000,,198,3.8536585365853657
5681040,4,B00BXRVQO8,"I went into this BBC show expecting it to be about zombies, and while it was, the main focus of the show was something much more human. It's set following a zombie rising of all those who died in 2009. The government managed to find a way to basically cure whatever reanimated the dead and they are now being re-introduced back into their old lives. They are called ""Partially Deceased Syndrome"" sufferers. Many are finding life after death more difficult then expected. They are facing many prejudices while trying to understand why they're alive again. It's really an interesting take on the whole zombie genre. It takes the monsters, the killers of most zombies movies, and spins the view around, making them the victims. I highly recommend the series.",1372032000,,755,4.8604651162790695
5681041,5,B00BXRVQO8,"I enjoyed it more then I thought I would. The trailers for show makes it to be a different show then what I saw. The trailers makes it feel like people are cool with it. The show they are far from cool with it and makes me want to more about the PDS people. What caused it,why just them and who is that guy on the internet. I liked the inter action between him and his family and his former  hunting partner. There are some slow parts and things if not in the show I do not think I would miss them. Those things may be something that makes the show for them.",1371945600,,558,3.938053097345133
5681042,5,B00BXRVQO8,"I saw the first episode and thought...it's okay. Wasn't sure about it.  Then the second episode just took off and the third episode broke my heart.  I was dumbfounded how good this series was and they left it open for more episodes.
  I am buying myself and a friend the DVD and going to share the awesomness of this show.  I hope I don't cry again at the end of the Third episode.",1371600000,10,381,4.164383561643835
5681043,5,B00BXRVQO8,"From the description, I was expecting this to be a comedy. Zombies are people with ""Partially Deceased Syndrome""--very witty. While there was a sense of humor about the situation, I instead got a heart pounding drama about small town paranoia. Even that description is selling it short. There's horror too, but a different kind than in The Walking Dead and its ilk. Every single actor does a bang up job, too. A lot of reviews, wiki articles, and the episode descriptions spoil the entire thing, so please avoid them. Just spend the $8 or whatever it is to watch these 3 episodes, you will not regret it. But set aside 3 hours of time, because you're going to want to watch all of them in a row.",1371081600,,695,4.480314960629921
5681044,1,B00BXRVQO8,kinda like watching a drama about a boring dysfunctional family but one is a zombie. not entertaining at all. no interest in attempting to watch episode 2,1371081600,2,154,4.7407407407407405
5681045,1,B00BXRVQO8,I love sci-fi and horror. I expected this to be a good combination of both. It was just awful. I would not recommend for anyone.,1371081600,2,128,4.16
5681046,4,B00BXRVQO8,"I have to say that I had high hopes for this show, followed by a bit of disappointment after the first episode, followed by generally high hopes for the second season.  I think that this show could be really good.",1371081600,,213,4.325
5681047,5,B00BXRVQO8,"I love zombies but the grunting and brain eating can get a little repetitive.  The idea behind this series is different.  A drug is discovered which makes zombieism a manageable disease, Post Death Syndrome (PDS).  Zombies are given the drug, progress is checked, and the zombies on the mend are sent back to their communities.  Yikes!",1370995200,,335,4.928571428571429
5681048,4,B00BXRVQO8,"First off, one thing to know before watching is that this isn't a traditional horror-genre show.  I've heard some people say they didn't like it, and in asking them about it, it was because they were expecting a straight-forward monster flick experience.  Which is unfortunate, because they missed out on enjoying a solidly-done little show.

It has some plot holes, which is why I only gave it 4 stars, but overall I was impressed with the story:  people who died in 2009 have arisen as zombies for unknown reasons, and it turns out it's a medically treatable condition.  The focus of the tale is on one family's experience as their son returns to them.  The twist is that they live in a small, isolated town in Northern England which is very xenophobic towards the ""rotters"".

Much of the acting is excellent, and several moments brought tears to my eyes, particularly when it dealt with the issue of what happens if your loved one, who you mourned as dead, has returned to you -- anger toward them for causing you pain, fear of losing them again, euphoria for having them back in your arms.

In summary - if you enjoy a well-done drama which dabbles its toe in the horror genre, give this a try :)",1370995200,,1200,4.5488372093023255
5681049,5,B00BXRVQO8,"We rarely get to see an original story these days, especially when the subject is zombies - excuse me, Partially Deceased Persons.
This 3 part series takes us into completely unexpected directions. Don't worry if you can't understand all the North Country accents. The actors make every twist plain to understand and only two or three characters have truly thick accents.

Best of all the BBC has announced a six part second series due in 2014. Can't wait.",1370822400,30,456,4.846153846153846
5681050,4,B00BXRVQO8,"The zombie thing has been done to death. But people still love zombies. This is an interesting twist on the old story. After a zombie invasion, the government wants to collect the zombies and medicate them. Then send them back to their communities. The zombies are given makeup and contacts to look more like the living. PDS or partialy dead syndrome is the health condition title for zombies. The community is not so forgiving. When the person is a family member the family is more accepting. It is a very interesting take on an old tale.",1370822400,,539,4.625
5681051,5,B00BXRVQO8,"this is such a fresh take on the whole zombie concept. just when i thought i'd seen everything one could do with zombies, someone came up with an unexpected twist.  that twist is that there is a cure for zombies, aka ""the partially deceased"", as the government calls them. the uk government has come up with an utterly socialist way to deal with these new ""people"". this part is so droll and ironic that you might miss it if not attuned to the nuances of this show. the whole of government apparatus springs into bureaucratic action with the reintroduction of them into society, supporting them as the newest recovering group. they must be given daily shots so as not to revert.  there is a case worker assigned to each family which is reintegrating a PD into their family household.  there is a vigilante movement of the requisite rednecks which wants to execute these PDs.  there is even an underground movement you can find online of those who hate being PDs and combine together to resume full zombiehood. this is just fantastic and so emotional if you put yourself into being the family members taking the PD back to reintegrate into the nuclear family.
