8437100,4,B004OCCL8Y,"Four stars because I liked it for all the wrong reasons.  Sixteenth Century Japan and there is an anti-Christianity movement. Our hero is a free lance lady Ninja who sides with the Christians, protecting the immortality scroll.

The fighting sequences were comically bad. The severed head was MST quality. We also have a blue-eyed female Ninja in a 16th century micro-dress with frequent up skirts of her bulky Samurai  style undies.

Perv factor: I found the nudity better than the Lady Ninja Kasumi series, but less than the Lady Ninja Kunoichi.",1462233600,,547,4.978021978021978

8437104,4,B004OCCL8Y,"I liked Memoirs of a Lady Ninja. Even though this flick has a low budget, the fight scenes are pretty good and there's sex and nudity. Not to mention, the lead actress is hot.",1373846400,4,175,4.176470588235294
8437105,5,B004OCCL8Y,"Excellent rating for an okay film. Why? Because for a B rated film the viewer gets a good storyline and the acting is far better than some mainstream films. The action scenes are fun to watch with swishing hair making sounds no hair makes and swords clinging against ninja knives like someone fighting with amplified cutlery. The story- Hiijami is a kunoichi (female ninja) who works as a mercenary. Her most frequent employer is a feudal lord who is plotting against the Shogun. It is the late sixteenth century and the tensions between the Christians and Buddhists are increasing. Hiijami catches two of the lords men trying to steal a scroll from the treasury and is framed for the theft. She falls off a cliff and is healed by a young Christian who works for a Japanese chapel. The priest recognizes her as the daughter of the woman who came to him for sanctuary several years ago. He takes Hiijami out to the garden where her mother is buried and gives her a strange knife that was her mother's. The Buddhist sect in the district want the villagers to disclaim Christianity and elimate the church. Hiijami makes them enemies and the two thieves that framed her join forces with the sect to kill her. After all the fights it comes down to Hiijami and the lord's chancellor who is revealed to be the villain behind everything. The scroll gives him the secret of immortality and will use it to become ruler of Japan. Spoiler- that strange knife that Hiijami now has might not allow him to be immortal as he thinks. So, grab a few Sapporo's and enjoy a ninj-tastic film on an afternoon.",1372291200,5,1587,4.591549295774648
