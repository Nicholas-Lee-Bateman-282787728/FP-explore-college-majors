8599473,1,B0015UTCOE,"Though this title, ""Cops,"" is rare to find as a stand alone DVD, this particular print is not worth your money.  Not only is the print quality poor, it has no sound track at all.  It is a silent ""silent movie,"" which was never the way the genre was supposed to be--all silents had background music when they were shown.  Anyway, this copy of ""Cops"" looks like a bootleg copy from another source.  It is a bad deal--one might almost say, criminally bad.",1299801600,,452,4.409638554216867
