1392150,5,B0000541SA,"This release of 10 episodes is  great for all you Friends fans out there. Hopefully WB will release the entire series soon, as they have done in Europe. I have seasons 1 through 6 on DVD, and I gotta say that this is the only way to go if you truly love the show. Don't get me wrong, the quality and contents of these discs are great, but write WB and tell them to release everything!",977356800,4,384,4.052631578947368
1392151,4,B0000541SA,"For some reason, ""Star Trek"" - in all it's various incarnations - seems to be just about the one show on television that actually sells well on video.  True, the trend in TV-to-video does seem to be picking up with ""The Avengers"", ""The X-Files"" and ""Sex in the City"", but mainstream sitcoms, on the whole, do not seem to have done well in the past.  Warner Brothers seems to be hoping this trend will change by releasing ""Friends"" on video and DVD - it has already worked in Britain - and I, for one, hope they succeed here.
The boxed set that they have released on DVD is well worth the purchase....  Included with the 10 episodes (13 if you count two-parters separately) are features on the famous London episode where Ross gets married, cast and crew info and the Rembrandt's music video.  Not a bad deal.  Each episode is also supposed to have extra previously unscreened footage.  I don't doubt that they do, but not knowing the episodes by heart, I was unable to tell what was added and what was not.  I could go into detail about the episodes, but the odds are that if you're really interested in buying the DVD, you probably know the episodes.
The big complaint that has surfaced about the release is that people wish the series would be released season-by-season as it is done in Britain and as has been done in the US for shows like ""The X-Files"" and ""The Sopranos"".  I agree.  Even at two or three times the price, it would still, in my opinion, be a reasonable deal for a 22 or 24 episode season of ""Friends"".  Perhaps Warner Brothers is still trying to gauge consumer interest by releasing a ""trial"" set before going on to try a season-by-season release.  The last series they tried to release in its entirety - ""Babylon 5"", seems to have faltered after releasing about half the episodes.
Either way, the DVD set is well worth the purchase.  For me, it will be a great way to kill a few hours on a plane ride using my laptop's DVD player.  If you're a big fan of the series, this is well worth owning.  Perhaps enough people buying the ""Best of"" collection will persuade Warner Brothers to try a wider scale release.  Go for it.",977184000,9,2141,4.439897698209719

1392153,5,B0000541SA,"Friends is one of the most original shows on  television. The sign of a good tv show is that it doesn't decline in quality when it ages. Friends just gets funnier and the episodes chosen for this set are evidence of this. You get Disc 1: The Pilot, The One With Two Parts (One Hour), The One With All the Poker, The One Where Ross Finds Out, and The One With the Prom Video. Disc 2: The One Where No One's Ready, The One With the Embryos, The One With Ross's Wedding (One Hour), The One With the Thanksgiving Flashbacks, and The One Where Everybody Finds Out From The Pilot, in which we meet the six friends to TOW Everybody Finds out, where the gang finds out about the relationship between Monica and Chandler, these episodes will make you laugh.  The One with the Thanksgiving Flashbacks is an exceptional one, it centers around Thanksgivings of the past from Pheobe's memories of the Civil war and WWI to the year when Chandler's father ran away with the houseboy to the consecutive years when Chandler calls Monica fat and Chandler loses his toe.  We can only hope that Monica, Phoebe, Rachel, Chandler, Ross and Joey will continue to be as funny as they are now and that Warner Brothers will release another Friends DVD. Here is a quote from TOW the Poker Rachel: Hey, look, you guys, I'm going for anything here, OK? I cannot be a waitress anymore, I mean it. I'm sick of the lousy tips, I'm sick of being called 'Excuse me...' Ross: Rach, did you proofread these? Rachel: Uh... yeah, why? Ross: Uh, nothing, I'm sure they'll be impressed with your excellent compuper skills. Rachel: (upset) Oh my Goood! Oh, do you think it's on all of them?

1392166,5,B0000541SA,"Friends has been a television powerhouse since we first met the gang at Central Perk in 1994. It was obvious right from the beginning that these were people we were going to like and watch for years. It was also obvious that these actors were a strong bunch of people with instant charm and chemistry. This two volume collection contains some great episodes. You get the Pilot episode which, if you haven't seen lately, is a real hoot to see them looking so different. You get hilarious episodes like ""The One Where No One's Ready"", which is kind of seinfeldian in a way. But, the top episodes is ""The One With The Prom Video"". A classic!. These people really don't get enough credit. It's a shame. They have impeccable timing. It's always dead on and pitch perfect. This is a real treat for fans who want to own a bit of their favorite friends.",1004313600,,845,4.4935064935064934

1392168,5,B0000541SA,"Friends is probably the best written and best acted television show in the past decade and this wonderful collection proves that. It contains some of the best episodes from the past 7 years. Included are when Rachel and Ross kiss, when the gang plays poker, the Thanksgiving flashbacks, and the best episode when the gitls lose the apartment to the guys. As you watch the episodes you can see each character grow and the chemisty build and build making them one of the best ensembles ever on tv. This is a tape you can watch over and over again and still find the same jokes funny, especially Lisa Kudrow who is hysterical and steals many scenes in almost evry episode. No disappointments on this box set, except I wish there were more, but Vol 3 and 4 will be coming out soon.",1001289600,3,777,4.47887323943662
1392169,5,B0000541SA,"I just recentaley got into Friends about a year ago because being only in high school when the series began I was in elmantary school and therefore was watching cartoons instead. This box set was a great way to help me catch up since I had probably seen less than 30 episodes before this came out. I think that these 10 best box sets are a better way of releasing Friends episodes than complete seasons because this way it is alot more affordable and you get nothing but the best instead of getting a few dud episodes which this show does have. Lets go through the episodes. I have given them letter grades.
The Pilot-B+, We are introduced to all the Freinds and get to know their personalities. While this isn't the best ep. from season one it is pretty vital to this box set. Best line is Chandler: Want to help us put Ross' furniture together, Phoebe: oh I wish I could but I don't wanna.
The one with two parts-A+, One of my all time favorite Friends episodes ever. Monica and Rachael's insuarnce fraud is hilarous as well as Chandler's relationship with Nina. This is the best episode from season one and whats even better is that it is an hour long.
The one with all the poker-A, Great episode in which we get to see the Friends get a little competive. Its so funny to see the Girls trying to play poker and Chandler has some of his best lines in this episode. Phoebe is also hilarious in this episode and her best line is when she gets her cards and says ""YES"" then realizing that she is giving away her cards calmly says""or no"".
The one where Ross finds out-A-, This classic ep. from season 2 had Ross and Rachael's first kiss. The best scene is where Rachael goes on a date with a guy named Michael and drinks to much wine.
The one with the prom video-B, This episode is probably the weakest one out of the ten but Joey and Chandler's friendship braclets are hilarious. Best line Chandler: Its easy for you to say you don't have to go around sporting a Mr. T reject from the Liberatchi house of Crap.
The one where no one is ready-A, The one episode from season 3 proves to be one of the best. Like the poker ep. the friends spend just about the whole half hour with each other and that is when they are at there best. Also Monica's message on Richard's machine is a gut buster. Rachael also looks incredibly hot in her green dress.
The one with the embryos-A-, Phoebe decideds to be a surrogate mother for her brother and his wife but it is the trivia game between Chandler and Joey and Monica and Rachael that really propells this ep. The best part is when the girls can't figure out what Chandler does for a living.
The one with Ross's wedding-B+, Although a classic and funny episode, not giving us the third part to this episode detracts it a grade and makes it less wathcable. Luckly I taped the 3rd part off of tv soon after.
The one with all the Thanksgivings-A-, Classic thanksgiving episode in which all the friends share their worst thanksgivings ever. Joey's head stuck in a turkey is the best flashback.
The one where everybody finds out-A+, The best episode of Friends ever. I couldn't stop laughing. Everyone with the exception of Ross was at their best in this ep. and this shows that after 5 years Friends is better than ever.
Well I hoped this helped and I can't wait for the new box set which looks like it has other great episodes aswell.",1001203200,9,3367,4.371610845295056
1392170,2,B0000541SA,"If you're a ""friends"" fan like I am, dont' get the ""Best of Friends""... In Europe, Japan, and Taiwan, a complete collection of every season, including every episode, is everywhere. That's what we call collection. I don't get why people in The States and Canada don't get to have equal access to those DVDs yet. There are only 6 or 7 episodes in each volume. I don't deny those are of the best ones. Yet to a fan, every episode is remarkable and thus shouldn't have ever been left out. If you get this two-volume DVD set, you're going to be trapped into the following situations: Where's the episode I miss the most? Or Where's the one I happened to miss because I was late that night when it was on TV? You don't want to be in such a scene, do you? So, here's the advice from someone who's been there: DON""t GET THEM. BE PATIENT. WAIT FOR THE COMPLETE COLLECTION TO BE RELEASED.

1392171,5,B0000541SA,"Being a long-time fan of the television show ""Friends"", I attacked this ""Best of..."" package with relish! It includes ten of the producers best episodes, all with deleted scenes reattached and done in digital dolby. Though I expected this two-disc set to come with a series of outtakes, which I heard are quite hilarious, it is a definite must-have even without them. Drawing from episodes all the way up to ""The One With Ross's Wedding"", in which he inadvertantly mutters Rachel's name in his wedding vows, and setting into motion the events that would carry the last season of the show (Monica and Chandler), these gems are worth owning, and I can't wait for the rest to be released on DVD!",998611200,,692,4.7272727272727275
1392172,4,B0000541SA,"This box set includes the ten best episodes of Friends, as determined by an online survey (how come I never heard about this?) The episodes are definitely great ones, but some are not the ones I would pick. Also, I can't really feel happy for Ross when he says, ""I just grabbed a spoon,"" or when he kisses Rachel for the first time, because I know how it's going to end. Plus, now that Rachel is the only friend that I have grown to hate, things I laughed at the first time I saw them are now just annoying.
If you're wondering why I don't like Rachel, consider this: I admit that Ross was equally at fault for the first time they broke up, but then Rachel wreaks their chances of ever getting back together by making him say that she had absolutely nothing to do with the break-up. Hey, I'm pretty sure Ross wouldn't have slept with the xerox slut if Rachel had acknowleged their anniversary at all. It takes two to make a relationship go wrong. Also, she takes every oppurtunity to remind him she still has a grudge and will never get back together with him, but still apparantly cares enough about him to ruin every relationship he's had since. And since this isn't Seinfeld and relationships mean something, that's just wrong.
Also, it goes without saying that it's a bad sign when one of the DVD highlights is interactive menus.
Still, all 10 episodes are gems, and you'll definitely laugh at least once during all of them.",997920000,,1428,4.475095785440613

Ever since then, I couldn't miss any episode even it's rerun. I even started looking for soundtracks and the odd songs that Phoebe made. These friends washed out my stress from work every night.

1392174,1,B0000541SA,"As the title of this review suggests, it is very hard for me to express in words how vile this set of programs is.  The series presents a vacuous approach to the comic, creating a tediously secure and trivial set of uninteresting bores who converse dully for half an hour to rid teenagers of their angst for said period of time.  The rock interludes are sickening, again attempting to justify the boringly shallow existences of the irritating protagonists.  I despise this series for a plethora of reasons: it is boring, not at all comic, trivial and vapid.  Utterly dire.",995241600,,572,4.747474747474747

1392177,5,B0000541SA,"Friends, is undoubtedly one of the very best American sitcoms in a long time. A group of friends all living in the same apartment block may sound like a plot for an old fashioned comedy but it hits contemporary times perfectly whilst always strongly retaining a fun, feel good factor. David Schwimmer and Lisa Kudrow can always raise a smile with their dizzy, scatter brained characterisations whilst the rest of the cast such as Jennifer Aston, Courtney Cox and Matt Le Blanc simply gell brilliantly together, giving it a very warm, natural quality.
Every episode on here is absolutley fantastic! They represent the series possibly at it's ultimate finest. The sparkling scripts bubbles along with razor sharp wit and is complimented by its delivery of these talented bunch of actors. The characters are all loveable than ever. A great pleasure to watch and this sitcom ranks up in the list of classics following in the footsteps of other great U.S sitcoms such as Cheers, The Golden Girls and Roseanne. The series has enjoyed triumphant popularity on both sides of the Atlantic. Just viewing any one of these episodes will let you truly appreciate why this series continues to be a smash hit. Fans will be delighted! Highly Recommended!",991526400,,1238,4.956730769230769

But it has warmth and charm to it. Also, bubbly Lisa Kudrow, sex-crazed Matt LeBlanc, the two fiances (Matthew Perry and Courteney Cox Arquette), silly Ross, and just plain Jennifer Aniston are the oddballs in this genially entertaining sitcom, with entertaining appearances by Julia Roberts (I love that woman), George Clooney, and Helen Hunt (I love that sexy woman, too).",989712000,,607,5.141414141414141
1392180,5,B0000541SA,"I only recently started watching 'Friends', and I was greatful for this DVD, because it allowed me to watch some of the older episodes, as well as flash back episodes which helped me put all of the jokes together. Not only did this collection document the shows story lines develop, but it also documented how much the show itself developed. In the beginning it was truly a show about nothing, now, it has elaborate themes, jokes and inside jokes which only the seasoned 'Friends' watchers can enjoy. Buying this insures that you get the episodes you know and love forever. It also insures that you get a good quality filming of it.
Pilot- A wonderful intro to 'Friends'. It gives a flavor of all that Friends is. 1. Rachel has a dilemma after running out on her wedding. 2. Monica has boyfriend trouble, 3. Ross has a hysterical crisis after a divorce. It has all three of the kinds of plots and story lines you can expect from friends.
The One with the Two Parts- A delightful hour about virtually nothing. An hour of pure laughs and hysteria! No 'Friends' fan can go without this one!
The One with all the Poker- The name speaks for itself...another very funny one!
The One Where Ross Finds Out- Amazing! Hysterical! Just watch it!
The One with the Prom Video- One of the most serious shows in the group, but still, hysterical.
The One Where No One's Ready- Another classic example of the Friends about nothing, a true classic.
The One With the Embryos- A 'Friends' classic. Who can forget the famous bet between Monica/Rachel and Joey/Chandler? Miss Chanadaler Bong suggests you see it.
The One With Ross's Wedding- Obviously a must-see!
The One With All the Thanksgivings- A wonderful flash back episode of things you knew and didn't know!
The One Where Everybody Finds Out- One of my favorite all time friends. Everybody Finds out is in reference to Monica and Chandler, and it is hysterical!
I hope this review helps in pursuading you to buy this wonderful, useful product.",989193600,,1980,4.692528735632184
1392181,5,B0000541SA,"If you are a fan of the hit TV show, ""Friends"", you must have this set, on either VHS or DVD. The DVD does give you a clearer picture than even the TV show could give you, but both formats have the same thing. Each epiosde has little snippets from the show that have never been seen before, which makes the episodes even funnier. I am a fan of volume 2 because my favorite is ""The One With The Embryos"" (or, as I call it, ""The One With The Game Show""). Volume 1 has a few I don't particularly care for, such as the pilot (or First episode) and  ""The One With Two Parts"" where we meet Phoebe's (Lisa Kudrow)sister, Ursula (also played by Kudrow).The other cast members (Jennifer Aniston, Courtney Cox, Matt LeBlanc, David Schwimmer, and especially Matthew Perry), are just funny and brilliant. Other episodes include ""The One Where No One's Ready"" , ""The One Where Everyone Finds Out""(both Vol. 2), ""The One With All The Poker"", and ""The One With The Prom Video"" (both Vol. 1).

1392182,5,B0000541SA,"This two-volume set, actually just a boxed set of both previously released ""Best of"" volumes, collects the top 10 episodes of the hit comedy as decided by the fans.  Here's a quick rundown of the episodes:
Volume One:
1. Pilot (9/22/94).  THE very first episode of Friends where we meet the whole gang.  Runaway bride Rachel returns to become Monica's roommate.
2. The One With Two Parts (3/2/95).  Two-part episode where Ross confronts his anxiety over becoming a dad, Monica and Rachel meet two cute doctors from the ER (guest stars those guys from ER), Joey dates Phoebe's twin Ursula and Ross' monkey causes havoc.
3. The One With All the Poker (2/23/95).  A battle of the sexes as the girls challenge the guys to poker.
4. The One Where Ross Finds Out (11/9/95).  Rachel admits her feelings for Ross after her jealousy over Julie and Ross' decision to have a cat.  Also, Monica works out Chandler to death.
5. The One With The Prom Video (2/1/96).  Classic flashback episode to high school.  A video of Rachel and Monica getting ready for the Prom is the catalyst to Ross and Rachel's first ""get together.""
Volume Two:
1. The One Where No One's Ready (9/26/96):  The gang can't decide what to wear to Ross' function, plus Monica copes with her break up.
2. The One With The Embryos (1/15/98):  Phoebe agrees to carry her brother's baby.
3. The One With Ross's Wedding (5/7/98):  Classic two-parter where the gang goes to London for Ross's wedding to Emily.  Plus, Ross's big flub at the end.
4. The One With All the Thanksgivings (11/19/98):  Or perhaps a better title would be, ""The Ghost of Thanksgivings Past?""  Another great flashbacks episode where the gang relives Thanksgivings of the past.  More development in the Chandler/Monica relationship.
5. The One Where Everybody Finds Out (2/11/99):  Hilarious episode as Phoebe plays with Chandler's mind.  The cats finally outta the bag once everyone finds out about Monica and Chandler's clandestine relationship.  Plus, Ross acquires the Naked Man's apartment.
Exclusive DVD features:  Cast bios (both volumes), the Rembrandt's ""I'll Be There For You"" music video (both volumes), behind the scenes on location footage of Friends' tour in London (on volume 2), plus additional footage for each episode. (Honestly, I can't tell the difference...)
Here's my quick rundown:
Good:  NO COMMERCIALS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  The extras on the DVD were a great bonus. The Cast bios were a great and interesting read. The behind the scenes footage in London was also pretty interesting.  The Rembrandt video was pretty cool too.  Definitely a plus.
So-so:  The additional footage?  Me personally, I can't really tell the difference but I guess that makes it a plus.
Bad:  Nothing!!!
I like the fact that they released these episodes on DVD.  The replay value, like most sitcoms, is awesome.  It's just like watching Friends syndicated reruns on your local station but without the commercials and with a better picture.  Personally, I think the DVD is a good investment to your DVD collection.  Unlike taping your favorite episodes off the air, the DVD won't get ""eaten"" from constant replay.
Must have for a Friends fan?  Not necessarily -- but it definitely won't hurt :)

Therefore, it is with great surprise, that I have to have this DVD.  I watched it this weekend and I swear, I had to stop eating, I was laughing so hard, I was afraid that I would choke!  This collection is a great introduction to someone like me, who has only watched maybe 5 episodes at most.
-  The pilot episode, where Rachel leaves her groom at the alter and moves in with Monica.
-  Ross and lamaze classes.  Joey dates Phobee's sister (the birthday cake scene is the best!) -Helen Hunt, George Clooney make guest appearances
-  The girls learn to play poker, Ross is coming to grips with his feelings for Rachel.
-  Ross and Julie go to get a cat, and Rachel realizes that she has feelings for him. I think that this is Ross & Rachel's 1st kiss.
-  The Prom video - flashbacks
- Ross has an important presentation and no one seems to notice.
- London - the Wedding.
-  Phobee goes to meet her biological dad and meets the dog instead!
-  Thanksgiving - flashbacks - I will never look at a turkey again without picturing those sunglasses.
-  Phobee agrees to have her brother's baby
-  The Fat man's apartment.  Everyone finds out about Monica & Chandler.",980812800,6,1270,4.371794871794871

1392192,4,B0000541SA,"I was disappointed that WB chose not to release Friends an entire season at a time.  I had planned on not purchasing this set; however, the mood struck and I made an impulsive decision to buy.  While I enjoyed the discs very much, I much prefer sets containing complete seasons of a television series.
The quality of the image is very good, comparable to what one might see with digital cable or a DBS.  The additional footage is a real bonus, adding about two to five minutes to most of the episodes.  While most of the jokes and one-liners that were cut do not contribute significantly, others are absolutely priceless.
Unfortunately, other than the extra footage, the discs contain few extras.  Especially annoying is the lack of chapter stops.  To jump to a specific location (e.g. to return to an episode you were watching earlier) or to skip the opening titles, you must fast-forward or jump to a specific time.  The only exception is the two-part London episode, which contains a single chapter stop for each part.
Another problem with the set is that even though the London story arc consists of three episodes, only the first two are included.  This leaves an important cliffhanger unresolved.  The ending of ""The One Where Everybody Finds Out"" also serves as a cliffhanger, but luckily it can stand on its own.
For a casual fan of the show, this ""Best of"" set would be a great way to see a few highlights of the series.  More serious fans might want to wait to see if WB decides to release the series in its entirety.",979171200,7,1527,4.601476014760148

Colors are vivid, but it is blurry for a dvd release, and poor product for the price. I A/B'ed the dvd with a broadcast rerun (on direct tv) and found the clarity to be inferior, in fact poor.

1392194,5,B0000541SA,"When Friends premiered in the fall of 1994, it was an immediate hit.  Not only was it a success on the television, you couldn't escape the six Friends as they were on every magazine cover, the theme song was constantly playing on the radio and Friends merchandise flooded the stores.  What was sometimes lost in all this mega-hype is that Friends is one of the most cleverly written and well acted shows around.  The six actors, Jennifer Aniston, Courtney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry & David Swimmer, are all instantly likeable and have superb comic stylings.  It is very difficult to whittle down to the ten best shows from over 100 episodes, but the set does a good job.  It has a heavy concentration on the first season with of course the Pilot episode and numerous episodes concerning the Ross-Rachel relationship.  ""The One With All The Thanksgivings"" contains some hysterical flashbacks while ""The One Where No One's Ready"" may be the best episode of them all.  Taking place all within a half-hour, each cast member gets a chance to shine, as Ross anxiously waits for everyone to get ready to go to an important benefit for the museum.  Friends has been on the air for seven and has been consistently funny from day one.  This set is testament to the show's greatness.",978912000,7,1292,4.732142857142857

A nice little bonus:  there are two episodes included that were actually double episodes so it really holds 12 episodes.  My only quibble with the DVD is the lack of extras.  The music video is nice, but the cast bios are lacking in details (according to this, Matt Leblanc has never made a movie!).  Overall, an excellent buy!",978652800,,586,4.631067961165049

1392203,5,B0000541SA,"When it first appeared on television back in 1993, I wasn't much of a fan of this popular NBC series. Maybe it was that it was because it didn't have the wise-cracking, satirical humor that I have become accustomed to after watching shows like ""The Simpsons"" and ""Married With Children"" for years. However, as the years went through, ""Friends"" became a favorite of mine via the many late-night reruns on syndication.
In what has become a very popular trend in recent months, the producers of ""Friends"" have decided to release a box set of the series 10 best episodes on DVD and VHS. Much in the same manner as many series that have been released on both video formats in the past few months (e.g. ""Sex & the City""; ""The Sopranos""; etc.) this box set captures the best of the show and its' great cast. Jennifer Aniston (""The Object of Affection""), Matthew Perry (""Fools Rush In""), Courtney Cox -Arquette (""Scream"" trilogy), Matt LeBlanc (""Lost in Space"" 1998 film version), Lisa Kudrow (""Hanging Up""), and David Schwimmer (""The Pallbearer) all were relatively small-role actors before being casted on this series, and now they are superstars in their own right.
Among the best ten episodes, I rank ""The One With Ross's Wedding"", ""The One With All the Thanksgiving"", ""The One Where Everybody Finds Out"", ""The One With the Prom Video"" and ""The One With All The Poker"" as the top five episodes in this box set. All were great and the cast, especially Lisa Kudrow's funny antics, make this a must have for television-philes of 1990's comedy series.
The ""Best of Friends"" box set will make a great gift or addition to your video library. Besides the episodes, the DVD version contains the music video by the ""Rembrandts"" playing the series title song, subtitles, and Cast biographies. So, if you haven't purchased a DVD player yet, do so now if you truly want to take advantage of this great format (hint: Amazon sells DVD players).",977529600,,1926,4.786786786786787

There are 5 commercial free episodes on eacb disc, and they are truly among the best of shows; some have extra footage not seen when aired on TV.  In case some of the titles (listed in the editorial review) don't ""click"" with you, ""...Two Parts"" has Joey dating Ursula, Phoebe's twin sister, and Monica & Rachel switching identities in the ER; and ""...The Embryos"" is when Phoebe is impregnated and the boys & girls bet apartments.  The only complaint I have is with the 2-part, Ross & Emily's wedding episode; in the end, we're left with Ross saying ""I take thee Rachel"" and the little cliffhanger of will Emily, or will Emily not, finish the wedding?  The omission of the ""third episode - the aftermath & everbody goes home"" from the DVD borders on criminal.  Also, the extra features aren't much to brag about - 2 short blurbs on filming on location in London and the Rembrandts' music video (argh!)...oh, and a cast bio.

VOLUME ONE
1. Pilot (9/22/94): This is the best first episode of America's favourite comedy, showing how Rachel came to live with Monica. This ep sets the mood for the rest of the series.
2. The One With Two Parts (3/2/95). Two-part episode where Monica and Rachel date two doctors, both guest stars from the hit series ER (George Clooney and Noah Wyle).
3. The One With All the Poker (2/23/95). The girls challenge the guys to a game of poker only to lose all of their money more than once... Rachel starts applying for jobs
4. The One Where Ross Finds Out (11/9/95). Ross and Julie decide to buy a cat but a drunken Rachel leaves a phone message for Ross confessing her feelings about him, hence Ross finally finds out how Rachel feels.
5. The One With The Prom Video (2/1/96). One of the fun flashback episodes to when the guys are in high school, getting ready for the prom. Hilarious shots of Rachel, Monica and Ross when they were teenagers!
VOLUME TWO
1. The One Where No One's Ready (9/26/96): Ross stresses out as no one is ready for his museum benefit. Monica finds a message from Richard and can't decide if it's old or new - so she leaves him a msg on his answering machine with disastrous results.
2. The One With The Embryos (1/15/98): Phoebe agrees to carry her brother's baby while the rest of the gang argue about which duo knows the other one better - Chandler and Joey or Monica and Rachel. They settle it with an hilarious game hosted by Ross!
3. The One With Ross's Wedding (5/7/98): Another two-parter where the gang head over to London for Ross' wedding with Emily. The start of Chandler and Monica's relationship, as well as the demise of Ross and Emily's.
4. The One With All the Thanksgivings (11/19/98): Another hilarious flashback episode where the gang relive past Thanksgivings with some of the gang discovering ghosts of the past...
5. The One Where Everybody Finds Out (2/11/99): A personal favourite, when Phoebe finds out about Chandler and Monica and decides to ""mess with them"". Ross applies for Ugly Naked Guy's apartment.
Apart from the obvious benefit of NO COMMERCIALS - YES!!, the extra features on this DVD are fantastic! It includes a music video of the Friends theme by the Rembrandts featuring the main cast from the tv show, a behind the scenes look at filming in London, commentary from the production team and cast bios.

I have had the set since it first came out and I'm still not tired of it yet.  Friends is probably the funniest show on television, and its still going strong.  If you like Friends, I recommend this collection for you, it highlights the classic moments, such as Ross getting Rachel's message, Rachel seeing the Prom video, all the Thanksgivings, and others such as that.",1041206400,2,526,4.811111111111111
7930448,5,B0000541SA,"These two volumes present ""The Best of 'Friends'"" as ""chosen by fans.""  Volume 1 centers on the stormy relationship between Ross and Rachel:
(1)  ""Pilot"" (September 22, 1994), a.k.a. ""The One Where Rachel Does Not Get Married.""  For the first time we meet the gang at Central Perk, where runaway bride Rachel suddenly drops into their lives.  Selected as #47 by TV Guide in their list of ""The 50 Best 'Friends' Moments.""
(2)  ""The One With two Parts, Part 1 & Part 2"" (February 23, 1995), is simply an episode where the deuces are wild.  First of all we have Phoebe and her twin Urusla.  Then we have those two hunky doctors Rachel and Monica run into at the hospital.  Add to that Marcel choking on a scrabble tile, and you can see why this story was too big for one episode.
(3)  ""The One with All the Poker"" (March 2, 1995), finds the girls joining the boys for poker.  The tension for the episode comes from the fact that Rachel wants a new job and Ross wants Rachel.  Can a hand of poker constitute a first date?
(4)  ""The One Where Ross Finds Out"" (November 9, 1995), reminds us that if you drink, then do not leave phone messages.  What Ross finds out is that Rachel is over him (all together now: ""When were you under me?"").  #9 on TV Guide's list, this is the episode that shows that two ships cannot just keep passing in the night for all eternity.
(5)  ""The One With the Prom Video"" (February 1, 1966), provides not only our first flashback trip down memory lane to what Ross, Monica and Rachel were like way back when, it also has the best kiss in the show's history.  The mix of comedy and pathos makes this a perfect episode for a steak & lobster dinner.  This episode is #2 on the TV Guide list, although it was the only ""Friends"" episode to make the magazines list of Top Television Moments of all time.
However, by the time we get to Volume 2 Ross and Rachel will be suffering through the consequences of what happened when they were (or were not) on a ""break"":
(1) ""The One Where No One's Ready"" (September 26, 1996) proves something we should have all known from the start.  You can do an entire episode of ""Friends"" watching Rachel get dressed (this is foreshadowed by the photo on the cover of Volume 1 where Jennifer Aniston is only wearing a sheet).  The only problem is that this is Ross's big night and he is not making it any easier on her or anybody else.  The only episode on this DVD that is not on TV Guide's list of ""The Top 50 'Friends' Moments.'""
(2) ""The One with the Embryos"" (January 15, 1998), but Phoebe's womb is not as interesting in this episode as the trivia game going on in Monica and Rachel's apartment.  At stake: Monica and Rachel's apartment.  Fess up: you didn't know the answer to the big stumper question either.  Ranks #18 on TV Guide's list.
(3) ""The One with Ross's Wedding, Parts 1 & 2 (May 7, 1998) provides the best ""Friends"" cliffhanger (yes, even better than this year's ""Ok"").  Rachel goes over to England to stop Ross's wedding, but he manages to do just fine without her help.  Loose lips can sink more things than ships.  This one ranked #39 on the TV Guide list.
(4)  ""The One with All the Thanksgivings"" (November 19, 1998) is a flashback trip down memory lane where we find out ever reason Chandler has to hate Thanksgiving, from his Flock of Seagulls haircut to the amputation of a toe.  TV Guide ranked this moment #29.
(5)  ""The One Where Everybody Finds Out"" (February 11, 1999) is quite simple to explain.  Joey and Rachel know about Monica and Chandler, but then Phoebe finds out, but Monica and Chandler do not know that Phoebe knows, but then Phoebe hits on Chandler so they know but she does not know that they know.  And then...  This episode ranks #5 on TV Guide's list, although I think it is probably the funniest ""Friends"" episode ever.  Well, okay, so far.
This volume includes ADDED FOOTAGE and the Rembrandt's ""Ill Be There For You"" music video.  The next pair of volumes in this DVD series claim to present ""fan favorites.""  Again, there is plenty of room for fans of the show to quibble about what has been included and what has not.

It was a cliff hanger - and it was REALLY a cliff hanger on these tapes - the second part doesn't come immediately after the first part - it comes after some other footage.  That was extremely aggrivating.  And some of the funniest episodes were left out and replaced by more familiar (read: I've seen them a hundred times in reruns) episodes.  I bought this as a gift for my husband, and he's content with watching the same ten episodes over and over and over and OVER!  But I'm not - I'd rather watch the reruns - complete with annoying commercials.
