2040009,4,B0001WTW8S,"I love most of the donut man shows & my 4yr, 3yr, & 18 month old do as well, however  the first segment of ""the donut all-stars"" discusses divorce. I don't want my kid's worrying about their dad leaving in a divorce like the little boy in this segment. I know it's a reality of life but I would prefer my kids not worry about their parent's relationship.",1388361600,2,354,4.205882352941177
2040010,5,B0001WTW8S,When my kids were little they absolutely loved watching the Donut Man DVD's.  We have all of the DVD's and highly recommend them to people who like good clean christian songs/shows for their kids.  Good biblical lessons and songs. My kids are now teenagers and they still love the Donut Man.  I can't wait till I have grandchildren to spoil with the DVD's,1360713600,,355,4.603174603174603
2040011,5,B0001WTW8S,"And my 2 year old does too!! The songs are great- very encouraging, Biblical and fun! Our daughter claps along, and tries to do the motions to the songs! She gets so excited whenever we turn ""Donut Man"" on! I appreciate that his videos have positive messages about Jesus Christ and teach good values! The ""At the Zoo"" show has a song about obeying your parents- what more could you ask for in a video?!?! :-) I highly recommend these videos!!!",1360713600,,443,4.481481481481482
2040012,5,B0001WTW8S,We love all of the Donut Man videos. We are excited about adding this one to our library! This video gave us two in one and we love them both!,1335139200,2,142,3.7666666666666666
2040013,5,B0001WTW8S,"I ordered two of these, but sadly only one came.  It's a walk down a meaningful memory lane for my daughters who are now raising their children.  It's still as good.",1326844800,2,165,4.290322580645161
2040014,3,B0001WTW8S,"Is it Christian, yes.  Is it for a child under 5, not really.  The zoo dvd starts off with the kids being scared going to the zoo.  That concept isn't even in my childs life yet. Also the other story had the lion eating the baby lamb, another concept that is to big for a little one (3) to understand.  I immediately took it out of the dvd player and said, maybe in a few years.  Seems like the only safe series is Barney, just wish it was Christian. Even veggie tales is too much to understand at this age.",1314144000,,507,4.03
2040015,5,B0001WTW8S,"I have 6 kids now, and all of them love and have loved the Donut Man dvd's (and videos).  I wish there were more children's videos out there like this today.  Rob Evans isn't making them anymore, but I wish he still was.  Having the movies on dvd is a must for every family with young kids.",1294012800,3,290,4.052631578947368

2040017,4,B0001WTW8S,"My aunt asked me to buy this for my nephew. At a bookstore where it was out of stock, the salesman suggested an alternative, saying Veggie Tales offered better, more contemporary options. All I can say is that when I delivered this to my 2-year-old nephew, he paid more attention to this than to any of the other videos in his collection, dancing along as the kids danced their way through the zoo and excitedly pointing out the animals.",1168732800,2,437,4.544303797468355

Kids get to sing along and march around with the Donut Man and the message is positive with many a lesson to learn about the animals, nature, creation and The Creator.  Teaches kids how to live and be stars for the Lord.",1444521600,,359,4.25

2040060,5,B0001WTW8S,"I LOVE the DVD Versions(we had VHS for years for my kids and I loaned them out yet, learned later that they sold them in a garage sale.  Anyway, the cost on Amazon is so much less, compared to purchasing them in a Faith-based book/gift store and the BEST reason to get them here is for the GREAT messages, stories and songs which can be passed onto my grandchildren (I still love the stories and songs too).  Thank you!",1432252800,,419,4.291139240506329
