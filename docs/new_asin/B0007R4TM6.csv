2236026,4,B0007R4TM6,"As a Danish-speaking American, I'm always looking for good films that provide opportunities to hear Danes speaking Danish.  This is not the type of film I usually enjoy (films like Italiensk for begyndere, and just about anything of Bille August, are more to my taste)... but something about the reviews made it seem worth trying - and I'm glad I got it, because it's FUNNY!

As another reviewer mentioned, it's very Scandinavian humor - and there is a LOT of violence in the film.  The scenes with the English-speaking ""American"", especially the one at the end of the movie, were the only disappointments - the movie did a fine job with its message of ""no matter what you do in life, it's ok as long as you meant well"" without those distracting elements.

Well-acted, well-filmed and highly entertaining!",1198108800,,805,4.811594202898551

2236028,5,B0007R4TM6,"as a danish girl i heard about the movie from my brother who lives in denmark. i ordered it and was hooked.. i just LOVE this movie, its funny and crazy.

it has the typical scandinavian humor in it, but i think most people will understand it though.

i can only recommend people to buy or rent this movie, its great, refreshing, funny, no, not funny, hysterical!!

the only thing i don't like is the translation, i believe that its almost impossible to translate the humor into another language.  but this is a problem many movies have, not only this one...",1155859200,5,558,4.4950495049504955

8050890,4,B0007R4TM6,"""In China They Eat Dogs"" is a Danish film directed by Lasse Spang Olsen. This is an extremely funny action movie about a Arvid (Dejan Cukic) who has misgivings about having sent a bank robber to jail. Arvid is attacked by a woman who claims to be the bank robber's wife. She explains that they had needed the money for artificial insemination since they were not able to have a child otherwise. Arvid's guilt about sending the man to jail leads him to seek out his brother, Harald (Kim Bodnia) who is a criminal, in order to steal money so that the woman can have the artificial insemination. They then attempt to break the man out of prison, and almost kill him in the process, all the while Vuk (sounds like puke), is suffering one injury after another while assisting in these capers. After breaking the bank robber out of jail they discover that the woman was actually lying. She was his sister, not his wife. So it turns out they had done everything for not. This leads to another series of crazy events as innocent victims get in the way and the body count builds all leading to a grand shootout and its surprising ending. This film reminded me somewhat of ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"", with its manic energy, and various twists and turns.

The film seems to be about Arvid learning that there are no barriers in life except for those that one places upon themselves. In a country, like China, it is okay to eat dogs, whereas in European or North American societies, it is thought of as repulsive. As the film progresses the mild, and boring Arvid, gradually transforms into a character who sets his own code of morals,  which don't necessarily fit in with the norms set by his society. Anarchy ensues as one thing leads to another in this highly entertaining film.",1257379200,5,1780,4.559375
8050891,5,B0007R4TM6,"If there ever was a film that talks about moral ambiguities of the today's modern world and decisions that we - as individuals make daily, then this is the one.  This dark comedy takes us into a life of an average person, bank teller, whose life changes irreversibly in a matter of seconds.  One little decision leads him to re-unite with his estranged older brother for many years past, who happens to be a felon.  Suddenly, his closest circle of friends is bunch of characters that are mix of sociopaths and Serbian thugs.  You will enjoy the dark humor of the movie and the inevitable personal growth of the main character in this story.  The price of his coming to terms of what life is all about is steep, but despite of all ambiguities and actions he takes in the last few days of his life, he manages to get to heaven.  Wonderful film, smart and entertaining.  Mix of comedy, dark humor and action that will keep you at the edge of oyur seat until the end...",1198886400,5,965,4.418079096045198
