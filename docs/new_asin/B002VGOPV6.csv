8382037,5,B002VGOPV6,"As I said in the"" Doom Funnel""l review. this is one of a series of videos with a good lesson in it. The children in our church really enjoy these videos.",1379203200,,153,3.967741935483871
8382038,4,B002VGOPV6,"My kid loves this video and the video series in general.  However, this set of videos isn't as great as the original videos that were released.",1298937600,2,143,4.5
8382039,5,B002VGOPV6,"This is the first of 3-2-1 Penguins to be released on dvd. My kids (both under 4) LOVE it! It is fast paced enough to keep my youngest entertained, but easy lessons (like stopping to listen before acting) that teach my older. Includes 3 different stories. We love 3-2-1 Penguins!",1282003200,,279,4.6
8382040,5,B002VGOPV6,"Another great Penguins film...my toddler LOVES it.  We have just about all the 3-2-1- Penguin DVD's and my son would be lost without them.  The best things about these films are the allusions and embedded adult humor.  If you're a fan already, this DVD is a must.  If you're not a fan already, you need to get this film and then you'll be hooked, just like my son and our whole family are.",1274313600,2,389,4.287671232876712
