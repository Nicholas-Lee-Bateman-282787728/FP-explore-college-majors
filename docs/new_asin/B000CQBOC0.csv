8100290,1,B000CQBOC0,"I hate to give a negative review but watching this seminar was just down-right PAINFUL. It should've been titled 'Incoherent Thoughts About Screenwriting'. It is not specific to adaptation in the least and I doubt anyone new to screenwriting with an interest in adaptation will gain anything useful. It's just another sad homage to the old saying, ""Those that can't do, teach.""",1281398400,2,377,5.096774193548387
