638832,5,6303413919,"William Lawrence Boyd, better known as Hop-A-Long Cassidy never wears any outfit except his charactertistic black shirt, trousers, boots and Stetson...Hoppy rode, fought and grinned his way into our hearts on the silver screen, and then into our living rooms on the small tube.
Hoppy and his trail buddies ~ Johnny Nelson (Jimmy Ellison) always hot tempered and ready for action before it gets here...Windy Halliday (George ""Gabby"" Hayes), with ""Those Persnickordy Women""...and ""Women are Pure Poyzen""...my favorite saying has to be ""You're Dern Tootin'"", Hayes was the comedy sidekick who always knew the answer before the question, taught Hoppy everything from gunplay to hardriding, many times stole scenes right from under the entire cast.
Always filmed in the natural setting of Lone Pine, California that was a plus for westerns at that time...Boyd became very skilled as a horsemen, his acting and eye contact was never surpassed when coming across clues or realizing the guilty party...this was due to his days on the silent screen.
This had to be the best western series around during the '30s, strong performances by Boyd, Hayes and Ellison...with producer Harry ""Pop"" Sherman at the helm, behind the scenes with quality the uppermost in mind for Paramount Pictures...the Bar-20 gang with Windy Halliday (George ""Gabby"" Hayes) backing Hoppy's play whenever trouble enters the picture...when good guys wore black, rode a white horse and assured all his fans ~ HOPPY IS HERE TO STAY!
Total Time: 76 Mins (Trail Dust-1936)

638833,5,6303413919,"The most outstanding series of westerns began in 1935 from Paramount Pictures under the guiding hand of producer Harry ""Pop"" Sherman...continued well into the '40s proved to be the most successful 'B' Westerns ever made...based on Clarence E. Mulford's stories, they strived in changing Cassidy's image, which was both original and influential...the hero, played by William Lawrence Boyd, was mature and generally rather inactive, and the plots also tended to inactivity until a sudden burst of climactic action in the last reel, usually a frantic chase backed by tension-building music.
In all, Boyd made sixty-six Hopalong Cassidy Westerns, early films included Uncle Ben and Windy Halliday, both played by veteran actor George ""Gabby"" Hayes...was a steady favorite as a hitchrack, was chosen five years in succession as one of the 10 best money-making Western sidekick stars...like most western comics, had his share of narrow escapes being thrown from his horse, burned by blanks...but that was all in a days work...his one-liners will never be forgotten...""You're dern tootin'""...""Never trust a female, they're pure poyzin""...or my all-time favorite ~ ""Persnickgordy Women""...this crusty old-timer stole many a scene from John Wayne, Randolph Scott and yes even William Boyd.
""Hills of Old Wyoming"", features Stephen Morris (Morris Ankrum) using both names on the screen, as the ""western heavy"", came to Hollywood and Westerns directly from supporting Orson Welles on Broadway, Sherman and Boyd must have seen the evil this actor could portray, as he appeared in several ""Hoppy films""...another pick for ""Pop"" Sherman was a new sidekick for the Cassidy films...a newcomer Lucky Jenkins, played by Russell Hayden had his job cut out for him, with Boyd (as the hero) and Hayes (for comedy), left the field of romance and action wide open, Hayden filled those ""boots"" perfectly.
""North of the Rio Grande"", Morris Ankrum again, with a young Lee J. Cobb as one of the good guys...as the Bar-20 gang strive to derail the plans of evil, so that good and right can prevail...this was the formula that director Nate Watt used in all the ""Hop-A-Long Cassidy"" films, and it worked!

638936,5,6303413919,"I am loving the DVD. I am reliving my childhood!!! A blast from the past. I was so sorry that we could not go into the Museum when we were in Cambridge Ohio this past summer. We were there on a Tuesday in late August after the children were back in school. The Museum was open only from Thursday to Saturday because the summer rush was over. We could not stay in Cambridge so missed seeing the collection and possibly buying something. I hope that they can keep the collection going somehow and I would like to see it some day. In the meantime, as I have said, the DVD is great. The quality is very good. I'm a little upset at how some of the horses are treated but I know that riding and horse handling methods were fairly primitive in that time but I am also really enjoying seeing the different horses and watching for when they show up again. I have identified three Toppers so far. There are probably more. (Little Joe Cartwright of Bonanza had six horses - some piebald and some skewbald, all supposed to be the same horse). I have lots more hours of watching to do and will enjoy every minute.

  Cheers,

639000,5,6303413919,"First i will say this is an excellent presentation.  I thought this was a boxed set like the Hoppy TV set it is not.  What it is a compilation of 6 dvd's from 2009 and 8 dvds from 2004.  The plastic boxes say 2014 and 2015.  The discs say 2004 and 2009.  These sets were probably sold individually at one time and now assembled with a cellophane wrapper around the 4 boxes.  In any case they were digitally remastered and the picture and sound quality excellent.  I noticed that in a previous amazon review it was mentioned that  4 movies were missing.  Their are no movies missing all 66 are here and that Boyd's total output.  Another viewer was unhappy because the films were not presented in chronological order but if the purchaser takes the 4 boxes and takes the box with the earliest films as No.l and does likewise with the other 3 you see they are near chronological .  Not exactly but almost.  The only negative i found was the stacking of the disk in he boxes.  4 dis'c on 1 spindle etc.  I threw the boxes out, numbered the disc 1 thru 14 and placed them in a sleeved pouch..  Oh yes Bonus material includes 3 Hoppy radio shows from 195l  27 minutes each.  If your a Hoppy fan you will want to get the entire radio series.  The stories for the most part were who-dunnits and starred andy clyde as california carlson.  Oh yes some of the newspaper strips are shown and of course the Hopalong biography.  I have all the radio shows but sold most of the daily and sunday strips 5 years ago.  Once again a fine offering.",1436918400,,1528,4.309859154929577

639003,5,6303413919,"I learned about Hopalong Cassidy by watching the Encore Western Channel.  Up until about 5 years ago, they regularly showed Hopalong Cassidy movies.  I don't know why they stopped, but I always looked forward to watching and loving them.  Yes, they are little 'corny', but they were made during the 1930's and 1940's when times were a little more simple. I was born in 1949 so I wasn't around when they came to the local theaters.  Since Encore removed them from their line-up, I was very happy to see that Amazon had the entire 66 movie collection and I am glad I bought it.  Not to OD on ""Hoppy"" my loving wife limits me to one movie a day, otherwise I would waste an entire day or three watching the entire collection.  ---- SPOILER ALERT---During the very first movie of the collection, we are introduced to Bill Cassidy and then he hurts his leg and needs a cane to ""hop"" around for a few days earning the nickname ""hoppy"" or ""hopalong"".  From then he is always known has Hopalong Cassidy the foreman of the Bar_20 ranch located somewhere in Arizona.  His side-kicks or saddle-pals come and go, but Hoppy is always the good guy and never drinks anything other than water or milk. He is a national treasure and I'm only sorry I didn't get to see him during his lifetime.  I understand that he along with his white horse ""Topper"" used to lead the Rose Bowl parade for many years.",1433376000,,1382,4.47410358565737

The stories have varied plots as well as believable endings.  They are certainly a nice change from the movies produced today without all the graphic violence and sex.  A good choice for children as well as anyone, who wishes to see stories of the Wild West portrayed in a true light.  Most are only 60 minutes long or a few minutes longer.  Hopalong Cassidy is a good role model, depicting an intelligent, fair-minded cowboy, who deals with corruption and unsavory individuals.  Thumbs up to Hoppy!",1428105600,,627,4.654545454545454

Still have the snapshot of me at four or five in my Hoppy/Topper sweatshirt.  Sure, they were cheaply made B westerns but I love every one of them (some are way, way better than others in quality).  Sure, many of the plots are similar but who cares when Hoppy saves the day?  Hoppy rules!!!  Sure was fun to see Mitchum in some of his earliest roles as a badass.  If you love B westerns, the simpler times of black hats versus white hats (even though Hoppy wore a black hat most of the time), you can't go wrong with this collection.  I imagine that the original quality of the original films being digitalized was not the best, so all and all, they did a good job.",1424131200,,795,4.090322580645161

Picture quality acceptable for the age of the material.

Cons:
The films are presented in random sequence, requiring much disc swapping if you prefer to view in chronological order.
The two flimsy gatefold storage cases may be broken upon arrival, and surely won't last more than a few openings.
Information on the cases restricted to the film titles and release years. No printed background information provided.

Most of these films I have not seen since I was a child (many moons ago) when I mainly watched the star. Now I watch the other characters, and realize just how ingenious the film makers were.
My sole dislike is that they have not had colour added, like some of the old (pre-stagecoach) John Wayne westerns have benefited from.

Boyd is fun to watch as are all his sidekicks - particularly Lucky and Windy - some great bad guys such as Roy Barcroft - and Cassidy's horse Topper is also a joy to see galloping along with his white mane and tail flying.  Decent stories, lots of action and great scenery make these films a pleasure to watch.  At one time or another you can spot most of your favorite B-western actors in these films.  Some, of course, are better than others - but overall they're pretty darn good. Clean, fun, and entertaining.  Other reviewers have complained that the films aren't in chronological order on the discs - this is true, but it's a minor matter in my opinion.

Yup, that's him without the hair that he wore in later films and stage appearances such as Death of a Salesman, On the Waterfront, the Exorcist and even the Our Man Flint films.  I was amazed to see him in this film from 1937, as one tends to think of him as part of the ""Method"" new wave, which appeared after the war.  One also forgets that Anthony Quinn, was a studio actor who  went back many years before Brando and yet, he is also associated with that same period of ""realistic"" new actors who took Hollywood and Broadway by storm,  in the 50's. This is early in the ""Hoppy"" films but Bill Boyd is a pleasure to watch because of his intense and understated presence.  George ""Gabby"" Hayes,  is also part of my youth.  He did dozens of westerns as the comic relief and worked with all the greats.  He also used to appear in his own TV show in the 1950s.  Boyd is said to be one of the first to realize the value of merchandizing and made a fortune on ""Hoppy"" memorabilia, even before Roy and Gene got into it.  It is said that Boyd was also the model for the Nevada Smith character, in Harold Robbins book and film ""The Carpetbaggers.""  He was played by Alan Ladd in that 1964 film.

He founded Hoppy's Troopers, a fan club that rivaled the membership of the Boy Scouts. He asked kids to follow Hoppy's Code of Conduct which promoted honesty, decency, and fair play for all. And he gave much of his earnings to childrens' hospitals and medical research teams.

639418,5,6303413919,"My love of Westerns started with Hoppy movies released to TV in the late 1940s. The fact is that William Boyd was among the first film producers to recognize television as an entity unto itself and not necessarily the death knell of motion pictures. I don't know if he owned all of his feature films by that time, but he did eventually, and he released many of the 25 featured in this collection to TV.

But you won't find any of them playing on your box now or anywhere else in the condition of the prints represented here. They are almost pristine and nearly perfect and certainly struck from carefully preserved negatives. It is such a joy to watch these films again, some fifty years after first seeing them, and especially in better shape than the first time around.

Hoppy is, of course, the ultimate hero to me, but he is almost eclipsed in this collection by his sidekick California Carlson (Andy Clyde.) Clyde is so funny in some of these films that I had a hard time not watching more than one in one sitting just to see what kind of trouble California would get into next.

Hoppy had other sidekicks over the years, including Gabby Hayes, but California strikes gold with me and that makes this particular collection of 25 Hoppy films a terrific gift for old timers who barely remember the man on the white horse (Topper) and also a perfect starting point for buckaroos just starting down the trail with Hopalong Cassidy!",1207785600,20,1432,4.5859375

The most outstanding series of westerns began in 1935 from Paramount Pictures ""Hopalong Cassidy"", under the guiding hand of producer Harry ""Pop"" Sherman...continued well into the '40s proved to be the most successful 'B' Westerns ever made...based on Clarence E. Mulford's stories, they strived in changing Cassidy's image, which was both original and influential...the hero, played by William Lawrence Boyd, was mature and a man of his word...the plots were solid with a sudden burst of climactic action in the last reel, usually a frantic chase backed by tension-building music.

In all, Boyd made sixty-six Hopalong Cassidy Westerns, early films included Uncle Ben and Windy Halliday, both played by veteran actor George ""Gabby"" Hayes...was a steady favorite as a hitchrack, was chosen five years in succession as one of the 10 best money-making Western sidekick stars...like most western comics, had his share of narrow escapes being thrown from his horse, burned by blanks...but that was all in a days work...his one-liners will never be forgotten...""You're dern tootin'""...""Never trust a female, they're pure poyzin""...or my all-time favorite ~ ""Persnickgordy Women""...this crusty old-timer stole many a scene from John Wayne, Randolph Scott and yes even William Boyd.

William Lawrence Boyd, known as Hop-A-Long Cassidy never wears any outfit except his charactertistic black shirt, trousers, boots and Stetson...Hoppy rode, grinned and fought his way into our hearts on the silver screen and then right into our living rooms with a new inventions called...Television! ... Great Cast of Jimmy Ellison (Johnny Nelson) always hot-headed & getting into trouble...but the scene stealer is George ""Gabby"" Hayes, as the old-timer Uncle Ben, gives the a film shot in the arm with his down-to-earth humor and sentimentality, as the father figure to Hoppy the interaction with Boyd's character is pure Americana!

Must mention that it was sure good to see one of my all-time-favorite sidekicks George ""Gabby"" Hayes throw in with Hoppy ... The added special features are simply great ~ Coming Attractions:""Hopalong Cassidy:Public Hero #1"", plus a poster gallery, still gallery and my favorite is original materials from ""Merchandising King of the Cowboys"" museum exhibit. Hope ""Image Entertainment"" will keep releasing this outstanding series featuring Hopalong Cassidy in glorious black & white. I'll be standing in line for the next adventure with the Bar-20 wranglers ... William Boyd (Hopalong Cassidy), they'll never be another like him.

Hoppy's interaction with California Carlson (Andy Clyde) is always a shot in the arm with his down-to-earth humor and sentimentality, theses scenes are pure Americana!

Hoppy always wore two silver white handle six shooters, never drank or smoked, when the good guys always won and the moral to the story was fair-play...outstanding role model...gotta love it!

Another pick for ""Pop"" Sherman was a new sidekick for the Cassidy films ... a newcomer Lucky Jenkins, played by Russell Hayden had his job cut out for him, with Boyd (as the hero) and Andy Clyde (California Carlson) for comedy, left the field of romance and action wide open, Hayden filled those ""boots"" perfectly.

William Boyd was my hero, this collection of his films are perfect, clear and give me hope for the future. Our youth should have such a hero to look up to today. Must mention the fact that I still miss one of my all-time-favorite sidekicks though, George ""Gabby"" Hayes, you're durn tootin'!

Paramount and Clarence E. Mulford's fictional western character Hopalong Cassidy comes to life through William Boyd as Hoppy and Andy Clyde as California with films from the '40s...horse operas directed by Lesley Selander and George Archainbaud...some of the best hard riding and smokin' gunplay that ever came across the big screen from the Bar 20 boys ... just the way we like 'em.",1162339200,,4803,5.195090439276486

In all, Boyd made sixty-six Hopalong Cassidy Westerns, early films included Uncle Ben and Windy Halliday, both played by veteran actor George ""Gabby"" Hayes...was a steady favorite as a hitchrack, was chosen five years in succession as one of the 10 best money-making Western sidekick stars...like most western comics, had his share of narrow escapes being thrown from his horse, burned by blanks...but that was all in a days work...his one-liners will never be forgotten...""You're dern tootin'""...""Never trust a female, they're pure poyzin""...or my all-time favorite ~ ""Persnickgordy Women""...this crusty old-timer stole many a scene from John Wayne, Randolph Scott and yes even William Boyd.

William Lawrence Boyd, known as Hop-A-Long Cassidy never wears any outfit except his charactertistic black shirt, trousers, boots and Stetson...Hoppy rode, grinned and fought his way into our hearts on the silver screen and then right into our living rooms with a new inventions called...Television! ... Great Cast of Jimmy Ellison (Johnny Nelson) always hot-headed & getting into trouble...but the scene stealer is George ""Gabby"" Hayes, as the old-timer Uncle Ben, gives the a film shot in the arm with his down-to-earth humor and sentimentality, as the father figure to Hoppy the interaction with Boyd's character is pure Americana!

Must mention that it was sure good to see one of my all-time-favorite sidekicks George ""Gabby"" Hayes throw in with Hoppy ... The added special features are simply great ~ Coming Attractions:""Hopalong Cassidy:Public Hero #1"", plus a poster gallery, still gallery and my favorite is original materials from ""Merchandising King of the Cowboys"" museum exhibit. Hope ""Image Entertainment"" will keep releasing this outstanding series featuring Hopalong Cassidy in glorious black & white. I'll be standing in line for the next adventure with the Bar-20 wranglers ... William Boyd (Hopalong Cassidy), they'll never be another like him.

Paramount Pictures came up with a fine screenplay from Doris Schroeder and Vernon Smith based on a novel by Clarence E. Mulford ""Hopalong Cassidy's Protege"", released with a new title ""Call of the Prairie"". This 1936 film is just as fresh today with plenty of action as Shanghai McHenry (George Hayes) the leader of a gang outlaws, is planning to rob the Bar-20. Only one man can tame this notorious army of badmen ~ our man from the Bar 20...Cassidy. Director Howard Bretherton takes full advantage with his cast of players William Boyd (Hopalong Cassidy), Jimmy Ellison (Johnny Nelson), Mauriel Evans (Linda), Howard Lang (Buck Peters), Al Bridge (Sam Porter), Willie Fung (Wong) and Chill Wills and His Avalon Boys. Johnny has gambling debts and is taken prisoner, while Buck is forced to give to fight off the bandits who leave empty handed. At the very end of the film McHenry (Hayes) saves the day by warning Hoppy, we knew durn well Gabby couldn't be all bad in this western yarn.

With ""Heart of the West"" another Paramount release in 1936, based on ""Mesquite Jenkins, Tumbleweed"" (Clarence E. Mulford) with the guiding hand of director Howard Bretherton and our fine cast of William Boyd (Hopalong Cassidy), Jimmy Ellison (Johnny Nelson), Sidney Blackmer (Big John Trumbull), Lynn Gabriel (Sally), Charles Martin (Jim Jordan), but wait ~ enters one of our favorites in all of westerns George ""Gabby"" Hayes (Windy Halliday). Hoppy and Johnny save Windy from drowning...thus the adventure begins with rustlers, stampeding herds and outlaw take-over ranches for their own profit. Mixing dynamite with a cattle stampede does the trick for Hoppy and the rest of the good guys.

639465,5,6303413919,"The accompanying reviews state what I feel about this terrific series. I found something curious about the dvd vs. cassette copy of Trail Dust.(I have this title in both formats). They are both restored however the dvd copy has the original Paramount logo and the credits over a scene of a trail drive (obviously the original release print). The cassette copy has no Paramount logo and, in place of the action scene, has the drawn character of a cowboy (a re-release copy no doubt). I ran the same scenes side by side (dvd and cassette)for awhile. While the dvd copy is clean, the cassette tape copy is even cleaner and brighter. However the dvd copy shows the richness of the grey tones; the shadings contrast better. They are much less apparent in the otherwise cleaner cassette copy. I still recommend the dvd copy because it looks visually richer if a little less clean, only by comparison. It's still a quality print.",1144022400,4,922,4.732919254658385

Mulford's fictional western character Hopalong Cassidy comes to life through William Boyd as Hoppy, George ""Gabby"" Hayes as Windy Halliday and Russell Hayden as Lucky Jenkins with two films from the late '30s ~ both horse operas directed by Lesley Selander.

First on the program is ""HOPALONG RIDES AGAIN"" (1937), based on Mulford's 1923 novel ""Black Buttes"" with outstanding photography from Russell Harlan's camera serves up beautiful landscape ~ Hoppy instincts are usually right on and in this case the villains are in for it once again.

Second feature is ""HEART OF ARIZONA"" (1938), based on the author Clarence E. Mulford's 1929 novel ""The Deputy Sheriff"" with an ultra screenplay by Norman Houston and once again Russell Harlan's cinematography captures the theme and mood from a woman's point of view ~ Natalie Moorhead as Belle Starr gives a touching performance, almost a scene stealer.

Hoppy's interaction with Windy (Hayes) is always a shot in the arm with his down-to-earth humor and sentimentality, theses scenes are pure Americana!  Boyd, with his silver hair, black clothes and white horse (Topper) rode into our lives and we've never been the same since...your children and grandchildren will enjoy this clean wholesome entertainment...Hoppy always wore two silver white handle six shooters, never drank or smoked, when the good guys always won and the moral to the story was fair-play ~ outstanding role model...gotta love it!

I was hoping to see some buildings that I could say ""that looks like the 101"" - but there weren't any.  There was 1 iron bridge that maybe someone could recognize.
