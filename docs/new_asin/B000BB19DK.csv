8084424,2,B000BB19DK,"First of all, I was told there was supposed to be two episodes of this show. So I see two DVD's with different pictures on the covers, and no real difference in the description of the film described therein. But nothing is said of a part 1 and part 2 on each disc, not on the cover or in any review I see. So I think I need to buy each DVD to get first the part 1 on one DVD, and part 2 on the next DVD.

After I get them both, I open the first, the earlier made one, and lo and behold, it has both episodes on them. Crap! So, everybody out there, be forewarned, just because you see different covers on each DVD case, they are all one and the same movie. Do not buy the two of them thinking you are getting different movies in each different case!

Now, about the movie...
I thought it had great potential. But each time one or the other Weather Report Girl did something to attempt to sabotage the report or career of the other girl, the action built up to such a climax, and took such a long time getting to that point, that finally, when it got there, ""poof!"", the scene ended, and we were treated to a cloud burst or a thundrous explosion and fireworks display, and then the next day came and we missed the whole damn, bloody thing!

One example is when the substitute Weather Girl, Keiko Nakadai, has to take the day off and allow the former permanent Weather Girl, Michiko Kawai, to take over for a day. Michiko had earlier tried, unsuccessfully to bring down Keiko by lacing her lunch with a laxative but it was eaten by a fan instead. Keiko did the same to Michiko by putting the same laxative into her tea just before showtime and we got to see her as she squirmed and groaned through the weather forcast for about 3 or 4 minutes until she finally exploded. But when she did, do you think that we, the viewers, saw any of this humiliation? We did not! Fireworks, Thunder, lightning, rain! And then it was the next day and Michiko was sitting in a diner bemoaning what had happened to her the night before. We don't even know just HOW humiliating the whole thing was.

The whole movie, a mental game of humiliation and dominance and submission should be rated PG-13, or at least a soft R at most. There was a lot of promise but no follow through. Even the ending where there was the scene of a menage-e-trois, or orgy, was never, at any time shown, only started, and then the aftermath was come upon a split second later.

And to think, I have 2 of these DVDs, only with different cases. Shees!",1325980800,6,2503,4.2280334728033475
8084425,5,B000BB19DK,Weather Report Girl is a raunchy two-part OVA about a career-driven Japanese weather girl. Really. It's that simple. It's for mature audiences who know how to laugh at good immature jokes.,1313712000,,188,5.096774193548387
8084426,1,B000BB19DK,"the first disc i received didn't work, so i contacted the seller and asked for a new movie. i was charged for shipping but received a return envelope. the second disc still doesnt work.
