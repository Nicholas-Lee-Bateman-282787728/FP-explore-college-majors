8375705,5,B002O00W2U,"I purchased this double feature DVD after reading that the quality if most tolerable.  The first movie is rewarding for Pola Negri and it is tinted and appears complete. The second feature ""Backstairs"" I found far superior and much more rewarding even if it is obviously truncated with under a 50 minute running time, untinted, and in worst condition, (but tolerable and the sound is fine).  The added music is only adequate but not distracting. With this in mind I viewed the movie and was blown away with it's mastered 1921 minimalist style.  I am assuming that the first two reels are missing which has the development of a relationship between a servant, (who always uses the BACKSTAIRS) and her lover, seducer, who has gone away and never sends his promised mail.  Will he ever return? She asks the mailman every day if there is a letter for her and overtime he develops an unrequited love for her. Incomplete but plays well.  One can only hope that someday a complete print will be found and restored.",1503446400,,1007,4.698863636363637

Polish actress Pola Negri (1897-1987) stars. Her film career included 1917-1922 in Germany and 1923-1928 in the U.S.

In a German sanatorium, Richard visits his brother, hopelessly mad due to vamp Sappho's immoral abandon. At a club, Richard is accosted by Sappho, and they begin a troubled liaison, which her fat sugardaddy cannot thwart. A long flashback shows her involvement with Richard's brother. In the finale, ""Carnival,"" employing hundreds of milling extras, the escaped madman throttles Sappho.

This 82-min film is divided into 5 ""acts,"" presumably because of reel changes when using a single projector. The print is pretty good, tinted amber. The fresh-sounding full-orchestral score is an unusual plus.

BACKSTREET

Henny Porten (1890-1960) is the menial in an old multistorey Berlin townhouse. In the evening, she habitually meets her manfriend William Dieterle in the backstreet. Suddenly he disappears without a word, and she eagerly awaits postman Fritz Kortner, somewhat disabled, for the letter that never comes. The poor little postman, who lives close by on the backstreet, finally himself writes her a letter seemingly from her lover. She discovers the well-meant ruse, her lover suddenly returns, and tragedy ensues for all three.

This minimalist film (only 50 min) is of the experimental ""intimate theater"" genre. Porten's performance avoids silent-film cliche'.

Scenario by Carl Mayer, sets by Paul Lini, directed by Leopold Jessner, with good orchestral score.",1270252800,9,1496,5.535087719298246
