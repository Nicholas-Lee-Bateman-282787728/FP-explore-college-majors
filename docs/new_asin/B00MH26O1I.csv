6577564,1,B00MH26O1I,Terrible. Ugh.,1436227200,,14,6.5
6577565,5,B00MH26O1I,"Thoroughly enjoyed seeing David Suchet in a role other than Hercule Poirot. Also enjoyed seeing what happenes when the Mississippi rises beyond its limits. Bruce Campbell was awesome as Autolocus in Xena. He was equally entertaining in Tonado. Finally. I had been looking for ages for AFTERSHOCK:EARTHQUAKE IN NEW YOUR with Tom Skerritt, Sharon Lawrence, and a very young Jennifer Garner after seeig it on TV...finding it here with these other three winners was amazing!

Flood shows us how the British react to Nature's worst.

LOVE Them All.",1433721600,2,543,5.159090909090909
6577566,5,B00MH26O1I,"Great bargain, all 4 movies are very good, especially the one in England. Funny thing with the Tornado movie is elsewhere on Amazon as a single release it's OOP and going for a very High price. If you do a search for it this version does not come up. Anyway I highly recommend this set, each disc has 2 movies and they are both one sided disc.",1432684800,5,343,4.134328358208955

6577575,5,B00MH26O1I,"These made for television movies have provided me with enjoyable entertainment. Some of the movies have very well known actors, but others do not. The stories are interesting, and that is what matters to me. The price that I paid for the package of movies was very reasonable. I would recommend this package to others seeking the same type of entertainment.",1458864000,,357,4.868852459016393

6577582,5,B00MH26O1I,Bought this DVD for just one movie - Tornado. Bruce Campbell did a great job in this movie as a storm chaser and it is worth it for this film alone.,1436313600,,148,3.806451612903226

8672202,2,B00MH26O1I,OK.,1487116800,,3,3.0
8672203,4,B00MH26O1I,I love disaster movies.  They are one of my Guilty Pleasures.  This is a good set of movies that are a little more realistic than the most and still have some of the thrills. It focuses on a story and disaster rather than some killer fixated on one of the people of the movie that just escaped prison that has nothing to do with the story.  These are good quality what i would expect from TV Guide.,1483920000,,398,4.142857142857143
