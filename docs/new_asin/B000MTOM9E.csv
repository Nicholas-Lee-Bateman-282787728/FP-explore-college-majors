His neighbor, Suzuka, turns out to be a classmate and he becomes captivated by her beauty and determination. He joins the track team to become closer to her and try to understand her. Suzuka is a hard sell with a damaged heart, and Yamato is going to have to get the gold to impress her.

This is one of the best romance animes I've seen. It's a very touching and emotionally heavy story. There are lots of great characters and plot twists. The thing that makes this anime great for me is the character development. You really get a great understanding of the characters and why they think the way do. There is nothing about this anime that isn't fantastic. I think anyone can get a lot of enjoyment out of it. It's a great buy.",1354924800,2,815,4.3618421052631575
8172436,1,B000MTOM9E,"In the past, I have seen many cases in which a movie is far below the quality of the book it is based on, but in the manga / anime world, I have not seen such disparities. Until now! Everything that is great about the manga is missing in the anime; it is almost as if they did it on purpose. The manga has several characteristics that make it special: characters with great energy, beautiful drawings, outstanding humor for adults, and some picaresque situations.

The anime is slow paced, and at times it even seems like the DVD is paused, because nothing is happening. To make matters worse, the tone of voice of the characters is as dull as can be, even with the Japanese audio. The graphics in the anime are way below par, and do not even come close to the crisp drawings that make the manga special. But maybe the worst flaw of all is that the anime presents a ""sanitized"" version of the story, and therefore, in their effort to control the nudity and humor with an adult tone, loses its charm.

I do not recall being this disappointed with an anime in a long time, especially after being pleased by the manga. My recommendation should be clear by now, stay away from this production but do check out the manga: Suzuka, Vol. 1.",1196467200,,1232,4.399122807017544
