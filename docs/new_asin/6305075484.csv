7882377,4,6305075484,"I decided to watch this film at first because Julian was in it, and was suprised to find it very watchabable. It examines a side to people that most 'safe' and glamourised films don't - the darker desire in the human condition. Michael is a man who has it all and most people would think thats what it takes to satisfy a person, but as this film shows, you are always driven by that one thing that you can't have. Despite his guilt about his family and her youth he is drawn to Magenta because she is forbidden and the passionate affair he has with her not only gives him an amazing rare rush of adrenaline but it opens up his eyes to the facade of those around him, which creates interesting twists in the film that shatter his perception of his 'perfect life'.
Magenta is innocently beautiful but still seductive which makes him attracted to her more. Their lust overflows and eventually becomes destructive and ends in a way you wouldn't imagine..",1089417600,,950,4.497109826589595
7882378,5,6305075484,"I swiched on channel 5 here in England at 11pm tonight expecting another corny blue movie, what I got was one of the most incredible films ive ever seen.  I thought the storyline was incredible if a little disturbing.  Magenta was a suprise to me and yes it helped that Crystal Atkins (magenta) is absolutely stunning and an incredible actress but the whole film was gripping from beggining to end.",1042156800,,398,4.671428571428572
7882379,4,6305075484,First time through this film I was left a little shocked but a few days later realized I was still thinking about it. Watched it again and really found the theme of perfect vs flawed and the tearing down of a virtuous man very captivating. I have watched it several times and enjoy it each time (though I do fast forward through the few gratitous sex scenes...maybe why I like the character of virtuous Michael),995068800,,411,4.493333333333333
7882380,1,6305075484,"This movie is a pitiful conglomeration of misplaced sexual energy and unrealized self destruction and has no basis in reality or even the sordid world that most soft porn concerns itself with.  It wants to be real at  times and at other times, for instance when Magenta gives a stranger a  private dance, will do away with all aspects of reality and rationale in  order to allude to an excuse for a sex scene, which basically never arrives  to the viewer's disappointment.  I'm sure anyone who sees this movie will  never have the curiosity to read about it again, and so basically I write  for myself.  But as far as Magenta herself goes, ""She's Hot!""",916963200,,652,4.6
