2339243,4,B0009XRZLA,"This is a great DVD if you want to learn to isolate muscle groups - belly dancing is really great for getting you to focus on moving individual parts of your body while trying to keep the rest relatively still. This is similar to the muscle isolations involved in aerobics, spinning, pilates and yoga, and also to the warm-ups I was taught as an acting student.

My only complaint is that this DVD moves very quickly from the basic moves into a full-scale dance routine. You haven't learned enough from the basics to really participate in the dance at first. You also need a bit of space to be able to step forward and backward and to do the whole dance routine along with the video. After a bit of practice and a bit more space this should resolve itself.",1157932800,6,756,4.4
2339244,3,B0009XRZLA,I bought this to start a new kind of workout. Based on the reviews of her other videos I purchased this. Its okay. Not the best instructions. I don't know if I'd continue this workout.,1146441600,2,184,4.285714285714286
2339245,5,B0009XRZLA,"I do workout 3-5 days a week, but I think this is a good DVD for those who aren't in great shape, or who want an energetic workout that doesn't leave you tired (but you will be sore the next day if you haven't done some of these moves before).

I have a few other belly dancing fitness DVD's, but this is the one I come back to over and over.  Amir goes step by step for everything from arm movements, chest movements, and even the proper foot placement for hip movements.  She is easy to follow, and goes slow enough for you to catch everything.

The dance ""routine"" is interesting in that she shows you how to incorporate the steps into a dance.  It took me a few times to get the hang of it, but after a few attempts it is fairly easy to follow.

I give this DVD a 5 star rating because it is easy to follow, gives a good overall workout, and is fun to do.",1145750400,26,859,3.9941520467836256
8070414,2,B0009XRZLA,I would have hoped for this to be an instructional video.  It was not really for beginners.,1483920000,,91,4.352941176470588

8070417,1,B0009XRZLA,"this is the worst fitness dvd i have ever bought in my whole life! this female is so self absorbed she cant do the fitness for shining the light on her body which is perfect , however , after u get the steps of how to dip your hips, pop your chest, and wiggle your arms the rest is just freestyle dancing and her and her belly dancin students prancing around . no fitness here.. it was only .99c so its a waste of time to return it.",1404777600,,432,3.9204545454545454
8070418,3,B0009XRZLA,"I think this is the first belly dance DVD I have seen with a  instructor who is actually from the middle east!  (Amira Mor was born in Israel to Iraqi parents.)  That fact, combined with the music she chose (I think I recognized ""Ta Mavra Matia Sou"") made this feel very authentic.

The title of this DVD should be ""Beginner Belly Dance Technique"" since that is what she covers.  (You will not break a sweat if you just follow what's on the DVD.)  She covers a lot of moves, but I wish she had taught more combinations so that beginners would have a better idea how to string them together.

While the film quality is poor, some chapter titles would've been nice, the skirts were a tad risque, and the backup dancers seemed to be picked for being skinny rather than their dance ability, overall, this gives a good overview of belly dance for the novice dancer.",1385856000,,860,4.439490445859873
8070419,3,B0009XRZLA,Its an OK DVD its not much of a workout. She talks sooo much through out this that you only actually learn a few moves. The steps you do learn are fun though.,1360540800,,158,3.8181818181818183
8070420,4,B0009XRZLA,"This DVD is similarly named to the Total Fitness DVD, but it's quite different. I'm not sure that the ""fitness"" aspect was tied in well. It wasn't what I was expecting. Amira does teach some nice moves and there is a troupe of bellydancers with her that do some improvisation at the end, but it's not particularly focused on the athletic aspect of bellydance. The performers don't even dress in the more athletic bellydance outfits, such as seen in Veena and Neena DVDs. Still, if you get past the incongruity of the title, it's a good look at how you can learn bellydance moves and the improvise with your own style.",1330300800,,617,4.5675675675675675
8070421,5,B0009XRZLA,"After reading reviews on other Amira Mor DVDs, it is obvious that one will either love or hate her.  I happen to be one of the former.  As a novice to belly dancing, I found her to be the very opposite of intimidating - relaxed, open, friendly, with a genuine enjoyment for what she does.  This DVD is divided into segments, which makes it easy to repeat or skip ahead.  The steps are demonstrated and repeated - enough to learn from, not too much to become boring or overly repetitive.  She offers words of encouragement at JUST the right times, and her student dancers are of all sizes and races, which makes one feel that, truly - anyone can learn this!  Yes, she does have an accent (which again, you will either love or hate) but she makes very sure her words are clear and understood.  The only issue I have with this DVD is towards the end, in the segment on walking - the outfit she and the other dancers are wearing partially covers the feet and ankles, so it is impossible to view just how the foot is to be posed. She describes the position in detail, but it would be reassuring to actually SEE the pose as well.  The group dancing at the end is wonderful, with Amira letting her students dance freestyle, making the viewer feel as they could just join in.  This is a wonderful DVD for the beginner or for anyone wanting a very low-impact workout.",1188518400,4,1358,4.357142857142857
8070422,4,B0009XRZLA,"This is the 2nd DVD I tried from Amira though I have like 30 other bellydance dvds & this is the 1st of her series. Her series goes as follows: Vol 1: Bellydance your way to fitness, 2: Belly... your way to energy 3: Belly... your way to your soul 4: Belly... your way to your soul mate 5: Belly... your way to a feminine total body work out.

There is only 1 option on the menu, though the 45 min dvd is split into chapters.

This starts with a brief vague history on bellydance & how it's a good workout while Amira dances for 3 min.

She dances like a good latin dancer, not structured like the good bellydancers like Neon or Neena & Veena, the bellydance twins, but she helps you to relax & just get into it w/o thinking too much. She's not the best dancer, a bit sloppy, but she's not too bad.

The set is a wood floor with colorful scarves hanging from the celing & pillows under them. There are 5 backup dancers, all young except one who looks to be in her late 30s in blue skirts/bra tops with bead hip scarves. Eastern music w/fast good beat plays throughout.

Amira seems very nice, perfect aerobics instructor feel to her teaching, no breaks, going slow at first & then normal speed soon after, teaching as she goes, so it doesn't get too slow/boring. She counts a little, but mostly calls out what to do next & reminders about keeping muscles tight & not rolling spine & how to keep your balance best. She lets you practice a nice amount of time as she thinks the average person's muscles would fatigue.

Section 1: Preparation - breathe, relax, balance, focus

Segment 2: Wrist circles, shoulder rolls, snake arms, butterfly arms, cobra arms, shimmy shoulders

Segment 3: Upper body - chest lifts & drops, V chest, waist side to side, rib cage fwd & back, torso circles, chest circles, camal

Segment 4: hip shimmies, pelvic shimmies, hip circle, hips lifts & drops

Segment 5: Basic walk - fwd, back w/hip lifts & drops

Segment 6: her teaching 2x of 1 part of a basic routine, 1x of next segment of the routine, then all of a sudden no teaching & them dancing around.

This is a nice addition when you already own a few dvds & need another perspective of another teacher who's more relaxed & want the class feel though she doesn't stop too often to explain to let you get bored. Take off 2 stars if you expect to learn to be more poised & perfect your moves.

There are video clips on her site at amirmor com",1175385600,12,2423,4.322295805739515
8070423,3,B0009XRZLA,"I think this was an okay video to learn the basic steps of belly dancing, but it's seems rather cheaply made with a lame set and not the most beautiful costumes I've ever seen.  It also didn't feel like much like a fitness video.  I got more out of an overall body work out with the DVD ""Discover Bellydance"" with twins, Veena and Neena. Bidasha.

But back to ""Belly Dancing Fitness"":  at the end of the video when you expect to pull all of the moves you've just learned together, you aren't really given clear instruction, which was disappointing because part of the fun of learning all of the steps is pulling them togther into a dance routine.  I found myself scrambling around trying to follow what the dancers were doing which was not as fun.

And while it's nice to see Ms. Mor and her dancers perform at the end of the video, they suddenly just came out of nowhere dressed in more elaborate costumes that when they were instructing you and boom - your lesson was clearly over.  Sure you can just dance around with them, which I did, but I'd have much rather they spent the time walking viewers through a rewarding routine they could immulate at home, rather than just swirling around lost at the end.  It is an exotic art form after all.",1169251200,,1244,4.425438596491228
