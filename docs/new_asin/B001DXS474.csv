3543485,2,B001DXS474,"I feel that listing this as Toby Keith Biography (2008) is very misleading.  The dvd was created in 2005 and was aired on television.  I was under the impression that this was a new dvd being released in relation with Beer for My Horses and his That Don't Make Me a Bad Guy cd.  I was disappointed when I put the dvd in to watch it and it was something I had already seen.
I love Toby and it is an informative dvd, it just isn't a new release as implied.",1226966400,5,454,3.967032967032967

8295438,4,B001DXS474,"I don't purchase many DVDs as I soon get tired of them. Not this one. When I tire of TV I watch Toby Keith's biography, or his movies over and over. The biography does a good job of covering his life from beginning to the present. I would have liked more personal interviews of him.  Too bad we don't see more of him on TV. We need more patriotic citizens like Toby Keith. He stands up for what, and whom, he thinks is best for our country, not for the party.",1236643200,9,459,4.043956043956044
