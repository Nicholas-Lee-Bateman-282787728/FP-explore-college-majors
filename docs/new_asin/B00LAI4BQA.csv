8664851,1,B00LAI4BQA,"terrible,  glosses over many facts, without any explanation just to point everyone back to the original conclusion",1477612800,,114,5.705882352941177
8664852,5,B00LAI4BQA,"I've read 3 books that make the case there were several killers, and only maybe was DeSalvo one of them. The DNA evidence from a couple years back plus this video convinces me DeSalvo did them all. His confession was genuine, especially when you consider the letters he sent to the Detective DiNatale.

This video is also a fascinating look at a family culture of detecting and how different members feel about the profession. It was well put together and kept my interest the whole time.",1476835200,,488,4.674418604651163
8664853,5,B00LAI4BQA,"This was wonderful. The creative filmmaking added immensely to what was already a compelling story. Really one of the best ""true crime"" type documentaries I've seen this year (2016). Not sorry I spent the money! Watch it to the absolute end. There's an important note that puts everything that was uncertain for all those years in to perspective.",1473552000,,346,4.982758620689655
8664854,5,B00LAI4BQA,"Had the wheels of justice operated properly in Boston in the early 1960's, forensic profiling may have had a 20 year jump start, perhaps solving or preventing many subsequent crimes. Beautifuly made family tribute/true crime documentary.",1469232000,,237,5.611111111111111
8664855,4,B00LAI4BQA,"I've been interested in the Boston Strangler case from the get-go and have read several books on the case (including the one written by Mary Sullivan's nephew), as well as having seen the Tony Curtis/Henry Fonda movie when it first came out. This documentary was very interesting and had a different slant from a detective. Anyone interested in the case would enjoy this film and I recommend it.",1466035200,,395,4.823529411764706
8664856,3,B00LAI4BQA,"A meandering ode to the filmmaker's late grandfather and his involvement in the Boston Strangler investigation. This film could have benefited from  being less affected. No quirky film editing tricks or guitar tinged underscoring was needed. The story, on its own, is compelling enough. Let the evidence and the players/observers themselves do the talking. All in all, this feels like a missed opportunity for some compelling documentary film making.",1465084800,,450,5.521739130434782

8664859,5,B00LAI4BQA,"This is a riveting accounting of the search for Albert DeSalvo, better known as the Boston Strangler, murderer of 13 women from June 1962 until January 1964. But this documentary offers far more than the DeSalvo story. It's the saga of how the search and subsequent effort to convict DeSalvo of the murders took hold of the life of chief investigator Detective Philip Di Natale, and how DiNatale's passion and obsession around this case also affected his family. It's also a story of how politics, then as now, muddied the waters and most likely prevented DiNatale from getting the conviction he'd sought. DeSalvo was never convicted of the stranglings, but of lesser charges. Some even set out to prove that DeSalvo was not the strangler, but as this documentary reveals, evidence produced in 2013 proves otherwise and vindicates the dedication and determination of  Detective DiNatale.

This is a sensitive, honest, and fascinating story, with much footage from the times and excerpts from the 32 letters that DeSalvo wrote to Detective DiNatale. Highly recommended for anyone interested in crime and criminal investigations before the age of technology.",1409184000,4,1156,5.209677419354839
