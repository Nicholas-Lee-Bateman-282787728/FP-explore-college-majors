556746,5,6303073212,"What a find!! Alec Guiness, Leo McKern, Jeanne Moreau, Geraldine Page -- all in one cast that simply cooks. The acting is wonderful. No over-the-top stuff. Just understated, quiet, terrific acting that fits this seemingly small story.
A little group of tourists come together in a hotel on the wind-swept beachfront of Normandy, France. Each has come to commemorate fallen D-Day friends and comrades. Together, they remember their friends and old loves and, in a terrific ending, discover their commonality.
If you like terrific acting ,fine writing and perfect directing, this tape is for you.",973382400,6,594,5.2631578947368425
556747,5,6303073212,"A masterful work.  The personalities, like spokes in some wheel of poetic prose, converge at the end into a turning hub -- which unites them all.  This is a film which finds humanity in every aspect and levels the playing  field in a way we all can understand.  The UK-US counterpoint (and comedy!)  was superb.  The remembrance of ALL dead at Normandy inspired tears, no  matter what language we speak.  There we ALL are: almost jaybird-naked in  ourselves!  As a retired naval officer, I can only praise the makers of  this fine film.  Every generation viewing it may find great value in the  visual experience.  The WW2 heros (all of them) who see it will find  comfort in the faithful completion of duty.  Regardless of the white slab  which commemorates participants in D-Day, ""A Foreign Field""  speaks for all.",955756800,18,816,4.748201438848921
556748,5,6303073212,"Foreign Field is a very moving film for those who were veterans and also for those who were not.  An American man, his daughter and son-in-law are visiting France to see Omaha Beach, where the father landed in 1944  Randolph, Chaplin and Herrmann).  Two British men are also visiting the  same area (McKern and Guinness) one who is severely handicapped and mutters  Briggsy throughout the film.  What developes when these two groups meet is  both funny and moving.  The British and American veterans remember a French  girl who  tended them when they were wounded during the fighting in  Normandy.  When they find that it is the same woman and she now lives in a  nursing home the reality of aging sinks in.  The casting of this film was  superb.  On the British side, Leo McKern and Sir Alec Guinnes are  outstanding.  The American casting is no less thoughtful, John Randolph as  the American vet, Geraldine Chaplin as his cranky and rather bitchy  daughter, Edward Herrmann as the befuddled son-in-law cast in the role of  peacemaker.  Lauren Bacall as a single woman, recently widowed, visiting  Normandy for her own reasons gives the film a bit of mystery. Jeanne Moreau  as the French woman who as a girl was the angel of mercy to both the  wounded men is a key piece of casting.  There are a number of memorable  scenes in this film; the whole group huddled in one car as Leo McKern  describes how his best friend died after crawling over a landmine in the  hedgerows, Lauren Bacall taking them to her brother's grave, John Randolph  visiting his friends grave off of Omaha Beach, Edward Herrmann getting an  early christmas present from his now more reachable wife.  The most moving  scene is purely visual and leaves the greatest impression, I think.  It is  the vast row of crosses and stars of david that cover the American cemetery  behind Omaha Beach, it is breathtaking and emotionally charged at the same  time.  This is a finely crafted film that has had little market exposure,  but should be a must see for anyone interested in World War II and the  aftermath.",949104000,15,2078,4.695530726256983

Each one has a heartwarming and sad story.  Even the character played by Lauren Bacall, who is looking for her brother's grave.  And it has a nice but poetic twist at the end.

556821,5,6303073212,"Some reviewers have cited this as the best movie they have ever seen. I wouldn't go that far, but this is a great film, with a superb cast. It begins as a comedy about a Yank and a Brit, veterans of D-Day, returning on its anniversary, and discovering a rivalry over a nurse who, in 1944, had done more than attend their wounds.  At the film's mid-point, at the close of a restaurant scene, the story becomes much more serious. In a few deft strokes, in a small hotel room, it is transformed by a concise but unforgettable re-visiting of the terrible hours and days of the invasion. The final scenes become a closure, of sorts, for those who were there, and perhaps for those of us who weren't. I have watched the film six or eight times, never with dry eyes.

556877,5,6303073212,"A film to understand the men/women who fought WWII. A story to teach younger generations why they deserve our praise, thanks, and respect. An emotional trek of a small group of war vets that accidentally meet in the Normandy location of their original acquaintance. The story seems to begin slow, due to the fact that we must find these characters as they collide in confrontation 50 years after the D-Day landing. Much has changed for them all, but some things have not. Some face survivor's guilt. A beautiful French set for this 1994 story that takes the minds of several survivors back 50 years to 1944. It is the changes, the eventual understandings, the the magical camaraderie that is expected to take place--after all it was a Masterpiece Theatre show.

--A war memorial drama.--

Heartwarming. It brings back the generation of my father that was there, and the 9000 that were killed or wounded on the Normandy beach sand. We see in this story, among a handful of travelers, a mini-resurgence of the cold war, then peace.
A Foreign Field is not new, but that means a value can be found buying used. It's one to own, to watch each Memorial Day and Veterans Day. One to teach the next generation of the sacrifice of those who went before them.

As to the video - ""A Foreign Field"" - I am grateful to Wikipedia for its listings by actor of their movie appearances. Alec Guinness was the first actor of whom I became totally enamored, at an early age. Other actors over the years (also the actor's death) had pushed Alec Guinness to the back of my 78-yr. old mind.
When he returned to the forefront (through a Netflix
subscription) I immediately turned to Amazon.com - that had exactly the right DVD at a bargain price. I also have other Netflix Guinness offerings coming along on subscription - and I'm amazed that these Alec Guinness movies didn't come to my attention years ago - at our local movie theaters - as TV reruns - or whatever.

Touching, hilarious and for young people today who know virtually nothing about WWII or intricate human relationships, it has even become educational.

The story starts with the coincidental meeting of American and British veterans of D-Day in France.  The performances by everyone in the cast are at the top of their form and for actors such as Leo McKern, Sir Alec Guiness, and Lauren Bacall, that's saying something.  Jeanne Moreau is as lyrical and touching as she's ever been, but my favorite performance is probably Edward Herrmann because, as the helpless voice of sanity and compassion, he plays the perfect foil for everyone else's nutiness.

A superb quintet of older actors give the simple story of A Foreign Field a rich and resonant texture. Amos (Alec Guiness, Kind Hearts and Coronets, Star Wars) and Cyril (Leo McKern, Rumpole of the Bailey) are two British World War II veterans who return to the beaches of Normandy, where they'd come ashore almost 50 years earlier. They run into an American veteran named Waldo (John Randolph, Prizzi's Honor) and a woman named Lisa (Lauren Bacall, The Big Sleep, Dogville) whose brother died on D-Day. Waldo and Cyril have both come seeking the same woman who comforted them when they were wounded--but when they find her (Jeanne Moreau, Jules and Jim, La Femme Nikita), she's not what they remember. Nothing dramatic happens in A Foreign Film--the characters bicker, become friends, and go to graveyards--but in the hands of this group of great talents, small emotional moments seem full and rewarding. This is a sweet and gentle movie that carefully avoids any saccharine sentiment. Also featuring Geraldine Chaplin (Nashville, Talk to Her) and Edward Herrmann (The Cat's Meow, The Paper Chase). --Bret Fetzer",1131235200,2,1144,5.117647058823529

I was disappointed to see that it wasn't reshown as part of the recent memorial. It is the most touching movie I have ever seen. There are twists but they are believable and done so gently the effect is all the more startling.
Themes of reconcilliation and sacrifice and intermingled with the charcters and their splendid devotion to duty and the memories of those long gone.

Growing up lucky enough to be exposed to Sir Alec's Ealing comedies, I felt I should try to score this. Not to mention the fact that the movie co-starred the late, great Leo McKern. I found a used copy via Amazon, & though the ex-rental tape doesn't track well, I'm not disappointed in the least. Sir Alec & McKern portray old comrades returning to Normandy. McKern is right out front, as an irascible, less than charming Rumpolesque figure. Sir Alec's character, Amos, is ""retarded"", but though we suspect war wounds, we don't get any info along this line until late in the film. The rest of the ensemble cast works amazingly well, even Geraldine Chaplin, who has grated on me in everything since Dr. Zhivago. FDR, excuse me, Edward Herrman, is very good, as are Lauren Bacall, Jeanne Moreau, and John Randolph. The moving look at the return of old soldiers to ""a foreign field"" behind Sword or Juno beach is reminiscent of ex-private James Ryan visiting Capt James Miller's gravesite in ""Saving Private Ryan"". I don't know, but I think Sir Alec Guinness was very ill when this was filmed. He says very few words, but his subdued, almost delicate Amos says volumes without verbalizing. This is one that must be brought out on DVD, and just to keep things unanimous, I give ""A Foreign Field"" 5 stars.",1074902400,40,1379,4.63265306122449
557051,5,6303073212,"It is truly a shame that this movie is largely unknown, because it is one of the finer movies I have ever watched.  The acting is amazing, and the characters play off of each other brilliantly.  I have told others about the movie, and have to warn them that if they are looking for lots of explosions, blood, and guts, that this is not the movie for them.  Unfortunately, we have come to expect and even crave that in a war movie.  What makes A Foreign Field so great is the fact that the noise and bloodshed are long over, and the movie focuses instead on the memories and core emotions that veterans and their loved ones feel when reflecting on a different time.  It is a great movie to watch on Veteran's Day or Memorial Day every year.",1036972800,43,739,4.287769784172662
557052,5,6303073212,"A sleeper. I fortunately saw Foreign Field on TV several years ago and remembered it. With the current interest in WW II Europe, this movie provides a different viewpoint than the tremendous violence of combat. No mud, no blood and the sun is shining. Wryly humorous at the start, it segues into an emotional end. Not a dry eye in the house.",1034726400,13,341,4.516129032258065
