346237,4,6301576810,"After her highly acclaimed Emmy nominated performance in The Burning Bed, Fawcett made this compelling telemovie about the relationship between a wife and her mother in-law, and how they eventually reach common ground and love after the elder woman suffers a devasting stroke.

The superb late lamented Colleen Dewhurst drives the movie with a commanding performance as the mother-in-law from hell. She is at once hateful, tragic and sympathetic in a role that won her an EMMY for best supporting actress. Its a travesty that Fawcett was once again overlooked as she matches Dewhurst scene for scene in a deeply nuanced study. The movie is played out in flashback...and is absolutely essential viewing for lovers of 'human stories'.",1164844800,11,732,5.203389830508475
346238,5,6301576810,"A young woman marries a painter, but she discovers, to her utmost outrage, that her mother in law cannot stay outside their marriage or her husband's career. She is a vulture in a way and feeds on other people. That drives the daughter in law crazy, especially the inability of her husband to put his mother back in place. This goes on till the mother has a stroke and becomes a bedridden invalid. Then the relation between the daughter in law and the mother in law develops to an extreme enslavement, so complete that the daughter in law cannot accept the mother in law's death when it occurs. This absolute dependence is so well built that it becomes admirable even if repulsive. The vulture triumphs till her death, and even beyond her death.

7813991,5,6301576810,One of the best TV movies ever made. Farrah Fawcett and Colleen Dewhurst are at their best in this story about a woman and her mother-in-law.

7813997,5,6301576810,"This movie is poignant and heartfelt - one that stays with you for a long time.  Why has there been no DVD of this movie released?  I loved this movie and have watched it many times - every time it has been played on television.  Unfortunately, it has not been played in a long time.  I am longing to see it again and want to buy it, but I want it on DVD format.  Why hasn't anyone released it on DVD?",1380499200,,401,3.9012345679012346
7813998,5,6301576810,"I wish more people could have seen this film and wonder why it has not been transferred to DVD.  Aside from ""The Burning Bed"" and ""Small Sacrifices"", it is superb evidence that Farrah Fawcett, when given the right material, was an awesome actress.  Nervous and jittery at first and firm, strident, and real in the second moment, Fawcett truly held her own against Emmy winner Colleen Dewhurst.  Both she and Dewhurst seem so hopelessly mismatched in idea until the film starts and then the audience gets it.  A true character study in strained familial relationships.  Look for a brilliant scene in which Fawcett admonishes her husband for putting his mother before she and her children. (""Oh don't you just defend her.  It's your fault TOO!! I try to be nice, I try to be kind, but I'm not doing it anymore!!!!"") An incredible story that begins with the lines from Fawcett ""I didn't know where I was going.  I didn't know what I was doing.....""  Probably the best acting I have EVER seen the late Fawcett do. I often tell others of this work and they do not believe me that it ever existed.  More reason to release it on DVD in honor of the late Fawcett and Dewhurst.  Incredible....so underrated, so unsung....and so never seen by audiences....",1336435200,14,1246,4.674311926605505
