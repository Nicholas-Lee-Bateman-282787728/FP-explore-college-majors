7917720,4,B000038I1D,"Originally airing on television in 1999, Blood Money is a tale of family optimism and secrets. Eye-catching star Brian Bloom stars as Tony Restrelli. Born into a mafia family, Tony seeks a way out but finds that family ties are often too hard to break. In trying to fix some of his family's troubles Tony only sinks more and more into a dark world with more questions than answers. It is only when his brother comes up dead that Tony puts aside some personal issues and becomes determined to find out why. Despite the mafia cliches, I found this movie rather interesting as it weaved in and out of the various mindsets of different cultural mafia organizations. While no Godfather, Blood Money does take on the challange of small time families with big time dreams. Imagine a cut and dry Sopranos movie made for Prime Time network television.",1023148800,2,842,4.695945945945946
7917721,5,B000038I1D,"Blood Money is one of those rare,underrated gems that sadly,the
public doesn't know about. Lori Petty plays a fiesty stripper named Candy who wittneses a drug deal gone bad. It's a really good thriller with some great action/gun fight scenes. The plot and characters are very believable with a credible plot.
 Personally,I love Ms. Petty(could you tell??)and I love the sound of her voice and her witty comments. She played her role perfectly(the funniest scene is where she gives the undercover cop lessons on how to dance like a stripper!)
 The video casette is a great novelity in itself for collectors of rare goodies. The cover jacket is glossy with a holographic type effect and a great photo of Lori. The video casette is well,blood red! It's great making people go ""oooo"" when you first slide it out of the cover!
 This is a great addition for any Lori Petty fan or collector of rare movies. However,you can buy it ALOT cheaper ... at other sites if you look around....I did!",1022112000,,983,4.7368421052631575
