8421070,5,B004AWPDYW,"Many Christians talk about our Jewish roots, but here are three Jewish believers in Messiah whose lives and experiences and educations in things Jewish and things Evangelical put legs on just what those roots look like and what they should mean to us as believers and joint heirs. Highly recommended and rumor has it that another similar video set is coming. Can't wait!",1379548800,,370,4.888888888888889
8421071,5,B004AWPDYW,"This presentation comes in 3 parts each not quite 1/2 hr long.
Each section is a dialog between Mart DeHaan (gentile) and 3 Messianic Jews of different personalities.
Their dialog seems to presume a reasonable level of understanding regarding the Christian faith at least from a gentile point of view.
The filming of this interview is made at the south wall of the Temple site in Jerusalem.
This discussion may change your notions about baptism, communion, prophesy, and scripture in general (all have a Jewish origin).
Several excellent visual points are made about the conditions at Pentecost (Acts 2) and the destruction of the 2nd Temple.
Most importantly the discussion will ask you to understand how the deity of Jesus was perceived and appreciated by the first (mostly Jewish) believers.
Imagine if you did not have the New Testament (they didn't); how would you come by your faith?

Should you share this with a Jewish friend?  I would say yes however preview it first just to be sure.
Should you share this with a non believing friend?  Yes this is very good for both witnessing about Jesus and for showing Israel in a friendly light.

DeHaan is part of the Day of Discovery which is produced by RBC Ministries.
They are quite reputable and are well known for their ""Our Daily Bread"" publication.",1290038400,6,1305,4.838565022421525
