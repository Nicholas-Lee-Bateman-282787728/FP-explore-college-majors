7829437,1,6302701104,"The ""Furious"" is among the most hilarious films ever made. It is  hilarious because it succeeds in failing every level that could make a  dcent film. This is not as bad or as funny as Le's other masterpiece,  ""Eye of the Dragon"" (undoubtebly the worst film of all time next  to ""Caligula""), which Le directed. The key plot is not even worth  being described for, nor are the characters. The action sequences, music,  sound editing, are so off-key and pathetically dubbed, you can't help but  laugh at it (not to mention a good script, direction, and acting, which  this film thoroughly lacked). This is a very bad film, but for the ultimate  comedy because of its effortless way to succeed at being a good movie at  1%, rent ""Eye of the Dragon"", which isn't even on sale here (and  thank god for it), but it is worth renting. It is impossible to make a film  as bad as that. Just impossible.",961200000,,891,4.46583850931677
