8288172,5,B001CLB8WA,A buddy of mine lent this video to me and I managed to watch it twice before he took it back.  It had to be in my library and so I picked it up.  The casting segment videos are well produced and do an excellent job of illustrating the fly casting technique they are teaching.  This video is recommended for competent fly casters ready to take the next step.,1367712000,2,357,4.144927536231884
