The only hockey you see are practice sessions for the Buffalo Sabres. The only fans you see are some standing in line for the Anaheim Ducks when they were in the Stanley Cup final.  Other than that, it's just interviews with a handful of people.

I thought it might be okay afer viewing the fist couple of minutes as Stan Fischler gave us some history of hockey. Hey, I can always learn something. But, basically after that the subject matter boiled down to discussing two lockouts and listening to Los Angeles King owner Bruce McNall talk about acquiring Wayne Gretzky or talk about his rock collection hobby.  Yawn!

The only interesting part was Fischler talking about ""Rocket"" Richard and the riots they had in Montreal one season.

I'm being generous giving this two stars. It's only because I like sports history.",1236556800,,972,4.744047619047619
8211366,3,B000TXNDRA,"This one really surprised us.  The title of the DVD implied lots of action and fun, as did the description.  Instead, it's almost a documentary about hockey, highlighting some of the darker  moments in hockey history ... i.e. financial problems, player lock-out.  The information is interesting, but this was not the fun, hockey action dvd we were expecting.",1199577600,4,358,5.120689655172414
8211367,1,B000TXNDRA,Documentary - ZERO hockey action.  Boring documentary on all the negatives of NHL history.  Waste of money!,1199232000,4,107,5.235294117647059
