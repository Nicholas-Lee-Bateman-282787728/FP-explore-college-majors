For me its a worthy 3D purchase to add to my collection. Though I wasn't a big fan of Hayden Christiansen in the Star Wars movies, everything else I've seen him in he's been an enjoyable actor to watch. Sam Jackson (who was also not a great Star Wars actor) plays the antagonist in this one and does a great job. I'm not here to review the movie, since its been done a thousand times. I just thought I would offer an opinion on the 3D quality. I'm a passive 3D owner, though I've owned active sets as well. For me, passive is the clear choice for a nearly ghost-free, flicker-free 3D experience. Anyway, this movie doesn't have in-your-face 3D or many effects that highlight 3D, but its use makes the movie a more immersive experience. If you liked the movie in 2D, you will like it more in 3D.",1385424000,3,925,4.231638418079096
