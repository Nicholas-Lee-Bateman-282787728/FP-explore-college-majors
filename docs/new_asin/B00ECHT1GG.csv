Excellent writing, cinematography, directing, etc. Constant tension, a very unique apocalypse scenario (only the men are affected), great performances, and a brilliant conclusion. If you're a big zombie fan or like Japanese movies, definitely check it out. Easily one of the best post-apocalyptic flicks I've seen.",1519862400,,348,5.711538461538462
8603830,5,B00ECHT1GG,If you like Japanese horror; this a must see flick.  Has kind the feel Maribito (not the anime).  That's the closest comparison I can to another film. Well worth getting!!!!,1442534400,,173,4.733333333333333
8603831,3,B00ECHT1GG,"- Not a story for feminists
- slow
+ ending was a surprise, unique take on a apocalyptic sci-fi",1442188800,,95,4.052631578947368
8603832,4,B00ECHT1GG,"Import films are always risky territory when it comes to the undead as there is regular films, massively extreme films, and completely random off the top what did I just watch films. All of them can be good though some are clearly better than others. This one kind of lands squarely between the last two sets though is quite a fun watch. John Cairns freshmen job in the directors chair gives us not only a solid movie but a filmmaker that I hope were going to be seeing a lot more of in both the zombie and horror genre in general.

Clearly I liked it. In fact I REALLY liked it and you can just skip the rest of this (Im trying to be as spoiler free as possible in the review) and order yourself a copy!

We don't get your standard zombie in this one. What we instead see is an infection type film that turns all of the men into what is the films version of a zombie. Think the rage virus from 28 Days Later for men with more zombie-esque tendencies! The women are all trying to just survive at this point and we follow through the viewpoint of the lead, Sakura, as she tries to mostly stay hidden or deal with the infected with her bow & arrow. Lets just say its realistic here as shes not a 100% perfect shot as everyone else who picks up a bow and arrow in a movie seems to be. (I used to do archery too, thankfully this was more on the realistic side.)

We see her come into her own as she goes out into the world and also meets others. She meets a mother in denial about her son and quite the killer in Aoi. So tons of women who get by in surviving from being on the run or dealing with those who are infected. All of that being said this is not your typical splatter film or full of sexism as the name and thought of Japanes schoolgirls all too often implies in the genre. The action sequences have a very classic zombie film feel and the special effects on the infected are truly top notch as they capture the look I know youll want to see.

The one areas that I was iffy on is some of what motivates Sakura to move forward is when she daydreams or hallucinates about Billy who is from her textbook and look at the very end. Honestly if the graphics here were better my singular complaint would probably haven't been there as I just didn't feel it matched the style of the rest of the film. The other portion is the CGI at the very end which I feel put the final damper on the film.

Someone please, please, PLEASE toss a huge pile of money at John Cairns to release a remastered version of the film fixing these two areas (and more money to make another movie!) I honestly really enjoyed the film and think that even with these two glaringly painful areas that this is one of the better zombie films Ive seen released in the past few years. Hes made some interesting characters and a great new take on the zombie genre.

I highly suggest picking this one up!",1392681600,2,2867,4.166064981949458

8603834,4,B00ECHT1GG,"Japanese, weird, atmospheric, interesting, gory (a bit), story gripping.
Exactly what one may expect from watching a japanese zombie flick with japanese school girls in it! I enjoyed it. It was surreal. This will definitely challenge your senses.",1385251200,,246,5.5
8603835,3,B00ECHT1GG,"Interesting, gooky and freaky in a Japanese zombie kind of way.
Not sure that I understood everything that went on - especially the beach scene at the end!
Worth a watch.",1385251200,,170,4.516129032258065
8603836,4,B00ECHT1GG,"A little off beat, but thouroughly entertaining!  Not the type of movie I would normally choose to watch, however, I enjoyed it, good acting performances and keeps you guessing right to the end!!

Recomended to watch this one.",1384732800,,226,4.921052631578948
8603837,4,B00ECHT1GG,Good escapist movie. Nice to get away from the mass produced Hollywood films. The cast is really talented and the concept is very strong. The filmography is well set up being both aesthetically appealing and relevant to the plot and themes portrayed.,1383264000,2,250,4.976190476190476
8603838,5,B00ECHT1GG,"When travelling in Asia this summer, I came across this film and eventually bought it on Amazon.  It's a beautiful film, if you can say that about a horror/action movie.  Great character development, fantastic scenery and music, a story line that grips you, down there, and hangs on until the end.  It's about survival, empowerment, passion, and of course Zombies.  There is some symbolism and the movie could be discussed for hours, but my recommendation would be to order the DVD, sit back and enjoy a great movie.  Thanks.",1380844800,,525,4.853932584269663
