8207881,1,B000T5O480,I have seen some detritus before but this really takes the cake. This flick makes Ed Wood's worst look like a David Lean epic.,1434672000,,126,4.291666666666667
8207882,1,B000T5O480,"What a great idea for a movie, a supernatural horror flick, that was actually filmed at Alcatraz prison. There were a dozen ways to make this film work, even on a shoestring budget, unfortunately they didn't use any of them. The story begins with a construction crew doing renovations on the old prison, which is now a national park. The team uncovers a sealed off room and when they begin digging, they find human remains. Did the body belong to a guard or a prisoner? No, they belong to Native American, who would have died long before the prison opened, but was somehow found inside this room. After a long period of non-sense, it is discovered that the body is cursed, and causes anyone who comes in contact with it, to go on a killing spree. This could have been a great mystery about some crime at the prison that was never known or solved. Maybe it could have been a good ghost story, but no, it had to be some weird possession story, that made no sense what-so-ever. The story starts out interesting, but quickly becomes a complete joke. The writing is horrendous and performed by a less than adequate cast. The only name of recognition was Jose Solano, a soap actor, who was on Baywatch the last couple of seasons. For some reason, he is in a wheelchair and does nothing but joke about being crippled. Sometimes really bad Horror films can get away with cheesy acting and a bad story, as long as they make you laugh, but there is nothing funny about this movie. Even though it has a creepy cover and was filmed in a really cool location, Curse of Alcatraz fails to deliver and is a complete waste of time.",1390780800,2,1614,4.456081081081081
8207883,4,B000T5O480,"I grabbed that movie cuz they made film around old buildings and inside and outside!  I like the movie, too.  I never went there but it was exciting to see what they look like.  Thank you, the producer and crew!",1362873600,,211,4.225
8207884,1,B000T5O480,"Man, I tell you I love B-Horror Movies but this one is one of the worst. The only positive thing I can say about the film is that the setting Is a good setting being shot on Alcatraz. The acting is horrendous as well as the dialogue, I only recognized one actor and that was Alex Quinn, he was in an After Dark HorrorFest film called Lake Dead other than him all unknown people. It looks like it was shot on a student camera because it is Definitly filmed like that. The plot was interesting to me and I bought the film for a cheap price and I ignored the negative reviews to the film, I should have listened to them. The film is so boring its ridiculous it takes 1 hour to just get a little started and when it does try to pick up it fails miserably. This film is by no means the worst horror film I have ever seen but it is at the bottom at the barrel.

The characters are also one dimensional and Unlikeable but I expected that so it wasn't a big deal. But I have to give credit to the director he may be a bad director but by the special features on the disc it seems like he really tried to make at least a decent film. Don't buy the film even if you are interested like I was, Avoid the film on any cause.",1360627200,,1211,3.9631147540983607
8207885,2,B000T5O480,"The prison on Alcatraz Island can be a pretty creepy place - especially if you believe in the ghost stories that have sprung up over the years - so you would think a horror movie filmed on location right there on The Rock would be something special.  Throw in the fact that the film also happens to be the last movie the government allowed to be shot there on location, and you've got your sales pitch pretty well finished.  Unfortunately for all concerned, Curse of Alcatraz totally lays a great big egg.  Much like the hardened criminals Alcatraz used to hold, this movie should have never been allowed to leave the island.  I almost feel sorry for the ghosts of Alcatraz who had to endure the whole dud film creation process.  This film actually makes Alcatraz look silly and weak, and those evil souls who have been unable to escape its walls even in death cannot be happy at all about that.

I know what you're thinking: this ""curse of Alcatraz"" must surely stem from one of the sadistic murderers who died a grisly death on The Rock - or maybe it's tied to the two prisoners who may or may not have escaped (they were never found, but they almost surely died in the water) doomed to spend eternity in the God-forsaken place they tried so desperately to leave.  I guess that would just be too easy, though.  Instead, we get a strange, long-dead Native American uncovered from the soil in one of the unfinished parts of the prison.  But wait, you say, what about the incredible atmosphere of the place - surely that delivers a few thrills?  Sadly, no.  The setting proves to be incidental at best.

So, following a cursory look by the world's iciest forensic investigator, a local professor and several of his top students are given the task of putting their knowledge to work to remove and study the newly discovered body.  Fortunately, one of them just happens to be a Native American who can tell the others the dark legend of warriors driven mad by a horrible plague and basically left to die on the island years before a military fort was built there.  Unfortunately for all concerned, the group is unable to leave the island that evening, which means they have to camp out overnight in their very own prison cells.  Even more unfortunately, they soon discover that they've unearthed something more than just an old skeleton.

There's a lot not to like about this film, starting with the characters themselves.  None of them are very likable, their investigative techniques are about as impressive as a home plate umpire sweeping home plate clean, and one of the professor's star pupils is basically just a lazy bum who spends all of his time hitting on his female peers (and, when time and opportunity allows, smoking joints).  More importantly, the story angle the filmmakers chose to pursue basically neuters the Alcatraz prison setting and its haunted atmosphere.  Since that foreboding setting is the main draw in terms of marketing the film, Curse of Alcatraz basically hoists itself on its own petard.  A majority of viewers, I believe, will come away from this film quite disappointed.",1237248000,3,3102,4.70925925925926
8207886,1,B000T5O480,"I enjoy cheesy films and budget movies occasionally, but...come on! This is a bad bad bad movie. The acting is horrific, the plot is lame, there is no continuity...

even the last few minutes is horrible...once it is supposed to be finished. *sigh* I better stop or I could write pages as to why this movie sucked some major donkey balls.

save your 90minutes. save your money and spend it on something better. It is a shame that this is the last movie to be shot on ""the rock"". I wish it had done it some justice.",1192752000,,514,4.288659793814433
8207887,3,B000T5O480,"Alcatraz is a pretty creepy place to start with - especially at night.
It's a low budget film, and several of the actors aren't so great, but it's got a pretty cool plot, with a viral infection that creates a kind of ""The Thing"" situation but on Alcatraz. There is some interesting history of the island woven throughout the story, too.

Forensic scientists are trapped on the island and you don't know who/what is killing them, while at the same time they're digging up these remains - something like an American Indian version of a Nordic Beserker. If the director had more money, it probably would've been better, but the production value of ""The Rock"" adds a lot to the scary factor.

I heard it was the last film the Government will allow to be shot there. And apparently the cast and crew spent an entire night shooting on the Rock (watch the Director's commentary).

Worth the rental, some beer and popcorn.",1191715200,2,914,4.62962962962963
8207888,4,B000T5O480,First off - this is a low budget horror film so you gotta give it a break.  Anything to do with Alcatraz is just creepy and I heard this is the final movie to be shot there.  Most of the acting isn't very good but there are a couple of stand outs and Alex Quinn (son of Anthony Quinn) ain't too hard on the eyes.  I liked that there was kind of a spin on the typical monster movie.  It's good fun over some beers and popcorn just in time for Halloween.,1191715200,,452,3.880434782608696
8207889,2,B000T5O480,"I am very open minded, and watch many movies.  Being an Alcatraz fan, I was hoping this movie was going to not only entertaining, but would also show me some good footage of the island.....Wrong on both counts!  I could make a better movie with my video camera than this mess. Poor plot, poor photography, this movie has about 5 minutes of value, and thats it. Rent it if you want, but even then, its no bargain.  I run across maybe 2-5 movies a year that I think are a total waste of time, and this seems to be my #1 for 2007!  90 something minutes I will never get back, too bad....",1190678400,3,584,4.1415929203539825
