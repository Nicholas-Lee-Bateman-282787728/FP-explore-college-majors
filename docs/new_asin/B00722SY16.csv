8508684,3,B00722SY16,"I was expecting this to be a more woodsy or coastal environment and to my disappointment it was more city like.  There are 5 environments to choose from and fortunately the last 2 are what I was looking for so I'll keep it.  Maybe I can get used to the city views.  Also the music is not quite biking music, it's almost hillbilly like and not very enjoyable to listen to.  I'll probably use my MP3 player for these routes.",1351296000,2,422,4.2375
