8344326,3,B001KQFANK,"its an interesting movie. I always think Javed Jaffery is an excellent actor and hes wasted in useless roles. This movie is good for relaxing, its a combination of comedy mystery and suspense. I enjoyed this movie, Anupam and Om puri ,this friendly couple is excellent. I think both acted very well. This movie is about a robbery of Diamonds. Truthfully i have not seen the original one. So i cant say which one is better. I wasn't expecting something excellent ,so when u watch this movie don't expect too much and you would surely enjoy it. Although songs doesn't fit the situations, even then its not bad. In short i enjoyed this movie, and i would recommend it to all light comedy movie lovers. You won't regret.",1301184000,,716,4.6015625
