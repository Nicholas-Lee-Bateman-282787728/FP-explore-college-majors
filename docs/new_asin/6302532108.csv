476649,2,6302532108,"One should expect that an important achievement such as the journey of voyager I and II through the planets would bring unvaluable data and reveal exciting images from other planets. However it was rather disapointingly to watch a great scientific event through pale images in the age of digital video and poor data information in the turning of the century. If you wish to have an up-to-date news about our solar system and see astonishing images I would recomend ""The Planets"" produced by BBC.",991094400,3,495,4.904761904761905
476650,5,6302532108,"The Voyager Odyssey was ranked #6 in the Entertainment Weekly guide to the greatest movies ever made (documentary).  That put it 20 places ahead of Cosmos, 50 places ahead of The Astronomers and well ahead of A Brief History of Time.  Why?  Those other programs blazed no new trails.  They were essentially show and tell pieces.  The Voyager Odyssey has what these other shows lack, emotion.  Emotion about a hunk of iron?  My kids wept at the ending and my husband shed a tear.  This is an experience; not simply a dvd to be watched and discarded",989280000,4,547,4.56701030927835
476651,5,6302532108,"The Voyager Odyssey was named in the top ten documentaries ever made by Entertainment Weekly.  It's not surprising, it defies every cliche of documentary programming.  It's closer to Fantasia than the average television doc.  A work of art that will endure.",980899200,2,257,5.219512195121951
476652,5,6302532108,"In 1990 national and international award winning director Don Barrett (Patrick Stewart narrates The Planets, From Here to Infinity, The Voyager Odyssey, Nine Worlds, et al.) was commissioned to create a musical video  tribute to Planet Earth. The footage was shot on all seven continents and  includes special sequences photographed on the Serengetti Plain, in the  Amazon Jungle, Weddell Coast of Antartica, Alaska, Over the Himalayas.  Fantastic musical score in full Dolby Digital Surround makes this video and  experience to keep in your collection.",964483200,2,553,5.535714285714286
7827150,5,6302532108,I had this lost it many years go but would watch it almost every weekend.  I just recently got it on  laserdisc and it is just as good as i remember.  if you and your kids love space stuff this is a must have.,1463184000,,209,3.7045454545454546
7827151,5,6302532108,I do not have this on DVD I have this on Video Cassette and just recently LaserDisc.  When I got this on Video Cassette I would watch this almost every weekend I loved it as a kid I do not know where the tape went but got the LaserDisc not to long a go on eBay it is just as I remember.  The way the produced this they made the Voyager Probes come alive and I would always think that they went YAY!! when they arrived at the next planet by how it looked when they animated it the dome had a face like appearance.  The music choices were perfect.  If you and or your kid(s) have a love for science and space this a great show they and you will enjoy.,1462924800,,649,3.893939393939394

7827153,4,6302532108,"Having lived through this period this seemed a natural, although it did take me a little while to get into it.  It also shows how computer renderings have progressed over the period from 1977-1989.  The pieces of music used were: Strauss - Also Sprach Zarathustra, Williams - Sinfonia Antarctica, Strauss Jr. - Blue Danube Waltz, Hovhaness - Mysterious Mountain, Katchaturian - Adagio & Lullaby from Gayna, Liszt - Les Preludes, and Respighi - Pines Of Rome.  Though the music clearing house is listed, the actual artists aren't.",1412726400,,529,5.057471264367816
7827154,4,6302532108,"As usual, complainers are lacking in understanding and appreciation. Stonehenge is also old and archaic, but arouses an unique inspiration. So does this video. Yes, at present, my 8th grade son could maybe assemble a video portion comparable to this artwork and perhaps do better. That's only because 2012's computer software makes doing so much easier. Back then, when this video was made, you typed the code into a ""supercomputer"" to generate and move images; much more  challenging. As the disc says, ""At no time was the signal permitted to undergo an analog transformation,"" state-of-the-art for its time. There's an inspiring, relaxing tranquility that this video generates that goes totally unnoticed to those of short attention spans or the ""flash, bang, wiz"" of today's ""science"" programs. The ""mood"" is what the creators of this video most outstandingly intended and succeeded at very well. In todays ""throw-away"" society, there's a mental conditioning ""old is obsolete."" If you're not shallow, you'll appreciate and enjoy this award-winning video, and ride along with the Voyagers I and II!",1346457600,,1100,5.32183908045977
7827155,1,6302532108,"Terrible as far as space docs go, even accounting for the 1990 creation date.  No audio narrator, all info presented as horribly obnoxious overcapitalized roman font.  Bad organization, inconsistent from planet to planet, corny unrealistic motions of the probe, and they gave asteroids a whooshing sound.  AWFUL!",1309910400,,312,5.595744680851064
7827156,5,6302532108,Product is great!! The music and the presentation of the plants put together is fabulous!! We will be enjoying this for a long time to come!! The seller Woody's Books our great to work with too!!!,1221091200,,196,4.472222222222222
7827157,5,6302532108,"I have owned the VHS version of this for over a decade and never tire of watching it.  Yes, its a bit dated on the graphics, but the emotions it produces are timeless.  This is not some dry documentary.  Rather, the viewer is provided with an imaginary seat on the Voyagers as they pass by the four outer planets.  You see these worlds as Voyager saw them.  You feel the excitement of the discoveries as they are made, and you are told about their significance with subtitles.  No human voices here -- that would only detract from the effect.  While all of this is going on, a set of fantastic classical music selections plays in the background.  Each planet has its own piece, chosen to elicit a specific emotion from the viewer.  The selections are awesome and should be cranked up to be enjoyed to their fullest.  In the end, you can't help but nod your head that this truly was an epic voyage of discovery.  If you are looking for mere facts, then you would do better to read an encyclopedia article.  If you want to experience the awe of the encounters in a truly unique way, this production is for you.  I can't recommend it enough.",1068940800,8,1138,4.413461538461538
7827158,5,6302532108,"I can't believe some of the reviews I've seen on this title. Opinions are like rear ends, everybody has them, but keep in mind a panel of film reviewers named The Voyager Odyssey the 6th Best Documentary of all time (See The Greatest Movies Ever Made published by Entertainment Weekly).  For somebody to think that aol Time Warner would award such a high merit to a video that some say an 8th Grader could do is ludicruous.  The Voyager Odyssey defies every cliche of documentary making. It creates an emotional bond between the viewer and the Voyager Spacecrafts. I had tears in my eyes, when I realized that these ambassadors of humankind, would never return to Earth. This video represents outside the box thinking.  It is far superior in its own artistic way to anything you will see on the Discovery Channel of TLC.  But then there are people who hated Citizen Kane.  I guess they just didn't get it.",1023926400,6,905,4.63125
7827159,2,6302532108,"The only thing that saved this DVD from a single star rating was the fact that you can turn off your video and listen to the music.  This is by far the worst proffesional production I've ever seen.
Here is the idea... take some pretty cool voyager pictures of planets... cut them out and place them on a make believe star field.  THEN super-impose cheep 3D renderings of the voyager spacecraft.  HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE!
That's not to say you won't be entertained... you'll get a good laugh.  The most spectacular thing about this DVD is the number of people in the credits.  One guy in his basement would have made sense...
Seriously though, it would have made an excelent 8th grade video project.
Please please please... save your money and buy a DVD that took more than a week to make.",1007337600,5,791,4.581560283687943
