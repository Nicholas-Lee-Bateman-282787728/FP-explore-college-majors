1175284,5,B000001BTW,"I was fortunate to purchase all 13 episodes a few years ago before they became unavailable, and believe me it was difficult then to get them.  I have learned the following from the Carl Sagan Productions website: The  COSMOS series has recently been fully acquired by Carl Sagan Productions  but it cannot be sold until the music rights have been re-cleared. We are  planning to re-issue it on DVD and VHS after the legal work is complete. We  will also be reissuing the album, Music of Cosmos, on CD. I am sorry none  of these items is available at this time. --So hopefully it won't be much  longer for these extraordinary programs to be available for purchase. In  the series, Carl Sagan masterfully guides one through the wonders of our  Universe and lets us see just who we are in it.  From stars to  micro-organisms, to trees and whales, to Johannes Kepler and the  little-known, woman scientist named Hypatia from ancient Alexandria,  to  warnings of the perils of human aggression and foolishness of the past and  perhaps future, and mostly of our striving, never-ending need to explore  and understand through science;  Sagan takes us on this journey.  This is  not just some science documentary, but rather, an experience that gives one  a spirit, an appreciation, and a zest for science and understanding and  mostly for being alive in this marvelous Universe. The photography is  lovely.  The music is full of wonderment.  Sagan explains complex subjects  to easy understanding (his greatest talent). When the videos become  available again, I will be purchasing them again for fear of wearing the  old ones out.  They are great for everyone! The best purchase I ever made.",945388800,172,1685,4.879432624113475
1175285,5,B000001BTW,"I remember watching the television series Cosmos back in 1982 when I was but a child of 8. Not only was I enthralled by the content, but I delighted in the music accompanying the cosmic adventure. I developed my appreciation  for science, astronomy and classical music thanks to Carl Sagan's program.  I agree with another reviewer that Sagan had a marvelously soothing  narrative voice that only added to the enjoyment of learning about  ourselves and the universe in which we live. ....",943833600,8,488,4.914634146341464
1175286,5,B000001BTW,"How to add to the many other reviewers begging for the re-release of this classic.  Even a Nov. 1999 PBS catalog selling NEW videos advertises its new ""The Planets"" set by bragging, ""Rivaling Carl Sagan's  Cosmos."" Has no one but me also noticed how wonderful Sagan's voice  is--I must check and see if there was ever an AUDIO version done.  His  relaxing voice and powerful message bring a rare glimpse of humanity in an  increasingly cold world.  Let's all E-mail various car-sagan.com addresses  and beg for all format-release.  I wrote Sagan on an open forum several  years ago (Prodigy or AOL? ), and he picked one of my messages to reply to  (on the excellent reproductions in Cosmos of the Library of Alexandria),  but he failed to grab onto my other message about his wonderful VOICE!",942624000,3,792,4.742647058823529

1175294,4,B000001BTW,"Carl Sagan's Cosmos was always far superior to the new CGI-fueled series. Sagan offers an elevating experience of science and this series should be required in all schools.
The DVDs had VHS-level video quality that was not ideal but was acceptable.

Unfortunately, my discs came in a case that had cracked plastic, and Disc #6 failed to play.",1514246400,2,342,4.896551724137931

Dr Sagan was not only intelligent, but a performer as well. He teaches with a style that makes you want to learn more and more... Worth the money and your time!",1510444800,2,333,4.0606060606060606

1175298,5,B000001BTW,"Far and away better than the new Cosmos featuring DeGrasse Tyson.  Sagan's tour de force is not only a work of science, it is also a work of art. While he makes his philosophical and theological views quite clear, he at the same time does not denigrate those of us of faith who also happen to appreciate the important role of science and the pursuit of knowledge and who believe that faith and reason can coexist.  Unlike the new Cosmos which comes across all too frequently as a tirade against faith.",1507766400,7,501,4.4945054945054945

1175300,5,B000001BTW,"Simply the best space documentary there is! Not only is Carl Sagan's voice hypnotically endlessly informative, if you listen to any current space expert they all say they got into their area of study as a result of watching this series.",1501372800,,236,4.780487804878049
1175301,5,B000001BTW,"As a teenager I was captivated by the ""Cosmos"" series when it first aired on PBS back in the 1980s. Carl Sagan was a great scientist as well as an exemplar television personality whose obvious love and passion for physics, chemistry, biology, astronomy, environmental science and other related disciplines brings forth a wonderful program that is not only informative but also quite artful in it's use of cinematography, special effects and musical accompaniment. Indeed, not only did ""Cosmos"" tap into my sense of enthusiasm for outer space (that was first set in motion by the original ""Star Wars"" trilogy""), but it also helped lead me to a life-long love of classical music. Along this line, ""Cosmos"" makes use of musical excerpts by the likes of classical composers such as Bach, Vivaldi, Beethoven, Mahler, Holst, Rimsky-Korsakov, Stravinsky, Shostakovich and Alan Hovhaness. Indeed, the LP I once owned of the ""Cosmos"" soundtrack served me well as a starting point for purchasing complete recordings of the afore mentioned. Then, of course, is also the soothing music by the New-Age Vangelis who recorded the title track.

As the march of science and space exploration quickly debunks and challenges previous notions, the original ""Cosmos"" series is somewhat dated even despite the 10 year ""updates"". Even so, there is so much here that is still relevant to our understanding of space and our place in it. Sagan's passionate appeal to the situation of global warming is especially prophetic.

As some reviewers have mentioned, the transfer is sub-par, with a sometimes grainy image. Even so, I'm quite satisfied with this item. I paid about $50 for it new not including tax and shipping fees.",1499904000,5,1698,5.126353790613718
1175302,5,B000001BTW,Bought this for my Dad .. This series I thought was quite overpriced until we sat down and watched it.  I had forgotten how compelling Carl Sagan was.,1499299200,,150,4.357142857142857
1175303,5,B000001BTW,"When it first aired on TV, I watched this series with my Dad.  After searching my house for a month looking for the VHS copy that I had bought him when VHS caught on, I bought this DVD set. I got it just in time to watch before Neil Degrasse Tyson's version was aired on TV.  Soooo glad I did.  It made the new version that so much more meaningful.  Considering the drivel we are presented on TV today, these two sets are welcome relief.",1499212800,,437,4.105882352941176

But when they made the new show, it seemed to get removed from everywhere like Netflix, YouTube, ect.  Why?  I mean, the new show with Neil is great and all, but nothing will ever quite be as magical as Carl's Cosmos.  Just something about the way that he talks about everything makes you love it, and appreciate it more, and you can feel the sincerity and reverence behind each statement from him. This whole series is like bottled wonder and awe, its beautiful.  And having it on DVD is SO NICE.  This set was in extremely good quality, it was pretty much new, in mint condition - I expected it to be a little used due to the age of it, but I was extremely pleased.  This is definitely going to be my favorite DVD set that I'll ever own, and I would recommend it for anyone!",1474416000,,874,4.160714285714286

1175330,5,B000001BTW,"This series and the continuation of it, of the same title, with Neil Degrasse Tyson are a must watch for adults and children alike. In my opinion this type of education should be given/ shown in our school systems from an infant mind and up. There is never too many scientists and likewise never too much knowledge. As Sagan said ""Science is a way of thinking much more than it is a body of knowledge"" and teaching this type of curiosity is a good thing will only provide benefit all around.",1470960000,2,491,4.406593406593407
1175331,5,B000001BTW,"Over the years, first on TV (remember those?) and then on VHS, and in the book that accompanied the series, I have never, ever lost the wonder that Dr. Sagan's adventuring brought to me.  And, although decades have spun by, although another Cosmos has been created and aired, when I inserted the first DVD into my player the same feeling of awe and anticipation washed over me.

This collection includes updates to the original series.  For  example:  when the original series was created, there had been no decision in regard to what led to the destruction of the dinosaurs.  In his update, which was filmed 10 years after the series, he relayed the then-current thought that a comet fragment had slammed into the sea near what is now the. Yucatan.

The updates are welcome evidence of Dr. Sagan's sincere belief that humanity will continue to learn and that his audience will be glad of amendments as he was able to provide them.
.
The key thing, to me, however, is that the series continues to fascinate me, even so many decades later.  I can't emphasize enough that it will always be a hallmark experience for me.",1470700800,,1117,4.663265306122449
1175332,5,B000001BTW,"Sagan's version of ""Cosmos"" conveys the ""sense of wonder"" of the 1930's and 1940's that fostered  the development of our vast modern science.  Combined with the up-to-date science in the recent remake hosted by Dr. Tyson.  The two versions  should be seen together.",1470355200,,265,5.093023255813954

1175335,5,B000001BTW,"The explanations, stories, and sheer amount of science that you'll get from this series is phenomenal.  I've watched it twice in the last year.  The new one is also good and has better visual effects, but it's very much a copy with only a little new information.  This series does not hide behind fantastic visuals and instead hits you with thought-provoking, well-encompassed thoughts.",1462060800,,386,5.095238095238095

1175337,5,B000001BTW,"Yes, it is dated, but still a classic attempt to get the layman interested in science and the Cosmos. I ""updated"" my VHS tapes to DVDs, and though I was somewhat (but not very much) disappointed in the ""digitally remastered"" effort of this version, it was still a far cry sharper than my 30+ year old tapes. Neil deGrasse Tyson's updated version ""Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey"" presents current information on many of the topics contained in ""Cosmos"", and Tyson gives many platitudes to Carl Sagan and the original Cosmos series. Worth the time to watch the original series.",1460073600,,572,4.846938775510204
1175338,5,B000001BTW,"Carl Sagan does a brilliant job of explaining complex scientific theories in a way that people far less intelligent than he can understand. Each episode teaches the viewer something new, but also includes profound messages: about the vastness of the universe, and our humble place within it.

In the cosmic perspective, humans are inconsequential, a thin film of life on an obscure and solitary lump of rock and metal. We are like butterflies who flutter for a day and think it's forever. But we are, every one of us, precious. If a human disagrees with you, let him live. In a hundred billion galaxies, you will not find another.",1458950400,,630,4.779816513761468

1175340,5,B000001BTW,"Cosmos and Carl Sagan, they go hand in  hand. The series would not be the same if it had had anyone else in his place. When this series came out, I was hooked. It began a life long love of space science for me. This DVD set is a must for people, like me, that are enthralled with anything to do with our universe and its wonders. I also have the book, Cosmos, which has been worn thin from reading. Mr. Sagan had a gift for catching and keeping ones interest. This set is a treasure I have longed to own, and now that I have it, I can watch it again and again because it never gets old.",1458086400,6,586,3.9243697478991595

1175342,1,B000001BTW,"""Cosmos"" may have been awe inspiring in 1980, but today it seems slightly quaint at best - in the same way an old cassette tape of REO Speedwagon might seem slightly quaint.

Although Sagan is hailed as a great science communicator, his dorky, pothead professor image likely impeded science popularity rather than enhanced it.

If you're really curious about Sagan, stick to his books instead.",1456963200,,393,5.030769230769231

1175362,5,B000001BTW,An all-time favorite! I'm glad Mr. Sagan dumbed-down all his knowledge so I can understand what he is saying.,1444521600,2,109,4.7894736842105265
1175363,5,B000001BTW,"I remember watching this series when it first aired on TV.  Everything about it was just right; the visuals were inspiring, the information was incredible and even the music stuck in my head for decades after, particularly the Vangelis piece, Alpha, even though I only saw the series once.

This is the original series, though it does have some updated clips in it, as well as a few additional scenes added to the ends of episodes covering advanced in science made after the series was produced.  Most notable of these is the inclusion of Hubble photos.

This is the series that made Carl Sagan a household name.  There was a second series made recently with Neil DeGrass Tyson, but it falls short of this original. That doesn't make it a bad series, it just didn't have the same level of direction as this one.",1444176000,7,811,4.604166666666667

Carl Sagan took me on a riveting journey which formed me into the man I am today. He taught me science and history and skepticism, bringing the topics alive for me and igniting a lifelong passion for all of them. He taught me to question what I'd been spoon-fed my entire life and, in doing so, he fundamentally altered the course of my life.

I've since watched the entire series as an adult multiple times and it stands the test of time very well. I've also shown clips to my students and they are invariably amazed by perhaps the best science educator of all time. I look forward to watching this series again with my own daughter in a few years when she is old enough.",1437955200,5,802,4.276315789473684

I've recommend this to people who have found the look and animations too dated for their tastes, but I find them informative and charming.  This version includes updates at the end of the episodes, but there is still some out-of-date stuff in there.  None of that is really a problem though, Sagan does a fantastic job of showing the cosmos from an unfamiliar perspective, hopefully encouraging a new generation to keep this planet and species moving in the right direction.

I have encountered playback problems in two different sets and this is inexcusable.  I bought this new from Amazon in early 2015 (and sent the first set back for exchange), and in both instances I experienced menu screens that froze, discs that do not display a main menu screen, and consistently,  discs  automatically start to play a second episode even when only ONE episode has been selected to play from the main menu.  Worse, several times the program would freeze up as it attempted to make this switch to the second episode and become utterly unresponsive. (Most of these discs have two episodes per disc.)  I would have to stop the DVD player and switch off the machine and reload the disc and try to navigate around the glitches by restarting the play functions.  I can't keep sending sets back to Amazon and trying replacements and finding the same problems. There obviously was at least one bad batch of DVDs that was released... so buyer beware, as they say.

1175405,5,B000001BTW,Great classic Documentary that is still relevant today it doesn't ram the facts down your throat like a modern MTV style documentary repeating the same facts in an excited and over selling voice over with glossy effects.  It is a man by a seaside telling you a story about the cosmos and how we are all related.  How we came to be and some of our greatest scientific revelations.  He does this with out talking down to you or explaining the same idea 5 different ways.  You either get it or you don't but there is enough beauty and majesty in the cinematography and music that you will just enjoy the ride and won't mind going for another.,1423440000,2,639,4.389830508474576

1175427,5,B000001BTW,Cosmos is what got me interested in science and science education when I was probably about 8 years old. Even today this series is relevant to our world and understanding of the universe. I highly recommend this series!!,1417910400,,220,4.815789473684211
1175428,5,B000001BTW,"Cosmos taught me a lot about science and history. Science is beautifully woven into each episode, usually in the context of a fascinating historical story. Sagan uses many analogies to make sure even the most complex subjects are easily understood to laypeople like me. I came away more interested in science and history than ever.

Cosmos also reinspired my faith in humanity. Over the last few years my faith had been eroded away to almost nothing. Climate change, not nuclear war as emphasised in Cosmos, is the next catastrophe we have created for ourselves, which we seem unable to collectively come together and solve. Sagans words of wisdom, which are as relevant today as they were in 1980, speak directly to the challenge of climate change that faces us. But after having watched Cosmos I feel reinspired. Yes it is going to be a hard change to make. But we can overcome it. We have done it in the past and we can do it again. Fatalism and nihilism are not the answer.

When I started watching Cosmos I thought it would be about the stars, supernovas and blackholes. And it is to an extent. But mostly it is about our relationship with the stars. This is far more profound. Cosmos changed my relationship with the stars and nature. Nature (and the cosmos more broadly) is no longer a separate entity that we must overcome, or control or dominate. It IS us and we are it. When I understood that, my whole worldview changed.

It is easy to be cynical in a world like today, with the Kardashians and the awful things happening in the Middle East and basically wherever you look, some darkness encroaching. Cosmos is an antidote. It is a reminder of what humanity can be, and could be again. As Sagan notes at the end, it is up to us.",1417737600,2,1739,4.5495207667731625

1175436,3,B000001BTW,"Just  finished watching the original ""Cosmos"" - the 13-part science series hosted by Carl Sagan.
Confession time:  I never saw the series in its entirety when it first aired back on PBS back in 1980  I did, however, buy and read the companion volume to the series which Carl Sagan wrote - which I still have in my personal library
""Cosmos"" holds up very well nearly 35 years after its original broadcast; soaring when it focuses on science; failing misirably when Carl Sagan wrings his hands over the psuedo-science of the Great Climate Change Hoax - which is ironic since he states that science can be used to intentionaly mislead people.
This set contains vaious update segements on some of the episodes.  This set also cheats a bit by inserting discoveries and photos of space missions that happened long after the orginal series aired..
""Cosmos"" is Carl Sagan's personal journey; yet it's not an unbiased one, and therein lies its problem; because although he promotes the idea of notions have to be overturned when disproven by science; yet he carries his own prejudices into this series and it detracts heavily so when he does.

My only beef with this particular version is that it's not an exact copy of the original Cosmos series.  It includes some occasional captions that change what was said in the original, such as when Carl Sagan talked about the discovery of Pluto and a caption popped up informing us that it was demoted from planet status.

The series is not even-handed, as it is totally vested in science and gives shortshrift to faith.

The series takes us by the hand, showing us why evolution is as proven as anything in science, exactly how we did learn about mankind(anthropology), the stars(astronomy), warfare and change(history), and the future(futurism, etc.)  Overall, it's a breathtaking ride equivalent to the 'trip' in 2001-A Space Odyssey.
Carl Sagan is now gone, but he's long remembered.  Personally, I wrote to him and he was kind enough to write a personal note back from his home at Cornell.",1413504000,,844,4.833333333333333

1175469,5,B000001BTW,"I first saw the original Cosmos series on TV back in the 1980's. It was fantastic then and is still fantastic now. This 7 Disc Collectors Edition set is wonderfully presented and includes additional material updates. The quality of video and audio is quite good considering how old the original recording is. Some reviews have suggested that the quality is not that good, however I must disagree because the set that I received is really good and by no means sub-standard. There is also a lovely 16 page booklet that adds to the presentation of the whole package. I also have the early hardcover book of ""Cosmos"" and a book by Carl and Ann called ""Comet"".

I decided to purchase Carl's original Cosmos series because I recently got a 5 Disc DVD series of the ""New"" Cosmos at a local shopping establishment and when my wife watched it she was so impressed that I just had to get the original to show her. (She had never heard of Carl Sagan or Cosmos before but now she watches both series over and over). We can all learn a lot from both series and start to think about the future of all things in the Cosmos! I am 60 yrs old , have been a science student, and am still learning.

Carl Sagan also wrote a novel called ""Contact"" that is also a DVD movie and available and makes a great addition to the entire collection. Add the ""Music of Cosmos"" and you have a great array of Star Stuff!! Sadly my 12"" Vinyl Album Cover of ""The Music of Cosmos"" got damaged during our flood here in Jan 2011.

Yes, a small portion of the scientific data is outdated, but the overall experience is quite awe inspiring, especially when you consider the magnitude of what had been achieved back then using what would now be regarded as rather clunky technology.

If you are a young fan of the recent Neil deGrasse Tyson-hosted series and are unfamiliar with the original Carl Sagan series, you're in for more of a treat than you'll expect.  In fact, for the complete ""Cosmos"" experience, you must watch the original, because the backgrounds of historical figures in science are different from those on the reboot.  Sagan's ""Cosmos"" also encapsulates the concerns of the time in which it was made:  we were poised on the brink of a full-out nuclear World War III, and it posed a question as to why there may not be other advanced civilizations out there, which is, ""if our species is typical of advanced civilizations in the Universe, did all those other civilizations self-destruct because they couldn't advance faster than their technology?""  The other thing that sets the original ""Cosmos"" apart from its excellent reboot, is the sheer poetry of Carl Sagan's words.  It is one of the reasons Sagan is so rightfully venerated.  Carl Sagan's ""Cosmos:  A Personal Voyage"" is not only extremely educational, but it is deeply moving as well.  Excuse me while my eyes sweat a little.....

(NOTE:  So far, this original ""Cosmos"" series is available in DVD format only.  Remember, this is a show from the early 1980's, in the Dark Ages of Standard 480p resolution long before 1080p Hi-Def came along, so expect the visual experience to be a bit crude compared to the current digital resolutions which have spoiled us today.

We ordered this set after seeing the Tyson's remake of Cosmos, which is basically Cosmos ""lite"". The new show has lots of wonderful special effects and is updated with some new science since Sagan's time, but it lacks a lot of the intellectual depth of Sagan's original.

I also was moved to watch Contact, with Jodi Foster and Matthew McConaughey, based on a novel by Carl Sagon.

I love them all, but this series by Sagon is the best (assuming one would want to select only one).  It has the most depth, is visually exciting, and is so filled with information that a cultured person would want to know, such as the City of Alexandria, when it housed the greatest library of the ancient world, the nature of science, and the joy in the beauty of it all.

1175551,3,B000001BTW,"I became interested in this item after watching some of the abysmal Fox remake that recently aired. I remembered being forced to watch it in ninth grade Astronomy class, but couldn't recall much of the actual content of the series.

I received an e-mail from Amazon notifying me of a special one day offer on the 2013 ""remastered"" edition of Carl Sagan's Cosmos and I got excited and decided to buy it.  I couldn't wait to watch the original series as it aired on PBS in 1980.

I was really curious as to what the ""remastering"" actually entailed, knowing what they have done to some classic records in this process.  I must say I've never been a fan of remastering old music, I guess I'm a bit of a purist in this regard.  I like the idea of enjoying things the way the artist had originally created or intended them to be, in spite of any technological limitations present at a given time.

I assumed that maybe they just cleaned up the picture and maybe EQ'd the sound of the original Cosmos, which may have suffered over time.  I would have been fine with this.  But it appears that the producers of this edition of Cosmos were not able to stop at picture and sound, but they've also taken the liberty of editing footage.

I had an inkling of this early in Episode 1, when during a montage of different types of people it was evident that the video quality was markedly better in some footage than that which was part of the original presentation.  There's a certain grainy quality apparent to what obviously was a part of Cosmos 1980, whereas newer footage would be much more crisp and clear.

Still, at that point there was no way to know for sure, it was purely speculation on my part.  It wasn't until Episode 4 that my fears were confirmed, when footage of the Exxon Valdez (which didn't set sail until six years after Cosmos aired)and the Space Shuttle Challenger appeared during the episode.  It wasn't until after this when I noticed the fine print on the bottom of the back of the box under ""Bonus"" features that said, ""New Footage.""

So what you get here is essentially the tenth anniversary edition of Cosmos that aired on PBS a decade after the original series, with some new bells and whistles for measure.",1405814400,29,2222,4.508728179551122

IT STILL DOES.
The series has been remastered (items have a 2013 copyright on them). The video presentation is very good. I view it projected on a screen measuring more than 80 inches wide and so problems should be pretty easy to see- there are no great problems. Granted the force and sheer goodness projected by Dr. Sagan might be swaying me but it does not make me blind. The sound is Dolby Digital 5.1 and is very clear without sounding phony. Some of the episodes have had Updates appended which were done in 1990 by Dr. Sagan and they are good to see- unfortunately he looks ill in those updates and I found myself feeling sad.
A few reviews have talked of ""errors"" in the series without mentioning what they were. I found none though Astrophysics and Cosmology are not areas of expertise for me.
Though the original quality of the series might not support ""Blu-Ray"" upgrade I would probably buy the blu-ray, though I found this current  presentation Wonderful.

1175561,5,B000001BTW,"Carl Sagan, in this original presentation, made it clear to every person why and how science has brought us to this point in time (circa. 1980).  He cleared the way for everyone to consider who and what we are and where we came from.  He did not, however, consider the fact that the ""Big Bang"" did not just simply make matter appear, a Supreme Being, a Creator, a God decided to start it all.",1403481600,3,392,4.283783783783784

1175564,5,B000001BTW,This is a great precursor and refresh to the new Cosmos series recently run.  One should see this version first.  Sagan's passion is inspiring and his voice puts you out there in the cosmos!,1402876800,6,190,4.5588235294117645
1175565,2,B000001BTW,"For north of 70 bucks you should get something that looks like it was filmed with a handheld 8mm camera while someone projected from a 16mm film projector it on a screen made of burlap.

1175566,4,B000001BTW,A classic piece of television programming. Carl sagans voice and presentation makes for rich story telling. Although somewhat dated now in graphic style the content will never get old.,1402444800,,184,5.379310344827586
1175567,5,B000001BTW,"I have to admit...when I was younger, I used to watch Cosmos on television just to see and hear Carl Sagan.  I thought he was both brilliant and handsome. He made appreciating, respecting, and understanding the wonders all around us...even those we can not see or may never get to touch or visit. It was so easy to visualize and feel what he felt as he lead you through science (not my best subject either) to new discoveries. When I grew older, I bought the first VHS set of Cosmos. Well, my appreciation was not shared and my son destroyed my set. Now I am even older and replacing my long-lost VHS set with DVDS! Can't wait to travel with Carl again! I wish I had teachers like him back in the day. Learning would have been so much more fun. I'm glad I found these DVDS and plan to keep them much longer than I did the VHS tapes! BTW, yes, I still have a working VHS player too!",1402012800,3,881,4.182352941176471
1175568,5,B000001BTW,"This is by far the best scientific documentary of all time.  There is nothing about ""Cosmos"" I dislike.  I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in science and the history that goes with it.

1175569,5,B000001BTW,There hasn't been a science show that has come close to the original Cosmos. I was still very young when I followed Dr Carl Sagan and he has passed away when I got into Astronomy and science. Having shows like this alongside his books continued to inspire me up to now in my late thirties. I highly recommend this to all ages.,1401321600,2,326,4.274193548387097

1175571,5,B000001BTW,"The series hosted by Dr. Sagan still enthralls me.  Memories of 1980 and waiting each week for Cosmos to come on the local PBS station and having my VCR on and ready to record each episode.  Unfortunately those video tapes deteriorated but now I, again, have this marvelous series on recorded media  I am not knocking the new series hosted by Neil Degrasse Tyson, but there is just something about Carl Sagan that reaches out to you.",1401235200,2,433,4.597402597402597
1175572,5,B000001BTW,"There's nothing like that opening scene where Carl Sagan is sitting the by shore of the ocean talking about humanity and the universe as he gently blows the dandelion into the wind. This is a classic sci-fi series that everyone needs to watch at least once.

Neil DeGrasse Tyson's version is good, but nothing compares to Carl Sagan's way of speaking.",1401062400,,351,4.754098360655738
1175573,5,B000001BTW,This series is a classic and for its time was ground breaking. It is truly a special series of programs each of which  provides a learning experience.,1400803200,2,150,4.555555555555555
1175574,5,B000001BTW,"I watched this series with my two young children when it originally aired and it is every bit as good today as it was then.  It is wonderful that updates have been included where relevant.  Carl Sagan's voice is mesmerizing, I had forgotten how poetic he was.

One thing I was impressed with upon viewing this after so many years was the great care that had been taken in the selection of music and the recreation of historic scenes.  The visuals are absolutely beautiful.  Everything about this series was very well thought out and executed.

Dr. Sagan had that rare gift for explaining complex ideas without talking down to his audience.  These are not just science lessons.  History and science are woven together in such a way as to entertain as well as instruct.  Although I have watched this series several times, I always learn something new with each viewing.

I also purchased a set for my precocious six year old grandson.  Of course he will not understand everything but hopefully viewing these types of programs with his parents will help foster the love of learning that they engendered in my children.

If I have one criticism, it would be the poor resolution.  It was very noticeable when I first started watching but as I became involved in the programs I hardly noticed.  For me, it in no way detracted from the content of the series.  For others who are a stickler for that sort of thing, it could be more bothersome.",1400716800,5,1435,4.638888888888889
1175575,4,B000001BTW,"I loved the show when it was first broadcast on PBS many, many years ago & I'd buy the DVD set in a heartbeat, but...THE PRICE????  Good lord, the new series doesn't cost that much; why in heaven's name can't they do something to bring the price down to a more-affordable range?  Education/information really shouldn't have to be only accessible to those with the most $$$.",1400544000,3,373,4.636363636363637

1175578,4,B000001BTW,Love having COSMOS back.  Loved it the first time.  The only downer is a couple of the episodes did not transfer to dvd all that well.  Picture a bit grainy and minor audio dropouts.,1399766400,3,182,4.294117647058823
1175579,4,B000001BTW,"Wonderful, informative series. Great theme and background music by Vangelis. Video quality fair to poor by today's standards  even after remastering in 2000. Would otherwise get 5 stars. Still would highly recommend this series.",1399593600,,228,5.705882352941177
1175580,5,B000001BTW,"It's hard to overestimate the intellectual curiosity and passion that went into this original series. Neil deGrasse Tyson's reboot is certainly worthy, but Sagan had a rhetorical gift with language that consistently touches the mind and the heart. This series is a monument.",1399420800,,274,5.395348837209302
1175581,5,B000001BTW,So much better then the one on right now. The remake takes elements from this one. Watch it and know,1399420800,,100,4.05

1175583,5,B000001BTW,"Clearly, Cosmos by the late Carl Sagan was a groundbreaking documentary.  After all these years watching the episodes on DVD still fascinates me.  A purchase I will enjoy for years to come.........",1399248000,,197,5.125
1175584,5,B000001BTW,Carl Sagan presents astronomy and other forms of science in a grand and magical way. The show is very interesting an stimulating to the mind,1399161600,,140,4.64
1175585,5,B000001BTW,"This is one program that doesn't ""lose it"" as the years pass.  Sagan's comments and observations continue to resonate even 35 years later.  The ""update"" by Neil DeGrasse Tyson offers some terrific visual models but he was smart enough to build on a great model.  As a teacher, I truly appreciated the examples and explanations that Sagan used.  The story of the Japanese samurai and the crabs gave the clearest and most concise explanation of selection I have ever heard.  His telling of Eratostosthenes' investigation of the legend of the well in Syene and his use of simple geometry to determine the size and shape of the earth is a great example of scientific deduction.  If you are too young to have seen this landmark program, treat yourself.  If you have seen it before, it's worth another look.",1399161600,4,801,4.760869565217392
1175586,5,B000001BTW,"Since I happen to be a scientist, I can really appreciate the time and work that went into this series.  Although I did not agree with Carl Sagan on many issues in his political life, he did a great job of scientifically explaining the fundamentals of the Physical Universe.  Although the world has moved forward, most of his explanations herein are as good as new today, for the novice.  I enjoyed this series and am happy to recommend it to people interested in the world of science, especially Astrophysics.",1398988800,,510,4.707865168539326

1175588,5,B000001BTW,"While the original's video quality was great, it is dated.  Yet, the visuals still glitter and entrance the viewer, as Carl Sagan explains things in his own, inimitable way.  The 7-disc Collector's Edition is digitally remastered, and while they couldn't add details that were never recorded, they captured the essence of the wonder and promise that Sagan presented.  What once overflowed from a 19"" color TV, now fills a large-screen LED TV (except for the letter box, of course) with the same fascinating content.",1398816000,,515,5.107142857142857
1175589,4,B000001BTW,"I chose to purchase this refurbished DVD series because I'm fascinated with the subject of our Solar System & the Universe beyond. But also because I didn't watch the series when it first began in the 1970's. This was mostly because I was accomplishing my studies in Art School & wasn't watching any TV. Just too busy. But I was aware of Carl Sagan. Had a copies of his Comos books & read them avidly. So when I came across this series on Amazon, I jumped at the chance to own the DVD. It is dated visually which was at first a turn off. But it was Carl Sagan who changed my mind quickly. He was a marvel at blending Astro Physics, explaining the phenomena & doing this in a charming, down to earth, even funny way - for the average but interested person to enjoy & learn from. I highly recommend this series if you love learning about the heavens above you.",1398729600,,858,4.269938650306749

1175591,4,B000001BTW,"The series was great to see again after it's debut circa 1980. The updates were especially noteworthy with Carl himself on camera some 20 years later. It is well worth the price. My only disappointment was the ""graininess"" of some parts, especially the ""space ship"" scenes. I know it isn't Blu-Ray but I was expecting a bit more clarity even for a DVD. I am guessing the original production was analog tape.  Nevertheless, it remains a great and classic item that I actually prefer over the new Cosmos (not Sagan's) production that is currently airing. Highly recommended.",1398729600,,572,4.896907216494846

If more people watched this and took it to heart, we wouldn't have the staggering ignorance of the world that we find in the US today.

1175603,5,B000001BTW,"Whether you had the opportunity to view this series when it was first shown or not, this is a must see.  It has some interesting points in its favor.  Carl Sagan is the most important of these.  And it was first shown on PBS and without commercial interruptions.  Those two points are decisive advantages.  Carl Sagan is a very fine host, and streams of thought are not chopped up.  It was great to see some up-dates since the series was first run about new discoveries.  These occur at the end of an episode where these ideas first were presented.  Do yourself a favor:  Watch This.",1398297600,,583,4.476190476190476

1175609,3,B000001BTW,"The original Cosmos was one of the most influential television shows I've ever seen, and even now, with a great deal of it out of date, it is still awe inspiring. I first bought the DVD from Ebay many years ago, and I ended up getting some kind of foreign copy (it wasn't advertised as such). The quality was horrible, and I've wanted to replace it with the  ""real thing"" ever since. I finally did it recently, and I am incredibly disappointed. The video quality is no better than the pirated copy. Possibly worse. There is no excuse for this. I understand that the show was made a long time ago, but I have DVDs of Gilligan's Island and Hogan's Heroes that are 20 years older and look better than this. Heck, there are TV shows made in the 50's that look better than this. Given the price of the set, and the popularity of the program, I find it hard to believe that this couldn't be substantially improved with some money and time, and that they are unwilling to invest in it. As it stands, it's literally like watching a VHS copy that someone has filmed off of a TV set, it is THAT bad. Grainy, noisy, double images, it's horrific. This show deserves better than this. I'm mystified by the people saying the ""remastered"" version is clear and crisp. Maybe there are two versions or something, because this is the worst DVD I've ever purchased in terms of video quality.",1397433600,12,1371,4.440476190476191

He opened our world to a wider view of the universe and raised everyone's standards in a mind-expanding way.

It is striking how it seems the big things were already known well by 1980 - I didn't think the vastness of the known universe was so well known at that time.  He uses examples I thought were more recent - like the clever way of illustrating how matter warps space like a weight on a trampoline.  The show has aged well - I can't think of any good reason to remake it.",1397347200,,427,4.0
1175612,5,B000001BTW,"I was reintroduced to Cosmos when the new version was preceded by the original.  It seems that Carl Sagan has a billion ways to be interesting, propelled by His natural intensity.  The way He presents the use of science to discover the natural world and profile the people, ancient and modern, who did it is a testament to the genius of the human mind.  This edition has ten year updates delivered by Mr. Sagan Himself and an introduction by Ann Druyan, His wife and partner at the dime He died.  I was disappointed in the new show.  The money constraints show in the use of animated episodes where, in the original, it was real people and sets.  It's just not the same.

I'm sure the content is a good an education of the COSMOS, but  I sure won't like Seeing the series with ultra grainy, washed out colors and side borders streaking, That's just not acceptable.  I'm thinking of sending it back.  It kind of reminds me of a bootleg dvd made in China.  It was shot in a movie theater using a cheap video recorder from a seat in the back row.

I must say, looking back part of what enthralled me was the Vangelis soundtrack and the visual sense of wonder. There are some good moments in the series still, for example the cosmic calendar in episode 2; the Einsteinian red shift explanation in episode 8. But I must say, after watching the DVDs with my son, I found it to be slow and containing political undercurrents -- See Episode 13, ""Who speaks for Earth"" I now find some of Mr. Sagan's politics to be distracting to the series, especially the Cosmos Updates added later ...

I watched COSMOS first (with awe)  almost 30 years ago and bought the DVD set because I want to keep it as one of my beloved science belongings. Indeed, there are several aspects that need revision and even correction, but that is what science is all about, isn't it? We have about 30 years of science advancement in between, but for the most part COSMOS will remain for generations (literally) useful and even invaluable in many aspects.

Yes, many (I dare to say most) people love Dr. Sagan and Cosmos.

Others have a very strong opinion about his views about religion, politics and society. However, Dr. Sagan states his opinions very respectfully although with conviction and with the sole purpose (at least in my book) for the benefit and popularization of science.

With the upcoming revision in 2014 of COSMOS, I'm sure the original series will be (in most of it, at least) be affirmed.",1377216000,3,990,4.738372093023256

1175647,5,B000001BTW,"Whether you were a big fan of the Carl Sagan's ""Cosmos"" series when it came out in 1980, or like me, you somehow missed most of it, not realizing its brilliance, this DVD is a must-see. It's wonderful how well the productions values have stood up over time. Carl Sagan, with his corduroy jackets, hushpuppies, turtlenecks and trademark long 1970s-style hair, is the consummate narrator of his own writing. His thinking, put into sound by his clipped, bass tones, is clear and accessible without being patronizing. But the star of the show is really the Cosmos of the title, and the numerous scientists that brought it to our understanding. Johannes Kepler (who determine the planetary laws of motion), Christian Huygens (who, among many other things, determined that Saturn's rings did not touch the planet), Albert Einstein (whose laws of relativity bring order to the oddities of the very fast) and Hypatia of Alexandria (who ran the famous library there) all merit prolonged segments. Sagan also gives homage to the ancient Greeks and Ionians, the practical merchant people who gave science its first boost. Democritus (who posited the existence of atoms) and Aristarchus get big mentions. Great thinkers like Plato are derided as ""mysticists,"" people who preferred thought to experiment and cogitation to involvement in the real world. Pythagoreans, entranced by supposed relationship of numbers and ratios, actually suppressed the existence of irrational numbers (like the square root of 2) because it did not fit their dogmatic schemes about the universe. With these, Carl is not pleased.

Sagan uses Cosmos to teach about the universe, but also to proselytize for his strongly held scientific convictions. One, that the growth of the storehouse of knowledge is good, and that science is the best way to achieve it. Two, that human beings evolved from previous creatures. Three, that the universe is unimaginably large, complex, dangerous, yet comprehensible. Four, that the wonders and varieties within the natural world are accessible to the human mind, and they do not require the involvement of a creator. The minerals of Earth, for instance, are not created ""de novo"" where they are found. Instead, they were cooked in stellar furnaces, and spewed into intergalactic space when the stars blew up. Life on Earth began with amino acids, spewed into the seas by the work of lightning reacting with the primeval atmosphere of methane and ammonia. Self-replicating chemicals organized into more and more complex forms until life began, and continued evolving for billions of years. Sagan's Cosmos is one of randomness and accident leading to the enormously beautiful and complex structures - galaxies, stars, planets, life - that we experience today. For Sagan, these facts are a reason for wonder. Coming years before today's culture wars over creationism and evolution, there's a kind of innocence in his presentation. One wonders how such sentiments would play in today's polarized and science-phobic culture.

The breadth of Cosmos is staggering. It covers the evolution of life, the possibility of life on other words, the lifecycle of stars, birth and death of planets, relativity and time dilation, the development of the elements, the variety of planets and moons in our solar system. Sagan does a bit a self-promotion for his own ideas as well. He helped develop informational disks that were attached to the Voyager spacecraft as they explored the outer solar system. He was instrumental in determining the surface temperature of Venus. He is a relentless promoter of planetary exploration and interstellar travel.

But overall, Sagan is a teacher. The Cosmos series is serious science but is accessible to 6th graders. Sagan goes to great pains to make his language and great ideas understandable to those without science backgrounds. And his images -- a galaxy rising over the ocean of a distant planet, the brilliant explosion of a nova, the extinction of life on Earth by a bloated and dying sun - are as beautiful as they are educational. Sagan's prescience about global warming (the same thing that is cooking neighboring Venus) and his fears that humankind need not necessarily survive our use of atomic weapons, make him a clear-sighted and far-seeing observer of nature and of the way human beings manipulate it, perhaps beyond our ability to correct for our errors.

Cosmos is a triumph on so many levels. It is a work of art, weaving together the strands of music, history, art and science into a brush that paints the universe in colors that are vivid and enticing. The shame is that Sagan, dying at age 62, had so little time to spread his ideas. What he would have made of the world wide web, of the Hubble telescope and of personal computers. But Cosmos lives as his greatest legacy. A work of passion and thoughtfulness that is unsurpassable.",1376265600,3,4874,5.0963704630788484

1175652,4,B000001BTW,"Cosmos DVD set has some problems:
I found out that some of the DVDs have the problem of presenting some segments in grossly ""pixelated"" form, with garbled sound, and sometimes the DVDs stopped playing at all. There were manufacturing problems.
Also, this set contains many DVDs, and I found that by the time that I got around to watching the later, flawed ones, my warranty with Amazon had expired. That's foolish: this is not like selling one or two DVDs at a time.
Furthermore, Amazon does not have a phone number that we can call and report such errors. At Amazon, you can either keep the whole thing or sent it back. The attitude of Amazon is ""Our way or the highway.""

Furthermore, the vendor from which Amazon got this does not give a phone number, either. There is an e-mail address, BUT now, weeks later, that organization has not replied whatsoever, even though I gave them my e-mail address and TELEPHONE NUMBER.

Once again, Amazon has the hubris to believe that someone will rush to go through a large set of DVDs, rather than savoring them slowly over a period of many months. Therefore, the customer will not always detect all of the manufacturing errors right away.

It would do much for humanity, for our families, for our children and grandchildren, and even our own internal interests if everyone took an ounce of thoughtfulness from this series.  This series is much more than 5 stars.

1175656,5,B000001BTW,"After all the years of Cosmos, there isn't much to add.  The series is grand and one of my favorites.

But I want to focus on the parts of the ancient Greeks.  Every time I watch the series, I am amazed at some of the ancient Greeks who should be better-known today. ""The Backbone of Night"" discusses the amazing discoveries of Aristarchus of Samos, Thales of Miletus, Anaximander, Theodorus of Samos, Empedocles, and Democritus, rational analytic people all. They freely pursued actual scientific knowledge, while others (Plato, Aristotle, and the Pythagoreans) advocated slavery and mysticism regarding some geometric shapes and irrational numbers.

My favorite person among them is Aristarchus.  His contemporaries considered him ""alpha"" (1st) in no subject, but ""beta"" (2nd) in everything.  I would trade everything in my life to be that.

So I would watch the entire Cosmos series just for that one episode, to understand how some ancient Greeks understood that the Earth was a sphere, that there were indivisable ""atoms"", that the Earth was 24,000 miles in circumference (and why), that the Earth circled the Sun, and that the stars were suns very far away.

I am profoundly moved that the ancient Greeks understood many things not re-discovered by Europeans for more than a 1,000 years.

As Sagan suggested, just imagine that the ancient Greek scientists hadn't been overcome by the Greek mystics like Aristotle and Plato, setting us back 1,000-1,500 years.  We would have colonized the solar system by now and be on our way to the stars.

That's why I love Cosmos. My high school and college classes never mentioned all that.  The science classes only focused on modern Europe and the history classes only taught about ancient Greeks in the Trojan and The Peloponnesian War.  Cosmos goes beyond that.

I love the Encyclopedia Galactica too, of course.  I hit freeze frame on the DVD for each planet he examines, trying to figure out the biology and society of the alien planets.  But I know JUST enough chemistry to know I don't know enough about it but that it seems rationally possible.

Everyone should own a copy of Cosmos and watch it every few months.

Seeing the good doctor in his corduroy jacket and turtleneck is a bit of a throwback, but his passion for learning, exploring, and figuring things out remains infectious. Several of the episodes include the ""Cosmos Update"" information -- lasting maybe 3-5 minutes.

Here it is, full of the explanations given in fact of all the events that led up to you... well, up to 1980 anyway.  Carl Sagan loves science, and he passes that joy on to the viewer.  Mr Sagan also loves the only planet he will live on, and shows the damage that 4 and a half billion years of using it are doing; of what conscious minds are capable of doing to their home and to themselves.  The graphics are limited to the technology of the period, but the science and information is spot on, even 30 years later.  It is told in a manner that does not require God, because it explains naturally the process of life and equilibrium and balance, of competition and incomprehensible periods of time and space; not in a way that ""wins battles"" or is ""absolutely perfect"", such as the series 'How the Universe Works', which does occasionally imply deistic interference.

This video series should be the first thing a human being is taught about the world, giving a broad yet comprehensive understanding of our history, prior to expanding the mind with Math, Science, and Literature, and certainly before muddying the mind with religion and superstition.  If everyone understood the facts that Mr Sagan teaches, we would have a society of educated, critical thinkers that care about their planet and each other, and about furthering the understanding provided by science and physics.",1359849600,2,1458,4.761904761904762

1175678,5,B000001BTW,"It's hard to imagine that it's been three decades since Cosmos originally aired. A thirteen part documentary series, it won both an Emmy and a Peabody Award at the time of its original broadcast and has subsequently become the most watched PBS program in the world (and held the U.S record for a decade until Ken Burns' The Civil War aired). Not bad for what on the surface would seem to be a long documentary on space. Cosmos though is far more then just that though.

Cosmos is an epic journey with few boundaries and many lessons. Thanks to its host Carl Sagan and its three writers (Sagan, Ann Druyan and Steven Soter) Cosmos covers a wide range of topics. These range from the origins of life, its evolution from single cell to modern humans, the ongoing battles between science and superstition, our own evolving outlook on the universe, our fascination with the planet Mars (the subject of the fifth episode ""Blues for a Red Planet""), the complexity of the human brain (episode 11 ""The Persistence of Memory""), the possible existence of extraterritorial life and our species own survival in the future to name a few of the topics covered in the series. As a result, Cosmos touches on a huge variety of topics that covers much of the human condition and the universe around us at the same time. While some of the science is inevitably out of date after three decades, this is made up for by the afterwords at the end of most episodes and the series has actually predicted a number of things as well (such as the early version of the rovers now exploring Mars seen in the fifth episode). Despite some of the science being out of date, Cosmos is still remarkable for the sheer number of topics in covers on its journey.

It makes that journey thanks to fine production values. The series takes Sagan around the world to countries such as India, Egypt, Italy, Japan, France and Mexico along with places across the United States as well such as Sagan's old elementary school where he speaks to children and the Very Large Array of radio telescopes in New Mexico). These foreign locations can also be seen in numerous historical segments that explore the history of astronomy or various events and people throughout history as well such as Johannes Kepler or Jean-Franois Champollion who became the first person in modern times to translate Egyptian hieroglyphs. To take us beyond the Earth and out into the universe, the series gives us a ""Spaceship of the Imagination"" based on a a dandelion seed that becomes a reoccurring motif throughout the series. While its interior is exactly what you'd expect out of a 1970s science fiction spaceship, the places it takes the viewer to are not. The effects of the series (at least those not augmented and/or replaced by CGI versions) stand up rather well today such as Sagan walking through a recreation of the library of Alexandria, the beautiful ""galaxy rise"" seen at the end of episode nine ""The Lives Of Stars"" or the simple effects used to create the supernova seen in that same episode. Last but not least, perhaps, is the use of music throughout the series from a wide range of sources both classical and more modern including the opening music or the use of Holst's ""Mars The Bringer Of War"" to help create perhaps the definitive screen version of the famous opening paragraph from H.G. Wells The War Of The Worlds to name but two examples. The result is that Cosmos continues to stand up well even against more modern documentaries and is made even more effective as a result.

The series greatest strength may well be in its host, Carl Sagan. Cosmos opening sequence subtitles it ""A Personal Voyage"" and Sagan, one of the most famous scientists of the late twentieth century, makes Cosmos just that. Sagan's sense of wonder and excitement is evident throughout and it is those attributes that makes the potentially dull parts of this series (dull as in topic you might not personally be interested in) worth seeing. That is in large part because of Sagan's ability to bring abstract concepts (such as the mathematical parts of Episode 10 ""The Edge of Forever"" or the Drake equation in Episode 12 ""Encyclopaedia Galactica"") down to a level that almost anyone should be able to understand and find exciting. A great example of that lies in the statement by Sagan at the beginning of episode nine: ""If you wish to make an apple pie from scratch, you must first invent the universe."" which allows Sagan to take us on a journey from the impossibly small (atoms) to the impossibly large (stars, black holes etc). The series also illustrates Sagan's fears about our species seemingly ingenious ability to find new and more deadly ways of destroying ourselves, especially in the form of nuclear weapons. These fears are best expressed in the final episode of the series ""Who Speaks for Earth?"" and its haunting dream sequence. Sagan though makes sure that this journey is one that shows us that if we can survive our species destructive tendencies, our greatest accomplishments are still ahead of us.

As a result, Cosmos is both an epic journey and a personal one as well thanks to Sagan. It is an epic journey not just across time and space but from the incredibly small to the incredibly large and from our species darkest moments to our greatest accomplishments. It is a personal journey thanks to Sagan, his sense of wonder and excitement about us and our universe. Perhaps its message is summed up best by Sagan himself:

""The sky calls to us. If we do not destroy ourselves, we will one day venture to stars.""

May we indeed.",1356652800,,5578,4.72764645426516

1175685,5,B000001BTW,"As I become more interested in documentaries, I was very happy to stumble upon the work of Carl Sagan.  Sagan's respect for our ancestors is his most admirable quality as a scientist I believe.  He realizes our ancestors were able to do amazing things with very limited tools.  The reason we are able to go so far today is because we, ""stand on the shoulders,"" as he puts it, of our ancestors.

Sagan looks back at scientists like Kepler, who pursued what we would consider mystical nonsense today involving pure shapes, but at the same time figured out the motion of the planets when no one else could.  Sagan is able to educate without ridiculing those who were wrong.  He stands his ground on evolution, but doesn't berate anyone who disagrees with him on anything.  He's a very open scientist, and doesn't throw away what he doesn't observe.  He keeps the possibility of the divine open, but doesn't rely on it for scientific findings.

So I have a lot of respect for Sagan even though he did accuse Plato, a favorite philosopher of mine, with holding back science for centuries.  Most of this Cosmos documentary I watched in awe, simply because the presentation of the findings was so amazing.  Some of the findings I already knew, and some I had no clue of.  But I was given a lot of background on what I already did know, which I am grateful for.  Now I know Kepler the man, not just Kepler the name behind a physics equation.  And it's all thanks to Sagan.",1350172800,,1464,4.517110266159696

I never thought it was designed to explain our world or provide definitive answers to humanities question of purpose, instead it makes one think about the limitless possibilities.

I remember watching this series as a kid on Aussie TV in the early 80's and its magic has not diminished in my lifetime of 44 years. The passion and enthusiasm that Dr Sagan passes to his audience is nothing less than inspiring. My only hope is that one day the human race will lift itself from the current rut it has worked itself into and truly explore the other worlds and cosmos around them.

This is a wonderful introduction to astronomy for kids, adults and anyone who wants to know just what really is out there.  It helps me figure out that I am just a very small cog in the wheel of this vast universe.  I still mourn this great man's passing.

1175691,5,B000001BTW,"I have not been doing reviews of my boxed sets of TV shows, but this one I need to mention. It's not just the 13 episodes we remember from 1980, but a series of updates recorded in 1990. And it's quite remarkable how much of it is still very useful to explain the cosmos, in spite of the fact that the computers are occasionally depicted as being fed 80/80 punch cards!

Carl Sagan is one of my heroes. He was not only incredibly knowledgeable, he was able to explain things, very complicated things, in a way that we scientifically challenged types can understand. Using stunning visuals, and taking us all the way back to the big bang, including much of the history of scientific thought, he builds up an integrated understanding that makes very clear one of his favorite lines: ""We are all made of star stuff.""

If you know anyone who is still trying to swallow the Genesis story of creation whole, give them this collection. It's not cheap, but it is precious. It is legacy for the future, just like that gold record that we placed aboard V-ger. [See Star Trek: The Movie.]",1337126400,2,1077,4.517948717948718
1175692,5,B000001BTW,"Cosmos is not just about space exploration. It is about time, the history of science, the elements and where we are from, life and even the decipherment of Egyptian hieroglyphics. There is the coverage of history and lost civilisations such as ancient Alexandria and those in medieval Japan. No series of this genre comes near the level of inspiration of this particular version, presented by Carl Sagan.

It had its predecessors, notably, Jacob Bronowski's Ascent of Man by the BBC, and also a History of Western Civilisation, also from the BBC, even earlier. The producers were probably familiar with Bronowski and decided to be more ambitious. The main personal note about this series is that Carl Sagan is frank about life in the cosmos other than the creatures we know. In exploring those unknowns and improbabilities of extra terrestrial intelligence, we get to understand just how precious intelligent life really is, as set against the background of the cold war and environmental destruction. With titles like ""Who speaks for Earth?"" one wonders, who indeed.

What makes this so special is a phenomenal script that has three tremendous writers behind it including Carl's wife Anne, who helped script the movie Contact based on his book (another understated gem), the music that is so emotional and finally some amazing special effects and historical recreations that would not have come cheap. Indeed, it is a no expense spared journey of knowledge. As for Sagan himself, what scientist could be warmer, more handsome and so majestic with his smile and creative flourish? Indeed, the music itself is so special as we watch a rotating pulsar. Those 70s graphics were so much more colourful and hand painted than many used today and the journeys in an imaginary space ship were ahead of their time.

This is truly a collectors item to be shared with old and young, a real tearjerker even ... love every second, looking at the greatest minds, cities and civilisations within the framework of an immensity of time and loss.

Watching this after three decades, I realised how fortunate I had been to catch it so young, and even now, it is some of the best television that may link to everything that you find special, not just about science but about truth, harmony and values.",1337126400,3,2281,4.932291666666667
1175693,5,B000001BTW,"I would give anything to have been exposed to the works of Carl Sagan during my childhood years. It's only within the last few months that I've rekindled my scientific flame, and I owe it all to two men: Carl Sagan and Neil deGrasse Tyson. Carl Sagan's naturally poetic prose combined with Neil deGrasse Tyson's intense passion combined to create a knockout punch which has finally set me in the right direction. I owe a great deal of gratitude to both of these men.

Back on topic, however, considering the incredible speed at which science evolves, it is simply amazing that Cosmos is still relevant in this day and age. This fact alone gives Cosmos a five star rating! This discounts Carl Sagan's natural ability to inspire his audience, and if I could I'd give Cosmos an extra star or two.

1175696,5,B000001BTW,"This 13 episode series written and hosted by the late Carl Sagan, a famous astrophysicist and science popularizer, is in my opinion the best scientific documentary ever made.

While scientists will find some information dated, as an introduction to science this is as fascinating as ever. Perhaps the only dated thing, from the presentation side, is the computer graphics used, naturally since this was filmed in 1980, when the field of CGI was just beginning.

Among the many issues dealt in the series are the Big Bang, the Milky Way, the life cycle of the stars, the exploration by Voyager of Jupiter's moons, our fascination with and exploration of Mars, the nature of Venus, the search of extraterrestrial intelligence, the strange predictions made by relativity. Sagan scope is so great that two of the thirteen episodes deal more with biology than with astronomy (A voice in the cosmic fugue, dealing with evolution, and the persistence of memory, dealing with the brain).

Sagan filmed this in the height of the cold war, at a time when a nuclear war that would devastate the earth was considered possible and even probable, so one of the messages he constantly pounds on is that we live in one planet, and the fate of everyone living here is linked, so the sort of national, religious and ideological divisions that plagued humanity should be a relic of the past, and we need to be able to project a much more global thinking.

Besides the documentary aspects, the series also includes some parts with actors playing Sagan's scientific heroes, including Albert Einstein, Johannes Kepler (who discovered the laws of planetary motion), Robert Goddard (a pioneer in space rockets), Jean Franois Champollion (decipherer of Egyptian hieroglyphics), astronomer Milton Humason (whose discovery of the red shift of the galaxies would eventually pave way for the discovery of the Big Bang), Christian Huygens (a 17th century scientist, representative of the progressive Netherlands of the age of exploration), French explorer Jean de la Perouse and Hypatia (a female astronomer in Roman Alexandria, and one of the last figures of classical antiquity, murdered by a zealous Christian bishop).

1175697,5,B000001BTW,"The original series was thirteen parts. In it Astronomer Carl Sagan presented a picture of the Cosmos based on the most recent scientific findings. He however did this not with the aim of simply providing dryasdust information. He did it with dramatic flair, and tremendous enthusiasm and exuberance. He was the spokesman for Science, for the scientific method, and in a way for mankind as a whole. For what he was speaking about was our way of knowing the universe and knowing ourselves, and the remarkable transformations that had occurred in this knowledge in his own lifetime. Rather than being discouraged by those findings which seemingly moved mankind from its place as 'center' of the Universe he presented them as grounds for our having true humility. He found human greatness and courage in the search for the Truth, and for the ability to know that truth by looking for itself. i.e. not relying on authority, but rather on empirical test. He traces in the series not only galactic cosmic development but also the development of the human species on Earth.  And one major focus of the series is on humanity's now being at the point that it can begin seriously the search to find other minds, other civilizations.
Sagan often makes his presentations 'poetic' and 'moving'. He is outstanding at reading and speaking for the 'collective feelings' of mankind.
I have read many accounts of people who tell how they were inspired by this series to pursue careers in Science.
There is much in this series perhaps much truth about Humanity I would prefer not to know, and not to have heard. But 'hard truths' are also truths, and Sagan cannot be blamed for reporting on what present day scientific evidence suggests in regards to mankind's special place in the universe.",1329609600,,1772,4.887043189368771

WOW!  The difference between this series and the more recent series, such as The Universe, is astounding.  Mr. Sagan does not present his information as if he's lecturing to a bunch of preschoolers like those other series have a habit of doing.  His explanations are intelligent, and presented with an infectious sense of awe and enthusiasm.

Cosmos proves, once and for all, that substance does not come from the most advanced production capabilities.  No, we do not want to learn about the library at Alexandria, and be told that, ""It was a big building with books. Oh, and look!  Here's a pretty CGI picture of the library to distract you from the fact we aren't really saying anything that would confuse a third grade student.""

We do not want to be talked down to like we are idiots.  Mr. Sagan got that.

I highly recommend this series!",1313193600,2,926,4.654320987654321
1175706,5,B000001BTW,"I bought this after reading the amazon reviews (average 4.8? incredible), and thinking about what sort of video material I want my children to watch (eldest is nearly 4). An engineer I knew absolutely loved Sagan. And I remember vaguely watching the series as a very young boy myself (or rather, looking at the TV while my father watched it).

I've only watched the first DVD so far, but I already know that I am giving my children a gift far in excess of the price of admission, especially when considering replay value. While my eldest is not really old enough yet to be ""grabbed"" by the content, some of it is rubbing off. And already it has served as a mini science lesson. There is some footage of red blood cells streaming through some capillaries. I was able to explain that these were red blood cells, that was why blood was red, and that blood flowed through our veins (pointing out the wrist veins of my daughter).

Before that, the unabashed admiration with which Sagan tells the story of Eratosthenes and the skill with which he demonstrates the story confirmed why this is indeed 5 star material. A little of that science hero worship is bound to rub off on any viewer who is remotely capable of being interested in the sciences. And that is what I want my children to feel in some way. I think in order for them to understand the world, they need to be able to place themselves in the context of the universe, both spatially and temporally. That's what Cosmos is all about.

(I just love the fact that DVDs allow us to effectively ""reboot"" TV. Cosmos may not be ""cool"" to the average person or TV network programmer, but it sure as heck is better than ""Cow and Chicken"" or even most of the rubbishy history channel documentaries that pervade the TV set these days. For a relative pittance, I get to have the classics from video history on all the time without ad breaks. How cool is that?)

It's also a perfect decision to pair Vangelis with this content, Vangelis makes everything better. Especially glimpses of the vastness of the universe and the splendour of its beauty.

So if you have kids, just buy it and don't think twice about it.

The best part of the series has to be when Sagan introduces a Gregorian Calendar as to symbolize the entirety of the Cosmos' existence.  He then shows that homo sapiens don't even appear until the last minute of the year.  That is something that only someone who truly understands both ends -- expertise and common knowledge -- accurately explain.

Oh, and watching this while being high is a must-do.",1301616000,4,566,4.73469387755102
1175711,5,B000001BTW,"I'm not sure if this title is suitable for a huge fan of Carl Sagan, but that's what I was feeling when watching Cosmos

I've read many of Dr. Sagan's books, among them, my favorite being Pale Blue Dot which I read at least 10 times. Cosmos is a great book, but not my favorite, I only read it once. Maybe that's because when I read Cosmos, I was already 20 years old, those knowledge seems pretty elementary to me, and Pale Blue Dot is way more inspiring.

However when I was watching this DVD recently, I was totally immersed, partly because of the fantastic background music, but more importantly, because of the way Dr. Sagan telling the story of the Comos. To me, it is far better than the book, and many times, I was just like the children in the episode 'The Backbone of Night', stunned in awe by everything presented.

I do not have the book Cosmos with me now so I can not take a look at it again to see what made such difference, but that's not important anymore.

This series was produced even before I was born, but everything inside will make it timeless, it is beyond the special effect or high definition, it is one of the highest educational achievements.",1300579200,4,1171,4.382488479262673
1175712,5,B000001BTW,"I will admit that this seems highly priced, but the content is of such high quality I think it would be worth the price even if it was on one DVD or blue-ray disc (and it probably could be). It is hard to sell such a high price tag on one disc though, even if it is as educational and inspirational as this series.

Unlike most I discovered this recently thanks to netflix, I will likely purchase it soon as a result and I will gladly pay $100 (check out the used section to save a little). I was not yet born when it first came out (close though). I'm surprised I never saw any clips from school (we may have seen some brain neuron segments on second thought). Still though, even though the special effects on screen aren't that great, that perhaps aids in the imaginative components of the series.

Unfortunately many educational series nowadays are filled with more special effects and less content and imagination. It is fairly easy when you get an educated and passionate expert (who happens to be a good teacher, which is not very common) talking about their passion.",1298073600,,1073,4.4974358974358974
1175713,5,B000001BTW,"This is science dressed up in the garb of poetry, made infinitely more interesting than it ever seemed back in high school. I really wish my teachers had cared enough to have made this compulsory viewing followed by posthoc class discussions. If I had a choice, I would rather make a child just watch these videos than endure a creativity-killing, curiosity-sapping, fact-stuffing, spoon-feeding ""formal education"".
Yes, the series does appear dated visually, and the ""spaceship of the imagination"" may seem amateurish to today's younger audiences, yet the concept itself is entirely ingenious. For the genuinely curious, who can look beyond these minor quibbles, the sense of sheer wonder in the beauty and grandeur of the universe that Carl Sagan still manages to evoke even in jaded minds, is worth it's weight in gold.",1296345600,3,822,5.18796992481203
1175714,5,B000001BTW,"Although science has made major progress since these videos were made, the content of Sagan's Cosmos remains as pertinent now as when it was made.  This is because he deals with the foundations of modern science, which have stayed constant.  I highly recommend this series for anyone getting interested in science for the first time, or, like myself, a long time dabbler.  Sagan is a beacon of truth in the sea of scams and religious dogma.",1296259200,3,440,4.7631578947368425

1175716,5,B000001BTW,"Cosmos will always hold a special place in my heart. Carl Sagan was a man who had a passionate love for science, the universe, and the human race as a whole, and it shows in Cosmos. He wanted people to understand the wonder and beauty of the world around them, and to appreciate their own small part. Cosmos is a great experience for anyone, regardless of gender, race, or age.",1294704000,2,377,4.4
1175717,5,B000001BTW,"Who speaks for Earth? Where did life originate from? Where is the human civilization going? What is out there waiting to be discovered? This series sets out to answer these questions as truthfully and as eloquently as it can. Carl Sagan was one of the most brilliant men to have existed in his time and still influences us today. The series puts the known facts of the universe so simply that even a child could understand them. The episodes within this series are inspiring and utterly beautiful. The majority of the information held within this DVD set is still true today, and regardless of whether or not you already know this information, it is still truly something inspiring and charismatic to watch and to have.

The series is filled with history, philosophy, imagination, and an absolute respect for the facts, it is a series that challenges any documentary series today and has enhanced my life. I have long been aspiring to go into the professional field of science, specifically in biology, and this series has further pushed my desires to accomplish my goals.

We all inhabit this pathetic little speck of a planet in our small corner of the galaxy, which resides among billions more; the fact that we know so much about it and can even summarize a variety of it into 7 DVDs is remarkable. ""We are a way for the cosmos to know itself"", this phrase continues to inspire me, along with several other Sagan quotes, something that every person should experience, simply because it is our birthright to know everything there is to know of the universe and beyond.

This series is something I will forever treasure and share with posterity in the hopes that it will educate, entertain, and inspire them as it has for myself and several others.",1293753600,2,1750,4.75

Carl Sagan was so passionate about his life's work that his words were infectious, and still are for first time viewers.  You needn't have a phD to understand the concepts he attempts to impart to viewers of ""Cosmos,""  and I believe that most people find it both informative and entertaining.",1285545600,,506,5.072289156626506

If you take the journey through all 13 episodes of COSMOS episodes I assure you it will change your life. COSMOS hits almost every topic from astronomy to physics to biology to neuroscience to UFOs to religion, superstition, skepticism, and more. You can't put a price on the insight and knowledge Carl Sagan gives in these 13 episodes, and he does everything with humbleness and humility. Truly the greatest scientist to have ever lived. You won't be disappointed. Don't worry about the graphics being old and outdated, it's the message that counts.

I was so thrilled to find it in DVD's that I could not wait to buy it as soon as I could... Now I can watch it without trying to connect my old BETA... hahaha!

In the near future I will be able to show it to my 3yr old daughter... right now she loves to see her encyclopedia of ""sky and earth"" and I know she will love Cosmos as much as I do when she gets older...

What a master Carl Sagan was at making stars and our world in general so very interesting.",1273190400,,364,3.9452054794520546
1175728,5,B000001BTW,"This series should be in the national archive. Far more valuable than any religions' bible.
There is a review that stated that this is a science as a religion infomercial, and that is one of the dumbest things i have ever read.

that aside, this series isn't just about facts, its about learning how to think and why learning is enjoyable. this series explores how scientist work, the rigors of fact  checking, the failures and consequences when those safeguards are uprooted, and the joy of actually coming to know the universe.

a few of the first words mentioned in this film state to view it with imagination but skepticism, then later that even wrong ideas should not be suppressed but understood why is wrong. he explains the scientific method. sagan also discusses why concepts like ignorance, hasty conclusions(such as religions) and academic dishonesty are unacceptable if we wish to progress as a species.

don't misunderstand, this program is not an atheist commercial, far from it, its a quest for truth. he seems to have wished to share a love for learning and awe of the universe, whether that includes a creator or not. but to search for such answers truthfully, without bias, and to not use our knowledge for self destructive desires.

if someone is looking for very technical data on science, then they are wrong, if they are expecting the latest discoveries, then no. that does not mean the information is wrong, just the questions it posed may have been answered, or even proven wrong.

_________
the video transfer is something to be desired. in most parts mine was very clear, but occasionally it would become extremely grainy. this series definitely needs an overhaul. not a george lucas type where all the outdated special effects are replaced, but just the overall quality of clarity buffed.
________________________
there are sagan updates from years after the film was released.

overall this is a masterpiece. if nothing else, this is a film about developing a love of knowledge. this is a slow but very beautiful set of episodes. he covers beautiful concepts of scientist producing basic elements of life, the various history of science, and why these things concern us, thus making it personal. to see the stars in their full splendor truly shows how minute we are and vast the universe really is.",1273104000,4,2347,4.956743002544529

After 29 years or so much that Sagan discusses - or doesn't - has been changed by new discoveries such as dark matter, dark energy and the accelerating expansion of the universe.

1175739,5,B000001BTW,"When I was young(er)my father made ""Cosmos"" mandatory TV viewing. For me and my two sisters, Dr. Sagan made the universe come alive! As a teenager, my dad bought me my first telescope. Now, I just gave a telescope to my husband for his birthday, along with this series. I think I will be creating a monster!

""what do you want to be when you grow up?"" Easy answer: an astronomer,of course! However, I can't do the math, being disabled in that area. Carl Sagan brought the universe into my living room and exceeded the hope I had of learning more about the cosmos- I can't wait to see this series on our big-screen TV! (anybody know CPR??)

Before his death, Dr. Sagan left us a dire warning about the folly of nuclear warfare and the resulting world-ending nuclear winter. All these years later, Cormac McCarthy's ""The Road"" won the Pulizer Prize, again reminding us that nuclear exchanges will result in exactly what Dr. Sagan predicted in this series. I think we'd better pay heed to both of them.

BUY THIS SERIES. It's just as relevant and breathtaking as it was in 1980, if not more so. Lest mankind get a bit to big for its' britches, take a look and see just how big the universe really is! For all our sense of self-importance, planet Earth is merely a speck upon a speck, ad litem. In ""Cosmos,"" Dr. Sagan shows us the glory and the danger of the universe we call home.

It is not surprising that Cosmos is the best-selling science book ever published in the English language...and the series has been seen by half a billion people!

Carl Sagan was able to accomplish this feat by tapping into his psyche as a little boy who asked many questions about the universe.  He then wrote and produced the series from the heart.  His enthusiasm and fascination with the earth, planets, stars, galaxies, extraterrestrial life and more is contagious!  He took an incredibly difficult subject and made it fun, exciting and educational for anyone from 8 to 80 who has looked up at the night skies...and wondered.

The book and series are not to be missed!

There is so much wonder and beauty in the universe...an infinite puzzle stretching out in every dimension. Yet even this is superseded by our gift to reflect upon it; moreover, to discover even deeper wonder the harder we look and the more we learn. It is too easy to take the miraculous for granted (or substitute it with lesser creations of our own mind.)

Absolutely fasinating series and has made my husband's birthdy so very special.  JAM",1211846400,,522,4.26530612244898
1175759,5,B000001BTW,"Cosmos is the best popular science documentary/series I have ever watched. Carl Sagan has an unmatched ability to describe the beauty of the universe and of science in general. Cosmos is relevant and interesting despite being 27 years old.

1175760,5,B000001BTW,"If you've ever looked to the heavens and wondered what's out there...if you've ever been into astronomy...then this series is for you. One of the most-watched PBS series of all time, Cosmos stands the test of time as the pre-eminate look at the world around us, both the greatest and smallest. Hosted by Carl Sagan, one of the greatest astronomers of the modern age (and based on his book of the same name), this series was a highlight of many a young person's life in the late 70's. Educational, entertaining, wondrous, even spiritual in a way, Cosmos grabs your attention with the first episode (Shores Of The Cosmic Ocean), and never lets go. I saw the series as a child of 8, but even now, nearly 30 years later, it still has a profound impact on me. There have been dozens of shows and series on the universe, but for all of their modern special effects, computer models, and updated theories, none comes close to topping Cosmos. For those of you with kids--or those who want to remember what it was like to be one--buy this series. You'll never regret it.",1206662400,,1061,4.560209424083769

The DVD version includes updates which are really great.  My daughter is studying Mathematics and Astrophysics in college and loves the material in this DVD set.  If you also love science, astronomy, space and anything to do with physics and mathematics, you'll love Cosmos.  I will keep watching it forever.  This is a great way to introduce science to children of all ages.  I highly recommend it, especially from this seller.",1202428800,2,553,4.639175257731959
1175763,5,B000001BTW,"When ""Cosmos"" first debuted, Carl Sagan's ease and enthusiasm with the material, and an elegant pedagogical structure, made the program a milestone in televised science. Now, more than 25 years later, I find myself sharing the program with my children, and it more than stands the test of time. Both kids are eager to watch each episode, and questions abound during and after each episode, most of which are answered in the program's subsequent 5 minutes, by the way. Many allusions to later missions have led us to discover NASA sites about these very expeditions, some of which are underway today. Discoveries Sagan predicted have come about. And Sagan remains the best teacher of science we're likely to see. An amazing confirmation that science is more amazing than any fiction we can ever imagine.",1201219200,3,802,4.992537313432836

Sagan's brilliant voyage back to Earth in Episode I sets the scene as he shows us we are but a speck of dust in the universe, and his description of the development of life on Earth in Episode II is far more awe-inspiring than any religious account.

The use of visual effects is still impressive even today and music is also used tellingly. Above all, this series is a testament to the power of Carl Sagan to communicate complex ideas in a understandable and interesting way.

""Cosmos"" evokes a sense of wonder and will continue to inspire people as it lives on in the fantactic 7 DVD set.",1197417600,2,737,4.333333333333333

I feel strongly that everyone on the planet should see this.  For people looking for real answers to ""who are we"", and ""where do we fit in"", and ""where are we going"", Sagan provides the inspiration and foundational knowledge from which to begin.

Shocking that this was produced in 1980.  Even in 2007, I watched all 12 parts thinking how far ahead of his time he was.",1193443200,3,635,4.478260869565218

1175768,5,B000001BTW,"The most important visual media someone could ever watch is ""Cosmos: A Personal Voyage"". The content is really light-years ahead of its time for a 1980 production. It is still just as powerful nearly 30 years on and will be for quite some time to come. Cosmos is presented masterfully by the astronomer Carl Sagan (author of the book Contact) along with an unforgettable score by Vangelis and was directed by Adrian Malone who produced Jacob Bronowski's The Ascent of Man in 1973. Cosmos uses the same structure as that pioneering documentary of 13 information packed episodes.

There are countless people who have gone their whole lives, then watched Cosmos and abruptly realized that they would have done everything a lot differently if they had have seen this first when they where young. Cosmos will enlighten you. It is better to be free-thinking than to never have progressed at all.

Cosmos raises conscious awareness in no small way. It is the kind of educational media that every child should grow up with. You will want to have Cosmos for life. If you can learn what Cosmos teaches and retain the information (by repeat viewings) you will find yourself a lot brighter than the average person and probably want to increase your knowledge in the things that actually matter as opposed to things that matter little or nothing at all.

The colossal educational value of Cosmos does come with a price to pay and this cost is not the sticker on the box, but in the amount of demystification that a human being experiences while watching it. Very quickly someone may find that their whole outlook on life will be easily swayed from supernatural explanations to natural ones made clear by the laws of physics and the mechanisms of life, all with evidence to back it up. While demystification will certainly give some viewers a few sleepless nights, Cosmos is also the best replacement therapy for that. Not only will that person feel okay about being demystified but will eventually see themselves, the world they live in and the universe that contains them in a brand new and factual way... with loads of proof to support it. Cosmos presents the evidence and establishes critical thinking in the grandest way any documentary has ever done.

Episode 1: ""The Shores of the Cosmic Ocean""
Carl Sagan introduces us to the cosmos by flying through it in his spaceship. He names the many phenomena that we will encounter in space. After he does this he covers a brief history of science focusing on ancient understanding, especially the library of Alexandria (a remarkable special effects sequence for its time). The cosmic calendar sets out the age of the universe and gives us a better understanding of our place and timeframe within it.

Episode 2: ""One Voice in the Cosmic Fugue""
Carl Sagan covers evolution. The story of the Heike Crab is remarkable. Some of the mechanisms of evolution are explained. Intelligent design is shown to be questionable. We see an animated evolution from microbial organisms to humans. Cells and cell nucleus are explained. We see the actual famous Miller-Urey abiogenesis experiment that may show how the origins of life began. Sagan speculates about alien life on Jupiter with artist impressions. This episode has an update 10 years on as Sagan explains cell reproduction better and states that comets have organic matter in them.

Episode 3: ""The Harmony of the Worlds""
Sagan covers the history of astronomy with the big names, Ptolemy, Copernicus, Kepler and Tycho.

Episode 4: ""Heaven and Hell""
Sagan covers the Tunguska explosion, comets, Earth impacts, Moon impacts, human impact on the world and the environment. Venus gets special coverage because of the greenhouse effect.

Episode 5: ""Blues for a Red Planet""
Sagan covers classic and popular science fiction. He talks about probes on Mars and the Viking landers on Mars in the search for extraterrestrial life. Terraforming is discussed. This episode has an update 10 years on in which Sagan explains the importance of Mars with respect to the environment on the Earth.

Episode 6: ""Travelers' Tales""
Sagan discusses ship voyages around the world. Galileo and heliocentricity and the Church are discussed. Huygens work is covered. Exaggerated stories are criticized. The Voyager probe's mission photographs are analyzed by Sagan, which include images of Jupiter, Europa, Io, Saturn and Titan. The 10 year update is about voyager's last photograph of the Earth as a pale blue dot in our solar system.

Episode 7: ""The Backbone of Night""
Sagan teaches a young class about the universe. The mythology of the Milky Way is explained. Sagan talks about ancient Greece and ancient Ionia, Thales, Polycrates, Anaximander,  Empedocles, Democritus, Pythagoras, Theodorus, Anaxagoras, Plato, Aristotle, Aristarchus, Pythagoreans and  Huygens.

Episode 8: ""Travels in Space and Time""
Sagan talks about how constellations change in time. Sagan discusses spacetime, theory of relativity, time dilation, redshift, blue shift, da Vinci's designs and interstellar voyages. The origin of the solar system is explained followed by the cosmic calendar from episode 1 that is extended into a larger timeframe. The dinosaurs appear as a topic followed by the size of space. The 10 year update has Sagan commenting on the possibility of time travel through wormholes.

Episode 9: ""The Lives of the Stars""
Sagan discusses atomic structures, scientific notation, the periodic table, nuclear forces, the life of a star, the life of our sun, the death of a star, the death of our sun, the formation of atoms, radiation, cosmic rays and mutations, gravity and the curvature of space. The update covers supernovas and neutrinos.

Episode 10: ""The Edge of Forever""
Sagan introduces us to the big bang and the expanding universe along with the collision of galaxies. The Doppler Effect is explained and its importance in the work of Humason and Hubble. Sagan discusses four dimensional spaces, religions, the oscillating universe, arrays and the possibility of the multiuniverse. The 10 year update includes the barred spiral galaxy and the problem of the homogeneous universe.

Episode 11: ""The Persistence of Memory""
Sagan starts by introducing us to the concept of bits. He then concentrates on whales and whale sounds and their memory capacity. Sagan then does one big expose on the evolution of the brain and the storage of information, to the evolution of cities and libraries for data storage, before moving onto computers and the transfer of information into space.

Episode 12: ""Encyclopedia Galactica""
Sagan skeptically discusses alien encounters and UFOs before discussing the problem of language translation in linguistics, Jean-Franois Champollion, hieroglyphics and the Rosetta Stone. He then talks about SETI (search for extraterrestrial communication) followed by the Drake equation and the concept of the Encyclopedia Galactica. In the 10 year update Sagan talks about the increase in reports of alien abductions but calls them anecdotal and discusses META which is scanning for signs of intelligent life.

Episode 13: ""Who Speaks for Earth?""
Sagan highlights the concerns of religious intolerance with the history of the Tlingit and Christianity meeting the Aztecs. Sagan then describes the possibility of nuclear war ending civilizations as we know it. He talks about the destruction of the Library of Alexandria, the murder of Hypatia before moving onto the Big Bang and a description of the universe using all the information covered from Episode 1 to 12. Sagan finishes by an appeal to human beings and governments everywhere for self control. In the 10 year update Sagan explains how humans seem to have understood the dangers that face them with the scientific revolution and talks about nuclear disarmament while speaking positively about how we should appreciate the life we have and the cosmos we live in.

After watching Cosmos you will probably want to buy the book of the same name by Carl Sagan so that you can learn from it. Cosmos is a repeatable experience. In many ways Cosmos has so much to offer that it makes demystification not only easier to take but an absolute essential for our growth. Cosmos is both the initiator and the refinement of human critical thinking. The meaning is life is explained by one of the smartest men that ever lived. Cherish it.",1188777600,12,8353,5.110703812316715
1175769,5,B000001BTW,"I don't need to tell you how great a man Carl Sagan was. His reputation speaks for itself: he was an astronomer, mathematician, professor -- a man of many talents. Perhaps the thing he is best remembered for is popularizing science, and he did that to great effect on this television series.

Not an expert in the matter of planetary science? Never heard of an astronomer named Aritostenes or a great library in a city called Alexandria? Know nothing about natural selection or the Darwinian theory of evolution? None of that matters. ""Cosmos"" has something to offer everybody, from the beginning novice to the professional astronomer. It isn't all about astronomy, either; find here a collection of knowledge of such topics ranging from the big bang and the fate of the universe to the origin of life on our own planet Earth. There are even several history lessons: in the very first episode, ""The Shores of the Cosmic Ocean,"" Sagan shows the viewer the history of the now-defunct Library of Alexandria, once a monument to human knowledge. Another episode is by and large a biography of Johannes Kepler and his association with Tycho Brahe. Almost every topic in modern science is covered.

I will admit the quality of the picture and sound is a bit low. This series was filmed in the early 1980s, and it shows. But having picture and sound quality is not a reason for watching ""Cosmos,"" plain and simple. I am a student at university opting for a degree in physics and mathematics, and I was thoroughly impressed at the excellent technical demonstrations and explanations found here. I learned many things I didn't know before. It's a testament to Carl Sagan and company that one can watch ""Cosmos"" almost thirty years after it was first broadcast and come away from it profoundly touched. It speaks to Sagan's natural affinity for teaching, and it is the reason I consider him such a hero.

The first was the magnificent series by the late Jacob Bronowski: ""The Ascent of Man,"" and the second was this mind-boggling series ""Cosmos"" by the late Carl Sagan. The science is remarkably accurate for it's time, and is presented in such a way that most any human being with average intelligence can comprehend it. I was in my 30's when this first came out on PBS, and could easily watch it with the kids. Sagan's power to communicate to all of us was his greatest gift.  His passion motivated a whole generation of new scientists of the Universe, and enlightened millions of us.  Sagan caused us to dream of a better place, and our place in it.

Dr. Sagan speaks to us today. He proposes a dark theory about the future of our technical civilization, in that the reason we may have not discovered any other highly advanced planets, is that they may have already self-destructed. He could see it coming with ourselves, from global warming to the proliferation of ""Weapons of Mass Destruction.""",1181347200,2,1160,4.814070351758794

""Carl Sagan"" is an amazing person, putting our fragile little world into perspective like no one else. He achieved so much in his life, expanding human knowledge of earth and in space.

The method of explanation is second to none - he has the ability of taking you step by step through complicated topics, laying them out in simply logically terms. The universe workings, the world and the human race are topics in this serries. The ""Cosmos"" serries shines a new light on these sometimes-controversial topics. It's really inspiring stuff!

The presentation and explanations given by Carl Sagan are insightful, informative, provocative and immensely enjoyable watching for any age.  His knowledge was truly amazing not only of ""star stuff"" but his knowledge of human/earth history relevant to the universe was astounding.  A truly insightful man and this series is now a treasured part of our collection which is watchable over and over again.  I recommend this to all with an interest in life itself but obviously to anyone with an interest in the cosmos especially.

1175782,5,B000001BTW,"Having been quite young when Cosmos first aired, I had only vague recollections of it, so I bought it on Amazon, bundled with the Nova documentary ""The Elegant Universe"".

What a joy! Carl Sagan inspires wonder and awe at the complexity of the universe from the get-go. From the Big Bang to the creation of the solar system, the beginning of life, evolution and the rise of man, to the beginning of science. We visit the solar system with the Voyager mission; we explore black holes; relativity; the life of Johannes Kepler, the first man to glimpse into the machinery that turns the universe. We debunk astrology and pseudo-science in general, and learn about critical thinking, scientific reasoning, and much, much more.  And what's more, you don't need to have any scientific background whatsoever to enjoy the spectacle.

Sagan's enthusiasm is contagious. We finish each episode thirsty for more. For re-watch value, it's a winner. It can be seen over and over again, and there's always something new to glean.

As an educational tool, it will definitely be a valuable part of my (future!) children's general education. It covers many scientific fields and touches on environmental issues, history, sociology, and political issues. Even though the special effects look somewhat dated compared to today's flash-bang CGI, they still do the job.

Cosmos is a wonderful journey into popular science that takes it out of the classroom and into an engaging discussion on all that we are, have been and will be, both as human beings, and as part of this universe. You will see how we and everything else ever created are connected in the most fundamental ways.

1175786,5,B000001BTW,"I am showing some episodes of Cosmos (starting with the magnificent first episode) to graduate students in my class at the University of Western Ontario, in order to communicate both the central ideas and the true spirit of the scientific enterprise.

One certainly need not be a college student to fall in love with the series. It holds rich adventure and stimulation for people from all walks of life, and effectively communicates to those at many different levels of knowledge and sophistication. Sagan does not presume *any* prior knowledge, and yet explains things so clearly and beautifully... he not only teaches the key ideas but also communicates why they are exciting. Sagan explains things with charm and obvious humility, standing beside us and sharing our wonder at the magnificence of the world he describes.

This series has retained virtually all of its scientific value in the years since it first appeared -- which is truly amazing since science has advanced so much in the details of what we know. The reason is that Cosmos focuses on conveying deep insight into the central essence of what science reveals about our world (and ourselves). Yet it is not ""vague"" or overly general. It is chocked full of such a range of fresh ideas with so much intellectual depth that it can stimulate anyone with a curious mind -- even graduate students! :-)

I am also introducing it to my students for another reason: Cosmos not only communicates a vision of the world as awesome and awesomely beautiful, it also communicates a feeling for how science can be a nonreligious yet truly spiritual quest to better appreciate and understand it. And since I am a scientist who shares and cherishes this vision, I am dismayed by the extent to which it is being lost, and science is viewed with suspicion and hostility in recent years. We need to show Cosmos to our finest and brightest new minds, young people who deserve to be inspired by it -- just as I was.

1175787,5,B000001BTW,"Carl Sagan once said, ""I believe that the extraordinary should be pursued. But extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.""

So when I say that Cosmos is by far the best series ever to come on TV I feel I need to back it up.  Here are some of the brief accolades and trivia about this special:

Cosmos was the most watched PBS special for more then a decade; it won three Emmys, a Hugo, a Peabody, and has since been broadcast in more than 60 countries and seen by over 600 million people.

In this updated version, Hubble images are incorporated along with some corrections and new ideas in high quality and in a sequence both explanative and deserving.

It was filmed on location in nine different countries where the historic events had happened, or were happening.

Cosmos is what inspired me to take the paths that I have taken since seeing it in school.  Dr. Sagan has always been, and will always been one of my personal heroes.  This special is the combination of all things Sagan and is in itself more of a history of everything and should be mandatory viewing for all.",1167350400,,1087,4.56701030927835
1175788,5,B000001BTW,"I saw this series on TV some 20 years ago and it motivated me to go for science. It is understandable for everyone, but it is not going for over simplicity and it is always quite accurate. Even now after over 20 years the core of it remains valid. It is very motivating and it covers many important facts of the history of science on earth. If you are interested in science, mathematics, physics, astronomy etc this is a must buy.",1163376000,8,430,4.320987654320987
1175789,5,B000001BTW,"I remember first watching this series on Public Telivision in the early 80's when I was in grade school.  Sagan was a professor whom had the  extroidinary gift of inspiration teaching.  I think everyone who watched the series wished they had had such a powerful enlightening science Teacher.

The visuals and Music in the series were just as effective and added to the broad appeal of the series.  The viewer is taken on a journey through the universe, witnessing the birth and death of stars and how life as we know it evolved on earth.  We then learn how we began to understand what the cosmos was about.  Sagan re-visits certain themes, many of which are connected to ""If we do not destroy ourselves, then this is possible"" etc.  This rings as true now than ever.  Many third world countries are going through their so-called industrial age now and world security is even more of question mark.

Sagan understood that if the human race was to begin begin travelling to the cosmos as explorers, The earth still needed to be cherished.  Even in the 80's he touched base on global warming, the continued use of fossil fuels, slash and burn agriculture, and over-development.

Today, We do not yet have someone who can take the place of Sagan.  He was trully someone who inspired millions.  Sagan lives on in this series.  I have enjoyed it many times over and still revisit it.  This edition includes many visual updates as well as some new commentary from Sagan at the end of some of the episodes (10 years after).

One of the great lines that Sagan told in the series was ""If you wish to bake a Apple Pie from Scratch, you must first Invent the Universe"".  I've never forgot that line.  Sagan explores how the cosmos came to be through theory and science.  I recommend it highly.",1163289600,5,1781,4.593650793650793

It's good for all ages, children on up. It's presented in a fresh and immediately understandable manner and completely packed with interesting facts, theories and ideas. I wish my science teachers had been so eloquent, informed, entertaining, charismatic, intelligent and just plain good at teaching as Carl Sagan.

It should be required viewing for junior high and high school science classes - perhaps it can help put a halt to the laughable tinfoil-hat Intelligent Design theory (we were created by intelligent designer extra terrestriasl?!) and creation mythology, which is important as literature and history, but not as science or fact. With information like this more readily available, our science standards wouldn't be declining into the religious-political football. Informed children make better adults. Carl Sagan talks much in this series about the need to test what we know, not blindly accept it, and children will respond to this ideal. Our children deserve progressive science and open minds. This series is a perfect way to get them interested in finding out the mysteries of our cosmos.",1161648000,6,1339,5.227906976744186
1175791,5,B000001BTW,"Carl Sagan was always one of those who managed to spark my innate love of Science, especially Astronomy.  Although recent biographies following his death have painted a darker side to this gifted man, he was a natural communicator and a brilliant writer as well as an excellent planetary astronomer.

Cosmos is essentially a story about the human quest to understand the universe.  Obviously, because of his scientific background, Sagan's focus is on astronomy and astrophysical cosmology and physics.  However, he also displays a good knowledge of Greek philosophy and also the history of science, as well as being able to communicate extremely important scientific discoveries in plain language.

Despite showing its age, especially since in the past 25 years our knowledge of the universe and solar system have expanded exponentially, the method of Cosmos remains sound and especially for the younger student interested in science, I would gladly give them a copy of this book.",1161302400,3,980,5.296774193548387
1175792,5,B000001BTW,"Sagan worked this entire series right. It has

staying power, even after all this time.

In places it can slow down, along with Carl's trademark

""sloooow pendatic....enunciatiooons"". Yet its never

really boring. The thing about this series is its

sheer optimism. Sagan comes across as a guide for us,

taking us to some cool place he's seen and wants to

show us. We go along and, more often than not, we

end up being wowed by what we are shown.

Cosmos doesn't aspire to be a classic, because it

it doesn't have to. It is.",1159142400,8,528,4.463157894736842
1175793,5,B000001BTW,"Since many past and present reviews of this series focus on the religious vs. non-religious or purely scientific aspects of the cosmos, it should be noted that it's entirely possible to view this timeless (no pun intended) masterpiece from wherever you stand on that spectrum.  While Sagan clearly was not a ""believer"" in the religious sense, I think he otherwise left it open for each viewer to take from it whatever s/he wanted, which essentially is an invitation to accept at least some form of spirituality regarding how unthinkably vast and humbling the cosmos is.  Enjoy this series for what it is and what it isn't, and apply your own belief system to it all...no crime against that.",1157068800,,690,4.838983050847458
1175794,5,B000001BTW,"Carl Sagan was the most lively, interesting astronomer of our time.  This series with Sagan as the host is a visual feast accompanied by a marvelously enchanting music. And now it is available on DVD, a great improvement over the VHS set which first was available. You'll also love the soundtrack-- be sure to get it on CD for an incredible listening experience. The thirteen hour series is science presented as an astounding journey which was made irresistible to the viewer by Sagan's energetic presentation and impressively beautiful animation.  You won't be disappointed with this DVD set!",1155600000,5,593,5.103092783505154
1175795,5,B000001BTW,"In watching Cosmos, one feels awakened to the mysteries, intricacy, beauty and power of the universe.

That being said, I am a very poor student in math and sciences. But Carl Sagan's mission was to ""bring science to the people"" and the fact that I could be deeply moved by this program, and still learn scientific facts and theories about evolution, relativity, cosmology and to aid me in pondering the ""ultimate questions"" shows that Sagan was a success.

I first watched Cosmos when I was around eight years old in the second grade. I suppose one could either blame my incompetence and laziness or the public education system for my poor math and science skills. But being a curious eight year old with lots of time on my hands, I began to ponder some of the things Sagan was saying. There are over 100 billion stars in our galaxy. There are over 100 billion galaxies in our universe. One of Sagan's most stirring statements in the series was, ""There are a lot of sand grains on the beach. But the number of stars in the universe is greater than all the sand grains on all the beaches on the earth."" The episode, ""On the Edge of Forever"" particularly hooked my imagination, when Sagan discussed cosmic time scales, and seeing Carl Sagan surrounded by white light, contradicting what I was taught in Sunday School by asking how the universe was formed: ""The solution of many cultures, is that a God or Goddess created the universe. If we wish to pursue this question courageously, we must ask, where did God come from? These are not easy questions...""

To see the wonder in science, or as William Blake wrote, ""To see a world in a grain of Sand/ and a heaven in a Wild Flower / Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand / And eternity in an hour."" This is what Sagan shows us. To criticize Sagan for not being ""technical"" enough is to criticize Sagan for not being dull enough. Sagan breathes life into the difficult subject of science.

I was twelve years old when I heard that Sagan had died, and I was saddened that the world had lost a great leader. Cosmos is an example of the triumph of humankind over its own tribal superstitions, its cruelty and Cosmos is also a triumph of survival in a long journey toward the stars.",1153699200,16,2225,4.5
1175796,5,B000001BTW,"There's really not much I can say about this series that hasn't been said before, in my view Carl Sagan tries to unite mankind under the scope of science while describing the history of the Universe and therefore ourselves.

Sagan tells a story of how all living things are connected, a bond all humans should embrace.",1151625600,10,318,4.678571428571429
1175797,5,B000001BTW,"""The Cosmos is all that is or ever was or ever will be.  Our feeblest contemplations of the Cosmos stir us -- there is a tingling in the spine, a catch in the voice, a faint sensation, as if a distant memory, of falling from a height.  We know we are approaching the greatest of mysteries.""

Carl Sagan was an amazing man.  He was a Pulitzer-prize winning author and director of the Laboratory for Planetary Studies at Cornell University.  He was an American astronomer, astrobiologist, and highly successful science popularizer.  He pioneered exobiology and promoted the Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence.  Even so, I believe his largest achievement was in his capability to convey his ideas, which allowed so many people to better understand the cosmos.  His award-winning series, first broadcast in 1980, covered a wide range of scientific subjects including the origin of life and a perspective of our place in the universe.

Conceived and hosted by Dr. Sagan, Cosmos dragged science out of the classroom and into real life, using a then-revolutionary mix of on-location segments shot around the world, cutting edge special effects, computer graphics, historical recreations and more to explain intricate, often abstract concepts to the average person.  Sagan's phrases are carefully chosen, his analogies focused and fascinating.  He relies on history -- mostly ancient -- to prove his points, and spends a great deal of time lamenting the loss of astounding antiquities (the Library at Alexandria in Egypt for one).

In 1990, for the 10th anniversary of the series, Sagan filmed new epilogues for each episode in which he discussed new discoveries (and alternate viewpoints) that had arisen since the original broadcast.  These are included at the end of several episodes.  It is amazing, however, how few revisions and updates this series needs, as the science contained in these episodes is still hugely valid today.

Cosmos is presented in newly enhanced and remastered video and looks great, even on my Sony 36"" HD screen.  The show's color palette is vibrant and balanced, the result of the color-correcting done on the series specifically for this release, and there is minimal grain and debris in the print.  The restoration quality is remarkable considering this series is over 26 years old.  Occasionally new images from the Hubble telescope are inserted into the episodes to replace artist renderings from 1980, and they look spectacular.  Also, new 3D animation was incorporated into some segments, and occasionally more recent video material was added; for example, footage of the Exxon Valdez oil spill now appears in a segment on ecological disasters.

The audio is impressive as well.  A new 5.1 mix, supervised by Cosmos sound designer Kent Gibson, was created from the original mono audio stems.  The grand musical score benefits enormously; if you have a 5.1 set-up you will notice it from the opening of the first episode.  Sagan's narration always remains clear.  In addition, there is an isolated musical score & sound effects track, also in 5.1.

It is truly amazing how relevant this series still is today.  Sagan's message of cherishing life is truly universal, and his warnings about runaway greenhouse warming and nuclear war are just as pertinent today, perhaps even more so than in 1980.  The episodes each provide a wealth of information and insight, but also pose some questions, which prompts you to think a little yourself on the topics.  I simply can't recommend this release highly enough, as it is the most insightful and entertaining science series ever made, and a tribute to the man who dedicated his life to the ideal of understanding ourselves and the cosmos from which we spring.",1150243200,31,8602,5.3630239520958085
1175798,5,B000001BTW,"Everyone is entitled to thier own opinion...and here is mine. SUDOKU IS AN ABSOLUTE FOOL. I like the old Star Trek, it was a great TV show. But to draw somekind comparison of a TV show of Fantasy and Science Fiction to COSMOS which questions our very existence on a spiritual level tells me SUDOKU completely missed the message. Obviously SUDOKU was someone that watched the show simply for the 'special effects'. People like SUDOKU are the reason why America is so far behind the rest of the world in Science and Math. I bet SUDOKU voted for BUSH and thinks he's doing a great job too. Carl Sagan embodies the marriage of spirituality and science in this DVD set as well as all of his work. Physics/Cosmology was his religion...and it is mine as well. This is definitly a program that i will show to my children. I watched this with my father when it was on TV and it created a thirst for knowledge that I still have today. Sorry for my rant...but someone has to speak up for the deceased.",1147219200,9,990,4.415300546448087
1175799,5,B000001BTW,"I first watched Cosmos when I began college in 1980.  It was outstanding then and it has aged well.  I can still sit through all 13 episodes in one sitting.  Sagan teaches, to anyone listening, that one can find spiritual experiences in nature, and in our incredible ability to make sense of nature, rather than in just explaining away all of existence by relying on primitive mythology.  Most of all, Sagan shows how the journey is just as important as the destination.  I recommend Cosmos to any student of any science, or to any thinking member of the reality-based community.  ""If we do not destroy ourselves,"" Cosmos will be long-remembered as a 20th Century classic.",1147046400,7,672,4.8
1175800,5,B000001BTW,"+++++

This landmark series narrated and co-written by astronomer, astrophysicist, professor, and author Dr. Carl Edward Sagan (Nov. 1934 to Dec. 1996) is the most watched series in public television history.

Sagan takes us on ""a personal voyage"" through the cosmos (from the Greek meaning universe, harmony) in his ""ship of the imagination.""

To me, this series is and was so popular for many reasons.  One reason is the diversified scientific information (especially historical information) it presents.  Along with this you have Sagan's narration with his deep, articulate, punctuating voice.  As well, the background music (classical, electronic, and even some ""Pink Floyd"") is superb and all images (with some new footage) are mesmerizing.

There are many things Sagan says that makes you think.  For example, the words that title this review are the first words Sagan utters.  Other personal favorite quotations include:

(1) ""The suppression of uncomfortable ideas may be common in religion and politics but it is not the path to knowledge.  And there's no place for it in the endeavor of science.""

(2) ""If you wish to make an apple pie from scratch, you must first invent the universe.""

(3) ""Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.""

(4) ""The Earth and every living thing are made of star stuff.""

(5) ""You have to know the past to understand the present.""

There is no need to update this series.  However, brief updates are provided for many episodes.  Sagan narrates these updates that were recorded a decade after the original broadcast.

To get an idea of the wide-range of topics covered, I will give the names of the chapters or scenes of each episode.  Note that each episode begins with an ""opening"" and finishes with ""end credits.""  (The exception is episode #1 that has an ""Ann Druyan Introduction""-Druyan was Sagan's third and final wife as well as the co-writer of this series along with Steven Soter-before the opening.)

The DVDs are practically perfect in picture and sound quality.  All the DVDs are remastered, restored, and enhanced.

Finally, there is a book titled ""Cosmos"" (1980).  Sagan elaborates in this book: ""The book and the television series evolved together.  In some sense each is based on the other...[the] book goes more deeply into many topics than does the television series...each episode of the television series follows fairly closely the corresponding chapter of [the] book; and...the pleasure of each will be enhanced by reference to the other.""

In conclusion, if you want to learn something and be entertained at the same time, then you must see this landmark series!!!

(First broadcast on PBS in 1980;  updates recorded 1990;  13 one hour episodes;  full screen;  7 discs)

1175802,1,B000001BTW,"I rented the 13 episode series after having watched a portion on PBS, thinking that it seemed like a good watch. How wrong I was. This is nothing more than a New Age brainwashing series. The music, often Vangelis, repeating the same things over and over, does nothing but brainwash and dumb the viewer. The overall purpose of the video series is a ""science as religion"" infommercial (and perhaps a means of self-worship -- he seems to enjoy the sound of his own voice). Sagan, as it should by now now be widely known, himself engaged in his fair share of pseudoscience. He is best described as a sci-fi writer pretending to be a scientist. By accusing others of pseudoscience, he was able to divert attention away from his own pseudoscience because clearly, anyone accusing anyone else of something can't possibly be doing the same thing. That would be hypocritical! And, after almost 30 years, the tapes still sell for this ridiculous price. Save yourself the time and/or money and restrict yourself to series about real science.

He takes us on exploration from the begining of time through now and to the future. All the while he focuses on many of the general scientific (and psuedoscientific) ideas and controversies you've heard of - the big bang, evolution, alien life, the solar system, our own planet earth, DNA, and many others - and deconstructs them to their basic parts, showing us their history and relationship to us and the cosmos.  Some of the information is a bit outdated, but many of the episodes are ended with updates.  The music is beautiful, and the video is loaded with amazing imagery.  Some of my favorite video from the set was seeing the Great Red Spot on Jupiter in motion, and the physics of a spiral galaxy seen through a computer.  This set really provides and appreciative look at our surrounding universe and the universe within -- we have yet to destroy ourselves, and with the help of more learning entertainment like this, I think one day we may further reach for the stars.",1140652800,9,1081,4.7287234042553195
1175805,5,B000001BTW,"Watching COSMOS was one of the most influential experiences of my early teens. It sent me off on dozens of areas of interest and research that continue to this day, and I've always had a fondness for Carl Sagan for giving me that gift. Unfortunately, I gradually forgot what the show itself was like, without ever forgetting how influential it had been. I had even forgotten about the lovely music. So I have wanted to purchase the COSMOS DVD set for quite some time.

To be honest, I was concerned that the 25 year old special effects might weaken its appeal while viewing it again as an adult. But now that I've seen it again I realize that it was never the graphics (state-of-the-art as they were at the time) that inspired me so much. In a way, it wasn't even the content, since you could find most of the content elsewhere. It was simply watching Carl Sagan's natural sense of wonder, curiosity and awe, which is something we just don't see in people anymore. Sagan was utterly fascinated by the Cosmos, and COSMOS seems at times more like a love letter more than a science documentary. It's contagious. Watching COSMOS, I felt exactly the same way I did when I was a kid--like there was a whole universe out there just waiting to be discovered and explored--by me!

What a shame that the bureacracy and stupidity of politicians, lawyers, and businessmen who can't even conceive of what ""wonder and awe"" means (they prefer ""shock and awe""), have forced us all to waste our precious lives pushing papers and sitting inside concrete tomb offices all day, every day. I like Sagan's world better.

Get this box set--the high price is worth it many times over--and if you do not feel inspired and passionate about the world you live in afterwards, you're either dead, or you're a politician, lawyer or businessman.",1139097600,13,1814,4.6625

1175809,5,B000001BTW,"Even though ""Cosmos"" is 25 years old (which is an eternity in today's  society), Cosmos is still one of the best works where science meets television. The late Carl Sagan blends the history of science, the history of the Earth, with everything else out there in the Universe, in an educational journey through the Cosmos.

25 years later some of the things mentioned may not be necessarily so anymore, but overall it has remarkable educational value. If all you want to see is space and stars and planets you may be disappointed as Carl Sagan spends a lot of time on Earth. If you cannot concentrate for more than a few milliseconds at a time, you may be annoyed by the strategically placed pauses.

Another recurring theme of note in the series: This was created at a time where science was adamant about creating a clear separation between science and mysticism. This is evident in some of Carl Sagan's comments, and you may enjoy some of his clever one-liners on this.",1133827200,16,971,4.666666666666667
1175810,5,B000001BTW,"Carl Sagan's exquisitely crafted series, Cosmos, is by any standards a masterpiece... perhaps the most important television series ever made! As Dr Sagan takes us through the cosmos on his inspirational Ship of the Imagination, his almost child-like enthusiasm and evocative presentation leave a lasting impression.

As a species, he points out, we are ""poised on the edge of forever"". Yet there is a sense of foreboding. Twenty five years on, we are still pre-occupied with military madness instead of feeding our fellow humans and treating those a little different from us with dignity and respect. How different things could be if we took Dr Sagan's message into our schools and encouraged our teachers to become as passionate about truth and critical thought as Dr Sagan. Maybe then the world would be as beautiful as the cosmos he reveals to us.

Sagan has little time for organised religion - it was religious zeal that brought about the destruction of the greatest institution the world has ever known, the Great Library of Alexandria - a seven hundred year old storehouse of knowledge, burned to the ground by those consumed by small-minded religious ignorance. Yet Cosmos is a deeply spiritual journey, one that defies us to separate philosophy from science, spirituality from rational thought.

It is said that the greatest thing we can do is to touch another soul. Carl Sagan has touched the heart and soul of millions and has bequeathed a priceless gift to all humankind and for a handful of dollars you can own your own copy. Don't ask ""can I justify spending this much on a DVD set?"" Just buy it - sell something if you have to. By owning a copy of Cosmos, you will be rich beyond measure.

1175819,5,B000001BTW,"""Cosmos Boxed Set"" reveals Carl Sagan's passion for astronomy. It also shows that Carl Sagan had the ability to think far ahead into the future of humanity. He was a visionary for the whole of humanity and not just an ""ordinary"" astronomer. But he failed to give his own insights in the spiritual aspect of the universe he was studying; giving scant references to God from his analysis. (a common occurrence in the field of astronomy!)

But this is indeed a truly mesmerizing documentary. Surprisingly, the opening music is mystical in nature and Carl does indeed give some references to the Hindu philosophy of the creation of the universe. But he failed to derive his own philosophical conclusions on the origin of the cosmos.

Carl Sagan had a deep love for humanity and this is evident in the last few episodes of the documentary. He really cares for this planet and yearns for humanity to progress far morally as well as scientifically for the benefit of our future generations. This is truly inspiring and I wish that there would be more ""Carl Sagans"" being born in our planet soon! His death was a great loss to humanity.

On a side note, God had revealed to Neale Donald Walsh (author of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Complete-Conversations-with-God-Boxed-Set/dp/0399153292/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Complete Conversations with God (Boxed Set)</a>&nbsp;series), that Carl Sagan is enjoying his time in heaven. Carl Sagan's birth was a gift to humanity and his ""death"" was not in vain. It was God Himself who inspired Sagan to consider the possibilities of the existence of other universes and life on other planets. His documentary on the Hindu concept of the universe was absolutely correct (it is similar with God's revelation in the ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Complete-Conversations-with-God-Boxed-Set/dp/0399153292/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Complete Conversations with God (Boxed Set)</a>&nbsp;series"") and God Himself/Herself/Itself told Walsh that the universe will be destroyed in the far future and a new one will be created again.

In short, I would recommend this DVD to all those with the desire to know more about astronomy. It will definitely broaden one's own thinking about our place in the cosmos.",1120089600,5,2332,5.654285714285714

The next day I ran down to the library to read everything and anything I could about space and the stars and planets.  His gift to me and my generation was the gift of wonder.  To go outside on a dark night, look up and wonder, ""whats out there?"" or ""how far is that star from here?"".  Our kids need to have that sense of wonder and imagination.  If you have children, buy this DVD set and let your childrens imagination and wonder be set free.  It is something they will use when they grow up.

Not only does Sagan break down complex science into simple to understand concepts, but he does it with so much infectious enthusiasm. You can't help but feel awe and amazement when you follow his presentations on the greatness of science.

Sagan also brilliantly shows how chemistry, geography, biology, history, geology, evolution, physics, geometry, and astronomy are all intertwined, and to understand these subjects means to understand the cosmos, and to understand the cosmos means to understand humanity.

Watching this series, I felt so encouraged and uplifted. I felt that although our global society is in major turmoil, yes, there is hope for change. In the last episode where he speaks about the threat of nuclear weapons, I could see that this is a man who cares so much about humanity.

Never has a television show given me the type of hope and encouragement that Cosmos did. In our world, with the major difficulties we face, Sagan combats the delusions of our time weilding common sense and reason as his weapons.

He was a very special person and a great loss to be taken relatively young.

I have been chasing this series for years, it had been re-broadcast but in a different form, modified and reduced some years later so I was keen one day to get my hands on the whole series in whatever format. The DVD Production is excellent, well packaged and will certainly be shown to my young children once they are a little older (they are very young at present).

I returned a week or so later and decided to pick it up. I'm so glad I did. The book was a very enjoyable read, one of my favorite books of all time. Like other reviewers, I was humbled. I became curious about the TV series that Sagan mentions in the beginning of the book. I had never heard of it before, and decided to check Amazon to see if it was available on DVD. Sure enough, it was, but at a hefty price. I eventually decided to splurge and buy the set. For three days I was awed by and engrossed in this amazing documentary series. All of the ideas in the book are present, plus more. It gave me a much greater understanding of all elements of the book. Carl Sagan is also an amazing narrator, his voice and enthusiam drawing you in. Now that I have finished watching Cosmos (some episodes more than once), I can't wait until I watch them again. I am an engineering student, and math and science have always been my main interests. I have enjoyed reading many science/math related non-fiction books in the past.

I almost gave up on the series until a freak event allowed me to view Episode 13 in hopistal (I ran across a six lane highway and got hit by a car, so I watched Episode 13 in my bed while my leg was in a plaster in hopistal.)
I was so amazed and awed by that one episode that I wanted to see the 12 episodes I missed. I had to wait until December 2003 to order the DVD box set.

1175828,5,B000001BTW,"This review refers to the DVD box set of the 13-episode series, ""Cosmos.""

I first watched this series (not the original airing in 1980, but its late 80s re-playing) while I was in middle school, perhaps the summer between Grade 7 and 8. Though I had been interested in science as a young child, that interest had waned as I entered my teens. Still, after watching the first episode, ""The Shores of the Cosmic Ocean"" while siting in my basement trying to avoid the heat of a Saskatchewan sun, my interest in science emerged once more and I ended up watching the entire series. Years later, I decided to buy the ""Cosmos"" collector's edition. I was at first worried that the series would not have stood the test of time. My concerns were unfounded as I was once again transported on my own voyage of the imagination.

One thing that one will notice is that new footage has been added, such as images from the Hubble telescope. These new images are not obtrusive and even most purists will not object to their inclusion. Most of the discs also include updates on the science behind ""Cosmos.""

Though this point has been time and time again, perhaps the greatest legacy that Carl Sagan left to us is how he was able to popularize science for the masses. While presenting a picture of a vast universe, one in which humanity is neither noteworthy nor the end result of the universe's creation, Sagan does not make the viewer feel insignificant or forlorn. Rather, the viewer is filled with a sense of awe and is inspired by the possibilities the cosmos holds for our species. It really isn't hyperbole when I claim that, for many, ""Cosmos"" is a spiritual, as well as an intellectual, journey.",1097107200,53,1686,4.613333333333333

1175830,5,B000001BTW,"After watching COSMOS for the third time, I am continously impressed by the bravery and insight of Dr. Sagan's vision for humanity. COSMOS's overarching theme is an introduction to the natural sciences for the general public. Astronomy, Biology, Chemistry and Mathematics are wonderfully reduced to their core concepts. Dr. Sagan may be the only person I know who manages to explain Einstein's special relativity without algebra. For those amongst the general public who wish to understand just what a four dimensioned universe is, there is no better series today than COSMOS. Dr. Sagan stays true to his populist belief that science belongs not only to the scientists, but to all humanity.
However, anyone with a university degree will probably be familiar with the science Dr. Sagan speaks of. The shining jewel of COSMOS is not its scientific content, but its deeply humanistic message of hope. We have all heard about the cruelty of the so called ""real world"" and ""human nature."" But Dr. Sagan shows us that human bravery and intelligence has transformed our world for the better and that our world is what we make of it. In one of the most poignant moments of the entire series, Dr. Sagan describes the human longing for an explanation of the universe as an eternal part of our species. We, citizens of the 21st century, are the first generation of human beings priviledged with some of the answers to the questions that have fascinated our ancestors.
Dr. Sagan also outlines the philosophy and history of science. This is especially essential to today's society in which science has become increasing gadgety. While cell phones, computers, the internet, designer drugs populate every segment of our society, the philosophy of critical thinking, factual analysis and of questioning every statement, the very heart of science remains as rare today as ever. Our present civlization is forever indebited to those brave men and women who choose the pain of truth rather the comfort of lies. For those who ever wondered how we human beings progressed from tribal hunters to technogical beings, Dr. Sagan's documentary provides a riveting account.
Finally and perhaps most importantly, Dr. Sagan's documentary provides a unifying vision for the future of human kind. We have reached a time in the development of our species when the power in our hands is extraordinary.  The destiny of our world and our species is fully in the our own hands. We can either use this power to continously squabble amongst ourselves, to fight our pointless wars and to poison our environment with blatant waste and race headlong to self annihilation, or... we can set aside our differences, recognize the fragility of our world and embrace the common destiny of humanity to explore the final frontier. Dr. Sagan does not pretend that this journey will be an easy one; every age and time has had those who would at the expense of our world, stirr up hatred, fear and greed. However, by showing that science is our candle in the dark, Dr. Sagan encourages each one of us to struggle against the irrationality and ignorance inside each of us to literally reach for the stars.
From the beginning of time to the future of our world, Dr. Sagan's account of the struggle of the human mind to attain sentience is highly passionate while at the same time even and objective. Science, he describes, is the ultimate manifestation of our humanity, the quest of starstuff to understand itself.
I am pleased to say that as the light from Dr. Sagan's house continue to pierce the darkness of Ithaca's gorges to inspire me, so too does his visionary work: COSMOS.",1089504000,24,3627,4.9361702127659575

And there was also an interview with Sagan and Turner included which is not with this current DVD release. Keep in mind this new series of DVDs has had new visuals added in or taking the place of some old shots which may seem dated today. You can easily tell the newer additions by for example seeing shuttle launches pasted in montages when in 1980 there were no shuttle launches. But this helps to update the series for people today watching it. I have no clue if any info was taken out of the show since the first edition, since I did not compare the old VHS tapes I had with the new DVDs. But there are addendas added on to the shows end which have 10 year later additions to info mentioned in the show. But to basically sum up what others have said- this show is a masterpiece. Though the evolution theory can still be argued over the creation theory. I liked watching this show again.

Dr. Sagan's Cosmos is by far the best program ever produced for television.  Anyone who has ever asked themselves ""How did we get here?"" or ""Why are we here?"" needs to see this.  Dr. Sagan covers all the grounds of human knowledge from evolution to the present and it is all covered in an easy to understand manor.  When you are finished watching all of it you will have a much better understanding of who and where you are.
Cosmos holds up very well even though it is more then 20 years old.  The ideas and facts expressed need very few updates and when they are needed they are given through sub-titles and by updated footage with Dr. Sagan himself.  I can't recommend this enough.",1076889600,5,831,4.288461538461538

Rarer still is the science documentary that is cross-disciplinary, covering not just astronomy or just biology or just physics and chemistry but demonstrating how they all fit together. In the opening scene of the first episode, Sagan says, ""The cosmos is all that is, all that ever was and all that ever will be."" Indeed, and ""Cosmos"" covers it all, with grace and intelligence.
The series is not merely the best non-fiction television series of all time. For me it was literally a life-changing experience, and profoundly influential. While my tendency would already have been toward looking at the universe from a scientific, and non-mythological perspective, ""Cosmos"" cemented that direction. It was the first source I saw to bravely assert, ""Evolution is not a theory; it is a fact,"" and then demonstrate why that assertion is not just hubris.
That's just one example. The series was downright ground-breaking; and made even more moving and wondrous with its use of music (ranging from Vangelis to Vivaldi) and special effects.
Sometimes people ask what six or ten people from all of history you would like to have dinner with. For me, Carl Sagan is at the top of that list. And I can heartily recommend not only the DVD box set but also the companion book and even the soundtrack.",1075766400,19,1377,4.965367965367966

Of course I kept an eye on the listings, and told myself I would buy the video if I ever came across it, but like many other things in life, this fell to the wayside of everyday business. Then, I purchased a DVD player.
I wanted my first DVD purchase to be a special one so I checked the offerings from PBS and, as soon as I found this set, my search ended. The product description and customer reviews, combined with all I had heard over the years, were enough for me to place the order.
I suppose there isn't much more I can add to what the previous 120 plus reviewers have said about the content, but I do feel a need to add my words of praise for such a fantastic piece of work. The heart Dr. Sagan puts into the series, the quality of writing, the video features and, impressively, the updates to include new discoveries, make this a program that has not only stood the test of time, but has adapted to it as well.

One could not review this DVD-release of 'Cosmos' without contemplating it's content. It sounds boring after all those other reviews but my life also changed after viewing this series back in the 80's. If you have a narrow view of the world around you, and your are raised in the conviction that religion has the monopoly on morality, this series will be a shocking eye-opener. After 'Cosmos' my view on the world and the 'wisdom' of the people in it was radicaly changed! I can't tell you what will happen to you if you watch this because everyone has a different frame of reference. You have to experience it for yourself. I DO think there's something in here for everyone!
Picture and Sound.
The images of the 80's are well preserved through this digital release. The quality is naturally limited to that of the source material but the remastering process and enhancements (well integrated new imagery) give it a more contemporary 'feel'. In some parts the limits of the special effects from back then become clear through, for example, the visability of the 'edges' between Carl Sagan and his background but on the other hand can this be seen as a compliment on the video transfer. The sound is in one word wonderfull! The music has been polished and the front mix is well balanced with rear speakers: meaning that now and then some special effects give a fly-by on your rear-left or rear-right. Because this is not distracting from the content this is a good thing with a series like this. The center reproduces the dialog and voice-over in a clear way, although it's obvious that the limitations of the 80's are present here as well.
Extra's.
There is a track with music and sound effects only and some subtitles with science updates, of wich there are not many (clearly a tribute to the foreseeing eye of Carl Sagan). Although i love the series and i'm glad it's on DVD, i am somehow disappointed that even one singe 'making of' was not included. I can remember that a week before it was aired in The Netherlands i saw somekind of documentairy about making 'Cosmos'. Surely someone could have delved deep in some 'TV studio dungeon' to include this in the package.
Final thoughts.
I should rate this release of 'Cosmos' four stars because of the omission of a 'making of'. But the importance of this series convinces me to give the ultimate recommendation. The ultimate way to stop war, hunger and petty thoughts is to let everyone on our world see our fragile planet from space and realise it's ONE PLACE. In our age that is not possible. I think this series is the next best thing to that. More people on our world should see this. I am convinced it would make our planet a better place...",1067385600,14,2710,4.636174636174636
1175838,5,B000001BTW,"I agree with all of the positive reviews of the Cosmos DVD set, but ...
If you lose or damage one of the disks in the set, CarlSagan.com will NOT replace it, even though I was perfectly willing to pay for the replacement.  I wasn't looking for a freebie.
I wrote two e-mails to their ""support"" address, neither of which resulted in the courtesy of ANY reply, so I called the toll-free order number.  An indifferent CSR told me ""we don't replace single disks, you'll have to call Amazon.""  Well, it's not Amazon's problem!
The respect and admiriation that I had for Professor Sagan has been seriously tarnished by the ""blow off the customer"" attitude.  Somehow, I don't think Dr. Sagan would approve of this policy.  The only alternative I have is to spend another $130 for another complete set.",1067212800,14,794,4.642857142857143
1175839,5,B000001BTW,"Like so many reviewers, this series changed my life when I first saw it as an intellectually curious teenager back in 1980.  I went out and bought the book with paper route and tobbaco picking money.  I also bought a cassette tape of the soundtrack a few years later.  I still have it, although I recently bought the two CD soundtrack that was released along with these DVD's.
This is still one of the most ambitious and exciting projects American public television has ever undertaken.  And it still holds up.  I, for one, like the ""personal voyage"" aspect of what Carl Sagan was attempting to do with this.  His talent for communicating cutting edge science is on full display throughout, especially when he goes back to his old school in New York and teaches a group of kids (like me, back then) that they too are made of ""star stuff.""  Another reviewer commented on the unique cinematography of this series; I agree.  Sagan actually GOES to the places he talks about (the pyramids, the American west coast, Greece, etc.), including places that no longer exist and places far away, in his ""ship of the imagination.""  The amount of intellectual ground covered here is excellent; it goes far beyond astronomy to cover evolutionary biology, archaeology, geography, history, religion, and other topics.  The special effects and music are a bit dated by 21st century standards, but that, in my view, only adds to the charm.  Watching this thing all over again brought me back to a special time and place.  And Sagan's message rings as loudly as ever.
It asks the big questions, isn't afraid to speculate, is very informative, and in the end is remarkably inspiring.  Sagan's humanistic vision is just as necessary (perhaps even more so) now as it was back then, at the height of the cold war.  I think our descendants will be able to look at what was done here with pride.",1065657600,5,1870,4.713846153846154
1175840,5,B000001BTW,"A feast for the eyes, ears and mind, Cosmos is still the best TV series I've ever seen. Ostensibly a documentary about astronomy, Cosmos rapidly reveals itself as a meditation on science, life, and metaphysics.
Subtitled, ""A Personal Voyage"", Cosmos breaks with the documentary tradition of an objective narrator. Carl Sagan is passionate, imperfect, somewhat eccentric and somewhat arrogant; a prostelytizer for skepticism and reason as he faces a Cold War world seemingly bent on self-destruction.
Sagan's vision of history as a conflict between science and ""the gods"", is a conceit that thinly veils an ambivalance toward religion in general. At the same time, Sagan speaks of ""the Cosmos"" with a kind of mystical reverence. This attitude caused some people to hate Cosmos when it first came out and, as I watch the series once more, I can testify that the show still has the potential to alienate.
For me, Sagan's tactlessness was softened (paradoxically) by the astonishing degree to which his personality inhabits the show. This is evident in the way that Sagan actively inhabits the locations from which he lectures us. As many times as he is shown speaking, he is just as often shown moving about the landscape while his narration continues in voiceover. The epitome of this tendency is his casting of himself as a space traveler in a kind of science fiction ""travelouge"" that runs through most episodes in the series. At moments, Cosmos is even autobiographical, with Sagan drawing on distinct memories from his childhood. At such moments, we are almost his confidants. His inflammatory ideas given such a context are almost an ecstatic confession.
The cinematography capturing Sagan's presentation is, perhaps of necessity, quite different. The cameras dart about at odd angles, occasionally lingering on some detail of a scene as if they were Sagan's own eyes. The ""film art"" of Cosmos is something not often mentioned in reviews but it contributes significantly to the series' singular charm.",1060300800,11,2004,5.1692307692307695

I am from the UK, and I regularly searched for this series world-wide hoping it would be released on DVD - and here it is. This is undoubtedly the best series ever to be released for television, as the popularity of it, even after 22 years will testify, you will not be disappointed with this purchase, especially if you are from the UK, as this version has a lot of extra footage in it making each episode one hour long, leading me to the conclusion that the version aired and released on VHS in the UK was edited down. The music has been re-mixed, the whole lot is digitally re-mastered and it is a great pleasure to own such a landmark series on DVD - at last.",1056585600,9,820,4.229299363057325

I remember picking up some episodes at friends houses and thought what I was seeing was good enough to buy the book.  Well the book made me want to see the TV version. Twenty someodd years later here I am with the DVDs playing on my computer.  Wow!!!
The production is great with science updates too.  But I wouldn't rely on this production for the science.  I would rely on it for the inspiration to do science.  Sagan in his writing was very concerned about postmodernism, religion and other superstitious beliefs.  He doesn't hesitate to weave their destructiveness into the story of the Cosmos.  Seeing this done can be very inspiring for those of us who are subjected to their rantings while we are trying to find things out.  Wow!!!

When it was finally released on VHS tape I was not able to afford it.  It is now available in DVD format and the soundtrack has been remixed.  I cannot begin to tell you how much I am enjoying the show.
Carl Sagan was a natural teacher and watching his expressions and listening to the enthusiasm in his voice is wonderful.  Ann Druyan leads off, explaining that the information presented in the series is still accurate, requiring very few updates.

But I do want to add my voice to the many who love the series as I do. It was a very ambitious undertaking, taking nearly 3 years and around 9 million dollars to make - NOT a low budget project. As well as some enhancements the are included by virtue of the fact that its on DVD (subtitles and an extra music track), the series itself is sprinkled with a few visual updates that include some new images and animations. In 1990 and 1991 the series was rebroadcast with updates by given by Carl Sagan himself following many of the episodes and those are included in the DVD version as well.
This series could very well change your life, easily worth the price of ownership. You owe it to yourself to experience the wonder and awe that Cosmos is.",1046736000,18,895,4.3017751479289945
1175845,3,B000001BTW,"It's very interesting and informative. You can learn a lot about the cosmos.
I would though believe in UFOs and extraterrestrials, which Carl Sagan adamantly doesn't believe in. There also isn't evidence for evolution, or rather Darwinism, as Carl Sagan explains it. All supposed evidence can be disputed. But still, is a good series. (According to 'The Carl Sagan Conspiracy' by Donald L. Zygutis, he was silenced by NASA about his belief in ancient aliens.)
I liked this series when it showed on television. The series has updates at the end of a few episodes, like the ones about Venus and Mars, which were done in about 1990. There're also subtitle updates, which were added in about 2000 to some episodes. This box set does contain all the updates. This actually also shows what a good series it is, with it not being necessary to add many updates altogether.",1046563200,,864,4.805369127516778

I now have the collectors boxed set so that my children can share the wonderment and inspiration of this truly peerless series.  I pray that it will inspire them to take an interest in their surroundings and ask the questions as I did as a result of first seeing the series all those years ago.  I am confident that those prayers will not be in vain because Sagan is as engaging 20 years after he started his 'personal journey' sa he was for that young boy back in the early 80's.

I was deeply fascinated by the idea of a Cosmos existing on a far grander scale than I had known, by Carl Sagan's wealth of knowledge and humanistic appeal, and by the beautiful music of Vangelis. ""Cosmos"" instilled in me curiosity and love for science that have endured to this day.
Today I watch the series again and cannot help but thank the visionary Carl Sagan. ""Cosmos"" is a great work, full of eye-opening ideas, capped with a tremendous finale: ""We speak for Earth. Our obligation to survive and flourish is owed not just to ourselves, but also to that Cosmos, ancient and wast, from which we spring"".

Anyone who searches for a clear, logical understanding of the Cosmos should own this priceless set. Over the years, my late husband, Jim, watched this series more than any other video we owned. He always gained something of value with each new viewing. Haunting music connects one to a place which seems instinctively familiar through ""billions and billions"" of stars as Carl's soothing voice guides the path ahead.

It is fascinating to realize that, excellent as it was in the eighties, it still compares favorably to most contemporary documentaries. The contagious dynamism of Carl Sagan will be hard put to follow, which is deeply regrettable. Indeed, it seems that we are currently turning our sense of wonder towards our own technological feats (Of which DVD technology is indubitably part of, I know...), and inwards through global meta-communication.

Carl Sagan is a wonderful professor which carry us to the cosmos in a imaginary spaceship. I wish I had a physic science teacher like him when I was studying as I believe my work will be more relevant in science than management nowadays. If you have a large TV or a projector with a great 5.1 Surrond System, you definitely need to get it. The music is also done by Vangelis which is another artist that I respect a lot. The CG are maybe old but still great to watch. Carl was discussing more than 20 years ago about issues that might happen in the futur and which now are really happening. He is not a prophet but more a professor, scientific and even more sociologist with his approach.

1175858,5,B000001BTW,"I was a young teenager with a thirst for cosmology when Carl Sagans 'Cosmos' first aired in the early 80's. From the word go I would hang on to every punctual word Dr Sagan would utter. Don't get me wrong, some people find his verbal format malodic and sometimes over dramatic, but what people sometimes forget  that here is a man with a mission to describe and put to rest the origins and possible jouney to which we are bound.
 What you get in your 7 disc set is a virtual Encyclopaedia Britannica, full of information from the atom to the course of evolution. From the ancient Greeks to voyages of the imagination. You will learn about Hypatia, Copernicas, Tycho, Kepler, Galileo and many more throughout history, beautifully portrayed in narrated historical re-creations.
 Even though Dr Sagans views become apparent, he still gives religion in its many forms a good viewing. There are bound to be things in this collection that you didn't know about. Even now I still find bits of information that are new to me, thats how vast the subject matter is and how complete it is portrayed.
 Some people would say that some of the production is dated. O.K., it was produced some years ago now. But the subject matter is timeless. If you had one chance of producing something you would want to be remembered by I am sure you would try your hardest to achieve it. I believe the late Dr Sagan has.
 If you are after only one truely useful background in science and the history of everything that is and what will be, this set IS IT.",1028419200,7,1527,4.538181818181818

First: Even for todays standards it is a well made documentation that will make you think about yourself and the world you live in. The Cold War may be over, but people are still as stupid as ever. Cosmos is not just a simple documentation about stars and planets with numbers, technobabble and nice pictures - it's a manifest for peace and understanding that EVERYBODY should see.
Second: I remember when I used to watch the series when I was ten or eleven years old. I didn't miss a single episode. Cosmos may not have CHANGED my life - but it certainly gave it a new direction. It taught me to keep an open mind and to care more about my surroundings. When I saw Cosmos again after all these years I felt once more like the little boy I was two decades ago. I'm in awe of the whole world and the wonders of the Universe that surrounds every one of us.
If you have kids: show it to them! If you want to know more about life on earth or on other planets: see it! If you think, ordinary documentations about outer space are too complicated to understand: try this one! If you don't really care about the Universe, the stars and the planets, but you wonder what all the fuss is about: see it!
In any case: SEE IT!",1026259200,11,1287,4.2145748987854255

Every parent with a DVD player should buy this if their children have the slightest interest in the sciences.  Your kids will thank you when they're older.  Carl Sagan must've had a talent for teaching as any intelligent young student will get something out this series.  Cosmos ages well, serving as a springboard into other disciplines.
Watching the series again on DVD, I enjoyed the less-hard science episodes.  All thirteen are great.  I especially liked:
""The Harmony of Worlds""
""The Backbone of Night""
""The Lives of Stars""
""The Persistence of Memory""
""Enyclopedia Galactica""
""Who Speaks for Earth""
Each of these episodes is rich with history and gives me a new respect for the man as a speaker.  Especially the last episode, though somewhat dated as it was written during the Cold War.  The sound quality's excellent too.
Note: Science changes so fast, some of the updates may be 'out of date'.  The final update, in light of current events, where Dr. Sagan expresses optimism for the future, well it's a bit chilling.",1025568000,5,1210,4.863414634146341

(It is about the size of three DVD cases.)  The disks average 2 episodes per disk.  The digital sound and picture is perfect, and a great boon to this exceptional series.  As an extra feature, the ""updates"" option fills in any scientific gaps.
As to ""Cosmos"" itself, like many people I could offer my testimony to it's quality.  As a child (I think I was about 7 when I first saw it) ""Cosmos"" opened my mind to the possibilities of the Universe.  I am glad that the information is still relevant today, and that the only thing dated about the production is Carl Sagan's turtlenecks.

By now I can only say: Mankind will evolve into different shapes in the coming millions of years, if we are able to leave aside our autodestructive instinct, and will see with new eyes, day after day, the discovery of those unexplored corners.

1175866,5,B000001BTW,"The words of my title were used by Dr. Sagan at the end of ""The Edge of Forever,"" to describe an ""unproven"" theory that this universe is a closed electron similar to all the atomic elements within it, and that in turn these elements constitute a universe of their own. Mind-boggling? Maybe fantastic? Regardless it is a beautiful theory. In my formative years, I also had a similar idea when I drew an analogy of the planetary systems with the atomic particles everytime I saw a representation of a nucleus with its particles orbiting around. I say this without any pretense because my occupation is not in the field of sciences, but rather to note that the scientific community in the field of cosmology was entertaining the same idea which I thought was just a figment of my imagination. I also have to say that although I have seen some episodes of cosmos, I had not seen this one when I was a teenager. If I were forced to choose one episode as my favorite, it would be ""The Edge of Forever"".
Throughout the whole Cosmos series, Dr. Sagan's narration flows like music to the listener; although it was written in prose, his delivery produces the effect of a cosmic poetry, and offers a first glimpse with the transcendent. The following is an example of that glimpse, taken from the brilliantly entitled chapter ""The Edge of Forever"":

 ""Who knows for certain?
 Who shall here declare it?
 Whence was it born?
 Whence came creation?
 The gods are later than this
 World's formation.
 Who then can know
 The origins of the world?
 None knows whence creation arose...
 Or whether He has
 Or has not made it...
 He who surveys it
 from the lofty skies.
 Only He knows...
 ... or perhaps He knows not.""
This is a 3500 year old Rig-Veda, a collection of early sanskrit hymns, reflecting a tradition of skeptical questioning about creation and the universe, as paraphrasing Dr. Sagan.
 ... I would like to finally add that Cosmos somehow reminds me of the following words which keep stirring my mind:
 ""The human heart refuses
 to believe in a universe
 without a purpose""
It is credited to Emmanuel Kant if I am correct, although the concept may not be original to him. Kant had brilliant ideas but never a simple and clear writing style, and I can attest to that since I abandoned the task of reading his books several times. But on this one he could not have been more clear and concise to express such a big concept in so few words.
Just watch the entire Cosmos with your most dedicated attention and you will know what I am talking about.  For example, ponder on the sheer expanse of space and time with your closed eyes, and that experience alone will bring you closer to the cosmic energy, and put all your daily mundane affairs and problems into perspective.",1018742400,4,2763,4.59795918367347
1175867,5,B000001BTW,"I agree with all positive reviews (I could find no neg one...) and all the points they made, and I'd like to add my ""testimony"": I saw the series a little later than you (in Brazil it was aired in 82, I think), and it made a strong impression in me. As a 8 years old, I was profoundly touched by everything, but specially the second chapter, ""Uma voz na fuga csmica"" in Portuguese. And I made my parents buy the book, although by them I could understand nearly nothing of what was written there (during subsequent re-reads I got more and more...). From the TV series, I never forgot that animated sequence of evolving organisms. Nowadays I am a biologist (specialized in molecular systematistics and evolution), going to a post-doc in the US. I wish Dr. Sagan were alive so I could thank him for his great share of responsibility in the course of my professional life.
I recommend the DVD, the Book, and I am also pleased to see there is the soundtrack on CD, which I recommend as well (I still have an old tape with the soundtrack I copied from a cousin's LP)!",1017878400,11,1061,4.3908629441624365
1175868,5,B000001BTW,"It was a testament to the power of this series that I could remember so much of it, even though I hadn't seen a lot of it since I was 15 years old.
Ever since I saw this show as a high school student in 1980, Carl Sagan was one of my heroes.  Any love I have for science I can lay at his feet.
So when ""Cosmos"" came out on DVD, buying it was one of the easiest decision I ever made.
Looking at it now there are a few things that struck me, like the fact that Sagan couldn't go 15 minutes without speculating about whether we would blow ourselves up.  Also, there is a good reason that Carl's widow, Ann Druyan, was not the front-person for this marriage.  Public speaking is not her forte.
But that doesn't stop Cosmos from being essential viewing for anyone with a passing interest in science and required viewing for those who don't.",1017532800,7,835,4.173913043478261
1175869,5,B000001BTW,"I did a review on this series for the VHS set sometime ago. Recently I bought the DVD set and could not be pleased more.
The DVD set has incorporated newer images of stars and galaxies from more recent pictures taken by the Hubble telescope and earthbound observatories. Also the graphics in some sequences have been improved. The visuals are clean and sharp and I have had no problems playing these DVD in my player.
Producer, Ann Druyan, Carl Sagan's widow, opens the first episode and talks a little about when Cosmos was made and what's happened since. She also talks about what were Dr. Sagan's thoughts and how they transpired into what's currently known in science. I found more on the production company for these programs at: carlsagan.com
Also, most of the episodes end with a ""Cosmos Update"" that was filmed 10 years after Cosmos was made. In the updates, Carl Sagan discusses and sometimes demonstrates anything new that's been learned on the material just viewed. The DVD's come in a handsome case with a breif synopsis of each episode printed on it.
In the series, Carl Sagan masterfully guides one through the wonders of our Universe and lets us see just who we are in it. From stars to micro-organisms, to trees and whales, to Johannes Kepler and the little-known, woman scientist named Hypatia from ancient Alexandria, to warnings of the perils of human aggression and foolishness of the past and perhaps future, and mostly of our striving, never-ending need to explore and understand through science; Sagan takes us on this journey.
This is not just some science documentary, but rather, an experience that gives one a spirit, an appreciation, and a zest for science and understanding, and mostly, for being alive in this marvelous Universe. The photography is lovely. The music is full of wonderment. Sagan explains complex subjects to easy understanding (his greatest talent). They are great for everyone! The best purchase I ever made.",1017100800,38,1956,4.948328267477204
1175870,5,B000001BTW,"If we've learned more about the cosmos since 1980, Carl Sagan deserves a lot of the credit.  When the ""Cosmos"" series and book appeared, Sagan was criticized by other scientists for being a showman rather than a hard researcher--but with ""Cosmos"" he inspired a generation of kids to become scientists.  I'd say that's doing a lot for science!  Though he frets about our world being on the edge of nuclear self-destruction, he highlights some of the finest hours of human discovery and speaks optimistically of the future.  The real power of ""Cosmos"" is Sagan's highly personal, positive humanistic message.",1014854400,2,606,5.090909090909091

Dr. Sagan explained things so those of us who are not rocket scientists can understand it. From earth's earliest thinkers and scientists to distant quazars and white dwarfs to speed of light travel, this dvd set just doesn't seem to leave anything out. I saw this program when it first aired several years back and I am just as amazed with it now as I was then. I also was appreciative of the fact that each episode was updated by Sagan. All in all I highly recommend this series on the cosmos.",1010793600,3,621,4.271186440677966
1175873,5,B000001BTW,"Carl Sagan has created a testament to the wonders of the physical world, the power of science, and the intelligence, perseverance, courage and selflessness of humankind at its best. From the nature of the atom to the history and fate of our solar system, to the origin of life on Earth, to the first-ever photographs from Mars, to the decipherment of Egyptian hieroglyphics, to the possible nature of intelligent life elsewhere in the universe, Carl Sagan captivates us with his poetic words, his gentle and engaging imagery, and his talent for making the cosmic and remote seem simple and familiar.
When he explains how all the gold in our vaults, all the iron in our buildings, all the calcium in our bones, all the carbon in our muscle tissue and all the silicon in our computers that exists anywhere on Earth, was made in gigantic stellar explosions called supernovas that took place billions of years ago and millions of miles away, you want to disbelieve him, since it sounds so unlikely that our Earth could have been ""seeded"" by distant, dying stars... but you will understand how it is so.

There is no way to encapsulate 13 incredible and enlightening hours in a few paragraphs. Yes, the set is expensive -- but the investment is worth a thousand ""Charlie's Angels"" or ""A Knight's Tale"" DVDs. If you have ever wondered about science, or the universe, or yourself -- or even wonder why you should care -- you will benefit from seeing this series. If you have a child that is old enough to read, listen and learn, they will benefit from seeing this series. It is truly one of the most gripping and important programs ever made. It can change your life, as it changed mine when I first saw it, 20 years ago. Carl Sagan gives us a tour of the known universe, and how we are inextricably connected to it, not by religious or superstitious desires of power or control, but in the most fundamental biological and cosmological ways.

He had a way of bringing science down to the common man (one of the reasons I went into physics).  This was a wonderful series and I remember watching it with bated breathe every week it came out.  I really loved the history of science aspect that it had.
Anyways, the DVD set was a well made set.  They remastered the sound and they also put in updates where applicable.  I find it amazing that they didn't have to update that much though.  Its really a shame that Carl Sagan won't be able to release another series like this one.",1001808000,9,639,4.19672131147541

I'll admit, the special effects aren't always that special, but Sagan's light touch and varied locations and topics make the show as fascinating now as ever.  I recommend watching with the ""Science Update"" feature turned on.  When a topic is discussed that we know more about now, text explanations catch you up.

Carl Sagan is the best, I almost find myself even talking like him when explaining the mysteries of the universe!, to those who have never seen ""COSMOS"" believe me, do yourselves a favour and catch up with this 13 part journey that takes you from the past to the then present to a look at the future which is now unfolding before our eyes due to the wonderful discoveries being found by Optical and Radio Astronomers throughout the world.

It was such a delight when each episode came on and I would sit, mesmerized, while Carl Sagan took me as a student and a friend into the wonders of the universe.  Those excursions in space and time helped me to see many things and gave me hope and new starting points in thinking.  Now, two decades later, I feel the enormity of the debt to Sagan in giving my life such guidance.  I ordered COSMOS on video from amazon this spring and am happily reliving all of it, and I hope that many more individuals will discover COSMOS now as well.

1175881,5,B000001BTW,"Cosmos, Carl Sagan's ""Personal voyage"" through the world of 20th century science, is a tremendously interesting, well-written, and thought provoking enterprise. Although twenty years old, the series (both the commentary and the science) have held up remarkably well, likely due to the combination of solid data and informed speculation that are apparent throughout the 13 hours of programming.
Each disc features one or two episodes of the series, and each hourlong episode covers a surprising number of topics. Sagan goes back and forth from biology to chemistry to physics with ease, and never, ever, talks down to his audience.
The series was made during the cold-war/Reagan presidency, and does suffer from a bit of nuclear paranoia. Still, such sentiments resonated very strongly at the time. Of note, the series clearly embraces much of Sagan's own political thinking and some viewers may find this grating. Also, the series predates the whole current concept of ""political correctness"" and makes such statements as, ""Evolution is not a theory, it is a fact."" I imagine that the PBS of 2001 would be squeamish about airing such a strongly worded statement today, even in the context of a science program, for fear of a backlash from religious viewers. Still, it speaks to the strength of Sagan's feelings on the subject that he makes his case so forcefully, and is not afraid to show his disdain for things he views as irrational such as creationism and astrology.
The picture and sound quality on the discs are excellent. There are few extras here, but that does not really hurt the series much at all, given the large volume of material to view.
I cannot recommend the series more highly.",993081600,24,1696,5.0177304964539005

So far I have only watched the first of 13 episodes, but the image quality was outstanding, the sound was wonderful, even the packaging of this set is ingenious.
It isn't jam packed with extras, but don't be mistaken, Cosmos is a series so complete in itself I honestly don't know what could be added. That said, this DVD collection has the most comprehensive set of language tracks on it I have ever seen, it has a wonderful music/sound effects only track that is a delight to watch if you just want to sink into the still impresive visual experience alone, and (my personal favorite) it has a subtitle track that provided updates to the science, including discoveries or revised theories that have occured since this series was made. If you watch with these titles on, you may be surprised at how few times an update is required.
Plus, if you look around on the website address menu screen on the first disc, you might find something special.

1175891,5,B000001BTW,"Although the ""Cosmos"" series is nearly 20 years old, it remains as relevant today as it did in the early 1980s.  The series was devised and written by the astronomer Carl Sagan of Cornell university.  Based on the book he wrote by the same name, the late Carl Sagan put together the most ambitious and far-reaching inquiries into the human scientific endeavor to date.
Within ""Cosmos"" is an assortment of discussions of the history of scientific ideas, as well as the personages who conceived and promoted those ideas.  The collection includes such diverse fields as astronomy, theoretical physics, zoology / taxonomy, molecular biology, cosmology and chemistry.
 Sagan takes his viewers on a tour of some of the most pivotal  epochs in science history.  Incorporated into the historical overview are such personages as Eratosthenes of Alexandria, Hypatia of Alexandria, Anaxagorous, Aristarchus of Samos, Archimedes, Democritus of Abderra, Aristotle, Johannes Kepler, Leonardo Davinci, Charles Darwin and Albert Einstein (among others).  Sagan does a wonderful job of recounting the intellectual milieu in which these pioneers lived, and also explains what inspired their revolutionary ideas.
There have been many scientific documentaries put out on video since the debut of ""Cosmos.""  Virtually all of them, however, were influenced by Sagan.  His vision was to make science more accessible to the general public, as opposed to being confined to the stuffy laboratories and lecture halls of academia.  After all, the fruits and treasures of scientific discovery belong to all of us, not just a select educated few. It was not so long ago, however,  that it was widely thought that laymen were not intelligent enough to follow the general principles of scientific polemics.  Sagan disagreed with this premise and has taken tremendous efforts to dispel it.  ""Cosmos"" is an example of those efforts.
This is a truly outstanding piece of work and is recommended for everyone who has so much as a peripheral interest in science.  Yes, it is a bit on the expensive side, but it is also nearly 12 hours worth of intellectual fervor.  This version on DVD also contains updated material in which Sagan introduces scientific revelations which have been made since the PBS series came out.  It also contains commentary by his widow, Ann Druyan.  So, buy this box set and enjoy all the cosmos has to offer.",986688000,124,2396,5.16580310880829

That was a mistake.  After so many years, I had forgotten why I loved the field so much, and in college, everything was boiled down to hard equations and dry lectures.  I evenutally got discouraged and transferred to computer science.  (Which I enjoyed and which has led to a good career...)
But recently--I'm 30 now--I saw this released and, remembering how much I loved it, bought it.  I've watched it, and now that I can understand a lot more of it, I'm once again captivated.
Carl Sagan makes you realize what an insignificant speck we are in the universe, but at the same time conveys such a sense of wonder and appreciation of our little speck.  He elevates us by showing us a glimpse of the grandeur that we are all a part of.
Since re-watching the series, I have been scouring the Web for more information and my mind has been spinning with new possibilities of who we are and what the Cosmos is all about.  This is much more than just a show about ""space stuff""; it is filled with history, philosophy, excitement, good old fashioned story-telling, and I have yet to watch a segment that I didn't come away from really thinking and dreaming about.

He quite simply broke science out of the cloister of self righteous 'learned' people to involve all. As much a genius he himself was, this did not stop him from imparting to us the fundamental truths of the cosmos, and science in general. I was 14 when the 'Cosmos' series was first shown in Ireland, and I was quite simply mesmerised. This very welcome DVD release has the episodes in full, most lasting 1 hour with the updates.

1175896,5,B000001BTW,"Carl Seagan's decision in making this series was taken after the disappointment caused on general public as the first pictures from Viking Lander showed nothing else than rocks on Mars. However, he believed that interest in science could be excited through the most powerful communication medium, television.  And he got it. Cosmos was watched for over 500 million people in 60 different countries. In U.S.A. it became the most widely watched series in the history of American public television winning the Emmy and Peabody Award. In Brazil the success was so great that it was cast three times through the main TV network.
Cosmos deals with a wide range of matters such as ancient civilisations, biological evolution, history of philosophy, brain's working, origin and fate of universe and much more.... This magisterial masterpiece is not only a travel from the microscopic DNA chain to the vastness of sideral space but also a self questioning about human beings. If you ever wondered about who are we, where are we from or where are we going to,  you will find some answers in this fascinating series. Cosmos is an exciting voyage through the world of knowledge.
One could suppose that after almost twenty years the visual effects as well as the series itself would be out-of-date. That is not true. The power of Cosmos lays mainly on Carl Seagan's ingeniousness to instigate our imagination and foment the perception of our universe. All of that is underlined by beautiful excerpts of erudite music and exquisite Vangelis' music which fit so perfectly into the series that it seems to have been composed specifically to it. It will surely remain as the most magnificent program ever produced for TV for many years to come. It deserves a sixth star.",981676800,5,1753,4.959183673469388

It was ""buried"" away late at night, 10:30pm, mid-week.  I videotaped every episode on my old Betamax. I re-watched the complete series again only last year. The tapes were watchable, but tracking was a major hassle.  I was delighted to discover the series had been released on DVD and purchased it at once. I was totally surprised and delighted by what I received. The DVDs all looked wonderful, and hearing the series for the first time in stereo added a new depth to it.  I was more delighted to discover each episode now ran for about 55-58 minutes. (All episodes are 58 minutes. Some have a 4-5 minute Update, with 55 minutes of original footage, and some 58 minutes of original footage). When first shown in Australia, and my old video tapes prove this, the average runtime was just 50 minutes. I have rewatched the entire series again, on DVD, and was delighted with the ""new footage"", (filmed with the original series but missing from my tape copies), and ""Cosmos Updates"", filmed ""10 Years later"" at the end of many episodes.  Much of the series has be ""tweaked"". New photos and video footage added and sequences updated. It is the original series, but with a little more gloss. COSMOS is a brillant series. I really can't say more about it than has already been said by all the other reviewers, except perhaps; ""Why are great science series like this so few and far between?"".  Now if someone will kindly put ""The Ascent Of Man"" on DVD.",981590400,13,1571,4.736263736263736
1175898,5,B000001BTW,"It is amazing that this series, first aired on PBS in 1980, requires few revisions or updates.  This set incorporates ""Cosmos Updates"" with Dr. Sagan, dated 10 years later.  They add to the continuing timeliness of the series.  I have watched the tapes three times through since I purchased the set in December, and you just don't tire of it.
One does wonder, however, if his newfound optimism was a bit premature, given recent world events, such as Kosovo, escalating tensions in the Middle East, and the resurrection of ""Star Wars"" in the U.S.  Let's hope not.  It would be a shame if we still managed to terminate ourselves and everything else out of sheer stupidity.  Dr. Sagan's eloquent plea for common sense and reason to triumph over agression and our tendency for violence is still one of the highlights for this series.
This is one of the best introductions to almost any scientific discipline for any young person you know who is interested in any science career.  Dr. Sagan was an excellent teacher who could reduce complicated principles to understandable levels for laypeople.  The price is well worth it - you get the original 13 hours, in their entirety, plus the updates, totaling another 45 minutes or so.  Some of the montage images have been updated slightly (there are scenes which were not available in 1980, or even 1990, such as Mars Pathfinder footage), but this just adds to the experience.
One of my favorite segments is the one on Hypatia, the last head of the Library at Alexandria.  Just try entering her name into any search engine - you will be astounded at what you find, and several of the sites are wonderful for young women who aspire to the sciences.  Even after his untimely death, Dr. Sagan is still able to teach and make us consider our actions, both as individuals and as nations, and how they may affect the world around us.
I would highly recommend this video for anyone interested in science, in history, in graphics (the original series utilized no computer graphics - everything was gorgeous astronomical paintings by some of the best in the business, including Adolf Schaller), and in learning in general.  The music is superb and compliments the images, with Vangelis' ""Alpha"" during the evolution drawings sequence being one of the best pairings I have seen.  Every segment will give you several things to think about, whether or not science is your ""thing.""",981417600,20,2408,4.815533980582524

Cosmos is well worth triple the price, which by the way is the cost of tuition alone for only a single university course in science.

I think the box set is a decent value, all 13 1hr episodes on 7 DVDs.  I highly recommend it although I do have two very minor gripes, first the DVD set says ""Digitally Remastered"" but I somehow doubt that as several times in the first episode alone the sound switches channels, fades, reverses stereo, etc none of which are altogether horrible but a little dissapointing.  The only other complaint is the resolution is not great but that is really just the quality of the original film preserved in all of its digital glory ;) so again, not a huge deal.

1175904,5,B000001BTW,"I remember watching the ""Cosmos"" series with wide-eyed wonder when it was first aired on PBS some 20 years ago. I was just a kid and I didn't understand some of what Dr. Sagan was presenting, but I was captivated nonetheless. The series made me a lifelong follower of his work. I'm still pained by his death; no one said life was fair, but the universe seems awfully out of whack when such a great man dies young and yet 80-year-old rapists and child molesters share the air I breathe.
The video transfer is nothing spectacular -- fans of modern high-definition DVD transfers such as ""Gladiator"" will be disappointed -- but I expect the video portion looks about as good as could be expected for a decades-old low-budget public television series. It's acceptable. The 5.1-channel Dolby Digital audio remix, however, is something to behold. The ""Cosmos"" theme never sounded so good. I still get choked up when I hear it.
The packaging is attractive and well thought-out: a nice matte-black slip case holds a fold-out inner section that carries the DVDs. A nifty little bonus is the subtitled up-to-date science updates that pop on whenever new theories or laws contradict Sagan's original ideas, such as the extinction of the dinosaurs or the Tunguska Event.
The set isn't cheap, but considering you're getting this landmark series fully restored on a medium that will not deteriorate one bit in your lifetime, the asking price is more than reasonable. Buy it for yourself, your children, and your children's children. You can argue with Sagan's religious or political views, but his love of science and eloquent presentation of its history and current and future theories is indisputably timeless and brilliant.

It is the mathematics and wonder of the universe explained in the most articulate and artful way possible.
Technically speaking, the transfer on this series isn't too bad.  I've seen better on older films (such as Apocolypse Now), but I'm pretty sure the master of a feature film was a better technology during that time, but I've seen much worse on fairly recently made for TV productions, such as the Les Mis concert.

I loved the Cosmos series when it was first shown on PBS and had always lamented the fact that they never re-ran it as often as they re-ran other shows.
This series was groundbreaking in its attempt to bring science to everyday people in a manner which ordinary people could understand. It got people interested in science.
The DVD collection includes updates made about ten years after the series. These are short and in some cases not terribly interesting. Yet, it is nice to have them. The music selected for the show sounds a lot better coming through my stereo system than it ever did coming out of the TV speakers.

The 1990s boxed set contained Carl Sagan's updates but I was surprised to see how short some of the episodes were.  I now know why, the versions of Cosmos shown in the UK were cut, the running time of a majority of the episodes is 60 minutes (with even the shorter ones coming out at 58 minutes or so).  I would therefore say that anyone who wants to see this fine series to go ahead and buy the DVD set.  It is relatively expensive with only two episodes per disc (disc one only has one episode) but if you compare that with what Paramount are charging for two episodes of Star Trek, this is no contest.  The picture quality is not great but the series was filmed in the 1970s, the remastered dolby digital soundtrack is, however, outstanding.",977875200,3,863,4.269938650306749
1175909,5,B000001BTW,"I just received this DVD box set for christmas (along with Life Beyond Earth, another great documentary), and all I can say (never actually having heard of this series) is that I love it so far.  I have only reached episode number three as of today (12/27/2000), but I have only had it for 2 days now.  I plan to watch all thirteen episodes by the end of the week!
 I thought that the information within would be outdated, but I was wrong, terribly wrong!  Everything Carl Sagan says is pretty much still believed to be true today, and any updates are added at the end of each episode by Dr. Sagan himself (ie: episode two states that it is not known how the dinosaurs became extinct - Dr. Sagan updates this at the end of the video stating that currently it is believed that a giant meteorite was the cause of their extintion).
 I even thought the special effects would probably be terrible compared to what I have seen in present day, but to my surprise, they are exceptional (including Dr. Sagan walking through buildings which no longer exist).
 The box set itself is great, as it opens after the third DVD to expose all 7 discs (very appealing to observe as they all have great designs).  Each DVD contains the episode titles, so I guess the publishers thought you would not need an informational booklet of some sort... I think this is the only bad thing about the box set -- no booklet!  The dvd's themselves are informative enough, however, and on the front side of the inner sleeve it does have descriptions for each episode.

 I would recomment this box set to anyone, of any age!  After all these years, it still has the power to draw you in and want to learn more, hear more of what Dr. Sagan has to say.

I did not know what I wanted to do with  my life, until watching the TV series COSMOS inspired me to  become a teacher of science and mathematics. In the COSMOS  series, Carl Sagan proves that science can be understandable, relevant and, most of all, interesting! Before COSMOS aired on PBS, I had no interest in science. This series ignited  my desire to understand the Universe and humanity's place in it. His explanations of astronomy, evolution, and other branches of science are the clearest I have ever heard. Even Albert  Einstein's theories are simply and clearly explained in a way that anyone can understand. The graphics and photography are  stunning, and the music hauntingly beautiful.
Carl Sagan does a very important service to the world by letting us know that there is great promise for the future of humanity, if only we can learn to use our science and technology wisely. He also alerts us to the grave perils of our knowledge, if we continue to use it in an irresponsible manner. The human race is standing on the brink - we are living in the most crucial time in all of human history.

This series sparked a curiosity that continues to drive me even today.  Therefore, I cannot encourage parents strongly enough to sit and watch this series with their children.  It is creative and colorful and not burdened with scientific jargon.  There is time for such things later in life.
When Carl Sagan died in 1996, I felt as if a part of my intellect left as well.

Now I have two sons, the elder one being old enough for me to harbor some parental wisfulness about his interests. I am aware that there are still good science programs on PBS, but I sense that video games and stock trading make formidable bids for space in young peoples' minds these days. To make matters difficult, the intellectual norm of our times seems such that when I was looking for a biography of Leonardo Da Vinci for my son, the local bookstore was carrying none but three versions for L. Di Caprio, which is not to say I have no respect for video games or watching Mr. Di Caprio's major work on occasions.

Parents, please watch this series with your kids. It offers exciting, visually stunning and elegantly simple explanations and illustrations of complex scientific ideas and phenomenon. It puts the intricately woven interactions of the universe in a context everyone can grasp and enjoy. For the bright and curious child it can be a truly profound experience. It was for me.
