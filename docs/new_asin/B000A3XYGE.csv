8074274,5,B000A3XYGE,"they will never make a show like this again, everything isn't a commercial nor scripted drama to get ratngs above all else",1387324800,,122,4.590909090909091
8074275,2,B000A3XYGE,"There are some good images of the cars etc. but overall the narrator uses a monotone presentation and gives all the episodes a very boring overall feel. I would appreciate much more coverage of the ""Rides"" and way less or no coverage of the ""Bling masters`that dominate most episodes.",1243382400,,284,4.816326530612245

8074278,5,B000A3XYGE,"I had seen an episode of the rides show on Discovery channel once and as luck  has it, it was the episode with Joe Rogan's Sick Fish. I could only catch the end of the program but it was enough to give me goose bumps all over. I immediately ordered the second season to find out that almost all of the episodes are great. For me, the episodes about Eleanor and Sick Fish more than justifies my purchase. I can not recall how many times I watched those two episodes over and over again. Every once in a while I still do.",1167868800,,519,4.088235294117647
