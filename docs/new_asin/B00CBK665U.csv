8579904,5,B00CBK665U,"EXCELLENT series.  Our founding history is being lost daily.  This was a refreshing review of the beliefs and fundamental concepts which brought these devout followers of Jesus Christ to this country in order to freely worship the God of the Bible and raise their children in freedom of worship.  It's also a genuine warning that casting off the principles of the Bible result in certain destruction.  Unless we return to the fundamentals of acknowledging Almighty God, we cannot expect God to bless America.",1481241600,,508,5.0843373493975905
8579905,5,B00CBK665U,I just loved this seminar by Dave Miller based on the book Christ and the Continental Congress.  The founders of our great country acknowledged Jesus and based their beliefs and laws upon God and his laws.  Must see!,1480982400,2,216,4.657894736842105
8579906,5,B00CBK665U,"This is without a doubt the best series I have ever seen on the importance of God in the founding of our great country.  I wish that every citizen of the US, and in particular the members of Congress, the House, the President, and the Supreme Court, could be forced to sit down and watch this video series.  You will walk away with a different view of how this country should be run.  I have bought 20 copies and hand them out to friends and family.  Please get it and sit down with your children and watch each of the 8 short segments.  Or, purchase it and watch it in your Bible study class.",1423094400,2,593,4.166666666666667
