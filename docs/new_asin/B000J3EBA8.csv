These were always awesome live shows
Would do anything to relive these moments",1386720000,,110,4.55
8149011,2,B000J3EBA8,"I WAS DISAPPOINTED WITH THE DVD, WHILE MOST OF THE GIRLS ARE ATTRACTIVE AND ATHLETIC, VERY FEW KNOW EVEN THE MOST BASIC WRESTLING, AND THEIR IN RING BEHAVIOR MADE THE WWE LOOK LIKE SHAKESPEARE

8149012,4,B000J3EBA8,"I bought this DVD because I like women's wrestling and the sexy aspects of WEW add to my interest.  This one features the usual gorgeous exotic dancer types, some with tattoos and tongue rings.  The wrestling itself was actually fairly good.  All the girls were in excellent physical condition and executed the basic moves, and each of them had incorporated at least one aerial maneuver into their bag of tricks.  I would compare the wrestling action favorably with what you see in the women's matches in the WWE.  There is a little open-mouth kissing between the matches, but not a whole lot.  The bikini-clad female referees make a show of searching the wrestlers before the match starts, but since the girls are scantily clad, there is not much to frisk, unfortunately. The girls all gave their best efforts to put on a good show and the DVD was well worth what I paid for it.  I can recommend it to anyone who likes women's wrestling with a little lesbian action thrown in for good measure.",1203552000,13,994,4.645714285714286
8149013,4,B000J3EBA8,"I was at this event and had a great time.  It's not the best wrestling in the world, but it might be the sleaziest.  Don't buy this if you are expecting Flair vs. Steamboat or the Funks vs. the Briscos.  It is what it is.",1177372800,5,221,3.8666666666666667
