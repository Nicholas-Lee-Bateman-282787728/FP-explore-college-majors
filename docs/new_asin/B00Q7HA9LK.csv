6859490,5,B00Q7HA9LK,"I enjoy it so much when I can read the music of the face of the performer - and share her emotions.  I wish I could hear longer pieces, but this documentary gives not only the snippets of the musical pieces, but more than hints about the whole person: private and public face, and the growing pains (and pleasures) included in the maturing process. I laughed....I cried - I know, but it's true. Thank you for sharing, Marika!",1450656000,,425,4.448717948717949

6859495,5,B00Q7HA9LK,Great movie about a very talented girl. The film follows her for several years and we get a peek into her life. Very enjoyable.,1469232000,,127,4.333333333333333
6859496,5,B00Q7HA9LK,"I LOVED this film.  I have already watched it three times.  Marika Bournaki is the greatest pianist I've ever seen or heard!!!!!! Shamefully, I had never seen her before.  Thank you, Amazon for such a treat!",1469232000,,207,4.694444444444445

6859498,4,B00Q7HA9LK,I liked it.,1467676800,,11,3.0
6859499,4,B00Q7HA9LK,"This documentary is very well done, and tells a very interesting story. It is somewhat slow-paced, and even though ti captures some of the tension associated with the various competitions and qualification performances, there is not huge make-or-break moment to create a real climax and denouement.",1465257600,,298,5.5
6859500,4,B00Q7HA9LK,facinating documentary.  I will be interested in how she does n the future!,1464652800,,75,4.769230769230769
6859501,3,B00Q7HA9LK,Slightly above average doc absent the appearance or feel of being scripted.,1464134400,,75,5.333333333333333

6859503,4,B00Q7HA9LK,An inspiring story.  A real human being who appears to have a good head on her shoulders. Looking forward to seeing her here in our hometown in a few weeks.  She will be working with at risk kids at a special school and giving a concert performance as well.,1462233600,,257,4.224489795918367
6859504,4,B00Q7HA9LK,I enjoyed watching this young piano player develop her talent and grow up as well. The movie shows the positive and negative aspects of being a child prodigy and the effect it has on the family as well. We'll worth watching.,1461715200,,224,4.487804878048781
6859505,5,B00Q7HA9LK,Loved it and recommended it to my current and former piano teacher.,1456617600,,67,4.666666666666667
6859506,5,B00Q7HA9LK,Excellent documentary!,1454198400,,22,10.5
6859507,5,B00Q7HA9LK,"This documentary captures a phenomenal young talent and for 8 years video tapes her daily and weekly life. Interesting to watch the development of her musical ability, emotional challenges, growing from a young child, to a teen, to a beautiful 20 year old women. Very interesting to observe the drive necessary to be great at music or anything else people endeavor in life.",1454198400,,373,4.936507936507937
6859508,4,B00Q7HA9LK,"Very gifted musician! However seemed somewhat unappreciative of her father's caring as she got older. He devoted his life to her, sacrificing his marriage in the end. I hope she is still performing because she also has given her life to beautiful music.",1454198400,,253,4.906976744186046
6859509,4,B00Q7HA9LK,"Really enjoyed this look into the life of a young artist. My brother is a symphony musician and got a young start as well. This really shows the musical life as it is. Hard, lots of work but really... It's all for the music. Good for the amateur who has dreams and aspirations and sees only the glamorous side of an enviable career.",1453939200,,332,4.285714285714286
6859510,4,B00Q7HA9LK,"They did a good job with this documentary.  It takes place over a number of years, and I watched a young girl mature into a young lady.  Watching this film....wow, it's wrenching.  It's remarkable this young woman spent hours and years practicing, memorizing music, and competing, but she relates to other people very well.  She's made extremely difficult personal decisions.  She lived alone in NYC at the age of 15.  Her career choice is phenomenal, and shows her love of music, and a very deep compassion for children.  I liked it so much that I will watch it multiple times.",1453593600,,578,4.72
6859511,4,B00Q7HA9LK,Very good.,1452729600,,10,4.5

6859513,5,B00Q7HA9LK,"This was such an inspiring film about a beautiful, and gifted pianist. Don't miss this one. It's a great film to watch with the whole family.",1451779200,,141,4.461538461538462
8690726,4,B00Q7HA9LK,"It was good.  It takes you through her young life with all her imperfections and family dynamics.  She struggles to find herself in music as others try to live their dreams through her.  Yes she is disrespectful and foul mouthed especially with her father and at times a spoiled brat but at the end of the documentary you finally see that she is beginning to find out what wants out of a musical life.

Authentic and worth the watch",1522627200,,432,4.430379746835443
8690727,2,B00Q7HA9LK,"Worth it alone to just see the very brief scene of her at the Gould archive in Ottawa where she plays the English Suite number 4 in a minor. Otherwise, this reminds me of the Beatles' Magical Mystery Tour, the premise of which was to put them on a bus and send them out and see what happened...unfortunately nothing did.",1515024000,,320,4.35
8690728,2,B00Q7HA9LK,"Thinking about making a documentary about the rise of a musical prodigy? Please don't. It might wind up like this and scar the kid for life. Marika is a wonderful player but the film should have focused on her career and not her creepy parents, too-long segments on things like a surprise party or her complete meltdown in a London hotel room. No explanation is given for a number of things -- like why she was playing in South Korea or Russia or why she suddenly plays for a group of toddlers. And why wasn't there anything from when she was 19? And why did the parents and family agree to do such a film which took 8 years? There's very little storytelling here -- just a lot of images and piano plonking. Maddening.",1498608000,,718,4.365671641791045
8690729,5,B00Q7HA9LK,"What a prodigy.
I enjoyed learning about Marika, like to see how she is doing today vs. the 10 year span in the documentary.
It was a pretty intimate biopic as you see her go from young girl to concert level woman, all before she's 21.
Only thing missing was the dynamic with the mother. Her father is the manager of her career.
Great point of view documentary. I play piano myself, not at her level, but i found it interesting to see what she went through to become who she is.",1495324800,,478,4.206521739130435
8690730,4,B00Q7HA9LK,"It was a fascinating portrait of what it is like to grow up as a child piano prodigy. I stayed up until 1""00 am on a work night to finish it as I could not stop watching it.",1485302400,,173,3.5789473684210527
8690731,5,B00Q7HA9LK,Great piano documentary. Very talented young lady and quite a diva at times!,1484524800,,76,4.923076923076923
8690732,5,B00Q7HA9LK,Excellent insight and a suprisingly honest film.,1482192000,,48,6.0
8690733,3,B00Q7HA9LK,She's another megatalented diva but glad to see her working with kids at the end. She definitely made her parents rich but at what cost?,1481760000,,136,4.48
8690734,1,B00Q7HA9LK,Ugh!,1481328000,,4,4.0
8690735,4,B00Q7HA9LK,Compelling doc. Not a sour note to be heard.,1478563200,,44,4.0
