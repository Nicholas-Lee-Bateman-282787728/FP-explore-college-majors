2873433,5,B000RPCJBG,"So..like many of us ..I already owned much of this material and spent the money to get everything in one nice  box and the extra 1hr interview...
was it worth it?  well, I have mixed feelings..
I have to rate this 5 stars because it is George and it is classic stuff.

It does  NOT have George's Best Stuff ,  the dvd  on the complete George Carlin  box  set...which while it is a best of ...also has an all time  classic bit on ""STUFF"" from the Comic Relief special ....which is  NOT  in this set..called ""All My Stuff""...so its a minor point but a frustration.

George is the greatest standup of all time  and not only funny, but he makes you THINK....and that is his special gift and I've been a fan since  my high school days ,which coincided with his early little David releases that preceed this set.

enjoy...and was it worth it to spend all that money for  the extra 1 hour interview...for  me  ..Yes.",1206057600,204,909,4.341317365269461

2873437,5,B000RPCJBG,"This is an amazing collection, and I'm not the kind of person who uses the word ""amazing"" very often.  George Carlin's thoughts and work are truly liberating and hilarious.  The amazing thing about Carlin is that this 14 disk set doesn't even totally cover his career.  His albums are also incredible and include material you won't find here, though a lot of it is re-hashed in these specials.  When I was a teenager, my brother and I sometimes worked as janitors cleaning buildings for extra money and we used to listen to Carlin's tapes while we were working.  It made the job fun and that's the biggest compliment I can give to George Carlin; he made working as a janitor kind of a good time (at least until the tapes ran out).",1194307200,73,730,4.5

2873512,4,B000RPCJBG,"That's what a lot of people think--""George Carlin's Seven Deadly Words"". It's like Steppenwolf fans who think they cut one record; ""Born To Be Wild"". In truth, Carlin covered a lot of ground during his 40 year career. He started out as Jack Burns' earlier duo partner before Avery Schreiber joined him. He once speculated that even though all you hear about in history about Indian warriors is the chiefs, there had to have been sergeants; ""Awright, knock off the horseplay. I said knock off the horseplay. Hey, youse guys over there playing wit' da horse, I told yez to knock it off"". Later on, the Indian sergeant issues loincloths; ""We got a new item to be added to your uniform allowance. It's your lern clawt. It'll be entered on your uniform allowance as 'clawt, one, lern-type' That's your lern clawt. Youse should learn to know and love your lern clawt, it could save your life someday"".

His bitter anger at life in general is displayed in his newer comedy especially anything on HBO. He is now a here of the disenfranchised everywhere. On the other hand his early comedy that is mostly on vinyl, was great in its intellectual examination of human behaviors and our screwed up social and societal rules or norms. His genius was ability to point out the weird thing of humans, as in ""Lets get on the plane vs. No lets get in the plane!"" This funnier more life loving George Carlin appears to be gone. This DVD collection does not have Carlin's early stuff, only his hateful HBO stuff.

2873585,4,B000RPCJBG,"Although this is not really all of George Carlin's ""Stuff"", this is a great collection of his HBO specials which include most of his greatest comedy bits. I'm sure to get all of George Carlin's comedy routines which would include shows, guest appearances, specials...I could go on and on...they would have to create a 1000 (or more) disc set. Anyway, if you're looking for a repertoire of witty, real-life comedy, this set will leave you ROTFLYAO.

I consider George Carlin the best comedian of all time. Okay, a poll rated Richard Pryor first and George Carlin second but, I would, at least, call it a tie.

Even though I think George Carlin is a 5+ star comedian, I'm giving this set 4 stars because the packaging is a bit lacking; My set came with a few cracked DVD holder fold-out (book style ) pages and the video and sound quality is not the best.

2873587,5,B000RPCJBG,"After 40 years I miss teaching literature.  I'm tired of blank expressions when I quote memorized lines by Wordsworth, Keats or Shakespeare (or even mention the names of these architects of Western consciousness and its inseparable relationship with the communicative / expressive / self-conscious system called ""language"").  Homer (800 B.C.), Socrates (500 B.C.) and, above all, Geoffrey Chaucer (1400 A.D.) are my internal and very immediate companions, endlessly questioning me, talking back to me, and illuminating my decisions and indecisions on a daily basis.  Give me no more than the first sentence of Chaucer's Prologue to the ""Canterbury Tales,"" and I will show you a single sentences that represents not merely its primary subject (a ""Club Med""-type journey by a cross-section of English society--some standing out more than others due to their greed, exploitation of the defenseless, and irrespressible carnality but all united not only by their goal of reaching the Canterbury Cathedral and paying their respects to the martyr Thomas Beckett but by this infinitely expressive, democratic new language and the storytelling that it permits among the community.  And above all it's Chaucer the Pilgrim who excells with his description of the birth of spring even as he fathers forth the birth of the English language and, in effect, gives birth to English literature itself (few works in any language can stand up to the cosmic yet personable vitality of ""The Canterbury Tales"").

Despairing of conversing with like-minded human beings for whom Chaucer, Shakespeare, Wordsworth, Browning, Pound, T.S. Eliot and William Faulkner are not  remote and obscure ""historical monuments"" but vital voices in the present moment, I've turned to the most expressive voices in jazz (Ellington, Bill Evans, dozens of great tenor players like Hank Mobley and, of course, Coltrane).  And as the audience for their music has begun to shrink, I've returned to film--but not to Griffith, Chaplin, Bresson, Renoir, Welles, Capra, Ford, Hitchcock, Bergman, Kurosawa and Fellini (they've been eclipsed by the producers responsible for the digital programming of the ""Matrix,"" which like Spenser's monster Fraud has given birth to a thousand more fantastical demons representing an escape from the problematics of space and time and, above all, mortality (the 'human condition,"" as literary wonks once called it).  Instead, I've gone from film and movies to ""video"" and to filmmakers who don't ""make"" their realities as much as ""record"" them--in the moment and in ""real time.""

Lately, I've begun to study the words of post-""Bruce-ian"" comics, consuming their concert tapes and frequently making notes of similarities and differences between Richard Pryor and Eddie Murphy, or Pryor amd Robin Williams--all singularly brilliant performers who can perform magic with words.  But the aforementioned have the advantage of a ""pre-composed"" persona--due to their movies (both R-rated and family) and publicity machines.  The minute they walk on stage the audience is prepared to laugh at their first word, and when the first word is an ""F"" word or ""N"" word, they respond with appreciative howls, shrieks, and squeals of laughter.  Carlin possesses no such advantage, and therefore has to build and sustain a comic stage persona from the ground-up--not only using words but repeatedly calling our attention to those words and all of the wondrous things they can perform--from turning our worlds upsidedown to sealing us in a mindless void where words have lost their meaning.  They no longer symbolize or signify representations of the way we as humans are capable of thinking and feeling.  Rather, they're ""noises"" that we repeat endlessly, a mantra of cliches, aphorisms, and platitudes that make us feel better in our presumption of superiority to everyone else.

George Carlin belongs at the very top of the list of stand-up comics who have, after the last ""good war"" and the decade of ""I Love Lucy,"" shone the beacon of truth on our blindnesses, hypocrisies, chauvinistic pride, regressive ignorance.  His focus, it's safe to say, is never on himself but on the world as he perceives it through his penetration of the representations by ""higher people,"" authorities, hawks, the media, ""group-think,"" and all group-identity politics.  His first ""great truth"" is: ""Never believe a thing the government tells you.""  I's a sentence that gets him applause from every flaming liberal as well as the most entrenched redneck right-winger. But his elaboration on that statement will first confuse, and next alienate, any tea-partier in his audience.

The 2nd great truth might be: ""patriotism is an ever-present danger and the biggest of lies.""  He then proceeds to dismantle, piece by piece, the word and the meanings that people most commonly and thoughtlessly attach to it.  ""Idealogues"" have no place in Carlin's world--they're all programmed robots who substitute the deeply ingrained ""thought patterns of habit"" for actual thinking.  They're incapable of using thought to reflect upon thought, of abstract thinking, or understanding irony--they represent what William Blake had in mind when, at the dawn of the Romantic Period of the early 19th century, he railed--more loudly and relentlessly than any previous writer in English--against the industrial age, the machinations of both big government and the exploitive Church, and above all against Reason itself, with its ""mind-forged manacles"" that, during the preceding century (called variously the ""Enlightenment"" or the ""Age of Reason"") had destroyed the souls of men and women, smothering the faculty of the Imagination, which it would be the Romantic poets' task to rescue and restore to a pre-eminent place in the consciousness of liberated human beings.

Carlin may be less spontaneous than many of his peers because he has to be: he can't rely on the cult of personality and celebrity.  It's his subject matter and the words that express it that account for his power as the greatest satirist of modern times.  He was our Jonathan Swift (author of ""A Modest Proposal"" and ""Gulliver's Travels"").  Unlike Pryor, he doesn't waste any words--there are no throwaways, no ""faux"" asides to a group of brothers.  Unlike Williams, he doesn't encourage any sentiment and he doesn't pull punches.  There's a movie in which 20+ comedians are asked to tell the same filthy joke.  Robin plays it safe.  Carlin dives right in, giving a performance reminiscent of a jazz virtuoso like Oscar Peterson. (Gilbert Gottfried is the winner because of his placement in the sequence and his underdog status.)  I recommend the film (for certain temperaments and ages).  It demonstrates how the best surgeons perform at their best when given the most horrendous afflictions and injuries to work with.  It's those challenges that bring out their best.

I live near Milwaukee, where Carlin was arrested for saying in public a word forbidden by the city statutes.  He even did time in jail for using that word.  My hunch is that he enjoyed every minute of his imprisonment.  He had accomplished something that we as educators have trled and failed to do for the past 5-6 decades--viz. to demonstrate the power of words to young people, showing them how to make sense out of a frequently senseless world and to understand how their own words can shape that world for the better while admitting them to that eye-opening, mind awakening venture that Socrates pronounced the only reason for living because, as he asserted before surrendering to the government, ""the unexamined life is not fit to be lived by any human being.""",1440115200,15,7635,5.24404272801972

2873666,4,B000RPCJBG,"I LOVE George Carlin. His earlier shows were a bit slow-paced and not at all times funny. But as he explained himself he learned his wordings and his pace later in his career. So this set show beautifully how George re-invented himself in this 20 year retrospect of his career (1977-2007). On the first discs he is kind of observing the environment and trying different things (weather man, seven words, baseball) but later on becomes more and more enraged by politics and such. But it's an interesting change and certainly for the better.

A very big plus is that the shows were put on DVD with subtitles, that's fantastic. But I can't give it five stars simply because the set was released prematurely in 2007 and therefore his LAST show ever ""it's bad for ya!"" is missing in this collection. Sadly. If it would have been included it would definitely be ""ALL his stuff"". Buy it people, buy it!",1379721600,5,895,4.628930817610063

2873680,5,B000RPCJBG,"I don't have many regrets in my life, but one of them was not seeing George Carlin perform in my hometown when I had the chance.  Two years later, a fifth heart attack tragically succeeded in doing what the other four had tried to, only really half-assed.  It was the only celebrity death I've ever felt even the least bit affected by on a personal level, strange as that sounds.

Growing up, I'd heard bits and pieces of his routines on an AM/FM cassette my dad still had, but my first real introduction to Carlin was ""You're All Diseased"" on HBO, and after that, I was pretty much hooked on Carlin's endearing, yet unapologetically caustic stage presence, the hilarious dissection of semantics and wordplay, and even came to find that a lot of his more politically charged humor resonated very strongly with me.  I have all his books, including the autobiography, and I'm working on collecting all his stand up routines that are on various audio media.  I got this collection when it was first released (and when it was significantly cheaper), and was so glad to have done so.

This collection was released before ""It's Bad for Ya"", so it's the only HBO stand-up not included, but it has some additional material discussing Carlin's standup and some of his life, as well, growing up in New York.  You'll still want to pick up the audio tracks elsewhere, but this is a great collection for one of the great standup comedians of this or any age, and one who continues to be sorely missed by so many who found a common voice in an uncompromising, rebellious, and truly one-of-a-kind prick.",1373241600,7,1588,4.65

Listen guys and gals, the reviews about ""visual quality"" clearly do not have any sense of time and/or technology. The first special is in what, '77? So really, come on, recognize the era these priceless pieces were recorded in, guys. It's like bitching about your original press Green River album skipping a bit nowadays because it is not up to the robotic sound of ""today's top music"" (which happens to sound like robots, aka no one is vocalizing anymore but the computer they ""sing"" into). This is Carlin... If you are a true fan, you have voted a clear cut FIVE on this product because of the CONTENT... If you expected HD quality on you bluray player or whatever, you bought professional quality comedy from a time before the time of professional visual presentation and I am sorry for you. Buy the audio cd? I don't know what to tell you... But, for those FANS of Mr. Carlin, THIS is an amazing bundle of his specials for an amazing price.

I am somewhat perplexed that Amazon lists this box set as being region 1 encoded when it plainly states that it is ALL region on my copy. Amazon seems to do this pretty much across the board, which renders their region claims all but useless to anyone seeking correct information about the titles offered for sale, forcing us to search elsewhere for more accurate info. So, while it is quite easy to verify that this box set is labelled as ALL region on the box, potential purchasers might be interested to learn that discs 3-5 in my set are NOT region 0 but are region 1.

The box itself is great as well as the bonus material, but throughout the first special as well as the third and fourth (and one or two more) there are these horizontal lines--a couple of dozens of them--occupying all of screen, and they're highyl visual and create striped blurs over the whole screen during sudden movement (the speed of movement that is required for a heavy blur to appear varies from disc to disc, but it's more obvious on close-up shots, and the first special suffers the most.) This unfortunate flaw really effects your mood while trying to concentrate on Carlin's shows...so a few of these discs have been exposed to some sort of digital over-compression, while a bit over half are just fine. Actually, on the ""George on George"" documentary on one of the two bonus discs, clips are shown from several of these specials, but the quality is crisp and clear, and you think to yourself ""why can't the actual shows on the other discs look this great?"" ...it's a shame. I own no other of Carlin's HBO shows separately, and don't know if most of the early ones suffer from this over-compression or whatever it is the way they do here, but I'm almost ready to buy one of them just to see if I can replace the discs in this set...but I suspect that these are just gathered discs of all already separately released DVD's.

...oh, and I don't think I have to explain anything about George Carlin and his stand-up for this product. He's a legend, and you know his stuff (you wouldn't be considering buying this pricey box if you weren't familiar with his comedy from before) ...I just wanted to be the first one to point out this unfortunate flaw. It's the only flaw, but it's a big one.",1225152000,85,2076,4.580645161290323

2873829,5,B000RPCJBG,"George Carlin creates a persona on stage that is difficult not to love.
In real life, He was a gentle man, but on stage he was tough as nails on our hypocrisy as people.
I just wanted the little baby who wrote about stand up blasphemy to know that as a comedian myself we are allowed to make fun of whatever we want...so get over it...maybe you can ask Jesus for that funnybone you've always wanted and never gotten....",1215216000,6,419,4.3164556962025316

I bought this set a few Christmas ago,but I knew before that it would be funny & worth it. I saw George in 1981 for about $ 10.00. He was last in Houston during Christmas 07,but I missed him cause my dad was in the hospital.

Sad to say but my dad passed away two weeks before George,but Before George passed,I caught his last HBO Special ""Bad For Ya"" between visits.
And He was as usual,AWESOME. I'll be in line to get the DVD of ""Bad"" when
it comes out.

Both the CD & First DVD collections are great. They were like the Memorial
Marathon HBO had last week. Vintage George to the present""BAD"".

2873832,5,B000RPCJBG,"As a fan of many years,since the age of 12 or so seeing him in Bill and Ted. I grew to love,admire,and learn from his wit and advice. His use of language was one of his best things. Always taking phrases such as ""takes the cake"",and turning it into a logical arguement againest using it while remaining funny. Although Mel Brooks and co. created the term (I think) in History of the World pt 1, George Carlin was truly a ""stand-up philospher.""",1214438400,5,443,4.414634146341464

2873862,5,B000RPCJBG,"I awoke this morning to some very sad news........one of my heroes has died! George Carlin was one of the greatest comedians of all time and he was so much more! Not only did he make us laugh until we cried, he also made some very intelligent and profound observations. With a comedy career spanning over 50 years, this Irish-American life erudite never walked on egg shells or pulled any punches!

Sadly, he was only a few months away from receiving The Mark Twain Prize for American Humor. I'm sure he was aware of how much he was loved and how special his brand of comedy is. I'm glad he went out on a high note with one of his funniest comedy specials ever!.....It's Bad For Ya! I'll be the first in line to buy it when it comes out on DVD.
