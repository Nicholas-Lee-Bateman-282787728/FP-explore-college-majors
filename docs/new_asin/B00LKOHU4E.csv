Linda is very supportive, and is well versed in the challenges of Parkinsons. The first time I did this I
slept better and felt better when I woke up. I like the review of movements she does at the end. She
keeps it interesting. I can see most with parkinsons would be able to do this. Peace to all with these
challenging symptoms.",1421971200,4,433,4.2926829268292686
