2034280,4,B0001WTV84,I thought the movie plot and the humor displayed throughout the movie was tasteful and easy to follow. The reason we purchased the movie was primarily because Sherrie Renae Scott is my sister-in-law and when I found out she made a movie with Brook Shields and Rip Torn my wife (Sharon)insisted we purchase it.,1120780800,4,309,4.7407407407407405
2034281,3,B0001WTV84,"Rip Torn plays an FBI agent who has thirty-five or more lawn mowers, his apparent hobby in this innocuous but unremarkable movie, which is supposedly based on true events.  Dylan Walsh (Nip/Tuck, Congo) plays ex-navy seal Frank Syler who finds himself engaged/married to the perfect babe, Cyndi (played with a comic flourish by Brooke Shields).  Only problem is Cyndi wants the best things in life and so in order to accommodate her, they plan to rob the bank where Cyndi works.  Do they get away with it, and what is with this bracelet of Cyndi's which she's always losing.  Hint:  it figures prominently in the movie's resolution.

Shields and Walsh have little chemistry together, but both try gamely to bring some life to their cardboard characters.  Sherie Rene Scott as Dana, Cyndi's workmate and friend, plays the dumb blonde to the point of sincerity that one wonders if she ISN'T really that dumb.  Torn has some almost good moments, but the script's weakness is that Torn has no problem at all in immediately without any real proof assuming Walsh is guilty.  Pedestrian direction by David Burton Morris doesn't help, and Alessandro Nivola as Doug the Bug is atrocious.  But in spite of its many flaws, it's an occasionally entertaining caper, better than a lot of other higher priced fare, e.g. Ocean's 12.",1106352000,6,1316,4.887387387387387

8017059,5,B0001WTV84,"I bought this movie because I've been a Brooke Shields fan as far back as The Brooke Book and her child modeling days.  I was expecting nothing.  I was SHOCKED at what a good movie it is and how terrific Brooke is in it.  Who knew she was such an amazingly good comedienne?  The concept is great (based on a true event), the script is as sharp as a tack, the cast is superb, and a good time is had by all.  Yes, it's a caper movie, but a you've never seen such a pair of simpleminded and naive capesters  You're gonna love it!  A real screwball comedy if there ever was one!",1461369600,,574,4.0265486725663715

8017062,1,B0001WTV84,"Seemed like a very silly '80s movie with the hair, clothes, makeup, and words used in the script. I really would not recommend watching this as the movie has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. The Almost Perfect Bank Robbery is simply stupid. If you want to see Brooke Shields or Dylan Walsh quite a bit younger than they are today, then you might want to give this movie a try. Otherwise, save your hour and a half for something else.",1416528000,,435,4.518987341772152
8017063,3,B0001WTV84,"The Almost Perfect Bank Robbery- Brooke Shields stars. A cop and his expensive fiance, a bank teller, plan the perfect bank robbery.

All goes well until the FBI suspects, almost immediately, an inside job. Their plans to move the money out of the country, then just to cover their tracks, make them look more and more guilty.",1392681600,,326,4.719298245614035
8017064,5,B0001WTV84,"this was a good/quarky movie...a real gem! It's a kind of laugh a minute film I enjoyed watching. I was looking for a light comedy and this filled the job. It's a real treat to watch a beautiful woman be so entertaining,if you don't take it to serious it's fun!",1389139200,2,261,4.24

8017067,5,B0001WTV84,"Almost Perfect Bank Robbery sat on a shelf at CBS for two years because the network was feuding with Brooke Shields.  They finally dumped it on television in the middle of the summer because they were contractually obligated.  The film was never sent out for reviews but somehow the Los Angeles Times saw it and called it ""a Preston Sturgis-like comedy where Brooke Shields finally lets her comedic talents shine.""",1250726400,3,414,4.9
