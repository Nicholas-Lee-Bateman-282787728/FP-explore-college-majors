1817098,3,B00007JMD0,I got this video by accident a tag sale when it was in a Better Late Than Never case. I already had that video and it was only a dollar. Well it's not excatly what I had wanted. George Carlin is a great narrator but these episodes would be better with Ringo narrating. I also find it annoying that in the sodar superstar hall of fame they ignore that the older tapes ever existed. Some of these episodes are really good and they focus on the engines being helpful and useful. I just wish we could enjoy these videoes in there oringinal tapes such as Tenders & Turntables and Better Late than Never. These are good since you can no longer purchase those videos but they never should've been discontinued in the first place.,1077148800,4,722,4.395522388059701
1817139,4,B00007JMD0,"I cannot figure out how the Thomas movies enrapture little boys but they do.  Stiff little wooden figures and slow action should not be recipes for success, but they work with Thomas! They have good messages and teach children they might make mistakes but they can repair some of the damage done by admitting their wrongs and doing their best to make things better. You don't see this message very often outside of church.  My 3 year old grandson can't get enough of Thomas and Friends.",1363478400,,486,4.6395348837209305

1817141,2,B00007JMD0,"My personal issue with these stories is the constant angst of the characters.  It's pretty negative. I get tired of all the engines having ""issues"" with one another and grumpy faces. And saying ""shut up"" is not the best example for a toddler.  I much rather use the DVD with the english actor ""Thomas Great Discovery"". It has singing and is so much more enjoyable to listen to.",1310860800,2,377,4.529411764705882
1817142,4,B00007JMD0,"This t.v. show is great to watch on PBS kids channel for my little brother, but this dvd is okay but they are actually acting like people too much and my brother likes to copy what ever he sees and thats not good for as this video, but hey it might just be me.",1304553600,,260,3.8333333333333335

My one year old nephew absolutely loves this particular Thomas DVD, tried him on others but this one stands out. He smiles and his face lights up when it comes on.",1217116800,,414,7.829787234042553
1817144,5,B00007JMD0,"My 3 yr. old son and I watch this DVD quite a bit. I try to limit him to 3 stories a day (they are about 5 minutes long each) but I sometimes enjoy them so much that we watch a few extra.

I was a little surprised at some of the language in the stories at first (although ""shut-up"" is only said once, in the Donald and Douglas story) but then realized that the way the engines talk to each other, and the situations they find themselves in, is not so much different from what my son experiences with his friends. I'm sure that's why he loves it so much. He relates to them and is fascinated with the predicaments they get into.

I watch them with him and we talk about it. When Donald pushes the Brake Van, we talk about how it's okay to be mad, but not okay to push. The same with ""shut-up""--how it's probably not the best way to express your anger--it's better to tell the person more specifically about what is bothering you.

I think some of our most interesting conversations have come out of watching these stories. And I love it that when someone is mad, my son says they are ""cross"".",1127692800,6,1091,4.185714285714286
1817145,4,B00007JMD0,"This DVD was our introduction to Thomas videos -- I chose it because it had 1 hour of programs, and a good selection of episodes, and my girls are recently fascinated by trains.  After reading some of the other reviews, I have to say I can't help but wonder if we've watched the same DVD?  I don't recall hearing the words ""shut up"" at all.  I've always thought one of the points of children's video was to illustrate right and wrong.  How can they understand the difference unless they see or experience examples of both?  Personally, if my children see a video of someone being mean, I am in the room and I point out that the character is being mean or naughty. (Yes, I teach them myself.  No, my children do not sit in front of the tv all day.  Interaction with me comes first, but when I *am* buying videos, I'm not about to torture them with the likes of that insipid purple monstrosity, or some of the other horrid, babyish productions out there!)

Oh, a hint for escaping the torture of all that advertising:  use the ""fast forward"" button, or the ""skip chapter"" button.  Then, you should be able to use your ""menu"" button with some actual results! :)  It doesn't always work, but most of the time, you'll be successful!

So, the upshot of my review is that the video seems fine to me -- my girls love it -- and I will probably buy them another Thomas DVD for a little variety.  But that's just my two cents.",1116288000,2,1415,4.334600760456274
1817146,1,B00007JMD0,"After hearing rave reviews and having my 2yo adore anything with trains I thought this would be a fun video to own. Perhaps I'm overly sensitive, but I find all of these characters whiny, passive aggressive and rude. This tape, when listened to with adult ears, is really appalling. For example, in one episode Thomas says to another engine ' ""Whew! What is that smell? Do you smell it?"" I think it's ditch water! Ha, Ha"" Gordon had recently fallen into a ditch and Thomas liked to tease him about it'.  In another episode several of the engines decide they don't want to do work that it for ""smaller engines"". Sir Topham Hat says to Thomas ""The other engines are sulking and I've shut them up (yes those are his exact words) I want you to...""  And yet again-there is an engine that is apparently clumsy. Another engine intentionally rams into him and says ""There's more of that comin' if you mess up again."" Good Grief!  On top of that one of the engines in nearly every episode tells someone to shut up. No matter how nice they ""become"" in the end, I don't want my son to learn that that kind of language, or any of their behavior, is appropriate.",1084060800,5,1149,4.436018957345971

7977236,2,B00007JMD0,"My boys and I love Thomas the Train, but this particular DVD has lessons that I don't think are appropriate for children.  I also don't like that they have the characters tell each other to ""shut up"".  I know this may seem overboard, but I have to find videos that support the lessons I am trying to teach my children.
