7978843,4,B0000844JW,"The first two episodes in this set are humorous, especially episode 6. The plot is also a little more entertaining. If you didn't like the first DVD, give this one a try. There is a complete absence of blood so don't be expecting a lot of action.",1183680000,,246,4.25531914893617
7978844,5,B0000844JW,"Volume 2 seemed to be the more humorous volume of all. The train episode was one of my favorites (Episode 6). That alone won me over, just because there were so many characters with their own seperate stories. It plays upon how people jump to conclusions just by looking and how all of these stories intertwine and cause havoc for a poor old train conductor trying to get somewhere on time. It was beautifully played.",1093651200,,417,4.573333333333333
7978845,3,B0000844JW,"It is MUCH better then the first set, ... the first set cramed too much story into too much little time, The 2nd set suffers from Not enough story.
But it's still much better then the first one.
There where some actual scenes that had me laughing too! and I'm actually starting to care for the characters!
But it is still not a great anime, and I still won't give it 4 stars, the series is still only ok/good.
If you are a fan of the video game series I think like me you probably liked that tune that played in the starting anime intro to the original Wild Arms game.  Yes it is actually heard in the 6th Episode of this series! I was so glade to hear it.
Anyways I hope this series improves, but they have gotten a little better in my opinion.",1048291200,,745,4.102739726027397
