377275,5,6301914120,I have loved this movie since I was a child. Linda Blaire is incredible in this movie. Martin Sheen portrays the mentally ill almost a little to real.  I expecially love the reffernce to the gold brocaide curtains what a great trick. I highly recommend this film for anyone who does not believe that all people are able to be manipulated by someone else regardless of what you may believe them to be.  great flick !!!,1020556800,12,417,4.473684210526316

377415,5,6301914120,"I saw this movie back in 1975. I bought it when it came out on VHS. I recently acquired it on DVD. I love this movie. Both Linda Blair & Martin Sheen were excellent. If you are looking for a different sort of a love story this is it. For the most part I loved the story and even today when Linda's character recites, ""Cabin of the Dawn"" the tears flow. Now I don't have to sink down in my seat in the movie theatre to hide my tears. I am so glad this movie is finally available on DVD and I highly recommend it. I am purposely not talking about the story. It is for the viewer to discover. If this doesn't touch your heart I don't know what will.",1395705600,,646,3.9389312977099236

377528,5,6301914120,"This is a must for all Martin Sheen fans.  Many as myself know this movie was aired back in 1975.  Those same people also know it has not been aired since 2000.  Those looking for this movie since then, also knows many poor quality copies been put out for purchase, at outrageous prices.  This is the one you all want.  Top quality picture and sound (10/10). You will not be disappointed.  Now if you can add The Last Survivors; a Martin Sheen, 1975 televised release to your inventory. You see many more sales.

Thanks Amazon

377529,5,6301914120,"I fell in love with this film when I was 14.  It was playing on one of those women's movie daytime channels on a day I was home sick from ninth grade.  Even though it was a dorky 70's flick, it was so unique that it captivated me utterly.  Ah, how teen girls do love to imagine playing savior to beautiful, troubled, dangerous men.  And to think, the guy's not even a vampire!  This is one of those haunting courtly-love type films that you just can't forget.  I am SO delighted to be able to get this on DVD!

377531,5,6301914120,"I am new at this, so I am not sure if I am commenting on the quality of the product or the contents. It was an old movie named Sweet Honesty starring Martin Sheen and Linda Blair in which Martin Sheen excapes from a dewlling for the insane! He was a avaid book reader and expecially ones that were adventurous. With out giving too much of the story away, he, though susposingly insane, seemed to have more sanity than most people in this movie! What I got out of it is,""what really constitutes insanity?"" Excellent story line and believeable acting! It was worth even more than I paid for the movie. Even though it was on vhs! Ctaffy",1294444800,,633,4.372881355932203
377532,5,6301914120,"Sweet Hostage first aired in 1975 as a TV movie.  Sheen's energetic, lyrical performance captured the imagination of a bookish 12 year old  who had a few things in common with Linda Blair's lonely tomboy, Doris Mae.  The movie engendered in me a life long love of the well spoken word, a fondness for the poetry Blake and Coleridge, and a terrific crush on Martin Sheen.

 There are plenty of other reviews here which tell you more about the quality of this touching movie - read them. And if you think you'd like to see Sweet Hostage (which is notoriously hard to find on VHS and doesn't seem to exist legitimately on DVD) or like me you just need to own a copy of this movie so you can watch it again and again; You can vote cast your vote on the TMC website to have Sweet Hostage transferred to DVD.  If enough people vote; perhaps next time a fan does a search on ""Linda Blair"", or ""Martin Sheen""  Amazon will direct us right to the DVD offering for ""Sweet Hostage ""

377533,4,6301914120,"Here's an example of the small art film that used to be made for TV. Thoughtful & moving, it's a reminder of a time when madness was a symbol for freedom & imagination, rather than serial killing & other horrors. No, it's not completely ""realistic"" -- but that complaint is utterly beside the point. It's about breaking free of the everyday world, stepping outside the social roles imposed on us, and realizing more of our potential. It's also a tender love story, one that certainly wouldn't be allowed on TV today! Martin Sheen is excellent, as might be expected, but Linda Blair holds her own with him. It's a shame she didn't get more roles like this one; her acting career might have been very different. And if the story gets a touch too precious at times, that's forgivable. I'd much rather see a film take that risk, instead of simply playing it safe.

Like previous reviewers, I'd love to see this released on DVD, preferably with commentary by both Sheen & Blair. Until then, cherish that fragile VHS tape! You won't see a story like this one being made today, and more's the pity. Recommended for anyone with a dreamer's heart & imagination.

Feb 16, 2014 update - Well, no commentary yet, but the film is available on DVD at last! I watched it again recently, and it still holds up beautifully. The messages of non-comformity -- of breaking out of the cramped & narrow box society may have placed you in -- of becoming more of a whole human being -- resonate all the more urgently today.",1179360000,25,1499,4.568773234200743
