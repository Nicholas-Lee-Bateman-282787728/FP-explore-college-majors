8324911,4,B0009J2M4O,"This is a great CD for those who are interested in learning the Traditional Arts.  Peter captures a ""classroom atmosphere"" that is engaging and makes you feel as though you were there during it's taping.  Between his witty sense of humor and extensive Craft knowledge, you will leave the experience with a richer understandng of some basic cord magic principles, and the lore that is associated with it.
