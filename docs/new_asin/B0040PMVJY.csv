8412427,5,B0040PMVJY,"A great movie, I was on the edge of my seat the whole time, Director Paul Murray did an unbelievable job, great acting throughout the film.",1418256000,,139,4.384615384615385
8412428,5,B0040PMVJY,"I watched with some skepticism, but became pretty impressed with the psychological aspects. Very good with fresh brewed coffee. Great drunk flick, on the par with anything classic studios used to make, better than what's out now.",1319673600,,229,5.216216216216216
8412429,5,B0040PMVJY,This a really cool small film.  I felt the tension all the way through.  What a perfect setting (AA meeting)  The acting is perfect.  Every single character is solid.  I hope to see more of these actors many other films.  This is what movie making should be.  You should check out this film!,1294531200,,291,4.377358490566038
8412430,5,B0040PMVJY,"I can't add much to the above reviews, except to confirm their sentiments on it.  Sometimes the lower budget films deliver the most. The over reliance on advanced technology, lush and over-done film sets, unecessary periphernalia and so on won't be found in this film, but you'll be dragged along throughout by the emotion that is well portrayed here.  You'll sense that you're right in the room with the characters themselves, uncertain whether you'll live or die.  Definitely worth getting your copy.",1294099200,,502,5.097560975609756
8412431,5,B0040PMVJY,"This is a terrific film for anyone who has ever attended an A.A. meeting, although it certainly appeals to mainstream audiences as well.  The dialogue is right out of the big-book and A.A. practices, which sets an ironic mood when disrupted by fugitives from a police dragnet.  Clearly, writer-director Paul Murray knows his stuff, both from a story-teller's standpoint as well as one who apparently has put in some time at such meetings.  I was a big fan of Dog Day Afternoon, so it hit me while watching Boiler Maker what a great idea is it set a bank-robbers-hostage crisis in a controlled situation, like an Alcoholic's Anonymous meeting!  I have purchased my copy, as I know I'll enjoy seeing Boiler Maker in the future... especially with friends of mine that might need a little nudge towards considering attendance at a meeting for ""the program"" that forms the setting of this film!",1289952000,2,889,4.828947368421052
8412432,5,B0040PMVJY,"Boiler Maker takes the serene setting of a Southern California Alcholics Anonymous meeting, and mixes it up with a couple of bank robbers on the run to create a truly unique situation that really works. Granted, some of the dialogue and references might fly over the heads of those that have not experienced a substance abuse support group.  But the suspense and tension is universally understood and that's what makes Boiler Maker such a lovely little discovery.  Check it out!",1289952000,3,478,4.9625
8412433,5,B0040PMVJY,"Great Independent film with solid performances and a few stand outs worth mentioning.  Remember the name Arie Verveen.  He plays a bad guy that you love to hate.  He should be a household name soon.
First time director Paul Murray does a great job keeping the edginess and tension going throughout this film. Very believable ensemble cast, and I enjoyed seeing the great John Savage again.
The audience feels like they're in the room with the hostages especially when the tension heats up in the small room they're being held in.  Actor Joey Diaz stands out and provides just enough comic relief to break the ice for all in the room.  Nice score throughout and two great songs over the opening and closing credits.

The tag line for the movie says it all.  ""Two Bank Robbers Take An AA Meeting Hostage...  BIG MISTAKE""
There's a few times during the film that you don't know who to feel more sorry for - The hostages or the bank robbers.  I can't image how hard it would be to locked in a room with a bunch of recovering addicts!  The 90 minute running time makes this a quick one, which is never a bad thing.

Bottom line: Great little film that you won't regret watching.",1286496000,4,1173,4.485849056603773
