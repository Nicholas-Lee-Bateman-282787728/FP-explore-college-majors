Yesterday evening I just didn't want to work out. I use a variety of cycling, walking, and hiking videos to inspire me, but I just didn't want a really tough workout. I looked through some of my new DVDs to see if one would just reach out and grab me.

'American Gems' includes some of my favorite parts of the country, spectacular areas around Monterey, Pebble Beach, and 17-Mile Drive in California, and that was enough for me to give it a try. There were other drives which included Nevada and Maine, for a unique variety of choices, all good.

Immediately my mood improved and I started enjoying the ride. These are gorgeous views. I was able to go as fast as I wanted to for my own workout purposes, which weren't too optimistic yesterday as I started. As I got into the workout I checked my heart rate monitor and noticed that I was getting a good workout. While some of that music is a little cheesy (in a good way), it did keep my cadence going strong throughout. There is no narration, which was good yesterday because I wasn't in the mood for any. There were gorgeous mountains and valleys, and oh those ocean views! Even though we mainly saw what was directly ahead of us, most of the time we had a good close view of the ocean.

I believe that the Bike-O-Vision DVDs are appropriate for just about anyone. They don't push you to do more than you want to do, but you can use their music for a good workout or put your own on there and push it as far as you want to go.",1330041600,2,1626,4.338815789473684
