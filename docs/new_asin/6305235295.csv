Brilliantly. To watch comic genius Neil Simon wipe his eyes from laughing so much is mind blowing. How do you make Neil Simon laugh? Put him in a room with Caesar's writers.",1276214400,2,344,4.073529411764706
7886533,5,6305235295,"I was the host of this evening, as it was my privilege to share the stage with these legendary writers.  For months leading up to the event, I was buried in research, pre-interviews, and all sorts of planning, all of which paid off handsomely in a wonderfully memorable evening.  Forget the horribly edited version you may have had the misfortune of seeing on PBS... this is very close to what that magical night was actually like at the Writers Guild Theater.  Sorry you couldn't have been there, but this makes it possible for you to enjoy it regardless.",973123200,6,556,4.653061224489796
