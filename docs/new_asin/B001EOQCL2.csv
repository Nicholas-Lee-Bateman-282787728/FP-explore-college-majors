3556520,5,B001EOQCL2,"The Criterion 2-disc Bottle Rocket is outstanding, but don't toss your original disc just yet... the new edition is a slightly different edit that loses one laugh and adds another. I couldn't find any reference to these changes in the supplementary material at all.

MISSING: Originally, during the book store robbery, Anthony grabs a random book off the shelf and opens it, revealing the title page ""Job Opportunities in Government - 1995"" which always gave me a little chuckle. Now for some reason the book opens to a black and white  photograph of a military plane (it goes by so fast you'd have to freeze frame to make it out.) ** UPDATE *** per the new Wes Anderson coffee table book, we learn that the military plane shot was in the original cut ( a bit of non-sequitor humor... you think Anthony is reading something important enough to distract him from the business of robbing the store, only to discover its a completely off-topic, random photograph.) The studio wanted a more obvious laugh so they had Wes reshoot the ""Job Opportunities..."" title page (which, if you look closely, was just taped into the book). This Criterion edition restores the original shot.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wes-Anderson-Collection/dp/081099741X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wes Anderson Collection</a>

ADDED: Originally, when Bob hands his earnings over to Future Man to cover his attorney fees, he asks if he can keep a few bucks for gas, and the scene ends. Now the scene plays a few seconds longer, and we hear Future Man's reply: ""No, you can't.""

In addition to these minor (and somewhat baffling) changes, I was also  unable to find any images of the one-sheet art or logo anywhere on this set (as appears on the menu page and sleeve of the original release).

So if you're a hardcore Bottle Rocket fan or completist, hang onto your old disc and buy this set as well. In addition to a beautiful transfer, commentary track, documentary, the original short film, and other extras, the booklet insert is a miniature replica of Dignan's 75-Year Plan notebook, along with reproductions of Anthony's drawing of Inez on horseback, the book store heist plan schematics, etc.",1227830400,75,2215,5.138888888888889
3556521,3,B001EOQCL2,"I saw ""Bottle Rocket"" at my local indie cinema upon its release twelve years ago and have rewatched it again many times since on DVD. Naturally, I was really looking forward to the Criterion version. Overall impression - disappointing. The commentary provided little insight into the actual making of the movie aside from comments like ""Remember when we filmed there?"", ""That guy was a friend of ours"" and ""The movie tested badly"" (over and over again). The phone call thing between Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson didn't work (in twelve years they couldn't get these two guys together in the same room for an hour and a half?) Wes seemed game but Owen seemed a little out of it (or at least, his voice was flat and disinterested). He had a lot more enthusiasm on the commentary for ""Rushmore""; even ""Wedding Crashers"". The making-of documentary was really bare bones (25 minutes?) and again didn't shed any real light on the film. (Watch the ""Iron Man"" DVD for a REAL making-of documentary.) The high point was Laura Wilson's behind-the-scenes photos. The deleted scenes were okay and it was great watching the short film without the choppiness of YouTube. So - some nice features but the hastily put-together feel of the commentary and the documentary really put me off. It's too good a movie and it's been too long a wait for those involved not to have put their best efforts into all of the features on this disc.",1227657600,14,1414,4.728744939271255
3556522,5,B001EOQCL2,"Taking a trip into Wes Anderson's head is like going into a parallel universe where most things are the same, but the nature of reality is just slightly warped.

And while the world of ""Bottle Rocket"" -- Anderson's first collaboration with actor Owen Wilson -- is a little rough around the edges, the absurdist crime caper is a jewel. And while it sounds like yet another goofy comedy, Anderson's signature quirkiness is already in place -- a heavy dose of his dry, erratic, clever wit and some lovable misfit characters.

After being treated for exhaustion (""You haven't worked a day in your life. How could you be exhausted?""), Anthony (Luke Wilson) has just been released from a voluntary mental hospital.

His ""rescuer"" is his idealistically weird pal Dignan (Owen Wilson), who has decided to become a master criminal. To this end, he has created an elaborate 75-year plan of theft and heists. You can guess where that's going to take them. After an absurd first heist, they recruit the timid Bob (Bob Musgrave) as the getaway driver, as he is the only one who has a car.

And so the odd little trio practice for a while on smaller-time burglaries, such as robbing a bookstore and Anthony's own house -- then hiding out at a motel, where Anthony falls in love with the pretty South-American maid (Lumi Cavazos). However, the guys find themselves in hot water when they bump into a REAL master criminal (James Caan), and Bob bails out on them. The hot water is rising.

Comedic crime caper movies are hard to make, because of the need for balance between the criminal activities and the comedy... without making any of it too stupid or over the top. Wes Anderson solves this dilemma by making this a caper carried off by affluent young slackers who could easily do stuff other than thieving their way through life. And that's half of ""Bottle Rocket's"" comedy appeal right there -- the unlikely criminals.

The other half is handling humor that would be stupid and forgettable in another auteur's hands. Wes Anderson's uniquely quirky touch is a little rough in his full-length debut, but it's that slightly unpolished touch that makes his offbeat style such a delight here -- as an example, Anthony ""escapes"" from a hospital that he can leave anytime he wants. That unnecessarily complex opener sets the tone of the rest of the movie, of thrill-seeking young men who are just a little out of sync with the rest of the world.

And ""Bottle Rocket"" shares the dry, funny, erratic humor of Anderson's later movies, albeit in a slightly more energetic manner (""Here are just a few of the key ingredients: dynamite, pole vaulting, laughing gas, choppers..."" Dignan explains). And the scripting is peppered with a thousand funny little lines (""Which part of Mexico are you from?"" ""Paraguay""). Anderson and Wilson avoid being self-consciously cool, in favor of being earnestly quirky.

And the Wilson brothers -- Owen and Luke both -- are in fine form here as the Odd Couplish friends, especially when interacting with one another. Anthony is calmer, more laid-back and thinks a lot, while Dignan is idealistic and wacky almost to the point of mental illness. This pair have a certain innocence despite their illegal ambitions, and while they're goofy misfits, they're not the kind you laugh at.

Since most of Wes Anderson's work has been released in a Criterion deluxe edition, it's about freaking time someone gave similarly loving care to ""Bottle Rocket."" Both the forthcoming double-disc DVD edition and the Blu-ray edition are going to have a wealth of extras for fans of Anderson's, and it's hard to imagine that there's any more it would need. Criterion has apparently not only put in everything it needs, but actually slightly more.

In particular, it has newly restored picture, eleven deleted scenes that were left on the cutting room floor, actor/director commentary from Anderson and Owen Wilson, a new documentary about the making of the film, screen tests, storyboards, behind the scenes photographs, and a booklet with essay by James L. Brooks and ""appreciation"" by Martin Scorsese. As an extra bonus, it has some short films as well -- a 1970s half-hour film called ""Murita Cycles"" about a bicycle repairman/philosopher, and the 1994 short film ""Bottle Rocket"" that served as the basis for the full-length one.

""Bottle Rocket"" is a bit erratic and rough around the edges, but it's also fresh, weird and delightfully zany. Anderson should try his hand at this sort of stuff again, because he has a rare talent for such films.",1219449600,2,4537,4.89453125

3556554,5,B001EOQCL2,"***Spoilers Within***

Bottle Rocket is one of the hardest movies I've ever decided to review. The story isn't great and the acting isn't meant to be taken seriously. There aren't any memorable messages or profound events. So why has it become one of my favorite comedies?

It's all about tone and style.

Director Wes Anderson doesn't look for the obvious laugh. It doesn't matter whether the story makes sense or whether events fit perfectly. Anderson reminds me of David Lynch in some ways, but the subject matter is generally much lighter. He creates worlds, and there's something not quite right with those worlds. It makes them fascinating places to visit.

Bottle Rocket begins with Anthony (Luke Wilson) feigning escape from a mental institution which he attends voluntarily. He does this to make things more exciting for his friend, Dignan (Owen Wilson). Dignan is an interesting character. He's capable of doing idiotic things, but he's not exactly stupid. He just can't see the danger in some of the bizarre things he attempts. We are shown his 75-year plan, outlining all the goals he's aiming to reach over the course of his life.

Dignan sees himself as a criminal mastermind and practices by helping Anthony rob his own house. The pair hang around with their friend, Bob (Musgrove), who drives their getaway car because he's the only one of the group who owns a car. The group proves how utterly inept it is during a bookstore robbery. They are so bad that it works well as comedy. After the robbery, the group decides to flee the town and hides in a motel.

Anthony falls in love with a housekeeper at the motel, despite the fact that she can barely speak any English. He does his best to communicate and occasionally enlists the help of someone to translate. That leads to major confusion at one point in the movie.

Dignan eventually introduces the gang to Mr. Henry (Caan), who once fired him from his job as a landscape gardener. Dignan believes that Henry's company is just a front and that he's also a criminal mastermind. He wants to prove to Henry that he can pull off robberies of his own and so he plans a raid on a storage facility with Anthony, Bob and some of Henry's friends. This sequence is ridiculous and highlights just how idiotic Dignan can be. When the robbery is interrupted and they have been seen, he instructs the group to put on their bandit masks.

Bottle Rocket marked the debuts of Luke and Owen Wilson, and Owen Wilson helped Wes Anderson with the screenplay. It's a film made by a group of friends who had known each other since they met in school. The film was rejected by the Sundance Festival, and initial test screenings were a disaster. It appeared that nobody wanted to embrace Anderson's quirky sense of humor. However, over the years, Bottle Rocket has gained a lot of fans.

Wes Anderson's career has blossomed since his debut, but he's always retained that quirky style and tone. Bottle Rocket isn't perfect, but it's significant to me because it's where everything began for Anderson.

Criterion's Blu-ray looks great and the special features provide fans with plenty of background information. It also contains the Bottle Rocket short and it's worth watching to see how the film evolved.",1333584000,2,3246,4.790697674418604

There's something in it about the loss of childhood dreams that resonates beyond the silly and playful surface. Always a good sign when a film deepens with time and re-visiting.

Anthony: One morning, over at Elizabeth's beach house, she asked me if I'd rather go water-skiing or lay out. And I realized that not only did I not want to answer THAT question, but I never wanted to answer another water-sports question, or see any of these people again for the rest of my life.

Anthony: So, did you enjoy your first visit to the nut house?

This is a must-have for all indie film lovers!  This is a beautiful and masterfully written story, a brilliant start for both Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson.  As his first acting role, I feel like Owen Wilson was more genuine and close to this character than he ever has been.  There is a lot of Dignan in Owen, and a lot of Owen in Dignan.  He's charming and such a wonderful and lovable character, in a kind of ""lost puppydog"" way.  The story is truly unique with a cast full of wonderful characters and unforgettable scenery and situations that will have you laughing until you are in tears.  It's easy to get lost in the world of Bottle Rocket, and the Criterion Collection is just another great way to do that.  This is a must-have for any collection, and especially for Owen Wilson fans that want to see how it all started!

3556564,5,B001EOQCL2,"To this day this is still one of my favorite movies. I saw this on VHS originally in high school around 1996, when my buddy brought a copy over. I knew I liked it and later re-discovered it again a few years later and have since been a big Wes Anderson fan.

Bottle Rocket creates a world where low level crime seems appealing. ""A life of crime does pay"". Dignan plays a great ringleader of the gang with his odd, quirky behavior. His brother Anthony plays the level headed character who falls in love with a girl, Inez,  under unusual circumstances. It's cool to watch the chemistry between brother Luke and Owen in their acting debut. The criterion addition also includes the original 13 minute black and white short which was a nice addition.

Great cinematography and music produced by Mark Mothersbaugh compliment the film very well. This is the movie that introduced me to the band ""Love"" as well as a host of others. Bottle Rocket's laid back breezy approach to crime is always a joy to watch.",1239926400,2,1000,4.575418994413408
3556565,5,B001EOQCL2,"The perfection of Wes Anderson's first film Bottle Rocket might lie in the fact that is isn't, and wasn't necessarily intended to be, a perfect film. Anderson tried to make perfect films later on (he failed with The Royal Tenenbaums, but came as close as any director can come with Rushmore), yet nothing he's done since has been as oddly affecting as his debut feature.

Part of the desperate charm of this ""little"" film can be attributed to its convoluted origins: the 13-minute short (directed by Anderson and co-written with college friend Owen Wilson) premiered at the Sundance Film Festival and attracted certain appropriate, important people. Despite the subsequent involvement, and unflagging endorsement of James L. Brooks (The Simpsons), the final script needed more time in the oven and more than a little TLC to get it ready for the big screen.

Despite the cast and crew's understandable confidence in what they ended up with, the initial test screenings were catastrophic, and Sundance inexplicably refused the full-length version of the film it had previously championed. Disillusioned but not defeated, Anderson and Wilson went back to the drawing board and (wisely) rewrote and reshot the entire beginning of the film. Their perseverance paid off. What could (and would) have, at best, been hailed (and/or discarded) as a cute, quirky effort instead arrived---after several years and more than a handful of detours---as a polished product, and a damn near perfect film.

All of that back-story is essential in order to properly appraise the not exactly auspicious evolution of this film. It also serves as (yet another) case study of how even the feel-good, left-field success stories are often only the final step in an arduous, sometimes painful artistic process. More importantly, the evidence of these two friends' unflappable natures underscores how their project came to fruition, and where the eccentric energy permeating the movie derives from.

Since lightning won't strike in the same place twice, it was a wonderful, albeit necessary happenstance that a first time director was working with a first time script with first time actors. Part of the innocent seduction people talk about when they talk about how they fell for this film is in no small part due to these aforementioned circumstances. In short, this balance of earnestness and ambition could never be duplicated by a veteran who has lived through the meat-grinding process of making a movie.

Now that Bottle Rocket is getting the Criterion Collection treatment, its status is officially elevated from cult-following to sanctified. Given its complicated history and the fact that it almost failed to make it out of the starting gate, what can we say, today, to elucidate how it (almost) flopped, and why it endures? Here is Martin Scorsese (taken from the DVD booklet, quoted from an appreciation of Anderson he wrote for Esquire in 2000): ""A picture without a trace of cynicism that obviously grew out of its director's affection for his characters in particular and for people in general. A rarity."" Bottle Rocket is indeed a rare type of movie: unimprovable casting, impeccable soundtrack (Anderson's first fruitful collaboration with the amazing Mark Mothersbaugh), and the creation of a world that is at once disarmingly peculiar and utterly unique.

And the plot? Well...that may explain why a majority of the movie's first viewers walked out of the theaters. And it certainly explains the typical, and predictable, critical indifference that the film generally received. The plot, such as it is, involves an increasingly outlandish series of escapades, masterminded by Dignan, the ringleader who is all heart and not exactly what one would call a masterful mind. But the plot (as, I would argue, is so often the case with some of our more influential, if unappreciated film and fiction) is mostly a delivery device for the characters.

And, as is the case with all Wes Anderson's films, the characters are a delivery device for the Wes Anderson aesthetic. This sensibility was still fresh and unfettered at this stage, and its propensity for preciousness, while for the most part deftly avoided in Rushmore, is in full effect throughout The Royal Tenenbaums. Bottle Rocket is, to be certain, very much a statement of purpose and a signal of things to come, just as Christopher Nolan's Following--for instance---is replete with images and obsessions that would come to the fore in his brilliant follow-up, Memento.

In the film's opening scene, Anthony (the almost indescribably likeable Luke Wilson) is ending his voluntary stay at a mental hospital, and his doctor admonishes him ""don't try to save everyone."" Enter Dignan, his best friend and imminent partner in crime. Dignan has been convinced (or has convinced himself) that he is helping bust Anthony out, and Anthony willingly plays along. While on the bus ride back home, we see the ""75-Year Plan"" Dignan has drawn up for them---a detailed exercise that is, like its author, at once endearing and exasperating.

Dignan's immediate mission is to prove that crime does pay, and the moment they return, they go to work. Their first heist, a robbery, is a success, albeit a quick one that yields a rather underwhelming bounty. Nevertheless, Anthony is caught up in the excitement, until he realizes that Dignan helped himself to his mother's earrings, which were strictly off limits. And at this point the viewer understands that all they did was ""rob"" Anthony's parents' house. These small-time hoods, it seems, aren't quite equipped to leave their own `hood.

After they recruit their other friend (the impeccably named Bob Mapplethorpe) as a getaway driver---a role he is ideally qualified to perform, as he is the only one of them who owns a car---they knock off the local bookstore. Another success and, in Dignan's romanticized depiction, they are henceforth ""on the run from Johnny Law."" Whether they are exactly wanted men is, at this point, a dubious proposition, but off they go, regardless.

Of course, when they pass a fireworks stand on their way out of town, they immediately pull over to load up on bottle rockets. While this scene obviously gives the movie its title, it also provides its theme: these young men are clearly not ready (or willing) to embrace adulthood, so they engage in what they perceive---from watching too many movies---to be dangerous, authentic activities, yet they can't resist the urge to stop when they see a chance to buy firecrackers. This scene also provides one of the many masterful Andersonian touches that subtly conveys the innocence and absurdity of their adventure. Firing bottle rockets out of a moving car is not exactly the ideal way to avoid detection, just like Dignan's subsequent vision of matching yellow jumpsuits for their penultimate gig is...not quite the signal of an advanced criminal acumen.

Getting back to the issue of plot, it is never much in question that these rascals will fail in their quest to become legitimate thieves, it is only a matter of how spectacularly they will flame out (and for those who have not seen the movie, the denouement is at once appropriately over-the-top and indelible). But the actual payoff is all about the journey, and the somewhat refreshing resolution of lessons not necessarily learned.

Through their experiences, Bob manages to reconnect, however tentatively, with his bullying older brother. Anthony happens to meet the woman of his dreams, in a whirlwind courtship that manages, against all probability, to unfold in a fashion that is convincing and tender. Most significantly, Dignan comes closer to achieving, or at least understanding, his destiny. Or does he? He may not be in a different place by the time the action ends, but the viewer definitely is.

How does this happen? One explanation is that different viewers of this film could come up with any number of different scenes that encapsulate the entire story. And each person, each scene, would be the right one. An example: as they plan the make-or-break heist, while Dignan reviews his painstakingly prepared notes, Anthony completes, with an artistic sort of absentmindedness, a flip book of a figure poll vaulting (which, in its way, is equally painstakingly prepared). Genius in movies lies in the details, and the details in this extremely short scene are immaculate. Dignan with coat and tie, signifying he is in full business mode, albeit with his horrific white athletic socks---the ultimate not-ready-for-primetime oversight. Anthony, listening patiently while Dignan checks off his list, right there by his friend's side, but not entirely there. These few moments crystallize their personalities, and the dynamic of their very genuine friendship, in ways it would take dozens of pages in a very good book to convey.

Later, after the heist has gone predictably, hysterically astray, the cohorts visit Dignan at the state penitentiary, where he has traded in his yellow jumpsuit for a white prisoner's model. A moment follows that hits the trifecta for writing, acting and directing: Dignan pulls out a pile of belt buckles he has handcrafted and offers them around. It turns out the other, absent, accomplices (including Mr. Henry, played by tough-guy extraordinaire James Caan) whom he made buckles for might be partially responsible for landing him in jail, but he shrugs his shoulders and says there are no hard feelings. There has never been a character like Dignan in any movie, before or since.

That this restored high definition transfer is now available amounts to a win/win for fans or would-be first time viewers: anyone not yet convinced can likely pick up an older version of the DVD dirt cheap; repeat customers can treat themselves to an upgrade that truly looks and sounds stellar--an obvious technical improvement on the original.

And then there's the bonus material. The film has commentary provided by Anderson and Owen Wilson; they are both exceedingly soft-spoken and humble about their collective accomplishments, but their insights are, well, insightful. Suffice it to say, Anderson (and/or Wilson) aficionados will want to savor this stuff.

Sample nugget: Owen initially resisted the idea of playing the role he helped write, because he didn't feel he was ""legit""; fortunately for everyone, Anderson was able to convince him otherwise. The bonus disc offers everything from a making-of documentary (including hilarious input from most of the cast, including James Caan), behind-the-scenes photos taken by sister Laura Wilson (this project truly keeps it all in the family!) and, above all, the original 13-minute short film, from 1992, that first lit the fuse.

3556566,5,B001EOQCL2,"""BOTTLE ROCKET"" is most definitely a hilarious but yet an insanely awkward film that just sticks in your head because of how wild and crazy it is.

Released in 1996, the film would be the directorial debut for Wes Anderson (""RUSHMORE"", ""THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS"", ""Life Aquatic with Steve Zizzou"") and the debut of the Wilson brothers: Owen Wilson (Co-writer) and Luke Wilson (plus brother Andrew) and Robert Musgrave who all grew up together in Texas.

Back in 1992, the first initial concept of ""BOTTLE ROCKET"" was shot in 16mm film on B&W after the group was able to raise about $4,000 and raise more money and eventually have the 13 minutes extra to have a short film and submit it to the Sundance Film Festival in 1994.

After being screened for the festival, the film was able to attract a few producers who were willing to invest in making ""BOTTLE ROCKET"" to a full-length film and thus, Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson had their first major opportunity.

As the story goes, the film did terrible in its first test screening which shocked everyone.  The film then had its final released cut which then was released in theaters in 1996 and the film bombed.  In fact, to everyone's surprie, the film couldn't even get screened at Sundance (where the short film version was able to be screened years prior).

But there were many people who loved the film and for critics, it was a critically acclaimed film that some critics were quite passionate about such as  the LA Times (blasting Sundance Film Festival for not screening it) and then followed by director Martin Scorsese calling it one of his favorite films in the 1990's, the film reached cult-status.

Flash forward 12 years later and with three of Wes Anderson's films released on THE CRITERION COLLECTION on DVD, what an awesome way to kick off THE CRITERION COLLECTION's entry to Blu-ray in Dec. 2008 with the release of ""BOTTLE ROCKET"", Anderson's first film.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

THE CRITERION COLLECTION is all about gathering the greatest films around the world and publish them in the highest technical quality but the focus is to present the film the way the original director intended.  For film fans, THE CRITERION COLLECTION is known for its quality and rarely do fans question the releases, the releases are embraced as fans are introduced to important classics or contemporary films.

For ""BOTTLE ROCKET"", the film is presented in its original aspect ration of 1:85:1.  The film's presentation was supervised and approved by Wes Anderson and the Director of Photography Robert Yeoman.  The high definition transfer was scanned on a Spirit 2K Datacine from a 35mm interpositive and thousands of instances of dirt, debris and scratches were removed using the MTI Digital Resotration System and Pixel Farm's PFClean.

The video quality of this film looks great especially for a film created in the early to mid-90's.  Typically films released on Blu-ray during these years have been clean but have this softness effect where the vibrancy of the colors are not as beautiful as I would like it to be.  With ""BOTTLE ROCKET"", the film had many outdoor scenes and literally from the red's to the blues and greens and the yellow jumpsuit that the guys wear, these colors are vibrant in Blu-ray HD.

As for audio, audio was mastered at 24-bit from the original magnetic tracks and audio restoration tools were used to reduce clicks, pops, hiss and crackle.  The film is primarily a dialogue based film, thus a lot of the audio is coming from your front channel speakers.  There are scenes with gunshots and music that come out quite live on your home theater channels but the film is primarily a dialogue-based film.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

For the special features, the following are included:

  * AUDIO COMMENTARY -  A commentary featuring Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson.  The commentary is not more on the filmmaking perspective but more of nostalgia as the guys talk about memories of people they worked with, areas they shot and how some of the people on the crew have moved on to bigger things.
  * THE MAKING OF ""BOTTLE ROCKET"" - A featurette with interviews with Wes Anderson, the Owens brothers, James Caan, Kumar Pallana, the producers and more.  You learn a lot about the behind-the-scenes of the film from creating the short film, Sundance, how the test screening was a bomb, how the film was not a commercial success but became a cult hit and much more.  Great insight on the actors about being part of the job, how they were able to get James Caan for the film and how the producers felt about the talent at the time.  A fun and informative documentary by filmmaker Barry Braverman.
  * The Bottle Rocket Shorts - The actual 13-minute B&W short film that was created back in 1992.
  * Storyboards - Wes Anderson's original storyboards and sketches for the film.
  * Anamorphic Test - Anamorphic test shots of several scenes from the film and how Anderson originally planned to shoot the film in widescreen Panavision.  Test shots.
  * ""The Shafrazi Lectures, No. 1 Bottle Rocket"" - A guy who is reviewing the film and talking about why he loved it.
  * ""Murita Cycles"" - A Short film created Barry Braverman (friend and collaborator for Anderson and the Wilson family) about his father, a Staten Island bicycle shop owner which inspired the guys to create ""BOTTLE ROCKET"".
  * Behind-the-Scenes Photograps by Laura Wilson - The Wilson brothers also had a talented mother who is a photographer that took pictures of Wes, Owen and Luke during the planning stages of the film and also at Sundance.
  * Deleted Scenes - There were a quite a number of scenes that were cut and eleven featured on the disc.  Scenes that would have explained how ""Futureman"" got his name, what Dignan and Applejack were up to when they went to by Bob's place, another scene of how the pot was found in Bob's home and much, much more.

Also included is a booklet that features an appreciation by director Martin Scorsese (which is a tribute that appeared in the March 2000 issue of ESQUIRE Magazine), an essay book by executive producer James L. Brooks (written as an introduction to the ""RUSHMORE"" screenplay published in 1999) which really goes into detail of how ""BOTTLE ROCKET"" was created and things that happened behind-the-scenes not mentioned on the special features  and artwork by Ian Dingman.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""BOTTLE ROCKET"" is just an amazing, awkward and hilarious film.  Forget about the ""Oceans #"" type of films that try to bring comedy to heist films, BOTTLE ROCKET"" was special because it came from these young people who were not known at the time but their vision of filmmaking and storytelling just sticks into your mind.

You know that feeling about pulling a prank that got a lot of laughs during your younger years and you remember it to this day.  This is how I felt about certain scenes from ""BOTTLE ROCKET"".  There were a lot of humor that was not meant to be taken in as a joke but for these characters of Dignan, Anthony and Bob, you can't help but be entertained and laugh.

From memorable scenes of the group putting tape on top of their noses before their heist, to how rob the bookstore but at the same time, those being held hostage just look at them as non-dangerous and almost humorous (despite Dignan carrying a gun).

And then scenes of love as Anthony falls for this woman who can't speak any English and goes where she goes as she cleans each hotel room and just falls in love.  And his far out drawings of his love for Inez.

And also the team assembled by Dignan for their major heist.  One would think, why he would select really old men (especially one who had some major memory loss issues) to bring with him for a major robbery?  But you realize it's Dignan and you just accept his approach to pulling of a heist and enjoy the ride.

There are many of these  moments in the film that you just think back and just be amazed of how much of those type of scenes were included.  Wes Anderson and Owen Williams are just an amazing duo and although at the time, they were not known in the industry, it just showed you how much potential these guys had when they first emerged and eventually they would go on to have successful careers making many more films together.

As for the Blu-ray disc, again, THE CRITERION COLLECTION manages to pull of another wonderful release.  Wonderful picture quality that is vibrant in colors and again, I've reviewed many major films released in the early and mid-90's and although cleaned up, never have the vibrancy or sharpness but this softness that always bugged me.  This was not the case of ""BOTTLE ROCKET"", the film looks great!

And the amount of special features and also the booklet that really help enhance one's appreciation for the film.  You wouldn't expect anything less from CRITERION and sure enough, they delivered.

""BOTTLE ROCKET"" is a fun, hilarious and well-written film that is so different from any film that has come out.  It's not a moronic film, nor is it a serious heist film.  It's just a film that is just all-out fun and one can understand why it has become a popular cult film.

Highly recommended!",1236902400,19,9142,4.717528373266078
3556567,1,B001EOQCL2,"I am a fan of a wide range of movies, including ""cult"" films of many genres. I am biased to think that movies in the criterion collection are usually good to exceptional. In this case I was disappointed. I imagine that there are some who will disagree and see this as a well executed film and as a clever statement for our times (it probably is, but that wasn't enough) but I think that it was just a waste of time to watch.",1233360000,2,424,4.120481927710843
3556568,5,B001EOQCL2,"this has always been a favorite movie of mine, and now the transfer to HD is a welcome sight.  compared to my old dvd, the movie is very crisp looking and the sound is 9/10. the extras aren't great, but I didn't expect much from that side since the movie goes so far back. overall, i recommend this blu-ray disc very highly.  If you love Wes Anderson films then definitely buy this.",1232236800,,382,4.291666666666667
3556569,5,B001EOQCL2,"Finally Bottle Rocket is now on Criterion and Blu-ray simultaneously. The film that introduced Wes Anderson and his clan to the world. The transfer looks absolutely amazing. All the extras are great too, including deleted scenes, and the original short. The best part though is the very relaxed and candid commentary by Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson. The two sit and chat and they are so relaxed with one another you eventually feel you are just sitting there with them watching the film. Several times i wished i could just chime in and add my two cents to the mix. Sometimes I feel filmmakers need a fans perspective to add to the depth these commentaries have. Now with every film getting a commentary many get lost in the mix. Still It was fans who enjoyed such commentaries on laserdisc that made DVDs what they are today.

This disc is also on DVD but for that extra bit of quality the Blu-Ray is worth it. Get a PS3 and this disc and you will be set. Now all we need is a Wes Anderson Blu-Ray collection with all his films. I am sure Rushmore, Tenebaums, Life Aquatic and Darjerling will all look spectacular when they come out.

Thanks Wes, Owen and the people at Criterion.

3556570,5,B001EOQCL2,"Ever since Wes Anderson has been releasing special editions of his films through the Criterion Collection, fans have been hoping that Bottle Rocket would get deluxe treatment. The wait is finally over.

Disc one starts things off with an audio commentary by director/co-writer Wes Anderson and actor/co-writer Owen Wilson. They touch upon which scenes from the original short film survived into the feature. They also point out the re-shoots done after a disastrous test screening. Anderson and Wilson talk about how producer James L. Brooks helped them get Bottle Rocket made and taught them about screenwriting. It's great to hear these two long-time friends talk about their first film.

On disc two there is ""The Making of Bottle Rocket,"" a 25-minute retrospective featurette that brings back key cast and crew members as they reflect on how the film came together and what they think of it now. There is footage from the short film and outtakes from the feature film. One gets the impression that James L. Brooks really mentored Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson. Mainly, it is just great to see everyone from Luke Wilson to Kumar Pallana reminiscing about making this film.

""Storyboards"" is a collection of Anderson's original sketches for specific shots and scenes in the film.

""The Bottle Rocket Short"" was shot in 1992 with only $4,000 on 16mm black and white film stock. Running only 13 minutes, it was shown at the Sundance Film Festival in 1993. Crappy copies have circulated on the Internet for some time and now fans can throw them away as this copy looks great. One can see the core ingredients of what would become feature film.

Also included are a collection of deleted scenes that include the source of Future Man's name but mostly there are several scenes between Anthony, Bob and Dignan. There are some really entertaining and funny bits but one can see why this stuff was cut.

""Murita Cycles"" features friend and collaborator of Wes Anderson and the Wilson family, Barry Braverman and a short documentary that he made about his father, a Staten Island bicycle shop owner that inspired the Bottle Rocket short film.

""The Shafrazi Lectures, No. 1: Bottle Rocket"" is a rather odd featurette with a guy reviewing the film. He compares it to films from the 1950s and talks about his favourite scenes.

""Anamorphic Test,"" Originally, Anderson planned to shoot the film in the widescreen Panavision format and shot a test scene that actually looks really good. It's too bad that they didn't go that way.

Finally, there is a collection of photographs by Laura Wilson, the Wilson brothers' mother. We see Anderson and the Wilsons planning the short film in 1992. There are shots of them at Sundance and also lots of great behind-the-scenes snap shots of them making the feature film.",1229040000,14,2796,4.931914893617021
