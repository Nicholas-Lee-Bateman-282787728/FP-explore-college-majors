7340993,3,B011SDC2B2,"Very quick deliverence! Full contents of this were incorporated into interviews of people knowing MLJ, but There's something suspicious about some interviews - why these guys appeared? could they be judged of experts on MLJ? The most being unsatisfied thing - I actually expect to see several movies taking MLJ's personal actions, but it is all to be appeared in a trailer of this DVD.",1456012800,3,385,4.938461538461539
7340994,5,B011SDC2B2,"Great video resource on MLJ. Contains many interviews with his contemporaries who knew him and were influenced by him deeply. For the rest of us, it is a valuable video insight into his life and work beyond the books that we love so much and been similarly influenced by.",1455321600,,271,4.551020408163265
7340995,5,B011SDC2B2,I thoroughly enjoyed this DVD. Lloyd-Jones made a profound impact on a generation of preachers and continues to influence today through His preaching and writing. This thorough documentary gives a real feel for Jones as a man and a minister.,1450396800,,241,5.05
7340996,5,B011SDC2B2,"There is nothing new under the sun.  Fascinating how Martin Lloyd Jones recognized the problem of the church trying to entertain people into the pews as the failed human marketing idea that it will always be, and unleashed the power of God through simple and fervent preaching of the Gospel. What was true one hundred years ago is true today.",1441670400,9,342,4.7
8724996,5,B011SDC2B2,I have wanted this for a really long time. I am so glad I finally got this because this is so great! I have really enjoyed the entire DVD collection. I love getting to know him more and seeing his passion for Christ was great.,1534291200,,226,4.044444444444444

8724998,5,B011SDC2B2,"Very much attempts to cover the whole of Lloyd-Jones life, his upbringing, his time before conversion, of course him as a long-tenure preacher & most interestingly who he was as a father. While mostly it covers those things many modern day preachers/authors will chime in on his personality and success as a minister. Such as how he was very direct & logical or why he was so successful. I enjoyed the movie and the part that made it all worth it was near the end. I would certainly recommend it.. its good to really put some breathe into the books I read by him",1525219200,,562,4.413461538461538
8724999,5,B011SDC2B2,"I think this is a MUST have for church history buffs, theologians, and pastors. A great snapshot of a man for the glory of God. If you have read his biographies it brings things to life. If you haven't you will enjoy hearing about the life of this great man!",1506384000,,258,4.18
