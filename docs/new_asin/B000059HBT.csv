8317608,1,B000059HBT,"I am an old Amazon customer and this is my first review ever. I was so disappointed that I felt important to share my opinion on this DVD.
The image quality on this DVD is mediocre at best: faded, yellowed and contrastless. Everything looks like 20 year old footage put together on the cheap. The ""Digitally Mastered"" DVD shows scratches and spots you would see on an old movie or a projected 8mm film.
If you think you cannot live without it, get the VHS version, that'll save you a buck.",1062979200,23,489,4.384615384615385
8317609,1,B000059HBT,"The box touts ""Digitally Mastered"", well it's not like you have the choice when converting from an analog video tape to a DVD, because that's obviously what's been done.
They simply put together images from 20 year old footage. The image quality is mediocre at best, faded, yellowed and contrastless. You can actually see black spots and scratches on the image just like you would see on old B&W movies.
This is really a DVD put together on the cheap: the ""Bonus Slideshow does not even work.",1062288000,16,492,4.666666666666667
