2471631,5,B000CRR356,"I have nothing but praise for the show Monty Python's Flying Circus.  It was and is one of the funniest, smartest, surrealist shows ever to be aired on television.  The actors were all phenomenal.  John Cleese, Michael Palin, Graham Chapman, Terry Jones, Eric Idle, and Terry Gilliam providing animations that were astounding.  Terry Gilliam went on to become a very wonderful director of such films as 12 Monkeys, Time Bandits, Brazil, The Fisher King, and of course, the classic Monty Python and the Holy Grail...
Why a Blu-Ray release??  Because it is a show deserving of the proper treatment of a Blu ray release, that's why.  While many of these gentlemen are still with us, new interviews with them could be included.  Those of us who are fans clamor for this kind of stuff.
A few years back, a Blu-Ray release of the UK show The Prisoner was released, and I was one of the people who already owned the DVD edition, yet the BluRay release was excellent enough to make me purchase it and I have not regretted that purchase.  The picture quality on the Blu Ray is leaps and bounds over the DVD release, and the extras are worth the cost of the entire set alone.  I bring this up because The Prisoner was originally aired around the same time as Python.. Python was aired from 1969-1974, and The Prisoner was aired from 1967-1968, even earlier.  But the Prisoner benefits a great deal from the Blu-Ray release, even though it is an old show.  I beg those who have the power to do so to release a Blu-Ray release of Monty Python's Flying Circus.  They will be doing a service to art and culture by making the set available for modern audiences, and for all of us Python fanatics that cannot get enough of this brilliant, wonderful show.",1346025600,,1738,4.570967741935484
2471632,2,B000CRR356,"The best bits of this DVD are an interview with Terry Gilliam, his animated introduction, and several of his favorite Monty Python animations edited together as a single continuous body of work.

Unfortunately, a superimposed border has been added around the perimeter of the animation, drawn to look like you're watching it through a TV set. This is likely to remind viewers with widescreen TVs that Python episodes were shot for square TVs, but it's distracting and appears to slightly crop the animation.

Also, frequent Python viewers will notice the shorts have been edited down. For example, 'House Hunters' is included, but the joke where the house enters the woods followed by a flushing sound is missing.

As a fan of all things Terry Gilliam and animation in general, I had hoped that some of his earlier animated works would be included as extras, but the only worthwhile special feature is the interview.

Since this is the sole collection of Gilliam animation available on DVD (so far, outside of the Python sets), it's worth watching at least once while hoping for an eventual 'Terry Gilliam Animation Collection' with more content and assembled with greater care.",1341273600,,1178,5.0256410256410255
2471633,3,B000CRR356,Bought this for my roommate and he loved it. It isn't very long but it is a nice abbreviated addition to a collection.,1332892800,,118,4.173913043478261
2471634,5,B000CRR356,"First off, Monty Python: those who are fans need no explanation while those who aren't, well, just won't get it.

As for the need for blu-ray edition.  Yes, the originals don't have the quality that blu-ray allows for, but the point is space.  The whole series could fit on much fewer blu-ray disks (maybe even just 1 ?) than the many dvd's it takes up.

That, and I know longer have my dvd collection and rather than re-invest in the dvds again, I'ld rather go blu-ray (with fewer disks).",1300579200,,489,4.46067415730337
2471635,5,B000CRR356,"The rabid ""quality control"" terrier of Monty Python was Terry J., who (according to the other members) cared about, and/or had a creative hand in absolutely everything - including preservation.  There wouldn't be any Python reruns if it hadn't been for Jones, who saved the master tapes from being ""wiped"" by the geniuses at the BBC.  (Just in time, apparently - so you can add ""hero"" to his impressive list of credits, along with writer, director, comedian, historian and satirist.)  Think of THAT, no Flying Circus episodes - and no subsequent movie franchise either, because the popularity of the TV program in the U.S. powered the financing of the feature films.  A life without Python?  The mind boggles...

Here's a collection of Jones' personal best writing and sketch performances, as judged by TJ himself.  Those who may not immediately identify Jones will be able to recall him as the loony nude organ player, the obsessively anal ""Spam"" waitress, or as the rattiest of the many rat-bag ""pepperpot"" housewives that the boys loved to impersonate, (for whatever Freudian reasons.) Many of Jones' favorites were collaborative efforts with Jones' writing partner Michael Palin, and are certified, imperishable classics.  The ""Funniest Joke in the World"", ""Bicycle Repairman"" and the Olympic finals of the Hide and Seek championship are among them, all included. Some other gems, like ""The Bishop"", ""Spanish Inquisition"" and ""Killer Sheep"" appear in part - which is why the complete set of all 45 episodes is absolutely essential.  However, the ""Personal Best"" series is more than worth the price for the hilarious, newly filmed introductions alone.

2471636,2,B000CRR356,"Extremely disappointing! Not only is there a VERY annoying ""faux"" television set illustration surrounding each and EVERY scene on the disc (a phenomena I can find NO logical explanation for), but some (all?) of my ""personal"" favorite bits are no where to be seen. Could Terry really want to leave out the Piranha Bros.? And what about those chaps with the rubber knees!? When I first heard about this disc I thought, ""finally...a collection of this brilliant animation, all together in one place!"" It is not the case. Perhaps some one other than Gilliam, madly brilliant as he is, should take on the task of doing the collection. I was not expecting to be left wanting more. I found my self rather annoyed at the end of the disc, and that is a very big shame.",1258243200,,759,4.588235294117647

2471638,3,B000CRR356,"An earlier post wondered why you needed BD media for a grainy original...that argument is valid, but the main reason why a BD version is needed is that it gives the producers one more shot to do a GOOD release.

2471650,4,B000CRR356,"In 1969, pop culture experienced a sudden earthquake, started by five British goofballs and one American goofball, who created ""Monty Python's Flying Circus.""

And no, that isn't a person. Just so you know.

And ""Monty Python's Flying Circus Disc 1,"" which contains the first three episodes of the series, is a string of bizarre comedic skits skits linked by some gloriously surreal animation, where the insane is everyday. These episodes have a few dud moments, but they also contain some of the Pythons' most hilarious works, including the now-legendary Wink-Wink-Nudge-Nudge sketch.

Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (John Cleese) introduces a special show on great deaths throughout history -- starting with Genghis Khan, and taking a look at the highly-rated deaths throughout history. (""Strewth!"").

That relatively minor skit is just the introduction -- Italian classes for Italians, Whizzo butter, an interview with composer Arthur ""Two Sheds"" Jackson amd Sir Edward (""I don't like being called 'Eddie Baby'!""), a marathon race of famous artists in action, and a lethally funny joke that is taken into military custody for use against the Germans in World War II. (""That's not FUNNY!:

And that's only the first episode.

The two episodes that follow are even funnier -- flying sheep in their various forms, a man with three buttocks, musical mice, working-class playwrights, and men who have a secret double-life as rodents. Then we have an ordinary trial given a series of bizarre witnesses, the heroic BicycleRepairman, a book of obscene children's stories, and a series of tragedies that stem from a man saying that he's been given a dirty fork.

Does it sound insane? Good. These six guys created some of the most unabashed, naughty, nasty, and just plain weird comedy ever, which still influences everything from Saturday Night Live to hit author Jasper Fforde. While the first episode is a bit limp, the ones that follow have some of their most legendary work (""Wink wink, nudge nudge, SAY NO MORE!"") and it only gets better from there on.

And all of this by men who often dress up as the world's most unattractive girls, wearing powdered wigs and cardinal costumes, with only a smallish budget and minimal cast. The 70s production values are omnipresent, and they are decidedly unpolitically correct (""He loved the life of the sea and he loved to hang out down by the pier where the men dressed as ladies...""). But in a weird way, these only make it even funnier than it would have been otherwise -- the writing and acting are pure, raw, unrefined comedy.

Probably the most memorable actors here are Cleese and Idle. Cleese does his psychotic shrieks and ""Engine driver"" song better than anyone, as well as having that rubbery lanky body and howling monkey voice. And Idle not only has amazing comic timing, but he can adjust his voice and body language to... anything, from a fussy sailor to the wink-wink-nudge-nudge man.

But the other actors are quite good too, especially Michael Palin, especially when he's playing someone timid or crazy (""The war wound! THE WOUND!""). And Terry Gilliam created the most bizarre, oddballish little cartoons, including a hippo stomping on frolicking bunnies, flying sheep being shot by cannons, and many other strange things that bridge the various skits together.

This classic comedy series not only became a pop culture staple, but it's still fresh and funny more than thirty years after it was made. A truly surreal, gloriously insane experience.",1212710400,,3497,5.074912891986063

For one thing, the sketches are clumsily edited, and taken out of their original context -- so the ""How To Do It"" sketch pans over to the beginning of a scene involving Michael Palin and Terry Jones as old women -- then abruptly cuts away from it.

Second, several of the skits are from the Hollywood Bowl film, which has a completely different look and feel from the TV series. The transition can be somewhat jarring.

Lastly, some of the skits don't feature Idle at all.

It's nice to see some original material from Idle at the beginning of the disc, but sadly -- it's not all that funny.

Most of the sketches that are on the DVD are very funny indeed, however. Too bad the DVD compilation is just a little uninspired.",1127779200,,875,4.484276729559748
2471680,4,B000CRR356,"I bought this about a year ago,because it is of special intrest. There is an alternate begining to this tape (""Let's start the show with the titles"") thing, which is currently out of syndication, as id  a sketch about a dancing politician and a Gilliam animation with Heath.

There is however some new material. On the DVD version the show fades out and ends with Eric Idle as an announcer ""Black Beu..Bottom..Black Ba (trying to pronounce Black Beauty I guess). In this version it continues with a commercial of all of the outrageuos half hour situation comedies coming to BBC television. If you've ever seen a picture of the Python's in Shakespearian outfits, you know where it came from.

The actual material, is Python, so you know what to expect. By th third season, the quality was slightly waning, but that's just by Python standards. Everything they've ever done (minus Big Red Book), was brilliant, including this.

Memorable sketches from this include a lengthy and recuring Dennis Moore bit, Kamakaze Scotsman, and one of my favorite sketches, the one with the documentars fighting over a microphone live on the air.

Now that the DVD's are out, they have extra's that are mainly clips from other episodes and Hollywood Bowl skits. I recommend the dvd, because they are much easier to find, they are dvd's and they have two extra episodes on them

If you are a major Python person, then you might wanna get this, and check out some websites for where you can get, see and/or hear some deleted or rare python material. ""I know I have"".

2471681,5,B000CRR356,"5 October 1969--History was made when the debut episode of a series that would forever change the face of comedy was aired on BBC1.  The skits of Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle, Terry Jones, and Michael Palin, would bizarre sketches, twisted satire, outrageous jokes, funny dialogue, equally surreal animation, and the destruction of sundry sacred cows.  The bearded bedraggled hermit (Palin) emerging from the sea, gasps that historical first word, ""It's...""
Episode 1-Whither Canada?
One knows things are pretty weird when Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Cleese in a sardonic faux-German accent) hosts the famous deaths, which are rated using Olympic style scores, with Genghis Khan's death being televised.  Some of the dialogue is side-splitting:  ""Yes, mothers.  New improved Whizzo Butter containing 10% more less is absolutely indistinguishable from a dead crab.  Remember, buy Whizzo Butter and go to heaven.""
Interviewers who insult or nitpick at trivialities are seen via Arthur ""Two Sheds"" Jackson (Jones), who wants to discuss his music, only to be repeatedly asked about his nickname and sheds, much to his frustration.
The deadliest joke sketch is an example of an idea gone crazy, taking the concept of the ultimate weapon and Ultima machine and totally turning it on its head.  I mean, if we were to die, wouldn't it better to die laughing at some lethal joke rather than a mushroom cloud?  This idea transforms from a mere skit, to news report, war documentary, to war movie, and back to documentary.  The running joke here are pigs being sat on, eliciting a squeal, followed by someone crossing out a drawing of a pig.
A Python feature that debuts is the presence of a Viking, who completes the last word in a phrase.
Episode 2
Sheep trying to fly like birds and plummeting?  (BAAA!!  Flap-flap-flap THUD!)  That's the opening sketch, with a conversation between a bowler-hatted stockbroker type talking to a local farmer.  I wonder if the lead sheep being named Harold is a slap at Harold Wilson, then prime minister.  The stockbroker's wincing at the sheep thudding is priceless!
The marriage counselor sketch, of a couple undergoing marital strife, is made more hot by Carol Cleveland, who steams up the screen as the sultry wife, described in ""All The Words Vol 1 as ""beautiful [and] buxom..., in the full bloom of her womanhood.""  With her crossed legs beneath striped mini, fluttering eyes, a ravishing smile, it's no wonder the counselor (Idle) does his own advice on her while telling her nerdish accountant-type husband (Palin) to wait outside.
This is the debut of the knight who wields a fried chicken body and whacks perpetrators of horrible overracting or totally pathetic performers.
However, the news documentary-style Mouse Problem sketch, is interesting, given the recent Stonewall riots, and in Britain, where certain acts between consenting adults were decriminalised in 1967 as part of Roy Jenkins's enlightened reforms.  John Cleese is simply great utilizing a shy, slow and pained voice as a ""mouse"" who has come out of the closet, or should that be skirting board?  This is also the debut of a familiar Python motif--the vox pop, the montage of people giving their opinions on a given subject.

Those who have bought boxed sets of Monty Python in stores know that stores sell them with three VHS tapes to a box and that such sets are generally displayed on the shelves with the open side of the box facing out.  So that the customer can easily tell which tapes are contained in the box, each tape is identified by a Volume number.  When you look at the box on the shelf, all you see is the Volume numbers.
The description provided here on Amazon's website indicates that this particular boxed set contains Episodes 20 through 26.  Note carefully that nowhere in the description does it mention what Volume numbers the set contains.
I knew that I had previously bought Volumes 1-15 in stores, but I made the critical mistake of assuming that Episode number was the same as Volume number.  Therefore, I expected that this set would contain material that I didn't already have.
Unfortunately, when I received the set, I was very disappointed to discover that it contains Volumes 10-12, which I do already have.
Therefore, I give this warning to people who have bought boxed sets in stores in the past and are now trying Amazon for the first time.  Make sure you know what you're getting, and be very careful not to assume that Episode numbers are the same as Volume numbers.",1071705600,,1532,4.613970588235294

Well, if you're the first  type, than you must see these videos.  They contain many excellent skits  like 'Ministry of Silly Walks' and 'Seven Brides for Seven Brothers'.  Basically just all around classic Monty Python",951264000,,407,4.690140845070423
2471712,5,B000CRR356,"I've become addicted to Monty Python thanks to A&E's release of Monty Python's Flying Circus on DVD.  The packaging, the design of the menu screen, and the extras are all wonderful.  A&E has filled these sets  full of Spam, Spam, Spam, and Spam.  A person could spend a week watching  all the episodes and the great bonuses such as live performances of the  sketches at the Hollywood Bowl.  These sets are a revelation to anyone who  grew up watching the series and especially to those who have never seen it  before.  Monty Python's Flying Circus will certainly stand the test of time  and A&E deserves a lot of credit for producing these DVDs.  Anything  from Monty Python or Terry Gilliam on DVD is highly recommended viewing.",950400000,,729,4.690476190476191

A&E have to be commended for bringing the Pythons to DVD, but Jeers to them for exploiting us fans, After packaging 3-4 Avengers episodes  per disk it is ridiculous for them to only include 3 Python Episodes per  disk when 6-8 would easily fit.

8101198,5,B000CRR356,"This set of Monty Python TV episodes is particularly silly - it contains episodes 1, 2 and 3 of Season 1 of Monty Python's Flying Circus.

Episode 1 ""Whither Canada"" (and the series) starts with a reference to the running pig gag, then John Cleese as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart narrating the ""Famous Deaths"" sketch. The Italian lesson with Italians and pig gag. Pepper pots being interviewed to see if they can tell the difference between Whizzo butter and... crab. It's the arts where Cleese tortures the composer he's interviewing with his ""you don't mind if I call you..."" schtick. Picasso on a bicycle intro (short), interview with Arthur ""Two Sheds' Jackson, where the only focus is on the nickname, not on what the guy's done. Then the amazing, very long, breathless ""Picasso on a bicycle"" reportage. Amazing. A bit of Gillimation, and then the long skit about the joke that is so funny people die laughing, how it was translated into German and used against the Nazis, and how Hitler tried to translate it back into English and it was un-funny (of course - Germans!).

Episode 2 ""Sex & Violence"" has sheep in trees, a sheep description by two French butchers, pepper pots interviewed on French men, a man with three buttocks, Arthur Ellis and his musical mice, the horny marriage counsellor skit with the large-breasted wife, and the first appearance of the armoured knight with chicken gag. Historic footage of Queen Victoria and Gladstone. Family reunion with a son who's gone off to be an upper class miner, dad's a resentful working class screenwriter (meh). Scotsman on a horse (short). Sneezing nose sheep Gillimation. Religious debate turns to boxing match. Wild west Gillimation, featuring the It's Alive baby, and statues played as pipes. 'The problem of mice"" reportage that seems to be about homophobia. Interview with psychologist, and mention of famous mice - Napoleon, Caesar, interview with mans on the streets.

Episode 3, ""How to recognize different types of trees from quite a long way away"" starts with the ""The larch"" running gag, court appeal and parking citation babbling pepper pot wife testifies, Cardinal Richelieu provides character reference in a groovy French manner, knight and chicken. ""The Larch"" again. A world of Supermens need help from... Bicycle Repair Man! Steamy children's book narration, great Eric Idle sketch. Rabbit Gillimation. Restaurant sketch over dirty plate drama. ""And now the Punchline"" cheezy gag, bookended by beach sketch and knight with chicken gillimation. Milkman and horny housewife trap (clever!). The John Cleese BBC newsreader hostage sketch down to the seaside. ""The Larch"". Interview with school kids on larches. ""Nudge Nudge, Wink Wink"" sketch.

It comes with plenty of bonus materials in its ""Loony Bin"" section - each episode has in its own menu a ""useless tidbit"", which is typically some sort of trivia item; can be ignored. It has the same ""Meet The Chaps"" menu that you'll find in all of the DVDs, each of which includes a video clip, a brief bio, and a list of noteworthy appearances (""Monty Python And The Holy Grail"", ""And Now For Something Completely Different"", etc). There's Graham Chapman doing his military commander rebuking silliness (0:30), Eric Idle doing 0:33 of his ""Nudge nudge, wink wink"" sketch, Terry Jones' Ron Obvious eating an Anglican cathedral bit (0:30), part of John Cleese's ""Dead Parrot"" sketch (0:40), Michael Palin doing a bit of art critic stuff (0:15), and Terry Gilliam in Viking gear moaning ""But that was my only line"" (0:07).

Others are unique - ""Pythonisms"" explains terms like blancmange, camel spotting, cashectomy, gumby, lumberjack, Mr Luxury-Yacht, naughty bits, pepper pot, pythonesque, Semprini, Spiny Norman, splunge, Tripshaw's disease and zalling. ""Gilliam's Attic"" covers clip art - we see stock images of nudes, pig and man and legs, pig with no feet, the blue face man, three blue face men, dancing girl nudes, close-yup bobby, spinning bobby, all very interesting. ""Nudge Nudge, Wink WInk Live"" (2:50) has Eric Idle doing the skit at the Hollywood Bowl. ""Silly Occupations"" collects the barber sketch, the audit board, the burglar/encyclopedia salesman, the management interview. Other repeated stuff as well.",1450051200,,4234,5.157205240174672
