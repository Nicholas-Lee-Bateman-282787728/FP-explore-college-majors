8059993,5,B0009F64D8,"""Dreaming is real magic . . . "" says Moss and in this DVD he sets out to prove it.
Real magic? ""The art of being able to read into another reality and bring gifts back to work in this world."" Listening to Moss on this DVD as well his CD - Wings For the Journey - is out of this world.

Be prepared for an unexpected voyage - a journey to untapped possibilities.
There are very few dream DVD's and dream accompaniment CD's. Moss is a forerunner in the field.

Experiencing nightmares? A great quote from the author - ""a nightmare is an unfinished dream - a dream that scares you so much you don't finish it - you actually run away from it.""

Robert Moss teaches one how to re-enter the dream, to understand the message and if necessary - to resolve conflict.

Yes, ""it's only a dream . . . .""  but if not paid attention to, the effects may not be what you expected. Moss tells us that ""life is not a dress rehearsal, but dreams may be.""
If you have an interest in dream studies and exploring this state of unknown . . . Moss will gladly take you on the journey.  I found the CD a great sleep inducer, soothing and a unique change.

I read his book, ""The Three Only Things"" and it has more dog-eared pages than any I have read in years. That speaks well for the content -  there was so much I wanted to remember and re-address.",1254182400,2,1325,4.108527131782946
8059994,5,B0009F64D8,"I always find it interesting when I suddenly discover people who have been around a while, and they completely bowl me over. I like Moss' work so much, I even have extra ""loaner"" copies to lend to others.

He is a powerful, intelligent, articulate speaker/storyteller who knows his subject very well indeed. There are some very powerful experiences to be had just watching this set of videos.

This DVD set is 3 DVDs, each holding 2 or 3 video interviews with Moss, and each focusing on particular uses of dreaming.

The first disc has two programs - an introduction where Moss describes his own history and introduction to dreamwork. The second program is an introduction to the way he teaches dreamwork to others, called Active Dreaming.

Disc 2 has three programs - the first two deal in more depth with Lightning Dreamwork, Dream Re-entry and Tracking - techniques he teaches for learning to use dreams in our daily lives. The third program is about Dreaming the Future.

Disc three has three programs discussing dreaming with the Departed, Spiritual Guides, and Healing.

There are also some drawings and animations, as well as video of a group dream workshop and an interview with Wanda Burch, who describes her use of dreams to help heal from cancer.

I have spent decades studying various metaphysical systems, including various flavors of astral travel and Tibetan Dream Yoga. Most of these other systems can become quite complex, requiring one to learn pantheons of saints, angels, demons, symbols, worlds, etc. Some of the practices are quite difficult and complex as well, making success more difficult. The shamanic dream practices Moss teaches are far easier while remaining quite powerful.

What Moss does is to re-acquaint us with the ancient techniques of shamanic dream work which ""modern"" societies have long forgotten. The world of dreams and how to work with them has been central to many societies for untold ages, but has been denied to masses of modern society for some time, sometimes quite forcefully (and not in our best interests, either).

Dreams can help us accomplish many things in life, and Moss can teach you how to learn to use them. These techniques can help us recover the freedom and power of our own soul, and release us from the bonds of centuries of insanity, stupidity, and denial of our place in Nature and the Universe. Heady stuff, and quite necessary today.

I recommend this DVD set to any who are seeking to discover their true nature, heal their lives, or awaken to their true spiritual purpose. His books are also great, and filled with tons of information about various dreaming cultures (his story about Harriet Tubman alone was worth watching this set).

I would also recommend his books (not a complete list):

Conscious Dreaming

The Three ""Only"" Things

Dreamways of the Iroquois

Dreaming True

Dreamgates

8059995,5,B0009F64D8,"I wish I'd known about Robt Moss/dreaming decades ago.  The importance of our dreams -- acknowledging them, honoring them, recording them and going onto higher/deeper levels is important to each of us as well as the collective whole & our planet's future.  Reclaiming this essential ability which has become atrophied for much of our 'civilized' society is not only important -- it also helps us to have better, fuller, more creative lives and reclaim what we are missing in our lives.

Someone once said that life is a banquet and most people are under the table picking at the crumbs.  This DVD set (and Robert Moss's books) can jump start you into the power of your dreams & what information/gifts you can mine from them, as well as healing (self & others) & much more.  Isn't it time to get out from under the table & partake of the banquet over your head?  Thanks to this DVD set I've started towards my lost dreams.",1140220800,7,921,4.585365853658536
8059996,5,B0009F64D8,"I recently viewed(and reviewed several times) The Way of the Dreamer by Robert Moss  in DVD format. I have read all his books and listened to one of his audio cassettes series as well. As a dreamer who has been recording her dreams for over 20 years, the DVD felt so supportive to my work with dreams. I know very few people who even try to remember their dreams, so to have 8 programs about various aspects of dreaming feels like a rare and beautiful gift, each time I watch. I have been a hospice nurse, and the segments on death resonated with everything I have felt in working with the dying, and yet so much more. I wish I could have viewed the DVD when I was struggling with helping people die well. I would recommend this DVD series to anyone who wants to feel more connected to their dreams, and their inner life.

8059997,5,B0009F64D8,"THE WAY OF THE DREAMER is yet another treasure presented to the

dreaming world by author and dream expert Robert Moss. This inspiring series of video tapes is a synthesis of ancient dream wisdom and Robert's own vast knowledge and experience, his eloquent words woven beautifully with music and images, examples and practical techniques for becoming active dreamers in a utopian dreaming society.

Those who believe that dreaming is a passive experience will soon change their minds if they practice what Robert teaches. Far from something that happens TO us, Robert shows that dreaming is an experiential art, a supreme science of soul which can illuminate all of our actions every day by providing natural access to deeper knowledge and greater awareness of the symbolic resonance of waking life.

Vital to his work is treating dreamspace as sacred space and dreams as actual places which can be revisited and reentered, alone or in a group. Recalling, recording dreams, and finding psychological meaning as do many dreamworkers are good practices to adopt, but Robert proves that the real value of our nightly gifts can only be fully realized when we unwrap them and put them to use at every level of our existence, including those which are unseen or unacknowledged in our current culture. As the exceptional teacher he is,  Robert makes complex concepts such as super string theory and alternate realities easy to understand and exciting to visit. Foresee the future and  possible outcomes, visit the departed or prepare for the after-life, receive creative inspiration and divine guidance...Robert maps out these areas and more having explored the territories in his own dreaming and shamanic counseling.

 Most importantly, if distilled to its essence, dreaming is all about soul, then the concept of loss of vital energy, of soul, which is at the root of illness and many other life problems, can be addressed through active dreamwork. Finding where that energy has gone and bringing it back seems a difficult task, but it is rendered easier using Lightning Dreamwork, a breakthrough technique perfected by Robert. Through the guidance provided in this series of videos, using dreams as navigational tools, we can travel to a night school of higher education where we learn to become soul healers for ourselves and others. Lead on, Robert!

8059998,5,B0009F64D8,"Robert Moss is an expert on dreaming: vastly experienced on a personal level, he is also extremely well-read and able to explain the more esoteric aspects of dreaming in terms which the average Western rationalist will be able to accept. Those of us who, for example, struggle with the idea of life after death or communing with the dead, will find they are able to keep an open mind by considering that everything we dream may have several levels of meaning on a symbolic level. Dreaming the future, healing, messages from the departed: concepts we may have doubted as `supernatural' can, in this context, be deeply meaningful and not simply `magical'. We know our unconscious holds a wealth of mystery; even, perhaps, the answers to everything we want to know, if only we could access the information: Robert proposes a simple route to self-discovery.

Skilled at drawing together the various world traditions of religion and dreaming, Robert shows that the essential core and truths are the same world-wide. In a manner reminiscent of Joseph Campbell, he brings together ancient mystical practices with modern science, showing that all these paths seem to lead towards the same universal wisdom.

Robert is a charismatic and articulate teacher who speaks authentically. His advice is presented simply, free of dogma but with sensible guidelines for safe journeying into the dreamspace. There is no sense in which Robert presents himself as a guru: he insists that the dreamer must be at the centre of the experience, that they are the only expert on their own dreams, and must be honoured throughout the process. His joy in dreaming is infectious, and his confidence reassuring. He simply offers his own route to an enriched experience of life; he also provides historical evidence of the power of dreams, from Harriet Tubman to William Stead. His recommendations for specific dream practice are clarified by showing a group of experienced dream sharers using the process.

I recommend these DVDs to anyone who wishes to further their understanding and experience of dreaming, whether new to it or not: few of us are so adept that we have nothing to learn from someone who is self-evidently a master.",1114560000,15,2203,5.03013698630137
