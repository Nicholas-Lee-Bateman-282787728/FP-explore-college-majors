5062709,2,B0077PTWAK,"I thought this movie did okay, but didn't really like the ending as much. So, I would say 2 stars.

The general story is pretty good and I like it, but I didn't like the actual fighting. I was actually more interested in the 3-way love triangle there was in the movie than the training and fighting in the movie.

The training the fighters did was interesting, but the actual matches they fought didn't impress me. And, the very last match the main star fought really wasn't that great and kind of puzzling. The movie felt kind of rushed at the end because the fighters were talking about there won't be a 3rd round and to me meant they didn't have enough time or money to have the movie to go any longer. So at the end, the hero and the main rival fought each other and traded blows and it looked pretty even to me. Then, they stopped and suddenly the rival fell down and couldn't. What? Really? Why? It didn't seem enough like the hero actually did more damage than the rival, so I don't know what happened there, but run out of time and end the movie already feeling.

This movie tried to be different by approaching a martial match by NOT doing amazing finishing moves. They explained in the movie that with this style of fighting there isn't a big finishing move. So, what that means is they have to fight with endurance and experience. This is probably why I didn't like the movie as much. I like seeing flashing moves in movies. That's why I watch it! I know in real life, there's not much flashy moves and it's all about endurance and experiences, but in a movie...it's not supposed to be like that. I believe movies are where people can take a reality situation and make it seem more than it is. I.E. Flashy big moves!

So, after watching the last fight, immediately afterwards, the congratulation scene came up and that was less than 30 seconds and here come the credits. The end!

The ending was so week. I really hate movies that cannot finish a good movie. This movie wasn't even good for the whole time and with that ending, they really screwed themselves. They could had done so much better, but they chose to just end the movie fast. I would had give it a better rating but the ending really kill themselves.",1351641600,,2224,4.401459854014599
5062710,3,B0077PTWAK,"The reason this isn't going to be a very long review is because I have, essentially, seen this movie many times before. ""Fight the Fight"" is a decently-made but ultimately uninventive modern martial arts drama that recycles any number of plot devices and storyline clich&eacute;s in uninteresting fashion, making for a movie that you can't really complain about but can't laud either. Its cast is interesting enough but both the screenplay and the fight scenes are just waiting to be overlooked and forgotten in the history of kung fu cinema.

The story: a young kung fu practitioner (Sammy Hung,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Battle-of-the-Warriors/dp/B002C6VMIY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Battle of the Warriors</a>) bets the school of his father (also his real-life dad Sammo,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ip-Man-2-Legend-of-the-Grandmaster/dp/B004I1AGTC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ip Man 2: Legend of the Grandmaster</a>) against a corporate fighting team in martial competition to prove the strength of his family's kung fu.

The original title of the film is ""Choy Lee Fut: the Speed of Light."" While the title is apt for the fact that choy lee fut is the exploited fighting style of this film, the renaming doesn't detract from the film since it's treated very superficially: the opening and closing titles provide some background and history of the art, but the movie offers next to no insight of its philosophy or even points out how it differs from other styles (though it does feel confident enough to more or less state that it's better than karate). The film builds up to a series of three matches to determine the school's fate, along the way diving into a boring love triangle tangent, and during this time, most of the characters develop little personality, to the point that I didn't even care who won or lost in the end.

Along with Sammo Hung, fellow Hong Kong cinema icon Yuen Wah (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kung-Fu-Hustle/dp/B0009S4IHY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kung Fu Hustle</a>) is present, though their roles are largely non-fighting and play to their senior status; it was probably an easy shoot for them. Mostly it's a Gen-X cast at the forefront, featuring Kane Kosugi (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/D-O-A-Dead-or-Alive/dp/B000I0RNXY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">D.O.A.: Dead or Alive</a>) and Dennis To (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Legend-Is-Born-Ip-Man/dp/B005NQ5LQ4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Legend Is Born: Ip Man</a>), and like I said before, none of them really have much of a personality in the film. This carries over to the fight scenes: wrangled by Sam Wong (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Supercop/dp/B004SUDQAY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Supercop</a>), they peak at times with nice moves, athleticism, and minimal wire-fu (particularly during the fight between Kosugi and gweilo Ian Powers) but nonetheless end up all looking the same thanks to flawed rhythm, too much cutting, and an icky habit of slow-motioning reaction shots.

There are a few interesting moments in the film, like when it adopts psychedelic CGI backgrounds for some flashback scenes and the training montage alluding to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rocky-IV/dp/B0006GAOGI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rocky IV</a>. Personally, I like seeing Kane Kosugi perform in general, so his costarring role here was really appreciated. Regardless, the movie really doesn't try for much, with the result that I'll probably forget about it in a fortnight. I can't really justify giving it a lower rating since it's very smoothly produced for its budget, but I can't recommend this to anybody short of die-hard fans of anyone involved.",1344297600,5,3940,6.400375939849624

8512083,1,B0077PTWAK,This movie contains very poorly choreographed fight sequences and deeply disappoints. Stay away at all costs unless you're into the crap called Mixed Martial Arts.,1395187200,,163,5.56

8512085,4,B0077PTWAK,"I thought this was a good movie with some okay fight scenes and good humor in parts.  I thought Sammy Hung (Sammo's son) did a good acting job, seemed natural and genuine.",1366588800,,171,4.34375
8512086,2,B0077PTWAK,"This film is awful.  The trailer looks pretty epic, but that's about as epic as the film gets.  Otherwise you have to sit through awkward and tedious (and incredibly badly done) scenes in ""Thames, England"" and utterly boring and awful love interest nonsense in China.  There's more yapping and longing looks in this film than there are any good fight scenes.  Sammo Hung phoned this one in at best.  Really disappointing.  Horrible story, horrible acting, uninspired martial arts.",1361404800,2,480,5.089743589743589
