7346887,5,B012C89VGQ,"These two ""movies"" get you from the end of Borders 1 & 2 to the first movie.  The Borders series is a prequel for how the Major met Aramaki and assembled the team. She and Batou don't get along until number 4 and then, if you've seen the movies and Solid State Society, you know the rest.",1445990400,2,288,4.052631578947368

7346889,3,B012C89VGQ,"this is a review of the anime's packaging only  (i would rate the series itself a 4/5)

i'm not going to lie, funimation really cheaped out again on the packaging for this release of GITS:arise, the box that holds the two blu-ray cases is just a really flimsy cardboard box that can vary easily be damaged and i as a anime collector find this vary frustrating, what stopped funimation from giving this release a chipboard box? this is ghost in the shell we are talking about! literally every other GITS series got really high quality packaging so why didn't Arise get the same treatment? at this point i'm hoping funimation releases a GITS:arise complete collection that has way better packaging.........",1445472000,,704,4.858333333333333
7346890,5,B012C89VGQ,"Ghost in the shell arise is an amazing series that reboots one of the most popular anime ever made. At first to be honest I thought the series felt way too different than what we're used to getting with ghost in the shell, but after sticking with the series and watching all the ovas. I honestly feel that this is my favorite rendition. Everything is fresh and new, but still has the nostalgic flare of classic cyberpunk. Two thumbs up for Arise.",1445385600,,446,4.451219512195122
7346891,5,B012C89VGQ,"Awesome. Period. There is almost nothing else to be said in my opinion. I absolutely loved this ""prequel"" OVA series to the ETERNALLY AMAZING, GITS franchise. Including the English cast, who knocked it out of the park at every turn. Yeah, there was a part of me that wished like hell the original cast had been gathered to reprise their roles (especially since Mary Elizabeth McGlynn was cast in a different role - it was nice that they brought her back for the ""reboot"" but why she wouldn't have been first choice for Motoko is still weird to me) but at the end of the day, everyone remained exceedingly true to the characters many of us have loved for years.

I'm happy with it's pricing and didn't mind the separation of release between parts 1 & 2, and 3 & 4. But honestly, for this I'd have paid twice as much to add it to my collection. It's impossible to own too much Ghost in the Shell in my opinion - and this was no exception. Personally I'm not creative enough to generate more of this story line but I hope they continue crating new GITS ""adventures"", whether part of this version of the mythos, or part of the original series / seasons and movies. I can't imagine a world where creating too much GITS would be an issue.

Definitely worth the addition to one's collection.",1445299200,7,1284,4.436440677966102
7346892,5,B012C89VGQ,"Art work is great; Love the dual media, DVD and BR....system cannot play BR so the DVD allows play until I get a real HD setup.  I did see the Major's life being radically changed to allow her to build the team for section 9 for this new version of GITS shows.  Most of the original characters' personalities and appearance are similar to the pilot.  These movies are more ""PG13"" rated than the pilot release GITS movie with real nudity; here she's ""nude"" in a few scenes BUT no details to make it ""R"" rated so don't expect any fan-service.  My impression is our Major's cloths are more conservative,  her bust appears a few inches smaller and I believe she's also shorter/more girlish appearance [I included 3 pics: Old crew, boarders crew, and original Major: viewing those TV shows she is larger/more femine...of course with a full prosthetic body she can be any size she wants];  here expect more complex plots with entertaining twists and many new enemies to vanquish with new victims to rescue.  As expected this is an open series; #4 ends only with the terrorist's search continuing; I hope for a conclusion with Arise 5,6 and hope we'll not see Arise 49,50 dragged on, on, on and out.  This series is the ground floor/beginning of a new slant on GITS and not a Star Wars type release of Ep. 1,2,3 with those blending seamlessly into old Ep. 4,5,6.  A good buy for a ""New Beginning"" of GITS.",1445126400,7,1398,4.56
7346893,4,B012C89VGQ,"I've watched episode 1&2 in Japanese with subtitles previously at a local convention, and just now watched the whole four part/border series in English today. I guess you can watch just these two episodes, but I would advise against watching this without also buying and viewing borders 1&2. I was pleased to see that despite having been labeled as Blu-Ray, all four episodes (1&2 bought earlier this year and left unopened until today) came with what appears to be a DVD version of each episode, a notable bonus.

Looking at all four episodes in this review, the series appears to be an entirely new continuity from every other Ghost In The Shell production, which may bug some viewers. If you love everything Ghost In The Shell however, and don't mind keeping track of this as it's own self contained dimension from the movies and etc, then it has some great storytelling and moments. In some ways it's better, though mostly the same as previous iterations of the story. The only episode I found lacking is the fourth, particularly where it tries to tie in some events of previous episodes, which otherwise could have just remained fascinating unrelated on-off events. I feel they should have axed tying those episodes together into this one, and focused on the unique storytelling of the fourth, which I did find interesting. The tie ins are characteristic of all GitS stuff however, so can I really blame it for following through as usual? Perhaps if I actually understood and fully comprehended how everything pieced together, then I wouldn't have found the last episode lacking.",1444867200,16,1584,4.91044776119403

7346904,5,B012C89VGQ,"Similar to my review of 1 & 2. I enjoyed this prequel story. The new character artwork and voice acting was refreshing but it was a slow start with a vague plot. Episodes 3 & 4 (this one) are much more familiar to a Stand Alone Complex fan with hard-hitting bang-em-up action and intense cyber warfare. I don't expect a non-fan to buy this show. It probably doesn't make any sense unless you've seen the movies and previous series. Despite being a prequel. Character development is nonexistent here, that's a clear flaw (which I did not take a star off for, because I feel they made this for fans, not trying to capture a new audience).

SAC episodes were 20 minutes long each so the two 1-hour episodes here are equivalent to 6 in the old series. That's good. It's more than it seems.",1490486400,3,785,4.451388888888889

7346918,5,B012C89VGQ,"As a long time fan of Ghost in the Shell, I was thoroughly overjoyed when they announced Arise. Like many others, I was a bit unsure of Motoko's new look, but after sitting through the Arise Border movies and being capped off with The New Movie, I have to say I've really come to enjoy her new look --- in some regards, even more so than her Stand Alone Complex / 2nd Gig look!

The story of each Border is fantastic, insightful, complicated without being overly confusing, and entertaining. The quality of the animation is top notch, and these contain quite a bit more action than the original animated series do. I've now watched them a number of time and enjoy them as much as I do 2nd Gig, which is my overall favorite entry in the GITS Franchise.

Liked ARISE so much I actually own many ARISE PVC Figures of Motoko Kusangi!",1472169600,5,829,4.411764705882353

7346938,4,B012C89VGQ,"Ghost in the Shell Arise Ghost Tears.  Well what can I say ... they've improved the background drawings a hundred-fold compared to release 1&2.  Opening scene (at the dam) where Mizuki is walking down the stream bed: the light reflecting off the mossy wet boulders/rocks, trees and leaves - wow!!  Throughout the movie - use of lighting/reflections are well done.  Even in the alley where the Tachicoma proudly proclaims ""I caught one"" (of the terrorist) to Borma - the walls looks well drawn and dimly lighted  (much better then the alley scene portrayed in the previous episode).
Ok so now for the bad - they're still not drawing (all) faces very well (compared to the original movie) and maybe it is a concession to cut time and cost ... so yeah ... you get what you get.
Story is new - not a rehash - so that's good.  Although there is a discrepancy: if Motoko's legs are Ariel ... why didn't they blow up??  (Akira said ...""your Ariel will activate ... even I can't stop it"").",1453075200,2,981,4.5397727272727275

Keep in mind that this is only an interpretation of the series, and subtly conflicts with a great deal of other materials produced under the ghost in the shell name.  Thankfully this conflict is very mild, and the ""Arise"" story itself is a true work of art, crafted faithfully in the spirit of the original.

Fanatic, Die Hard fans will notice the differences, I however find it a worthy tribute to what is undoubtedly the finest example of trans-humanist fiction of all time.
