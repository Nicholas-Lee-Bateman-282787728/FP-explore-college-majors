He got in to the lumber business, it took off and he became a millionaire, so he had time to coach the kids that are the subject of this documentary. He did a great job with them and I wish him well with this. I would recommend it, though, even if I didn't know him.",1357862400,,415,4.073170731707317

Yes it is a film about football but that is really just the basis for the film. The real story is about two completely different life styles and cultures coming together and out of conflict comes mutual respect, trust, honor and love. If this movie doesnt make you leak a tear or two then nothing will. Coach Bill is a man who is blessed and lives the code of ""pay it forward"", the  type of person this world needs alot more of.",1357776000,7,534,4.184466019417476
5372589,5,B009YQJ2Q4,"""Undefeated"" (110 min.) brings the story of the North Memphis Manassas High School football team's 2009 season. The football team's history is one of losing, losing, losing, until a few years before that a volunteer coach named Bill Courtney steps up and coaches and wills these young men, all of them underprivileged from this inner-city part of Memphis, to greater things. ""Coach Bill"", as he is referred to by his players, tries to instill discipline, character, and the ""team first"" concept to them, and what a struggle it is.

The title of this documentary is quite curious, as the team does NOT go undefeated, nor do these young men go undefeated through life. The movie focuses primarily on three of the team's players, including a young man who returns to school as a junior after having served a 15 month jail sentence as a juvenile (it is never made clear what he did to deserve that sentence). Another of those kids the movie focuses on gets injured early into the season and we see him struggle, having lost a sense of belonging (as he is no longer part of the team) but trying to get back into shape in time for the play-offs. There are many incredible moments in this movie that I won't spoil here, but suffice it to say that I welled up on more than one occasion. Special mention to ""Coach Bill"", who does an incredible job, at the sacrifice of his own family (he has a wife and 4 young kids). Be sure to watch the end credits, as the film makers reveal what became of the pirncipals in this movie after that 2009 season.

""Undefeated"" won this year's Oscar for ""Best Documentary"" and it's easy to see why. Yes, this is a movie about high school football (and if you love HS football, as do I being in Cincinnati, with such a rich local tradition in HS football), but this movie is about so much more. Going into the theatre some months ago, I had a general sense (or so I thought) about this movie, but I was surprised, elated and yes, moved to tears.

5372602,5,B009YQJ2Q4,"Undefeated (2011) chronicles the development of an inner-city Memphis football program, the Manassas Tigers, and the struggles involved with building character, commitment, and selflessness among the young men involved in the program. The documentary follows the 2009 season of Tigers, a turning point year for the habitually unsuccessful program thanks to the work and dedication of coach Bill Courtney. Courtney agreed to join the program in 2004 and worked tirelessly to change the culture of the program and the young men in it. By getting the players to buy-in to the team mentality and building the character and perseverance of the team as a whole, the Tigers 2009 season win-loss mark of 9-1 becomes one of the most successful and most memorable in Manassas long history. Courtney used football as a medium to make the inner-city boys into well-rounded young men with character. Courtneys purpose was greater than football; it was using football to keep the kids off the streets and instill in them the skills and attitudes needed to be successful in life after football and school. Its easy to see in the profound impact Bill Courtney had on the lives and futures of the Tigers football team in the film.  I would recommend this film to anyone aspiring to be an educator or coach. Bill Courtney embodies what it takes to reach your students or players by giving them something they can believe in.",1444608000,,1406,4.9576271186440675

5372618,5,B009YQJ2Q4,"This documentary is about a school located in North Memphis. Known as the home of the Tigers, Manassas High School had been fighting for the football playoff championship title since the very beginning in 1899. Later on the team received high hopes when a man named Bill Courtney took on the role as the high school football coach in 2004. He took on the challenge of helping a team filled with under privileged kids who lost all spirits, and change their views entirely. Most of these boys on the team come from negative backgrounds whether they lost their fathers, were in and out of jail for various reasons, or they simply were not preforming well in school. Bill Courtney, losing his father at a very young age was able to relate to the players, and was successful in creating a safe and carrying environment for everyone on the team. He was able to challenge these kids in a way that made them respect, honor, and care for him and their relationships with one another helped mold their lives from negative to positive.

The documentary highlights how one coach Bill Courtney was able to turn Manassas football team around and leading them into the playoffs. Bill was able to be an inspiration to the kids by becoming their father figure and guiding them along the way for six and a half years. I find that this Bills approach to teaching/guiding the players on the team extremely positive. Although for teachers I do not think it is possible to have the same kind of a relationship, but it is good to strive for. I would recommend this touching documentary to almost everybody.",1427846400,,1583,4.6535714285714285
5372619,4,B009YQJ2Q4,"Since its founding in 1899, Manassas High School in North Memphis has never had a football team win a playoff game. In 2004, former high-school coach Bill Courtney offers to help turn the Manassas Tigers around. The movie makes light that these are very poor black teenagers that have little to nothing going for them, they cant get good grades, they are in an out of jail, and most of them are without father figures or any parenting at all. When asked how many of their parents have attended college not one of the young men could raise their hands but when it came to parents that have either left or had some sort of criminal record their hands flew up. Realizing the potential of the majority of the athletes and believing that a large majority of them could turn their lives around Coach Courtney doesnt hesitate to make these young men the best that they can be. This movies main focus however is Coach Courtney and his amazing turn around of Manassas football. Courtney takes his job as their football coach to heart and becomes the father figure that most of these young men have been searching for their whole lives. I would highly recommend this movie especially being a teacher that wants to work in an inner city school, it has tons of great insight on how bad some schools can be and remind us that it isn't always going to be easy but in the end it will be worth it.",1427760000,,1381,4.440944881889764

A great story about football, one that we seldom see from the cameras of ESPN and Fox Sports.  Although it might sound typical, the white coach motivation the black kids in the team,  it is quite a nice story to watch. From the coachs accent, to the various up and
downs that a football season has, it is a story full of emotion and spirit.
It also shows the relationship between football and life in a small town in the south, the sport being the only way out for the poor black kids. It gives the opportunity to dream and
maybe be like the white folk!
A very interesting documentary both on social and sports levels",1394668800,,664,4.346774193548387

5372650,5,B009YQJ2Q4,"I'm a Memphis native, but I've lived in Southern California for the last 45 years. I initially decided to see this movie because I attended one of the other eight segregated all black high schools in that city in the early to mid 1960s. I also thought that it was possible that I might catch a glimpse of the church I attended there in the 1960s, before leaving Memphis to attend college in Alabama. Manassas High School was located across the street from the church I attended as a youth. I wasn't disappointed.

Let me say first that football is the secondary theme of this film. The humanitarian theme absolutely trumps the football element. Having said that, this documentary was very powerful. On my next visit to Memphis, I'd like to meet the coach of the team, Bill Courtney, and to shake his hand, but preferably to give him a very big hug for a selflessness, love and compassion that I have rarely ever seen. It is a story of this very talented white coach who neglected his own business and even his own family to help black inner city youth to make the most of their lives. Your heart will be deeply touched. Guaranteed!!! No wonder it won an Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature.

Now, back to catching a glimpse of the church I attended in the 1960s. I was utterly surprised that a portion of the film was shot inside of the building that was once the main sanctuary of that church. My father's funeral was held in that sanctuary in 1993. In one scene, I also caught a glimpse of my father's picture that was displayed on the wall as one of the founding members of the church. This is one reason I was prompted to purchase the movie after having initially rented the movie from Red Box. But, even in the absence of such a sentimental attachment, this documentary is worth owning.",1392681600,3,1798,4.495412844036697

5372652,4,B009YQJ2Q4,"The poor blacks get help from a well meaning white man, but it benefits them all as they share the challenge of piecing together a winning football season. It would be great to say that after they pull together and meet the challenge the players go on to college and successful lives. It would be great. Of course, this movie is not how football changed someone's future life. This movie is about young men who love playing football for their coach. It's a good story.",1391385600,,468,4.517647058823529

Still, this is one of the movies I will play over and again in my home.

As a mother of two 14 year old boys, I love the determination and perseverance depicted in this real life and highly inspirational movie.  I found this useful to teach against the ""entitlement attitude"" that is so pervasive today.

However before I knew it I was so caught up in what I soon realized was a documentary and (thankfully) not a reality show, I couldn't have shut it off if I wanted to.

I really am not a sports person and do not care about football whatsoever. Still this was one of the best things I've ever watched. They really did a stellar job making this not too sentimental but not to sort of clinical either. Many documentaries you either don't feel anything watching them or you feel as if the subject matter is being shoved down your throat. With this film I was totally invested in these people's lives. You find yourself cheering their victories and crying along with their pain.

I now this probably sounds really cliche but it's true. This film has a ton of heart without being overly sappy. It gave me reason to believe that their are actually still good people out there in the world trying to make it a better place.

It would have been so awesome if the film ended the way (not to ruin it for you) you were hoping it to end, but being that it is non-fiction, God authored it the way he saw fit.

Never has there been a better real-life (non-fictional) film that showcases all of these aspects.

The coach Bill Courtney says at the beginning of the film that football does not build character but reveals it. I don't know if I agreed with this statement a 100% or not. But after thinking about it, I realized that he was right. There can be a teammate who doesn't care about anyone but himself, but football itself will not make him a better person or more selfish one. Football will, however, make him reveal his true self -- a self that has already been implanted within him from early on whether he knew it or not. This is best shown in this film when teammate Chavis Daniels (who is difficult and angry through most of the season) steps up to recognize another teammate Montrail ""Money"" Brown (who he doesn't get along with), who is having a difficult time. It is a philosophical question to pose on whether Chavis would have had the empathy to stand up for Brown or not if he was not on the football team. However, the question is almost an answer to itself in that Chavis could have always been empathetic but it took football (and/or the coach) to bring it out of him. This is a GREAT film that I cannot recommend enough! It should be watched by anyone who loves football or even those who also don't care much about the sport. Simply a wonderful documentary!",1365120000,,3504,7.286052009456265
5372722,4,B009YQJ2Q4,"In 2011, filmmakers Daniel Lindsay (""Last Cup: Road to the World Series of Beer Pong"") and T.J. Martin (""Last Cup: Road to the World Series of Beer Pong, ""On the Rocks"") was intrigued with a newspaper article about a high school football player named O.C. Brown with football talent being helped by his coaches in order to get his grades up, so he can attend college.

But what they learned is that the team that O.C. Brown had played in had a much greater story to tell and thus the documentary ""Undefeated"" was born.

Shot with a low budget, featuring two filmmakers and their producer Rich Middlemas (of Tennessee) with two camcorders, no lighting and each sharing an apartment, the filmmakers shot an entire year at Manassas High School, edited the film for another year and their documentary was complete.  The crew screened the film at South by Southwest and after its first two showings, a bidding war between movie studios took place and ""Undefeated"" would eventually lead to the film receiving critical acclaim nationwide and winning an Academy Award for ""Best Documentary"".  In Feb. 2013, ""Undefeated"" was released on Blu-ray and DVD courtesy of Anchor Bay Entertainment.

VIDEO:

""Undefeated"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:78:1 aspect ratio).  It's important to note that documentaries are typically not big budget films.  They are shot digitally but for many documentaries, shot with a DSLR or shot with equipment that is not the best but yet gets the job done.  And for ""Undefeated"", the filmmakers get the job done with what they had for their budget.

Where the film shines is its closeup and the amount of detail that can be seen on the players faces.  Colors are good and black levels are good.  But for the most part, this documentary does look good on Blu-ray.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Undefeated"" is presented in Englis 5.1 DS-HD MA.  Like most documentaries, they typically are not created to utilize all surround channels.  But the film features dialogue that is can be heard clearly, while some people may be hard to understand but English subtitles are presented.  But for a documentary like ""Undefeated"", lossless audio is appropriate.

Subtitles are in English SDH and Spanish.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Undefeated"" come with the following special features:

  Audio Commentary - Filmmakers Daniel Lindsay and T.J. Martin discuss the making of ""Undefeated"" and what they wanted to accomplish with the film during production and post-production.
  Deleted Scenes - A total of six deleted scenes.
  Black and White Teaser Trailer - (1:42)
  Making Of - Filmmakers Daniel Lindsay and T.J. Martin discuss the film's origins and their reaction to winning an Academy Award.

JUDGMENT CALL:

An inspirational film about a Coach who sacrifices time with his family and volunteers as a head coach of an inner city football team in Memphis.

In some way, it does seem like a storyline that was taken from an episode of ""Friday Night Lights"" but in the case of ""Undefeated"", this is a true story of Bill Courtney, a man who runs a business, has a family but chooses to not coach near his area which are primarily affluent families but to teach at Manassas High School, a high school that is predominately Black.  But make no mistake about it, there is no racial issue when Bill and a few members of his team (who are Caucasian) are there to help these teenage football players.

Some who show extreme talent but others who have faced major issues in their personal lives.

Courtney sets everything up through his opening speech before the season and that is he saw players arrested, players suspended and things that have happened at Manassas that coaches would or never experience in their whole coaching career.

He preaches to his players to work as a team but also show character but letting his teammates know they must work hard, try hard and stay out of trouble.

But it's the history of Manassas that we learn about and why he wants his players to work hard.  Manassas High School has lost many games with many years of not winning one game.  And are considered a laughing stock for other rival teams.

But with this group of young football players that Coach Courtney has who are graduating, this is his best team yet and he's determined in making sure this team wins.

And after their first loss, they eventually begin to win games.  But winning doesn't come easy.  In fact, throughout the documentary, Coach Courtney faces major issues when troubled teen Chavis Daniels, who has football experience, has rejoined the team after getting into major trouble.  A teenager with major anger issues, his temper often gets the best of him and he ends up fighting with teammates.

O.C. Brown is the star football player with great size and speed as a high school player but his grades are suffering and no tutors are willing to come to the area, so Coach Courtney and another coach decide to let O.C. Brown stay with the family in order to allow him to get the tutoring he needs in order to graduate from high school and go to college.

Another player, Montrail ""Money"" Brown is a dedicated player who is passionate about football, good at his studies but after getting into a clash with Chavis and then tearing his ACL, Montrail starts to lose faith within himself and to not play football is one of the most difficult things he had has to face in his life and now loses interest in high school.

As Coach Courtney tries to play mentor and be a father figure for these young players, he wants to make sure they focus on the challenging weeks and win football games.

And with all the hardwork that the coach and his staff had put in with these children, they are able to make a difference in their lives.

The Blu-ray release for ""Undefeated"" is good as one can expect from a documentary on Blu-ray.  Shot digitally, the film looks great during close-ups and as for its lossless soundtrack, dialogue and music was appropriate but one should not expect the greatest PQ or AQ considering it was a low-budget documentary.  And as for special features, you do get a few including an audio commentary and making of.

Overall, ""Undefeated"" is a fantastic documentary that football fans will feel proud of.  This is the heart and soul of a true underdog film, a team that no one believed in, but a volunteer coach and his staff who did and wanted to show them that there is hope, they can be winners if they continue to try hard at it.

Coach Courtney and the Manassas High School showed us the heart of winners and in essence, made ""Undefeated"" an inspirational film worth watching.

5372726,5,B009YQJ2Q4,"This was an inspirational story of a great group of players that overcome so many obstacles to achieve so much both personally and as a team. This is a movie that will leave you wanting to watch it again and you can see very quickly why this movie won an Academy Award for being the Best Documentary in 2011. While I had never seen this, I am a big high school football fan in our own home town, so I was excited to watch this and see what it was all about. The movie definitely did not disappoint as I mentioned and it lives up to its' Oscar win. If you too love football, or simply love to see a story of people working through the challenges that life throws at them, then this is definitely the movie for you! I highly recommend this to all!

5372727,5,B009YQJ2Q4,"I fell in love with football while I was in High School and have been a fan ever since. I actually learned about the game just to impress a boy but my love of the sport stayed long after he was gone! I always love a good sports movie and a true one is even better so I was really looking forward to watching Undefeated.

I actually had no idea what to expect because I never read the back of movies before watching because I don't like to have any pre-conceived notions. I didn't know anything other than this was a football movie based on the cover. I didn't know it was a documentary so I was a little disappointed when it started and I realized it. I don't usually like documentaries but I have never been so happy to admit I was wrong.

This documentary was so touching and inspirational. I think for a documentary to be successful it has to be put together perfectly and there has to be a balance between interviews, shots of the football games and the players home lives. This documentary was expertly put together and inspiring music completed the recipe for success. I can see why this won an Oscar!

Coach Bill Courtney took a football team at a school with no money and no hope for a future and made them into winners.

Undefeated isn't just referring to winning football games. It's about not letting life defeat you and working hard to accomplish your dreams no matter what your circumstance. These boys had no hope for a future after school and lived in absolute poverty; most with only one parent at home and some with none. These are the types of kids that people write off and add to a statistic which then becomes a self-fulfilling prophesy. Courtney was not going to fall into that category without a fight.

By the end of this DVD I was in tears. I was sad for the life they had so far but happy for the futures they had to look forward to, in large part because one  man took the time to believe in them and invest in their lives. You will be touched, inspired and remember your own dreams after watching Undefeated.",1361750400,15,2036,4.358839050131926

It is a documentary filmed over several years following the progress of an especially promising freshman class which takes the football team from worst to first.

The directors did a fine job of capturing the emotion and struggles of the players and its truly an inspirational tale of of the guys and their coach not giving up on one another.,1361145600,,253,4.270833333333333

5372746,3,B009YQJ2Q4,Undefeated is a great inspirational true story. Being a documentary helps you understand that perseverance is possible for anyone who trys hard enough in spite of the obstacles and this team had many. The coach is living a selfless life which is admirable. You see the true emotion of a bunch of guys that are facing either the end of their life or the begging after the season is up and the season only lasts as long as they fight for it. I would recommend this to anyone who loves inspirational films or who love to see dedication and selfless acts.,1360022400,,551,4.465346534653466

This is about one man making a difference and young men allowing themselves to learn and to be molded in a way they would have never imagined. Sacrificing for each other; second (and third) chances; the whole being bigger than the sum of its parts. And, yes, you will be cheering for these players during the game. I believe the filmmakers did an excellent job of editing this storyline and merging on-field and off-field. Well done and well-deserving of its Academy Award.",1359417600,,529,4.888888888888889

5372755,5,B009YQJ2Q4,"This movie is just great. It totally deserved the Oscar.

While the movie is presumably about high school football in an impoverished area of Memphis, it is really about the importance of fathers. None of the major players on the team have fathers in their lives. Neither did the coach when he was growing up, and his memories of the toll that took on him led him to become a stand-in father to the young men on his team.

He set high standards and gave the players the choice to live up to them or not, while constantly telling them they could, that they had everything in themselves to make good choices. He constantly talked about character, and the importance of having it. Through the games they played you could see this group of individuals become a team.

My favorite scene was the one where he talked to Chavez about the importance of talking things out with someone he thought wronged him. Throughout my life I've persuaded people who are upset with something someone else said or did to just talk to the other person about it. In almost every case the upset person finds that the other person did not mean to hurt them. (I read a great short story in grade school where a girl overheard another girl say something mean, only to learn she'd been reading aloud from a book where the heroine had the same first name.)

This movie is also very depressing in a way because the teenagers in this high school have not received an education though they have spent years in school. One promising athlete struggles to get a high enough score on his ACT's to qualify for college entrance, and one of the high school administrators admits the student had been promoted just because of his size. And this young man was smart, fully capable of learning and eager to do it.

The coach offered a home to this player so he could have tutors (tutors would not go to the part of town where the player lived with his grandmother). I'd just read an article in the newspaper about how common this is throughout sports. The movie addresses the ""unfairness"" of this favoritism as a black administrator points out anyone with talent can and should be encouraged by adults, whether that be a football coach or a music teacher.

Another person paid for a player to go to college because the young man showed such strength of character. This unnamed benefactor never even met the young man, just heard about him from one of the assistant coaches.

It takes people who give a damn to change this world. One person at a time. If every person who watches this movie makes a difference in one other person's life, what a great world this would be.",1359244800,,2626,4.527426160337553
