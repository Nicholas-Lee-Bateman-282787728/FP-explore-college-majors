3145948,4,B0015NQEMY,"Yea the highlights and the music are nice, but PLEASE JUST GIVE ME THE WHOLE GAME OPTION FOR ALL THE GAMES.
I think it would also be great to have real game film (shot overhead, sideline-to-sideline) available like the ones the pro teams use to scout each other.

Over the years, in my opinion, NFL Films have gotten a little too ""artsy fartsy"". I don't need to see a close-up of the ball traveling 50yards in air. It does nothing for me. I want to be able to see more schemes and position play at work on both sides of the ball.
And if the game is broadcasted in HD, can NFL Films please get with the program and sell it in HD.",1206921600,3,628,4.105691056910569
3145949,4,B0015NQEMY,"I am happy to see another road to ... release.
I have to the previous Road to XL, and Road to XLI. both are excellent 4 disc set and feature the entire superbowl as well as 3 play off games, edited to about 2 hours. Only the commercials are edited out and you get probably 99% of the actual games. IT wil be interesting if they use the origional commentary from the TV broadcast.
I love rewatching the playoff games and Superbowl games, and would love to see the series go back for the past 10 year or so.

AS others have said, I WANT THIS IN HD, give me blue ray.
I will not be happy if I buy this for $30, and then see it in blue ray in another 6 months..

I just knocked 1 star because we all want blue ray.

Does anyone know if there will be NFL blue ray discs anytime soon ??

ps.
we get the superbowl + these 3 play off games I assume !

 1/6  at Tampa Bay  W, 24-14
 1/13  at Dallas  W, 21-17
 1/20  at Green Bay
I wish also we got the Giants VS Patriots game earlier in the season even though the Giants lost, it is really part of the road to the superbowl too.

I pre ordered the DVD format today,5-19-08, but I sure wish I was ordering the Blu-ray format instead..
Come on NFL films  GIVE ME BLU-RAY !

Amazon put this in the mail for me saturday. So I am getting it in a few days.  I did think that when you preordred something on AMAZON, they had it in the buyers hands on the release day. I know they do that with books.

THis will be a great week watching all these games over again.

Thanks AMAZON, you got this in my hands today, on the release day.",1205798400,7,1565,3.911111111111111
3145950,5,B0015NQEMY,"What a great move by the NFL. Finally! I have one problem with this.  Everything is going digital in 2009 and the aspect ratio is 1.33 to 1? This should be in widescreen at least if not HD-- What is the NFL thinking? Are you listening? The games were broadcast in HD and the DVD being sold is in Standard? Talk about dropping the ball.

Also, this is listed on the Warner Home Video website at $29.95.  Where are you getting a list price of $39.98, Amazon? Are you making up list prices?",1205712000,18,487,4.21505376344086
3145951,5,B0015NQEMY,"I will be one of the first to purchase this item. Like the previous reviewer, I'm shocked, but extremely happy the NFL is going to release a full broadcast version of the Super Bowl. This is something that is way overdue!! The ONLY thing to make this better is to release a BluRay version of this, for those of us wanting to see the game in hi def and widescreen!!!",1205712000,6,365,4.228571428571429

3145957,5,B0015NQEMY,"The pure joy of watching these games again and again in the future is in part not just because it's my favorite team, it's because I watched them with my young sons and wife...we will always share those memories. It was fun standing in front of the TV at the time yelling and screaming with anguish and joy as each play led to the final Super Bowl win...
My son bought this DVD for Fathers Day...I really don't care about anything else regarding the quality composition etc...although it is very good, just not HD good...",1407456000,,521,4.494736842105263
3145958,4,B0015NQEMY,"This item could have easily been 5 stars. The only issue is that there's nothing after the games end. There's very little post game celebration. Once the two head coaches shake hands after the game, that's it, the screen just fades away. I feel it takes a lot of the joy of winning a Super Bowl away. Every great football fan knows that the best part of your team winning a Super Bowl is watching the Lombardi trophy get hoisted in the air and watch all of the players and coaches come together and we get to see none of that. Although for me this is a pretty big issue, these are fantastic DVDs with 5 full games. If you're a Giants fan like me, you shouldn't hesitate to buy this.",1381104000,,682,4.213740458015267
3145959,5,B0015NQEMY,"This DVD set gives you the final game of the regular season when they played the Patriots. Also the whole playoffs, and the rematch game vs the Patriots in the super bowl. Fans of the Giants who are too young and/or didn't record these games needs to order this. Even not being able to remember one game is still worth ordering. The games are shown to you as it was on live TV. Joe Buck and Troy Aikman are the broadcasters and they did a great job. On the superbowl game, (disc 5) Michael Straham gives you his play by play analysis, just go down and hit the Michael commentary on/off before watching.",1376524800,,602,4.336283185840708
3145960,5,B0015NQEMY,"I had to purchase two copies of this--one for my husband, the other for my son.  They could not share!  Since the 2012 season did not go as we'll as hoped, they had these DVD'S as a remembrance of better times.  It had all the great plays of the season.  This set is a must for giants fans--who need a pick-me-up off season (literally and figuratively)!",1362096000,,353,4.303030303030303
3145961,5,B0015NQEMY,"of course, this was the legendary superbowl upset-win our guys did to the undefeated new england patriots.  you get 5 discs altogether: game-16 with the new england patriots [obivously the giants lost that game]. and then the rest of the post-season games in order: wins over tampa bay, dallas, green bay and then of course the super bowl.  and don't get me wrong, i'm a huge giants fan, but even i thought back then, there's just no way the giants can beat new england.  new england was just too good, but watching the game again and again just reinforced to me how good the giants really were.  and the added bonus was michael strahan's personal commentary on the game.  it was very interesting hearing his comments since he was right there on the field.  fantastic set!! you'll watch it over and over!! and i think all the giants fans will also enjoy michael's personal take on the game.  get it!! you'll love it!!",1359244800,,917,4.588957055214724
3145962,5,B0015NQEMY,"The DVD is exactly what it's supposed to be--the Giants' awesome 2008 playoff wins. I haven't watched these on an HD tv so I don't have any of the same complaints as some other people do, but I could see how someone with a nice HD tv would be disappointed by the lack of HD support.",1357171200,,282,4.053571428571429
3145963,5,B0015NQEMY,"Regardless of the outcome of this season, which right now looks okay considering the 38-10 spanking we gave GreenBay SUnday Nov. 25th 2012, I am still riding on that emotional high from last seasons victorious super bowl! I am confident that the G-Men will once again surprise and upset a few top picks this year on the way to defending it's superbowl crown!!!
This DVD set is awesome, I relive the moments and get sooo friggin excited that we are who we are, the NY GIANTS and NOT the NY Jets....gheeeeeez!!!!!
Anyways, if your a NY GIANTS fan or not, you'll appreciate this DVD set very very much!!!!
I definitely recommend this!!!",1353888000,,633,4.660714285714286
3145964,5,B0015NQEMY,"This is an excellent set of DVD's depicting the Giants Road to Super Bowl XLII, and the Super Bowl game.

I ordered this DVD by mistake as I had purchased it several years ago.  I wanted Giants Road to the Super Bowl XlVI.  I returned the DVD and the seller was very professional when I requested a return.  I paid postage to return the item.

However, I was only refunded $7.99 out of the $15.99 I paid.  The seller charged an $8.00 restocking fee.

I""m sure this must be the sellers policy, but I won't do business again.

3145965,5,B0015NQEMY,"This is definetly for the die-hards (which I am). It's great being able to watch those games again, and to have the ability to show my kids and grandkids in the future (if DVD players aren't extinct by then). My only knock on it is that I wish it was in HD, but there is no way it would have been as affordable on bluray. Great collection.",1331251200,,339,4.074626865671642
3145966,2,B0015NQEMY,"Yes these are 5 great consecutive Giants games from 2007-2008, each with compelling game play.  The commercials and much of the non-productive time are edited out. The condensed material keeps things moving along at a nice pace.  A big plus is the inclusion of a separate audio track by Michael Strahan which was mostly recorded in a studio after the game but there are audio snippets that give you a sense of what it was like on the sidelines- especially during the last drive of the SB. The television announcers (IMHO) favored the opposing teams in each game which became annoying.  However, in my opinion, NFL Films (Vivendi Entertainment) have completely dropped the ball on this set- given that the games were broadcast in wide screen 1080i format. The 4:3 screen format coupled with SD video quality dramatically reduces the entertainment value of the set. When up-converting to a current 42"" Sony Bravia 1080 set or watching on a 26"" PC monitor at 720i the video is very pixelated. As a previous reviewer mentioned- no post game interviews or photo stills provided.  Dah???  Frustrating that the Road to Superbowl sets that follow are available in 16:9 Blu-Ray. It's doubtful NFL Films will update the 2007-2008 Giants Road set in 16:9 Blu-Ray format.  I expect that a 16:9 Blu-Ray set for the 2011 season will be produced based on subsequent annual releases. Amazon already lists a 16:9 Blu-Ray for SB 46 (available in March). Let's hope the NFL film producers see the value in at least providing a Blu-Ray set with SB's 42 and 46 (Giants vs. Pats). Given the historical significance to die-hard Giants fans and the set's current price, this collection is a worthwhile addition to your video library.  Shame it could have been SO much better given the current state of digital video technology.",1328400000,,1803,4.872549019607843
3145967,4,B0015NQEMY,"I loved this dvd. If you are a Giants fan you will love it. If you are not a big Giants fan you will still love the fact that an underdog won the superbowl. The only people who would not like this dvd ,are new England fans.",1327536000,,223,3.765957446808511
3145968,2,B0015NQEMY,"As a NY Giant fan, I had to have this.  However, I was extremely disappointed in the quality of the video.  We are talking 2008 and the image is worse than my mother's non-HD television!  NFL video you are a total rip-off artist.  I contacted NFL Films and they basically told me ""too bad"".",1324252800,,290,4.314814814814815
3145969,5,B0015NQEMY,My opinion is that it was very easy to order this product on line and that the product which was a gift arrived on time and it was great that a gift note could be attached. The person who received this product thanked me profusely.,1317340800,,231,4.155555555555556
3145970,5,B0015NQEMY,The road to SB XLII couldn't have been more exciting if it were produced as a fictional Hollywood movie. It truly supports the theory that fact can be truer and more spectacular than fiction. The icing on the cake is the superlative production job that makes the games literaly come alive with the close up field shots and dialogue.  Go GIANTS GO,1315267200,,346,4.580645161290323
3145971,4,B0015NQEMY,its was great any giants fan will love this only thing that upset me was they didn't show no superbowl celebration after wards but besides that i loved it and about the quality its absolutely fine so don't listen to the people bitching about it,1295740800,,244,4.444444444444445
3145972,5,B0015NQEMY,"As you've surely read by now in other reviews, these are standard definition only.  Each game is edited down to fit in a two-hour format, so you don't have to do a lot of fast fowarding through half time and commercials and fluff.  I've watched all the post-season games multiple times but never the week 17 game against New England -- I don't want to watch a replay of a game they lost.  Overall a very good addition to my [homemade] Giants collection that includes Superbowl XXV against the Bills, the 1986 NFC Championship Game against Washington, the 1990 NFC Championship Game against San Fran and a few others.  The Superbowl disk in this set includes alternative audio of Michael Strahan narrating the game, which is a nice plus.",1259625600,,736,4.682170542635659
3145973,4,B0015NQEMY,"...would've been nice to have the option to buy it in HD.  NFL really dropped the ball on that one.  Otherwise, great set and would make a great gift for any Giants fan.",1252540800,,169,4.090909090909091
3145974,4,B0015NQEMY,"The games were edited to remove the commercials, and any worthless time, which allows you to just focus on the actual plays.

One thing, though, is that I was expecting backstage scenes from the game, sideline talks, players' interviews, etc.

But still, it is a pretty good investment.",1252368000,,286,4.9375
3145975,1,B0015NQEMY,"I am a life long diehard fan for Big Blue, and I was really psyched to see this set.

Sadly, I have to give it a 1 star, because it is just NO fun watching a standard def video on an HD setup.  At least with standard def films, they up-res to look almost as good.  Not this one.  It looks terrible on my HD tv, like watching a tape.

Reissue it in HD and Widescreen....PLEASE.  Now that the NFL has finally gotten in gear with releasing full game broadcasts, they HAVE to go the final step of releasing them in both standard and high-def formats, or it's really not worth doing it at all.  Thank you.",1251763200,4,600,4.076923076923077
3145976,5,B0015NQEMY,"This was a gift, so I didn't actually watch it. I am sure it was great. Too bad they aren't going back to the SB again this year.",1232668800,,129,3.642857142857143
3145977,5,B0015NQEMY,This video was all my husband requested for Christmas.  This product was easy to find on Amazon.com and the price was comparable to e-bay.  The whole experience was easy and fast!!!  I would recommend amazon.com to everyone.,1232064000,,224,5.0
3145978,3,B0015NQEMY,"As you've probably figured out, the games don't look great on these DVD's.  However, they do look good.  But for $40, you'd expect great.  I've seen another DVD with the FOX network feed (the 2007 Fiesta Bowl) which looks and sounds crystal clear.  Why couldn't they do that for these games, all but one of which were originally broadcast on FOX?  The NFL really dropped the ball (no pun intended) with this set.",1231718400,,412,4.589041095890411
3145979,5,B0015NQEMY,"I bought this for my husband after this amazing win. What a season!!! We have without exaggeration watched this movie at least a dozen times.

All classic games! I can't believe some people would complain about the DVD quality. Umm... it's a dvd and it looks great. I am not gonna buy a regular DVD and expect HD or blu-ray quality.

I wish these games were presented in widescreen format.  The pan and scan format is disappointing, but I'm so happy to just have these games on dvd.  Perhaps a Blu Ray down the line?  Strahan's SB commentary insightful, funny.  Left me wanting more special features though.",1226966400,,475,4.8625
3145988,4,B0015NQEMY,"I read a lot of the reviews on here, about how bad the quality is, and this and that, whatever. I ordered and received it the next day. I raced home after work to put it on - The first disc, Giants Vs Pats in the regular season, I wasn't too fond of. First of all it was on the NFL Network, That's a laugh. The commentator's were terrible.
The quality, of course, is not in HD or anything, but it's still watchable.
Overall, this is a remarkable thing the NFL is doing. I didn't see 3 out of 5 of the games available, and it was great to finally see what I missed.
This is clearly a must have for ANY Giants fan; Regardless of HD quality or not.",1226448000,,645,3.9692307692307693
3145989,3,B0015NQEMY,"It was a thrill to be able to buy DVDs of one of the greatest postseason runs of all time, but the set was disappointing.  The video transfer is poor in standard definition, and it looks absolutely awful on a large HD set.  It's a shame this wasn't released in Blu-Ray (maybe Warner didn't expect a big demand?) and it was absolutely criminal to leave off the postgame celebration and Super Bowl trophy presentation.  Certainly they could have cobbled something together out of the postgame plus the parade and subsequent rallies?  I'll keep the set for posterity, but if I want to watch the famous 3rd-and-5, I'll have to stick with my lefover DVR recording.",1226448000,4,659,4.7043478260869565

Great to have the entire games to cherish!!

My dad was a longtime fan since the polo ground days and said he hoped to live long enough to see them win a super bowl...he passed in 1993 and saw them win 2 of them, and I know he was sitting near me cheering during XLII with Jesus' permission.

3145998,5,B0015NQEMY,"The Michael Strahan narration of the Superbowl is worth the price by itself. It is so much the usual witticism and comedy that Michael brings to it, but his actual very reasoned and thought out discussion of how football players in general and the Giants in particular think about the development of the game.  Not that Michael doesn't sound witty, but you get the picture that he is too serious about football and his own playing with the team in this game to put entertainment above accuracy.

It is so good that it is hard to get it out of the DVD player!

These 5 DVDs have no extra behind the scenes or boring documentary, just the last 5 regular season game and the 2008 playoffs in which the giants dominated (specially on the Defensive side) and managed to upset the previously undefeated New England Patriots.

A real interesting thing is that you can listen to Michael Strahan commenting throughout the Superbowl game.

So I contacted Amazon thinking I ordered the wrong format, yet was blown away to find out that this is the only was it was released!!!

The NFL network showed the last game of the season on tv for everyone to watch, as NE was going for an undefeated season.  The rest are on Fox and of course we know who does those.

Needless to say I will not purchase this set until it is in widescreen, I don't see that happening, but then again, knowing the greedy NFL, they'll probably reissue it in widescreen, call it the deluxe edition and charge $99.95.

One is the picture quality, which is good enough but vastly inferior to the HD broadcast. Second is the elimination of all postgame and most pregame from each broadcast. For me, the real enjoyment of the Giants' remarkable run was watching the players reveling and the announcers eating crow.

3146024,2,B0015NQEMY,"Pros:

This is a great product if you're looking to have the last regular season game, all the playoff games, and the super bowl, then this is the DVD set for you!

Cons:

There are a few reasons why I am VERY disappointed in this product...

1) It has not been released in Hi Definition Blu-Ray, which in this day in age is rediculous.  Especially since the game was originally produced and broadcast in HD!

2) On the DVD's, this format is 4:3 (Standard Definition).  I could see if they released this set on DVD with the format being 16:9 so that a Blu-Ray player or HDTV set could upscale it properly to fill the screen.  With this DVD set being in 4:3, you'll still have the black bars on the sides.

3) Quality...Since I'm in the television industry, maybe I'm more picky than most, but when I buy a DVD set like this...I expect quality.  Again, I am very disappointed.  You can tell that the games were recorded in a deck because you can see the VITC data at the top of the screen...(VITC=Vertical Interval Time Code)...which is rediculous.  The other thing is that since a standard movie on DVD is approximately 2 hours long and an NFL game is 3 - 4 hours long, the makers of this DVD set obviously had to compress the video beyond belief to make each game fit on a single DVD.  Again, this compromised the quality of the video.

4) The team introduction videos were cut out of the DVD that has the Super Bowl on it.  It only shows the teams taking the field at the beginning.  Additionally, the half time show was not included on the Super Bowl DVD either.",1213833600,2,1565,4.344827586206897
3146025,3,B0015NQEMY,"As far as I know, this is the first time the NFL has released entire games for sale to the public. This is long overdue, but it's readily apparent that the NFL doesn't understand its own product (or, at least, how to market its own product). It's a bare-bones production that delivers exactly what was promised - the original television broadcasts of the Giants' playoff run - and little else (more on that below).

The chapters are broken down by quarter, instead of by drive. With each quarter lasting about 30 minutes of air-time, fans searching for individual plays will have to spend an inordinate amount of time on FF/REW. This is particularly problematic considering that this entire playoff run was defined by a single, spectacular play which fans will presumably want to skip to directly.

The only special feature is an uninspired commentary track by Michael Strahan on the Super Bowl disc. While sporadically insightful and entertaining, it's puzzling why they decided to feature commentary from only a single player that necessarily saw the field less than 50% of the time. It would have made much more sense for the commentary to feature either multiple players from both offense & defense, or coaches, analysts (a Jaworski commentary track would have been phenomenal). Alternately, they could have synchronized the original radio broadcasts from both the home and host teams, just to provide some variation at minimal production costs.

What's especially puzzling is that the market for this disc is presumably not the casual fan, but the armchair analysts seeking more insights into this most improbable of playoff runs. It's a step in the right direction for the NFL, but nevertheless a disappointment.",1213488000,2,1718,5.085106382978723

3146027,3,B0015NQEMY,"I am happy to have all three playoff games, and the final regular season game against the Pats, but the omission of the SB Trophy presentation, MVP presentation, etc...is a hugely glaring sore point for me. It definitely hurts my opinion of the set.

(UPDATE)

I have a friend who works for FOX Sports who says that the trophy presentation is not a part of the actual game broadcast, and requires a different license to distribute...or something like that. I think maybe because it is sponsored and would be considered advertising.",1213056000,4,531,4.824175824175824
3146028,5,B0015NQEMY,"This is a great idea for the NFL. Releasing full games, including the Super Bowl.  I bought it for one of the greatest regular season finales ever, Favre's last game (I'm a Packers fan), and one of the greatest and most significant Super Bowls ever.  The NFL should do this every season.  I would also like to see other teams get DVD packs.  Maybe release a Top 5 games for each team.  I think it'd sell really well for the NFL although it might take away from all those NFL Replay games on NFL Network.

Some things I didn't like was no widescreen and very little post or pre-game coverage.  It's good though to get through all the hype and just see the game.  I've already watched the Super Bowl twice since I bought it.",1212969600,2,722,4.296296296296297

It felt like watching excellent copies of all the games in a way I used to have to do with old VHS tapes (Don't panic the quality is vastly better and up to modern standards!).  I just had fond memories of the past, Watching games during the old VHS days while watching this collection.  To have all these fantastic games in DVD format, easily accessible for the future, is more than worth the price itself!  Sure I would have loved the Pregame set up (Where the Giants describe themselves with the word Resilency and The Pats use the word Teamwork) and some of the Post Game wrap up, but thats just nitpicking.  Strahan's Superbowl commentary more than makes up for the lack of Pre/Post game extras.  A great tribute to the greatest Superbowl run ever!  OK, in the NFC for sure (The Steelers had a great run in 2005 as a 6th seed in the AFC, BUT they didn't face the Undefeated Pats, LOL).  Great collection and great value.

3146031,4,B0015NQEMY,"I am a NY Giants fan that lives near Dallas TX.
I pre-ordered this product and just received it on June 3rd, ahead of schedule!
Immediately, I popped Disc 3 (vs Dallas), to relive a great victory over a shocked Dallas team, and to check out the product.
This disc had the game as it was broadcast by Fox with a couple of short pre-game on the field interviews. Then just the game, no commercials or idle time, but all of the action.
I assume the same goes for the other discs/games.

-Disc 2 Giants at Buccaneers (wild card game)
-Disc 3 Giants at Cowboys (
-Disc 4 Giants at Packers (NFC Championship game)
-Disc 5 Giants at Patriots (Superbowl XLII game)

My favorite part of the collection is the Super Bowl DVD with Michael Strahan's commentary track. I just watched the whole thing and you get to hear his comments on every single play. This leads to one final disappointment. There is nothing of the post game on here. I mean zero. Manning takes the final snap, and the DVD goes to the credits. Are you kidding me?

For people thanking god that the NFL is finally doing this, the Pats did this for all three of their super bowl teams, and the past two years the Steelers and Colts have done it too, so the NFL has released DVD games since '02. Also, starting late last year, the NFL has released similar items for every recent super bowl team. Right now, it only goes back to the '99 Rams, but I'm assuming the NFL will continue to go back. This is certainly a great step by the NFL, because the NFL can reap major cash by releasing old games.

Also, props to the NFL for including the regular season game between the two. That was a great game, and is really the start of the Giants Road to the Super Bowl.

So, any fan of any recent super bowl team can buy a similar set, but this one, since it has three classic games in it, is a must buy for really any good NFL fan.",1212278400,3,1015,4.065

3146036,5,B0015NQEMY,"I just found out that the Giants ""Road To Super Bowl XLII"" DVD's are being releasd and I just can't wait! I watched every game they played this season except the loss against Minnesota (not a bad game to miss) and they left a lasting mark on me that the rarest of teams do-(the 1986 & 1990 Giants, the 1993-94 Rangers, the 1992-93 & 93-94 Knicks, the 1986 Mets & the 1995-2001 Yankees). The 2007 Giants were one of the most enjoyable teams for me to watch & root passionately for and their ultimate victory was one of the sweetest and maybe the best ever. Remember, they were not supposed to be very good, Tiki had hung 'em up & bashed 'em from pillar to post whenever he could. Coughlin was under constant criticism from the fans, the media and his own players and was given a lame duck 1 year extension. Eli was being dragged through the mud amid omnipresent comparisons to his brother and we were reminded with every int. or fumble that trading Rivers and those picks to get him from San Diego was a monumental mistake. The corners and safeties were either too old or not very good and the heart of the team was questioned and scrutinized after a 6-2 start in '06 ended up 8-8 and one and done in the playoffs. All of this adversity pointed to a 5-11 season maybe 6-10, especially after the Week 2 blowout against Green Bay. Then the pieces slowly came together, there was that fantastic goal-line stop in Washington in the 4th when the Giants came all the way back to win. They won 6 in a row and people were starting to talk about the ""new"" Coughlin and the new defensive coordinator, and his attacking style of defense that reminded many of Parcell's ""Big Blue Wrecking Crew"" of Taylor, Banks, Carson, Reasons, Marshall & Pepper. This was a team that entertained you and thrilled you and also frustrated and annoyed you. The term ""inconsistant"" was tossed around alot in any Giants discussion but there was this underlying sense that this was a special team growing and quickly coming into it's own as something potentially great. The week 17 game was a classic from start to finish. The intense media crush was on Coughlin to rest his starters for the playoffs against a team that was playing for a perfect 16-0 season. The Giants had nothing to play for anyway, they were already in the playoffs. They came out and almost beat the Pats that night in the most exciting regular season game all year. They would use that as a springboard to finally dispatch of playoff nemesis Garcia (payback for '02 and '06) and the Bucs and then played two of the greatest playoff games in history by defeating division winners Dallas and Green Bay on the road. The Dallas game was oh so sweet (especially after the trash talking of Patrick Crayton)and the over-time championship game at Green Bay was a stone cold classic. The way they were playing looked like a team of destiny, as my co-worker told me: ""They're playing like they simply won't lose to anyone"" The Super Bowl was almost surreal. The Giants held the only 18-0 team in history to 14 points and overwhelmed the great Tom Brady and his record setting offense with a defensive performance for the ages. Without hyperbole, the Eli to Tyree play will go down as the greatest play in Super Bowl, if not NFL, history. The rainbow pass to Plax in the corner endzone was the most beautiful site of the season. 18-0 became 18-1 as the Giants, did indeed give the Pats one giant loss. I had to repeatedly watch the game and highlights on my dvr, NFL network and ESPN to convince myself it wan't a dream. This DVD set will allow me to relive all these incredible moments and i can't wait to watch Big Blue knock off the mighty Patriots and prove the naysayers wrong all over again!",1209600000,5,3726,4.497050147492625

If so, this set got even better.  That was a magnificent game and this is the game that truly started the Giants road to the Super Bowl.

I think it would also be great to have real game film (shot overhead, sideline-to-sideline) available like the ones the pro teams use to scout each other.

Over the years, in my opinion, NFL Films have gotten a little too ""artsy fartsy"". I don't need to see a close-up of the ball traveling 50yards in air. It does nothing for me. I want to be able to see more schemes and position play at work on both sides of the ball.
And if the game is broadcasted in HD, can NFL Films please get with the program and sell it in HD.",1206921600,3,628,4.105691056910569
3380446,4,B0015NQEMY,"I am happy to see another road to ... release.
I have to the previous Road to XL, and Road to XLI. both are excellent 4 disc set and feature the entire superbowl as well as 3 play off games, edited to about 2 hours. Only the commercials are edited out and you get probably 99% of the actual games. IT wil be interesting if they use the origional commentary from the TV broadcast.
I love rewatching the playoff games and Superbowl games, and would love to see the series go back for the past 10 year or so.

AS others have said, I WANT THIS IN HD, give me blue ray.
I will not be happy if I buy this for $30, and then see it in blue ray in another 6 months..

I just knocked 1 star because we all want blue ray.

Does anyone know if there will be NFL blue ray discs anytime soon ??

ps.
we get the superbowl + these 3 play off games I assume !

 1/6  at Tampa Bay  W, 24-14
 1/13  at Dallas  W, 21-17
 1/20  at Green Bay
I wish also we got the Giants VS Patriots game earlier in the season even though the Giants lost, it is really part of the road to the superbowl too.

I pre ordered the DVD format today,5-19-08, but I sure wish I was ordering the Blu-ray format instead..
Come on NFL films  GIVE ME BLU-RAY !

Amazon put this in the mail for me saturday. So I am getting it in a few days.  I did think that when you preordred something on AMAZON, they had it in the buyers hands on the release day. I know they do that with books.

THis will be a great week watching all these games over again.

This should be in widescreen at least if not HD-- What is the NFL thinking? Are you listening? The games were broadcast in HD and the DVD being sold is in Standard? Talk about dropping the ball.

Also, this is listed on the Warner Home Video website at $29.95.  Where are you getting a list price of $39.98, Amazon? Are you making up list prices?",1205712000,18,487,4.21505376344086

It was fun standing in front of the TV at the time yelling and screaming with anguish and joy as each play led to the final Super Bowl win...
My son bought this DVD for Fathers Day...I really don't care about anything else regarding the quality composition etc...although it is very good, just not HD good...",1407456000,,521,4.494736842105263
3380455,4,B0015NQEMY,"This item could have easily been 5 stars. The only issue is that there's nothing after the games end. There's very little post game celebration. Once the two head coaches shake hands after the game, that's it, the screen just fades away. I feel it takes a lot of the joy of winning a Super Bowl away. Every great football fan knows that the best part of your team winning a Super Bowl is watching the Lombardi trophy get hoisted in the air and watch all of the players and coaches come together and we get to see none of that. Although for me this is a pretty big issue, these are fantastic DVDs with 5 full games. If you're a Giants fan like me, you shouldn't hesitate to buy this.",1381104000,,682,4.213740458015267

Fans of the Giants who are too young and/or didn't record these games needs to order this. Even not being able to remember one game is still worth ordering. The games are shown to you as it was on live TV. Joe Buck and Troy Aikman are the broadcasters and they did a great job. On the superbowl game, (disc 5) Michael Straham gives you his play by play analysis, just go down and hit the Michael commentary on/off before watching.",1376524800,,602,4.336283185840708

However, I was only refunded $7.99 out of the $15.99 I paid.  The seller charged an $8.00 restocking fee.

3380463,2,B0015NQEMY,"Yes these are 5 great consecutive Giants games from 2007-2008, each with compelling game play.  The commercials and much of the non-productive time are edited out. The condensed material keeps things moving along at a nice pace.  A big plus is the inclusion of a separate audio track by Michael Strahan which was mostly recorded in a studio after the game but there are audio snippets that give you a sense of what it was like on the sidelines- especially during the last drive of the SB. The television announcers (IMHO) favored the opposing teams in each game which became annoying.  However, in my opinion, NFL Films (Vivendi Entertainment) have completely dropped the ball on this set- given that the games were broadcast in wide screen 1080i format. The 4:3 screen format coupled with SD video quality dramatically reduces the entertainment value of the set. When up-converting to a current 42"" Sony Bravia 1080 set or watching on a 26"" PC monitor at 720i the video is very pixelated. As a previous reviewer mentioned- no post game interviews or photo stills provided.  Dah???  Frustrating that the Road to Superbowl sets that follow are available in 16:9 Blu-Ray. It's doubtful NFL Films will update the 2007-2008 Giants Road set in 16:9 Blu-Ray format.  I expect that a 16:9 Blu-Ray set for the 2011 season will be produced based on subsequent annual releases. Amazon already lists a 16:9 Blu-Ray for SB 46 (available in March). Let's hope the NFL film producers see the value in at least providing a Blu-Ray set with SB's 42 and 46 (Giants vs. Pats). Given the historical significance to die-hard Giants fans and the set's current price, this collection is a worthwhile addition to your video library.  Shame it could have been SO much better given the current state of digital video technology.",1328400000,,1803,4.872549019607843

Each game is edited down to fit in a two-hour format, so you don't have to do a lot of fast fowarding through half time and commercials and fluff.  I've watched all the post-season games multiple times but never the week 17 game against New England -- I don't want to watch a replay of a game they lost.  Overall a very good addition to my [homemade] Giants collection that includes Superbowl XXV against the Bills, the 1986 NFC Championship Game against Washington, the 1990 NFC Championship Game against San Fran and a few others.

Reissue it in HD and Widescreen....PLEASE.  Now that the NFL has finally gotten in gear with releasing full game broadcasts, they HAVE to go the final step of releasing them in both standard and high-def formats, or it's really not worth doing it at all.

The video transfer is poor in standard definition, and it looks absolutely awful on a large HD set.  It's a shame this wasn't released in Blu-Ray (maybe Warner didn't expect a big demand?) and it was absolutely criminal to leave off the postgame celebration and Super Bowl trophy presentation.

It is so much the usual witticism and comedy that Michael brings to it, but his actual very reasoned and thought out discussion of how football players in general and the Giants in particular think about the development of the game.  Not that Michael doesn't sound witty, but you get the picture that he is too serious about football and his own playing with the team in this game to put entertainment above accuracy.

Needless to say I will not purchase this set until it is in widescreen, I don't see that happening, but then again, knowing the greedy NFL, they'll probably reissue it in widescreen, call it the deluxe edition and charge $99.95.

For me, the real enjoyment of the Giants' remarkable run was watching the players reveling and the announcers eating crow.

3380521,2,B0015NQEMY,"Pros:

This is a great product if you're looking to have the last regular season game, all the playoff games, and the super bowl, then this is the DVD set for you!

Cons:

There are a few reasons why I am VERY disappointed in this product...

1) It has not been released in Hi Definition Blu-Ray, which in this day in age is rediculous.  Especially since the game was originally produced and broadcast in HD!

2) On the DVD's, this format is 4:3 (Standard Definition).  I could see if they released this set on DVD with the format being 16:9 so that a Blu-Ray player or HDTV set could upscale it properly to fill the screen.  With this DVD set being in 4:3, you'll still have the black bars on the sides.

3) Quality...Since I'm in the television industry, maybe I'm more picky than most, but when I buy a DVD set like this...I expect quality.  Again, I am very disappointed.  You can tell that the games were recorded in a deck because you can see the VITC data at the top of the screen...(VITC=Vertical Interval Time Code)...which is rediculous.  The other thing is that since a standard movie on DVD is approximately 2 hours long and an NFL game is 3 - 4 hours long, the makers of this DVD set obviously had to compress the video beyond belief to make each game fit on a single DVD.  Again, this compromised the quality of the video.

4) The team introduction videos were cut out of the DVD that has the Super Bowl on it.  It only shows the teams taking the field at the beginning.  Additionally, the half time show was not included on the Super Bowl DVD either.",1213833600,2,1565,4.344827586206897
3380522,3,B0015NQEMY,"As far as I know, this is the first time the NFL has released entire games for sale to the public. This is long overdue, but it's readily apparent that the NFL doesn't understand its own product (or, at least, how to market its own product). It's a bare-bones production that delivers exactly what was promised - the original television broadcasts of the Giants' playoff run - and little else (more on that below).

The chapters are broken down by quarter, instead of by drive. With each quarter lasting about 30 minutes of air-time, fans searching for individual plays will have to spend an inordinate amount of time on FF/REW. This is particularly problematic considering that this entire playoff run was defined by a single, spectacular play which fans will presumably want to skip to directly.

The only special feature is an uninspired commentary track by Michael Strahan on the Super Bowl disc. While sporadically insightful and entertaining, it's puzzling why they decided to feature commentary from only a single player that necessarily saw the field less than 50% of the time. It would have made much more sense for the commentary to feature either multiple players from both offense & defense, or coaches, analysts (a Jaworski commentary track would have been phenomenal). Alternately, they could have synchronized the original radio broadcasts from both the home and host teams, just to provide some variation at minimal production costs.

What's especially puzzling is that the market for this disc is presumably not the casual fan, but the armchair analysts seeking more insights into this most improbable of playoff runs. It's a step in the right direction for the NFL, but nevertheless a disappointment.",1213488000,2,1718,5.085106382978723

(UPDATE)

I have a friend who works for FOX Sports who says that the trophy presentation is not a part of the actual game broadcast, and requires a different license to distribute...or something like that. I think maybe because it is sponsored and would be considered advertising.",1213056000,4,531,4.824175824175824
3380525,5,B0015NQEMY,"This is a great idea for the NFL. Releasing full games, including the Super Bowl.  I bought it for one of the greatest regular season finales ever, Favre's last game (I'm a Packers fan), and one of the greatest and most significant Super Bowls ever.  The NFL should do this every season.  I would also like to see other teams get DVD packs.  Maybe release a Top 5 games for each team.  I think it'd sell really well for the NFL although it might take away from all those NFL Replay games on NFL Network.

Some things I didn't like was no widescreen and very little post or pre-game coverage.  It's good though to get through all the hype and just see the game.  I've already watched the Super Bowl twice since I bought it.",1212969600,2,722,4.296296296296297

It felt like watching excellent copies of all the games in a way I used to have to do with old VHS tapes (Don't panic the quality is vastly better and up to modern standards!).  I just had fond memories of the past, Watching games during the old VHS days while watching this collection.  To have all these fantastic games in DVD format, easily accessible for the future, is more than worth the price itself!  Sure I would have loved the Pregame set up (Where the Giants describe themselves with the word Resilency and The Pats use the word Teamwork) and some of the Post Game wrap up, but thats just nitpicking.  Strahan's Superbowl commentary more than makes up for the lack of Pre/Post game extras.  A great tribute to the greatest Superbowl run ever!  OK, in the NFC for sure (The Steelers had a great run in 2005 as a 6th seed in the AFC, BUT they didn't face the Undefeated Pats, LOL).  Great collection and great value.

3380528,4,B0015NQEMY,"I am a NY Giants fan that lives near Dallas TX.
I pre-ordered this product and just received it on June 3rd, ahead of schedule!
Immediately, I popped Disc 3 (vs Dallas), to relive a great victory over a shocked Dallas team, and to check out the product.
This disc had the game as it was broadcast by Fox with a couple of short pre-game on the field interviews. Then just the game, no commercials or idle time, but all of the action.
I assume the same goes for the other discs/games.

My favorite part of the collection is the Super Bowl DVD with Michael Strahan's commentary track. I just watched the whole thing and you get to hear his comments on every single play. This leads to one final disappointment. There is nothing of the post game on here. I mean zero. Manning takes the final snap, and the DVD goes to the credits. Are you kidding me?

For people thanking god that the NFL is finally doing this, the Pats did this for all three of their super bowl teams, and the past two years the Steelers and Colts have done it too, so the NFL has released DVD games since '02. Also, starting late last year, the NFL has released similar items for every recent super bowl team. Right now, it only goes back to the '99 Rams, but I'm assuming the NFL will continue to go back. This is certainly a great step by the NFL, because the NFL can reap major cash by releasing old games.

Also, props to the NFL for including the regular season game between the two. That was a great game, and is really the start of the Giants Road to the Super Bowl.

So, any fan of any recent super bowl team can buy a similar set, but this one, since it has three classic games in it, is a must buy for really any good NFL fan.",1212278400,3,1015,4.065

3380533,5,B0015NQEMY,"I just found out that the Giants ""Road To Super Bowl XLII"" DVD's are being releasd and I just can't wait! I watched every game they played this season except the loss against Minnesota (not a bad game to miss) and they left a lasting mark on me that the rarest of teams do-(the 1986 & 1990 Giants, the 1993-94 Rangers, the 1992-93 & 93-94 Knicks, the 1986 Mets & the 1995-2001 Yankees). The 2007 Giants were one of the most enjoyable teams for me to watch & root passionately for and their ultimate victory was one of the sweetest and maybe the best ever. Remember, they were not supposed to be very good, Tiki had hung 'em up & bashed 'em from pillar to post whenever he could. Coughlin was under constant criticism from the fans, the media and his own players and was given a lame duck 1 year extension. Eli was being dragged through the mud amid omnipresent comparisons to his brother and we were reminded with every int. or fumble that trading Rivers and those picks to get him from San Diego was a monumental mistake. The corners and safeties were either too old or not very good and the heart of the team was questioned and scrutinized after a 6-2 start in '06 ended up 8-8 and one and done in the playoffs. All of this adversity pointed to a 5-11 season maybe 6-10, especially after the Week 2 blowout against Green Bay. Then the pieces slowly came together, there was that fantastic goal-line stop in Washington in the 4th when the Giants came all the way back to win. They won 6 in a row and people were starting to talk about the ""new"" Coughlin and the new defensive coordinator, and his attacking style of defense that reminded many of Parcell's ""Big Blue Wrecking Crew"" of Taylor, Banks, Carson, Reasons, Marshall & Pepper. This was a team that entertained you and thrilled you and also frustrated and annoyed you. The term ""inconsistant"" was tossed around alot in any Giants discussion but there was this underlying sense that this was a special team growing and quickly coming into it's own as something potentially great. The week 17 game was a classic from start to finish. The intense media crush was on Coughlin to rest his starters for the playoffs against a team that was playing for a perfect 16-0 season. The Giants had nothing to play for anyway, they were already in the playoffs. They came out and almost beat the Pats that night in the most exciting regular season game all year. They would use that as a springboard to finally dispatch of playoff nemesis Garcia (payback for '02 and '06) and the Bucs and then played two of the greatest playoff games in history by defeating division winners Dallas and Green Bay on the road. The Dallas game was oh so sweet (especially after the trash talking of Patrick Crayton)and the over-time championship game at Green Bay was a stone cold classic. The way they were playing looked like a team of destiny, as my co-worker told me: ""They're playing like they simply won't lose to anyone"" The Super Bowl was almost surreal. The Giants held the only 18-0 team in history to 14 points and overwhelmed the great Tom Brady and his record setting offense with a defensive performance for the ages. Without hyperbole, the Eli to Tyree play will go down as the greatest play in Super Bowl, if not NFL, history. The rainbow pass to Plax in the corner endzone was the most beautiful site of the season. 18-0 became 18-1 as the Giants, did indeed give the Pats one giant loss. I had to repeatedly watch the game and highlights on my dvr, NFL network and ESPN to convince myself it wan't a dream. This DVD set will allow me to relive all these incredible moments and i can't wait to watch Big Blue knock off the mighty Patriots and prove the naysayers wrong all over again!",1209600000,5,3726,4.497050147492625

I recorded all these games on DVD, but I'll certainly buy this set anyway!",1207094400,2,376,4.054054054054054
3380539,5,B0015NQEMY,"I looked closely at the picture for disc one.  I think that disc contains the regular season game against New England, where the Giants lost 38-35. If so, this set got even better.  That was a magnificent game and this is the game that truly started the Giants road to the Super Bowl.  Definite must buy for me!!!",1207008000,2,313,4.362068965517241

8259203,5,B0015NQEMY,"You know you need to own this if you're a hardcore fan.  I've purchased this and seen each of these games 3 times already, since 2007. I've learned a ton about strategy since than, from online places like insidethepylon and nflbreakdowns so when I go back I always notice something else about the games.
  The 2007 Giants are more fun to watch than 2011's run to glory. The 2007 Postseason has to go down as the greatest ever in team history, and the most exciting stretch of 3 final games, of an underdog on the road.
  The season itself was weak, but everything changed in week 17, and Im glad this set contains that 38-35 thriller. The Offense clicked there. The Defense clicked later, in Tampa.  Dallas, Greenbay, SB, the D line is FUN to watch, its a historically brilliant defensive line, with a stable of rushers and backups who came in to keep the starters rested.  Justin Tuck, WAS ON THE BENCH. That's how good this D line is.  The 2007 Giants played my favorite style, Run the ball with a tackle breaker, pass when needed, control the game using a Defensive Front.  It's Supposed to be Giants style of play, but we abandoned it in 2011 to go Jet Blue and win it all with offense.  Only the Seahawks have replicated that old style effectively to a title lately.

  On Broadcast Angles, the Run Game, the O and D lines are really the one thing aspect that's totally in focus.  Watching the men in Blue destroy blocking schemes and get sacks, hits, hurries, and stuff some runs, is a real treat. Defensive football can be boring, unless its YOUR defense, and its hitting the QB, whether by blitzing or just blasting through blocks, and overpowering the league best offenses of that year.  Than its downright exciting. When the confetti falls at the end, Im literally moved each time.",1451520000,,1791,4.553125
