7029203,5,B00U4FYWXM,"I saw this movie 50 years ago at the Orpheum in SF.  It is still among my favorite films.  One of those I watch too often. While I've already purchased it on LD, DVD and Blu-ray, I'll very likely dip again for the 4K version.  However, a month before it's release there are no credible evaluations of its quality and it's priced at $42.  I'll wait a bit.

7/20/2018: I'll second Jack's review/warning of 7/18/2018.  The Home Theater Forum is ""on fire"" with concerns that this masterpiece is being altered by Warner Bros. to appease Chris Nolan's wishes.  Robert Harris, film restorer of ""My Fair Lady"" and ""Lawrence of Arabia"" has posted several times in the past few days that there is reason to be concerned that the restoration of this great film is being botched.  The recommendation to wait for reviews of the new disc is, sadly, a good one.",1519689600,50,846,4.556291390728477

The sci-fi masterpiece from acclaimed producer/director Stanley Kubrick about a space voyage to Jupiter that turns chaotic when a computer enhanced with artificial intelligence takes over. An imposing black structure provides a connection between the past and the future in this enigmatic adaptation of a short story by revered sci-fi author Sir Arthur C. Clarke. When Dave Bowman [Keir Dullea] and other astronauts are sent on a mysterious mission, their ship's computer system, HAL, begins to display increasingly strange behaviour, leading up to a tense showdown between man and machine that results in a mind-bending trek through space and time.

FILM FACT: The space suit helmet featured in the film 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, Stanley Kubrick consulted aerospace specialists to make sure on the design's accuracy. ""Stanley Kubrick made the ultimate science fiction movie, and it is going to be very hard for someone to come along and make a better movie, as far as I'm concerned. On a technical level, it can be compared, but personally I think that '2001' is far superior"" as stated by George Lucas, 1977. 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY earned Stanley Kubrick an Academy Award for Best Visual Effects, as well as nominations for Best Director and Original Screenplay and shared with Sir Arthur C. Clarke. Anthony Masters was also nominated for Best Art Direction. Sir Arthur C. Clarke reports that he ""wondered, as loudly as possible, whether the judges had passed over 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY because they thought we had used real ape-men."" The film won four British Academy Film Awards, for Art Direction, Cinematography, Sound Track and Best Road Show presentation, and was nominated in the Best Film category.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: The creation of 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY [1968] was as big an epic as the sci-fi film itself. Employing teams of professionals in every field from space flight to food services, Stanley Kubrick set out to make what he simply described as a ""good science fiction film."" His first step was to contact famed author Arthur C. Clarke, and over the next four years the two men crafted a ""fictionalized science lesson"" which was to be a coming of age of the entire human race.

2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY [1968] is a landmark, science fiction classic and probably the best science-fiction film of all time about exploration of the unknown. It was released, coincidentally, at the height of the space race between the USSR and the US. It appeared at the same time as NASA's exploratory Apollo Project with manned Earth orbiting missions and a prelude to orbiting and landing on the Moon with Apollo 11 on July 20, 1969. And it prophetically showed the enduring influence that computers would have in our daily lives.

Director Stanley Kubrick's work is a profound, visionary and astounding film and a tremendous visual experience. This epic film contained more spectacular imagery, about what space looked like, and special effects than verbal dialogue. Viewers are left to experience the non-verbal, mystical vastness of the film, and to subjectively reach into their own subconscious and into the film's pure imagery to speculate about its meaning. Many consider the masterpiece bewildering, boring, slow-moving or annoying, but are still inspired by its story of how man is dwarfed by technology and space.

The first spoken word is almost a half hour into the film, and there's less than 40 minutes of dialogue in the entire film. Much of the film is in dead silence, accurately depicting the absence of sound in space, or with the sound of human breathing within a spacesuit. Stanley Kubrick's sci-fi experiment intended to present its story almost purely with visual imagery and auditory signals with very little communicative human. All scenes in the film have either dialogue, music or silence, but never both together.

The film is enriched by stunning and totally brilliant pioneering technical effects that was so advanced at the time and still looks awesome today. It featured orchestral music, presented in movements like in a symphony, from: Richard Strauss, Also Sprach Zarathustra; Johann Strauss, The Blue Danube Waltz; Gyrgy Ligeti, Atmospheres, Lux Aeterna, and Requiem for Soprano, Mezzo-Soprano, Two Mixed Choirs and Orchestra and Aram Khatchaturian, Gayane Ballet Suite.

The breath-taking, richly eloquent, and visually-poetic film that is deliberately filmed at a slow pace and about space travel and the discovery of extra-terrestrial, and was based on the published 1951 short story The Sentinel, that was written in 1948 by English science fiction author Arthur C. Clarke. Its original screenplay was co-authored by director Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke from an expanded novelization, and the film was originally titled Journey Beyond the Stars. The film's title was chosen because it was the first year of the new Millennium and of the next century. The film was also strongly influenced by director George Pal's Conquest of Space [1955], and was similar in some plot elements that were referenced by Stanley Kubrick. Three months after the film made its debut, Arthur C. Clarke published a novel based upon the film's screenplay.

The space sequences proved no less imaginative. Because characters would be traveling and living in a variety of environments onboard spaceships, Kubrick needed to find a realistic way to blend both gravity and weightless conditions. The techniques ranged from the simple method of mounting a pen on a piece of rotating plexi-glass so that it appeared to be floating, to actually rotating the set, while the actors roamed about inside. The weightless spacewalk sequences were achieved by suspending actors, and in some cases set pieces like the ""pod"" transports, from the ceiling by wires. The ""floating"" actors were then shot from below, their bodies hiding the wires. For the ""stargate"" sequence, FX Supervisor Douglas Trumbull devised what was called a ""slitscan machine."" The machine helped with the process of photographing backlit transparencies of artwork, exposing each frame for a full minute, and moving the camera and artwork in sync, recording the art with a ""streaked,"" stylized fashion. The result was the appearance that Dave Bowman was moving through time and space at infinite speeds.

Taking just over four years and costing M-G-M $11 million, 2001: A Space Odyssey was met with mixed reviews when it premiered on April 12, 1968. Critics pretty much hated the film, calling it slow, boring, and confusing. Luckily, for Kubrick and Clarke, 2001: A Space Odyssey struck a chord with younger audiences, who made the film the second biggest box office draw of 1968. 2001: A Space Odyssey is now widely praised as a remarkable achievement for its realistic depiction of space flight during a time when our space program was in its infancy. Years before we actually set foot on the moon, Kubrick and Clarke not only envisioned settlements there; they showed us an unsettlingly accurate portrayal of the lunar surface. A sequel was made years later: director Peter Hyams's 2010 [1984] from a 1982 published adaptation titled 2010: Odyssey Two by Arthur C. Clarke. Other Arthur C. Clarke writings are potential film instalments: 2061: Odyssey Three and 3001: Final Odyssey.

Blu-ray Video Quality  Warner Home Video brings you 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY in the stunning Technicolor and Metrocolor image that you expect to experience in this awesome encoded 1080p image that will blow you away and is helped with the framed 2.20:1 [Super Panavision 70] aspect ratio that is equally spectacular that one would expect it to be with this high resolution and also shows a very fine grain structure, and that is exactly how it appears in this transfer from Warner Home Video and it hardly looks as if it has aged. Of course, the look of the film is no doubt helped out by the brilliant Stanley Kubricks shooting style of exposing his special effects composite shots as successive passes on the original undeveloped 65mm negative. This new remastered Blu-Ray edition is a sight to behold with a near flawless HD transfer. The opening pre-historic part is filled with rich, warm colours in the sunsets and desert environment. The flesh tones are accurate, colours are vibrant and blacks are rather inky and stable throughout as well. I would imagine that 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY has never looked better, like what you would of viewed in the cinema. There are only some minor issues with some spottiness of blacks around the very edges of the frames keeping this from being absolutely perfect. But despite this the print is in excellent condition and isn't marred by any softness, edge enhancement, scratches, or any distracting instances of source noise. For a film that's well over forty years old, this high-definition release is nothing short of a stunning spectacular presentation and especially with the opening ""Dawn of Man"" sequence seems to have been shot entirely at magic hour. The resulting shots are totally beautiful and really show off this 2015 remastered Blu-ray disc with flawless handling of the colour balance. Just about every scene in 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY looks as though it could have been filmed today. The print is flawless and the images are truly spectacular. This is a must own title on Blu-ray and is the ultimate definition of hi-definition reference grade and it is a must purchase for all fans of Stanley Kubricks ultimate science fiction masterpiece. Playback Region B/2: This will not play on most Blu-ray players sold in North America, Central America, South America, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia. Learn more about Blu-ray region specifications.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  Once again Warner Home Video brings you 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY in the stunning and equally impressive 5.1 LPCM Master Audio and of course you also have the option of the 5.1 Dolby Digital soundtrack, but the main hi-resolution audio option is a 5.1 LPCM Master Audio mix. The 5.1 LPCM Master Audio offers up a nicely expansive sound for the driving classical score, with a surprising amount of low end as well, but there is also a quite a bit of audible distortion in the orchestral recording. Dialogue is otherwise clean and intelligible in the centre channel. While I didn't notice much of a difference between the two tracks, both sound better than ever and provide a faithful experience that still manages to enhance Stanley Kubrick's original vision. The classical music in the film opens up the sound field and resonates with solid bass and stable trebles. Dialogue is crisp and perfectly prioritized, with HAL's soothing tones dominating the soundscape to good effect. Sharp sounds like bestial grunts and mechanical hisses have a distinct impact, while quiet scenes on the ship are layered with a careful level of naturalistic ambiance. This was the first time I'd noticed the subtle and comprehensive intricacies of the sound design. The original 6-channel stereo sound track has been remixed for 5.1 surround, but the rear channels have a limited presence that bolsters acoustics more than anything. The tone of the sound design is a clear product of the 1960s, particularly evident in the tenor of the voices, which can be attributed to the original recording more than anything else. Having said all that, 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY has never sounded better than it does here and is an elegant mix that adds to the experience of this incredible once in a lifetime awesome powerful sci-fi film.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Audio Commentary: Commentary by Keir Dullea and Gary Lockwood: The actors behind the characters Dave Bowman and Frank Poole reminisce about how they got involved with the project what it was like to work with such a visionary director, and they share their personal opinions about the greater meanings in the film. With the start of the film, the actors Keir Dullea and Gary Lockwood introduce themselves and of course they inform us that they both had an amazing thought provoking experience to be part of the film 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY. Gary Lockwood informs us that he became an actor in 1959, and came to England in 1965 to start shoot the film 2001. Keir Dullea informs us that at the same time was filming in London on the film Bunny Lake Is Missing, and when he got home from the days filming he got a call from his Agent to inform him that Staley Kubrick wanted him in his film 2001, and of course Keir was blown away, as Stanley Kubrick was his all-time favourite director ever since he viewed the film PATHS OF GLORY [1957]. Because Stanley Kubrick hated flying, he sent a crew to Africa to take still photographs of the African landscape, which were photographed on plate glass to use as the background at the start of the film and when you see the Ape-men it was all shot in the film studio in Boreham Wood in Hertfordhsire. Keir Dullea says when he read the script, he felt that he had read the same outline before, and suddenly realised he had read the same story in a science fiction magazine entitled The Sentinel written by Sir Arthur C. Clarke. When both actors were not filming, Stanley Kubrick would invite them to his home in North London, where other guests were gathered, like scientists, painters, sculptors, artists and also other people that were on the same wavelength of Staley Kubrick, where loved to discuss all aspects of life. Keir Dullea also informs us that to get the light right for filming a certain scene, Stanley would use a Polaroid camera to take hundreds of pictures and that is why each scene took ages to set up. When you see Keir Dullea and Gary Lockwood watching the panel of small TV screens, Gary Lockwood says when you see all the panel of video screens relating to the working of the spaceship, they were actually small screens that had a 16mm projector being projected onto them and there were loads of people behind to keep the projectors working. Keir Dullea also informs us that the food they were eating was developed by NASA. Keir Dullea also praises Gary Lockwood and really enjoyed working with him and that they both got on very well throughout the filming of 2001, especially that both actors had totally different personalities and Keir also says that it was to do the fact that it was a sort of YIN and YAN scenario, and that is why they acted so well together and again got on extremely well together, which helped a great deal, as they worked on the film for about 6 months. But as the years have passed them both by, they are still very good friends, despite not being in regular contact, because Keir Dullea mainly works in the theatre in New York and Gary Lockwood does other pursuits that is not involved with film. But what they both inform us that they were both very proud to work on such an awesome film, that they were also very proud to work with such a brilliant director like Stanley Kubrick, who also informed them both that he was also proud and honoured to have Keir Dullea and Gary Lockwood appear in 2001. But most important that there is a pretty good balance of personal stories and behind-the-scenes information, to such an extent that the audio commentary never becomes at all dull, because sometimes audio commentaries aren't really worth your time, but this is a really good one. So all in all this audio commentary is a must listen, as both actors are so informative about all aspects on their experiences with the film 2001 and you will be spellbound by what you hear and it definitely get a 5 star rating from me.
