1843368,5,B00008G74S,"We love this dvd as well as #4-5-6.  These series are great for kids who love trains or things with wheels in general, and I think they're entertaining for adults as well.  Love the commentary (learn a lot!) and love the music!  My kids watch them over and over.",1264982400,2,262,4.3061224489795915

1843371,5,B00008G74S,"My 3 year old grandson has enjoyed the entire series, but I feel the 7,8,9, is just a little ahead of his comprehension.  However, he still request seeing it and at this rate will be enjoying more each day.  This is the best train series for children on the market!!!",1126137600,4,267,4.32
1843372,5,B00008G74S,"He loves this one as much as he does volumes 4-6. The whole family learns lots from these movies, and I just know ds will be watching them even longer than the Thomas movies.

He's getting Toy Trains & Christmas (Vol 1, 2, 3) on dvd from the same company for Christmas.",1098489600,,269,4.173076923076923
7982673,5,B00008G74S,My 4 year old Landon loves this DVD!,1480982400,,36,3.625
7982674,5,B00008G74S,"Just as everyone else has mentioned, my 3 year old is totally engrossed with this DVD. But having seen parts 1 through 12 myself, I will add a further endorsement that parts 7 through 9 are indeed the cream of the crop. Part 8 is particularly strong with its incorporation of bloopers. It also captures perhaps the most engaging narration on the part of Jeff the house boy narrator. The strength of the whole series is non stop action. Each clip only lasts 5-10 seconds. There are no boring lulls with adults talking. Background music abounds. This is exactly what a toddler boy relishes in. Enjoy!",1469577600,,598,4.650943396226415

7982680,5,B00008G74S,Don't know that I'd buy the whole series but we had 1 and 3 given as a gift so thought we'd try this.  It is predictably full of interesting toy train model layouts and displays.

Personally, the movie drives me crazy, but my four year old and one year are in love.  It's pretty educational too.  This is his favorite volume too.",1275004800,,270,4.448979591836735
