1393131,5,B0000541AL,"An unsuspecting family of ranchers takes in a woman named Susan Heller (Andrea Roth) after she claims to have been in a car accident. Of course, the viewers know that Susan has just committed a cold-blooded murder by sticking an icepick through some poor guy's heart! This guy just happens to have been a ranch hand on the very ranch that Susan has now ""stumbled"" upon. Susan is a woman on a mission, and the family has no idea that she knows who they are. She's also brought along her childhood doll, and she talks to it...a lot! The only one who is suspicious of Susan is the daughter. She smells a rat. Everyone else is oblivious. Junior even takes Susan to his cave hideaway, and shows her the bottomless pit he's discovered! Of course, no one else knows about it, and it could come in mighty handy for Susan! It's pretty obvious what Susan's up to, and why she's picked this particular family. Still, the tension builds well, and Roth's character is sly and diabolical. She's eeevil, and doesn't have any qualms about killing anyone in her way. THE STEPDAUGHTER is a perfectly suspenseful thriller...",1389657600,10,1105,4.642857142857143
1393132,4,B0000541AL,This was as good as I remember.  A bit far fetched . . . like duh.  It's a good movie for background noise,1377302400,,106,3.5652173913043477
1393133,4,B0000541AL,"Meet Susan Heller (Andrea Roth).  She's beautiful, sexy, smart, crazy as bat excrement, and I LIKE her!  Susan is a very angry woman.  Her birth mother gave her up for adoption after her father was killed in Vietnam, so Susan has tracked her and her family down in revenge for the awful childhood she had in various foster homes.  One thing is for sure; nothing is going to get in her way. Not the ranch hand she has to kill in order to get his job on the family's land, not the ranch foreman who has lusty designs on her, not the nurse who recognizes her as Karen from the mental hospital, and certainly not her stepsister Linda who doesn't like her from the very start.  After all, what recourse do you have left when nobody will give you a job because you were in a mental institution on account of all the damage done?

She charms her way into the family by faking a car accident, earning all but Linda's trust, and carrying on dialog with the doll she's had since she was a child.  Yup.  Ooh-wee-ooh!  Needless to say, Linda is checking her out behind her back while she's busy saying those crazy comical things after each murder, not unlike in Daddy's Girl and Devil in the Flesh.  It's  all quite predictable, and Gil Gerrard isn't in one of his most shining moments as her stepfather, but thanks to Andrea Roth's excellent performance as a deranged psychopath, the movie is fun and worth a watch or two.  While I felt sorry for her birth mother and the slow son named Buddy, I was irritated by Linda's meddling until close to the end.  LOL, I was actually rooting for our Susan until she gave her mother that bath.  If you get the chance, check this one out.  You won't be surprised, but you'll be entertained in a Lifetime with bad language campy sort of way.",1350864000,2,1768,4.380368098159509

don't recommend it to me a bad picture.",1175472000,,87,4.117647058823529
1393136,4,B0000541AL,"When you dispose of a solid script, you have reached the half of the victory. The plot concerns about an awful personal disgrace. When an innocent creature is abandoned by her mother due religious, moral and social prejudices (the mother was pregnant by his lover who died in Vietnam), then she will be adopted and his stepfather will sexually abuse of her.

Around all this somber landscape of repressed rage and impotence state, this child will become woman and she will intend by all her means to find her biological mother. Since this achieved aim, a very carefully plain will be set in motion, seeking for revenge.

An effective and chilling movie where the good guys after all are not absolutely innocent. Good performances. A picture above the average.

1393137,2,B0000541AL,"It is difficult to summarize this movie without explaining the entire plot in one or two sentences. There is a small twist at the end that differentiates it from others, but this is so minor and comes so late it is difficult to accept or care. Essentially, we are treated to an opening that introduces us to Susan Heller (played by Andrea Roth, who despite being in movies such as this has quiet a following online) who stumbles into the lives of a ranching family when his car ""breaks down"". She manages to win the trust of the husband (played by Gil Gerard - yes, Buck Rogers himself - who shows us all just how low you can sink) and gets a job. However, the sister does not believe her (as the formula dictates) from the very beginning, and sets out to discover the truth behind Susan.",1016582400,3,788,4.36734693877551

1393145,3,B0000541AL,"*** 3 Stars *** A 1999 film that perfectly, almost lovingly, recreates the feel of a late 70's / early 80's made-for-TV thriller.  Everything from the music and the pacing, to the arc of the simple story, to the high-waisted jeans and flowered wallpaper, just fits.  A fine homage to the many forgotten 'B' movies of TV's past.  So why should you watch it?  It's just fun, and a great rush of nostalgia for some of us.  The old, pre-cable,  made-for-TV films were a special genre.  The stories were simple - the initial production pitch was just a sentence or two - so the challenge was to structure the flick to keep viewer's attention through the inevitable commercial breaks ... every 12 minutes or so.  The viewer has to want to see 'what happens next' - and this flick, ""Stepdaughter,"" is actually structured just like that.  While pacing is slow, there's a new little twist or reveal every 10 minutes or so, and so you do want to keep watching.  I liked it, personally, and if any of this review makes sense to you, perhaps you'll like it, too.  I loved  the overall vibe!  Thanks for reading.",1474675200,2,1099,4.517766497461929

The entire movie is enjoyable, but don't expect to find out the exact reasons why, or what exactly is wrong with her. That's something i usually want in a movie about someone seeking revenge, i want a bit more of an explanation, but that's fine, we can show various horse scenes instead.",1456704000,,600,4.504587155963303

It is always the same plot with these type of movies. Not only that the birth mother is usually still alive and living very well off with other children.  In this case the birth mother was ill, but was wealthy and had two other children.  Which one was a daughter who did not look too much younger then the daughter set up for adoption. I do know  but I think that probably that would get me mad. .
The character had a doll she took with her everywhere and talked to. So we now know she is cray.  Some interesting things happen which I will not tell because you might as well not see the movie.

Anyway, thank you for the movie-I always wondered why people act the way they do especially when it affects them psychologically in the past. It is movies like this that is interesting.

The two main main chicks (I assume they weren't Trans-Binary-Whatever back then) are attractive, always a plus.
