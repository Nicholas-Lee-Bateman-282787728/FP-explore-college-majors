8149714,5,B000JBXHFU,"I have never seen a Modern Marvels documentary that I didn't like and this is no exception. I don't want to rehash what the other reviewers wrote, so I will make this short. If you are interested in stealth (both air and sea), this is a great documentary to watch. As usual with this series of documentaries, the visuals coupled with expert explanations makes it easy for the layman to understand how this technology works.

It isn't 100% complete as some aspects are top secret (no real surprise there) but they do a good job with what the military gave them. Definitely worthwhile to check out.",1270771200,3,596,4.622641509433962
8149715,5,B000JBXHFU,"""Stealth Technology"" provides a good overview of the rationale for and the development of stealth technology - primarily in the Air Force, but also including concepts implemented into new Navy ships.  The result, for airplanes, is a radar signature less than that of a sparrow.  (I'm assuming that means enemy radar would have to become much more powerful to detect such a small entity; however, I've never been aware of any information on how difficult that would be.)

Reducing radar signature is achieved through radar-absorbing materials (eg. carbon-fiber), flat panels, saw-toothed edging on doors, and specialized canopy covering.  The discovery of a Russian technological paper on software prediction of radar reflectivity was quite helpful in developing initial U.S.A.F. stealth planes.  Also helpful was the fact that the SR-71, developed for the CIA, already had considerable stealth technology built into it.  The ""bad news"" about the diamond-shaped F-117 bomber (named the ""Hopeless Diamond"" while in concept stage) was that it was aerodynamically unstable and required computers and fly-by-wire technology to fly.

Second-generation stealth planes used rounded surfaces that were more more aerodynamic.

The last part of ""Stealth Technology"" covers the SeaShadow naval concept vessel.  Not only was it important to minimize radar signature, but sonar, noise (eg. rubber engine mounts), and wake detectability (use of thin double hull) as well.  Lessons learned in its construction have since been applied to new ships.

First information about stealth airplanes was not released until years after their production.  Thus, one is left wondering what is in the pipeline today.",1221350400,3,1687,5.572549019607843
8149716,5,B000JBXHFU,"To my best knowledge, this is the first DVD to specifically cover this topic. It introduces the background, motivation, principle, and impact of stealth technology very well. People without solid electromagnetic understanding can enjoy it. Even people with related expertise will think it worthwhile to put it in their DVD collections.

You can see most stealth aircraft such as F-117, B-2, F-22, F-35, and RAH-66 in this film. Even UAV's and stealth ships (Sea Shadow) are included. The development of F-117 dominates in this DVD due to its historic importance. The significance of Russian scientist Ufimtsev's paper influencing F-117 is also mentioned. B-2 and F-22 are the next to draw notice for the topic of stealth in this film. On the whole, I think this DVD balances the historic and technical roles very well. It goes smoothly during all running time.

I am not a big fan of THC most of the time. But this one is an exception. I am surprised it meets, or is even beyond, my expectation after I have watched it in 50 minutes since I don't think this topic can be well-organized and contented in such a short time at the beginning. But they made it and I can't ask for more.

Bring one home as soon as possible. It will not disappoint you.",1169596800,10,1246,4.680365296803653
