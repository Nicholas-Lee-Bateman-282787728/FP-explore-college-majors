8434073,5,B000VL3Q5O,"Our Kingdom Come is a great b-horror film right out of Boston, MA! It's creepy, funny, and action-packed. The characters are interesting and unique as is the plot- something that does not always accompany b-horror films. I say check it out without a doubt!",1189296000,,256,4.840909090909091
