8491453,3,B0062RY394,"Love Crimes of Kabul, directed by Tanaz Eshaghian, released in 2011, follows the stories of three women at the Badam Bagh Women's Prison located in Kabul, Afghanistan jailed for ""moral crimes."" These crimes include running away from home, adultery and premarital sex. We follow these women's journeys from their pre-trail prison experience to their sentencing.  Through these stories we are given a very small look at the justice system of a country that blends their religious ideals with their moral conduct.  The women in this documentary range from late teens to mid-life and their crimes vary from pregnancy from premarital sex to running away from home and seeking refuge in a neighbor's house which could earn them a sentence of 20 years in prison.

The function of the documentary is to portray how honor is restored in a society that possesses such strict rules of conduct. Although these inmates are painted as immoral, corruptors of society, there are very few times the viewers feel sympathy toward these women.  Western audiences would celebrate these women because it offers a very stereotypical view of Afghani society, but a more informed viewer would question the myopic choice of characters.",1370908800,,1209,5.153061224489796
8491454,4,B0062RY394,Good documentary on love in Afghanistan. I had no idea that people could be imprisoned for crimes based on morality and both men AND women are held accountable.,1364601600,,160,4.75
8491455,4,B0062RY394,"This HBO film straightforwardly documents the Afghan theocracy's soulless treatment of women (and men) who show human affection and express the love in their hearts.  Moreover, it reveals how religion-based laws have corrupted those relationships into exploitative prostitution, and turned  judges, clerics, parents and relatives into pimps.
I found myself wondering which of these sad figures would rather be shed of religious strictures entirely, and which would gladly join the firing squad.
Bleak subject presented with a delicate soundtrack make for a very sad film indeed.",1323561600,,578,5.709302325581396
