4124943,4,B003HC9JJ6,"I love this dvd, but I can't give it 5 stars. :(  My only complaint is that Leslie does not use all new background music.  Some of the songs are repeated on her other fitness dvds.",1277251200,3,180,3.9722222222222223
4124944,5,B003HC9JJ6,"I can't praise this lady's walking exercise enough. It has helped reverse the effects of my last heart attack. Walking exercise, diet, Rx, and prayer has eliminated traces of the last heart attack, with the exception of the stent. A true program for the heart patient. Now even the American Heart Association is recommending the walking with Leslie Sansone. She makes exercise easy, but it's still the needed aerobic workout, and at individualized level adaptability. You don't have to be a dancer to do this DVD.

You can add or subtract movement as needed to fit the stepping exercise to your own needs and ability for any particular day. I found it more low-impact friendly than the paved walking trail in our local park. Yes, with the DVD I work up a sweat, expected too in rehab. This is an inexpensive, equipment-free, method to reproduce cardio-rehabilitation success in your own home, at a fraction of the cost. I'd recommend the supervised rehab first, then Leslie for the rest of your life for continued heart-healthy living. Don't forget the diet, she stresses that too. This DVD also will take off some pounds, a positive side effect for every cardio patient.

Come to think of it, this cardio friendly DVD is also just what any health conscious person could use. Weight loss, toned muscle, aerobics, stretching, it's all there and presented in a friendly, non-threatening manner. Good for any age, any ability. The program is adjustable...daily.

This is a longer walking DVD, a companion to ""Start! Walking with Leslie Sansone 1 & 2 Mile Walk"". I recommend both, begin slower, 1 mile, 2 miles, work into the 3 mile, but you will do it quickly, IF you really use these DVDs daily. We did, my wife and I. She does it for routine weight & health maintainability. And my encouragement, God Bless her. We're hooked on Sansone DVDs at age 60+.",1276560000,51,1851,4.7962382445141065
4124945,5,B003HC9JJ6,"These DVD's are great! The 1 mile is beginner-intermediate and a good starting point. It will get your heart-rate up. The 2 mile is perfect for me in the early AM before work...30 minutes of walking to energize me for the day. The 3 mile is more advanced, though it is easily adaptable if you aren't quite at this level yet. Just make the moves less intense..or take the arm movements out. You will work up to it. Leslie Sansone's workouts are perfect for people who don't want to do higher impact as this ends up being too hard on your joints as you get older. Walking is the best all around exercise for cardiovascular health. Leslie takes it up a notch by adding more movement..side steps, knee lifts, kick-backs, tap outs. I am very pleased with these DVD's. I have a collection of her DVD's...from beginner to advanced. Try these! You won't be disappointed.",1274572800,16,862,4.567741935483871
4124946,4,B003HC9JJ6,"This is a go-to walk for me on days when I don't have much motivation.  It's 3 miles in around 45 minutes, and includes Leslie's classic moves:  walking, side steps, knee lifts, and kicks.  There are no ""boosters"" in this walk; it's just you and Leslie.  The studio set is clean and classic; it's Exercise TV's set so different from Leslie's usual walk studio.  There's some talk about the benefits of exercise for the heart, which is motivating.  What I love the most, though, is the countdown clock in the upper right corner.  It winds backwards as you walk, and on those days you just don't want to work out, it helps a lot to literally see the time winding down.  I'm an intermediate exerciser and this definitely gets my heart rate up, but doesn't leave me feeling exhausted.",1272672000,82,780,4.561151079136691
4124967,5,B003HC9JJ6,"Stumbled on this when it was available on demand through some service.

4124989,5,B003HC9JJ6,"I rented this workout on Amazon Prime Video to see if I'd like it before I bought the DVD, and I really enjoyed this workout. Leslie is not obnoxious and it clipped along at a great pace. The time went by quickly, and the beat to stepping ratio went well together. Nothing too over-the-top but not a too-slow paced workout either.  You can go along at whatever pace you want, and still get a lot out of it.",1455580800,,406,4.205128205128205
4124990,5,B003HC9JJ6,"Great new moves.  Liked the idea of Just Leslie,  Kept focus on exercising and not on what others were doing
or speaking.",1454630400,3,121,4.454545454545454
4124991,5,B003HC9JJ6,"I love this workout! The steps are very easy but Leslie ups the intensity and pace to really get you sweating. It's great for cardio and you could easily incorporate some small hand weights or weighted gloves during the earlier, slower pace. The workout is 45 minutes long with a decent warm-up and cool down. If I had one gripe about this DVD, and it's a small one, it's the 2 logos forever present on the bottom of the screen. It's not a huge problem, just annoying, but the countdown clock on the upper left is very handy. I also really appreciate that Leslie does this workout alone, without the usual class of walkers behind her. So no giggling or kibitzing going on, just a great one-on-one power walk with her. Highly recommended!",1448668800,2,737,4.548872180451128

4125010,5,B003HC9JJ6,"I love Leslie! I have four of her videos. She's so encouraging and happy, not like some other videos, where they tell you that if you're not vomiting or spitting blood you're not really exercising. I work up a good sweat and feel good the whole time. If you're looking to get back into exercising and don't know where to start or are intimidated by all the muscled drill sergeant videos out there, Leslie is the way to go.",1437436800,2,422,4.3544303797468356
4125011,5,B003HC9JJ6,"Great system, it really works.  Walk away the pounds sounds very low key.  But you can really get a sweat up!  Great value.  The reason I bought mine is the local classes are so popular you have to get a spot in the gymn an hour ahead of time.

4125014,5,B003HC9JJ6,"I really enjoyed this. I did it while getting the kids ready in the morning. By the time I was finished I had met 5K of my 10K steps for the day. I like that I didn't have to listen to the video to do the work and I could modify if I needed too. Is more about getting the steps in than doing anything which requires coordination or fancy footwork. I would highly recommend it for anyone who wants to walk. Obviously, if you are a marathon runner this may not be what you are looking for.",1429228800,,487,3.979591836734694

4125042,5,B003HC9JJ6,"Wonderfully simple walking exercises that you can do at home without any additional equipment (I just use a yoga mat to pad my walking space).  Leslie is encouraging and cheerful, and the pace is effective and more importantly, healthy.  It's all about moderation, with intense portions that are not over the top like those PX90 hyped videos.  This is a timeless keeper that steers clear of any strain or injury to your body.  I speak as someone who has had a herniated lumbar disc from over-exercise.  This video is helping me stay fit through rehab.  Thank you so much Leslie!

4125070,5,B003HC9JJ6,I love this DVD! It is perfect for anyone wanting to get healthier but not necessarily motivated to invest time and energy into complicated dance moves. It's great because you can be a beginner or more advanced and still get a great workout.,1413763200,,241,4.627906976744186
4125071,5,B003HC9JJ6,"For me, this is an excellent workout ! Leslie walk workout is simple and easy to follow.  I've been doing Jane Fonda's recent exercise dvd's for quite sometime and needed to change up my morning exercises.  It gets 'sweaty' as Leslie says and I'm ready for a good, heart healthy exercise dvd.  She delivers.  I also have her HITS walk dvd which incorporates HIgh Intensity Interval Training.  That also is an excellent walk dvd with a little bit extra.  Since starting Leslie's walk program, I have noticed a difference in my body and how my clothes fit so much better.  My husband and daughter even noticed how much ""thinner"" I have gotten !! How's that ! More importantly - I need to exercise for my health after being diagnosed w/Type 2 diabetes.  I am determined to maintain my health, to live a longer life and doing Leslie's walk program is helping me do that.  This is an excellent exercise program and I highly recommend it.

She is so down to earth and easy to follow.  I have now purchased my 7th Leslie DVD (Start!) and think it's wonderful!  It's a very brisk 3 mile walk and I easily get over 6,000 miles by completing the DVD.

This is a classic Leslie 3 mile walk; no boosters, no hand weights, no stretchie band....just the good ol' walking in place, side steps, knee lifts, kick backs, tap outs, etc.  It is a perfect 45 minute workout (warm up & stretch included).  I substituted a lot of the side steps with side to side squats for more intensity (and to add some strength training).  This is the 17th Leslie DVD I've purchased; I use Leslie's DVDs to help maintain my weight loss.  I just love her!!

Oh, and I really like the walk clock; I personally like to see how much time I have left in the workout.  I wish Leslie would incorporate the clock into her newer DVDs.",1393804800,7,683,4.330708661417323

The time passes quickly and the pace of the music creates the potential to get the heart rate going if you put some effort into the workout.

Some folks have commented that the music is terrible, and maybe that's so, but I love how a lot of the songs are rip offs of more famous techno/pop hits.  There's one in particular that sounds like the Night at the Roxbury song!  Leslie is really earnest, upbeat and charming--which works most of the time.  But I treasure this for the absolute convenience that it is when traveling--no DVDs, no space, no equipment, no nothing.

4125165,5,B003HC9JJ6,"Never thought I would write a review for a product, but here it goes! I am 31 yrs old, and have always been over-weight. I've tried several ""diets"" over the years, with minimum results. Finally a switch went off and I can finally say that I am truly ready to loose the weight.

I like going to the gym, but it is hard for me to continuously get there, for a couple reasons 1) the time 2) lack of motivation. So I decided with winter sneaking up on us, I knew that I really wouldn't be going to the gym, bud didn't want that to be an excuse. So I decided why not try a walking dvd that I can do in my own living room, rain, snow or shine. No excuses accepted!

I've been using this dvd for about a month now along with a diet, and I've lost about 11 lbs. I remember hearing about Leslie Sansone in the past, so I decided to give it a try. I use this DVD mostly along with occasion-lay some other DVD's just to break it up a little bit. I try to work out 5 days a week. This DVD is great! So far my favorite one yet, and I find it challenging enough without a doubt. I feel exhausted after using it, but not to the point that I am about to pass out. Can't decide if I like the clock in the picture, sometimes I find it more difficult when I see the clock if I'm struggling a bit with not wanting to do it. Leslie is great though, she works you out to the max (I think I'm a pro-beginner, average intermediate) with working out. The steps are not hard to do, but you really feel the results as your doing them. Only negative I have to say about this DVD is the music, but that's just me. Wish they chose better music to go with it.",1350604800,7,1628,3.93030303030303

Just Leslie alone which is always a plus for me however I only dif the video one time bc if there I have many other dvds of hers that I can get a lot more intense cardio workout in & even 4 miles in the same amount of time.

The first mile is a good pace ... not too fast, not too slow.

The second mile really picks up the pace ... your heart rate rises and you really start to sweat.

The third mile begins where the second mile left off (with the raised heart rate and big energy), and finishes with a nice cool-down and some brief stretching.

4125195,5,B003HC9JJ6,"I own this video and two other Leslie Sansone videos, 4 mile super challenge and 5 mile fat burning walk. At one point I used to walk 9 miles a day which took me 3 hours to do 5 days a week (yes, I obsessed), but I stopped when I was pregnant last year. After having my baby, I gained some weight and decided it was time to start working out again so I tried this. I thought this would be a piece of cake after my past walking experience and when I tried it I couldn't believe how much it kicked my butt. This is so much more than just walking because it has you doing knee lifts and side steps and hamstring curls, this is a better work out than just walking in terms of heart rate and calorie burn. So I thought I would order the 4 and 5 mile work outs to amp up the intensity as I get into shape more, but surprisingly I found that when I did the 4 and 5 mile videos they were not as challenging as this 3 mile one! Even though they are longer in length, your heart rate drops because the moves are spaced apart more. I found that even though this video is shorter, the intensity of it makes me sweat more and my heart rate stays up through the whole thing which at times on the other videos I barely feel challenged and am not breathing heavy at times. Its not really about miles because miles are different for everyone anyway depending on how tall you because your steps are bigger or smaller. Time may be more the issue, meaning a longer work out may give you a better calorie burning work out in some ways, but in terms of intensity and calorie burning, this one seems to be the best one in my opinion. Some days I do this video along with one of the others or I'll do this one twice. She keeps you moving from one set of moves to the next constantly and I find the knee lifts while reaching across your body to be the most intense moves along with the high kicks. This is a really good video for people like me who don't like workout dvds with 'dancey moves' as Leslie calls them. Because I have two left feet and I find that most aerobics dvds (cough, cough, D-e-n-i-s-e A-u-s-t-i-n...cough) are made for people who are already in tip top shape and who are aparently professional dancers who don't have to look at the tv screen to follow along. I like Leslie's personality too, some people seem to find her annoying, but I think she's likeable. Also, I do think her other two videos that I mentioned are good too, I like them and I use them, they have their merits as well, its just as far as intensity goes, this one seems to be the most intense for me.",1324252800,29,2564,4.119760479041916

4125201,5,B003HC9JJ6,"I would consider this a classic Sansone DVD in the sense that she uses all of the same moves that she normally does for her walking workouts: side steps, knee lifts, kicks. It's a five star though, because she really gives you a good workout, with a solid warm-up, workout, and then cool down period. I have a majority of her recent DVDs and would rank this as a favorite, because it is more intermediate than some of the others, and has a countdown clock, which I enjoy looking at. The entire workout, from start to finish, is about 45 minutes and covers 3 miles. You can't select chapters, so you pretty much have to stick with the entire routine. The music is a bit ho-hum, but the set is 'fresh' and doesn't look the same as from her previous videos. Also, Leslie is alone the whole time, with no workout partners. She talks way too much, and if there is one thing I wish they'd include on her DVDs it'd be the option for music only so you don't have to hear her. I seem to select this DVD quite a lot, and think it's one of her better newer releases.",1307664000,4,1055,4.227722772277228

It's a big step up (energy wise) from the two-mile workout. It's also 45 minutes of your time. My wife and I have been doing it five times a week - and it's giving me a lot of energy and I think I've even lost an inch on my waistline too! Leslie makes it fun, and the first and third miles go pretty fast - the second mile (for some reason) is the tough one!",1306972800,4,489,3.803921568627451
4125203,3,B003HC9JJ6,"I own 4 other Leslie's DVDs and have borrowed all others from my local library.  For the 45 minutes I did with the DVD, I could only detect one modified exercise move -- tapping with alternate heels in front, instead of tapping to the side; and one modified stretch move -- reaching up with alternate arms.  So, if you have already owned her DVDs, save your money and wait for one that is more innovative with new moves.  Alas, Leslie only demonstrates new moves in the bonus section -- side squats with hand weights, a sit-down stretch and a lay-down stretch.  How about, for the next DVD, prompting the viewer to use hand weights at appropriate times? Add interval training? Add pilates moves?  I need to be trained with Leslie during exercise, not to watch a bonus section afterwards.
Other observations -- Leslie talks non-stop; I am OK with that by turning the TV volume low.  No exercise buddies such as Barb or Stephanie.  The room decor is new, simple, and bright -- good.",1302912000,12,980,4.597701149425287

I did like that Leslie seemed extra focused in this video; sometimes, I have a hard time figuring out what she is laughing at in her other videos. She seems to get off track when she is being silly. She talks about the benefits of exercise while timing the workout to the countdown clock. Her exercise clocks seem to make the workouts go faster.

I do not like her choice of music and all her tapes have the same songs. Leslie is a little annoying she forgets she is exercising and her mouth will continue.

4125226,4,B003HC9JJ6,"I have several of Leslie's DVDs and am using my experience with the other DVDs as the basis of my review of this DVD.

Here's what I love:

- The pace of this one is faster than many of the others. Quickly gets my heart rate up and keeps it there for half an hour.
- Typical easy-to-follow Leslie steps.
- The clock in upper left corner counts down to the end of the video.
- It's Leslie all by herself.
- It includes some good tips for stretching, and exercising, etc.

Here's what I'd change:

- The American Heart Association and Exercise TV logos are visual clutter at the bottom of the screen.
- There are ads at the beginning of the DVD, like a movie DVD. Takes extra time in the morning (before work) to fast forward through them. Could live without that.
- The camera work is ""fancier"" than the DVDs of Leslie in her studio in Pennsylvania. Lots of swooping, and panning in and out. I prefer the simpler camera work for a workout DVD.

Neutral comments:

- The quality of Leslie's DVDs filmed from her studio seem to be better. This DVD looks blurry in places--it reminds me of cheap children's cartoons where they compress the files and then you can really see the pixels.

Changes and neutral comments aside, I'm still glad I bought this DVD, and will probably buy another copy as a gift for my mom because it's a fantastic workout.",1280448000,12,1342,4.365461847389558

This one isn't at the top of my favorite list, but it is a nice one to have to just simply squeak in a walk or to introduce someone to walking at home. I often pair this one with one of her other 3 or 4 mile walk videos. If I simply don't feel like walking at home, but know I should, this is the one I reach for.",1516665600,,738,3.9864864864864864
