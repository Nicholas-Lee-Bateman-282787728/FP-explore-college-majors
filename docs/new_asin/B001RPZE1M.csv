Seek and yea shall find, not accept and you will find. It takes an open mind and sincere effort to find truth.
Having studied the commonality of ideals of capitalistic democracy, communism and religion worldwide its disconcerting to find throughout the ages the majority of resources serving extravagance, hierarchy and consolidation of power often achieved and maintained through the exploitation, depredation and ignorance of the common man  - Not to mention the persecutions and ravages caused by related warfare.
Such social entities go great lengths to create the perception of order from chaos, then fill in the discontinuities with canned patriotism, the requirement of faith to obtain eternal life, or worse avoid eternal hell.
It seems many people need structure, ritual, definition  ...an iconic supernatural entity to embellish, plead their cares to, worship And integral reward system to derived security from being destined for eternal life.
Although within all creeds and religions there are exceptional individuals with characteristics and values worthy of emulation, its common to project lesser human qualities unto the character of the divine and worship, cater too and regulate others accordingly while depending on divine intervention instead of taking personal responsibility to create a sustainable world and purifying ones motives while realistically aspire to whatever brings about the greatest possible harmony for all things.
Must we subscribe to exclusive assumptions without reservation and continually seed the beds of worldwide ecological disaster, convolution, divisiveness and strife?
... And why not goodness for its own sake? What could be simpler, more purifying, self-affirming, divine in character ...and to the point!

Religions with by far with the greatest following are those having integral reward systems i.e. those that promise eternal bliss and other incentives for adhering to an assumed supreme doctrine. Though there are those of religious orientation with admirable motives, many delude themselves of having genuine love/devotion, the real fascination and motivation deriving primarily from celebrity like status and power of religious figures and promise of an eternally blissful after-life. Take away the embellishments: Business-as-usual insurance policy.

 Secure in being raptured and eternity bound beliefs based on faith rather than proven fact manifest into serious threats from a third of the world not sharing fully responsibility for critical issues such as over-population, environmental degradation and general long-term planetary sustainability.

 Personally I find the conventional Christian concept of salvation and crucification baffling. Was Christs sacrifice originally divine or necessary could such a love for humanity been demonstrated inspiringly yet in a less harsh, debt laden manner?

Unlike Christ with decisive foreknowledge of knowing where he came from and going Im didn't submit being born into a world of contradiction, confusion, injustice and chaos. I just want the opportunity to be accepted as an imperfect work in progress and live modestly in peace and harmony - Which should be an inherent birth-right for all things ...so is there a logical reason to be beholding or saved?

 If there be a divine entity he would not have the petty traits, egotism, subjugations, and inflexible technical judgments projected onto him by people, but qualities of compassionate commonality.

Regardless of orientation it would seem cultivating an open heart, mind, progressive nature and aspirational focus on whatever brings about the greatest possible harmony to all things without further expectation of reward the more essential integral qualifying, comprehensive, and purifying essence of spirituality and human potential.

Devastating Perfection: Many find reason to question the existence of an all-powerful God with so much suffering having occurred to the innocent throughout the ages. Was Jesus wondrously delusional in a beautiful way? Did his disciples pass on biases or exaggerate to have a personal sense of power, security and everlasting future or many thereafter delete, distort embellish to feel special, superior, exploit otherwise? Bearing in mind faith is just that; faith not fact, leaves one with the premise that if there is some kind of divine order then lifes primary purpose is to learn and evolve to interact harmoniously. Though there can be no doubt for those of progressive inclination living is a great character building, many experiences seem pointless and even cruel still there is hope: For just as its unreasonable to assume the existence of the divine, its also to conclude its non-existence, for as myself, many people around the world regardless of religion or otherwise have had similar miraculous experiences with a common thread with no other possible explanation other than being of divine origin (i.e. see oberf.org). Having exhausted logical explanations, could inexplicable chaos and confusion serve a greater purpose of purification of motive and goodness for its own sake in other words regardless of what the future may hold aspiring to whatever manifests the greatest harmony for all things and therefore our greater and truer salvation as a planet, race and individual?

The perils of deferring to and not questioning authority: An experiment was conducted in which randomly selected people were chosen to sit in front of an electrical panel and told to give electrical shocks for the sake of beneficial research of up to 1500 volts to an unseen person on the other side. Almost all participants gave the maximum voltage when told to continue even when the person being shocked pleaded for them to stop (although acting).
Ive witnessed similar behavior when people are given unbridled control over others. Historical therere many examples such as the God sanctioned Old Testament genocides (including women and children), Nazi purges, and religious inquisitions in which entire cities de-populated and millions tortured horrendously, yet I often hear those of prejudicial or limited fundalmentalistic religious belief advocating and actively enabling narrow views to become incorporate as principles in government  - Despite such icons as Jesus exemplifying and advising to the contrary.
We must always maintain vigilance and separation of state and national politics from religion, narrow-mindedness and bigotry or be at peril from the self-righteous mob or what may seem like our normal or pious neighbors who may haplessly concede personal responsibility and commit atrocity.
Our country is drifting towards fascism and otherwise. We need the elect the likes of too-big-to-fail busters like Teddy Roosevelt to rein-in pay-to-play politics, corporate robber-barons, banksters, the Supreme Corporate Court, drug/health industry, industrial military lobby complex, and tax exempt free-loading ruling classes preying on the common person A Robin Hood to return ill-gotten-gains. A Martin Luther King to tackle revived racism, ultra-conservatism, A Robert Kennedy to restrain Latino exploitation, runaway elitist crime and inspire us to rise above self-centered apathy and become active in bringing balance back to our economy, healthcare, political institutions and nation as a whole.
Antidote for what may be a godless world: If we find transcendent beauty and compassion in ourselves and examples elsewhere then surely in the vastness of the universe are evolved worlds, dimensions and beings of empathy that have manifested such benevolent harmonious qualities sustainably.

Such certainty assures great possibilities here and beyond for beings throughout the cosmos of progressive inclination.",1428537600,,8191,5.60016155088853
8338498,4,B001RPZE1M,I would have given this program 5 stars but the crazy heavy metal guitar between segments was annoying. I thought they could have dwelt on the Druid influence on religious holidays. Its been hard to completely convert groups of peoples around the world to think the way Rome wanted every convert to practice accordingly. You can see even in the lower America's that they have some spooky holidays where they use skulls that may be decorated and so on. Like the Christmas tree from an old German tradition. I think a whole movie dedicated to the subject could be made but early Christian movement believed that these old traditions were the devils makings and that it was the Church's duty to convert the heathen. Its very good but more content could have been added. I would recommend the program to a friend.,1413158400,,809,4.704225352112676

8338500,5,B001RPZE1M,"it does not substantiate all it's points, because it's more entertainment oriented and covers thousands of years of religious history. However, I found it to be a decent one hour summary of WHY I don't ""believe"" in a literal devil/satan.

Shows the common thread going all the way back past Zoroastrianism, which I know believe is responsible for greatly altering world religions Judiasm, Christianity, and later Islam. Pronounced influence of other local beliefs imposing on greater scheme of people of the book.

Demonstrates clear superstition permeating religions of the book(s). It does NOT substantiate all it's claims from professors in world religion though: you will have to use this as a summary tool and not the meat of each contribution to the whole.",1407888000,,762,5.186991869918699
