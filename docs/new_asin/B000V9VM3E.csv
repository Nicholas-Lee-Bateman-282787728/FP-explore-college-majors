2934166,5,B000V9VM3E,"I am a hawk...so I knew how difficult it was to walk the fine
line that Richard did in order to perform as he did.
Many men owe their lives to his training...and if only kids
today were told they had to serve 2 years in the military with
this man as his teacher...what a better USA this would be. Thank you.",1371859200,4,307,3.967741935483871
2934167,5,B000V9VM3E,"I have read many of Richard Marcinko's Rogue Warrior books, and am quite thrilled to finally have a copy of the video Red Cell. If more videos become available, I would be among the first to add to Mr Marcinko's ""truck load of money"", and purchase one. The stories are great reading, and very informative of the ""behind the scenes"" training, tactics and activities that we, the readers, are not usually aware of. Other great authors, such as Tom Clancy have done a fine job in story-telling, but Mr Marcinko takes his storis one (or several) step(s) further into the realm of realistic, and believable.",1343433600,5,602,4.742857142857143
2934168,5,B000V9VM3E,"I have long awaited this production to be put in a DVD format. The production quality isn't top notch, but the raw video footage of Red Cell operations, and the insight into physical security exploitation is worth the watch. This production is not for the kiddos though, as it contains strong language (imagine that), violence, and some slight nudity. The examination and demonstration about how high-tech security can be compromised by defeating or deceiving the human mind element is powerful and instructional. I would highly recommend this film to anyone in the security industry. Red Cell operations are a valuable security assessment tool and should be used to test and discover weaknesses in all types of security measures.",1341446400,8,730,5.194915254237288
2934169,5,B000V9VM3E,"A great DVD showing how unsafe our military instalations are and the punishment the real heros received for doing their job. Political Correctness as well as Liberalism is a Severe Mental Disorder, unless you are an enemy of the USA and our US Constitution then it all makes sense.",1305849600,11,281,4.755102040816326

8217588,1,B000V9VM3E,The disk could not be read on either of two DVD/BluRay players by two different manufacturers; nor could it be read on either of two different  PCs.  That makes four devices on which the disk is unreadible.,1447027200,,206,4.54054054054054
8217589,3,B000V9VM3E,Quality of the video is not great. Looks like they took it from the VHS format and burned it to a DVD-R.  They do add a second video but it does not justify the price.,1402704000,,167,3.7714285714285714
