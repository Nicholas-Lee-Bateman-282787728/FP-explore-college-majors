4369921,5,B004FM2EL2,"First, to be clear: this is really an excellent series and a brilliant adaptation of William Boyd's book.

The following comments apply to the edited version of the series that was broadcast on PBS.  It is my hope that the US DVD will contain the full original UK version that is on the UK DVD.  The details of the US DVD, as they appear on Amazon at the time of writing this review, show a total run time of only 240 minutes on a single disc, versus 284 minutes on two discs in the UK DVD.  If the US details on Amazon are correct then the US DVD would be the edited version.  However, I am hoping that this is simply an error; and that the US DVD is, as it states on the image of the cover (and as other reviewers assert), the original 284-minute UK version.

The edited version of the series that was broadcast on PBS, although excellent by almost any standard, has lost a lot in the removal of about 15 minutes material per US episode (44 minutes in total), while being restructured as three episodes instead of the original four.  Some reviewers have stated that the cuts were primarily of explicit lovemaking scenes.  This is not the case.  Some lovemaking scenes were shortened, but not eliminated (except where they formed part of an entire section of the story that was cut).  If PBS's goal was simply to remove the more explicit parts of lovemaking scenes (plus a few four-letter words), the required cuts would have amounted to no more than 4 minutes, not 44 minutes.  PBS's primary goal seems to have been to fit the material into its Masterpiece Theatre 80-minute program slot (90 minutes with introductions, etc).  In other words, the mathematics of dividing 284 minutes by 80 is what drove the cuts.

The effect of the cuts was most pronounced in US Episode 1, where they have a significant impact on the pace of the production.  If you watch the original version of the material that goes into US Episode 1 (basically, the first original episode plus the first 17 minutes of the second original episode) and then watch the US Episode 1 (with 15 minutes of original material removed), the US version feels, by comparison, like an episode of ""24"".  In terms of pace, US Episodes 2 and 3 suffer less badly from editing because the cuts consist of larger sections of material, leaving the flow of what remains closer to the original.

Examples of particularly egregious cuts in US Episode 1 are: (a) At the start we see the old Logan having a heart attack; and then, suddenly and inexplicably, he is sorting through his old papers.  What was cut was his consultation with his doctor from which we realize that he may well die soon, hence the motivation for going through his old papers.  (b) Logan, in Paris, is with his favorite prostitute, Anna (note: he is about to leave and neither of them is naked), and this short scene establishes the significance of Anna as the foundation of the story for his first novel, The Girl Factory.  (c) Two scenes that explain why Logan's mother went from well-off to finding it hard to make ends meet - the first where she introduces to Logan her new financial advisor/boyfriend/maybe-conman, and the second where she tells Logan that she had invested most of her money in the US and it has all been lost in The Crash.  (d) The honeymoon with Lottie, where we see he is already having doubts.  And (e) Logan, with Freya, encounters Land in a pub.  He introduces Freya to Land, and Land whispers to Logan ""I approve"".

The most egregious cut made by PBS in the whole series is in US Episode 3 where not merely a sub-plot but a seven-and-a-quarter-minute section of main-plot was cut, namely, Logan's relationship with Monday, the girlfriend of his son who has just died at the end of US Episode 2.  This leaves the US viewer puzzled as to why, in a scene close to the end of the story (just before Logan's death), Monday's is one of the eight piles of papers and photographs (forming the accounts of his ""octet"" of wives and lovers, along with those of Tess, Land, Lottie, Freya, Allanah, Gloria, and Gabrielle) that Logan has laid out on the table, along with the empty folder that was to have contained his last novel, ""Octet"".

As others have commented, it is a great shame that PBS continues to edit UK series for reasons of program scheduling.  Let's hope that the US DVDs of these series continue to provide the full original UK versions (as was the case with Downton Abbey and I hope turns out to be the case for Any Human Heart).",1298592000,21,4485,4.526641883519207
4369922,5,B004FM2EL2,"I'm a big fan of Masterpiece Classic and I wasn't disappointed with ""Any Human Heart.""  It's a story that takes the viewer along the different stages of Logan Mountstuart's life.  Mountstuart is a writer with reasonable success until his life was devastated by the loss of his family during WWII. As Mountstuart ages, his life is marked by his association with different women who imparted certain truths that stayed with him.  He only realizes this near the end of his life as he was sorting through his personal effects.

What I like about the story is the idea that any person has a story to tell, loves that were lost, dreams that were extinguished.  I suppose that is why the book starts with a quote from Henry James ""Never say you know the last word about any human heart.""

The film is beautifully done and I'm impressed with the work that was put into the sets and clothes of the different time periods.  It was also enjoyable to see Mountstuart's encounters with real people like Ernest Hemingway and the Duke and Duchess of Windsor (exceptional performance by Gillian Anderson). Matthew MacFadyen did an excellent job.  His part was the most difficult stage of Mountstuart's life.  The film also has a surreal quality to it, especially when it shows Mountstuart's recurring dream of being a child on a boat and being watched by his different selves at different ages.  It was captivating and I watched the whole film through.",1297814400,52,1436,4.754032258064516
4369923,5,B004FM2EL2,"Sorry, but you are wrong about your review and the edited version for PBS.

This is a wonderful saga and I have seen both the unedited and edited version and really only the sex is edited out and nothing is lost because of it.  In fact, I found it is better as the edited version and one focuses much more on characters and storyline.

Matthew Macfadyen in particular is wonderful in this and I hope he wins a BAFTA and Emmy for his performance--just stellar.  Hayley Atwell is gorgeous and she makes a very nice match to him.  One thing that is a wee bit distracting is the different actors in one role but it is supposed to be three ""selves"" in one so one can imagine that.

All in all, it is a wonderfully made and quite engrossing series.  An added bonus is that Kim Cattrall, The Great Tom Hollander and Gillian Anderson all playing character roles to their greatest.

Definitely a five-star production.",1297814400,25,908,4.460606060606061
4369924,1,B004FM2EL2,"I believe that the length of the original British program is about five hours.  PBS (as usual) edited the film to fit into the length of the Masterpiece program (about 4 hours of actual film).  The specifications of the DVD that are listed above state that the DVD is four hours.  If this is true, PBS is releasing the shortened (edited) version on the DVD.  PBS did this with the early Inspector Lewis DVDs (the Pilot and Series 1&2), and everyone complained.  It appears that PBS is doing this again.

After the complaints about (and lack of interest in) the early Inspector Lewis DVDs, I think that PBS relented and released the full videos with the Series 3 Inspector Lewis DVD.  If PBS is doing this again, it upsets me.

What PBS chooses to air is its business.  I don't have to watch it, and I don't have to support PBS.  I really resent it, however, when PBS prevents me from purchasing the complete program.  I wish that British producers would not grant PBS the right to issue the American DVDs, and grant that right to Acorn or Koch instead.

I hope that I am wrong about this.  If I am, I am sorry for the misinformation.

The following is from Wikipedia.  I mention it because it shows that if the public complains about the the time edits, PBS can be convinced to change its mind on this issue:

""PBS owns the exclusive rights to both broadcast Lewis and to manufacture DVDs for North America. This is in contrast to Inspector Morse, which was commissioned by British company Carlton Television (originally Central Independent Television) and which included all original broadcast footage, even if that footage was edited on North American TV stations. PBS edits 10 minutes out of every Lewis episode so that it fits into the 90 minute Masterpiece Mystery time slot; this includes a preview of the episode's contents narrated by Alan Cumming before the episode and commercials for other PBS programs at the end of this slot. Even Barrington Pheloung's end credit music is abruptly cut for this purpose. For the Pilot, Inspector Lewis 1, and Inspector Lewis 2 DVD sets, PBS Home Video releases what was broadcast on-air in the US as opposed to the UK DVD content. However, for the new Inspector Lewis 3 DVD set, PBS Home Video has released the unedited UK version of the programs contained in the set.""",1297728000,38,2315,4.651105651105651

4369946,5,B004FM2EL2,"Another superb Masterpiece miniseries which we have come to expect.  Everything about this show is brilliantly done, from the writing to the acting, to the editing to the props.  The acting is remarkable.  Gillian Anderson is almost unrecognizable and does an outstanding job portraying the Duchess of Windsor.  I've been a fan of Matthew Macfadyen since his days as Tom Quinn on MI-5 and he doesn't disappoint here.

We follow a fictional character, Logan Mountstuart throughout his life beginning with his college days as he desperately tries to lose his virginity.  Written in a journalistic way, we live the ups and downs of the character much like we live our own lives.  We see Mountstuart hold on to a belief that he is a ""writer"" yet he lacks the discipline and drive to succeed at his dream.  And even though he meets extraordinary people and experiences extraordinary events, which could possibly give him needed motivation, he turns out to be a rather ordinary guy, must like the vast majority of us, struggling to get by but believing in our own greatness.

This series feels more like an art film than a television series. The production is excellent in all regards.
The story is not predictable. The characters are imperfect but understandable. The protagonist, whose life story is told, is an everyman, the person who muddles through life without any grand purpose. He claims to want to be a great author but a single success is followed by perennial writers' block. In fact, he has no great creative drive and far prefers socializing to writing. But he uses his skill to make money. At one point, he gets what amounts to a nine-to-five job in the military. This comes with a regular paycheck and a secretary,  and he is truly happy.

4369970,3,B004FM2EL2,"I found  ANY HUMAN HEART by chance on AMAZON. It looked interesting with a great cast. The Brits always do so well with period pieces.  I expected a winner here. Unfortunately, it is rather a bleak and sad story centered around an elderly and sickly Logan Mountstuart (Jim Broadbent) in a rundown house in France. As the story progresses we see Mountstuart sorting through old pictures and mementos to burn. It's clear from the beginning this story can't end well.

In between scenes of elderly Mountstuart, we are taken back to his childhood but the main story begins with Mountstuart at university with the goal of losing his virginity. He begins a lifetime of sad romances, love affairs and marriages. He's not a bad guy and it's not clear why most of his romances end badly. Mountstuart is cursed in love and haunted in life with the tragic loss of his one true love and soulmate. Matthew Macfadyen plays the post university Mountstuart through late middle age. A highly successful first novel seems to set him on a career path that fizzles. He meets a very strange version of the Duke  and Duchess of Windsor. During WWII, they Duke and Duchess are unofficially ""excited"" to the Bahamas where the Duke is assigned the post of governor. Gillian Anderson (X-Files) offers a very bizarre and unpleasant version of the Duchess. The Duke (Tom Holland) is even more unpleasant and spoiled than the Duchess.

There is one delightful highlight in ANY HUMAN HEART and that is lovely Hayley Atwell as Freya. Freya and Logan's love story lights up the screen and Atwell looks dazzling in 1940's era clothing and hair. It's worth seeing ANY HUMAN HEART just to see Atwell and Macfadyen together.

ANY HUMAN HEART seems to well-intentioned as it tells the story of man's journey through life. The times and the romances are turbulent. Even Kim Catrall (SEX IN THE CITY) is thrown in as the sexy sultry middle-aged American. Mountstuart's innocent university days are a sweet beginning for the film but the flash forward to his depressingly sad old lonely self in the present assures us this story will not turn out well.

Of course, the cast is great and the setting is fantastic. It's not all bad but this is not an interesting version of what could have been a great story.",1460419200,,2267,4.738578680203045

We see the lives of his school friends and watch as they all age. One by one Logan loses his parents, Freya (killed in wartime London) who is his constant love. He sees her face everywhere. The series is him reflecting back Trying to write a great novel. Old Mountstuart  is played by James Broadbent. With Matthew MacFadyen playing the younger man. With brilliant turns by Kim Cattrall as one of his loves. And Gillian Anderson as a quite paranoid Wallis Simpson. Beautifully photographed through Europe and London. Just wonderful.

The word ""beautiful"" describes many things, but I choose it specifically for the sadly short but loving portrayal of a life full of love and luck.  I thought this was a multiseason show, and when I realized it was 4 episodes (a mini-series) I was so disappointment - for I had already fallen in love with character of Logan and wanted to spend as much time in his life with him as possible.  I almost wish now that I had read the book, instead, for a longer time immersed in such a loving life.  Watched the full UK version and so glad I did.  Enjoy!  Enjoy!

I hesitate to call this a ""chick-flick"", because it's very romantic and beautifully executed, but I think all genders would appreciate it as it also a war story.

4370144,4,B004FM2EL2,"I found this to be just what I have come to expect from high end British television and Masterpiece Theater period pieces. Acting, story, art direction, cinematography... everything was marvelous. I particularly liked that 3 different actors were used to portray the narrator Logan Mountstuart at different stages of his life (spanning the last 3 quarters of the 20th century) instead of using lighting and latex to age one, which lent much greater credence to the main character during each period. Logan seems to trip through life, having numerous relationships with women and brushing shoulders with various historical figures, Hemingway, Ian Fleming, the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, somewhat akin to those encounters of Forrest Gump. Sadly, and unlike the innocent Forrest, Logan is his own worst enemy, and can never find the ability to get out of his own way. Wonderful performances by Matthew Macfadyen  and Jim Broadbent as Logan at mid and older ages, especially Broadbent and the poignancy he brings to a once virile man now facing his autumnal years, forced to observe from the sidelines situations he would once have masterfully owned. Kudos also to the cinematography recreating the New York of the 1950's and 60's, perhaps computer generated but wonderfully and believably done.",1433808000,,1293,5.216346153846154

It touches on the Spanish Civil War, his service in the Royal Navy during WWII and the happenings in between and afterwards. There is intrigue, romance, infidelity, and tragedy all in the tradition of the best Masterpiece soaps. If you like Masterpiece generally, this one will do.",1432944000,2,443,4.620253164556962

Romance did not detract from the horrors of war; yet added a level of humanity, which may be overshadowed in a period piece. There was a pleasant equilibrium struck between the realities of war and life, as one must live it in the midst of death, destruction and mayhem.  Against the backdrop of World War 1; a lovely romance emerges which reminds the viewers that true love is all anyone craves.

4370308,5,B004FM2EL2,"What can I say about this film other than that it's absolutely charming and wonderful?

I'm surprised it hasn't been more widely viewed/loved/popular. For those like myself who really dig 20th century history and accounts, who read Hemingway like believers read their holy books, who watch movies like ""The English Patient"" and ""Casablanca"", and who aspire to ""bring back"" robes, drinking whiskey, pipes and chairs by the fireplace, this wonderful 4-part series should really be a much bigger hit than what it currently is.

I'm reluctant to provide a synopsis of the story, simply because there's already the product description that Amazon provides, and also, when individual reviewers take it upon themselves to provide a synopsis, they often include spoiler alerts that the reviewers aren't necessarily mindful of. However, I will say that the movie is about a writer-- Logan Mountstuart-- who sort of ""stumbles through life"" and the major events of the 20th century, meeting major people along the way. It's an interesting take on what life looks like without a plan, or at least, what it looks like when all plans quickly go to hell. I especially love how the story is told. Told from Logan's perspective, the story starts when he is in his 20s, and we get to hear what his concerns and fears are at that age, and then the story moves to where he is in his 40s where we hear the perspective of him as a middle aged man, and the last bit is of him as an old man, where we are treated to the reflections of a much wiser Logan Mountstuart looking back over his life and the century. This is a great tale about love and loss, adventure and tragedy, youth and age and the inevitable passage of time we all must travel and who we encounter along the way.

The acting chemistry between Matthew MacFadyen and Hayley Atwell was wonderful. It is worth noting that the two also acted in the Showtime series ""Pillars Of The Earth"", based off of the Ken Follett novel.

Having said all of this, I will also say that the miniseries is the ""Sparks notes"" version of William Boyd's novel, which goes into much greater detail into the character of Logan Mountstuart's inner thoughts and life. You don't necessarily have to read the book before you watch the film. I didn't. However, the book is also good, and even though I had seen the miniseries, I still read the book afterward to get a deeper look into this lovely fictional character's life. I certainly wish I heard more people from ""my kind of crowd"" talking about this movie. Masterpiece Classic should air it more frequently.

4370325,3,B004FM2EL2,"Based on a William Boyd novel, Any Human Heart is the story of Logan Mountstuart, a British writer.  The story takes Logan from Oxford to the south of France, beginning in 1926 and ending in the early 1990s.

Logans father began his career in Uruguay, making corned beef.  He invites Logan to join his company, to work his way up from middle management, but Logan decides instead to become a writer.  Beginning as a novelist, he then turns to journalism.  After his death his journals are published under the title, Any Human Heart.

Logan is an atheist who adopts his fathers take on reality: its all about luck.  Sometimes your luck is good, sometimes its bad.  You just go with the flow, always looking forward.

The film is a kind of secular Forrest Gump.  In the course of his life, Logan meets Hemingway (covering the Spanish Civil War), Ian Fleming (who draws him into naval intelligence), the Duke of Windsor and Wallis Simpson (the latter played brilliantly by Gillian Anderson), et al.  Logan is imprisoned by Swiss Intelligence for a year, operates a branch of his friend Bens art gallery in New York, marries the daughter of an earl, lives on dog food in a tiny Pimlico flat, enjoys fame, suffers obscurity and inherits a stone house in the south of France, where he ends his days.  He spends much of his life bedding his friends wives and putting off writing his new novel.

The sex is rated-R+, so be careful if that offends you.  I would categorize it as pious pornography in the sense that while it is sometimes prurient it is contained within an art film, so that the titillation can be enjoyed with a clear conscience.

In addition to Gillian Anderson there are standout performances by Matthew Macfadyen as the middle-aged Logan and the incomparable Jim Broadbent as the older Logan.  Samuel West plays Peter Scabius, an oddly-named friend of Logans who writes detective novels and enjoys far greater commercial success than Logan.  West is always excellent.  Julian Ovenden is oddly-cast as a diminutive Ernest Hemingway, trying to do a plausible American accent.  Kim Cattrall (speaking very softly to mask her American accent) plays Scabius wife, Gloria.

(SPOILER alert).  Logan outlives everyone in the story, as they succumb (mostly) to cancer.  Boyd (who did the screenplay) even kills off Logans dog Bowser.  We are meant to see Logans journey as an upbeat-in-the-face-of reality, human triumph, but many of the characters are a bit simple and nearly all are involved in adulterous relationships, some involving betrayals of best friends.  There are few really likeable characters.

The sometimes good luck, sometimes bad luck take on life is in many ways problematic.  It flies in the face of such maxims as good luck comes to the prepared or Knute Rocknes God is on the side of the team with the biggest tackles.  Drifting through life, sometimes in quite irresponsible and even foolish ways, is a questionable model.  Since Logans fathers advice on luck is repeated constantly across the four episodes the result is more preachy than profound.  (SPOILER alert).  In following it, for example, Logan finds himself committing statutory rape and serving as a terrorist go-between.

The final result is an ambitious, expensive, lush mini-series, penned by an A-list writer, featuring a number of superb talents.  The story holds your attention until the plot turns in very odd directions (principally in the 3rd and 4th episodes).  The individuals undergo interesting experiences within a largely hollow universe.  Then they die.  The result is a mini blockbuster that will not be for all tastes.  With a little more traditional sentiment this could have been a schmaltzy but less serious entertainment.  With a harder edge it could have been grimly but authentically uplifting like Waiting for Godot.  As it stands, it includes moments of significant drama, tin-ear melodrama, zany sidetracks and shock scenes that were nevertheless quite predictable.  In the end it is something of a mishmash.  Some of it is riveting, some of it is laughable and some of it is predictable and dull.  Different moments will strike different viewers in different ways.  As a result, different reviewers will have very different responses.  Read a number of them before you make your decision to purchase.",1408838400,,4314,4.991584852734923

The acting is very good but the story line is not my cup of tea. The lead character really has few redeeming qualities. I kept hoping he would change but no, up until the end Logan was self-absorbed.

4370329,5,B004FM2EL2,"This unforgettable series about the life and loves and losses of a writer requires patience and commitment, but totally worth it. If you're going to watch any of this, you will only feel its full power by watching all of it, to the last frame. It is a film that feels exactly like a great, classic novel that keeps teasing you and teasing you to turn the next page, and the next, until the main character comes to life, you care deeply about him and you feel with him such intense happiness, longing, ache, and loneliness. It's so well done, so well acted, so lovingly historic, authentic and somehow epic and intimate at the same time. If you are young, you may learn something that will sustain you later in life, if you are old, like me, and especially if you are a writer, as am I, they made a movie about your life that will give you permission to celebrate and grieve.

The one thing that will connect with most viewers is the love that is so deep and enduring that it haunts all others in one's life. The viewer will also identify with the re-evaluation that occurs during senior years and the push back that as seniors, one can do things on his/her own and can do things one might not expect.

Was a bit confused when they changed the actor of Mountstuart  as I liked him as a young man but got used to the new Mountstuart and thought he did a great job too. They managed to make it plausible with the three actors they all looked similar but they left his two friends the same aging them.

This improves their performance and the overall enjoyability of the movie.

The music score was well done, the scenery and costumes over a period of dramatic change really make each of the characters and their intertwining lives come to life.

Each actor (and actress) is truly marvelous in his or her role....this story is shattering in its honesty and hope and echoes through two great world wars and into modern times.

While there were over the top elements in the first three parts, this part is just stupid. Yes, there were a lot of college aged through early thirties terrorists groups in the period and, yes, using an old man as a courier would be rather smart but Logan has been so used before and should have known better. The best way to sum up Logan's life by this next-to-last hurrah is that he is a simpleton easily swayed by cash and too lazy to take responsibility for anything. It is a shame this tale turned to pornographic violence of the truly venal sort in the end as it was an interesting way to travel through the Twentieth Century without getting dirty.

majority of relationships in this story. Nevertheless, the main character in this film is a somewhat naive and sincere

4370430,4,B004FM2EL2,"An unusual search result for WWII from Amazon! This is definitely not about  WWII military history. Great storyline and exceptional cinematology. Perhaps one reviewer misunderstood the portrayal of Logan Mountstuart [adapted from the book 'Any Human Heart: The Intimate Journals of Logan Mountstuart' by William Boyd]. This is not a man that died 'old' and disappointed but about a life that was lived to the fullest . . . and 'luck.' A young man's passion for life that endures to the end of his life . . . a young heart that has grown old only in body. Filled with the adventures of life and love, fascinating characters from literary history and those of historic importance, and being 'lucky or unlucky.' Well presented!

Recommended for those who enjoy this genre but not as a WWII drama. Exceptional adaptation of the book with a great cast . . . worth watching!

I loved the cinematography and editing, and I usually find the effects used for this gimmicky, but for Any Human Heart, it worked really, really, well.  And it was beautiful.  I think a lot of people are upset by the protagonist's amorality...or immorality.  I was rather bemused and sympathetic.  It gives you the same sense of ambiguity as when you watch a Woody Allen movie.  The three stars playing Logan are all magnificent--in fact, all the acting was superior.

4370481,2,B004FM2EL2,"There are so many enjoyable portions of nearly great theatrical aspects in this Masterpiece series. Unfortunately, we are blocked by the primary character from reaching any intended meaning. The central character is completely self-absorbed, and despite great performances by the entire cast, we are frustrated throughout.

There remains one exception: the great luminescence (it appeared in various scenes) arrives in conclusion and our aged anti-hero falls; and the show ends. Every idea of concrete reality was tested with the continual affirmation of spirituality. The presence of the luminescence arrives with variations, but the presentation of the child, the youth, and the adult reappear, repeatedly. The old man eventually appears, still there is no timespace context. Therefore, what does any of this [the light & stages of life] mean?

Meanwhile, the show continues; and, the central character remains untouched by anyone. Life around applies only to his life: he learns nothing from the birth of his son or the pains of his own father. Adversity slows or stops his pursuits, but nothing penertrates - but, why should it? There's always plenty of s-e-x; otherwise known as life. [in early 20th century, spelling the word was barely acceptable] Worse, our translucent character lives for one thing, his satisfaction and that means gratification with anyone.

Not until Hugh Hefner did America consider sex other than essential to reproduction and sinful, otherwise. Meanwhile, guess who moved to the USA? Next, the long forgotten son arrives with his age group and his very mature looking girl friend. Now, was this anything less contrived to other viewers? Or, unbelievable?

Final scene: stepping into a street, means total loss of continuity with previous connections in life? Total amnesia in the world happens when main character gets hit by car. Ok. Then, we move on with Old Age and Sex. Nothing matches, there's disconnection [from everything], and - aside the loss of faithful Bowser, the luminescence returns. Finally.

Nothing was gained from the exercise, the commercial revelation of confidential memoirs at some bookstore?",1372464000,8,2146,5.394029850746269

I love Matthew MacFayden, but all the three actors that played this same character, as a boy, then Matthew as adult, then another English actor played the senior citizen were very good. But Matthew mostly plays the character in most of the movie. It is unlike any movie I've ever seen. The character is not a famous man in this story, but a man who goes through a lot in his very interesting life. There are constant changes and he meets famous people in history throughout his life. He has many interesting experiences. He always writes in his journal about what he is thinking, his life experiences and how he is doing and such. He has ""saved"" all of his memories and you will see this towards the end and even in bit parts in this series.

The love of his life, well I won't give that away, let's just say he never recovers from it. But he meets interesting women along the way, through his whole life. I like how they make the character imperfect. Yet his story is so interesting. He has witnessed and seen many historical times throughout his life, and lives all the way up to the later 1960's I believe. Very good ""heartfelt"" and a bit melancholy movie, but I would highly recommend it. I felt spellbound through most of this Masterpiece theater series. It's very unique and I thought the end was, in it's way very profound and beautiful. I would highly recommend ""Any Human Heart""!",1370563200,3,1603,4.486301369863014

Is he a cad, or is he ethical? Sometimes one, sometimes the other it seems.  Rarely in a movie is a character presented in such a multi-dimensional way.

4370498,5,B004FM2EL2,"""Every human being is a collection of selves; we never stay just one person."" So says Logan Mountstuart, who is played by four different actors in ""Any Human Heart."" In the course of four episodes, we find out that Mountstuart--of all people who ever lived--should know firsthand about that.

""Any Human Heart,"" in the screenplay by William Boyd based on his novel, takes us through the eighty-five turbulent years of Mountstuart's life, years that just happen to touch on every decade of the 20th Century. From the first scenes of little Logan (Conor Nealon) in a rowboat, we see Logan the Oxford undergraduate (Sam Claflin), Logan the middle-aged novelist, journaiist and art dealer (Matthew Macfadyen), and finally the elderly Logan (Jim Broadbent), sad and alone among boxes of memorabilia in a ramshackle French farmhouse. Logan believes firmly that life is just a matter of luck, and indeed his life is an incredible rollercoaster ride. He goes from a lordly Norfolk estate to solitary confinement in a Swiss prison; from a New York penthouse to a heatless London flat where he is forced to live on dog food. Throughout, Mountstuart has fateful encounters with some of the most glittering celebrities of the century. Some of the encounters are pleasant (Ernest Hemingway,Ian Fleming), others not so much (the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, the Baader-Meinhof Gang).

Logan bobs through all these adventures, not like a cork that stays the same throughout, but like a glass prism displaying unexpected colors as different angles of light hit it. Logan is not always admirable, but he is always sympathetic. Sometimes we want to punch him for being such an idiot, yet his wit, charm, and essential decency always win us over.

Because the story's structure is by nature episodic, a lot of viewers have expressed disappointment in it. For my money, Episode Two is the most enthralling and moving (no fair saying why). Yet the excellence of the writing, production and performances kept me watching gladly throughout all four episodes, and left me hungry for more. Macfadyen and Broadbent are just amazing, but so is everyone else. I was particularly blown away by Gillian Anderson; it took me a while to recognize her as the Duchess of Windsor. Anderson and Tom Hollander, playing the Duke, together create the most letter-perfect, compelling, and loathsome screen portrayals of those fabled royals to date.

""Any Human Heart"" may not be a perfect viewing experience, but it is a thrilling and unforgettable one.",1362700800,,2513,5.06280193236715

4370500,5,B004FM2EL2,"Masterpiece Theater continues their tradition of quality programs with this presentation, but here with a twist.  Instead of the more popular Jane Austen-type dramas, ""Any Human Heart"" shows life through the eyes of a man, hence the uneven reviews for this product.  Based upon my personal experience I have yet to discuss this drama with a woman who liked it or a man who didn't.
The story is a well-acted, chronological biography, full of strong successes and massive failures, much love and hatred and in the end, a somber summing up.  It's a wild ride that leaves unanswered questions, a long trail of good and bad acts and somber recollections, as real as life.",1360713600,,666,4.824561403508772

4370502,3,B004FM2EL2,"Another night surfing for something to watch brought me to this Masterpiece Classic.  Any Human Heart is based on a novel written by William Boyd, which I have not read.  As far as how close the Masterpiece adaptation is to the written work, I have no idea.

It's frankly an emotional journey about one man - Logan Mountstuart from his coming of age to his death.  The movie starts on his pursuit to lose his virginity, along with his college friends that he remains fairly close to throughout life.  Of course, like all young men, virginity is lost, and the boy grows into a man.  Warning: There are some very graphic sexual scenes that may offend.  They are boys in rut.

The story follows his pursuit to become a novelist, for which he accomplishes the writing of one book and never seems to come to a place of finishing another.  Life takes him through a loveless marriage, an affair with his one true love, his stint as a British naval intelligence officer during WWII, his rubbing elbows with the likes of Ernest Hemingway, Edward VIII and his wife Wallis Simpson, and finally ending up a recruited, but clueless revolutionary.  Portions of his life are lived in opulent wealth, while toward the end of life he's eating dog food to survive.

There are three actors who play Logan from young man to old - Sam Claflin, Matthew Macfadyen, Jim Broadbent.  I enjoyed Matthew fairly well, but I cannot say it was his best performance.  Logan, as a character, is interesting enough. He lives with the philosophy of his father, that life is merely about luck.  It's either good luck or back luck.  There isn't a God.  There's only luck, and you hear that phrase until you're tired of hearing that phrase.  The greatest heartache of his life revolves around his wife, daughter, and unborn child he loses during the war.  It's a loss he never truly recovers from the remainder of his days.

Any Human Heart isn't the best of series that I've watched.  It's mildly engaging and a thoughtful look at the meaning of life from birth to death.  By the end you're beginning to weigh the good and bad luck in your own life.  One part of the movie I did enjoy was the multiple times Logan sat down, rolled a piece of paper into the typewriter, and sat there waiting for his next book to come out of him.  He had writer's block that lasted for a lifetime and a blank page that never got filled.",1359936000,6,2381,4.511682242990654

I found this Logan person likable enough and could see myself making the same choices if presented with similar circumstances.
I am about sick to death of movies which use as their main plot vehicle, the inexplicable diving into by characters, of moronic behavior, as if they are perfectly normal otherwise and then all of a sudden they do something that seems completely out of character, as if they had temporarily lost the ability to think.

The filthy words was too much to bare. I just got to the first vulgar word spoken in the movie and that was enough for me. I exit the  movie so fast someone would have thought my hands were on fire. Better to burn my hands now then to allow the soul to burn eternally.

4370523,5,B004FM2EL2,"Ginia Bellafante wrote in the New York Times on February 11, 2011 that ""Any Human Heart"" is a ""Forrest Gump"" for the literate. She also wrote that the beauty of the story is that ""embitterment never sees its own victories.  Failure, too, has its pleasure.""  A fun comparison yet fine words to describe the ""heart"" of one Logan Mountstuart, a fictional character, whose life in the 20th century is chronicled from his Oxford days in the 1920's to a mere existence in the 1990's.

William Boyd, who wrote the novel and the screenplay for this spectacular PBS production, asks and answers this question:  How did a boy adrift on a placid river in Uruguay become a grizzled old man sorting through piles of boxes and books in an old country house in France?  It's a fascinating ride!

Sit back and enjoy the clever dialogue, the sets and the photography, the fine performances of Jim Broadbent and Matthew Macfadyen as Mountstuart.

Try to keep up with the wives and lovers.  The casting is superb.  Don't overlook the first wife, Lady Lottie Cassell, who gives Logan his love of the aristocratic life and a son.  Hayley Atwell plays Freya, the much loved and beautiful second wife. Kim Cattrall (the sexy vamp from Sex and the City) plays Gloria, a redhaired lover and the third wife of Logan's Oxford buddy. And even after World War II, when Logan leaves a destitute life in London of eating cans of dog food and beans and moves to France, he charms a young neighborhood beauty who has a glorified memory of her father during the war.  (The scenes of an older Mountstuart in military camoflage watching over her father's memorial plaque are hilarious.)

Enjoy the real-life 20th century figures who flit in and out of Logan's life. It does not go without saying...as the NYT reviewer suggests...that Logan with his minor literary fame meets Hemingway in Paris.  There are multiple scenes with the Duke and Duchess of Windsor.  Wallis Simpson is portrayed by Gillian Anderson (formerly of X-file fame) in glorious witchy mood---she even hisses!  Ian Fleming becomes a suave friend who asks Logan to persuade the Windsor's to move to the Bahamas for national security reasons and encourages Logan to join the Royal Navy.

What was so stunning midst Logan's trials and tribulations is the sad fact that he survives a son, a daughter, a wife and two very good friends from his Oxford days. Although he steals Peter's Oxford girlfriend and seduces his third wife, there's a great deal of admiration there:  Peter is a best-selling author of mystery novels.  And to Ben, the other friend, he gives five Joan Miro paintings smuggled out of Spain to start a successful gallery.  And the tender scenes are tender indeed, when he takes in Gloria who is still beautiful but dying of pancreatic cancer. Their scenes eating pate and drinking wine on a disheveled bed are joyously poignant.

This is not a tale to remind us ""that success is so often bestowed on those whose personal conduct would seem to warrant it least..."" nor is it a tale of an embittered old man.  It's just an entertaining story of one man's journey through the 20th century.
