From the very beginning the objective was to help people learn about how the food people eat and the way they cook it can actually have an impact on fertility.  Many years ago my wife Victoria and I tried to have children.  We tried everything including injections, but still no luck.  We eventually adopted two lovely children aged 2 and 3 at the time.  Now  they are 19 and 20 and they are my best friends.  In those days I never knew that food choices and nutrition could really have an impact on fertility.  I definitely learned a lot during the process of making this DVD.  I learned a lot about fertility and nutrition, and I am blessed to have worked closely with two awesome teachers, Tiffany Pollard and Kathryn Flynn.  I am proud as to how this DVD turned out and totally recommend you give it a try.  I am confident that you will enjoy the video and you will really enjoy making the great meals suggested by Tiffany and Kathryn.  And the desserts are awesome, too.",1275782400,2,1142,4.490291262135922
