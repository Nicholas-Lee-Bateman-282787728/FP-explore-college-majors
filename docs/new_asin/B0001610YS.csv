8007204,4,B0001610YS,"This film had been hard to find.  I guess I'm one of the lucky
ones. Interested fans may want to know that apparently this is
still available in France and Germany. Neither of those versions (filmed in French, originally)  has English subtitles as an option. Two longtime lovers in Canada
seem to be in a relationship that might be getting stale. As a
party prank one of their friends calls an escort service to send
someone over. The request was cancelled (or was it?). No spoilers
here. Just watch and enjoy. The actor playing the escort is very attractive.",1379116800,,559,4.636363636363637
8007205,4,B0001610YS,"L'ESCORTE is a stylish examination of the effect a ""paid male escort"" has on the lives and fortunes of Phillipe and Jean-Marc, a pair of longterm gay lovers. The beautiful and talented French actor Paul-Antoine Taillefer perfectly portrays Phillipe, the leading man character, as an altruistic naif. And, though slightly less adorable and slightly less handsome, the characters who surround him as just as adroitly realized.

However, as wonderful as the film's first 80 minutes are, the story's unfortunate ""walk into the sunset"" denouement ties up all the loose fray in a rather cheesy package.

Still, putting that aside, when the script is all said and done, it is mostly Taillefer who makes this carefully subtitled French flick worthwhile and memorable, despite some faults at the conclusion.

It definitely belongs in your collection of gay male cinema.",1253404800,,860,5.262773722627737
