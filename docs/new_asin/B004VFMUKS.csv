4482544,5,B004VFMUKS,My kids Love this movie.  Another great one by ShatterPoint Entertainment.  You can tell that the quality is lower than their newer films but overall a great movie.,1360195200,,164,4.821428571428571
4482545,5,B004VFMUKS,"We bought this set for our children for Christmas.  They truly enjoyed it!

It does a wonderful job of telling the story from a Biblical perspective.  We laughed at several spots, and all five of our children ages 11-3 were entertained the entire time that the movie was playing.

We should note: this movie is NOT PROFESSIONALLY DONE! It was created by a homeschool family! It gives one the sense of a well-done home movie.  My husband and I were a little disappointed because we did not realize this fact.  In fact, the two of us would have given this set a lower review because of that; however, our children truly enjoyed the movie and insisted on scoring this a ""5."" So, since this is a children's video and not an adult's film, we agreed.  In addition, I will note that the entire family did find this film: entertaining, accurate, unique, and enjoyable.  It has inspired our own children, who are homeschooled, to create their own movie.  What a great project!

May we suggest that you either follow this movie, or preface it, whith reading the story with your children from the Old Testament! Nothing can replace God's word.",1356480000,6,1132,4.64321608040201

8443289,1,B004VFMUKS,"Really low production value. Looks and sounds like it was made as a family project over a weekend with a low quality laptop and 2 megapixel camera. Terrible audio, terrible voice acting, poor animation, poor lighting.

There are tons of YouTube videos with much higher production values than this. My 8 year old son has a stop motion app on his iPod and has made similar quality movies on his own.

They should not be charging money for this. It should be up for free on YouTube, where I could excuse some of the quality concerns. Not worth a single dollar though.",1527379200,,564,4.519607843137255

8443292,5,B004VFMUKS,"I love this. My boys, ages 4, 7, 8, 11, and 22--they love this. I bought this a few years ago at a homeschool convention, along with the ""Jericho"" DVD. I see another reviewer said it is ""poorly done"". I would like to say that yes, it is ""poorly done"" compared to THE LEGO MOVIE. This, however, was DONE BY HOMESCHOOLED BOYS using stop-motion animated software. In that case--it is phenomenally done. It is adorable, and funny. I can hear my boys laughing all the way through these. They are educational and fun. We always watch them as part of school when we are studying Jericho or the Plagues of Egypt. Yes--it is homespun and a bit corny. But this family  had a vision and they did an amazing job putting it together. You can tell by the time they made the Jericho DVD they had learned a lot about making a stop-animation production! They had customized their Lego hair and costumes with modeling clay and fabric, and had started adding animation to the faces. There are lots of surprise and funny ""special effects""--like little glass frogs, and the white Lego ""hail"" and the ""manna."" I don't regret the purchase one bit. Absolutely adorable. Thank you for making these. We love them and appreciate them so much!",1471305600,,1215,4.599078341013825

8443294,1,B004VFMUKS,We really wanted to like it.  But it did not hold my child's attention. It is poorly done. Not a good buy.,1455753600,,106,3.8181818181818183
8443295,5,B004VFMUKS,"We are Lego lovers and my boys (10 and 6) really enjoyed this. I would say they liked it as much as the official Lego Movie they saw in theaters.  The humor is so silly that it kept them laughing and although the graphics were not Lego Movie quality, it was still interesting to see how they used Legos to make special effects happen.  We found the Battle of Jericho version in a Christian Book store and knew we had to find more of them.",1441065600,,438,4.141176470588236
