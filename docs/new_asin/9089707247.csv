1172942,5,9089707247,"I love this. I was there a couple of times during the 1970's and it has obviously changed. I would have liked to be walking some in the city itself, around Kowloon, over by the Ocean Terminal, Ladder St., Victoria Peak, out in the new territories, and around Lantau Island.  I wasn't really familiar with were this dvd took place in Hong Kong, but it's a good walk.  I would love to see more.",1429228800,,392,4.283783783783784
1172943,5,9089707247,"With this DVD you have the feeling of actually being in Hong Kong. First, you can go for a walk through Kowloon Park, passing many visitors and looking at the beautiful setting of the. The second video is perfect for the treadmill. I have never been to Hong Kong myself, but this course seems to be pretty popular in Hong Kong. You can run through the nature, but you can still see the skyscrapers of Hong Kong in the background. The running goes upwards and downwards and you pass many other joggers along the way and the sounds fit the videos perfectly. The third video is a bit slower. You can walk on the Avenue of Stars, where you can see many people and you can have a look at the beautiful skyline.
All of the three videos are good for an exercise machine. Even if the videos are sometimes a bit slower, exercising is still so much fun.",1428364800,,843,4.3081761006289305
1172944,5,9089707247,"I really enjoy jogging indoors to this DVD video. Hong Kong is not quite as breathtaking as Helsloot's Singapore Skylines DVD, but it's extremely well done and enjoyable. I catch myself wondering what's around the next bend and the DVD keeps me focused and less likely to stare at the clock counting minutes away. The foliage, towering urban landscape and people watching make this DVD a winner.",1420502400,4,395,4.91044776119403
1172945,2,9089707247,"Having visited both Hong Kong and Singapore, I was looking forward to some nicer walks here in HK.  The first walk was not very interesting, I will probably end up skipping this one.  The Bowen Rd walk was great.  The third one was o'k.  Should have done some more Victoria Peak and perhaps Aberdeen scenery.",1386460800,,308,4.545454545454546
1172946,5,9089707247,"This is a leisurely paced walk for the treadmill; it's almost at the ""holding hands"" pace, when you walk along the boardwalk with your loved one. Only, in this case you are walking with your loved one in Hong Kong. The people you pass are friendly and wave or nod at you. I found myself nodding back as I walked by. Even though this all takes place in an urban setting, it's not over-crowded or claustrophobic; you are aware of the friendly city dwellers around you, but you don't feel ""pushed"" or prodded. The night scenes are fantastic with the city lights. Overall, a very pleasant walking video.

7901494,5,9089707247,"This provides a fine set of walks for your indoor training.  The first walk goes through some of the public parks and passes quite a few people and groups of school children.  The second walk is more subdued and takes one along the tracks up on the hills behind Hong Kong and also gives you a look at some of the gigantic apartment buildings in the area.  The third walk starts out in the daytime and goes on through twilight and into the night, where the beauty of the entire city can be seen.  While it is a tourist city, the number of people with cameras is amazing, but you can't fault them for wanting to take pictures of this tremendous sight.",1507852800,,649,4.295081967213115

7901497,3,9089707247,"Didn't likes:

* As others state, the focus is ONLY ever straight ahead. Would like to see up, around and over.

*Each scene is about 15 or so minutes and then it repeats several times. I was hoping for more variety in scenerary.

*Price is not bad for what I hoped for. Seemed a little high for what I received.

Loves:
*Person filming must be tall or wearing a high camera, because in this DVD tips of buildings, trees, hills, etc. can be seen. This allows for more visual enjoyment!

*Background sounds!

*Pace!

*Some of the beauty of landscape, architecture, and people is captured.

Hopes:

7901499,5,9089707247,Great video tripping. My only problem is that I am looking too much at the scenery instead of concentrating on the aerobic part of the exercise.,1463270400,,144,4.576923076923077

Sometimes I mute the sound and listen to my own music in my earphones. Works great either way. Get you some of these dvds if you need help exercising like I do.",1458432000,,285,4.296296296296297
