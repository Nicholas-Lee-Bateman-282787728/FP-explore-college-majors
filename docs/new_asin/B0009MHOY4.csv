8063197,5,B0009MHOY4,I use these in the nursing home  with a worship program I do weekly.  Have went through the set twice.  I did buy another set because my first one is very used.  It is word for word the Bible.  You can hear and see words on screen.  Good for the hearing and visual impaired.,1481673600,2,274,3.9814814814814814
8063198,5,B0009MHOY4,"I love this spoken version of the Bible.  The narrator has a pleasant voice and is very easy to listen to. The background shots and video are appropriate for the verses being presented.  I also noticed one of my favorite ministers, Zola Levitt, is in the background and it's nice to see him again since he went to be with the Lord a few years ago.

I have listened to the whole New Testament several times because it is so easy to play whenever I have a minute in my day or when I want to use as a devotional.  I might not use this version as a deep study guide but it is a great inspiration.  To me it's worth the $99 I paid for the first copy I bought and definitely $20 I paid for a gently used set that I used as a gift.  As you can see, I really like it.",1443657600,2,759,3.8645161290322583

8063200,5,B0009MHOY4,"WATCHWORD BIBLE NT (Watch for the Old Testament by the same producer)(Also available in several foreign languages.)

Available in DVD and VHS format the WatchWORD Bible, New Testament series, uses the American Bible Society's New Contemporary English Version of the Bible. Read by Don Wadsworth, it is easily understood by elementary children through senior adults. This dynamic presentation features a combination of video, text, narration, original musical score and sound effects, such as thunder, flowing water, and bird song, all on the same screen. At no point, on my computer monitor, or television, did I find it difficult to read or hear, and understand the text, without my glasses or hearing aids.

This 26 hour production of edutainment, is equally suitable for Protestants, Catholics, and Orthodox church users. It is the first presentation, I have seen in which nothing detracts from the Scripture. Another exceptional feature, the user is not expected to cope with the idiosyncrasy of sound effects, which vacillate from sweet and low to disturbingly loud.

The blurb on the storage case suggests use for devotions, during exercise time, for seniors with vision or hearing impairment, disabled individuals, in churches, schools, Bible study, reading programs or for ESOL purposes. Adding home schooling and power point presentations, is no problem.

According to producer Jim Fitzgerald, ""We created this project to be used in all possible ways by churches and individuals. . . One of the great tools we have now, is our online subscription service, which can be used by individuals, as well as, by entire churches."" Check it out at ([...]"" I agree with their suggestion that every home, church and library should have this entertaining, educational tool in their collection.

Having enjoyed work in drama for 5 years, I would never have expected the benefits of a dramatic reading to be more effective than the actual drama, such as the Visual Bible. In my opinion, the absence of actors improves this presentation.",1198886400,11,2031,5.236923076923077
8063201,5,B0009MHOY4,"This DVD set is perfect if you are very busy and don't have alot of time to sit down and read your Bible (I know we all need to make time).  Still, I highly recommend this set.  It really will help you to spend more time in the word!",1187395200,13,233,3.7346938775510203
