8457439,5,B00553K8Z4,"I found myself wondering who was more 'challenged', those with 'normal' lives or people with handicaps. This is an inspiring film about a young woman from a dysfunctional family who is more emotionally handicapped than her co-worker with Down's Syndrome. It is also an interesting look into the world of a mental and/or physically challenged person. Often they are sent to school or programs to help them function in a 'normal world', but then when they start to express the desires or dreams of a normal person someone is there to pull in the reins and treat them like children again. This film is an eye opening experience and I took a lot away from it, as well as examining my own ideas about how I perceive handicapped people. Those of us who are not handicapped in obvious ways are often challenged in less apparent aspects of our lives, often taking our freedom to make our own choices (good or bad) for granted. The acting in this movie is also superb, Bravo!",1337212800,2,966,4.622093023255814
8457440,4,B00553K8Z4,"Two Spanish Academy awards and two other nominations earned by this movie dealing with a sensitive matter. Of course, one could say that the film is more a documentary than a romance because the mise-en-scene is very discreet and the screenplay basic, to say the least, but the main characters's performance wins our immediate support. Highly recommended.",1328227200,,355,5.245614035087719
8457441,4,B00553K8Z4,"Outstanding, mature romance which develops with realistic ebbs and flows through the length of the film. The central relationship is often contrasted with a variety of relationships surrounding it without ever seeming forced or artificial. This film has more seemingly effortless depth and heart that 99% of the histrionic cartoonish relationships you'll see on an American theater screen.",1322179200,5,389,5.724137931034483
