7635191,5,B01BHQQACC,Excellent array of early Cary Grant films: Thirty Day Princess with Sylvia Sidney; Kiss and Make Up; Ladies Should Listen; Enter Madam; She Done Him Wrong and I'm No Angel with Mae West; Devil and the Deep with Tallulah Bankhead; Wings in the Dark with Myrna Loy; The Last Outpost; Madame Butterfly with Sylvia Sidney; The Woman Accused and Hot Saturday with Nancy Carroll; The Eagle and the Hawk; Big Brown Eyes; Wedding Present; This is the Night; Blonde Venus; and Gambling Ship. It is about time attention was given to the early films of Cary Grant! He was great from the start and he caught on like wildfire with the public. These are marvelous films from his Paramount years and it is a great collection. I can't recommend this set highly enough.,1461369600,27,752,4.661654135338346
7635192,5,B01BHQQACC,"At least the initial run is so get them while they're hot. I got mine in the mail yesterday and the transfers on the ones I watched look fine. It is packaged well with one set of DVDs with Cary Grant comedies and the other set for dramas. Do also note that even though Universal is putting this out this package contains Grant's earliest films when he was under contract to Paramount. There are some double dips if you own all of Grant's previous pressed films, but to get some of the rare early talkies on  pressed disc was worth it to me...even though I didn't know for sure the collection was pressed at the time.

Note to Universal - If this set does well how about a set of Raft films on pressed DVD? How about ""Dancers In the Dark"", ""Madame Racketeer"", ""Night World"", ""If I Had A Million"", ""Under Cover Man"", ""Pick-Up"", ""All of Me"", ""Bolero"", ""The Trumpet Blows"", ""Limehouse Blues"", ""Rumba"", ""Stolen Harmony"", and  ""Yours For the Asking"", all good Raft films owned by Universal.",1461110400,13,984,4.51685393258427

7635196,5,B01BHQQACC,"The most treasured collection in my possession. I shall buy a second set. Why? These movies are jewels!. All 18 movies are well restored. Sharpness of the picture and sound is awesome, when we think about the fact that some of them are over 70 years old! You have a choice of subtitles in the package or a set without them. I bought the one with subtitles. There are 9 comedies on 3 burnt orange discs with ""Enter Madame"", ""Big Brown Eyes"", ""Wedding Present"", then  ""Thirty Day Princess"", ""Kiss And Make Up"", ""Ladies Should Listen"" and ""This Is The Night"", "" She Done Him Wrong"", ""I'm No Angel"". Your drama series come on 3 blue discs. ""Madame Butterfly"", ""The Woman Accused"", ""The Eagle And The Hawk"", second disc ""Devil And The Deep"", ""Blonde Venus"", ""Hot Saturday"" third disc ""Gambling Ship"", ""Wings In The Dark"", ""The Last Outpost"". To catch every detail, I watch them as often as I can. Take an example. In ""Enter Madame"", Cary Grant is so magnificent, not only dressed in tails and looking like a dream, but his facial expressions throughout, his body language are priceless. This is the year 1935, when the movie was released. Cary Grant plays in this movie with one of my beloved actresses of 30-ies Elissa Landi. Two lovers part, then reconcile, they massage you with their adoration for each other. They tear themselves apart. They take us with them on a world's tour.  To see these two in ""Enter Madame"" is a must. Then, there is ""I'm No Angel"", another one of Cary Grant movies, that I watch frequently. It offers something to everyone. Mae West is so hilarious in a courtroom. Her hip-swinging and garrulous a-do questions, embarrassing former suitors are one of the kind. There is also Cary Grant as a detective In ""Big Brown Eyes"" and Joan Bennett as a shrewd newspaperwoman. Believe me, those two love, fight and love again while making you ask for more of them in action. Oh, and ""She Done Him Wrong"" is one of those movies, where legs were ""confidential"". Beer was 5 cents a glass and a cabaret singing was unbelievably beautiful in a bar. Cary Grant is a sleek hawk in this movie, fighting well established crooks. Mae West is dressed in her diamond best. Some of her gowns are real ""Oscars"" too.
 When you open a sleeve with drama, in this collection, it is a different world. Our magnificent Cary Grant keeps us riveted to the screen. ""The Last Outpost"" offers us Cary Grant mustachioed and uniform-clad. He has an English Rose for a partner in Gertrude Michael. We have a very gentlemanly Claude Rains too, playing his rescuer. It is so action packed it keeps you on your toes.""Hot Saturday"" offers  Cary Grant, Randolph Scott and Nancy Carroll. Very educational movie, with all three of them playing ordinary people in a small town set-up and dealing with a small-town mentalities in a certain way.  Delightful. I love ""Blonde Venus"" also. It gives us Cary Grant, again looking like young God, with Marlene Dietrich, whose role as a mother and wife, torn between her two worlds is an experience to watch. My most watched in drama series are also ""The Woman Accused"" and ""Gambling Ship"". Both Showing Cary Grant in romantic set-up. How much these movies from the year 1933 touch upon our emotions is the real value of them in to-day's currency of life. Roscoe Karns, plying a rogue will give you something new to love in a man too.
 I buy  only on Amazon. Believe me there is no one on-line that I would choose over Amazon. Not once have I had a bad experience with Amazon. When Amazon says it will be delivered on Tuesday, it is at my door on Tuesday. After purchasing over a hundred DVD and several books, I consider Amazon one and only. .",1477180800,8,3663,4.60030627871363

7635198,3,B01BHQQACC,"In light of all the wonderful restoration work being done by Universal of late, it pains me to take their home video division to task. Specifically, the recently released Cary Grant Vault Collection set. Many of the titles included I already own and I re-purchased just to get the handful of new to video titles in the set. Ive screened two of the new ones (THE WOMAN ACCUSED and LADIES SHOULD LISTEN) and both exhibit severe audio problems, specifically a loud hum. This sort of audio problem turned up occasionally in old 16mm TV print, which which Im certain these derived from. I realize that the extant elements of the old Paramounts is a mixed bag as MCA had started to dispose of original 35mm elements before UCLA intervened, but I feel Universals engineers could have done something to minimize these audio problems. Am I glad I purchased this set? Of course, but I feel really let down that they saw fit to release these with no apparent effort to correct or at least minimize the problem.",1463702400,69,999,4.649717514124294
7635199,3,B01BHQQACC,"This is a great collection of hard to find Cary Grant films. Some of have never been ""officially"" released on DVD until now. Many are no longer under copyright, so until now we had to put up with poor quality ""public domain"" releases. On the positive side, this is the most complete early CG collection ever assembled. It's great seeing the young CG in action! The set is also attractively packaged and priced. This will please CG fans and those who enjoy period films. The image quality is significantly better than the PD versions, but there are a few notable quality problems.

Not many of these are truly great films, however, I think most CG fans will forgive that. The picture and sound quality varies from excellent (for this period) to rather mediocre. Others on Amazon have noted that ""Gambling Ship"" has a very annoying background hum in some places. A few others (ie: ""Ladies Should Listen"") also have this noise, though not as severe. The PD releases did not have the background hum, which suggests that the problem is due to poor quality control at Universal. Picture quality on ""The Woman Accused"" is a bit poorer than the others, with specks and lines rather often at times.

Also questionable is the use of the non-tinted version of ""This Is the Night"". The Depending on your taste you may or may not like the tinting. Personally, I think the blue tint on the 2011 DVD version is a bit too dark. The ""restored"" tint was probably digitally re-imposed on a black and white print, so it is hard to know for sure if the tinting really looks as intended. However, all this still makes me wonder if the lack of tinting on this release is a mistake. Were the quality control people at Universal paying attention?

There are two other CG films yet to be officially released on DVD. ""Sinners In the Sun"" (1932) was his second feature and has only a small part from CG. Perhaps this will turn up in an anthology set for the film's main star, Carole Lombard. And just this month (May 2016) the getTV channel premiered a restored version of ""When You're In Love"" (1937). This is an enjoyable musical that has been out of circulation for far too long. I hope it will be the next Cary Grant DVD release.",1463011200,22,2205,4.54911838790932
7635200,4,B01BHQQACC,"Very nicely done collection of films not easily available.  It is too bad that it duplicates several films that were in previous collections.  I don't really like having to buy multiple copies of the same film.  Now if they will bring out ""When You're In Love"", , , ,",1462924800,4,267,4.408163265306122
7635201,2,B01BHQQACC,"I just took a quick look at ""This is the Night"".  Unlike the earlier releases of the film (TCM Archives) this edition DOES NOT have the color tinting.",1462147200,,150,4.357142857142857
7635202,2,B01BHQQACC,"Having looked forward with much anticipation to seeing five of Cary Grant's films that had until now had been unavailable on DVD, we were terribly disappointed that the very first one we chose to view, Gambling Ship, delivered a most-distracting, egregious, continually disturbing hum of varying intensity throughout its presentation. Abysmal!

We put a man on the moon in 1969, and we can't even clean up the hideous hum in a depression-era movie in this boom-time of audio technology!

8750223,4,B01BHQQACC,"These movies are not his best, and in many, Grant is still finding his voice and style, but you can see him evolving through these early to mid 1930s films. Even the movie-making styles are evolving here. Some scenes in some movies from the early 30s tend to be dragging for modern audiences as they lack background music and take their time, But you can see how the pace gets faster with later films. .
 Having said that, there's some solid entertainment here--The Eagle and The Hawk, the Last Outpost and Big Brown Eyes, come to mind. If you're a serious fan of old Hollywood movies and Cary Grant, this is a worthy addition to your collection.",1528761600,2,646,4.521367521367521
