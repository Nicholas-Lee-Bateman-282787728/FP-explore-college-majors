8653064,5,B005C1JR92,"This show reminds me of Asian educational television shows that are done in still images with simple songs and animation, making it much easier for my little guys to focus. This was something I was looking for for a long time, as it is a concise show, without all the additional ""fluff,"" that allows my children to walk away with a few new things from every episode. I believe that shows these days deviate on many tangent story lines (hint: Electric Company circa 2011 on) or are far more dedicated to the entertainment side of things, rather than the educational. Snapatoonies manages to merge the two in a manner appropriate for its target audience of young toddlers, and is something I don't mind sitting down and watching with my kids.",1330905600,,740,4.7
8653065,5,B005C1JR92,"Counting Kids teaches not just counting, but the names of the numbers in sound and writing and the correspondence with the amount each number represents. It's perfect for one to four-year-olds as an introduction to numeracy, which is so important in school later on. `Nathan' teaches by asking simple questions and kids answer along with the kids in the Snapatoonies train, engaging toddlers in active learning by saying the answers out loud. `Nathan' likes to talk in rhymes and has a neat sense of humor. The little stick figures are also funny and catch the kids' attention as they are similar to their own drawings during the kindergarten years, except that they move. All in all the show is a great addition to a toddler and preschooler's DVD collection!",1329696000,,759,4.891472868217054
8653066,5,B005C1JR92,"My kids have really enjoyed watching this DVD, and I am really pleased as well because my three year old was really struggling with numbers. The colorful backgrounds and catchy tunes really held his attention, and I thought the figure of Nathan and the train kids kept a common thread going through the program.
What also really helped was the fact that most of the numbers had been given a character of their own, re-enforced by the rhymes. For instance, five loves to jive and eight is always late. (And five really does do a little dance along with the little kids).  My son now does exactly the same whenever he sees the number five!
Also, as someone who's worked with children for a number of years now, I would really recommend this DVD. ""The animation is simple and keeps the kids on their toes. They shout out the answers with the children on train!"" And repetition of the same thing in a lot of different ways keeps the novelty intact for the children and yet, they've grasped the concept without even realizing it!",1329609600,,1024,4.565217391304348
8653067,5,B005C1JR92,"Snapatoonies Counting Kids is a great way to enrich your toddler's learning foundation.  As a parent and educator, I am impressed with the features.  It is designed specifically for this age group with a format and content perfect for the developing toddler mind.  Using the same conversational style that we use with our children, the DVD offers a familiarity that will be comfortable and allow the focus to be on the content.  Nathan is a relatable character that engages the viewer with conversation, prompts, and praise.  The character will quickly become a friend that your child will ask for again and again.  As the child interacts with the Nathan, essential number concepts are reinforced through repetition, engaging visuals, and an articulate, friendly voice.  Visual and audio stimuli allow for the sound educational practice of employing multiple intelligences.  It is a great tool and just one more way to support the early learning we do with our kids.",1329523200,,966,5.10828025477707
