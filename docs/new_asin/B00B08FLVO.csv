With a wide array of both seasoned and current artists, all showing utmost appreciation to the musical legend of Levon Helm, it's a must-have for fans of Levon and The Band. In my opinion it's a triple threat winner, with great music, talented artists and outstanding production! And super packaging combo with both the audio and the video versions. Get it now! Levon would love it, and you will, too.",1361145600,8,480,4.658823529411765
5540068,1,B00B08FLVO,"I've always loved Levon Helm.  Whether with The Hawks, The Band, The RCO All Stars (my favorite) or solo, his vocals and instrumental prowess were second to none.  I understand that he was well loved by his peers, and raising money to save his ""barn"" is very noble, but what were the producers of this event thinking allowing some of the worst vocalists on the planet interpret and honor his songs?  Just watching the preview clip made me cringe, David Bromberg, Joe Walsh, Roger Waters and whoever the hell Grace Potter is need to hang up their microphones.  Tuneless off-key singing, and in the case of Ms. Potter, shrieking, does nothing but make a mockery of Levon's musicianship.  If they wanted to honor Levon they should have stuck to playing their respective instruments, sharing anecdotes or just donating money, anything but singing.  Before ordering this make sure you watch the preview, I'm glad I did.

5540069,5,B00B08FLVO,"Yeah! I have been waiting for this release since the night of the concert. I flew from Atlanta to Newark just to see this show, and flew back the next morning. I have been going to concerts since the 60's, and this one may have been my all time favorite. What a show! What a line up, and what a play list. I couldn't wipe the grin off my face for days, thinking back on the show. My two favorite moments were Grace Potter singing ""I Shall Be Released"" and Roger Waters talking about the hat that Levon gave him when they were doing ""The Wall"" in Berlin. The only two disappointing parts of the show were Patty Griffin not showing up as announced, and the fact that they didn't play all night long!",1359936000,60,697,4.208955223880597

5540074,5,B00B08FLVO,"I call this THE FINAL WALTZ.  I couldn't care less about these stars feuds, scandals, etc (Helms-Robertson, etc).

.....TALENT is TALENT and speaks for itself.  ALL of this show is top notch but to me the following are ABOVE AVERAGE:

-Chest Fever w/ Garth doing Bach-esque intro, best ever IMO.
-Eric Church, both songs but mainly James Gang song.
-Tears of Rage, Ray Lamontagne is a living legend...people complain Bob Dylan wasn't there, his son was and i'd rather see RAY !
-Grace Potter, this is the best performance i have ever seen her do and the best HAMMOND B3 organ grind ever !  IMO this is the best song-performance of all on here.
-Wheels on Fire by Larry Campbell is smokin hot.

What i also like is its in HD and contemporary renditions.",1481760000,5,752,4.574626865671642

5540099,1,B00B08FLVO,"After watching the performance on TV, I eagerly anticipated owning it as a stellar concert. Unfortunately, the first one had no data on it so after sending it back and receiving a replacement; I was appalled to find it had the same problem. No program, no menu, just endless spooling of the opening. I think the supplier is at fault but I will wait until I know the issue is resolved to reorder.",1397174400,2,395,4.424657534246576
5540100,5,B00B08FLVO,"I love The Band, especially Levon, he had such a compelling presence on stage. It was great to watch musicians, from across a wide spectrum of generations and genres, come together to pay homage to this American treasure. The cover of ""Tears of Rage"" was so beautiful, it nearly brought me to tears. Lucinda Williams rendition of Whispering Pines was gorgeous and heart breaking. Yet there is such a sense of celebration in the performances that, while bittersweet, it was never sad.",1395014400,,483,4.902439024390244
5540101,3,B00B08FLVO,"I bought this primarily to watch the DVDs, and the sound of the musicians was great, but the vocals were muted a bit. Even my wife, who has a very untrained ear, mentioned that the vocals sucked. Too bad, because it became very unnerving as the show went on.",1390262400,,258,4.285714285714286
5540102,5,B00B08FLVO,"No Levon, but a great tribute!  Although I am NOT a fan of the music recorded by My Morning Jacket...it's this band that stole the show and played tremendously. I would rank this movie 3 stars if they were not involved. Larry Campbell is masterful as always and is the heart of everything that Levon has done over the past 5 to 10 years.",1388793600,,337,4.265625

5540108,2,B00B08FLVO,"Pretty disappointing concert, particularly for the price...Way to much focus on the backing band. Guest artists too few & far between. No real memorable or stand out covers of any of Levon's or the bands songs",1381795200,,209,4.833333333333333
5540109,3,B00B08FLVO,"Thank goodness for Grace Potter & My Morning Jacket. Without them this would have been a rambling,shambolic affair. Such a shame,as you can clearly see the intent to honour the great man. The stage band is so loose they almost lose it at times. Grace Potter's tribute,though,is so heartfelt it sends shivers down your spine. My point about the backing band is emphasised when My Morning Jacket come on & blow them off the stage.
It's sad when even the great John Hiatt can't convert the sound to his normally impeccable level. Worth having for a couple of performances,& great to see Marc Cohn on stage,but overall,a disappointment.",1378080000,,632,4.861111111111111

5540111,4,B00B08FLVO,"This benefit concert recording - 2 DVDs and 2 CDs of the DVDs -- captures perfectly the free-wheeling, raucous joy of musicians gathered to jam, just like the weekly sessions held in The Barn by the late Levon Helm, best known as the drummer for The Band.  Notable tracks include Dylan's ""This Wheel's on Fire,"" done by Shawn Pelton with the Levon Helm Band, a match giving the song even more weight than its '68 signature cover by Julie Driscoll and Brian Augur.  Grace Potter's power on ""I Shall Be Released"" can only be described as righteous.  Of course, on collaborations like these, one finds duds, too.  John Prine mumbles so badly through ""When I Paint My Masterpiece,"" you'd swear his mic was shrink-wrapped in wax.  And Roger Waters' audibly flat vocal on ""The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down"" hints that he was having some problems hearing himself.  Other guests include David Bromberg, Joan Osborne, Bruce Hornsby, John Hiatt, Ray LaMontagne, Joe Walsh, John Mayer, Mavis Staples - the list goes on.  The reverent spirit of this 2-disc affair culminates in the finale, ""The Weight,"" begun with a cappella harmonies and finished with a big, circus-tent hug from the entire crew of performers.  Take a load off, Levon; take a load for free.",1377820800,2,1250,4.808411214953271

5540113,3,B00B08FLVO,"I have a strange soft spot for performances of music by other than the original singers or bands.  ???  In any case I have never been a huge fan of Levon or his group so I ordered the dvd on the reviews posted on Amazon which is usually a tried and true indication of quality.  What I got was a collection of music I didn't particularly care for to begin with by a bunch of performers I didn't know in most cases.  The disc is technically fine; sound and picture are top notch.  Sooooo, if you are a fan of the music of Levon and/or the Band, this is probably of interest;  otherwise not so much.",1376092800,,596,4.094827586206897

5540115,5,B00B08FLVO,"This is a well put together film, all involved expressing their love for Levon and his music. I loved the Band; they did everything with such incredible heart and Levon's steady beat or lead vocal were studies in rock, country, blue grass, r&b and genres I never knew of before I heard the band. This DVD/CD captures the sass and sway of Levon Helm. If you love the Band, if you love Levon Helm, if you love the most talented of performers, if you just love good music, I highly recommend.",1373673600,,489,4.384615384615385

The DVD let me see stuff going on on stage I would never have seen from my seats.  The interviews with some of the performers were informative and touching.  I thought the DVDs and CDs sounded great and took me right back to the concert experience - definitely the concert highlight of my life so far.  The only thing I thought was strange was that the CDs did not include most of the introductions or Roger Waters' great story towards the end.  The songs are not listed on the CDs themselves either.

I would recommend this CD/DVD to new and old Levon fans alike.  You also get a lot for your money with this purchase.  Personal highlights of the show for me were the performances by Garth Hudson, Lucinda Williams, Grace Potter, Roger Waters, the guest drummers, Joe Walsh with Robert Randolph, the Midnight Ramble Band and every time Larry Campbell was on the fiddle.  The whole experience was a wonderful tribute/fund raiser in memory of an amazing man with an incredible lineup of musicians.",1370476800,2,1143,4.53170731707317

5540125,5,B00B08FLVO,"A tribute to Levon with many famous guests singing his well-known songs. Loved all the singers, especially Warren Haynes who got the concert off on just the right note. Gregg Allman was wonderful singing Long Black Veil. Eric Church was towards the end, but he tore up Get Up Jake just right. Grace Potter is beautiful and her voice is just right for I Shall Be Released. Who doesn't like John Prine singing When I Paint My Masterpiece. Jakob Dylan, Mavis, Lucinda, John Hiatt, Raay LaMontagne--just so many notables on this I cannot begin to name them all. And a special shout out to the All-Star Band--truly incredible.

5540132,5,B00B08FLVO,"OK - That's a pretty bold claim but it would be hard to imagine one that tops it. This is up in the realm of Dylan's Bobfest or The Last Waltz. It's not just the pantheon of legendary performers but the mastery and the artistry of each one. They span a lot of age groups and musical styles but every one gave a beautiful and heartfelt performance. The cool thing about this show is that the players who didn't take the spotlights are the people who have always made the stars sound great for years. Everyone knows the headliners but the depth of the horn bench, rhythm section and background vocals was astounding. Larry Campbell deserves a special shout-out for pulling it all together and in particular for his stratospheric performance on ""Wide River to Cross"" with Roger Waters and Amy Helm. I read another review which described him as being outside his body - I know I was outside of mine listening to it. If you already love Levon's music, you'll love this even more.

I've been a big fan of the Band and all it's later permutations, but this seems a bit rushed. First, where was Clapton, who has said on several occasions that he wanted to join The Band? And Dylan? While I didn't expect to see Robbie Robertson, those two might have thrown in for Levon, no? As to the extras on the dvd, I thought this was a benefit to keep the Barn & the Rambles going, yet not one mention of it of it's history. You'd think that as my $$ were supposedly going to help, there'd be some mention of what the Midnight Rambles were all about?

Earlier in 2012 I had purchased tickets to Levon at the Longwood Gardens in Philly but news of his failing health made that impossible so this show was a must see and it lived up to the hype. Each artist (and the supporting band) brought their A game (I wish Bruce Hornsby would have picked a different song but on the DVD he is vindicated). My favorite was Grace Potter who gave a stirring gospel like renditon of ""I Shall be Released"" and the finale with everyone singing ""The Weight"" and taking a turn was a fitting ending.

5540149,3,B00B08FLVO,"These types of tribute concerts are always a mixed bag, as you get a wide selection of artists from all over the musical spectrum that don't necessarily mesh together in a night's program, playing with a backing band that they haven't gotten to rehearse much with.  That being said, the organizers did a better job than most in putting together people and songs that made some kind of sense in terms of providing a tribute to Levon (a huge musical personality, and wonderful singer and drummer but not really a songwriter).  That many of the songs were by Robbie Robertson, who Levon feuded with famously right to the end, is ironic.  Robertson, as you might expect, was not in attendance, but Garth Hudson (looking quite elderly and frail, but still tearing it up on keyboards and accordion) was.  And where was Dylan (whose songs were also featured during the concert)?  Seems pretty disrespectful that he wasn't there.

The show gets off to a shaky start with Warren Haynes doing a tentative version of ""The Shape I'm In,"" but then things pick up.  Highpoints include Mavis Staples, energizing the band and crowd (albiet with a gospel song), John Prine giving his all on ""When I Paint My Masterpiece"" while looking in shockingly-ill health and not having a lot of voice left, Grace Potter playing some subtle, soulful Hammond B-3 and doing an emotional version of ""I Shall be Released"" (although watching her drummer's stage demeanor was really off-putting), and Marc Cohn surprising me, at least, with a great song he wrote about Levon back in '06.

I felt bad for Joan Osborne, who always does a sterling job at these things, being paired with David Bromberg for a vocal duet on ""Don't Do It.""  Joan tore it up, as you would expect, but Bromberg has a bizarre voice that seems more suited for light opera and it just didn't fit the material at all.  It would have made more sense to have him back in the band playing guitar on that song, and letting Joan sing it alone or with Larry or maybe Jakob Dylan.

My Morning Jacket, while seeming deeply respectful of the occasion and giving their all, turned in performances that, to me anyway, lacked nuance and subtlety.  ""It Makes No Difference"" is such a powerful song, and I couldnt' help but feel like I was just seeing a cover band in some bar here in Austin.  They hadn't really done anything to make it their own, and much of the magic was lost.  Maybe that's just as good as they can do it, in which case it's more a failure of the show organizers than the band themselves.  The same was true for the other songs they did--competent, but nothing special musically.

Oddly enough, the most rocking moment came when Joe Walsh traded licks with gospel steel player Robert Randolph during ""Up on Cripple Creek.""  Incidiary stuff!  It has to be said, though, that Randolf pretty much wrecked the finale of ""The Weight"" with his sloppy playing while engaging in grandstanding stage schtick (jumping up on his chair while playing, etc.).

So anyway, definitely worth watching once.  You probably won't watch it twice.  Not a bad show at all, but I'm not entirely sure it captured that down-home Levon feeling.  The all-star backing band was super-tight, and the drummer was Kenny Aronoff.  He's a fantastic drummer who I like a lot, but to my mind he's more of a power drummer and therefore an odd choice for a night of music that was a tribute to Levon's drumming as much as anything else.....I would have thought Jim Keltner might have been a better choice, and he certainly has done these types of shows before.  And while there were songs specifically put in the program that sounded like mountain music, I always felt that Levon represented a unique synthesis of that music with many other American roots forms.  I'm not sure that I got a feel, as the night went on, that the show was capturing that synthesis....it was more like ""here's the rock number, now here's the mountain music number.""  Anyway, this is quibbling to some extent.  You'll definitely enjoy watching the show.",1366156800,17,4036,4.6879432624113475

5540158,5,B00B08FLVO,"Truth be told, if this collection were viewed out of context, I would probably rate it three stars. But there is context here - see the title - and that makes it pretty easy to overlook the occasional misses.

The most egregious of those misses is probably Dierks Bentley's rendition of ""Chest Fever"". After an abbreviated but fantastic organ flourish by Garth himself, Bentley's vocal just sort of lays there limply. (Ironically, present on the stage were a couple of people who could sing the hair off that song, and did so at a couple of Rambles that I attended.) This is especially mystifying since Bentley had just concluded a very nice rendition of ""Rockin' Chair"", although  perhaps that song is more suited to his country-style vocals than the flat-out rock of ""Chest Fever"". Beyond that, I was not thrilled with the presence of Roger Waters and Joe Walsh, both of whom I respect but neither of whom seemed to fit the overall tone of the evening (though Waters' story about Levon giving him his hat was a nice touch). A few other performances are acceptable but unmemorable.

But then there are a few highlights that redeem the whole thing and make the price of this package worth every penny. Ray LaMontagne's soulful rendition of ""Tears Of Rage"" is wonderful; David Bromberg and Joan Osborne team up for a rocking ""Don't Do It""; John Hiatt does full justice to ""Rag Mama Rag""; and Jim James, with My Morning Jacket, completely slays on ""It Makes No Difference"".

Then there is the one performance that takes the whole thing to another level - Lucinda Williams' ""Whispering Pines"", a breathtaking performance that is at once respectful, authoritative and completely her own. I don't think I've ever heard anybody try to sing this song since it appeared on the Brown album, and I think Richard would have approved of this attempt wholeheartedly.

The whole point of this event was for the musicians to show their love and respect for Levon Helm, one of the few truly authentic people in the music business. I would say that this purpose was accomplished very effectively here, and the extended interviews that accompany the video portion nicely expand on that. That the proceeds from this event will go to help save the Barn makes it that much sweeter.",1364860800,,2260,4.7846153846153845
5540159,1,B00B08FLVO,"I have never looked forward to Blu-ray release more and then been so disappointed.  The audio on this Blu-ray is atrocious -- so much so that I returned the product to Amazon for a refund.  The various audio problems are discussed in some detail in this Amazon discussion thread:

http://www.amazon.com/Buyer-Beware-High-Resolution-Blu-ray-Version/forum/Fx3M135PL47AO10/Tx1QCGQKG05E183/1/ref=cm_cd_ef_rt_tft_tp?_encoding=UTF8&asin=B00B08FLT6

Quick summary: No high-resolution audio content, only 48kHz Dolby Digital 2.0 and Dolby Digital 5.1.  The two lossy audio tracks are horribly compressed with little dynamic range or top end to speak of.  To make matters worse, at some point in the concert, the audio simply drops out from the 5.1 track's right surround channel.

The video quality and musical performances are very good to excellent, but for me the entire production is ruined because of the horrendous sound -- hence, my one-star review.

I emailed mastering engineer Doug Sax about these problems on March 27th.  The text of my email is reproduced below.  (As of April 21st, I still have not heard back from Mr. Sax.)

* * * *

""Good afternoon, Mr. Sax. As a music lover and audiophile, I have long been a fan of your outstanding mastering work. That is why it pains me to have to write about the ""Love for Levon"" Blu-ray that just came out. The sound is horribly compressed on both the 2.0 and 5.1 layers, with little dynamic range or top end to speak of.

To make matters worse, there is no high-resolution audio layer, only Dolby Digital 2.0 and 5.1 (and at only 48 kHz, no less).

Finally, there is an apparent defect on the 5.1 mix. Specifically, at some point during the concert the sound drops out on the right surround channel. (I read about this drop-out issue on Amazon and tested ""It Makes No Difference"" by My Morning Jacket. Sure enough, the audio was gone in the right surround channel.)

I attempted to contact Time Life though its 800 number and its web site to report these problems, but was given the brush-off each time.

I have arranged a hassle-free full refund through Amazon, so this is not a money issue for me. The reason I am writing is that I love Levon Helm's music and am a big fan of many of the ""Love for Levon"" performers. I am hoping that something can be done to get this Blu-ray re-issued with defect-free and good-sounding high-resolution audio (either DTS-HD Master Audio, Dolby TrueHD or uncompressed PCM). Anything you can do in that regard would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks very much.

Sincerely yours,""",1364774400,21,2559,4.995283018867925

5540164,3,B00B08FLVO,"I first saw Levon with the Hawks backing Dylan and last saw him with his band in Central Park at a Summerstage benefit about a year before his passing. He was a great American musician whose commitment to and love of the music always shown through.

Three stars, not five. Hmmm? Why? Five stars would be my review for Levon. I would give him six stars if I could. But is this a five star show? Almost every cut recreates the original recorded arrangement, new voices dropped in and some new lead instrumental breaks -- at least those did not get played note-for-note. But then again, when were instrumental breaks important to the Band -- the core of whose music and its stunning rebuke to the vocal and instrumental ""Gods"" of the day -- was the weaving together of vocal lines and instrumental lines. Music as community.

The Hawks backed Bob Dylan at the 1967 Woody Guthrie commemoration at Carnegie Hall. After an hour of respectful acoustic guitar reproductions of Woody's music, up came Bob and the boys and they tore through three total deconstructions of Guthrie songs. I thought ""That's it; that's the spirit of Woody Guthrie."" Its not a museum; its music. Things hanging in a museum are finished, complete. I wanted someone to rethink Levon's music, show how it influenced them, not just how they can reproduce it. Jakob Dylan comes closest to achieving this; too bad his dad did not join him for the show.

The flaw in the reproduction approach is you end up mentally comparing the copy with the original. It is hard to listen to these versions in their own right because they don't exist in their own right. They are mimicry. Some of them are great. Can Alain Toussaint do anything wrong? I doubt it. Ditto Mavis Staples, but go back to the version of ""The Weight"" with Mavis and Pop on ""The Last Waltz"" for inspiration. Warren Haynes may be the greatest chameleon in music -- who else can stand in for Jerry Garcia, Duane Allman and Dickie Betts so effectively? But I can only wait for the offkey meandering through ""The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down"" to end. I ride on the joy of My Morning Jacket's ""Ophelia"" but when the horns omit the quote from ""Dixie"" at the end it turns into a letdown because its a copy so I expect that flourish. I suspect the bar backstage had been well used before the group comes back to completely miss the vocals on ""Wide River to Cross."" A song that moved me to tears when Levon sang it, just crawls along.

The majority of the reproductions are just fine; I can pick the tracks I enjoy for my IPOD. But a great group of musicians copying a great musician without adequate rehearsal time does not great music make.",1364256000,4,2660,4.535416666666666
5540165,5,B00B08FLVO,"I only saw Levon two times, once in Nova Scotia at the launch of the rejuvinated Band during the '80s and at a New Years gig in a small theater in Tarrytown on New Years Eve, 1997 (I believe). At that gig, a flat of beer was opened in front of the stage and the theater owners sold pints while the band played (ahhh, those were fond memories). I regret not attending this tribute to Levon. This was a concert which truly reflected the widespread love and affection Levon Helm had earned. As Rogers Waters put it ""There is a lot of love in this room"". Almost all of the songs were those originally played by the Band, which raised the point ""where was Robbie Robertson""? I had understood that there was some sort or reproachment between he and Levon before Helm died. Its too bad he did not attend to pay tribute to his old firend. However, Garth Hudson more than made up for it, adding the ""eccentric"" element crucial to the band to songs he played on (particularly, of course, Chest Fever). Great players abounded, standouts for me being Allan Toussiant, My Morning Jacket and Levon's own band. Great guitar players, including Jim Weider, G.E. Smith and others. Some reviews worried about the potential sound issues with the recording (based on the actual sound of the night performed). No need to worry there. This concert stands proudly along the set from the '90s tribute for Bob Dylan (which Levon, Garth and Rick played on). Heck, when is THAT one going to be released on DVD or Bluray??!!?? One more thought, on hearing beautiful renditions of ""It makes no difference"", ""Whispering Pines"" and ""Tears of Rage"", I felt the concert was also a tribute to Richard and Rick. Again, since Robertson wrote most of the songs, it is a shame he did not show up to pay tribute to three of his old band mates.",1364083200,7,1803,4.533742331288344

5540168,3,B00B08FLVO,"I'm splitting this review up -

Content - 5 stars. Its nothing short of killer if your into The Band.

Audio mix - 1 star. The blu ray 5.1 mix is, by far, the WORST 5.1 mix I've ever heard on a concert disc. I own literally dozens of concert dvds and blu rays and am in no way audio snob, but this mix is basically unlistenable and I've never had this problem with any other disc. I honestly think there could be quality control issue here, it's that bad. After messing with all combinations of settings on my home theater, I think that selecting the 2-channel mix, and using the Pro Logic II Music preset or the 5 channel stereo is the best I'm going to get it. Bummer.

Edit: After more research, I lose the rear right sound of the 5.1, after the 'break' before Eric Church. So where the DVD version, disc 1 would end, where the blu ray picks up dvd disc 2, I lose rear right.

The concert features a ""Who's Who"" of rock, pop, soul, blues, and gospel stars performing songs associated with Helm (and The Band) in interesting combinations and without pretense.  Hell, even Roger Waters of the progressive rock giant Pink Floyd is on board.  It is an engrossing show with numerous high points.  I'm a huge Allen Toussaint fan and he perfectly nails ""Life is a Carnival.""  My Morning Jacket is a great fit for a rousing ""Ophelia.""

These songs, many written by Robbie Robertson of The Band, have become American standards and this great show demonstrates how vital they are today to musicians from all genres.  Levon Helm's Midnight Ramble Band, led by master guitarist Larry Campbell sounds great throughout the show.  Some of the performances are ""ragged but right"" at times, evoking the spontaneous spirit of Levon himself.  It is great to see The Band's Garth Hudson wail on the organ in ""Chest Fever"" for his missing bandmate.  This is a labor of love, rooted in the songs and spirit of Levon Helm.  Highly recommended for fans of ""real"" American music.",1361232000,57,1514,4.836575875486381

5540179,5,B00B08FLVO,"I'm quite baffled by some negative reviews posted here. I sat ten rows up from stage left and could see all the artists as they prepared to take the stage. Lots of comraderie. I saw the Band perform at Watkins Glen,Roosevelt Stadium and most of the other venues in the area. Saw em twice with Dylan and was arrested at one of their shows. I thought this was a fitting tribute to a great artist. There were performers from The Allman Bros.,Pink Floyd,The Eagles,Govt Mule, The Wallflowers and so much more. The crowd was so into this show as were the artists. I'd never heard of Grace Potter before but her take on ""I Shall Be Released"" was a revelation. Joe Walsh roamed the stage like a wildman. I saw Joe at the Count Basie two yrs back and Levon sat in on drums for ""Rocky Mountain Way"". I've seen 100's of concerts over the last 40+ yrs and many had sound issues for the first few tunes. Here ya had artist after artist plugging in and out of the sound system. JohnPrine was great. He has battled cancer also. They will remaster the sound but the visuals can't be beat. Order this...you won't be sorry as long as you keep in mind this was a short notice show performed by artists that wanted to be there for the Love of Levon...as was the vast majority of the packed house. It was Electric.",1361145600,19,1294,4.329218106995885
5540180,5,B00B08FLVO,"I agree with the critics in here to a point. There was some horrendous sound during SOME of the songs. And I think they should have had at least one big screen up for those of us towards the back. However, I wouldn't trade that night for anything. Between interacting with all the Levon fans at the show, feeling the love of the artists on stage when they spoke of Levon (my favorite being Roger Waters and the hat he brought) and the acts that I could actually hear good (My Morning Jacket was great, Grace Potter was mesmerizing, etc ..) it was very much worth my time and money. I'm hopeful that this Blu Ray recording will enable me to hear the acts I couldn't really make out while I was there. I'm definitely going to buy it.",1361145600,12,731,4.266187050359712
