8188822,4,B000P46S8O,"Here we have an ""Aida"" with six principal voices of the appropriate displacement, a conductor who knows the score like the back of his hand (although overfamiliarity sometimes seems to lapse into carelessness), and set and costume designs by the team of Ezio Frigerio and Franca Squarciapino, which means this is the best-looking ""Aida"" for which one can hope. Director Nicolas Joel has relocated the story to the colonial Egypt of the late 19th century. The King of Egypt is, for instance, a dead ringer for ""Chinese"" Gordon in the movie ""Khartoum."" Although his program note seems to promise a tendentious, anti-imperialistic tract, his direction focuses on the personal rather than the spectacular ... albeit partly a necessity, given the smallish Zurich Opera stage. There are a few eccentricities, as when the Dance of the Priestesses is played while the priests line up and high-five Ramfis (Matti Salminen) but Joel's direction is very sensible in the main.

To find a substandard vocal performance you'd have to burrow down to Miroslav Christoff's tonally constipated Messenger. Gunther Groissbock's King of Egypt sounds regal indeed and Salminen is a potent vocal presence, although Verdian ductus does not flow naturally from his throat. The late Salvatore Licitra provides a genuine spinto voice, conscientiously deployed, as Radames, comparing most favorably to the pushed-up lyric sounds of Roberto Alagna [Decca]. Luciana D'Intino has a real sledgehammer of an Amneris voice and tends to use it accordingly, if with more shading than in the notorious Covent Garden telecast [Kultur]. She is capital in the Judgment and Tomb scenes, however. Nina Stemme's Aida is altogether subtler, flowing through the music with limpid beauty and a beguiling variety of expression. She takes to Verdi's writing so naturally, one would not know Stemme is mainly a dramatic soprano of the Strauss/Wagner axis. A pity that she flats the high C in ""O patria mia,"" which will spoil her performance for some. Despite having the most vocal mileage of any of the principals, Juan Pons (Amonasro) more than anyone offers an idiomatically Verdian performance, alone commanding a range from pianissimo to fortissimo.

Video director Andy Sommers uses split-screen imagery to occasionally vary one's perspective on the action but this distracting (IMO) device is kept to a thankful minimum. (Sommers also gives an interview that fairly defines ""pretentious."") Most of his work is laudable. There is also a 52-minute documentary on the history of ""Aida"" in Cairo, although it's slow going at first ... Joel mumbles, hems and haws so much that it must be infuriating for singers and musicians waiting for him to get to the point. Unless you simply must have an ""Aida"" set in ancient Egypt, I'd put this DVD near the top of the pyramid. The Met/DG ""Aida"" has comparable strengths (and weaknesses) but I find it suffocatingly pompous. Unless the Met can ever be induced to release its Price/Cossotto/McCracken/Estes telecast under Levine, choosing just one video ""Aida"" is going to entail a certain measure of compromise ... unless you choose the Tucci/Simionato/del Monaco performance on VAI&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Verdi-Aida/dp/B000RW3YN6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Verdi - Aida</a>&nbsp;-- Simionato's Judgment Scene blows her competition to smithereens.

8188823,1,B000P46S8O,Good idea to stage this warhorse as 19th century English colonial drama but filming is unwatchable--switching to multi-screen on a whim. Fire Andy Sommer(I think he has been in recent years).  Singers all worth hearing and seeing and sets typical of Nicolas Joel's other romantic productions.

8188825,2,B000P46S8O,"I wanted the full treatment. I rented this video - and was glad I did not buy it. Why do they insist on modernizing a glorious idea. They used Victorian English costumes instead of Egyptian and Etheopian, Yech. Couldn't even tell which woman was AIDA until she sang.  I prefer a much richer soprano. The only GREAT singer is the Tenor.  But, the staging killed this production for me.",1383436800,,384,4.550724637681159
8188826,4,B000P46S8O,"Vocally an outstanding performance.  However, it is the ugliest set/costume design I have ever seen in Aida.  But if your main interest is vocal then by all means buy it.  Nina Stemme/Salvatore Licitra/Luciana D'Intino are all superb both vocally and dramatically.  I thoroughly enjoyed the disc.",1340236800,,296,5.369565217391305

The drama is gripping; they're not just standing around singing into space.  I was fortunate to have heard Salvatore Licitra in person many times; watching this is a reminder of why I went so many places, so many times, to see him.  I recommend this DVD 100%.",1339113600,,433,4.405063291139241
8188828,5,B000P46S8O,"This is a recording of a Zurich Opera performance from May 2006.

I thought the overall staging and costuming were quite attractive. Dressing up everyone as British citizens may be contradictory to the libretto, but the effect is really not distracting at all. The intent was to show Egypt in the 19th c when it was occupied by the British, French, and the Ottoman Empire.

Some comments here have sharply criticized the modernized staging. But what we see in the Zurich Aida is actually pretty tame compared to the modernization done in the typical Wagner production. The practices of Patrice Cherau and Harry Kupfer are far, far more extreme than anything seen in this DVD.

The singing was really wonderful all around. Nina Stemme is very effective as Aida. I had just finished watching Matti Salminen in Tristan und Isolde, so it was great to see his versatility as Ramfis. I had only heard Salvatore Licitra and Juan Pons on CDs, so this was my first chance to see them on stage; both were first rate as singers and actors. Luciana d'Intino was fabulous. It makes you wonder why this opera wasn't called ""Aida e Amneris"" since Amneris gets almost as much stage time as the title character. The chorus juggled their numerous roles (prisoners, slaves, soldiers, priests) with admirable professionalism.

The DVD uses frequent split screen shots to good effect. The ballet dancers were ushered in quite cleverly as prisoners in cages. And I was impressed by how economically the processional scene was staged: in lieu of an elaborate parade, we instead see sightseers gazing toward the back of the stage at a shadow show as soldiers try to maintain crowd control.

I can't say enough of the pristine recorded sound; you really feel like turning up the volume in some spots. The Zurich Opera orchestra, conducted by Adam Fischer, is marvelous. Audience noise was minimal.

This two-disc set comes with a handsome booklet filled with many color still shots from the production. Subtitles are available in many languages.

Disc 2 includes the documentary ""The True False Story of Aida"" (52"", 2007). This documentary discusses not only the Zurich production of Aida, but also some related history of the Cairo Opera and the Suez Canal. The film includes many scenes of modern day Egyptian life, and even a demonstration of Don Giovanni in Arabic. The documentary, however, never really tells you what the ""false"" story is.

Disc 2 also includes an interview with film director Andy Sommer (12"", 2007).

Both extra features are in French with English subtitles.",1306108800,5,2558,4.944055944055944
8188829,4,B000P46S8O,"Eleita Cantora Internacional em Destaque por este blog em tempos pretritos, Nina Stemme nos apresenta Aida, de Giuseppe Verdi. Estou acostumado a ver essa pera com os clichs de sempre. Faras, mmias, tumbas, sarcfagos, pirmides e vai por a. A verso apresentada pelo diretor, Nicolas Jol elimina tudo isso. Sua pera se passa nos tempos do Egito colonial, dominado pelos ingleses, justamente na poca da sua composio. Idia interessante, que visa modernizar a pera , muitas vezes fica fora de contexto.

  Nina Stemme faz a primeira Aida que no se maquia de etope. Sua voz  de potncia avassaladora,  com estridncias em algumas passagens (Ser cansao?). Sua interpretao   deveras artificial. Ela e o diretor parecem que no se entenderam muito bem. O que se salva, entre mortos e feridos, ou melhor, entre ingleses e egpcios,  seu timbre, lrico-dramtico, escuro, quente, noturno como as noites sem luar do Nilo. Imagino que sua voz  mais adaptada para papis wagnerianos, sua Isolda  memorvel.

O destaque fica com Luciana D'Intino, vozeiro soberbo com extenso enorme. Sua interpretao se adapta s firulas do diretor, sua Amneris  apaixonada, revoltada e sacana. Salvatore Licitra  tenor com agudos que nos lembram o Pavarotti em melhor forma. Juan Pons e Matti Salminen do conta do recado como Amonasro e Ramfis.

A orquestra de Zurich, comandada por Adam Fischer, mostra andamentos corretos e sonoridade mais alem que italiana. O bal  cafona, os figurinos fazem o que manda a direo. Transportam a ao para o Egito do sculo XIX, dominado pela rainha Vitria. A direo de imagens inova, pem na tela diversos quadros de uma mesma cena. O efeito de ver o instrumento principal ser tocado junto com a atuao dos solistas e coro  deveras interessante.

 Ada, no  o melhor que Nina Steme pode apresentar, mas a sueca mostra que tem grande potencial para cantar papis pesados, em uma pera tipicamente italiana. Em breve comentarei mais gravaes com ela. O diretor de pera, Walter Neiva, definiu perfeitamente Nina Stemme em comentrio para este blog: ""Ela  uma Isolda maravilhosa, mas no repertrio italiano falta feeling, sua Aida est anos luz aqum  de sua Isolda. D para conferir no Youtube, l tem um concerto onde ela interpreta um Liebestod exemplar, imagino que seu timbre escuro era o que Wagner pretendia.""

8188830,1,B000P46S8O,"This Aida features Nina Stemme as Aida and she is very good, and the rest of cast is alright, but not great.

The production, done in 19th century garb, has to be the worst coceptions of Aida ever put on stage. The opera takes place in EGYPT, not Wimpole Street. It canno be changed..the period, the style, costumes etc. Aida can be under done or over the top, but never a 19th century piece.

The singers try with it, but it is so ludicrous and camp, ( see the openeing scenes with Amneris) and then, finally, distracting; you have to black out the picture and  just listen.

Rememeber Roger Debris in The Producers, with Zero Mostel. Roger was a director of shows that folded after the first act of the fist rehearsal. The designer of this production and all accomplices should have folded afeter the first note of the first act.

And of course this is very camp, but only for a while..it will go down in history as an Aida that only primaytes could lay any claim to.",1194393600,8,969,4.391061452513966
