It makes it seem like people where scared into stuttering as a kid, and they can be cured if they face their fear or cure themselves through mental work.  It's NOT true.  It makes a great movie, just pull a random cause of an imbalance that has an unknown cause, and make up a random cure that makes for a great movie.  The problem is it just feeds the false stereotypes.  This is something I wanted to sit down with my family with, because I wanted them to see what I go through but it was very fake.  It was dramatic, made for a great tear jerker, but it was entirely fabricated.  Stutters don't always stutter, with some people they may barely stutter while with others it can be severe, same goes for different circumstances, and there is no known cause, although research is leading towards a chemical imbalance.  I stuttered since I could talk but this movie makes it seem like it can happen out of no where at any age.  I regret supporting this with my money.",1392336000,,1079,4.297029702970297

This is what cinema was made for, and it's what drives

this review, because when I saw RevoLOUtion the first

time it really hit home. I believe this movie really

does have the potential to change people's lives, and

being a filmmaker myself I'm not usually the kind of

guy to lavish praise on any old film.

The picture stars Bret Carr as the stuttering boxer Lou Benedetti,

a guy who's spent his entire life channeling the anger

and confusion wrought by an abusive military father

into his career as a fighter. Shot in the streets of

New York City, the film offers an underground tour of

the self-proclaimed world's greatest city, with a

gritty realism that calls to mind some of the great

Scorsese flicks of decades past....

When his career is flung into jeopardy by the

diagnosis of a deadly brain aneurism, Lou is faced

with a challenge: either somehow overcome his lifetime

stuttering disability or be forced into the unenviable

life of an underground fight club rogue.  At this

point, the story holds the potential to swirl into a

sappy feel-good movie of minor significance, but Lou

keeps us on our feet as he shadow boxes a world of

dark and bitter elements with all the energy and power

a world-class fighter.  All this energy is channeled

into a powerfully conceived and choreographed climax

that will leave you breathless, I didn't know whether

to laugh or cry....

Revoloution was all the buzz of the Conscious Life

Film Festival here in Los Angeles, where I was lucky

enough to take it in earlier this year, and it

deservedly swept the competition, winning an audience

award for Best Picture. So I guess its not that

strange, but i'm happy to see it bundled here with

DaVinci Code of all films - one of the higher-ups must

have noticed it, cause it's not your typical Hollywood

fluff.

With a serious KNOCK OUT supporting cast that includes

the amazing Kumar Pallana (The Royal Tenenbaums) and

an impeccable performance by Burt Young from

Stallone's Rocky as himself, among others, you won't

be disappointed. But check your ego in at the door,

cause you may have to ignore that chip on the shoulder

to really take this one in. Take it as you will, I

seldom back down from a challenge....",1165276800,4,2294,4.650753768844221

Bret Carr delivers a powerful performance as Lou, a stuttering boxer whose career ends while the fight to bring his life back to normal begins. Initially, it seems like you've seen this kind of plot done before in a variety of movies about underdogs. However, RevoLOUtion is not as simple as it deceptively seems. Writer/director Bret Carr uses this deceptively simple plot to hook the viewer in an easy-to-follow way before getting into the complex aspects of what the press notes call a modernized shamanic ritual, but is actually a brililant rite of passage where Lou confronts his fears much like was done by Christopher Walken's character in The Deer Hunter, which Carr's writing partner was Oscar nominated for.  However, RevoLOUtion, violence is used as a means of transcendence in a particularly powerful scene. Lou's girlfriend (Didonna) doesn't love him back and even refuses to let him in her house. His only real friend is Kumar (Pallana), a vendor who gives him quick advice and a woman he meets named Starla (Benford) who acts as his Yoda-like spiritual guide. The second act wisely maintains focus on Lou's desperate struggle to overcome his stutter without going off on distracting subplots. As a director, Bret Carr proves to be inventive and unique as he uses shaky visuals to represent Lou's state of mind and includes well-shot, grainy flashbacks from Lou's childhood. The terrific, well-chosen soundtrack blends very well with the scenes. Ultimately, RevoLOUtion has enough energy and style to never overstay its welcome at a brief running time of 80 minutes.

It's inspiring and uplifting to watch Lou try to become an improved individual, both mentally and physically. His powerful transformation involves a shamanic ritual which requires him to look deep within himself to find his soul's true purpose. Lou comes to terms with a particularly traumatic experience from his childhood and finds the confidence to believe in himself--by getting to know himself. Right before his profound spiritual awakening, he has a near-death experience which he manages toovercome with strength of mind--and soul. He may not be able to change the world, but at least he manages to change the way he looks at the world through this challenging, life-changing shamanic ritual.",1165104000,4,2364,5.18586387434555
