3781923,5,B001RXDM36,"Visually sumptuous, the Fox and the Child is a small enchanting family film that is poetically tender and often precious.  It's the story of a young girl and her befriended red fox.  Kate Winslet's sparse narration is perfect.  This family film rivals the visual beauty of The Black Stallion.  ""Fox"" also ranks with the best family fare- Babe, Born Free, Duma, and The Yearling.",1247529600,,378,4.859375
3781924,5,B001RXDM36,"Luc Jacquet has done it again. While this film's locale and wildlife could not be more different from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/March-of-the-Penguins/dp/B000N3SSA8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">March of the Penguins</a>, it manages to capture that sense of humanity in animals.

The movie is half documentary/half children's tale, but has enough of both to satisfy all audiences. The film had some amazing footage of foxes and other wildlife. In one scene, a Bobcat chased the vixen through the forests, and the camera team caught most of the chase. I've seen just about every David Attenborough documentary made and many others, but my jaw was left gaping by that sequence. The chase was extremely fast-paced and through pretty dense woods, yet Jacquet's team caught it. There are also some beautiful shots of foxes standing in front of a full moon.

The children's movie half is very subtle and involves the girl (Bertille Nol-Bruneau) getting to know the fox and, ultimately, the realities of nature. The story has the sort of child's wisdom that readers of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Little-Prince/dp/0156012197/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Little Prince</a>&nbsp;(itself another French classic) will recognize. Bertille doesn't just scoop the fox up as a pet, but ultimately realizes that her vixen friend is a wild animal who lives in nature, and that their friendship must be on the fox's terms, not humanity's. In short, the movie's them is that love does not equal possession. Kids in America today, spoiled and overprotected, could learn a thing or two from this film.

At many points, I wondered where the nature documentary ended and where the fictional story began. The two genres flowed together seamlessly in the film. At many points, Bertille gets closer to dangerous animals such as brown bears and wolves than David Attenborough ever would. I would love to have seen a ""making of"" featurette for his movie.

The only drawback: Kate Winslet as the narrator. I'm not a fan of her voice (too husky) and though the girl (who incidentally had a charming voice) could have done the narration far better. Better yet, the DVD should have included an option to have the original french narrator, Isabelle Carre, with English subtitles.

In short, this would be a great gift for families with kids, or wildlife enthusiasts who are young at heart.",1247270400,3,2454,5.550802139037433
3781925,5,B001RXDM36,"The Europeans have revolutionized the ""nature film"" when one considers the excellence of movies such as the BBC ""Blue Planet"" ""Life of Birds"", or Cousteau's ""Sea Ghosts."" This movie about the growth of a friendship between a wild fox, its young, and a 10 year old (adorable) girl is equally as wonderful.  True, it has something of the Disney nature film aspect to it...but it so outstandingly photographed as to be the top of the class.

There are some tense moments in the film that add some dimension to the story such as the moment when both the ""Fox and the Child"" have to confront and escape 4 wild, hungry wolves in the forest. And there are tender moments when the fox comes to trust the girl after so many satisfactory encounters.

The director who produced the stunning ""March of the Penguins"" is behind this film...remember, he has the most exacting standards. I simply can't say enough positives about the cinematography of the wildlife in the French Alps.  And Kate Winslet tells the girl's story in sweet prose - it's the experience of having a beautiful book read aloud.

This is the kind of family film that we need in this society.  I am going to give lots of copies to friends and relatives over the Christmas holidays. Trust me, you can't go wrong with this one.",1244678400,3,1281,4.621145374449339

3781972,5,B001RXDM36,"This is a great film with plenty of documentary level (and even higher than that at times) wildlife footage combined with obvious pet/hand raised movie trained animals.  It doesn't have a lot of dialogue and that's what makes it work.  For the most of it, you're imaging a child is alone (as far as humans go) in the wilderness of the foothills of the Alps. Most of the speaking is actually a narration by the girl when she is an adult (what we see on the screens is the adult's recollections of her childhood where she ""made friends"" with a wild fox being told to us).  Who we as us is, isn't divulged, but you'd imagine where her kids or grand kids, school class, someone like that.  The narrator speaks like she's reading a picture book.  That narrator (on the English language version) is Kate Winslet. Obviously like any parent/grandparent telling a tale about themselves in their younger days, this tale of befriending a fox is obviously romanticised, embellished and parts perhaps even made up. The emerging from the caves scene next morning scene, the wolves encounter, the jumping on a cub from the talons of a large bird of prey, all seem ridiculous, until you remember, it's an adult telling a story to someone with a child's attention span, who is trying to impress that child, that they were young and cool once.  We aren't told for example how she managed to get home with a broken leg about ten minutes in, we just see her at home (trapped there all winter) with her leg in a cast reading fox books and imagining what her fox is doing.  In fact we don't see her parents at all in the film.  We hear their voices at one stage, but that's it apart from seeing her father driving home near the end.  Like a picture book character she wears the same outfit the whole film.

Being it's a flashback memory experience film we know the girl obviously doesn't die although she does put herself in danger a number of times so there is a bit of tension that younger age kids who have forgotten or didn't realise it's a flashback might fear for the girl.  We as adults also know she is hindering the fox's chances of survival since it is too scared to emerge from its burrow when she is initially around, can't hunt with her nearby and things like this. We also know of the detrimental effects on an animal by feeding it and it associating humans with food.  But she is child who thinks she is there to help the fox and they will become friends. There's plenty of instances like this where we are reminded she is a naive child with although good intentions, puts herself and the fox in danger.  It does have a realistic scene near the end where she learns the difference between appreciate a wild animal and it becoming her pet/friend. that those who thought they'd eventually sit around and have a tea party with her teddy bears or something might not like.

There's some spectacular wild animal footage filmed. The lynx and fox chase scene for one. You'll also see a bear, wolves, otters, big frogs, hedgehogs and a lot of other wildlife. At times it's obvious that ""lily"" isn't the same fox and obviously quite a number were used simply as they look different.  But overall this is a really good movie, that's hard to fault.  Set in France but filmed in a few countries such as Italy that the Alps go through. It's also nice to see a film where a kid can be a kid free of overparnoid parents and go outside and play and explore.  It's a flashback and although we don't know exactly what time period the attempt to become friends with a fox occurred, it's nice to see and is plausible.  I remember in the 80's, younger than the girl in this movie, I'd go camping with my parents, I'd get up in the morning, make my breakfast, they'd sleep in, I'd go off on my own and explore, maybe come back to make some lunch and find a note to meet them somewhere but often I wouldn't see my parents again until nighttime.  Heaps of other kids did the same thing.  So in these much safer times, if you're the type of parent that freaks out if your kid goes another aisle away while your having a conversation with them in a department store, then Fox & Child probably isn't the movie for you.  Also if you were after a talking animal film or wanted the fox to act like a human, perhaps you should get a copy of Robin Hood instead. But if you can appreciate great wildlife interaction and animals behaving pretty much like they do in the wild, can handle a little bit scary situations and a bit of blood, then The Fox and the Child is definitely a movie that you and your family will enjoy and remember for a long time.",1473897600,,4610,4.393654524089307
3781973,4,B001RXDM36,"This movie is kind of reminiscent of the old animal-story films from way back - it's just a young girl trying to befriend a wild fox.  That's pretty much the whole plot - there's only one human in the whole film (although the original French version has an additional scene at the end with the grown girl talking to her little son); she speaks to the fox a few times and there's a narration over the movies, and that's all the talking.  The movie is full of beautiful scenery and wildlife scenes, so it's kind of reminiscent of a nature documentary and is lovely to look at, if you enjoy nature.  If you prefer non-stop screaming and fighting, you may find this boring, but if you don't mind a slow, gentle, outdoor ""adventure"" you should find it a welcome change from most of what's out there these days.  It's not completely ""peaceful"" - nature (and it's interactions with people) can be harsh - there's predation (animals eating animals - although it doesn't show them tearing gizzards out or anything, just gulping down a rodent), animals trying to attack each other, animals getting poisoned and shot at by people, and an animal falling and getting bloody and possibly killed.  So, if you have sensitive kids you may want to screen this and/or have a talk beforehand.  In fact, if you have young children there's probably a few things you should discuss with them after watching this - like, ""never leave a fire unattended in the woods"" or ""don't touch wild animals, you could get rabies,"" not to mention the danger of a child confronting a pack of wolves . . . So, with these caveats, this is a really nice nature/animal fiction movie.",1471132800,,1641,4.602739726027397

3781975,3,B001RXDM36,"I checkes this movie out from the library. I don't recall ever seeing it vefore. Since I was going to take a nap my husband sat and watched the mocie with the kids or at least part of it. I told my husband about some of the reviews/reviewer concerns. When I woke up he ended up asking me the same questions other reviewerst has, ""How is this a G movie?"". He said our 5 year son said the movie was weird. I am guessing he is referring to the part of the movie my husband told me about where the fox goes crazy and runs around the room. Our 6 yr old liked it. She said it was cool. Our 3 yr old said she doesn't like it cause the fox died and he was out the window. (Her words) When I asked our 5 yr old son if he liked the movie, he made a strange face, like the face you would make if you tasted something weird. He said no because the fox jumped out of the window.",1465603200,,865,3.811111111111111
3781976,5,B001RXDM36,I love the fox & her puppies. The good lesson is that if you love wild animals allow them to be free don't try to catch them to own them. The child's time in the forest with the fox was whimsical. Warning children do not ever try to confront a pack of wolves they are wild predators who are territorial & opportunistic eaters. The part of the movie where the little girl confronts a pack of wolves by herself is unpractical.,1463616000,2,424,4.246913580246914
3781977,1,B001RXDM36,"I'm giving this movie 1 star because, in my opinion, this is not a ""G"" movie and safe for young kids.  That is, if you don't mind your young children watching a ""G"" rated movie that shows a fox being poisoned and going into convulsions and dying while a hunter lays in wait to shoot the foxes mate when it discovers it dead on the ground.  My 7 and 9 year old girls have been having nightmares for the last two nights.  Of course, I accept partial responsibility for not screening the movie, but shouldn't have to screen a ""G"" rated movie.",1459123200,2,539,4.264705882352941

3781996,1,B001RXDM36,"Completely lacking the whimsical atmosphere promised in the trailer. Its slow. Its boring. Its confusing. It captures nothing special about the nostalgic childhood joy of nature. I was hoping for some more interesting interactions between the girl and the fox. For reading a book about foxes I was expecting the girl would use her knowledge to help earn the fox's trust, thus driving the plot and making her character more appealing. Instead she simply earns the fox's trust by accident. Even more disappointing, the movie doesn't seem to celebrate these moments, it simply moves onto the next scene, missing the appeal of the genera entirely.

The cinematography is beautiful. Every other shot was a breathtaking forest vista full of trees waiting to be climbed, hidden fox dens, spring fields in bloom and shallow pool teaming with frogs and tadpoles. If the movie had stronger editing and a stronger plot it could have easily used these magical places to create something really special.",1437177600,,990,5.111111111111111

3782000,4,B001RXDM36,"Beautiful slow moving film that kids will love (5 yr old and 10 old loved it equally). As mentioned in previous reviews, the last moments of the film closes (spoiler alert) with a bloodied, unsightly beloved fox, which greatly upset my 5 year old after a whole film of coming to love this fox. The fox ends up fine. I alerted my son that this was going to happen before we watched it, to be prepared, and even that caused some anxiety anticipating it. Not sure how to best approach that kind of thing.  There were also some darker scary undertones of wild animals in the forest that cause no harm, but the darkness and the music shift definitely can get spooky for the little ones.

For the 10 year old, she loved it, all parts. It's a film that sticks with you and tugs the emotional chords. Simple, steady and sweet (with some spooky and scary, but brief!!).",1432080000,4,860,4.40251572327044

3782009,5,B001RXDM36,"I have to disagree with other reviewers. Both of my kids (ages 3 and 4) LOVE this movie. I don't think it's inappropriate for younger children. It shows the true reality and delicacy of nature as well as all its dangers. My girls were sad about the fox and very concerned but in the end it taught them about the wild and all its creatures. My 3 yr old (who incidentally constantly tries to smother the cat with love by sitting on her) realized on her own that the fox wasn't happy and was scared and said, ""I will never lock my kitty in again because she will be sad and might get hurt!"". This is a foreign film so American parents with a ""the world we show our kids should be all cream and candy"" outlook will find the ending jolting. I, on the other hand, found it refreshing. The little girl's character grows so much in this film and her realizations are far beyond some adults'. This is a magical story about love and youth.

It was terrible for such a young child and I feel like there should have been some kind of warning.

Seriously! She only saw it one time, but for over a year afterwards she would randomly, just out of the blue and in a sad tone, say : ""the fox jumped out the window."" :( I think she was a little traumatized.

I sat to watch it with my 4 year old grandson and am soooo sorry I didn't preview first. The child is intrigued by the sight of a fox and follows it through a winter where she manages to break an ankle when she falls. She then pursues her quest through a summer. She baits the animal with food so she could get a closer look and earn the animals trust. She follows this wild animal through the woods, jumping over ravines with rushing water below, encounters other wild animals, and gets lost in a cavern. She spends a night in the woods until her parents (who you never see) come looking for her. She tries to turn this fox into a dog by putting a bandanna around it's neck and attaching it to a rope. She winds up bringing it in her home where it jumps out a window. I sat through this entire movie explaining to my grandson that ""this is a bad thing to do"", ""you should never go into the woods alone"", ""wild animals are not pets"", etc, etc. I was VERY disappointed in this film and would not recommend it to anyone with children of any age.",1398556800,3,1150,4.115555555555556

If you watch this movie, you will regret it. This movie is one of the most ridiculous and unrealistic movies I have ever seen. The best part about this movie is the cinematography. The landscape is breathtaking and the nature shots are amazing. But that is about where it stops.
-First off: It's fine to love and explore nature, but taking a WILD ANIMAL THAT COULD KILL YOU into your house and locking it in your room WITH YOU is absurd and dangerous!
-You can't ""befriend"" an untamed animal. And the fact that she MIGHT have been friends with the fox is not well portrayed. She takes it into her house against its will and nearly kills the girl and itself in its attempts to escape its imprisonment
-This girl makes many unadmirable choices throughout this film. She wanders the woods at night alone and encounters caves, bears, etc. and is trapped in a tree. Her parents are not informed with her whereabouts and you probably won't see them the ENTIRE MOVIE.
-The girl is a complete whackjob, for reasons afore mentioned.
-The girl shows no maturation, and the lesson she learns from her experience is this: ""People and wild animals cannot be friends"". Like you had to almost die before figuring that out.

I mistakenly assumed that, like most DVDs, it would come in it's original language, with English subtitles and audio as an option, and maybe some other languages, since it is being sold in an English speaking country, but to my dissatisfaction, I am a) unable to watch this movie in my mother tongue, and b) unable to purchase and watch this movie in it's original form due to DVD zones in different countries.

3782063,5,B001RXDM36,"I bought this film on a whim and having read quite a lot of the comments here I feel I have to add my tuppence-worth.

First of all, like everyone else I think the photography is beautiful and the observation of animal behaviour is fascinating. Until the last ten minutes or so the film depicts the growing relationship between fox and girl in a gentle, heart-warming way, but then at the end it takes a more tragic turn. The story is ultimately a moral about not trying to domesticate what is meant to be wild.

Unlike a lot of reviewers here, I don't see a conflicting message in the film. The girl learned that love is about giving and not taking. This what the last line of the film means when Winslet says ""Foxes know how to love"". The girl overstepped the boundary of love into wanting to possess the fox and have it do what she wanted. She wanted it to behave like a dog instead of a fox and be a pet instead of a wild friend. In the end she has to accept the truth and show her love for the fox by watching it run off back to its own life and throwing away the scarf/leash.

Some reviewers have commented about it spoiling their love of the beauty of nature, but I think this film is realistic in showing that the beauty of nature goes hand in hand with the wildness. A soppy version of this story where everything turned out sweet would have involved overturning the rules of nature and being hypocritical instead of truthful. In fact, if there was any lack of truth it was in not showing the nastier side of foxes. (But then, the nastier, blood-lustier side of foxes really is too gruesome for a children's film).

Also I am surprised by the number of people who seem concerned about the portrayal of the girl's freedom. As the film-maker himself has said, he is depicting the kind of freedom he had as a child, and which many children experienced in times past. It seems sad that today's children are perceived as weak and constantly endangered instead of strong and able to act on their curiosity about the world. Some of the best children's books, like The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn and Swallows and Amazons depict this kind of free, adventuresome existence and this film is following in that tradition. I'm not advocating that children go about tackling wolves on their own, but surely the freedom of the child in this film is something to be celebrated rather than denegrated. The whole story has heightened elements of the fairytale about it (especially the fantastical night sequence when she is in the forest) so I think it would be a mistake to take it too literally. It is an idealised freedom.

I thought this was a rather beautiful film. My only concern was the very real-looking distress of the fox in the scene in the girl's bedroom, and when she ties her scarf round its neck as a collar. I'm not sure foxes are THAT good at acting. I looked up some articles on the net about the film but couldn't find anything about how that scene in the house was filmed.",1358380800,25,2987,4.443430656934306

3782066,3,B001RXDM36,"The movie should be rated PG because of the final 10 minutes. The girl makes a bad judgment call, traps the fox in her room, and the scene ends with the fox's lifeless, bloodied body on the ground after it jumped through a closed window. After an hour of feel good movie, the ending was rather harsh, especially for young children. I certainly didn't expect to see something that gruesome in a G rated movie. While there is nothing wrong with reminding children (and adults) that keeping wildlife as pets is not a good idea, I wouldn't have picked this movie for family night if I had known how it ends.",1351987200,2,603,4.441441441441442
3782067,1,B001RXDM36,"If this film has a good feature, it is probably the landscape photography. But it ends there. Along with a disjointed storyline that frequently leaves the viewer hanging (how did the girl get out of the cave?), the film is nothing more than a series of episodes strung together in the editing room. It is so clumsily put together, it wouldn't pass muster as a student's first year film project. If there is a story, it is this: A child becomes fixated on a fox that keeps trying to evade it. The child's obsessive curiosity at times borders on stalking and the claimed ""friendship"" between the girl and the fox is never adequately proven.

Genuine nature films, or films that use real animals, are notoriously difficult to film. And the abrupt-style photography in this film demonstrates, without any doubt, that the interactions between fox and child (and several other animal scenes) were created in the cutting room. The dubbed dialogue is pedestrian and Kate Winslet's narration neither helps nor hinders--it's just there. Even the ""trapped fox"" event seemed like a desperate ploy by the filmmaker to inject some badly needed drama into this surprisingly stodgy film. The girl's bizarre decision to trap the fox in her room--and cause the panicked animal to get almost killed by crashing through a window--very much contradicts the idea there is a friendship between them at all. By movie's end, the girl demonstrates no maturation, no learning curve, and yet she suddenly parrots the script writer's words that ""foxes and people cannot be friends."" This gratuitously injected dialogue, of course, completely undermines the film's heavily advertised premise that they can be.

I am totally baffled by the largely positive professional reviews of this film. I read these AFTER, not before seeing this film, and I'm at a loss at the saccharine adjectives of praise in many of them. I watched this wretched movie with guests, who, like I, were hoping the movie would turn around and show some of the ""magic"" promised on the DVD jacket.

Sadly, this movie now tops my list of worst films ever. Do not be suckered into supporting Luc Jaquet's horrendous mishmash by spending good money on it.",1348358400,4,2191,4.948369565217392

She then drops the near dead fox off at his den and walks away as if it were a throw away toy. I was disgusted by the film.",1328832000,14,495,4.11340206185567

I could smell the forest and flowers; the mists and the rain. And the eyes - the eyes of the child and the eyes of the fox were windows into the soul of each. Rarely have I seen a more tender love story.

The story was good.  The questionable part [spoiler alert] with the fox jumping out the window was not that gruesome, i am sure my KG could have handled it well enough had she not already fallen asleep.

My 4th grader was a little more skeptical, flat out disbelieving the fox had lived through it, as well as calling the girl ""dumb"" for bringing the fox into her room, and at the end wondered what the point of the movie was.  (Probably his age talking there, though I struggled to come up with a good answer)

For those saying it is too ""bloody"" or whatever for young children, I cannot disagree more.  yes, there was an injury, yes there was blood, however, I can't even count how many parents are slaughtered in Disney movies.  Just because there is no blood doesn't mean it's easier for a young child to process.  This is not a cartoon, it is life.  (And frankly I've seen worse in the Lion King---there is just no loud music and drama to distract the kids from the killing).

The only thing that irritated the hell out of me, and this is 100% my own fault, but I am hoping someone will reply here and tell me how to prevent this in the future, is that once put into full screen, the darn screen kept minimizing every 5 minutes, so I or my kids had to keep popping up to maximize the screen again.

Unquestionably the photography is 5 stars, and the story telling is fine but I don't expect a G rated film to have such a bloody scene for a major character (the fox). I watched this with my 4yr old and I definitely was not prepared for such a dark ending (although at the very end the fox does appear to be recovered -but at that point recovery seemed a bit implausible and I wondered if the movie maker had tacked it on). The girl gets the fox in her room and in a panic it crashes through the (apparently very weak) window into a bloody heap on the driveway below. The ending also seemed to undo much of the message of the rest of the movie. They had been ""friends"" but now the narrator says humans and foxes ""could never be friends"" -so was all the joy and wonder earlier in the movie an illusion? And why does she say ""foxes understand love"" ? In what way? The messages for a child were very mixed. All her involvement with nature was great -but then maybe it was all wrong. People hunt foxes (bad), wolves go after foxes (and child) -exciting adventure.
  Also while the fox is clearly not safe in her world she apparently was safe in his (10 yr olds alone in the woods can escape bears and wolves and never really get lost). I don't mind those things working in a movie but then why not let the whole fox friendship thing work? It is the picking and choosing where to be realistic and where to be fantastic that ultimately didn't leave me wanting to watch the film again -at least not all the way through.

The little girl (whose parents are mysteriously absent) gains the fox's trust, and so she puts a scarf around the fox's neck and ties a rope to it like one would to a dog. The fox chews off the rope, but the scarf remains on it's neck and it runs away. Next we see the girl coax the fox into her house and up to the second floor of her bedroom. She closes the door. The fox panics. It wants out. She won't let it out. It jumps through the window breaking the glass, and lands on cement two floors down, apparently dead because a selfish girl wants to possess him and control him. It is clear the fox is dead. She carries it to it's den where it's offspring live who aren't fully grown yet. Much later she spies the fox, seeing it alive when she thought it dead.

The whole premise that a wild animal would ever be comfortable with a human was too extreme.

Every time the child reached out to try to pet the fox all I could think of was fleas, ticks and rabies.

The ending was, at least, more realistic in that the fox went crazy when locked in a room - she jumped through the window and smashed to the pavement two stories below.  That's what she gets for being friends with a human.

3782103,1,B001RXDM36,"Allow me to describe my experience of watching this film with an analogy. It's like watching someone baking you a cake, using all of the best ingredients, cooking it perfectly, frosting it, decorating it, and then, just before they give it to you... they poop on it. Just a little, tiny poop, but, really, any amount is enough to contaminate the entire cake, rendering it repulsive and inedible.

Let me explain why this is.

When I first saw the title, the cover art, and synopsis on the back of the DVD case, I thought that this movie would be a refreshing change of pace, something enjoyable and beautiful. Foxes are among my favorite animals, and I have always loved watching movies that showcase the beauty of nature. Plus, I thought that the vicarious experience of befriending and playing with a wild fox would be fun.

And I was right. The cinematography is gorgeous, the fox is beautiful and a joy to see, the mountains and forests are some of the most breathtaking shots of nature I have ever seen, and watching the girl befriending the fox was a lot of fun. Halfway through the movie, I had already decided that this was going to rank among my favorite movies of all time.

HOWEVER! Without revealing anything specifically, something happens in the last ten or so minutes that completely destroys all feelings of well-being that the previous hour or so had instilled in me. (This may be a small spoiler, but I'll put it this way: this film in NOT another Yearling or Old Yeller) The last sequence of the film and the ultimate message of the movie came like a slap in the face. The entire time, I had been loving being with the fox in all of that beautiful nature, and then this movie has the nerve to basically say at the end, ""You might have had fun doing all of that, but it was bad. Shame on you. Never do it again. Leave nature alone."" Considering that the fox in this film was most certainly a tame, trained fox, this has to be one of the most hypocritical things I've ever seen.

This movie is terrible, leading you into a world of the magic and beauty of nature, giving you one of the most wonderful movie-watching experiences ever, and then punishing you for it. It tricks you into having fun so that it can make you feel bad for it. Those last ten or so minutes poison the whole film. What would have been a five-star movie becomes a one-star movie because of this betrayal on the part of the moviemakers.

3782106,5,B001RXDM36,"I am a 64 year old woman and occasionally find a movie made for children enjoyable to watch.  However, this movie, ""The Fox and the Child"" was even more than that.  It held my attention the entire time.  The patience or determination this child had in making friends with this fox was extraordinary.  And the way she would wander off with the fox to follow him and be with him once they were friends.  There are some scenes that would probably be a little scary for the very young children......but it was a wonderful movie and the scenery was beautiful.  It was not your typical Disney movie, though I find a lot of them good as well.  I love movies about animals.  The movie is mostly narrated, but there are some scenes where the actors are talking.............but not the animals of course.  :)
I think most adults would enjoy watching this movie as much as their children.",1250985600,2,877,4.535031847133758
3782107,5,B001RXDM36,"Recently I watched the ""Fox and the Child"" with the sound turned off as not to be distracted by the voice over. The film was a new experience.  I have not experienced technical aspects of this quality in a film since Terrace Malick's ""Days of Heaven;"" especially the glorious cinematography of Nestor Almendroes.

The ""fox"" re,minded me of the great work of Carroll Ballard and Caleb Deschanel (""the Black Stallion"")and the gift Steven Spielberg has for working with children. ""E.T. & Empire of the Sun.""

I wonder what Gene Siskel and Pauline Kael would have thought of the film.  Where are some of the finest critics today- Roger Ebert, Jeffery Lyons, Manohla Dargis, Chris Hewitt, and Peter Travers?  They should comment on the ""Fox and the Child"".

Why wasn't the ""Fox and the Child"" released for the big screen in the USA?",1250553600,2,827,4.788732394366197
3782108,5,B001RXDM36,"Being almost 47 years old now, I can't remember the last time I watched a G-Rated movie that I enjoyed.

THE FOX AND THE CHILD was a movie that I related to probably because of where my wife and I are in life.
I call it coming ""full circle"".

As a youth I grew up in a small to mid-sized town in Virginia.
Whenever possible both as a kid and even as I grew up in High School or College I preferred to head out to the Mountains and Forest and spend time alone with nature as opposed to staying in the city and going to malls, nightclubs or parties.

Some of my fondest memories are hiking to the top of waterfalls where I knew probably no other people were around for 6 miles and sit on a rock in the sun reading books or just watching black bear, deer and other animals.

Like the child in this film, I remember 2 years that I kept running into the same few animals each Spring when I returned to the mountains.

Until recently I had forgotten these old memories.............  WHY ???

25 years ago I moved to South Florida.  I was a young man and I guess looking for a bit more excitement and job opportunities.
Now I will confess, 25 years ago I thought South Florida was a tropical paradise and I would probably live there my whole life.

I got into SCUBA diving, boating, beaches, the pool in the backyard , and the warm winters that make you forget Winter even exists.  It's been great !

But fast forward to today ..........

Over the past year or two my wife and I agree something FEELS different.
South Florida today does not feel like the same place we moved to 25 years ago.

Yes, we all know nothing stays the same and everyplace changes ......... but the way this place has changed is Exponential.

From population growth, demographic shift, traffic, urbanization, orange groves & farms eliminated and replaced with housing developments and over 240 new people PER DAY moving into the area, .................... We Came To A Sad Conclusion ....

Our South Florida Is Gone !

As a result, we recently purchased 120 acres of land in the Mountains up North only 60-70 miles from where we both grew up.

It seems like coming full circle in life.

I realize now the things we enjoy best are quiet seclusion and isolation out in nature and NOT the urbanized and mechanized world of zero lot lines, rude neighbors, light polluted night skies and a constant drone of ambient city noise.

Now I know my personal story is of little interest to 99.9999% of you, but I told it only because it relates to the review of this movie.

When watching this movie I started to think of how MOST kids grow up today .... Surrounded by tightly packed neighborhoods, I-PODS, Satellite TV and almost NO IDEA what nature is really like outside of TV shoes and the local park.

Heck when we were kids, we ran around all day long on ""Tom Sawyer - like"" adventures and our parents did not know (or worry) what we were doing as long as we made it home by 6:30 for Supper.
Now parents fear letting kids out of the yard for fear of pedophiles and other modern day social problems.

Technological advances sure are great and wonderful --  but it does not always seem our Social, Moral and Ethical aspects of life keep progressing at an equal pace.

So I watch this movie and wonder how few young people will ever understand this connection to nature in a world where the population seems to double every 10 years, it becomes harder and harder to escape Urbanization and people are forced to live on top of each other in tighter and tighter living arrangements.

I can imagine a person born and raised in New York City who grew up to work on Wall Street, and with no life experiences outside the City seeing THE FOX AND THE CHILD and thinking it silly and childish.

For somebody like me that has had the opportunity to live in both worlds, I found myself envious of the little girl in the film as it made me recall my earlier days.

It also motivates me to work harder and faster to build a home on our recently acquired land so that I may be able to recapture some of that connection with nature I lost 23 years ago when I moved to the bigger, faster city way of life.

I call it ""coming full circle"" and I hope I will be able to spend much of my last 20-30 years on Earth much like the story of nature depicted in this simple, well filmed, children's movie.

A final note on the movie .... The ending (which I will not ruin with spoilers) teaches a lesson to younger children without being too dark and shocking.

There is also a deeper symbolic meeting in the movie for adults.",1250380800,4,4559,4.341981132075472
3782109,5,B001RXDM36,"A handful of other reviewers have already touched on all of the fine attributes of this unique film. I will add, as someone who lives & spends most of my time in a very natural setting, that these types of encounters & relationships, between man & other species, are quite common. It's all about boundaries, respect & putting in the time to observe & associate; and this tale drives home these very points in such a magical - if not fanciful - way.

This is a beautifully filmed & executed story. If you liked ""The Bear,"" and/or ""Bambi,"" you will be in good company with ""The Fox & the Child."" Highly recommended!",1249948800,4,613,4.473214285714286

8339200,5,B001RXDM36,"This movie is THE BEST hands down.  Hard to fault anything in it, unless you want to nit pick that the child starts a fire for warmth?  and that teaches a young child watching that it is safe for them to start a fire.  The only other spot that was so minor as to not be worth mentioning but I will for the sake of perfection, the narrator compares the mating calls and sounds of the foxes as to do justice to witches screaming.  It was only a comment in passing.  But it could have been compared to maybe mating cats?  They scream like that.  Anyways, I would heartily recommend this movie to any family especially as the moral of the story is that love does not equal possession and that when one wants to control either an animal or a person, that is not love.

8339207,5,B001RXDM36,"We watched this movie on a whim, as it came up on our recommended list and we had not heard of this movie.  We enjoyed most of the movie, including the ending, which includes a lesson for us all.

A proviso:

This movie may be quite alien to urban Americans, but many of the events shown in the movie are based on reality.  Some portions of the movie can be traumatic to overly-protected city or suburban children, because the movie treats death much as humans, and other animals, have always treated death: matter-of-factly.  The movie does not glorify death, but neither does it shy from depicting death.  Indeed, portions of the movie can be downright scary because many of the animals depicted are predators (which includes humans), and at least some of the predators are known to kill humans.  Whether this movie comes across as frightening or traumatic vs. intriguing and somewhat whimsical will depend on your perspective and knowledge of wildlife.

Getting past the proviso, the English version of this movie is narrated by Kate Winslet, who is nominally the little girl as an adult.  Other than Winslet, the two true stars in this movie are Bertille Nol-Bruneau as the girl, and the fox as the Fox, which the girl calls Lily.  The movie is usually focused on the girl as she wanders through incredibly wild woods that include wolves, bears, lynx, otters, badgers, and many others, but the fox also sometimes takes center stage.  There are scary moments as the girl encounters most of these animals, several of which have killed children, and when the fox encounters some of these animals, because some of these animals are also known to kill foxes.

The girl is not supposed to be going many of the places she goes, but my grandparents' farm had many wooded acres, which likely included animals such as coyote, bobcat, poisonous snakes, and possibly bears.  I often heard, but not saw, the animals that made the noises I heard in the dense woods.  Yet, as did she, I survived, and to this day I have fond memories of the woods.  Even so, the woods can be dangerous, and the girl is moments from death several times.  When she jumps a canyon filled with a fast-flowing river, I kept thinking that she should not jump.  Would I have jumped?  Probably, because we rarely think of the danger of death when we are young.  Then there was her encounter with the bear, and another encounter with wolves.

The girl slowly becomes friends with the very wild fox.  The fox is always distrusting, but the fox makes the mistake of trusting the girl just a little too much, and the girl ultimately makes the mistake, in her innocence, of thinking that the fox understands her better than the fox could ever understand her.  In the end, the tragedy of their friendship is that the girl tried to treat the fox as she would a tamed animal, such as a dog.  Still, there are huge lessons for any child who is routinely exposed to the outdoors.  Always respect nature, but avoid trying to bring nature into your environment, because our tame, domesticated environment is completely unfamiliar to animals of the wild.  Also, be on guard every moment around predators, because their natural instincts are to hunt and eat.

As much as I liked this movie for the beautiful waterfalls, the healthy and living forest, and the many animals, this movie is likely not a movie for very young children.  Indeed, urban children below the age of 8 or 9 may find things such as the graphic depiction of the poisoning of a fox too graphic.  What happens at the end of the movie can be traumatic for some children too.

Even so, what the movie shows happens in real life.  Nature films about lions often depict a lion with its head in the bowels of a kill, the lion's fur matted with blood.  We evolved in this natural environment, and perhaps the true tragedies are not those depicted in the film, but that children are too protected from understanding nature because as parents we prefer the idyllic beauty of ""Bambi"" over the way that nature truly is.

We liked this movie because the friendship between the fox and the girl was fantastic, and almost whimsical.  But, this movie could really only end in one way.  The beauty of that ending is that the girl learned that nature, the wild, cannot live in her world.  Further, nature has, and NEEDS, its own place, its own environment.  Five stars for showing so much about nature and how a child interacted with nature and learned from that interaction.

Enjoy!",1499990400,,4485,4.6603053435114505
8339208,5,B001RXDM36,"Luc Jaquet has made a beautifully shot narrative film. He seems to share a fox's sense of the subtle dialect of the wild. The wind, rain, scents of the forest are as much characters of this story as the child or the fox. And this story is about the dividing line between the wild and the human. Perfect film for the kids.",1498435200,,321,4.193548387096774
