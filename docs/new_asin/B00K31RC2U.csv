6401886,1,B00K31RC2U,"Some great original WW1 footage, but very little about aircraft. The early section of the dvd set focusses solely on the Wright brothers - interesting but not WW1. Also there is continual repetition of footage. In total I would think there is 10 minutes of WW1 aircraft footage. The DVD's focus on the numerous WW1 battles, the generals and their various strategies, however, there are huge time spans before even the briefest mention of aircraft. Very disappointing.",1438646400,2,467,5.077922077922078
6401887,5,B00K31RC2U,"Worthwhile. Some inaccuracies, but minor. This DVD is not war over the trenches, more a review of flight in WW1. The first hand accounts are interesting. Reasonably priced. I reccomed this DVD.",1434240000,3,193,5.0625
6401888,1,B00K31RC2U,"This item is mislabeled.  Several sections have something to do with aircraft, but few are related to the war.  The first disk covers balloons in use before the war and also the Wright Brothers and the first military aircraft.  THe second disk cover some aspects of the ground campaign (mostly British) and a section or two on aircraft in the war. The narration is nothing special, including a historian who is not a great speaker and rambles a lot. Another, apparently an enthusiast or buff his little of interest to add. There should have been some editing and a script for them to read with some pertinent facts and less ""aahs"" and gee wiz type information that would impress  a grade school student.. There are interviews with one of the Wright brother's mechanics, Douglas, and some veterans (it seems mostly soldiers, not airmen).  Some of the film clips are interesting, but if you miss them the first, second, or third time they appear, they will probably show up again on the disc.  There are about ten minutes or less of actual film clips that are repeated over and over again. Some of the simple commentary might be good to use with a class of high school or junior high students, but that is about it.  I think it is divided into several sections.  The person that gave this a good review refers to it as being part of another set you can click on. That set appears to be something different than this. If it is, it can not be as bad as this. The art work on the cover is probably the best part of the item. You have been warned.",1425168000,13,1541,4.439716312056738

3 STARS FOR THE NARRATION
2 STARS - OR LESS - FOR THE GUEST COMMENTARY
1 STAR FOR SOMEWHAT INACCURATE TITLE AND WANDERING FOCUS

This documentary will frustrate those looking only for coverage of WWI air developments and air combat.  It spends enormous amounts of time covering ground war and misses some key events and motivations that lead to major air advancements.  The general narration by Denton Randall is good and very scripted.  However, it can run a little dry at times.  The two guest commentators are another story.  Their contribution is less frequent until the last episode, but add little value.  Dr. Janet Bendnarek is informative in the most basic sense, but not that interesting of a personality and not well scripted.  Dr. Edward Coffman barely has any script and tries to relay anecdotal instances where ""he talked to a guy who talked to so and so"" and he can't even name the source.  He makes a poor on-screen presence and even seems a little ambivalent about his participation.  However, there is a huge amount of amazing footage with some colorization and even cleaning.  Yes, a lot of that footage is of ground forces or events leading up to WWI.  There is also air footage, colorized in some instances, and Zeppelin combat.  99.9% of this is all authentic (Not old war movie clips).  More on footage below.

GENERAL CONTENT BY EPISODE:

EPISODE I (DISC 1): Brief mention of balloon use in the Civil War and a history.  Overview of the Wright brothers attempts to gain government contracts and testing of first planes at FT. Myers.  Early pilots trained by Wright Brothers.  First pilots believed to fly above ground combat (Mexico 1911).  First pilots to conduct air combat dropping grenades (Italy-Turkey conflict).  Dirigibles. Fokker and Sikorsky contributions.

EPISODE 2 (DISC 1): Almost entirely about the ground events leading to the war.  The Schlieffen Plan.  Marne Campaign and Moltke's failures.  Stalemate of trench warfare.  Brief mention at the episode end of air observation and photography to finally drag the documentary onto the topic the title suggests.

EPISODE 3 (DISC 2):  Mounting guns, Fokker advancements and propeller synch.  Mention of aces and a few very old interviews with actual pilots.  WWI pilot suggests that former cavalry horsemen made the best pilots due to ability to feel what's going on with the aircraft.  Talks about famous pilots and aces again such as Guynemer, Boelcke, Richthoven, McCudden and Mannock.  Brief section on use of air with sea power WWI.

EPISODE 4 (DISC 2): Back to ground war context for a bit and use of gas.  Turns to balloons and Zeppelins.  1915 bombing raids with Zeppelins with incredible footage (only a few seconds of possible movie footage spliced in).  Transitions to plane bombing raids made possible by better high altitude gear and improvements in planes. Flashes back to discuss American isolationist attitudes.  WWI propaganda. 1915 sinking of Lusitania and 1916 Sussex, other events leading to American entry into the war.

EPISODE 5 (DISC 2): More on American entry into the war.  Aircraft advancements in general.  Volunteer pilots from the US prior to the war including the Lafayette Escadrille.  Escadrille absorption into US forces as America enters.  Discussion of first black fighter pilot Eugene Bollard (Black Swallow of Death) a U.S. citizen who served with the Escadrille but was not allowed entrance into the U.S. forces during WWI.  A few seconds of movie footage here unless they actually took pictures after the lynching of Eugene's father when he was just a boy.  Still very old footage.  Discusses American pilots like Billy Mitchel, Frank Luke.  As I mentioned, the appearance of the two commentators is much heavier in this final episode and that's not a plus. Again, they should not be confused with the narrator who is well scripted, if a little dry.

This documentary spends at least as much time covering strictly ground war if not significantly more.  Normally for that disappointment and the two poor historical commentators, I would rate this 1 star.  However, the huge amounts of historical footage and the passable narration do leave this documentary with value depending on your interests.  Regarding use of old war movie footage:  There were just a few seconds here and there showing what looked like real 1970's footage of surviving planes in the air or reproductions, a one minute clip at the very end of episode 5 showing a distressed soldier wandering (WWI era silent film dramatization).  I think I caught a couple seconds spliced into the dirigible raids that was otherwise amazing.  That's it.  The historical footage also has almost NO REPETITION within the episodes though you may see it in other documentaries.  The historical overviews are light, so serious air historians won't gain much other than the visuals mentioned.  There are glaring holes in the story such as the Battle of the Somme and how it affected integration of air power in WWI.  To me that was a pretty big omission and a sure sign this was not a serious WWI Air Combat documentary.  Each viewer will have to take these descriptions and decide if it fits into your personal interests.

If you have interest in this show for the positive aspects I mentioned, it is included in the following set with two other documentaries which also fall somewhere middle of the road in terms of quality:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WWI-100th-Anniversary-Collection/dp/B00K31RCM0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WWI - 100th Anniversary Collection</a>&nbsp;.  I have seen it for just over $10 so you at least get more for your money and an economical alternative.

8655571,2,B00K31RC2U,"Practically nothing significant about Aviation in World War I. A lot about the development of flight and the Wright Brothers, then the focus turns to the history of the causes and battles of World War I.  The 'expert' speakers don not seem to be scripted in any way. They seem to have been place in front of a camera and asked to speak about a topic. The discussions were at best sophomoric. Dr. Bednarek's remarks were particularly filled with so many ums and ahs that I began to just fast forward through them. The footage did not use as many out of period shots as some of these programs, which seem to think any biplane is a WW1 aircraft.  Although there was the repeated use of a couple 1930s biplanes doing a wing over. and of course shots of 1918 aircraft during a discussion of 1916 issues.
All in all a video to avoid.",1463616000,2,827,4.363636363636363

8655573,1,B00K31RC2U,"Do not waste your money on this DVD. It has very little to do with warbirds, mostly to do with trenches. This DVD is a summary of the causes and warplans of WWI and only mentions aircraft and tactics when it comes along in the timeline, The most appalling part of this DVD is when you have to endure the endless monologue from two or three professors who drone on and on endlessly without visual overview or images of what they are talking about. Its just a screenshot of them talking and you find yourself wondering out loud when will it end? Most of the historical footage has nothing to do with aviation so its just false advertising on the cover. Poorly put together and absolutely terrible monologues like sitting an a college classroom listening to a lecture. A real disappointment. If you want a DVD on aviation or WWI aviation, look elsewhere.",1441670400,2,851,4.568627450980392
