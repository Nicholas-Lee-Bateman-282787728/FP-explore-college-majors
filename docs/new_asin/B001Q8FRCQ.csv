8335153,5,B001Q8FRCQ,"Recently I purchased a new Canon Digital SLR, the 50D, and with more options that I could imagine, and yet, knowing I wanted to improve my skills, I searched out a book or video course.  I came upon Michael the Mentor's website with many camera's DVD's, like the Canon 50D, 40D, Rebel XSi, or Crash Digital Photography Course.  He also has photoshop, and skycam DVD's too.  And he does workshops around the globe.  What I liked when I started up the video, was first it was well organized so I could skip to a feature I wanted a refresher on, or more assistance, and the excellent quality of the video, and it's close up, so easy to see and follow.  His voice was a bit low, but I just cranked up my iMac's volume,and it was fine.  He has a good voice, and easy to hear and understand. I see he's a wedding photographer, so he must have great patience.  I found his Blog interesting, helpful, and useful,
[...] and I see he also has a Video Podcast on iTunes for free, search: Michael Andrews Video Podcast of a few lessons too.

I started out with his first chapter, Getting Started, and it was just that,  he's holding the camera up close and starts showing buttons, he uses a big red circle, so I knew what he was talking about.  He gave his suggested Compact Flash card brand preference, I appreciated that.  He does that on all videos in the series, giving the benefit of his experience, so we don't have to wonder if we're making a good choice.  His voice is one of assurance, not intimidation, most welcome from an instructor.  As I went through the chapter, listed below, I grew with skills and assurance.

The 2nd part of the DVD is his Photography School with 16 + chapters.  He teaches Photography fundamentals, artistic fundamentals as well as how to use the Canon 50D on this video.  I really liked having both, photography and the camera on one DVD from one instructor.  He also has a forum where students can learn from each other.[...]

I had taken a photography class this past Fall, and found it was too fast for me to absorb it all,  but since with Michael's DVD, I can play it again and again, and that he's showing what he's talking about, it worked great.
