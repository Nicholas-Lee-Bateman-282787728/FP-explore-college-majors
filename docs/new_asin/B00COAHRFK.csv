8583928,4,B00COAHRFK,"Simply recorded 30 minute interval step mill workout with a bonus video. Judi Brown is enthusiastic and obviously fit. In this video, she's more an encouraging cheer leader type than drill sergeant and makes it fun to follow along. To increase the difficulty of the workout, one can raise the warm-up, aerobic or peak levels. For example going from levels 1,3,5 as she's doing on the step mill, to levels 2,4,6 is a notable increase in effort. She encourages viewers to increase the levels as one gets more fit, but still keeping the timing and duration of the routine. She explains how the stepmill improves fitness with a bit of exaggeration of movement, shifting balance as she climbs. Explains some of the benefits of interval training. Also somewhat humorously exaggerates her effort expended on the intervals. I'd have liked additional workouts on this DVD or perhaps different routines on other DVDs. I used this with a StairMaster stepper and was happy to find any stepmill/stepper workout video.",1417305600,,1004,5.017964071856287
8583929,5,B00COAHRFK,"Wow, what a great idea. As someone who finds the treadmill
boring, this has been really effective. I watch this as i walk
and the time flies by!

I've even turned my other gym friends on to this program,
and they love it too!",1400112000,,225,4.113636363636363
