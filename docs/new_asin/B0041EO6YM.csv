8412688,4,B0041EO6YM,"The part of me that likes seeing PH show explicit footage, while trying to retain the overall style and avoid becoming the garish, vapid, monotonous porn they churn out lately, is pleased that this is one of the more explicit PH videos I own.  However to an extent it still looks like someone else produced this as an actual porn and then Penthouse just released it under their name after they edited it heavily first.  Many of the stars of this are not PH Pets, rather names that we know from purely adult cinema (e.g. Avy Scott).  And they shot a series of ""host"" girl footage to wrap up the individual scenes, but she never quite gets fully nude and of course plays around without actually showing any explicit nudity let alone any pink.

The girl-girl scenes lack the lingering sensual play between the thighs... we get very brief cuts jumping around, yet for them to have enough to fill the 50 minutes, some of it is very explicit.  But no actual pink, and even the full frontal shots are minimal to make up for how graphic some other shots are.  One scene clearly shows full contact oral (though not close-up and it is brief), one scene shows a toy being used to full effect (but only from a side angle that doesn't show point-of-insertion).  So, it's like some of the cable version porn I've seen where they really push the boundaries of what they can show, but there's no explicit lingering nudity and pink that they'd be doing in a true PH video.  There is one PH Pet here that I've seen do wonderful things in the 2004 Pet Play-off, but her scene is so heavily edited that we barely see anything (there's one extremely brief clip where some finger insertion is caught in passing by the panning camera).

Of course we get a lot of the usual problems with PH video, like the silly close-up shots of the shower head with water coming out (or other inane attention to details while ignoring the ladies), or the time spent slo-mo lingering on the faces while flitting around with the other areas, or the ridiculous lack of continuity that aims to ""tease"" but really just becomes annoying because it doesn't build and peak... it flashes and then fizzles and leaves you frustrated (like bits of clothing appearing on then off then back on again).

I always wondered about those ""half-breed"" PH videos that they release but don't actually produce, well now I see what the reviewers were talking about.  Why is it so hard for them to keep a consistent standard of production?  Back when these were originally released I couldn't afford the risk of buying them just to see if they were any good.  If they hadn't been so hit-or-miss, I would have bought more of them back then and maybe others would have too.  Can't they just keep the videos at the same standard as the printed magazines, show the same degree of explicit yet seductive and stylish photography?",1427414400,,2860,4.571428571428571
