8641299,3,B00IDQ0A58,"I bought this film when I saw that it was from the same guy that did ""Stacy"" which I enjoyed.  As for the movie plot, it made me think that they took Takashi Miike's ""Ichi the Killer"" and made him smoke some crack and then had him write a softcore flick...  The film is very surreal and blends reality and fantasy throughout and can get a little confusing at times.  The synopsis about film above is correct in that there is nothing comical in this film like in ""Stacy"", but I still found it an entertaining film. Contains Nudity, Language, Rape, and Violence. Film's total run time was only 60 min.

Now as far as this DVD release goes:  First off, this is a DVD-R burn on demand disc, even though it has the look of being professionally done as opposed to a bootleg from out of a car trunk, there are some issues that I had with it.  The movie appears to be shot on video, and despite some scenes where you can tell that the lighting is muted, overall the transfer quality is somewhat lacking, tends to get blurry when there is alot of movement on screne when watched on an HDTV.  Also there is no DVD menu at all, it just started playing when I put it in.  Then there is the fact that it is in Japanese with English subtitles, which normally I don't mind; however, in this case the subtitles should have been done better.  They will pop up way early before the person starts to talk and just kind of hang out for a while, or they will flash on and off so quickly that I had to rewind the film and pause it just to read what the subtitle was saying.  No special features on disc that I could find.

So in summary, I liked the film, but I found the actual DVD to be very lacking, but then again this is the only copy of this film I have found in a Region 1 so I guess having a so-so copy of the film is better than not being able to see it at all.",1395014400,,1848,4.0633608815427
