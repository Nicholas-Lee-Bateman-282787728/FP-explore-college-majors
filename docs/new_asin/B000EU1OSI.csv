8383695,5,B000EU1OSI,good dvd kind of out of date but it shows the basics for those that just don't know about recording. these days we use different modules and equip and workstations so thats not on here but for the basics it can help you understand easily what you need to know. i bought 2 and use them for reference on how to add older instruments and re doing my master keyboard if any more questions of product review email me at @ mommysellsstuff@yahoo.com,1376524800,,442,4.402439024390244
