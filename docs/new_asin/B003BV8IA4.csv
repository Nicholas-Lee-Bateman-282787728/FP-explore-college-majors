4107500,1,B003BV8IA4,Ridiculous movie with terrible acting. Not even worth a penny!!,1426982400,,63,5.4
4107501,1,B003BV8IA4,Just NO! Watch the trailer on YT. Wow horrible,1426377600,,46,4.222222222222222
4107502,1,B003BV8IA4,"Terrible acting, terrible plot, terrible writing. It's a drama with too much blood and guts. So bad we watched it and laughed all the way through",1425340800,,145,4.615384615384615
4107503,3,B003BV8IA4,This movie wasn't too bad. I really enjoyed the plot and the way the story was going it was just underfunded is all but that's not bad. The writer had a great unique story that really made for an interesting film.,1411516800,,213,4.219512195121951
4107504,5,B003BV8IA4,Great Movie!,1409011200,,12,5.5
4107505,5,B003BV8IA4,"all I can say is anything with corey feldman gets 5 stars from me..I haven't watched it yet,but I'm sure it is a good movie..",1362268800,,125,4.04
4107506,4,B003BV8IA4,"This movie has a slightly 'low budget' appeal to it, but all in all I enjoyed it. It was an interesting storyline, I'll give it that. I admit in places the acting or 'suspense' could have been upped. A good buy for any Corey fan or even suspense fan.",1347840000,2,250,4.122448979591836
4107507,1,B003BV8IA4,"Worst movie ever made.  Corey Feldman, please, please please stop making movies.  Nobody wants to see your work.  How can you expect anyone to buy this thing.  My 10 year old nephew could make a better movie with his flip cam.",1306195200,,226,4.439024390243903
4107508,4,B003BV8IA4,"Terror Inside gave me the creeps--and a couple of scenes actually had me hiding my face in a pillow  But some of the other scenes were painfully disturbing to watch, and I still shudder just thinking about them. If you like being scared.. This is for you",1297036800,8,254,4.404255319148936
4107509,4,B003BV8IA4,"I didn't know what to expect when I got this DVD.Another direct to DVD for Feldman like Lost Boys2. I didn't care for Lost Boys2 because Feldman is playing that ""Feldman Character"" he developed in his teens.

Well, that's over, which is an improvment. Although Corey often looks like he's disinterested or hardly working, he gives us insight to some possible acting skill. The movie starts in a small town and progresses to the point of gory bloodiness. Maybe too gory for some or not enough for others, this is not a Hollywood studio picture and it shows. Lacking in slick lighting and flashy effects, it moves along quickly in its 85 minutes.

Newcomer Tanya Memme also is a plus. While some of the actors are clumsy Tanya brings the movie together with sympathy and distress. Suzy Feldman appears topless in one scene so this is not a kids movie.

Worth a look especially for Feldman fans.",1277510400,6,892,4.6687898089171975

4107524,3,B003BV8IA4,"I am a child of the 80's and pretty much will watch anything with the ""Corey's"" in it. With that being said I continued to watch this movie because I just wanted to know what the gross slime was.  No SPOILER from me, but watch at your own discretion.",1463184000,,250,4.1020408163265305

4107532,3,B003BV8IA4,This movie was ok.  Mainly watched because it starred Corey Feldman.,1447027200,,68,5.181818181818182
4107533,1,B003BV8IA4,"One of the main characters said, ""It's like some bad Twilight Zone episode.""
Personally, I wouldn't insult The Twilight Zone like that. If you are making a movie and feel the need to have one of your characters make that statement, reevaluate your movie.

The acting was horrible. The way they moved the plot forward was jerky. It didn't flow forward on its own, it was yanked along like a petulant puppy on a leash. This story didn't want to be told, because it shouldn't have been. A plot knows when it's not worth the time. Professionals are supposed to know when to listen.",1446940800,,577,4.548076923076923
4107534,1,B003BV8IA4,"Amazon should have a selection for zero stars. The only terror in this movie is the bad acting, writing, and directing.  Actually, this should be billed as a comedy, but it can't sustain the laughs for that.  I can't believe that I sat all the way through this crap.  There is nothing in this movie that makes any sense.  Man drills for some type of material that when touched turns pain to pleasure.  Or something like that.  It was funny when the biker chick threw herself in the wood chipper in search of higher pleasure.  Everyone becomes infected. There's some silly solution at the end of the movie, but you just won't care.  If you can make it through Corey Feldman's bad southern accent, I doubt you'll want to go much further.  If you want to see something about being infected from foreign material, there's a great X-Files episode.  Or just see The Blob.  The original, not the remake.",1444867200,,896,4.572327044025157

4107539,1,B003BV8IA4,"Corey, Corey, Corey.  Really the only reason I watched it and the same reason I knew the movie would be pretty bad.  My old heart throb, I was so hoping for more.  I actually thought his acting was pretty ok especially given how terrible everyone elses was .....and I mean bad.  His ex wife was pitiful and I hope she followed other pursuits because acting is clearly not her calling. There were some silly moments that got several chuckles out of me.  It was a low budget and the plot was boring.",1442188800,,497,4.358695652173913

4107544,3,B003BV8IA4,"Mediocre acting (being generous here), flimsy plot. Your average, b-grade horror flick.

I watched the first 23 minutes. Will probably go back & watch the rest some time. Free for Amazon Prime members so no money out of my pocket.

It's a shame the plot doesn't remotely resemble the description. Someone should write & produce a decent flick that matches the description.",1439078400,3,372,4.983870967741935
4107545,1,B003BV8IA4,"....because it seems the standards are pretty low in Hollywood. Sadly, another Amazon Prime movie that earned the click of my remote just a few minutes in. I knew I couldn't suffer through 90 minutes of the dreadful acting, so I can't comment on the story line.

The acting was horrible, the plot only vaguely resembled the synopsis I read about it,, the special effects were very unprofessional and poorly done. I was extremely disappointed. I guess I should have known better than to think a horror movie with Corey Feldman in it could be scary.",1427328000,,342,4.532258064516129
8393969,5,B003BV8IA4,"I was hyped when I first heard about the fact that this movie won prizes at a festival, because the last output that won Corey Feldman some trophies was a great film called ""The Birthday"".
This film shares similarities in the sense that it's a first time director film that wins festivals trophies. Beyond that it's a completely different ballpark.
""The Terror Inside"" felt like a super bizarre direct to DVD movie. It was entertaining but it wasn't close to anything else. It feels like a modern day grindhouse film.
What was good about ""The Terror Inside"" you have actors giving good performances, the movie has a decent pace, and they are good ""Wow moments"" that will jump to your face. Gory stuff, sometime good twists and finally some stuff that is unintentionally funny...",1523836800,,778,4.813432835820896
