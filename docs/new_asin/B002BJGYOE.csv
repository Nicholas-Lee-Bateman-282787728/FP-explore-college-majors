8361557,3,B002BJGYOE,"Dowsing--using a rod to get answers from the earth's energy and water--is explored pretty well in this little documentary, with beautiful scenery and personal testimonial. It also gives you a sense of its history and the kind of people who practice and pursue it.",1252368000,3,263,5.0
8361558,5,B002BJGYOE,"I actually did not even know what dowsing was when I sat down to watch this fascinating hour long film.  The techniques, examples, and facts surrounding this process are interesting and far more detailed than I ever expected.  I was almost thinking of a rain dance type of phenomenon and it was very specific and detailed.  The reverence for it is well deserved.  Good movie to watch for entertainment and historical value.  Lots of educational information.",1250121600,5,457,4.9605263157894735
