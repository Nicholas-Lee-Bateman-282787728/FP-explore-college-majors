For mature adults who have an attention span and who will not mind reading the translation. I would rather purchase "" The Advarsary"" which is even expensive on VHS for nearly a 100.00. This version is really re-arranged to the point that if you did not know the story, you would not recognise what you were watching.

I've watched all three films and rate this one the best of the three.  This film was paced very well and the acting of Adriana Ozores (the wife) was mesmerizing.",1397088000,5,515,4.457446808510638
