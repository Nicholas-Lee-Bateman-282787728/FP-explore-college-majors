8084442,5,B000BBAB5M,I bought this DVD for one purpose and that was relaxation and that's exactly what it delivers. Maybe the first reviewer has a low-end TV because I was not disappointed with the quality. It's nice to just sit there and let the sounds and scenery slowly pull you away to a little piece of paradise. Excellent work.,1175558400,,312,4.491228070175438
8084443,3,B000BBAB5M,"I took this home and put it up on the big screen. I was a little disappointed. While it DOES deliver exactly what it promises as far as 3 unedited sunsets, the quality leaves a little to be desired. Even after color balancing on my system, the sun still has a greenish cast, and because of the auto-iris of whatever camera they used to shoot this, all of the foreground is in silhouette for most of the time. Video cameras will never do an absolutley great job of capturing the sun, I guess, because instead of looking like the round ball of fire we all know and love, it comes out more like a giant asterisk.

  After all, this IS Hawaii, and every sunset there is magnificent, right? Maybe. Maybe they just seem more magnificent after the 14-hour plane ride or paying $300 a night for a hotel. The sunsets shown are pretty in a ""here's what the sun looked like from our hotel room"" sort of way, not the ""Oh, my Lord - we'll never see anything like THAT again, glad the camera was running"" sort of way. Also, the image fades out after the sun gets below the horizon...you don't get to go all the way into night or even halfway through twilight...this was a little weird, but calls for hair-splitting as to what YOUR definition of ""sunset"" is, I guess.

  If relaxation is what you're buying this for, it probably won't let you down. Be aware that one sunset is photographed a fair distance back from the beach and you can't see the waves lapping on the shore. Be also aware that each sunset is followed by about a 1-minute ""time-lapse"" sequence of the same sunset...interesting on first viewing, kinda annoying on repeated viewings or when trying to relax. Maybe I just need a stronger Margarita.

  IN SHORT, don't expect IMAX-level breathtaking quality. If that's what you're after, look elsewhere. If you find it, I'd like to know about it.

The results here are exactly what you'd get if you took your consumer-grade equipment out and shot a sunset. Maybe slightly better, because there are no jet trails in these skies, or interested bystanders in the shots.

  I don't want to come off harsh, but gotta be honest. The sunsets are AVERAGE. You've seen better where YOU live, whether it's NYC or here in Mayberry. You just haven't filmed them and sold them.

Maybe you should.",1172102400,,2281,4.54523227383863
8084444,5,B000BBAB5M,"I've been to Hawaii only once, and daily I fantasize about going back. I was so excited to see that CustomFlix offered a relaxation video with my favorite island of Kauai!

This video is exactly what I needed! The picture and sound is so crystal clear, it was like I was actually relaxing *in* Hawaii.

I don't know what the customer from the ""Bay Area"" was talking about b/c the Amazon ad for this DVD was ON THE MARK.  And I don't know what he was thinking--how long does he think it takes for the sun to set?

If anyone is thinking of buying this DVD--DO It!

(Ignore the negative feedback from ""Bay Area""!)

You will be happy you did! Thanks CustomFlix!!",1136678400,2,658,4.352459016393443
8084445,4,B000BBAB5M,"I got this DVD for christmas and just watched it for the first time. I had the previous title, Sunsets of Hawaii, so I knew what to expect. Let me first say that the last reviewer is off the mark. If you are expecting this to be a travelogue type show then it is definitely not going to interest you. What this is is really just what it claims to be... Sunsets of Kauai. There are no fancy transitions, no big camera angles, just the sun setting and all the natural sounds that come with it. I liken it to being the next best thing to being there. But you don't really ""watch"" this video. It's one of those things you put on in the background when you just want to relax. Looks great on my widescreen DLP too.",1136592000,2,709,4.107913669064748
8084446,5,B000BBAB5M,I bought both Sunsets of Hawaii and Sunsets of Kauai through [...] but had to review it here!  I was really pleased with the Kauai DVD and loved that there were now 3 sunsets to enjoy!  It's so nice to have on in the background when I'm reading a book or surfing the web.  I just hit the loop all and let it run!  Makes you feel like you're right there!,1126656000,2,353,3.9295774647887325
