1393242,4,B0000558LQ,This is a super comedy. I first saw it on TCM and would watch it each chance that I had to. Joe makes a great would-be salesman trying to sell a tractor only no one wants him to. I can't wait for more of his movies to become available to purchase.,1150848000,4,247,3.8627450980392157
1393243,3,B0000558LQ,"Throughout the history of comedy a selected few names remain head and shoulders above the rest. Chaplin, Keaton, W.C. Fields, Bob Hope, Laurel & Hardy, Abbott and Costello and the Marx Brothers but of course there were other very successful comedians and comedy teams during their day that for some reaon or other have managed to fall out of the public's taste. How many of you know Fatty Arbuckle? Charley Chase? Olsen & Johnson? Wheeler & Woolsey? The Ritz Brothers? Larry Semon? and the star of ""Earthworm Tractors"" Joe E. Brown?  Only true film fans and comedy lovers are aware of these people. Their movies are rare and when they are shown on TV are usually played so late at night you're already sleeping. Whole generation will go on without knowing who these people are. What a shame that is.

 Joe E. Brown appeared in several Warner Brother comedies that were at the time quite popular. His persona could be compared to Buster Keaton and Harold Lloyd. Like Lloyd, Brown had an ""every man"" appeal to him. He could have been your next door neighbor. He was an all-American. He loved baseball, cars, had confidence in himself,and of course loved money. He was a dreamer who believed in the American dream, the idea that anyone could make it big just as long as they tried. And like Keaton he proved to be quite athletic. Usually finding himself in situation where he was running towards or from someone. ""Local Boy Makes Good"" is a good example, he joins the track team to impress a girl.

 In ""Earthworm Tractors"" Brown plays Alexander Botts a self-proclaimed ""natural born salesman"" who has been trying to win the hand of Sally Blair (Carol Hughes). But when her father (Olin Howland) finds out that Botts is selling small time gadgets he refuses to let him marry her daughter until he becomes a successful salesman selling important things. With this as his inspiration Botts decides to sell earthworm tractors and vows to return to marry Sally.

 Botts does eventually get a job and is sent to try and sell Sam Johnson (veteran Warner Brothers character actor Guy Kibbee) into buying some tractors for his lumber yard. But before Botts meets Mr. Johnson he runs into her daughter Mabel (June Travis) and its love at first sight. Well at least for him anyway. Now Botts wants to sell the tractors not only to get in good with his boss but to also get in good with Mabel, completely forgetting about his girl back home.

 ""Earthworm Tractors"" is not one of Brown best films. That honor belongs to such titles as ""A Very Honorable Guy"", ""Local Boy Makes Good"" and ""You Said A Mouthful"". But ""Tractors"" does have some enjoyable moments. A scene involving a tractor and Johnson's house had me laughing out loud. Also in the film's defense it is better structured than some of Brown's previous films. Most of Brown movies revolved around gags. They were really set pieces where Brown was placed in one situation after another but the character development and plot structure were weak. An example of this would be ""The Circus Clown"". ""Earthworm Tractors"" at least makes a modest attempt at actually telling a story.

 If you are a Joe E. Brown fan I'd advise you to try and find this movie. And if you've never heard of Brown, I'm really writing this for you. I want you to see his works. It's not right that so many comedian such as Brown are forgotten.

 Since so few of Brown's movies are available on amazon I'd like to take the time and give you my ratings for Brown's other movies. ""Local Boy Makes Good"" (***), ""A Very Honorable Guy"" (***), ""The Circus Clown"" (***), ""You Said A Mouthful"" (***), ""The Tenderfoot"" (**), ""Polo Joe"" (***), ""Broadminded"" (** 1\2), ""Son Of A Sailor"" (**), ""Elmer the Great"" (**) ""Alibi Ike"" (** 1\2) and ""Bright Lights"" (***)

 Bottom-line: Enjoyable but slight comedy that does not rank as one of Brown best movies. It does however have some funny moments and at little over an hour is really just a light diversion. Joe E. Brown fans will enjoy it.",1122768000,,3990,4.663817663817664
1393244,3,B0000558LQ,"My copy of the Earthworm Tractors DVD has an oversaturated, distorted soundtrack. This especially evident in the opening fanfare. I find I must turn down the volume to make the DVD listenable. The video quality of the DVD is no better than a VHS copy I have viewed.",1090540800,3,265,4.541666666666667
1393245,2,B0000558LQ,"Although Warner Brothers studio was famous for many film genres in the 1930s and 1940s, comedy was not one of them.  They didn't have any great comedy actors on their roster, so Joe E. Brown was their comedy ""star"" in a series of B-films.  If you like your comedy played very broadly, you might find him funny.  Personally, I don't see the appeal.  In this film, he stars as a ""natural born salesman"" trying to sell earthworm tractors to lumberyard owner Guy Kibbee, who does not want any new-fangled machinery.  At first, he does so to try and impress his old girlfriend, but in the end he is trying to impress his new girlfriend, Kibbee's daughter June Travis.  There's much slapstick with his misadventures with the tractors, and most of it goes on for far too long.  Director Ray Enright poorly paces the film, letting jokes drag on and on well past the point of being funny.  The acting is weak and obvious, although Travis does display some talent.  Mercifully, the film is short, and there are a couple of moments that made me grin (such as when he is repeatedly tossed out the door), but a couple of moments is hardly enough for a whole film.",1029628800,8,1150,4.516908212560386
1393246,3,B0000558LQ,"I know I'm supposed to write a ""detailed"" description, but this movie can easily be summed up in one word:  CORNY.  The acting was corny, the skits were corny, the premise was corny, the ""special effects"" and action were corny.  Yep, ""corny"" sums it up.",1404691200,,253,4.5777777777777775

We were disappointed with this movie as Joe E Brown played the role of Alexander Potts, the main character, as a complete idiot.  We both like Joe E Brown but this was not a story for his kind of humor, or the director had him play it like that.  Whatever, neither of us liked the movie.",1327190400,,482,4.333333333333333

1393253,4,B0000558LQ,"A 'slapstick' comedy done in the 1930s-40s style. The anctics of a tractor salesman (Alexander Botts), and the method of showing the tractors capabilities are humerous. Considering the time when this movie was made, and none of todays movie technologies (Computer generated images etc.) make it interesting.  The challanges that the movie director had to make were pretty creative.  A simple story line,silly antics, creative photography make this a light hearted movie that may help in reducing your daily ""stress"".....(Joe E.

7930823,3,B0000558LQ,"Lets get the obvious out of the way first.  The quality of the transfer is abysmal and its DVD-R.  As for the plot, its a slapstick romantic comedy involving the luckless Alexander Botts (Joe E. Brown).  Throughout this short film (68 minutes), no one is more impressed with Botts than Botts.  He is a self-avowed natural born salesman.  He tells this to everyone ad nauseam.  More of a peddler than a salesman, he sets out to prove he is a natural born salesman by selling tractors to a man who doesnt want them (Guy Kibbee as Sam Johnson).  As a bonus, Botts romances Johnsons daughter Mabel, even though he is betrothed to Sally back home.  Poor Botts is a hapless idiot who wrecks havoc wherever he goes.  He is a menace on a tractor, all the while claiming to be an expert (hes never driven one and once he gets the hang of it, hes even more destructive).  If you love obvious humor and broad comedy, lots of slapstick and pratfalls, then you might love this old darling from 1936.  However, it was too repetitive for me to enjoy.  Once you get the joke (that hes an incompetent braggart), endlessly proving it seems a bit redundant.  Generally speaking.........yes and no.",1452211200,,1178,4.552380952380952
