8334990,1,B000PGTNCK,"My daughter, 8, bought this movie as a part of a DVD collection called ""Benji's Favorite Dog Tales.""  It had a grandfather dying, a pet dog who catches rabies, an infected cut treated with maggots, a teenage boy arrested, etc... Definitely not for 8 year olds.  And, definitely not ""Benji's favorite"" either.  My daughter says that this was a horrible movie.  To the manufacturer's credit, we have since noticed the PG rating on the back.  But, who would look for a rating on a ""Benji"" movie?",1293840000,4,492,4.674418604651163
