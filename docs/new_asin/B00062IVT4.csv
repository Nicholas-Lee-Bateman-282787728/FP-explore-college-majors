8412506,4,B00062IVT4,"I found this Israeli comedy to actually be laugh aloud funny and incisive about the national and cultural quagmires within Israeli society.  IT has its Hollywood 'Feel Good' aspect as well as a bit of hyperbolic, eye-popping acting, but the film has many wonderful nuggets of truth.  Since I'm going to Israel in about ten days -- I've spent much time there -- it's a zesty appetizer for me.",1257379200,,391,4.6521739130434785
8412507,3,B00062IVT4,"I liked this movie. It is probably very good. I don't speak the language, and I was hoping to follow along with the subtitles. Unfortunately, the subtitles were done very poorly, difficult to see and very, very random. I did my best to follow the story via the acting, and I still liked the movie. I just wish I had understood it better.

8412508,5,B00062IVT4,"""Oscar-winning Israeli director Dror Shaul exposes the rough edges of Israeli society in this biting comedy, in which a sweet grandmother (Tiki Dayan) has the power to put curses on people and grant blessings. She's in high demand, and at every turn there's someone who wants to use her gift for their own needs. Extras include commentary, deleted scenes, premiere and behind-the-scenes footage, the theme song music video, the trailer and TV ads.""

Although the subject of this movie is not meant to provoke any mind blowing revelations, what comedy does?

I highly recommend this movie to those who understand the culture & language and just want to have a good lighthearted laugh.

No mind blowing issues being discussed, no too deep thought provoking intentions...unlike many Israeli movies. Many funny one liners, clever sarcasm & very likeable & engaging characters.",1115164800,5,872,5.214285714285714
