1712529,5,B000066E8F,This DVD is for advanced (Black belt) TaeKwonDo practitioners. The step by step explanation of the forms gives the serious martial artist the tools needed to move to second Dan and higher.  It is a perfect supplement to formal classes and in home practice.  This is a winning DVD for all higher level TaeKwonDo students,1216425600,,319,4.781818181818182
1712530,4,B000066E8F,"The DVD is a great learning aid for anyone wanting to learn these forms. However, I would strongly recommend a book or another graphic form of learning aid to be used in conjunction with this DVD, as the forms are repeated 3 times in total (fast, with explanation and fast from a side view). The exact footwork, chart-type movement of the form etc, are not explicitly shown, so it will be rather difficult learning these forms perfectly using only this DVD without prior knowledge of the forms. But for what the DVD is, it forms a great help in learning these forms. Definately recommended!",1209945600,,590,4.6826923076923075
1712531,5,B000066E8F,I have used the DVD before for my son learning the Poomse from basic to brown belt it helped him greatly.  I would recommend anyone who wants to know the correct version of your Poomse to view this DVD.,1209686400,,202,4.17948717948718
1712532,5,B000066E8F,This DVD is very easy to understand and was very helpful in learning Keumgang for 2nd degree test.,1185494400,,98,4.5
1712533,5,B000066E8F,"The Guide is showing the Poomse from a few views and helps U to understand each move.

Also, it is very easy to move with the guide because of the clean moves that he makes",1171497600,,172,3.914285714285714

7962219,3,B000066E8F,I liked it,1462147200,,10,2.6666666666666665
7962220,2,B000066E8F,Not great compare to other MArtial art videos,1445558400,,45,4.75
7962221,1,B000066E8F,"Man!  These moves seem to be executed with no ""heart and soul""!  No ""fire"" whatsoever!  They look like techniques just ""thrown"" with lazy limbs and NO sense of whole-body integration and no feel of ""fighting application"" or significance!!  Is this really how Tae Kwon Do Poomse are supposed to look?",1442707200,,299,4.92
7962222,5,B000066E8F,"Excellent resource.  He also offers Taugeuk, Palgwe form videos.  Sparring videos are excellent also.",1434499200,,101,6.142857142857143
7962223,5,B000066E8F,Master Kim does a great job of showing the Poomse.  Thank you,1408492800,,61,4.083333333333333
7962224,5,B000066E8F,Great instructional tool. The forms are very well explained. This is a very useful DVD if you are a student of WTF tae kwon do.,1408147200,,127,4.12
7962225,5,B000066E8F,"It is outrageous the price these sellers want for this dvd. I bought one for 29.95 about 4 years ago. Even though Master Kim does not offer this dvd on the 9 black belt forms anymore, these prices are absurd.
Its too bad because this is one of the best DVDs on the WTF black forms being sold. There are others out there by different Masters which are fairly good, so before you go spending this kind of money check them out.",1393286400,,424,4.182926829268292
7962226,5,B000066E8F,"Along with the book ""Complete Tae Kwon Do Poomsae"", will answer any questions you have on a particular form when practicing at home.",1244246400,,132,4.782608695652174
7962227,5,B000066E8F,"I have been so pleased with the quality of this DVD. Very complete in explanation, front & side view for accuracy in learning the positions.
Thank you for this thoughtfully made product.",1241913600,,186,4.84375
