8508917,4,B0072GOIVC,"These classics are between the new trends and the earlier China Dynasty kick'em up action spectacular. Production values take a leap and plots make more sense while the energy's still there. Prints have been resurrected surprisingly smoothly. Not many layer to the character, but what's on top is what martial arts get a kick out of. These double feature DVDs are their own genre,well worth experimenting with.",1386720000,,410,5.134328358208955

8508919,4,B0072GOIVC,"More than a full month ahead of it's projected release date, I purchased ""DRAGON DYNASTY DOUBLE FEATURE 2: GOLDEN SWALLOW & KILLER CLANS"" on March 22, 2012 from Wal-Mart. The price was only $5.00. Excellent price.

I was excited when I shaw scoped this one from the corner of my eye. When the price tag registered in my mind, I was definitely content. This was truly a nice surprise for me because I have yet to see either movie. I am looking forward to watching the sequel to King Hu's masterpiece work ""Come Drink With Me"" in ""Golden Swallow AKA The Girl with The Thunderbolt Kick"" ""Killer Clans"" also seems very promising.

I believe the only reason I was able to purchase this double feature would be due to an employee mistake. Even on Wal-Mart.com, the disc is not due to be released until next month. I was only able to find it for pre-order.

I must mention that the information, via Amazon, was a little off with regards to the final product. No big deal.

""Golden Swallow"" is the Chang Cheh sequel to King Hu's masterpiece ""Come Drink With Me"". I wanted to like this one more than I did...It was like Chang Cheh was trying so hard to be on the artistic level of King Hu and let's face it, he is not. Right out of the gate the movie was problematic with me. I really did not understand why he chose the opening to play out in such a manner. It was confusing at best. Camera work was sketchy. The movie feels like One Armed Swordsman, rightfully so, in that it stars Jimmy Wang Yu. Don't get me wrong, there were many memorable scenes and things that I hadn't seen in Martial Arts flicks before. In the end it was very hard for me to sit through and truly enjoy it.

Verdict:
3/5 STARS

Killer Clans was amazing. Story. Action. Nudity. :)
It totally absorbed my attention span. Killer Clans played out like a good detective story and it kept me guessing until the very end. WATCH THIS ONE.

Verdict:
5/5 STARS

Overall Verdict:
4/5

This one is a definite buy on the price alone.",1332460800,5,2289,4.5512195121951216
