4077539,4,B0036EBALK,"This is definitely a mood movie, filled with odd camera angles, odd use of night lighting and odd characters. Some are endearing, others are just plain weird. Took me a good 10 minutes to get into the movie, but once that happened, i was entertained. Where can i get a hat like the one danny dyer wears!",1300752000,,303,4.333333333333333
4077540,5,B0036EBALK,"I got caught up in this right away, and thoroughly enjoyed this slightly seedy take on Alice. While not all of the characters or scenarios are believable, that isn't a problem. After all, in the original, we're talking about a girl who talks to playing cards, plays with flamingoes and hedgehogs, and is foolish enough to eat something just because there's a note attached. This version was cleverly done, and I enjoyed the trip through London. I actually enjoyed the driving around bits, which bored another reviewer. The character translations are fun.
The only things I did not like as much were the magical things. Having said that, the first 'appearance' of the Cheshire Cat was absolutely inspired. I thought it was a shame that his character got more magical at the end. I also disliked the magic door that leads Alice back home (no real spoiler there); it could have been done mundanely to as much or more effect. I also thought one particular plot resolution was contrived.
That said, if you have not seen this and are wondering if you should -- by all means do so! I saw this as a rental, and I will likely buy it.",1285804800,4,1124,4.597014925373134
4077541,4,B0036EBALK,"I really liked this take on Alice. This a version of Wonderland that isn't so bright and shiny. Wonderland is gritty and crime filled. Remember watching the original Disney version and thinking these characters are a littlle wonky and left of center. Well these characters take that to a whole new level, so much so that they are rolled over in the ditch on the side of the road. And Wonderland is right there w/ them just as twisted. Alice's story is a little more complicated in this version. For example she meets Whitey(the White Rabbit)by him hitting her w/ his cab. In the course of the movie Alice has several flashbacks to her childhood and some involving a recent conversation w/ her father. It may take you the whole movie to figure out what these mean or you may think you have it after a couple flashes. Alice and Whitey's team up makes the movie. Maggie Grace(Alice) and Danny Dryer(Whitey) have good chemistry which makes it all the better. This take on Wonderland definately isn't for everyone but if you like the strange and unusual be sure to give this movie a look see. Hope you enjoy.",1285718400,4,1103,4.575757575757576
4077542,2,B0036EBALK,"Not to be confused with ""Malice in Wonderland"" (1985) made-for-TV film starring Elizabeth Taylor and Jane Alexander.

The 2009 British film ""Malice in Wonderland"" is a modern-day dark fantasy inspired by the famous tale of Lewis Carroll (real name Charles Lutwidge Dodgson). It stars Maggie Grace (TV series ""Lost"") as a 19-year-old American student in London, who has lost her memories after being hit by a cab. The cab's driver Whitey (Danny Dyer), counterpart of the white rabbit of the Lewis Carroll story, takes her away to the underworld populated by a lot of strange characters.

Many memorable characters from ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"" re-appear - including The Hatter, The Caterpillar, The Duchess, The Cheshire Cat and The King and The Queen - but in a totally different way. The Hatter is here ""Hattie"" (Bronagh Gallagher), who runs a mobile brothel. Also, like the original book, the film is filled with puns and wordplays. ""Stealing tarts"" means something very different.

The idea itself is fine and has potential. You may remember ""Hard Candy"" and its heroine (played by brilliant Ellen Page) that effectively subverted the tale of Little Red Riding Hood. ""Malice in Wonderland,"" however, doesn't have much else to offer besides the random references to the original material. Characters talk a lot, but lack the energy of Guy Ritchie or Quentin Tarantino. The amnesic heroine's back story and her budding romance both look superficial, not enough to sustain the film's running time. We need original visions and ideas that can match the wildly imaginative world of Lewis Carroll.

""Malice in Wonderland"" is certainly an oddity and its quirkiness is fun. Still to me it is too tame and spiritless to be called Wonderland.",1284508800,8,1745,5.133802816901408
4077543,4,B0036EBALK,"I got a screener copy of this dvd and expected it to be a total dud, cashing in on the success of Tim Burton's 'Alice', but was more than surprised when I sat down to view it. I told my wife, ""Don't expect much"", and she concurred but, in truth, we both enjoyed it for what it was.

Instead of being loosely adapted by the Lewis Carroll tale, it was almost a literal translation of the story, except all the characters were rewritten to fit into today's seedy British underworld of lowlife gangsters, drug lords, addicts and pimps, as seen through the eyes of Terry Gilliam.

Alice (Maggie Grace) is an American law student in London, whose parents are insanely wealthy. Struck down by a cab operated by Whitey (the White Rabbit, excellently portrayed by Danny Dyer), she awakens with amnesia in Wonderland, a world that's a million miles from home.

We follow her various escapades as she is dragged through an underworld filled with twisted individuals and some of the lowest forms of human life imaginable by the enigmatic Whitey, who speaks in perverse rhyme with a crazed cockney accent. Alice desperately needs to regain her senses, which isn't easy when she's repeatedly drugged, remember who she is, where she's from, and figure out a way back while she's still in one piece.

A quick tempo aids this flick from dragging, surrealistic neon landscapes and absurd characters and camera angles keep our interest, and a logical but predictable ending closes this illogical lunacy.

3  stars for the flick, rounded up to 4 stars simply because it was a hell of a lot better than I expected, with `Malice' aforethought.",1280707200,19,1621,4.771428571428571
4077544,1,B0036EBALK,"The DVD ""Malice in Wonderland"" was a complete bust. I found it to be  very silly and I would not recommend it to anyone. Maggie Grace is a beautiful young woman but not an actress. The theme was very ""kiddie"".",1279238400,4,209,4.225
4077545,5,B0036EBALK,"...with Snoop Dogg having an album of the same name, and Tim Burton doing a big budget adaptation to the Lewis Carrol story this small film which had been seeking distribution for almost a year finally gets to shine.
This film is simply AWESOME  It keeps with the idea of the Lewis Carol story brilliantly.  When I first saw it I assumed that it would be to Alice in wonderland what the movie Freeway was for Little Red Riding Hood, I was wrong.  This story keeps more to the actual source material not only in feel, but also with character and plot-line development.  What sounds a bit off of kooky actually works in a way that left me in awe.  This movie has instantly become one of my favorite lil' indies.
Acted to the nines by everyone involved, most of whome I've never heard of save for Maggie Grace who was in last years sleeper hit ""TAKEN"", directed with an artsy flair and delivered with endearing locations, and visuals one can not help but to fall down the rabbit hole again.

I say go watch *SOMETHING FOR YOUR HEAD*

Updated,  after more than a month of Amazon leaving this broken video up for rent,  they finally decided to fix it.  I was able to finally watch it and update my review.

4077606,5,B0036EBALK,"I don't know why I love this move so much, but I do. Usually I loathe remakes or re-imaginings of books which I adore. But this - struck a chord. Maybe because it doesn't try too hard to be the book on film - it is itself, giving homage to the original story. All the weird Lewis Carroll characters show up, in odd places usually, but odd in a way that makes sense for this film. This isn't an Alice grown-up movie or a Wonderland which has evolved or even a 'let's take the book and add some more weird stuff for the jaded audience'  movie. It's a weird little film that takes the original theme of girl on an adventure and scruffs it up a bit, gives it an air of danger and hope.",1407974400,,681,4.044444444444444

4077609,4,B0036EBALK,"This ""Alice"" retelling makes me think of a major building renovation - the kind that guts the structure down to the studs, then rebuilds everything around the existing framework. Here, the framework consists of the major characters, very loosely interpreted, and sequences of events, also loosely interpreted. But, instead of characters and settings that would have been familiar to a Victorian child, this story unfolds in a modern underworld. The characters seem to live only by night, largely hidden from most people.

The Alice character herself came across as childlike. Although quite clearly (and attractively) an adult woman, her shortie skirt, trusting nature, soft features, and ineffectual style made her seem pampered and protected from life's harsher realities. And, despite the characters wholly wrapped up in their own interests and avarice, there was a childlike lack of sexual undertone. This movie isn't for children by any means, but still carries a childlike innocence under its very grown-up presentation.

This movie worked well in that odd place, close enough to Dodgson's original for homage but far enough to be its own creature. It doesn't try to insert itself into the original Alice mythos, unlike some unfortunate recent efforts, but still keeps the original in mind. I liked the net result - not one of the greats, not by a long shot, but still an interesting view.

4077610,5,B0036EBALK,"I loved this version of Alice in Wonderland. This is definitely not for younger viewers. This movie takes Alice in Wonderland, throws in sex, drugs, and violence in a ""real world"" environment, and creates a fantastic tale.

4077612,5,B0036EBALK,"I absolutely love this movie.  Its a very ""trippy"" version of Alice in Wonderland, and it is done wonderfully.  I read one review saying it's too hard to follow, well it really isn't if you have half a brain.  This is a very well done movie, with a lot of foreshadowing and symbolism (example of symbolism: the rabbits tale in Whitey's car is supposed to bring together the connection of whitey as the rabbit in Alice in Wonderland). If you can't pick up on the symbolism in this twisted tale, then you should probably rethink your level of intelligence.  This obviously isn't meant for 7 year olds to watch, it's an intelligent, well thought out movie that is meant to be viewed and appreciated by intelligent adults/ young adults.",1392422400,,732,4.651162790697675

Not until I found this, the movie was already 20 minutes in, but this very interesting, twisted version of ""Alice in Wonderland"" had me hooked on, I just couldn't help but to watch it.
There were differences compared to the original ""Alice in Wonderland"" and Tim Burton's, along with being different from the other people versions as well.
This one is a more crazy version, but still I enjoyed it nonetheless, some of the effects and memories are very twisted and makes you feel like you're in someone's dream of some sort.
The plot has a little more serious vibe to it, and it will probably take you the whole movie for you to really figure out what this is about, but it was definitely worth it to me.
If you like weird twists, I suggest you get this and watch it because in my opinion it is definitely worth the money.",1388620800,,947,4.417142857142857

It's basically a spin on the Alice in Wonderland story and very definitely with a twist. I was pleasantly surprised, this turned out to be a gem of a movie. I had rather low expectations and I was glad that this movie far exceeded them. It's kind of hard to put this in a genre, the best fit would be fantasy  due to it's whimsical nature. It was surprisingly well written and the actors created some unique characters. This movie also has several twists and turns which made it more fun to watch.

For fans of the original book (not the cartoon or more recent reimaginings), Malice in Wonderland is a clever and new take on an old classic. There are little clever clues and puns here and there that give you hints about the characters (like the caterpillar has a hooker instead of a hookah) making the movie fun to watch.

4077643,5,B0036EBALK,"First off, I'm writing this review under my husband's account because he's the one with the Prime membership. ^_^ If you've ever read or seen (even though the movie wasn't near as good as the book) Neil Gaiman's 'Neverwhere', you will LOVE this movie. Also, for any parents, there's sexual situations and the F bomb is dropped quite often so I would rate this an R.

Let's face it, Alice in Wonderland has been done, and redone, and reredone, and rereredone to the point of death. At least, that's what it seems like. I really had no idea what to expect from this movie. Not only had I never heard of it, I've seen so many versions of the show that I really didn't think I'd find a version that would entertain me ever. I was totally wrong with this one. Not only are the characters engaging and quirky and original, but the entire  scope and realm of the film had me transfixed through the whole ride. The film starts with Alice running through a subway stations away from someone or something.  She stops to ask a bag lady a question and even in her haste, she drops a few coins on her before bolting away again, up and out of the tunnels, and straight in front of an oncoming taxi with a rather unusual driver. From there it was all 'down the hole'. I really can't go into any more detail because every event is a fun and exciting bit as the story unfolds and the last thing I want to do is give anything away. I will say though that I laughed far more than I thought I would (in a good way). There are many small visual cues here and there that reminded you of what classic you were watching i.e. the tunnel representing Alice going 'down the hole' in the beginning when she is in the cab. As I said before the characters are all very interesting and even likable in their own strange and sometimes unlikable way. I found myself watching this not only once, but twice, and the end didn't disappoint at all.  I highly recommend this to anyone who's a fan of the original Alice in Wonderland, but also to anyone who's a fan of fantasy, action, comedy, drama, and even a bit of sci-fi.

4077644,4,B0036EBALK,"Completely off the wall adaptation of Alice in Wonderland.  That is not to say that it's not good, but it is unique.  The story may be a bit difficult to follow (especially if you're looking for the original in your mind) but it is very good.  Not for the feint of heart and certainly not for children, it is definitely worth a watch.  Do keep in mind that there is some light British humor in this movie so if British humor is beyond you then you might struggle a bit more with this movie.

Maggie Grace is as stunning as ever.  Complete with her standard acting strengths and weaknesses.  However, the complete surprise (at least for the American viewer) was the performance by Danny Dyer.  His acting was spot on and the movie wouldn't have been possible without him.

The cinematography was FANTASTIC.  The sets worked well to create the world that was not from this one but not too far distant either.  If for no other reason, this movie is worth it just because it does stray so far from the world of the silly cat and rabbit in a waistcoat with a pocket-watch.",1350691200,,1067,4.420512820512821

50 minute update: Danny Dyer is an excellent actor, and this movie is best watched stoned.

On with the show...

End notes: The producers had an intriguing vision for a unique portrayal of Carroll's classic, but their script made that vision hazy, rather than clarifying it. Connections with the original Alice fable were forced or obscure, and some scenes were jarringly illogical even in a quasi-fantasy setting.

4077658,5,B0036EBALK,"I have always been intrigued by the Alice and Wonderland story...I really enjoyed how they added their own little twist to the old fairy tale.  In the end, Alice must find herself by going to an ""underworld"" and coming across numerous characters and situations.  All at the same time she is running from a fate that she cannot bear.  As time runs out, she ends up finding herself and her new found ""fate"" and I enjoyed it!",1348272000,,422,4.454545454545454
4077659,5,B0036EBALK,"I really enjoyed this film. It takes a classic story, sticks it in a more modern time and makes it more realistic but it is still able to keep the mystery and allure of the original story. It is very well-made, the characters are likable and relatable. It's an easy movie to watch, no real thinking involved. I liked it very much.",1344816000,,330,4.338709677419355
4077660,4,B0036EBALK,"I wasn't sure if I would like this film. I am not usually one for ""quirky"" type films as they can be confusing, but I thought this one was wonderful. I loved the speech patterns, the puns, the characters. I thought Maggie Grace and ""Whitey"" were the best in their roles, especially together. ""Hattie"" was great too. I hoped I had ""gotten"" the Cheshire Cat's name being Felix, with Felix being the name of that other famous feline! Definite thumbs up for this one.",1342224000,,463,4.523809523809524

4077662,5,B0036EBALK,"A positive note of caution: This movies is a story to behold only for the depths of devious wonderful minds. In logic, it's a modern twist in modern time, with quite an entertaining ride. For the fun it brings, is the truth you find that no worlds of life can be quite divine cept the one in your mind. If you expect your mind to understand this movie without interest to details, like to a psychological ecstasy book like the original Alice in Wonderland...then you'll be lost as every turn of who?, what?, why? But if you think your mind shall mold to the movie then this movie is exactly what you have try to find.

K now right down to the review: this is one of those movies that is amazing to explore the lines in-between the constructions of our marble foundation. If you love, and I do mean love, a twistedly entertaining story that you would wished more people were like to make life interesting then I positively, absolutely, and with little to no hesitation recommend this movie.

4077664,4,B0036EBALK,"This film is visually stunning, with hand drawn backgrounds, simple animation, elaborate costumes and some of the best performances ever to put on drag. It's like the best stage production you can imagine -- with poop jokes. If your tastes run from The Bird Cage to John Waters, then this film is for you. Sure the plot is an adaptation of Alice in Wonderland, but the frequent references to other iconic characters might have you wondering what film you are actually in. And just when you think you've been suitably shocked, they shock you again. But all in dirty good fun. Sexuality abounds, the humor unrelentingly raunchy and scatological, only occasionally falling flat. A couple musical numbers are thrown in for good measure, most notably where the ""tit""mouse gets to explain himself. Everything in this film is geared to push a button in someone. Alice's hallucinogenic encounter with the ""penispillar"" doesn't pull any punches. All in all, a very entertaining children's story for grown-ups only.",1324166400,,1005,5.096969696969697

I was fortunate to go to the film's premier where the audience interacted with the film - funny ""shout outs"" in response to rhetorical questions and pregnant pauses, tossing toilet paper when Alice was flushed down the toilet, and tossing long balloons each time the Flying Magic Dxxxx appeared on screen.

4077684,4,B0036EBALK,"Had I made the film ""Malace in Wonderland"" (2009) I would be quite proud of it.  But it is not something that I would casually show to a random group of people expecting an enthusiastic response.  Its target audience is the off-kilter and twisted, and not even all of those will wildly embrace this effort.  But if you get off on oddity, quirkiness, and fun you should seek out this film.

This is the fourth of five relatively recent efforts to ""out-weird"" Carroll by taking the framework of his story and constructing a feature film that reflects the director's inner child at the expense of the wit and wisdom of the source material.

If a perverse homage is your cup of tea and you don't hold your own image of the Mad Hatter sacred, then you should check out this film along with the other four: Tim Burton's recent release, Terry Gilliam's ""Tideland"" (2005), Czech animator Jan Svankmajerand ""Alice"" (1988), and the one that started the trend-Richard Elfman's ""Forbidden Zone (1982).  ""Malace""  is the best of the group if only because it captures more of the original's spirit.  It's gotten to be a rather well-traveled path but this one benefits from a closer association to the original ""Wonderland"".

In this case Carroll's story is transported to the gritty underworld  of modern day East London (insert lowlifes, drug lords, addicts and pimps here).  But not so gritty that there are not a lot of bizarre characters with counterparts in the original wonderland and looking glass worlds.

Lost's Maggie Grace plays Alice Dodgson (Carroll's real last name although she has amnesia and is nameless for most of the story - perhaps a symbolic connection to his use of a pen name).  Danny Dyer is a London Taxi driver named Whitey, and like the White Rabbit he is often running late despite being obsessed with time.  Nathaniel Parker is a recently released from prison underworld boss, like the Queen of Hearts he holds a trial when his tarts (in this case a string of hookers) are stolen.

Bronagh Gallagher is Hattie, the operator of a truck stop brothel, she holds Mad Hatter tea parties with the assistance of a sleeping Dormouse.  Gallagher's character is by far the best of the ensemble and you wish that she had more screen time.

Gary Beadle is DJ Felix Chester (the Cheshire Cat) and Paul Kaye is the Caterpillar. The Tweedle twins are employed as burly nightclub bouncers . Matt King plays a hustler named Gonzo, a significant character who apparently was kidnapped from the set of a Muppet parody and has no Wonderland parallel (go figure??).

Grace's Alice is your basic still coltish Homecoming Queen who does not yet realize (or at least convincingly pretends to not realize) how incredibly hot she has become.  I have read that she was a last minute replacement for Misha Barton, who also has that quality. Apparently Fellows knew exactly what he wanted for the role and why he wanted it.  He effectively utilizes her face in frequent close-up, building a connection with viewers to Alice's very confused point-of-view.  It works!!

The film has excellent production design, cinematography, and acting for the camera direction.  The writing is the only weak area, not that it is poor but rather the project is so ambitious that another rewrite would have been a good investment.  The romance and the search for the birth mother have some emotional impact but are poorly integrated into the story. You can overlook a lack of logic (this is ""Wonderland"" after all) but those two elements seek to provide a resolution to one of the few stories where one is not needed.

I just don't see Carroll going out of his illogical lunacy with a logical and predictable ending.

Then again, what do I know?  I'm only a child.",1301184000,3,3734,4.784711388455539

Alice (Maggie Grace) is an American law-student on a journey to find her mother; in the process is struck down be a London taxi. This causes her to have a small problem of not remembering who she is or where she is.

We have the same problem keeping track of her in some sort of sleazy dream world. As she moves from one unsavory scene to the next. We eventually see there is meaning to the tale of circles in circles.
