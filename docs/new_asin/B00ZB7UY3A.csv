8719729,4,B00ZB7UY3A,"The frame is cropped enough to remove the black bars at the top and bottom of the screen. Pity as this film thrives best when seen properly. The language for this edition is German with no other options. Really best for completists of the FULL CIRCLE/HAUNTING OF JULIA phenomenon. No menus and minimal chapters, but the film looks decent. The title HAUNTING IN LONDON is never seen in the credits, only FULL CIRCLE.  Perhaps one day a true, official release of FULL CIRCLE will come to the rescue.",1488585600,,497,4.6477272727272725
