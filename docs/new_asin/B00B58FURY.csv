5557837,5,B00B58FURY,"BLUE'S CLUES was just debuting when my son was born, nearly ten years ago. As soon as he was old enough to know what TV was, and who Blue was, he was hooked. I credit his amazing ability to read at age 4, along with a lot of his other cognitive skills, to watching BLUE'S CLUES on a daily basis. The only problem is, that as he got older, BLUE'S CLUES gave way to shows like Pokemon and Yu-Gi-Oh, so by the time his sister was born, we no longer owned every VHS cassette of BLUE'S CLUES that we'd bought. Thankfully, my kids have finally rediscovered the joy and learning of this show, so I was ecstatic when I found the DVD of BLUE'S BIGGEST STORIES. Sure, the shows (all except MAGENTA GETS GLASSES, which is new) are repeats, but for parents like myself who gave away all those old episodes, this is a welcome DVD, indeed!",1179100800,,825,4.261146496815287
5557838,4,B00B58FURY,"Hey, I'm not going to start a Steve vs. Joe argument, but I just think that many of the early shows are classics and many of the later ones aren't.  This disc illustrates my point well.  However, the later shows have the disadvantage of being compared to the earlier ones, although they are still better than half the kids shows on now.

My 7-year old son learned so much from BC, and it continues to educate.  In fact there are several kids shows out there that have based their ""interactive"" format on this show (Little Einsteins, Mickey Mouse Clubhouse, etc). Maybe it's because I've been watching it so long (now with twin 2-year old daughters who love it also) that I see it wearing thin.

With the 10th anniversary having come and gone, WHY haven't these episodes been released in season box sets?  Has anyone heard if this is planned?  It would make more sense than single discs...

I still love BC, and I appreciate all the enjoyment it has given my kids and myself.",1177545600,23,974,4.525714285714286
5557839,5,B00B58FURY,"This DVD is perfect for anyone who has caught 1 episode of Blues Clues and their child is hooked.  This DVD really does have many of the greats and my Son loves ""Magenta Get's Glasses"".  Granted, if you have several individual Blues Clues DVDs already, it isn't worth it.  But for us, we only owned 2 DVDs (Holiday & Blue goes to school), this was a great addition.",1174608000,,365,4.338235294117647
5557840,5,B00B58FURY,"i love that this dvd has both Steve and Joe and shows how Joe got to be in Blue's house. I like that it is longer than most dvd's, so I don't have to change movies as often. I LOVE BLUE!",1173657600,,186,3.5609756097560976
5557841,5,B00B58FURY,My daughter (almost 4) just loves all the Blue's Clue's stories. And I as a mom don't feel too bad to sit my kids (my son is 21 months old) in front of the TV while I am cooking. Kids can really learn a lot from Blue's Clues and my daughter even responds to Steve or Joe when they ask something. The length of the episodes is just the right one as well.,1170892800,,353,3.8493150684931505
5557842,5,B00B58FURY,"My daughter (2 yrs, 3 months) LOVES Blue's Clues...ALL of them.  I love it too as it is a very educational video unlike a lot of others that are just entertaining.  She will watch each episode with eagerness and I actually get something done at the house!  I became a ""believer"" in Blues Clues when she said to my mother-in law, ""Grandma, one day I am going to go to college""!  Grandma told me that if she wasn't sitting down, she would have fallen over.",1168214400,2,454,4.305882352941176
5557843,5,B00B58FURY,My 22 old month son enjoys this DVD. It contains all of his favorite Blue's Clues episodes. We bring this DVD with us when we travel.,1163030400,,133,4.153846153846154
5557844,4,B00B58FURY,"""Blue's Biggest Stories"" is a compilation DVD release designed to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the program. It contains a mix of Steve and Joe ""Blue's Clues"" stories and a bit of ""Blue's Room"" as well.

""Magenta Gets Glasses"" is the only episode on here that hasn't been released before on DVD. It's a pretty neat story. In this one, Blue's best friend Magenta learns that she has to get glasses. She's nervous both about getting them and then about wearing them, but with our help, Steve, Blue and her owner Miranda help her to get over her fears.

This DVD comes with ""Blue's Memory Photos"" --- a brief photo album of some major moments from the series. It also comes with a couple of ""Blue's Room"" short-segments that are actually pretty good. Also included inside is a note from show creators Angela C. Santomero and Traci Paige Johnson.

The other episodes included on this DVD are as follows:

""Blue's Birthday""

In this Steve episode, it's Blue's birthday. We arrived early, so we help get things set up. We also skidoo with Steve to find a present for Blue. And we play Blue's Clues to find out what Blue wants for her birthday.

""Treasure Hunt""

In another major Steve episode, the characters go on a treasure hunt. Content from this was used for one of the ""Blue's Clues"" albums, so it's a pretty important episode.

""Blue's Pajama Party""

Blue's first-ever sleepover! We play Blue's Clues with Steve to find out what Blue wants to do tonight.

""Steve Goes to College""

Definitely an important episode. This ep is the final episode in the ""Meet Joe"" arc. Joe takes over hosting duties for the show and Steve goes away to ""college.""

""Blue Takes You to School""

Actually, I don't really think too much of this. The pacing is too fast-paced and rushed and it doesn't really seem to work. The idea of this one though is that the viewers, Blue and Joe are helping Periwinkle out as he goes to school for the first time.

""The Legend of the Blue Puppy""

Whether you like ""Blue's Room"" or not, this is definitely a major one. This is the episode in which Blue learns of her legend and searches for a special key to unlock her greatest gift --- her playroom. Once she finds it, she enters Blue's Room for the first time and talks.

""Blue's Room Snacktime Play Date""

You know, ""Blue's Room"" has actually become a pretty good show, but this pilot episode does not do it justice. They're trying to introduce every character and the pacing is just really slow and boring. This episode is practically unwatchable and the only good thing about it is the reading of ""If You Give a Mouse a Cookie."" Avoid.

Overall, ""Blue's Clues"" fans will probably be interested in this tenth anniversary collection. However, if you already have all these episodes on DVD or your own tapes, there may not be much for you here.",1161993600,84,2813,4.592
5557845,5,B00B58FURY,"Both of my boys (age 4 and 16 mos.) are big Blue's Clues fans. This DVD has some of their favorites all together in one place. It includes:

1. Blue's Birthday (my first son's all-time favorite)

2. Treasure Hunt

3. Blue's Pajama Party

4. Magenta Gets Glasses

5. Steve Goes to College (introduces Joe, the second host)

6. Blue Takes you to School

7. The Legend of the Blue Puppy

8. Blue's Room Snacktime Play Date (we are not a big fan of Blue's Room, but at least there is only one episode here)

This is a great value for the $$ and an excellent introduction for new Blue's Clue's fans!",1159228800,46,594,4.2792792792792795
5557846,5,B00B58FURY,"Blue's Clues is (was) a great series.  I can't say the same for Blue's Room.  Blue's Clues was well organized, well developed, and much more educational than Blue's Room.  In fact the whole concept of finding 3 clues is completely gone with Blue's Room.  That was the point in the beginning - Blue could not speak so she used clues to explain herself.  The producers should never have changed the format and should have stuck with the Blue's Clues theme.  I even get the idea that Blue's Room is a less well thought out, less developed (probably cheaper to produce), relatively brainless show.  BUT Blue's Clues was great.  Steve was great, Joe was great, the music was great, and so much easier to watch with your child than Blue's Room (seriously).  They should just find another host to give variety and continue the series.  Ok... enough said.  I have purchased just about all the Blue's Clues DVDs (and unfortunately) a Blue's Room DVD.  The episodes on this Blue's Clues Biggest Stories DVD - are they already on the other DVDs?  I don't want to buy the same episodes.  I think the Blue Takes You to School is a direct repeat/resell.  Why can't they put other episodes on these?  I have heard and read about the 'Blue Skidoos To the Planets' episode, but I have never seen it and wondered if it is or ever will be available on DVD?  I wish they would not sell the same episodes on different DVDs.  Anyway, my son was about 20 months old when we started watching Blue's Clues and he has learned so much and loves Blue's Clues so much.  I want to know what is really on this DVD before I buy it, so if anyone knows, please write.... at least one episode seems to be a repeat that I already bought and own.  Also Dora the explorer is nice (not on this DVD - or is it?), but I never see anything with Diego.  Why only Dora?  The fact that the Dora series exists seems to show that quite certainly America has two primary languages.  Good luck and best wishes to all.",1154390400,6,1968,4.390581717451523

5557871,3,B00B58FURY,"This was received as a gift. There are 8 episodes on this DVD, at $4.99 its great for the price. My toddler loves Blue and can sing most of the songs. I don't really care for the Blues room episodes, the characters are puppets. They are pretty annoying. We like the original cartoon Blue so we just don't watch the entire disc. Episodes are Blue' Birthday, Treasure Hunt, Blue's Pajama Party, Magenta Gets Glasses, Steve Goes to College, Blue Takes You to School, The Legend of the Blue Puppy, Blue's Room Snack time Play Date. The Legend episode starts out as the original cartoon format. Blue meets Moona who helps her find a secret box where Blue can go to play and talk. Here all the characters are puppets and Joe is not included. The full Snack time episode takes place in Blue's room (puppet format). Since this was a gift its not that big of a deal but if I were going to buy a Blue's Clues DVD I would look for one that was only the original cartoon format.",1483747200,2,966,4.342541436464089

It's a good length and nice selection of shows. So if you're looking for a good Blue's DVD, give this one a shot.",1395532800,4,441,4.1395348837209305

5557968,5,B00B58FURY,"Blues Clues is the only show or cartoon my 1 year pays attention to. He even tries to interact with the characters (Steve) and he says ""Blue"".
 I think this DVD is great.
The only one my son isn't interested in, is the one that Blue turns into a live character.
The night time one is great and sometimes we put it on for him before he gets put to sleep. Sometimes when he fights putting on his pajamas, I show him that Steve is wearing pajamas and he calms down.",1391040000,,462,4.076923076923077

Arrived a few days after I purchased it and looks as pictured. The quality of the DVD itself was in good condition, no scratches or marks on it. It contained all stated episodes and does not freeze or skip.

Perfect for your toddler to watch when you need some ""quiet time"" or need to get work done around the house!

5557973,5,B00B58FURY,"this is a very good dvd for Blue's fans or those new to Blue.  as another reviewer stated this is very good because it goes in order from Steve to Joe to Blue's room.  I don't like the other reviews that complain about Steve vs Joe.  the reviews should be about our kids and our son, who is 3 with Down syndrome LOVES this DVD and all 3, Steve, Joe, or Blue's room.  I think Steve is just as silly as Joe, not sure why some complain that Joe is not as good or whatever.  our son finds both of them silly.  our son also has a communication disorder and since watching Blue, has been using more words/attempting them.  he also imitates the songs, especially the clues song.  overall, highly recommend -  also, they have done a great job in the transitions from Steve to Joe, keeping the same format, songs as well as the movements.  Blue's room is also adorable and we like it because it is different, giving him variety.  we like that Blue is very easy to understand, speaks clearly, and like Clue's - the format is simple, not busy or fast, and not a lot of distractions/things going on.  our son can watch these episodes over and over.",1383696000,8,1136,4.306603773584905

5557975,3,B00B58FURY,"Overall my child is happy with this, however you should know that only about half the episodes have 'Steve', and the other half have the later 'Joe' character.  And the final 2 episodes are the very late episodes where Blue is a puppet, not animated.  Needless to say, the puppet and 'Joe' episodes are not nearly as entertaining to my child as the episodes with 'Steve' are.",1381104000,8,375,4.582089552238806

5557977,5,B00B58FURY,this is long and my daugther loves it. I love it when we have to take a trip to my dads which is over an hour and this is still playing. She doesnt like the puppet Blue so much but the rest she loves. Great DVD and great for long trips too.,1379203200,,240,3.6346153846153846

This dvd has quite a few episodes, and holds his full attention.  He lights up when it's in play, excitedly pointing everything out to me.  I love how interactive these shows are.

Mostly Steve, couple Joe, and a Blue's Room, which is live-action puppet Blue where they talk and sing, etc. I think it's annoying, my daughter likes it and my nephew is bozo for it. Love the episodes included, classics. If you want to buy one Blue, I would get this one. (Just think of Blue's Room as an annoying, fuzzy bonus!)",1360281600,,415,4.265822784810126

It's my second favorite Blue's Clues DVD. (My favorite is Blue's Big Musical Movie). It is very educational: teaches nursery rhymes and phonics as part of a treasure hunt; the concept of night and day with the celestial bodies as part of a sleepover (Pajama-nauts); patterns at the birthday party; builds confidence (or consideration) if have to wear glasses (or friends need them); going to college - aspiration in these pre-schoolers; using imagination to have fun - a really good tool especially for ""only-child""...the list goes on and on. A really great collection.

Yes, Joe is there too. Only recently saw that there is some disparity in size at certain times - too much blue screen shots. But it's not too obvious.",1345680000,,869,4.748344370860927

5558010,4,B00B58FURY,"This is a cute Blues Clues DVD, but it's not actually my favorite. It's all of Blue's big moments, so it doesn't have as much of an educational twist to it as most. Cute to watch, but just not my favorite Blues Clues DVD.",1261699200,,221,4.045454545454546
5558011,5,B00B58FURY,"Its a 4 hour drive to Grandma's house and, at 196 minutes long, this DVD has been a sanity saver in our family!  We make the long trip to Grandma's several times a year and its great to know that I can stick this disc into my toddler's portable player and he will happily watch Blue for the entire drive.  No need to stop and reload the player.  No need to fiddle with the remote while I'm driving.  More than three hours of quality entertainment for twelve bucks?  If I could give it more than five stars I would!",1259539200,3,514,4.151515151515151
5558012,4,B00B58FURY,"Blue's Clues is an award-winning animated TV series where a human actor interacts with an animated blue puppy named Blue and various other animated characters to play a detective-style game (Blue's Clues).  In the game, the human (Steve or Joe, depending on the season) tries to figure out what Blue is trying to tell him by finding a series of three clues and reasoning out their meaning.  This is a viewer participation encouraged show, where Steve/Joe asks for YOUR help in finding the clues, solving puzzles and figuring out what Blue wants.

This DVD is a mix of Steve and Joe episodes--I like that this one has Steve episodes in a row and then a transitional one and then Joe episode(s).  One of the other DVDs alternates Steve, Joe, Steve, Joe--which tends to confuse my toddler who's most familiar with Steve.

Episodes:
1)Blue's Birthday:  a sweet episode--Steve even helps YOU give Blue a gift, a stuffed dog that shows up in later episodes and turns out to be ""key"" to the spin-off show ""Blue's Room"".
2)Treasure Hunt:  a fun and creative episode, complete with a treasure map and a guest appearance by Steve's grandma!
3)Blue's Pajama Party:  a good pre-bedtime episode, this one takes place at night so Steve spends the whole time trying not to fall asleep; ends with a bedtime story.
4) Magenta Gets Glasses:  Features Miranda, Magenta's owner.  Steve and Miranda are shy around each other--how cute!  Apparently, this episode was not aired on TV.
5) Steve Goes to College:  Transitional episode from Steve to Joe, Steve's little brother.  Steve says goodbye and even calls YOU from college.  Joe's all moved into the house to live with Blue and take over playing Blue's Clues.  This episode is a bit emotional even though they try to keep it upbeat and you may have to explain around it if you watch other Steve episodes later...maybe Steve's home on Summer Break or something....
6) Blue Takes You To School: a Joe and Blue episode.  It's Perriwinkle the Cat's first day of School so Blue shows her the ropes.
----
7) The Legend of the Blue Puppy: instead of playing Blue's Clues, Joe and Blue get a visit from Moona, the moon fairy, who tells a legend about when Blue was born (under a blue moon, of course) and shows Blue how to get to Blue's magical play Room.  This is the introductory episode into Blue's Room. Blue's Room is a spin-off series with Blue as a talking muppet-esque puppet. Either you like these or you don't; they are very different from Blue's Clues.
8) Blue's Room Snacktime Play Date: another Blue's Room short.  My toddler doesn't like Blue's Room, so we didn't watch this one.

Not all of the Blue's Clues episodes are out on DVD and the DVD releases group the episodes by themes rather than seasons.  Of the choices, this is one of the better mix of episodes--they aren't too similar, there are some Steve and some Joe episodes and a nice mix of auxiliary characters.  With 6 Blue's Clues episodes and 2 Blue's Room shorts, this DVD is lengthy enough to spread out over a few days.",1257552000,9,3023,4.666037735849057
5558013,5,B00B58FURY,"I like that this one starts on it's own. You don't have to wait for previews or push play on the menu. It starts all by itself. And my kids love watching it over and over again. It gets their imagination going and I hear them playing, pointing at random things and saying ""a clue! a clue!""

I found it for less at Target. I didn't know anything about blue's clues when I picked it up but thought I'd give it a try since it was so cheap. It turned out to be one of their favorites.",1251244800,,480,3.948453608247423

5558015,4,B00B58FURY,"We're Americans living in Germany, so don't get any of the episodes on regular US TV. Picked this up on arecent visit, and my son loves it. We only had the Classic Clues at home, so great to have more variety to choose from. I watched some episodes with him and must say I was very impressed, particularly with the ""Pajama Party"": it explained so well about the earth spinning around the sun, night and day etc. My son got it immediately and enjoys it so much! Definitely great entertainment for the kids, but they learn somthing AND feel like they are partcicpating when Steve/Jo asks them questions. Money well spent!",1247443200,,619,4.585585585585585
5558016,5,B00B58FURY,"My 17-month-old daughter loves Blue and when I watch it with her, I also enjoy it (unlike Elmo).  The episodes provide many opportunities for me to interact with her and ask her questions or provide more of a story line so that she doesn't become a vegetable on the couch.  She also points to the TV and jabbers about different scenes.  This has inspired me to throw a Blue's Clues birthday party for her.",1241049600,,405,4.445945945945946
5558022,5,B00B58FURY,"I am so glad my child loves blues clues. This DVD is such a great learning tool for kids. I am not one to let my child watch tv all day but we do let him watch some in the morning and in the evening and he has picked up so many words from these books and dvds. Couldn't ask for a better cartoon.

5558023,5,B00B58FURY,"My 2 yr old son has never, EVER sat down and watched the TV for more than 30 sec. I put this on and he gets SO excited! He starts dancing around yelling ""BOO!BOO!"" Which is ""Blue"". Im definately ordering more Blue movies for him, as they teach him tons of new things and give me a ""Mom"" break for awhile :0). Also you absolutely CANNOT beat the price. There are 8 episodes, more than any kids DVD Ive seen. Two have the ""Blues Room"", which he doesnt like as much as the regular show, but he'll watch it. And there are 6 other ""normal"" Blues Clues shows so......Best investment Ive ever made!",1233446400,3,591,4.238938053097345
5558024,5,B00B58FURY,A wonderful addition to the Clues collection-My 3 yr old grandbaby loves Blues and this is a fabulous collection and runs I think over 2hrs and we bought it for a long car trip and it kept him happy and busy for most of the 9 hr trip-loooooooooooooove that. He doesnt care for much as far as cartoons are television so Blue is great and the amount of word recognition and educational value he teaches is priceless.,1223251200,,414,4.3896103896103895

5558026,5,B00B58FURY,"I purchased this awesome DVD on my 50th birthday in May of 2007, my very first ""Blue's Clues"" DVD in fact, at Wal-Mart.  I ended up buying it for just $7.46 since I had a coupon from a box of Kix cereal worth $4 off any ""Blue's Clues"" DVD.  What a neat bargain!  I have no children but I find Blue very irresistible.  I love the part in the episode ""Blue's Birthday"" where Blue looks at her gift from Steve, Turquoise the turtle, while she's wagging her tail.  Steve says ""Happy birthday, Blue; I love you!"" and Blue looks like she's making eyes at him and then licks his face!  What a cute, precious moment!  I especially like any episode where Blue licks Steve's face, including ""Snack Time,"" ""A Snowy Day"" & ""What Game Does Blue Want to Play?""  Overall, this DVD is really nice to have and is highly recommended.  In addition, I also own over 20 VHS videos of ""Blue's Clues"" episodes I've purchased for cheap at the local thrift store.  It would be nice if Paramount would release more compilation DVDs like ""Blue's Biggest Stories"" for future generations of children to enjoy. ""Bow-bow-bow-bow!""",1212624000,,1099,4.561224489795919
5558027,5,B00B58FURY,"We wore out the first copy and had to get another one.  My Baby gets up asking for Blue and that's all he wants.  He's the younger of two and so the first copy was already worn from finger prints etc. . . , But this particular video has so many episodes, I can put it in and forget it for like, two hours.  He adores Blue and by the time he gets to the end it seems like days since he saw the first episode.  He also hates to go to new places, so a great ice breaker for any serogate grand-parents who want us to bring the boys over.  I simply ask, can we put our DVD in when we get there?  It calms him down, and makes him a much more social baby. Amazing.  I don't know what the magical draw is for this little blue dog, but as long as it works, I'll keep pushing play.",1203811200,,771,3.78125

5558031,5,B00B58FURY,"This was the first dvd purchased for our toddler. Some of the best episodes there are of Blue and Steve, not to mention how Joe was introduced and how Steve went off to college. My little one loves, loves, loves watching this DVD, especially when he's almost ready for nap time or getting ready for bed. We just pop it in the dvd and let him watch until he falls asleep. Again, this teaches him so much that he won't even begin to let an adult teach him.  Sharing, gifts, people leaving.  He's even learned to draw a great amount of things just from watching how Steve or Joe draw.",1185321600,,581,4.2727272727272725
