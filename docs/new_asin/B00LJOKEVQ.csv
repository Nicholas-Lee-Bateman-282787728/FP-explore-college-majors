8666232,1,B00LJOKEVQ,"From mistakes with Queen Serenity's hair being yellow in the first five episodes of the Moon Pride opening, to Sailor Venus' outfit constantly switching between her old V and regular one, the Sailor Moon Crystal original net animation series has been filled with tons of mistakes...BUT this error im these 2 episodes takes the cake.

How could they not fix the error in ""Secret - Sailor Jupiter??"" As some of you may have noticed, Sailor Moon killed Petz with Moon Princess Halation using stock footage of Moon Healing Escalation complete with her Moon Stick and everything. I thought this error would have been fixed in the Bluray release but no. It still stayed. All TOEI had to do was replace that footage with a Moon Princess Halation attack (in the rain or at night I guess) and problem would have been solved. Talk about pure laziness and carelessness on Toei animation's part...hopefully these mistakes won't continue when the Infinity arc gets made (yes, Sailor Moon Crystal is continuing!! ^^). Maybe we'll get a horrible mistake of Super Sailor Moon and Super Sailor Chibi Moon using Moon Gorgeous Meditation with Double Rainbow Moon Heartache footage...-_- oh dear I'm worried for the future of this series...",1443484800,,1220,4.980392156862745
