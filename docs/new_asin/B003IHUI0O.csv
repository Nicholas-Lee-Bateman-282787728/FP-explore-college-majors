4126325,5,B003IHUI0O,"I thought this movie was a lot of fun. Good acting, great action, great special effects. The only thing I would like to see improved with the next one is a little more of the humor that Pirates of the Caribbean had. I think Jake Gyllenhaal made a great prince but not on the level of Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow. Still, a good start to what will hopefully be a series of movies to come.",1275091200,10,385,4.1466666666666665
4126326,4,B003IHUI0O,"""Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time"" is an exceedingly simply story told amidst a wealth of complicated stunt work and impressive special effects, which is basically a fancy way of saying that it's thin on premise but an absolute pleasure to look at. That doesn't necessarily make it a bad movie, although it does prevent me from appreciating it as anything more than an action spectacle - exempting a few weak references to recent political events, which I'm sure the intended family audiences will not pick up on. To be fair, it is based on a video game, and video games generally don't go above and beyond the razzle-dazzle of their graphics or the cool maneuvers players use for the characters. And I admit that, as video game adaptations go, it's quite entertaining. A bit derivative perhaps, and certainly slow in gaining momentum, but in the end, it's still entertaining.

The setting is a fantastical representation of the sixth century Persian Empire, where vast stretches of desert separate kingdoms of flat rooftops and ornate palaces towering sky high. The protagonist is Prince Dastan (Jake Gyllenhaal), drawn from elements of every Arabian archetype from Abu the Thief to Aladdin to Sinbad to Ali Baba; he was an orphaned street urchin before being adopted by King Sharaman (Ronald Pickup), who was impressed by his display of courage in the face of certain death. After fifteen years of loyalty and bravery, Dastan is framed by his wicked uncle Nizam (Ben Kingsley) for an exceptionally heinous crime, forcing him to make an acrobatic escape from the city. You know the kind of escape I'm talking about; it involves impossible stunts and a generous donation from the special effects department.

Why was Dastan framed? Here enters Princess Tamina (Gemma Arterton), whose peaceful kingdom was invaded by Sharaman's army on the belief that dangerous weapons were being concealed for sinister purposes. (Do I sense a connection to the 2003 invasion of Iraq and the fruitless search for WMDs?) Tamina is the keeper of the film's MacGuffin: The Dagger of Time, an ancient knife with magical sand swirling in its glass hilt. If the jewel atop the dagger is pressed, the person holding it has the power to travel back a full minute in time, which is apparently just long enough for key characters to reverse fateful decisions and change the course of history. Were such a thing real, I'd probably have lots of fun with it.

But for Tamina, it's serious business. The sand in the hilt is linked to a massive underground crystal that, if cracked open, could unleash a destructive force the likes of which no one has ever experienced. It's up to Tamina and Dastan to return the dagger to its rightful place, restore peace between their respective kingdoms, and stop Nizam before he has the chance to alter the past.

Perhaps it's the mystical nature of the dagger that gives me pause, especially in relation to the underground crystal with which it's linked. This dagger, shiny and exotic, manipulates time under rules that seemed straightforward enough until they were obscured by events near the end of the film, events that shock us into believing they were clever when it fact they were merely the result of a narrative copout. Something within me is intrinsically resistant to stories involving time travel, for they can be anything at any time with no regard for structure, sequence, or even basic applications of logic. What we get from the end of ""Prince of Persia"" is not the tying of loose ends so much as an exercise in trickery, which is to say that, given what had gone on before, it cheats.

Perhaps I have reservations about the characters, who are decent enough within the context of the story but are hardly memorable in the grand scheme of things. That could have more to do with the actors. Gyllenhaal, despite being ripped and in command of a convincing British accent, plays Dastan so generically that the role could have been given to any leading male. Arterton is certainly beautiful, although it takes her too long to develop Tamina into anything worthwhile; for the first forty-five minutes of the film, I found her incredibly annoying, always with the smart aleck dialogue. And then there's Alfred Molina as the obligatory yet distracting comedy relief - a money-grubber who created an isolationist community to avoid paying taxes. Who knew Objectivism stretched all the way back to the sixth century?

Seriously though, what does all this amount to? Like so many summer popcorn flicks that have come before it, it amounts to a superficial but enjoyable experience at the movies. While ""Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time"" lacks any real importance, it does hold its own as a showcase of visual delights, so yes, I'm going to recommend it for sheer cinematic escapism. You want CGI? You've got CGI. You want stunts? You've got stunts. You want Jake Gyllenhaal? You've got Jake Gyllenhaal. Perhaps it was too much to hope for a masterpiece, although I do find myself thinking of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark,"" which proved that supernatural artifacts, exotic locations, heroes, villains, and plenty of action all in the same movie can be both preposterous and brilliant. I have reservations, but I can't deny that I liked what I saw.",1275004800,10,5261,4.885778275475924

Andrews Blu-ray Review: The PRINCE OF PERSIA: THE SANDS OF TIME [2010] film is a handsome, fast-paced adventurous film that certain can be enjoyed by all age groups. Based on a 2003 Ubisoft video game, the film definitely has dash and flourishes with adequate performances and expert special effects that keep a far-fetched tale buoyant that I know youngsters will enjoy and get a definitely lasting impression. But film buffs could enjoy it as a nostalgic throwback to the antics of Douglas Fairbanks and Errol Flynn. Jerry Bruckheimers computer-game crossover PRINCE OF PERSIA: THE SANDS OF TIME is shamelessly camp and often unintentionally hilarious.

The setting is an imagined version of ancient Persia, and it's all swords and horses, wind and sand, mighty cities and noble princes. The maguffin is a dagger that unleashes sands that can make time reverse, and in the wrong hands could bring about Earth's destruction. Jake Gyllenhaal plays Dastan, an acrobatic warrior who was adopted as an orphaned child by the benevolent King Sharaman [Ronald Pickup] and raised with two princes, Tus [Richard Coyle] and Garsiv [Toby Kebbell]. Guided by the king's silky brother, Nizam [Ben Kingsley], they lay siege to a city called Alamut where it is believed are hidden weapons of mass destruction.

PRINCE OF PERSIA: THE SANDS OF TIME comes closest to grabbing your attention early on. In the films opening sequences we are introduced to Dastan [Jake Gyllenhaal], a prince of the ancient Persia. Before an act of kindness brought him to the royal family, Dastan lived as a street urchin. It was there, in the dusty markets, that he learned amazing skills of agility, which back then he used to stay alive, and now uses to protect the Persian Empire. Though Great Britain won't be populated for centuries, as played by Jake Gyllenhaal, who even with a Hollywood tan may still be the palest man in the Middle East, and Prince Dastan and everyone else in the film for that matter, has for some reason an inexplicable British accent.

Much of the films early scenes send Jake Gyllenhaal leaping and climbing and clamouring around ancient buildings in what amounts to a cinematically dazzling Parkour demonstration and the definition of Parkour, is a method of overcoming obstacles by adapting ones movements to the environment. In practice that means the fastest way to get past a parked camel might be to go over it, rather than around it, and the best way to get off a roof might be to jump down onto an awning, leap over to an overhang, and swing down to the ground using a bit of rope. Even though some of its computer enhanced, Prince of Persias great fun as long as Jake Gyllenhaals jumping and diving and slithering past obstacles, until that is, the plot kicks in.

Theres a murder and Dastan is falsely accused. Theres some confusion as to who the storys villain is, but only to the people in the film, not the audience, since this is a film which contains Ben Kinglsey. Theres a girl whom Dastan must take with him on his journey to clear his name. And theres a dagger which, when you push a button on its hilt, rewinds time to give you another shot at whatever it is youve just screwed up. The daggers a neat little device, unfortunately it can only be used once or twice and only to rewind brief periods of time.

At the start of the film it shows how Dastan was adopted by King Sharaman as a young street orphan, it shows the boy and his friend, Bis, escaping from guards after stealing food. Dastan protects Bis and leads the guards away from him. After a short chase, he is captured and slapped hard across the face several times. The guards hold out Dastans arm and raise a sword in order to chop off his hand but they are stopped by the King who is nearby. While nothing explicit happens and the part where the hand is about to be chopped off is done quickly, any children who do not understand this may be a little distressed by this type of punishment being carried out, especially to a child.

Jake Gyllenhaal as the films protagonist, Dastan, is very likeable and carries the role well. Alfred Molinas role Sheik Amar is a loveable rogue who brings plenty of comedy to the proceedings. As the magical dagger which reverses time is the main aspect of the film, it is a little disappointing that it isn't used more often; however this doesnt detract from the rest of the story. If you are looking for an action-packed film which doesnt take itself too seriously, PRINCE OF  PERSIA: THE SANDS OF TIME is likely to appeal and be a firm favourite for a long time to come, especially as it is full of humour, fun and sword fights that I know everyone will enjoy.

PRINCE OF PERSIA: THE SANDS OF TIME falls into the ever-popular category of a summer cinema scenario which was best described by William Shakespeare as ""sound and fury, signifying nothing."" It looks totally impressive film and there is never a dull moment. Director Mike Newell understands the dynamics and rhythm of a big-budget fantasy adventure, and crafts something eminently watchable. With lots of running around and plenty of special effects, the only thing missing for the viewer is a game controller and the ability to replay some of the most challenging moves and jumps. But overall a very adventurous fantasy film, that you leave your brain elsewhere, as the film does not tax your brain cells and in the end you feel you have watched a very magical adventure film.

Blu-ray Image Quality  Jerry Bruckheimer Films and Walt Disney Home Entertainment brings us this superb and impressive 1080p image presentation and also an equally impressive 2.40:1 aspect ratio. The result is a great looking fantasy film with excellent resolution of detail and excellent colour saturation. Natural grain is present throughout from the Super35 film stock and is untouched by any digital manipulation or grain removal. Desert colour tones are strikingly well delineated with inky blacks and great dynamic range in bright scenes. Contrast is well balanced to provide a fair amount of ""pop up"" images that gives you a sort of three dimensional picture quality and resulting in an excellent depth of field and total immersion. While the colour temperature is at times slightly warmer than expected, but despite this it is entirely natural looking and doesn't give the viewer any sense of artificiality. While some dark scenes, especially the one with the Hassansin temple scene, demonstrates a slightly reduced shadowy detail and minimal black image, but by and large dark scenes in the film are perfectly resolved and very little information is missing. Technically speaking there is little to fault in this wonderful presentation from Walt Disney Home Entertainment, and I know you will love this Blu-ray video transfer.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  Jerry Bruckheimer Films and Walt Disney Home Entertainment presents us with a superb 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio experience and is a worth addition to the superb and stunning video presentation. You get to experience soaring dynamic range, aggressive use of all the channels, with definitely excellent directionality sounds. The brilliantly designed sound effects are equally impressive at whisper quiet or ear popping levels with excellent definition and striking realism. But most impressive is the Harry Gregson-Williams music film score that provides a really excellent ambience to the film, and is integrated perfectly with the remainder of the sounds you hear. The surround sound effects are used actively in combination with perfect pans lending far more directionality to the audio than I am used to; I often found myself hearing action occurring around and behind me and grinning like a Cheshire cat. From the opening scene of the film your subwoofer speaker will be in for a good workout. So all in all the entire audio mix will convey what you will enjoy about this fantasy film.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Special Feature: Disney CineExplore: The Sands of Time: Take control of the dagger and use it to unlock secrets behind your favourite scene! Turn back time and uncover over 40 spellbinding segments that includes Walking Up Walls, Filming in Morocco, Ostrich Jockey Try-outs and other really fascinating items. The segments are only a couple of minutes each and they are really well made. It runs alongside the entire film and during some scenes a small dagger of time will appear on the right hand side of the screen and when it appears you can press the ENTER button on your remote control before the sand runs out to trigger a small behind-the-scenes clips, interviews, how shots were created, how actors were trained for certain combat and movement. It is a fairly substantial collection and enough to fill in your vast curiosity about this fantasy film. With this exclusive interactive feature, this Blu-ray disc puts you in control and really makes watching the film a much more rewarding experience instead of the audio commentary track you get with some Blu-ray discs while watching the film.

Special Feature: Deleted Scene: The Banquet: Garsiv Presents Heads [2011] [1080p] [2.40:1] [1:26] Here we get only one deleted scene that could have changed the audiences whole view of a certain character, especially the entire story and especially other characters. Here we find Dastan is supposed to escort Tamina to the victory celebration and Gastav offers a gift to his father in the form of the heads of his enemies, set atop a silver platter. This is presented in 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio.

SNEAK PEEKS: Here we get to view the following three trailers, which are: Our Family Scrapbook Disney Blu-ray promotion [2010] [1080p] [1.78:1] [00:59]. Beauty and the Beast: Diamond Edition [2010] [1080p] [1.78:1] [1:38]. TRON: Legacy [2010] [1080p] [2.40:1] [2:14].

Finally, PRINCE OF PERSIA: THE SANDS OF TIME [2010] is probably the best computer game scenario to hit the big screen adaptation I have seen in a very long time. The visual and audio aspects of the film speak for themselves as both approaches to reach that demo image quality and this along with a story that is family safe is a really refreshing fantasy film to review. Both casual film goers and enthusiast home theatre buffs will find the fantasy film very enjoyable and will probably be particularly enthralled by the story scenario, and the film does a great job of living up to its potential. Jake Gyllenhaal is a surprisingly convincing Prince alongside Gemma Arterton as Princess Tamina. Overall this is a superb fantasy film release with excellent 1080p image quality, superb audio quality, and a collection of extras that are entirely in 1080p HD quality. Highly Recommended!

4126389,4,B003IHUI0O,"Okay, lets face it; you aren't going to get Lawrence of Arabia out of a movie based on a video game. The whole concept has to lower your expectations somewhat, and no one can blame you for that at all. Still, you have Jake Gyllenhaal and Gemma Arterton in the movie along with Ben Kingsley. Theres something to be had here.

The casting in this moving could not have been better. Gyllenhaal and Arterton have real chemistry between them and the story has enough meat on its bones to make you forget its origins. Theres betrayal and death, a great backstory, and all the while, time travel is popping up here and there.

Whats not to love?

Despite the gruesome nature of some of the scenes, the movie is more intense than scary, and its interesting how they pull it all together in the end.

Ill give it an honest four stars because I liked the movie.",1501372800,,851,4.401273885350318

You'd think the action would be noisier and the characters flatter since this was based on a video game, but the story lasts well. It's the kinda fun movie you wanna watch again-- because, somewhere in all the romantic action adventure fantasy, there is something real. You are somewhere in it.
Personally, I think Ben Kingsley rocks the villain role and the Hassansins are freaky scary and highly effective!",1480982400,,565,5.1521739130434785

4126456,3,B003IHUI0O,"Released in 2010 and directed by Jim Mike Newell, Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time stars Jake Gyllenhaal as an adopted son of the king of Persia and Gemma Arterton as a princess of a nearby kingdom. They team-up after the former becomes a fugitive with a magic dagger. Ben Kingsley, Richard Coyle, Toby Kebbell, Alfred Molina and Steve Toussaint have supporting roles.

Based on the video game, this was supposed to be the start of a franchise in the mold of the Pirates of the Caribbean flicks, but it was not to be due to disappointing box office results. The first 45-50 minutes are great, reminiscent of the various Sinbad movies but with no-seafaring, way more action and all-around superior production values. Its like the Conan the Barbarian films, but less dour and brooding; sorta akin to The Mummy (1999) and The Mummy Returns (2001).

Like my title blurb says, Prince of Persia is spectacular as far as production quality goes, but after the first 50 minutes it goes downhill with a needlessly convoluted plot and one action scene after another. There are a lot of amusing and exciting things going on, but the story fails to hook; everything morphs into a tedious blur. On the positive side, Jakes a heroic protagonist and Gemma is ravishing in an offbeat way, although the filmmakers shoulda taken more advantage of her presence.

The film runs 116 minutes and was shot in Morocco.

4126624,5,B003IHUI0O,"I'm just going to add my own two cents and say I loved this movie! I only recently watched it for the first time (borrowed from my local library), but absolutely loved it and shortly thereafter bought a copy for myself. I don't play video games and didn't realize the movie was based on one, but that didn't retract from my enjoyment of the film. I also loved the fight scenes because they were unique to anything I had seen before. I'm not a Jake Gyllenhaal fan, but I really enjoyed him in this role, and I thought--as opposed to other reviewers--that the plot was fun and different and the two main characters balanced each other well.

For some context, I'll say this: I loved John Carter, loved the LOTR trilogy, I'm loving the Avenger series (although I don't care for the mass amount of fighting in Winter Soldier), but I didn't enjoy the couple of Spider Man movies I have seen, nor have I watched any of the Batman movies since the ""original"" one with Michael Keaton. I don't do horror or rated R movies and I love a good romantic comedy. If you can relate to most of that, I would think you'd enjoy Prince of Persia.",1442966400,,1126,4.3875598086124405

I wondered if the odd parallels to the United State's 2003 invasion of Iraq were intentional or accidental.  The excuse to invade Alamut was their production of weapons and ties to terrorist organizations; which later proved to be non-existent.,1438819200,,401,5.317460317460317

4126693,4,B003IHUI0O,"Somewhere on my computer, I still have the original Prince of Persia game.  While I haven't gotten into the many other games in the franchise, I did get a kick out of it.  So naturally, I paid attention when they announced Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time.  I never did make it to see this one in theaters, but I recently rented and enjoyed it.

Dastan (Jake Gyllenhaal) was a poor orphan in ancient Persia until he was adopted by King Sharaman (Ronald Pickup).  Raised with the other princes, he comes to love his new family dearly.

When the holy city of Alamut begins selling weapons to the enemy, Dastan and his brothers feel they have no choice but to invade the city.  Even after taking Princess Tamina (Gemma Arterton) hostage, they can find no evidence of those weapons.

Tamina is obsessed with a dagger that Dastan has taken as a spoil of war.  When Dastan is suddenly accused of murder, the two must flee for their lives.  What secret does that dagger hold?  Will Dastan clear his name?

Make no mistake about it, this movie has summer block buster written all over it.  There are big action scenes and plenty of special effects.  At times those did overshadow things, especially in the beginning when I found myself a couple of steps behind the characters.  By the end, I was following everything just fine.

Unfortunately, the story is predictable.  A few things kept me in suspense throughout the movie, but I predicted most of the twists before they happened.  But this isn't a movie that's trying to break new ground.  It just wants to have fun, and in that it succeeds in spades.

I thought the special effects were quite good.  I believed everything I saw, and they never pulled me out of the film.  Likewise, the acting was great.  The actors played it mostly straight, which made me really care for the main characters.  And the sword battles were lots of fun.

Even the first incarnation of the game involved jumping on pegs and ledges over the ground.  I had to smile at how they worked this into the movie.  Fans of the games won't be disappointed.

My biggest irritant was the poorly timed kiss.  What do I mean?  As the movie progresses, Dastan and Tamina start to fall for each other (no surprise there).  But they chose the worst possible times to start to move in for a kiss, leading to further plot complications.  Not only was I yelling at the screen, but I was also rolling my eyes that they would really risk everything they were working toward to kiss right then.

Complaint aside, I still enjoyed Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time.  This isn't great cinema, but it is perfect for a couple of mindless hours.",1431648000,,2646,4.536016949152542

Basically, Prince Dustan is born a street urchin, inadvertently shows courage and honor in front of the King, who takes him to live with his family at the palace.

He grows up with the King's sons... present day arrives, they sneak into a close kingdom, and it starts the adventure pertaining to the Princess of that kingdom and the dagger that hold the Sands of Time...

Some great and all time favorite actors brought to their knees by mono-dimensional, stereotypical roles, a cheesy screenplay, and poorly executed effects.  I'm at a loss as to why the film had to be shot with the American actors doing lame British accents...just another of the things that lulled me to sleep as I struggled to get through - hoping something might redeem it, but alas.  How I wish someone would have taken the magic dagger....gone back in time and persuaded the producers to shelve this dreadful project.

4126946,4,B003IHUI0O,"This fantasy adventure film was made for pure entertainment and it fills this role pretty nicely. Not a masterpiece but a nice watch. Below, some more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

As the title indicates this film was inspired by the old computer game ""Prince of Persia"", of which it keeps the premise (Thousand and One Nights-like lands), the main hero Dastan, who actually is kind of a prince of Persia (even if he was adopted, not born in royalty) and the swashbuckling and acrobatic character of story. Jake Gyllenhaal is maybe not exactly the kind of actor I would immediately associate with adventure/action films but in this one he proves that with enough makeup, CGIs and the help of a battalion of stuntsmen anybody can be a hero... Which is kind of a heartening message... Also, as dialogs in this film are not half bad, the actor playing the heroic prince can actually do here some occasional acting, between two acrobacies covered by his stuntsmen.

All those who enjoyed the three old ""Sinbad"" films will most probably like this film too. As always in this kind of movies there must also be an evil guy and here this role is played by no other than Sir Ben Kingsley - who is really a pleasure to watch.

Also, there must be a chick in slave's outfit and lo and behold, there is one and a very pleasant sight she is, as it is Gemma Arterton who plays here. Her character, Tamina, has the necessary shapes and also quite a mouth, which she doesn't hesitate to put to good use once she meets the prince - for dialogs, of course... Because, you know, dialogs are good... And ever since Leia all princesses need to have a mouth which they put to good use once they meet an attractive guy - for dialogs, of course... Because, you know, dialogs are good... OK, I stop here.

The film is visually quite pleasant and this is why I bought it on Blu-ray (it was actually the first Blu-ray I ever bought) and it was rather a good decision.

Bottom line, this is a film made for pure entertainment and quite good for this kind of film, with some good action, good effects, some nice verbal sniping between the two main characters and an obligatory happy ending, complete with the obligatory betrothal and the promise of glorious bedding - I mean wedding... Enjoy!",1386720000,,2281,4.553658536585366

If you missed it in the theatre I'm happy to recommend this Blu-ray: it has minimal extras (the 16 minute making of is moderately interesting and worth watching) but is a nice transfer with a decent menu.",1385683200,,424,4.4935064935064934
4126953,3,B003IHUI0O,"Before seeing PRINCE OF PERSIA: THE SANDS OF TIME for the first time, I was already somewhat familiar with the general premise of the story because I had played a couple of video games the movie is based upon. The movie follows prince Dastan (Jake Gyllenhall), the adopted son of King Sharaman (Ronald Pickup). In the aftermath of the invasion of an enemy city, Dastan takes a strange dagger filled with sand as spoils of the war and the citys princess Tamina (Gemma Arterton) is captured. Shortly after, Sharaman is murdered and Dastan is framed for the crime by his uncle Nizam (Ben Kengsley). Dastan soon discovers that the sands in dagger allow the user to turn back time for a minute while retaining the knowledge of what happens. Dastan soon discovers his uncles plot to kill him. Dastan flees the city with the princess Tamina. Tamina tells Dastan of the daggers origins and explains what must happen to it to prevent the destruction of the world.

In terms of fantasy-action movies, PRINCE OF PERSIA: THE SANDS OF TIME really isn't all that bad. The exposition of the dagger is a bit difficult to follow at times, but beyond that the story is a pretty straight-forward fantasy-action movie. Theres lots of action, some lovable characters, and the typical romance. Alfred Molina has a small bit part in the film, but is one of the more memorable characters. Ben Kingsley is always fun to watch and I think hes even better playing villains and anti-heroes than he is at everymen and heroes. Gemma Arterton is beautiful and does a decent job of bringing a little bit of spark to a role that is basically written as nothing more than eye candy. As Dastan, Gyllenhall does a good job and is fairly entertaining to watch. Ive never been a Gyllenhall fan, but I actually didn't mind that he was the hero in this movie.

Although it didn't do very well at the domestic box office, the movie did fairly well worldwide and is currently (as of 11/28/13) the highest grossing movie ever based upon a video game. Overall, although there isn't a lot that is really memorable about the movie, PRINCE OF PERSIA: THE SANDS OF TIME is a fun flick to watch.  You might not watch it again and again, but you probably won't regret having watched it the first time.",1385596800,,2251,4.6225

I think Gyllenhaal does a great job and there is chemistry between the two main characters.  Ben Kingsley is a great villain and the Hassanssins are a great too.,1383436800,,359,4.25
4126963,5,B003IHUI0O,These type of movies depicting ancient times are some of my favourites. The story line appears original (not withstanding the cartoon version that I am not familiar with)  and the acting by all cast was fantastic. Jack and Gamma were exceptional in their acting. What I enjoyed more was the shooting of the film-believable in all instances. The film itself is a feel good movie who's actions you can watch over and over. As I said for me it's more of the acting than the message of the movie or story line. I did enjoy it.,1382745600,,522,4.4375
4126964,5,B003IHUI0O,"I'm not sure where the heads are at of the reviewers who panned this movie, but they might want to take into account that this was a Fantasy Movie based on a Video Game. Sure there are historical inaccuracies and fantastical scenes, but that's the point.

For me it was pure fun and I have re-watched the movie several times, and not just for the pure beauty of Gemma Arterton, In fact, my favorite performance is by Alfred Molina, who never disappoints me and comes through in spades this time as a 'slightly dishonorable entrepreneur'. He's just pure gold and a joy to watch.

The action and the fighting is quick moving and never overdone. That can be a fine line to manage. Gyllenhall really makes a fun Dastan. He keep the dialogue fun with great physical acting- his expressions remind that this could have been done as an animation- and a wonderful friction-filled chemistry between his character and that of Gemma Arterton, the Princess Tamina. I've read in other reviews that they thought her acting stiff, but I think they have confused her playing a stiff character with her acting because she comes across as a spoiled princess who has yet to come out her shell. Her physical acting is wonderful as well if you watch closely. Her expressions at times can be priceless and when it comes time to express vulnerability she comes through quite well.

All in all it's rally just a fun romp through a fairy tale, one that could have been done as a Disney animation, but the decision to make it live action was the right one. The rest of the supporting cast holds their own well, though most of the movie focuses on Dastan and Tamina. The physical stunts are really cool and even better when you realize that Gyllenhall did quite a bit of it himself.

Well done, Highly recommended for at least one watch, but you should go through more than once because you will miss some fun things.",1382486400,,1890,4.5828402366863905

The acting was more than adequate, the stakes were good, the story logic was sound... I mean for the movie you expect to see, you get it in spades. It's fun, twisty, great effects, great villain, on and on.

So why not 5-stars?

Hmmm... I think because it's TOO on target. It's predictable in that you know the hero will not fail. The main character starts brazen and ends brazen, he starts heroic and ends heroic... but then if it had that level of character development it would've been up for an Oscar.  haha

I saw it available on Amazon for a super cheap price, and took a chance. It paid off, cuz i would've paid a few bucks more for this and would've been satisfied. The story of a street rat that's taken in by the king and raised as one of his three sons Jake Gyllenhaal's character (can't remember his name) is framed for his adopted fathers murder, and must find out who is responsible before his brothers catch him, and put him to death. The action is good, Love Gemma Arterton as the Princess trying to flee from Gyllenhaal half the movie.

4127064,2,B003IHUI0O,"I had already seen Prince of Persia before buying the blu-ray/DVD/Digital version through a 3rd party Amazon seller. The movie appealed to me enough that I (a recovering pack-rat and gadget/media hoarder) wanted a copy. Item was delivered early and exactly in the condition as described, so I have no issues with the seller I got the movie from.

What really disappointed me was after I opened the item packaging and tried out the blu-ray and digital discs. I can't get the digital copy to work. Blu-ray disc seems to have a poor quality play-back, not like other blu-ray discs I have viewed.

The digital discs comes with a Disney Digital activation code that can only be used once. Fine, I figured, and ran the auto-play feature to use that code so I could copy a digital file to my computer. You get a choice of either transferring via iTunes or Windows Media Player (not both). Chose the Windows Media Player (WMP) option, it prompted me to update my WMP security, so fine, I did that with no problems. After the disc tells me transfer is complete, I go to my folder and try to run the movie file with WMP and it gives me an error. Tried several times.

Emailed Disney Digital support, and they came back with a reply to go ask my audio or video card manufacturer instead.

Long story short, I would have never bought this 3-disc edition if I had known the digital copy doesn't work. I would have been happy owning a digital copy through VUDU or something.

I will update if I ever get the digital copy working. Otherwise, do not buy this 3-disc version.",1357689600,2,1558,4.51063829787234

4127094,3,B003IHUI0O,"Never have I experienced the dichotomy of disinterest and appreciation as I did watching Prince of Persia.

A Persian King adopts a white kid to be a Prince, but little does the King know the boy will grow to be a sand-surfing, parkour extremist intent on seamlessly blending what feels like a sword and sandal version of producer Jerry Bruckheimer's Pirates of the Caribbean films mixed with a recycled Mummy sequel.  It's FX heavy with a ton of action, a heavy dose of predictability, a few slick escapes, and a whole lot of storyline involving a magical dagger.

Gemma Arterton overspeaks all her lines, like she's lip-synching a music video.  Easy on the eyes though.  Aside from his epic tan, Ben Kingsley phones in a foreshadowed villainous performance.  Believe it or not, Jake Gyllenhaal ends up being the most competent and energetic actor in the entire film.  As far as chemistry between Arterton and Jake Gyllenhaal, let's just say her performance was so wooden Jake earned the nickname Geppetto Gyllenhaal from me.

Watch this film one time for the cinematography, the scenery, and the fun.  Watch it twice if you're a Gyllenhaal fan.",1340928000,,1146,4.896373056994818

4127097,4,B003IHUI0O,"I'm not sure why this film was so vilified. If you recognize that it's a Disney movie and a sand and sandal fantasy, you pretty much know what to expect. It's not hugely different from the Mummy films in disregard for historic or cultural accuracy, is just as humorous and anachronistic and even more opulent and visually gorgeous. Maybe it needed to also be a monster film to be accepted? For whatever reason it was hated, I have to say that it's really quite enjoyable on the terms in which it was intended: a modern version of the sort of Sindbad/Sabu movies from the 60s and 70s. Jake Gyllenhaal is so likeable as an actor that his thief-turned-prince is engaging regardless of setting. Gemma Arerton's character is initially as stiff as a board, then a stereotypic haughty priestess and most of the time the actress doesn't rise above the script but she does occasionally make a good impression. She has reasonable chemistry with Gyllenhaal and the banter between the two works just fine in service to the story. The time-slip gimmick, I presume from the video games which I admit I have never played, is interesting and well explored and the entire plot moves along smoothly and ties up well. It's a hundred times better than, say Scorpion King, no more fantastic than any other crazy artifact film (Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull for instance), and it moves through the paces deftly without falling apart or losing track of the story it wants to tell. Supporting cast are excellent.
So. Gone into with the correct expectations, there's really nothing wrong with this film. It's all about updating Sinbad for the new generation and anyone who's seen those movies knows it's not about realistic situations and Academy Award level acting. It's a big shiny bauble of a story that sounds like Aladdin and looks like a theme park's version of royal Morocco.",1338681600,,1863,4.788819875776397

4127100,3,B003IHUI0O,"Jake Gyllenhaal gets all hunky in this fantasy fairytale from the Disney people.  I was expecting less quite frankly.  With Jerry Bruckheimer producing however, we get an expansive CGI-laden adventure that is quite entertaining.  With a film like this, one must toss out realism obviously, yet we should expect a coherent story and good writing.  For the most part we get it.  Still the best thing here is Alfred Molina as a tax avoiding sheik hustling his way through ancient Persia.  He also has all the lines referencing today's society.  Throw in the drop-dead gorgeous Gemma Arterton and you have a nice piece of action fluff.

The 1080p Blu ray transfer has a 2.40:1 aspect ratio and is stunning from beginning to end.  Great colors and clarity.

4127102,4,B003IHUI0O,"There's nothing I love more than a big-budget blockbuster. I did not go in expecting much and when I came out, had decided Prince of Persia is worthy of the legacy Disney's last epic-scale franchise, Pirates of the Caribbean, left behind.

Orphaned and left to fend for himself, young Dastan never realized when he risked his life for another child that he would draw the attention of royalty, but when King Sharaman witnesses the boy's courage and fortitude, it is decided that Dastan will be raised as his own along with his sons. Fifteen years later, the royal princes are formidable in warfare and fond of one another. The eldest (Richard Coyle) is in training to become the future king of Persia, while his dutiful uncle Nizam (Ben Kingsley) guides his responses and assists him in making wise decisions. When it becomes known that one of their holy cities is supplying their enemies with weapons, it is decided that the city must be taken by force -- a feat that proves successful but not without cost. In defeating an adversary, Dastan (Jake Gyllenhaal) comes into possession of a fine dagger with a glass hilt. What he does not realize is this special dagger will give him the power to turn back time... and that it is worth killing for.

One of the guardians of the magical dagger is Princess Tamina (Gemma Arterton), who becomes a fugitive along with Dastan when something unthinkable happens. Soon they are running from their lives with a ransom on their heads -- and the full force of the dagger has yet to be revealed. While this script is inspired by a popular video game, and the movie does play homage to the game in various fun and smart ways, it can stand alone as a decent piece of cinematic material. Most adaptations cannot claim that much -- this has a first-rate plot, some fun twists and turns, and enough adventure to satisfy even the most ADD audience. I can count on one hand the number of times an audience has applauded at the end of a film, and this is one of them. It's a romantic, dangerous, mystical adventure into a fantasy version of history, complete with gorgeous costumes and a solid cast. Gyllenhaal and Arterton have great chemistry and their romance does not feel rushed or forced, since it starts off on the wrong foot, continues into constant arguments, and then at the end begins to soften.

Many of the escape methods and fighting techniques are straight out of the game -- leaping rooftops, sliding around on ropes, dangling from wooden pegs halfway up sheer walls, climbing with the assistance of arrows embedded into stone. There are a few modern jokes thrown in for the audience's enjoyment (one man Dastan runs into evades Persian taxes by spreading lies about the notorious thieves in a particular valley, whereas there is nothing more terrifying than ostrich races going on) and problematic material is kept to a minimum. If you're fond of the fantasy genre or were not concerned with the supernatural aspect in the Pirates films, this is no more pervasive and in some ways, less sinister since it doesn't involve the walking dead. It surprised me with the fact that it was simply fun to watch -- it doesn't require much emotional involvement but still manages to include a few wonderful moments and they were careful to keep the action scenes from becoming too repetitive. Overall, it's one of the more enjoyable experiences I have had in the cinema.",1332892800,2,3403,4.725589225589226

I'm a big fan of the game it's based on, and even though it's only minimally accurate, I can at least understand the changes they made (although I don't think it would have killed them to at least call the princess ""Farah"" and put her city in India).

4127109,2,B003IHUI0O,"If you're in the mood for non-stop action and adventure and little in the way of character development and plot, then this is your movie.
Now, giving credit where it's due, they did try to make a sensible and well-developed film. The characters had interesting stories and the actors did well, but it just didn't come together in the end.
The film follows an adopted prince of Persia as he and his brothers conquer a holy city and take possession of a magical, time-altering dagger. After being blamed for the murder of his stepfather, the prince must discover the true murderer before his angered brothers have him killed.
Being that this movie was based off of a video game and that the script for the film was conceived by the video game-series writer, it played out very much like a video game would. There are some cheesy lines, some obvious statements and redundancies, and it all went on a little longer than it should. The point of the film (as was with the games) was to be drawn in to the action and see some pretty cool things while doing it. The action scenes were well played and enjoyable to watch, and the special effects were stunning. You can tell that this film had a lot of the crew from the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise; it just had such a similar feeling to it.
Now, let us jump deeper into the technicalities of the film. Number one, Jake Gyllenhaal. The guy is a good actor, no fight there. But he is not an action star, nor is he a convincing Persian prince. He just does not look the part. While he did a decent job, I just think it was a poor casting decision. I had a hard time watching him play a part that just was not him. Number two, the princess was a bit of an annoyance. Yes, I understand that if you pull someone out of their environment and place them in an opposite one, they will react in an odd and uncharacteristic way. But, being that this princess supposedly was wise beyond her years and lived through some very enlightening and mind-boggling moments in her young life, you think that she would have kept her head on a little straighter when she left her kingdom. She traversed between a winy little girl and a teenager attempting to be smart a little too often and it was unconvincing and annoying. You expected more from her; or at least hoped for more. And maybe it was just me, but did any one else see Sheik Amar as a Jack Sparrow rip-off? Just me?
The ending was interesting, somewhat bold, but interesting. That's all I'll say there. But overall, the movie was fun too watch - a little too long - but entertaining to say the least.

4127110,5,B003IHUI0O,"I really enjoy these types of movies. At their heart movies such as Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time are supposed to be fun and adventure filled escapist entertainment. This is where the movie succeeds. First of all the movie is a visual palette of wondrous colors, scenery, architecture, costumes and characters that transports the viewer to another place and time. Secondly the story has all the right elements from heroism, bravery, treachery, betrayal, familial love and loyalty along with romance and laughter. Thirdly the story is epic in scope but intimate in its execution.

Based on a video game, which I have never seen, the story follows the adventure of Dastan a Prince of Persia, splendidly portrayed by Jake Gyllenhaal, who had been adopted by the king as a peasant living in poverty on the streets. Raised along with his adopted brothers Dastan leads his brothers and their armies to capture the city of Alamut where he meets the city's beautiful princess Tamina,  portrayed by the enchanting and stunning, Gemma Arterton, and he comes in possession of a mysterious dagger with time traveling abilities. That is the gist of the story and I will not go into great detail on the finer points of the story.

The movie is a fantasy and it is fun and enjoyable. If you enjoy fun, adventure filled fantasy epics the Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time is a great popcorn munching movie to escape into for a while. It will be time well spent.",1326240000,,1453,4.735177865612648

4127113,2,B003IHUI0O,"While I was watching Newell's Persia, the only thing that constantly reminded me of this film's video game roots actually had nothing to do with the aesthetics themselves.

More on that later.  It needs to be declared, however, that Newell is quite possibly the first director to ""trick"" an ignorant audience out of playing their hand and avoiding video game adaptions like it had the word ""Bubonic"" in its title.  I mean, my grandparents were anticipating this movie.  This simply could not be echoed for previous entries into this misguided and struggling genre.  That's the power of Bruckheimer and Disney at it's finest, folks.

But, is it really a turnaround that will pave the way for future video games to hit the big screen?  Again, it needs to be reiterated that this feels nothing like its source material, and that wasn't a mistake, I assure you.  Basically, Disney has been the one to step up to the plate and crush the hearts of purists by using their actions to say, ""this movie is owes itself to a game, but damned if we'll tell the rest of the world if we want it to make money.""  And, if first-day results are of any indication (and they always are with the producers), it worked.

It's just too bad that they couldn't make it any better than its predecessors.  The prince fails just about as painfully as any other video game adaptation, but for very different reasons.  The production values are there, more than ever.  The talent is there, and they work with it.  The action is there, and that was never really an issue to begin with?  So, what's the problem?  What isn't there?  Well, everything else, essentially.

The Persia franchise was never really much for a story.  Rather, it instead took the hearts of high-brow critics (who know, those looking for a story in video games) by having a terrific script and committed voice actors.  That stands as something genuinely unique and bullet-worthy for a game.  In a movie, they're generally prerequisites.  Alas, that's not to say that this movie even HAS a decent script, because it really doesn't, and that comes through with an editing process that goes all kinds of tweako.  Those who have kept up with me will know of my affection for a movie with a good rhythm; a good PACE.  Persia has about as much rhythm as an individual has intelligence for believing that airplanes in the night sky are shooting stars.

Its erratic formula pushes the audience further and further away, leaving us so flabbergasted midway through that the action sequences are a welcome brain funk.  Speaking of which, they also suffer from an over-enthusiastic party of editors, but it's ultimately offset by the enjoyable tug-o-war between a set of protagonists and antagonists that mesh well together.  The Hassansins, a bit like pseduo desert nazgul, are especially enjoyable to watch.

Unfortunately, they can't stay on the screen forever, and as far as chemistry goes, that which lies between Dastan (Gyllenhaal) and Tamina (the increasingly more beautiful Arterton) is about as consistent as....well, the editing (that's the last time I'll bring it up).  The movie itself is in dire need of a standout peformance; Molina was obviously designed to be the crowd pleaser, and he undoubtedly has his moments but, really, no one takes center stage, and it's a problem.

So, no, Disney has not yet discovered the formula for creating a cash cow out of a video game adaptation.  They've simply sidestepped all of it and a movie that is, in its own right, not very good and, from a gamer's standpoint, still not very good.  I can see future articles claiming that this will be seen as a stepping stone towards an revolution in the sub-genre, but don't be fooled and, honestly, I'd settle with advising that you not go see this movie, aside from proving the theory that Arterton seemingly gets more attractive as the months roll by.",1324166400,,3879,4.786466165413533

It's rare to find a movie these days with such a well-constructed story.  I'm impressed with the balance between plot development and relationship development.  The movie is also really satisfying in that the villain is so formidable.  Many stories' villains have evident weaknesses, even comical elements, but Prince of Persia's is really severe.  It also succeeds at originality, avoiding cliches and imitations of other adventure stories.  And it has enjoyable, clever banter between Prince Dastan (the main character) and Princess Tamina.  The violence depicted is not graphic or gratuitous, which I appreciate.  It is the suddenness and unexpectedness of the violence, rather than gore, which give it its power.  I only have one criticism for this movie, which is that the action sequences are edited with so many super-fast changes of shots/angles that the sequences can be hard to follow.",1324080000,2,1051,5.432098765432099

It was horrible.

I get the plot, I get the storyline. And honestly, if this movie was called anything else BUT the Prince of Persia, I would have enjoyed it!

But...something about a bunch of white guys speaking in a British accent running around in the Middle East pretending to be Persians?? I just couldn't wrap my brain around it.
Yes, that was my biggest issue with this movie (despite the fact that this movie was based from a video game---and not even the original game at that but the more recent version for Xbox which also wasn't that great of a game to begin with): it seemed that Hollywood didn't even really put much effort into convincing me of their characters. I didn't feel that special magical pull I got when playing the playstation 2 version of Prince of Persia. It lacked the sarcasm and the plot twists and the true story line.

With all that said, I still stand by my argument that if they were to make a movie played by the Japanese who would speak in a German accent playing the role of a group of Native American people who live in Canada, a lot of viewers would be annoyed by that.

Again, if this movie was titled anything else but The Prince of Persia, I would have enjoyed it a bit more. It's hard to watch a movie about your own people and enjoy it when it has been completely exploited in the matter that it was.

4127125,4,B003IHUI0O,"Our video came with a warning that it was for 12+, and I strongly agree and caution parents. While this is a Disney product, it is NOT as light hearted or cartoonish as the Pirates of the Caribbean series. The violence and Foley effects (sound effects) of squishy stabbings are a bit too gruesome.

The plot centers around three brothers, sons of a King of an ancient Persian Empire, who uncover sedition on their boarders, and invade a Holy City, which enrages their father the King. One son is the first-born heir, the other a military general, and the third a loveable rogue, who was adopted by the king for an act of bravery in his adolescence.

The Holy city holds a mysterious secret, and a beautiful girl who guards it, and provides a wonderful McGuffin of button-button-who's-got-the button for the rest of the romp.

The acting is fine, and there are characters by the dozens. Lots of elements are heavily borrowed from Raiders of the Lost Ark, and similar action adventure stories, but the plot never drags and the hero and heroine have an amusing friction as they fall in love through their trials.

Sadly, Ben Kingsley's make-up makes him look odd, but it was delightful to see him and he does his usual excellent job. Jake shares his chiseled good looks and apparently does a lot of his own stunts, it was only afterwards that I learned the film is a derivative of a video game, but many of the intricate acrobatics make sense once you learn this.

The movie is quite long, but doesn't really flag. Our 12-year-old daughter and my wife both enjoyed it, although you would have guesssed the film was pitched for teenage boys.

Once again, be very cautious on the violence, this is not for the eyes of those in their tender years.

Final word, we are a very conservative traditional Catholic family, so we are cautious about movies with to much ""magic"" in them and distortions of the supernatural. While there is a strong element essential to the plot that involves ""the [g]ods"" within the context of the film it makes sense and while I did discuss these elements with my children, they had the good sense to recognize the difference between the film's structure of fantasy and reality. But not every parent, particularly conservative Christian parents increasingly concerned about our continually coarsening world where the demonic is accepted as normal, would come to the same conclusion.

4127127,1,B003IHUI0O,"As a huge fan of the Prince of Persia video game series and Jake Gyllenhaal, of course I watched this film.  Although I can't fault the film for its great visuals, what makes this flick truly abysmal is the fact that no attention was paid to plot or logic at all.  I'm willing to suspend disbelief for a good romp at the movies, but there's a fine line between suspension of disbelief and nonsensical writing.

The movie jumps around erratically and makes no explanations for the gaping holes that emerge in the plot.  I'll give you a perfect (non-spoiler) example.  Jake Gyllenhaal's Dastan is on the lam after being accused of being responsible for his father's demise.  The whole kingdom is looking for him, so of course he heads back to the kingdom where many other kingdoms are gathering for the king's memorial.  A funeral procession is marching down the street.  We see Dastan traipsing across the tops of buildings and down through alleyways, completely unnoticed.  Okay, that's fine.  The games were filled with such feats of stealth.

But after a quick cut, Dastan is suddenly kneeling over his father's casket and paying homage.  I should point out here that his father's casket is in a canopy that is being carried down a busy street as the focus of a procession that includes foreign dignitaries, royal court, guards, and so on all walking nearby.  His father's brother/advisor is walking next to the casket.  Dastan spends a moment or two speaking to his father's remains then flees the canopy.

Yes.  That means that Dastan was able to slip past an entire crowd of people standing at the side of the road, slink unseen into the canopy his father was being carried in, the men carrying the canopy didn't notice the shift in weight at all, Dastan isn't heard through the canopy only inches from his uncle's ears, he then exits the canopy and leaves back through the crowd with nary a dignitary or onlooker spotting him.  Oh...and he also slipped a note into his uncle's pocket through the canopy's gaping flap without notice.

I wish I could say that this was the only moment in the film that made little to no sense.  The special effects are stunning but without a story (or at least a vague semblance of continuity) to ground them, they're nothing more than pretty lights and sounds.

I know some people enjoy movies like this.  They like watching the great fight sequences with their stunning choreography and CG effects.  If you prefer your films driven primarily by the effects department, then you can ignore my review and you'll probably enjoy this film.  But if you like a good story that you can follow and that doesn't leave you wondering if the director actually read the script before shooting, then I'm willing to bet you will be less than enthused about this shamble of a pseudo-adaptation.",1306800000,6,2817,4.727459016393443

I found it humorous that Ben Kingsley appropriately played a homage to Torin Thatcher who played the sorcerer in another Harryhausen classic 'The 7th Voyage of Sinbad' and the inspired rip off 'Jack the Giant Killer'.

Jake Gyllenhaal aptly plays the hero and all supporting characters fit as well including a colorful role for Alfred Molina.

Alamut was not a city; in reality it was a castle. There is also a lot of mixing up Persian; Arab; Turk and anything else that comes along. I am not sure what period this is supposed to have been. Some of the names like Dastan and Tamina are very ancient Persian names. Nazeen on the other hand is an Arabic name which would not have been used prior to the 6th century. The flags are interesting. My daughter noted that several of them appeared to be ""Darafsheh Kaviani"" the ancient Persian flag.

Anyway if you are willing to overlook such minor issues it is a lot of fun! There is action (not my biggest thing); love; hate; treachery; magic: what else do you want :-)

4127138,5,B003IHUI0O,"As a personal rule of thumb, I tend to stay away from any movies (cartoons excluded) made by Disney. Or any movies based on computer games.

Why?

From experience, they tend to be very disappointing and boring. They tend to be ""dumbed down"" versions of real life situations.

However, I'm glad to be proven wrong this time where Prince of Persia is concerned.
It is a very entertaining movie and my entire family enjoyed watching it from beginning to end.

The special effects are also wonderful, e.g. when the magical dagger is activated, it seems very realistic and is comparable to the ""Back to the future"" series where time travel is concerned.
Just think of this as a medieval version of time travel.
Another example of wonderful special effects is the view of the holy city. It was so wonderfully and realistically rendered in BLu-Ray that one of my family members actually thought that such a city existed in real life!

Storywise, I'll refrain from any spoilers.

Suffice to say that this is one of those ""the butler did it"" kind of movie. I kinda guessed who the ""bad guy"" would be the moment he first appeared in the movie, just like in ""Angels and Demons"". ;)

The casting director did a good job here as all the actors and actresses had a perfect fit for all their respective roles. None of the actors/actresses ever appeared to be out of place in their roles.

There are also sufficient twists and turns (both literally and figuratively) in the storyline and plenty of action to keep you and your family glued to your seats for the entire movie.

4127140,2,B003IHUI0O,"A few years back I may have enjoyed a movie like ""Prince of Persia,"" marveling at the gimmicky special effects and cheap set designs because I did not know any better. However, being more learned in film after taking a few film courses in my university while also taking the time to watch movies that are actually worth a damn, I realize how shallow movies like Prince of Persia really are, not-to-mention how daft many movie producers and filmmakers think audiences are for making this rubbish. The director, Mike Newell, firstly, was not the right man to take on this project. He is a skilled director in his element, which is comedy and drama, but he fails to deliver smart action films. I, personally, am a huge fan of the Harry Potter franchise, and I felt his adaptation of Goblet of Fire was the biggest disappointment in the series, and not because the film failed to entertain me, but because the director was most concerned with making a gimmicky action flick than paying respect to an immensely character-driven and dense story. He does the same with this film. Although I've never played the game, I've seen enough of it to know that it could have inspired one heck of a great film. If a director like Ridley Scott or even Ron Howard would have signed on, you know you would have been seeing one very substantial action film. However, what Mike Newell presents us with here is a splotchy, choppy, and claustrophobic mess that lacks a set continuity and that drags when it has the opportunity to soar. I would have presented the same argument for other Disney live-action films like the Pirates of the Caribbean movies, but those movies at least had some very interesting set pieces and very authentic character presentation and development. For one thing, the actors in Pirates were at the top of their game, and they were not as implausible as Jake Gyllenhal's Prince. Another thing about Pirates is its production values. Observe how well Gore Verbinski chooses to shoot his scenes, presenting vast oceanic landscapes in all of their mysterious glory and showing Pirates in all of their swashbuckling and teeth-rotting splendor. Their costumes were weathered and soiled with age, as if those pirates have never had time for a bath, let alone a place to wash their clothes. Now, going back to Prince of Persia, you visualize characters with perfect teeth as if the ancient persian empire had a means of acquiring  good dental hygienists and some very good laundromats. Even brainless blockbusters should strive for authenticity, especially when the film took two years to make.

One other complaint of mine was the cheesy and cramped cinematography. Rarely was there a scene that visually immersed me, since the camera-work was too abrupt and seemed digitally revamped. Movies like this, that attempt to work at an epic scale (""attempt""), should have cinematography that suits its purpose. Movies like the latest Robin Hood and Lord of the Rings come to mind. Many of the frames and overall scenes in those two films are vast, allowing the audience to take in the atmosphere and the setting. Prince of Persia doesn't allow its audience to do that; it was a very limiting visual experience.

Overall, I did not find much to like in this film. I don't think director Mike Newell has formed an aptitude for making substantial action flicks. He lacks a certain humane sensitivity that he somehow does not lack in his dramatic films. Maybe he should retrace his steps and create a story that pays homage to what he was originally good at. If he can mix strong character development with an artistic eye, he will be able to create one very good action movie; but, until then, he hasn't made the cut in my eyes.

If you're in the mood for some brainless action that provides some fun (although very far between), then you might find something to like in Prince of Persia. However, if you're someone like me who lately has an appetite for well-made films in general, those films that do not sacrifice one essential element of the story to focus on another, less valuable one, will be very disappointed, because although the film does provide some cheap thrills, it does not maintain that element which will allow it to pass the test of time; therefore, it serves no other purpose than to make money for its studio. Other directors could have done better and have done better. Even Pirates of the Caribbean, which I have aforementioned, is more of a visual and intellectual delight (and I'm sure both sets of movies will be compared when they should not) than Prince of Persia.

Plus all the side characters that seemed jammed together incoherently in the beginning eventually made sense once we discovered more about them.  At first I was afraid this wouldn't be the case and that I'd be spending all my time trying to figure out who's who.

The storyline is pretty simple- a magical dagger has some time travelling abilities.  That's basically all there is to it.  Of course such a special weapon needs constant protection, which is how the adventure gets underway.

Many of the action scenes are quite a spectacle to watch, such as one specific scene near the end where waves of sand appeared to be flowing downward all the way to a black hole, and the princess and prince had to grab ahold of something in order to save their lives.  It kind of messed with my head a little bit watching the whole event take place, and I mean that in a totally positive way- very unique special effects.

There's also some fairly entertaining humor with ostrichs, snakes and chickens that come into play.  Mostly however, the storyline focuses on constant sword fighting.  It's a bit much, and I'm tempted to take away one star exactly because of the overabundance of it, but I won't.

Overall, a nice piece of family entertainment.",1297468800,,1559,4.6911764705882355
4127146,4,B003IHUI0O,"This is another in the recent phenomenon of video games brought to life on the big screen. In most respects the translation is successful. The action sequences are top notch and the cinematography is gorgeous. Ben Kingsley makes a wonderful villain and Gemma Arterton is well cast as the strong willed and capable princess.

However, the film has a number of flaws which drop it into the four star category. Jake Gyllenhall seems miscast as a prince here. He just doesn't look the part; he's more of an unkempt bad boy than a prince. He lacks the polish and nobility one usually associates with the hero of the Prince of Persia video games. I realize that a street smart brawler is what the screenplay was going for but it just didn't work for me.

There are also annoying anachronisms. The Alfred Molina character was the worst offense; he sounded far too contemporary and takes one out of the fantasy world the film is trying to build up. Also, it is not clear exactly what Persia we're supposed to be seeing here. The Persian Empire of 2500 years ago? Persia of the Caliphate period? Both are hinted at. Or more likely, a Persia that never was?

Worse by far is the plot. It involves a ""do over"" device - a dagger that can turn back time. This is more of a science fiction than fantasy element and completely robs the story of any suspense. Normally time travel stories get around this by emphasizing the clever uses of the paradoxes involved but there is little of that here. Only the scene where the prince deliberately kills himself to desperately make a point seems particularly well thought out.

Summing up, this is an entertaining film but not a five star one.",1296604800,2,1670,4.593959731543624
4127147,5,B003IHUI0O,"It's only natural for many of us to hear about this movie, and stay away from it: after all, it's a movie based off of a video game. How good could it be? Answer: very good. Surprisingly, this movie's a lot of fun, despite the many fight scenes. Jake Gyllenhaal turns Dastan, the main character, into someone you want to root for. He may get on your nerves sometimes, but all in all, Dastan is someone you want to win in the end.
The storyline--while somewhat confusing the first time I saw this movie--makes more sense the second time around. It is a rather silly storyline, but generally well put together.

4127158,3,B003IHUI0O,"`Prince of Persia' is one of those films that seems like it should be really good, but after viewing it leaves you feeling rather deflated and disappointed. Most elements seem to be there, stunning set pieces, a reasonable story premise (although the plot execution let it down), beautiful costumes, impressive parkour style stunts and big budget effects and yet it gets sorely let down in other areas. The story gets so ridiculous in places that it is a film you need to suspend disbelief to truly enjoy it and the acting is pretty wooden from all involved. This is especially disappointing from Gyllenhaal who has acted well in past films and from Molina who acts like a character from Pirates of the Caribbean, with the most ludicrous accent for a man who lives in the middle east (it's more east end!). Towards the end this turns into a weak Indiana Jones wannabe, with a temple of doom and booby traps, but it can never compete. There is also meant to be a romance between Gyllenhaal and Arterton but rarely have I seen such a lack of chemistry between two actors. These aspects, along with the poor plot execution make this a chore to watch and hard to fully enjoy. It is one of those films you will have been glad to have not wasted money on seeing at the cinema and it is only worth buying if you can pick it up very cheap. You will watch it once and probably never again. Shame, it could have delivered so much more.

1. Two brothers are songs of the king. One of them is a son-by-blood and the other is a son-by-adoption.
2. There is a scheming vizier who is brother of the king.
3. The vizier sets up an invasion of a neighboring kingdom under false pretenses in order to obtain a weapon that will allow him to go back in time and become the ruler of the Persian Empire.
4. The vizier murders the king and frames the adopted son for it.
5. The adopted son overcomes all manner of obstacles, to protect the magic weapon, saves the day,and gets the girl.

There are lots of good things to say about this movie.

1. Many films do lots of special effects in order to cover up an excessively weak (or excessively convoluted) plot. This film had a great, clear plot. It was involved enough to not be pedestrian, but not so long as to lose the viewer.

2. There was not one single word of profanity in this film, and yet the writing was still enough to get the point across.

3. The action scenes in this film were great. They (=the scenes) demonstrated ACTING. So, we had actors who could do a great job as characters (Ben Kingsley) and also as athletes (Jake Gyllenhaal).

4127179,3,B003IHUI0O,"The first half of 2010 was supposed to be full of action blockbusters.  All of them flopped.  Titles such as Clash of the Titans, Prince of Persia, and the A-Team all fell by the wayside as two animated flicks, Toy Story 3, and How To Train Your Dragon, dominated the box office until Inception came out in the summer.  This movie, Prince of Persia, was especially disappointing considering the Disney name, and that it was supposed to be the beginning of Disney's next big franchise after POTC.

Well, lets list out what went wrong.  First of, the action scenes were way overblown.  Specifically, the chief protagonist, Prince Dastan, is performing physical feats that would put Jet Li and Jackie Chan blush.  In other words, they were too outlandish to believe.  In fact, this is the first Disney live-action film I know of which features an action hero in the style of Rambo, Bruce Lee, etc.. a normal human being routinely capable of Olympic caliber performances.  Way out of character for a Disney movie.  Second, the movie had an absolutely forgettable soundtrack, which again was a big failing for a Disney movie.  Third, too many characters just looked out of place.  This movie is supposed to be set in Persia, yet all the main characters are played by whites of American or English origin.  Fourth, this movie takes place in Persia, yet it features deserts only seen in North Africa and the Arabian peninsula.  Again, too much of a stretch.  So overall, to fake for my tastes.

This movie isn't supposed to be the next Academy Award winner (ergo: a bunch of neurotic people cry about their troubles) which seems to be the only movies that the critics approve of. This movie is about spectacle, great cinematography, great action and a good plot.

It's evident that many of the intelligentsia who reviewed this movie in newspapers and television didn't even see the movie.

4127181,1,B003IHUI0O,"I watched the movie last night. Its as if the scenes were based on long-standing Hollywood movies that we all know, so it was very predictable, killed most of the drama. The scenes were just stuck together like pearl beads on a string. No flow, just assumptions that the audience caught the new plot direction without it actually being developed properly in the script. Special effects were poor, not convincing enough, and too few.

The Princess falls in love with the bastard Prince of Persia, but its unclear exactly when or why - she just kind of does. I wouldn't recommend this even as a young kid's movie. Definitely won't be any sequels, its just that bad. Don't waste your recession dollars on this Blu-Ray/DVD stinker.

Sorry Disney, some people who currently have jobs and produced this stinker need to pray they don't receive pink slips and perhaps you should look for some real talent that already is collecting unemployment that used to make really great movies for you. Kingsley is superb, but limited by the script, Jake is great, the Princess is NOT a raven beauty as the film suggests... the top-shelf actors were subjected to and forced to work with a rotten screenplay, poor directing, poor editing, and poor special effects.

* mild spoilers *

The story itself is not terribly meaty, but it is the tried-and-true stuff of adventure movies: betrayal, romance, and, of course, fighting. In many ways, it is carried by the two lead characters -- Prince Dastan (played by Jake Gyllenhaal) and Princess Tamina (played by Gemma Arterton) -- and the supporting cast (including Ben Kingsley, whose performance as Dastan's uncle, and Alfred Molina, whose performance as a ""slightly dishonest entrepreneur"", were masterful).
The dialog between the Prince and Princess is at times so ""cutsie"" that it ends up cheesy (having heard the original dialog from the game, however, this is a HUGE step up...); but these instances are infrequent, and so not terribly distracting. And, they look good in the roles. Gemma Arterton, with her bronzed skin and henna-dyed hands, is a vision of beauty from ancient legends; and Jake Gyllenhaal, with his buffed physique and ""puppy dog eyes"", is a charming rascal of a warrior prince (as contradictory as it sounds). Arterton convincingly projects a spoiled and sheltered outlook, while Gyllenhaal just as convincingly projects a man who does what he knows is wrong because he's told to do it. Each has their flaws, and each must come to trust the other. And, if you're thinking that love is in the making between the beautiful princess and handsome prince, well...would it happen any other way? (As a side note, Gyllenhaal actually performs a lot of the seemingly impossible stunts -- which was really quite impressive. The commentary on the blu ray is pretty fascinating, if you're interested in that sort of stuff.)
As good as the lead actors are however, they are often eclipsed by the supporting cast. Ben Kingsley's performance is phenomenal. Without giving too much away, his role is one of the most complex roles in the film, and Kingsley's acting prowess does not fail him. Watch his facial features throughout...he truly is the somewhat cowardly and yet otherwise bold ""bureaucrat"" that his character is meant to be. Speaking of ""bureaucrats"", Molina's performance -- and his loyal Umbacca (sp?) guard's -- are fantastic. Wayward, greedy, soulless...and yet, drawn to do right by the conscience he no doubt despises (as well as his friend's sense of honor). A perfect performance -- from both men.

All in all, this was a good movie. I award it 5/5 stars because it is an excellent film for its genre -- unpretentious, visually spectacular, solid-but-not-overwhelming-story-wise, adventure movies.",1291507200,,2767,5.158129175946548

That said, I enjoyed the film for the extraordinarily well-rendered production and art design that made believable the world of the story.

There were ethnic protests that a Persian actor didn't play the lead, but Gyllenhaal is just fine as the rogue prince and he is in great shape and obviously does a lot of his own stunts.

Adapted from a video game (by its creator Jordan Mechner) it went through some strange permutations from the popular side-scrolling puzzler that began it all to the needlessly complicated film.  Mike Newell has a fine eye and a sure hand in the vistas and the action.

I so wanted him to die a thousand terrible deaths.

And the ""princess?"" Another major annoyance. One thing I absolutely hate - both in movies and novels - is when a character portrays some one from the modern day in a period piece. It's fake and artificial. This ""princess"" was some one from 2010 and put into an ancient Persian setting. It just made me want to scratch my eyeballs out.

4127197,4,B003IHUI0O,"Persia is the most powerful empire of its day.  Its power stretches from China to the Mediterranean Sea.  The king has two sons, and when he sees true honor and courage from a street urchin he takes him into his house where he is reared as one of his sons and a prince of Persia.  This boy grows up to be Gyllenhaal's character.  Now grown, the sons are out maintaining and expanding the kingdom via military campaigns.  They are advised by the king's loyal brother (Kingsley), and they are convinced by their uncle to attack a sacred city that they are forbidden by their father to attack...that's the story's set-up.

This is a reasonably good action adventure.  There are lots of battles, there is political intruigue, ancient mysticism, assassins, no, make that Hassassins, and the possibility of romance.  There are plenty of plot twists, adequate character development, and pretty good acting, for the most part.  The special effects are, of course, what make the show, but that's OK.  While it had the potential to be moderately deep, the producers didn't pursue that option.  There's a pretty good moral to the story, and it winds up in true Disneyesque fashion.

Oh, one more thing, be prepared to be creeped out briefly by some snake effects...you'll see.

I have to say that I enjoyed the show, though I don't think I'll need to watch it again.  It's definitely not a 5-star show in my book, though it is definitely a 3-4 star offering, probably closer to 4 stars, so that's what I'll give it.

This may be the key thing about movies based on games: gripping situation, fairly interesting characters, a very, very well-visualized world  . . .  and a paint-by-the-numbers plot. Not to say that Prince of Persia is badly or incompetently plotted, just that any plot which would have rung changes on the same set of characters within the world of ancient Persia created for it would have done just as well - and will probably serve equally well in a sequel. Or two, or three, since the whole thing with the glass-handled dagger brings the story around again to the beginning, with nothing changed, just like starting another round of the game. Otherwise, it's lovely eye-candy, on several levels. As a bonus, it offers some agreeably amusing supporting characters, most especially Alfred Molina who now owns the franchise on comic villainy. There is also a rather nice rapport between the hero and the feisty princess-priestess, Jake Gyllanhaal and Gemma Arterton, and supporting acting talent more than equal to the materiel - although seeing Ben Kingsley in what at first appeared to be a minor role was a dead giveaway in the first five minutes that his character was up to something villainous. Location shooting took place in Morocco - which apart from some of the desert vistas, appears to very good effect. Of the extras, the most outstanding is a fairly detailed `making of' featurette.

4127207,4,B003IHUI0O,"The pre release photos and hype made this look like it was going to be a campy homoerotic muscle festival disguised as Disney's usual overblown, sugar coated, nausea inducing brain rot. Under the production leadership of Jerry Bruckheimer (who has dropped more bombs in the past year than George W. during his entire reign) and the knowledge that it was based on a video game, I was fairly certain I was going to stay far away from it.  Still . . . there was the intrigue of some very good actors such as Jake Gyllenhaal, Ben Kingsly and Alfred Molina.  And those previews looked interesting . . . sort of.  When I saw the blu ray disc at Walmart for half price I though I would give it a chance and I suppose it was worth half the retail price.

It isn't ever going to be a great film but it is sometimes a very good looking one.  The set design here is amazing and there is some beautiful location photography.  Sadly there are also several scenes that look fairly bad due to obvious CGI compositing.  There are a few decent by the numbers action sequences that are also sort of fun.  The visual effects are nothing special, you've seen all of it before a thousand times.  There are some surprisingly fake looking CGI snakes in this thing too.  I'm talking SyFy channel low budget quickie stuff here.

The actors are very good (as expected) with Ben Kingsley being a perfect villain.  Jake Gyllenhaal also proves that he can do just fine as a swashbuckling action hero.  Strangely all the work he did on his body to turn himself into an action hunk was mostly for nothing as his costumes keep him covered up through almost all of the film. All those muscle bound photos, posters and promotional clips don't represent what ended up on screen. I should think Gyllenhaal would be a little peeved about that. Jake also manages a passable British accent.  Did ancient Persians really speak with British accents?  Alfred Molina as a sheik gets what is probably the most memorable role in this curious film.  He also brings an occasional flash of much needed humor to this thing.

The script is actually fairly interesting and thoughtful and has more going for it than this type of film usually does.  Mike Newell managed to direct his unweildy epic without making a fool of himself and for the most part the film stays under control without ever giving in to the temptation to stop the plot for a 20 minute action sequence.  Perhaps that is because this film actually has enough of a plot to sustain interest.  Sadly there are some truly atrocious editing choices made that, rather than enhance the experience of the film, take the viewer out of it and remind us that we are watching a movie.

Disney did a good job with this blu ray release. Picture and sound quality are excellent, as you would expect from a film that was pretty much made for blu ray.  I bought the single disc edition rather than the 3 disc ""special"" edition because I have no use for a digital copy and didn't want a DVD.  The disc comes in a very nice looking embossed, holographic slipcase.  Really slick looking.  There is a well done documentary included on the disc called ""An Unseen World"" that gives some insight into production and costume design as well as interviews with the actors and crew.  Very standard stuff but it gave me all the info I wanted.  There is also a deleted scene included as well as seemingly endless advertisements promoting Disney blu rays.  When I put the disc in I was glad to see it had a quick loading time but then I braced myself for the onslaught of Disney propoganda that I knew was about to hit me.  MUCH TO MY SHOCK and PLEASURE, the screen displayed a message saying I could skip the ads by pressing the ""top menu"" button.  I did and I was immediately at the menu and watching the opening credits in about 15 seconds.  Thank you for that Disney. I truly didn't want to have to fast forward through trailers for Chihuahua movie sequels or listen to you tell me how my family and I should be watching television.

Yes Disney, I still hate you simply because your films are atrocious, mind breakingly awful, conformist dreck and your relentless promotion of EVERY nonsensical film you peddle as ""Disney's latest masterpiece"" or ""Instant Classic""
became laughable in 1980.  Nevertheless you proved that ""family"" entertainment does not have to be dumbed down to the point of idiocy with PRINCE OF PERSIA.  Of course, this film stunk up the box office like a rotting abscess
under Donald Duck's tail feathers so I'm sure you will fall right back into HANNAH MONTANNA DOES DALLAS: THE DISNEY 3D EXPERIENCE (coming to a theatre near me in the very near future).  Still...thanks for the temporary improvment.

4127211,2,B003IHUI0O,"""Prince of Persia: Sands of Time,"" is a Walt Disney film.  Too bad.  If they had shown gratuitous female nudity (heroine or in the harem sequence) this film would be a blockbuster epic great.  As it stands, it is way too focused upon ancient Persian warfare weapons in a documentary type impetus, and they allowed many stunts by the main male lead to obviously echoe much of the 1992 Disney animated feature named ""Aladdin"" where he gets away over the roof tops and via acrobatics that would only be possible for extremely well trained, very fit athletes who work out frequently and stay on a rigorously proper nutrition, avoiding any frivolous party life.  In other words, this film has the traitorous bad guy lose, the hero gets the girl, there's magic, there's death dealt but deserved so nobody cares.  It's a typical Disney film.  Darts, arrows, knives, swords, spears, hack, hack, stab, stab, assassins so deadly Chuck Norris would hide, but this hero kicks their ass.  Like I said, the film needed some girls to show off their assets.  We need new stuff that hasn't been over-used so much for so many years, or else throw me some eye candy.  I watched this film because Ben Kingsley was in it, and up until now that made me believe any movie had merit.  I'll look closer next time.  The 2004 version of ""Troy"" with Brad Pitt has far better sword fights, The 2003 version of ""Helen of Troy"" with Sienna Guillory has far better sword fights, ""Spartacus,"" ""Braveheart,"" ""The Princess Bride,"" and the ""Underworld"" trilogy with Kate Beckinsale all have better sword fights.  Heroic bravery is better in the movie, ""300"" about Thermopylae where in 480 B.C., 300 Spartans blocked hundreds of thousands of Persians for three days.  ""Prince of Persia: Sands of Time"" needs to have some substance instead of just so much flash.  If Disney wants to make epic films with real people in ancient history settings of barbaric warring people, the rest of the realism anticipated in those films by the majority is that there will be some female nudity.  Otherwise they should stick to animation, comedies, or nature documentaries.  There should have been graphic beheadings, limbs hacked off, disembowelment, and streams of blood (and female nudity).  It's a battle movie, trying to be a love story, but the only thing brutal about it is how the movie stays so politically correct.  What a sterile disappointment.",1288828800,,2403,4.848039215686274

It is fun, exciting, the sets are amazing, the parkour fantastic and most of all Jake Gyllenhal is soooo hot. He is one of my favorite actors, very skillful and normally in deeper more serious roles, so it is clear this one was easy for him. He looks so fit, muscled and lean in this movie and best of all you can tell that he just had a blast making it. In fact everything about this movie screams fun. Clearly, aside from the extras marching in the 125 degree Moroccan desert heat, it appears that everyone involved was caught up in the magic of a wonderful tale wonderfully done. It is not deep but it has a good message, and while there is a lovely romantic story it is not the only story of love. Familial love and love of one's country and culture are also important. The special effects are good too and used sparingly as needed so this is not a CGI movie. In fact the fact that Jake did most of his stunts and Gemma did a lot of hers and that they didn't CGI the parkour makes it a lot better to watch. I really don't like movies where they have to hide the actors face all the time to cover up the stunt double or where the actor leaps from a building and becomes a cartoon character. This has a great story, gorgeous costumes and sets and an excellent cast. Ben Kingsley is a superb actor, slightly wasted in a limited role, but still an asset. I highly recommend this film, it is very enjoyable to watch and will be one of a select few that I watch more than once. I would go into more detail about the film but I feel this is one that was so much fun to watch not knowing anything about the story.

4127240,5,B003IHUI0O,"This movie has nearly all the makings of an Epic motion picture. It has an exotic setting, a new crisp plot, plenty of action, and a beautiful woman. Our hero starts out as a street orphan who champions goodness against the Persian army as he jumps around rooftops like the Phantom. However, once he becomes adopted by the king, he loses a lot of personality. He is not as colorful as other leading men in Epic films, mostly due to the writers who gave him lousy lines.

What was really missing in this movie outside of exceptional dialogue was humor. I don't mean turn the movie into a comedy, but when you want to be compared to Pirates..., Indian Jones, or other epics such as Star Wars or even the grand daddy of them all LOTR, they all had some comical element in them with leading men that were able to deliver those lines. This movie lacked that human element and it showed as it failed to hook me.

In spite of the inability of either the script writers or director to create great characters, the plot, action and scenery were enough to carry the film to where it would be enjoyable. There was one ""joke"" as the princess kept an amulet with the sands of time in it on a necklace located at her cleavage...the last place anyone would look, except maybe Prince Dustin who noticed it right off.

Yes, there is a time travel element to it, but it is not really a time travel movie, i.e. it is not bogged down with nerdy time travel paradoxes. Time travel was a gift from the unnamed god(s).

The movie has a happy ending with a message of hope as well as violence, killing, and snakes. I consider it better entertainment than Robin Hood, or Iron Man II.

4127249,2,B003IHUI0O,"I watched this with my children.  Both had been fans of the videogame.  Both were extemely annoyed that this show did not follow the plot of the game at all.  In fact, both wanted to give the movie negative stars.

On the other hand, since I haven't played videogames in approximately 10 years (ever since my children started kicking my butt), I had no such preconceptions.  It simply looked like a good adventure flick to me.  Unfortunately, I was disappointed.

My daughter's description of the show was simply that it looked like ""they took the video game, wrapped Aladdin around it, and threw in bad guys who looked like the Nazgul from Lord of the Rings.""  I've got to agree that the film had all the depth and creativity of a film created via Disney marketing research experts.

My children tell me that in the game, the prince was not a street-urchin like Aladdin. To the extent that he was rewritten to be like Aladdin, one can see the entrance of Disney focus groups and market research specialists.

There is some good and bad acting in the film. Jake Gyllenhaal does a creditable job in a pretty standard action flick.  He doesn't look Persian, but then most of the cast didn't either.  Gyllenhaal's proto-English accent stayed in place pretty well.

In contrast, the female lead was highly forgettable.  Through a major portion of the film, she seemed capable of only one line, ""Give me the dagger!!""  After a while, she did change it to ""It is my destiny!""  By that time, though, my son started screaming ""Give me the dagger,"" every time she came on the screen.

For first class action sequences and good CGI, this is an OK flick to watch if you put your mind on idle and let the ""creativity"" of Disney Marketing Research lead you where they want.

I can't let one last aspect go unmentioned.  Cliche ridden films increasingly have a stalwart black man who inevitably dies for the white hero.  This film continues that cliche.  Black supporting actors are treated like the Red Shirts from Star Trek TOS.  I wish that racial cliche could be put to rest.",1287100800,4,2065,4.615384615384615

The action was fine, lots of jumping, lots of sword play, a decent likable protagonist, but the writing failed in this movie. The story telling deviated from the video game series it was based on just enough that what could have been a great film was reduced to a mediocre film. Jake Gyllenhaal does a very respectable job in his buffed up state and doing his own stunts, his acting and presence is far and above much better than that ""Donnie Darko"" waste of film he did awhile back but the poor writing hamstrings his potential to become the ""Jack Sparrow"" of Persia and imbue his character as an icon on American Pop Culture.

Second, rely on the eighty year old tactic that when writing and acting are weak just invest in good props, sets and CGI to compensate. OK,  there were a few Moroccan scenes that didn't feel like sets.

Only Disney can ruin the fantastical ambience of several thousand year old ancient Persia by having the actors look and speak like 21st century models with bleached white porcelain veneers smiling at every photo op (even the bad guys).

4127260,3,B003IHUI0O,"Here's my pet peeve with video game adaptations...they hardly ever stick to the script of the game! A lot of video games nowadays have well thought out story lines and play out like movies. God of War 3, Red Dead Redemption, Uncharted just to name a few. So my question is, why do writers/directors essentially throw all that out and start from scratch? It's a waste of good material and often adds up to crappy movies. *cough* Silent Hill, Final Fantasy, Resident Evil *cough*

Prince of Persia isn't a bad movie...but I certainly wouldn't say it's a good movie. Obviously, it pretty much dismisses the entire premise of the video game, which upsets me, but I was able to stifle that until the credits. What I saw was just kinda...so-so. The action scenes were good, not great. The love story seemed forced, ""Oh I hate you right now...okay now I love you."" And the worst part of all, the Dagger of Time is barely used! I think he used it once to stop her from trying to stab him and then another time he used it to kill snakes. Wow. Seriously? Besides the Delorean, the Dagger of Time is one of the coolest time traveling devices ever and it's used more as a parlor trick than an actual plot point. Which, in the game, it was a very crucial plot point.

Then there was all the added fluff. I get it, Disney wants to appeal to children. But Ostrich races? Come on! There were other instances where it seemed like they were just looking to fill 2 hours. Like how they escaped the city and then wandered aimlessly through the desert and were like ""Okay, let's go back to the city now."" I don't know...it just seemed like the whole plot could have been tightened up...but maybe that's just me.

Anyways, I apologize for rambling. I just get peeved when I see my favorite video games turned into lackluster movies. If they pull this crap with Halo, I'm seriously gonna be pissed.",1286755200,,1875,4.476608187134503

4127266,2,B003IHUI0O,"Once upon a time, hollywood types thought that it would be fun to film a movie in a desert situation with camels and sand and dirt and turbins and they were horribly wrong. What happened with the movie Ishtar is sort of what happened here with PRINCE OF PERSIA. Sure, the movies are two completely different things. ISHTAR was a comedy set in the desert and people didn't get it. It was long and boring. PRINCE OF PERSIA had a better shot at success because it was based on a video game, which are FUN and FAST and EXCITING.  PRINCE OF PERSIA has moments of FUN, but it is never fast or even close to being EXCITING.

PRINCE OF PERSIA was stunning in the sense that a video game movie that had so much potential, became a talk fest DRAMA before you realize what happened. The movie starts off with much promise. In fact, early on, I was involved and thinking that I thought the movie had been misjudged and that it wasn't that bad.  Then the drama started and the action disappeared like a gust of sand in the wind.

Before I realized it, I was disconnected from the film that had become a long series of talking heads and soap opera drama. I was reading. Playing on the internet. Doing dishes. Thinking about what movie I could watch next that would guarantee me the intense involvement that I was hoping to get with PRINCE OF PERSIA.... and didn't.

The creators of PRINCE OF PERSIA dropped the ball. The screenplay was lacking flair and creativity, which is consequently the exact opposite of what you get with the ground-breaking highly creative video game.

For all intensive purposes, I should give the movie 1 star, but I reserve 1's for real stinkers and 5's for real gems. It wasn't the worst movie I've ever seen. It was just boring.",1286496000,2,1743,4.465408805031447
4127267,1,B003IHUI0O,"A lot of money went into this production and it DID find its audience among the masses who like eye candy. But frankly this film put me to sleep. Literally. 'Prince of Persia' displays the same faults that so many effects laden movies transfered from other mediums have. Movies such as this may satisfy the crowd that wants to see it's favorite graphic novel or video game on the big screen, but for the rest of us, it is a big bore. The producers no doubt have satisfied its audience but for the rest of us, those who want story, depth of character, and a thoughtful drama, we have to look elsewhere.
'Prince of Persia' makes the mistake that so many of this genre does: The content does not fit the medium. Allow me to explain.

The educated film goer wants more out of the film experience than fast cuts, CGI, flashy visuals, loud audio and pseudo 3D. This works fine for mediums like video games and graphic novels, but film is an altogether different experience. 'Prince of Persia' could have been a good film if the producers developed the property as an addition to the mythos of the Prince of Persia video game universe. It could have been an origins tale like 'Batman Begins', or an historical version like 'Pirates of the Caribbean', or a character driven story like 'Iron Man'. But it wasn't. Disney took the easy way out and gave mass audiences what it was most familiar with - a cinematic video game. A film that will make a lot of money but will be forgotten in time. Not a film that you will go back to years from now. Not a film that will be celebrated as a classic of its genre like 'Superman' or the other films I mentioned here.

As for the film itself, the buffed up Jake Gyllenhaal looks amazingly like the current  graphic depiction of the main character. He does the character justice. By that I mean he acts like a monotone character out of a video game and that is not necessarily a bad thing. Gemma Arterton's portrayal as Tamina is not very good. It is probably not her fault that her character's behavior is inconsistent and that her lines are terrible. Ben Kingsley is a good as always. You just know that he is evil the first time you see him in this film.

The attempt to duplicate the running, jumping, and swinging of the main character of the video game is too  fake CGI to believe. The director tried to duplicate 'parkour', as used the much better films such as Casino Royale' and 'District 13',  but not very successfully.

The ending of the film is confusing and bears the mark of writers who did not know how to logically end the story. But I guess it looks good on the big screen.

Overall, this film deserves a rental and then pass it on the dustbin of what-might-have-been films.",1286409600,12,2721,4.438877755511022
4127268,4,B003IHUI0O,"Mirroring the same grand course that Disney charted in the Pirates of the Caribbean, Prince of Persia makes its mark right from the first minutes of the film.  When we first meet the Prince, he is cut from the same `street rat' cloth as Disney's Aladdin.  But much like that tumbling protagonist, the Prince quickly rises to royal status while not losing sight of where he came from.  Jake Gyllenhall brings a lot of heart and personality to Prince Dastan as he meets the princess Tamina and discovers the secrets of the dagger powered by the Sands of Time.

Jerry Bruckheimer takes the audience straight into the action with vast sweeping deserts, majestic spired cities, and a soundtrack that should really be experienced in your home theater.  The energy is as kinetic as you might expect for a film based on a videogame.  Through a series of events Dastan and the dagger are pursued up the walls, across the rooftops, and through of the caves of this adventure.

The supporting cast really brings the film to vibrant life.  Gemma Arterton is marvelous as the fiery princess Tamina who has been entrusted with the mystical secret of the dagger.  Ben Kingsley plays the Prince's uncle and is the polar opposite of his Ghandi character as he leads Dastan and his royal brothers on a very personal quest of his own.

I've been a gamer for years, and have always been leery about taking characters from a console and transplanting them on the big screen.  Prior to seeing the film, I had not played any of the Prince of Persia games.

This is a video game translation, how much plot do you expect it to have? How much plot did you expect the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" movie to have (based off a Disney ride)?
I especially enjoyed the action. There was lots of running, jumping, climbing...just like Parkour (a cardio exercise whereas most obstacles cause almost no problems and no hesitations, just instinct). As a side note, if you go to a movie with little or no expectations, there is also little room for disappointment.

What I do know is that PRINCE OF PERSIA works as a sweeping fantasy adventure, and I couldn't peel away my eyeballs off the screen. This picture rivals THE MUMMY and THE PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN franchises in terms of the lavish scope and fantastical derring-do and that nostalgic callback to those pulp serial films. I basically enjoyed the crap out of it. Never mind that these Persians tend to speak with Brit accents, and that there isn't really a Persian (Iranian) actor who garners a noticeable part. It's cool. I'm shallow.

The hero is Dastan, the gutsy orphan boy from the streets of Nasaf who gets adopted into the Persian royal family, but the meat of the story happens fifteen years later. The MacGuffin of the thing is a mystical dagger which can reverse time for the span of one minute (or less). When the Persian army invades the Holy City of Alamut - on suspicion that Alamut is amassing secret weapons - Dastan stumbles onto the dagger and so gains the attention of Alamut's beautiful, wily Princess Tamina (Gemma Arterton). Tamina is the last in a long line of guardians to the dagger. Her sacred vow to the gods would go a ways into driving this film.

I remember when Ben Kingsley was good, but it's been ages since GANDHI, ages since even WITHOUT A CLUE. His recent stuff, with quality in mind, falls more along the lines of BLOODRAYNE and THE LOVE GURU. You see Ben Kingsley parading around in black eye makeup, and I don't think you need a SPOILER alert to suss out that his character is a knave of the most vile-hearted persuasion. When Prince Dastan is framed for a shocking murder, he flees for his life and he ends up taking the captive, combative Princess Tamina with him. And if you own one whit of movie-watching acumen, then it quickly dawns on you that this is the ideal platform for one of them lively, bickering romances. Sue me, I'm a sucker for a love story. And have you seen Gemma Arterton? Things palpitate when she's on screen.

Not having seen much (or any) of Jake Gyllenhaal's films, I wasn't sure what to make of his being cast as the film's action hero. Thru some form of cultural osmosis, I've gathered that Jake is more the sort to dabble in indie cinema rather than be caught dead in a summer blockbuster. But not so. Jake Gyllenhaal, along with the good acting chops, is credible as the swashbuckling Prince Dastan. He buffs up for this one and brings a surprising physicality that's pretty dang Burt Lancasteresque.

David Belle - who stars in the awesome DISTRICT B13 films - comes in as the picture's parkour coordinator, because our Dastan is this period piece practitioner of parkour. But parkour is only one element making up the spectacular action sequences and f/x. You cannot front on the production values. The CG is seamless. The sets and costumes are breathtaking and imaginative. The score is rousing. The sinister, black-clad ""Hassansins"" are properly menacing. Alfred Molina makes the most of his showy role as a desert bandit/tax evader. All of these elements - and the two beautiful leads - work to transport you to an enchanted desert realm where sand may invade your private bits but it's compensated for by deadly magic and wondrous, panoramic peril and Gemma Arterton's belly button. And have I told you about the Ngbaka?

What I have is the single DVD version, and it contains ""An Unseen World,"" which is the Making Of the film featurette (00:15:51 minutes long). There are also two extraneous ""special features"" that have nothing to do with the movie, so I'll skip mentioning them. Go see the movie.",1286236800,2,3655,4.660465116279069
4127271,4,B003IHUI0O,"This film has a nice smooth feel to it. It packs the goods of what makes a good movie: A dynamic hero, a pretty girl in distress and a tricky villain. From the start, this movie rolls out the stunts. It is a fast paced movie, but still takes the time to allow for some romance to build.

The storyline is not easy to predict, this is a definite plus in my opinion. So often these days you are able to predict the plot of a movie. This one keeps you guessing until closer to the end. I really like the chemistry that is generated between Dashan and Tamina as they out-smart one another in order to hold onto that special dagger.

There are also a lot of adventure elements contained within this movie that just puts it on a grand scale as it covers a massive sea of sand. My only qualm with this movie is that I wished they was more moments when the Sands of Time were actually used.",1286150400,2,882,4.122093023255814

He is forced to team up with a Princess named Tamina who helps Dastan prove his innocence. If you love action, you'll love PRINCE OF PERSIA: THE SANDS OF TIME!!!",1286064000,2,446,4.321428571428571
4127274,3,B003IHUI0O,"Several years ago, before the Matrix and Crouching Tiger and their ilk, the special effects of this film would have been astounding. Today, they're clich. The fast cut video editing, with its obligatory stop action/slow motion sequences, are old hat and can sustain interest for only about 60 seconds -- yet the scenes go on and on and on ... and on. Since there is little in this movie to recommend it other than SX, they become its great weakness instead of its strength.

The plot ... if you can call it that ... is paper thin and the characterizations are on par with the cartoons and video games that inspired the film. The acting is average, with Kingsley sleep walking through his role (what was he thinking????) and the others going through the paces with minimal effort, which is what the dialogue demanded of them.

There are some WONDERFUL visual feasts; vast desert panoramas and other-worldly city-scapes. There is also a bit of comic relief that allows the picture to stop short (just barely) of taking itself too seriously. But there just was no emotional connection to the film. I know that sounds odd when I'm talking about this type of movie, but do you remember the first Pirates of the Caribbean movie? How you laughed at that, and really cared what happened to those characters? Did you laugh a lot at this? Were you in suspense about the outcome? Did you care what happened to these people? I didn't, and that's why it was, for me, a big disappointment.",1286064000,,1475,4.647509578544061

4127276,4,B003IHUI0O,"This film is a visual feast of action and special effects. Jake Gyllenhaal, playing the lead role as Prince Dastan, does a good job of moving into role of dashing and handsome action hero.  Gemma Arterton, one of the most beautiful women on earth, plays Princess Tamina.  Both actors are able to convey the over the top acting style necessary to compete with the exceptional effects. This is not an art film that requires subtle understated acting but rather requires robust over-statement to balance the incredible visual effects.  Don't take this as criticism. If you want a subtle Gyllenhaal, watch Brokeback Mountain. If you want an action hero Gyllenhaal, this is the film for you. The art direction was superb with construction of an ancient empire, Persia, with all its grandeur. The cinematography was also superb with visual effects in virtually every frame of the film. The beautiful North African landscape of Morocco evoked a visual time and place for the viewer.  The film requires the viewer to suspend judgment and to forget any knowledge they have of Persia, Islam, Sufism, and Zorasterism; since in this film there is great literary license taken around the cultures that make up the Persian Empire (ancient Iran). The Prince of Persia delivers visually stunning entertainment with incredible editing to keep your eyes and mind engaged at all times. The storyline is not especially complicated but that is never a problem since the action and visuals are certainly the primary focus.  Ben Kingsley is the only character that doesn't need to overstate their performance. As the younger brother to the King, he is the primary character that the audience must try to figure out as does Prince Dastan. The incredible acting skills of Alfred Molina are evident in the role of Sheik Amar and I think Molina could have stolen the show if this character had been more developed.  Steve Toussaint, an incredible physical force, as the African slave Seso, has a wonderful fight scene with the Hassansins, a group trained to specialize in assassinations. Toby Kebbell and Richard Coyle play the two biological princes and adopted brother to Prince Dastan. Both do a great job.

4127280,4,B003IHUI0O,"The Prince of Persia, Sands of Time. Is a nice little movie that, could have been a much better summer movie that it was.
I know what Disney was trying to do. It was trying for another Pirates of the Caribbean series success. Well it missed the mark entirely!
For all his cuteness and sex appeal, in this instance Jake Gyllenhaal is no Johnny Depp. Depp was made to play the role of Capt. Jack Sparrow.

Just as he was ideal for the role of Sweeny Todd, the Demon Barber of Fleet Street!
Gyllenhaal however could only mug and flex for the camera. He had no real sense of comic timing, which would've made his role much more enjoyable.

The plot line wasn't well written either. There could have been a little more creativeness to it than just the ""Evil Uncle"" plot device.
And finally, there's the fact that, not all video games make good movie adaptations. Case in point, the Street Fighter movie. The first movie was a near flop and the second was a flop!

So I give the movie 4 stars. Only because it was a nice idea, that could have been better! I think Disney will have better luck with The Sorcerer's Apprentice !",1285718400,,1119,4.3701923076923075

The writers took an action movie story line but made it much better than the stereotype, action, intrigue, story twists, and a wonderful script and characters. It was really nice to not have to roll my eyes at a silly jokes or drama or attempt of a romantic moment that was not believable. I am  sick of the typical one night stance romance and while the love in Prince of Persia is not necessarily done perfectly, it is done really well. I cannot say more without adding spoilers, but I think that the story (unlike many, many movies coming out) is NOT predictable and it kept me holding my breath. In my opinion, this movie is extremely under rated and I wish that others would give the producers, directors, and actors the pat on the back they so richly deserve. Whoo hoo, I really enjoyed this movie. It is so very unique and the story is intriguing. The script is original and the humor kept the theater chuckling. The fight scenes in this movie are now by far some of my favorites and there are plenty of times when you feel your heart pumping. I thought the acting by Gemma Arterton was absolutely brilliant and while I tend to not like Jake Gylenhaal, I have to admit he did a stelar job as Prince Dastan and REALLY added a very real and personable action hero. The scenery was beautiful, the attention to detail refreshing, and the specially effects blended wonderfully.

I kept on pushing myself to remember, and I couldn't do it.  It was only when I was randomly trolling the Amazon pages did I see the ""Prince of Persia"" DVD, and remembered that I had watched it on the plane.

Anyway, that's all I really wanted to say.  Oh, and the movie sucked.

I agree with earlier posts that as a fantasy movie you have to suspend some beliefs in order to fully appreciate the movie, just like any other fantasy or science fiction movie.

I recommend this to anyone, of any age. Don't judge the movie simply because you don't think Jake Gyllenhaal should do action movies. This just proved that he is an amazing actor.

4127290,4,B003IHUI0O,"For many of us who grew up playing video games on a PC, one game that captured our attention (no, not Lode Runner) was a game called ""Prince of Persia"" created by Jordan Mechner.

Since 1989, we have seen the game evolve to the action, graphically impressive video game on the current gen video game consoles and continues to be a popular video game franchise.  And in 2010, Walt Disney Pictures, courtesy of producer Jerry Bruckheimer (""Pirates of the Caribbean"" films, ""Black Hawk Down"", ""Bad Boys"" films, ""National Treasure"" films, ""Armageddon"") and director Mike Newell (""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"", ""Donnie Brasco"", ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"") along with screenwriters Boaz Yakin, Doug Miro and Carlo Bernard went to work on the film adaptation, cinematographer John Seale (""Poseidon"", ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"", ""The Perfect Storm"", ""The Talented Mr. Ripley) and Harry Gregson-Williams (""Shrek Forever After"", ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"", ""The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3') composing the music for the film.

If anything, the filmmakers odds were against them as video game to film have not really had much success.  And for ""Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time"", the film received mixed  reviews from the critics but at the same time, this CG-driven film budgeted around $150-200 million made around $329 million in the worldwide box office and is expected to make more in home video sales.

VIDEO:

""Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time"" looks absolutely fantastic.  Presented in 1080p (2:40:1), the film looks absolutely stunning.  You can see the detail on the surface of the clothing, the wood, the stubble on Gylenhaal's chin, skin pigmentation and more.  Colors are absolutely vibrant with orange, amber hues that are seen in the film and the wonderful CG work when Dastan uses his dagger.  Blacks are nice and deep, detail is just magnificent.  There are scenes that uses a weak light source, ala candlelight so there is some black crush present as detail are not as pronounced on scenes with very dark shadows but by no means does this hurt the picture quality of the entire film.

I didn't notice any artifacting, banding, combing, aliasing, anything negative.  If anything, this is one of the best PQ live-action films to come from Disney.  Very impressive!

As for the accompanying DVD, the film is presented in 480i (Widescreen 2:40:1 - Enhanced for 169 televisions).

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio (48 kHz/24-bit).  The lossless audio of this film is absolutely fantastic.  The dialogue and music is crisp and clear and what is more impressive is the use of sound.  From the arrows zipping and panning from right to left and a scene where a man is using a steel whip against Dastan and you hear that whip swirling all over the soundscape.  Fantastic use of immersive sound.  And because of the many action scenes, great use of LFE for the bigger sounds throughout the film.  Also, included is an English 2.0 DVS, French 5.1 DTS and French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital soundtrack.  Fans of the film will enjoy this lossless soundtrack!

As for the accompanying DVD, the DVD comes with an English, French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital soundtrack and an English 2.0 DVS.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time"" had an uphill battle of trying to prove that a video game to film adaptation can be successful and in the end, the film did make a ton of money in the box office.  So, I think that given the success of the film, we will more than likely see a ""Prince of Persia"" sequel.

In some ways, having played and still purchasing many incarnations of the video game, it was one thing to expect the main character to jump on walls and buildings.  I wasn't expecting a labyrinth or floors breaking apart and our hero would fall to his death like the video game but I was expecting a more meatier adventure-based story between Dastan and the princess.  In some way, almost an exciting adventure story similar to an earlier ""Indiana Jones"" style of film.  To get away from the typical video game film mindset of popcorn action flick but a film with more substance than glitz and beauty.

Afterall, you have a talented director, cinematographer and composer, you expect an action-driven film but a good story.  But in many ways, ""Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time"" follows the list of debased films in which they look great (and look and sound spectacular on Blu-ray) but if anything, it's not a film that stands out in your mind, nor do you feel inclined in wanting to watch it again (unless you are a Jake Gyllenhaal or Gemma Arterton die-hard fan).

The performances were fine but Ben Kingsley, I've seen him act with a tremendous amount of passion in films before and in ""Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time"", I felt he was a bit subdued as Nizam.  Gemma Arterton was very good, sexy, beautiful as the Princess Tamina and definitely a major 180 from the character of her ""St. Trinity's"" films.  She's an actress that can take on any kind of character and it shows  And also you have a good number of talents with Alfred Molina, Richard Cole, Ronald Pickup, Toby Kebbell and Steve Toussaint doing a good job as well.

But as for the main actor, Jake Gyllenhaal, there was no doubt we would see the well-known actor taking on an action-based role and showing off his athletic nature (and physique) throughout the film but similar to Ben Kingsley, we have seen these two talents really shine in non-action films, in this case...the character of Dastan had the flair of the action silent star Douglas Fairbanks but at the same time, the storyline of Fairbanks film made you enjoy the film even more, in this case...everything seems like a blur as our protagonist is all over the place.  Yes, it's true to the video game...jumping, fighting, climbing, etc. but I would have enjoyed more time focused on character development.

""Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time"" is definitely a Blu-ray that shines in the video and audio category.  The picture quality is fantastic and the lossless audio was very impressive.  Special features were OK, but I prefer to watch special features independently, not selecting them while watching a film.  So, I'm not the biggest fan of Disney's ""CineExplore"" but it's all subjective to the viewer.

For those who do not want the DVD and digital copy but only the Blu-ray, a Blu-ray single disc release of ""Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time"" will be sold separately as well.

Overall, ""Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time"" does show it's faithfulness to the video game franchise.  There is plenty of action in this film and for the most part, it is a good popcorn action flick, but for those wanting something deeper, you're not going to find it in this film.  But if you want a fun, action-driven film, nothing more and nothing less, ""Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time"" is definitely for you.",1285286400,7,8013,4.769230769230769

4127295,4,B003IHUI0O,"A few of my friends, die hard Princeo of Persia game fans, advised me not to pick up this movie. With Netflix and my pretty large movie collection I didn't see any reason to own this one, but for reasons I don't even understand (probably cus people kept telling me not to watch it) I picked this up on Blu ray. And all I can say is Im happy that I went against my better judgement and picked this baby up!

First and foremost Im not into the games, being a gamer myself I couldn't get into the games. From my perspective PoP looks like it has alot of high flying parkour and the main hero fighting a billion badguys by himself, and a dagger that shifts time. And guess what? This movie has all of that! The storyline is solid and I feel that the characters were surprisingly fleshed out, from the main character to the villain to all the supporting guys. With recent big budget action/fantasy movies it seemed like the pacing was out of whack (i.e. Clash of the Titans) but this movie got it right for the most part.  Overall the movie greatly exceeded my expectations.

That being said there are a few things I think could have been improved. First being our hero, I know Jake whatchamacallit looks the part but his acting is something else all together.  No matter what he's in you just cant get attached to the character.  Now we all know theres going to be a sequel since Disney is trying to capture more of the younger male audience and it cant ride the Pirates craze forever so hopefully Jake can get it together next time.  Dont get me wrong he didn't drag my movie experience down but looking at how he's a box office letdown the movie could have probably faired alot better without him.  Secondly I know no one else cared but Im tired of all foreign oriented movies made in the U.S. where everyone has British accents.  Last time I checked i don't think Persians had any contact with Britain during their hey day...>_> Also my final gripe is how the characters kept having to explain key plot points over and over again. I know dastan and tus weren't in the same room together when they found out about whatever but WE were so they could have spared us that.

Over all this is a good movie and if you're into action/fantasy with some good acting and killer fight scenes (personal favorite was the knife fight at the end that didn't even have dastan..killer stuff) its definitely worth picking up. Usually the newer movies don't get alot of play time on my blu ray player but this one has, and if that says anything its give this one a go and help disney put something other than Pirates out for their live action stuff (Tron aside...)",1285113600,2,2643,4.399590163934426
4127296,3,B003IHUI0O,"Jake Gyllenhaal (and his sister Maggie) are the children of Naomi, as in ""What About Naomi?""

If you watched the classic original Electric Company back in the '70s (or when it was briefly revived, or on DVD), you know that this was the signature phrase from the brilliant ""Love of Chair,"" a satire of soap operas that was conceived by head writer Paul Dooley. Every installment of this sketch ended with the narrator saying, as the organ music dramatically paused, ""And...what about Naomi?""

It was an inside joke. The real Naomi was Children's Television Workshop staffer Naomi Foner, who years later gave birth to the two young stars. What does this have to do with The Prince of Persia? Well, it gives Jake Gyllenhaal a few extra points with me even though this movie somehow falls short of what it could be. He seems like a sincerely good fellow, and even took the time to appear in promos and on talk shows to promote this film, something that some stars who cash huge Disney's paychecks don't bother to do.

As a workout video, The Prince of Persia is better than any of those Jane Fonda VHS tapes. Jake earns his abs in scene after scene. It's a shame that the script did not offer him as much of a challenge. We never really get to know, or really care much about, the lead characters. The first 30 minutes is almost solid exposition, overloaded with political business and intrigue, before the fantasy of the magic dagger and the romance of the lovely and independent Princess and Dastan get underway.

The two leads seem to have some chemistry but an awful lot of epic furniture gets in their way. I have to wonder how the script must have been before it was meddled with by all the chefs, concerned about the obviously huge budget paying off and making sure the kitchen sink wasn't left out.

It's a fine cast with always great performances by Ben Kingsley and Alfred Molina, spectacular production values on a level with DeMille and a fine score by Harry Gregson-Williams.

Maybe the summer was too hot here in Florida for me to find the film's setting very appealing. The short documentary included with the DVD (the Blu-Ray also includes a deleted scene and an interactive feature) tells us that the temperatures were over 100 degrees and this discomfort comes across in the film -- though apparently producer Jerry Bruckheimer stayed nice and cool in the studio where he taped his comments with a superimposed background behind him!",1285027200,,2447,4.6923076923076925
4127297,3,B003IHUI0O,"PRINCE OF PERSIA: THE SANDS OF TIME is a Disney film based on a video game. That puts it in the same genre as THE PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN, which is a much better film.

Jake Gyllenhall (Prince Dastan) tries very hard to carry it off. A one-time street urchin, he has been adopted by the Persian Emperor and raised alongside the princes of the blood. When the expansionist Persian army comes to the holy city of Alamut, they are forbidden to lay siege to it, but the Emperor's brother Nizam (Ben Kingsley) orders the city attacked anyway, and its riches despoiled.

Among these riches are Princess Tamina (Gemma Arterton) who is the high priestess of the Alamut cult, and a dagger which has the ability to turn back time. Nizam wishes to use it for his own greedy ends. It becomes Dastan's task to stop Nizam.

Loaded with intricate, fantastical Middle Eastern settings, a good storyline, and the action that is Jerry Bruckheimer's trademark, PRINCE OF PERSIA certainly holds the viewer's attention.

The weakness of this film is the casting. Gyllenhaal's Dastan is credible, but lacks the wit of Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow, and is short on the action hero chops of Orlando Bloom's Will Turner. Gemma Arterton, who has an impressive resume, is very pretty as the Arabian princess, but her character's personality and behavior veer wildly between the Sixth Century BCE and the 21st Century CE; one minute she is the retiring and devout priestess, while the next minute she might be shouting, ""Let's go Mets!"" and spilling beer on herself at a ballgame.  Ben Kingsley isn't at all convincing as the evil Nizam, who starts out as the Princes' kindly Uncle. He seems to want to stay in that groove.

Still, this is a good film to share with the family.",1284940800,,1748,4.714754098360656

Having played the very first version (yeah, I am over 40) on an IBM 8088 with an orange on black screen and then having played the Sands of Time on PS2 I can say I really like the premise. But good games do not necssarily good movies make. And POP is no exception. (Still it is much better than many other such attempts)
It is -as expected- a ""no brains necessary - just use your eyes please"" type movie. And I have no objection to such movies. I actually love them. Not all films need to work on the grey matter. We need movies to flush out the days's stress as well. We do need soap bubbles.
My problem is that this is a really big soap bubble. Even as a pure action flick, it failed to raise any interest in me. Everything and everyone is flat. Even the grand action scenes (the siege for example) feel so rushed that excitement wanes before it can take hold of you. Gemma Arterton is nice to look at but wooden - and there is no chemistry between her and the prince. Jake Gyllenhaal is probably nice eye candy for the ladies but it is Mr. Kingsley who delivers as a good (albeit very classical) villain.
Action scenes are wll planned and Jake Gyllenhaal's hopping from wall to wall does connect you to the game.

4127306,4,B003IHUI0O,"Video games. Since when did the art of film neglect fine screenplays, theatrical works, novels, and short stories as resources for cinema and settle for making kids' games movie material?  It makes a statement about priorities, right? But given the fact that pure video game entertainment is that important (having never played, this viewer is at a disadvantage), PRINCE OF PERSIA is a surprisingly sound film produced with extravagance and vigor and a wealth of CGI effects, and whatever happens with the little machine held gismo for the video game manipulation to make the experience exciting, that experience has been very well transformed by writers Boaz Yakin, Doug Miro, Carlo Bernard, and game inventor/screen story creator Jordan Mechner.  Disney joins Jerry Bruckheimer (with the fine help of director Mike Newell) in creating what should have been a resounding success at the box office extravaganza.  But alas, this one fizzled.  Why that happened is not apparent from the DVD.

Jake Gyllenhaal hits that happy medium as a daredevil Prince Dastan with just the right dose of derring-do stunts, charisma, and finely tuned comedy timing: he makes a great hero on screen, but the costumers should have allowed him to feature his well-developed physique he worked on for this role.  But he makes the little orphan boy turned royal family believable and lovable. His adopted father, the king of Persia (Ronald Pickup), his 'brothers' (Toby Kebbell and Richard Coyle), his sidekick Bis (Reece Ritchie - keep an eye on this actor), and his evil uncle (Ben Kingsley) all contribute solid roles with quite a bit of philosophy about family ties and loyalty.  The key to the story is the siege of a borderline rival kingdom ruled by the smart and sassy Rachel Weisz-type Tamina (Gemma Arterton) who guards the dagger that has the ability to manipulate time.  Throw in a group of evil Hassasins (like that play on terms?) lead by Gsli rn Gararsson, some nearly unconquerable situations such as the world becoming a quicksand disaster, some wildly hilarious comedy (on the dark side) by tax evader Sheik Amar (Alfred Molina), and some changes that the time manipulating dagger can effect and the story spins to a conclusion. This viewer would be ready for a sequel, so entertaining is this diversion of a film, but the apparent box office failure of expectations make that an outside possibility.

Though it is always difficult to tell where a Director of Photography and the CGI engineers meet, John Seale does provide some gorgeous desert effects.  The music by Henry Gregson-Williams is appropriate if forgettable.  Coming away from the DVD experience leaves this viewer even more impressed with the spectrum of acting skills of Jake Gyllenhaal.  And that is really enough.  The script makes some strange errors - beginning the film with statements as to how Persia was a vast country that covered the entire Middle East, and then throwing in references in the dialogue to Iraq, Turkey and other countries that makes the research sound shaky at best. It is a great popcorn movie - if popcorn at home weren't such a dietary no-no. Grady Harp, September 10",1284595200,5,3156,5.011472275334608

""We have no obligation to make history.
We have no obligation to make art.
We have no obligation to make a statement.
Our obligation is to make money.""
-Don Simpson, longtime partner of Jerry Bruckheimer.

Is Jerry Bruckheimer your filmmaking hero? Do you love colorful action scenes where the hero's hair looks like he just came from the stylist two seconds ago...even after a five-minute sword fight? Do you not mind insipid dialogue matched with wooden acting? Does a movie based on a video game sound like high quality cinematic genius? Well, Prince Of Persia awaits!

This is by far the worst acting I've seen out of Gyllenhall, whom I normally enjoy. Maybe the script was just so hackneyed that he gave up before he even started, and spent all his time on bicep curls. He's clearly more into looking good than acting well here, and only Alfred Molina and Ben Kingsley (!...?...$) deliver anything approaching an enjoyable performance. I'm all for mindless summer fare, but when a movie is based on a video game and the video game delivers more dramatic cohesion, it's a bad sign.

The parkour stunts are nowhere near as much fun as they could have been, and despite the obvious mega-millions spent on sets and cgi, they could have spent more time making the actors look real instead of fresh from the makeup trailer. The props etc are wonderful, but everybody looks so made-up and Hollywood that it all just never gels.

The blu-ray transfer is good but all that does is highlight the cheesy make-up everyone has on in every scene. Not to mention Jake's and the Princess' hairdos. Their hair is the true star here. If only the dialogue had been given as much attention. For all the wonderful Moroccan scenery, POP still looks like an over-budgeted Hollywood Blockbuster TM, every step of the way.

Don Simpson would be so proud.

I'd rather watch the original Sinbad films in all their glorious hokeyness than this passable but ultimately mediocre tripe, any day.
Get the video games; they offer much more fun for your entertainment dollar.",1284508800,,2049,4.787535410764873

While the special effects are great the story is predictable and feels like you've seen it before.  EXample:  Alldin and the future Prince of Persia are both ""diamonds in the rough (i.e. orphan street rats)""  Alladin steels an apple in the market place; Prince of Persia pays for it in the market place.  A pompous lord is about to run over a poor peasant then hit him then Alladin/Prince of Persia does the noble thing and rescues him.  The chase seen through the market place for both is very similar (minus abu the monkey).  The Princess of the town the Persians attack is exactly like Jasmine in Alladin (self-assured, not going to take crap or marry the ""typical"" prince.  The bulk of the story has the Princess and Prince of Persia stealing the ""sacred dagger"" back and forth from each other while betraying the other one constantly.  This part is pretty boring and predictable (would you believe they find themselves falling in love through all the betrayals?  Who could have guessed that?  I like all the actors and actresses but the characters are flat and predictable.  A lot of the bad guys and the ending with the giant hour glass of time reminds me of Raiders of the Lost arc.  Now if you are wondering if there is a magic carpet the answer is no!  So that is a difference but not really because they make up for it by having the Prince of Persia have spiderman like skill so he doesn't need the carpet guy.  This dude can absolutely fly and walk up walls and hold on with one hand to a slippery step when tons of sand is dumping on top of him.  Pretty cool except he doesn't have the red and blue suit.

4127313,3,B003IHUI0O,"I will have to do a mixed review on this one. I went to the store and there were 3 versions. One is the DVD only. One is the Bluray DVD only and one is the Bluray, DVD and digital copy. It is not worth the extra $$ to buy the 3pack unless you are dead set on having your digital copy.
The special features were definately not worth the money spent. Also, the special feature on the Bluray has the Rewind/Fast Forward disabled so you HAVE to watch the whole thing from start to finish. If you miss something, you have to start back from start and cannot FFWD. They are also very limited as stated in the product description. You HAVE to have both the Bluray and the DVD to see all the extras and there are only 3 to see.
If you are a fan of the Assassin's Creed game and the amazing views from rooftops, this movie quickly takes advantage of this photography style and I felt that they sort of ""stole"" from Assassin's Creed.
The plot: Wasn't bad. It was a story of family betrayal and brotherly faith. It showed that the main character could have ruled by the way he is able to gain and manage followers from different lifestyles. The action was pretty good such as the wall walking and special effects.
So..It's not a poorly made movie. It's just not worth the money for the limited and restricted special features. I suggest renting it unless you require the digital copy.",1284508800,,1373,4.325581395348837

4127315,3,B003IHUI0O,"Behold! From the foul stenches of the forgotten genre of time, comes a rollicking fun Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time, a modern CG-filled throwback to those silly Italian sword-and-sandal epics. A deceiving uncle; a man of destiny; a princess who is more than her looks; sword fights and across the desert adventures; yes, we've seen this all before, and better, but that doesn't stop the enjoyment of Prince of Persia. It's a film so keen on non-stop action, that it's entertaining in just that regard. It's brainless entertainment, a fun movie just like the promise of many on a hot summer day, that even in the chilly air conditioned theater, we rarely get. For that, we won't mind the film's flaws.

Don't get too hyped up based on my early praise. The film is rather standard, following Bruckheimer's own Pirates of the Caribbean films closely, and it all whizzes by in predictable fashion. But the first key to enjoying this film is getting by the non-Middle Eastern actors. Once you can buy the fact that you cannot have no-name Iranian actors as leads in a $150 million budgeted film, following a game Jake Gyllenhaal isn't all that bad. True, this is the 6th Century in Persia (now Iran), but hey, the Persian King rescues a young, English boy who has a noble heart, so let's roll with that. Once you do, the rest of the film is pound-for-pound pleasing as any other film of its ilk.

Throughout all of the big special effect sequences, the glue to the film is the fine cast Bruckheimer has rounded up, much like his own Pirates franchise, this is a team effort. Gyllenhaal is fine here; well-toned and lively, but he's far better when he is verbally sparing with the increasing cute Gemma Arterton, as much of their banter is a greatly played. Of course, Sir Ben Kingsley is walking through this, but that doesn't stop him from even phoning in a solid performance as the baddie. To the film's delight, is Alfred Molina as the Sheik Amar. He's hammy and over-the-top, but he gets the tone of the film and is having fun with it all, like the audience. Have I told you about...yes, you have Molina, but tell us again.

Don't sweat it if you enjoy it all, even if the plot is loosely fitted together with all of that sword-and-sandal hokum. It's a jazzed up version of those, as only mega-producer Jerry Bruckheimer can deliver in the summer months. It's entertaining, yet somewhat easily dismissible. It's everything some people love about popcorn movies and everything other people hate about popcorn movies. After you lick your fingers from the greasy popcorn, did you even consider that the film was adapted from a video game?",1284422400,6,2640,4.685344827586207
4127316,5,B003IHUI0O,"Now, this is a movie that deserved better. It is what a true summer blockbuster should be, yet it didn't apparently find an audience. And that's unfair, because this is a pretty entertaining film that keeps you glued to the screen all the way. It has action, romance, humor, and, in the era of special effects, plenty of them.

The story begins in the city of Nasaf, when King Sharaman (Ronald Pickup), impressed by the streets smarts of a homeless kid by the name of Dastan (Jake Gyllenhaal), adopts him to become part of the royal family. All is well for many years, until it is revealed that the neighboring and friendly, holy city of Alamut is selling weapons to the enemy. The king's sons - Tus (Richard Coyle), Garsiv (Toby Kebbell) and Dastan --, together with their uncle Nizam (Ben Kingsley), decide to conduct a preemptive strike against Alamut, try to find the weapons, and bring stability to the region. The King, who knew better, was against the invasion, but accepted his family's explanation and supported them. Unfortunately, an accident happens, in which the king dies, and Dastan is blamed for it. He has to escape and run for his life, in order that he can prove his innocence. He is joined by beautiful Queen Tamina (Gemma Arterton), ruler of Alamut, in the quest for the truth. But the truth is bigger that anything Dastan could imagine, and the answer lies on a sacred dagger that the queen carries with her.

Based on a video game with the same name, and directed by Mike Newell, ""Prince of Persia - The Sands of Time,"" is fun, especially in the scenes involving Sheik Amar (the very versatile Alfred Molina, who steals the film). Of course, you should also expect all the excesses associated with Jerry Bruckheimer, who produced the movie. In the end, you will surely understand when they say, at the beginning of the film, that, ""It is said some lies are linked across time, connected by an ancient calling that echoes through ages."" Furthermore, this business about invading another country because of non-existent weapons sounds familiar, doesn't it? Great idea for many more movies. The fantastic Blu-ray edition is loaded with extras, including DVD and digital copies of the film; deleted scene; making-of documentary; and CineExplore, in which you can unlock the secrets behind forty segments.

4127320,3,B003IHUI0O,"I have been a long time fan of the Prince of Persia series and am of Persian origin myself.  Before its release I crossed my fingers and hoped that it would deliver an exciting taste of the East to the West as well as honor the Prince of Persia game franchise.  After seeing the film, I walked away with a very doused sense of excitement.  Sure it had enough swashbuckling action to rival Pirates of the Carribean but its scale still seems to fall short of the original Sands of Time tale.

The casting should have more or less worked in this film.  Kingsley had done a character of Persian decent in The House of Sand and Fog with minute detail and care.  While there were those out there who claimed that Gyllenhaal is not tan enough to pull off a Persian prince, I do not believe that criticism was valid.  The Persian people were originally an Aryan race and often light skinned.  To this day you will find Iranian citizens with fair skin tones and even blue eyes.  Even the other featured players like Molina were bringing enough to the table to make this work.  Sadly with all the careful consideration made for each character though, they all gave some of the most lackluster performances of their careers.  Everybody just feels like they are joking around and mostly embracing campiness.

In regards to the other elements of the film like costuming, locales, and cinematography; I still have the same unimpressed feeling.  Much of the movie cries more of Arabian Nights rather than Prince of Persia.  While the narrator heralds that the Persian empire stretched vast lands including the far reaches of China, all we are given is the same desert scenery.  Even the game broke up the desert feel with lush palace interiors or amazing exotic exteriors.  The camera does do some nice sweeping shots of the desert ironically but was far too rushed and haggard on the action scenes.

At the end of the day, this film is pretty much the equivalent of an action B-movie rather than an award worthy epic.  Sitting through it was not a boring affair and the special effects will still grab your attention enough to say ""WOW"".  However, in regards to its adaption of the actual game, it feels much too watered down.  I'm not sure how a sequel will fair at this point as this movie was quite a slow start.  I still remain optimistic though that perhaps Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time 2 might improve on the mistakes of its predecessor and come closer to paying homage to the amazing game its based on.",1284076800,,2502,4.565022421524664

I agree with most of the positive reviewers of this film.
It is a very good Saturday matinee popcorn action-packed movie
reminded me of my first viewing of Burt Lancaster's Crimson Pirate
in the early 50's.
I would give it 3 1/2 stars.
It is based on a video game so one should not be too critical of the
storyline which the director Mike Newell did his best to keep it moving
with humor and rousing actions.
Jake Gyllenhaal did a superlative stunt job and Gemma Arterton has a
strong presence and good chemistry with Gyllenhaal.
Ben Kingsley didn't fare well and Alfred Molina was his jaunty self.
The film has very good production value and from the dvd supplements,
one can see the filmmakers, the actors and the crew had a good time
making this film.
Another winner from entertainment guru Jerry Bruckheimer.",1283990400,2,873,4.56687898089172
4127322,5,B003IHUI0O,"This movie came under a lot nit-picking criticism due to the fact that it's a film adaptation of a video game. Track records for video game adaptations being as bad as they are, everyone, including myself, was prepared to hate this movie. I was totally surprised, i loved this movie.

The action scenes were engaging and fun to watch. The editing made it a little difficult to see what was happening at times, but for the most part it was easy to distinguish what was going on. Each action sequence was relevant to the story and came frequently enough to never let the viewer get bored, and not too frequently to detract from the plot or characters.

The characters were all likable and entertaining, if not entirely original. I was sad at the deaths of characters that were meant to sadden the viewers at their demise and was happy with the conclusion of the film. Without giving away any spoilers, i will say i usually hate when any medium of entertainment pulls a huge switch that effects so much of the plot as the one in here, but i actually enjoyed how it played out.

I recommend Prince of Persia to fans of the games along with fans of film",1283644800,3,1148,4.457142857142857

4127324,4,B003IHUI0O,"Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time  was awesome! We have all hesitated when hearing about a video game turned movie is announced, but this is an exception. As recently as standing in line for the movie, I Twittered  to the world that I wasn't all that excited about the film. My wife and I were out and about yesterday and decided to see it anyway, and we both loved it. Let me dive right into the likes and dislikes.

What I liked about the movie:
The Action
Money obviously attracted Disney to this project, but there's more to it. The action portrayed in the video games made for a very interesting concept on screen. Director Mike Newell does a magnificent job with the action. The chase scenes, the Parkour (wall-jumping), the knife fights, etc. All of the above are shot incredibly well. The pacing of the movie is great; there isn't a dull moment in the film, it's always progressing. Thumbs up to Newell on this.

The Actors
At first I thought to myself, ""Jake Gyllenhaal with an English accent is just not going to work"". Well I stand corrected, and Gyllenhaal is awesome in the lead role. He's physically insane in the movie and demands the spotlight. Gemma Arterton does well in the lead female role, and the chemistry between her and Gyllenhaal is great. They have a tough love thing going that works considering Arterton's role in the film. Alfred Molina gives some amazing comic relief in the movie. Not every joke, but for the most part his role is well played. Then there is Sir Ben Kingsley. At this point in his career, his name says it all. He does well considering he is surrounded by a cast half his age. Just great casting all around in this movie.

The Usually Forgotten
The scenery is grand, the sand dunes spectacular and the sets are terrific. The soundtrack is very fitting of a summer blockbuster. As were the costumes and extras. I know I'm gushing about this movie, but really, everything was well done. It has an epic feel to it, until you see the swashbuckling action, it kind of puts it back in perspective. But it has a large scale feel to it.

What I didn't like about the movie:
The Story
I know it's a Disney film aimed at families, but the story is a bit weak. It was too much of the same thing in different settings (albeit beautiful settings). The trailers pretty much give it away. ""The dagger is important, follow the dagger."" Problem is, and I hate when movies do this, ""he has the dagger, no she has the dagger. No wait, he has the dagger. Wait wait, now that guy over there has the dagger."" Enough!

Overall, very satisfied and would be willing to see it again if someone were to ask me. Be weary that it is aimed at kids and families and then you won't be disappointed. The action, the direction, acting and set pieces are all worth your 12 bucks. After you see it, let me know what you think.",1283558400,2,2840,4.42911877394636

4127326,5,B003IHUI0O,"Before we begin: DO NOT READ AMAZON'S MOVIE DESCRIPTION! It gives away too much of the plot.

Now then: I don't hold out much hope for movies based on video games (or films involving Sir Ben Kingsley because of the many flops he's been in during the last decade+), but Prince of Persia (PoP) genuinely surprised me with its depth of characters, fantastic costume design, and entertainment value. I found myself totally immersed in the fiction and loved every moment of this film.

For non-gamers, there's no need to know anything about the games this film is based on. I played the first PoP as a middle school student (20 years ago.. yikes!) and barely remember the basic plot. All you need to know is that this is a fantasy action-adventure set in ancient Persia. It is about love (between a father and his sons, the bond between brothers, and the love of a man and a woman), loyalty, courage, friendship, and betrayal. This kind of story has been done many times, but it's done very well here by Disney, producer Jerry Bruckheimer, and director Mike Newell (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Donnie-Brasco/dp/B000NQPZCO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Donnie Brasco</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Harry-Potter-and-the-Goblet-of-Fire/dp/B000Q6ZG52/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</a>).

It's a ""sword and sandals"" epic: fantastic costumes, lots of sword fights, horses, men in armor, a beautiful princess, and a mystical dagger. For the guys, there's the lovely Gemma Arterton, who plays the same kind of character/love interest as in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Clash-of-the-Titans/dp/B002ZG9788/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Clash of the Titans</a>. She is never difficult to look at. And for the ladies, a beefy Jake Gyllenhaal plays Prince Dastan, the adopted son of the King of Persia, a noble, wise, and just ruler. Dastan is later framed for the murder of his father and spends most of the movie running from his pursuers while trying to restore a sacred artifact to its rightful resting place. Along the way, he meets an cadre of unlikely friends. Though minor characters, they are very well-written and provide some of the film's best moments. I especially liked the gregarious sheikh, played by Alfred Molina (Dr. Octopus from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spider-Man-2/dp/B000UR9T82/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spider-Man 2</a>) and his M'baka companion.

The sets, CG, and costume are all lavishly detailed and superbly designed. Everything looks wonderfully ancient and historically appropriate. The main characters all speak with British accents (and are British actors) though they're supposed to be Persian, but it works! Dastan has some really slick combat choreography. Parts of the film look like another video game, the more recent&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Assassin-s-Creed/dp/B000P46NMA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Assassin's Creed</a>&nbsp;games, both because of the ancient Persian setting and the rooftop acrobatics. Add some super-duper bad-a** assassins and you've got good times here.

A light-hearted and fun movie, this is what summer is all about, with absolutely no WTF moments for me to complain about. Highly recommended.",1283212800,14,3398,6.267665952890792
4127327,5,B003IHUI0O,"I really liked this movie. It had some of the most beautiful scenery I've seen in a film in a long time. While a lot of it was computer generated imagery, these effects were still quite spectacular! The music was great too, a little reminiscent of Pirates of the Caribbean, but powerful enough to move the story.

The story was simple enough; Orphan adopted by the King becomes a prince and conquers another kingdom, captures a mysterious princess and finds a powerful weapon, the Dagger of Time. He then is framed for regicide, and flees with the Princess. They run into a gamblers' camp and cause more mischief. The Prince learns the dagger unlocks the sands of time which can rewind time and if misused will unleash armageddon. After watching those he cares about die one by one, and teaming up with the gamblers, the Prince stops the plot that started with his framing and would have ended in the destruction of the world.

There are a lot of acrobatic chase scenes and swashbuckling fight scenes throughout, and the landscape and views of fictional Persian cities are breath-taking. The parts in between can seem a little dull in comparison, but serve the purpose of building the story and relationship between the Prince and Princess.

Overall, this movie was just a lot of fun to watch over and over again! I saw it in theaters several times and I can't wait to buy it on Blu-ray.",1283040000,4,1387,4.653061224489796
4127328,3,B003IHUI0O,"This movie clearly aims at kids, and teens. It also caters to hard-core video gamers who love Prince of Persia game franchise. There are a lot of jumping just like in the games.

There are many fighting scenes. They look okay. The scenes are colorful and beautiful. The special effects look riveting. For example, the snake scene looks very real.
Jake Gyllenhaal's acting is fun and engaging.  Gemma Arterton's acting is stiff. The time-shifting twist keeps the movie interesting till the end. If you're looking for characters' depth here, you'll be disappointed.

The ostrich racing scene looks original to me. I've never seen something like that before.

This must be what it was like to watch the  newest Douglas Fairbanks movie with all the leaping and derring-do that is to be found in Prince of Persia.  If you can't have fun with this one, you have forgotten everything in life that was fun when you were growing up.  The great Ben Kingsley powers thru his scenes with a lustful sense of villainy, and he is joined by a great cast of largely unknown actors- at least unknown to me.  Gyllenhaal is well supported by a terrific group playing Kings, princes who become Kings, vengeful brothers, and princesses.  Each and every one of them is stellar in their roles.  For those nay-sayers, remember that a lot of people have put down the magic of Ray Harryhausen as old fashioned and hokey, and therefore miss the great fun that is to be had when enjoying that master of illusion.  I'm not saying Prince of Persia is Harryhausen material, but it is great fun for two hours.",1282780800,3,1074,4.411167512690355

The Sorcerer's Apprentice? Definitely not in my to buy movies list and I haven's seen it yet! Jake Gyllenhaal is not an action type actor, Gemma Arterton didn't move the ground under my feet, Alfred Molina looked ridiculous, the only well played characters  were Ben Kingsley's and Gsli -rn Gararsson's (did I managed to write it correctly?), the bad guys.
So don't complain when your 6 year old kid turns 15 and tells you: How could you raise me with this movie?

It's not like they did anything wrong here-production values are good, the acting is decent, the story is okay, I just couldn't get into it.  Perhaps if you were made to care about the characters a little more instead of the characters being so one dimensional it might have been better.  It's kind of hard to say.  This was one of the movies I was most looking forward too this summer and it just really didn't deliver.  I did buy the soundtrack though, because personally, I thought the score was the highlight of the movie.  That should tell you something.",1281571200,5,691,4.669421487603306
4127332,4,B003IHUI0O,"Like a lot of people I have been playing the ""Prince of Persia"" video games since ""The Sands of Time"" came out for Ninetendo Gamecube way back when.
I fell in love with that game and the franchise, so when I heard they were doing a live action film my first impression was...WHY???
Then I heard they cast Jake Gyllenhaal. (Going forward I will call him JG)
Granted JG's a great actor, ""Brokeback Mountain"", ""Jarhead"", ""Zodiac"".
JG's one of the most underrated and underappreciated actors in Hollywood.
But JG as The Prince of Persia???
I had my doubts.
The only actor I knew in the movie was Ben Kingsley, so I knew HE would at least add a touch of class and excellence to the movie and he does.
Now....I wasn't expecting this movie to be a masterpiece and it wasn't...not by a long shot.
But for a video game to film translation...this movie is probably the best of the bunch.
Anyone who's seen any of the game to movie translations will probably agree with me that thanks to Uwe Boll the majority of these movies have been simply horrid.
Thankfully ""Prince"" does not suffer the same fate.
As for JG playing the Prince.
There is one scene where I really went...OMG he DOES look just like the Prince.
Not the Prince from ""Sands of Time"" but the grizzly one from the second game ""The Warrior Within"".
The hair, the beard, the outfit, he's a dead ringer except for his big eyes kind of ruin the effect.

Ok but besides that what is good?
The script is excellent.
The acting is top notch and for a movie like this is almost unheard of.
The FX are of course simply the best you could hope for but the film hardly relies on FX and instead uses them to compliment the story.
All the Prince's moves are accounted for. The platforming, the wall runs, etc... without looking fake or corny.
The sand rewind was just as I expected it to be, awesome.

What was bad?
Parts of it were corny and hokey.
The ostrich races and that whole gang of comic relief characters could have been cut out of the film entirely.
The film itself is WAY too long.
At almost two hours I literally had to force myself from falling asleep during the middle part of the movie.
A half hour could have been trimmed easily and nothing would have been lost.
In fact a movie like this almost has to move at a breakneck pace to match the subject matter.
But it didn't.
Those minor points aside I'll sum up ""Prince of Persia"" like this.

Excellent story.
Excellent acting.
Not so good pacing.
Great FX.
Recommended?
If you have the patience for two hours and are as big a fan of the video games as I am, then yes.
The rest of you may want to wait.
Me?
I thought it was a great popcorn movie and I look forward to the next one.

Okay the above was written when they wanted over forty dollars for it.  Now that they've dropped it to a reasonable if still a wee bit high price...I'm going to go for it simply because I want them to keep making this kind of movie and if they want a little extra profit to cushion the poor theater showing...I'll open the wallet a little wider than usual this once.",1281398400,4,677,4.1692307692307695

I have been an avid fan of the film industry since I was a kid, and I own over 700 movies. There's my cred.
  Do not listen to the crackpot at the bottom of the page. I have not only played every Prince of Persia game, but I was a serious doubter in the video game to film adaption of this (kept replaying the nightmare that was ""Doom""). I was extremely surprised. I am not a Jake Gyllenhall fan, but I am a Bruckheimer fan. And, I am, for the most part, a Disney fan. Apparently the reviewer at the bottom cant accurately critique a Disney film, because he doesn't even appreciate what was ""Pirates"".
  Prince of Persia delivers in every way imaginable, and reminded me why I loved going to the movies in the first place. Is Jake Leo DiCapprio in a Scorcese film? Of course not. Is the movie realistic? Of course not, its a DISNEY FANTASY MOVIE. If you think it should be realistic, then you are the reason for the ""do not try this at home"" warnings on TV that the rest of the known world finds insulting. Is the movie well acted? Absolutely, for the type of movie. Is the action in the movie sufficient? More than. Is the movie enjoyable? Hell yea! I had a blast. I loved the chemistry between Jake and Gemma, and thought Bruckheimer made a convincing and thoroughly thought through story for a game that really didn't have that thorough a plot line to begin with. Excellent score for Disney, and it would make a grand classic for the whole family if added to your collection. I can't wait for it to come out.",1280793600,197,1714,4.280864197530864

I thought it was excellent & no I am not a fangirl or fanboy, I have just been a movie buff my whole life. I thought Gyllenhaal did a great job considering he did most of his own stunts & looked very much like the PoP video game character. Plus he brought a lot of wit & charm to the character & there was quite a bit of chemistry between him & Gemma who was exquisitely beautiful, wonderful, & feisty as Tamina.  My only problem with this movie is there won't be a sequel since the US did not embrace this movie like they did overseas. However, it was fun, exciting, had beautiful cinematography with the Moroccan landscapes & deserts. The only CGI special effects were the turn back time sequences, & a few other places with the sand glass. It had quite a few teaching moments too, which makes it a great family film & for kids of all ages to enjoy. Bruckheimer movies are always big budget flicks & it shows in every way. There definitely was no cutting corners here, you could really tell. One more thing I want to add is the Parkour stunts were beautifully choreographed, that was an excellent idea to get David Belle to teach Gyllenhaal the art of Parkour, so they looked real. FYI to you naysayers, there is such a thing as suspension of disbelief & a good imagination that one must have to thoroughly lose yourself in a fantasy type movie as this is so you can enjoy it for what it is, otherwise, you waste the whole movie thinking about the stunts & events in it are impossible & illogical.",1280707200,217,1599,4.312292358803987

I like Jake Gyllenhaal and I knew he had the acting chops to bring this epic video game adaptation to life. However, I'm not sure what Gyllenhaal was doing during this movie, but it certainly wasn't acting. Both him and Gemma Arterton failed to unite any sparks to carry the movie through the dull patches (and believe me, there are lots of those), and Ben Kingsley plays one of the most unconvincing villains I have seen in awhile. To me, this film seemed like the ""Pirates of the Carribbean"" films, but without the wit or charm of Johnny Depp's immortal Captain Jack Sparrow. If you ever wondered what it would be like if ""Pirates"" didn't have Depp to stir things up between the lifeless relationship between dull Will Turner and boring Elizabeth Swan, see ""Prince of Persia"" and you'll see it for what it is: Pure torture.

I'm a big fan of the video game franchise and it's sister series, Assassin's Creed. Because of that I appreciated the winks to the gamers the movie makers inserted here and there, like Dastan standing on a wooden outcropping with the camera swooping around behind him to take in the scenery and the collapse of the temple where he ""surfs"" through the sand. I jokingly told my sister who was watching with me, ""Hey, I remember that level! It was hard!"" Jake Gyllenhal is darling as Dastan, the doe-eyed Prince of Persia, (love those baby blues!) a character that comes across as surprisingly wholesome and innocent considering he's a grown man and a skilled warrior. The Prince is sweet, unassuming and a bit naive but also honorable, endearing and extremely hot. I watched this with my sons ages 9 & 12 and they both thought it ""was the coolest movie ever!"". As one of the critics said the writing could have used some work, it was definitely a bit clunky and forced at times. If you're looking for a deep introspective make-you-think type movie, keep looking. But if you're just looking for a really enjoyable way to spend an afternoon then definitely pick up this fun and funny movie that doesn't try to take itself too seriously.

4127340,3,B003IHUI0O,"It should surprise no one that the Prince of Persia: the Sands of Time isn't what one would call cinematic genius. It has a few things going against it. First, it is based off of a video game. It is well chronicled that no movie based off of a video game ever gets beyond ""fun"" (and perhaps ""witty"")  with its storyline. More often then not the standard reaction is ""I just wasted two hours that I could have spent contemplating the universe."" Second, I start to worry when movies seem so effects driven. I want story. The Prince of Persia manages to more or less wreck its story impact at the end, but keeps a certain level of humor that had me grinning every time I facepalmed.

The writing is so-so, as I mentioned before. It certainly wasn't the worst movie I've seen this year, but the plot was pretty predictable. An orphan is adopted by the king, king's relatives start power grabbing and blame everything on the adopted son. Adopted son tries to clear name and save everyone. Wash, rinse, repeat. Do not use bleach. I can't say that there was all that much to the performances by the main characters except that they were all right, but nothing spectacular. The banter between Dastan and Tamina tended towards the mildly witty, but away from the clever repartee I found the dialog mildly pompous. It wasn't awful, it just seemed a bit stuffy in places. The bad guy was pretty standard and decently acted, but nothing particularly spectacular. I did like that the brothers were unwittingly aiding the big conspiracy against the throne.

And then there's the ending. I loathe any variation of ""it was only a dream"" when ending any kind of story. I think it's a lazy cop out that effectively invalidates the narrative and waters down any point that the storyteller was trying to make. I would be considerably more intrigued with this film if it didn't go back to a saved game at the end. The sad end would have worked with the story and the conclusion could have been so much more philosophical than the ""happily ever after"" they used.

There are some saving moments to this movie. Sheik Amar was funny every step of the way. I loved his jokes about taxes and how he was unabashedly a conniving clown. I liked the ostrich races too. The first few rewind scenes with the dagger are also pretty funny.

I'd wait for the rental, but it's well worth the effort to sit around with some friends and throw popcorn at. Just be sure to remember to play either ""Time Warp"" from Rocky Horror or ""If I Could Turn Back Time"" by Cher during the ending credits.",1277337600,,2551,4.5249457700650755
4127341,4,B003IHUI0O,"As a fan of the video games, Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time certainly looked like it followed the games pretty closely. But trailers for films based on video games had been misleading in the past and it's safe to say that while every one of those films isn't flat out terrible, they were all pretty disappointing and weren't nearly as good as their source material. At this point though, it looks like Walt Disney Pictures has released the most satisfying video game film adaptation to date.

Jake Gyllenhaal was certainly a pleasant surprise as street beggar turned prince character known as Dastan. He was pretty much the last person on everyone's mind to fill the wall running shoes of the prince in this film, but he managed to get into the shape of his career, film some incredible action sequences, and be witty and charming at the same time. Ben Kingsley and Alfred Molina have great supporting roles, as well. Sheik Amar (Molina) shines because of his character's underhandedness and Nizam (Kingsley) has a smarminess to him that truly shines when his plans begin to crumble. Gemma Arterton was the only one who didn't really seem to deliver. Other than her role being rather similar to her role in Clash of the Titans, she's dull and generally shows no emotion at all the majority of the time other than looking like she'll burst into tears at any given moment.

The film was certainly able to accomplish capturing the look and feel of the video games. Other than the incredible locations where the film was shot getting the credit for that, the special effects deserve to be mentioned, as well. The vast cities, menacing sandstorms, and sands of time spectacles are pulled off because of the spectacular CGI and they don't disappoint. Other than a few minor instances, the special effects could arguably be the best part of the film.

Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time delivers an extraordinarily entertaining action adventure that contains enough material from the video games to satisfy fans while including a relatively talented cast and jaw dropping special effects.

4127343,3,B003IHUI0O,"Prince of Persia: Sands of Time is a Walt Disney/Jerry Buckheimer Picture set in ancient Persia (now known as Iran).  The movie, although somewhat ""cheesy"" at times, is overall entertaining and a fun interlude for family oriented entertainment.  I was pleasantly surprised that Jake Gyllenhaal could pull off a swashbuckler role as naturally as he did.

Jake Gyllenhaal plays a smart, fast-witted adopted prince named Dastan.  His father, the King of Persia,  found him as an orphaned poor boy in a marketplace and saw something special in his demeanor and reaction to threats.  Dastan grew up with the King's two biological sons and they accepted him as their own.  When the three princes traveled together, they were doing their father's work checking on the desert cities of the Persian Kingdom.  There is also an evil Uncle i(Ben Kingsley) to make the story interesting.  The movie shows the princes and soldiers coming upon a city they debate whether to raid.  At this point, the movie gets interesting.  Paths seem to diverge as Dastan and a mysterious princess Tamina (Gemmea Arterton) band together to protect an ancient dagger that can release the Sands of Time.  This is a gift from the gods that can reverse time and only the possessor knows what has happened.

The special effects keep you interested, as well as the time rewinding sequences.  The film gives plenty of action scenes, including a crazy ostrich race, and characters that keep an interesting story overall.  The kids will love it.

Jake Gyllenhaal is the new hero of the year !

I can't wait for the second film to come !!!!!",1275868800,5,123,3.88
4127345,5,B003IHUI0O,"Wow!  I LOVED it!  Just saw this one in the theater. It was about 2 hours of practically non-stop adventure.  Disney flicks have come a long way!  Thank you, Walt, for paving the way.

Our story begins in ancient Persia.  The king has a couple of sons already when he comes upon a young orphan boy who displays unusual courage to help another boy.  The king admires the orphan and adopts him, making him another son (and another prince.)  He is raised as a brother/son/prince.  (Pardon me if I misspell any of these names.)  Dastan (Jake Gyllenhaal) is the orphan.  Prince Tusk is the eldest son and the future heir to the throne.  Ben Kingsley plays an advisor to the king and the trusted uncle to the sons of the king, including Dastan.

Dastan is a very spirited, street-smart young man.  He does not act snooty and he is not afraid to fight.  When Prince Tusk receives information that the Holy City of Alamut is making weapons to be used against the Persian kingdom, the sons decide to attack.  It is in Alamut that we see Dastan's bravery and fighting skills and we meet the beautiful Princess Kamina (Gemma Arterton). We also learn that the Princess is the guardian of a very special dagger, one that is capable of going back in time, with the potential to alter events of the past. (You can surely imagine that the bad guys would want the dagger.)

There are lots of acrobatic stunts, CGI, tons of practically non-stop action, adventure, betrayal, assassins, impossible odds, mystical happenings, treachery, greed, power, and destiny with a little love and spirituality to boot.  You even get to see ostrich races.

Great story!",1275696000,3,1636,4.67719298245614

Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time
Synopsis
The king of Persia adopts a boy from the streets as his son after an act of courage. Dastan grows up to be a fighter, however his brothers and uncle turn on him. He flees into the desert with a princess and a murderous horde attempting to steal the dagger he acquired in his last battle.

Review
My disclaimer is that I have never played the Prince of Persia video games. Though I can always tell a video game sequence homage, and this movie certainly pays it's dues to the look and feel of the actual games. Disney managed to recapture some of the magic that they had created with the original Pirates of the Caribbean minus the overly annoying Keira Knightly. It also has the random accents found in so many Disney movies. Jake Gyllenhaal is good looking and easy to love, though lacking in any kind of deep thought. The plot moves quickly, and the visual effects are great. The fight sequences are a little choppy, but very reminiscent of game play. There are some very funny moments, such as a rant about taxes and ostrich races. Overall, I found the movie to be pretty entertaining, not revolutionary or anything, but fun.

My Recommendation
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time is a fun movie, worth seeing in the theater. I don't say that about many movies... :)",1275523200,2,1397,4.4921259842519685

4127348,3,B003IHUI0O,"The sight of Jake Gyllenhaal in a defiantly heroic pose with his imposing dagger on the poster of this 2010 fantasy adventure would seem to portend a film filled with self-parody, but alas, the actor takes the Aladdin-like title role semi-seriously. He's actually better than expected in the over-the-top derring-do role, but the movie itself is absurdly convoluted and overly ridiculous, even by the standards of the 2003 video game which inspired this CGI-saturated production. It should come as no surprise that the executive producer is action-schlock master Jerry Bruckheimer, whose commercial track record extends from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Beverly-Hills-Cop/dp/B00005JKCB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Beverly Hills Cop</a>&nbsp;to the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/National-Treasure/dp/B00005JN5E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">National Treasure</a>&nbsp;franchise. What did surprise me is that the director is Mike Newell, better known for soft, female-oriented fare such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Enchanted-April/dp/B00005JL1R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Enchanted April</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Four-Weddings-and-a-Funeral/dp/B00000JRTX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Four Weddings and a Funeral</a>. However, both he and Gyllenhaal give themselves almost entirely to Bruckheimer's more commercial, comic-book sensibilities.

The fanciful plot takes place in the sixth century B.C. where we find a Persian street urchin named Dastan being adopted by King Sharaman for his courageous acrobatics in a crowded marketplace. He grows up with his loyal foster brothers Garsiv and Tus, the rightful heirs to the throne who lead the Persian army in an attack on the sacred city of Alamut. In a none-too-subtle allusion to current-day Iraq, the siege on Alamut comes from a wrongful assumption that the city's people are selling weapons to their enemies. Behind the assault is the King's brother and trusted advisor, the Dick Cheney-like Nizam. Elsewhere in the city, Dashan leads a swashbuckling rogue effort that leads him to the comely Princess Tamina who holds the secret behind the mythical Dagger of Time. The dagger has time-bending powers that allow the user to undo any mistake and redo any moment. In short order, Dashan gets framed for murder and escapes with Tamina and the dagger.

All sorts of contrived shenanigans subsequently follow with the addition of Sheik Amar, an ostrich-racing thief who amusingly hates both taxes and the confining role of government, as the dagger elusively changes hands and a fatalistic sinkhole yields an ending that may remind you of Pam's unexpected discovery of Bobby in the shower on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dallas/dp/B000PAAK0A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dallas</a>. Aside from Gyllenhaal's muscular performance, Gemma Arterton (a memorable bit as Strawberry Fields in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Quantum-of-Solace/dp/B001PPLIEG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Quantum of Solace</a>) makes a fetching princess with plenty of predictable moxy. As Nizam, Ben Kingsley is not nearly as embarrassing here as he was in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Love-Guru/dp/B0013J30YU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Love Guru</a>, but his Oscar will continue collecting dust by itself with his string of disappointing movie choices. The ethnically versatile Alfred Molina steals the film in an act of petty larceny as the comical sheik. With so many special effects coming at the viewer uninterrupted, it was extremely difficult to find a core of humanity in this whole venture. But that's Bruckheimer's objective after all - to overwhelm your senses until you turn into the exact same pulp he chooses to present to all the fanboys and fangirls who will flock to this paper-thin extravaganza.",1275436800,3,4070,6.947265625
4127349,4,B003IHUI0O,"Ah, lovely Persia, circa something BC. A land of graceful minarets, beautiful landscapes and a dagger that controls the fate of humanity. Yes, kids, it's time of year again: time for the summer popcorn action movies!

This particular one is an adaptation of the popular video game series, Prince of Persia. Now I've not played it, and haven't any real desire to start (I'm still trying to finish Assassin's Creed II), but if this movie is anything to go by it looks like it's probably fairly decent.

The film centers around an orphan boy, Dastan (played as an adult by Jake Gyllenhaal, a man who has never been introduced to a close shave). He gets adopted by the king of what appears to be an alternate history version of Persia. I'll have to write an article on my blog that goes into more detail on that and my guesses on how such a timeline came about. No life, you see. Anyhow, Dastan goes to the palace and gets raised by the king along with his two new brothers. Also present is the king's brother, played by Ben Kingsley in a role so telegraphed he might as well have had ""I'm a scheming vizier!"" tattooed onto his forehead.

Anyhow, the good prince gets caught up in an invasion of a holy city that appears to be at least somewhat Jewish in its holiness, but not quite. More on this later. Suffice to say that the invasion (staged on the pretext of finding weapons factories, as I roll my eyes), is a success, more or less, though in the after party the king is killed, Dastan is framed for his death, goes on the run with a princess/priestess from the city and is now carrying a magical dagger that can turn back time in 30 second intervals.

From there he goes on a nice travelogue of places that are apparently right near the city all the action has been happening in. He meets a man who races ostriches (played with manic glee by Alfred Molina), his knife-throwing Sudanese henchman, several assassins and, of course, develops an attraction to the woman he's on the run with (we know in advance this will happen because she clearly hates him on first sight).

The plot is pretty basic, predictable and paint-by-numbers but somewhat to my surprise I didn't hate it. I liked this movie, actually, quite a bit more than I'd expected that I would. Its action scenes are decent, the dialogue is humorous when it needs to be, everyone involved seemed to be having a good time and it had a nice level of energy, though it did drag a bit in the second and third acts.

Overall if you want basic escapism, this is a good movie to escape with. It's hardly great cinema, but it doesn't need to be, really. It is what it is and what it is is pretty decent.",1275350400,5,2658,4.414285714285715
4127350,5,B003IHUI0O,"I really liked this movie, I will go to the theater to see it again and I will buy it on DVD. Many people have pointed out the basics, but I wanted to point out the things that made this such a good film for me.

The lead characters looked really good and have great onscreen chemistry. I never really thought of Jake as super sexy before this film, but that buff body, long dark hair, big blue eyes and wicked smile were stunning. (He should have left his hair long after filming). I cried twice during the movie. That is how invested I felt in these two.

I liked the moral message about letting your heart guide you to doing what is right, no matter what others are saying. This ruffian thief brought heart to the royal family and I liked that.

I love good CGI and this film's CGI was outstanding. Not once did I see something that stood out as fake or poorly done. This movie is based off an action adventure game with a character that jumps, twirls and slides. That is exactly what they gave us.

Some people keep comparing it to Pirates of the Caribbean and saying it is lacking because the Johnny Depp humor wasn't their. I don't think this movie was meant to be anything like that film. This lead character is a ruffian, but not a fool. To have given this film a character that couldn't be taken seriously, would have taken the heart away from it. I actually preferred this film over the Pirates films. Don't get me wrong, I really liked them, but they were dark and I never felt invested in their characters. Good acting in the Pirates, but not a lot of chemistry, which Prince or Persia has.

Not one minute during this movie was I bored. The action really makes this a go see on screen film, not a wait until dvd one.",1275350400,10,1729,4.275229357798165
4127351,5,B003IHUI0O,"I have no experience with the video game The Prince of Persia but having seen the trailers for the film, week after week, I was interested in seeing the film.  I like tales set in mythic times so The Prince of Persia had an appeal, which was completely fulfilled by the film.

I have revealed some of the story, below, so those who have not seen the movie might want to skip the next two paragraphs.

The story centers on Dastan (Jake Gyllenhaal), a boy of the streets, who is adopted by the king of Persia for his bravery and coming to assist those in need.  The king already has two sons, Tus and Garsiv, and his adoption of Dastan comes from a prophecy.  Dastan grows up to be a clever warrior and a voice of reason for his older brothers.  The story revolves around that taking of the Holy City of Alamut.  Dastan is against storming the city until evidence is presented that the inhabitants are forging weapons that will be used against the Persians by other enemies.  Ben Kingsley plays the king's brother who presents a mask of the perfect advisor to his nephews.  The city is captured and Dastan comes into possession of the true reason the city was captured: a dagger that hold inside it magical sand that can reverse time.  The dagger is guarded by a princess named Tamina (played by Gemma Arterton) who contrives to steal the dagger.

The king of Persia arrives at the Alamut, and is poisoned from a gift given to him by Dastan.  Dastan must flee and prove his innocence.  Along the way, is a humorous encounter with an ostrich racing, tax-evading sheik played by Alfred Molina.  Dastan and the princess trade the dagger back and forth, and are pursued by sinister assassins.

I was unsure if Jake Gyllenhaal would make an effective action-romantic hero, but he does a magnificent job with the role. He has good on screen chemistry with Gemma Arterton. The production is sumptuous and the costume designers produced some stunning costumes. Several reviewers have said the dialogue was tiresome and the editing choppy but I did not find that to be the case. The Prince of Persian is a fantastic adventure in the tradition of the tales of the Arabian Nights.  When the film was over, I would have happily seen it again.",1275350400,8,2228,4.574307304785894
4127352,1,B003IHUI0O,"""Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time"" is just plain stupid. This is a perfect example of a film that thinks by having lavish production design and loads of CGI, that that makes up a story. Obviously it does not. What little story there is, is extremely contrived and boring beyond belief. Jake Gyllenhaal and Gemma Arterton, while looking the parts, are flat and annoying. The film is just so choppy with it's editing, it's added effects filters, and muddled dialogue that you pretty much have no idea what is going on. Walt Disney Pictures keeps cranking out terrible, unforgivably bad pictures in 2010 (yes, I'm looking at you ""Alice in Wonderland"") that it makes me question the future of this once reliable studio and it's summer tent pole films.",1275264000,10,750,4.776923076923077
4127353,5,B003IHUI0O,"So, I just came from the movie P of P and was delighted with the entire film. Prince Dastan looked good enough to bed as well as displaying those manly talents most mythic heros are obliged to possess these days. The action was, well relentless and the princess almost as beautiful as she was in ""St. Trinians"".  Who said she was fat??  The CGI was great as it was not overdone, choppy, and slap dash, it just flowed with the film.  Very good.  The story was simple with a bit of a tweak.  Just right with some loop holes and lagging logic, but so much fun compared to COTT (remake). I liked the fact that the romance @ the end of the movie is actually a courtship to develop, perhaps a nod in the direction of sequal.  My movie mate didn't fall asleep either, which he usually does, but stayed eyed to the action.  Yes, I wil buy this moviewhen it comes out. I rejected COTT.",1275177600,7,876,4.240963855421687
4127354,4,B003IHUI0O,"This was a fun movie! Despite what critics say, this was a very fun movie! Given, you can't take Jake Gylenhaal seriously, but he does well playing The Prince. (Think Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow) While I don't want to fully compare this to many films, it still has elements from many great films. Obviously, it's got an Aladdin feel to it, (An orphan boy who is taken in by royalty, and not that bad with parkour, who meets a beautiful princess. (Who is played by Gemma Arterton, best known for her roles as Agent Fields in Quantum of Solace and Io in Clash of the Titans). It's also somewhat like any number of films about finding ancient artifacts (National Treasure, Indiana Jones).

This is a somewhat predictable film, if you just think of every movie you've seen, you can most likely see the ending by about 40 minutes into the film. That being said, this is not a movie to be passed by. Jake and Gemma are great at acting, Alfred Molina, (Who was Dr. Octopus in Spider-Man 2) plays the comic relief Sheik.) And Ben Kingsley plays the Uncle of the Princes. All are great actors/actresses.

************SPOILER WARNING****************

The main starter is that Dastan is a young 10ish aged orphan who stops another boy from getting beaten by guards. Then he jumps over rooftops, and does other crazy parkour stuff, just to be caught by the guards. Just before being executed he is rescued by the King of Persia himself. The King takes Dastan in as one of his own sons and so he becomes a Prince of Persia. That's the first 10 minutes or so.

**********END SPOILER WARNING*************

So all in all this is a genuine 3-4 star movie, one to be put on your summer movie list. I loved the film, so did everyone I saw it with. This may not be one to pay over $10 a pop, but the Matinee showtimes are a great way to go for this film. Great acting, but some of the parkour scenes are a little funny as they film it in a Matrix-like way with them moving at slow speed. A great film all the way, though not one to be taken seriously, just go to the theater in a state of mind of this being a fun, but not too crazy or serious film and you should like it. There are one or two scenes that might be scary to kids, like a guy getting burned by something and people trying to save him, and some action scenes that are a little crazy. Some may find it scary, but I don't know if this warranted a PG-13 rating, well, it may have just barely stepped over that line.",1275177600,6,2456,4.318872017353579
4127355,3,B003IHUI0O,"First of all let me tell you this: This is Not Pirates of the Caribbean, so for the ones who like (or like me love) the pirates trilogy you better start lowering your expectations when you walk into this film.
When I heard about Prince of Persia I did not pay too much attention to it. It did not interest me the way pirates did so when I went to see it I did not expect anything spectacular. Well, let me tell you that I was reasonably satisfied throughout the film.

Like any Bruckheimer film, Prince of Persia offers a spectacular scenery with tons of elaborate action sequences, elaborate costumes, elaborate makeup, elaborate chase scenes and elaborate special effects. The locations are fantastic and you can see the amount of work the crew had to do in order to achieve this epic. The plot is interesting enough to keep you entertained and the cast acts reasonably okay. I was surprised that I was enyojing the film more than I expected and overall it is a good summer film. The score by Harry Gregson-Williams really adds to what you are seeing in the screen.

Now, the bad stuff. Though the plot is interesting, some lack in the script prevents the film to achieve new heights. This is no help when you have one-note characters in the entire film. When I said the cast acted reasonably fine, is because I think that the actors did the best with characters that can't be worked too much. So if you were expecting another Jack Sparrow, well, don't expect too much. Dastan is your typical hero with typical hero problems and typical hero quests. I think Jake Gyllenhaal did a fair job with the character but he is not Johnny Depp and Dastan is not Jack Sparrow. Other lacking characters were Princess Tamina and Nizam (the villain). The first is played by Gemma Arterton who I think was the low point in terms of acting. The latter is played by the great Ben Kingsley who unfortunately does not have enough material to work with. Don't expect villains like Barbossa or Davy Jones because Nizam is your typical villain without any charm. The high point was Alfred Molina as a dishonest trader who was at the same time comic relief and the best character in the film.

Overall, with this minor problems, I was enjoying the film until we reached the end. It was utterly disappointing making the whole plot of the film to not have any sense. I won't spoil anything but let me tell you that the end was the reason I graded the film 3 stars instead of four. Let's hope that if there are any sequels, they will work this out in the next one.

Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time was a pleasant experience and a good summer film. It has some problems (especially the end) that prevents it to become something greater but overall it serves its purpose of entertaining and it is better than some things out there. If you go with low or mild expectations, you will be fine.

PD: Can't wait to see Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides (May 20, 2011).",1275177600,,2951,4.487895716945996
4127356,4,B003IHUI0O,"Out of the gate:  What a fun Arabian adventure -- oh, yeah, Persian, right.  Jake Gyllenhaal is no Laurence of Arabia but cuts a swath as a troublesome boy who grows to be a troublesome prince; when others are seriously engaged, he's street-fighting.  When others are telling him not to attack first, he does anyway.  What a brat!

It's the typical ""it's OK to undermine authority because it will turn out OK anyway"" mentality and it seems to work in this film.  Jake as the Prince has amazing, almost super-human acrobatic abilities.  He can climb arrows and jump rooftops with the greatest of ease.

And never breaks a sweat!

Our desert fox (Gemma Arterton), however, the inevitable beautiful Princess, is the holder of a magic dagger that can turn back time for a few minutes thanks to some magic sand which came from some gods which were going to destroy Man but decided to let it go by coming up with the magic sand gimmick and...

Yeah, complicated.  But that's OK!

The evil uncle who wants it all for himself.  The cast of thousands (of CGI soldiers) who die for the cause.

And the eviller (""eviller?"") Hassasins who have these Ninja abilities and throw these spikes from bracelets.  The knife scenes are cool as they fly through the air; the slo-mo jumping and hitting, the swords flashing and the cool desert sunrise.

And who knew that ostriches could be so much fun?

Ah, the Prince.  Mistaken identity, false accusation.  Works for Hitchcock, not sure about this one, though.

As far as fantasy is concerned, it has its requisite beautiful princess, a devil-may-care hero, a bad guy and a quest.  And when you get to the end, nobody dies!

Yes, a Disney production.  Some scenes may be much for children.

4127357,4,B003IHUI0O,"I wasn't expecting much with yet another video game adaptation, a genre that rarely rises above horrible, but Prince of Persia: The Sand of Time manages to be very fun, without the heavy cheese of say The Mummy series. Don't get me wrong, there is no room for any kind of thinking when watching it, but I didn't find myself laughing at how lame it all was.

I think Disney expects their to be a series of movies, much like Pirates of the Caribbean, but without the acting skills and star power of someone like Johhny Depp, I just don't see it capturing the public's interest like those films did. Plus, pirates are just cooler than princes.

The acting is better than I think most would expect. Jake Gyllenhaal is actually quite convincing as an action hero, Ben Kingsley didn't overact like I'm sure he wanted too when attached to a project like this, Gemma Atterton gets more and more beautiful with each movie I've seen her in (Quantum of Solace and Clash of the Titans being the only other two), but the real star of the show is Alfred Molina. He takes what could have been just some forgettable secondary character and turns in a funny performance that adds life to whatever scene he is in. Not Oscar worthy stuff of course, but a character that the audience can't help but cheer on. Jake and Gemma also have decent chemistry.

The music has some good desert flavor and the CGI is of the good quality. The action scenes are at least interesting, rather than dull, thanks to Jake's character jumping and flipping around like a circus performer. The story isn't anything special, but it's simple and light enough to please most people of any age. Same goes for the dialogue, but thankfully there is some humor and very little cringe-worthy moments.

Is Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time really worthy of 4 out of 5 stars. No, not really. It falls somewhere in between average and good, but for pure entertainment value, 4 seems a bit closer to the truth than 3.
