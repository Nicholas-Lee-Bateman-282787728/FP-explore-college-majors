8443349,5,B004VGH63I,"If you are serious about selling real estate, and dominating your market, this is the ""must have"" video. Your competitor's property tours look like they were cuts from The Blair Witch...yours could look like a Hollywood production. If you are the broker of your office, just buy it and let all of your agents watch it! It will make you more money and increase your office's professional image.

I just finished watching this video now and will start implementing what I have learned immediately! Watch my YouTube channel ""ElementsRealtyGroup"" to see how I grow my video tour library and listings! Next I am buying a Glidecam and Camera Slider.",1373328000,2,643,4.89908256880734

When one of my major clients decided to go for virtual video tours, I had to get on the bandwagon or get left in the dust. With no knowledge of video, my first step was to find an expert who could help me. I live in a very small town with few resources, so I scanned the Internet and found this video. It worked! Eric Ristau, the instructor, was very clear, concise and thorough. I took his advice, bought a Canon DSLR, used the tips he presented and completed my first video, which brought rave reviews from my clients and other Realtors. I am now in the virtual tour business, thanks in large part to this video. It was better than I expected. The one element I still must work on and that I wish had been covered more thoroughly is the flycam; I am still trying to learn how to balance and use it. Kudos to Real Estate Film School and Eric.",1333152000,10,1270,5.654450261780105

editing or uploading to the web. Then I discovered the two hour plus Real Estate
Film School DVD, which teaches step by step, everything you need to know about
producing a professional quality digital film.

The instructor, a professional cinematographer and editor, takes you through the
complete process, from filming to completely finishing your project on your PC.
If you speak English, and have the ability to focus on the spoken word, you'll
have no problem learning everything you'll need to know to turn out a production
or presentation you'll be proud of.

The advantage in learning from a DVD over going to expensive workshops is
obvious. If you miss a point, simply rewind your DVD and concentrate a little
harder.

The Real Estate Film School DVD was actually designed for the real estate
professional to develope his video tours quickly and easily, and the DVD's comprehensive, easy to understand information does that. But, it doesn't end
there. The DVD is a great investment for young filmmakers who wish to advance
their career. Everything you need to know is here, so go for it!",1314403200,2,1175,4.924242424242424
