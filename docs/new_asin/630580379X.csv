1082423,4,630580379X,"Project A the movie is a Jackie Chan classic.  Doesn't have a great story,  but it's not bad enough to detract from the action, and it's well paced.  The action scenes are some of Chan's most inventive.  Unfortunately the DVD  doesn't take advantage of some of the benefits of DVD's, namely the option  of viewing the original cantonese soundtrack with subtitles.  Why not let  people choose how to watch it.  But an even bigger gripe from this release  is the fact that they cut out the outtakes from the end.  That's a Chan  trademark!  The original version featured several takes of his insane clock  tower fall.  Anyway, it's worth a view, but if you're thinking about buying  it, try to look for a Hong Kong DVD.",960249600,,717,4.571428571428571
1082424,2,630580379X,"In my opinion the original Chinese language version of Project A is one of  Jackie Chan's best films.  A film full of great stunts and some of the best  fight scenes of any Jackie Chan movie.  This version however is extremely  poor.  I was very excited when I saw this release in the video store on  DVD.  I have a subtilted video tape and I have been waiting for it's  release on DVD.  However I became leary when I recalled the recent release  of Jet Li's Fist of Legend and other recent English dubbed Hong Kong action  movies like Iron Monkey, Police Story 1 and 2 and Black Mask.  It seems to  me that the people involved in these re-releases have no respect for these  great movies.  It many cases, especially Jackie Chan's movies, scenes are  edited out, the original score is replaced by inferior music, profanity is  added and the English duubed voices are just horrible and at times  downright goofy.  The English language versions are so inferior to ther  originals that it is not even funny.  Often times these films come off as  comedies because of the horrible dubbing.  Project A is no exception.  What was once a serious action movie, with some comedic touches, is now a  goofy, wateredowned movie.  The voices can not be taken seriuosly.  The new  score is just ok, the original was so much better.  The new score actually  slows down the action sequences and eliminates most of the tension that was  in the original.  I was extremely disappointed with this DVD.  I might  recommend it to anyone who has not seen the original version and is curious  about early Jackie Chan.  However I will stick with my subtitled video  tape.",960076800,77,1645,4.583333333333333
1082425,5,630580379X,"The only thing in Project A that doesn't measure up to the rest of the Dimension releases of the Chan catalogue is cinematography.  Like so many other Hong Kong movies of its time, the camera work and the aesthetics  simply don't measure up and have dated badly.
But that should be no  reason for you to miss a rousing good time filled with martial-arts action,  endearingly corny dialogue, and the priceless interplay of the Chan  triumvirate:  Jackie Chan, Sammo Hung, and Yuen Biao.  The slapstick in  Project A is some of the best in the Chan oeuvre:  The exciting bike ride  through the slums of old Hong Kong, where bamboo sticks, buckets and even  doors become weapons; Hung and Chan's fight with the bad guys in a  restaurant; the midnight mutual stalking in the fields on the island; the  hand-grenade gag.  And the martial-arts action utilizes the best of all  three actors, with Chan's athleticism, Hung's unusual (stocky) style and  Yuen's dogfighting combining for an action-film treat.  The final battle is  also thrilling, with all three squaring off a graceful, musclebound pirate  king.
Chan's direction is good; even if this movie has the same zoom-lens  addiction as so many films of its time, the pacing is tight, the rich  old-Hong Kong setting unusual and fascinating, and the characters (well,  except the squealing girlfriend) lovable.  Essential viewing for Chan fans.",960076800,4,1393,4.986899563318778

1082487,4,630580379X,"Jackie Chan in argyle socks, bad dubbing, a massively inept Chinese navy, corrupts cops in Hong Kong circa 1900, and Chan's signature stunts and humor create a highly entertaining (although not always comprehensible) farce. Chan starts off as a sailor in a navy that isn't capable of navigating its way in a bathtub. Not surprisingly, they fail to catch Lo Sam Pao, the pirate 'Lord of the Seas.' The sailors are turned into cops, Chan gets in trouble for doing his job arresting gangsters and busting up night clubs, and participates in the clever and humorous fight-stunts Chan is famous for. The bicycle pursuit in narrow alleys is particularly entertaining. Eventually he winds up in disguise on Sam Pao's island to rescue the hostages and defeat the pirates. The pirates are as schlocky as anything Hollywood dreamed up, but the sight of junks attacking a barkentine is refreshingly different from the usual Hollywood fare. ~M.

1082492,5,630580379X,"While Jackie Chan's previous film Dragon Lord (1982) did not have as much local success as Chan wanted* his next film Project A would be an artistic and commercial success. It is the maturation point for Jackie as a filmmaker and would start a string of successes that would help establish Chan as an action auteur. He directed, starred, co-written and even hired two ""brothers"" in Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao (they had grown up together in the same opera troupe and performed as the Seven Little Fortunes amongst others; Sammo was already an established success at this time and certainly is a prodigious presence in this movie) in the first film where they all had decent acting time -- kudos to those who can name the first film they acted in together.

Dragon Ma (Jackie Chan) is a sergeant in the Hong Kong Water Police where pirates are problematic on the coastline (they would remain an issue even past WWII), his department is poorly financed, there are interdepartmental squabbles with the landlubber police and their haughty commander Captain Chi (Kwan Hoi-San) and his nephew Inspector Hong Tin Chi (Yuen Biao: Knockabout) and they just had their remaining ships blown up real good (nice model sets in that scene). Project A is the codename to combat these buccaneers. However, it looks bad for the Water Police when they get merged back into the main police force and there is a plot to steal rifles and be sold to the pirates headed by Lo San Po (Dick Wei: The Five Venoms) who ultimately does not seem that bad to me. Later the pirates make the ultimate mistake in kidnapping a ship with a Rear Admiral aboard and take them hostage. This leads to Dragon Ma eventually teaming up with wayward thief and gambler Fei (Sammo Hung) and Inspector Hong to combat these irascible swashbucklers.

There are several stunts in this movie that are truly amazing. Much has been stated about the clock tower fall inspired by Harold Lloyd in Safety Last and with good reason. It is a superlative stunt and still one of my favorites as well as Jackie too. Jackie hangs by a clock hand about 50 feet above the surface and lets go to crash through two cloth awnings until the rude smacking into the ground proving that gravity is indeed a harsh mistress. It would be the first ""superstunt"" Jackie would do in a film and which would soon be a reoccurring theme in his movies to risk his life to please the audience. All three takes of this life-threatening drop are available to see on the film: two are shown in the movie and one is shown in the outtakes at the end. Every take looks quite painful. Leading up to this situation is another quick stunt that was quite dangerous. He climbs a flag pole to the top while handcuffed so he can unwrap himself from that mast and escape his predicament. But you look at how high he is from the concrete floor below and realize that if he messes this stunt it could be much worse than the fall through the awnings.

The comedic fighting in this film is also quite adroit and amazing in its action direction led by Jackie and Sammo. The first scene between the water and land police is a crazy melee of kung fu, throwing objects and spaghetti. It is quite reminiscent of an updated western bar fight. The Keatonesque bicycle chase and action sequence is a brilliant combination of the two. While the scene certainly had been influenced by such films as Sherlock Jr., especially in the bicycle camera view towards the end, Jackie gives it such a unique touch that makes it such an aesthetically pleasing and entertaining spectacle. Add in several other fight scenes and a fantastic finale with the three brothers and the antagonist and you have quite a satisfying film.

Project A was a hit in Hong Kong (19M HK dollars box office) and found critical support there as well. Jackie Chan would be nominated for Best Actor for Hong Kong Film Award; however, this film would win Best Action Design (Jackie Chan's Stuntman Association was even nominated against itself that year in Wheels on Meals) an award it truly deserved. It is also an important film for Hong Kong cinema. It helped push action movies into modern day locales and away from the Qing era and before dominated themes (though this film is considered a period film since it takes place in early 20th century).

While the film may not know what to do with female characters like Wong Man-Ying and the plot is not the most sublimely cohesive -- there is a grenade scene early in the film which seemed a bit excessive, not that funny and did not seem to fit -- this film is consistently fun and beautifully directed (cinematographer Cheung Yiu-Jo does not get enough credit for the work he has done with Jackie Chan). Action aficionados certainly talk about this film though it is somewhat overshadowed by Police Story (one of my favorite films) when they discuss the oeuvre of Jackie Chan. With the humor, the dangerous stunts with complete disregard for human life and the awesome action scenes it is easy to recommend this. I certainly love this film and find multiple viewings rewarding. There does remain one question that I will resolve soon: which film is better: this or the sequel?

The DVD I have of this movie is the slightly antiquated Media Asia R0 which is uncut but not as preferable as the R2 HKL release or the R3 Fortune Star release if you are region free. I do prefer it over the Dimension release which is cut, dubbed-only and a modified score. You can find a variety of links explaining the differences between the uncut and the Disney release but all you need to know is that the end credits are cut (like in Dragon Lord). Anyone who would cut the ""ouchtakes"" of these movies does not understand the audience who would purchase these DVDs. One huge negative of this is that you miss one take of the clock tower fall where things do not go quite right.

* I feel it has been overstated as being a flop since it was a success in Japan and made a modest amount of money in Hong Kong. The idea that this film was a flop was possibly done to increase the stature of Project A, but regardless Project A is a seminal movie in the history of Hong Kong cinema. I do think if Golden Harvest had any qualms about helping finance this film the presence of Sammo Hung during one of his most popular periods certainly soothed any worries.",1253750400,,6337,4.57306338028169
1082561,1,630580379X,"The worst of Jackie Chan's movies. The fight scenes are good, as expected. But the movie has a poor, or non existent, storyline. It just drifts along propelled by poor acting all around. What a disappointment.",1222819200,,209,4.833333333333333
1082562,4,630580379X,"INTRODUCTION TO PROJECT A:

Jackie Chan is an underestimated genious outside his own reputation, the historical importance of his legacy trascends his best known image as a comedian and daredevil acrobat: There's a talented Director and visionary, a man who changed the Action film industry in Honk Kong forever with his personal touch and style in the early 80's, by creating the perfect fusion of goofy physical comedy and incredible restless action with some of the most impressive and dangerous stunts ever displayed on film. This 1982 period film about sailors, police and pirates, was the consolidation of Chan as a star in Asia after his major breakthrought with Yuen Woo Ping's  kung fu classic ""Drunken Master"", and a movie that started an influence to follow from there on in the industry.

This is a true milestone, considered by critics not only as the first important Honk Kong action comedy , but one of the best productions of the genre next to Chan's second best directed film, the timeless classic ""Police Story"". Besides being one of his most entertaining and funny movies, the film contains some of Jackie's best stunts ever. We've all seen the reckless and almost imprudent asian stuntmen falling on their heads and backs from the roof to the solid floor in many occasions in 80's HK action movies, but no one can get used to watch Jackie climbing handcuffed to a flag pole, jumping to the top of a clock tower, and then falling to the ground with no protection but a couple of cloth roof tops. And he did it at least three times, two of them registered in this film. Even the MTV idiots getting their private parts bitten by baby alligators, thinks that its totally insane. Outstanding comedy and action, great period scenarios, enjoyable classic soundtrack: This movie defines an era.

So Jackie became a hughe international star and the world embraced this delightful character and action hero that he is, and then came the re-releases of his early and most important work to satisfy the needs of us fans. Among those DVD releases, unfortunately we can find editions like this one. Check this out:

THE PROBLEMS:

- Incomplete, cutted version with english dubbing, and the worst of all, the original amusing and perfectly synchronized music score was replaced by a new, awful synthesized random score, killing the comedy and sucking the joy out of the movie by trying to turn it into the current action flick. I mean, the ""updated"" new cover of the DVD speaks for itself.

- The Classic Golden Harvest presentation and original opening sequence with credits, was replaced by a computer generated pirate flag : Jackie Chan's Project A, the new title, makes clear that this release is a mere vehicle to show Jackie to new audiences, with no respect for anything else.

- The bar fight sequence is incomplete: The whole ""spaghetti"" incident was excluded, along with precious seconds of the brawl. Nice.

- The scene in the gambling house in wich the Sammo Hung's character is introduced to the movie, was completely excluded. Now, he just happens to know everyone. Awesome.

- From the Police training sequence, the ""shower"" scene is missing.

- The intro of Sammo, Jackie and Yuen Biao in the arrest sequence at the club house is missing. The fight sequences are chopped off too.

- The intro of the rifle robbery on a boat at night perpetrated by Sammo and Jackie, conceived as a Pekin Opera satire, is chopped off and ruined by the lack of score, waysting the rhymes and the joke intended.

- The pirate assault to the english ship sequence, chopped off.

- From then, everything is in place, till the new ending credits. By this time, only sadness for the lost original music score  and impotence for the waysted money remains.

Honestly, the picture and sound are decent. But that's it. The intention of this DVD edition is to introduce new audiences to Jackie's glorious past, and in that part only, it delivers. But this is not the final choice for any collector or faithful fan, not for a moment.

THE SOLUTION:

A couple years ago, FORTUNE STAR released a flawless remastered ALL-REGION DVD Edition, including the complete version in Cantonese DTS, 5.1, and original 2.0 mono soundtrack (Hurra!) with original character voices and music score, all the deleted scenes and outtakes, original HK trailer, and photo galleries. More than any fan could ask for, i tell you.

Dear Customer: Look for this edition in Asian DVD stores online, and forget about this Edition. Don't be afraid, they're just as safe and efficient as here, i guarantee.",1218758400,8,4567,4.839537869062901

This is not acceptable. Another point I would raise was that I checked the box to wait until all the dvd's in my order where all ready to be shipped together, they were shipped in two packages over two different periods. Please explain.",1206748800,,408,4.049382716049383
1082564,4,630580379X,"Where to begin?  This is a terrific movie, and one of Jackie Chan's very best.  Full of imaginative fights and stunts, Jackie's athleticism will amaze even those already familiar with him.  It also features fantastic moments from Yuen Biao, Sammo Hung, and a couple of Shaw Brother's alumni in Dick Wei and Lee Hoi San.

Jackie is Dragon Ma, a naval officer in early 20th century Hong Kong.  His navy is taking crap from the police for losing ships and not capturing the pirate, Lo Sam Pau (Wei) and his henchmen.  After they lose two more ships, the navy is forced to merge with Yuen Biao and the police department to fight local corruption, and THEN go after the pirates.

Those in the know say that the uncut, remastered version from Fortune Star is the way to go.  That being said, this version from Dimension does have a very good, widescreen picture with some bad English dubbing and no subtitle options.  For Dimension, the dubbing is actually pretty good.  If you want bad, check out any of the many Jet Li films that they've released.  This one does have Danny Trejo as the voice of Lo Sam Pau.  So if you're into pirates but have a hard time getting through those long, narcolepsy-inducing Johnny Depp films, give ""Project A"" a shot.  This one has good fights AND pays homage to Buster Keaton and Harold Lloyd.  4.5/5 and HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

1082566,4,630580379X,"If you are like me, you may find it difficult to explore some earlier creations of martial arts films, simply because the newest ones look poor enough sometimes with their low budgets.  I was very hesitant to watch Project A for the longest time, thinking its going to be such poor quality, with cheesy old kung fu fights accompanied by bad sound effects, and lousy dubbing.  I was surpirsed to find out that Project A creates action scenes that you just can't find with today's films, and that includes many of today's Jackie Chan films.

The quality wasn't as bad as I expected, even though the poor dubbing might make it seem that way at first.  It definetly has a classic look to the film with picture quality and sound effects, but its really not bad and is forgotten quickly, for action scenes begin almost immediately and consume the film, as well as a plot that just keeps going.  Overall, pacing is great and the viewer should never feel bored.  Whether its introduction to new characters, something comedic, a new unfolding in plot, or a terrific action scene, there is always something happening.

Perhaps the best thing about Project A are some of the main characters.  In addition to Jackie Chan, there are other martial art greats such as Sammo Hung, Yuen Biao, and Dick Wai.  All get to show off their skills impressively in the film.  A final fight lasting a good 4 minutes is just awesome in this film, pitting Chan, Hung, and Biao against the pirate leader - played by Dick Wai.

As previoulsy mentioned, there is more than enough action to please in this film.  Every scene is intense and offers something exciting and new.  Stunts galore and bodies fly, as editing is used to a minimum to really show off the real work that is being created by these guys.  The best stunt in the film was actually repeated during the movie, showing Chan falling from a multi-story clock tower through some cloth overhangs and down to the ground.  Another great scene, is the bicycle chase, which is much more clever than your typical car chase that is seen in hollywood all the time.

This will no doubt please anyone who loves good classic martial arts action and stunts.  Expect to see some stuff that you can't find in today's movies, and you'll be saying ""they just don't make em like they used to""",1183766400,,2305,4.596577017114915
1082567,3,630580379X,"I know not to expect great dialogue or Academy-worthy performances from Jackie's Hong Kong movies, and this one meets expectations.

The action scenes are top-notch, and Jackie's humor is evident throughout. Sammo Hung puts in a good performance and the chemistry between him and Jackie works. The final fight scene is very entertaining. If you like Jackie's Chinese movies, you'll appreciate this one. If you've only seen him in his American releases, you may be disappointed in the acting and production.",1175385600,,634,4.990566037735849
1082568,1,630580379X,"This is a review of the New Media/Cinevu release, not the dubbed Dimension one.

Do not buy this movie - this product should be pulled immediately as it seems to be an incomplete bootleg not even containing the whole movie. That should be sufficient warning there, but if you must know why, read on.

I was hesitant at first to buy this DVD, as all other reviews - both good and bad - seem to be of the Deimnsion version. I'm not sure why these two seperate products are linked to the same page for comments, but they are.

In short, this DVD is horrible. The only good thing is that it is in the original language - unfortunately, the subtitles - both Chinese and English - are hard coded into the screen, so you have to deal with both subtitles being up there. Secondly, the transfer is atrocious - so bad, in fact, that the hardcoded subtitles are so blurred its virtually impossible to read them (that's not even including the very small font used). The bad transfer also applies to the picture in general, giving it a low quality that makes the worst of TV show DVDs look like painted masterpieces.

There are no bonuses, sound options, or in fact any menus. The set up is bare minimum and the presentation so horrid that I feel as if I paid 15$ for a bootleg from Amazon, and I would not be surprised if in fact this IS a bootleg, as I can find no information on this New Media company or even this release of the DVD outside of Amazon.

But somehow, for some reason, I bore through this to continue on with the movie. Taking great effort I could make out the subtitles and grimey picture enough just to realize that the movie ends at 47 minutes - in an hour and a half movie. So not only is the transfer horrible, but it is incomplete, literally cutting off in the middle of the movie. This isn't a criticism about the editing, mind you, but the DVD actually just suddenly ends as if they didn't bother to burn the entire movie onto the DVD.

I will be emailing Amazon about this shortly, but I must urge all people to avoid this DVD, the reasons being clear - you aren't even getting the movie you paid for, its literally not all the way on the disc.",1173139200,10,2158,4.276960784313726

1082627,4,630580379X,"I had a little difficulty following the plot of this movie at first.  Dragon Mi Yong (Jackie Chan) is an enlisted man in the Navy, having a hard time getting support from the police to go after pirates plaguing Hong Kong.  It turns out that the police are corrupt and in league with the pirates.  After a run-in with the police Dragon is forced to join the police.  When Jackie finds an opportunity to catch an important pirate and is disciplined by his boss, he quits the police force, tired of its corruption.

As this activity is happening a friend of Dragon has stolen rifles that he plans to sell for a profit.  The only problem is that he stole them from the police.  A senior member of the police had planned to sell the rifles to the pirates.  The police are searching for the stolen rifles, and most policemen are unaware that the rifles were to be sold to the pirates, so if they catch Dragon or his friend the two will be arrested.  At the same time the pirates learn that Dragon and his friend have the rifles and they too are after the pair.

The next portion of the movie is a running chase between Jackie, his friend and girl friend and the police and the pirates.  One of the best chase scenes in the movie is when the pirates go after Dragon on bicycles.  The stunts for this sequence are creative and fun to watch.

The final insult to Dragon is when a ship is taken by the pirates, who capture the important passengers as hostages, including an admiral.  Dragon and his fellow sailors decide it is time to save the hostages and put an end to the pirate menace.  The sailors come up with a complicated plan to find where the pirate hideout is and to then save the hostages.  The remainder of the movie is a combination of Kung Fu and slapstick as the pirates are vanquished and the hostages saved.

Between the bullet-fast dubbed dialogue and the fast-paced scene changes the plot is more than a little difficult to follow on one watching of this movie.  I kept losing track of who was a good guy and who was a bad guy.  The acting was pretty hammy and the dialogue was cheesy.  But remember, this is a Jackie Chan movie and the movie itself is as much a vehicle for the stunts as it is for the story line.  The bicycle chase is one of the most creative chase scenes I have ever watched in any movie.  Throughout the numerous fight scenes Jackie makes humorous and unusual use of a variety of props, making the journey better than the end of the movie itself.

1082632,1,630580379X,"I had the opportunity to check out this DVD by renting it. I also have the original chinese language version on DVD, and I must say that these Disney reissues are total garbage. The movie itself is great, although I found the print on the Disney DVD to 'flicker' a bit - alternating lighter then normal brightness. The Deltamac version I have has a cleaner looking picture with consistent brightness.
The terrible things about this DVD include the dubbing (Jackie Chan didn't participate, although it sounds like him; and some of the Disney voice-over actors sound constipated); the 'hatchet' editing (isn't there any respect for artistic integrity with chinese movies distributed in North America?); and the music - incongruant and ruins the feel of the scenes. If this English dub were taken from the 80's English version, I wouldn't mind because the music would have been intact. An example of the new music dubbing ruining a scene is the one on a boat where Jackie and Sammo are dressed in chinese opera costumes. In the original, you hear the crashing cymbals as they speak, just like in Chinese opera. In the Disney version, the cymbals are absent which totally ruins the joke.  It's the sum of these alterations to the movie that have made me take away 4 stars from an otherwise 5 star movie.
Send a message to Disney by staying away from their hatchet job reissues. Show them how disgusted you are at these terrible alterations of classic HK films.",1049673600,4,1456,4.777777777777778

1082636,5,630580379X,"Well, frankly, for me--any movie with Jackie Chan, Sammo Hung, and Yuen Biao in it is a movie I've got to see.  And Project A is definitely worth the time.  First of all, I saw only the U.S. release with the lame dubbing and cut scenes.  This means I probably have no idea what I'm missing.  As a true martial-arts flick collector, I can understand why people say to stick with the Asian released editions as compared to the U.S. releases, although in this case I gave in and just bought the U.S. release.  Oh, well.  I still liked it a lot.  Fight scenes and stunts were unbelievable.  *small spoiler* Watch as Jackie climbs up flag poles to unbelievable heights, and then later falls from the same heights--yeah, falls!  Ouch!  Watch Sammo Hung deliver a full-forced drop kick (you know how heavy he is) to the end bad guy.  And everyone is falling off of bikes, ledges, whatever.  Great stunt work.  It's a killer movie. *end of the spoiler*  With regards to the story, yeah, it's kinda ""off"" just a little--but then again, I haven't seen the Asian full version, which has slightly different dialouge and storyline from what I've heard.  Even so, the story is very enjoyable despite being kinda silly in some places.  I actually like the storyline a lot.  I consider the storyline as being a contributor to my 5-star rating.  Pirates, action, villains, friends in ""low"" places, all of these things make for a refreshing and different martial-arts movie experience.  The dubbing is so-so, and the music--I feel safe in guessing--is surely better in the Asian release.  But, that's ok.  The comedy is really done well, and the movie is full of genuinely funny dialouges and scenes.  I really like this movie and consider it one of my all-time favorites.",1018396800,2,1754,4.7006578947368425
1082713,1,630580379X,"Disney has apparently bought the rights for U.S. distribution of Jackie Chan videos originally made in Hong Kong.  Fair enough, but Disney has done a tremendous disservice to the American audience by not allowing them to see the original movies.  Instead, they have dubbed over the original Cantonese dialogue with insipid English lines, taking out most of the humor of the original in the process.  They have cut scenes and replaced the original music score with inappropriate and uninspired music of their own.  I suspect the hatchet job on Project A is typical.  The original is one of Jackie Chan's best movies (and that is saying a lot).  The music, the dialogue, the plot, and the action stunts were all inspired and inspiring.  Disney has turned what has once a wonderful movie into a mediocre action movie at best.  I would recommend avoiding Hong Kong movies tampered with by Disney, though this is, unfortunately, hardly possible anymore in the U.S.",1015804800,8,959,4.95
1082714,4,630580379X,"First off this movie is great, it is truly one of Jackie Chan's classics. The stunts and action scenes are fantastic, and the plot moves along nicely. The DVD is good for the most part, the picture and sound are both good.
 But one negative side is the lack of subtitle and language options. With a movie like this it would be nice to be able to turn off the english dubbing and instead have the original chinese soundtrack with english subtitles. But this option is not presented, which really annoys me when you consider the fact that it could have been easily put on the DVD. The english dubbing isn't bad (Jackie Chan does his own voice, and i believe Samo Hung does too). But sometimes the orginal chinese soundtrack can make the movie seem more legitimate and less cheesy, and i like to have the option.
 But all in all this really is own of Jackie's finest movies. Samo Hung is very good as well. I took off one star just for the lack of subtitle options, but that isn't the end of the world. I still enjoy this DVD greatly.",987206400,15,1031,4.33678756476684

Some of the fight scenes in this film involve falls and flips from amazing heights in which the stuntmen land with brutal force.
The action and fight scenes are fast paced and choreographed with typical Jackie Chan mastery.  His usage of props is as usual one of the best parts of the film.  Whether in a bar brawl or in a high speed bicycle chase through the alley's of Hong Kong, Chan's mind works overtime to present unique and interesting fight scenes which are sure to delight any martial arts fan.
If you've never seen a Jackie Chan film, start here.  If you have seen Jackie Chan films, buy this one immediately.  It should be a welcome addition to your film library.",982195200,,834,4.563758389261745
1082717,5,630580379X,"Lately, after viewing all of Jackie's movies made over the past 10 or so years (the high budget movies like Police Story and Who Am I?), I have started to look at his earlier, less budgeted and clearly less known movies.
However, my search lead me to a couple of decent movies, and then Rumble In Hong Kong (IMO, the only truly bad Jackie Chan movie).  After seeing that disaster, I was skeptical as to see this one, but I rented it anyhow and found loads of charm and excitement.  As I watched, I recognized a lot of actors used in some other movies like Police Story (Mars, Ti Pai), and a lot of faces that, although I never saw them before, I loved seeing them too.  Additionally, I find that martial arts movies differ than Anime in terms of dubbing.  I find that in martial arts movies, reading the subtitles and watching the action a bit tiring, and unlike Anime, the original voices aren't exactly better to listen to.  So, while many have problems with dubbing, trust me, the dubbing is not a problem.
Every character has a large amount of likability, including Lord Sam Pao, the main villain.  Almost never do you see a movie that so successfully coasts on the charisma of the characters.  Yuen is a tough, but helpful and agreeable man, while Sammo Hung just can't help but be really cool, as well as funny.  Both support Chan, a rebellious yet charming character with a great sense of loyalty and justice.
It's not just the characterizations of these characters that works, but remember that these three men are action stars, and while Chan hogs the spotlight, Sammo and Biao deliver some great moves and moments in action.  Going along with the awesome martial art sequences comes the infamous clock falling stunt, a stunt that Jackie broke his skull pulling off.  Another really awesome scene is when Jackie rides through the streets on a bike, and I had to watch Biao Yuen talk his way out of telling the pirate guard the password several times, for he pulled it off insanely well.  This movie never stops with its coolness; it's either adrenaline pumping, funny, or just plain likable.
That all covers the movie itself, and know this here and now: the DVD version is better than the VHS version, mainly due to the superior look of widescreen mode, and superior sound quality from the DVD hardware.  This movie is nothing short of a work of art, one of Chan's best of all time, and all the DVD does is enhance it.  Well worth the price!",980899200,4,2450,4.553530751708428

7896078,5,630580379X,"Project A  5/5 Stars. Dont let the ridiculously bad title fool you, this is one of Chans classics. A period piece set in 1900s Hong Kong, Chan stars as a member of the Navy who are hunting a fleet of vicious pirates while also contending with their rivalry with the local police force. After the pirates preemptively sink the Navys docked ships, the Navy members are forced into the police force where Jackie wins the respect of his rival officer and busts a gang lord who is aiding the pirates. With the combined might of the Navy and the police, Jackie infiltrates the pirates and takes them down with karate, grenades, and some brutal knife kills (notable is the pirate who gasps out ""help me please!"" after being stabbed in a catch-you-off-guard moment).
Craziest Shit Youll See Jackie Do: The infamous clock fall. While being pursued by the gang lords thugs, Jackie hides inside a clock tower, but is chased out onto the roof. Jackie winds up hanging on the clocks hands, suspended over the ground, before losing his grip and falling through a pair of awnings to the ground. Jackie insisted on doing the fall for real a total of three separate times. The first take backfired with Jackie bouncing off one of the awnings (instead of having it break his fall as planned) and nearly breaking his neck. He immediately did the stunt again only to decide he needed to pop up from the fall and deliver a one-liner... so he filmed it one more time. Crazily enough, in the final cut both of the successful falls are used (played one after another for dramatic effect) despite the obvious fact that Jackie hits the ground differently in both takes. Why a simple editing job couldn't have sufficed for Chans post-fall one liner is a mystery.",1500508800,,1735,4.651465798045603
