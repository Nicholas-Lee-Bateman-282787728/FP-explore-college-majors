7669739,4,B01BW8OXV0,"I pre-ordered this from RightStuf (not sure I really trust Amazon for it), but intentionally held off on it until watching The Woman Called Fujiko Mine (go get that now if you haven't already; it's amazing). How does this fare?

Well, the character interactions were pretty good, the fight and chase scenes are amazing, and the animation is good. The character at the end is especially a surprise if you're familiar with the franchise. Seeing Lupin and Jigen finally becoming the friends They are in most Lupin works certainly brought a smile to my face as well. That said, I did have a few gripes.

For one, some of the scenes with Fujiko were...strange, to put it loghtly. Dunno if I wanna describe it, but it doesn't really make a lot of sense. And I actually liked the somewhat unique coloring of The Woman Called Fujiko Mine's animation. The coloring here felt much more typical.

The dub cast may or may not be another gripe. I say ""may or may not be"" because the cast itself is fine, if certainly not the best cast ever. However, I loved the voice cast found in TWCFM, and even if I didn't I do wish they were used for consistency's sake. Richard Epcar is the only one who returns to his role (Zenigata). Everyone else is different; Christina Bee does a good impression of Michelle Surf's Fujiko, or at least, her interpretation sounds strikingly similar, Keith Silverstein does a good Lupin, and Dan Woren is good as Jigen. Again, it's not that the cast itself is bad, just wish they used Funimation instead of Bang Zoom, though different distributors certainly played a part. But that's just me.

Overall, I didn't like it as much as TWCFM, but is as an enjoyable ride regardless, and I think you ought to give it a shot.",1464566400,2,1730,4.570967741935484
7669740,5,B01BW8OXV0,"Fans of Lupin the 3rd have a lot to be excited about. Eastern Star appears to finally be bringing all the Lupin III movies to the west. For years weve gotten the occasional movie here and there but weve always been a decade or more behind Japan. Eastern Star has been regularly releasing the made for TV movies starting with Bye Bye, Lady Liberty first aired in 1989 and next month we get Alcatraz Connection released in 2001. I was happy that Eastern Star skipped over the eight Lupin movies already released in the U.S. and I assume the next made for TV movie released will be Operation: Return the Treasure. Even more exciting were the release of the two Lupin III vs. Detective Conan movies which were very recent releases. The cinematic movie was released in 2013. Even MORE exciting is the release of Lupin the 3rd: Jigens Gravestone ON BLU-RAY, released in 2014.

Let me clear up a few things based on a description from Wikipedia which states that the movie, focuses on the character Jigen and tells how he and Lupin became partners First of all, to say the movie focusses on Jigen is a mischaracterization as Lupin is in the movie about as much as he is in any other Lupin movie. The one difference is that Goemon doesnt appear in the movie and Inspector Zenigata only gets a few seconds after the closing credits. Second, the plot has nothing to do with how Lupin and Jigen became partners. The only evidence I saw that this story may take place earlier in their partnership was that the date on Jigens grave was in the 1970s which was the decade when the television series first aired in Japan. To those concerned that this is a Jigen movie with Lupin playing second fiddle let me assure that this is not the case.

I was disappointed in the two Lupin vs. Detective Conan movies for reasons I articulated in my two reviews but I really enjoyed Jigens Graveyard. It has a high quality feel that elevates it above the made for TV movies. The animation is often gorgeous and flowing with style. Like many of the best Lupin movies the story is kept simple. An assassin has targeted Jigen for reasons that aren't really that important. Whats important is that the movie sets up the killer as a terrifying opponent whose shooting skills appear to exceed even Jigens. Yael Okuzaki will surely go down as one of the greatest Lupin villains and the ending was classic Lupin.

If you enjoy Fujiko Mine then buckle yourself in. There is a LONG scene where she is entirely butt naked facing off against some kind of robot thing. Of all the Lupin movies Ive seen this one is probably the least safe for children particularly given the unnatural physical dimensions of Fujiko.

The movie does have a definite conclusion but there are several obvious indications that there will be at least one follow up movie. This includes the teaser at the end of the closing credits that includes Zenigata but also a quick scene prior to the credits that shows the return of an old villain from Lupins past. Im pretty psyched about the future for fans of Lupin. Not only are we getting the older made for TV movies but now were getting recent ones and they look good.",1462752000,,3151,4.542253521126761
7669741,5,B01BW8OXV0,"I confess to not having seen the Fujiko series that this serves as the conclusion to, yet it's not necessary to enjoy it. Like most Lupin media, this feature can stand alone and anyone remotely familiar with the series will be able to understand what's happening. This time around we get a peak into Lupin's early career and watch as his relationship with Jigen and Fujiko begins to cement. Goemon doesn't make an appearance and Zenigata only appears in an after-credits blip, which actually works because the story is tight and keeps moving at a rapid pace. Veterans of the franchise will be able to guess how it plays out but watching it happen is still part of the fun. The ending, especially for longtime fans, is GREAT and contains a reference that made my jaw drop upon my first viewing. It may be brief but this one packs a punch.

The animation is absolutely gorgeous, blending the traditional character designs with a more modern look. I did miss Yuji Ohno's smooth jazz but it's not enough of an issue to weigh the production down. The lack of special features or other episodes makes it a bit more bare than we've come to expect from Discotek, yet the feature itself is strong enough to justify its existence. This is a must-watch for fans of Lupin and a promising sign of what is hopefully to come.",1461542400,,1310,4.574468085106383
7669742,4,B01BW8OXV0,"I agree with most of the other reviews. Outside of Castle of Cagliostro, this is one of the finest Lupin productions I've seen. Well animated, highly stylized, great story..  BUT VERY SHORT. Two episodes.. 40-50 minutes tops. Plus, No Goemon. One of my favorite Lupin adventures in spite of this however.. The short run time and lack of extra features are why this rates 4 star rather than 5 star treatment.",1461456000,,407,4.732394366197183
7669743,5,B01BW8OXV0,"I am so pleased to have this movie that I feel I can gloss over any drawbacks (lack of meaningful special features, short length of movie itself) and give this the 5 stars it deserves.  The animation is superior; a daring follow-up to ""The Woman Called Fujiko Min"" TV series that is as edgy and gritty as its predecessor.  The story is engrossing and benefits from the short length of the film itself.  I can only imagine how much extraneous padding would have had to be added to drag this compact, well-paced tale out to what might be considered a more 'acceptable' length for a feature film.  I see no way in which that would have been an improvement.  Characterisation was great, to the point where I can only hope that, in the future, the folks responsible for this movie will give us something similar for Goemon.

One thing to watch out for: The sub-titles, while a very nice translation, will sometimes be on-screen for such a short period of time that you'll be wanting to hit the pause button in a couple places in order to be able to read everything.

One more thing: Make sure you've seen the first Lupin III movie (""Mystery of Mamo"") before you see this, otherwise the end will leave you with little other than a giant question mark.  I think you'd rather have the grinning happyface that I had.",1460419200,5,1307,4.508474576271187
7669744,5,B01BW8OXV0,The movie is beautifully drawn and well written. Another great movie to add to my Lupin collection,1460160000,,98,4.823529411764706
7669745,5,B01BW8OXV0,"Cons: In an age where anime is more affordable and available than ever, you are paying a full movie price for 50 mins of anime in 2.0 sound with no bonus features. That being said if you are a Lupin the 3rd fan, this is one of the coolest and most well animated pieces of Lupin anime ever created and it can't be missed. Personally I think Jigen is the best character in Lupin so it was especially cool that he was the main point of focus in this special. I also want to than discotek for releasing this and also for rescuing many other classic anime. What a great company to invest your money into.",1460073600,12,599,4.172413793103448

8751715,5,B01BW8OXV0,"This is one of the best Lupin films out there. Excellent animation and distinctive art direction, a slick and jazzy score, and a simple and concise but engaging and mature crime-drama narrative that'll keep you on the edge of your seat until the final credits roll. It's short, but uses every second to its fullest. The villain has a memorable presence and all the characters are as fun to watch as ever. Takeshi Koike is an amazing modern anime director and I can't wait for Discotek to (hopefully) eventually release his follow-up Goemon film.",1528502400,,545,4.808510638297872

8751719,5,B01BW8OXV0,"I am a huge fan of the whole Lupin III series, and have been a super fan of the since the newer series The Woman Called Fujiko Mine. To know that Jigen's Gravestone was going to be released in the same style made me so excited! I know some Lupin fans are a little put off by the dark tones to both the series and this movie, but to have a Lupin series that takes itself for the most part seriously is refreshing. There are a few parts of the movie that just make you go ""Really?"" and the biggest character I am a fan of is Fujiko, which her character can be a little disappointing in this one. (She's just kind of half naked through the whole movie, which sucks because Fujiko's wardrobe is one of the best it has been in any of the series.)

The feel of the movie is almost like an old James Bond movie.  The music is the jazzy atmosphere and I feel gives the film a more cheery feel. Which is hard seeing the plot of the film is pretty grim. But even so they still keep the old style Lupin humor.  I really feel like new and old fans alike can get into this!

Also there is another film coming out in February 2017 that will be the same way with Goemon's story. Goemon's Spray of Blood!",1483056000,,1188,4.042553191489362

8751723,5,B01BW8OXV0,"Wow, this by far is the most Violent, Bloody and Gritty Lupin movie I ever seen. I have always seen Lupin the 3rd as a goofy, funny man, but this version just blew me away. A good change is always welcome when it comes to Anime. Oh and lets not forget Miss Fujiko Mine, in this film she is totally revealing which means there are some nude scenes here and there. I know of ""The Woman Called Fujiko Mine"" is a follow up to this one, which explains the story line and format. If you are a Lupin fan buy this and be amazed, like I was.

5 stars",1467763200,6,541,3.963302752293578
