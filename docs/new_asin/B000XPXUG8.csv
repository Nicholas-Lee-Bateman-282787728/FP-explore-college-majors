8229039,5,B000XPXUG8,"We were happily surprised by the excellent quality of this video with very explicite explanation about the history, how the country was founded, the countryside named after the beauty and lush of Switzerland. My husband and myself found ourselves very attracted to visit Latvia. The architecture of some beautiful buildings seems also very attractive as they are decorated with cats on the roof and interesting faces of elfs or characters. I am sure this video of Latvia is going to be a hit as it is not only beautiful but also with interesting part of the history of the Baltic region.  greatly recommend this film to anyone who is an adventurer.",1371254400,2,648,4.837837837837838
