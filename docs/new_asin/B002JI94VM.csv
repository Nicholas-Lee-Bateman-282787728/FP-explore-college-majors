Would have been 5 stars (material) but the case sucks !
Discs come loose - must be slid in over other discs - be very careful super easy to scratch and even CRACK Discs.

3938560,4,B002JI94VM,"Elvis Costello has been a hero for nearly thirty years and I am delighted to see him interact with some great artists.  The show is dead brilliant.

The deeply odd packaging, with tiny moving plastic pieces that broke immediately, was a misstep on the production end, but the content far outweighs the minor irritation of attempting to extract the discs.

I am very happy that this program exists.",1262304000,3,397,4.8088235294117645
3938561,4,B002JI94VM,"You should look into getting this if you are very interested in music history, details of music production, etc.  The interviews that Elvis Costello gives are quite detailed and interesting, but they would be VERY dry for a viewer that isn't interested in that kind of subject matter.  Also take a look at the guest list for the season to make sure you are interested in the guests.  They are listed in the description above.

An example episode with a single guest, like Elton John:
1)Elvis Costello plays a song of some sort, not necessarily his or his guests, but typically thematically relevant
2)Introduces the guest
3)Interview, talking about how the guest got started, why they were interested in music, their influences, etc.
4)Possible clips from some of the artists they were interested in.
5)Maybe a song with the guest.
6)More interview.
7)Maybe another song.
8)You get the idea...

The format changes slightly if he has multiple guests on at the same time.

---

In terms of visual and audio quality, this blu ray is top notch.  I haven't noticed any problems and everything looks and sounds great.

This is getting 4 stars from me because I love Elvis Costello, and I enjoy most of his guests from this season, but it still got a bit dry for me sometimes as someone who isn't as involved in music as he and his guests are.",1262131200,3,1336,4.6752136752136755

3938563,4,B002JI94VM,"I pay premium for Sundance just for this show and it is the only television I watch. After months of wondering if there would be more (Sundance site kept it a secret), tonight began the second season and I couldn't be happier. I aggree with the reviewer who wishes there was more bonus material - I am hoping that the Second Season box will have far more. Nonetheless, this is the best thing to ever happen to television - I watch it on a TV that can't decipher pink from yellow but I thank God I didn't throw it away because He let me have Spectacle. Mean no disrespect to the good lady or her fans, but can't resist calling Elvis the ""anti-Oprah"" He is genuinlely interested (and doesn't play to we who find him interesting himself) and this is the stuff that makes for a great and honest interview. This is something completely different, folks. I am sure it is an honor to the artist who is asked to be on the show. Fame and celebrity are certainly not the criteria here... I thank Elvis for Rufus Wainwright. Where Elvis was the only sure thing in music I've known for 30+ years (the ""king', if you will, he introduced me to the ""prince"" at this late age - another ""sure thing"" to look forward to for the next 30 years. And they gave me Jeff Buckley whom I also an't get enough of and will appreciate for life. Never gave a lick about U2 until tonight;s show.. And I'm looking forward to appreciating Bruce Springstein as well...I've a list of 100 folks I'd like to see on that stage, but they are folk I like already. I thought I knew all music and had many opinions formed that limited my trust in certain artists, Trust Elvis. He's never once let me down and so my world is forced to get bigger in order to make room for more beauty... But I am making a spectacle of myself here.........'Excited re: Lyle Lovitt.... And my 14 year old composer won't miss an episode either as this provocative musical program has brought some light to us in ou darket hour",1260403200,7,1963,4.336956521739131
3938564,4,B002JI94VM,"Ordered both the DVD and blu-ray versions of this after downloading a couple episodes from i-tunes.  If you are interested in popular music, songwriting, and musicians--this is a good choice.  If you just want videotaped performances, look elsewhere.  Elvis Costello, who I never really listened to in his prime, is very knowledgeable and a pretty good interviewer.  Episodes usually start out with Elvis and some musicians doing one of the artists songs.  There may be a song or two mixed in with the interview and it usually wraps with Elvis doing a song or two with the guest (though not always one of the guests songs).  Some of the performances end up being rather interesting--Elvis and The Police doing Purple Haze.  The blu-ray was supposed to arrive first and the DVD was to be a gift, but the DVD came first so it became a gently-used gift.  Both versions have 5.1 sound, but the DTS version on the blu-ray sounds slightly better--more depth in the mid-ranges.  I do wish that they had included more bonus features in the package.  There are, for example, a number of behind the scenes clips online that are not on the DVDs.  Also, someone should have removed the zoom button from the cameras used for some of the bonus interviews as the camera person got carried away.  It did take me more than a few minutes to figure out how to remove the discs from the packaging.",1259625600,15,1377,4.644628099173554

The broad range of the discussions, histories and looks at the real personalities of the artists being interviewed are truly amazing and highly entertaining as well as informative. We've watched every episode and throughly enjoyed them. What ""In the Actor's Studio"" does for that craft, this series does for music.

Well rounded discussions with musicians on more than music.
Their likes/dislikes, views on different subjects including music and more.

3938591,4,B002JI94VM,"I really enjoyed the show and some of the interviews were very good, but Elvis C. wasn't as relaxed an interviewer as he was when he filled in as host for Dave Letterman a decade ago. The Elton John/Diana Krall interview was excellent.  Spectacle introduces a number of excellent artists to a wider audience. Too bad the show was dropped.",1357516800,,338,4.633333333333334
3938592,5,B002JI94VM,"On one episode, there is actually an interview with President William Jefferson Clinton.  The President talks about his passion for music and its influence on his life.  Not everyone knows that a long time ago, he was a most promising talent and was seriously considering a career in music.  He, of course, chose a different path and destiny.  This is a must see interview and an opportunity to see the President's wonderful musical gift.  It's nice to see a different side to the President's many different achievements.

Whom else could you ever want to see and hear?  Other great guests include Sir Elton John, Smokey Robinson, John Mellencamp, The Police, and Tony Bennett.

P.S. Don't forget to order Season 2.  It includes Sheryl Crow, Bruce Springsteen, and Bono.",1313971200,,770,4.953125
3938593,5,B002JI94VM,"Who'd have thought that the once rather arrogant and, dare I say, self important Elvis Costello could be responsible for some  of the best interviews i've ever seen with musicians, songwriters and even the odd president. All celebrating the vast tapestry of quality music past and present this is one music fan talking with passion to other music fans in a manner that never fails to entertain. But fascinating as these interviews are, the musical collaborations [such as Elvis performing with Elton John on a version of David Ackles' 'Down River'] save the series form ever slipping into self indulgent chuminess or anything remotely similar.
Roll on series 2.",1276473600,,661,5.064220183486238
3938594,5,B002JI94VM,"This is an intelligent music show where one professional musician interviews others.

The first episode I watched on recieving the set was the Diana Krall one, who is interviewed by Elton John rather than Elvis Costello. She talked movingly about her friendship with Oscar Peterson, in the last five years of his life, as well as her love for many kinds of music. She also played some swinging Jazz Piano. Elton interviewed her from the side of the Piano loving every moment of it.

Elvis Costello may have started as part of the post punk new wave movement, but has matured into a musician who can do it all. In general he gets more out of the guests than any normal talk-show host would. As well as interviews there are also some fabulous musical collaborations. Watching the Elton John interview last night it was amazing to see Allen Toussaint on Hammond organ and James Burton on guitar in the backing band as Elvis and Elton sang a David Ackles song.

Other guests include The Police, James Taylor, Herbie Hancock, Pat Methany, Tony Bennett, Rufus Wainwright and Ex-President Bill Clinton.

In the UK this is on 5 DVD's with a total running time of 650 minutes, so although the price may look expensive it is actually good value for money. I can't recommend it highly enough.",1269216000,4,1281,4.68

3938596,4,B002JI94VM,"I love this series.  I love the simplicity of the concept.  One of my musical heroes interviewing many other music giants with the sole purpose of providing the audience a deeper insight than one would normally get from spot interviewers.

I won't go into the details of the show, that has been reviewed before.  I just wanted to clarify something regarding the extras.  When I read there were bonus interviews included, I was extremely excited.  Last year when Elvis discussed the making of the show and some of the unfortunate edits that went into the process of cutting a show down to an hour long, he specifically referenced having to snip FOUR OR FIVE MINUTES from Smokey Robinson's response to the writing process for ""Just My Soul Responding"".  I thought for sure this release would take advantage of not having this time restraint and add that footage (as well as for other artists) back in.  And when I read there were bonus interviews, I figured that was what was going on.

But the additional interviews are actually just that.  Additional interviews that weren't conducted by Elvis as part of the show.  Not that there's anything wrong with including these either, they are a welcome addition.  But if the time restraints have been lifted, why not put additional material back into the extras as well?  Isn't that supposed to be one of the biggest perks for nerds like me who want to hear it all?

That being said, this is a wonderful series.  I believe Elvis stated that Season 2 would be his last, and that's really unfortunate.  There are so many other great artists I would love to see interviewed in this format.

There are also four complete bonus songs as well, including the full version of Elton's Ballad of a Well Known Gun with James burton playing lead.  The stuff of dreams.....

Alas, we must be happy with what we have here.",1264723200,13,1851,4.674922600619195
8371509,5,B002JI94VM,"Watch out for season two - half the length of season one for twice the price. Is that the new math?

8371510,5,B002JI94VM,"I got the DVD's to each season as soon as they originally came out and have had no issues with them. Others have reported technical problems with their DVD's or Blu-rays.

If you own and enjoy one season, I highly suggest you buy the other season as well. They are equally balanced with well known and lesser known singer-songwriters. Each episode aired for an hour on TV but is really only about 50 minutes or less, to leave time for commercials. It would be nice if there were more extras, like a ""making of"" featurette for the season, extra performances or sound check moments, etc. Still, for the price you get a LOT of great music and information, so I couldn't bring myself to deduct a star from  the rating.

The guests in Season One are: Elton John, Bill Clinton,Tony Bennett, Lou Reed, Julian Schnabel, The Police, Smokey Robinson, Rufus Wainwright, Jakob Dylan, Jenny Lewis, She & Him, Diana Krall, Herbie Hancock, Rosanne Cash, Norah Jones, Kris Kristofferson, John Mellencamp, James Taylor, Renee Fleming.

The guests in Season Two are: Bono and the Edge (U2), Sheryl Crow, Ron Sexsmith, Neko Case, Jesse Winchester, Allen Toussaint, Richard Thompson, Nick Lowe, Levon Helm, Mary-Louise Parker,Lyle Lovett, John Prine, Ray LaMontagne, Bruce Springsteen.

The show has helped expand my musical horizon. I have rewatched and enjoyed and learned something from every episode. It gave me a fresh insight to artists whose work I knew and enjoyed, as well as artists I knew very little of and dismissed (and have since revisited), and introduced me to many new artists. That's what a good music show SHOULD do!

Elvis Costello is such a music lover and has a great and vast background so he can relate to his guests as a peer, which can lead to some more interesting questions; admittedly, the discussion of song craft can go over a typical fan's head. And I like hearing the various interpretations of songs but I can also see how most people would rather hear LESS of Elvis Costello performing and more of the guests. I enjoy seeing the live band and wonderful guest musicians.

I can understand audiences would rather see a big singing star performing and being interviewed on TV than the person who wrote the songs for him/her discussing their songwriting craft and inspirations. I think one of the intentions of Costello and Elton John and others on the show is to make the public more aware of other important and talented singer-songwriters who are influential but not so popular or well known (ex. Laura Nyro).

IMO it's unfortunate that shows like American Idol can linger while this IMPORTANT music show lasted only 2 seasons on TV. I can see how this show, as it was presented, might not tickle everyone's fancy but I hope that it (or something equivalent) gets on TV again. In the UK they have had Later With Jools Holland for years and in North America we have nothing to compare to these.",1525132800,,2908,4.7673956262425445
8371511,4,B002JI94VM,"I miss this series, it had some great guests and great performances. The simple genius of a talk show where musical guests could both tell their stories and play their songs, that's what made it work. My only gripe was Costello injecting himself into the performances, and I'm a fan since forever. Jools Holland was guilty of it now and then too (ever see that one with him and the White Stripes?) but Costello made it part of the show, and it's the only part that ever faltered. If he'd stuck to conducting great interviews and just the occasional collaboration he'd have been the Johnny Carson of music.",1500854400,,605,4.611111111111111

Costello opens the shows with his band, playing deep cut selections of that night's guest. The interviews are broken up by the guests them selves performing their music. My personal favorite was the episode with Smokey Robinson as he recounts the birth of his music as it coincided with the birth and success of Motown. The episodes can be viewed as stand alone experiences, so choose your favorite artists and enjoy an unique interview of them, booth intimate and personal as well as musically technical. Enjoy!
