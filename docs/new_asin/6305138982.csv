This isn't listed anywhere on the product page, but the back of the DVD case says: 'Due to insurmountable rights issues, the ""making-of"" documentary ""The Flames of Sarn"" cannot be included on this DVD'.

971800,5,6305138982,"Peter Davison's third season has a rather special place in my heart.  It was the first season I ever watched and the one that made me fall in love with the show.  It was much more moody and interesting than his first two seasons, lacking the ""crowded TARDIS"" of his first season and the endlessly returning villains of the second.  Davison himself has said that if his first two seasons had been more like his third, he might have stayed on.

Planet of Fire fits in well with his ultimate season and is very under-rated. Most people know about Nicola Bryant in a bikini, but that's not the *only* reason to like this episode.  Davison is at peak form, bringing the quiet charm and decency that defined his Doctor.  The companions shine. For once, Turlough is given something to do, becoming a useful and interesting character to the point where it's kind of sad when he leaves. Kamelion is also used effectively (by barely being used in his robot form). Peri, in her first episode, mainly has to run around. But when she is given a chance to act, she's brave and brassy. Her repartee with the Master (""So what? I'm Perpugilliam Brown and I can shout just as loud as you can!"") is priceless.

Despite the return of the Master, the episode is fairly original, using the beautiful Lanzarote locations effectively to create a realistic volcanic world. Most of the Sarns are a bit weakly characterized, but Wyngard, as Timonov, is excellent, bringing fire and brimstone and, in his final scene, a wonderful resignation. I just wish they'd AInley really act rather than forcing him to ham it up. On occasion, he brings some real fire to the Master, no pun intended.

I buy these DVDs for the episodes, so am not really concerned about the extras.  But the commentary on the episode is quite enjoyable, with Byrant, Strickson, Cumming and Davison swapping stories and reminiscing about the production. The big extra on here is the recut version.  All I can say is ... don't waste your time.  The episode is significantly cut down, removing some nice character scenes. There's a new and quite lame scene at the beginning. There's a bunch of CGI flames added everywhere that look ridiculous. Perhaps the worst crime is that Peter Howell's evocative score is gone and the episode is presented in ""wide screen"" that consists of slicing off the top and bottom of the image. This leaves every scene cramped and awkward.  Please, BBC, don't waste the Restoration Team's time on this. I'd much rather see more animated versions of missing episodes.",1285027200,8,2533,4.7318181818181815
971801,4,6305138982,"This is one of a strong run of episodes in Peter Davison's final season and is the penultimate story of his too-short tenure as The Doctor. The shape-shifting robot Kamelion is finally put to good use and Anthony Ainley as The Master has lots of delicious scenery to chew (although when he is playing Kamelion posing as The Master he has some nice subdued moments).  Mark Strickson puts in a good performance as Turlough and we finally learn about his mysterious origins. There is some great location filming in Lanzarote which doubles as itself and a volcanic alien landscape. Davison is excellent as always.

The only downside is the introduction of the new companion Peri (short for Perpugilliam, the first ridiculous conceit involving the character). Although her bikini-clad debut is often referenced by Who fans, she turned out to be an exceedingly cringeworthy character with an annoyingly phony American accent. The actress Nicola Bryant is very good when performing in other roles in her native accent but when she puts on Peri's exaggerated nasal whine with its overly-hardened 'r's, it's like nails on a chalkboard.  Dallas Adams, who plays her supposedly-American stepfather,  has an even wobblier accent. The producer of the time made Peri an American to acknowledge the growing interest in DW in the U.S.  Unfortunately Peri wasn't much of a tribute.  Luckily, in the two stories in which she is paired with Davison, his low-key performance keeps her annoyance-level under control.  The worst was yet to come with the tiresome, argumentative relationship she would have with the next incarnation of The Doctor played by Colin Baker.

This story, however, is among the high points of 80s Who and well worth the purchase.",1279411200,,1733,5.077464788732394
971802,4,6305138982,"Fifth Doctor Peter Davison's penultimate episode ""Planet of Fire"" at last is coming to DVD. Lost between the grey and gloomy Ressurection of the Daleks and the apocalyptic Caves of Andrazani POF at times has been seen as a transitional story to be quickly glanced over in route to the grim Davison finale. True Planet of Fire is the ultimate transitional story if ever Doctor Who had one. The viewer has the following transitions to contend with in one four part adventure: Davison's first episode without companion Tegan J. (Finally) as well as his last encounter with The Master, robotic side kick Kamillion's second, final and ill-fated appearence in the program, Companion Turlough's final episode (the truth is revealed at last),and the introduction of new companion Peri Brown (don't ask me to spell her full name). Add all that to the fact that a regeneration is just an episode away and one begins to wonder is there any room left for a plot?? The Answer is yes and in my opinion a good one.
  The story centers around The Master's attemp to regain controll of the shape shifting robot Kamillion for the greater purpose of ""stealing"" a rare and precious gas from the planet Sarn. This gas will help The Master reverse a ""little"" trouble he got himself into (you'll see what I mean first timers). Stealing this gas is not as easy as one would think as Sarn is a prison planet for fugitives from Turlough's home world of Trion. The prisoners have divided into two factions: One devout, relgious sect dedicated to the worship and protection of ""The Fire"" (or numismiton gas that The Master seeks) and a second more scientific minded(yet supressed by the first group) group of free thinkers bent on revelation of the fire's true nature as it relates to the planet Sarn's inpending doom. While the story attemps to be fair to both points of view it ultimatly lends itself to the liberal, secular point of view held by the non-religious group.
  Where I believe Planet of Fire realy shines is in the performance of the lead cast. Peter Davison gives one of his best perfomances in his tenure as the Doctor. I am not sure if he is more relaxed knowing his time on the program is near an end, or if he has altered his performance to compensate for the lack of Janet Feilding or mayby he just is more comfortale not hiding behind the Cricket suit ( No Cricket jacket, sweater, or celary for most of this episode); But the viewer gets Davison at his best hear. In addition Mark Strickson give his best performance since Terminus which is no suprise as he is finaly given something to do and say. For fans of Anthony Ainley's Master take heart as he is allowed to elevate his performance slightly above the mustache twisting, tie a youg lady to the train tracks badie stereo-type that he was forced to play in previous episodes. And last new companion Nicola Bryant gives her first and best performance during her stay with the program; Of couse this is helped by given a lot to do in the story but still she makes the most of the spot light.
  While on the subject of Peri I would be amiss if I did not mention the lovely young Ms Bryant tastfully parading around in the ""Skimpiest"" outfit a companion has ever worn on the show. I am of course referring to the famous peri in the bikini scene at the end of episode one and start of episode two. Male viewers and perhaps some female viewers to (not that there is anything wrong with that) will admit that this scene alone is worth the price of admission. Meow!!!
  A final note worth mentioning is the scenery as this episode's external shots were filmed in The Canary Islands off the coast of North Africa....One word...Beautiful! To sum it all up If you are looking for daleks, cyberman and fast paced paced adventure than this is not for you. But if you want to tie up all the lose ends from the Peter Davison era than Planet of Fire is a must for your collection....and a pretty good story to bust...ah, no butt,ah,uhm no no I mean to boot. Gosh, All this reminiscing about Peri of Fire, no I mean Planet of Fire, has left me in need of a COLD shower. Meow!!",1275004800,14,4109,4.520861372812921
971803,4,6305138982,"The Davison era phase-out continues on Planet Of Fire, which is more or less a wrapping up regarding two companions and the introduction of the most voluptuous companion to ever grace the series.  And in my Arc of Infinity review, I made the mistake of saying it was the second of three stories made in a foreign location.  This is actually the third one, set in Lanzarote, one of the Canary Islands, a hop or two away from Morocco, which makes The Two Doctors the fourth foreign-made story--sorry, mea culpa.
A distress call from Earth is picked up by the TARDIS.  Turlough recognizes it as a Trion signal and cuts it off.  He really has a lot to play in this story because his origins are finally revealed.  While in the TARDIS, he spots Peri, a young American girl drowning in the sea around Lanzarote, and rescues her.  He lays her down in a spare bedroom, only to find among her belongings a metal artifact with two overlapping triangles, a design that matches a brand on his left arm.
That brand is also found on the Chosen One on the volcanic desert planet Sarn, currently torn between those who believe in Logar, Lord of the Fire Mountain, and unbelievers who think Logar is a myth.  Things are more tolerant than before, when Unbelievers were cast into the fires.  Malkon, a young man who's the current Chosen One, thinks that it's right to doubt, whereas the Chief Elder and his mentor Timanov thinks it's ""still a wise precaution to send the occasional free-thinker to the flame.""  When the young man says he lacks the faith to condemn anyone, his mentor tells him ""accept what you see and hear and feel all around you.  The faith will come.""
But it's also a time of testing, as an eruption of the Fire Mountain is imminent.  Legends say that if Sarns submitted to Logar, an Outsider will come and bring them gifts.  That being is impersonated by Kamelion, the shape-shifting android in the company of the Doctor, or rather, Kamelion in the guise of the Doctor's old enemy, the Master.  And the real Master is using the droid in continuing his feud with the Doctor, but for some other reason as well.
Certain Sarn men have an interesting mix of costume, khaki shorts and Arab style kaffiyehs, whereas the elders have a total Arab-influenced costume, white robes and kaffiyeh headdresses, and the belief of submitting to Logar is a take on Islam, based on submission to Allah.
Nicola Bryant doesn't do too badly in her debut as Peri, the most underdressed companion since Leela (her bikini scenes).  And despite being somewhat of a wimp, she's also got the courage to talk back to the Master.  In response to the Master's ""I am the Master!""  she says ""So what?  I'm Perpugilliam Brown and I can shout just as loud as you can!""  And veteran actor Peter Wyngarde plays Timanov as a leader dedicated to his god to the end.  Another solid performance comes from James Bate as Amyand, leader of the Unbelievers, who bears a slight resemblance to Muammar Qaddafi, especially with his beige headdress.
The reason why Kamelion wasn't used continuously was that his designer Mike Power was killed in a boating accident and left little documentation on how to run the robot, so he was killed off in this story.  A pity, as he did have potential re his abilities.  Here, he's portrayed as a ""silver puppet jumping on a string,"" forced to change his form on someone's mental bidding.
One of Turlough's best stories, and a good one to go out on.  The scenery around Lanzarote is a welcome change from the usual studio sets or quarries doubling as alien worlds.  Not much goes on in the story, but it's still well done.",1077494400,10,3615,4.605304212168487
971804,5,6305138982,"It wasn't the same without Tegan, that is for sure! Peri..God they could have picked a better actress. First of all, the actress is not at all American, and she had to concentrate so hard on keeping her accent hidden, she blew off her acting throughout her time on the TARDIS.  Made you think: Why didn't they just pick an actual American, just like they picked a real Australian to play the Australian air hostess Tegan. And seeing Peri in that bathing suit was just nasty and to base the whole show on that is just bad. Peter Davison was great as always and it surprised me to catch myself teary eyed to see Turlough go. Once again we get to see the Master  played by the master himself, Anthony Ainley, and he's in trouble the whole entire story. The story itself was extremely good, but it's always going to be odd for me since Tegan has and will always be my favorite female companion. I never was a Nicola Bryant fan and probably never will be and once again, I need to make it clear that she was not the best choice for the role and she makes the episodes a little cheesy. But Davison, Ainley, and Strickson are marvelous!",992908800,4,1129,4.345971563981043
971805,2,6305138982,"I will try not to spoil anyone, I promise.
This is -- count 'em:  Peri's first story, Turlough's last story, Kamelion's last story, the story where we finally see the Master ... umm ... in a rather shocking conclusion...,  and the annual travel-abroad-and-waste-a-lot-of-money story (at least one  each required for 1980's season of Dr. Who).  Clearly, there was a lot to  live up to and handle with care for scriptwriter Peter Grimwade. Did he  entirely succeed?  I say no. Did the story truly reek?  That's also a no.  Two stars out of five IS about right.
On the introduction-of-Peri front,  I think ""Planet of Fire"" is not all bad  -- but surely  near-disastrous to say the least.  Peri is, especially to most Americans,  one of the most disliked of companions -- and it's not hard to see why even  in the opening episode of this story.  <The real problem with Peri,  besides her forgiveable and slightly endearingly awfully false accent (she  MUST have English relatives -- or watch far too much PBS) and whiny voice,  is merely her introduction and persistence for the next two years as a  truly pathetic and rather brainless screamer with big boobs.  Only a few  companions ever came across as dimwitted and useless as  ""Perpugilliam"" Brown.>
Point being, though, Peri is  actually, sadly, brought forward here for the first time -- quite  regretfully -- and born wholly annoying right there in the opening few  moments.  She does stupid things and handles them ineptly.  A companion in  Doctor Who is supposed to be the character that one relates to -- the one  that is full of all kinds of empathetic devices that allow us to pretend  we-as-the-bright-eyed-curious-human-audience are right there along with the  Doctor on all of his fabulous adventures.  We never want to see ourselves  in characters that are either stupid or inept.  Peri is both and then some.  And that's a pity... but it can't weigh too much on the appreciation of  just one of her stories.  However, this is her introduction and it doesn't  do her well.  She is handled at her absolute best in the following story,  ""The Caves of Androzani"" and she hadn't quite fallen to absolute  uselessness by the end of this 21st season, either.  While she's not at her  worst yet here though, I still feel bad about how she could have been so  much better... anyway...
The other effects of this story.
Turlough is  let go with very little flair.  He's still a great character upon his last  moments -- and I don't believe he was ever betrayed in this final revealing  of his previously enigmatic origins -- but he's certainly not given the  exit that as fabulous a character as he deserved.  The way I see it...  there was sinply too much to finish up here in four parts.  And Turlough's  exit was perhaps the most underserved element of the story.  It is also  unlikely to an extreme that defies some suspension of disbelief that  Turlough's past would reveal itself like this -- in the contrivances of the  Master's little plan.
Also, Kamelion returns making his sudden and second  -- and last -- appearance here.  This is easily the most contrived part of  the story -- as it was necessary to use Kamelion once more -- as though he  hadn't been forgotten over the past year of disuse -- and it is, like the  rest of ""Planet of Fire"", not altogether bad but clearly nearly  disastrous.  Kamelion's fate is so expected and unimaginative it's almost a  shame that they remembered he was still on board the TARDIS after all that  time.
And, of course, this is also a Master-oriented-story that  follows-up fairly directly-but-indirectly (as was the case with most of his  reappearances in the eighties) from his last appearance (not The Five  Doctors, but The King's Demons).  He's got problems here of all sorts with  his favorite weapon, the Tissue Compression Eliminator (a handy little  black rod that will shrink and compress whatever its operator points it at  -- killing living things: usually people that the Master doesn't like... if  you know what I mean... ahem).  I must say that the Master's problems are  not that large here though... not until the end anyway...
The ending! ...  the ending... which involves a rather interesting and well-jaw-dropping  development concering the Master (like the introduction of Peri here) will  in the immediate future (next season) be almost completely abused and  wasted as a development.
However, the mid-eighties were certainly not the  best time on Doctor who for continuity accuracy or well-handling... and  this was no exception.  The Master's development and sub-plot in  ""Planet of Fire"" might just as well have been left behind as the  use of Kamelion here might have.
And last, but not least, the story  itself:  the healing power of Numismiton Gas on the Planet Sarn with its  Volcanic situation and religious strife and multiplicities of poorly  handled subplots.  Peter Grimwade truly does not fail to entertain,  intrigue, or tie up loose ends here -- but I so much wish things could have  been different.  The overall presentation is fine.  The show is directed  well and it's acted without disaster.  All special effects are carried over  nicely... and the obligatory use of expensive foreign location filming at  Lanzarote is really quite nice.  It's still just a big heaving pile of  disappointment in my eyes though... oh weeeelll: Turlough was a wonderful  companion; Peri was wonderful immediately afterwards in ""The Caves of  Androzani""; the Master was often great in the eighties -- despite his  lacklustre undertreatment here; and Kamelion certainly was interesting upon  first meeting back in ""The King's Demons"" -- the milestones set  here in this disappointment really do involve some good trends -- this is  just another low-point in an era of steep ups AND downs.",933552000,4,5810,4.874356333676622

971885,4,6305138982,"This serial is crammed with multiple worthwhile elements, but is not as exciting throughout as the prior ""Resurrection of the Daleks"". Four pivotal subplots intersect involving the background of Turlough's character, the introduction of new companion Peri, the return of Kamelion, and the return of the Master. The story does not fall apart under the weight, but probably could have played out over five or six.

What adds to the DVD is the generous helping of extras. The likely reason for the ""The Flames of Sarn"" unavailability in different regions is that a few samples of 1980s European pop/rock bands' music play on the soundtrack, complicating the rights for other releases. Frankly, the music is more distracting and cheesy for the featurette that it would have been better without.  The other Special Features, which are not blocked by rights disputed are worthwhile. I have not seen it yet, but there is a feature length version of the serial (66 minutes long compared to the serial's near 100 minute length.

Now, the deciding element - I bought the Region 2 DVD for around $20 compared to the $50+ price for the Region 1 DVD, and have a region free DVD player.  If you're a fan of Doctor Who and collecting the episodes, it's worth to keep the region free/region 2 option open. Some of the Doctor Who Region 1 DVDs are falling out of print, and costing more to buy. The cost of a region free player will balance out without purchasing many non-Region 1 DVDs of Doctor Who if you go that route. Also, the DVD stock is more plentiful.

The story has much to commend itself. The location work is beautiful. It's great to finally get a resolution to the Turlough plot and find out the story behind him. Despite some problems, this was the best Master story since Castrovalva. The solution to what was happening to the Master was genuinely surprising and though a bit silly, quite appropriate for Doctor Who.

7883691,4,6305138982,"I bought the 2-disc special edition. The four half-hour episodes that make up this story are on the first disc. The second disc contains version of the story as a single 66 minute episode. The picture quality and sound are very good considering the year this originally came out. The commentary on this disc features the three main actors and the director. The commentary isn't as fun as other series, Davidson doesn't seem to like this story very much.  The actor playing Turlough had asked to leave Doctor Who as he felt there was nothing more to do with the character and this was his last episode so he is not that enthused about it. Both actors have a hard time remembering much of what was going on in the episode. It's unfortunate because this is Nicola Bryant's first episode and you can sense more enthusiasm on her part but it's dampened by the others. Hopefully the next storyline's commentary will be more interesting.",1486252800,,930,4.670731707317073

7883693,4,6305138982,"POINT OF NOTE: This serial in particular was added to a list of serials the BBC have put on a list of Region 1 DVD's not having more being made. If you are a fan of the series and don't want to resort to buying region 2 DVD's and possible DVD player (though this is honestly a LOT cheaper than buying some of the DW DVD's region 1) then you need to pick this up while you have the opportunity. Especially for under $20 as I write this review of the product.

Planet of Fire takes place on a planet that may have ties to Turlough's past, especially his home planet. The Master comes back in this serial and, for one of the only times in the run, Kameleon takes part in the plot. This serial is the first to feature Nicola Bryant's Peri. While probably not the greatest of all time companions, I still like her. It's the final episode with Turlough and was planned to be an end to the Master for a while until the minds were changed to have him back with the Rani with no explanation. Add this to the collection, you can look up what the story is about elsewhere in these reviews. Worth the purchase.",1483488000,2,1098,4.179245283018868
