8656571,1,B00K7N845S,"I accidentally pressed order as I am used to getting options. I desperately need something like this and have a reformer, but far too many reformer videos don't just require the reformer, they require expensive add ons. This video required three different add ons, one is expensive and one would never fit my machine. I rarely, if ever, return items but this video is not appropriate for me. I want to know how to return my access to this video but cannot find the option to do so anywhere inside the Amazon system. Since this video had no preview, I had no idea what I was getting.

I can barely walk. I need help. This process just stole dollars from a sick person. Shame.

The one video I found online, for free by the way, provided me with one key exercise that helped my back immediately. This video did not have that exercise. Obviously, I need more than one exercise for my back. I also thing that although this video is labelled level one, it is pretty advanced for those of us in extreme pain and very weak from not moving because of the pain.",1495065600,2,1052,4.38974358974359
8656572,5,B00K7N845S,"This is an incredible workout for any of the conditions it is recommended for. I have grade 2-3 spondylolisthesis of the lumbar spine plus a host of other spinal issues. As an avid exerciser and was devastated to find out via my physicians and physical therapists what I can't do. This is a safe DVD with extremely thorough explanations. It is a follow along workout. And yes, it does require a Pilates reformer as indicated in the title.  It has helped my back strength and flexibility tremendously.",1487116800,2,500,4.747126436781609
8656573,1,B00K7N845S,"Expensive workout machine required!  When we ordered this video for my wife, who had a recent back injury, we thought this would be a helpful video for her.  Particularly, after reading the description: ""This is the ideal start to a fitness program for those who have suffered with back pain "" We thought ""Pilates based reformer"" workout was simply a style or approach of Pilates. The description left out that a ""reformer"" is a bulky, expensive looking piece of equipment that is required for EVERY single exercise on the dvd. Had this basic necessity been made clear we wouldn't have bought the DVD. This video is essentially useless to us.

As an instructional video to help people get the most out of their REFORMER EXERCISE MACHINE it may be a wonderful resource.  We have no perspective on that topic.",1409356800,,807,4.784172661870503
