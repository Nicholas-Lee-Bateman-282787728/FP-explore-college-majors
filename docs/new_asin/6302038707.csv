8324367,5,6302038707,I actually bought this for a presentation I had in college. It's very informative and interesting. They even explain how nuclear power works and why it failed in Chernobyl. If you're curious about Chernobyl or are looking for an educational film for class...then you should get it. You may learn a few things from the film.,1241568000,3,323,4.785714285714286

This video should be mandatory viewing in all high schools. - FIVE STAR RATING!!",1191456000,3,254,4.666666666666667
8324369,5,6302038707,"I saw this program on NOVA when it came out.  It is extremely good.  The Internet has very very few good resources about this accident, most are copies of other sites or misinformation.  I wish this video was available so I could buy it.  It has footage I have never seen before including the poor clean-up crews....well. an update on 7/7/2004.  The video finally came up for sale and I bought it.  The video has a track back to Chernobyl with a NOVA reporter and a MIT or Harvard scientist.  They don't go in the reactor but they take measurements throughout.  Strangely, the other 3 reactors where at the time still being used right next to all that radiation!  It seems that the worst has passed and that the radiation levels are quite low.  It showed how the russians were cleaning up and still cleaning up at the time of the video.  Anyway, it was a great video.  The only thing to top that is the elusive ""Suicide Mission to Chernobyl"" originally released by NOVA.  Since I didn't have $25 in the fourth grade I didn't purchase it.  But now I am trying to find a copy and am having no luck.  If you want to sell/loan/whatever your video of Suicide Mission to Chernobyl, please feel free to e-mail me at carey@clyles.com",1018396800,22,1225,4.454954954954955
