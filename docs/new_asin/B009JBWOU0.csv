5341362,2,B009JBWOU0,"Just saw that Amazon.com uploaded the back of this set...

Read it carefully... it basically looks like the first disc of all the Blu-Ray movies with a sample of the actual book that has been available for some time...

I realize that there is an ""Ultimate"" version coming in 2013... but WB has a nack for really screwing the pooch when it comes to ""Ultimate sets"". Look up the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Harry-Potter-Wizard-s-Collection/dp/B007FSEAHY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Harry Potter Wizard's Collection</a>&nbsp;which was also released a few months after the initial Blu-Ray set. Then tell me you still want to wait for a ""better"" set.

I would rather have seen the Bat Cowl include the trilogy, but at this rate what could they possibly do to make it the trilogy ""Ultimate""? Nolan is notorious for not giving any deleted scenes or bonus content... so what exactly would you expect to find other than a prettier box than this lazily put together grab bag of previous (and soon to be released) editions of the individual movies?

Seriously considering just getting the Bat Cowl edition and purchasing the other two movies separately...",1349308800,10,1191,5.491803278688525

Any action film is going to strain credibility in places, but these films do a great job keeping the plausibility pretty high. The extra features, giving great behind the scenes looks, add a lot to the appreciation of the work that went into creating the realistic effects. Lastly, no review of these films would be complete without mentioning the villains. Superb, each with a crippling flaw (tunnel vision, madness, and unquestioning loyalty) that makes them the perfect menace to society.",1501113600,,574,5.117021276595745

Replacing Katie Holmes with Maggie Gyllenhaal was an interesting choice, but a good one. I normally like Katie Holmes, but her acting is just too stiff for this franchise. Heath Ledger as the Joker is just breathtaking. He played that part to perfection. I can't say enough good things about this trilogy. I just love it!",1472342400,,486,4.7976190476190474

5341551,1,B009JBWOU0,"Let me explain exactly what I want.

I just want the two-disc special edition DVDs of all 3 movies in a single box, in a format playable on NTSC region 1 television sets.

Instead, these are my choices: I can buy the two-disc special edition DVDs separately like a loser, I can buy the 3-DVD box and miss out on 3 whole disks' worth of special features, I can buy the Blu-Ray box and lose the ability to back up the movies to my USB hard drive via Smartripper, or I can buy some Region 2 PAL nonsense from Europe and lose the ability to play the movies on an actual TV set (and that's not counting the AVIsynth filtering and other tweaking that I'd have to do in order to restore the movies to their original 24 frames per second for proper viewing on my computers). THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE, WARNER! I ultimately settled for buying the two-disk DVD editions separately because practical concerns outweighed packaging preferences, but I shouldn't have been forced to make that decision in the first place.

I'm genuinely going to send Warner an e-mail about this, or call them or something. If they can release a proper 6-DVD boxed set for the Europeans, then they can make one for North America.",1456099200,4,1194,4.493087557603687

5341586,3,B009JBWOU0,Be aware that the picture showing for the 29.98 trilogy for Batman is an import. The discs will be region free but if you want the ultraviolet copies they will not work in the usa. The imports all have a 12 show on the boxes. Amazon is getting flooded with UK imports and I didn't realize that when I purchased 2 collections for my husband until they arrived. I sent them back and now trying to find US copies at a good price. Discs will work but the codes won't and most discs labels with have spanish written all over them with the english titles in very small print around the outside of the discs.

Spider Man thru to Mrs. Potter is not of my interest.",1431216000,,349,4.028985507246377

The discs have a different bat symbol for each film with The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises stacked on top of their respective special features discs.  The video/audio quality are identical to the previous blu ray releases as are the bonus discs, it is nice to have them all together in one box set though.  If you currently do not own the individual releases of these films and can get a copy of this set, you should pick one up.  I'm glad I did...highly recommended!!!",1431129600,,640,4.539130434782609

5341780,5,B009JBWOU0,"More than entertaining...

I did not like the first Batman trilogy, I found it some own ""empty and cold"". But I was expecting a remake at some time, cause I believed that the content of the BD and television show that I use to look at when I was a child deserved it. Before to buy this trilogy though, I started with Batman Begins to be sure that it will be different. And it was. So I jumped on this set. This last trilogy, with Christian Bale as Batman, was more than entertaining, it carries the original message in a deeper and darker realistic drama, I believe you'll understand what I mean when you will look at the begining of the first movie, at the second one with the Joker and the end of the third part, an ending that surprised me as well.

I will resume this way : If like me you did not like the first trilogy but If you do like a balance in the combination of a realistic human approach, a stronger emotional and action aspects, than try this one. You might enjoy it very much.",1425859200,,992,4.18848167539267

5341813,5,B009JBWOU0,"The absolute best Batman films ever made ( in my opinion, and with all due respect to my previous favorite Batman: Michael Keaton ).  I guess the reason is that the Burton films ( I can't count Batman Returns, it's kinda bad...) failed to really dive into The Dark Knight.  Nolan really treats the subject with respect and doesn't overdo it with the gothic or campy elements of previous incarnations.  That said, Adam West is fantastic!  Thematically, the films all tie together.  This is a must own for fans of the comic, the show, and even the Burton films ( I can't even acknowledge the other films although Val was pretty good in a terrible film and George, I love ya, but just can't go there. ).  Lastly, I have to give applause to all of the actors in this trilogy.  Christian Bale nails it, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman are indispensable, Gary Oldman JGL and Anne Hathaway: great, Heath Ledger is by far not only the best villain, but absolutely THE JOKER, and even though he caught a lot of flack, Tom Hardy was fantastic with just his voice and his eyes.",1423785600,,1067,4.4974093264248705

Something I find odd about this set is that the digital movie codes for Batman Begins and Dark Knight are for the standard def version of the movie but Dark Knight Rises is the HD version; why aren't they all the HD version?

Pro-tip:
Make sure to set your sound to stereo if you're watching these through your TV's speakers and not a sound system. That seems like a no-brainer but this usually ins't a problem for me, most blu-ray players will auto-detect if you can do surround or stereo, but 2 different blu-ray players tried to play these in surround sound through the TV which caused a lot of weird popping noises.",1420070400,,706,4.515625

5341949,4,B009JBWOU0,"the recent (not to mention long overdue) dvd release of the classic Adam West tv series was such a happy turn of events that it prompted me to check in on the more recent productions. having done so, i'm afraid i have to make certain retractions.
specifically, i pointed out that Batman is a carbon-copy of a character called The Shadow (right down to the millionaire playboy secret identity!), and argued that the tv series is the best version because it's the only one where Batman manages to get out of The Shadow's, well, shadow and become something unique to himself. that much i still stand by.
it turns out i was wrong to suggest that the ""Dark Knight"" version of the character was completely valueless on that basis. i said as much based on the earlier franchise, the Tim Burton/Joel Shumacher films, which turned out upon rediscovery to be exactly the cheesy, fiasco(s) i remembered. but the more recent Christopher Nolan films - which i regret to have to say i never bothered to see before this - proved that there's something workable in the formula after all. well, better late, as they say, than never.
the best installment is Batman Begins, not least because it actually addressed what Tim Burton so woefully neglected. the most obvious improvement concerns the murder of Bruce Wayne's parents when he was a child. Nolan enables us to witness the tragedy itself, and accompany Bruce on the journey of frustration and recovery that follows. taking a hint from that Citizen Kane of superhero movies, Richard Donner's Superman, Nolan actually develops the backstory, whereas Burton just sort of finally got around to mentioning it in passing.
another interesting bonus is that it doesn't opt for the obvious villains. the most most comic-bookish antagonist here is The Scarecrow, a corrupt psychiatrist who uses gas to induce hallucinations and preys on the subsequent fear. the principle foe, however, is Liam Neeson as head of an organization called The League Of Shadows. (a tip of the hat to Batman's template, maybe?) the way The League works is, if a civilization becomes too corrupt, they destroy it so it can be rebuilt from scratch. and Gotham is on their hit list.
if the film errs anywhere, it's in neglecting to explain that Neeson's criminal alias, ""Ra's Al Gul,"" translates to ""Demon's Head.""
The Dark Knight is a masterful film and well worth seeing, but nonetheless one of the more overrated films of the last decade or so. the premature death of Heath Ledger, a few months before the release, prompted some to treat it with kid gloves. (and not just critics: richly as Ledger deserved that Oscar, how likely do think it is that he would've gotten it had he been around to collect it?) it has it's fair share of imperfections, which we'd no doubt of heard more about, had the critics not graded it on a curve.
take the trip to Hong Kong, for instance. there's a good 10 minutes of needless, pointless ballast right there.
the opportunity i most regret the loss of is an early glimpse of vigilante Batman imitators. this unofficial variation on Sherlock Holmes' ""Baker Street Irregulars"" strikes me as fraught with story possibilities. but alas, they just sort of evaporate after 40 minutes or so.
the clumsiest part of the film is it's treatment of Harvey Dent. his role as unflappably ethical district attorney, as ""Gotham's White Knight,"" is firmly established and richly explored, but given that he dies, his transition into Two-Face comes too late in the film (somewhere around the 100-minute mark) to be anything but an anticlimax. when he crossed to the dark side, he feels more like The Joker's tool than a character in his own right.
but hey, every film has such nits waiting to be picked. just because it has a few such blemishes doesn't make it unworthy of your time.
not least of the film's redeeming qualities his Heath Ledger. Jack Nicholson has been officially out-Joker'd! although on second glance, it doesn't seem to of been hard. looking back, one notices that Nicholson, for all his supposed greater sophistication, in fact takes much the same court-jester approach to role as Cesar Romero had. (all that's missing is the mustache under the makeup.) whereas Ledger's take results in a genuinely formidable lunatic. Nicholson also played him as a psychotic, but his Joker is nowhere near as creepy as Ledger's.
The Dark Knight Rises is a mostly satisfying resolution. it's about 20 minutes longer than it really needed to be, but it manages to bring the odyssey full-circle.
next to it's length, it primary weakness is it's bland central villain, going by the prosaic name of Bane. this character has no significant gimmick beyond being a textbook bully. where we could've had a Riddler or a Mr. Freeze, we get...a would-be pro-wrestler in a S&M ""fetish"" mask. i'm frankly afraid to ask what the thinking was there.
happier is the treatment of Catwoman. the character's history is a bit of a revolving door, being love interest and adversary in roughly equal measure. (there have even been times when, to all appearances, Batman has managed to convert her to law and order.) i have to say, Anne Hathaway initially struck me as a bit too aristocratic for the role, but put to the test she manages to neatly straddle the extremes. she'll make you forget Halle Berry, if not necessarily Julie Newmar.
maybe it's not quite fair to compare the two franchises. these are films with a certain psychological depth, whereas the '90s films weren't really trying to be anything but ""popcorn"" movie escapism. but the fact remains that the premise just works better with Nolan's approach. the character is capable of more than fisticuffs. these films have a heart to them that Burton's/Schumacher's films don't even seem to realize is possible.
i repeat that my favorite approach to Batman is the satire of the '60s series, and as such my Batman of choice is Adam West, first, last, and always. but i have to admit, Christian Bale makes for a pretty good runner-up.",1417046400,,5997,4.84031158714703

5341963,5,B009JBWOU0,"The Dark Knight trilogy is an amazing superhero franchise that knows Batman inside out. I am a huge comic book fan and I praise the Batman legacy. In the 1990's Tim Burton made the first Batman series in Waner Brothers, but the series he created was getting pale and lame. But in 2005, the studio decieded to restart the franchiese in a big and realistic way.

1st Batman Begins was good start for bringing up Batman's origin and his first major fight with supevillains.

2nd was The Dark Knight. It is a truly welldone sequel and crypresses the hipe of Batman Begins. This movie recieved 6 Academy Awards and two wins for Best Sound Editing and Best Supporting Actor. That's right, I'm talking about Heath Leager, aka, The Joker! He was amazing playing the villain for Batman. The story is well written and the film it's self can leave no words but amazing.

3rd is The Dark Knight Rises. The coundulding chapter of the trilogy. It was awasome to see the story come to end for Batman in this film. There are 4 reasons on why I like the film: Batman, Catwoman, Bane, and the director himself Christopher Nolan.
Batman is in the center of it all and really gets to shine. Catwoman is little bit different, different as in amazing in 4 scopes: beatiful both inside and out, deadly, manipulative, and sexy. Anna Hatthway is a wonderful fit for Nolan's version of the Batman universe. Bane is a great villain in this movie. U know who he is, how he does it, and why he does it. Christopher Nolan is the archutiect of this blockbuster film franchise. He is an indie director who made films like The Following and Memento before he made batman. He is both a visonary and a film director.

The Dark Knight Trilogy is an amazing superhero franchise that really brings out the bar of superhero films.

Score Board

Batman Begins: 4.5/5 great :)

The Dark Knight: 5/5 amazing :D

5341979,5,B009JBWOU0,"The Dark Knight Trilogy consists of the Christopher Nolan Batman films made namely: Batman Begins,The Dark Knight, and The Dark Knight Rises.

*Batman Begins - Batman Begins tells the story of how Bruce Wayne,who leads a privileged life,brings it upon himself to providing protection to the citizens of the crime-ridden Gotham City by disguising himself as a masked caped crusader after his parents were murdered.

*The Dark Knight - The Dark Knight is a sequel to Batman Begins, which finds the titular superhero coming face to face with his greatest nemesis -- Joker.

*The Dark Knight Rises - The Dark Knight Rises provides a stunning conclusion to the trilogy wherein Bruce Wayne decides to don the mask as Batman after an 8-year absence with the emergence of a mercenary whose objective is to destroy Gotham City.

This is definitely one of the best movie trilogies ever made on the big screen. A lover of great films should not hesitate to own it and add it to his list of collection.",1413936000,,990,4.805882352941176

5342044,5,B009JBWOU0,"I love what Nolan was able to do with the Batman universe in this trilogy.

The video and audio in this collection are all top-notch. I especially love the scenes that were shot in Imax, as they look and sound amazing. No complaints in the video, presentation, or audio department.

Extras: If you already own all three movies on blu ray, then stick with those. The supplemental material isn't worth a double dip purchase in my humble opinion. There are some cool special features and behind the scenes stuff, but nothing that can't be found online. The ""Art and Making of"" preview booklet is cool, but I already owned the full book. Overall, if you don't have any of the Nolan Batman movies, then you won't be disappointed with this set.

The movies are a darker take on the super hero genre and very well-made. Christian Bale plays the Batman in all three movies, and although some hate Bale's Batman, to me he pulls off one of the best Batman portrayals we have, right up there next to Michael Keaton. He has the swagger for Wayne, and the intimidation factor to pull off a good Batman. It's all in one's opinion, and I enjoyed Bale as the Dark Knight in this trilogy.

All three movies are terrific. My favorite of the three has to be The Dark Knight, which introduced us all to Ledger's mesmerizing Joker. The Dark Knight is simply an amazing film, with Ledger's Joker stealing every scene he's in. Batman Begins edges out the Dark Knight Rises for me because we finally got to see Al-Ghul on film, and I'm a sucker for well-made origin stories. Rises is the weakest of the three in my opinion, but it's still a pretty good movie. The highlight for me was Tom Hardy as Bane, which I really enjoyed. The plot of Rises was the weakest of the three (the plot holes!) but it wraps up the trilogy with a satisfying conclusion.

Are all the movies perfect? No, but they are very well directed, acted, and very entertaining. If you're a Batman fan, you won't be disappointed.",1408924800,,1973,4.515406162464986

Although, I do have to say that the cover art from the DVD release is a bit better. You get all three films and its bonus features all in one box. Looking at some unboxing videos, I don't find the ""Ultimate"" Collectors Edition worth buying. The only standouts from the set is a 6th bonus disc with a retrospective, Nolan talking with Richard Donner on how the two brought DC's biggest heros to the big screen, a letter from Nolan himself, and some art from Mondo. The art book seems underwhelming compared to the 2012 box set art book, in my opinion. The $20-$30 you pay is WELL worth it.",1405209600,,738,4.394160583941606

5342148,5,B009JBWOU0,I like the packaging. It seems so many dvd or blu ray box sets come out with horrible packaging. I think this looks great on the shelf. It is a bit of a tight squeeze in the box with the book which makes it a bit of a pain to get the stuff out but not too bad.,1399420800,,260,3.5
5342149,5,B009JBWOU0,"I won't get into the details of the movies themselves as everyone who is reading this most likely loves the movies enough to consider a trilogy box set. So I'll save you plot points etc. I will only said that this is a great trilogy. The first two Tim Burton movies set the bar pretty high (of course the third and fourth in that series lowered the bar so much you would assume they were starting a limbo contest). But Nolan picks up on the edgier Burton films (edgier than previous tv/movie incarnations) and took off with it. The end result is a more or less fulfilling trilogy with great special effects grounded in a very real environment. Gotham can be any major metropolitan city with a gritty, dark underside.

Now onto the box set, it's pretty well made the vehicles included are great (but it sucks that you can't take them out and replace them in the packaging...even though we are adults it's still fun to play a little, or at least look at our toys). The frame able prints are interesting as they are somewhat conceptual, and would look nice on your wall (I used my scanner to make a copy so I can post one on my wall and keep the original safe). The included art book is nice and has a really good look and feel to it. It's glossy but it has parts that do not seem glossy which gives it a unique look. It reminds me of comic books where you get covers that have parts that stand out, and others that are almost faded into the background which draws your eyes in more. It's hard to explain, but, as I was saying it has a nice look and feel to it. Too bad it's not a hardcover book.

The ""book"" that holds the cd is nice as well. Each movie is showcased on their own set of pages. Batman Begins only has one blu ray disc the other two have two. and there is a bonus disc as well (that is separate than the bonus discs that came out with the individual movies). the cd holder part of the page is designed in such a way as the art on the cd completes the art on the page. Almost like a puzzle piece. it's a great idea, except one of the movies the cds are black to fit the image so it's not as impressive as the one where you have part of the batpod wheel printed on the disc to complete the picture. It's a small thing but it makes it more fun and interesting. This is a hardcover book, and the art in it is phenomenal as well.

The movies look and sound great, and the bonus disc, while not overwhelming has a few things that are worth taking a look at. Notably is seeing Chris Nolan and Richard Donner discuss their iconic superhero movies, as Superman was a definite inspiration to Nolan (his words). Overall this is a great and exciting set and a great way to get all three movies in one place. if you're a huge fan of batman like I am then this is something you shouldn't pass up. I showed it to my brother (who lives in the same house) and when he saw it he got himself a copy as well. So that should tell you something. While this is a great set, It's probably too much for the casual fan, but at the same time it may draw you deeper into the batman mystique. It's a definite must have for any movie/superhero movie collector.",1399248000,,3143,4.149180327868852

They may not be cannon in the DC universe, but they're still great films overall.  They picked great actors and great villains for these films; Ra'z Al Ghul, Scarecrow, Joker, Two Face, Bane and Talia Al Ghul.  Christopher Nolan has already proven to be one of the greatest Directors of all time with this trilogy and films like Inception Memento and The Prestige.

5342171,5,B009JBWOU0,"These three Movies are excellent. In many of the key roles you have star quality actors. Many of the faces you will recognize right away. As a matter of fact, you'd recognize their voices long before you'd see them. The films, like the new James Bond movies, dove-tail together to form a mini-series. These films come after many years of pulp comic books, children's Saturday Matinees serials and a very ""campy"" 60s TV series. Also, the numerous Batman movies through out the 70s, 80s & 90s of the last century. This set comes with a really nice booklet, full of beautiful pictures and drawings. It's also worth mentioning that the ""Special Features"" are full of facts and commentary. I would like to say a few words about the man who plays the Joker in the ""Dark Knight"": Heath Ledger. It's so sad to see such a great talent die so young. His performance as the Joker was inspired. His menace came from some where very dark. When he says; "" Why so sad ? Let's put a smile on that face"" all the while brandishing a straight razor. You really believe he could and would do it. Actors like that don't come along very often. You will watch this set over and over again. Enjoy ! PS. I can almost guarantee another outing for the rest of this ensemble. RIP. Heath",1396396800,,1258,4.45021645021645

The first two movies experienced static or the movie dropping out/the screen going to black 2 or 3 times during the movie. The third movie's audio was mastered WAY weird with Bane's voice being 2 to 3 times louder than all of the other actors' voices.

The movies themselves were phenomenal and this could have just been my player/copies of the movies, but I would check out other reviews before paying full price for this box set. If you get it on sale, it's still a solid deal unless you're a super fan or purist.",1396224000,,640,4.378151260504202

Blu-ray is the way to go for better quality content especially if you are a Playstation 3 or 4 owner. The movies as many know are the best portrayal of our favorite hero and does well to please viewers until the final conclusion. Not many comic book hero movies can achieve a masterpiece trilogy except for the ones made by geniuses like Christopher Nolan.  The plot, the acting, the action scenes in all three movies are fantastic and extraordinary (if not perfect).

5342240,4,B009JBWOU0,"Christopher Nolan's epic 3 part Batman journey has come to an end, and with it comes the trilogy box set. This review is for the Ultimate Trilogy Set which includes, 6 Blu Rays, 5 pictures of villain art from Mondo, 48 page photo book, and reproduction toys of the Tumbler, Bat Pod, and the Bat. As well the set includes all 3 movies on Ultra Violet digital copy.

The set overall is great, but sadly not amazing at all. Sure we get all 3 films in stunning Blu Ray quality, and the quality is indeed great, however there aren't that many new added bonus features in this set. Batman Begins has its original Blu Ray release 1 disc in this set, The Dark Knight has its original 2 disc Blu Ray in this set, The Dark Knight Rises has its original 2 disc Blu Ray in this set, and finally we get a bonus Blu Ray with special features. The first 5 discs are indeed filled with many hours of special features. However these Blu Rays have been out for years, except for TDKR which was released about 10 months before this set. The bonus 6th disc with special features only runs about 1 hour and 50 minutes. Then cuts up the IMAX scenes from TDK and TDKR to make it look bigger. Which is truly pointless, because you can watch all of these great IMAX scenes simply by watching them during the normal course of watching those films. The first documentary is another behind the scenes look at things. It is very interesting, however we have seen a lot of documentaries likes this very one on the first three movies. Then we get a sit down discussion with Christopher Nolan, and Superman 1978 direct Richard Donner. This is truly an amazing thing to watch. Sadly it only runs at about 25 minutes.

The biggest problem with this set is how the discs are placed in the set itself. The 6 Blu Ray discs are each placed in a book style casing. The problem with this setup however is every time you take a disc out and put it back in you need to slide it into a slot. This can and easily does cause scratches and sometimes even glue on the disc. This type of box set has been done before with the very same problems, yet WB couldn't realize this major problem.

With the lack of any great new special features and the fact that the casing system for the discs is terrible this set gets a 4 out of 5. The set is wonderful to own if you are a collector like myself, or if you just haven't bought Batman Begins or The Dark Knight on Blu ray yet.",1391385600,,2423,4.240259740259741

5342251,5,B009JBWOU0,"I have to admit that I allowed for several years the sensational tragic events pertaining to the 2nd and 3rd installments of this story to keep me away from watching it.  But, I am glad that I finally did watch all three of the films within a two day period. And I found them to be very well done in every respect.  The movies had complex storylines that were so well conceived and the action sequences were so impressive.  Having then watched the Special features I came to really see that these films were painstakingly watched over and developed by the Director Christopher Nolan.  He demanded that the live action shots be filmed as much as possible through actual well executed stunts and avoided an over use of CGI.  This gives the movies a more realistic gritty feel.  These are films for adult minds not at all juvenile or silly.  The villains are sinister and unsettling.  The good guys have flaws and don't always stay on the side of good at all.  People are so often not what we presume and mask their true nature.  This trilogy knows that fact.",1391040000,,1056,4.510526315789473

Amazon had a great deal on the combined trilogy. My only disappointment surrounding Begins is on me, that I had not watched it sooner. Great movie! Dark Night was that much better having watched Begins. While Rises wrapped up with a great ending, the plot line seemed to draw out too long regarding Bane. First that voice, oy, it might have had all kinds of intentional background story, but it was distracting, and annoying after a while. However, what an emotional roller coaster I found myself on the last 20 minutes of the movie.

Total action, total integration of plot-line from movie to movie...making an over 6 hour seamless story that works perfectly. A little bit of a stretch but keep in mind suspension of disbelief and enjoy this epic tale. Now, does ""Catwoman"" and ""Joker"" both hold up to the characters represented in the original Time Burton versions? In my opinion, NO ONE will EVER top Michelle Pfeiffer's portrayal of the feline temptress, and Jack Nicholson's portyal holds up on it's own to this day, but Heath Ledger NAILED the role...with a pencil and a magic trick. JEEZ! Both sets, the two Burton versions (the rest that followed are terrible) and the three Dark Knight versions are both fantastic visions of the hero, just through different eyes and different times. But no one, PERIOD, wore the cowl with the same presence as the fantastic portrayal by Michael Keaton. Christian Bale may be tougher, more cut...but Michael owed the mystique of the ""Dectective"".

But for pure story telling, for action for just plain fun, get this trilogy!",1389225600,3,1150,4.897435897435898

I updated the player to the latest firmware and still no luck. I contacted Amazon and they replaced a set within 2 days. The replacement still did not work. I brought the disc to my friend's and it worked (though still a bit laggy at the place where it froze on my player. I ended up getting a new player from Samsung and it worked like a charm.

5342344,5,B009JBWOU0,"The only other trilogies that comes close or on par with this trilogy is the LOTR/Hobbit trilogies. Having said that I will now begin my review.

Batman Begins : This one is my favorite film of the three, but I am a bit hesitant to say that as a ""for sure"" thing as all three have strengths that attract me to them, so my favorite has changed among the three. Ultimately this one stays on top. Why? Well not because it was an origin story, but because it was realistic. And by realistic I mean hey this could happen. Also this was Bale's best performance as Batman, the other two were more pointed toward Bruce Wayne which is fine too. And in Batman Begin's his voice was perfect. Lastly I am one of few who thought Katie Holmes was the perfect Rachel, and sadly did not stick around (unknown reason, for me) for the 2nd and 3rd. Her and Bale's chemistry were top notch.

Note: The scene in which Batman ""becomes"" Batman and Bale delivers the classic ""I'm Batman"" was the best scene of the film. In my personal opinion.

The Dark Knight : For many months, heck years now Ledger stole the show every time. However upon multiple viewings I think Aaron Eckhart shined more, not to say Ledger wasn't great (he totally deserved the Oscar) but Eckhart is pretty bland usually but really went above and beyond in this film. I was also impressed with the usage of Bruce Wayne in this film, making Batman equals with the real person for once. That isn't to say you see less of Batman, but instead notice that Bruce Wayne is the real person and vice verse depending on the scene.  The action was amped up in a grand fashion for this film, giving Batman the necessary budget and giving DC the upper hand on the superhero genre, sadly until Man of Steel they lacked in commitment to other superheros.

The Dark Knight Rises : This one shines for completely different reasons then the previous installments, and is centered on Bruce Wayne, and what Gotham has done to him, and the other way around. It also shows you without beating it in your head that Batman is a symbol, not just a person. And not just a crime fighter who dresses up, but a person willing to sacrifice and make a difference. As for villains, Bane was great. If I say anything else it will spoil to much for those who for whatever reason have yet to watch this great trilogy.

I highly recommend this film trilogy based on the Caped Crusader, The Dark Knight. It is the only the 2nd trilogy to get my 10/10, 5/5 star rating for every film, and as a whole.

Thanks for reading and enjoy this :).",1388966400,,2550,4.389830508474576
5342345,1,B009JBWOU0,"First, my review has nothing to do with the movies...I purchased a Blu-ray versions because I really love the films...my issue is with the product.

As I watched these movies, I kept noticing that the aspect ratio was morphing back and forth between 16:9 to widescreen (meaning, one scene would fill the entire screen and the next scene would have the black bars at the top and bottom). This was tremendously distracting!

It got to a point where the morphing was keeping me from enjoying the movies. And there didn't seem to be any type of setup or control over this in the disc menuwhich would indicate that this is intentional functionality.

I just can't enjoy a movie with this going onand I'll admit my Blu-ray disc player is about three years old which could be an issue, but I'm thinkingNOT.

If you really like to sit down and enjoy a movieand like things just sothis morphing thing could ruin your experience as well. Just FYI...

And on a personal note...if I see this morphing in other Blu-ray discs, I'll purchase a newer player...and if that doesn't make a difference, I think I'll have to just forego Blu-ray all together...dang nab-it, Musky!",1388966400,,1158,4.712871287128713

5342402,3,B009JBWOU0,"I needed to let some time go by and let these movies sink in before writing a full review on all three of Christopher Nolan's Batman movies. Its now been over 9 years since Batman Begins so I think it has been long enough.

I must first off let everyone know that Batman is my all-time favorite superhero.

I really enjoyed these movies when they first came out but they haven't been able to grow on me as well as Burton's, or even Schumacher's for that matter. I think the only reason I really enjoyed them was because the comic fan community hypes these movies up so much. I have realized after awhile that to me the comic fan community is wrong about a lot of things. The characters in this trilogy have a ""grounded and realistic"" feel to them as many fans like to say. They are definitely more grounded and realistic than in any other Batman movie that's for sure. But, I don't think this is a good thing in a Batman movie.

When I go and see a superhero movie I want to see some fantasy and have some fun. The characters in Nolan's movie are so serious that they lack fantasy and because of this the movies aren't allowed to have that much fun. This is where I believe the problems with this trilogy start. Watching these films its obvious that Nolan wanted Batman to be real. But Batman isn't real and neither is Gotham City, its fantasy. I do think that all of the cast give absolutely excellent performances but unfortunately to me they aren't that much fun.

The second problem I have in Nolan's version is his Gotham City. It looks far too much like Chicago because it is Chicago. Gotham City is a made up and fictitious city with many large building that have a Gothic and very distinctive feel to them. Tim Burton knew this and pulled it off better than anyone. Even Joel Schumacher made his Gotham City look like a place that isn't real and is pure fantasy, and exterior shots of his Arkham Assylum are very Gothic. It seems Nolan wanted Gotham City to be so real that he didn't care about the comic history of Gotham City and just wanted to ground his characters in Chicago.

A very personal pet peeve of mine is Nolan's version of the Batmobile, which he calls the Tumbler. This is a car where you can let your mind run totally free and create whatever kind of menacing bat-inspired car that is as over the top as you can think of, and Nolan came up with a black tank car. To me this is a huge letdown in such an iconic piece of the comic history. I know there have been many different versions of the Batmobile in the comics and some fans do love Nolan's, but for me personally I hated it. But I did love the other three Batmobiles from the movies before these.

Now I'm going to get into the movies themselves. All three of them seem to suffer from pacing issues and seem to be much too long because of this. It almost seems like a chore watching these because they feel like they drag on too long. For me this gives Nolan's Batman movies the least amount of re-watchabiltiy. I find myself constantly going back to watch Batman, Batman Returns, Batman Forever and Batman & Robin because all four of those are like a rollercoaster ride. They go out to do what they are trying to do, take you for the ride, and then its over. Nolan's films just seem to drag on and on, especially in parts where they shouldn't, and I find myself not wanting to watch them that frequently because of this. And its not just his Batman movies, all of Nolan's films seem to suffer from this over-done type of effort. The movie should be winding down but he wants to keep cooking it.

Batman Begins is in my opinion the best of his films as its a great origin story and it does the best job setting out to do what its trying to do. The Dark Knight though seems to stray and drag on far too long past the point when you feel like the movie should be winding down to an end. I hate to say this but I have to compare Nolan to Michael Bay in this regard. The movie or the scene should have come to an end but he just seems to keep extending it as long as possible. Heath Ledger's Joker performance is the best part of this movie, but in my opinion Jack Nicholson's was better. My least favorite of his Batman movies though would have to be The Dark Knight Rises. This movie sets Batman off from the absolute bottom and you watch him build himself back up for an hour of the movie, then the character falls to where he was in the beginning of the movie, then you are building him up again for nearly another hour and a half. To me this is exhausting as an audience member, and it becomes a Batman movie without Batman, and its not enjoyable at all because of this. By the time the third act of the movie comes around I am ready to head home, to me this movie is just over done. Also the way he brought Robin into this movie is just a slap in the face.",1388534400,,4839,4.23051948051948
5342403,5,B009JBWOU0,"The Batman is my absolute favorite super hero and these are my absolute favorite movies about him. I was very upset when I heard a rumor that there will not be anymore of these will Christian Bale or the same director. VERY VERY UPSET!!! I hope the rumor is a vicious lie but is looking to be more and more true.

The extra disc alone is worth the money to see the unseen 70 minute doc and all.
The toys are choice, solid, like the best Hot Wheels you'll ever own.
It looks fantastic, smells like that great new boxed set smell, and it hammers home the power of the films as no matter how many times I've seen them...as soon as I get them in any new form I have to watch from Begins to Rises and just relish how much I truly love these movies.
If you love them...buy this thing. It sits so well next to my numbered Big Lebowski bowling ball collector's set and now I have a great display to really Bat up the old cinema room with.
Excuse me now I need to go play with the Tumbler and see if it beats Keaton's Batmobile or if Adam West will own the day yet again.",1388448000,,946,4.037234042553192

What Nolan did with the trilogy raised the bar for not just superhero movies, but all summer blockbusters in general.  I imagine most people already have seen these films (and perhaps you even own them on blu-ray), so the question before us is as follows: Is the Ultimate Edition worth a purchase?

Well, there are two things that set this collector's edition apart:

1. THE BONUS DISC
This set comes with an exclusive bonus disc, which contains the following:
- The Fire Rises - a 75-minute documentary that looks back at the impact and making-of the trilogy.  It's a great documentary with some behind-the-scenes footage and new interviews, but it is by no means comprehensive.  I feel they are only scratching the surface, and as a big fan of these movies I wanted much more.
- Interview with Christopher Nolan and Richard Donner - these two filmmakers have a discussion about superheroes, and they discuss the influence of Donner's Superman films on Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy.
- Original IMAX Footage - all the IMAX scenes from The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises.  Scenes are presented in their original aspect ratio, meaning the image is framed exactly as it would be on a real 70mm/15 perf IMAX screen.

2. THE COLLECTIBLES
The Ultimate Collector's Edition includes the following memorabilia:
- Outer Box is labeled Limited Edition and is individually numbered.
- 3 Hot Wheels mini vehicle figures - The Tumbler, the Batpod, and the Bat.
- Hardcover Book, which also serves as the disc storage (the discs do not come in normal blu-ray cases)
- Collectible Booklet w/ images from the films, includes some production photos/concept art.
- 5 Art Cards (measure 7x10 inches) - Ra's al Ghul, Scarecrow, The Joker, Two-Face, and Bane
- Letter from Christopher Nolan (printed on card stock)

So that's it.  There was just enough extra content and collectibles to make this worth a purchase for me.  Still, there are a number of other things I wish were included.  In terms of special features, they're still a bit sparse on making-of videos (especially when compared to the Lord of the Rings and Star Wars bonus material).  How about an in-depth look at filming with IMAX cameras?  And we never got any deleted/extended scenes on any of the blu-ray releases.  As the for collectible items, they are nice (I really like the villains art cards) - but I would say they fall slightly short of the collectibles included in other WB Ultimate sets (such as The Wizard of Oz and Gone with the Wind, etc).

Overall, this set is probably worth it if you are a big fan of the Batman films.  But for casual viewers, the Ultimate Edition can probably be skipped.  I certainly don't regret buying it, but I was left slightly disappointed and would have loved even more content and higher-quality collectibles.

5342505,5,B009JBWOU0,"Note: This is a product specific review for the 6-disc Blu-ray Ultimate Collectors Edition released in September of 2013.

===============================================================

If you're reading this, chances are you've seen the movies and you love the series. And, sadly, chances are you probably already own one, two, or all three movies on DVD/Blu-ray and you're thinking if you want to double dip on this ultimate collectors eddition. Hopefully this review can help you make tha decision!

First off, let me go over the contents:
- There are 6 Blu-ray Discs, the contents of the first 5 discs are 100% identical to the previously released versions, but the print is redesigned to fit the art in the hardcover book where the discs sit (kind of like the Bond 50 set). the 6th disc has new contents.
  1) Batman Begins Disc
  2) Dark Knight Movie Disc
  3) Dark Knight Bonus Features Disc
  4) Dark Knight Rises Movie Disc
  5) Dark Knight Rises Bonus Feature Disc
  6) Ultimate Trilogy Bonus Feature Disc
- a 48-page picture book, pretty awesome!
- 3 standard hot-wheels sized replicas of the bat mobile, the bat pod, and the bat. they're small but relatively high quality (like all hot wheels cars)
- a set of 5 villains cards, the size are the about the same size as the box itself.
- a letter from Christopher Nolan (pretty lame with not much added value IMHO)

The next section I will focus the review on the content of the 6th disc that is never before released.

The new bonus disc has 3 special features, a documentary (about 90 minutes), a featurette, and the IMAX sequences from the Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises. Now while most people will think the IMAX footage included here is pointless, this is actually the feature that made me decide to double dip on this set, this is why:

The IMAX sequences presented here are in its original 1.44:1 IMAX aspect ratio, and they simply look awesome! It is letterboxed to fit the screen (black bars on left and right) but if you have a projector or a big enough screen, sit a little closer to your screen and it will blow you away! I played it on my 1080p projector's 120"" screen, with the 1.44:1 IMAX aspect ratio, the screen turns out to be about 100"" or a little less. but after moving my seat forward a little, it's just amazing! over 100 minutes of IMAX goodness! Still haven't finished it yet but I just love love love it!! This is my new demo disc!

A few little complaints tho,

1) This is my major complaint: They still left out a few IMAX shots from both movies, generally the 3-to-5-second second-unit shots they use in between scenes. I'm particularly unhappy about missing the Hong Kong day scene when Fox's helicopter lands on the helipad, and the sea plane landing shot. Those are among the most beautiful shots in ""The Dark Knight"".

2) When they intertwine normal 2.35:1 and IMAX 1.44:1 shots, the 2.35:1 shots expand to the sides of you 16:9 Blu-ray frame (the ""normal"" look) and the 1.44:1 shots has black bars on the left and right sides. so in a sense, you're neither getting constant height NOR constant width! I'd like to see a constant width presentation, but this is just a minor complaint

Overall, the collector items and this disc made double dipping worthwhile IMHO",1384473600,7,3265,4.661431064572426
5342506,5,B009JBWOU0,"Fantastic packaging.  I didn't buy any of the movies individually, knowing that this would eventually come out, and it is everything that I wanted.  The art cards are gorgeous.",1384473600,,176,5.0344827586206895

The disc booklet and holders are neat and well made and continue the dark blue and black theme as seen on the box. The box itself is less than desirable in its presentation and feel, but works. The accompanying book seems to be an advertising crackerjack-ish prize to entice you to buy the real book it is sourced from. It's nice but nothing special. The real specials, are the special features. Loads of making of documentaries and behind the scenes featurettes. No noticeable differences in picture quality or sound that I can detect from the single movie blu ray release and this when comparing TDKR.

Then I saw that this set was announced and I became intrigued. The content on this package is pretty good, although I do think for the price they could have added some more things, more collectibles.
The artwork and the HotWheels versions of his cars (and plane) are awesome. The extra feature length documentary that was thrown in there is awesome too, although that too could have been better, especially with some Heath Ledger commentary.

All in all, if you are a fan of the franchise and/or like to collect things from movie history, I would definitely recommend this for you or for a gift! They won't be disappointed.",1382400000,,760,4.547445255474453

For the price you get so much stuff. I had the smaller set as well and that one is gorgeous too which i gave to my best friend. I think this new is one of nicer box sets i have and as I said if you are collector. (and its's limited edition which has the sticker on the front telling you the number) it was pre ordered because it came out on birthday and it came right of sept 24 packaged nicely.

5342554,3,B009JBWOU0,This has all 3 movies on blueray my opinion is the first is a good movie the second is ok the third was realy bad,1379980800,,113,3.56
5342555,5,B009JBWOU0,"Okay, so when I was considering buying this Trilogy set, I had already known for sure that I wanted to own the movies. But for DVD, I wasn't sure how good this edition would be. One of the things that bugged me a little was that most of the reviews here is for the Blu-ray version, which includes bonus content in film and artwork. As a young guy who isn't crazy about comics or comicbook movies, but who still loves Christopher Nolan's original approach to the Batman franchise, I knew I only needed the DVD edition, and that'd be good enough for me. But for the listed price? I wanted to be sure it would be WORTH it. You guys out there, reading this review...you know what I mean. You hate getting ripped off with the purchase of a DVD when you are forced to get Blu-ray to get the REAL good stuff.
 But have no worries. This set is good enough for you if you're like me: like the movies, want above average packaging, and a little bit of fancy artwork that sets it apart from regular DVDs. As mentioned above, this DVD edition only comes with the three movies and no special features, except for BATMAN BEGINS (which is like the regular, individual DVD edition, where this ""special feature"" is simply a trailer of the actual movie, lol). So yeah, don't be fooled. But the box is wonderfully done: pleasant feeling texture, a fantastic 3D holographic cover showcasing the three movie wallpapers (yes! it isn't only on the Blu-ray edition!), on the back it has the Dark Knight bat-symbol in black with a dark grey backround; when you open the flaps, your eyes are greeted by the three movies with awesome disc cover work: each disc has the Bat symbol, but with the correlating theme for that movie. It's nice, because it looks like a Trilogy, like it should.
 The inside of the box has nice artwork. You know, behind the plastic part that holds the discs in those kinda sets? Real nice. It is the Bat symbol like on the cover of the box, blown up in proportion. In the inside flaps, it has a wide panel view of Batman on the ""Batpod"", as seen in The Dark Knight. One last detail that might be of interest to some of you guys out there: each disc now has the new ""DC Comics"" logo; this is pretty cool, because separately, only The Dark Knight Rises dvd has this new DC logo, which makes the other two not quite matching.
 And one last thing: in case ya'll are wondering, on this DVD edition (I don't know about the Blu-ray edition), when you play each movie on the computer or tv, everything plays exactly like the normal DVDs. Basically, it doesn't come with a ""special"" version of the Main Menu or anything. But trust me, as a DVD user, I was totally satisfied.",1379894400,11,2664,4.399594320486815

5342563,5,B009JBWOU0,"After the box-office bomb that was Joel Schumacher's Batman & Robin"", back in Fall 1997. DC Comics and Warner Brothers decided that with the next ""Live-Action"" adaptation of the caped crusader to take a different route. From a live-action adaptation of the then current Batman cartoon, Batman Beyond with the creators Allan Burnett, Paul Dini and Bruce Timm involved to a live action adaptation of Frank Miller's iconic ""canonical"" origin to the Dark Knight, 1987's ""Batman: Year One""  and was to be helmed by Darren Aronofsky (Pi, Requiem for a Dream, The Fountain).

Around Fall of 2003, it was announced that writer, David S. Goyer (Blade 1-3, The Crow: City of Angles, Nick Fury 1998 TV movie) and at the time up-and-coming, Christopher Nolan (Memento, Insomnia) reshape the Dark Knight and would retell his universe with 2005's Batman Begins.

Batman Begins (2005):

This was the movie that not only reintroduced Batman/Bruce Wayne and the character's universe to the going public, but also introduced and popularized the idea of making Comic-based films ""Realistic"".

The tone of Batman and of Gotham rang true to what comic creator, Bob Kane originally thought of back in 1939. This was a Gotham that we've never seen before in live-action; a city was corrupt to the bone, gritty and a shell of it's former self. Same thing goes with Bruce Wayne.

Unlike the previous interpretation of the duality of both, this take shows the true trauma that Bruce not only suffered as a child when originally seeing his parents gunned down, but also showing that traumatic experience still haunted him as an adult. An adult that was fueled with hatred and going a far to use the same weapon that struck his parents down, on the culprit.

With this reintroduction to the material, Christian Bale was casted as Batman/Bruce Wayne. A lot of bat-fans were going ""Wha?"", when it was originally announced before production even started, but like Keaton as the tittual role in the 1989 Tim Burton film, ""You can't judge a book by it's cover"". While I think he's a good Batman, his Bruce Wayne was phenomenal. Compared to the others that took the character as they're own, Bale actually acted like a playboy would in the real world.

Now I'm gonna get this out of the way, Yes. He and Nolan overdid the realism when it came to Batman's voice. When Bale opened his mouth as Batman. I wasn't trembling in fear, I was laughing. Granted, I get why they went with this decision and yes, they did improve it by toning it down with the last film, but still it was an annoyance to an already amazing performance.

Michael Cain as Alfred has got to be the perfect personification of the character to date. The way he interact with Bruce and the other characters in this trilogy felt he was really give it his all.

The same could be said with Gary Oldman as Jim Gordon. It felt like the look and characterization of Gordon was ripped right out of the Frank Miller classic origin, Batman: Year One.

Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox. He gets the job done, but feels like deja vu. Basically, it feels like Morgan Freeman as Morgan Freeman or in Batman's case, Morgan Freeman as Deus Ex Machnia.

Katie Holmes as the love interest Rachel Dawes was basically good in general. In some parts, it felt weak but as a whole, she does the job done with the role she was assigned.

Liam Neeson as Henry Ducard/Ra's al Guel was another stellar performance in this film. His interpretation was not only his own, but also felt like he did his homework on the character and was influenced by different interpretations of Ra's from the now iconic Batman: Animated Series from the 90's to the character's influence during the Danny O'Neil run of the Batman comic series.

Cillian Murphy as Scarecrow was also damn impressive. His take on the character was another well-done interoperation of the character from the original source. When he's ""The Good Doctor"", he does come of that one thinks is sane but in reality is down right nuts.

The Director of the trilogy Christopher Nolan was a perfect choice to reintroduce the character and the universe. Not only does he pull it off with the material at hand but throughout the Whole trilogy, he make you feel for the characters and what has transpired with the story. The only complaint I've had with Nolan is that he doesn't know how to direct a fight sequence. While he improved with both The Dark Knight and the recently released Dark Knight Rises, that was the only catalyst with Begins.

Main composer of the trilogy Hans Zimmer, did a phenomenal job with the soundtrack. With the character's themes and the overall ""themes"" of the movies separate plots, he really mixes it well.

Batman Begins - 5/5

The Dark Knight (2008):

With the start of The Dark Knight we get to see Gotham in a better state, one that has never been seen before. That is until we're introduced to the Joker (Heath Ledger) and his plan for the ""fair"" city of Gotham? He doesn't have one. He wants to see it return to it's original state ""a cesspool for criminals and killers"". Like  what Alfred said with the Joker's psyche ""Some people just want to see the world burn""

While I still say my two favorites Joker's are both Mark Hamill ( Batman: The Animated Series, Batman: Arkham Asylem/Arkham City) and Cesar Romero (60's Batman TV Series), the way Heath Ledger portrayed this iconic villain from Batman's Rouge gallery was down right amazing. He made it his own character but took some cues from the comics, animated series and other media that the character has appeared in. In other words, He was the breakout performance and it was a damn shame that he passed away so young.

The character of Rachel Dawes was re-cast in the sequel from Katie Holmes to Maggie Gyllenhaal. Honestly, I preferred Ms. Holmes as the character than how Maggie portrayed her. When some critics said back in 2005 with Begins that Holmes felt out of place in the movie, I felt that with Maggie. That she was both out of place but her acting was Highly wooden. When her character was killed off, I was shocked but shrugged it off a little later. This is when re-casting an already established character will hurt the film in the long haul.

Another stellar performance was by Aaron Eckhart as Harvey ""Two-Face"" Dent. His portrayal was not only refreshing to what the common conscience remembers the character of from 1995's Batman Forever (ironically, a Batman movie I like) but one that is true to the character in general.

The Dark Knight Rises (2012):

It's been 8 years after the events of the previous film and we see Bruce as we saw Howard Hughes later in his life, a recluse a shell of his former self. Jim Gordon, the commissioner of Gotham Police has resigned during this time-skip due to his guilt of knowing the truth about Two-Face and falsely painting Batman as a killer. After Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway) broke in the Wayne estate to copy Bruce's fingerprints, they fall into the hands of Bane! (Tom Hardy)

Like the Joker in 2008's The Dark Knight, my favorites interpretations of Selina/Catwoman have been both Adrienne Barbeau (Batman: The Animated Series) and Grey DeLisle (Batman: Arkham City). And then Anne Hathaway happened. Ms. Hathaway's take of Selina is the breakthrough performance of this film. She's sarcastic, charming, beautiful, smart, I can go on and on but the bottom line is this, We finally have a Catwoman that is true to her comic counterpart!

Another stellar performance was done by Tom Hardy as Bane. Unlike 1997's Batman and Robin, which was the character's big-screen debut. This interpretation of Bane is one that is right down to it's core, true to the comic original. unlike both Joker and Scarecrow, Bane was in the same plane on villainy as Begins' Ra's. He both has the Brass and Brawn to kill Batman if he wanted to. What I'm getting at is this, Bane is the first villain in this trilogy that shows Batman what he truly is, a vulnerable human being.

Joseph Gordon-Levit as Det. John Blake is, in some ways, how we were introduced to Bruce back in 2005. He's a calm, collective cop in the force that holds to the same ideals that both Bruce and Jim once believed in. And in some ways like both Bruce and Jim, he to is a hot-head. I won't spoil it but when it's revealed who he really is, it's cool but like his character deducing that Bruce is Batman, it was one that was seen a mile away.

The Dark Knight Rises - 5/5

With the Dark knight Trilogy, I'll say this. While the Dark Knight Rises was the more comic book focused one, it's predecessor was more realistic/bank heist/drama focused. Batman Begins was the one that had the perfect mixture of the comic book mythos and the stylistic reality that this trilogy created and popularized in the comic/superhero adaptation genre

5342565,5,B009JBWOU0,"I really like Christian Bale, so I guess I'm biased from the beginning with these movies.  I do enjoy the the darker ambiance of these movies, which I feel matches with the idea of Gotham and the world that Batman comes from.  Heath Ledger as the Joker in the second film is one of the all-time great villains in my opinion.  Tom Hardy does a great job as Bane in the third movie.  Bale does a good job exposing more of Bruce Wayne's internal conflict and feelings about being who he is, living in Gotham, losing people he cares about...all the things that make us human.  Overall I think these are some great Batman movies, especially compared to some of the older ones.",1379203200,,671,4.4227642276422765

5342567,5,B009JBWOU0,"The copy I purchased is missing the film disc for The Dark Knight Rises. There are only four discs, and an empty holder where the last movie would go. Possibly a bad production run. I will update this review when/if the issue is resolved.

Update: The return process was fairly painless, and I now have the complete set. Hopefully the omission was an isolated incident. I have updated the review to five stars because this is probably the best live-action Batman we will ever get. It strays from the most enduring and ""truest"" versions of the comics characters, but it is still recognizably Batman. It is never boring, and engages intellectually as well as emotionally. Read the commentary surrounding the release of TDK and watch the creators twist and contort as they try to deny the obvious political allegory (or applicability, if you prefer). These are movies of their time, capturing a zeitgeist that may seem foreign to future generations, but they will have timeless value as explorations of the sheep-wolf-sheepdog triad.",1379116800,,1030,4.988372093023256

I'm glad my brother talked me into it, for I liked it better than the two Tim Burton films put together! The Dark Knight was better than that! The Dark Knight Rises was better than the excellent Batman Begins! What made The Dark Knight so special was the late Heath Ledger's performance as the joker, he tops Jack Nicholson! He even won an Oscar for this film! My mum hates Batman, but she likes watching him!

Chris Nolan is a great director too! Richard Donner made me believe a man can fly! Chris Nolan made me believe an orphan can fight crime so no other kids become orphans! I liked how this explains why he dresses like a bat! Tim Burton's film only joked about it!

Scarecrow, Joker, Two Face, Bane & Catwoman all come into play in this epic trilogy! Fans of the comics (or even Arkham Asylum & Arkham City) may remeber Ra's Al Ghoul! In this, Bruce Wayne learns from his warriors! Even Tim Burton didn't explain where he got his fighting skills! Can't explain away everything without spoiling anyone who hasn't seen it!

Upon each subsequent viewing they grew on me so much that by the third or fourth time of watching each one I've really grown to like them.  Bale's Batman gets a little redundant, but its the other characters that really shine in this series.  Oldman's Gordon was so interesting throughout that I found myself wishing he'd get his own movie.  Ledger's Joker was okay, but after watching the original Batman I found myself preferring Nicholson, but I also realized that while Batman may be stale as a character sometimes, it really is those around him (sidekicks and villains) that have made the movies and comics so fun over the years.",1377043200,,704,4.653225806451613

5342601,3,B009JBWOU0,"Some Dark Knight fans may complain not enough new content is added here (roughly 90 minutes of exclusive content). However, it does seem to have all of the previously released content from the box set and individual releases. The films haven't been restored or extended from the old transfers. This collection isn't brimming with special features even with 6 discs. It does offer toys, cards, a book and some new featurettes but it seems bloated with packaging. The special features aren't evenly balanced either (The Dark Knight gets light treatment). There is over 6 hours of bonuses here but compare that to the 18 hours in the Batman Anthology BR release of the first four Batman films. It lacks a truly comprehensive, feature-length documentary about the franchise that should be 2-4 hours long. The single longest featurette here runs about an hour. Some mini-documentaries; few deleted scenes and no director's commentaries (Nolan did only one for Memento). There is much recycled content from Batman Begins (2-Disc Edition), Dark Knight (2-Disc Edition) & Dark Knight Rises (3-Disc Edition). Disc 1: Batman Begins Feature + Special Features. Disc 2: The Dark Knight Feature. Disc 3: The Dark Knight Special Features. Disc 4: The Dark Knight Rises Feature. Disc 5: The Dark Knight Rises Special Features. Disc 6: Bonus Disc of New Special Features Ultraviolet Digital Copy code for all 3 Movies.

NEW Special Features:
- The Fire Rises: The Creation and Impact of The Dark Knight Trilogy - The inside perspective on the fascinating story behind the creation of one of the most celebrated franchises and how it changed the scope of movie making...forever. Full of never-before-seen footage, rare moments, and exclusive interviews with Guillermo Del Toro, Damon Lindelof, Michael Mann, Zack Snyder, Richard Roeper.
- Christopher Nolan & Richard Donner: A Conversation - For the first time, Directors Christopher Nolan (The Dark Knight Trilogy) and Richard Donner (Superman) sit down to discuss the trials and triumphs involved in bringing the two most iconic superheroes of all time to the big screen, and how Superman influenced Nolan when developing Batman Begins.
- IMAX Sequences: The Dark Knight; The Dark Knight Rises - See your favorite scenes as they were intended in the original IMAX aspect ratio.

If you don't own the films on Blu-Ray it is a great purchase. Hardcore fans may be expecting more after previous releases held back. There is about 90 minutes of fresh content here (Fire Rises & A Conversation) and the old content won't blow your mind. An ultimate collector's edition should have at least 3-4 hours of new material and good-to-great remastering, deleted scenes and director's commentaries. The Dark Knight Rises looks great but Batman Begins and Dark Knight could use a polish. We get mostly short documentaries and featurettes so this is the ""light edition"" box set. It does make the Dark Knight Trilogy previously released on BR obsolete. Warner Bros. did an amazing job with Blade Runner so why not Dark Knight? Fans have seen supplements trickle out (my DVD copy of Batman Begins had 1 trailer on it). Hardcore fans will already own most of this collection (the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Christopher-Nolan-Director-s-Collection-Memento-Insomnia-Batman-Begins-The-Dark-Knight-Inception-Blu-ray/dp/B0085D3I3K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Christopher Nolan Director's Collection (Memento / Insomnia / Batman Begins / The Dark Knight / Inception) [Blu-ray</a>] is also quite good).",1376870400,,3559,5.492700729927007

Grabbed this when it was on sale. No regrets. Although I had already seen all 3 movies, I'd not seen them in Blu-ray nor did I own them myself. Sale + good trilogy = no brainer. Bought it.

I would like to add that someone mentioned the discs being difficult to remove from the case. That wasn't the case with mine. Could easily remove the discs. The only complaint I can make is the 2nd disc per movie, you need to remove disc 1 in order to get to disc 2. Minor complaint though.

5342623,4,B009JBWOU0,"Ok, this clearly isn't as ""Ultimate"" of an edition fans were hoping for. Could it have been better? Yes. But from what I'm seeing, we're still getting the blu ray's (which were already fine), all the previous bonus material, some merchandise, and a few HOURS worth of new bonus features. And although we still don't know how well made the packaging is, I think the artwork looks great.

If you've already bought these films on blu ray, I'd say wait for this to be on sale. There definitely isn't enough here to make it worth rebuying movies for eighty dollars. But, if you're someone who does NOT own these movies on blu ray (or doesn't have the previous bonus features) then this set looks worth it. Don't listen to the reviewers who say it's the same thing with a few toys. There is a decent amount of new bonus material here, just not as much as some fans were hoping for (or an upgrade of the blu ray quality). As it is, this set looks perfectly fine, just may not be worth to you what it's priced at (especially if you already own the trilogy on blu ray).",1376265600,,1060,4.353535353535354

the product if you can call it merely a product, arrived swiftly and was exactly what it advertised along with a christmas like anticipation for its arrival, come on, admit it, every time the doorbell rings and you see that its a package for you, its like coming down and finding those cookies you left out half eaten for the jolly man. joy brought with batman.

(I'm as big of a fan as the next guy) I understand people have their opinions and that's ok. But at the end of the day, It's only an opinion.(Don't push it as FACT) If you do not feel this set justifies spending money,Don't buy it. Doesn't mean someone else shouldn't. In my case, I will be purchasing this set and adding it to my already growing memorabilia of The Dark Knight Trilogy. And chances are, If they decide to re release yet again with better PQ for both batman begins and Dark Knight (which they should) I will be buying again. YOu have to understand one thing. This franchise became something bigger than expected. And Warner is VERY aware of that. So if that means putting minimal extras out now and holding off for maybe a 10 years anniversary release later down the road? They MOST CERTAINLY will. It's a business. They want $$$ And I get that.

5342633,1,B009JBWOU0,"Dear Fellow Dark Knight Fans and Amazon Customers,

 Based upon WB's product details, this box set would likely be worth a 5ive-star rating, that is, if you do not already own The Dark Knight movies. But if you do own them, then this item deserves only a one-star rating, especially without a current rebate offer for it. And yet, there is a way to resolve the problem of us having to engage in a rather costly double-dip if we are to ever see the coveted new exclusive The Fire Rises Bonus Extras 6th Blu-ray Disc from The Dark Knight Trilogy--Ultimate Collector's Edition.

  This would be the second time that this method of resolution has worked, following my review of U2 360*: Live at the Rose Bowl--Super Deluxe Limited Edition, which asked key people at Universal/Interscope Records to include a Blu-ray Disc. This Box Set had only been planned to contain 2-DVDs and other memorabilia, but no Blu-ray. Sure enough, after a month, and thanks to all of you who participated in a simple petition, the U2360 product content was upgraded to include Blu-ray.

  Warner Bros. has probably already been considering offering a rebate for The Ultimate Dark Knight. Just look at their $5 Upgrade from DVD 2 Blu-ray trade-in program and the fact the studio with the most Blu-ray hit movies that retail for $10 or under is Warner Bros. A few years ago, even Paramount was offering $10 rebate checks by mail for current owners of Braveheart and/or Gladiator DVDs, who had bought the Sapphire Series Blu-ray 2-Disc Sets of those titles.

  The following are the 6ix filmmakers whose names appear the most in the end credits of the various Dark Knight Trilogy Blu-ray & DVD Special Features, and who also happen to be members on Facebook, listed in order of credit prominence:

JORDAN GOLDBERG in Los Angeles, Trilogy producer
WILL HYDE in San Francisco, Batman Begins/Dark Knight associate producer
JOHN LIMPERT, in Los Angeles, Warner Bros. Entertainment Vice-President
MICHAEL FALLAVOLLITA in CA, The Dark Knight & Rises editor
RICK HULL in Los Angeles, Technology & Psychology of The Dark Knight Unmasked  producer at Prometheus Entertainment
ROKO BELIC, Happy director & Batmobile director/writer/cameraman

 I strongly implore you to please take just a few minutes copy and paste the following message and send it via Facebook too as many of these creative individuals as possible. You may also choose to print it out out and mail it to them:

 c/o Warner Bros. Home Video Entertainment Inc.
 4000 Warner Blvd.
 Burbank, CA  91522.

 Feel free to write your own message on this matter. With enough of you participating in this petition, we WILL achieve the results that we deserve! Thank You!

Dear FILL IN FILMMAKER's NAME HERE,

 You have done a magnificent job on The Dark Knight Trilogy Special Features from previous DVD and Blu-ray Editions. My name is TYPE IN YOUR NAME HERE. I am an avid cinema aficiando and collector of BDs and DVDs. Warner Bros. is my favourite studio. I regard The Dark Knight franchise to be the greatest comic book superhero movies ever made.

 I am writing to you concerning the forthcoming Dark Knight Trilogy--Blu-ray 6ix-Disc Ultimate Collector's Edition Box Set to respectfully request that some sort of rebate be offered to current owners of any or all of these three movies on DVD and/or Blu-ray. The refund would allow for your consumers to save money if they choose to purchase The DK Trilogy--Ultimate Collector's Edition.

 Most folks who would be interested in buying the Ultimate Collector's Edition already own previous editions of these three movies. The majority of Dark Knight fans have loved these films so much that they have already sought out to be able to watch them whenever they pleased and were likely not patient enough to endure the long wait for this Trilogy--Ultimate Collector's Edition, especially considering that Christopher Nolan and his filmmaking team initially had no plans for any further sequels when they first made and released Batman Begins in 2005 or The Dark Knight in 2008.

  Most enthusiasts would undoubtedly much appreciate having the new content and memorabilia of the Ultimate Trilogy: 3 Mattel Hot Wheels Bat-vehicle toys, a 48-page hardcover book, several premium art cards, and especially the 6th Bonus Special Features Blu-ray Disc. However, most of us fans simply cannot justify paying for this new box set, due to its current retail price of $80 being a bit too high combined with the matter that its exclusive new items, while enticing, are not necessarily compelling enough of a a need-to-own vibe amongst collectors at the cost of an unfortunate double-dip. If you do not believe me, please check out the advance customer reviews at Amazon and other websites.

 Without any rebate, it really seems that pretty much the only people who would succumb to dishing out their hard-earned money for this box set are financially well-off, Bat-fan uber-nerds who have the compulsive need to possess it. While such individuals may be fascinating, evaluate just how very small their demographic percentage of the population must actually be.

 It is quite clear that Warner Bros. Home Video would sell vastly more copies of the Ultimate Edition IF only a fair rebate was offered to current DVD and/or Blu-ray owners of the 3 Dark Knight movies. Such generosity would allow Warner Bros. to earn more profits and would also best serve the mania and middle-class or lower stature of the majority of fans. Such kindness would further instill our trust and faith in the greatest movie studio in the world.

 Here is our proposal for an ideal rebate offer:
 Customers are sent a refund check after they mail out proof-of-purchase ISBN-UPC barcodes and/or their actual video discs of any or all of the three movies. A rebate form sheet has designated sectors for taping or gluing ISBN-UPC barcodes. The sales receipt for new box set would also be required.

 In every rebate dollar-level, each movie would be of a different title. For example: within the $2-level, customers may receive a $4 rebate for Batman Begins and The Dark Knight with either being in single or Two-DVDisc Editions, but sending 2 Dark Knight ISBN barcodes, one from the movie-only edition and the other from the 2-Disc Special Edition, will disqualify one of these submittals and they shall only receive a rebate of $2. This general rule applies for all subsequent dollar-levels, including for returning discs.
 Rebates for Proof-of-Purchase barcodes are limited to no more than 7 items total.

 $2 each for up to any 3 different movie title UPCs in 1-DVDisc or Two-DVD Special Editions.
 $3 each for up to any 2 different titles of The Dark Knight  and Batman Begins on HDDVD, or on Blu-ray in regular, Special Edition, Steelbook or in +DVD Combo Pack.
 $4 each for up to any 2 different titles: any The Dark Knight Rises--Blu-ray Disc, The Trilogy--DVD Set and/or Begins in 2-DVD + Comic Book Deluxe Edition or Limited Edition 2-DVD Gift Set with Flash Drive.
 $5 each for up to any 3 different titles: Begins--Limited Edition Blu-ray Gift Set with Flash Drive, Trilogy--Blu-ray Set and/or any 1 Dark Knight--Limited Edition: Bat-Pod Display Case, Target Exclusive Bat-Mask Case or Best Buy Exclusive Clown Mask or Bat-Cowl Bobble Heads.

 The rebate form is affixed to a prepaid-postage return envelope that can hold up to 8 discs, which is the total limit for disc rebates.

$6 each for up to any 6 different DVDs including Bonus Extras 2nd Discs.
$7 each for up to any 5 different HDDVD and/or Blu-rays including Special Features 2nd Discs.

 Customers would have the option of returning either the disc they already own, OR the corresponding disc found within the new box set. Current online product images do not let us see with clarity whether or not the label side of the discs from the new set have been printed with artwork that is cooler and more attractive than on previously released discs. Assuming that the actual video content on previous and new discs is the same, consumers should be able to keep the discs which bear the artwork that they prefer.

 Furthermore, the Special Features Bonus 2nd Blu-ray Disc  from The Dark Knight Rises--Best Buy Exclusive Steelbook 2-BD + DVD Combo Pack contained The Dark Knight Reborn 37-minute documentary, which was no included on any other edition. If the Ultimate Trilogy does not contain Dark Knight Reborn, customers should be able to return the DKR Special Features disc from the new set.

 If it is simply too late in the manufacturing process to have this rebate form inserted within the box sets, then a small sticker may be posted outside the front of the box sets upon the factory-seal wrap, with basic directions for customers to go to a special website address, from which they may print out the rebate form and follow simple instructions on how to claim their refund by mail. They would, of course, also supply their own envelopes for returning discs.

 Yet an even better method of appeasing collectors would be  for Warner Bros. to sell the Ultimate Box Set directly from their official online shop site, with the options of ordering it in every possible combination of discs and other items not to be included, depending on the customer's needs and priced accordingly. We the fans will not mind if the factory-wrap is missing, if that makes it easier on the distribution end.

 Some customers may not require the hardcover book, as they may already own The Art and Making of the Dark Knight Trilogy giant book. Some may not want the Mattel Hot Wheels, as they may already own them. Most, however, will probably want to order the box set with all items intact except for those five movie and bonus discs that have already been released. Most will covet the new memorabilia, especially the exclusive Special Features BD.

 Assuming that the over-priced retail cost of $79.99 does not go down any lower by the time of the September 24th release date, here is a suggestion example of how the various items may be valued accordingly for these customized consumer orders:

 $9 per Blu-ray Disc
 $4 per 1 of the 3 Mattel Hot Wheels Bat-vehicles
 $6 for the hardback book
 $5 for the set of premium art cards
 $3 for the box and packaging therein only

 If the release date for the Ultimate Edition needs to be postponed in order to fulfill any of the aforementioned accommodations, so be it. We the fans would be happy to wait longer.

 At the very least, that exclusive 6th bonus BDisc should be available for individual sale. It is the main reason that anyone would want the Ultimate Trilogy and the main reason that we have written this letter. We must believe that we are gifted with so many special features about the creation of great films because the powers-that-be at movie studios and home video distribution truly do care about inspiring and educating the future generations of filmmakers, and that we deserve to be able to acquire the art of cinema at a reasonable price.

5342634,5,B009JBWOU0,Great price for what you get. I just can't believe that it included a coupon for the Ultimate Blu-ray box set!,1375574400,,110,4.285714285714286
5342635,5,B009JBWOU0,"I'm a huge batman fan. Always have been. I was very impressed with this trilogy. I own the first 2 on DVD and was looking for to buy the 3rd. This set went on sale on bluray for cheaper than I could have gotten the 3rd alone. No brainer. Not to mention I would have upgraded the first two to bluray eventually anyway. No complaints from me! The special features discs are just an added bonus, but I was really after the movies. It comes with a cool little book you'll look at once or twice so there's another bonus. I prefer boxed sets that come with individual cases, this one does not. But, like I said, I really just want to have the movies to watch, now I have them!",1375574400,,670,4.122137404580153
5342636,1,B009JBWOU0,Pretty sure this collection exists for 33$ already... minus the fancy packaging and extras. It does look pretty neat but considering that it doesn't have anything that the fans should already have... I don't think it's worth shelling out 70$ for packaging. Maybe if it was 40$ MAYBE!,1375488000,8,283,4.916666666666667
5342637,5,B009JBWOU0,The packaging was good. All the disc's were In perfect condition and all these came at an awesome prize. I will be looking for more!,1375488000,,132,4.32
5342638,5,B009JBWOU0,How do you make the man in your life the envy of all his friends? Buy this trilogy. It is well worth the prize and your significant other will be very appreciative.,1375401600,,164,4.15625
5342639,3,B009JBWOU0,"Looks like we will have to wait another year for some better special features OR extended versions which I actually doubt will happen anyway because Nolan never has released an extended version.  In fact, most don't even have deleted scenes.",1375315200,,241,5.025

5342641,1,B009JBWOU0,"I don't normally write reviews, as I am just not about spending time on them. But this warrants my frustration. As a fan and after waiting for almost a year for this release, I am HUGELY LET-DOWN! Why would anyone who already owns the first trilogy release or is interested in this edition fork out an extra $50 for 3 cheap plastic toys, a couple of paper cards, and  two documentaries. It doesn't make sense. Had they been extended editions, I would have paid  whatever price they wanted, be it over $200. What was WB thinking when they released this?Clearly not about the fans. Look at what a fantastic job the L.O.T.R. extended editions did. I happily and gladly paid the $100 tag on it as it was well worth it. This, I just don't know what to say. It's kinda an insult and cash grab more than anything else. Anyone looking to order this, you are better off with the original trilogy release,unless you want to pay extra for collectible plastic and paper ornaments. The fact that the pre-order price has dropped by $30 should say something even though it is yet to be released. If you really want to purchase this, then wait till the plummeting sales force the retailers to lower the price even more.",1375315200,28,1203,4.513761467889908

5342646,3,B009JBWOU0,"First things first, I LOVE these films, all three, and especially The Dark Knight. The thing is this boxset doesn't give much incentive to buy if you already own the Blu Rays, which I do. The only way I would have got this version if it came with extended cuts of the three films, which it doesn't for any of the three. There are no addition special features, just some cool items the box comes with, but nowhere near enough to get me to re buy the films.

Again Love these films, and I would recommend them to any super hero fan or a fan of good cinema, because they're all great, but this ""ultimate collectors edition"" won't get this die hard fan to bite.",1374969600,3,657,4.256

5342650,1,B009JBWOU0,"If you are like most Christopher Nolan Batman fans then you've probably bought all 3 movies on Blu-ray already, which means you already own 90% of what comes in this collection. So what stuff does your hard earned money get you that you don't yet own? a couple of cheap Hot Wheel cars, a set of photo cards, and 2 new short documentaries That you might enjoy watching once but will leave you wanting more, oh but wait, there isn't any more, no deleted/extended scenes, no additional cast interviews/behind the scenes, no outtakes, nothing that this set for the price should have.

5342659,5,B009JBWOU0,My husband was thrilled with this! This series is definitely going down as a classic. The setup of this set is aesthetic and of course the movies are awesome.,1374537600,,158,4.482758620689655
5342660,5,B009JBWOU0,"This was a steal when I picked it up, but I'd still recommend this set for any Batman fan out there.  The films are well done and still easy to follow for someone who may not be as familiar with the comics.  The quality is amazing.",1374537600,,231,4.0

5342662,4,B009JBWOU0,"Although many people criticize Christian Bale, I think he is a better Batman than all of the '90's versions hands down. These movies actually show how Batman started. They are a bit on the ""dark"" side, but so is the Batman character. Not for young teens and below!",1374364800,,264,4.520833333333333
5342663,5,B009JBWOU0,This was too good of a deal to pass up. All three Dark Knight films on Blu-ray plus two discs of special features along with ultra violet copies of each film. All of this for $30 is the perfect package. If you're looking for limited edition action figures or other specials you won't get that with this set. But if you're looking for the these movies in HD you won't find a better deal.,1374278400,,386,4.22972972972973

5342665,1,B009JBWOU0,"So I was excited to all 3 movies on bluray for $25.  Unfortunately the blurays films are burned funny.  They don't work on Sony PS3s.  The extra features etc for both films #2 and #3 work fine.  The actual films #1, #2, #3 do not work.  If you open the package and examine all 5 discs you will see that the films are burned differently or have some odd coating compared to the special feature discs.  This is the only explanation I have for the films not working.  I even had amazon send me another copy, and it was the same problem.  If you have a PS3 make sure you check each film disc to see if it works in your machine.  I'm returning my 2nd copy of the film too because again, it doesn't work.",1374105600,3,698,4.073529411764706
5342666,1,B009JBWOU0,"Well, the much hyped Ultimate Collector's Edition would still be worthwhile had they at least given us new masters for the first two films. But no. Instead, they chose to add in some fancy cards and worthless toys to the existing releases, giving the whole packaging a new name pricing it high. If you don't own the films already, get the previous release- The Dark Knight Trilogy at a fraction of this new set's price and stay well away from this lame release.",1374105600,23,461,4.566265060240964

5342668,5,B009JBWOU0,If you're a fan of the Christopher Nolan trilogy then this is a must have for you.  I love that I'm able to sit down and have a Batman marathon or pick the movie I'm in the mood for and watch it along with the special features.,1374105600,,227,3.8297872340425534
5342669,1,B009JBWOU0,"It kills me to say this (because I am a diehard Batman fan and loved the Dark Knight Trilogy) but this is not worth owning. I was hoping to have something comparable to The Ultimate Matrix Collection with a crap load of special features, documentaries, and commentaries for the Dark Knight Trilogy. But this ""new"" collection just does not deliver. I already own the movies and refuse to buy this ""Ultimate Collection"" (if it can be called that) for $100 when there is nothing really new included. I want to own the idea of this so bad, but this repackaged collection just isn't worth the money.",1374019200,28,594,4.613207547169812
5342670,5,B009JBWOU0,"First off - the product itself and packaging. This is a very nice set, the quality of it is top-notch and the art book is a nice bonus. The outer box that holds everything even has a nice feel to it. They need to make more sets like this, a lot of people could learn from this set. The 5 discs are nicely contained and kept safe in their own fold out style book, and easy to remove when needed. Not much more to say about it really, just very nice set especially for the price.

Not going to get too much into the movie because chances are if you are here looking to buy this you have seen them or know something about the movies already. I will keep it short...the movies are well done, the Blu-ray quality is up there and if you are even a remote fan of comic style movies this is a must see/own collection.",1374019200,3,809,4.05625
5342671,1,B009JBWOU0,"Compared to The Ultimate Matrix Collection (added 35 hours of new bonus features) and Superman Ultimate Collector's Edition (new comprehensive documentaries about the creation of the first four films AND of Superman's mythological history; 20+ hours of new content),
This set is unbelievably NOT worth it.

So you want the little toys? Yes, Little toys, Because that's what every serious collector of film sets needs on their shelves, right? Something more befitting a happy meal than a collector of one of the best film trilogies ever made?

It does nothing to address the technical shortcomings of the first two films' home releases, and it has a rather shameful lack of new bonus material (many fans were really hoping for some sort of commentary track on one or all of the films by director Christopher Nolan).
I'd really encourage you to avoid this set, especially if you have all three films already. In the best case scenario, a double dip release will have significantly more material than the original, easily justifying spending more money on the same films. With The Dark Knight Trilogy set that's being proposed here, this is definitely not the case.

If you're reading this, odds are you already own at least one of the movies included here. Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy stands as one of the best, and most successful comic book screen adaptations of all time. Warner has released, and re-released these movies several times over the years. Unfortunately, previous Blu-ray releases have not been perfect. The picture quality left videophiles wanting a remastering of the films (well at least Batman Begins and TDK), but sadly after such a long wait, Warner will be releasing the same exact transfers found in previous Blu-ray releases.

There are just a few new items included. You'll be getting 90 minutes worth of new extra features on a bonus disc, including an interview between Nolan, and Superman director Richard Donner, as well as a documentary about the trilogy. Physical extras include 3 Hot Wheels of Batman's vehicles, some Mondo art cards,  and a hardcover book.

The discs aren't stored in regular Blu-ray cases, but rather in a ""Book"" with slots for each movie. This is similar to the Book-style packaging seen in the Alien Antrhology, and Star Wars Complete Saga sets. Some people may not like this as it doesn't protect the disc as well, but Blu-rays are more scratch-resistant so if you take care when removing and putting them back in, they should be okay.

 Christopher Nolan & Richard Donner: A Conversation - For the first time, Directors Christopher Nolan (The Dark Knight Trilogy) and Richard Donner (Superman) sit down to discuss the trials and triumphs involved in bringing the two most iconic superheroes of all time to the big screen, and how Superman influenced Nolan when developing Batman Begins.

So is this worth the $100 suggested price? If you already own the movies, I'd have to say no.

5342682,5,B009JBWOU0,Batman Begins is very good.  The Dark Knight is exceptional.  The Dark Knight Rises I thought was mediocre.  I still think it is a great trilogy and one of the few I own on Blu-Ray.  Every time they are on TV I watch them so I figured I might as well have them on Blu-Ray so I don't have to sit through commercials.  Price was right to purchase these.  Picture quality is great and the box is just the right size to store.,1373414400,,422,4.024096385542169

5342685,5,B009JBWOU0,The trilogy is awesome. The package is pretty cool. The book is a nice piece.

I'm glad that I waited for the set before I started buying the movies.  It wasn't a conscious decision, I just never got around to making the purchases.  This set offers all of the movies and plenty of extras to make it a good purchase for fans of this particular movie franchise.",1372982400,,537,4.541666666666667

I was won over instantly! Great story, realism and no camp or cheese! All three of the movies have made my favorite of all time list. I can care less about the comics or other movies, Christopher Nolan in my opinion gave me a Batman I can love. The Movies on Blue Ray are pure delight. This set is an excellent choice for those who love good movies presented in an absolute grand quality presentation. My wife hates it when I watch these movies now because the sound reverberates through the house. The sound is fantastic! The picture is absolutely stunning! I do wish there were more extra's but I do not feel like I was ripped off either.
I say if you want a good film based on a comic one needs to turn to Christopher Nolan. The man seems to be a genius in making these films. I cannot wait to see more of his work!",1371686400,,984,4.23936170212766

Returned it, got a new one, and SHOULD have watched it right away to make sure the issue had been solved. As I never had an issue with a disc before, I thought it'd be fine. Finally go to watch it tonight, and first it won't play. Player says the disc did not meet specifications. Restarted the player, and now it's freezing, and skipping minutes ahead. I'm doubting it will make it to the end of the movie. Now I am past my return window.
Bad move, Amazon. Guess I'll try to complain elsewhere....",1367712000,2,698,4.295454545454546

It's a shame but both movies could of been better than they were. Don't get me wrong the movie was great but its the little things that could of made it movie of the year. Batman begins I enjoyed Christian bales batman voice better than the second and third one so I don't know why they changed it. Now for the good review. To get all three movies for $30 is a bargain.

The special features were worth the set in my opinion. Concept art, complete commentary, etc. Very happy with this purchase. I do think it could have been packaged with something like one of the comic tie-ins, a small collectible or something of the sort as the previously mentioned sets were. For that 4 stars.

Ultimately, each movie is a 5-star flick and well worth the time to watch and experience. Nolan is a master with Batman and I will truly miss his influence on my all-time favorite hero.",1365292800,,658,4.771929824561403
5342823,5,B009JBWOU0,"I have watched Batman movies and tv shows since I was a kid and I really enjoy the whole story of Batman. My personal favorite was the original movie from 1989. Once I saw the Dark Knight, I can allow room for another favorite. This Blu-Ray trilogy is the best way to watch all of the Christian Bale Batman movies. He is a great actor and did a very good job at portraying not only Batman but Bruce Wayne. This trilogy starts off a bit forgettable with Batman Begins. Its good, don't get me wrong but the trilogy shines with the next two movies. The Dark Knight sets the standard for not just acting, with Heath Ledger's Joker, but also in terms of the scale of some of the action scenes. Many were done with as little CGI as possible. You get goose bumps watching some of the scenes. The last movie in the trilogy is the same just even better. Bane is a brutal person. Not quite as memorizing as the Joker but easily one of the best villains.

If you like or love Batman there really is no reason not to own this trilogy. There are plenty of extra features and content to watch and review but its all about the movies. You won't be disappointed if you get this Blu-Ray.",1365206400,,1170,4.246636771300448

5342832,5,B009JBWOU0,"We are in a golden age of comic book movies right now. No movies show that as perfectly as Christopher Nolan's ""Dark Knight Trilogy"" -- three movies that explore the formative years of the legendary superhero Batman, from the beginning of his crusade for justice to the explosive climax. Even people who aren't into capes and tights can appreciate this story.

""Batman Begins"": After his parents' murderer is paroled, young bazillionaire Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) vanishes on an aimless journey across the world. He's taken under the wing of the mysterious Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson), who offers to train him to be a member of the League of Shadows. But then Bruce learns that the League plans to annihilate Gotham, his home city.

Gotham has become rotten to the core with mobs, crooked cops and a fear-inducing shrink. Using the company's discarded prototypes, Bruce fashions an armored bodysuit and tanklike vehicle, and uses them to fight crime wherever he finds it. But the League still has plans to destroy Gotham, and the only one who can stop them is Batman.

""The Dark Knight"" is feeling pretty good about his battle against crime, especially since the new DA Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) is a morally-upright good-guy. But Batman isn't prepared for the Joker (Heath Ledger) a mad clownish psychopath who has hired himself out to the mob to destroy their worst enemy, the Dark Knight. Even worse, he has the ultimate way of blackmailing Batman into doing what he wants: holding all of Gotham hostage.

""The Dark Knight rises picks up eight years later -- crime is almost gone, Batman has vanished, and Bruce Wayne is a recluse. But then a terrifying masked man named Bane arrives in Gotham, attacking Batman as revenge for the League's destruction. He will turn Gotham into a living nightmare, unless the Dark Knight can rise again...

Most directors would have given these movie a distinctly comic-book, slick pop-culture feel. But no matter how hard you search, there's not a single hint in ""The Dark Knight Trilogy"" that anything kitschy or campy came before it, or that it was originally a comic book. Instead Christopher Nolan creates a movie as dark, tightly-wound and intense as Batman himself.

But since this is a comic-book movie, Nolan peppers them with kinetic action, high-speed chases and massive explosions. The dialogue is drizzled with dry humor (""That isn't exactly what I had in mind when I said I wanted to inspire people"","" Batman says, looking at a bunch of impersonators), mostly to temper the overhanging sense of horror and apprehension.

The most striking part of these movies is Nolan's delving into morality, and the darker side of human nature. He heaps more tragedy and trauma on Batman than just his parents' death, and delicately traces the moral boundaries -- or lack of them -- between Batman and his foes.

Christian Bale is simply brilliant as Bruce Wayne/Batman -- sure, his growly voice can get a bit silly at times, but he perfectly conveys the strength, pain and determination of a man who will sacrifice everything to save others. Michael Caine is awesome as his faithful butler/father figure, and there are solid backing performances by Morgan Freeman and Gary Oldman.

And the performances of the villain actors are absolutely brilliant. Everybody knows of the late Heath Ledger's spellbindingly chilling performance as the Joker, a casually corrosive creature who believes himself to be the yin to Batman's yang. But Tom Hardy and Liam Neeson are also brilliant as cunning, clever people who are determined to destroy Gotham.

The biggest problem is that Nolan isn't very good at casting women. Maggie Gyllenhaal and the pouty Katie Holmes are both hideously miscast as the cruel, manipulative Rachel Dawes, who treats Bruce's heart like a toy. Anne Hathaway is the best of the bunch -- a pretty baffling choice as Catwoman, but she does a decent job.

""The Dark Knight Trilogy"" contains some of the best superhero movies ever made -- a dark, gritty, richly-imagined tale of one man's quest against chaos and evil.",1364947200,,4069,4.9779086892488955

5342865,5,B009JBWOU0,"The box is beautiful, material and design captures the movie sense, and although is a standard set, is just that you need for enjoy the entire trilogy again and learn about the production. Really comes with 5.1 spanish audio track, that means you don't need to buy another versions made and sold from latin markets that commonly comes with less extras. The book included is simple but is a good value add for the package and its excellent price. Is my first Blu-ray box set, and I am impressed.",1363564800,,494,4.561797752808989

5342867,5,B009JBWOU0,"This is a great group of movies at a pretty good value.  I got it somewhere other than Amazon for a bit cheaper, but the overall picture quality is superb and the extras are pretty good as well.  I would have liked to have seen more about Heath Ledger's portrayel of the Joker in the extras for the Dark Knight, but it may have been purposely omitted because of the tragedy surrounding his death.  Tom Hardy's portayel of Bane was on there and that was very interesting, however, so I cannot complain too much.  THe picture and sound quality is immense and as grandiose as one might expect from such an epic trilogy.  I would highly recommend this gift set to anyone who enjoyed the movies.  In fact, this will be the first time I will have seen the first in the series in its entirety.  I own the DVD of the Dark Knight, but this Blu-Ray is so much better.  The quality and pricing perfect for anyone who wants a piece of hollywood lore.  Christopher Nolan has quickly become my favorite storyteller.  His directing is nearly flawless in my opinion.  This delves into some unique perspectives trough his eyes, as well as osme of the actors portraying the various characters.  I loved seeing how each of the sets were designed and learning about the epic fight scene between Bane and Batman.  To me, the process is just as enjoyable as the overall final product and movie experience.",1363478400,,1383,4.528225806451613

5342887,5,B009JBWOU0,"This trilogy pack is beautifully packaged and while worth the money spent. Complete in the package is a booklet, 3 discs that contain beautifully acted and awe-inspiring film chronicle. I personally have never been one to be all that into Batman movies or anything like that, but after hearing all the buzz about Heath Ledger's role as the Joker, I finally caved and bought the trilogy pack...and wow, am I glad I did! The first film, Batman Begins, explains the backstory as to why Batman became who he was bound to become, why he rids Gotham city of evil, and, on top of all of that, has beautiful cinematography and directing chops. You then dig into the second installment of the film, The Dark Knight, which is probably (my personal) the best film in this trilogy. Heath Ledger's acting chops won me over. The hype over the film was well-deserved; his acting was amazing and top-notch. I have yet to watch The Dark Knight rises, but if the first 2 films are any indication of whats in store, I can hardly wait to feast my eyes up on the third film. :)

All in all, this 3-disc set is well-worth your money for any avid movie lover/Batman fan.",1362960000,,1147,4.514423076923077

5342895,3,B009JBWOU0,Movies are nice. Comes with an abbreviated version of the coffee table book they want you to buy. For the price of all three in one package you really can't do any better. The discs are kind of jam packed on top of each other instead of having their own section in the foldable package. It would have been nice for each movie to have their own case.,1362614400,,349,4.147058823529412

5342903,5,B009JBWOU0,"First and foremost, this is not for children who are under the age of 13. This trilogy is dark violet and explores what man will do man as well as the response when one is pushed to their limits.
The movie explores the line between good and evil and sometimes it is not that easy to discern.
Christian Bale comes across as the Dark Knight. One one has to watch all three movies to see how his character grows into this ""dark and ominous character ""The Dark Knight who is also battling his own demons.
It is a shame about Heath Ledger. I'm sure if he was alive, he would have played in the last  installment and that would have bought  a different perspective to the film.
Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman gave the movie its good characters; the ones that see clarity. But again, pushed to their limits.
Plenty of action, plenty of plots, good variation of the scenes and no predictabiliy. Must watch all three to understand the last one.",1362528000,2,935,4.430232558139535

If you still want the ""ultimate collection"" there is a code inside that gives you discounts for the other accessories that will come with it. Regardless, you won't miss anything. And about the movies, can't believe time flies so fast and that all three movies were all masterpieces especially Heath Ledger's performance. I remember critics are questioning about him portraying the joker and boy he blew our minds away. Giving us an ever lasting image what the joker really was and implementing it to his own craft was brilliant. Till this day, people still loves the joker through various fan art and parodies from television shows. Christopher Nolan vision of the Dark Knight brought us an image that we will never forget.",1362441600,,867,4.945205479452055

5342925,5,B009JBWOU0,"Firstly, I am a Batman fan.  He is my second favorite superhero character (behind Dick Grayson actually), so when I write this review, I may be a little bias in my support of these three films.  My review is more topical and complete so I won't go into a lot details, thus if for some reason you have not seen any of these films, this review will not spoil anything for you.
  The Dark Knight trilogy is fantastic, my second favorite trilogy (behind The Lord of the Rings).  I love how each film stands on its own and it is only the third which makes references to the previous films, but give you enough in case you missed either one.  In Batman Begins, we have, in my opinion, the greatest Batman film origin story you could possibly tell.  There are other Batman origin stories out there which are wonderful (like Batman: Year One) but Batman Begins has the more cinematic qualities to a big budget super hero film along with a very grounded, very personal starting place for both Bruce Wayne and Batman.  If Warner Bros. decided to re-boot Batman (as I feel they should in order to have a character which fits into a world with other superheroes and one who is more detective focused) I would strongly urge to just not create an origin story.  Just kick off with Batman as Batman, maybe from flashbacks to his parents murder, but do not try to compete with Batman Begins because, as origin stories for this hero go, you will not find a more perfect one.
  The Dark Knight is the best superhero film made to date.  It has every element of not only a great superhero film, but a great film in general.  You have a conflicted hero trying to separate himself from his alter ego, but you ultimately cannot.  There is a sort of hubris story where the very act of good is turned evil.  And a perfect villain, written and acted exceptionally to tear everything down.  The scope is epic and yet the characters make it feel like a small movie at times.  The Joker is the villain he is always supposed to be.  He is chaotic, psychotic, mischievous, murderous and always one step ahead of the great detective.  The character is played beautifully by Heath Ledger who give the character real life and depth while, at the end of the film, we really know very little about him which only adds to the terror that the Joker is meant to inspire.
  The trilogy wraps up with The Dark Knight Rises, which, once I realized this is not intended to be a traditional superhero film, I was able to appreciate the movie for what it was.  It is the end of a legend, but not the one you think.  This ends the legend of Bruce Wayne and established the true legend of Batman.  The acting in this third film is all-around the best of the series with greater performances by all the veterans and the new comers.  It is a broad scoped plot all fit wonderfully together and held their by Bane.  Traditionally not a primary villain, Bane become more in this film and the link to the League of Shadows (primary villains in Batman Begins) was a wonderful way to bring Bane on equal ground with Batman.  The story has everything you want as a fan and moves along at a very quick pace to the war-like finale in Gotham City.  It was a very fitting end to the Christopher Nolan Batman era.
  While I would have liked to see certain elements in the trilogy, namely the inclusion of Dick Grayson (not Robin) in the final chapter (Dick provides a father-son relationship with Bruce which links him back to his father) I was very happy with the end results.  Some characters die that you don't expect to and the overall history of Batman is altered which, in the end, I was okay with.  If you are familiar with the comics or other films, what is important to realize is that this Batman is in another universe that the other stories.  It is a more realistic universe where villains like Clayface or Killer Croc would not be able to exist, along with superheroes like Superman or Wonder Woman.  In this universe, this trilogy tells the complete legend of Bruce Wayne and the first chapters in the legend of the Batman.
  Overall, I give the trilogy a 5 out of 5 putting up on par with the trilogy The Lord of the Rings, and very much like the Greek legends told in poems like The Odyssey and The Iliad.",1361923200,,4260,4.409731113956466
5342926,5,B009JBWOU0,This set is amazing.  They give you hours of new content.  I watched ever second of these DVD and was so happy with this purchase,1361923200,,129,4.12
5342927,5,B009JBWOU0,"It was Good. I mean really good. It was really, totally good. Entirely adequate, and then some. If you like Blu Rays, and these three Batman movies, then you should buy these three Batman movies on Blu Ray. Just think about how many times you could watch them: One? Two? Maybe even three thousand times each. Also, every set comes with your own personal fife! Now I know what you're thinking - why would this come with a fife? How about - why doesn't every Blu Ray come with a fife! Intrigued? Of course you are! Additional features include: director commentary, you can pause it!, fear, loathing, a kangaroo with boxing gloves, a dingo with boxing gloves, and a human boxer (glove-less). Okay, only the first two features are included, and there is also no fife, but come on. This is the Dark Knight trilogy! It's incredible! The price is awesome ( I paid $27.99. I've seen The Dark Knight Rises going for that much on its own). The picture quality is a little questionable on the first two (for Blu Ray), but the third looks awesome. Buy it, or don't. I don't care.",1361923200,,1067,4.505154639175258
5342928,5,B009JBWOU0,The Dark Knight Trilogy on Bluray will forever be on my top shelf waiting to be watched over and over again. Great deal too.,1361923200,,124,4.208333333333333
5342929,5,B009JBWOU0,This is a must own for any Batman Fan. I could watch The Dark Knight Trilogy for days. I do feel like the special features are a little lacking but the history of the Batmobile was a must watch for me. The case it comes in is also great as well.,1361836800,,245,3.823529411764706
5342930,4,B009JBWOU0,"I bought this because it was exactly what it says, the newest batman movies w/ some bonus discs. What I didn't expect, and maybe I simply missed it in the fine print, was the additional digital copy of each movie via VUDU.

The additional content is great, as every other review states, the picture quality is what you'd expect from a blu ray. i'm not going to pretend I can see some clarity flaws b/c of this or that. Even if I could, it's a cheap collection of great movies - get over it.

My only complaint is The Dark Knight. I don't know why, but the screen will change from a full widescreen (no black bars) to having bars while it playing, during change of scenes and such. It doesn't do it all the time, but often enough that I noticed. Begins and Rises did not do this, all of which were watched on the same tv, ps3, etc.

One last minor gripe. Begins sound is...different from the other two. Not to say it's bad in any way, but it took some tweaking of settings on my amplifier to get to be as nice as the other two movies.",1361836800,,1033,4.155

5342964,5,B009JBWOU0,I must say I love pretty much all the batmans but this triology by far takes the cake. I love in the Dark Knight how Heath Ledger plays the Joker.

Well went to put in Batman Begins and it would not play. it would roll through the MPAA rating then it would cut to black and freeze up my blu-ray player. I ordered a replacement and I just got it in today and Batman Begins would also not work again!!! I'm done with trying with this box set. It seems like less difficulty to just buy all three individually. Don't get this box set unless you like all the hassle of returning over and over again.....",1361318400,,571,4.2

5342973,5,B009JBWOU0,"Great box set.

The little 30-page art book is really neat, featuring a lot of images from shooting as well as some concept images. There's some text explaining how Chris Nolan kept the Batpod at his house, which is quite neat.

Each film looks great in blu-ray format. The sound isn't even that messed up like other movies where the action scenes are disturbingly loud compared to the dialogue scenes, which are sometimes inaudible.

The films themselves are masterpieces. The dark and gritty Gotham City that Nolan creates is immersive. Heath Ledger's portrayal of The Joker is fantastically creepy and sinister. Tom Hardy's Bane is scary and convincing. Overall the final film seems to fall short, being a bit too convoluted and slow in parts. The ""reveal"" was also kind of underwhelming.

Overall the first two films outweigh the final installation, but the entire journey is worth it. Nothing quite measures up to the Blu-Ray quality of the films when viewing on a nice TV with a great sound system.",1361232000,,1004,4.8882352941176475

Maneuver the conversation into the sad conclusion to Heath Ledger;s life and don't want to be forced into watching A Knight's Tale?  the Dark Knight.

You want some motivation for the gym because you blew it with that aforementioned chick and want to try again?  Dark Knight Rises.

While I am not a superhero aficionado by any stretch of the imagination, I can appreciate this series more than others because of the directors attention to detail in regards to making these movies very dramatic and intense while still staying true to the actual comic-book storyline (from what I hear anyways....I haven't read the comics).

I felt at the end of this movie [The Dark Knight Rises] like I did when I first heard Beethoven's Opus 131. I was so overwhelmed at the mastery of the medium that I had just witnessed that I had a hard lump in my throat, tears on the edges of my eyes and several suddenly-caught breaths. When in the realm afforded us by such greatness, we are like angels discovering we have wings. ""Hey, I never knew I could fly like that! Thank you sir!""",1359936000,,668,4.25984251968504

But since I'm not a comic book person, I had no idea the it was the beginning of the Dark Knight movies, which makes this trilogy nothing short of epic for me. I bought this trilogy box set & out of all of the box sets of certain movies I own, this & the Blade trilogy are my prize possessions!! Besides all this...who could ever argue that Heath Ledger's Joker is & will forever be THE best portrayed ever??

-There's no reason to actually go into reviewing the movies themselves, because that's what iMDB is for (but I will say they are FREAKING AMAZING!), but they all work perfectly, and look/sound beautifully.
-The packaging looks/is awesome.
-It comes with a little book, which is a selection of imagery from ""The Art And Making Of The Dark Knight Trilogy,"" which has a little over 60 pages of random pictures, concept art, and behind the scenes pictures of the 3 films (very cool to look through).
-Comes with Ultraviolet copies (which I've actually never bothered with before, but figured I could make these movies my first). If you haven't used this before, then it'll explain how to get everything. But it doesn't explain that you're actually going to be using a program called ""Flixster"" which is where all the magic happens. I'm pretty sure you stream your movies with Flixster, but since I don't rely on streaming, I downloaded the movies to my computer so I could watch them whenever (not to mention they look pretty damn good in Standard Definition!). If you want to take your movies with you on the go, then you'll need to get the ""Movies by Flixster"" App on your mobile device (iOS, or Android. I don't have any other type, so I don't know about them). Then you can sign in, and download the movies onto that. Sadly it isn't going to look perfect, but that's because the downloads aren't in Blu-ray ;)
-Comes with a bonus discs for each movie (though I haven't watched any, I'm sure they're cool to watch as well).

If you love, or even just like the movies, and you have a Blu-ray player, I'd say this collection is a must buy!",1359417600,,1711,4.555194805194805

5343105,5,B009JBWOU0,"After having purchased the first two movies of the trilogy, I figured buying the box set was the better deal rather than just buying The Dark Knight Rises by itself.

5343111,5,B009JBWOU0,"Not just a great product itself, but also an unbeatable opportunity to update your ""DK Trilogy"" to Blu-Ray format at a reasonable price. Not only you get the 3 movies, but also all the extras in 2 additional discs (5 discs total). To me that is all you need. Of course, the art-book in pocket book format doesn't hurt either.

So maybe the ultraviolet format doesn't work. At least that's what all other reviews claim. I don't know, I haven't even tried it yet. But honestly, I don't care. I paid for the movies and I got them in discs, so that's enough for me.",1359331200,,561,4.3428571428571425

You type the code that is listed on the little UltraViolet paper that comes with the DVD Set.

5343130,4,B009JBWOU0,"Christopher Nolan had to expertly make a trio of Batman films like no other: truly dark featuring expansive sets, state-of-the-art FX, and, most of all, impressive performances from its stars.

The first of the three, ""Batman Begins,"" sports the best performance by star Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne/Batman.  In the movie, Bale delivers his distinctive turn in the role previously assayed by the likes of Michael Keaton, Val Kilmer, George Clooney, and, of course, Adam West on TV. Bale is very good, demonstrating why he was chosen for the role and why he is constantly in demand in Hollywood.

Bale takes a backseat to the late Heath Ledger in ""Batman Returns."" In this one, Ledger takes the role of The Joker to a more psychotic level than has ever been presented before.  Ledger's take is more frightening and demented than previously has been presented.  He deserved the posthumous Oscar awarded him.

Finally, ""The Dark Knight Rises"" suffers from what befalls many films: it's just too big...too many villains, overuse of special effects and violence at the expense of character, and a hazy plot that appears just thrown together.

Although Tom Hardy's ""Bane"" is a worthy menace to Batman and Bane does admirably in the role, the film starts rather lacklusterly and ends on a rather predictable note. The first thirty minutes alone move too slowly.

Additional acting kudos should be given to the other regulars common to all films: Gary Oldman as Commissioner Gordon, Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, and Michael Caine as faithful butler Alfred Pennyworth.

Overall rating: 5 stars for films 1 and 2; 3 stars for the conclusion in the trilogy",1359244800,,1647,4.981751824817518
5343131,5,B009JBWOU0,"And a simple but great end at that. Yes, there are times of pandering to the lowest common in the final installment of the trilogy (there is a scene where Morgan Freeman is literally bringing the audience up to speed with what's going on in the movie), but it finished strongly enough for me to be more than content. The box set is worth the price just for the bonus feature on the history of the Batmobile - very awesome and my inner Batman nerd is satisfied.",1359158400,,460,4.2988505747126435

The box sets comes with the three great movies we've come to know and love and on the High Definition Blu-Ray discs, five discs in total, three for the movies and one for each the Dark Knight and Dark Knight Rises for bonus features. I was excited to watch the movies all of them thats for sure. The only dissappointment I had was I was expecting there to be more bonus features availble on the blu-ray discs themselves.

Excellent actors, Morgan Freeman...grasp the roles they were cast and are fun to watch.  We watched the set over 3 nights, after our little one was in bed...not kiddo friendly...and my husband who always falls asleep watching movies had his full attention grabbed.  The Dark Knight...wow. Heath Ledger stole and owns this film.  Such a loss, it was intresting to see how the villians from previous films are still out and about needing smacked around from time to time.  Harvey Dent...kind of a shifty character but is still likeable. Terrific.  The Dark Knight Rises...the opening sequence involving a plan hijacking is just great and the plot twists and turns are fun and suprising at times.  I even teared up a couple times watching the third movie.  Anne Hathaway did a great job as Selina Kyle.  My only complaint is the fact when it is a speaking/acting sequence...difficult to hear..so you turn it up then when something explodes it is sooooo loud!!",1358726400,,1117,4.770833333333333

5343179,5,B009JBWOU0,"I grew up watching Star Wars (the original trilogy) which was my end-all be-all trilogy sets. However, that throne has been taken by Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy. The films are utterly well-produced, well-written, well-edited pieces of art.

This box set is simple and effective in giving the three movies and the bonus features that were included in the special editions with the single movie releases. That should be good enough for most fans.

The only thing that irked me about this set is there is an insert telling you about the Ultimate Edition and that there is registration so you can buy whatever differences that are needed to 'upgrade' your edition to the Ultimate Edition. While it's nice that there is this option, I wish I had done a little research in case I wanted to buy the full Ultimate Edition. I had no idea it was coming out.",1358553600,,854,4.724832214765101

I can't watch anyone else play Batman except for Bale, nor any other Batman storyteller except for Nolan. Oh yes, Ledger was excellently cast as the Joker and Hathaway is the most interesting (and hot) Catwoman. This is the ultimate collaboration.

The package contains 5 blu ray discs and a 64-pages abridged booklet from the artbook 'The Art and Making of The Dark Knight Trilogy', which provides great information and awesome concept art regarding the making of the trilogy at hand.

The only advice that I might add to die-hard fans collectors is that, according to a code for discount, an upcoming Ultimate Collector's Edition will be release this year, aside with further memorabilia. If you prefer to get more collectibles added to your purchase you should wait for that one. although it may or may not be worth the wait, since the price for this collection is awesome for 3 blu ray discs movies plus 2 blu ray discs with special features for The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises (special features for Begins are included within the same disc).

The 3 Batman films in ony one book.",1358121600,,112,4.380952380952381
5343236,5,B009JBWOU0,"Having already owned Batman Begins on standard DVD and the Dark Knight on Bluray, it wasn't such an obvious choice to buy the entire box set for the third film. However, the price at the time was only a few dollars more than the third movie alone (about $28). For that price it was definitely worth it.

For those looking for the ""complete"" box set with all the trimmings you should probably wait for the later release set to come out this year. Or better yet, simply never buy any box set because there is always a better one around the corner. For someone who only wants the movies on Bluray, this is a great purchase even if you own some of the other films. I re-gifted my old copy of the Dark Knight.

The box is a good quality, sturdy cardboard that is actually a little unforgiving in terms of getting the movies out. I'm hoping that loosens up some in time. The movies themselves are a decent transfer with variable aspect ratios (IMAX and non-IMAX scenes). The art book is nice as well.

It looks great on a shelf, the movies are top notch, and the price was unbelievable.",1358121600,,1080,4.36318407960199
5343237,5,B009JBWOU0,"The movies: Never lets you down as far as expectation, storyline or resolution. Always has a way of keeping the excitement coming. The actors also had a way of portraying the characters in a way that 'spoke' to you and you really became interested in them even though they are fictional.
The Collection: Having all in one package is why I waited before buying any of them individually. I'm glad I did. The movies themselves were well worth the price paid. The quality and clarity of the transfers were better than as seen in the theater. Couple that with a decent sound system, and you have a completely enjoyable experience. The extras are excellent and would be of most interest to collectors and those who would just like to know more of the background. For me, indispensable. The packaging is compact and really belies the amount of value contained here.
Recommendation: HIGHLY! For any and everyone who loves movies to watch again. Purchase thru Amazon was easy, reliable and worry free.",1358121600,,992,4.807017543859649

I thought Violet would allow me to download the digital version but it only streams it - tried to set up an account but maybe my connection is too slooowww - after three tries at 5' ea, I said screw it - just stick with the discs. The included booklet is pretty cool, but so what- wish the cover design was better (some frank miller art maybe?). Well I'm going to watch it again in a few minutes. I know there are critics out there who point out some gaps in the story line with incredulity. I read comics and I read the news.

Something important seems to be going on . . . maybe. I mean, good things do happen, sometimes beautiful things. You meet someone, fall in love. You find that work that is yours alone to fulfill. But tragic things happen too. You fall out of love, or perhaps the other person falls out of love with you. Work begins to feel like a punishment. Everything starts to feel like an endless routine.

Life happens. But. It does not happen to you!
You happen to it!
We r not victims !
For everything that happens in life there is a decision I can make that will make the outcome manageable. Poor decisions: sad consequences. Good decisions : Happy Consequences.

The movies look breathtaking in the blu-ray format, especially Dark Knight Rises.

5343313,5,B009JBWOU0,"I was extremely pleased when my copy of the trilogy came in the mail. First off, all three movies are fantastic. Second, the packaging is great! On top of the three movies, you get a 64 page excerpt from ""The Art and Making of The Dark Knight Trilogy"" which I was not expecting. There is a fold out for the discs that I think is a nice package. The front of it is a holograph type affect which you can see partly from the product photo, but it looks very nice. I am a huge fan of owning packs like these for trilogies, etc. Overall I was very excited and pleased with the product. Definitely worth the money.",1357689600,,608,4.161016949152542

5343316,5,B009JBWOU0,"Rated high due to the great image and sound quality of the 3 movies. We opened them up and spent the whole day watching the whole trilogy. There is a slight difference in the sound volume overall with the last one, Dark Knight Rises, though, as everything seemed louder, especially Bane's voice. But maybe it had more to do with how we had set up soundwise. With the first 2 movies, we didn't need to change anything. Overall, it's quite an experience to finally get this.",1357689600,,472,4.5

If you're a fan of christopher nolan, batman or a newcomer this trilogy will blow you away.

Solid 3 movies; Begins is a classic, while TDK is a great sequel and TDKR is also a solid way to close the story arch. I kinda wish they wouldve packaged it the way The Star Wars Saga on Blu Ray or Deadwood on Blu Ray is packaged, like a book with slots to store the Blu Rays compared to the plastic clips that look cheap. I also own a Back to The Future Blu Ray set that has this same cheap plastic clipping, and I already broke a couple of the clips on that! So be careful.",1357516800,,624,3.7709923664122136

I may be the only person in the world, but Batman Begins is my favorite.  I own it on DVD already, but I always wanted to own it on Blu-ray.  I understand that there's not much they can visually improve upon, but this was a let down how BB looks.  Using a up converter DVD or Blu-Ray player with the original DVD looks the same.
Now, TDK and TDKR look amazing (and I could complain about the aspect ratio where it doesn't fill the screen but again that's how they shoot the movie, I get it...just stinks to have a nice TV, blu-ray, and disc and cannot get the full screen--I hate it).

Anyway, quick review of the individual movies
Batman Begins - 9/10
The Dark Knight - 8/10
The Dark Knight Rises - 7/10",1357516800,,935,4.242937853107344

When I first saw this price for a Trilogy, I immediately thought that something must be wrong.  No way could I puchase all three of the Dark movies for only 17.97, when Dark Knight Rises costs more than that on its own.  However, when it arrived, I was very happy with the purchase and was glad that I got two of them.  One for me and one for my brother.

5343449,5,B009JBWOU0,"I recently bought this for Christmas as my first blu-ray purchase. It's a great buy. I paid $40, shipping and all. The packaging is great, not cheap, flimsy cardboard or anything. The movies themselves are great, if you haven't seen them, you'll love them. The picture and audio is top notch. I've watched some of the special features and they're pretty interesting (and there's a lot of them!)I'm not sure but I'm pretty positive they're the same ones that come on the regular blu-ray versions so no new special features if you already have those. But I think the movies alone are worth the price. I haven't checked out the digital copies yet so I can't comment on that. But what some people may not like is the fact that The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises switch formats throughout the movies due to IMAX. It personally doesn't bother me, it switches formats when there's a cut to a different scene, not in the middle of the same one. And the IMAX scenes look stunning anyways.
Overall, I was very happy with this. A great price for three great movies (plus a ton of special features.) If you don't own the movies, this is the way to go.",1357344000,,1146,4.488038277511961

5343462,5,B009JBWOU0,"The third installment of The Dark Knight provides an outstanding ending to the Christopher Nolan directed trilogy of ""Batman Begins"", ""The Dark Knight"", and ""The Dark Knight Rises"". While the third installment is a little slow to develop, it does not disappoint in telling the final story. It is recommended that you watch all three films back to back to back to fully appreciate the final story since so much of it revolves around ""Batman Begins"", rather than ""The Dark Knight"". I will watch these three films again many times because the stories as told by Mr. Nolan and the screenwriters are outstanding as told on the big screen.",1357344000,,633,4.81651376146789

Nothing new or exclusive to the blu-ray set, but so what. The story is so good and te filmmaking is wonderful. I'm not a comic book guy nor was I even a Batman guy before these films, but I am now. These films meet all my criteria for a great movie: Good story, I care about the characters, limited CGI, and it's not in 3D.",1357344000,,468,4.0978260869565215

The surreal City of gotham comes to life with plots that bring some of the most insane  and briliantly perfomed villains you will ever see in any ""superhero"" movie.

5343561,5,B009JBWOU0,"Three fantastic movies gorgeously presented. Like many others, I already had ""Batman Begins"" and ""The Dark Knight"" but upgraded to this set since it was only a couple bucks more to buy it than ""The Dark Knight Rises"" by itself. No regrets!",1357084800,,239,4.714285714285714
5343562,5,B009JBWOU0,I'M GLAD I WAITED FOR THE COMBO SET TO COME OUT RATHER THAN BUYING EACH INDIVIDUALLY. WHAT I PAID FOR THE SET WAS JUST A LITTLE MORE THAN WHAT I WOULD HAVE PAID FOR ONE BLUE RAY ON RELEASE.,1357084800,,189,3.871794871794872
5343563,5,B009JBWOU0,Everyone should own this.  These movies are great.  There are a lot of extra features and having all three in a box set make the cost better.,1357084800,,141,4.185185185185185

5343565,5,B009JBWOU0,"I bought this as a gift and it was great. Great value for your money. I had looked at getting just ""The Dark Knight"" but saw the trilogy box and decided to get it instead.  You get three great movies for the price of 1 at any retail store!!",1357084800,,240,3.8979591836734695

5343567,5,B009JBWOU0,"I love the case, and the art book it comes with. All the Dark Knight films for $28, on Blu-Ray, was a fantastic deal. It's impossible not to feel satisfied with my purchase.",1357084800,,173,4.2727272727272725
5343568,5,B009JBWOU0,This trilogy got here quick and it was a present for my boyfriend for Christmas and he absolutely loves it!,1357084800,,107,4.4
5343569,1,B009JBWOU0,"I LOVE all three of these films and the Blu-Rays look great, but the ULTRAVIOLET copies they come with are a joke.  Not only do you have to set up TWO accounts online, but an error with their systems has made it impossible for me to watch the digital copies.

This is such a terrible system for delivering digital copies... I got this on Christmas day and here it is over a week later and I still cannot get the Ultraviolet copy to work with Flixster.  Their customer service is TERRIBLE!  I have emailed them six times and every time I get a generic response back telling me that nothing is wrong or give me generic directions on how to link my Ultraviolet and Flixster accounts, which is where I keep getting the same error MSG.

I have since tried two other content providers, but neither of them allow you to download the films to an iPad (streaming only), so I am not able to watch them unless connected to WiFi?? How does this make any sense??

I wish studios like Warner Brothers would not put so much faith behind such a TERRIBLE delivery system.  What was wrong with iTunes codes?  They are so much easier!  I will be trying to avoid anything that comes with UV or may just have to start buying titles on iTunes only.",1357084800,3,1226,4.342105263157895
5343570,5,B009JBWOU0,I love Batman so much and this is so incredible to own and I can't believe I paid less for this than I would have just buying one of the movies. This is the best.,1357084800,,162,3.657142857142857

5343574,5,B009JBWOU0,"Awesome set - the ""making of book"" which is included is a great feature for fans. Nice rubberized box has an ""upscale"" feel. This is a MUST for any fan of the Nolan Dark Knight series...

5343576,5,B009JBWOU0,I would recommend this product to anyone who enjoyed Christopher Nolan's take on the Batman series. I'm a huge fan and was not disappointed at this box set.,1357084800,,156,4.607142857142857

5343578,4,B009JBWOU0,"The material the box is made of feels quite nice and not cheap. Also looks nice on my shelf of Blu-rays.  I'm not giving it a perfect 5-star rating because the way the little 'behind-the-scenes' booklet is shoved in beside the removable fold out box that contains all the discs is not very elegant.  I would have preferred one inner box that sits inside the outer shell nice and snug. Still, a great set of movies in pretty nice packaging.",1357084800,,439,4.475
5343579,5,B009JBWOU0,If you are a fan of the batman series this set is a MUST OWN! Amazing set! Batman rises does an excellent job of introducing Robin to future batman movies and lot of potential!,1357084800,,176,4.205882352941177

I also noticed that on disc 1 the features don't play, i couldn't make the menu run, it goes straight to the movie",1357084800,,290,4.105263157894737

5343590,5,B009JBWOU0,"There's plenty of great reviews for the actual films so im skipping that. The pros are too many to list but these are my minor issues id like to share. Batman Begins and Dark Knight both lack main menus but do have a pop up menu. I prefer a full menu but thats just me. Dark Knight and Dark Knight Rises both have awesome IMAX shots, however the audio during those sequences is suddenly and noticeably lower. Which is odd because most of these scenes are action packed. Lastly, IMAX scenes have a different aspect ratio than the rest of the film so you're bound to notice the sudden black bars. My review may sound negative but these are minor issues that conflict with my preferences. Otherwise a must buy bundle for Batman and Nolan fans alike.",1356998400,,746,4.452554744525547
5343591,5,B009JBWOU0,I can't believe I found this set for under $30.  The asking price for Batman rises was $25 so it made complete sense to get the trilogy.,1356998400,,136,4.037037037037037

5343597,5,B009JBWOU0,"there is not too much to say about what the title already says. If you are thinking to buy this trilogy you already know it so my comments are ment for the product. It came even earlier than the expected delivery date, the box is made of a really good materials it feels like some kind of leather, and also comes with some extra freatures like the the ultraviolet copy (for mobile devices) and also a discount if you want to buy some collectors edition thing.",1356998400,,459,4.348837209302325

I don't know if this is a temporary problem or something ongoing, but either way it is unforgivable force a DRM system on your paying customers and then waste their time when it does not work. I may be in for a fight as I try to get a complete refund for a defective product even though the seal is broken on the physical copies.  The quality of the content is irrelevant if you cannot get through a flawed DRM delivery system.",1356998400,2,559,4.3238095238095235

I have seen that others are complaining that it doesn't come with a bunch of books and collectors crap which I am SO happy about. When we buy movies, we buy them for the movie not all the extra paper and garbage that they usually include.

Its also nice to have some additional content since the DVDs were pretty lacking. The box set is well put together and does not have a cheap feel. I have been waiting to watch the Dark Knight Rises on my home theater setup since the big screen release. Was not disappointed. If you like the Dark Knight trilogy then this is a must own.,1356912000,,449,4.172413793103448

5343632,5,B009JBWOU0,"First of all, I absolutely love all three movies.  Second of all, and by far the most important, was that all three are sold here for only roughly $30 whereas if you tried to buy The Dark Knight Rises by itself it costs around $26.  This package is a fantastic deal plus the little picture book that comes along with it is also very interesting and entertaining.  The case the movies are stored in is very solid not flimsy so you can be sure that the movies are protected.",1356912000,,472,4.280898876404494

5343634,3,B009JBWOU0,"Unfortunately, this trilogy does not allow a viewer the chance to watch the 3rd movie (The Dark Knight Rises) in a consistent 2.35:1 ratio. This common cinematic ratio is used in most ""widescreen"" films on DVD and Blu-Ray. Throughout the 3rd film, the format will change from 16:9, then to 2.35:1, then to 16:9 again.

This is a disappointment to have the Trilogy released with such a blatant flaw.

Edit: Below, I've been told that this is not a flaw but a purposeful act based on filming some scenes in 35mm and some on IMAX standard. I do not see how this solves the problem of moving from 2.35:1 to 16:9 and back; after all, it is a problem. One expects when purchasing these movies to see one ratio the entire time. We're not watching full-screen here anymore where the movie's story is shown in 4:3 and then the credits roll in 16:9.",1356912000,2,839,4.477124183006536

My problem with this particular product is with the Ultraviolet digital copy that comes with it.  It doesn't work plain and simple.  I've tried several times over the last two days and received errors when attempting to redeem the code that comes with the box.  Flixster Customer Service (non-existent) for this consists of the same lame form letter being sent over and over to apologize with my issue with their service and assures me someone is working on it.  However their knowledge base states there are no current issues with their service.

That makes this product a rip off.  You pay for the blu-ray disks and digital copy and you only get the blu-ray disks.  Seems like fraud to me.",1356652800,,785,4.713235294117647

5343706,4,B009JBWOU0,"Noticed when watching The Dark Knight Rises (bluray), certain scenes full up my tv (16:9 ratio) and then other scenes the black letter box appears.  Its not real noticable but it is kinda annoying.  Rewatched a few scenes and it switches the same time, each time.  Any other's Blu-ray disc doing this?

EDIT- Did a lil more research and I guess its normal. Annoying still..

Dustin French says:

All right, I hope this clears everything up:
The disc is not defective, and there is no way to ""correct it"" because it IS NOT a mistake. IMAX film is 70mm and is natively 1.85:1. The aspect ratio that the director wanted with his 35mm film was 2.35:1. Plus, IMAX film is clearer than regular. AND it's more expensive. Therefore, the director only purchased enough film for the action sequences that HE WANTED in the movie. It was his artistic choice in doing so. I saw the films in theatre, and they changed aspect ratios as well, so the blu-rays are doing their job in representing the films in the way that they were shot.

Remember when DVDs first came out, and your parents complained that they could see ""black bars"" on the top and bottom of the screen; and you told them that it's completely normal because VHS tapes were all converted to Pan and Scan? This is the same deal: there's nothing wrong with it.",1356652800,,1308,4.540425531914893

There is NOTHING beyond that on any disc: no director's commentary, no behind the scenes, nothing. How can there not be any commentary?!?! It doesn't even take up any space! The real drag is that as far as I can tell there is no place to get any of the myriad extras except by getting the Blu-Ray discs. That sucks.

It also comes with a booklet with is selections of pictures from the book The Art and Making of The Dark Knight Trilogy... Meh.",1356566400,,602,4.327433628318584
5343723,5,B009JBWOU0,These are by far the best batman and comic book character movies ever made.  I've watched them again and again.  It still blows my mind how clear the blue-ray picture is on my tv.,1356566400,,179,4.235294117647059
5343724,3,B009JBWOU0,"** This is not a review of the movies **  Chances are that if you're looking at this, you're already familiar with the movies or at least have heard how good they are.  This review is only for the box set.

The box set comes with a tri-fold cardboard case for the 3 disks.  I haven't looked through each one to see if they include bonus materials but the production description says they do.  It also comes with a small glossy booklet with some behind the scenes pictures.  The front cover of the box (pictured) is ""holographic"" and changes between the posters from the 3 movies as you look at it from different angles.

This package also comes with streaming versions of the movies via UltraViolet which is accessible through Flixster.  I already had a Flixster account before buying this so I didn't go through the signup step.  But I tried to redeem the movies using the code on Christmas day and had a lot of problems.  Maybe there were a lot of people doing it or just server problems at the time (like Netflix was having too).  But it did eventually work and I can see the 3 movies on my list of ""movies I own"".  I've also tried to watch them through Flixster on my iPad (1st Gen).  It's a bit buggy.  The app crashed a few times.  Sometimes the movie didn't load and I had to try reloading.  But in general, it does seem to work.  And I can probably play it on my iPhone at a cafe.

Originally I gave it 4 out of 5 for a nice box and streaming.  Updated to 3 out of 5 due to lack of special features as pointed out by another customer.",1356566400,4,1542,4.201365187713311
5343725,5,B009JBWOU0,Three of my favorite movies. No reason not to own them on BluRay. I kind of wish they came with DVD copies as well but you can't win it all. Definitely worth it for the price.,1356566400,,175,3.888888888888889
5343726,5,B009JBWOU0,"I finally received it after Christmas and I must say that I loved this trilogy directed by Nolan. I bought the DVD version of this trilogy and they all work and play smoothly. However, the quality is a bit grainy when I played it on my PS3. I used to play Blu ray movies but since I'm an avid gamer I usually just buy DVD version to watch on my desktop.

It pretty much comes with the three films (DVD version):

Batman Begins feature film
The Dark Knight feature film
The Dark Knight Rises feature film

and the 64 page art book of the Dark Knight Trilogy

There was another offer about the Ultimate Edition coming in the new year but I just overlooked it since I only wanted the three films just to watch. Good thing I bought this when it was on a sale for three great films!

Pros:

- Nice cover design and casing of the DVD version
- Art book of the TDK Trilogy
- All three films of courses

Cons

- Sound is alright but it can be worked around by using your own surround system
- Quality is a bit grainy but I guess that's what you get for a DVD",1356566400,,1050,4.038647342995169

5343728,4,B009JBWOU0,This three pack was a fantastic deal for the price. I got all three movies plus special features for less than $30.  My only complaint is that the digital copies are processed through UltraViolet rather than iTunes or Windows Media Player. This means to play them on my portable devices I have to download an extra app that only works half the time.,1356566400,,349,4.5396825396825395

But when one of the selling points is a digital copy, I want my digital copy to actually be useful to me.  UltraViolet is not.  It's a pain to create an account, and a much bigger pain to actually watch the content that you've paid for.

5343744,5,B009JBWOU0,"First of all everything was perfect! It really got my attention in every single of these movies! The first one really narrows it down of how Bruce Wayne's life was impacted and him wanting to save the world of Gotham ! He wanted to show people that they shouldn't be afraid to feel scared at night!

The dark knight was probably the best one. Maybe I enjoyed it a lot with the spectacular acting of Heath ledger it made the film 100 times better and this was a great film

The dark knight rises
This film was maybe the best one, I don't know but dark knight and the dark knight rises were really good ! This movie got my attention with catwoman coming in the dark knight films from Christopher Nolan!! Great triology ! I really do hope christoper Nolan can maybe think again and make one more dark knight ! It's probably my favorite movies out there. Seriously

The one thing I did not like about this was since its blu- ray I expected everything to be 1080p but since they used the IMAX format unfournately not everything was 1080p and that got me really disappointed but other than that everything was great!",1356566400,,1110,4.404878048780488

This product comes with 5 Blu-ray discs, of which 3 are the movies and the other 2 are bonus. The booklet of photos is a nice addition to this product, although I did not find myself greatly attracted to actually looking through it.

The inner case tugs a bit on the outer case, doesn't it? That's some nice friction. Now smell it. Stick your nose right in there. God, it smells just like the inside of Batman's costume. Just close your eyes and smell. Now feel it again. You're there. You're right in Batman's costume. Your dream has come true.",1356480000,,478,4.569767441860465

I'm in the process with amazon in getting another copy hope all goes well on this one!

5343763,5,B009JBWOU0,"I'm not going to give you a movie review on these three films. Obviously, if you are searching the Dark Knight trilogy for purchase, I would assume you are a fan of the movies. I pre-ordered the trilogy before the release date on Amazon, without really comparing prices on other sites, because I know Amazon would have the lowest price guarantee. Well, I realized after it came out, the price on Amazon went down by $2. I thought it was odd that the price dipped after release, but soon I got a email from Amazon saying that it was providing me a $2 refund. In the end it's only $2, but it's the little things like this that has me coming back to Amazon for most of my purchasing needs.",1356480000,,686,4.2846153846153845

I was like, ""what the h*ll!? Then why'd I buy THIS if you're just gonna Rerelease the same movies but with a ton of tasty special features?!

5343765,3,B009JBWOU0,"I love these movies. In my opinion, this is the new Star Wars trilogy. These movies took visual storytelling to a new place, while at the same time telling a great story.

Everyone else has already covered the good, so I'll get right to the bad. I received this set as a Christmas gift and immediately watched Dark Knight Rises. Thrilling. But I was constantly adjusting the volume because it goes up and down drastically throughout the film. It would go down in odd places, where it seemed like it might have been an intentional choice on the part of the director to make everything get really quite, but it got so quiet that I had to adjust the volume to hear the dialogue at all (for example, when Batman first fights Bane in the sewers).

So, do I love these movies? Yes. Would I recommend this product? No. It's possible that I'm missing something, and that this is somehow a problem with my equipment and not with the product, but Prometheus plays just fine. In fact, this is the only time I've had this problem since the original Highlander DVD.",1356480000,,1052,4.50261780104712

This review will be in regards to the actual collection you are purchasing. The quality of the materials used in the packaging is very good. This is a sturdy box, with a sturdy sleeve that comes out. When you unfold the sleeve there are nice graphics (as you can tell from the picture) and you do not feel like the sleeve will rip apart. If you enjoy these movies and want to get them all in one collection (with 2 bonus discs; one for The Dark Knight, and one for The Dark Knight Rises) then this set is for you. The booklet that comes with the set fits nice and snug in the box, but doesnt really contain much content. There are some good concept art sketches and still photos of sets and props, but that is about it. Do not buy this collection for the booklet alone.

5343797,5,B009JBWOU0,"Fantastic trilogy. Only thing, be aware that both Dark Knight and Dark Knight Rises were shot with both IMAX and 35mm cameras, therefore there is going to be scenes such as the amazing intro scene in Dark Knight that is boasting amazing full screen HD, then there will be the scenes with horizontal bars above and below the screen. Can be distracting, but on the other hand, comics have different sized scenes so it can add to the comic illusion! Fantastic trilogy nonetheless!!!",1356307200,,479,4.783132530120482

If not for The Dark Knight's amazing success, The Dark Knight Rises would not feel so unremarkable by some.

Also, Batman Begins and The Dark Knight should have a menu instead of just starting the movie. It isn't a deal breaker but is very annoying. On a positive note, trailers for other movies are removed which is wonderful. The films are spectacular and you could tell when they incorporate the IMAX scenes for some of the bigger scenes. The audio isn't super as a standalone so if you have an audio system, set it up.",1356220800,,586,4.644230769230769

5343814,4,B009JBWOU0,"As far back as I can recall being a fan of anything related to comic books, the comic book film was a genre that was always wrapped in imperfection. While there were those who gave it praise there were those that felt it was a butchery of all that was pure in their world. I would have to say that excluding a very select few, I was never satisfied when it came to films adapted by comic books.

Christopher Nolan, a director whom I had known about, but never truly new back in 2005 finally said it is time for the world of comic books to be take seriously. While X-MEN & Spider-Man had already began going down that path 'Batman Beings' not only perfected the evolution, but it also finally gave us a fantastic scripted, cast & homage to Bob Kanes' icon. Fast forward to 2012 and you have one of the most beautiful comic book franchises in history...yet at a price none the less.

Everything about these three films is wonderful, but once again as someone who adores the new Marvel film universe, it is going to be very hard to bring the world of DC comics to the big screen. Superman and Batman seem to be the only ones that any director or writer wants to tackle and now with how real and dark that Nolans 'trilogy is it is going to be even harder to bring heroes like Wonder Woman, The Flash and yes even a good Green Lantern sequel to the big screen. Still, with Zack Snyder tackling the Superman franchise and a Justice League film on the horizon in 2015 I have a feeling that it can be done. The three Dark Knight films of course are wonderful the massive cast that was gathered for these films are perfect, Christian Bale was the perfect Bruce Wayne and it is about time that was done correctly. Heath Ledger (RIP) wowed me as the Joker and as a fan of Anne Hathaway, I adored her as Catwoman. This is a film experience unlike any other and they will be treasured for years to come. I am just so happy that when I have kids of my own and they are old enough to learn about Batman, along side the Animated Series and the Adam West film these will be films I will be excited and proud to share with them.",1356134400,,2110,4.22029702970297

The third movie included in this case, The Dark Knight Rises, is around 25 dollars alone. It is almost like getting the first two movies for free.

Considering this trilogy doesn't even cost $20, the value here is pretty insane. You get the three best Batman movies to date in a nice folding style case and a ""making of"" booklet, all contained within a very sturdy and cool looking box.

My only gripe is that the art booklet has to be in the box along with the DVD set in order to make everything fit snug. I wish the box width was designed for just the DVDs and the art booklet was separate. Hardly worth knocking a star off for, though.

You also get an Ultra-Violet copy with this, but I've heard some pretty bad things about UV. Personally, I don't use digital copies of movies, so I couldn't care less.

I do notice that amazon has boosted the price on everyone else after. I don't know why but i guess it's a fast seller and someone is making tons of money off the cuts.

5343911,5,B009JBWOU0,"I got this trilogy set and it is awesome! A lifelong fan of Batman and superheroes, I've seen just about all of my favorites done justice in live action movies. This trilogy hit the peak. Loved each film. I know there are haters out there, people who have some sort of loyalty to Marvel or DC, and simply those who just don't like superheroes. I don't care. I love it; I like Marvel and DC. Like I said though, I think I've reached a peak. I've seen about all I NEED to see(accept a great Superman movie in this modern age. Perhaps Man of Steel will get it right). All in all, I'm satisfied. I'm sure Hollywood will churn out more and more of these movies, and I'm sure we'll get some more good ones, but for me, I'll never have that high level of anticipation as I've had up to The Dark Knight Rises. Batman is my all time favorite hero. And now I have the ultimate trilogy. I just add that to Batman 1989, Spiderman 1 & 2, X2, Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, Captain America, Thor, X-Men First Class and The Avengers to just about complete my great superhero movie collection. Nolan has fulfilled my dreams. Great director IMHO. Long live The Dark Knight Trilogy.",1355529600,,1164,4.344036697247707

5343922,4,B009JBWOU0,"The trilogy has come to an end. Sadly no more movies will Christopher Nolan make in this awesome, sinister, and heroic trilogy of three of some of the best films in cinematic history. What, with all the gadgets like the tumbler or batman's awesome ability to adapt to darkness and scare the friggin daylights out of his criminal escapies. The best villian in the trilogy in my opinion was definitely Heath Ledger's Joker. He was like a wild, rabid, animal let out of its cage. His mastermind plans are what sets the movie in its place. I love Bane in the Dark Knight Rises, but, nobody beats the joker(Though I still admire Tom Hardy's portrayal of the intimidating, Scary, facemasked, and frightening Bane). The movie with the best storyline in my opinion is Batman Begins. The rough journey of Bruce Wayne after his parents were shot and killed right in front of him was intriguing. He works hard to become part of the league of shadows to help carry out Ra's al ghul's destiny.(Ra's al ghul is an essiental villian throughout the trilogy even though he is only there in person in Batman Begins). He betrays the league of shadows and becomes The Dark Knight. This blu ray release was only given 4 stars because though it is very durable with nice and easy packaging, it lacks in essential Bonus Material that I would have liked to have been included in this set. An example is behind the scenes interviews and bonus material with Heath Ledger on the set of The Dark Knight. I don't think this is included with the other version of the trilogy coming out in 2013. Anyway, Nolan fans, batman fans, dc fans, and fans in general, I hope you pick this up because this set should be essential to a part of the shelf in your collection.

5343942,5,B009JBWOU0,I did not see these in the theater but I was anxious to check out the Blu rays.  The picture is great and sound is phenomenal.  I would recommend these to any Batman fan. The packaging is nice and a cool booklet is included.  I like it.,1355270400,,236,3.978723404255319
5343943,5,B009JBWOU0,"Amazing. You get both physical and digital copies. Highly recommended. Dark knight rises, to own it would cost you $15.00 alone, just for the digital copy.",1355270400,,155,5.0
5343944,1,B009JBWOU0,I got this as a gift for my wife she is a big batman fan. One of big reason I bought if for is the digital copy. Well talk about a hassle. Still going back and forth with flixter trying to get it to work. Plus you need to make an account for ultraviolet. But wait there is more! It seems that the digital copy won't work are her iPhone or iPad !! Amazon should sell this with a warning label!!,1355270400,6,393,3.8641975308641974

5343946,5,B009JBWOU0,This blu ray set is great.  It comes with 5 disks with special features.  I waited in line for over 8 hours to watch the dark knight rises on opening night.  For the price of $30 bucks this is a must buy.  Especially for those who do not want to drop the money for the collectors edition coming out in 2013.,1355270400,,307,3.9836065573770494

5343963,5,B009JBWOU0,Picture quality is great! The case seems to be sturdy and has a leathery feel to it. I guess this is meant to give you a sense that you are touching Batman's mask.,1355184000,,163,3.9696969696969697

I got everything i asked for 2 days before i was supposed to get it (i missed them yesterday so I actually got it this morning). everything plays fine in my ps3. glad i got this when it was only $30",1355184000,,293,3.983050847457627
5343966,5,B009JBWOU0,I could not believe the price of this even as a DVD set it came in a nice box set with an additional book.  All three movies for $17.00.  All three movies are excellent I enjoyed Batman begins to see how Batman really came to fruition and the other two were great as well.  I think everyone agrees the Dark Knight is the best of the trilogy but in my opinion it is very close between all three.  All great films.  Definitely a teen at the least film with some pretty graphic violence and dark outlook but a great collection to add to my film collection,1355184000,,552,4.169811320754717
5343967,5,B009JBWOU0,These have to be the most important DVDs in our collection. I absolutely couldn't wait until it came out. I love it,1355184000,,115,4.2727272727272725

5343969,5,B009JBWOU0,If you like movies that are on discs that play when inserted into functional blu-ray players then you're in luck.,1355184000,,113,4.7
5343970,5,B009JBWOU0,The Dark Knight Trilogy is one of the coolest film series ever. That's all I have to say about the films. This trio-package is awesome though. It is beautiful and it comes with a cool booklet full of artwork. This is truly a must for fans that just can't get enough of the bat.,1355184000,,277,4.148148148148148
5343971,5,B009JBWOU0,"I already had Begins and Dark Knight in DVD mode but when this offer came out, it was a no brainer. Great special features and lowest price. Plus it also comes with a digital copy. Definitely recommend it to everyone.",1355184000,,217,4.45

If your a bat man fan i recommend it",1355184000,,105,3.8181818181818183
5343974,5,B009JBWOU0,Love the batman movies and this is a good triology to buy. . . . . . . . .,1355097600,,74,2.75
5343975,5,B009JBWOU0,"Wow, I was really skeptical when I saw this was such a low price. 18 dollars???? But, all three dvds worked perfectly, and it came in this cool holographic case that changed depending on how you looked at it([...])

If you love the movies, but don't care about collectors edition, or anything like that, then buy this. Extremely good deal and also comes with a cool little picture book on how they made the movie.",1355097600,,413,4.506666666666667
5343976,5,B009JBWOU0,Awesome trilogy set! I sold my previous DVD-versions of Batman Begins and The Dark Knight. I'm glad I have the Blu-ray versions now since I finally acquired a Blu-ray player.,1355097600,,174,4.833333333333333
5343977,3,B009JBWOU0,"I would've given this 2 1/2 stars if I could.  First off, the Batman Begins disc did not have any bonus features on it even though it was advertised as having them. Second, all of these movies are ""letterbox"" versions with the bars at the top and bottom of the screen. On TDK, the aspect ratio bounces back from the IMAX ratio to the letterbox ratio which gets annoying. Last, there are no menu options on any of the movie discs. This means if you want to stop the disc temporarily, your player will not be able to resume where you left off. I thought maybe it was my player but it did the same thing on a friends Blu-ray player too. Fast forwarding gets really annoying. I pre-ordered this item from amazon for under $30 when it was released. That was a really good deal if you want basic versions of the trilogy. I wouldn't pay the new price of $40. I'd stick with buying them individually for now until Warner Bros. releases a Deluxe version next year.",1355097600,,955,4.335195530726257
5343978,5,B009JBWOU0,good quality arrived undamaged and best of all its for a goood goood did i mention good price 3 blu ray movies for the price of one why not.. looks amazin on my sony led tv,1355097600,,172,3.8055555555555554
5343979,5,B009JBWOU0,This is one of the best trilogies ever made so don't waste any more time and get this now!!! The only thing I don't like about this set is that it comes with ultra violet...and i HATE ultra violet. Just give me a digital copy.,1355097600,,226,4.044444444444444
5343980,5,B009JBWOU0,"Luckily, I opened my copy of this package on day 1 (December 4, 2012). Apparently, you have to redeem the code by that day. BE CAREFUL if you want the UVVU copy on your computer. I don't know if this is happening to anyone else.

For the review of the actual trilogy. You get all three movies and that's what I will be looking at. All three are amazing movies and they tie in together. That's what it means to be a trilogy. Here's what you should know.

Batman Begins: Looks at Batman's origins and into his psyche as he fights his first villain.
The Dark Knight: As the Batman, Bruce Wayne will use his detective skills to take down another villain.
The Dark Knight Rises: The tragedy from 'The Dark Knight' weighs heavily on Bruce Wayne as he faces the consequences from 'Batman Begins'.",1355097600,,789,4.43448275862069
5343981,5,B009JBWOU0,It was everything I had hoped for. A sleek case along with all the great batmans. Everything looks and works great. Couldn't have asked for more.,1355097600,,145,4.615384615384615
5343982,5,B009JBWOU0,"This package is great - all three batman movies (the good ones anyway).  In the first movie Nolan recovers Batman from the evil clutches of George Clooney et al.  You get a hero without the cheese.  In the second movie you get one of the greatest portrayals of a villain ever - there's a reason Heath Ledger won an Oscar.  The only complaint I have about ""The Dark Knight"" is that it is too long. The final installment is my favorite although I have heard some complaints about the way Bane was portrayed.  Having not read the comics, this was not a problem for me.  The set includes the ultra violet downloads for all three movies.  I would go to Walmart before I ordered in off Amazon though.  It was $10 cheaper.",1355097600,,715,4.363636363636363
5343983,5,B009JBWOU0,Weird aspect ratio changes in the 1 movie I watched so far (dark night) but great movies at an even better price,1355097600,,112,4.136363636363637
5343984,5,B009JBWOU0,"This Dark Knight Trilogy blu-ray set seems a lil simple & basic for a boxed set, which I would've anticipated it to be fancier packaging. Overall, the Dark Knight series is just plain awesome!!! My only question to anyone reading my brief review is: Why is it that in TDKR, the picture sometimes shifts between fullscreen & widescreen? I'm confused with what's this all about, unless I missed some tech specs regarding this blu-ray compilation?",1355097600,,444,4.933333333333334

5343986,4,B009JBWOU0,I was pretty disappointed at the bonus material. I was hoping to see more behind the scenes production stuff... I can't complain though. It is a very good deal for all 3 movies!,1355097600,2,177,4.393939393939394

5343990,5,B009JBWOU0,So glad i bought.  Was worried that Amazon wouldn't get it to me by the date that i could have bought it in stores but they came through.  Second movie still the best.  Love the Blu-Ray.  It takes movie watching to a whole new level.,1355097600,,233,4.111111111111111

5343994,1,B009JBWOU0,"The movies were great and are even better when watching them back to back. However when I bought my Blu-Ray player I made the decision to buy only the premium products (deluxe edition/special editions/directors cuts etc etc) I did not want to clutter up my collection with movies I might watch once or maybe twice. The things I buy now I know I will watch at lease several times. The reason I gave it one star is simply because AFTER you open it there is a little piece of paper telling you that in 2013 there will be a Deluxe Edition box set released. I would have rather waited and paid a little more for the deluxe edition.

Also each disk goes from scenes in full screen to letterbox and back again but I am told that is because of the IMAX scenes.

If you are like me and want to buy the special/deluxe editions in box sets do not buy this YET.",1355011200,24,849,4.2024539877300615

Well to my disappointment I did not get The Dark Knight Rises. Its just missing. I did however get two Dark Knight Rises special features disks. Be careful if you are giving this as a Christmas gift and check to make sure that all the correct disks are there.

What more do you want. Blu ray + media device copy + some extra features + book = a great $30 value pack. These Nolan's batman franchise are awesome.

5344008,1,B009JBWOU0,"This is NOT a negative review of the Movies but the 5 disk set

Biggest issue the switching of aspect ratio during the Dark Knight Rises.  Changes from wide-screen letterbox to full screen 16x9 throughout the film.  It is very distracting and WB should offer replacement disk free of charge. This is blockbuster film this should never happen.

The second issue is the special feature disks, is just foo foo.  There is nothing insightful just rather plain interviews and the navigation is horrible.  I didn't purchase the set for these but if they are included make them worthwhile not just an advertising gimmick.

Ultraviolet only allows you to use Flixster or VUDU to host the video.  These cloud advertising sites that mine your data for $$ while hosting a so so copy of the movie.  A better option would be to allow private YouTube up loads.  Ultraviolet is a broker skimming off the top and adding no value to the process.  I try not support these types of companies it just encourages them.  Like anything cloud you could lose access to these at anytime.",1354924800,3,1060,4.701086956521739

5344010,5,B009JBWOU0,"The cover and the contents of this bare bones set is top notch.  I was going to see the third film at the movies until the events that unfolded in the news.  For the seventeen dollars and change you get all three movies.  The last one, dispite what critics have said, is just as good as the previous films. I ususally like the director's commentary and extras with these sets.  There are few extras but the content of these movies more than makes up for it.  All three movies are very intense and will last with repeated viewings.  I don't have a Blue Ray and really can't afford the cost of upgrading to a new player.  However the picture quality is fine and good enough for my current TV set.  I'm thinking future editions will have some type of commentary.  However there isn't any from the director in this set. The movies are so good that I'm not concerned with that paticular ""extra"" that could have been added.",1354924800,2,917,4.410714285714286
5344011,5,B009JBWOU0,"It seems Warner Brothers likes to milk BD sets for every penny they can. Take this fine example - The new Batman Trilogy. It is billed with '2 discs of Special Features'. No, on a BD, a full disc could hold HOURS of material. There's no new features for Batman Begins. The Special Features for the Dark Knight are about 30 minutes total, though the Dark Knight Rises almost makes up for it with a fairly hefty delivery of extra stuff. I just expected more stuff.

As far as the films? Why parrot what everyone else has already said? These BD are absolutely beautiful in HD and a powerful soundtrack (only 5.1 DTS, but still)It looks better than it did in IMAX. And that's why most folk bought this trilogy set. So while I have a few issues with it, I can't rate it lower, especially for the price that Amazon is currently offering.

I have no doubt there will be a 'bigger' BD collection for these films somewhere down the road. But for now, I can manage with this set. And if you are on the fence about making the change to Blu-Ray in regards to these films, do it. Do it now. This collection is worth it.",1354924800,2,1106,4.287081339712919

While people tend to focus on the acute realism, it is not so grounded that it defies the source in which it came from. The three films circle around different Batman comic arcs in unique ways. This boxset includes:

Batman Begins (2005)
The Dark Knight (2008)
The Dark Knight Rises (2012)

A 64 page book detailing behind the scenes with the inside look many of us have been yearning for, which makes for an entertaining read. Those hours of extra content on the discs are just not always as accessible as a quick read available right away at your fingertip. All three films come in great, the picture truly is wonderful as it actually is filmed on, well film. 70 mm cameras come in handy when heightened realism is at foot, which illustrates a distinct contrast to the digital jitter of today's 'films'. The explosive scenes and death defying stunts go beyond the mystery of cape and cowl, the bonus content reveals the meticulous care for quality and picture quality.

Batman Begins is self-explanatory, Bruce Wayne finds himself with guilt, anger, and more importantly fear. He must confront his inner demons to establish truthful vengeance. Begins was foreshadowed by its 2008 sequel The Dark Knight, which displayed Heath Ledger's acting prowess as the chaotic Joker.

Batman's dilemmas were always skin deep, literally as Bruce Wayne juggles his persona's before the Jokers attempt to disrupt society. The Dark Knight gravitated audiences eyes on the villain whose intensity was so hot make up would smear and further taint that gruesome near necrotic scar cheek to cheek.  It was as though Bruce's conflict were buried in favor of the Joker's antagonizing run through Gotham City. It is not to be overlooked though, the Joker tempts Batman's vary nature. The Dark Knight is often considered top dog of the three, pitting Begins and Rises for the second position.

In all honesty I thought The Dark Knight Rises was just as engaging, just not in equal amounts. Rises, frame for frame is every bit as good as The Dark Knight. Ounce for ounce it becomes a bit more on the rare side when it comes to Batman, who has disappeared after the events of The Dark Knight. Likened to that of a hermit Bruce once again must learn what it means to be Batman, and not just a man in a mask.

I wrote up an in-depth review for The Dark Knight Rises the other evening, which can be found under the normal release of the film, if anyone is interested. The `Ultraviolet' digital stream is available until December 2014, the other slip insert I still have yet to read. The box itself is quite nice for the price. Best obtain now, three great films with a book and a digital `copy' for a little over the price of the average movie release is quite the deal.

I had to shrink the video, literally compressing it to a file size that would upload. I apologize about the video size, and the noise. Lastly, this trilogy is a great buy, the price is just a bonus.",1354579200,116,3443,5.20216606498195
5344056,1,B009JBWOU0,"I thought it was too good to be true and it was.  The trilogy is great except that it is missing one major area...special features.  If you want them at all, skip this version and wait for them to be added in on later trilogy versions.",1354579200,6,235,4.086956521739131
5344057,5,B009JBWOU0,"I was going to get TDKR by itself since I already have the first two movies, but I'm a sucker for box sets and decided to get this since it was only five dollars extra. Not only does it come with all three movies, it has all the bonus features AND digital copies for each film. Exclusive to this box set is a booklet of art designs and on-set photos. The box itself isn't some cheapo piece of cardboard; it's very thick/sturdy and has a nice soft feel to it. I also like the new Bat-symbol artwork on the discs themselves.

I can't believe how cheap they're selling this right now. I couldn't be happier with it.",1354579200,6,612,4.230769230769231
5344058,4,B009JBWOU0,"I'll be forever grateful to Christopher Nolan for Batman Begins.  The Dark Knight was unusually effective, but Batman Begins rescued The Detective from Joel Schumacher and certain death.  The Dark Knight Rises is purely an exercise in audience fulfillment, and rightly so.  It doesn't have the dramatic chops to ""rise"" above its predecessor, but that's a tall order.  In my estimation, Christopher Nolan's aural films will not age as well as people think.  Batman Begins was a bit dry, The Dark Knight was too long and the Dark Knight Rises both dry and too long.  Inception too is one that works the first time and depreciates quickly on repeated viewings.  But for the sake of entertainment, this trilogy won't go quickly into the ""night"" so to speak.  Someday a better Batman will indeed show up, but it's good we've got these three for now.

The Batman Begins Blu-Ray was once a trend setter and it still looks good.  The sound pales greatly in comparison to it's successors however.  The Dark Knight still pops so obviously the new TDKR Blu-Ray is pretty darn good.  The 35mm footage might as well be 16mm compared to the excellent  IMAX scenes. I think the discrepancy in quality is much more jarring here than in either Inception or The Dark Knight.  Wally Pfister's shallow depth of field lensing on the large format footage looks great at times, but the focus puller often struggles to keep up with the actors so we get a missed focus and a eyeful of bokeh vomit.  As a photographer, I usually gravitate toward a frame full of content rather than a waxy out of focus picture, but that's personal.  I think the picture isn't even the highlight of the disc really.  The surround sound on this baby will blow your windows out man.  The foley artists, sound mixers and Hans Zimmer really put a show on for you in the Dark Knight Rises if you have the setup to tap into.

5344061,5,B009JBWOU0,"I'm gonna keep this review short and sweet. These movies are extraordinary in every sense of the word. Each move has a perfect cast with two main antagonists and (obviously) one main protagonist, Batman. In this trilogy we see batman as a young man beginning a legend, we see batman face the chaos of organized crime, and we witness an end to the dark knight legend. These movies are easily in my top 20 of greatest movies maybe even top 10. This collector's edition is not the ultimate collector's edition which will be released in the spring, but this is an amazing collection nevertheless. For just 25$ i would've been jubilant with just the movies but they even throw in the ultraviolet copies of the movies (which i know have been panned though i have not tried it yet), a discount for when the ultimate edition is released in the spring, and an abridged version of the book ""the art of making the dark knight trilogy"".

5344083,5,B009JBWOU0,"Christopher Nolan, while a brilliant film maker, isn't the most gracious when it comes to home releases. What I mean by this is that he has historically never really included deleted scenes or Director's Cuts of his movies. I would likely either wait for the deluxe edition or buy it also if we were getting extended directors cuts, but Nolan has pretty much squashed that by saying he doesn't do that; the film that hits theaters is the one he wants everyone to see.

There have been rumors of deleted scenes with Ledger's Joker for TDK and there are confirmed cut scenes/story lines that tell much more of Bane's back story and evolution into the villain we see in TDKR. According to the woman who worked on the costumes and make up, we would see Bane's scared body after surgeries, early versions of the mask, the importance of a belt that he wears, and his LOS training. Before the film was screened, she confirmed that this was filmed and thought she was teasing parts of the movie. If I remember correctly, she said something along the lines of ""I'd imagine it would be in the movie and not cut. They filmed it."" Based on Nolan's comments and rumors of a director's extended cut being debunked by WB, I don't see what more a deluxe edition could really offer besides little collector's items (that I personally don't really care about anyway). Commentary would be nice, but I doubt Nolan would go back and do that.

So with virtually no chance of getting extended cuts or deleted scenes, why not just pick up the trilogy now for a great price? TDKR is $24.99. For $5 more you can get the other two films as well! I already own BB and TDK, but as a blu ray collector, I will welcome saving a little bit of space having all three in one neat package. Not to mention we get the little book to flip through if you aren't able to pop in the movie right away when it arrives.

Obviously I haven't seen the film on blu ray yet, but I'm sure it will be spectacular. I'm buying these now at a great price because I don't think we will ever get extended editions in a deluxe package. Hope I'm wrong though!",1354147200,5,2102,4.3984575835475574

5344096,1,B009JBWOU0,"Well it may seem trivial to some people, but to the collector and fan when a box set of any kind (especially a trilogy) is released we expect nice packaging with cool (or at least tasteful) cover art. This looks like a cover to an early DVD from 1997, worthy of the original Burton/Schumacher Batman Anthology (in fact that box set has much better cover art). From other reviews I've read, there are no deleted scenes and little to no bonus material which is not only a drag, but frankly a bit insulting, it sorta gives the impression of ""we know you'll buy it so just pay us already, we don't feel like spending time on this."" Which is pretty much true because in 2013 Warner Bros. is re-releasing this in an Ultimate Trilogy set, so this one is really just a petty, half-assed, interim cash-in. It consists basically of the three films, the first two which we all probably already own, and the last one being undoubtedly the weakest of the three. As a fan and collector who didn't particularly care for TDKR (I don't think I'm alone here) I would have most likely bought this to have the complete trilogy as most of us probably would. I maybe would have settled for basically no bonus material, but the cover art almost seems like it's mocking us. Seriously, it's that bad to me as a fan that I almost feel slapped in the face. It's almost laughing at us for handing our money over, and just like the edited Star Wars blu ray releases, I refuse to partake. We as the fans made this franchise a success, and they won't throw us a fraction of our due - why even bother?",1351468800,17,1569,4.376712328767123
5344097,2,B009JBWOU0,"I know most people don't really care about the Commentary or Deleted Scenes anymore but I feel like for this trilogy since we've all already bought the movies ""Batman Begins"" and ""The Dark Knight"" before it would be nice to throw us a bone and say, hey, here is an easter egg where on this box set you get Director Commentary and Deleted Scenes which all you fans have been asking for since 2005.  It makes me feel like eventually they will release another box set with those particular features when they want to make a little more money off the franchise.  I know I am going to get slammed for this on the internet but I still feel as a film that Batman Begins was definitely the most complete of all the movies, meaning, without all the plot holes and the most solid story.  I'm not saying that HEath Ledger wasn't great as the Joker, and that The Dark Knight Rises wasn't a massive scale movie beyond the likes of most in the genre, but as a film Batman Begins is the most complete.  Just my opinion and we are all entitled to our opinion.  That being said, the Dark Knight Rises is a Batman movie that is the most ""Comic Booky"" of the franchise and I think it hurts the franchise and has massive plot holes that never seem to make any sense what so ever.  The Dark Knight has some blaring ones as well but yet, that's why it didn't win best picture.  My biggest issue with the 3rd installment is that you make a Batman Movie to end all Batman movies so to speak and it is almost 3 hours long and, spoiler alert, Batman's barely in it for 10 minutes...  They destroy Gotham City and Bruce Wayne has a broken spine that gets ""Punched Back into place"" and has some mystery leg issue in the beginning of the movie that amazingly goes away mid way through the movie and he is trapped in a hole in what I guess is supposed to be either Afghanistan or South America, they never really establish that, he climbs out and then is hundreds of miles from anything, with no money, no Alfred, and no way to communicate with anyone, and he has to get back to Gotham in under 12 hours before the city blows up, and he does, and has time to light a GIANT gasoline Bat Symbol, oh yeah the city that the Army and Navy Seals, and Marines, can't even get into, write a will and leave items to people who he would have had no clue what they were doing in the first place being in a hole for 3 months, and frees all the cops who have had the ENTIRE POLICE FORCE OF GOTHAM, trapped underground for a month with little to no food or water and they come out ready to fight without facial hair and clothes in fine shape...not to mention he gives access to his ""Clean Energy Nuclear Bomb to basically anyone and oddly to turn it on or remove it from it's top secret holding area without BATMAN needing to be there to enter the final access code, the guy who created a sonar system to spy on the entire city??  I could go on for far to long on this but it's not worth it because I know as well as anyone who reads this that though I was so disappointed with The Dark Knight Rises, where Batman abandons protecting Gotham for 8 years and then after defeats the bad guy leaves Gotham in worse shape than it was before I am still going to buy it because I need to round out the trilogy and complete my set as a movie fan and a Batman fan.

5344101,5,B009JBWOU0,"We are in a golden age of comic book movies right now. No movies show that as perfectly as Christopher Nolan's ""Dark Knight Trilogy"" -- three movies that explore the formative years of the legendary superhero Batman, from the beginning of his crusade for justice to the explosive climax. Even people who aren't into capes and tights can appreciate this story.

""Batman Begins"": After his parents' murderer is paroled, young bazillionaire Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) vanishes on an aimless journey across the world. He's taken under the wing of the mysterious Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson), who offers to train him to be a member of the League of Shadows. But then Bruce learns that the League plans to annihilate Gotham, his home city.

Gotham has become rotten to the core with mobs, crooked cops and a fear-inducing shrink. Using the company's discarded prototypes, Bruce fashions an armored bodysuit and tanklike vehicle, and uses them to fight crime wherever he finds it. But the League still has plans to destroy Gotham, and the only one who can stop them is Batman.

""The Dark Knight"" is feeling pretty good about his battle against crime, especially since the new DA Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) is a morally-upright good-guy. But Batman isn't prepared for the Joker (Heath Ledger) a mad clownish psychopath who has hired himself out to the mob to destroy their worst enemy, the Dark Knight. Even worse, he has the ultimate way of blackmailing Batman into doing what he wants: holding all of Gotham hostage.

""The Dark Knight rises picks up eight years later -- crime is almost gone, Batman has vanished, and Bruce Wayne is a recluse. But then a terrifying masked man named Bane arrives in Gotham, attacking Batman as revenge for the League's destruction. He will turn Gotham into a living nightmare, unless the Dark Knight can rise again...

Most directors would have given these movie a distinctly comic-book, slick pop-culture feel. But no matter how hard you search, there's not a single hint in ""The Dark Knight Trilogy"" that anything kitschy or campy came before it, or that it was originally a comic book. Instead Christopher Nolan creates a movie as dark, tightly-wound and intense as Batman himself.

But since this is a comic-book movie, Nolan peppers them with kinetic action, high-speed chases and massive explosions. The dialogue is drizzled with dry humor (""That isn't exactly what I had in mind when I said I wanted to inspire people"","" Batman says, looking at a bunch of impersonators), mostly to temper the overhanging sense of horror and apprehension.

The most striking part of these movies is Nolan's delving into morality, and the darker side of human nature. He heaps more tragedy and trauma on Batman than just his parents' death, and delicately traces the moral boundaries -- or lack of them -- between Batman and his foes.

Christian Bale is simply brilliant as Bruce Wayne/Batman -- sure, his growly voice can get a bit silly at times, but he perfectly conveys the strength, pain and determination of a man who will sacrifice everything to save others. Michael Caine is awesome as his faithful butler/father figure, and there are solid backing performances by Morgan Freeman and Gary Oldman.

And the performances of the villain actors are absolutely brilliant. Everybody knows of the late Heath Ledger's spellbindingly chilling performance as the Joker, a casually corrosive creature who believes himself to be the yin to Batman's yang. But Tom Hardy and Liam Neeson are also brilliant as cunning, clever people who are determined to destroy Gotham.

The biggest problem is that Nolan isn't very good at casting women. Maggie Gyllenhaal and the pouty Katie Holmes are both hideously miscast as the cruel, manipulative Rachel Dawes, who treats Bruce's heart like a toy. Anne Hathaway is the best of the bunch -- a pretty baffling choice as Catwoman, but she does a decent job.

""The Dark Knight Trilogy"" contains some of the best superhero movies ever made -- a dark, gritty, richly-imagined tale of one man's quest against chaos and evil.",1350518400,31,4069,4.9779086892488955

And it's DIRT CHEAP for people who A: don't already have the other films on Blu and will want DARK KNIGHT RISES when it comes out (because this is Day and Date release!), and B: Someone who wants to give someone a really awesome gift for the holidays without spending too much.

This giftset is something of a small miracle, and if it does come, as rumoured, with all of the special features for this price? This is a no-brainer. Even if it DIDN'T come with all the special features, it's a no-brainer. It's the best possible picture and sound for the best film trilogy of all time for $30. I won't be buying it for myself, because I want the DKR Gift Set, but I'm looking to buy it for other people. Sometimes when films come packaged like this, you end up getting some issues with loss of sound, but since the other films are so inexpensive to buy on Blu, I don't think it's a stretch to think that this will still come with the same quality that Warner Bros have put on the other discs.

Like I stated, it's a no-brainer. Best trilogy at the best price and released same day and date as the release of DARK KNIGHT RISES!!!",1349740800,7,1941,4.341597796143251
5344107,5,B009JBWOU0,"Loved all three films. They had a perfect story, perfect acting, the Joker was by far the best thing of this trilogy. The Dark Knight Rises was better then most people give it credit for. I just wished they would have mentioned the joker like they did in TDKR novel form. Already preordered.",1349740800,3,291,4.509433962264151
5344108,5,B009JBWOU0,"I know people are boohooing because this isn't the ""Super Amazing, Ultimate, Christian-Bale-lives-inside-of-the-boxed-set"" 2013 version of the Trilogy.  But for someone like myself who has a moderate movie collection, this is the perfect deal for the perfect price. I am not a big ""new-release movie purchaser"" to begin with (I wait 1-2 years until the movies are dropped to under $10). So for me, having all three on Blu-ray for $30 is just fine. We don't own any of these yet, so I'm happy for this great deal!",1349740800,13,512,4.818181818181818
5344109,5,B009JBWOU0," Just a Heads-Up, Amazon has merged reviews for The Dark Knight Trilogy, and the Dark Knight Trilogy Ultimate Collector's Edition (UCE). This is a review for just the Dark Knight Trilogy. I also have a review for the UCE which can also be found here: http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SINGTZGPMNK1/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DUCXFUC&linkCode=&nodeID=&tag=
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Disregard all the naysayers claiming this is a money grab. No, it's called having a choice. Not everyone wants the Super Duper Ultra Rare Limited Collector's Edition, that's often filled with a bunch of useless physical items. Some people just want to have the trilogy and nothing more. For $30 (currently), you get just that, and even a little bit more.

You get the following in the Blu-ray edition:

Disc 1: Batman Begins Feature Film
Disc 2: The Dark Knight Feature Film
Disc 3: The Dark Knight Special Features
Disc 4: The Dark Knight Rises Feature Film
Disc 5: The Dark Knight Rises Special Features

PLUS you get a 64 Page excerpted (i.e. shortened) version of the wonderful book: ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Art-and-Making-of-The-Dark-Knight-Trilogy/dp/1419703692/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Art and Making of The Dark Knight Trilogy</a>""

That is tremendous bang for your buck! Not only with the movies, but there are hours and hours of special features included too, including a documentary about the Batmobile. The Ultimate Collector's Edition, which won't be released for another year will no doubt cost at least twice as much. The only thing I have a problem with here is the cover art. It just doesn't look anything like  Nolan's Batman.

The DVD version of the Trilogy is a 3-disc set and lacks many of the extras found in the Blu-ray set, but it does look nicer. It has a lenticular cover featuring the Batman sign from all 3 movies. It looks really cool compared to the cover used for the Blu-ray edition.

All in all, this is a wonderful set to get if you don't own any of the movies yet. Heck, even if you do, it's still a great value if you just want The Dark Knight Rises. Consider TDKR sells for around $20-25, for just a few bucks more you get the 2 preceding films, and a book. You really can't go wrong here!

Here is a list of the Special Features that included. The list may not be all-inclusive. The set has no exclusive features, but rather, the same ones that come with the individual releases
