8638055,5,B00I0GYRGO,"Since this is part two of the video collection of the rail lines of the Bakersfield area, here is an encore of the review.
I lived in the Bakersfield metro area for three years, near on of the main rail lines. This was a good reminder of the times I spent watching the trains, either from home, at the Amtrak stations (both old and new) and while shopping on Antique Row (now torn down) across from the rail yard in east Bakersfield. For me, it was a nice piece of nostalgia to add to mementos of where I've lived.
Technically this isn't an encore in the true sense of the word, but rather a continuation, but that's a minor quibble.",1398643200,,633,4.283333333333333
