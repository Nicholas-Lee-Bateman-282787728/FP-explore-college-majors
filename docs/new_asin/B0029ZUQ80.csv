3883107,4,B0029ZUQ80,"This is a great set, but there are a few games I wish they'd included...

Giants vs. Dallas, week 16, 1981 - OT victory for the Giants to clinch their first playoff spot in 18 years

Giants vs. Washington, week 9, 1984  - crushing 37-13 win over the 'Skins, and also the game where the Gatorade Bath was born

Giants vs. 49ers, Wild Card playoff, 1985 - first Giants home playoff game since 1962, great 17-3 win

Giants vs. 49ers, week 11, 1986 - comeback from 17-0 down at halftime on Monday Night.

Giants vs. Vikings, week 12, 1986 - Bobby Johnson's catch on 4th and 17 to save the game

Giants vs. Broncos, week 13, 1986 - Super Bowl preview, great game that went down to the final play, George Martin's epic fumble return for a TD

Giants vs. 49ers, week 12, 1990 - yeah, it was a loss, but it was one of the most intense Monday Night games ever played.

Giants vs. Broncos, week 14, 1998 - Giants hand 13-0 Denver their first loss in a great, tight game

Giants vs. Redskins, week 16, 2006 - Tiki Barber rushes for over 200 yards to clinch a playoff spot.",1251244800,5,1061,4.233830845771144

This set, coupled with the Road to Superbowl 42 (which I already have), would give me the complete games of all the Giant SB victories along with all playoff games that got them there. No other NFL fan can say that on their team collections!!! I especially cannot wait to see the three games from 1986.  The 1986 New York Giants are still my favorite team and I am hopeful the NFL will still someday release all or most of the regular season games from 1986 (like they did for the 1985 Bears). Phil Simms, my favorite ny Giant quarterback, was outstanding in these 1986  playoff games, especially his near perfect performance in SB 21. I don't believe his 88% completion percentage that day will ever be beat. Also, I have wanted to see the complete airings of both the 1986 and 1990 NFC Championship Games, again, for a long time now.  I will finally get my wish!!! This collection, in which many of the selected games will feature the great Pat Summerall and John Madden as commentators, is a must for every True Blue fan.",1246665600,11,1158,4.427230046948357

Obviously, the Super Bowl wins need to be included in this set.  We also get the 3 NFC Championship games that aren't included in other sets (the 2007 win over the Packers is in the Road to Super Bowl 42 set).

Now owning this 10 dvd set (incredible quality considering the technology at the time of airing). Thank you so very much for making this happen.

3883123,5,B0029ZUQ80,"If you are a real fanatic, you need to own most of these games. However, the set is lacking the 2007 playoff games and 2011 Run. I believe they are sold as seperate sets. But the 1986, 1990, 2000 Postseason runs are all included. 1986 is dominant, but you have to see the destruction of the dynasty 49ers to believe it. Watching old games on DVD in general, usually, its important to fast forward the slow spots to get to the action, after you've heard enough context from the announcers in the 1st quarter. The 1986 team was a study in absolute dominance.  In the tightly contested 1990 and 2007 runs, the drama of the moment makes you want to fast forward less, take in the moment, watch the player reactions, instant replays.  5 of those games have to be regarded as the greatest Giant games of the color TV era. I've watched them numerous times, the brutal hard hitting 1990 Championship Game against 49ers alone is worth the cost of the set.
  Right now, Giant fans are in one of those slumps....Thats when its time to break out these games. We have a great legacy of 4 Superbowl, 5 NFC championships. We have the two most improbable, dramatic Superbowl runs ever in 1990 and 2007 with 5 close dramatic games, of historic upsets, against teams all expected to win it all, yet are crushed, at home, by Big Blue. The only thing lacking in those playoff games at least, is that you cant turn the volume up and cheer along...there's , dead silence during our triumphs, the noise of those January playoff games at least was all in the NY metro area, stunned silence in san Fran 1990,2011, Dallas and Greenbay 2007, 2011. Dallas, Washington, san Fran, Greenbay, New England, we got the best out of all those rivalries . Thats probably why I don't hate any teams really.",1391212800,,1768,4.515625
3883124,4,B0029ZUQ80,I'm not even Giants fan but any die hard NFL fan needs this set because of the history these games represent. They sould be called Giant killers--this set has the game that kept 49ers from being only team to 3-peat as well as the game that kept the '72 Dolphins happy (beating 16-0 Patriots).

3883128,4,B0029ZUQ80,"I have watched all 10 games and I thought over all it was great. I get the order of the games 2 playoff games and a Superbowl in 1987 (3), 2 playoff games and a superbowl in 1991 (6), 2 playoff games in 2001 (8), Superbowl 2008 (9) and finally Eli Mannings Greatest come back game in 2006? Theres no way that Eli Mannings greatest comeback O.T. win against the Philadelphia Eagles was better than the O.T. win against Greenbay Packers Game in 2008. I even think the Giants beating the Dallas Cowboys in the divisional playoffs in 2008 was better than 2006 Eagles game.
  I still suggest buying these DVD's and maybe some day updating them with the 2008 playoff games of Dallas and Greenbay, then include 2012 playoff games of Atlanta, Greenbay and Sanfrancisco and Finally add the 2012 Superbowl win over the Patriots.

3883132,4,B0029ZUQ80,"This is a great collection overall. Any big Giants fan should have it, definitely worth the money. Lots of enjoyable action & strolls down memory lane. However, at the risk of nitpicking, I feel I should point out some slight flaws in this boxset, in my opinion. First & foremost, as a couple of folks already pointed out, a good chunk of the 3rd quarter of the 1990 Bears divisional playoff game is missing. A completely terrific Giants TD drive that ended with a Jeff Hostetler scramble for a TD is nowhere to be found. Inexcusable in my view. I realize the disclaimers that are present about possible missing action, but that's a biggie. I wonder how hard they tried to remedy that when putting this together; doesn't seem like much. To a much lesser extent is the choice of games. People can disagree about them, I understand and some of these have already been mentioned also. I definitely don't get the 2006 regular season game at the Eagles being on there. 2nd game of a season that ended up 8-8 with a wildcard game loss doesn't qualify as a ""greatest game"" to me, nice exciting comeback or not. I was very disappointed that they didn't put the 1981 regular season finale vs. Dallas, an OT game that ended up getting the Giants into the playoffs for the first time in 18 years, now that was exciting! (Admittedly, maybe there isn't a great tape of that around for this, I don't know). However, the 1998 game vs. the 13-0 Broncos should've made it then. Or another playoff win ('81 vs. Philly, '85 vs. the 49ers?). But these are relatively minor complaints to the overall set. To repeat myself, this is a great collection for Giants fans. I hope they come out with something additional in the future (Giants-Cowboys games, for example).",1323302400,3,1743,4.607717041800643
3883133,5,B0029ZUQ80,"Wow loved this dvd box set almost every giant game I wanted is on here, from there three super bowl wins to there nfc championship games wins.

I wish other nfl teams had box sets like this one instead of just there super bowl wins, like the raiders, broncos, 49ers, steelers, etc.",1307318400,,447,4.209302325581396

3883135,4,B0029ZUQ80,"I've been a Giants fan for 50 years. That being said, I can't really complain about most of this set, however it would have been nice to have a game from both the Y.A. Tittle era and the Fran Tarkenton era. Perhaps nothing survives, but the Giants during Fran's time were a 7-7 team, but they sure were exciting. It would have been nice to have seen Tittle's game against the Redskins where he threw about a billion td passes. All in all a good set though.

A huge chunk (about five minutes) of the game is missing from the third quarter. I wouldn't mind so much except that among the missing action is the Giants touchdown that put them up 24-3. Why is this? Is this the same with every set or is mine the only one?

It doesn't affect the DVD's or the enjoyment from watching them, but it concerns me because I would like to keep the DVD's in good shape over the years.  I have a TINY bit of a complaint about the games chosen, but I think coming out with a ""Best of Part II"" would fix that.

3883147,5,B0029ZUQ80,"This was one of the best of the Greatest Games series. Not only does it have the Giants three super bowl wins, it has the NFC Championship games that got them there. One of the greatest games was the 1990 NFC Championship Game between the Giants and the 49ers. Though this was a low scoring game, it was the game that effectively ended Joe Montana's career as a 49er. He would suffer an injury that would sideline him throughout the entire 1991 season and most of the 1992 season. He would lose his starting job to Steve Young and eventually end his career with the Kansas City Chiefs. Ironically Steve DeBerg would lose his starting position to Montana for the second time. The first time it happened was in 1981 in San Francisco and then again in 1993 in Kansas City.
  The first two times the Giants went to the Super Bowl they had to get past Joe Montana's 49ers. And this set has those great games.",1260835200,2,903,4.401197604790419

The features, commentary etc. would've been a 1,000% improvement over the DVD version in my humble opinion.",1255478400,,381,4.9375
3883149,5,B0029ZUQ80,Great DVD production ... took care of what I was going to do to copy my VHS tapes to DVD and edit out the commercials... well worth the price and .... great to relive these top 10 games.  Go G-Men,1253577600,,196,3.9
3883150,4,B0029ZUQ80,"Let me start by saying that I've only watched the six games from 1986 and 1990 so far. I will come back to update the review as I get farther into the set.

To clear up one thing right off the bat, the case itself states it's 1000 minutes for all 10 games, so that's an average of under 2 hours per game.  Cut out from the footage is the usual stuff... there is no pregame, halftime, or postgame.  There are also some edited huddles, but the majority of time edited out are where the commercial breaks used to be as well as change of possessions.  The edits are pretty seemless, and it appears that what they cut out wasn't all that significant because they also show plenty of footage in between plays (Madden and Summerall analysis, replays, etc).

The advantage to owning this set is that the video quality of these games from '86 are MUCH better than my VHS tapes or even DVDs that can be found in trading circles.  So I'll watch these when I get a sudden craving for watching one particular game, and I'll use the original airing DVDs when I'm looking for the full experience (like if I'm watching the full season from start to finish, or when I want to see the games as well as other footage as a reminder to what everyone was saying about the teams as the playoffs progressed).

Now for the packaging... it's both good and bad.  It's great that they've managed to get 10 discs into such a small box.  The package is the same size as many double disc movies.  On the bad side, and it's really bad, is that the hubs that hold the discs in place are so tough and inflexible that you have to bend the disc severely in order to get it out of the case.  And since there are two discs on each ""page"", you end up bending two discs at the same time.  I've certainly seen this before with movies I've purchased, and I just wish that the companies releasing these things would get a clue in that regard.

I'll be back as I watch more of the set...

Added:

1990 Divisional Playoff vs Bears:  I only noticed one edited huddle and it must have been where an in-game ad was, because everywhere else you hear Madden and Summerall between plays.  There is also one part where the video goes haywire for a couple of seconds, but it's where Mark Collins is being carted off the fields and not during any game play.

1990 Championship Game vs 49ers: My only wish for this one is that they included CBS's opening intro to the game.  Everything else was great about this disc as I recall it.  If there were any flaws I doubt you'd notice as you're brought back in time to one of the most intense and physical games you'll ever see. Not until the 2008 Steelers/Ravens playoff game did I see one that's on par with 1990 Giants/49ers.  Even Jerry Rice laid somebody out!

Super Bowl XXV - The video quality is excellent but you will hear some disturbances in the sound a few times (at least if you have a surround sound system... not sure if you watch it through your TV speakers).  It sounds like it cuts in and out in one or two of the speakers.  There are also more edited huddles than I've seen in the first 5 discs, but it appears that all the game action is here.

2000 Divisional Playoff vs Eagles
2000 Championship Game vs Vikings
- Great to have these games in stereo sound in the event you have VHS recordings in mono.  The video quality is nice and clear but there are times in the Eagles game where the color of the grass, etc will get darker or lighter.  It's just a minor annoyance.  I wonder if there was something going on technically with the recording and/or broadcast of these games in 2000 because I've seen a couple of different VHS recordings of both of these games, and the color looked really off in a couple of them.  I always assumed it was the VHS tape itself, until I saw the Eagles game in this boxset.

2006 Week 2 vs Eagles - Good video quality and sound, but disappointing that they put the standard 4:3 picture on here instead of widescreen from the HD feed.  You really miss it when they show a replay of a sack and you can't even see the actual sack in the replay because it's off to the far side of the widescreen broadcast but of course the sides of the picture are chopped off.

Super Bowl XLII - Good video and sound quality, has a little bit of pregame but not much.  This is the exact same version in the Road to Super Bowl XLII boxset, but without the Michael Strahan commentary track.  Because of that, it would have been nice if they had left this one out and included a different game... perhaps L.T.'s dominant performance against the Saints in '88, playing with one arm and with a playoff berth hanging in the balance.

That having been said, my overall recommendation is still a buy on this boxset.",1251763200,18,4729,4.305084745762712
