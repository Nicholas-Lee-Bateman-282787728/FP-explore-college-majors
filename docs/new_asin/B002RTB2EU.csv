8378893,5,B002RTB2EU,"I had seen this VHS many years ago as I was leaving a movie rental store.  Being in a hurry, I had just glanced at it - it had hardly registered.  Later, I began thinking about it, and thought I would rent it.  I hurried back to the store.  It was out. I checked again and was told it had ""disappeared.""  Darn!  A couple of years ago, I spotted a copy (VHS) in a thrift store and grabbed it up.  I think it was $1.99.  The box and tape was in excellent shape.  I played it and was delighted by it.  The title character was played by Eric Weitz, a name I did not know.  I found I could put it on DVD and did so.  It made a pristine disc.  I was so pleased, as I think I the disc will last much longer than the VHS tape.  Weitz reminded me of a young Joel Grey, very talented and a great personality for this show. I highly recommend it.
