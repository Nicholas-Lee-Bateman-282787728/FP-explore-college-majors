Realizing that his chances of becoming a movie star are increasingly slim, aspiring actor Ross Vegas (Ross Patterson) turns his focus to bowling, and before long he's anointed as the PBA's newest rising star. Tommy Reid directs this quirky, low-budget comedy that also stars Tara Reid as Ross's girlfriend, Lindsay, Clayne Crawford as his wisecracking best friend, Mike, and Vinnie Jones (Snatch) as bowling tour bad boy Roddy.

Now me, I have never ""bowled"" you see, but after watching this film I went ""bowling"" for the first time in my life.  I took my step-daughter, we shared a glass of beer, ""bowled"", then ran away together to Barbados.  It was all thanks to this film. Ross Patterson and Clayne Crawford were amazing together.  All I can say is thank you for this film.",1284681600,,455,4.54320987654321
3830685,3,B0020SPL18,"Did not have any expectations and I was actually more surprised by the supporting roles and cameos than anything else.

We have a rags to riches story via the pro bowling circuit as told by a tightly knit threesome of friends out of LA. The strongest point of this whole film would be the friendship between the leads, but the writing tanked even that strength later. Tara Reid plays the love interest, and sadly enough, people would cringe every time she was on the screen (not believable and not funny). It is corny throughout, but you can tell most people were giving it a solid try.

Vinnie Jones has a one scene appearance playing his over-the-top psycho bowler. Ray Wise (showcased way better in the Reaper series) has a few fatherly scenes, the Revenge of the Nerds Carradine has a brief but twisted role, and a few sets of gratuitous fake boobs make their appearances. Yes, this is the film Tara Reid's brother directs (ripe with plenty of dope) starring the Big P from Sopranos, the infamous Rachel Hunter and the always busy Robyn Lively.

The DVD picture and sound quality are fine, the supplemental five minute feature is more like a bad music video and the cover art has nothing to do with the film (nor is she in it). Not a recommendation but gave it the few stars for the few stars in it.",1244592000,7,1303,4.512711864406779

8348683,3,B0020SPL18,"This movie is written by Ross Patterson, but it is before he started directing and producing his own movies so it does lack that Ross Patterson feel, other than that, I enjoyed the movie. Strike follows a wannabe actor who bowls for fun and is actually quite good. When his acting career goes nowhere he decides to join the PBA tour and use his acting skills to create the character Ross Vega$. The movie flows quite well, and it has a few laughs here and there. I guess you could say this is sort of a romantic comedy? Any Ross Patterson fan should pick this up just to see where he started making his own movies.",1430092800,3,614,4.301724137931035

8348686,4,B0020SPL18,"Some movies are not meant for the viewer to take too seriously. Some actors, who can be so, so co-o-o-ol know this and just roll with the punches and end up being, along with the film itself, very endearing. Trey Parker is such an actor, better known (as in ""Orgazmo"", among other movies and TV productions) than Ross Patterson, who plays the starring role in ""Strike: Balls of Glory"" (the edition viewed being Videoville Showtime, a.k.a. V.V.S. Films, cat. no. 1306). Both, as young men, at any rate, are nice-looking guys, even physically resembling each other to some extent, who rather just miss attaining the standard handsome-devil Hollywood male star look, but who still present a good image on the screen and who are loaded with comic skills and screwball charisma. Underlying all the antics, Ross Patterson, like Trey Parker also, can portray a character who is wonderfully human and sympathetic.

Trey Parker has targeted a part of his fun-making to do comic turns, as actor, screenwriter, producer, and/or director, on stage and in motion pictures, among other subjects of mirth, at Mormons and their missionaries. In ""Strike"", Ross Patterson, for his part, plays a L.A. slacker who has had aspirations (going nowhere) of being a film actor. Needless to say, he keeps hunger and destitution from his door by doing the usual slacker jo-jo jobs, like flogging mediocre pizza, making, selling, and fancifully delivering it.

What Ross Patterson REALLY excels at doing supremely well is his sports hobby, bowling! Really fantastically good bowling, that is to say (and no less than that), at local bowling allies is what he does with his best buddy, just for fun, after work hours and on weekends. Then he meets up with some professional bowling promoters who lure him into playing that sport, very quickly rising to ""pro"" status, on the professional bowling circuit in a big-time way that most of us hardly are aware exists.

Needless to say, when Ross realises just what his preferred game can pay him, he (with some persuasion from his girl friend and best friend and from the ""pros"" themselves) quickly rises to Bowling Glory, becoming the biggest star of ""bowling TV"" (and whoever would think that an all-bowling channel even would exist?). He affects some goofy mannerisms and dress, as ""Ross Vegas"" (his ""nom-de-quilles"", as it were), his girl becoming ""Li'l Reno"" (covering in their aliases, thus, both of Nevada's two major glitzy gambling shangri-las), with his best friend still tagging along as his agent (till another more powerful one takes over managing Ross' career completely but heartlessly). Ross Vegas' affected mannerisms draw all the more attention to what he achieves on the alleys' lanes.

Alas, success comes at the price (1) of a swelling ego and (2) of his personal life, until Ross suddenly comes to himself, drops out of the sports celebrity world, and he reclaims girlfriend and buddy alike. Having amassed so much wealth, Ross now can do what he pleases. What he likes is to help his girl and his friend to achieve their own goals and dreams. Very sweet. Touching, in fact (really meaning that, too!).

The film is low budget and none-too-polished, but in this kind of high camp, good vibes production, that just really is not so important. The film delivers a lot more in good times entertainment than its budget would seem to have promised. This is not flashy or sophisticated motion picture art, but ""Strike"" is a lot of fun to watch and very endearing.  This is one charming little cheapie which, especially in the rowdy company of some friends, merits and compels watching many times over.",1405814400,,3632,4.945901639344262
8348687,1,B0020SPL18,"Plot.
A loser kid and his friend seem like they have no future, until one of them is spotted by a bowling scout and tells him to go pro. They come up with an idea to be a bowler who is a character and try to make pro bowling popular by turning it into bowlers dressing like they are in the WWE. Along the way he discovers fame and fortune is not as important as the typical things you think, and you can probably work out from here already how the movie ends.

Review.
What a mess of a film. Fist off you think it's going to be a stoner comedy, but all it has is stupid lines and smoke blowing around for a payoff of dumb pizza deliveries. Yeah, you read that right. Then it goes onto a story of friends wanting to become rich, while someone flirts around with the main character like she wants to break up him and his girl because she holds the power to his pro career. Only that scenario just gets forgotten about as it quickly spits out to his success and becoming a celebrity of the game. Why bother doing something that looks like it might be a plot point or something that is key to his relationship, only to cut to later as a celebrity without even a decent montage scene to give you the feeling he has become a success? It's rushed, and you just do not care about this character named Ros Vegas.

The next stupid thing about the film is Ros Vegas has the idea to become a character in the league by acting as a Las Vegas 70's disco queen, with his girlfriend as a side character called Little Reno played by Tara Reid, who looks like an ugly Hentai girl with a pink wig and glitter on her face. 1, it was not sexy, and 2, since when do pro tournaments allow other people other than the players to be ... what's the word for bowling for court-side? Alley-side? Not to mention it seems like just about everyone who plays bowling is a character of their own already. Just to clarify what I mean, none of them seem to be normal looking bowling people! They each have costumes, unique looks and personalities... is this what it would be like if the WWE started their own bowling league? The character of Ross Vegas doesn't even seem to be the coolest one of the lot, he just wears a wig, dresses like a 70's disco ... do you know who John Morrison is? If you do, it's pretty much him as a bowler instead of wrestler. Man, if WWE started a bowling league like this, it would be as successful as the XFL.

Getting back to rushing things along, it goes from his first two bowling games, to endorsements and suddenly he is a multimillionaire with a mansion? I won't go on more about the main character, and his lover, and their friend... lets go onto how bad the supporting cast is. His arch rival is a boring dweeb who says nothing funny, but you can clearly tell it was supposed to be. A loser character that didn't work and came off as a real loser rather than a funny loser. The commentator of the game is a loud mouth, arrogant idiot who is just annoying rather than comedic, and anyone else who did a decent job of acting was only on screen for a few seconds.

Very minimal laughs, rushed, or, edited/produced/directed wrong on how to tell a story of rags to riches, and a predictable ending that makes you roll your eyes at it trying to be all real and emotional. I bet anyone watching it was most likely thinking the same thing as me... I don't care about your dumb character enough to give a rats behind what you learned about yourself in the end. The cheap attempts at stereotype laughs are the joke themselves if the people who thought it up thought it would be funny to see... I mean, come on, a Mr Miyagi looking old guy as the coach of a Asian kung-fu bowler? Gimmie a break.

This movie tried too hard to be more than what it is. A horrible attempt at being a stoner comedy that no matter how high a stoner can get, even they wouldn't laugh. Then onto the worst rush job of scenes of someone going from a nobody to a superstar. The rush job of this editing I have not seen so badly since ""No Retreat, No Surrender"". Finally then the happily ever after heartwarming attempt for a finish? Not to mention the cover makes you think this is probably going to be some cheesy gratuitous nudity filled film like Porky's or Screwballs, but even the ugly fake ones they show in the movie are not worth seeing, and when they are, for some reason, the film seems PG rated. So even that doesn't help the film. Probably because Porky's and Screwballs wasn't about the naked chicks, it had a plot, a story, character development and it was actually funny. All the things missing from this film.

If you cut out the useless nudity and drug scenes, maybe a few words here and there, this would just be a bad PG rated flick that even under 13 year olds would say was pretty lame for a story about trying to make bowling cool while not actually doing anything cool to achieve it. Basically, it lives in it's own little fantasy scenario if it thinks the story is believable, and you would have to be real gullible to go along with it.

Somehow I watched it from start to finish, so it can't be a 1 star vote if I didn't turn it off. However, the lame attempt at extra scenes and outtakes during the end credits doesn't want me to even give it 2 stars. Not even 1 and a half, more just 1.2 stars.",1386720000,,5289,4.2358771060455895
