7753529,4,B01G24WKRI,"Review-Meet Francesca, 15 years ago she disappeared. She is the daughter of Vittorio Visconti, who so happens to be a renowned storyteller. There is a psychopath on the loose who seems to be inspired by the works of Dante. The intentions seem to be cleaning the city of the trash and damage. There are two police detectives on the case named Moretti and Succo. These  Dante-esque crimes are happening and the question is, could this be the work of Francesca? This film wants to be a  giallo film, but this has far more gore than I expected it to have. This film visually is beautiful to admire. The art direction and background sets are breathtakingly intoxicating. You can tell a lot of thought was put into, making this film appealing. I quite enjoyed this film for the simple reason, it delivered on the premise of scaring me. This film really delivers on the acting and suspense. This film has this tense pace, that keeps you anticipating what can happen next. I found myself at times, yelling at the screen, becoming too much in a hurry to want to see the mental puzzle I created solved.

This film has a sense of direction, in the form that it just stays the course and wants the viewer to follow along. They give you just enough depth, to really grasp the heart of this story. The slasher element of this film was done to perfection. You really get the sense that this film wanted to cross the two genres but yet respect both. The soundtrack to this film was also another home run. This film seemed to me, that someone really paid close attention to detail and wanted to get everything right. The last half hour of this film is something to really appreciate. As great as this film was, it all felt so much better once we got to the end. This film has given me a reason to check under my bed at night, and sleep with the light on. Talk about a missed opportunity. This film should have had a theater run. I feel it would have taken the smoke out of the veins of the Hollywood horror. This film is smart, genius and very intense. This film does not try to scare you, it scares you without trying. From first frame to last, this film should be talked about in the upcoming years like we discussed Amer. If you are a fan of a horror film delivering on its genre, this film is going to scare the hell out of you. What a creatively fun time this film provided me. This is a must watch and a must own if there was any. Unearthed Films, have hit a grand slam with this film.",1475884800,6,2474,4.327586206896552

8762038,2,B01G24WKRI,"I'm on here merely to balance the rating for this release as some other reviewers seem much more spellbound by this film than I was.  I've been a giallo fan for a long time, collecting and watching everything from official, well-known releases to bootlegs of rare titles over the years.  The score for this film is quite good - you could play it for any fan of Italian 60s/70s horror and have them believing they're listening to a score from that era.  Unearthed Films have admittedly put a lot of love into this release and were wise to include a CD of the score.  Unfortunately, that's where most of my praise stops.  The movie was (obviously) shot digitally and later heavily manipulated to try and create a grindhouse theater experience.  The problem is that the aggressive digital manipulation was poorly done - overblown contrast, fake grain, specks, colors leaning too yellow or red - it works only sporadically but more often just looks like a distracting, overly processed digital image.  If the film was intentionally tongue in cheek, it likely would have bothered me less, but the filmmakers were clearly trying to replicate watching an old, damaged print of a lost film here.  The filmmakers did an okay job of recreating the sometimes nonsensical, bizarre story elements and characters found in giallos, but nothing was particularly memorable.  When you've seen a lot of giallos, you've likely come across some very cheaply made and/or dull throwaways.  While ""Francesca"" does feature some gloved-killer murder sequences, they're awkwardly choreographed with unconvincing special effects.  Again, if the intent was to mimic a forgettable, cheap giallo, I suppose there was some minor success here, but for me, if you're going for mimicry you should at least show some occasional ambition instead just covering everything up in overly processed video and hoping a good score sells it.  The package is put together much better than the average horror Blu-ray released today, and that soundtrack is a bonus, but unless you're a giallo completist, there unfortunately isn't much here worth revisiting.",1500940800,,2110,5.101744186046512
8762039,4,B01G24WKRI,"Another in the micro genre of ""neo giallo"" films, paying homage to the (mostly) Italian films of the late 60's-mid 70's that featured wild sets and costumes, gloved killers, incoherent plots and painfully inept police investigators. This one does it as well as any so far, certainly fun for fans of the genre as familiar shots, themes and set pieces (J&B, anyone?) are seen throughout. Nice twist ending. Some serious gore if that makes or breaks it for you. If not already a fan of giallo this film may do nothing for you but members of the Black Glove Society should watch without hesitation.",1483574400,,594,4.721153846153846
8762040,4,B01G24WKRI,"If you ever want to see a perfect homage to Italian giallo cinema from the 1970s, it's definitely Francesca: This is a movie that isn't just done copying the style and colour charts of yesteryear, it really gets the props and sets just right, the camerawork has a vintage twang to it, the actors ""look"" as if they're from the 1970s, and so do their costumes, and even the editing isn't merely post-modern but really old-fashioned. Plus, this is a film that really understands the genre, the story's properly intertwined and full of unlikely coincidents, there are plenty of creepy accessoires serving the audience as (real and false) clues as to what might be happening, there are eerie dream sequences that might not make a lot of sense other than add to the atmosphere, and the murders are all suitably brutal. That all said, the movie's not all perfect, it just lacks any real characters to identify with (or to properly despise), but that said, rarely has a nostalgia genre movie looked and felt even half as (darkly) beautiful!",1481932800,,1032,4.770949720670391
8762041,4,B01G24WKRI,"Very interesting giallo-like film: worth checking out for fans of the genre, but maybe a little too impenetrable for those not raised on Argento and others.",1480550400,,156,5.038461538461538
8762042,5,B01G24WKRI,"""The Not Rated Unearthed Films and MVDVisual 3-Disc Blu-ray and DVD combo is 77 minutes of pure fanboy gold, presented in a widescreen 2.35:1 in a vary of purposefully pruned coloring and intended faux film stock imperfections to recreate a 1970s Italian giallo. The Italian dialogue track doesnt quite synch and, again, thats deliberate to fabricate a past ideal. My only gripe with this release is with the English subtitles as there were a few issues, including some key mistakes in spelling and with the pace of the subtitle that were way too quick. That shouldnt sway anyone from this awe-striking and gorgeous limited edition release that comes complimentary with a booklet of an in-depth review from Ultra Violent Magazines Art Ettinger. The third disc rounds out the release as the films soundtrack, scored by Luciano Onetti and his progressive rock thats a slight modernization of the synch-prog rock of this particular genres decade. Francesca comes straight out of a forgotten 40-year time capsule, looking to violate the eyes, minds, and ears of a younger generation and stimulating the nearly flatlined Italian giallo genre.""

8762043,3,B01G24WKRI,"When this film arrived at my doorstep I was pleased while looking at the box and artwork. In recent months Id begun to be exposed to more giallo films than ever and have begun enjoying an appreciation of them which I hadnt in the past, for the most part because of having less access to them. To think Id now be exposed to another made me happy. I became a tad leery when I learned it was not one of the original films but a tribute of sorts to the genre. But I plunged in headfirst anyway with some hope. Unfortunately the movie didn't live up to my hopes and expectations.

The film opens with a strange sequence involving a mother taking care of an infant and a young girl who seems to be enjoying stabbing a dead bird. Within moment we see her stabbing into the same stroller the mother was rocking and hear her mother scream. Fast forward to 15 years later.

Its been that long since the disappearance of Francesca, the young daughter of poet/dramatist Vittorio Visconti. Stabbed by her abductor he is now unable to walk and confined to a wheelchair. Visconti lives with his invalid wife who remains in a seemingly state of shock ever since the kidnapping of their daughter. Other than help they live alone.

When a series of murders in the area begins the police are baffled. Notes left at the scenes of the crime leave no clues with the exception that they are lines derived from Dantes INFERNO. Visconti was a scholar on Dante and the two police detectives turn to him for assistance in deciphering just what that murderer could be trying to tell them with these notes.

All of the trademarks from the classic giallo are there. The gloved hands of the killer. The viewpoint of the murders as seen through the killers eyes. The police investigating the murders. And yet the movie feels hollow about best and a poor substitute at worst.

Part of this is the decision of writer/director Luciano Onetti to turn this from a standard giallo into a combination of homage and experimental film. Sequences that make no sense are tossed in throughout. Characters that I either forgot or didn't recall suddenly have important roles towards the end. Clue that should have led us as viewers to a rational solving of the puzzle actually lead us nowhere down blind paths that have nothing to do with a solution or that offer clues that aren't based in reality.

The cinematography for the film felt truly lacking to me. Most of it had a strange use of color giving almost everything a blue tinge. The sharpness was also so intense that everything from beard hairs to skin pores felt like they stood out enough to take away concentration from the story itself. The gore effects were some of the worst Ive seen in what should have been a prestige styled film with blood looking more like thinned out jelly.

The acting, even though I understand it was done with a foreign cast, never felt believable to me and it wasn't due to something lost in translation. Ive seen far too many foreign films to think that this was the best there was/is to offer from actors in other countries. The death scene of one victim by steam iron strangulation has to be one of the worst death scenes ever filmed and completely unbelievable. The faceless killer felt as unthreatening as possible.

Unearthed Films has a lot of faith in this release. The box art is stunning and great to look at bringing back fond memories of the classic giallo films. It contains not just the blu-ray version of the film but standard DVD as well. It also offers a CD of the films soundtrack as well, sounding much like the classic Goblin scores from earlier giallo films. A flyer is included inside the box and extras on the disc include a behind the scenes featurette, deleted scenes, an interview with director Luciano Onetti and his producer/brother Nicolas and an Unearthed Trailer reel.

Ive read some reviews that have praised this film. Sorry to say I am not one of those. I call it as I see it. Im anxious to return to viewing the actual giallo films of the past and remain hopeful that the genre will see a rise in new movies that follow the same patterns they established. This one is filled far too much with its own agenda as opposed to being a tribute for my taste. Some may find this new take refreshing but unfortunately Im not one.",1477008000,3,4299,4.536774193548387
8762044,4,B01G24WKRI,"Italian Giallo has produced many great films and it seems to be a style of filming that many want to replicate. My recent review of Masks shows that it can be possible to reproduce the glory days of Giallo, but still offer up an original and interesting story. However, sometimes an homage goes a bit too far and the story ends up sacrificed for style. Francesca is one such film that falters in the story department but excels in the reproduction of the classic Italian Giallo. It hits the right notes in the look, the sound and the feel, but it just can't produce a solid story.

MOVIE REVIEW

Instead of the black gloved killer in typical Giallo films, Francesca looks to spice things up and give us a red gloved killer instead. The red gloved killer (who may or may not be a woman) is killing people and leaving coins on their eyes. The killer's MO relies heavily on the story of the Divine Comedy by Dante Alighieri, where the victims who have done bad deeds are going to hell, but they first must pay the ferry toll (okay, that is a very broad and terrible summary of Dante's work. I'm sorry). Each victim that has been murdered has a somewhat shady past.

An Inspector by the name of Bruno Moretti is knee-deep in the investigation, but he can't seem to catch a break. As the bodies start to pile up and the murders start looking like they have a connection with a girl named Francesca, who has been missing for 15 years, Moretti worries he may never catch the killer.

That's the general gist of Francesca, but unfortunately, things aren't as straightforward as the summary above will have you believe. The film loves to take a detour to the weird section of filming known as artsy-fartsy, which doesn't add anything to the story, but instead comes across like the director is screaming ""look at me! look at me! I can do Giallo!""

Francesca looks to capture the glory days of 1970s Italian Giallo and it certainly succeeds in capturing the look, but the story really needed some work done on it. Even as the film ended, I was still not entirely sure who exactly the killer was and why they were doing the killings.

BLU-RAY OPINION

Francesca has come out in a three-disc set from UNEARTHED FILMS and MVD Entertainment Group and it certainly looks nice. You have the included soundtrack, which is heavy on the Giallo style, the DVD and finally the Blu-ray. Judging the audio and video of the film ends up being a tall task, as it has been purposely made to look blown out, old and dubbed poorly. If that is what they wanted for a look, they certainly did a great job. I did have an issue with the subtitles being displayed a bit too early and there was one time where a spelling mistake was present.

As for the special features, they are a bit on the light side. You have some behind the scenes footage, an alternate opening, a hidden scene (it plays a bit after the end credits, so not really hidden per say), an interview with Producer Nicol&aacute;s Onetti and Director Luciano Onetti, who comes across a bit pretentious thanks to him choosing to do the entire interview wearing Ray Ban sunglasses (in fact, he shot the damn movie with sunglasses on. Um, aren't you worried about lighting issues?) Finally, we have some trailers for other films.

VERDICT

I guess the biggest compliment I can give Francesca, is when I asked my wife what year she thought this film was from, she immediately said 1970's. Of course, that isn't going to make the film a winner based on looks alone. You have to least do a better job of providing a more coherent story and then we can talk about it being a game changer. For now, the film is a style over substance, but nevertheless, it's a delicious style.",1477008000,,3699,4.4992548435171384
8762045,5,B01G24WKRI,"Modern efforts to re create the golden era of Gialli films are a mixed bag. Not so with ""Francesca"". From the soundtrack to the cinematography and the final twist, I felt like I was watching an original late 70's film. Lots of creepy and gory scenes. Highly recommended.",1475971200,,270,4.645833333333333
