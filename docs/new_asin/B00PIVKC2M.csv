6808891,3,B00PIVKC2M,"When I sat down to watch the film, I was initially surprised to see the film play on a 4:3 aspect ratio (what we've come to know as fullscreen, even though it doesn't 'fill' a 16x9 television screen), at least during the credits. Following the opening credits, the film switches to widescreen and stays that way until the ending credits, when it once again switches to 4:3. During the seventies, it was common for films to be filmed in a ratio that would allow for easy cropping into both ""fullscreen"" or ""widescreen"" to accommodate both theater screens during an age of transition. For animated films, the animated characters would normally 'float' within these margins to that, following the crop, nothing substantial would be lost, with neither ration retaining the full frame. This held true for opening credits as well, with all of the text carefully held within those same margins so as to not get lost in cropping. It was evident that a widescreen presentation of the opening and ending credits for this film would have cropped part of them out, or make them be partially cut out from the frame. Therefore, I don't believe this was a film that was meant to be seen in Widescreen, and CBS Video made the poor decision in order to avoid complaints about the film not being made to fill the new standard 16:9 screens. The widescreen parts (essentially the entire film save for the credits) look zoomed-in, with rough edges, thicker than intended, and with animated characters too often too dangerously close to the edge of the frame.

Back in the days of 4:3 televisions, black bars on the top and bottom of the screen were welcomed by savvy film viewers as they gave the impression that films were being seen in their intended theatrical aspect ratios (though not necessarily the case); why can't we have the same respect and 'admiration' for pillarboxing to accommodate older 4:3 films?",1451433600,2,1892,4.803680981595092

6808893,4,B00PIVKC2M,"In 1968, Charles Schulz did a series of ""Peanuts"" comic strips involving a mysterious girl named Lila.  Snoopy received word that she was in the hospital, and he ran off to visit her.  Charlie Brown was about to go crazy wondering who Lila was.  With Linus' help. he learned that she was Snoopy's original owner, but she had to give him back to the Daisy Hill Puppy Farm because her family lived in an apartment.

In ""Snoopy, Come Home"", this theme was greatly expanded.  Snoopy runs off to visit Lila, who is in the hospital, and he takes Woodstock with him.  Along the way, they are captured by a rather rambunctious girl who wants a pet dog and bird.  They finally escape, but not without a few funny misadventures first.  In the meantime, Charlie Brown is determined to find out who Lila is.  As in the comic strip, Linus comes to his aid and discovers that she's Snoopy's original owner.  Snoopy finally gets to see her in the hospital, and he's touched by her loneliness, so he decides to go live with her.  Of course, no fan of ""Peanuts"" could believe that Snoopy would actually leave his friends for good, but I won't give away the ending.  Snoopy also has a lot of mishaps when he tries to get into places that don't allow dogs.

I saw this movie when it first came out.  It's a good movie, but not one of my favorites in the ""Peanuts"" series.  Some of the scenes are real tearjerkers, particularly the going-away party for Snoopy.  I was only five years old when I first saw it, and I had trouble understanding why everyone was so sad.  Still, it has enough humor in it to make it worth watching.

If I may add one final bit of trivia, the series of strips on which this was based had a happier but less dramatic ending than the movie.  After Snoopy returns from visiting Lila in the hospital, Charlie Brown learns of her previous relationship with Snoopy.  A depressed Charlie Brown tells Linus, ""I bet he wishes he was still her dog instead of mine.""  Linus replies, ""I doubt it, Charlie Brown.  He wouldn't have been happy in an apartment.""  The final panel shows Snoopy sitting on top of his doghouse in his World War I regalia saying, ""Here's the World War I flying ace zooming through the air in his Sopwith Camel!""  In other words, Linus was absolutely correct!",1446681600,3,2278,4.460048426150121

8688153,5,B00PIVKC2M,"""Snoopy, Come Home"" is the most unique and entertaining Peanuts movie. Some comment negatively about the music in this film being by the Sherman brothers and not Vince Guaraldi, as usual for Peanuts films. Some comment there are too many ""tear-jerking"" moments in the film. These two things (the music and the tear-jerking moments) are actually the things that make this film stand out. The music fits the film perfectly. I cannot imagine this movie with different music. I LOVED this film as a kid and still love it today. It is not just a great ""Peanuts"" movie but a great movie.",1503360000,,581,4.705882352941177
8688154,4,B00PIVKC2M,"I've seen some complaints about the aspect ratio, so allow me to potentially clear some things up.

This movie is available on DVD in widescreen, but the widescreen version is not available on the blu-ray release.

It would appear that the actual reason for this is that the original aspect ratio (the way it was originally animated) was not widescreen. Much like with Transformers: The Movie (1986), it would seem that this was originally crafted for television but they cropped it for theatrical release.

What does this all mean? It means that although the blu-ray is not in widescreen, none of the original animation has been cut and it is being presented in its original aspect ratio. In other words, you are seeing it the way it was meant to be seen, and none of the artwork has been cut out to fit your widescreen television. You get to see everything. All as it was meant to be seen.

So yes, although it might not be ideal for some viewers, it's ultimately for the best. Hopefully this has cleared up some confusion. And yes, this release is quite nice -- it comes in a red blu-ray case (pretty rare) and if you get the slip cover, it is embossed and quite shiny. Very good release and probably worth the asking price of about $10-$15 on average.

The movie itself is unquestionably one of the best Peanuts films ever made. Thurl Ravenscroft (singer of ""You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch) provides some of his vocal talents for at least one of the songs in this movie, and the rest of them are super poppy and memorable. If you like classically animated films with wonderful music, this is a must.",1500508800,3,1602,4.548611111111111
