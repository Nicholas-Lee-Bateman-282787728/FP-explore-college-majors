8516130,5,B003WHJGZ8,This DVD is sure making me dream some more of hopes of getting my first elk! It shows a mixture of old and new footage I'm guessing are in some old Knight And Hale video vaults and I'm glad Harold and David finally decided to put the footage to good use. It's one of the best elk hunting DVDs I've seen and another great video from Knight And Hale.,1483833600,,348,4.057971014492754
