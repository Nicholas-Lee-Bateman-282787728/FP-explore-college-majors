5721460,1,B00CFK5I8M,"Best thing about this movie was looking at Christian Keyes the 10mins he was in the movie. The pacing of the film was terrible, the scenes were long and drawn out. Too many scenes of Honey in the car calling Jacque on her bluetooth, ranting and raving. The acting was sub-par and there were no real consequences to their actions. If you are trying to make a statement in a movie there has to be consequences that are heart-wrenching and thought provoking so that the audience can get the message loud and clear. Statistics at the end and clever statements or quotes at the end are not sufficient enough to arouse emotion. You have to build character in the relationships, make people care about them, sympathize, and identify with them. When you are able to do that, then hit them with the realities of bad decisions and their inevitable consequences.",1377388800,8,851,4.68
5721461,2,B00CFK5I8M,"A married couple appear to love each other and are living the good life.  But looks can definitely be deceiving...especially if you follow their daily routine.  When vows are broken, secrets are hidden, greed overrides common sense, and exes resurface, mayhem is sure to follow.

When vows are broken, your marriage is threatened, your body is not worshipped and your Good Life is on the brink of ruin...should you run, stand or beg?  A gamut of emotions are exemplified with realistic scenarios but mediocre acting and lack of emotions with a commonplace plot solidified this a fail for me.",1377388800,,591,4.9393939393939394
5721462,2,B00CFK5I8M,"I didn't like this movie at all, too predictable...., it was a B rated movie that I'll put in the archives not to watch again...",1376524800,,128,4.16
5721463,3,B00CFK5I8M,"I am a big supporter of black film and this one is not bad at all. There was some acting that could have been stepped up a bit, but other than that it was okay.",1376179200,2,160,3.6
5721464,4,B00CFK5I8M,"I always look forward to any film featuring Mr Keyes. I found this movie very relative to life. I think it happens to marriages more often than you think. This film will remind couples what their relationship should be about and don't run to another because you feel something and not sharing it with your spouse. Good cast in this one, I would recommend it for a date night.",1375488000,,375,4.449275362318841
5721465,5,B00CFK5I8M,"I thought this was a very good movie. I think this movie would be excellent for a date night. It could definitely stir up some conversation between you and your mate. In this society we look at marriages as so disposable, people make mistakes in relationships but we need communication to prevent mishaps like in this movie. Great Job!",1374969600,,335,4.694915254237288
5721466,1,B00CFK5I8M,"This is one of the WORST, low budget movies I've seen in my life!! I wish I could sue the writer for making this crap!",1374883200,4,118,3.76

5721471,1,B00CFK5I8M,Stupid and very poor acting.,1409356800,,28,4.8
5721472,5,B00CFK5I8M,I enjoyed this movie. The storyline was true to life. The acting was good too. No negative stereotyping here. The situations are pervasive in every culture. That is the sweet spot with this movie.,1403827200,,196,4.794117647058823
5721473,3,B00CFK5I8M,"Based on the fact that this was based on someone's actual situation, guess saying it didn't seem realistic would be a mute point. I loved the actors/actresses but something was just off with the performances. I watched the entire thing and it makes cheating seem like no big deal and there were no real consequences shown. Karma always plays a part in deception. Taking vows is not a joke and there are some real consequences that may not reveal themselves right away. I love movies but this one didn't do it for me. It wasn't the best of movies but it wasn't worst low budgets I have watched either. I wouldnt recommend it to anyone to watch.",1402099200,,643,4.504273504273504
5721474,4,B00CFK5I8M,"A movie that revealed two-side marriage that cheating and forgiveness is possible , that sometimes the grass isn't greener on the other side so don't wait your time and take a risk but love the one you are with.",1395532800,,211,4.435897435897436
5721475,4,B00CFK5I8M,"VERY INTERESTING , BESIDES THE OPENING, WHICH COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER-(HOW THEY MET, ETC.) -VERY GOOD ACTORS AND ACTRESSES. I REALLY ENJOYED THIS MOVIE FROM START TO FINISH. DEFINITELY WORTH THE PURCHASE AND THE VIEW.",1394236800,,216,5.2
5721476,3,B00CFK5I8M,I liked the storyline but some of the scenes in the car where a bit over the top. Too much of that.  Keys is one of my favorites so I will always follow his films even when he is not always the good guy.,1394236800,,203,3.6136363636363638
5721477,3,B00CFK5I8M,"it was ok but not as good as I would like to see a mover, I would loke at it again",1393977600,,82,2.9523809523809526
5721478,1,B00CFK5I8M,The plot of this movie was horrible. I have nothing good to say about this movie. I wish I could get a refund for this movie.,1392508800,,125,3.8461538461538463
5721479,3,B00CFK5I8M,"This movie was just ok. My wife and I take our black films very seriously, and they must be good! If not, they get thrown in the trash.",1392422400,,135,3.857142857142857
5721480,1,B00CFK5I8M,Poorly acted drivel. Why would someone bother to produce this train wreck? Another black movie that tries to teach a lesson no one needed. Straight stupid.,1386201600,,155,5.0
5721481,5,B00CFK5I8M,"This movie was excellent all the way around. I cant believe people are actually rating this movie so low. I often rent these low budget African American films in search of diamonds in the rough and this fits that description to a ""t"". Im guessing those that have rated this pretty low haven't really experienced life and cant really relate to the characters. I don't care how much $$ you pour into a film if you cant relate then you probably won't like it. This movie is an excellent reality on marriage and relationships surrounding them. It also provides a great message to those in these situations.",1386028800,4,602,4.635514018691588
5721482,1,B00CFK5I8M,I didn't care too much for this movie. It seemed scripted. The acting didn't flow. I've seen these actors perform better in other movies. There was something missing in their performance,1384300800,,186,5.032258064516129
5721483,3,B00CFK5I8M,"The topic of the movie is very interesting. Husband/wife are keeping their extramarital affairs going and it takes a turn for the worse when the husband's other woman (Honey) turns out to be obsessed. I even found myself laughing at some parts. I'm only giving it 3 stars because I found Honey to be too over the top...even if she was crazy and obsessive. If you like the 4 leading actors as eye candy (Christian Keyes, Maya Gilbert, and Tangi Miller are pictured, Richard Gallion isn't pictured on the cover), you will probably like the movie to at least finish watching it, but it's probably not a movie I would watch again.",1381536000,,626,4.598214285714286
5721484,4,B00CFK5I8M,Very refreshing to see new directors break onto the scene. I look forward to watching more things by Chris Nolen.,1381190400,,113,4.7

8581289,3,B00CFK5I8M,I thought the movie was good. I would have liked to know more about the characters. Christian Keyes is delightful to look at as ALWAYS!!,1485820800,,136,4.48
8581290,2,B00CFK5I8M,"I tried to give this film a chance, as I do any random film that doesn't have an A-list cast or budgeting. However, this movie was horribly and stiffly acted and the characters were very 2-dimensional. A lot of the course of the storyline seemed ridiculous and the pacing was off. The drama escalated far too quickly for the intro/context and the resolution was non-sensical as well. The dialog and action sequence of the protagonists and antagonists was unbelievable. I wouldn't suggest watching this movie unless you are truly bored, as I was, and don't mind it's B-C movie quality.",1468108800,,584,4.85

8581295,2,B00CFK5I8M,"The movie was slow, characters and plot were not developed and the scenes were drawn out with no purpose - especially extended scenes of Honey in her car repeatedly calling Jacque. I didn't understand the point of the PSA at the end. Considering I watched the movie until the end, I would rate it above a 1.",1423267200,,307,4.4035087719298245

8581298,4,B00CFK5I8M,"The acting in this movie is really not that stellar, but the story lines ae awesome. The content is real and relevant. This movie will help you make some real life choices.
