This is a good movie.  A movie I love.  I loved it years ago.  Now I love it again.

29 of 33 people (at this moment) found this review helpful, but at that time had nothing to do with this DVD, as it was not available at that time.

Anyway it is sublime, and if you are here reading reviews just get it!",1290643200,37,372,3.8157894736842106

The original title of both the Tanizaki book and the movie is ""Sasame Yuki"" (light snow). Like the Eskimos, the Japanese have many words to describe snow, which is one of the main motifs in the movie. Even the cherry blossoms fall like snow. And one of the Makioka sisters is named Yukiko which literally means ""snow child.""

The dominant theme of the movie is the changing nature of the world and the loss of traditional values and culture. Like it or not, the old values make way for the newer ones. The older Makioka sisters resist the forces of change. But they gradually come to the realization that they can't live forever in the glorious past, especially given the family's declining economic fortunes. There is a sadness about his movie that I find very touching.

As is the case with many adaptations of books, much is left out in the film version. The Great Hanshin Flood is not mentioned in the movie. Also, Taeko, the youngest Makioka sister, is portrayed differently in the film. In the book she is a much more sinister character. One of the ironies is that her name means ""beautiful or very fortunate child.""

There are some very funny moments in the film, including the scene in a Chinese restaurant where Yukiko meets a husband candidate. Call it a matchmaker's worst nightmare.

Makioka Sisters is not for everyone. But I think those who watch it with patience and an open mind will be rewarded. It also helps that the cinematography is breathtakingly beautiful.

Update: Glad to see Criterion has come out with DVD and Blu-ray versions.",1172966400,107,1826,4.726415094339623
8140762,3,B000HQLKCE,"Kon Ichikawa's seldom seen film The Makioka Sisters gives a glimpse into a culture that was on its way out at the time the movie was set. The year is 1938, Japan is involved in a war that will thrust it into the modern age and the Makioka sisters, daughters of a wealthy merchant, attemt to continue their traditional existence in a rapidly changing culture.

Plot wise the film seems like an Eastern version of a Jane Austen novel. Four sisters try to carry on the traditional culture of arranged and ordered marriages as the world changes around them. Ichikawa paints colorful pictures of an idyllic Japan that is  poised on the modern era.

The film is beautiful to see with its colorful depictions of the changing seasons in Japan from spring to winter. The version that I saw however left something to be desired. This film only seems to be available on VHS. The picture is quite soft and the subtitles are in white. The subtitles are often difficult to read because they blur into the background. This is an important film that is unfortunately neglected. It would be wonderful if a company like Criterion took and interest an gave us a better transfer of this film so that it could be better appreciated as it deserves to be. This is one of the last great masterpieces of one of Japan's most important directors. The film deserves better.",1171238400,48,1345,4.619246861924686
