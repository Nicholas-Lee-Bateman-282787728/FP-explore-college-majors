2120946,5,B0002V7S4S,"This was an interesting and enjoyable extension of the Tuna theme, set at Christmastime in Tuna, Texas.  I was fortunate to see a live performance at Ft Worth's Bass Hall.  I was worried beforehand -- concerned that Tuna at the Bass might be crappie -- but it was excellent.  One reason I expected not to like Tuna was the fact that all of the relatives on one side of my family are like these characters (except that the real-life editions are a lot meaner and dumber).",1104278400,7,470,4.441860465116279
2120947,5,B0002V7S4S,"Tuna Christmas, the sequel to the equally brilliant ""Greater Tuna"" is a filmed play about the citizens of the small town of Tuna Texas. The entire population of Tuna Texas are portrayed by American Treasures Joe Sears and Jaston Williams, I believe that Sears was nominated for a Tony for the show's broadway run- an award they both deserved. The Tuna trilogy- Greater Tuna, A Tuna Christmas and Red White and Tuna have a fierce and almost cultish following throughout the country.

A Tuna Christmas concerns the citizen of town during the annual Christmas yard decoration contest and the reaction to the towns notorious Christmas Phantom, who does what he can to ruin the contest.

The fact that the entire cast is portrayed by only two only makes the show better.  I cannot recommend this highly enough.  I don't want to tell you too much about the show, if you like to laugh, you'll love this show.  My VHS copies are about worn out, I look forward to replacing them on DVD.

These are much loved shows.

Even though the show pokes fun at small town life and Texans in particular, the shows are extremely popular in Texas, anyone who knows anyone from a small town will find something to identify with.

If you get through this show without laughing, you need a ""Funny bone"" transplant.",1093132800,7,1289,4.672566371681416
2120948,5,B0002V7S4S,"Oh my gosh, I never stopped laughing at this movie. These two men can play any character with such utter perfection you almost think there is more than two people in this movie. Who knew that decorating your yard with Christmas dcorations could create a hillarious story line! This laugh out loud comedy is great for family get-togethers an Christmas Eve. You'll never stop laughing!",1006560000,4,383,4.907692307692308

It will keep you laughing all through the video & every time you watch it. You get so involved that during the diner scene you want to help the waitresses out! There is a contest for the best decorated yard for Christmas & you hear that someone had decorated there yard as 'Christmas at Colonel Sanders House"" complete with live chickens dressed as elves! ;) Its worth your time,check it out,I cant wait for the next one.",971913600,14,587,4.394495412844036

Greater Tuna was fantastic, but the second time around these two excellent actors who portray the entire town of Tuna are even funnier.

2120958,5,B0002V7S4S,"This is a follow-up show to Greater Tuna.  The characters are as crazy and funny as ever in this make-believe small town in Texas.  Petey worries about his furry and feathered friends, including those he deems to have personality disorders.  It is a loony story -- with all characters portrayed by just two men -- that celebrates Christmas with all the snarky, sad and joyous aspects of people and their families.  Not your typical Christmas show, for sure, but more down to earth with personalities that you'll recognize among your family and friends and a story that shares the true love and spirit of Christmas.",1465516800,,614,4.819047619047619

If you haven't watched 1- or 2- person plays before, here's how:  Get some popcorn, a soda, and NO distractions.  At first your brain may not be able to resolve the same men playing several different characters, but after 20 minutes or so they meld together so realistically as individuals, and you can't get enough!  Joe Sears and Jaston Williams have Anytown, Texas (or, in their case, Tuna, Texas) nailed down.  For you ""outsiders"" that watch and think the characters are caricatures:  Nope...they're real!

The two actors (Joe and Jason) are pretty much insane and have a heck of a good time playing dozens and dozens of loony townspeople in the made-up town of Tuna, TX.

I was lucky enough to take some yankee associates of mine to see ""Tuna Christmas"" in Dallas. The program actually had a dictionary so non-Southern folks would understand what was being said! That alone set the stage for one of the most delightful and laughter filled evenings of my entire life!

If y'all ever want to know how REAL Texans sound, act and think...this is a great starter. (And, no, that last president was NOT a Texan...he was just another yankee who came down when his daddy started drilling here!) LOL!

2121055,5,B0002V7S4S,"Every Christmas, my family and I enjoy watching the old holiday classics that have been a part of our childhoods for generations...Rudolph, Frosty, Charlie Brown, the Grinch, Scrooge, and plenty of Santa Claus.  Now that we've seen this brilliant production, we can add names like Vera Carp, Aunt Pearl, Dee Dee Snavely, and Petey Fisk to that list, all of whom are residents of an eccentric yet charming little town named after a fish, of all things.  It's Christmas Eve in Tuna, Texas, and all 24 members of this small society are spending it together in ways that are so very familiar to any average American family, but with hilarious complications.  The original cast seen on this DVD, Joe Sears and Jaston Williams, brought their immense talents back to Galveston this past Christmas season, and my family was fortunate enough to see the next to last live performance.  From then on, I had a whole new impression of live stage...I was hooked on not only the acting (stellar performances by both actors) but also the other important stuff like costumes (these guys undress quicker than a hooker on overtime and dress even quicker than that), props (every scene has a different Christmas tree, but there's only one table, two chairs, and a radio for the whole play), dialogue (some of the best writing I have ever heard in any performance), and ""soundtrack"" (plenty of good old country Christmas favorites mixed in with a little modern).  It boggles the mind to know that the entire production featuring such an ecclectic collection of characters is performed by just two men....serious talent here, no question.  When we got back home after seeing it that evening, I immediately looked online to see if I could purchase a copy on DVD to add to our Christmas classics collection....and voila!!  Although this particular performance is about 15 years old, it is timeless...not much different from what we saw live this past year.  The camera work is great, and the lighting is always appropriate for each scene.  In every sense, this is a must have for anyone who has seen the play in person and wants a copy to watch on demand, and it is highly recommended for anybody who has not necessarily heard of ""Tuna"" but nevertheless appreciates a well-written and performed comedy.  I would also recommend purchasing a DVD of the play that started it all, ""Greater Tuna"".  In that one, we are first introduced to the townsfolk and all their delightful dysfunction.  I bought both, and they are absolutely worth the money.  I only wish that the producers of these first two installments of the Tuna saga would release DVDs of their latest two, ""Red, White, and Tuna"" and ""Tuna Does Vegas"", which I hear are no less entertaining.  Hats off to Mr. Sears and Mr. Williams for their unparalleled ingenuity, boundless talent, and uncanny ability to brighten the day of even the most humbug of holiday-bashers.  I give this wonderful slice of rural life in Texas a perfect 10...I'd actually give it more than 10, but then I'd have to take my shoes off!!!!",1297728000,2,3045,4.817658349328215

It is full of intertwining plots about unforgettable community members, all of whom are played by 2 fabulous actors.  The characters are male and female, teens and adults.  It is hysterical, and so engrossing that the last friend we played it for told us she expected the rest of the cast to appear after the stars took their bows.
  I'm getting this DVD copy, as all I have right now is an aging VHS.  The play itself, however, is ageless.  Everyone we have shown it to has had great belly laughs over the events it contains.  You will too!
  The great thing about having a recording is that you can rewind it to find out when you missed when you laugh right through some of the dialogue!  Enjoy.",1234396800,,834,4.493333333333333

Now, friends who didn't get to see it live can enjoy the town of Tuna, and realize it's not so very far off from real small towns like the one I grew up in in Texas (true!). The nearly unanimous favorite is Dee Dee Snavely and her gun shop's motto: ""If we can't kill it, it's immortal!"" Even the trees get a standing ovation. Of course, no one could leave out the fabulous girls at the Tastee Kreme! I wish the other 2 plays, Red, White and Tuna and Tuna Does Vegas is released on DVD soon! It's amazing that the ENTIRE town is played to perfection by 2 men. Each character is distinctly different from all the others, voice, body language, everything!

2121097,5,B0002V7S4S,"When KXAS first aired a performance of this play oh-so-many years ago, we taped it.

We've been watching that bootleg for too many years... now we've bought the real thing and we're glad we did.

This is not fictional. This is a documentary. Well, not really, but if you love Texas, you'll understand what I mean by that. If you don't love Texas, you're not going to really appreciate everything going on in this play.

Anyway, we're going to watch this year after year. There are so many great, memorable lines in it we love to repeat over and over. Sort of like ""The Princess Bride"", but for Texas.

""I don't know why the sheep charges him like that.""

""Well, maybe he's had enough!""

Hilarious, fall-out-of-your-chair funny.",1167868800,,727,4.68503937007874
2121098,5,B0002V7S4S,"I was lucky to catch these guys in Greater Tuna and A Tuna Christmas when the shows were new.  Seeing them a decade later the shows retain every bit of fresh originality, with a touch of nostalgia.  These two actors are simply amazing as they play every character in the town of Tuna - at times you will swear there are more than 2 people on stage, but you'd be wrong.

Remarkable comic timing, ingenious script and brilliant acting by two amazing performances.  Maybe my favorite Christmas ""movie.""

2121099,4,B0002V7S4S,"I SO wanted to award them 5-stars like all the rest of the reviewers, but the DVD version of this classic play just doesn't meet my expectations.

My wife and I absolutely love the Tuna trilogy (Greater Tuna, A Tuna Christmas, and Red, White and Tuna).  We first saw Greater Tuna on our honeymoon while in San Francisco fifteen years ago and have seen others perform it several times since.  We have seen Joe and Jaston (the originals) perform A Tuna Christmas and Red, White and Tuna twice each.  Every time we see any of these three shows, we absolutely laugh our a$$e$ off!  The writing is simply sheer genius.

I was incredibly psyched to learn that the first two shows had finally been released on DVD and rushed to buy them.  I popped one into the player and that was when my heart sank.

Don't get me wrong.  The play and the performances are absolutely stellar!  I am so glad that they got these performances recorded for posterity (the third one, Red White and Tuna, MUST be done as soon as possible before the opportunity is lost)!

The one star docking from the perfect five is due to the really shoddy DVD packaging and presentation.  There are ZERO extras included on the disc.  NOTHING!  There isn't even an information insert inside the cover of the DVD.  The show itself is just a straight copy of the VHS video recording transfered to DVD.  Period.  No remixing or remastering; any flaws on the VHS video transfered to the DVD playback.  Shame on them.  They could have created something for the ages, but no.

Still, this is an incredible show and well worth the investment to own.  My wife and I will watch these shows over and over now and never tire of them.  If they ever do come to their senses and remix and release some ""collector's editions"" with lots of extras (and they should, by all means!), then we'll probably jump on those as well.  We love them that much!",1104364800,17,1889,4.491176470588235

Bertha is my Mother to a tee, mother combed her hair like Bertha and she even had the same pant suit and always put Andy Williams on the record player at Christmas, she'd even send you on a guilt trip just like Bertha.  We've seen the play several times, got the DVD when it came out.  A new friend had never seen it so we did dinner one night and then watched it. He had so much fun watching it that we got this for a Christmas gift for him. You can't help but laugh at, and we don't do Christmas without watching it.",1486166400,,654,3.9022556390977443
