3706168,1,B001N26GTI,"I rented this tonight thinking I would get another enjoyable Schneider flick on par with pretty much all of the other movies he's been in.  I don't know what this was supposed to be, but it certainly wasn't funny.  If any retailers and rental stores even stock this, it should be filed in the action section right alongside the Steven Seagal gems.

Number of times I laughed: once.  It was a ""that's what she said"" joke.  This movie is a sad kung-fu action romp with a serious lack of any kind of comedic writing involved.  Funny moments felt like they were right around the corner, but never came.  I'm not sure if it was lazy writing or just a pure lack of talent.  I guess when the players aren't in the Happy Madison camp, they just don't play the same.

Overall, I feel violated for being duped into thinking this was a comedy, and I have a strong feeling that the other Amazon reviews giving this 4-5 stars are viral.  I fully understand why this wasn't released theatrically.

If you find yourself at a Redbox wanting a good laugh, go with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sex-Drive/dp/B001MEWBVE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sex Drive</a>&nbsp;instead.  That movie actually earns the 4-star rating average it's gotten here.",1238457600,3,1271,5.116504854368932
3706169,5,B001N26GTI,"I am not sure why the movie studios dropped this movie but they must be nuts. Its hilarious!! One long, non stop, butt joke movie. Maybe thats why they didn't back it. Cause of the topic. But it is a cult classic in the making. Just freakin brilliantly ""stupid funny"".

David Carridine is perfect as the Master. Great role in a comedy. Schnieder had a low budget but it doesnt show at all. He made without a doubt as good a movie as Duese Biggalow 1...not 2...that one was a stinker.

But this flick is great. I heard him do an interview on Howard Stern on Sirius Radio...man if you are missing him you are missing brilliant radio there too..Howard is in MVP form on Sirius..but Schnieder worked his tail off on this flick and it shows. Great job Rob!!

Im an Idiocracy, Holy Grail, Grandma's Boy type of comedy fan. This movie is as good on a completely unique topic.",1238284800,10,868,4.37888198757764

3706171,4,B001N26GTI,"Very funny movie, with lots of different situations related to going to prison.
Very glad that David Carradine is in this film, great to see the original
kung fu star is still acting and having fun.  I hope they make lots of
money on this one as a way to stick it to the studio that did not want
to release his movie to the theaters. Also in the extras you can see that
they worked hard and had fun at the same time...its shows in the movie.
Good for a keeper.",1238025600,2,460,4.0
3706172,4,B001N26GTI,"I like all movies of Schneider, except European Gigolo, a boring and overstretched extension of Deuce Bigalow. In Big Stan, the brilliant Schneider is back, playing an arrested con man who hired a mysterious Kung Fu master to train him against the potential jailhouse rapers he's about to face in six months' time. As expected, he needed to fight not only other prisoners but also the warden and the only other apprentice of his Kung Fu master. If you want some big laughs (Both my wife and I really laughed throughout the movie highly frequently) and don't mind exaggerated Kung Fu acts, this is excellent for you. You will also find the most beautiful and sexiest Jennifer Morrison (the female doctor subordinate in House MD). The supporting actors are great, too. I would say this is the best movie from Schneider so far. Pity for him that it cannot be released on theatres in US. I bet it would have been a big hit. Definitely an excellent choice in the rental store after a hard day's work. Highly recommended!",1236556800,10,1015,4.675977653631285

3706288,5,B001N26GTI,This is a great movie for both comedy and action it is funny and has some good action scenes Rob Schnider plays in it and I have to say it is his best movie yet. Ok this movie is a about a con artist who is getting sent to prison with the fear of him being raped So he finds a Martial arts master who teaches him over the corse of a 3 month period. So he gets trained and then he goes to prison and He makes a name for himself and gets the prison in line and he is told if he wants to get out early that the warden has a job for him to shut down the prison.  So the he makes friends with everybody and then the warden threatens him with another martial arts master who is the masters number one that he talked about if you want to know more about this movie then buy it or rent it very good movie.,1341705600,,797,3.744047619047619
3706289,4,B001N26GTI,"Big Stan is so much better than most films of it's kind. Many times the Saturday Night Live graduates do not translate well to full length films.  They may get one good film out but then is crashes and burns.  Rob Schneider keeps it going with this film. The cast has some great actors that bring legitimacy to the fantasy that only makes this better.  David Carradine (RIP) parody's himself, that alone makes this movie worth watching but there is much more.  Kevin Gage pulls off comedy as well as he does tough guy roles. This flick is on my Saturday Afternoon list along with Animal House, The Wedding Singer and Galaxy Quest.",1339891200,,630,4.548672566371682

I've seen just about all his movies and/or appearances; this one really lets him display his true talents: goofiness and hilarity! David Carradine is no doubt THE MASTER. Bob Sapp is definitely BIG RAYMOND, best counterfeiter I know. Henry Gibson, M. Emmett Walsh, Scott Wilson, Kevin Gage, and Brandon Jackson help keep this movie rolling along. It's not GONE WITH THE WIND (Thank GOD!), this is actually something I can enjoy. It's not Joe Dirt, this is something I will watch more than once.

Not wanting to be raped in jail, he hires ""The Master"" (David Carradine) to teach him how to fight. In 6 months our weakling Stan is converted into a fighting machine capable of defeating men several times his size and strength.

In prison, Big Stan becomes the top dog and pacifies the inmates to the dismay of the warden. The humor consisted of stale prison jokes and pokes fun at Scientology. I found it rather lame and juvenile.

3706294,3,B001N26GTI,"This is not so much a review, as it as a long comment. Marvelously Horrible! With a little race hate for everyone. I wish I didn't like this movie, but I do! It's much funnier than I could ever have imagined and I don't really have that much of a sense of humor where race and prison are involved. But the nazis (who speak in black slang????) get it as bad as the black guys and there are lots of fine references to black male sexual prowess and insatiability--beginning with the opening bit, which is what kept me from changing the channel post haste. Rob Schneider gets funnier as the movie goes on; David Carradine's role is played with ice water for blood, the slapstick is hilarious and  Schneider can make anyone want to take up martial arts; he and his stunt double are very convincing. The shower scene is even better than the first yard scene. What's better is that there are at least 3 stories going on concurrently.  Maybe it's getting such a low rating here because it isn't as negative as it seems at first glance.",1316995200,2,1027,4.428571428571429

I winced a bit at the more overt sex jokes and crude language compared to Rob's other films but I suppose that crudeness is not much different from many Judd Apatow or Seth Rogen movies.

I chose to allow myself to enjoy the movie and have some wow moments -

1) The gags were laugh-out-loud funny as expected.
2) A pleasant surprise was that the film also worked as a credible action film, especially Rob's scenes showing skills in arnis-kali, nunchaku, and sticky-hands (Chisao) sparring. Having Simon Rhee, Dan Inosanto and the guy who played the Vietnamese villain (obviously a genuine martial artist) added to the credibility.
3) David Carradine was brilliant as usual and I thought it was a real coup to have him in this movie.
4) The final Wow moment was finding out that Rob directed the movie as well and that this was his first directorial stint. The movie was quite polished and tight for a first-time director.

Of course, this is NOT art. But it's brilliant entertainment.",1260057600,5,1109,4.642857142857143
3706305,1,B001N26GTI,"The basic ""joke"" that this movie seems to be centered around is that in prison, you will be sexually violated.  ANd this is repeated over and over and over and over.  Does Schneider think that by repeating this, it will eventually get a laugh?  It doesnt.  But Big Stan becomes a hero when he is sent to prison and  saves everyone from this act....because ""it just isn't fair"".  Sorry Rob, it still isn't funny.",1259712000,2,411,4.486486486486487
3706306,3,B001N26GTI,"Ok, first off, let me get this clear, I give BIG STAN three stars for the funny and entertaining performance of David Carradine. As for the movie, it's mostly the pits, it's full of unfunny off-putting ""humor"", lots of prison rape jokes, ha ha. Rob Schneider has never been one of my favorites, and he is no filmmaker, but I also must add, he seems suprisingly competant as a martial artist. Yes, you read that right, the martial arts here are actually pretty good, and I guess, one more reason to see the movie.

The whole reason I even watched this movie was for Carradine, who has a fairly good size role, gets to show off his kung fu, after all he plays the master. DC also gets to show his lighter side with the movie's biggest laughs coming from him, with his training sequences with Schneider perhaps the funniest.

Again, I do want to caution anyone out there, who is not a Carradine fan, or a Schneider either I guess, this is not a good movie. Most of the time, it's not a funny movie, a lot of the time it's just plain dumb. It's also loooooong, a Rob Schneider movie should never exceed ninety minutes, this one is a hundred and five. If I was to grade this one as a real film, I would give it just one star, but Carradine was my favorite actor, and some times we do crazy things for love.

For a truely funny kung fu comedy, see the little known CONFESSIONS OF AN ACTION STAR.",1247097600,,1389,4.273764258555133

3706308,3,B001N26GTI,"Rob Schneider's directorial debut Big Stan is a prison comedy that's funnier than say, Let's Go to Prison, but the film as a whole is mostly hit and miss.  Schneider stars as Stan, a wealthy scam artist who finds himself sentenced to prison.  In an effort to make himself, shall we say inpenetrable, he undertakes martial arts training from The Master (the late, great David Carradine) and thus goes to jail, where he ends up changing things to say the least.  Predictable, loaded with gay jokes, and featuring some surprisingly nicely choreographed fight sequences, Big Stan is a worthwhile comedy from the often underrated Schneider, who personally I've always found much better than anything from Adam Sandler.  House hottie Jennifer Morrison is on board as Stan's trophy wife, and the great Scott Wilson is here as well as a pretty crooked warden.  While it does run a little too long for its own good, Big Stan is enjoyable enough to warrant viewing, but not to the point of hilarity that it could have garnered.",1244160000,,1017,4.82183908045977

3706310,4,B001N26GTI,I liked this Schneider film better than his Animal series and also better than the Gigolo series.  I do hate that some of the scenes made it inappropriate for younger kids but overall it's a pretty good and funny film.  One surprise and a deviation from other Schneider films was the absence of a cameo by Adam Sandler for it seems that each have a habit of showing up in the other persons films either as a principal actor or in a cameo position.  If Adam was worked in I missed it.  It was nice to see though that Rob worked in a part for his Mother also.,1240963200,6,557,4.12962962962963
3706311,3,B001N26GTI,"I wasn't expecting much from this film that was shelved for a couple of years and released direct to video. Rob Schneider shows he can carry these types of films and also directs this mostly funny, but familiar tale.

I've seen many films with a bigger budget fall flat in comparison to this silly and entertaining movie. OK, it's predictable to a point, but what films of this nature aren't? I enjoyed this film much more than I thought I would and I think anyone who enjoys this type of movie will too!

The DVD transfer is very good and there are a few extras to fiddle including a making of and out takes. There is also a commentary with Rob. So sit back take out your brain and enjoy!",1240617600,3,689,4.292307692307692

the plot

Stan Minton is good at conning unsuspecting folks into buying time shares at high prices. Hes become very wealthy by cheating people out of their money. He was so good that his business was under investigation, and he was finally arrested by authorities. He is sentenced to 3  5 years in prison, which will begin in six months. Stan is very afraid of getting raped in jail, he considers getting a tattoo on his anus that may scare some dudes away, but after a pep talk from his very hot wife, he gets the inspiration to find a way to become unrape-able.

He starts taking kung fu lessons, but after he offends the master of that Dojo, he meets a real kung fu master outside in the alley. He hires The Master to move in to his house and teach him how to defend himself against anybody. The Master puts him some grueling training and a terrible diet. By the time the six months are over, he is ready for his sentence. Even the food tastes great after eating insects and other horrible things. He finds the most dangerous criminal in the prison and challenges him to a fight in the courtyard. He ends up fighting a few of the gangs there and whoops them all. No one messes with him, and he sets up a no raping rule for the entire jail.

 Warden Gasque has different plans for Stan. The warden wishes to sell the prison land in order to build real estate, and have Stan help him with the real estate portions in exchange for an early parole. When Stan learns how the Warden wishes to have the prison closed down by the State, he may have different ideas.

the breakdown

 Rob Schneider has enjoyed most of his fame showing up here and there in his buddy Adam Sandlers films, some classic SNL work, and on seldom occasion he stars in his own movies. So far hes had a handful or so, and they're all pretty funny. This film, Big Stan, one of his latest starring roles went by pretty quietly, as it went straight to DVD. I caught this one on FIOS and enjoyed it a lot. In the past Schneider has unfairly was the bearer of some heat when he played ethnic characters in a typical caricature style simply because hes white. While all that is just a bunch a BS, here in Big Stan, the ethnic caricatures just keep on coming, but not from him, from the actual cultural groups represented. In my opinion, it was all done in good taste, but even if it wasn't  who the hell cares? Its a comedy film; these are the things we laugh at. Poking fun at the black gangs, the Mexicans and the white supremacy gangs is an easy laugh. I liked the different reactions when Stan declared no more rape at the prison. They were all trying to negotiate a deal on whom they can rape, maybe the criminals incarcerated with rape charges? The fights that he had were the funniest bits for me. His small size seemed to confuse all of his opponents as to why they were losing to him.

 The late David Carradine was hilarious in a self-mocking kind of way. This turns out to be one of his last roles. Jennifer Morrison is one of the hottest actresses working today. Im used to seeing her as a sexy blonde in her TV show Once Upon a Time, in this film she is a brunette and she still looks really good. Im also not used to seeing her in a comedy situation, but it turns out shes pretty funny. Even though the movie mainly deals with rape and conspiracy, its a very light-hearted movie. It is rated R for very strong language and some violence, so its not for the kids. I recommend this movie for some easy laughs, and a couple of hours of entertainment.
