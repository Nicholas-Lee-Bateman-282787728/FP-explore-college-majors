8441436,5,B004UCHYEE,"We have used these along with the Conceptual Physics textbook for homeschooling.  He takes the difficult principles from the textbook and explains them in fun, extraordinary ways. My middle schooler and high schooler LOVE it. Plus, I understand more than I ever did in high school. This guy loves Physics and he brings it to the classroom with labs and cool demonstrations. Five stars!!",1413504000,,386,5.03125
8441437,5,B004UCHYEE,"If I had had Paul Hewitt as a Physics teacher in either high school or college, I definitely would not have detested the subject!  These DVDs are remastered from videos from the 1980's, but this does not detract from Mr. Hewitt's dynamic teaching and passion for the subject.  I am using these along with Apologia Physics for my homeschooled son, and this is by far the most interesting and engaging part of his Physics.  My husband, who never took Physics, watches these with us and we are enjoying the learnign together.",1391731200,2,522,4.714285714285714
