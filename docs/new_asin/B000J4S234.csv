The video is basically video of a sunset at the beach.  It looks and sounds amazing.  My favorite feature is the loop mode - I set it on loop on my bedroom television and fall asleep to the sound of soothing waves.  My friends have also said how cool they think it is... now I know what to get them for Christmas!",1160697600,,483,4.095744680851064
