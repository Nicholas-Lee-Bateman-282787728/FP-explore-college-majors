1674584,5,B00005Y427,I cannot understand people not appreciating this masterpiece. Carlos Saura is a master at this art form and you should sit back and absorb his and his dancers skill. People expecting to see the Opera will be disappointed however lovers of dance will see its beauty and haunting sequences that leave you wondering whether you are in the story or out. I loved the whole thing and have watched the other parts of the trilogy with equal enthusiasm and excitement. I cannot recomend this movie enough.,1138752000,9,496,4.77906976744186
1674585,5,B00005Y427,"To appreciate this film, one of the various produced by Carlos Saura, a person needs some level of understanding of the opera and some degree of cultural sophistication.

So I guess reviews of art and literature very much reflect the reviewer's ""knowledge world.""

I would highly recommend this movie.  Be aware that to really appreciate and enjoy it, one has to be more in tune with foreign art, music and culture.",1130025600,,415,4.816901408450704
1674586,5,B00005Y427,"This is one of those backstage/onstage movies with parallel plots. It is easier to understand if you are already familiar with the plot and with flamenco dancing. If not, try the real opera in the superb Placido Domingo version. I think it is the best of the three Saura/Gades flamenco movies.  Blood Wedding is a purer dance only performance, but the story is a bit short and El Amor Brujo very surreal. Christina Hoyos gives a magnificent performance, and her dancing in the tobacco factory fight scene takes flamenco to a high level as narrative dance.  Sadly my VHS is over 20 years old and it has not been re-released in NTSC format.",1128384000,6,638,4.6371681415929205
1674587,1,B00005Y427,"I wanted to see the story of Carmen.  Instead I saw an incomprehensible ballet story that, according to accompanying blurb, was supposed to be the audition of dancers for a performance of Carmen that mirrored the story of Carmen.  More of the dancing was unappealing than not, purposefully awkward and graceless, and I would have had no clue what they were trying to convey if not for the aforementioned blurb.  As a matter of fact, I still don't think it looked like what it was said to be.  The backdrop was an abstract group of flats painted with large black circles and colored, I assume, by varicolored lights.  It had no meaning or relationship to the performance that I could tell.  On top of that, they threw in a little gratuitous sexual fondling of breasts and crotches (over clothing) that I found quite pointless.  I definitely would NOT recommend this junk.",1127088000,2,870,4.7218543046357615

We then saw the film of the opera with Placido Domingo,in Nice, and later bought the videos of both productions.  The Saura's Carmen has ""done the rounds"" and been most popular with all our friends and has become so faded,it was essential to buy the DVD so we can continue to re-enjoy many repeats in al its original splendour.

1674618,5,B00005Y427,"I chose this because Gades appears in it. He is Spanish dancing legend and this features Gades' search for the ideal Carmen. Much of the content is based on personal emotions involved and his relationship with Christine Hoyos, his long standing leading lady now being replaced in this production, is part of the issue. I watched a young Gades at work in Madrid in 1964 and was curious to see how he had progressed and changed.  Paco de Lucia and Gades  reprogrammed the Flamenco rythyms within the opera's score and generally, this is about how the entire dynamic production came  to be staged with an authentic FLAMENCO content.  If you are new to Flamenco it might be better to buy the full stage production first. For Gades enthusiasts, this is a MUST HAVE.",1370649600,,760,4.69172932330827

1674620,5,B00005Y427,"This version of Carmen, which is normally an opera with a Romeo and Juliet theme, is told in flamenco dance. I originally saw it in theater and was so impresssed I just had to get a copy. But, it wasn't available on DVD until recently. The flamenco dancers and musicians are considered the top artists in their field and it is easy to see why. The film made me want to go out an learn flamenco dancing, but, unfortunately, I'm too old for this strenuous form of dance. The female teacher in this film has the most beautiful hand movements of any dancer I've ever seen and the quality of the dancing is terrific throughout. The dance in the tobacco factory, with the entire female cast, is a masterpiece and sends chills down my spine whenever I see it. Since it is considered an art film, it is in Spanish with English subtitles. Somehow, though, I think you would be able to follow it without any subtitles at all. So don't let the fact it is subtitled turn you away. I recommend this film without reservation, except for children. I think anyone under 16 would be bored and wouldn't understand it. Besides, there is rough language and brief nudity. Take a chance with this one and you won't be disappointed.",1364428800,2,1209,4.5
1674621,4,B00005Y427,"CARMEN is best known as an 1875 opera by Georges Bizet loosely based on a book by Prosper Merimee.  The title character is a beautiful but shallow and promiscuous woman who discards lover after lover.  When she attempts to discard Jose, who has sacrificed much for her and genuinely loves her, he goes into a jealous rage and stabs her to death.  The opera was originally considered an unpleasant story about unpleasant people, and critics and public alike shrugged it aside.  About twenty-five years later CARMEN was reassessed, and it is now generally regarded as one of the great operas of its era.

Starring and choreographed by Antonio Gades and directed and filmed by Carlos Saura, this 1983 film translates the story into the highly stylized dance form of Spanish Flamenco--but it does so in a rather unexpected way.  Like the 1981 BLOOD WEDDING, also created by Gades and Saura, the film seems to begin as a documentary in which Gades searches for a dancer to play the title role in his new Flaminco ballet version of CARMEN.  As the film progresses it transforms into an unexpected story of a dance company whose lives and relations begin to mirror the ballet of CARMEN they are preparing.  The story alternates between rehearsals and real life until the two become deliberately confused.  At the film's conclusion it is impossible to know which is which.

The dance portions of the film are nothing short of spectacular.  Unfortunately, one cannot say the same for the ""real life"" portions of the film, which are overstated, over-long, and quite often unimaginative.  At one hour and forty-five minutes, CARMEN feels very long, and the film's conclusion lacks the spectacular drama one expects from the story.  At its best it is a brilliant bit of film making, but its flaws tend to undercut its assets.  Recommended, but this mixture of documentary, dance, and art film is uneven indeed.

1674622,5,B00005Y427,"I fell in love with this movie years ago because of the dance. Not much of a movie plot, but still an enjoyable flick.",1359331200,,118,3.9583333333333335
1674623,3,B00005Y427,"The recent 2011 version of Carlos Saura's Carmen (Blu-ray) is a poor substitute for the 1983 original film version. The original version is not currently available at a reasonable price. Netflix only owns a few of the originals and one of those was cracked and a replacement had to be resent to us.  The 1983 film is available on YouTube [...] (not downloadable in the US), but the screen resolution is not as good as the DVD.

This is a plea for someone to reissue the original 1983 film in which one can actually watch Antonio Gades, Paco de Lucia, Cristina Hoyos and Laura del Sol in a fantastic performance we have watched a number of times while other Netflix users wait. We would love to own a DVD of this excellent film.

The new stage performance is interesting but leaves one unlikely to watch it again. Carmen's relationship with her jailed husband before and after his release is very unclear in the new production.  One is never sure who is fighting whom in several of the sequences.",1356480000,7,995,4.573033707865169

1674626,5,B00005Y427,"This has been something of an adventure for me amounting to almost a baptism of fire. Like many, I am very familiar with the story of Carmen as found in Bizet's well-known and popular opera and I thought that, as an introduction to an extended example of flamenco, this would be fairly straight-forward to follow. In addition, as the story is red-blooded to say the least, I thought it would be a natural partner for flamenco which I anticipated, would also be red-blooded.

In all of these expectations I was on the right lines. What I had not anticipated was the extraordinary degree to which this example of the flamenco art is able to extend the rawness of the emotional impact to an almost frightening degree.

Some background may be of help at this stage: Gades, as a young man, studied classical dance as well as all the Spanish popular dance idioms. This dual interest and skill enabled him, uniquely, to fuse together the two art forms of ballet and flamenco. He believed that flamenco must also be shorn of all extraneous distractions in order to bring the essence of the dance to light. At this early stage he was also providing the choreography for classical ballet such as Bolero, Carmen and El Amor Brujo for companies such as La Scala. From 1981 he formed the collaboration with Carlos Saura, the film director, which resulted in some of his flamenco-based creations being filmed. These films had an enormous effect on ballet companies around the world and Gades became very influential in this way while continuing as a ballet dancer in Giselle for example.

This production brings the 1983 Carmen to our screens in an amazingly effective performance. The music includes specially pre-recorded Bizet extracts played by the Suisse Romande orchestra with considerable brio. The majority of the music however is pure flamenco - two guitars, solo singers and clapping. Precision ensemble dance to massed multi-rhythmic clapping has to be seen to be believed! The scenarios presented crackle with sexual tensions and competitiveness and an unmistakable underlying and ever-present threat of violence. This is not just between men but also between women and between the sexes. This is an artistic statement beyond any of my previous experiences and I found it gripping. This is not the same as comforting. There is not a moment of tenderness to be seen - not even in the highly disciplined acknowledgement of the final applause.

It is likely that non-specialists of this art form will fail to pick up or begin to understand many of the underlying meanings in all of this - subtitles would have been invaluable in the frequent sung parts, but this is not a good reason to deny this full acknowledgement. The recording is all that could be wished for and there is a bonus in the form of interviews with members of the team. The sleeve notes are particularly informative. This issue delivers an unforgettable experience and essential guide to a dramatic art form.",1342051200,9,2971,4.888888888888889
1674627,5,B00005Y427,"Having learned about flamenco from live stage productions, and via Antonio Gades and Saura on film... I was excited to see the first flamenco on Blu-ray. This disk is fantastic.

1674639,5,B00005Y427,"I saw this when it came out and its images have always lived in my imagination.  There is a seasoned choreographer of flamenco, looking for the perfect ""carmen"" in his adaptation of the classic opera into dance theatre.  At the start, it is all about what is needed for the production, opening a view into how it is organized by creative professionals.  Then, as a Carmen is apparently chosen, the personalities and rivalries of the artists emerge, pitting their ambitions and disappointments against one another, which is also part of the creative process that the choreographer is managing:  he must encourage, sanction, nurture, and even simply throw the dice as the ensemble begins to coalesce into unified team.  Finally, as the art intertwines with the lives of the performers, the choreographer loses control - or gives it up, with purpose - of the situation, all adding into the quality of the performance in spite of the personal chaos that threatens him and others.  It becomes impossible to tell what is real and what is projected emotion into the art, even the violent ending.

What amazes me is that the film works so well and is completely believable - it successfully avoids the danger of becoming preposterous and cheap melodrama.  I think this is in large part because the quality of the dancing is wonderful, indeed it continually swept me into its magic all of its own, regardless of the limits of the actors.

Warmly recommended.  The idea of a story around an artistic production may not be new, but this is executed to perfection.

Note:  it is a pity this is not available for region 1.  I got this new in Britain for $5.",1290470400,,1644,4.746478873239437
1674640,5,B00005Y427,I saw Carmen as a teenager in 1984.  I loved it then and it is still in my top ten movies of all time.  I have it on video and watched over the years periodically.  Shared with family and friends.  People have always enjoyed it even if sub titles were not their cup of tea.  The intensity of the flamenco dancing equates to the Irish dancing of Lord of the Dance and River Dance.  The scene where Antonio Gades makes the ensemble practice at a leg cramping pace is riveting and you as the observer also become exhausted.  In the end you are left wondering is this real or part of the opera?  Now I will have this fantastic movie on DVD!!!!,1246924800,,639,4.180327868852459

1674642,5,B00005Y427,"This is one of my all-time favorite films.  The color and dancing are spectacular but I think he most interesting and intelligent aspect of he  film is the confusion of reality with unreality; life with an opera. The film, which starts on a concrete level becomes more and more surreal as Gades slips into a form of madness--a madness, perhaps, fated by the Gods.

He is obsessed with finding the perfect Carmen and...to their mutual destruction...he finds her.  Reality and the opera become increasingly intertwined until Gades distorted reality becomes more powerful than life itself.  In parallel with Bizet's Carmen, Gades falls inexplicably and helplessly in love with he faithless Carmen.  I won't write more.  You really need to see it yourself.

There's only one scene I disapprove of.  Gades dances a dance that, ""changed my life and taught me about dance.""  The whole episode is an insider thing and should have been left on the cutting floor.

One scene I especially enjoyed is the tobacco factory.  ""There are good and bad girls in this factory,""  The women sing.  They choose sides and go into an aggressive dance routine that must be seen to be believed.  It ends when an enraged Carmen produces a knife and slashes the throat of a rival--a rival in the opera and a rival in ""real"" life.  It's sudden and shocking.

On the whole,one needs a little help to understand the storyline in opera from time to time, even if one is fluent in Italian and French. The 'Image' edition of Carmen and Aida has English subtitles, whether one wants them or not. There are no chapter headings in leaflet form to guide you from one aria to another as one finds them with separate DVDs of the very same productions on Kultur. To make matters worse, there are no subtitles at all in the DVD of La Traviata, nor are there any chapter headings. Unless one already knows the story of La Traviata in detail, the briefest of outlines on the jacket is no help to those like us who live in the Third World and have no chance to see opera in North America, or Europe. We buy the set of DVDs because we're familiar with some of the music, want to know the story, to see it acted and understand what's going on.

This set spoiled my Christmas.

7956306,5,B00005Y427,"This film is based on the Manuel de Falla ballet, which director Carlos Saura adapted as part of his three-part flamenco trilogy. Of the three, I imagine ""Carmen"" would be the most accessible and well-liked by American audiences, since the plot is so familiar to them. However, ""El Amor Brujo"" is a great movie for those who love modern flamenco mixed with the supernatural. It's very Spanish in theme, obviously, which tends toward Surrealist images, but also grievous loss and suffering. Don't expect ""Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown"" here.

It's beautifully shot and danced; the music is stunning (it's the original ballet score), and Saura's lead dancers are, as usual, fine actors. Since I'm crazy about Cristina Hoyos, I was happy to see her show up in it (I knew nothing about the movie when I first saw it). Antonio Gades returns, of course (what faces Hoyos and Gades have!) and the star of ""Carmen,"" Laura del Sol, stars here, too.

It's a real shame it's OP, but if you have a lot of money, the trilogy is available. I'm not sure about other second-hand sources, nor anything that might be available for online viewing. If you're new to Saura, buy ""Carmen,"" if only for the Tabacalera scene. It's also the most fleshed-out story. Some days I say I like ""Blood Wedding"" (Bodas de Sangre) best, although you should be familiar with Garcia Lorca's dialogue before watching it, since there really isn't any in the movie.",1459382400,,1437,4.767068273092369

7956313,5,B00005Y427,"This version of Carmen, realized and directed by Carlos Saura, is among the best movies about the artistic creative process. Its so-called genre looks like a documentary (rehearsing a new and different version of Carmen). All the principals (well-known Spanish performing artists) are named as they are named in real life, except for Carmen, acted by Laura Del Sol. Intriguing surrealism insinuates every now and again. The dancing (Flamenco) reveals the beauty of the human form. It's quite a stunning film that transcends the ordinary movie frame, reaching the realm of the sublime.",1427328000,2,584,5.290322580645161
