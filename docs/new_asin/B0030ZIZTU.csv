This show as cover topics such as minerals, planets, elements, and their relationships. My son (in kindergarten) routinely explains properties of minerals as well as earths relationship to the solar system and the galaxy to our friends.

This show is amazing at peaking curiosity. You won't be disappointed!",1272758400,,467,5.0519480519480515
4047779,5,B0030ZIZTU,"My son bought an old version of Zula Patrol at half price books.  Little did we know we stumbled on something that he would love so much!  We have bought just about everything Zula now, and by far the Season 1 of Zula is his favorite.  My son is constantly in his rocket ship blasting off.  He can also name most of the planets, some of the moons (or satellites) and can tell you about eco-systems.  I think that's very good for a 4 year old.  He's even shared some of his episodes with his preschool class to help them learn science concepts.  When a 4 year old is so in love with science that he wants to build rocket ships when he grows up, I can't say enough good about this series.",1271289600,,686,4.112781954887218
4047780,5,B0030ZIZTU,"Zula Patrol is a children's television show featuring a group of aliens that travel around the universe learning about (and teaching) scientific phenomena.  Both of my kids (ages 4 and 2) love Zula Patrol, and, just as importantly, learn lots of great information while watching this.  Thanks to Zula Patrol, my 4 year-old can identify cloud types, knows about atoms and molecules, talks about the solar wind, understands that Pluto was ""fired"" as a planet and is now a ""dwarf planet,"" and knows many other scientific facts.

My kids can't get enough Zula Patrol.  Although it's hard to find in many television markets, thankfully (and finally) all 26 episodes are available now on DVD.",1271116800,,686,4.991228070175438

8386337,5,B0030ZIZTU,"The people behind Zula Patrol know their stuff with kids.  They give them just enough information and repetition for young minds to learn and store.  Even the parents will have fun watching these cute aliens as they go on their adventures. Zeeter is my favorite, she is adorable, I love her spunk and the nasal voice is perfect.  The sound effects are amazing, really cute and sometime quite funny. The music is well done as well. Animation is top notch. Zula Patrol Rocks!!!!  When will they make more?  :-)",1346889600,,508,4.662921348314606
8386338,5,B0030ZIZTU,"A few months ago, my family and I stumbled upon the ""Zulu Patrol"" on the WETA Kids channel.  After watching a few episodes, my three children aged 3, 5, and 6, all clamored for more.  The show, as those of you that have seen it know, is about some aliens who patrol/police the galaxies, while through their adventures, teach young kids about science and astronomy.

There is a lot of good programming out there for kids that help them learn (such as Blue's Clues, Sid the Science Kid, Berenstain Bears, and the like), and I have to say that this show is among the very best of them.  While my 3 year old views this as entertainment, my 6 year old has made some pretty impressive observations based on what he's learning from the show.  For example, last night, he told me that the four planets inside of the asteroid belt didn't have rings around them while the big four planets outside of the belt did.  At his age, I'm not sure that I even knew much of anything about the planets, let alone their names and which ones had rings and which ones didn't.

This product contains two disks, which include all 26 episodes of the first season.  Each episode is around 11 minutes long and concludes with a ""Multo-Moment"" where the character named Multo reviews what the kids just learned.  The show is aimed at pre-schoolers through, say, third grade and has humor that both kids and adults can appreciate.  I give this product five stars.

On an unrelated bit of trivia, Nancy Cartwright, the talented voice actress who voices Bart Simpson on ""The Simpsons"", also voices two of the characters on the show.  Not that you can tell.  :-)",1326153600,,1628,4.534246575342466
8386339,5,B0030ZIZTU,"My 4.5 year old son loves this show.  That alone, however, would not be enough for me to give it a five star rating.  He has also learned a ton of science.  He astounds people with his knowledge of the solar system, cloud formation, the stages of matter, etc.  Every time he watches the DVD he picks up something new.  Not only is he retaining the lessons,  he gets more and more excited about science.  They do a great job at combining education and entertainment.",1285286400,2,465,4.4
8386340,5,B0030ZIZTU,"My 4.5 year old son loves Zula Patrol and can't get enough of it, although he has already shown an interest in space and science in general.  This is a great DVD set with both discs from the first season.  My favorite part, the DVDs start right up at the menu with no commercials to fast forward/skip through!",1274140800,2,309,4.310344827586207
