3169606,5,B0017APPSE,"Superb due to the fact that it presents another portal to peer into ... since it has never really been convincingly established why Henry changed his affections so violently toward Anne. First he is under her spell and then he believes her handmaiden. It is obvious he could do away with people at a whim.  Yes, there are many theories. it was good to see Anne played by Natalie and Mary by Scarlett as they brought rich emotion to their roles on the screen",1516665600,,457,4.440476190476191

3169620,1,B0017APPSE,"I can see how someone who never read the book could believe this movie to be good. However, as I did read the book, I can see how bad this movie is. The movie was very rushed causing them to miss major details from the book like the fact Mary has two children with Henry, and she even has a second marriage after the death of her first husband (which is completely ignored in the movie). It's like they wanted Mary to have her baby and cast her aside as quickly as possible tp focus just on anne which is not in line with the book since the book is Mary's story, not Anne's, hence the title. If you have read the book, do not let this movie ruin the wonderful work philipa gregory did with this story. If you have not read the book, enjoy!",1515283200,,739,4.068493150684931

3169624,2,B0017APPSE,"Wow. I had pretty high hopes for this, as I like many of the actors in the film (especially Mark Rylance and Kristen Scott Thomas). Having read the book and other historically accurate books of that period, I was a bit disappointed. I suppose it was unrealistic to expect something more historically accurate in 115 minutes, and perhaps a longer movie would have made for a more believable dynamic than what was portrayed between Henry and Anne here. One excellent option which is far slower paced but far, far superior is the six part series Wolf Hall, also starring Mark Rylance, and also offered on Amazon.",1514419200,,609,4.754716981132075

However, it is a fun timepiece, and I love the costuming even though the peasants are color coordinated, which I hate.  However, if you look past the flaws of the movies, I believe if you are a queen Elizabeth/Tudor fan, you will enjoy this if you can enjoy movies for their entertainment value.  If you prefer complete historical accounting and perfect costuming, this film will not be for you.  I liked it enough to purchase it.  I love it for its entertainment value.

3169640,4,B0017APPSE,"This is an interesting film about an affair that started when the Boleyn father of two girls and a son ignored the wishes of his wife and arranged for his daughter Mary to seduce the king with the help of his brother. King Henry VIII was disappointed with his wife who bore no son and was now barren. He wanted a son to succeed him as king. The affair quickly dissolved into a rivalry between the sisters, Mary (1499-1543) and Anne Boleyn (1501-1536). Mary became the kings concubine for a short period and bore Henry one or two children whom he never acknowledged. Anne seduced the king by repeatedly refusing to have sex with him until he gave up his relationship with Mary, rid himself of his current wife, married her, and made her queen. She served as queen of England from 1533 to 1536 and bore Henry a daughter Elizabeth. Henry became dissatisfied with her because, among other reason, she bore him no son. He accepted as true a rumor that she had sex with her brother and beheaded her and her brother. This created a political and religious upheaval that started the English Reformation. Henry never had a son despite attempts with other women, and Elizabeth became Queen of England.",1511654400,,1191,4.622641509433962

The 2nd sister can't produce a male heir. After a miscarriage she plots to sleep with her brother to get pregnant again before the Kind notices she's know longer pregnant and in the end The son is beheaded, the 2nd daughter becomes Queen of England and is then beheaded charged with incest.

3169668,3,B0017APPSE,"This 2008 offering, based on a book by Phillipa Gregory, depicts the lesser-known aspects of the tragic saga of King Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn, played here respectively by a relatively staid Eric Bana and a sparkly, and appropriately vivacious Natalie Portman.
  The film, directed by Justin Chaddock, is, as many have noted, rafe with inaccuracies. But it begins with a view  of the early lives of the three surviving (two died in childhood) Boleyn children, Anne, George, and Mary(Daisy Doidge-Hill,Finton Reilly, and Kizzy Fassett), romping in a field. Anne, the most agressive of the trio, comes out on top in the game they were playing, winning the praise of their father, Sir Thomas Boleyn(Mark Rylance), and episode that precludes the main events of the childrens' lives in certain ways.
  Several years later, we see the now-grown children on Mary's wedding day to William Carey(Benedict Cumberbatch).
  In viewing this film, as well as another  period piece featuring Scarlett Johansson--""Girl With a Pearl Earring"", I've often felt that  another blonde actress--namely Kate Hudson, with her squarer jawline, bore a stronger resemblance to both Mary Boleyn and Vermeer's muse( and Hudson had been slated to play at least one of them).But in view of the speculativeness and/or inaccuracies of either film, Johansson aptly acquitts herself.
 In actuality, the Boleyn sisters' dubious careers as royal courteseans began during their father's years in France--at least Mary's, during her time of service in the court of Queen Claude. Mary's first conquest was the French King Francois, but she had been sent home because of the Queen's resentment of the situation.
 Here, the Boleyns encounter Henry when he is injured during a hunting accident on their estate, which Anne unintentionally caused. Henry desires a liason with the married noblewoman, Mary as she nurses him. They both become ladies-in-waiting to Queen Catherine(Ana Torrent).
 Elizabeth Howard ( played by Kristin Scott-Thomas with the  reputedly blonde good looks of the Howard family), expresses her disapproval as the sexual and political intrigues involving her children begin, and then escalate, but is sadly ignored. Under the scheming machinations of her Uncle, the Duke of Norfolk(David Morrissey), Mary becomes King Henry's mistress, and bears him a son.
 We deal with the inaccuaracy of Anne marrying her sweetheart Henry Percy(OliverColeman), when, in fact, she was only betrothed to him. Confiding the news of her marriage to her brother, George(Jim Sturgess), George tells Mary, who reports this to her father and uncle due to fear that Anne's marrying a prominent nobleman without the King's permission will  compromise the family. Anne has her marriage annuled and is exiled to France.
 Mary's pregnancy by the King leads to the increased wealth of her family at the King's pleasure. We observe the ritual of her confinement when the pregnancy becomes a high risk one.
 Norfok has his other niece returned home to help keep the King's attention from wandering to other mistresses, but ultimately this backfires, and as  Mary gives birth to her son, Henry, the King's attention turns to Anne, and they two begin to plot to dislodge Queen Katherine, who can no longer give the King a son.
 Mary, who is widowed by this point is sent to the country to live with her child. Eventually, she will marry the kindly William Stafford(Eddie Redmayne), who offers her security and a peaceful life away from court intrigues.
 Amid the annoying array of inaccuacies is the scene of The King raping Anne after  he has broken with Rome, declared himself the Head of the Church of England, and exiled Catherine after she still refuses to consumate their relationship.
 Anne and Henry marry, and  Anne is coronated, and the latter gives birth to a daughter, Elizabeth, much to Henry's dismay. A second child -- a boy--- is stillborn--leading the desperate queen to consider incest with George(which history relates was a fabrication) in the hope of the pretense of maintaining the pregancy, and hiding the miscarriage from the King for fear of being burned.
 But George's long neglected wife, Jane(Juno Temple), reports her suspicions, setting the events leading to the downfall of both George and Anne.
 As Mary's marriage to William Stafford earned her the ire of her family, as she did it with out permission, it is unlikely that she was present during her sister's miscarriage, or during Anne's final moments, or that she had any hand in rearing her niece, Elizabeth. But the emphasis is on the fact that ultimately, the lesser-acknowledged Boleyn sister led the happiest and most stress-free life of any of the Boleyn siblings, outliving all members of her immediate family.
 What this tale lacks in accuracy, it makes up for in being a cautionary tale about the tragically high price of glory.",1508889600,,4868,5.138149556400507

3169711,2,B0017APPSE,"Do you love history? Ever feel like you want to bang your head against the wall repeatedly? Then this is the movie for you!!! I know this is based on a book and maybe this was how Philippa Gregory thought history happened but she could have easily picked up any history book from this time period to find out what actually happened based on many different scholars. While we don't really know the interpersonal relationship between the two sisters, most historians agree Mary Boleyn was the elder sister. Based on Natalie Portman's character I have to assume Philippa really hated Anne Boleyn and wrote her book around that premise and Hollywood agreed it would make a great movie. Which I respectfully disagree, the pacing was fast and as far as characterization what I got from the movie was this; Mary was a sweetheart, King Henry hated Anne, Anne was a bit of a sociopath and a witch that starts with a B and apparently rape was thrown in there for some reason. I however do have one good thing to say about this movie....at least the dresses had Tudor bell sleeves! That's why I gave it two stars instead of one. If you like this movie great but it definitely isn't for me or anyone that loves this period and historical accuracy.

Editing: To say I was looking through the other reviews and apparently it's based off a historical fiction book so I can give it some leeway, however I still feel the pacing was off, everything happened so quickly and unless you know history this movie would be very confusing.",1496880000,,1514,4.586715867158672

3169761,5,B0017APPSE,"How many times has the Ann Boleyn and Henry VIII story been told? Yet, still we are fascinated by the people and circumstances. This particular version has some new twists which involve, as the title indicates, the other Boleyn girl, Mary... sister of Ann, who consented to being Henry's mistress prior to his meeting with, courtship of and marriage to Ann. In this movie, we again follow the emotional roller-coaster as allegedly refined members of royal and aristocratic birth manipulate one another to each individual's own selfish and deadly ends. What elevates ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" above other recent recountings is the phenomenal talent of Natalie Portman as the ill-fated Ann Boleyn. Commendable performances are also given by Eric Bana as Henry VIII and Scarlett Johansson as Mary Boleyn. Even though we know from the beginning Ann's eventual fate, Portman recreates that horrible moment with such depth of feeling it brought tears to this old man's eyes.

I'm living and working in China now, and have time in the evenings to rent and watch movies, so I'm catching up!  As a writer and literature teacher, I always focus on the story.  I loved the Anne Boleyn character and how she stood strong despite having a king pursue her.  She refused to give in to him unless he married her.  It was sad to see how her and Mary's father ""pimped out"" his daughters.  Perhaps in those days, that is how it was.  But he still seemed like a caring father.

The only redeeming qualities in this movie are the absolutely amazing costumes, occasional witty lines, and a story that is a kind of dark fairy tale-- good girls stay alive, man-stealing witches end up in trouble etc. The story reminds me of some of the horrible sources Shakespeare used to create some of his greatest works of literature--- the best we can hope for is someday a talented mind will use the potential in this plot and edit out the trash that overwhelms it in its current state.

3170073,4,B0017APPSE,"Actually, I picked up this movie by mistake but was pleasantly pleased once I begin to take a closer look at the story. I have always wondered how  Queen Elizabeth came into position in a male-dominated world especially in the English culture.

This movie had a lot of twists and turns incorporating several inappropriate sexual encounters including betrayal, jealousy, and corruption.  Mary (played by Scarlett Johansson) is the younger sister of Anne (played by Natalie Portman) that experiences a life of normalcy considering during that time.  Young girls were positioned to marry or commit adultery in order to improve their family's wealth and lifestyle.  Mary is chosen to commit adultery with Henry VIII to improve her family's wealth.

Anne, on the other hand,  is jealous of this decision and sees the love that Henry VIII feels for her younger sister, Mary, so she wants it for herself.  Anne would stop at nothing to be on a quest to trump her sister.  Anne begins to weave a life of treason and malice just to get in the position as queen along the side of Henry VIII.  Anne believes that as queen she will be able to receive the revenge, love, respect, and honor that she is desiring.  The irony is that there is already a queen alongside Henry VIII but this doesn't stop her.  Anne sets out on a quest to destroy her sister, Mary; Henry VIII's wife, the queen and anyone in her path to be in this position as queen.

During Mary's relationship with Henry VIII, a male child is born, this child is set as an heir to the king.  Anne wants to supersede her sister by giving birth to a male child.  For Anne nothing goes right, karma can be a _________, she does give birth but not to a son, but a daughter.  Anne does not want to be a parent to the child and eventually she has no choice but little does she or Henry VIII knows is that this child, a daughter will be the reign of the king, known as Queen Elizabeth.",1454630400,,1927,4.478510028653295

The acting is solid, the costumes are pretty cool (extra points for King Henry's excessive shoulder pads obsession), and Ana Torrente takes the cake for best ""screw-you, you-home-wrecking-harlot"" speech I've seen in a while, but there's only so much whiskey in one's cabinet to detract from having to watch Eric Bana parade around in Peter Pan tights while being a total-but-not-believable douche-nozzle for 2 hours.",1442448000,,901,5.397163120567376

3170307,5,B0017APPSE,"I think the real star of this version of the most popular and intricately detailed saga of the embattled triumvirate of King Henry VIII, Catherine of Aragon and Anne Bolelyn is the director Justin Chadwick. He navigates the difficulties of a script that depicts a uniquely different perspective of the this infamously provocative story with the skill of a master craftsman.

Mr. Chadwick displays insightful and finely honed skills that distinguish him as a director approaching the celebrity of his predecessor, William Wyler with whom he shares an impressive intuitive understanding of how to use the talents of the various actors to best advantage.
He's got the ""eye"", a phrase often attributed to gifted individuals distinguished by their laudable artistic accomplishments.

The film is concise and devoid of unnecessarily frivolities and ponderous dialogue that beleaguer too many retellings of what is perhaps the most interesting aspect of Henry's quest for a male heir.

Mr. Bana spares us the bellowing histrionic tirades and effectively communicates the full spectrum of the king's emotions with a quiet inner strength that is most effectively and impressively conveyed through his facial expressions and subtle manner of speech; although the inference of subtlety in no way suggests that the meaning of the King's directives and intent are any less menacing or lack the vehement decisiveness that characterized the personae of Henry VIII.

Natalie Portman provides a commendably convincing performance as Anne Boleyn; depicting the important and often ignored portrayal of Anne's evolution from that of an intelligent but willful young girl; unsophisticated and ignorant in the ways of court life to a young woman, wise in the ways of guile and deceptive manipulation upon her return from the French Court.
Her scene of near maniacal desperation, suggesting that she commit an act of incest with her brother George in order to conceive a male heir, is riveting; although the heinous suggestion is refused by George; although as ill fortune would have it, witnessed by a maid servant eager to keep her head and betrays brother and sister.

Scarlett Johansson is almost portrayed as being ""too good to be true""; a hapless pawn of her ambitious family; who receives gentle connubial attentions from King Henry and bears him an illegitimate son. Ms. Johansson, through her own considerable acting talents is able to rescue this character through her decisively strident protestations of unwillingness to take part in Court life and abandon her marital loyalties to her husband who served in the king's royal privy chamber.
This is a particularly difficult role and script because it is fraught with so many suggestions that are devoid of conclusively verifiable facts and rife with assumptions and convenient contrivances for the sake of the film.
The precise details of Mary Boleyn's life are sketchy at best, thus serving as a convenient vehicle for examining the Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn story from a refreshingly new and provocative perspective.

The production values are mercifully restrained although not without some degree of embellishment, but just enough to convey the privilege and status of the various participants of the illustrious court.",1431561600,,3263,5.313953488372093

3170317,3,B0017APPSE,"This is useful to watch as backstory for Wolf Hall, but it takes the melodrama a bit far. Natalie Portman is suitably repellent as Anne Boleyn, and you don't much regret the bad end she comes to. Scarlett Johanssen is sublimely gorgeous (and some of her costumes are stunning), but cast in a pretty passive role here. In general, an awful lot goes unexplained (for a country and time so obsessed with the issue of divorce for the king, other people seem able to get married and unmarried at the merest whim). It's interesting to watch Mark Rylance play father Boleyn here, not nearly as meaty a role as Thomas Cromwell.",1430352000,,619,4.585585585585585

3170323,2,B0017APPSE,"Though beautifully filmed, this narrative fails as plausible.

Loosely based on the tensions from Henry's first wife, Katherine of Aragon, unable to leave him a male heir, it bears little resemblance to the true events in the court of Henry Vlll relating to his relationship to Anne Boleyn and her sister, Anne's trial, her imprisonment, and other matters of state during this period. Examples of playing fast and loose with the actual historical facts are too numerous to mention......(BUT... both Anne and Mary spent their most of their young lives in the courts of France before meeting Henry, Anne never married Percy, she spent 13 years in the Tower not the mere months shown here.  Etc. etc.).

Artistic license could be excused if the essence of the tale were comprehensible. But the viewer is clearly asked to resent Anne's conniving ways for 90% of the piece and then sympathize with her as she faces a charge for an act of incest that she orchestrated but was not consummated only from her brother's resistance. Brave speeches and pseudo-meaningful moments between sisters with no justification for them since one, Anne, has done nothing but act self-servingly against the other, Mary, for the entirety of the film. Somehow shown as a victim at the end, Anne has done nothing but manipulate her way for her own benefit through the entire seamy story. Typically, all of the characters are one dimensional caricatures.

Has the look of a great period piece but little of the substance to make it so. Fancy costumes, good lighting, and numerous of scenes men and women charging anxiously down Tudor castle hallways to deliver messages does not good drama make.",1429488000,,1667,4.942857142857143

3170332,1,B0017APPSE,"I'm a huge fan of anything that accurately depicts this era of english history, but this was just a shallow, vapid movie that took too many liberties and wasn't historically accurate.  Natalie Portman is such a weak actress; I feared she wouldn't have what it took to portray Anne Bolelyn with any spice, and, sadly, I was right - she's no Anne Boleyn and she's no Natalie Dormer, either (who did a fantastic job as Anne Boleyn in The Tudors).  Scarlett Johansson did a decent job of portraying Mary, but the character development just wasn't there for her either, so despite that she was the best actress in the film, I had no feeling about her character either way. Henry VIII was cast as a minor player - an aside, really.  While you may want to make a movie featuring the sisters, you really can't cast Henry VIII aside, for without him and his madness, the sisters wouldn't have been relevant. I was attached to no one in the film and was moved by nothing that happened, not the optimal movie experience. I can highly recommend Elizabeth I (with Helen Mirren), The Tudors, and Elizabeth The Virgin Queen (with Anne-Marie Duff), but just not this.  Please, not this.",1427328000,,1170,4.610576923076923

Granted, they had to fit it into a movie somehow. I was disappointed watching it again after reading the novel though. Best part of the movie is Scarlett Johansson as Mary.

Anne, in the movie, is portrayed as a woman who slithers her way into a royal marriage.  If the real Anne did the same, I do not know.

3170412,2,B0017APPSE,"Well, ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" does have exquisite production values, and all the actors and actresses give outstanding and passionately heartfelt performances. Here's the problem: this film, like the book on which it is based, is extremely - and I do mean EXTREMELY - inaccurate. The book's author, Philippa Gregory, took huge and numerous liberties with historical facts, and unfortunately, the inaccuracies are carried over into this film.  Some might say the inaccuracies don't matter as long as the movie is well-made - but that's stupid; it really does matter, because facts are...well...you know...facts.

And why, just WHY, can they not hire an actor with red hair to portray Henry VIII?  After all, Henry really was a redhead. Is it that evil to be historically accurate?  *sigh* Well, if you're looking for nothing more than a glamorous costume movie with lots of high drama, then ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" is for you - but if you want an accurate depiction of Henry VIII and his women, look someplace else.  (I would suggest the BBC miniseries ""The Six Wives Of Henry VIII"" or even ""Anne Of The Thousand Days"", which is worth watching for the brilliant performance by Genevive Bujold in the title role as Anne Boleyn.)",1407628800,,1226,4.932038834951456

3170425,1,B0017APPSE,"Like some others here, I wonder what if some people see this mess and think this is what really happened?

I realize that rewriting history for dramatic and political effect goes back to at least Shakespeare, and I have been known to complain loudly about his Richard III, but it is hard to see any legitimate motivation for this mess of historical inaccuracy.

Only the costuming and scenery seems at all accurate. It is not even consistent with the novel upon which it is loosely based.  ( For the record Anne did wear the necklace complained of above with the large B around her neck.)

This rendition ignores Mary's daughter, also probably Henry's and thus her descendent Essex later weak claim to the throne, and also ignores several mistresses following Mary before Anne became part of the story.

While it would be nice to think that Lady Boleyn objected to using her children in this way to advance the family and then the loss of two of them, there is no evidence for this at all.

While the ambition of Anne and Mary's uncle, the Duke of Norfolk is well portrayed (later he pimps another niece, Katherine Howard, forward to Henry's bed, being queen, and then to her death by beheading as well), he was hardly the only one, and Wolsey is not even mentioned and Cromwell is only a footnote.

The film's ending does hint at the delicious irony that in his mad quest for a male heir, Henry misses that he has fathered the greatest ruler of all in Elizabeth.

The actresses are lovely, but what a waste of time.",1401062400,,1516,4.547794117647059

It is pathetically bad. Doesn't follow the story line from the book at all. The overall tone is the same the whole time. Like just DULL. There is no build up, not strong emotional connections, nothing. The casting is terrible. I absolutely loved Stafford in the book but he was such a disappointment. Childish and unattractive. The book was so intense and passionate and this was so boring I could barely watch. I just don't understand why they changed it from the book so much.",1397865600,,634,4.38135593220339
3170433,3,B0017APPSE,"This version rings slightly truer than Anne of the Thousand Days of 40 years ago.  Natalie Portman is slightly more believable as Anne, and Scarlett Johannsen is an acceptable Mary.  A pleasant surprise was Benedict Cumberbatch in an all-too-brief appearance as William Carey, the husband that made it possible for Henry to consort with Mary; after all, it would have been unseemly had she been unwed, wouldn't it?  But wait--her sister was unwed!
The actor portraying Henry did a much better job than Jonathan Rhys-Meyers in the Showtime series (JRM was simply too young to make a believable Henry after about the first episode; by the time the real Henry was 40--about the time that Anne and he finally marry--his looks and both his physical and mental health began a rapid slide downward).
Like all the film renditions of this piece of Tudor history  The Other Boleyn Girl takes a great deal of license with the facts.  (for example, the film ends with the implication that Mary and her new husband raise the toddler Elizabeth with Mary's other children; the future queen spent her childhood and adolescence in various castles, looked after by just about everyone but family members).  I suspect the film was made to capitalize on the celebrity of the two leading ladies

3170471,1,B0017APPSE,"First off, I'm going to say that I am a huge Eric Bana fan (hello, Munich?!). I also have enjoyed most of Natalie Portman's films. Now that the niceties are over- this is one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. And by far the worst ""historical"" movie I've seen, ever. Period. Almost no part of this film was accurate. Henry raping Anne? Are you serious? Mary storming through the palace after Anne's death to claim the baby Elizabeth? Again, really? This film is a wayward attempt at feminism. Sure, we can pretend that Mary was a jilted lover, we can pretend that Anne was raped and then conceived her daughter. But why lie? Why portray Mary as such a heroine ( she had limited involvement with the king outside his bedchamber), and Anne as such a deviant (she being the one who kept her legs close for YEARS before they were married). Why flip this story into something it never was, and honestly far less interesting? Also, the costumes are embarrassing at best. They remind me of cheap ""Renaissance Faire"" garb that you can buy for a couple hundred bucks at your local Halloween shop. Where are all the fabulous gowns and jewels that Henry bestowed upon Anne for years before their marriage? Frankly, she looks homely for most of the film. Anyway, if you are looking for a good watch about Anne, or Henry, I recommend The Tudors (offered on Prime for FREE)- it is LUSH and SEXY. Natalie Dormer LIVES and BREATHES the essence of Anne Boleyn. Sorry Miss Portman, you were better as a Black Swan!",1375833600,,1507,4.523809523809524
3170472,3,B0017APPSE,"Too many facts fall by the wayside in this version of the Boleyn sisters and King Henry the VIII. True, Natalie Portman resembles portraits of the real Anne Boleyn but Scarlett Johansson looks too young and beautiful when compared to portraits of the real Mary Boleyn. Meanwhile, Eric Bana as Henry remains svelte and muscular looking throughout the movie. In real life, by the time the king was enmeshed with the sisters, he was already bloated, well on his way to obesity.
The tight focus on these 3 characters also leaves out pertinent facts. While the film belabors Anne's alleged incest with her brother and their resulting executions, it ignores the fact that 4 other men were also tried on charges of adultery with the queen and executed. To add to the drama, Mary is shown returning from banishment from the royal court to plead with the king to spare Anne. In reality, she never returned after her banishment.
But at least some of the palace intrigue that really existed is brought to light. The scene of Queen Catherine of Aragon, Henry's first wife, confronting ""the Boleyn whores"" is classic. Their looks of utter surprise and hurt after being called out and subsequent anger were the best of many such expressions sprinkled throughout. And the emphasis of various court officials scheming and manipulating on the sidelines as they try to steer the king's many whims in directions favorable to themselves and supposedly beneficial for England reflect the shenanigans that continue on in halls of power to this day.",1375660800,,1526,4.9186046511627906

The list of outright distortions is endless so I'll stick to my favorite: Anne is ""banished"" to the French court as a bungling, unsophisticated young woman and returns a mere two months later (a) speaking fluent French, (b) possessing Machiavellian political skills, and (c) capable of enchanting and maneuvering every man at court, including Henry.  Really?  Really?

Although it purports (I believe) to make use of Retha Warnicke's scholarship, the conclusions that this movie reaches are cringe-inducing.  I'm pretty flexible with my Tudor fiction (I loved The Tudors with Jonathan Rhys Meyers), this movie is beyond the pale.

As much as I love Natalie Portman in other things, she really missed the mark in this movie.  Eric Bana was a non-entity.  Scarlett Johansen was probably my favorite part, but of course you could characterize Mary Boleyn Carey Stafford in just about any way since so little is known about her.

3170491,3,B0017APPSE,"THE OTHER BOLEYN GIRL suffers from overexposure to the passion for all things Tudor that has produced multiple novels, television series, and films that range from great to mediocre. Having not read Philippa Gregory's best selling novel, this viewer watched the DVD without preconceived notions of the path the story would take/stray in the wake of heightened interest in historical data. From the opening scenes to the end the impression is one of having viewed some very beautiful scenery, sumptuous costumes, grand lighting - and very little involvement in caring for the plight of the characters. The soggy music score underlines the unrelenting dark atmosphere of the story and the production, and despite a cast of actors known for credibility in historic roles, there is little compassion stirred.

King Henry VIII (Eric Bana, in relatively little screen time) tires of Katherine of Aragon (Ana Torent) and her inability to bear a male heir. The Boleyn clan (Mark Rylance and Kristin Scott Thomas in collusion with the Duke of Norfolk (David Morrissey) seize on Henry's frustration and serve up their daughters Anne (Natalie Portman) and Mary (Scarlett Johansson) to satisfy his dalliances. The younger Mary beds him first, does produce a son, but falls out of favor leaving Anne to work her newly honed skills of feminism learned during her exile in France on the easily seduced King to become his queen, yet is able to only bear him a daughter, Elizabeth. The results are tension in the castle, in the Boleyn family, and between the sisters Anne and Mary. History is molded by the writer to maintain more of a Hollywood soap opera that a recreation of fact and it all ends with beheadings and the child Elizabeth running gaily through sunny old meadows of England.

The actors all try to make us buy into this version of betrayal and lust and loathing, but the dialog (written by Peter Morgan) is tired and used and anything but in keeping with the period. But then, the movie is a collection of scenes that are very pretty to watch... Justin Chadwick directs. Grady Harp, February 13",1361059200,,2093,4.909604519774011

Their competition leads to bitter rivalry, hatred and jealousy, not to mention the reshaping of an Empire's history. The King desires a male heir, but his current Queen cannot produce one. After taking Anne as his mistress, he is yet to have a son. Now with many daughters, King Henry decides to court Mary Boleyn. Mary provides a boy heir for him. Now with the Queen and the mistress out of the picture, King Henry needs an excuse to marry Mary. He has to change the national religion.

3170503,1,B0017APPSE,"Where do I even start? I understand that everything in a film can't be accurate, but there are so many things wrong with this movie, I can't even begin to remember them all. Is it really necessary to just change the story like this?
In an attempt to educate those of you who are unfamiliar with Tudor history, I will try to outline the many inaccuracies of this movie.

1. Anne is in fact younger than Mary. I can only assume that their ages were reversed in the film to make Mary appear like the oppressed younger sister.

2. Mary was not an angel. She was in fact called a prostitute before she even came to Henry because of her exploits with the French king.

3. Henry was interested in Mary first, NOT Anne, as the film implies. Anne was very young at the time her sister first started her affair with Henry.

4. Henry did not ""rape"" Anne. Why on earth would he go to such great extents to respect her wishes to remain pure before marriage and not have sex with her only to ruin all of that in the end by completely disrespecting her.

5. Catherine of Aragon's representation in this film made me ill. She looks like a stuck up old bitch. I didn't feel sorry for her at all (which made me sad because she is quite a tragic figure). She was also a strong woman, and this movie makes her look woefully insecure. Don't even get me started on the mole...very distracting.

6. We can be 99.999% sure that George and Anne did not even attempt to have sex with each other. This was just part of Henry's propaganda to justify getting rid of Anne, and apparently the creators of this film have fallen for it.

7. This isn't an inaccuracy so much as an annoyance. Henry pretty much starts hating Anne right after he gets married to her. After trying for years to get her, you'd think he'd be happy with her for at least a little while.

8. Anne supposedly had five lovers (including her brother) according to Henry. All (except for George) were left out of the story. How can you blatantly leave out 4 people??! I understand the time restrictions, but honestly, if they would have spent a little less time on stupid crap (like that hunting scene where Henry gets hurt) and a little more time on stuff that ACTUALLY HAPPENED, maybe then they could have included it.

9. What is with Henry promising Mary that he'll free Anne at the end?? This is YET ANOTHER ATTEMPT to make Mary look like the good, poor, put-upon, little sister *barf*.

10. Elizabeth is supposed to be almost 3 years old at the time of her mother's death, but she still looks like a baby at the end of the film.

11. Mary actually had two children, a girl (born first), and then a boy. It is questionable whether they were even Henry's kids.

12. Oh yes...Cromwell and Wolsey...where were they??! I can't believe two such important historical figures who were instrumental in Henry's divorce were completely ignored and left out of this movie. Unbelievable. Would it really have been so hard to at least just mention them???

There were other things, but I can't remember them all right now, and I haven't watched the film in a while. This film had good potential, but the story was mutilated and the script was dreadful. I love Eric Bana and Natalie Portman, but I HATED them in this film. I am very sorry to everyone who knows nothing about the Tudors and then goes to see this film. Far too many people take it at face value and come out spewing all kinds of crap about how ""evil"" Anne was and how Henry should never have ""raped"" her. This movie should definitely be called The Other Boleyn Girl: A Story Vaguely Based on History.",1352073600,,3594,4.410876132930514

The first time I watched it, I was shocked at how much they'd left out, and how fast the storyline moved forward.  I would have rated it 3 stars if I hadn't watched it again.

Original story aside, the movie is very well done and the costuming is beautiful. Who would have thought that I'd think Henry VIII is sexy?  Nice choice of actor for that role.  Watching it a second time, for those who haven't read the book, will allow you catch more of the subtleties (sp?) that explain the actions of the players.  They're easy to miss on the first run through because you're following the broader storyline instead.

Benedict Cumberbatch is William Carey, husband of the beautiful Mary played by Scarlett Johansson...he actually resembles a painting of William Carey.

It ran 2 hours with no commercials so I don't know if anything was edited out. I watched The Tudors tv series and subsequently have read quite a bit about that era. I know the Tudors was somewhat inaccurate - especially with the portrayal of Henry as a young viril man well into his 40s- but it was far superior to this movie. Of course, it is easier to develop characters, plots and timelines over the course of a 4 year series than in a 2 hour movie. However, the major events of the story are barely touched upon in TOBG. The timeline is wrong. It has Henry hating Anne almost on their wedding day, when actually his disappointment in her didn't occur until after Elizabeth was born. And at the end, Mary takes Elizabeth to raise. Elizabeth is portrayed as an infant when we know that she was 3 when Anne died. Plus, there is nothing I've read to indicate that Mary actually raised Elizabeth. Many other reviews have already pointed out the many other historical inaccuracies so I will not repeat.

I am so tired of filmmakers remaking films that are already great. This movie is horrible. It's incredibly boring that you can't sit through it at once. The acting is draggy and laughable. I am sorry but a lot of today's so-called hot actors don't have the range or the talent to attempt something like this. Scarlett Johnansson and Natalie Portman might do well with a modern-day romantic comedy but they do not have the chops for a film like this. It's laughable to see them step in the shoes of all the great actresses who have played these roles. I mean no disrespect to these ladies but this film was over their heads. To me I didn't see them as the parts of Mary and Anne but as replicas of the actresses who'd played them in the past. I got the sense that Natalie and Scarlett were just trying to imitate the actresses who played these roles before, not truly conveying Mary and Anne as people.

Eric Bana was the best actor in the film AND the king yet showed less than anyone.

I don't even have the interest to go into what I didn't like about this movie because it was so pitiful. If you want to see the REAL deal when it comes to the legend behind this movie check out the amazing classics that got the job done:

Anne of a Thousand Days

Mary, Queen of Scotts

And for great modern-day period films in general check out Cate Blanchett in the Elizabeth series. Now that's acting!

As for The Other Boleyn Girl, it takes more than fake accents and dressing up in old century clothes to get the job done. Obviously the filmmakers of this movie went with who was popular, not the best talent.",1337212800,,1872,4.408695652173913

3170522,4,B0017APPSE,"This is an interesting ""take"" on the famous / infamous love affair between Henry VIII and his mistress & future queen, Anne Boleyn.  The central figure in the story is her sister, Mary (portrayed by Scarlett Johansson).  While everyone is @ least vaguely aware of Henry & Anne, the same cannot be said of Henry & Mary.  And yes, Mary and the English King has their own sexual liasons.

Anne (Natalie Portman) is depicted as a very deceitful & conniving femme fatale in the present movie.  Her's is quite a controversial persona as the opinions of her have gone the full spectrum in the minds of various historians.  Or, to put it another way, there are probably as many differing views of Anne Boleyn as there are Medieval historians!

Eric Bana is a solid choice to play King Henry.  Some may say he's too debonair & buffed to play Henry VIII, but this is simply not true.  Most people know Henry as the fatso he became in his latter years, but in the early yrs of his reign he was known as being a very dashing and athletic fellow.  Bana even looks a bit like him in a few of the sequences.

***WARNING:  THIS MOVIE MAY LEAD TO SENSORY OVERLOAD IN THE SCENES IN WHICH NATALIE PORTMAN & SCARLETT JOHANSSON ARE BOTH ON THE SCREEN TOGETHER.  I had to keep a defibrillator by my couch while viewing the DVD ~ just in case.  Guess I'm getting old.

The main ""problem"" with the present film is not with the acting, directing or the point-of-view of the story that it takes.  Rather, the difficulty lies with just how big a historical chunk that it's trying to bite-off in a very limited amount of time.  As such, it glosses over an awful lot & omits even more.  What the film-makers tried to do was the theatrical equivalent of fitting a cruise ship into a 2 stall garage.

With that in mind, if you want a more ambitious & thorough rendition of what is really going on, I would HIGHLY recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Tudors-The-Complete-Series/dp/B0042RJWTC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Tudors: The Complete Series</a>.

3170523,1,B0017APPSE,"I remember three years ago when I saw this movie with my mom and we were meeting a couple of friends to see it too. I had high hopes for this movie but was sadly disappointed. It was the worst movie about Anne Boleyn, Mary Boleyn and Henry the 8th I ever saw. It wasn't even historaclly accurate. First of all Anne was the younger sister not Mary. And the acting was kind of bad too. And there was a scene where Henry the 8th raped Anne Boleyn. Really? I know Henry the 8th was a womanizer and a tyrant but COME ON!!! A rape scene people? That never happened!!! And the scene where Anne and her brother were going to commit incest that was just a rumor Henry made up so he can marry Jane Seymore. That was just hollywood trying make it better. Instead they made it even worse. The ending was really strange too. At the end Mary takes Annes little baby daughter Elizabet and raises her when in real life Elizabeth always lived in a seperate palace and only saw her father when he requested her prescence so she like her other siblings lived lonely lives. And I don't think Elizabeth was allowed to visit her mothers family. If you want a good historical movie or show that most or all of it is historically accurate watch the 2003 BBC version of The Other Boleyn Girl and watch the Tudors that was on Showtime. The Tudors and that movie are what really stick to the truth of what really happened. Don't watch this garbage! The only good part of this movie was that Eric Bana, the man who played Henry the 8th was very sexy and we got to see him take his shirt off but other wise thats it.",1319587200,,1587,4.223684210526316
3170524,3,B0017APPSE,"So I'm not a historian.  And as such I don't really notice the historical inaccuracies in this movie or in the book its based off of.  That being said, I did notice how much they changed the movie from the book, which was rather irritating.

The Boleyn family has long been favorites at court.  So when little Mary Boleyn, newly married, attracts the eye of the King, she is forced to play his mistress but falls in love while doing so.  But he is easily distracted and while she lays in childbed, her sister Anne becomes his new favorite.  But Anne isn't content to merely be a mistress, she wants to be Queen.  She'll push King Henry to the limit for his desires and plays a dangerous game while doing so.  Mary, and her brother George, are also caught up in Anne's plan as these three Boleyns seek ambition far above them.

Characters:
Natalie Portman: Anne Boleyn
Scarlett Johannson: Mary Boleyn
Eric Bana: Henry VIII
Jim Sturgess: George Boleyn

I think that most of the characters were well cast in this film.  Portman and Johannson were great as the Boleyn sisters and even did the sibling rivalry thing quite well.  I'm used to Johannson in tougher roles so to see her a bit meeker in this role as Mary was unusual for me.  But she still played it well.  Their brother George, while a big part in the book, had a smaller role in the movie, but I thought Jim Sturgess did a good job of making him the light hearted sibling.  The only character I really have a complaint about is Eric Bana as Henry.  His acting was ok, but Henry was always described as a Golden King and Prince.  Eric Bana is dark haired and not very jovial.  In other words, he wasn't King Henry VIII.

As stated before the movie only partially followed the book.  They left out quite a few important details and I don't think it did them any favors.  I do realize that the passage of time that happens in the book couldn't happen in the movie, but that also kind of ruined things for me too since the timeline was too rushed.  The actual movie was shot well and the scenery was very nice.  I was impressed by the settings of the castles and inside the castles as it seemed very authentic.  The music was ok, but nothing that really made you stand up and take notice which is just as well since this is more of a drama than any other type of movie.

I do have to make mention of a few scenes in this book because those viewers with a weaker constitution may not find them appropriate.  While no naughty bits are actually shown, there are a couple of sex scenes and a rape scene within this movie.  Consider yourself warned if you can't stand such things.

It wasn't a bad movie but it could have been much improved on.  If they make another one of Gregory's books into a movie I just may check it out.

3170526,2,B0017APPSE,"This is one of those movies that could and should have been great. After all, it has a phenomenal cast, is adapted from a best selling novel, and has lush costumes and settings. The reality, however, is that those elements are not enough to carry this film as the script and storyline is severely lacking.

For those not familiar with the book this is adapted from, The Other Boleyn Girl is actually about BOTH Boleyn Girls. It starts with Mary but eventually follows her more notorious sister, Anne, as they climb up the social ladder in Tudor England. Their king and the object of both of their affections is King Henry VIII. While history remembers Henry as having six wives, at the start of the film he is still married to his first, Catherine of Aragon, and it is the Boleyn sisters who start him on a journey that will change England forever.

One of the aspects that makes this film so painful to watch is the gross historical inaccuracies, much of which is the fault of the script. The scene where Henry and Anne finally, uh, consummate their relationship is so infuriating for someone who knows the real backstory and gives people who aren't familiar with it an untrue portrayal of this famous couple.",1316563200,,1210,4.623255813953488

The Tudors like Elizabeth both used poetic license BUT with superior writing and a stronger reference to history.  Mary Boleyn was not the quiet, virginal (I don't want to go to court) girl portrayed in this film.

Eric Bana is pure eye candy and the costumes are well done.  After that there isn't much more to recommend this film.  I did read the book and also found it to be poorly written fiction.",1316563200,,622,4.460176991150442

3170532,1,B0017APPSE,"I devoured Phillipa Gregory's ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" and was excited to then watch the movie.

I was so very disappointed.

The movie is basically only about the fact that Henry needs an heir.

It barely touches on the great measures he takes to gain one. (Forcing his current wife into exile til he can marry Anne, claiming his first marriage was invalid, his separation from Rome and the Pope, setting forth new laws to suit his own needs, the Oath of Succession (after Elizabeth is born) and the fact that Henry put to death anyone who refused (even his good friends)).
None of that was really touched on in the movie at all. The separation from Rome was merely mentioned in passing.

It hardly touched on how tortured and desparate Anne is to give Henry a son.
The bitter rivalry between Mary and Anne is hardly felt at all.
And the time just flies. Anne managed to keep Henry's eyes on just her for many years, but in this movie it seems as if just days had passed. There is no showing of time passed.

Lots of other interesting stuff was left out of the movie, making it very dull to me.
To mention a few: ****BOOK SPOILERS!*****
The fact that Mary bore Henry two children before he moved onto Anne.
The ""monster"" baby that was born to Anne after she supposedly slept with her brother to conceive a son (which she was sure Henry could not.), which then led to her downfall, trial, and then death.
Anne being so desperate, and unfeeling towards Mary, that she adopts Mary's son out from under her.
Mary finding true love with William Stafford and the drama that that relationship caused.
George's hidden homosexual love life.
How the Howards and Boleyns treated Mary and Anne as if they were nothing more than pawns, and had no cares about their wishes or feelings.
Henry moving onto Jane Seymore when Anne was so desperately trying to hold onto him and give him a son.
I could go on forever.....

Bottome line, the good stuff in the story was all removed for this movie and we were left only the most basic of details.

No feeling, no emotion, no richness, etc.
Everything was just so glossed over.

I would not recommend this movie.
Book or no book.

3170533,2,B0017APPSE,"What I liked about this movie is beautiful costumes, scenery, castles, etc. What I didn't, that many historical facts were missrepresented. Mary didn't visit her sister before her death; even though Anne was accused of incest, that was just a way for the king to marry his mistress with hopes to have a male heir. The king is shown as a guy overcome with passion for the evil calculating woman, but he had his motives for the male legite son in mind, when he anulled his marriage to marry Anne. And he married a few times after that too. Ironically, he did get his male heir, but he died too early to actually rule- even though officially he was a king for a while.
  To sum up- too much drama, too little historic truth, but lots of beauty.",1308614400,,741,4.36231884057971
3170534,5,B0017APPSE,"Not only is this a pretty decent costume drama (check out the water wing sleeves on Henry VIII's clothes in some scenes) but it's amazingly a new take on arguably one of the England's most bizarre royals.

Now I don't quite understand how the entire nation of England cannot produce actors to play English historical figures but having an Australian (Eric Bana) and two Americans (Natalie Portman and Scarlett Johanssen) in the lead roles works out fine.

The Other Boleyn Girl is about the Boleyn sisters and is an incredibly overlooked part of British history (even if a lot of the ideas on their relationship with each other and Henry may be more in the author's mind than what actually may have happened) but all the more fascinating. Who'd have thought there was anything more to mine from the Henry VIII vaults but there was in this movie.

Needless to say you get all the court intrigue, backstabbing and sex on a stick. What makes it all the more fantastic are the elaborate detailed sets, the often Vermeer-like quality to the camera shots where we peer through doors, archways and any opening where light shines through to give a somewhat voyeuristic feel to many of the secrets of the court.

It's also a look at how badly women were treated back then (pretty as chattel) and how men manipulated women for political gain. Throw in the DVD extras which are superb. They include a look at what life was like for women in the Tudor age as well, a rundown of each central character and some more nuggets in which the actors, producers, director, the author of the book the movie is based on and some noted scholars throw in their two farthings' worth.

As far as reviews here that compare it to the book, these people need to watch the extras again as even the author says it would have been impossible to film the entire book and that the movie (which she loves) adds a bunch of necessary background needed prior to the Boleyn sisters entering court.",1304726400,,1958,4.598853868194842
3170535,3,B0017APPSE,"This is considered ""historical fiction"" - a fiction based on historical facts. It mainly concerns itself with the feelings of the Bolelyn family at the time of their greatest power and their rapid fall from grace. It is a very well told tale with 2 very solid performances from Portman and Johanson as the 2 Bolelyn sisters.
I don't mind speculating on how historical characters may have felt or their motivations or desires. Where I do object is when they alter the facts to create what they feel must be better drama:
-Mary had already been the mistress of the French king when she met Henry.
-Henry had in fact had many mistresses prior to Mary. So neither Henry nor Mary were the innocents at adultery portaryed in the movie.
-Henry was also an older and heavier man at this time than the character Bana portays. He had been married almost 25 years at that time.
So while this is a worthwhile movie that does get some of the facts right, I think it loses a bit when it tries to rewrite the facts. The facts alone are great drama. 3.5 Stars.",1301961600,,1044,4.442708333333333
3170536,4,B0017APPSE,"I have been watching The Tudors and decided to take a little side trip and watch The Other Boleyn Girl (Natalie Portman, Scarlett Johansson, Eric Bana) to get a feel for more of the Boleyn story.  Well, now I am completely confused.

Though both stories are dealing within the same period and the same basic characters, the two adaptations could not be any more different.  Now I understand poetic license, but when facts are toyed with, it leaves the watcher quite befuddled.

For instance, Mary Boleyn is referred to as the older sister in The Tudors and the younger sister in The Other Boleyn Girl, so off to Google to find out.  According to The House of Tudor, Mary is the older sister.  OK, The Tudors got this one right.  The Other Boleyn Girl tell of an illegitimate child that Mary bore during her time with Henry the VIII, The Tudor's doesn't comment on this.  This time to Wiki.  Apparently, Mary bore two children, but then again who is counting.  So I will give that one to The Other Boleyn Girl.  Now the most curious part, the end of The Other Boleyn Girl shows Mary taking the young Elizabeth and leaving Court to raise the child.  Really, does anyone think that was possible?  I thought Governess cared for her, but then people do like a happily ever after ending when dealing with royalty.

The more I look into the Tudor history, the more confused I get.  I understand that movie making is supposed to be fantasy, but how hard would it be to research what is ""known"" and go from there instead of making it up as you go.

Now back to the actual movie.  Overall, it is quite a stunning spectacle.  The costuming and staging are beautiful.  The casting is reasonable, though Henry should have been shorter and rounder, but then again who would want to see that.  I have also seen in some reviews that the sex scenes in The Other Boleyn Girl shocked people.  Well, if you are offended by that, which there really was not much shown, it is a PG-13 after all; I suggest that you completely bypass The Tudors.  That one will make you blush.

Unless you know some of the prior history of the time, you would have been lost in this movie.  The timing is a bit choppy, sort of like a Cliff Notes version of a small part of the Tudor Period.  If you are not looking for a history lesson you might like this movie, but just be warned that it is an adaptation of Philippa Gregory's historical fiction novel and not necessarily a work of fact.",1301961600,,2448,4.422818791946309

This follows the Boleyn family and their ambitions to make themselves powerful in the court of England.  If that means the daughters sleeping with the King or manipulating him for their own ends, then so be it.  This shows Mary, the gentler of the sisters, as she is seduced by the King and Anne's more ruthless manipulations to get into this good books and the throne of England.  The girls Uncle is seen to be the mastermind behind all of the manipulations and the girls would have done better not to have listened to him so closely.

I found the acting pretty good throughout and Johansson, Portman and Bana all give reasonable performances.  The father was a little wooden at times, but he isn't in the film enough to upset you too much.

This is a reasonable historical drama and if you take the facts with a pinch of salt and enjoy it for what it is, then you should enjoy this just fine.  Of course if the book is as good as some others here say, and you've read that first, you may have a different view on this, but coming to this as a stand alone film, it kept me entertained well enough.

There was perhaps no personal relationship that had more far reaching affects both geographically and historically than that of Henry Tudor and Anne Boleyn.  And clearly the person who dreamed up this nonsense never read a lick of history, for if they did they would know that Mary was a mistress to the French King before her return to England and was one of Henry's many mistresses while he was married to Katharine of Aragon.  Henry did have a son (whom he formally recognized) with a mistress, but it wasn't Mary Boleyn - it was Elizabeth ""Bessie"" Blount - another married subject like Mary.

3170545,1,B0017APPSE,"If you've read Gregory's book, you'll be disappointed in the many things that were left out of this film. If you've read a number of Tudor biographies and/or sources, as I and many of the audience with whom I saw this film had, you'll be in a major rage upon the film's conclusion.  Costuming and cinematography were very well done, but a pretty picture does not a pretty accurate movie make.

The best part of watching this film in it's entirety (twice if you're a glutton for punishment and nit-picking as I am) was the opportunity to start counting the number of historical mistakes and jumps to conclusion that were paid, undoubtably for 'dramatic purpose'. Among the most egregious:

1. Mary Boleyn did not enter her first marriage to William Carey an innocent virgin. She and Anne had both been at the French court (there goes another one. Anne was never exiled to the French Court; she went there directly from the court of Margaret of Austria. It was a position of prestige not dishonor). Mary was unfairly maligned as the Great Prostitute, but she had been the mistress of the French king. She was Anne's sexually experience, though probably naive OLDER sister.

2. Anne's betrothal to Henry Percy was NOT consummated nor did she trap him into a secret marriage.  Henry was a page in Cardinal Wolsey's household and Wolsey and Percy's father, the Duke of Northumberland opposed the union.  Henry was a member of the council that ultimately convicted Anne of treason and contemporary sources have found evidence that he bore the guilt of sending her to the block. He died in 1537 - a year after Anne's execution.

3. Speaking of Wolsey, where the hell was he?  He was Henry's Lord Chancellor AND the major figure during the trial to determine the validity of Henry's marriage to Catherine.

4. Henry was enough of a tyrant in his later years. There was no need to make him a rapist. That was just shockingly bad and unfounded.

5. Anne and George did NOT commit incest. I hated this in the book and hated it on screen.  Tudor scholars are almost entirely in accordance that the charges against Anne, Sir Henry Norris, Sir Francis Weston, Sir William Brereton, and Mark Smeaton were all fabricated with the only evidence presented in court the confession of Mark Smeaton (this gotten after torture).

5. At Anne's trial, the onlookers were stunned by the verdict.  Even Eustace Chapuys, the Spanish ambassador and fervent supporter of Catherine of Aragon believed she would be found innocent. In the film, it was a forgone conclusion that she would be found guilty.  Cromwell was the major player behind the scenes and instrumental in the determination of Anne's guilt.

6. Speaking of Cromwell, where the hell was he?  Again a MAJOR character isn't even given a cameo role. The man was Henry's Lord Great Chamberlain!

7. Anne's final words before her execution in real life contained NO admission or allusion of guilt.  They were 'Good Christian people, I am come hither to die, for according to the law, and by the law I am judged to die, and therefore I will speak nothing against it.  I am come hither to accuse no man, nor to speak anything of that, whereof I am accused and condemned to die, but I pray God save the king and send him long to reign over you, for a gentler nor a more merciful prince was there never: and to me he was ever a good, a gentle and sovereign lord.  And if any person will meddle of my cause, I require them to judge the best.  And thus I take my leave of the world and of you all, and I heartily desire you all to pray for me.  O Lord have mercy on me, to God I commend my soul.'

8. Mary Boleyn did NOT witness the execution of her sister. She had been banished from court and disowned by the Boleyns for marrying William Stafford, a common soldier who was not considered a proper consort for the sister of the Queen of England. They were very poor and Mary wrote to Cromwell on several occasions asking him to intercede on her behalf to the king.  They lived out their lives on a Boleyn estate - Rochford Hall in Essex - where she died in 1543.  After her banishment, Mary never spoke or saw Anne, George or her parents again.

9. Elizabeth was NOT at Greenwich Palace at the time of Anne's execution. Such as had been the case with her older sister Mary, once she was a few months old, she'd been given her own household in Hertfordshire (Hatfield House).  Unless Mary's horse had wings AND armor, there was no way she could have traveled from the Tower of London to Hertfordshire and taken the child away from a royal household.  She would have been arrested on site.

10.  Elizabeth was NOT raised by her aunt.  She grew up at Hatfield House, though she did spend much time at Enfield Palace (her beloved brother, Edward's home) as well as Henry's other palaces when she was called to court.

Such a waste of actors, resources and plot. The story of the Reformation and in particular the Anne Boleyn years warrants a better and more accurate on-screen interpretation. This was definitely not that.",1286841600,,5043,4.568888888888889

3170552,4,B0017APPSE,"""The Other Boleyn Girl"" is an exciting period costume drama, very loosely based on King Henry VIII's relationship with the Boleyn sisters Anne and Mary, members of an ambitious family associated with the Royal Court, and derivative of Philippa Gregory's novel of the same name.

In 16th Century England, power politics are a family blood sport, in which the goal is to get close to the King, and stay close by any means necessary. When the dashing and handsome Henry VIII (Eric Bana) pays an official visit to the Boleyns, the family schemes to draw his attention to pretty, ambitious and eligible elder daughter Anne (Natalie Portman in full vixen mode). Through an unfortunate accident, the King instead becomes interested in plainer but honest younger daughter Mary (a superbly sympathetic Scarlett Johansson). When the two daughters are invited to court, they end up in competition to replace Henry's aging, barren queen. It is a high stakes game that the brazen Anne will do anything to win, in which the fate of the entire Boleyn family is very much at hazard.

The story falls short of historical accuracy, but many viewers are likely to be caught up in a fascinating historical melodrama, filled with a solid cast in colorful costumes, lush sets and lots of authentic location shooting. Ultimately, the movie turns on the complex relationship between the two sisters, who become bitter rivals but somehow never quite stop being sisters. Natalie Portman and Scarlett Johansson as Anne and Mary are fun to watch, and the story generates plenty of suspense before its dramatic ending. ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" is highly recommended as good entertainment. The DVD includes some nice extras.",1275264000,,1693,5.042857142857143
3170553,2,B0017APPSE,"I've been a student of Tudor history, and especially the tragedy of Anne Boleyn, whose story has always fascinated me,  for about forty years.  I saw the movie after reading Ms. Gregory's book, itself a wildly speculative work of loosely based historical fiction - emphasis on fiction.  The movie is even worse, from an historical accuracy perspective.  Mary Boleyn was anything but the shrinking violet and dutiful little daughter she is portrayed to be; what little can be found of her in historical accounts indicates that she was sent home in disgrace from the French court for promiscuity.  She was married to Will Carey right after her fling with Henry, and if the child she bore was in fact the King's, he did not acknowledge it so.  Anne spent several years at the French court, not just a couple of months, and not because she was sent there as punishment; when she joined the English court, she introduced many French trends, a sharp contrast to Queen Katharine's Spanish ways.  Nor was she as young as Natalie Portman plays her; she was at least thirty when Elizabeth was born, and somewhere around 36 when she died.  Henry, as portrayed by Eric Bana, was anything but the still young, still slim, still handsome sex symbol he is shown to be, and he was red-haired, to boot.  George Boleyn was anything but the scared little boy he is made out to be; although compelled to marry Jane Parker, he was actually the life of the court, quite a womanizer and gambler, and the center of a group of courtiers who were the King's, and Anne's, friends and constant companions.  Rather than being the only man sent to the block for adultery with Anne, George was only one of five men accused and executed.  Jane Parker recanted her testimony regarding the siblings' incest, which sent her husband to his death, at her own execution in 1542.  The sisters did not take turns competing for Henry, nor did they take turns playing serving maid to each other while the other slept with the King.  Mary was, in fact, banished from court, never to return, when she secretly married William Stafford.  There is no record of her attempting to intercede with the King on Anne's behalf, and she certainly did not carry Elizabeth away with her to raise; Elizabeth at the time of her mother's death was established in her own household, with servants, nurses, and governesses, and at some remove from court, an arrangement that did not change for several years.  Norfolk, while the malignant mover and shaker behind pimping out the Boleyn and Howard girls, was not the person who destroyed Anne's relationship with Henry Percy; that was done by Cardinal Wolsey, at the King's instigation.

3170554,1,B0017APPSE,"Many times whilst watching this movie, I found myself wishing I was watching the much better 'Anne of the 1000 Days'. 'The Other Boleyn Girl' is a travesty of a movie.

Scarlett Johansen seemed to have the acting range of a cold, dead fish. Natalie Portman did better, but frankly, she was fighting a losing battle against very poor scripting. And Eric Bana...well, as an Aussie, I have of course taken the oath of allegience to always adore Eric Bana, who like Hugh Jackman is one of the nicest guys you could hope to meet. But Eric has a very strong accent, of the type that many people who hail from Melbourne's northern suburbs do, and he just can't seem to hide it, no matter what. When he tries to sound English, it just makes me cringe. I was almost expecting King Henry VIII to crack open a beer, throw another shrimp on the barbie and call Anne 'a beaut sheila'. Ugh! Sorry, Eric, you're a top bloke, but I can say with all honesty that Amy Winehouse would have made a better King of England, even with the problem of trying to get a crown on over the wig.

The film made me angry because it was so historically inaccurate. No film better deserved to have the 'This movie is a work of fiction and bears no resemblance to any persons or events ever etc.' disclaimer appear in its closing credits. Worse, I sensed a strong bias from the writer (the writer of the book this was based on, assumedly), in that she seemed to be living vicariously through the character of Mary, and wanted her to be all things good, whilst her sister Anne had to appear as all things bad, assumedly to make Mary appear even better by comparison.

And as for the scene with Anne and her brother (and anyone who's seen the movie will know exactly what scene I mean), well, that was just ICKY!

I like my historical dramas to have at least some resemblance to actual history. And I like them to seem realistic and believable, not just like soap operas or bad romance novels, with inane dialogue and two-dimensional, illogically-constructed characters. I mean, in this movie, King Henry VIII is a thin, fairly stupid, silent and moody bloke who can be manipulated by the most transparent of women's wiles, who makes decisions on the merest hint of a whim, without a real thought of his own in his pretty little head. If King Henry VIII had been as much of a moron in real life as he was scripted to be in this movie, I doubt he would have survived beyond the cradle, let alone to become one of the most powerful, notorious, world-changing kings in history.

3170562,2,B0017APPSE,"For those who give high ratings to 'The Other Boleyn Girl', I can only suggest that you either rent or buy the superb 1969 film, 'Anne of the Thousand Days'. Both films basically deal with the same subject but there's really no comparison. Where 'Anne' is a complex historical recreation and magisterial drama, 'The Other Boleyn...' is a ponderous soap opera, where numerous film-goers today have been taken in by the film's lavish production values (shot in High Definition), along with the three big name Hollywood stars who can't hold a candle to predecessors such as Richard Burton and Genevieve Bujold who really make you feel like you're watching flesh and blood human beings who lived in the 16th century.

I haven't read the book which the movie was based on but I question why it was necessary to tell Anne Boleyn's story through the eyes of her older sister Mary (inaccurately depicted as the younger sister here in this film). Mary's part in 'Anne of the Thousand Days' is wisely depicted as brief and her bitterness toward her father for 'pimping her out' to King Henry VIII is much more believable than Scarlett Johansson's Mary who continues to hold a soft spot for the King despite being unceremoniously dumped by him and bearing a child who was dubbed a bastard. Mary is basically depicted as a saint who we're supposed to identify with because she has a 'good heart'. Unfortunately, most saints make for boring drama and Johansson's Mary is no exception. Johansson did well in Woody Allen's well-scripted 'Vicky Christina Barcelona' but she is completely out of her element in the 16th century. Instead of a world weary traveler in the Tudor court, Johansson's Mary is more like an Amish-like simpleton whose grim and ponderous expressions suggest that she is an actor of extremely limited range. Mary has little to do in 'The Other Boleyn Girl'. Her two big scenes (the love scene with King Henry and the birth of her son) are devoid of substantial dramatic conflict.

What's worse is the suggestion that Anne and Mary were competitors for Henry's approval. In 'Anne of the Thousand Days', there was no competition between the two sisters. Mary's story was over when Anne comes on the scene. Genevieve Bujold defiantly states that she will never let the King do what he did to her sister and it takes a very long time in that film before Anne changes her mind. In The Other Boleyn Girl, Natalie Portman's Anne is a cold and calculating schemer from the beginning, inexplicably accusing her sister from taking the King from her. Later, she blames Mary for being responsible for the breakup of her secret union with Henry Percy. Ann's Uncle, the Duke of Northrop, orders that the two lovers separate. In 'Anne of the Thousand Days', the breakup is a matter of state policy. The head of the Catholic Church, Cardinal Wolsey, threatens Ann's lover and they're forced to part due to the King's designs on Anne. In 'The Other Boleyn Girl', Anne's undoing is attributed to what appears to be something like a bi-polar episode. After Henry rejects her because she can't bear a male heir, she becomes unhinged and ends up slapping him. In 'Anne of the Thousand Days', Anne is both the victim of Henry's cruelty and her own ambition to see her daughter declared the first in succession to the English throne.

Screenwriter Peter Morgan's view of Henry VIII is way off the mark. Thanks to Morgan's superficial portrait, Eric Bana, turns Henry into a GQ model rather than the petty but complex Henry of history. For those who are offended that I dare suggest that Bana isn't right for the part, I strongly urge you to watch Richard Burton in 'Anne of the Thousand Days'; afterward, come back and tell me with a straight face that you think Bana was right for this part. What's missing in 'The Other Boleyn Girl' is how Henry relates to members of his Court. Who are his friends and confidants? And of course there's the whole political intrigue of the court which is glossed over in 'The Other Boleyn Girl'. The key players, Cardinal Wolsey and the King's adviser, the deadly Thomas Cromwell, are missing. In 'Anne of the Thousand Days', there are a myriad of characters interacting with the King and as a result of these interactions, a full portrait of Henry's personality comes through. Here, Bana's Henry is dull and witless. What's more, Morgan's view of Henry and Anne's relationship has no real grace or drama. The best Morgan can come up with is a crude rape scene which reduces Henry to a comic book villain.

'The Other Boleyn Girl' is not without a few good points. Ana Torrent is brilliant as Katherine of Aragon, depicting the quiet dignity of a woman terribly wronged. David Morrissey is credible as the steely social-climbing uncle who holds the strings in the family. Kristin Scott Thomas as the Boleyn mother acquits herself well but she's a bit too much of a feminist icon for 16 century England. Mark Rylance was much too ineffectual as Sir Thomas Boleyn but he looks very good as a 16th century nobleman.

Production-wise, 'The Other Boleyn...' is filmed in sumptuous high definition and the scenes in the English countryside are a pleasure to watch. The camera work is for the most part pretty good with first-time director Justin Chardwick shooting scenes from a multiplicity of angles.

In the end, 'The Other Boleyn Girl' is not the other Boleyn's Girl story. If you want the 'real McCoy', then you must see Richard Burton and Genevieve Bujold together. They are master craftsmen and you will be truly moved by their performances. The remake connects the dots but can never hold a candle to the 1969 production. Sometimes it's best to leave things well enough alone!",1259366400,,5696,4.777664974619289
3170563,5,B0017APPSE,"""The Other Bolyn Girl"" was released to theatres on February 29th, 2008 and became an immediate hit grossing over $75,000,000 at the boxoffice. These were huge numbers considering the movie only cost $35,000,000 to produce. Perhaps it was the fact that television viewers, at the time, were enthralled by Showtime's ""The Tudors"" and movie-going audiences were inclined to watch a historical piece on King Henry VIII that made this a hit, but ""The Other Bolyn Girl"" could never have failed; it had all the ingredients of a hit film: stunning photography, a wonderful story that was known to its audience, and enthralling performances by its three leads. ""The Other Bolyn Girl"" tells the story of 16th-century aristocrats Mary and Anne, sisters, fighting over King Henry VIII. Mary would ultimately be only Henry's mistress(one of many) and Anne would become his second wife(also one of many). Both sisters were trying to better themselves and their family by getting involved with the Monarch, but both failed to realize the King was only in love with two things; his country and his unfulfilled sexual apetite. The sisters are played by Natalie Portman (Anne) and Scarlett Johansson (Mary), but it is Eric Bana, who plays King Henry, that is mesmerizing. He displays many emotions as the King of England; everything from raw sexuality (Eric is breathtaking to look at with his beard) to hatred, passion, love, desire, and vengefulness. The production values of this historical drama are first-rate with beautiful costumes and cinematography. The DVD comes with deleted and extended scenes, featurettes on the film and its historcial figures, and more. WNBC says of the film that it's , ""a wonderful, dramatic and powerful saga of the dangers of absolute power. The cast is impeccable"". If you enjoy ""The Other Bolyn Girl"" you will love TV's ""The Tudors"". That series' first two seasons are available on DVD.",1258934400,,1906,5.092651757188499

3170565,3,B0017APPSE,"""The Other Boleyn Girl"" tells the rise and fall of Anne Boleyn, the woman who manipulated Henry the Eighth into separating from the Vatican and who gave birth to Elizabeth, Britain's greatest monarch.

When Catherine of Aragon is unable to produce a male heir for the king (Eric Bana) the Boleyn family plays political intrigue, assigning Anne (Natalie Portman) to be Henry the Eighth's mistress. But Henry the Eighth prefers the younger sister Mary (Scarlett Johansson), and beds her. Dejected and angry Anne secretly marries the young lord Henry Percy, an impetuous act that is rewarded with her exile in France where she completes her education in the ways of man. Upon her return Anne seduces Henry the Eighth, manipulates him into rejecting her younger sister, the queen, and the Vatican. Branded as a witch by the English public Anne gives birth to Elizabeth, and then loses a child in a miscarriage. Fearing for her life and clearly growing insane Anne tries to get her brother George to impregnate her, and the king hears about this and beheads both.

When we first learn that Natalie Portman is to play the wildly ambitious seductress Anne and Scarlett Johansson her wide-eyed innocent sister we're forced to think that there's been a terrible mix-up in casting. But Natalie Portman is the anchor of the film, holding together a flimsy and sometimes incoherent script and yet another half-hearted performance by Scarlett Johansson.

Natalie Portman will be remembered as the greatest star of her generation -- the Audrey Hepburn of our times. She lacks the stunning overwhelming beauty of Audrey Hepburn but she is far more talented and versatile. She was terrible in the Star Wars trilogy but so was everyone else, and since then she has given nothing but competent performances. In ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" her character isn't all that believable and developed, her supposed transformation halfway through the movie isn't really noticeable, and it's hard to figure out why Henry the Eighth becomes so infatuated with her -- and yet despite all these stark flaws in the script and direction Natalie Portman's still compelling to watch: she's just stunningly beautiful draped in vermillion, and she makes the usually sexy Scarlett Johansson look dull and ditzy.

Ironically Portman's brilliant performance only hurts the film. The film is designed to be a tragedy, centering around a family that suddenly rises and then suddenly falls because of their overwhelming thirst for power. It is this blind famly ambition that would create Anne Boleyn, a woman who's either evil or insane and who almost singlehandedly managed to tear England apart. Countering Anne is good and noble Mary, who almost loses her soul to her family's ambition but in the end learns to trust her goodness. So what does it say about the direction of the film and the film itself when at the end we really don't care about Mary, and we don't want Anne to be beheaded even after we've seen Anne destroy her younger sister, destroy the good queen, and try to bed her brother?

Clearly directors need to learn to control Natalie Portman better. She's not yet as famous and powerful as Julia Roberts and Tom Cruise but already she can warp a film -- in a very uncanny Anne Boleyn way -- around her. The good news is that unlike Julia Roberts and Tom Cruise she is talented, and when she finds a script and meets a director worthy of her talent the result will be truly mesmerizing.",1257811200,,3456,4.890784982935154

3170567,3,B0017APPSE,"I saw this only about a week after having seen Ann of a Thousand Days so, of course, my mind was busy making comparisons.  I'm not a student of English history but from what I've read here, ""Ann"" was much closer to actuality.  It seems to me that if you're going to make a historical drama, tell the real story--otherwise why bother?

As far as casting is concerned, Richard Burton and Genevieve Bujold were head and shoulders better than this group, with the exception of Kristin Scott-Thomas, who is always good.  Apparently these were chosen for box office appeal. Scarlett Johannsen is a gifted ""personality"" (don't know if I'd really call her an actress.)
She is physically gorgeous and has a strong screen presence, which suits her very well for some roles.  However here she was given the role of the shy, mousy sister--what a waste of glam-power.  She played ""dumb"" a lot, often by looking blank and breathing through her mouth---not attractive.

Natalie Portman is very pretty and she can act a lot better than Scarlett, but neither one of them had the substance that one looks for in a drama of this sort.  Let them stick to what they can do.  The fellow who played Henry was certainly hunky and handsome which gave credence to the fact that both sisters fell for him so quickly-but he lacked the power and authority that made Burton so convincing in the role.

The script of Ann of a Thousand Days was much more flattering to Ann.  She was shown as an innocent for most of the film and Bujold shone bright and clear in that role, which captured the sympathy of the viewer.  I wept at the final scene, when she asked the executioner ""if it would hurt"" and declared that she had ""a tiny neck.""  In this film, Ann was shown to be a calculating, duplicitous girl from the beginning so that I really didn't care what happened to her.

I am not always a stickler for historical accuracy but in this case I think some pretty big liberties were taken with the facts.  Having Henry rape Ann was certainly a violation.  Also the question of Ann and her brother having sex--did this happen or not?  Was he gay?  These are not minor issues--they are important to the plot and should have been shown truthfully.

If you really don't care about what really happened, then you can watch this film and enjoy the pretty people and lush costumes.  Although those pretty people are prettier in other films.",1253664000,,2398,4.571428571428571
3170568,4,B0017APPSE,"I was a history major in college and was surprised by this storyline, or more surprised by people who believed it to be true. I haven't read the book but I took the movie as entertainment and a work of fiction and if judged by those standards you will love this beautiful, cunning tale.",1252800000,,286,4.314814814814815
3170569,1,B0017APPSE,"Let me preface this by saying I read the novel way before the film was released. The book was all right, if relatively inaccurate about historical plot points. It is indeed a work of fiction based on people who lived, so you take the good with the bad. But the film? Half of it didn't even follow its own source material, let alone ANY of the actual history of Anne and Mary Boleyn!

Trying to cram several decades of events into two hours is challenging, but throwing away important points is the result of terrible script writing. Eric Bana is awful as Henry VIII; he captures none of the drama and power and majesty of the real man. Natalie Portman is decent as Anne Boleyn, but there is still something lacking in her performance. Scarlett Johansson was pretty much only there to be just that, pretty. The rest of the actors and actresses were relatively miss-cast as well. They seemed to be phoning in their performances.

But the worst part was the historical inaccuracies portrayed by this film. Some of the most stand-out ones being:

Mary allegedly hopping directly into bed with Henry VIII and skipping the fact that she was originally sent to the French court (where she was allegedly the mistress of the King of France for a time.) Anne had also been at the French court; she was never ""banished"" there. She was actually there when Mary started her affair with Henry VIII!

The ""Henry VIII fell down a ravine and got hurt!"" bit? Totally made up.

Mary had two children during her time at the English court. Catherine and Henry were never officially announced as Henry VIII's bastards; it was only implied later on.

Anne and Mary were never close. It is believed that Mary was actually the elder sister and Anne the youngest. It wasn't until after the affair with Mary that Henry VIII took any interest in Anne. And Henry VIII never banished Mary at Anne's wishes.

That bit where Catherine of Aragon confronted Anne and Mary? NEVER HAPPENED!

Mary married William Stafford in secret, shortly after Anne became Queen and gave birth to her daughter Elizabeth, but as soon as the secret was found out, Mary was disowned by her family and the couple was banished from court. Mary was virtually penniless and begged Thomas Cromwell to speak on her behalf to Anne and Henry VIII. None in her family would help her; Anne eventually took some pity on Mary and sent her some money but refused to receive her at court.

Mary NEVER begged Henry VIII to spare Anne's life. She never attended Anne or George's executions and never returned to court. Nor did Mary raise her niece Elizabeth. She most likely never even saw Elizabeth, as the future queen was raised at Hatfield House.

Honestly, this movie was terrible. It was almost as if the script writer wrote plot points on slips of paper and drew them out of a hat, then cobbled the script together with droll dialogue. They couldn't even get the scenery right. Why must Hollywood screw up something that's actually documented? History is far more entertaining than fiction!

If you want to watch something quality with decent attempts to be historically accurate (although with its own faults) I suggest you pick up Seasons 1 and 2 of HBO's ""The Tudors"". Beautifully cast, great acting, fantastic script writing, only minor inaccuracies in places. Skip ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" entirely!",1252108800,,3341,4.733218588640275
3170570,4,B0017APPSE,"I have not read the book by this same title. Nor have I watched any of the popular Tudor's series of late.

I don't know what's worse...watching a film that is beautiful in scenery, costume and acting not knowing what the outcome will be and hoping for the best, or knowing and having the impotent sense of horror as you watch it all unfold. The film starts with ""Mr."" Boleyn offering his girls to the highest bidder...more or less. Anne (Natalie Portman), the oldest, is requested for marriage. Her father offers her younger, equally beautiful sister Mary, (Scarlett Johansson) instead. She's the nicer of the two and more likely to be content with a mere merchant.

 Father is not, he has great ambition for his children. And so the story goes.

Mary's marriage conveniently gets set aside on account of the King Henry's (Eric Bana) great need for a male heir and his wife's inability to provide one. When Mary Boleyn is pregnant, the king's eye must not wander away from the tight circle of power that is being woven around him, enter Anne.

But Anne has ambition of her own. The madness and horrible outcome unfolds in the absolute worst possible way. The history is fascinating and brutal. As ugly as American politics are today, they are nothing compared to the drama of King Henry's court.

There are sex scenes in the film. However, they are more arty that crude. One is disturbing but both partners are shown fully clothed. A couple others are shown quickly and include a naked thigh in profile. Beheadings occur off screen. There is no language warning. The lighting was sometimes a little dark. And more than one scene change made me pause to figure out what had just happened.

Definitely worth the rental in my book. But a little depressing to keep in my permanent library, but if I can find it for a decent price I might. It felt very much like  Girl With a Pearl Earring and a little like Marie Antoinette. Fans of either or both would probably like Other Boleyn.",1251763200,,1978,4.615384615384615
3170571,1,B0017APPSE,"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix was actually closer to the book than this was.  I would never guess that even possible!  Ill admit that I had to turn the movie off after 1 hr 10 minutes because it was..... lunacy.  I'm sure Ann was not happy that her sister was marrying b4 her because they are rivals but the movie makes her seem not only happy but almost excited.

Ann seems soft and girly.

Marys marriage to sir Carey was not romantic, it was arranged so the conversation in the dancing circle about loving him for him and not needing someone grander never took place

It was not Marys wedding that Ann caught the eye of Percy

I don't think that Princess Mary was there when The Queen miscarried.  Children are sent away at the very latest 4 and with Mary being a Princess She was sent away much sooner that that.  When the Queen did see Mary it was because she and the King visited her not she visit them.

The first conversation between father and uncle bugs me.  #1, uncle talks of the king needing a mistress soon and suggests a Howard girl  that isn't how it happened.  Henry took an active interest in Mary and they went from there it was not premeditated.  2 they say that father suggested Ann and uncle was concerned that she she was his first born and favorite and father might want a simpler life for her.  This is absolutely ridiculous.  If this conversation had actually taken place which I know it didn't because of #1, uncle would have salivated!  He cares of nothing and no one but himself getting ahead and it doesn't matter who gets him there.  He never would have been concerned that father might want a simpler marriage for Ann.

On Mary's wedding night when Ann and Mary are having a heart to heart and Mary is telling Ann that no one could wish for a better sister, I notice that the B is absent from Ann's pearl necklace.

Check to see if the king and really went to the Boleyn's.  The girls were members of court at 4 years old so I don't think that is how it would have played out.  Additionally Ann is wearing a cross from her pearls instead of the B.  If you read the book you know that the B on her necklace is where Ann pulls her confidence. It is a symbol of everything she is.  It's her soul on a chain.

Ann was not with the king when he was initially hurt.  She was in France.  He hasn't met her yet.

This is lunacy. Mary is tending to the king after the first injury instead of the queen!  The Queen always takes care of the king.  After the king is hurt the second time in the book and slipping in and out of conscience, it is the Queen (even though shes dead) that he calls out to exclaiming that if she were here she would know exactly what to do. Additionally he asks why hes never seen her at court.  Mary was raised at court and has served by the Queens side her whole life so much so that she looks at the Queen as a mother to her.

On top of the fact that Mary and Ann don't go to court together instead Mary has been there since she was four to serve the Queen (and is her favorite) and when Ann comes home from France (not because she was exiled) she goes to the castle and visits George and Mary.  This is the first time that the King meets Ann.

Am i watching the right movie??????

The girl that chases Mary to tell her what a good woman the Queen is after she makes Mary sing is so sweet.  I almost fell off the couch when she introduced herself as Jane Parker.  Haha what a joke that girl doesn't have a sweet bone in her crazy, nosy body.

30 minutes in and we meet Stafford!!!  Oh for crying out loud.  And they should have made him hotter.  ps  Still no B on Ann's chain

George was supposed to walk Mary to the kings Quarters.  He does so every time and he waits outside for her and escorts her back to her room.

Did Mary really ask the king to have the servants bring her water?  Ill check but I don't think so.  She never asked him for anything until after they had children and it was only in their regards.

On a positive note Good choice for King.  What a knockout!!!!!!

I cant believe how badly Ann's marriage is portrayed.  They are engaged and bed but not legally married to get legally married they have to go to Wolsey and thus creates the very seed of Ann's hate and ambition.  ahhh

The movie works hard to make the Boleyn girls mother seem loving and caring and even sad at Ann's departure to France (which is all screwed up) but in truth she stands quietly behind her husband and brother.  She even states to Mary in the book that she did what was best for her children by sending them away at 4 and no she most certainly never missed them at all.

A son!!!!!!!!!!  What of baby Catherine

I am 50 minutes into the movie and Ann finally has her B necklace.  I have to give up on notes because the movie isn't even close to the book.

At 70 minutes I have given up on the film.  I am embarrassed that someone tried to pull this off as a movie of the book.  Maybe if it had been someones version of what happened I would get that but to say it is of the book is absurd. Everything is so screwed up I can't stand it.  The way Henry courts Ann, Mary's little girl isn't even in the movie, the lack of relationship between Mary and the Queen (and how they are associated) the list goes on and on.  I give up.

In the film, Boleyn sisters Mary (Scarlett Johansson) and Ann (Natalie Portman) are raised in the country. The two girls are unfortunate enough to have an ambitious father and uncle, who plot to advance the family's fortune and position. To achieve such a lofty goal, the two men decide to use Mary and Ann as bait for the frustrated King of England (Eric Bana), whose current wife has failed to bear a male heir to the throne.

The King is initially captivated by Mary's innocence and sweetness. However, conniving Ann turns the King's affections towards herself, despite the fact that Mary bears the King an illegitimate son. Unsatisfied with simply being a mistress, Ann convinces the King to divorce his wife and break with the Catholic church, merely to possess her. As England, and the Boleyn family, is ripped in twain by the King's actions, Ann and Mary cling to one another.

I thought that all performances were solid, but the movie suffered from a talk-y plot and too much meandering, too much readiness to cast blame upon characters rather than just present the action. Also, it is unfortunate that Johansson's beauty, one of her greatest assets on screen, was basically washed-out in this film. Very little makeup, lots of drab colors. I understand she was presented as an opposite of the vibrant Ann, but such choices did the actress a disservice.

Bana did an admirable job, as did Kristin Scott Thomas (who played mother to the two girls). David Morissey, as the calculating Duke of Norfolk, was delightfully seedy.

This ended up a mere costume drama with some overwrought acting from Portman (who is usually very talented and on-pitch), especially at the end, and not enough screen time for Johannson, who is supposed to be the character referred to in the title of the film.

Bana is surprisingly good at Henry VIII, and Kristen Scott Thomas steals every scene she is in.

The film's pace is so sprightly it is over before we can really appreciate what is happening between the characters, who therefore develop very little, and so we can't come to care about them. In the end, they are just three attractive cardboard cut outs in nice outfits.

The thing that really bugged me about this movie was the character of Mary Boleyn.  In reality, she was not the meek, shy, virtuous girl portrayed by Scarlett Johanssen (the type of character she is not good at portraying anyway).  Mary was a ribald character and was not at her sister's Anne's side faithfully thru all.  In truth, the two sisters were not close.

Too bad the film didn't choose to focus on the intense struggles between Rome and England, didn't go more into depth on Anne's fierce Protestant sympathies, and didn't delve into the remarkable personalities of Wolsey, Cromwell and Thomas More.

The Philippa Gregory book, that this was supposed to be based upon, certainly diverged from truth, but the end result was touching and interesting.

So, when I bought this movie I didn't expect accuracy, but I did expect to be entertained. The only connection between this and the Gregory books, besides fleeting moments, is the title. This is even less accurate than the book, and much less entertaining.

The makers compressed relationships so much that the audience doesn't have a chance to care about any of these people. The Mary/Henry relationship in the book was much more fleshed out -- Mary was the main character. They're barely shown having a relationship, yet the movie tried to trade on that bond.

The Anne/Henry relationship was just a mess, following no logic. We know he turned on her, but the movie would have you believe that he did so after one conversation with Catherine, but that he married her anyhow -- completely random. If the events of the relationship with Anne post marriage were any faster, they'd be a montage. There was no time at all to see it slipping away from Anne. There are a couple brief scenes where they show her desperate, but to someone unfamiliar with it all, it wouldn't convey the true scope of what happened. Even a Lifetime movie fleshes out characters better than this, even the villainous  husband characters.

I loved when Stafford proposed to Mary and they'd simply not cared to point out that her first husband had died. We see him early on looking sad that his wife has to bed the king and then he's shuffled off the stage. This has to be confusing to people not familiar enough with the story.

Everybody was wasted in this, the whole movie was a waste. Throw away accuracy, if you must, but the result should still be a good story. This movie failed in every way possible.

There are three good things about this film. First, the tension between the beautiful women. While Natalie Portman appears rather rigid through the film, Scarlett Johanssen is great. It's strange to see these beautiful women spar with one another, and that tension makes the film more enjoyable because it makes the audience tense.

The second good thing about the film are the beautiful sets. The film sets the Tudor mode wonderfully.

The best thing about the film is the plot's theme: the danger of ambition. It sees ambition as sin, and points out through very certain terms, that ""the wages of sin is ...""

*Spoilers*

In my review of the book this movie is based on, I noted that the book is very bad history, but if you are willing to accept the premise of a ""Boleyn alternate reality"", it is not a bad story. Sadly, the movie doesn't even have that in its favor.

The timeline is rushed and compressed into a few short years, leaving the viewer disoriented and confused at the blurred pacing. Although I had not thought it possible, Anne has been vilified here even worse than in the novel, and Henry is uncharacteristically physically violent and cruel, apparently so that we could have a violent rape scene presented to us. The rape of Anne is particularly disturbing because the viewer seems to be expected to revel in Anne's ""comeuppance"" - apparently her sexual assault is meant to be seen as her fitting punishment for being such a shrew during the first half of the movie. I can think of no other explanation for this gratuitous and violent scene, which almost certainly never happened and was not even featured in the book. The entire feel of the movie from that point onward - rape, madness, (attempted) incest - is quite disturbing. The gross distortion of history in movies is common, but this strange obsession with the most sordid gossip about Anne despite the fact that even the source novel managed a light touch seems to reveal less to us about Anne and more about the screenwriters. (I kept expecting them to accuse Anne of bestiality, too, just to be really thorough.)

As far as the acting, Johansson does a good job portraying the Mary Boleyn of the novel, but since Mary serves only as a window through which Anne's actions are observed, she seems criminally wasted in this role. Portman tackles the job of Anne-as-demon-spawn with verve and determination, particularly in the elopement scene. Katherine is played well enough, with the proper amount of stern stubbornness, but Henry seems terribly out of sorts and character - in keeping with the book where Gregory seems unable to see him concretely as much of anything, but rather just a leaf on the wind of the women he surrounds himself with.

This movie is closed captioned for the hearing impaired.

The movie didn't have any of the details of the rise of Anne Boleyn, the persuasion and manipulation of Henry or the problems that she caused with the country.  The main thread throughout the movie was sex.  I do understand that power was bought and traded with sex.

This movie was a total disappointment.  Understand that a movie based on a book will never be as good as the book.  I do think though that a reader should expect more.

It was a great film, and it added a few things that I wasn't expecting that were credible.

For people like me, though, who adore learning about the Tudor period, the film was innacurate, even ignoring all that was left out from the book. I was grateful for its tasteful love scenes, since I am not a fan of graphic sex scenes, but much of the movie didn't really hit the mark, I thought, when comparing it to Henry VIII's real court and the real characters. Some of the dresses were a little over-the-top, I thought, especially the shiny green one Anne is wearing on the DVD cover. My favorite scene that I thought was the clearest view of the characters was Anne's breakdown.

I thought Natalie Portman was an outstanding choice to play Anne, and as much as I like Scarlett Johannson, the part of Mary Boleyn was not right for her.

I rather like Natalie Portman, but her variable English accent was distracting, to say the least.  (Obviously there is some logic in casting English actors in such roles.)  I didn't find Eric Bana particularly appealing (maybe we hetero males aren't easily swayed by an actor's looks), and the rape of Anne is unhistorical and was obviously included to spice up a rather dull movie.  (Tip to movie-makers: sex can actually be very titillating when it's just suggested, and off-screen.) After seeing this movie on DVD, I found myself dragging my old Six Wives of Henry VIII tapes out of the closet and relishing the great acting and the intelligent scripts, and the great actress Dorothy Tutin as Anne is a pretty tough act to follow.

It was the story that was lacking and really quite depressing. I don't remember feeling depressed reading the book -- just a bit fascinated with the author's portrayal of the court and sad for the noblewomen who had little to no control over their own destinies.

If the movie had been named differently, I would've watched it with the expectation that it might have a different take on the story. All I could think about, though, was ""Hey wait, that's wrong."" And ""No, that didn't happen."" And ""Hey, that's not the way it's supposed to be."" Even knowing that most films can't adhere that closely to the book, this one was so far off that it was jarring.

However, as it is presented as an account of the lives of Henry VIII and the Boleyn sisters, packing a staggering disregard for historical accuracy, it gets rather low marks in my book.

As other reviewers have pointed out, the list of inaccuracies is too long and complex to even begin to tackle, but I can't resist citing a few: for starters, Mary is considered to have been the older sister; the King had tired of Mary before taking a fancy to Anne so there was never any competition there; Anne and Mary were not thought to be close and Mary was not present at Anne's execution. Though painted as pure and chaste, Mary had already been the mistress of King Francis I of France before she made her way into Henry VIII's bed, and had a solid reputation of promiscuity at the French court where she and Anne both spent time. While it is portrayed as a matter of fact that Mary gave birth to the King's son, in reality the child was thought to be that of Mary's first husband William Carey, and Henry VIII never acknowledged the boy as his. However the King did acknowledge the son of a previous mistress, Elizabeth Blount, so perhaps the characters of Mary and Bessie are merged into one in the film. In one scene, Mary reads aloud a few sentences of a love letter from the King which was actually one he had written to Anne. In another, the King assaults Anne sexually before their marriage which almost certainly did not happen. Though he was indeed a tyrant and thought nothing of sending whomever he so desired to their brutal deaths, personally administering violence didn't appear to be his thing.  And some of the most important figures behind the scenes of Anne's ultimate undoing are nowhere to be found, while others, like Anne's uncle the Duke of Norfolk, seems to be merged with the notably absent Cardinal Wolsey and Thomas Cranmer.

The film does get a few minor points right. Both Anne and her father were highly ambitious manipulative schemers, the King went all out to rid himself of his first wife Katherine (though the complexity of the circumstances behind this would have filled up a six week mini-series and is only dealt with fleetingly in the film). And of course, Anne did lose her head in the end.

Only die hard fans of Natalie Portman and Scarlett Johansen should bother, with the understanding that practically nothing in it is based in actual fact; those interested in a history lesson should pass it up.

Despite the foregoing, lead actresses performed rather admirably, especially since neither is English, and Portman had captured the essence of who Anne probably really was, if perhaps slightly less evil. Eric Bana as King Henry VIII was generally fine, and I especially liked Anna Torrent as Queen Katherine. On a trivial side note, Henry and Queen Katherine, his Spanish first wife, were both redheads, but are rarely protrayed as such.",1231632000,,2986,4.6477272727272725

Though no ""A Man for all Seasons"" by any stretch of the imagination, Justin Chadwick`s ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" is a handsomely mounted, reasonably entertaining soap opera set in the politically-charged court of King Henry VIII.

Based on the highly fictionalized and speculative novel by Phillipa Gregory, the movie chronicles the 16th Century catfight between the two Boleyn sisters - the more famous one, Anne, whose marriage to the divorced king resulted in England's final rupture with the Church of Rome (and the eventual loss of her own head when she, like his first wife Catherine, could not provide him with a male heir), and the lesser known, already married Mary who, at least as portrayed in this film, was every bit as attractive to the king as the sister who would eventually win his hand.

The Peter Morgan screenplay reduces the complex historical events to the level of a Harlequin Romance, pitting the two sisters against one another in a competition for the king's affections.  All of this is of considerably less interest than the almost ruthless, behind-the-scenes machinations undertaken by the girls' family to groom them as concubines for the crass purpose of currying royal favor.  In fact, it is when the movie touches on the mores of the time and of life at court that it is at its most compelling.

Natalie Portman, Scarlett Johansson and Eric Bana all seem to be having great fun playing at dress-up, but the richest performances are delivered by Mark Rylance and David Morrissey as the girls' calculating father and uncle respectively, and Kristin Scott Thomas as their levelheaded, pragmatic mother, helpless to prevent the tragedy that was doomed to engulf her family.

It blows so fast through the historical events that you don't care one iota about any of the characters except maybe for the poor British actors in the film who had to go to their trailers every day and bang their heads against the wall trying to figure out how to make a silk purse out of a sow's ear.",1225756800,,702,4.285714285714286
3170617,3,B0017APPSE,"Not an art movie--not quite an epic--but a regular costumer, in what has become a culture with Focus Films: Make as many movies about Elizabeth I, or her relatives and historical milieu. This time it is about her mother, Ann Boleyn, but the story--slow moving at first--let's us know about her younger sister, Mary, and her manipulative uncle, the Duke of Norfolk, who sees it is an opportunity to further his family's interests by promoting her as the prospective mistress of his king, who else, the infamous Henry the VIII.  She is married already, and that makes it easier, for the king need not bother with her virginhood.  Mary has a child with Henry and then is abandoned; his interest now turns to her sister, Ann, who had been in France a while, ""educating"" herself in court manners. Now she is a daring woman who has the temerity to exchange witticism with the mighty king. She defies him to marry her, something that will cost England a rift with the Pope. All this is well known stuff of history, and the movie does not bother with much detail. But when Ann seems to go too far, fails to produce a male heir, and thence is beheaded; that simple. The details of two beheadings, for she has to be found guilty of something--incest with her brother--are gruesome, and both she and her brother undergo the usual decapitation process, he with an ax, his head on a block, she by a horizontal hit with a blade that cuts off her head while she knees, and her head and neck are in vertical position.

Eric Bana, who plays Henry, makes an effort to make this male monster's tale sympathetic--after all he has to have a son!--but, in this one of his weakest performances, only succeeds in giving the viewer a bag of inconsistencies, for Henry seems beyond redemption--whatever his reasons.  Natalie Portman and Scarlet Johanssen give creditable performances, and the rest of the cast is on the excellent side, in this tale which nothing but a repetition of royal sins and monstrous inhumanities.",1225324800,,1995,4.691428571428571

The plot was entertaining if not terribly engaging. Although I really disliked the rape scene and the end. The end was rushed and choppy....it seemed to all occur in a few days or weeks. The rape scene - who ever wants to see that? Nonetheless, it just did not seem to fit. It was harsh. I mean, I know Henry must have been angry that suddenly his country was being turned upside down by the whims of a vixen he had fallen for, but why the abrupt turn of passions? It was just a bit over the top and probably just done to show the differences between the relationship with the sisters.....

Someone previously had mentioned that Mary and Henry's conversations in the movie seemed inadequate and unfulfilling....I think that for the time it was appropriate. The king was looking for a pretty face to entertain him and Mary was an easily swayed girl looking for love. A few words and glances were all that were needed for someone to be convinced they were in love then (perhaps now?)

3170622,4,B0017APPSE,"""The Other Boleyn Girl"" is an entertaining historical drama that reminds many of us that the rakish, irresponsible Henry VII actually knew two Boleyn women - the known one - Anne, and the unknown one, Mary.

The film tells a story how both sisters end up romancing the king, and how both are used by their father and the Duke of Norfolk to assure their family's status and fortune. Like the later film, ""The Duchess,"" the film paints an extremely bleak portrait of a woman's life and choices - something that changed very recently in history.

Eric Bana brings life and vitality to Henry, depicting a time before the king had become corpulent and lazy. Natalie Portman is duplicitous and still manages to conjure some sympathy as Anne, and Scarlett Johansson is noble and admirable as Mary.

People will aruge over the factual nature of the film, but history should be learned from history research, not from motion pictures. This is a great story and one that can be enjoyed by many.",1224460800,,984,4.709302325581396

That said, it is an interesting depiction of 16th century England at the court of King Henry VIII, when position and power meant everything, it was very much a man's world and women were reduced to mere pawns to serve their advancement (either as wives or mistresses) and assure their descendance. All in all, I found the film entertaining, more so than the television serie, where the actors were less charismatic and somewhat unconvincing, especially Anne.

However, my favorite film on the subject remains ""Anne of the thousand days"", which is closer to the real story and far more believable as a whole, and Genevieve Bujold and Richard Burton deliver dynamite performances.",1224288000,,902,4.85064935064935

But with their historical inaccuracies they once again debase Anne Boleyn but on a much wider scale then Henry VIII could've dreamt. He was in reality a narcissist and serial adulterer who would kill or accuse a wife of anything to be rid of her. This movie claims a lot of the rumors he created about Anne were true and reported by people without machiavellian motivations. In the process they debase a woman who happened to be vaguely successful in her ambitions, while rewriting history to glorify women of the court who lived dark and petty lives.

Boleyn Girl is a pretty movie. From the actors, to the setting and the cinematography, everything is put together in a way that pleases the eye.
But aesthetics isn't quite enough, and it doesn't make up for blatant flaws like the bad accents, the over the top story that resembles a soap opera and the script that manages to be uninteresting although dealing with a subject that can appeal to most audiences: two sisters on luxurious dresses and living in a castle fight for the same man, who happens to be a king. Deny it if you will, but everyone loves a little intrigue and cat fight especially if it comes from the absurdly beautiful main actresses.

Speaking of which, they both use to full extent their amazing acting skills, although not at all times. Portman manages to be stunning while acting alongside with Scarlett, which is quite an accomplish on her side.

Overall, the movie has a flawed script that isn't made up by the talented main actresses or the beauty of the movie itself. What amazes me about it is not what it is, but what could have been. With such a cast and story, it could have easily become one of the best period movie of the last few years. It didn't.

3170627,1,B0017APPSE,"To begin with, let me say that I am a huge fan of Phillipa Gregory's. I read my paperback copy so many times that pages almost fell out. But after watching this movie I almost started hating the novel. Yes I understand that Hollywood has many difficulties in translating book to film, but this was basically a failure. So many literary AND historical inaccuracies it was laughable.
  The mother was shown as too sympathetic and the father extremely weak, Mary and Anne became enemies much too quickly, Mary was married too late, and Stafford?! They should never have brought him into the movie so early; it ruins his future relationships and role with Mary. A major dislike for me was Mary's great reluctance to leave the country for court-mainly this was bad because in the book she BEGAN at court-as well, her loving the King came up really suddenly, she sleeps with him twice and BOOM! ""Anne, I love him,"" a little fast even for this movie. And WHERE did William Carey go to?! Just ""disappeared"" and Mary starts leaning toward Stafford. Implausible, yet no one seemed to notice. But I felt pity for the character of Anne during her virtual rape by the King-that was NEVER even insinuated in by any historians. And George Boleyn, for a character with such a pivotal role in the story, he had very little screen time, though Jim Sturgess did a fine job.
  Also, the basic premise of the story-two sisters' rivalry for a King's love and standing in court-is twisted by having Anne try to catch the King first, and getting him injured. Anne was shown as having an extraordinary amount of power over even her family, especially too much sway over her uncle. The debate over sending Queen Katherine away was cut too short, as was the furor over divorce. Showing Mary in the countryside and Anne in France would have also been nice touches.
  I truly admired Katherine of Aragon's character-very regal and formidable and her quoted lines from the novel- and how the failed Henry Percy marriage was shown. Also, Mary's lying in and both sisters' birthing scenes were very adequately stifling and scary. This could definitely be shown as an ""anti-teen pregnancy movie."" Anne's coronation was suitably gaudy and brought to film well as did the people's ill reception of her as queen. Another well-done accuracy was Jane Boleyn's betrayal; almost all sources agree she began the family's downfall. But when the King decided to forgo Mary completely just to have the HOPE of getting with Anne I became utterly disgusted with the movie and could barely finish it. This is saying a lot for me since Scarlett Johannsen and Natalie Portman are two of my favorite actresses.
  So maybe the author approved of the novel being dissected and stripped apart by this movie's portrayal, I as a fan, truly dislike this movie adaptation. I was all set to enjoy and revel in seeing some of my favorite characters and storylines brought to life, but this time Hollywood failed me.",1223164800,,2956,4.759765625

Before viewing the movie I had little knowledge about Henry VIII other than he had six wives whom he beheaded.  I was intrigued by the plot of the story and decided to investigate into the history of his rule a bit further.  I quickly found out though that the details of The Other Boleyn Girl are not entirely accurate.

I recommend this movie to anyone who is looking for over-the-top drama in a historical movie, rather than accurateness.  I enjoyed watching the movie because I had little knowledge about the historical background beforehand and felt the tension unfold as the characters' relationships became more and more complex.

3170634,3,B0017APPSE,"If you've read the novel this movie is based upon ('The Other Boleyn Girl,' by Phillipa Gregory), you'll probably be a bit disappointed in the movie.  Natalie Portman does give a good performance as Anne Boleyn, but Scarlett Johansson is less than stellar as Anne's sister, Mary.  The script focuses too heavily on Anne and her relationship with Henry VIII, ignoring the other characters that made the book so interesting: the Duke of Norfolk, Anne and Mary's brother George and the role he played in Anne's downfall are largely ignored.

Those of you who are familiar with Henry VIII are likely to be left scratching their heads over the choice of Eric Bana in the role of Henry.  While I'm sure Mr. Bana is a fine actor, he bears no physical resemblance to Henry at all.  Furthermore, the script writers left his quite one dimensional.  In their efforts to showcase the hold Anne Boleyn had over Henry, he's left appearing like a dog on a leash, rather than besotted.

Great time periods are compressed as if events that, in reality, occurred over years and years appear to have happened in just days.  This leaves the film with a disjointed feeling.

The role of Henry Percy, Anne's first husband, provides unintentional comic relief.  While he appears in several scenes (and is quite important in Anne Boleyn's life story), the poor character has no lines whatsoever and the actor is left resorting to over-dramatic facial expressions. Very funny to watch.

The one bright star in the production is the performance of Ana Torrent as Katherine of Aragon, Henry's first wife.  Not only are her physical attributes perfect for the role, but her performance is utterly believable and left me wishing her role had been larger.

If you're unfamiliar with the original novel or Anne Boleyn's story, you may very well enjoy this film.  Do not, however, believe this film is in any way historically accurate.  If you loved the novel and are a history buff, you might want to skip this one altogether and go rent a copy of ""The Lion in Winter"" for a great retelling of Henry II and Eleanor of Aquitaine....much more accurate and a good history lesson, too.",1220745600,,2150,4.772972972972973

The child at the beginning of the circle whispers a word to the kid next to them and it passes down the line becoming more distorted as it goes along. By the time it makes it back to the beginning it usually has no resemblance to what it was supposed to be.

This is a pretty good metaphor for ""The Other Boleyn Girl."" The dramatic license in Phillipa Gregory's book caused controversy but ultimately resulted in an entertaining story.

In contrast, the film plays somewhat like a game of telephone that started with a Cliff Notes version of Gregory's novel. As the film progress, the storyline spirals farther and farther outside the realm of credibility.

The life and times of Henry VIII were tumultuous, dramatic, and populated by interesting characters. It should have been an easy task to write a reasonably entertaining script about this era. Unfortunately, a fifth grader's plagarized essay on this period would a lot easier to get through than this extremely boring and disappointing film adaptation.

I can't fault Eric Bana's performance. He made a great Henry VIII despite limited screen time. Other cast members made valiant efforts to squeeze something out of the terrible script they were saddled with. Sadly, the beautiful costumes and scenery might have been an asset to this film if I could have stayed awake to appreciate them better.

My friends who saw the movie in the theatre warned me that it was disappointing if you were a fan of the book (or if you had even read the book!) and they were not wrong.

This is a horrible adaptation.  ""Loosely based"" is a generous description of what this movie did to Gregory's work.  None of the characters are well developed, so you end up asking yourself ""why did she/he do that"" at critical points of the movie because you don't have the background provided by the book to understand the character's motivation.  Also, the movie is primarily about Anne Boleyn (Natalie Portman) whereas the book is about the other Boleyn sister (duh) Mary (Scarlett Johansen).  The book's focus on Mary was what made it an interesting take on the whole Anne Boleyn/Henry VIII saga--if you want to see something purely about Anne Boleyn watch ""Anne of a Thousand Days"" or even the recent Showtime ""Tudors""--both are better.

I will say that this movie is beautiful to watch.  They obviously spent lots of money on costumes and sets, so it is a visually pleasing film.

It takes liberties that the book didn't even attempt (like suggesting that Henry actually raped Anne, and that Anne and her brother George were actually contmplating an affair just so that Anne could get pregnant. The book never even went that far!!).  Add to that the fact that they chopped soo much out of the book and made a mess of what was left (like not explaining that Mary's husband William got sick and died before she runs off and marries someone else who they only show once, without even explaining who he is or anything about him). I know that it had to be hard trying to fit over 600 pages of story into a 2 hr movie, but this was just awful.

Seymour's  daughters the mistress of KIng Henry.
Initially Anne (Natalie Portman) is selcted but after a riding accident he is nursed by Mary (Scarlet Johansen) who he coerces into becoming his mistress.
Meanwhile Anne marries the nobleman Henry Percy (Oliver Coleman) and refuses to keep this a secret, therefore being exiled to France by her angry uncle and father.

Lady Elizabeth Boleyn (Kristin Scott Thomas) is broken hearted about her children used as pawns in Sir Thomans and Norfolk's power play but is powerless to stop it.
Anne returns from France at a time when Mary is recovering from a miscarriage and beguiles the king with her beauty, charm and intelligence.
Though Mary bears the king a son born out of wedlock, Anne has enraptured the king and by withholding her sexual favours, forces his hand in wedding her.
The divorce of Queen Katherine and marriage to Anne Boleyn, as is well known, resulted in Henry breaking with the Roman  Catholic Church and founding the Church of England.
Anne bears Henry a daughter Elizabeth but the marriage is unhappy and Anne is brutally raped by the King.
Desperate for a male heir Anne unsuccessfully asks her brother George Seymour (Jim Sturgess) to impregnate her. This is discovered and Anne is accused of adultery and imprisoned. Her sister Mary begs King Henry to spare Anne's life but both George  and Anne are executed.
Mary fulfills her last promise to Anne and takes care of her infant daughter.
Ultimately one is struck by how for all Anne's machinations both girls are simply porns in a game by powerful men and don't stand a chance.
The closing scene tells us that though Anne did not produce the male heir desired by the King, she instead was the mother to Elizabeth who would reign for 45 years as one of England's greatest rulers, accompanied by a photographic shot of the little Princess Elizabeth (Maisie Smith), a truly beautiful ending and promise of great things to come out of the tragedy and heartbreak.
This is a beautifully set period piece with sterling acting and the starring roles by two of the world's most beautiful actresses.
The costumes and the background set was magnificent.
It holds the viewers attention throughout and is one of the best historical dramas on film in years.
There are historical inaccuracies and Anne Boleyn certainly did NOT at any time ask her brother to commit incest, this was in reality a malicious and paranoid accusation by Anne's sister in law Jane Rochford.

I've seen better costumes on sale at the Halloween store. No one making this movie was interested in the facts.

Anne, Mary, Henry, Katherine, how could they not be rolling in their graves? The accounts are there. I'm sorry that some people will actually believe that this is the way that it was. Books. Go read some books. Books are good.",1216944000,,678,4.697478991596639
3170678,3,B0017APPSE,"You really have to take this movie for what it is. It's just a big, dumb historical soap opera, with pretty locations, some Hollywood actresses, and a lot of nice frocks. I sat down on a wet afternoon and watched the DVD, and found it reasonably amusing. It is, of course, wildly historically inaccurate, but so was the Philippa Gregory book it was based on, so you can't be too hard on the film-makers for that. What it does lack are the book's strengths, which include tight plotting, good construction, and a clever manipulation of point-of-view throughout. When you read the novel, you see familiar events through the point of view of a naive woman (Mary Boleyn) who does not know how things are going to turn out; right up to the end, you half-believe, with Mary, that things are going to work out all right. This creates a dramatic tension that is wholly lacking in the film version. In the film, the director underlines from the start that things are going to end badly for Anne. Well, we all know she ends up decapitated, but it would be nice to have a bit of suspense along the way.

The twist in Philippa Gregory's novel is that all the characters are absolutely as bad as their worst historical reputations. Her Anne is a guilty manipulative adulteress, a portrait which is unfair to the historical woman, if entertaining in a novel; here, the film-makers shy away from making her out to be as black as Gregory paints her (Henry VIII, on the other hand, emerges as a rapist, which for all his sins is one thing I don't think any historian has ever accused him of). Other characters are softened too, notably Lady Elizabeth Boleyn, the girls' mother, and the self-seeking George Boleyn, who here is just a nice boy whose parents force him to marry a girl he doesn't like. Nor is the court the sink of iniquity it seems in the book. It is extremely annoying that Mary's first husband, William Carey simply disappears (she was actually widowed, but we are never told so), while her romance with her second husband--a marriage that is social suicide, but which is ultimately her salvation--barely gets off the ground. There is no sense of love or even affection developing between them, which weakens the story considerably. But clearly the big relationship here is the love-hate between the sisters, and any romance other than the struggle for the king's affections is purely secondary.

All in all, this is a pretty but forgettable film, with some nice costumes, a weak script, and some reasonably good acting from the female leads.",1216684800,,2541,4.695067264573991

Not wholly historically acurate, so I wouldn't use it to study for a big test. The set designers did a great job in immursing the viewer in to 15th century England.",1216425600,,281,4.0
3170684,1,B0017APPSE,"First off, let me say I am not a fan of Philippa Gregory, mainly due to her blatant disregard for history (although she claims to do extensive research for her novels, she uses no primary sources (first rule of historical research = use primary sources) and her secondary sources (which from reading the book, she appears to have only skimmed over) are often outdated or don't stand up to the test of time).  I watched the movie mainly to see the costumes (I'm a Tudor period fanatic) and to see if it would be better or worse than the book.

The Tudor period is a fascinating time, and it doesn't need to be changed or altered in order to make it more interesting.  There's plenty of love, sex, betrayal, political scheming, etc. so I'm not sure why PG felt the need to completely alter the story so much.

I won't go into all of the historical inaccuracies here, if I did, I would be here all night.  Besides, there are many other amazon reviewers who are better-spoken than me and have far more knowledge of the Tudor period than I do (I'm only a student), and they have written some wonderful reviews pointing out errors (head on over to the TOBG book page, or check out forums on IMDB).

My main problem with this movie was that it seemed much more like a TV Movie (Lifetime channel anybody?) than a Hollywood film with well-known, highly-paid actors and actresses.  The Henry/Mary relationship was almost non-existent, they have a few sex scenes, but nothing to show that they might have actually cared for one another.  Henry and Mary have TWO very short conversations before they sleep together.  And this is supposed to be our heroine, who has fallen in love?  This is preposterous even to romance novel readers.  There is no character development or relationship development between the beginning of Henry and Mary's affair and Mary conceiving.  So when Anne comes back and ""steals"" Henry away from Mary while she is pregnant, do we really feel that bad for Mary?  Not really, since we haven't seen anything to show us that Mary is in love (at least in the novel there was an actual emotional relationship, one-dimensional as it was).

The one main thing that *really* put me off of this film was the rape scene with Henry and Anne.  Henry certainly was not a wonderful guy, history has clearly shown us this, but is this scene necessary?  As far as history goes, Anne held off Henry for many years, so a rape is very unlikely (not to mention she wasn't pregnant when she and Henry married secretly (winter 1532, second ceremony in London January 1533, Elizabeth born Sept 1533)).  I'm not really sure if this scene is here to show us that ""you'll get what's coming to you"" if you act like a shrew, or if it's supposed to make us feel a hint of sympathy for Anne.  Yes Henry and Anne's relationship (obviously) fell apart, but it fell apart over a period of years, not months.  *SPOILER ALERT* Also, the ending with Mary storming into the castle and grabbing Elizabeth from her caretakers and walking out with her seems pretty preposterous.  Henry had gotten rid of Anne, but he still did show regard for his children and made sure they were properly raised.  Snatching Elizabeth, especially after the king has warned you he will not tolerate you, your pleas to him, or your family anymore, seems like asking for some major punishment to me. *END SPOILER*

Strangely enough, considering that Ms. Gregory considers herself a ""feminist author,"" the only characters remotely resembling anything feminist was the Boleyn mother, Elizabeth, who encourages her daughters to be well-educated and shows her objection to the Boleyn-Howard males pimping out their daughters for political gain (gains which usually fell to the males), and Katherine of Aragon, who acts honorably and respectably at all times.  I don't think these are the characters we are meant to admire, but Anne is made out to be a self-serving, conniving shrew and Mary is too meek and mousy to be likeable.

One major (non-historical) error:  Mary is married to William Carey, but midway through the film William Stafford asks her to marry him and leave court with him.  Um, what happened to Mary's husband (He died of the sweating sickness, but the film never shows this)?

I was hoping for some great costumes from this film, and I was very disappointed.  The fabrics were very modern (some of them looked like 1970s curtains) and seemed very out of place.  Natalie Portman basically wore the same version of a dress, just in different colored fabrics, through the majority of the film  (same for Scarlett).  Tudor fashion is amazing; the costume designers could have shown so much more variety with the costumes.  The accents of Natalie Portman and Scarlett Johansson were incredibly bad.  Portman's accent seems to have gotten worse from when she did V for Vendetta.  Also, at times certain scenes were so dark that I had to readjust the settings on my screen (which I've never had a problem with).

The one positive thing about the film is that they chose to leave out the incest plot-line that was very strongly suggested in the book.",1216252800,,5110,4.722660653889515
3170685,4,B0017APPSE,"I just finished watching this film based on Phillipa Gregory's best selling novel by the same name.  Some of the words that come to mind are dark, brooding, tragic...beautiful.  The movie is decidely more heavy than I would have expected but beautifully filmed and for the most part well acted.  I found Natalie Portman not quite up to the roll as Ann.  As a scheming, ambitious woman, she just lacked substance.  This character definitely calls for a more well rounded and experienced actress.  On the other hand Scarlett Johanson does an incredible job as Mary, the second daughter.  Believable and rich in ways Natalie Portman could never be, she plays the betrayed sister, victimized by her family perfectly.  I too wish there was more from Henry in this film, but true to Phillipa Gregory, he is always in the background as an important but secondary character.
This is really a story of family, about two sisters and their love for each other, even when not deserved.  About betrayal and runaway ambition.  In the end, it passed my test for period films, it was entertaining, and I had a sense of the time.  No, it may not be entirely historically accurate, but who cares?",1216080000,,1178,4.753694581280788

In this unemotional, historical drama, director Justin Chadwick and screenwriter Peter Morgan miss the mark not because of poor acting or directing, but because the writing is anachronistic and stale.

Once again, Natalie Portman, Scarlett Johansson and Eric Bana deliver as actors, but there is not enough substance in the script for them to rectify the film.

The dilemma of the film is given early on - King Henry's wife cannot conceive children anymore.  The solution - The Boleyn whores!

The love triangle that the film creates is on par with lifetime movies.  There is no purpose/no good reason to feel any empathy for any of the characters.  The characters are all robots - doing what they are told to do mindlessly for the aristocracy.

The strength of the film is the cinematography, but the weaknesses of anachronisms and continuity are too much (or too little?) to make up for impressive cinematography.

Ultamately, the film fails because the characters are lifeless and the pacing is unsure of itself.  I'm not sure how the film makers went about making this film without constantly asking themselves, ""what is the purpose here?""",1215993600,,1218,4.955665024630542

The acting is pretty good, although the dialogue is a big stuffy (though Natalie Portman certainly has plenty of experience delivering awkward dialogue from chewing her way through the various klunky Star Wars movies). I thought her portrayal of Anne Boleyn was good -- in fact, better than the story could carry.

This takes one of the most exciting and perilous chapters of the long and gory Tudor story and turns it ... dull. There just isn't any getting around it. They just make it dry. The perspective of Mary Boleyn would have been more interesting if they'd given Scarlet Johannson anything to do except go around looking like a sad puppy and acting like a doormat. The whole ""twist"" with George Boleyn, frankly, was not believable. The potential of Jane Parker Boleyn, so cornerstone to the books, was thrown into cameo status.

I watched this while doing some complicated work, and I was glad to have something interesting to do while I was letting this grind to its predictable and messy finish. One can say that any drama based on history is, by its very nature, predictable, but you're almost waiting for them to get on with the executions so you can roll the credits and move on.

I rented it from our local video store only because it was one of the few blu-ray titles still on the shelf, and because I wanted to see the great costume and set designs in hi-def. In fact, I was mesmerised by this movie from first frame to last. Everything about it--plot, character development, cinematography and music--was top-drawer. Easily, I would have nominated this film as a top contender for Best Film of the Year.

Particularly noteworthy were the characters, in both a lead and supporting role. Although a movie's limited time space cannot create well-rounded development, each of these characters came across as strong and unique; clearly each had his or her agenda, mixing fear, betrayal, rage and ambition as they interacted with one another and the circumstances they found themeselves in. Of course, this could not have been possible without great acting and plot development, and so credit has to be given to the writing and casting crew. In the fifty years that I've been studying film seriously, I can't remember the last movie that had such strong characterization.

So why is my review so much higher than most others? Honestly, I think it's because today's movie audience wouldn't know a good film if it bit them where the sun doesn't shine. Our society pushes people to go faster and faster to go exactly nowhere. We want action to blast our senses five seconds after we sit in our seat, and as such have no patience to allow quality movies to develop. You may note that the movie industry no longer makes classic films such as 'Lawrence of Arabia', 'Doctor Zhivago' or 'Ben-Hur'.

If you're one of those rare individuals who appreciates great drama, this is the movie for you. On the other hand, if you have the attention span of a house fly, with half the intellect, you might be better off drooling over '30 Days of Night'.",1215216000,,1997,4.765895953757226
3170702,3,B0017APPSE,"Luxuriously done and highly entertaining are some of the plus of this historical melodrama that recreates - once again - the tormented relation among Henry VIII and three of his wives. As a precedent, this film has the Alexander Korda's classic THE PRIVATE LIFE OF HENRY VIII with Charles Laughton (1933), Charles Jarrott's ANNE OF THE THOUSAND DAYS (1969) and the ridiculous miniseries THE TUDORS (2007). However, the most direct relation with a previous film comes from a good 2003 T.V movie of the same name, based on the same Philippa Gregory's novel, and with Jodhi May (Anne), Natascha McElhone (Mary) and Jared Harris (Henry VIII), directed by Philippa Lawthorpe. Thus, this 2008 version is, actually, a big-screen remake from the 2003 TV timepiece.
This new approach to Anne Boleyn and Henry VIII stands with dignity and becomes quite watchable. Natalie Portman is excellent in portraying Anne, as well as Scarlett Johansson in the role of Mary. However, Eric Bana - although a fine actor - is somehow miscasted as the King: he's far from giving even a physical approach to the character (to make this king appear as a sexy, good-looking character is a huge historical mistake), and his acting is not as good as the ones we've seen him (BLACK HAWK DOWN, TROY, MUNICH). The art direction is first rate, as well as the costumes, music and photography. It's a very entertaining timepiece, no matter the historical inaccuracies contained. And don't forget the 2003 version: it's as good - or even better? - than this one.",1215216000,,1525,4.9147286821705425
3170703,1,B0017APPSE,"To all the people who seem to think that it's perfectly OK for historical novels to be fictitious works of an overheated imagination:

If you'd search out books by writers who know what they are doing, you would never again waste a nanosecond on pulp writers of Ms. Gregory's ilk. Both the book and the movie are historically inaccurate, absurdly ineffective as entertainment and all-over criminal blasts of hot air. What REALLY happened to Anne Boleyn and the people around her was a thousand times more riveting, sexy, tragic and dramatic than anything presented here. One typical example: when she met Henry, Mary Boleyn was NOT an innocent young bride. She and Anne had both spent years at the French court, where Mary (who was the elder of the two sisters) was so notorious a round-heels that contemporary writers were moved to mention it. And this corrects only one of the dozens of imbecilic falsehoods perpetrated by Ms. Gregory.

For an infinitely better read, check out ""Brief Gaudy Hour"" by Margaret Campbell Barnes, ""The Concubine"" by Norah Lofts, or even some of Jean Plaidy's less thrilling but serviceable Tudor titles. For film treatments, rent ""The Six Wives Of Henry The Eighth"" with Keith Mitchell for the real scoop, or ""Anne Of The Thousand Days"" with Genevieve Bujold, which sticks to the gist while taking bit of dramatic license.",1215216000,,1353,4.9298245614035086

It was okay that it strayed from the book's plot, and the costumes were very good, but the story line and acting left a lot to be desired.  It just doesn't show real passion in King Henry - for anything.  Little to nothing is presented about Wolsey and the church, which would have given strength to the premise that the King went to the extent he did for Anne Boleyn.  You just don't believe it.  Johansson is nice, but Portman's acting is as flat as it was in Star Wars.

It did focus the most on Anne, especially towards the end.  I really wanted to learn more about Mary because she seems to be the forgotten sister.  I was watching with a friend and the timeline in the 2nd half of the movie went by so quickly that I had to explain most of the jumble of scenes that were happening...she had no idea what it all meant.

I watched it on a recent flight just to see how Scarlett Johanson and Natalie Portman would work in their respective roles, because they both seemed cast because they had the right hair color. Scarlett has the 'sex bomb' persona, Natalie always seems so much colder.

In the end, Scarlett's portrayal of Mary touched me, though historically it cannot be anywhere near the truth. Mary would never have been allowed near the king before Anne's execution (the whole family were fleeing in every direction imaginable to prevent them from being caught up in the king's anger), there's no evidence the king gave her a promise for Anne's life, etc etc.

A final thought: a number of reviewers mention how willing the Boleyn/Howard family was to sacrifice the two sisters. In fact, all three siblings (brother George included) were sacrificed. He, too, was executed - for supposed incest with Anne. Mary is the only one who survives the fiasco, to live a quiet and happy life with second husband Stafford.

Whatever. I liked it more than I thought I would.",1214956800,,1108,4.821052631578947

The acting was excellent, especially by Portman. The sets, costumes, and cinematography were lush. No shortcuts were taken, and the production quality of this movie is superb. If there was a weak link in the acting, it was Bana. On the other hand, he was playing a banal and shallow person, so perhaps that is why he seemed to fade into the background when paired against the strong personalities of the female characters. This is one of the few movies that my wife and I wanted to see over again immediately after finishing our first viewing. Please read the excellent review by ""Jem"" to get a better understanding of the entertainment value this movie has in store for you. If you haven't rented it yet, you really should.

That's what I felt like doing when I got to the ending of this movie, perhaps the most absurd ending I've ever seen. It's a real shame. I've been reading everything I can about the Tudors (Anne especially) for about 10 years and of course, I read the book. While the book is very inaccurate and is pretty unfair to Anne, it's an overall enjoyable read. Despite the heavy material the book covered, there was still a light, fluffy, romantic feeling to it. The movie was shot dark and dreary, losing a great deal of the entertainment value of the book. There was ZERO character and romantic development in this film. The actors couldn't seem to decide whether or not to do English accents. The production felt comparable to a TV movie. I think the only thing anyone really worked on for this film was the costume design. I've seen lots of period pieces but these costumes were absolutely stunning. But the whole movie felt like it was slapped together. It just jumped from time period to time period leaving out major events and people. (WHERE'S WOLSEY???!!) It was even more inaccurate than the book. It was almost like the screenwriters just decided to rewrite history. Let me put it this way....I was actually thinking that Anne was going to survive and live happily ever after with Henry.",1214611200,,1374,4.5894308943089435

I spent half my time while watching just filling in the gaps for my husband and daughter.

However the whole ""Anne slept with her brother George"" was the plot point that had me putting the DVD back in the Netflix envelope. Having read a number of books on this subject, most authors and scholars see that charge against Anne Boleyn as false, only a means for Henry to execute her and make way for the next wife.",1214611200,,651,4.258064516129032
3170712,3,B0017APPSE,"I would not study history of England based on 'The other Boleyn girl (2008) but I enjoyed it and found it quite entertaining. Boleyn girls, two sisters, Anne (Natalie Portman) and Mary (Scarlett Johansson,) were gorgeous and Henry VIII (Eric Bana) long before he looked like on his famous portraits by Hans Holbein, Jr, the object of both sisters' desires was very appealing.  Kristin Scott Thomas played Lady Boleyn, Anne's and Mary Boleyn's mother. Scott Thomas has so much class and dignity about her, and I like her in every movie I've seen her.

I actually did not know that Mary Boleyn, the older Anne's sister (in the movie she was younger), had been Henry VIII's mistress and might have (or not) had a son with him. According to the movie and the novel by Philippa Gregory it was based on, Mary had a son with Henry who then fell in love with sharp-witted, alluring, and unavailable Anne who firmly refused to become the king's mistress. So great was his desire for her, it led to Henry's annulment of the 20+ years marriage with the queen Katharine of Aragon and split with Catholic Church thus starting the Church of England. Katharine of Aragon comes as a decent and intelligent woman  played by Ana Torrent. Now, that's the most pleasant surprise of the movie. Eight-year-old Ana Torrent gave an unforgettable performance as ""Ana"" in the film El espritu de la colmena (The Spirit of the Beehive) by Vctor Erice. She was memorable in the relatively small role in Justin Chadwick's historical drama comparing to Portman or Johansson.

Anne Boleyn was a remarkable and bright woman, (bitch as she was, quick-tempered and spirited) and it is  clear that her daughter Elizabeth, the future greatest Monarch in the England's history, Good Queen Beth inherited strength, iron will, brilliance,  and brain from her mother. The fact that Elizabeth did not want to get married only speaks in her behalf - she was smart enough not to let any man to tell her what to do and to dominate her. Her mother Anne was not that lucky. The second part of the movie, the fall of Anne Boleyn, ""Anne of Thousand Days"" was rushed, sensational, and much weaker than the promising beginning. Since those historic figures had been dead for almost 500 years, it is easy to come up with any shocking accusation toward them - they won't defend themselves. Anyway, the costumes and the sets were the feast for eyes, I was not bored and after the movie was over, I spent some time researching on the web the key players of the real life drama that was set in the beginning of 1500s, changed the future of Europe, and included love, lust, ambitions that would destroy the family ties, rise to power, and deadly fall from it.

3170714,2,B0017APPSE,"This is a re-review of this movie. I reread The Other Boleyn Girl and I decided to give this movie another chance. But I was able to get it for free this time rather than paying for it.

Upon watching it again I'm still not completely sold on it. It's only moved up to three star for me from the original two. I'll say why.

It's only loosely based on the book and history. Instead it more focuses on the rivalry between the sisters over the history that was really all important in that day and age. But I still felt that Mary was missing in a lot of the film, as was George, who was so instrumental in the book.

Natalie Portman's Anne grew on me in the second viewing, but I still prefer Natalie Dormer's Anne.

I'm still horrified that the director had Henry rape Anne. That was totally and completely unnecessary. This man was in love with this woman and I highly doubt he would have done so. That was truly a shame.

I also still feel that this movie was rushed in the end. You went from seeing Anne on top to a steep descent to the bottom. And sure, it was quick, but this movie add G's to it.

And again Katherine of Aragon should have been given a larger part in this film. Ana Torrent(?) I believe would have been phenomenal in this role had she been given a larger part.

The costumes and the sets were amazing though. The colour is real and you almost want to touch. It's like visual eye candy. That's a real redeeming quality to this film.

3170718,4,B0017APPSE,"The King of England (Eric Bana) has had bad fortune - his wife has miscarried a male baby and left an absence where an heir should be.  With the need of succession, the King soon tires of his queen, and it becomes rumored that he may desire a mistress who can conceive a baby boy.  In walks royal sycophant Thomas Howard (David Morrissey), a power-hungry family tyrant who just happens to have two gorgeous, young nieces and ambitions of pseudo-royalty.

In a matter of no time, Howard convinces Sir Thomas Boleyn (Mark Rylance) to pimp one of his daughters.  Together they choose the precocious Anne (Natalie Portman) to seduce the King, mainly because she's the daughter who is not married, during a stay at the Boleyn family home.  Their plan for Anne to whore herself in anticipation of royal favor, much like giving away livestock, soon fails as Anne leads a group of men - along with the King - on a hunt gone awry, producing an injured King and a family decision to let the other daughter Mary (Scarlett Johansson) nurse the monarch back to health.  With his pride and dormant libido revived by Mary, the King soon gives her a job at the castle; and along with the job for her husband, the way is paved for a marriage dissolved and an illegitimate child to be born.  Anne quickly feels slighted, and a sibling rivalry ensues.

Subertfuge, betrayal, secrets, and a royal-political chess game on the grandest of stages soon leads to an intense story in which ""the other Boleyn girl"" soon becomes a phrase that defines this movie's struggle, where the difference between being revered and beheaded is only a single moment or decision away, and where sisters engage in a sibling version of Desperate Housewives proportions while destroying the country.

A very dark, twisted storyline mixes perfectly with the bright, vibrant, incredible cinematography and costume design that vividly highlights the romantic flair and scenery during that period, as well as the battles often associated with the ascent to royal supremacy.  While this adaptation may have historical inaccuracies, the surprise twists to the well known ending and the pairing of two of Hollywood's most beautiful starlets makes a worthwhile, entertaining movie.",1214006400,,2229,4.935828877005347

Having read Philippi Gregory's tantalizing book ""The Other Boleyn Girl,"" which this film was based upon, I was looking forward to the film until I heard Natalie Portman was cast as Anne Boleyn.  I knew then the film was in trouble, not that Portman is a bad actress, just seriously miscast as the fiery, sly, manipulating, and conniving Anne.  Anyone who's seen Showtime's ""The Tudors"" with the very fine acting of Natalie Dormer as Anne will know what I'm talking about.

Eric Bana who is usually a good strong actor, was surprisingly one dimensional and flat with the exception of the love scenes with Scarlett Johansson, which were although brief, quite alluring. Bana didn't begin to pull off the emotional turmoil and layers of obsession that Jonathan Rhys Meyers as Henry VIII does so wonderfully in ""The Tudor's, and Bana and Portman had zero chemistry.  You can say pretty much the same for Katherine, Queen of Aragon as Henry's long suffering wife (except of course, for the love scenes with Scarlett Johansson, which could have been more interesting than this entire film). Once again, ""The Tudors"" excels with Maria Doyle Kennedy cast as Katherine, Queen of Aragon, who is riveting. The casting agents for ""The Tudors"" and as well as for ""Elizabeth"" have a rare talent indeed.

Scarlett Johansson performance, although somewhat on the understated side, was the only actor who felt believable in this film, and Kristin Scott Thomas, if given a more beefy part, probably would have stood out as well.

With a few exceptions, for the most part the costumes and scenery were also mediocre, lacking the exquisite richness and sublime beauty that dominated in ""Elizabeth"", and to some overall extent ""The Tudors"".  The era may have not had good lighting, but they made up for it in the beauty and reflective glow of candlelight, the depth of colors, the contrast of  light and dark, and an overall mystery to their environments.

All in all, I found the film to be flat, poorly directed and poorly cast all around, and felt bad for Philippi Gregory, who wrote such a fine book.",1213833600,,2353,4.979591836734694
3170722,2,B0017APPSE,"I read the Philippa Gregory novel years ago, and even though I wasn't that into the Tudor history at the time, I enjoyed the author's take on the Boleyn sisters very much.  So, having read and enjoyed the aforementioned novel, I couldn't wait to watch the DVD.  I won't go into plot details, for most people here have read the book and I'll spare you another synopsis.  However, if you haven't read the book, then you'll probably be either disappointed with the somewhat soap opera-ish plot or be kind of lost when you get watch this film.

First of all, the costumes and period feel look very authentic and beautiful.  Unlike the Showtime TV series The Tudors, which seems to show a version of the sixteenth century fashion and mores that fit to their liking rather than mirroring reality, this film focuses on how things were really like in those times.  (To the costume designers of The Tudors -- women in those times wore headdresses ALL THE TIME!  They were considered harlots if they did not.)  Other than that, however, I found the film rushed and the story very soap opera-like, depicting Anne Boleyn (Natalie Portman) as both a petty and jealous sister and a victim in her desperate attempts to have Henry VIII's heir.  Portman did a terrific job though.  The accent is okay and her performance is wonderful.  I am less impressed with Scarlett Johansen, who seems more concerned with looking pouty and pretty than putting on a convincing performance.  I also didn't buy into the fact that Mary fell in love with Henry in such little time and with nothing but sex and a few conversations in common.  I had that problem with the novel, and I had it with the film as well, but somehow this problem is more glaring in the film, seems everything is very much glossed over.  The actors who play Henry VIII, Jane Boleyn, the Duke of Norfolk, Katherine of Aragon, etc., get very little airtime and are cardboard cutout characters at best.  Needless to say, I am disappointed with the film.  Gregory is a wonderful writer of historical novels.  I recently read The Boleyn Inheritance and loved it.  The filmmakers should have done more than just make this film look pretty.",1213833600,,2173,4.673684210526316

3170724,3,B0017APPSE,"The film adaptation of Philippa Gregory's novel ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" left something to be desired. I can list dozens of things wrong with it, but I'll go with the ones that stick out the most.  Anne Boleyn was not shipped off to France as a punishment for secretly marrying a pre-contracted Henry Percy; her father Sir Thomas Boleyn had brought her back from the French Court several years before she ever met Percy, and she was banished to Hever Castle for her indiscretion.  Mary Boleyn is portrayed in the film as a wuss, while in the book she could breathe fire as readily as Anne could.  She's also depicted as having had only the one child with Henry VIII when she had both a girl and a boy with him.  Mary's first husband, William Carey, disappears roughly half-way through the movie, leaving the impression that he went to European and never came back.  The truth is that he died in 1528 from the dreaded sweating sickness, freeing Mary to later wed William Stafford, her second husband.  Henry VIII forcing himself sexually on Anne Boleyn is fictitious; he may have been many things, but a rapist wasn't one of them.  Anne didn't shake or cry at her execution, but went to her death bravely and composedly.  Mary Boleyn Stafford permanently left the Tudor Court with her children and her second husband to live the rest of her life in the country, but she didn't take Elizabeth with her.  The child lived away from the Court in near poverty with a governess and skeleton staff until Jane Seymour, Henry VIII's third wife, persuaded him to bring both Elizabeth and his older daughter Mary back to Court.

Now for the performances.  Natalie Portman does a creditable job as Anne Boleyn.  Scarlett Johansson's portrayal of Mary Boleyn is so bland that it's nearly colorless.  Jim Sturgess is quite good as their brother George Boleyn, while David Morrisey, Kristin Scott Thomas, and Mark Rylance (who last Sunday night won a Tony Award for his performance in the play ""Boeing-Boeing"") give solid support as the Duke of Norfolk, Lady Elizabeth Boleyn, and Sir Thomas Boleyn.  Eric Bana is acceptable as a young, virile Henry VIII.

The larger casting error here was Scarlett Johansson.  She is unconvincing at best in this period piece.

The in-depth political intrigue, skulduggery, deadly betrayals and debauchery were vividly depicted. You became totally enmeshed in the 16th Century, Tudor atmosphere. It also made you realize that if there were ever a time-machine, it would not be a Century you'd like to visit...particularly as a woman.

It became clear that the only thing separating women from chattel, was their momentary status, which they manipulated to elevate, their attire and whether or not they were being served, or the servant.  Either position was not enviable. In the DVD Featurette, Gregory described the 16th Century as possibly the worst time to be a woman...""they were simply beasts of burden.""

The film was visually splendid!  The set, the costumes...everything was a feast for the eyes.  However, the story itself, represented only a small portion of the book.  The Producer decided to focus only on the relationship between Anne and Mary as they vied for the King's attention and the drastic steps they would take, at the behest of their ambitious family. The battle ensued, as they both began lusting for the Queen's chair. With Anne, it became a game of control and power, for Mary it may have been one of devotion. But, from either viewpoint, it was a disaster waiting to happen.

Natalie Portman, best portrayed the fiery Anne. Johansson's role as Mary was not one of her best. She had very little change in affect throughout the entire movie.  Her beauty couldn't save her in this one. Bana was an excellent King Henry, depicted in his youth, when he was virile and strong...long before the paunch. Katherine of Aragorn (Kristen Scott Thomas) tugged at your heartstrings, as she has in all historical documents of that time. Hers was the ultimate betrayal, as she was so loved by the Court, only to be outcast for not producing a male heir.  But the impact on England's religious/political histories, remains today, making her one of the most integral characters of the King's Court, an area that should have been given more depth.

If you haven't read the book, or studied the 16th Century, you might be a little lost with this film.  I would suggest that you watch the Biographies and Featurettes at the end of the DVD, as they will fill in some of the holes left in the movie.

I wish the movie could have been more in keeping with the book, but realize that it would have required a movie of epic proportion, that would have probably been cost prohibitive and perhaps too long, in order to capture it all.

I'd recommend seeing it once, but suspect many won't want to add it to their keeper shelf for repeated viewing.  If you haven't read the book, I strongly recommend it, though. It IS on my keeper shelf.",1213660800,,2893,4.712301587301587
3170728,4,B0017APPSE,"I thought the movie was good.  Yes, I am a fan of Scarlett Johansson, Natalie Portman and now Eric Bana (who is hot in this film) but it was nice to see the younger version of Henry VIII and not the crazy old man who once was king.  Plus, the movie is visually beautiful.  Anyone who is in to period films will most likely enjoy it.",1213660800,,332,4.0
3170729,3,B0017APPSE,"I have very mixed feelings about this movie.  Yes, the costumes were outstanding, I even think that the actor who portrayed Henry did a fairly decent job (and a very good looking younger Henry he made, too).  I do not really care for Natalie or Scarlet in particular, but they didn't do all that bad of a job, considering the script they had to work with.  I love all things Tudor, so I was disappointed, again, to find that known truths were toyed with and manipulated.  Mary did not take Elizabeth (a very young Elizabeth, actually...I believe Elizabeth would have been a bit older when her mother was beheaded, maybe 3ish?) from court and raise her with her children as was implied in the end of the film...perhaps she visited from time to time, but she was not whisked away by her Aunt. She had her own household, and was away from court much of the time during her younger years.  I also do not believe that Henry forced himself on Ann, I have read many books on both Henry and his family and I do not recall ever reading any such thing.  I believe he was frustrated with her and may have been angry at feeling manipulated, and also I believe that they did eventually have relations before their marriage, but he didn't rape her.  However, I can say something positive...they did a great job with the sex scenes...barely any skin shown and the ""rape"" scene was a mild as you can get.  The rape scene in Rob Roy is far more graphic and upsetting.  Kudos for handling these scenes with some class.  But, all in all, only three stars because I dislike when people twist and turn facts to suit their needs.  Things happened as they happened, and I'm not sure if Henry were able to attend the opening of The Other Boleyn Girl, that he would have been pleased at the final product.  So, I stand with Henry, and I'm somewhat dissatisfied.",1213574400,,1836,4.447761194029851
3170730,2,B0017APPSE,"This is my first review on Amazon. Becuase I found this movie to be a complete disspointment is why I decided to write a review. My review is based soley off of this movie as based off of the original book and not historical accuracy. When this movie first came out in the theatres I was excited to see it becuase I had heard that the book was excellent. Becuase I am one of those people that absolutely must read the book before the movie I read the book just a few months ago knowing that the DVD was going to come out. I found all 661 pages of the book to be very engaging and entertaining. Although the characters were all 'grown up' from the beginning of book, the author established the characters throughtout the events and timeline of the book. You knew who the characters were and what their qualities and behavior were like. This movie did not establish these characters at all nor establish the relationship each sibling, George, Anne and Mary had with one another. I also was dissappointed in the script for Henry. I thought Bana did the best he could with what was given to him which was a lot of fancy costumes and not enough dialogue. However, and I must mention this, in the book, Henry did not rape Anne. I'm not sure why they put that in the movie. There were many mini-plots throughout the book that weren't even touched in the movie at all. According to the book, Mary's first child was Catherine, not Henry. Furhtermore, Anne was absolutely horrible to her sister Mary in the book. Maybe one thing the movie maybe sort of got right was that dispite how horrible Anne was to her sister, Mary was always loyal to her. But how this movie depicted their mother as someone who cared and loved for her daughters was all wrong. She was a cold business women in the book. There are too many inconsistancies between the book and movie to go on. But from one book and movie lover to another, I found myself completely dissappointed last night when I had finished the movie.

The whole storyline is wrong, let's just start with that.  I know that there was a time when people thought like that (give my daughter to so-and-so and hope that it'll help me climb the social ladder), but why would we want to promote this type of behavior and make it have some sort of appeal to it?  I think that the acting was amazing and the costumes were excellent, but that is all I have good to say about the film.  And when did it become alright to have a rape in a PG-13 movie?!  Someone please answer that for me!!  I rented this film because, yes, I was intrigued by the story, but usually when there is something like rape in a film, it is usually mentioned in the tiny box that explains why the film is rated what it is.  You will not find the word ""rape"" anywhere on that box, not even ""strong sexuallity,"" just sexuality.  When the film was over, I was scratching my head over several things: why did Henry go back on his word and execute Anne anyway and not even have the guts to explain it in person to Mary?  Why did the makers of this film try to leave you feeling sorry for Anne when Mary was the one who suffered in every way imaginable and then return to stand by her sister?  Why do we want to watch these things, but then we never want to mention in public that we did watch it?  And finally, why do we watch things like this, and when we go to write reviews about them on the internet, we never mention the disgusting and nauseating rape or rapes that we see in them?  All I can say now is that I am in desperate need of a shower with a lot of soap, and it's not because I played in mud.  (Spiritual mud, maybe.)",1213488000,,1785,4.036931818181818

3170733,1,B0017APPSE,"""The Other Boleyn Girl"" is simply a bad film, not because of historical inaccuracies (what historical drama DOESN'T play with the facts?) but because it suffers from a terrible script, some unfortunate casting and an assumption that every viewer is already a scholar who doesn't need further instruction on why what's happening on the screen is happening. It is also just not very entertaining.

The film is an adaptation of a Philippa Gregory bestseller of the same name that takes a look at the classic story of how King Henry VIII of England fell in love out of marriage with the notorious Anne Boleyn and began an affair that marked England's break from the Papal power that ruled Europe. But that film doesn't really look at that story, it is instead a retread into typical teenage melodrama, and a tame one at that with a PG-13 rating.

To be fair, ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" boasts some excellent production values. The costumes are stunning and the cinematography is very lush and beautiful. But direcetor Justin Chadwick's finished product is a stale, boring take on a fascinating tale. Characters are never fully developed or explained, we never really get to know King Henry (Eric Bana) or understand the world he lives in. The plot revolving on why the Boleyn sisters (Natalie Portman and Scarlett Johansson) are enticed to seduce the King is never fully explained, in fact, we don't ever truly understand what interests their male family masters have in injecting them into the King's court,all we hear is ""it will be of great benefit to our family,"" and that's it. The world of these people is never established. Consider the fact that Henry's marriage to Anne sparked a major uproar which resulted in the establishment of the Church Of England. This is completely skipped over, you never even know that the Catholic church had an iron grip on society before Henry meets Anne or afterwards. Instead the movie lingers on uninteresting, cliche scenes where characters hush adolescent passions to each-other in darkened halls, or shots of Portman and Johansson looking at each-other with girlish jealousy.

The casting is also a bit off. Bana is good as Henry, but he is never allowed to inhabit the screen or conquer a scene, instead he is reduced to short, soap operish dialogue. Portman is wrong as Boleyn, she plays what should be a dark, seductive character more as some sort of confused, innocent teenager. Her performances feels out of place with the role, but then again her character is never defined. The same goes for Johansson's Mary Boleyn who after the second half, is reduced to just a walk-in who is apparently just meant to stand there looking teary-eyed at the camera.

Some have complained about dramatic license the film takes with history, when it comes to film it's pointless, the best period films, from ""A Man For All Seasons"" to ""Elizabeth"" have taken liberties with history. If you want the hard facts go READ, the faults of this film all lie in the bad writing and the obvious fact that the film suffers from a marketing ploy: People were more concerned with having Bana, Portman and Johansson all on the same screen. Too bad nobody bothered to give them a decent movie to participate in.",1213315200,,3223,4.833333333333333

3170735,4,B0017APPSE,"I won't comment on historical inaccuracies here since I am not that familiar with them, especially in regard to Henry and the Boleyn family.
This film is very entertaining to watch and it is visually pleasing, with the period costumes, castles, and other trappings of the century represented.  Portman, Johannsen and Bana do good solid work as the main characters in the royal intrigues.  The film also gives a good example of the low status of women at that time and how they were expected to produce male heirs or else fall into disgrace and be abandoned by their domineering husbands.
  There was a tremendous amount of pressure placed on young women not only in that regard but also re: their entire family's position and future.  Girls were married off not to men they loved, necessarily, but to men who could provide wealth and reputation or even repair broken relationships or warring empires.
  The ending was spot-on in showing that Henry's desire for a son and his despair at not having one should not have been such a worry for him, considering that he and Anne produced Queen Elizabeth I, who ruled England for decades.",1213315200,,1131,4.769230769230769

It is one thing to have so many historical inaccuracies but to have so many inaccuracies that relate to the novel as well is just ridiculous. Why make the crappy movie at all?

This movie is NOT by any means meant to be a serious portrayal of what happened between Henry VIII and the Boleyn family. It IS a very entertaining interpretation of what might have happened given the very spotty records we have from the time.

Sets and costumes are gorgeous, characters are written to be larger than life and the dialogue made me go ""Oh, snap!"" more than once in the theater. Acting is fine, Portman may have overplayed a little but she *is* portraying freakin' Anne Boleyn. Johannson makes Mary Boleyn a very sympathetic character, the heart of the movie. If anyone falls flat it's Bana who makes Henry VIII seem like a dunderhead totally being played by the ambitious families pushing their daughters into his bed to win influence.

Honorable mention to Ana Torent playing the role of Queen Katharine, who is forced to take both Boleyn girls into her service just so Henry can have access to them. Awk-ward!

Finally, if you like the movie at all, check out the book. The book is ALWAYS better ;) Part of the reason plotlines seem a bit tangled and incomplete in the movie is because there is so much detail involved and only 2 hours to cram it into.",1213228800,,1351,4.570247933884297

3170745,5,B0017APPSE,"After seeing this in the theatre, I was ready to give it 5 stars.  I love period movies, especially about the Tudors, and I really enjoyed this one.  However, after watching the deleted scenes on the DVD, I realized this movie should have been much better!

When I ordered the DVD, I had already resigned myself to little or no features.  Elizabeth, and Elizabeth: The Golden Age were sorely lacking.  Most period movies have few extras, despite having such a treasure trove of history to mine.  However, I was surprised and delighted with the excellent selection of special features on this DVD!  First, there are several deleted scenes, many of which should have been included in the film.  For the most part, they centered around Mary and gave more insight into her life with her husband after Anne supplants her, plus some calculating scenes with Anne.  One scene with Mary's husband upon seeing her ""bastard"" child of Henry was quite poignant.  All of these would have enriched the movie to be more than just two women in rivalry for a king.  It could have been 5 stars and would no doubt have pleased more people who saw the film.  Also included in the extras was a feature called ""To Be Lady"" about court etiquette and the precarious life of a woman, even noble, in those times.  It featured interviews with the author, some college history professors, and the cast/crew of the film.  Women were often exploited in that time to the benefit (or detriment) of their families.  And Mary and Anne were no exception.  Another excellent feature was about translating history to film.  They discussed the book vs  vs the movie, what they used of history, how the expanded on Mary's lesser known character.  I have not read the book this film is based on, and didn't feel any urge to do so after seeing the movie.  However, these two features and the interview with the author and cast have piqued my interest in the novel.  I definitely intend to read it now.

Many DVDs throw in biographies of the characters just to have another extra to list.  They are usually nothing more than frozen screen shots a viewer clicks through.  But, this DVD included bios of 5 principal characters which included interviews from the author, historians, the cast and crew, coupled with footage from the movie.  They were like mini-bios from A&E.  Very well done, and I would recommend first time viewers of the movie watch before the film as they really help to keep the characters straight (such as Mary's two husbands, William Carey and William Stafford who look enough alike with the same name that I sometimes confused them).  The DVD also includes a commentary, which I didn't listen too because I find them very boring.  Overall, a fantastic set of features on a single disc edition.

As to the film, I thought the costumes and sets were phenomenal, the story was very good and the casting spot on.  The cinematography is expertly done, and helps set the tone and tell the story as much as the script.  Some viewers have complained that Natalie Portman wasn't good as Anne Boleyn.  I've read a lot of history books and historical fiction on Anne and I thought she played the part true to the person (if not the book, which I can't comment on).  Anne Boleyn wasn't a raving beauty, she was striking.  Her major appeal came from denying Henry and being intelligent, ambitious, manipulative - in short, a match for him in many ways.  She intrigued him.  Portman brought all these qualities to light in her portrayal.  Scarlett Johansson actually exceeded my expectations.  I have only seen her in a couple movies, and the parts didn't require much effort.  However, I thought she embodied the somewhat nave and soft Mary, who is quickly disillusioned about the real world, and even her family.  The two women played against each other beautifully.  In one of the features, the director mentions how in the book it is often not clear which of them is ""the other"" Boleyn girl and that he uses this in the film.  He does, and it works to great effect.

Eric Bana as Henry is perhaps the weakest casting choice, but he wasn't bad by any stretch.  History bears out that Henry was young, handsome, charming and athletic until injured falling from a horse so Bana fit that fine.  Bana is best as the temperamental king who is at once attracted and disgusted by Anne's manipulation, and drawn to Mary's docile nature.  His interactions with other characters didn't really stand out, but the movie was focused on the women so this was fine.  Two other stand outs were Anna Torrent as Queen Katherine of Aragon and David Morrissey as the Duke of Norfolk.  Though her role was small, Torrent's Katherine made a big impact.  She commanded every scene she was in.  She was at once regal, and pitiable, as the victim of her husband's desperation for a male heir.  Morrissey played a consummate politician - calculating, controlling and just a bit sleazy.  Without him, it would be difficult to sympathize with either Anne or her family.  His ruthless game of chess, in which they are pawns was vital to the film. Yes, liberties are taken with historical fact, but some license must be given to film as its own art form just as for a historical fiction.  Not much is known about Mary Boleyn, but this film certainly stirs the imagination of what she may have been like.

Overall, I highly recommend this DVD!",1213228800,,5380,4.68409818569904

3170748,4,B0017APPSE,"""The Other Boleyn Girl,"" (2008), a historical costume drama/romance about the 16th century relationships of Anne and Mary, two sisters of the Boleyn family, and that notorious old Tudor bluebeard, King Henry VIII of England, arrived at these shores in spring.  It boasts a high-powered cast, and lovely location shooting.  It is based on the popular novel of the same name by Philippa Gregory,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Other-Boleyn-Girl/dp/B000W4FO1O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Other Boleyn Girl</a>, with screenplay by the currently hot Peter Morgan, directed by Justin Chadwick.

This period of English history is, of course, very essentially dramatic, therefore very popular, and often treated in literature, theater, and film.  The Cliffs Notes go: Henry is crazed with lust for Anne, who denies him; Queen Catherine (Aragon, of Spain), will not give him an excuse for an annulment or divorce; he therefore breaks with the Catholic religion, and anoints himself the head of the new Church of England, in order to be able to grant himself his intensely desired divorce to marry Anne.  But he rather quickly tires of Anne, and it's therefore ""Off with her Head,"" so that he can marry Jane Seymour, who will give him his fiercely desired male heir, while, unfortunately, dying in childbirth.  Jane will be followed by three more wives, with varying degrees of luck.  There was also, of course, many a mistress --including Anne's sister Mary --- can we now hear a chorus of ""It's good to be King??""

The excellent cast is headed by those two luscious young stars, Scarlett Johansson as Mary, Natalie Portman as Anne; both gorgeously gowned by Sandy Powell.  And these girls can act, though their English accents sometimes waver.  Eric Bana plays Henry Tudor.  Ana Torent holds the screen as Catherine of Spain, Henry's first wife.  Jim Sturgess makes his small part, as the tragic George Boleyn, heart-breaking.  Mark Rylance and David Morrissey are good as Sir Thomas Boleyn and Thomas Howard, Duke of Norfolk, the girls' scheming father and uncle, willing to use their own flesh and blood for advancement, as they threw both sisters at Henry, playing them off against each other. Kristin Scott Thomas turns in a towering performance as Lady Elizabeth Boleyn, who sees her children used and destroyed in pursuit of the family's ambitions.

Many have quibbled with the historical accuracy of this picture: among other things, it shows Mary as the younger sister, when she was the elder.  But I was a Renaissance History major, and studied this period, and the picture gets the general outlines right.  Human life was cheap, and that of women, be they ever so young, beautiful and blue-blooded, even cheaper.  The picture does not make it as clear as it could that the plot against Anne was orchestrated by Cromwell, her mortal enemy.  But it does show us that Anne's likely true love, Harry Percy, and her uncle the Duke of Norfolk, were forced by Henry to be on the jury that doomed her.

It goes beyond the scope of this movie, but the Howards, a rich, powerful, avaricious and ambitious family -- still-- evidently thought they had plenty of spare beautiful young girls with which to tempt Henry.  Later, they were to throw yet another niece, the pathetic young Catherine Howard, at the horny old monster Henry had become, as his fifth wife.  That marriage didn't end well for her, either.

""The Other Boleyn Girl"" is, of course, a chick flick, but it's lushly filmed, and completely engrossing, even to those who generally don't go for that genre. Boring, it ain't.",1213142400,,3613,5.098471986417657
3170749,4,B0017APPSE,"Professional and audience reviews of this movie have, for the most part, demonstrated a lack of knowledge and/or understanding of the Tudors, Henry VIII, and the Boleyn girls. The Tudors were probably the most conscious of the need to have a queen provide an heir in the centuries when the lack of one spelled the end of dynasties. Henry VIII in particular was desperate for a male heir, to the point that his queens were either divorced or beheaded for not providing one. He was the ultimate ""stud"", and had many mistresses, but the availablity of a young woman who combined beauty, sexuality, and the possibility of providing that heir was more than enough to cause the divorce of Katherine of Aragon, a break with Spain, and the invention of the Church of England, all of which was blamed on Anne Boleyn. She had more spirit than Mary, and there is nothing to contradict the fact that she held Henry at bay until he agreed to make her his queen. She didn't want to be cast aside like her sister, and he saw the chance for a son.
All this was accurately presented in the movie; Henry was not yet the obese Holbein portrait so Eric Bana was physically acceptable in the part. As to the girls, the portrayals were excellent, the accents more than adequate (my English friends had no problems), the differences between the personalities very well defined, and the acting of a very high standard. Contrary to what some reviewers have said, Natalie Portman seems to be incapable of being anything less than very good and is mostly superb, and as Anne she was excellent. Scarlett Johansen improves with every film. Producing a movie like this will never satisfy everyone because there is so much that could be included, but which must be left out because of time restrictions. For what it was intended to be, ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" is excellent and worth watching more than once.",1213142400,,1876,4.670694864048339

Granted there's a palpably pulpish tone to this fanciful 2008 historical fiction based on Phillipa Gregory's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/2002-novel/dp/1416560602/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">2002 novel</a>, but the royal intrigue in the House of Tudor is overwhelmed by melodramatic flourishes and transparent character development. First-time feature director Justin Chadwick (BBC's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bleak-House/dp/B000CEXG0U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bleak House</a>) has made a handsome film with an attractive trio of stars, but he places most of his focus on the soap opera elements of the book's adaptation by Peter Morgan, a specialist in merging fiction with truth (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Queen/dp/B00005JPAO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Queen</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Last-King-of-Scotland/dp/B000NIVJF4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Last King of Scotland</a>), and lays waste to what could have been a more fully rounded historical drama.

The overstuffed story begins with a cursory portrayal of the Boleyn sisters, headstrong Anne and diffident Mary. Even though Mary is married to wealthy courtier William Carey, the sisters soon find themselves in a competition for the affections of King Henry VIII, thanks to the machinations of their weak-willed father Thomas and their Machiavellian uncle, the Duke of Norfolk. Henry is initially drawn toward Mary's gentle nature, siring an illegitimate son as he is still married to the barren Catherine of Aragon. However, Mary's difficult pregnancy and mandatory bedrest opens an opportunity for Anne, who uses all her cunning wiles to land the King. At the expense of Mary's happiness, Anne succeeds but not before the creation of the Church of England and her own ascension to England's Queen. Meanwhile, Henry evolves from gregarious womanizer to haunted despot, and everyone already knows what becomes of Anne at the end. The film's perspective alternates between the sisters, thus reducing Henry to a convenient plot device. Thanks to the film's broad brush strokes, the challenge for the viewer is to monitor the imbalance between the sisters. For instance, Mary is rather bland in her virtue but her story is affecting, while Anne is comparatively intriguing in her blind ambition but her fate feels less than tragic.

I still think Johansson is the more natural temptress onscreen, but she actually plays Mary and manages to elicit sympathy to her character with surprising ease. However, Portman gets the lion's share of meaty scenes and runs with them, especially a couple of effective face-offs with Henry. As expected, both are alluring in period costume even as their accents waver a bit. As Henry, Eric Bana seems to have been hired for his brooding persona and beefcake appeal, while the character's lightning-fast transitions make Henry an elliptical figure at best in Morgan's truncated script. Kristin Scott Thomas again brings her innate chilliness to the abbreviated role of Boleyn's mother, while there are mildly interesting turns by Jim Sturgess (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Across-the-Universe/dp/B000ZLFALI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Across the Universe</a>) as devoted brother George, Mark Rylance as Thomas, and David Morrissey (Sharon Stone's befuddled paramour in the execrable&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Basic-Instinct-2/dp/B000FS9UKI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Basic Instinct 2</a>) as the Duke of Norfolk. Spanish actress Ana Torrent brings conviction to her few scenes as Catherine of Aragon. Sandy Powell, no stranger to the period (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shakespeare-in-Love/dp/B00001U0E1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shakespeare in Love</a>), designed the exquisite costumes, while John Paul Kelly's sumptuous production design feels authentic. Kieran McGuigan's richly colorful cinematography is undermined by his recurring tendency to use a side-swipe effect to transition shots. Production details aside, the film remains stubbornly hollow at its core.

Starting with Chadwick's zealous albeit sometimes overly technical commentary track, the 2008 DVD has a robust set of extras. Thumbnail sketches of the film's historical figures are provided in brief video snippets with insight provided by scholars and various members of the cast. Two featurettes are also included - a ten-minute short, ""To Be a Lady"", which discusses the severely limited role of women in the 16th century, a theme addressed pretty well in the film; and another ten-minute short, ""Translating History to Screen"", which prominently features Gregory and focuses on how a voluminous bodice-ripper of a book had to be pared down to a running time of 115 minutes. Separately, there are twelve scenes presented, mostly expanded versions of the ones that ended up in the film and none I would consider indispensable to the final cut. Rounding out the extras is a brief reel of a test used to calibrate the HD cameras used during the shoot, as well as eight previews of other films.",1213142400,,5772,6.29456384323641

3170755,4,B0017APPSE,"I asked some friends recently if I was crazy for actually enjoying this movie, and while the majority told me that I was indeed crazy I found solace in the fact that a select few (my smarter friends w/w) shared my adoration for this film.  No, `The Other Boleyn Girl' is not perfect and it is not brilliant but it is entertaining and passionate and quite memorable.  I find much disgust with the way that this film is being advertised now that the DVD release is close at hand (today, right?); the film being paraded off as if it were nothing more than a period version of `Gossip Girl'.

`The Other Boleyn Girl' is much more than that, and it deserves to be regarded as such.

Telling the fictionalized true story of the Boleyn sisters and their effect on the King of England, `The Other Boleyn Girl' is not without its fare share of drama.  The two sisters couldn't be any different.  Anne is the eldest.  She is outgoing and fresh and extremely charismatic.  She is the apple of her father's eye, the one he invests his hopes and dreams in.  Mary is a stark contrast to her sister.  She is simpler; doe-eyed and quiet.  She is reserved and shy which translates into a warmth that is most becoming.  She may not be immediately noticeable, but once she catches your eye you are swept up in her mystery.

The film opens on the wedding day of Mary Boleyn.  She is happy and hopeful in what her new life will bring her.  Her sister Anne is equally excited, so gleeful at the opportunity to share in Mary's day with her.  But then the mood shifts as Anne is summoned before her father and Uncle and given a most interesting and surprising commission.  It is becoming local gossip that King Henry is unhappy with his wife, Katherine of Aragon, and her inability to produce for him a make heir.  Anne's Uncle suggests that she make herself available to the King when he comes to visit so that she may become his mistress, which will of course mean good things for the Boleyn family.  Anne accepts the request, with disastrous consequences.  Anne's personality is abrasive and strong, and while this serves as an immediate draw it actually pushes the King away and into the arms of Mary.  When Henry decides that he wants to make Mary his mistress instead of Anne he sparks a jealous rage that destroys not only the Boleyn family but leaves its stain amidst the entire empire.

The first thing one will notice about `The Other Boleyn Girl' is that on the surface it is a beautiful film.  The set designs are flawless, the costumes are radiant (even more so than last years `Elizabeth' debacle) and the cinematography is stunning.  But focusing on these mere facets of the films larger picture would suggest that this film relies on surface value alone, which is not the case.  Underneath the beautiful exterior lies a gritty story that is told wonderfully (for the most part) and is littered by some superb performances.

Scarlett Johansson and Natalie Portman tackle the roles of dueling sisters Mary and Anne.  Portman may be the most flamboyant and may garner the most immediate attention, but it's Johansson's brittle and soft performance that truly stole my admiration.  Portman makes Mary a showboat, a canvas for scene stealing antics, which work to the nature of her character.  She has the silky sensuality down pat and works it to produce magic with the audience; drawing them in with her wispy words and her piercing stare.  Johansson instead builds a trust with the audience by creating a likable and compassionate character out of Mary.  We watch as she slowly allows her guards to fall, her pain and suffering exposed for us to see as she is mistreated and walked all over all for a crown that doesn't even fit.  Scarlett says more with her eyes than anyone else within this film can mutter.

Eric Bana is a great actor who really needs more high profile film roles.  He manages to make King Henry a desirable man (he truly is beautiful to look at) but the film is ultimately uninterested in him and thus he becomes cast aside at the focus of the two Boleyn girls.  He doesn't quite yet have the commanding presence of some of his peers (I can only imagine how amazing Russell Crowe would have been in this role) and so he suffers from lack of interest.  His performance is good; great even in moments (when he unleashes himself on Anne towards the end I finally took real notice of this man) but he never truly becomes the `reason' we are watching the film.

The supporting cast, while never given much to do, manages to deliver to the best of their abilities.  Jim Sturgess especially is heartbreaking as the sister's brother George, and Mark Rylance and Kristin Scott Thomas are memorable as the Boleyn parents; especially Thomas who allows her pain and disapproval be made known to her husband and brother.

My main complaint with `The Other Boleyn Girl' is that as the film progresses the dialog and situations start to get repetitive.  I understand that if pregnancies and miscarriages were what happened then you have to include them, but I feel that the film could have found better ways to go about it.  The repetitive nature caused the film to lag a bit towards the end.  Some have noted that the film feels a bit soap-operaish, but I didn't really get that.  Sure, it's not as high profile or as richly stern as some period classics, but the film is serious and dark and maintains that same aura throughout.

Like I said, I wholly enjoyed this film.  Sure, it's not a masterpiece, but it is far from rubbish as far as I am concerned.  The performances are rich (the accents are not as badly uneven as some would have you believe) and the film is altogether a beautiful visual experience.  The story is a moving and painful one, and I felt that director Justin Chadwick crafted an accessible and entertaining film that does not disappoint; at least not in my book.",1213056000,,5882,4.590038314176245
3170756,1,B0017APPSE,"Or better yet, smash the director's face.  This movie was painful.

3170757,2,B0017APPSE,"I work for a bookstore and when I saw the novel The Other Boleyn Girl by Phillipa Gregory, I was very intrigued. I bought and read it in about a week and absolutely fell in love with it. I especially loved it because I am a fan of the show the Tudors and am a history buff. When I found out the book was going to be a movie with Natalie Portman and Scarlett Johannsen I was very excited and expected it to be really good. Boy, was I wrong.

The movie was terribly disappointing. Here's why:
  The book is about Mary Boleyn and her experiences through the years that included her liason with the king and her sister Anne's. Mary is the other Boleyn girl. The book is about her experiences, her feelings, and her loves. Whoever wrote the movie made the entire story about Anne! And Mary was once again tossed in the background. I absolutely hate it when movies based on novels aren't true to the author's work, and The Other Boleyn Girl is no different. If I wanted to watch a story about Anne Boleyn, I would watch The Tudors, which is more accurate. This is supposed to be Mary's time to shine. And although Eric Bana is hot, he made a terrible Henry VIII.
Spoiler ** Henry rapes Anne in the movie when he becomes tired of her games. NOT IN THE BOOK AND NEVER HAPPENED!!!! Henry was obsessed with Anne, yes, but he never went that far.

Whoever wrote this movie needs to learn to treat books with more respect and be more true to the novel.

The characters are very bland. Eric Bana has very little to do in the film. His screen time feels wasted and unimportant. Natalie Portman does what she can, but she feels out of place. Her accent is OK, but i expected better from someone like her. Scarlett J. is the only one in the film that actually remembered to act. I actually cared what happened to her as opposed to anyone else. Kristen Scott Thomas, as the mother did a great job in a small role. The actual script is bland and a tad on the boring side. The editing could use some work as they switch from one time fram to another in a matter of seconds. One scene, someone finds out they are pregnant, then literally, the next scene, they are giving birth. It is very jumpy at times. The costumes are lovely and accurate. As for how accurate the actual film is, that is up to debate but I am sure they embelished QUITE a bit.

3170761,5,B0017APPSE,"""The Other Boleyn Girl"" is one of those movies everyone will like one way or another. It has the historical appeal, lush sets and costumes, an all-star cast and a wonderfully evil plot. What strikes me most about this movie is how the conflicts and plights of these characters still exist today, and to a great extent. It is a very watchable, yet moody film, the one I am sure I will watch again.
The semi-true story centers on two sisters, Anne and Mary Boleyn. Mary (Scarlett Johansson), although she is younger, gets married first and settles into the country lifestyle she is fond of. This leaves Anne (Natalie Portman) eligible to become King Henry's (Eric Bana) mistress, but once he arrives to the country, he falls for Mary rather than Anne. Much to the disapproval of their mother (Kristin Scott Thomas), their father and uncle ship them off to the court of England, where Mary is to become King's mistress, despite her marriage. However, Anne is the head-strong sister who won't be happy until she has made a life for herself, and from then on, the sisters combat each other, the King's wife and fatal ambitions.
Although Bana and Johansson give satisfactory performances, it is Portman who is the heart and soul of this movie. Her portrayal of the woman who is responsible for the English Reformation is both seductive and profound. Also, Kieran McGuigan's cinematography is wonderful, and kudos to Peter Morgan, whose screenplay captures the time and place wonderfully.

Anne did not get involved with Henry until after his affair with Mary was over. She did not ""steal"" him from her sister, and certainly not while Mary was pregnant. Anne married Henry Percy?? Really?? Funny, I've never read that in a single biography. Yes, betrothals were viewed as sacred as a marriage, but it is my understanding that they were denied the right to become formally betrothed. I'm not even sure why the ""secret"" marriage ceremony was included in the story.

Mary did not go to the palace and grab Elizabeth and raise her. The incest incident was even dismissed during Anne's lifetime as an attempt to legitimized her murder. So many things wrong with this movie historically... I'm sad to think that there are those who will walk away from this movie thinking they've gotten the real story. Natalie's shining moments were at Anne's trial and execution. Her performance was moving and realistic. I give this movie three stars for those moments alone.

The costumes are pretty and the actors aren't too bad, with Natalie Portman doing a decent job as Anne Boleyn.  The problem I have is with the rediculous hack job they did in editing. Scenes just chopped into others without any form of a transition, and you are just left in confusion. They never explained what happened to William Carey (Mary Boleyn's 1st husband) in the movie, and she just magically is married to William Stratford in the end.  They also forget to mention that Mary has two children in the book not just a son, and they sadly do not delve into Mary and William Stratford's courtship, which was one of the most enjoyable portions of the book.

10. Off with her head!

Well watching this movie felt like the director sent an assistant to read the Cliff notes, then got the assistant drunk and then based the story on what the assistant told him

Henry the VIII is not exactly praised in the book, but he's not a rapist.

But Henry is not the only character mutilated in such a fashion. The books rich tapestry of feelings and sublety is shredded in a way that cannot simply be blamed on the change of format from book to movie.

Almost every role is dreadfully miscast, especially William Stafford, who in any responsible adaptation should have been a man of clear ability, not doe-eyed innocence. The all important son is basically ignored and that's just the beginning.

3170770,2,B0017APPSE,"""The Other Boleyn Girl"" charts the story of the fortunes of Mary Boleyn (Johansson) - Anne's (Portman) less famous younger sister - in her earlier bid for the affections of King Henry VIII (Bana). It also covers the major points of Anne's relationship with the avaricious monarch, as he divorces himself both from his barren-yet-faithful wife Katherine of Aragon (Ana Torent), and the Roman Catholic Church.

Good points first: the cinematography and production design in ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" are stupendous. There's a real sense of reserve and quietly simmering passion in the hazy lighting and dream-like camerawork, and the sets and costumes are duly lush and incredibly detailed. Visually, Scarlett Johansson is a great choice to play the innocent, buxom Mary Boleyn, and there are several moments where ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" looks like a moving painting, reminiscent of Vermeer or Holbein.

Unfortunately, almost every other element of ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" is below-par, not least of which is a truly awful script. It's a kind of mishmash of faux-Tudor dialogue peppered with contemporary phrases so the audience can follow the story - but sadly, it's overdone and cheesy. And the movie's truncated running time means that major events of the film - such as Henry's discarding Mary for Anne or his divorce from Katherine of Aragon (a major event in European history) - are given the briefest of scenes depicting them, before the too-thin script takes off to cover yet more ground. There's no real sense of drama or danger anywhere in the movie.

And it's because of this poor scripting that Eric Bana doesn't get much to do: I'm still not sure that he was in love with either Mary or Anne Boleyn, such is Bana's one-dimensional and expressionless reading of one of History's most vibrant kings. Portman as Anne is alright, but she doesn't really capture the intensity or the ambition of this most forward-thinking of women in history - nor does she touch on the dangers of Anne's situation when her marriage to Henry begins to fail. And Scarlett Johansson comes off as a bored simpleton. Other cast notables include Kristin Scott-Thomas as the Boleyn Matriarch (yawn, she's not around for much of the movie), Mark Rylance as Daddy Boleyn (with one expression of less-than-fatherly concern slapped to his face for all of his scenes, this guy gets really boring really quickly) and David Morrissey as their uncle, the Duke of Norfolk (high camp in Tudor tights: this guy's been nominated for two consecutive Razzies - I'm not surprised, and he's not good).

All-in-all ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" is a one-dimensional romp through some dull acting and poor writing, saved from one-star hell by its beautiful appearance. You'd be better off with a few episodes of season 2 of ""The Tudors"" - high-camp soap opera that doesn't try to be anything else. ""The Other Boleyn Girl"", sadly, is too high-falootin' to really recognise its own limitations, and it's in this pretension that the audience, once again, loses out.

Not recommended.

PS: For fans of the book: avoid this one. The book is one of my favourite novels, I've read it many times, and this movie by itself is bad enough - when compared to the book that spawned it, it's just plain rubbish.",1206057600,,3255,4.930656934306569
3170771,4,B0017APPSE,"I saw this one in the theater.  It seems to be getting some mediocre reviews, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. Obviously, there is some historical fact.  As most of us know, Ann lost her head over love.  How much of the rest is accurate?  I have no idea.  This is a story about the Boleyn family, King Henry VIII, and surrounding people.  It is not about war or anything else.  It includes: deception, lies, and the goals of achieving power and wealth by using people.  There are also 3 violent scenes that I had to hide my face from (but I am a wee bit sensitive).  Still, I very much enjoyed the movie and thought the parts were well played. I heard someone call it a ""chick-flick,"" but I did not see that as accurate. Natalie Portman (from one of the Star Wars movies, as Luke & Leia's mother--and other movies) did a great job as Ann Boleyn.

The story begins with the 3 Boleyn children playing on the grounds of the family's huge English estate, while the father plots of whom he might marry his daughter(s) off to, to secure wealth or power.  Next thing you know, the children are all grown up.  Ann is the eldest.  She has a sister, Mary and a brother.  Ann is a pretty girl.  She is also very independent and with a fiery disposition.  Mary is more plain in appearance, a simple quiet soul.  Mary marries a simple young man and they hope to live a quiet life in a small village somewhere.  Mary and her husband have no interest in the English Court.  Then things change.

The Duke of Norfolk, in the best interests of King Henry VIII of England, decides to help the king out.  The Duke is also uncle to the Boleyn children.  The Queen has born a daughter and had still-borns trying to bear the king a son.  The king and queen are barely speaking at this point, so the well-meaning Duke decides the king needs a girlfriend, who could maybe bear him a son while she's at it.  The Uncle and the Boleyn father try to set up the king with Ann, promising her that when the King is done with her, she will be set up with a nice Duke or Earl (maybe the Duke of Earl :-)  Then the Boleyn family would be set for life. (Those English estates were often inherited and cost money to maintain.)

Well, as luck would have it, Ann is all ready to enjoy the pleasures of the King's generosity, when the King does a flip and takes an interest in Mary, because of her good nature, honest, kindness, etc. (and Mary is pretty too--just more plain than Ann.)  This causes a bit of tension between the girls as the whole Boleyn family moves to Court to, again, enjoy the generosity of the King.

I don't want to tell you any more because then you will know everything I know.  Most of you already know what happens to Ann and that is where the movie ends, but I found all the stuff in between pretty interesting.  I wanted to get up from my seat for a couple of minutes but could not walk away.  By the way, Queen Elizabeth was the daughter of Ann and Henry.

How about the Boleyn father.  Nice guy, huh?  ""Take my daughter and just set me up financially.""

Just a side note, but I would not recommend this for your children.  Children sometimes see things that invoke fear, project the fears onto people they know, and have fear, nightmares and bad feelings for years.",1205712000,,3251,4.2894736842105265
3170772,3,B0017APPSE,"There seems to be quite a revisionist movement afoot in Hollywood these days. After decades of picturing Henry VIII as a fat, bearded man who could always be seen tearing a bite out of a turkey leg, the type of role Charles Laughton would (and did) play, an image perpetuated by American and British film. In the last few years, there has been a definite effort to make the role seem sexier. Given the shenanigans the Tudors got into, this isn't surprising. Who wants to see Laughton bedding the beautiful, young actress playing Anne Boleyn, or Jane Seymour, or one of his other wives. So Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, the young Irish actor who made a memorable impression in, among other films, Woody Allen's ""Matchpoint"", is the King of England in Showtime's ""The Tudors"" and Eric Bana (""Hulk"", ""Munich"") takes the throne of England in the new film ""The Other Boleyn Girl"".

Henry the VIII (Bana) is desperate for a male heir to take over the throne of the country when he dies. His wife, Katherine of Aragon (Ana Torrent), has just given birth to a stillborn son and he is so furious he can barely look at her. The scheming Duke of Norfolk (David Morrissey, ""Basic Instinct 2"", British TV's ""Viva Blackpool"") knows the King will soon stray and fortune will favor whichever family can provide him with a mistress. His brother and sister-in-law, Sir Thomas (Mark Rylance) and Lady Elizabeth (Kristin Scott Thomas, ""The English Patient"") have two daughters, Anne (Natalie Portman) and Mary (Scarlett Johansson). The Duke convinces his brother they should host the King and manages to convince him if they were to arrange an affair between the King and Anne, the Boleyn family would be much the better for it. The King arrives and Anne is practically thrust into his face, but he is put off by her forceful nature and comes to fancy Mary instead. But as Mary has just married a merchant whom she loves, this complicates matters, but not much. Anne suspects her sister of going behind her back and their relationship becomes strained. When Mary becomes pregnant, and the pregnancy proves difficult, the family decides to try to make Anne the King's new mistress. But Anne wants more and has since learned how to make men give her what she wants.

""The Other Boleyn Girl"", directed by Justin Chadwick (who comes from British television) and based on the popular novel by Philippa Gregory, is a handsomely mounted production, but it can't quite escape the soap opera elements at the core of the story.

I'm not sure how Gregory actually researched the subject matter, but this film and ""The Tudors"" seem to be plundering the same treasure chest of material. If even a small portion of this material is based in fact, the Tudors were one randy family - and this is a very different view of what we are used to. Royalty is supposed to be noble, elegant, above reproach. This is, of course, the fairy tale version we all grew up with, and anyone with half a wit realizes royalty are real people. And real people with a lot of power and money tend to abuse both. The Tudors were, apparently, no different. Bana's Henry the VIII carries on affairs with women when he becomes the slightest bored with his current wife. It doesn't help their relationship that his wife is unable to provide him with a male heir, someone to leave the throne to, to ensure the stability of the country. As he feels this is his lasting legacy, he feels it is of the utmost importance. His desperation to find an heir, and his randy nature, lead him to the comfort of many women. It even seems to be a well-known secret the King strays. The Duke of Norfolk, one of his trusted advisors, recognizes the signs and wants to ensure his family can benefit from the King's wandering eye.

While this is certainly intriguing, the problem is Bana is pretty bland. At one point, Henry the VIII learns one of his gifts has been refused and he blows up, shouting. This is about the extent of the fireworks from this man, the King of England, a man who would change the course of his country's history for good and bad. Throughout the rest of the film, he merely walks at a fast pace from one location to another, painting a vivid picture of his frustration, but little else.

Eric Bana has been in a number of films and we keep waiting for that ""Great Eric Bana Performance"". He came close in Spielberg's ""Munich"", but overall, his career has been one big disappointment. He's a good-looking guy, but I suspect he isn't a great actor, which is why his performances are so universally mediocre (i.e., ""Hulk"").

Natalie Portman plays Anne Boleyn, and she does a pretty good job. When approached by her father and uncle, she is initially intrigued by the idea of becoming the King's mistress. But when this doesn't work out, she is sent to France, to become a member of the Queen's court. Upon her return, she is a different woman. When the family needs her again, she decides to make sure she gets what she wants and starts to manipulate Henry. How does she do this? She refuses his attentions, his gifts and this makes him desire her all the more. In fact, she wants to be Queen. One small problem, Henry is already married and that pesky Catholic Church frowns on divorce. As Anne manipulates the situation to her advantage, and Henry starts to do things that will forever change the course of England's history, Portman makes Anne seem extremely, utterly devious and manipulative in her own right. She clearly did learn a thing or two in that French court.

This performance, full of different moods, actions and shenanigans is a role most actors dream for. It allows them to show off their skills. More often than not, this type of performance ultimately becomes hammy and overdone. But Portman manages to play all of the facets of Anne's character while keeping her just this side of human. She doesn't downplay it, she is just more subtle than I could have imagined or believed.

Scarlett Johannson plays Mary, the ""less-attractive"" daughter of the Boleyn family. So it comes to everyone's surprise, including the audience, when Henry falls for her instead. Mary is supposed to be plain and simply seems more boring than anything else. She wants to marry a common merchant and doesn't seem to have the designs her sister has, so when Henry favors her, she pleads with her family to convince him to take Anne instead. When this doesn't work, she agrees, for the sake of her family. Mary is not the ""less-attractive"" daughter. She is simply the less-interesting daughter. As the story begins, the two sisters are inseparable. When the King favors Mary, this puts a strain on their relationship because Anne doesn't believe Mary didn't seduce the monarch. Later, she returns to the court, to plead with Henry to spare Anne's live. He asks her ""Why are you here?"" Apparently, he has as much trouble as the rest of us figuring out why she even cares about her sister, because she shows so little emotion.

Kristin Scott Thomas plays Lady Elizabeth Boleyn and she is quite good. As a female living in this society, she has a very definite idea of what her role is and could be. Because she has to live by the stringent rules governing women, she is frustrated. But she is not without a certain amount of power. She is frustrated, angered, maddened and annoyed by her husband and brother-in-law's manipulation of her daughters, of their efforts to basically prostitute the two young ladies. She is fully aware their new roles could help the family, but she recognizes how morally wrong the idea is.

The film is, as mentioned, handsomely mounted, and despite the soap opera strains in the story, it is an interesting film but it would be a better film with a more mature director at the helm. In virtually every scene, there is at least one shot looking through a doorway, panning across a railing, looking out from the interior of a coach, the fabric fringe obscuring the view, looking through wooden fraught work. It simply becomes annoying. Chadwick is trying to give us the feel of how conspiratorial this society was, how people were likely eavesdropping on everything. But this technique is overused, and abused by about the fifth time it happens. Then, every time it occurs, it stands out like a glaring thumb and draws attention to the fact we are watching a film. When we become conscious we are watching a film, it draws us back to the real world, ruining any chance we have of getting lost in this time, this world, this land of make believe.

For that, you are probably better off turning on the television and catching the latest episode of ""The Tudors"".",1205712000,,8613,4.678547854785479

Yet the writers have taken enough artistic liberties to raise questions regarding the accuracy of these accounts.  This story is based on the historical fiction novel&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Other-Boleyn-Girl/dp/1416560602/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Other Boleyn Girl</a>&nbsp;by Philippa Gregory.  Despite the artistic liberties taken with the story it  is very well put together and interesting to watch for those willing to broaden their historical views on the period.

The Story and the Acting

The story of King Henry VIII's many romantic exploits are well known.  He married Catherine of Aragon for political gain, yet engaged in many well publicized affairs. Eventually, each of the Boleyn sisters landed in his crosshairs.

Eric Bana is very good as the king, though his isn't the best written role in the film. Anne Boleyn's character is dynamic and vindictive, and Natalie Portman shows her range here.  Her sister Mary, played by Scarlett Johansson, catches the King's attention.  Though she is newly married, her husband is disposed of and the King has soon added her to his list of conquests.

But Anna will not be outdone.  She coyly preys upon the King's desires, and soon becomes the object of his affections.

All three of these actors put in strong performances.  Johansson's role is understated and Bana's is exaggerated.  Only Portman has a character with full range, both manipulative and vulnerable.

Jim Sturgess, whose star seems to be rising, has a somewhat understated role as the brother, George Boleyn.  His role is ultimately manipulated by the powers that by to undermine Anne when her perceived value falls.  He is perhaps the most under-utilized actor here, with few lines and a role not in keeping with the importance he played in history.  Yet with his lead role in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/21/dp/B0018CWW5K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">21</a>&nbsp;to add to this one, he is clearly not hurting for work.

Yet the sets and the costumes are also characters here, as in any period piece.  The castle is made shadowy with expert lighting.  The costumes and the makeup are also beautifully done, though I can't comment on just how historically accurate they are.  Yes, we can expect Academy Award nominations in many categories, including costumes, set design, art direction and cinematography.

The DVD Extras

While the DVD version of this includes the standard commentary track to accompany the film, it is the other extras that really add dimensions to the story.  There are bios and back-stories of principal characters which were close in production value and content to something one might watch on The History Channel.  Including the standard author, cast and crew sound-bites, there were also interviews of historians to put the story in context.

Warnings and Considerations

At the close of the picture, after the inevitable historical event which everyone familiar with the story will be expecting, there is a somewhat strange montage of all the characters which includes brief captions explaining their fates and the historical significance of the events they took part in.  The notes are hard to read, somewhat prosaic and are definitely subjective.  Yet they do seem to convey a message which I conclude was intentional: that the somewhat petty sexual and interpersonal exploits of this group of people had tremendous historical consequences for the UK, Europe and the world.  This is very subjective, yet it partly justifies what is otherwise a very convenient and abrupt technique to end the movie and tie up all the story lines neatly.

This is definitely a version that is not for kids.  The story deviates in sometimes shocking ways, with the sex turning violent in at least one scene.

Some of the actors do suffer from a loss of their accents in some scenes, yet the in-the-moment performances make that easy to ignore.

Conclusion

If you're a fan of period pieces and all things English royalty, this movie is already on your list.  It's worth the price of admission.

Enjoy!",1204934400,,4727,5.743884892086331
3170774,3,B0017APPSE,"With so many good actors, they could have done so much better. And yet, we get this, a rather boring, inconsistent and inaccurate film full of fluff. I was expecting a great and passionate love story. Granted, it is really hard to make a love story where Henry VIII is involved. In the story of the two Boleyn girls as mistresses  (and one wife) of Henry VIII, Johansson and Portman do the best with what they are given. I have nothing much to say about this movie because I didn't get much out of it. It was boring and I could not wait for it to end.

3170775,4,B0017APPSE,"It is the year 1518; after years of marriage, England's Queen Catherine has delivered a still-born daughter, much to the chagrin of King Henry VIII.  The ambitious Duke of Norfolk suggests that his niece, Anne Boleyn, become Henry's mistress and give him the male heir he desires.  The King doesn't take to Anne, but is attracted to Mary, her younger, married sister, and an affair begins.  Mary has a son, but Henry abandons her and pursues Anne who insists that Henry marry her.  To do that, Henry severs relations with Catholic Rome.  His short marriage to Anne is disappointing; when she produces a daughter, he tires of her.  She is accused of treason and adultery and executed.

While the film's costumes, sets, and photography are truly sumptuous, something is lacking here.  As much as I enjoyed watching it, the film was immediately forgettable.  The story has been told many times before and there is nothing new here nor are the performances memorable enough to stand out from previous renditions.

Scarlett Johansson (Mary), Natalie Portman (Anne), and Eric Bana (Henry) are all fine, but not remarkable.  The script plays fast and loose with historical facts and time and lacks a feeling of high drama, but it is a visual feast.  It's a pleasant-enough tale that could and should have been better.",1204761600,,1310,4.904545454545454
3170776,3,B0017APPSE,"For a soap opera, THE OTHER BOLEYN GIRL is reasonably diverting.  I enjoyed myself while watching it and it even made me go to the internet when I got home to look up the ""real"" story behind Anne Boleyn, Catherine of Aragon and many of the other historical characters presented in the fictionalized world of the film.

The movie succeeds primarily due to three nice performances. Erin Bana, as Henry VIII, is a different Henry than I've seen before.  He's younger and certainly handsome enough.  He's a more modern king...not just some fat, turkey-leg munching pig.  He's plenty manly, and seems to primarily be a reasonable guy...except when it comes to his roving eye.  Scarlett Johannsen is the shy sister Mary, who doesn't seek the limelight, but catches Henry's attention and falls in love with him.

Natalie Portman, in one of her livelier performances, is Anne Boleyn, the sister who dreams of climbing the social ladder, and seduces the king by sheer force of will and psychological manipulation.  Her role is certainly the juiciest one in the film and she handles it quite well.  We see her ambition and we see her at the height of success and at the absolute lowest of states.  We grow for a time to loathe her and then to embrace her again.

The movie basically tells a story of how these two sisters manipulate and are manipulated as they jockey for position in the king's court...or try to stay out of it altogether.  We see each of them achieve a grand height and a remarkable low.  Because it's set in a historical time period, it has that sheen of respectability that all period pieces seem to achieve.  Yet at its heart, it is a soap opera...one that is actually fairly predictable.  Most of the minor characters in the film are merely caricatures, and most are not very likeable.  Kirsten Scott Thomas shows some strength as the Boleyn mother...but mostly I yearned for someone to give this gifted actress a great, big part again.  It's been too long.

The script is also a bit scattershot.  It assumes we understand just a bit too much about the real history.  (For example, when Henry's first wife, Catherine, is put on trial, it would certainly have helped to know the historical circumstances that led her to be Henry's wife in the first place.)  Yet it is also trite all to frequently.  When Henry first seduces Mary, their dialogue is merely generic flattery.  Mary is supposed to fall for Henry during this scene...but the movie fails to make us ""fall"" for Henry at that time.  It's tough to make a person like Henry VIII likeable, because we've all got pretty hard and fast ideas about the kind of person he was.  If the movie had made his likeability easier to see and then made his torment a bit more approachable...the movie would have gone from generic to something truly special.

I don't want to take away from Portman's performance in particular.  The movie is entertaining enough and Portman good enough to make it worth seeing.  But it seldom rises to the level it aspires too.",1204588800,,3012,4.67490494296578
3170777,2,B0017APPSE,"Natalie Portman, Scarlett Johansson, Eric Bana, a bestselling novel, and an Oscar-nominated screenwriter--all these elements should form a brilliant, talented collaboration, but unfortunately the novel is hacked into an incongruent muddle of scenes which are further ruined by the atrocious editing.

It is based on Philippa Gregory's bestselling novel The Other Boleyn Girl, and tells the story of two sisters, Mary (played by Scarlett Johansson) and Anne Boleyn (played by Natalie Portman), who bother vie for King Henry VIII's (played by Eric Bana) affection (if only they knew he was not the one-girl-type). It is a time in England when girls were as their mother lady Elizabeth Boleyn (played by Kirstin Scott Thomas) put it ""...Traded like cattle for the advancement and pleasure of men."" The girl's father (played by Mark Rylance) wants to catch the eye of the King to secure wealth and status by ""pimping"" his daughter Anne to be the King's mistress. King Henry passes over Anne in favor of the quiet submitting daughter Mary, but once she is pregnant with his illegitimate child, he quickly turns back to Anne who has returned to the court scene with a newfound sensual, seductive confidence. As Henry falls hard for Anne, Mary is quickly swept aside so the stage is set for the inevitable conclusion.

I did read the book and loved it. However I generally enjoy film adaptations no matter how far they stray from the book. Film and book are two completely different types of storytelling, so with that said the reason I did not like this film was not its major detractions from the book, but the incredible dull, emotionless production.

The acting from Natalie Portman, Eric Bana, and Kirstin Scott-Thomas was top-notch, especially Portman's (I am convinced had this been a better production and release date she would probably be garnering nominations). The rest of the cast could not hold up. Scarlet Johansson's acting was cringe-worthy as she never removed the same complacent, angelic expression from her face (she didn't even cry when her sister's head was chopped off!) and spoke in the same tone the entire film.

The production itself was not bad, the sets, costumes, etc. were all quite exquisite. The problem with this film was it had so many good aspects it could not make use of them. The editing, I must point out, was the downfall of this great story. All the scenes were so disjointed and quick that you never had time to get pulled into the story. Helping it along was the frustrating script which had lines spoken so impassively and for the sole purpose to inform the audience what was going on that it was devoid of any eloquence or originality. I felt there were whole sections left out that I knew because I had read the book, but someone new to it would be thoroughly lost.

This is such an unfortunate botching of an intriguing tale, and once again feels like the producers did not know what to do with all the talent they had. It not only is a horrible adaptation, but a very poorly done film that moved through its' material so quickly it lost its' emotional depth on the way. At the end you are left still waiting for it to start, and are so detached you do not even care about the characters whose lives were so horribly ruined. The only reason I would recommend anyone to see this film is to see Natalie Portman's performance which is utterly fascinating to watch as she plays this illustrious historical figure.",1204502400,,3451,4.783557046979865
3170778,2,B0017APPSE,"Perched stupidly between an austere prestige picture and a tempestuous bodice ripper, ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" is little more than a posturing goof ball that happens to feature a semi-decent turn from Natalie Portman. Why this movie was made, and the purpose of its tone, is beyond me. It almost makes ""Marie Antoinette"" look restrained.

Based on Phillppa Gregory's novel, which pads the story of Henry VIII and his marriage to Anne Boleyn - as if the split from the Catholic Church and Boleyn's eventual beheading needed it - ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" introduces us to Anne's moon-faced, guileless sister, Mary (Scarlett Johansson).  It's she, not Anne, who's the first pawn in Sir Thomas Boleyn's plan to ensnare Henry (Eric Bana) and cement the family's royal bloodlines. It's Mary who goes to court, bringing Anne in tow. Mary, who drops her sap of a husband to crawl into the king's bed.  Mary, who bears the son that Henry's first wife, Catherine of Aragon, couldn't provide.

But Anne only trails until halftime, so to speak, returning from a short exile in France to pour all kinds of sugar on the grim, sad-faced Henry while Mary's bed-ridden, awaiting her child. Anne taunts Mary with this knowledge as payback for Mary's betrayal during Anne's first, ""secret"" marriage. According to Peter Morgan's screenplay, Anne's hard-to-get routine is more or less the source of the great schism between Henry's England and the Catholic Church. When the king finally ""has"" Anne, it's in a fit of petulant  rage after a scolding from wife Catherine. The movie's final act concerns Anne's rule as queen and her eventual execution.

How accurate is any of this? Who knows. History generally tells us that Mary got around quite a bit more than Anne did in the French courts; a sweet simpleton she was not. Gregory's book  acknowledges this; the movie does not. The bigger problem lies in Justin Chadwick's oppressive direction, which throws an odd, dark tint on the visuals and the portentous music over too many scenes. That's a holdover from the movie's Oscar hopes - dashed once it became clear ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" has all kinds of lapses and absurdities, not the least of which features Mary riding alone on horseback, presumably for days, to save her sister's life, and walking out of the castle with Anne's daughter Elizabeth to ride that same horse back home.

Gregory's novel doesn't exactly have a healthy scorn of Henry's intelligence, but, as Bana plays him, Henry's a chiseled stud with a Dom DeLuise beard and a pea brain. The man was indeed an oaf, but history's shown him to be a brilliant one: A musician, a poet and an accomplished thinker. Henry enjoyed as much power, if not more, than any royal before or since. The movie doesn't reflect it. Bana, a dark-eyed brooder, is the wrong fit for the role.

Portman, however, makes an intriguing Anne. Her looks fit the paintings of the queen to some extent, and the actor manages to suppress that giant, unflattering grin of hers. Portman's  never going to be a particularly great actor - charmed lives such as hers rarely produce the needed range - but she's endearing in her own way, and the role of Anne lets her try on manipulation. It suits her, as does the trappings of the time period: Wardrobe, accents, etc. Better than Kirsten Dunst, anyhow.

And, frankly, Johansson, who glides through her scenes with her trademark opacity. We don't find out what makes Mary tick so much we hear the wind blowing through her ears. Although Mary smartens up by the end of the picture, she always seems a little slow on the uptake, and Johansson's bewildered, open-mouthed persona transforms virtue into the addled gaze of a milquetoast. It worked five years ago in ""Girl With A Pearl Earring;"" it's growing a little old now.",1204502400,,3779,4.825347758887172
3170779,3,B0017APPSE,"THE OTHER BOLEYN GIRL suffers from overexposure to the passion for all things Tudor that has produced multiple novels, television series, and films that range from great to mediocre. Having not read Philippa Gregory's best selling novel, this viewer entered the theater without preconceived notions of the path the story would take/stray in the wake of heightened interest in historical data. From the opening scenes to the end the impression is one of having viewed some very beautiful scenery, sumptuous costumes, grand lighting - and very little involvement in caring for the plight of the characters.  The soggy music score underlines the unrelenting dark atmosphere of the story and the production, and despite a cast of actors known for credibility in historic roles, there is little compassion stirred.

King Henry VIII (Eric Bana, in relatively little screen time) tires of Katherine of Aragon (Ana Torent) and her inability to bear a male heir. The Boleyn clan (Mark Rylance and Kristin Scott Thomas in collusion with the Duke of Norfolk David Morrissey) seize on Henry's frustration and serve up their daughters Anne (Natalie Portman) and Mary (Scarlett Johansson) to satisfy his dalliances.  The younger Mary beds him first, does produce a son, but falls out of favor leaving Anne to work her newly honed skills of feminism learned during her exile in France on the easily seduced King to become his queen, yet is able to only bear him a daughter, Elizabeth. The results are tension in the castle, in the Boleyn family, and between the sisters Anne and Mary. History is molded by the writer to maintain more of a Hollywood soap opera that a recreation of fact and it all ends with beheadings and the child Elizabeth running gaily through sunny old meadows of England.

The actors all try to make us buy into this version of betrayal and lust and loathing, but the dialog (written by Peter Morgan) is tired and used and anything but in keeping with the period.

3170780,4,B0017APPSE,"*Mild Spoilers*

In this gorgeously made film, we take a deep look into the Boleyn intrigue through the eyes of a young woman often overlooked in the tangle: Mary, Anne Boleyn's sister. A shadowed fact in history is that Henry XVIII made love to and fathered two children with Mary Boleyn before he moved on to Anne. This brilliantly woven tale, first an intricate novel by Philippa Gregory, reveals not only Mary's traumatic tale, but some of the deepest folds of the Boleyn family's saga.

It's well known that Mary and Anne's parents were ambitious to a fault and offered their children up for royal barter whenever King Henry smiled upon them. Mary, newly wedded, was offered before Anne and remained a pawn and an assistant to her family's schemes long after Anne and Henry married. What this amazing movie and its parent novel focus on is the Boleyn scandal, the decay of Henry's two first marriages, the deadly consequences of reckless ambition, and Mary's own desperate loyalties and love for her family: all caught and tangled in the threads of Henry's swaying favor.

The only reason I docked one star is the omission and alteration of certain important historical facts. For one thing, Mary had two children, a daughter first and a son second, with Henry. In this movie (not the book), Mary's daughter is completely omitted and her son is scarcely mentioned. Movie editing aside, the existence of Mary's children was an important fact in history and not one to be overlooked. Secondly, the movie added a ridiculous scene in which Henry promised Anne that he would never sleep with his wife or speak to her sister again if she only promised to consider accepting him (right in the middle of Mary's child labor!) This is flat-out ridiculous: no king with an ounce of pride would make such a promise, much less Henry XVIII! The result of his words was equally ridiculous: Anne accepted his promise, and when the midwife called to him that he had a son, he simply looked over at Mary and walked away without a second glance! Please; the one thing that Henry never did was turn his back on a son and his desire for one proved, over and over, to trump his lust for a woman.

Lastly, and most offensively, there was a disgusting scene in which Henry raped Anne from behind in a rage, before they were even married. This is flat-out preposterous Hollywood soap opera: from all historical accounts, Henry was nothing but desperate for Anne before their marriage and it was not until after Elizabeth's birth that he began to lose patience and show anger towards her. The idea that he would rape her, especially before their marriage, is nonsensical in every extreme.

Luckily, the second half of the film made up for any earlier faults. The two main actresses, Johansen and Portman, were simply phenomenal: Johansen perfectly captures Mary's gentler but strong spirit, while Portman really came into her own showing Anne's increasing despair and desperation for her life. The scenes with Mary's quiet fire and Anne's pacing around the room, black hair swinging like a silk cape in her frantic energy, are unforgettable and trademarks of amazing acting. What truly won the movie in my eyes was the heartbreaking and eye-opening truth that the film and the book both revealed: the ultimate and utter tragedy of placing ambition before love, greed before caution, and reward before family. I couldn't be happier that I watched this stunningly beautiful film and, inspite of certain omissions, I think it deserves a place of honor right up there with the book. I recommend this film to everyone; you'll never forget the tragedy of the Boleyn family and what they reveal of humankind.",1204329600,,3680,4.8256735340729
3170781,3,B0017APPSE,"As a standalone movie, ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" is okay....not great, but okay. However, as someone who is a die-hard fan of Philippa Gregory's novel, I wasn't at all impressed with this film adaptation.

The problem with this movie is that the script sucks, pure and simple. Obviously, the basic plot is the same as the book: The young Mary Boleyn (Scarlett Johansson) is commissioned by her ambitious family to cast her husband aside and become the mistress of King Henry VIII (Eric Bana) while her older sister, Anne (Natalie Portman), jealously looks on. Eventually Henry's eyes drift over to Anne, who replaces Mary as the favorite and embarks on a dangerous plan to replace Queen Katherine (Ana Torrent) on the throne of England.

Unfortunately, this movie doesn't capture the energy and passion of Gregory's brilliant novel. The pacing is tediously slow, and so many details of the plot were changed for the film, for no apparent reason at all. The Boleyn girls grow up at court, so the way Mary and Henry initially meet was rewritten in the film. Mary had two children by Henry, but only the boy is shown in the movie. Lady Boleyn (Kristin Scott Thomas) was reinvented for the screen and is portrayed as a woman who actually gives a crap about her children, but in the book she supports the use of her daughters as pawns in the family's quest for power. I didn't understand what happened to Mary's first husband in the movie...he just sort of wanders off-screen 15 minutes into the film and is never seen or heard from again. (In the book, he dies from the sweat, which is why Mary is later free to marry William Stafford.) What else? I was disappointed in the way the incest issue was handled in the film. I guess the producers assumed that it was too taboo of a topic for the movie, because they totally changed the way it was handled. Oh yes, and King Henry never raped Anne Boleyn in the novel, and he certainly didn't tire of her before he married her! That was so ridiculous.

There are many more discrepancies between the book and the film that I don't even have time to list, and they completely ruined what could have been an excellent film. Another thing that bothered me is the way the pacing constantly shifted. At times things moved very slowly, but then the plot jolted forward at lightning speed, especially toward the end of the film. Major historical events were glossed over and only mentioned in a sentence or two of dialogue, such as Katherine's banishment and the establishment of the Church of England. If you blink while watching this movie, you'll definitely miss something important.

This movie had all the makings of a hit. Visually, it's absolutely stunning. I especially loved all the brilliant costumes. Also, the performances by the actors were phenomenal. I was particularly enchanted by Portman's portrayal of Anne, which was completely on the mark. However, all of the actors were limited by a terrible script. It's such a shame.

I am so incredibly bummed about how crappy this film turned out to be. Do yourself a favor and read the book BEFORE you see the movie so you know what you're missing (that is, if you even want to bother with the movie at all).",1204329600,,3198,4.673179396092363
3170782,3,B0017APPSE,"After reading Philippa Gregory's novel ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" and finding it a head and neck above the normal bodice ripping fare, I awaited the film of the same name, directed by Justin Chadwick with anticipation, expecting the same interplay of jealousy, connivance and sympathy between the two main characters as depicted in the book.  Instead Peter Morgan's screenplay cuts to the chase rather literally, boiling down the relationship between Anne Boleyn and her sister Mary to simply that motivated by a touch of the old green monster.

The book begins in London where lady-in-waiting to Queen Catherine of Aragon, Mary unwittingly and unintentionally catches the king's roving eye to the delight of her scheming upwardly mobile family.  Anne, a recent returnee to Tudor-ville via the French court acts as staunch backer and campaign strategist to help her sister maintain her rise in status.  Brother George simply adores his two siblings and moves heaven and earth to help his family accomplish their objective in this velvet-and-ermine-clad sexually permissive jungle that vaguely suggests a more somberly Desperate Housewives at their hair-pulling best. The trio works together as a mini-coven, understanding their fate and trying their best to elevate the Boleyn standing in the British realm at the expense of their own personal happiness through any means.  Even though a basic knowledge of history spoils the ending of this tale, Gregory does her best to keep the bombardment of all these plots and machinations at an understandable yet intriguing pace.

Not so with the film, although the overall motivation and maneuvering of the film Team Boleyn is no different.  After the opening shots of the trio as children romping in an amber-hued countryside, the audience is rather quickly propelled forward to the task at hand--Queen Catherine of Aragon, Henry's wife has failed to give him the male heir he so frantically desires--the Boleyn solution?  Showcase one of the saucy sisters to solace the king in his yearning with a little adultery and thereby procure a Boleyn-Tudor son.  Simple.  Raise the family stakes up an earldom or two to secure the families future for all generations. Cut to a boardroom-type scene where the Boleyns wait at their family estate for the arrival of the king like an over-starved bunch of crocodiles awaiting a barge of tasty morsels gone aground. Uncle Howard, played to slimeball perfection by David Morrissey and dear old dad Thomas--Mark Rylance imbues this character with anxious looks and an almost prescient wretchedness--push first daughter Boleyn forward even though mother Boleyn, the ever sophisticated Kirsten Scott Thomas cries out like a pre-feminist Greek chorus that no good will come from using her children like chattel. Enter wily brunette teaser Natalie Portman slithering provocatively with dark eyes all a-sparkle in sideways looks like a brilliant green snake in a bejeweled stomacher--her plan to wow the king with her expert horsemanship backfiring when she one ups Henry's lesser equestrian ability.  On his royal back, he is nursed by Mary of the pout-y lips (Scarlett Johansson), the pinch hitter whose golden beauty, Rubinesque form and utter submissiveness seem far more appealing (and easier to conquer) than sister Anne of the thousand tongue-in-cheek flirtations.

As in the novel, Eric Bana's positively vainglorious Henry enthralls the love-starved Mary. But even after the procurement of the desired male heir, sister Anne's agenda sheet still bears a golden crown above her entwined initials--why settle for illegitimate when a fully legitimized heir could concrete the Boleyn legacy in the annals of history for all time?

And so the story moves forward at a rate that rivals the speed of light, urged on by a rousing soundtrack written by Paul Cantelon.  The five years that it takes Anne to achieve her endgame literally take place in a few moments.  The characters of Thomas Moore and Cardinal Wolsey might as well be non-existent.  The role of brother George, although `touched' upon is not given the extensive treatment Gregory bestows him in her novel.  But most of all the characters of Anne and Mary wallow in stereotype.  Anne epitomizes dark ambition--Portman's performance depicts a witch of a girl-woman bedazzled by court life yet angered and frustrated by her own failure.  Ultimately she realizes her plight, stumbling as she goes, over her own bravado and cunning.  As her foil, Mary shimmers in a soft light that showcases her Renaissance beauty--I can never fail to think of Scarlett Johansson as the model for Vermeer's `Girl With a Pearl Earring""--as the alternate other Boleyn girl, she symbolizes the milkmaid's existence--the simpler lifestyle fueled by the sun and outdoors that ebbs with the absence of light and abstract absolutes.  For her, love takes precedence over wealth and prestige.  Without the clever nuances of the novel, the film brands the two sisters as two-dimensional symbols of good and evil.  They stand apart as rivals rather than Boleyns working towards the same goal who ultimately love each other and their family more than they do anything else.  The insistence of the film to tell this tale at a quantum leap diminishes the multi-faceted qualities of its main protagonists.

Not being knowledgeable regarding the actual ages of the historical figures, from my vantage point--and this I am afraid is definitely a sign of age--I felt the characters to be so overly and fragilely young.  William Stafford, Mary's love interest, may well need Clearasil--I could well imagine him in a junior varsity basketball uniform--all arms and legs--than in the velvet garb of Uncle Howard's page.  Likewise for Portman who, although resplendent in her verdant green gowns that show off her creamy skin and her downy profile, neck and d&eacute;collet&eacute; to perfection, still appears sometimes frail and childish.  I can more easily imagine her stamping her feet like a willful brat than seducing and satisfying the likes of Eric Bana. Case in point--the beheading scene.  Portland reminds me of a high school Portia spouting off about the `quality of mercy' rather than a grown woman who had used her wiles to entertain and bamboozle the king of England.  In a more mature sense, Johansson appears way too many times striding or riding purposefully in and out of the castle.  Like an overprotective St. Bernard, her persona as nurturer and semi-saint seems overdone.

Bottom line?  The 2008 film, ""The Other Boleyn Girl,"" concentrates on one aspect of the Gregory mega bestseller.  Pitting one Boleyn girl against the other, it succeeds in depicting a Tudor England of great intrigue--engineered by scheming families who did not play it safe and were literally willing to put their necks on the line.  The frenetic pace of the film offers only enough time to create outline caricatures of each of the main personalities rather than nuanced flesh and blood women who skewed the hypocritical rules professed by their faith to snare future family glory.  Natalie Portman as Anne Boleyn gives an interesting performance as the doomed pseudo queen that needs more taming than a shrew by any other name. Is there any wonder as to why women carry with them the reputation of being manipulative and deceitful after viewing such degradation? The scene where Anne gives birth to Elizabeth especially seethes with poignancy; the sense of uselessness blatantly apparent--how dare you birth a female and not a male?  What a sad history we women share--enough to keep all the psychiatrists in the world busy until the next millennium with the theme of little self-esteem and worthlessness alone.  Gold diggers?  I guess one had little choice.  Voyeur that I am, I wish the five years Anne kept Henry at bay portrayed in the novel in much detail was given due diligence here.  Recommended to those who enjoy yet another telling of this Tudor soap opera with nary a qualm with regard to historical authenticity.

3170783,4,B0017APPSE,"King Henry VIII's (Eric Bana) growing tired of first wife, the Spanish Katherine of Aragon (Ana Torrent) since she cannot bear him a son. The Duke of Norfolk (Morrissey) and Sir Thomas Boleyn (Rylance) offer young Anne Boleyn (Portman) a 'commission'.  If she becomes the King's mistress, she will both advance the family's interests and secure a ducal marriage for herself.

Anne's mother objects with the review's tagline and more, but Anne's intrigued.  Unfortunately, the men's advice on a hunt to 'ride strong' gets the King injured and ill-disposed to Anne, who showed herself a better rider than he.  When just-wed Mary (Scarlett Johansson) is sent to tend the King, he fancies her instead and sends for her to court.

Soon, Mary's husband is disposed of, and King and younger Boleyn girl are having a torrid affair.  When Mary lies in with Henry's child, the balance switches.  Anne is brought in ""only to keep the King's interest on Mary.""

The following film details Henry's subsequent 'beguilement' by the older Boleyn sister, and Anne's rise and fall.  While the historical accuracy isn't there, it's an interesting tale.

Eric Bana would not have been my choice for Young Henry Tudor.  While he's handsome enough, he doesn't look the part.  Scarlett Johansson was the performer who I thought luminous in this tale of court intrigue.

I suspect this film will get the nod at the 2008 Oscars for Costuming. The garb was gorgeous and beautifully detailed. The film's a treat just for Ren Faire junkies just to see what everyone's wearing.

""The Other Boleyn Girl"" is based on the historical fiction of the same title by Philippa Gregory.",1204329600,,1647,4.941818181818181
3170784,3,B0017APPSE,"""The Other Boleyn Girl"" opens ominously, develops into a dark tale of nasty sibling rivalry, and ends with virtually every character crying bitter tears. I was essentially watching a medieval soap opera, one that lulled me into that gray area between fascination and repulsion. Yes, this movie has that effect, and that makes me wonder if it really achieved what it wanted to achieve. Was it supposed to be a nonstop gloom fest, or were the filmmakers actually trying to say something important? I honestly don't know. I'm well aware that this is a representation of historical events, and as such, I know that the circumstances leading to Anne Boleyn's death were not pleasant. So that begs the question of why this movie had to be made in the first place; if nothing even remotely upbeat could be made up for the sake of the screenplay, maybe it would have been better to just leave the idea alone.

That being said, I did find a lot of the film compelling, especially in terms of the relationship between the Boleyn siblings. Initially, Anne, Mary, and George (Natalie Portman, Scarlett Johansson, and Jim Sturgess) are close-knit, more like best friends than relatives. But things quickly change, especially for Mary and Anne. Around the same time Mary weds William Carey (Benedict Cumberbatch), we learn that the Queen of England--Katherine of Aragon (Ana Torrent)--has given birth to a stillborn child, and worse yet, that child was a boy. This is unacceptable to King Henry VIII (Eric Bana), who only wants a male heir to the throne. The Duke of Norfolk (David Morrissey) sees this as a perfect opportunity for the Boleyn family, especially for his niece, Anne: she can be the first to offer herself as the King's mistress, and with a little luck this will lead to the birth of a son.

With a little coaxing, Anne accepts the offer. The King arrives at the Boleyn estate within no time at all, and at first, it does seem as if he's taken a liking to Anne. Consider the moment before an afternoon of hunting, in which Anne announces she'll be riding her own horse: ""Without a man,"" asks the King, ""how will you hold onto your horse?"" ""The same way you do, my Lord,"" she answers coyly. ""With my thighs."" But when an accident injures the King on the hunt, he's introduced to Mary, who tends to his wounds with care. He finds her fascinating, so much so that he wishes her to come to his castle and become the Queen's Lady in Waiting. He also appoints her husband to be a Gentleman of the Privy Council. Thus the seeds of jealously are planted within Anne, who believes her sister purposely stole the King away from her.

The jealously becomes full-fledged resentment when Mary exposes Anne's secret marriage to Henry Percy (Oliver Coleman). Mary insists that she did it for Anne's own good, since Henry was already betrothed to another woman. But Anne hardly feels grateful, especially since she's now been exiled to France. Not long after, Mary discovers that she's pregnant with the King's child; when she's confined to bed rest after a near miscarriage, Anne is brought back with the hope that she'll be able to ""amuse"" the King and to keep his thoughts on Mary. This, of course, doesn't happen. If anything, her resolve to win the King's affections has greatly increased. By the time Mary gives birth, Anne convinces the King that his newborn son is nothing more than a bastard child, and therefore unsuitable to be the heir to the throne.

As you can see, ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" paints a very unflattering picture of Anne Boleyn. Whether or not this is historically accurate, I have no idea. What I do know is that, as far as a film is concerned, there's only so much backstabbing and betrayal I can handle in one sitting. The birth of Mary's son kick starts a series of even more deplorable acts on Anne's part. She seduces the King with every glance. She refuses to sleep with him until she's Queen, and in order for that to happen, she has Katherine humiliated into annulling her marriage. Anne also persuades the King to cut off any political and religious ties with Rome and the Catholic Church, essentially tearing England apart. And all because she's mad at her sister for being noticed by the King.

The last thirty minutes are too dark and depressing to describe. I will say that, by the time Anne realizes the harm she's caused, every character is lost in despair and things just keep going from bad to worse. It doesn't matter whether or not this happened in real life--my comments are solely focused on what I saw in the film, and I'm really not sure that I wanted to see any of it. Was it really necessary for this film to be so dreary, even if the subject matter was anything but cheerful? It really seemed as if the filmmakers were purposely milking the melodrama, forcing the audience into an almost constant state of apprehension. It wasn't at all a pleasant feeling. Still, I did find some of the material was convincing, if only just; the connection between the Boleyn siblings is fascinating, even when times are darkest for them. One gets the sense that even in midst of deceit and emotional turmoil, they will always love each other, no matter what. This is probably the only thing stopping me from giving ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" an even lower star rating--everything else about it is just too overwrought.",1204243200,,5338,4.674468085106383
3170785,2,B0017APPSE,"Despicable people doing contemptible things have never equaled solid entertainment. The Other Boleyn Girl is not without its highlights - those being negligible and spread out amongst poorly-paced, drawn-out bits of heavily censored romance. Natalie Portman delivers a worthwhile performance as the ill-fated Anne Boleyn, but the rest of the too-beautiful cast doesn't ever seem to authentically fit in to their lavish period piece costumes. Undoubtedly after viewing The Other Boleyn Girl, the audience will probably only want to research what truly happened.

When the Queen of England, Katherine of Eragon (Ana Torrent) is unable to produce a male heir for impatient King Henry Tudor (Eric Bana), he becomes besotted by Anne Boleyn (Natalie Portman), who is intentionally placed before him to allow her weak father Thomas and her conniving uncle, the Duke of Norfolk, to remain in good favor with royalty.

During the King's visit, Anne's competitive personality finds Henry becoming injured, and being taken care of by her sister, Mary Boleyn (Scarlett Johansson). The greedy King soon falls for the dewy-eyed sister, and she is whisked back to the court for his pleasure. Not long after, Mary is pregnant, and Anne Boleyn secretly gets married to nobleman Henry Percy. Anne is banished when the Duke of Norfolk discovers her spontaneous and unplanned marriage, but within a mere two months is brought back to keep the King occupied while Mary is bedridden.

Anne soon finds herself infatuated with potential power and control over the King, and manages to have Mary sent back to the countryside and Katherine of Aragon banished for false infidelities. Henry eventually breaks away from the Catholic Church when he arranges an annulment with his wife and marries Anne. Despite her promises, she is unable to produce a male heir for Henry, and he begins to regret his decisions over Katherine and his country, which leads to...well, the rest as they say, is history.

The Other Boleyn Girl is not entirely a history lesson, but it certainly is about as much fun. Which is to say that the beginning plods along with ruthless details on trivial things, and the love triangle that forms is predictable and blas. Perhaps the most unappealing factor with this film is its dislikeable characters. Mary is initially at fault for dispensing misery to her sister, causing her to be banished; after this, she never really feels like a leading force of good, but is sadly the only character the film steers the audience into rooting for. After Anne becomes jealous of her sister's success with the King, she is immediately an antagonist, wheeling and dealing to increase her power and remove her competition. The King himself is portrayed as an uncontrollably lustful and self-absorbed despot who thinks of himself before his kingdom, and presiding over all of these miserly characters is the Duke of Norfolk, who pulls the strings of his brother Thomas and plays with the lives and romances of Anne and Mary.

With the leads dressed in luxuriant costumes (Portman looks like Queen Amidala from Star Wars) and being traded like cattle, The Other Boleyn Girl goes to great lengths to show off beautiful people frolicking about in medieval fetes. Outside of Portman, who does a sensational job in a poorly penned role, the remaining cast feels horribly misplaced, like wolves in sheep's clothing. By the conclusion, which perhaps unintentionally perfectly sets up for the film Elizabeth, all we really want to do is read about actual facts, and clear our minds of this heavily flourished film.

It seems to be made for those who like history and love a racy tale, but don't want to see any nudity and don't mind a screenplay that doesn't know where it's going and is in no hurry to get there. Cursed with a story that too often sinks into being just another generic melodrama, the movie has Natalie Portman and Scarlett Johansson all dressed up with no place, at least on screen, to get naked. Worse, it's not even good eye candy. Though the costumes are lavish (especially on Portman), the film displays them, as well as everything else, in a color palette that's as drab as its story.

The book also certainly didn't pretend that women were anything more than what they were back then -- unimportant and often humiliated, used as pawns by the men of the family. In the movie, however, Anne and Mary's mother makes more than one speech with a modern, feminist take.

The affair quickly dissolved into a rivalry between the sisters, Mary (1499-1543) and Anne Boleyn (1501-1536). Mary became the kings concubine for a short period and bore Henry one or two children whom he never acknowledged. Anne seduced the king by repeatedly refusing to have sex with him until he gave up his relationship with Mary, rid himself of his current wife, married her, and made her queen. She served as queen of England from 1533 to 1536 and bore Henry a daughter Elizabeth. Henry became dissatisfied with her because, among other reason, she bore him no son. He accepted as true a rumor that she had sex with her brother and beheaded her and her brother. This created a political and religious upheaval that started the English Reformation. Henry never had a son despite attempts with other women, and Elizabeth became Queen of England.",1511654400,,1191,4.622641509433962

3404165,3,B0017APPSE,"This 2008 offering, based on a book by Phillipa Gregory, depicts the lesser-known aspects of the tragic saga of King Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn, played here respectively by a relatively staid Eric Bana and a sparkly, and appropriately vivacious Natalie Portman.
  The film, directed by Justin Chaddock, is, as many have noted, rafe with inaccuracies. But it begins with a view  of the early lives of the three surviving (two died in childhood) Boleyn children, Anne, George, and Mary(Daisy Doidge-Hill,Finton Reilly, and Kizzy Fassett), romping in a field. Anne, the most agressive of the trio, comes out on top in the game they were playing, winning the praise of their father, Sir Thomas Boleyn(Mark Rylance), and episode that precludes the main events of the childrens' lives in certain ways.
  Several years later, we see the now-grown children on Mary's wedding day to William Carey(Benedict Cumberbatch).
  In viewing this film, as well as another  period piece featuring Scarlett Johansson--""Girl With a Pearl Earring"", I've often felt that  another blonde actress--namely Kate Hudson, with her squarer jawline, bore a stronger resemblance to both Mary Boleyn and Vermeer's muse( and Hudson had been slated to play at least one of them).But in view of the speculativeness and/or inaccuracies of either film, Johansson aptly acquitts herself.
 In actuality, the Boleyn sisters' dubious careers as royal courteseans began during their father's years in France--at least Mary's, during her time of service in the court of Queen Claude. Mary's first conquest was the French King Francois, but she had been sent home because of the Queen's resentment of the situation.
 Here, the Boleyns encounter Henry when he is injured during a hunting accident on their estate, which Anne unintentionally caused. Henry desires a liason with the married noblewoman, Mary as she nurses him. They both become ladies-in-waiting to Queen Catherine(Ana Torrent).
 Elizabeth Howard ( played by Kristin Scott-Thomas with the  reputedly blonde good looks of the Howard family), expresses her disapproval as the sexual and political intrigues involving her children begin, and then escalate, but is sadly ignored. Under the scheming machinations of her Uncle, the Duke of Norfolk(David Morrissey), Mary becomes King Henry's mistress, and bears him a son.
 We deal with the inaccuaracy of Anne marrying her sweetheart Henry Percy(OliverColeman), when, in fact, she was only betrothed to him. Confiding the news of her marriage to her brother, George(Jim Sturgess), George tells Mary, who reports this to her father and uncle due to fear that Anne's marrying a prominent nobleman without the King's permission will  compromise the family. Anne has her marriage annuled and is exiled to France.
 Mary's pregnancy by the King leads to the increased wealth of her family at the King's pleasure. We observe the ritual of her confinement when the pregnancy becomes a high risk one.
 Norfok has his other niece returned home to help keep the King's attention from wandering to other mistresses, but ultimately this backfires, and as  Mary gives birth to her son, Henry, the King's attention turns to Anne, and they two begin to plot to dislodge Queen Katherine, who can no longer give the King a son.
 Mary, who is widowed by this point is sent to the country to live with her child. Eventually, she will marry the kindly William Stafford(Eddie Redmayne), who offers her security and a peaceful life away from court intrigues.
 Amid the annoying array of inaccuacies is the scene of The King raping Anne after  he has broken with Rome, declared himself the Head of the Church of England, and exiled Catherine after she still refuses to consumate their relationship.
 Anne and Henry marry, and  Anne is coronated, and the latter gives birth to a daughter, Elizabeth, much to Henry's dismay. A second child -- a boy--- is stillborn--leading the desperate queen to consider incest with George(which history relates was a fabrication) in the hope of the pretense of maintaining the pregancy, and hiding the miscarriage from the King for fear of being burned.
 But George's long neglected wife, Jane(Juno Temple), reports her suspicions, setting the events leading to the downfall of both George and Anne.
 As Mary's marriage to William Stafford earned her the ire of her family, as she did it with out permission, it is unlikely that she was present during her sister's miscarriage, or during Anne's final moments, or that she had any hand in rearing her niece, Elizabeth. But the emphasis is on the fact that ultimately, the lesser-acknowledged Boleyn sister led the happiest and most stress-free life of any of the Boleyn siblings, outliving all members of her immediate family.
 What this tale lacks in accuracy, it makes up for in being a cautionary tale about the tragically high price of glory.",1508889600,,4868,5.138149556400507

3404208,2,B0017APPSE,"Do you love history? Ever feel like you want to bang your head against the wall repeatedly? Then this is the movie for you!!! I know this is based on a book and maybe this was how Philippa Gregory thought history happened but she could have easily picked up any history book from this time period to find out what actually happened based on many different scholars. While we don't really know the interpersonal relationship between the two sisters, most historians agree Mary Boleyn was the elder sister. Based on Natalie Portman's character I have to assume Philippa really hated Anne Boleyn and wrote her book around that premise and Hollywood agreed it would make a great movie. Which I respectfully disagree, the pacing was fast and as far as characterization what I got from the movie was this; Mary was a sweetheart, King Henry hated Anne, Anne was a bit of a sociopath and a witch that starts with a B and apparently rape was thrown in there for some reason. I however do have one good thing to say about this movie....at least the dresses had Tudor bell sleeves! That's why I gave it two stars instead of one. If you like this movie great but it definitely isn't for me or anyone that loves this period and historical accuracy.

Editing: To say I was looking through the other reviews and apparently it's based off a historical fiction book so I can give it some leeway, however I still feel the pacing was off, everything happened so quickly and unless you know history this movie would be very confusing.",1496880000,,1514,4.586715867158672

This particular version has some new twists which involve, as the title indicates, the other Boleyn girl, Mary... sister of Ann, who consented to being Henry's mistress prior to his meeting with, courtship of and marriage to Ann. In this movie, we again follow the emotional roller-coaster as allegedly refined members of royal and aristocratic birth manipulate one another to each individual's own selfish and deadly ends. What elevates ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" above other recent recountings is the phenomenal talent of Natalie Portman as the ill-fated Ann Boleyn. Commendable performances are also given by Eric Bana as Henry VIII and Scarlett Johansson as Mary Boleyn. Even though we know from the beginning Ann's eventual fate, Portman recreates that horrible moment with such depth of feeling it brought tears to this old man's eyes.

The only redeeming qualities in this movie are the absolutely amazing costumes, occasional witty lines, and a story that is a kind of dark fairy tale-- good girls stay alive, man-stealing witches end up in trouble etc. The story reminds me of some of the horrible sources Shakespeare used to create some of his greatest works of literature--- the best we can hope for is someday a talented mind will use the potential in this plot and edit out the trash that overwhelms it in its current state.
Watch Natalie and Scarlett in the Marvel movies and don't waste your time with this soap opera.",1470787200,,815,4.476510067114094

3404570,4,B0017APPSE,"Actually, I picked up this movie by mistake but was pleasantly pleased once I begin to take a closer look at the story. I have always wondered how  Queen Elizabeth came into position in a male-dominated world especially in the English culture.

This movie had a lot of twists and turns incorporating several inappropriate sexual encounters including betrayal, jealousy, and corruption.  Mary (played by Scarlett Johansson) is the younger sister of Anne (played by Natalie Portman) that experiences a life of normalcy considering during that time.  Young girls were positioned to marry or commit adultery in order to improve their family's wealth and lifestyle.  Mary is chosen to commit adultery with Henry VIII to improve her family's wealth.

Anne, on the other hand,  is jealous of this decision and sees the love that Henry VIII feels for her younger sister, Mary, so she wants it for herself.  Anne would stop at nothing to be on a quest to trump her sister.  Anne begins to weave a life of treason and malice just to get in the position as queen along the side of Henry VIII.  Anne believes that as queen she will be able to receive the revenge, love, respect, and honor that she is desiring.  The irony is that there is already a queen alongside Henry VIII but this doesn't stop her.  Anne sets out on a quest to destroy her sister, Mary; Henry VIII's wife, the queen and anyone in her path to be in this position as queen.

During Mary's relationship with Henry VIII, a male child is born, this child is set as an heir to the king.  Anne wants to supersede her sister by giving birth to a male child.  For Anne nothing goes right, karma can be a _________, she does give birth but not to a son, but a daughter.  Anne does not want to be a parent to the child and eventually she has no choice but little does she or Henry VIII knows is that this child, a daughter will be the reign of the king, known as Queen Elizabeth.",1454630400,,1927,4.478510028653295

3404804,5,B0017APPSE,"I think the real star of this version of the most popular and intricately detailed saga of the embattled triumvirate of King Henry VIII, Catherine of Aragon and Anne Bolelyn is the director Justin Chadwick. He navigates the difficulties of a script that depicts a uniquely different perspective of the this infamously provocative story with the skill of a master craftsman.

Mr. Chadwick displays insightful and finely honed skills that distinguish him as a director approaching the celebrity of his predecessor, William Wyler with whom he shares an impressive intuitive understanding of how to use the talents of the various actors to best advantage.
He's got the ""eye"", a phrase often attributed to gifted individuals distinguished by their laudable artistic accomplishments.

The film is concise and devoid of unnecessarily frivolities and ponderous dialogue that beleaguer too many retellings of what is perhaps the most interesting aspect of Henry's quest for a male heir.

Mr. Bana spares us the bellowing histrionic tirades and effectively communicates the full spectrum of the king's emotions with a quiet inner strength that is most effectively and impressively conveyed through his facial expressions and subtle manner of speech; although the inference of subtlety in no way suggests that the meaning of the King's directives and intent are any less menacing or lack the vehement decisiveness that characterized the personae of Henry VIII.

Natalie Portman provides a commendably convincing performance as Anne Boleyn; depicting the important and often ignored portrayal of Anne's evolution from that of an intelligent but willful young girl; unsophisticated and ignorant in the ways of court life to a young woman, wise in the ways of guile and deceptive manipulation upon her return from the French Court.
Her scene of near maniacal desperation, suggesting that she commit an act of incest with her brother George in order to conceive a male heir, is riveting; although the heinous suggestion is refused by George; although as ill fortune would have it, witnessed by a maid servant eager to keep her head and betrays brother and sister.

Scarlett Johansson is almost portrayed as being ""too good to be true""; a hapless pawn of her ambitious family; who receives gentle connubial attentions from King Henry and bears him an illegitimate son. Ms. Johansson, through her own considerable acting talents is able to rescue this character through her decisively strident protestations of unwillingness to take part in Court life and abandon her marital loyalties to her husband who served in the king's royal privy chamber.
This is a particularly difficult role and script because it is fraught with so many suggestions that are devoid of conclusively verifiable facts and rife with assumptions and convenient contrivances for the sake of the film.
The precise details of Mary Boleyn's life are sketchy at best, thus serving as a convenient vehicle for examining the Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn story from a refreshingly new and provocative perspective.

The production values are mercifully restrained although not without some degree of embellishment, but just enough to convey the privilege and status of the various participants of the illustrious court.",1431561600,,3263,5.313953488372093

Natalie Portman is suitably repellent as Anne Boleyn, and you don't much regret the bad end she comes to. Scarlett Johanssen is sublimely gorgeous (and some of her costumes are stunning), but cast in a pretty passive role here. In general, an awful lot goes unexplained (for a country and time so obsessed with the issue of divorce for the king, other people seem able to get married and unmarried at the merest whim).

3404820,2,B0017APPSE,"Though beautifully filmed, this narrative fails as plausible.

Loosely based on the tensions from Henry's first wife, Katherine of Aragon, unable to leave him a male heir, it bears little resemblance to the true events in the court of Henry Vlll relating to his relationship to Anne Boleyn and her sister, Anne's trial, her imprisonment, and other matters of state during this period. Examples of playing fast and loose with the actual historical facts are too numerous to mention......(BUT... both Anne and Mary spent their most of their young lives in the courts of France before meeting Henry, Anne never married Percy, she spent 13 years in the Tower not the mere months shown here.  Etc. etc.).

Artistic license could be excused if the essence of the tale were comprehensible. But the viewer is clearly asked to resent Anne's conniving ways for 90% of the piece and then sympathize with her as she faces a charge for an act of incest that she orchestrated but was not consummated only from her brother's resistance. Brave speeches and pseudo-meaningful moments between sisters with no justification for them since one, Anne, has done nothing but act self-servingly against the other, Mary, for the entirety of the film. Somehow shown as a victim at the end, Anne has done nothing but manipulate her way for her own benefit through the entire seamy story. Typically, all of the characters are one dimensional caricatures.

Has the look of a great period piece but little of the substance to make it so. Fancy costumes, good lighting, and numerous of scenes men and women charging anxiously down Tudor castle hallways to deliver messages does not good drama make.",1429488000,,1667,4.942857142857143

Natalie Portman is such a weak actress; I feared she wouldn't have what it took to portray Anne Bolelyn with any spice, and, sadly, I was right - she's no Anne Boleyn and she's no Natalie Dormer, either (who did a fantastic job as Anne Boleyn in The Tudors).  Scarlett Johansson did a decent job of portraying Mary, but the character development just wasn't there for her either, so despite that she was the best actress in the film, I had no feeling about her character either way. Henry VIII was cast as a minor player - an aside, really.  While you may want to make a movie featuring the sisters, you really can't cast Henry VIII aside, for without him and his madness, the sisters wouldn't have been relevant. I was attached to no one in the film and was moved by nothing that happened, not the optimal movie experience. I can highly recommend Elizabeth I (with Helen Mirren), The Tudors, and Elizabeth The Virgin Queen (with Anne-Marie Duff), but just not this.  Please, not this.",1427328000,,1170,4.610576923076923

Granted, they had to fit it into a movie somehow. I was disappointed watching it again after reading the novel though. Best part of the movie is Scarlett Johansson as Mary.

I was told what the end would based on the history of England and I feel that the actors did it justice.  It is a good movie with some comedy, romance, and suspense from time to time.  Anne, in the movie, is portrayed as a woman who slithers her way into a royal marriage.  If the real Anne did the same, I do not know.  Anne gets her crown and then faces the consequences of her actions.  It is a good movie if you like stories of historic tales.

3404909,2,B0017APPSE,"Well, ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" does have exquisite production values, and all the actors and actresses give outstanding and passionately heartfelt performances. Here's the problem: this film, like the book on which it is based, is extremely - and I do mean EXTREMELY - inaccurate. The book's author, Philippa Gregory, took huge and numerous liberties with historical facts, and unfortunately, the inaccuracies are carried over into this film.  Some might say the inaccuracies don't matter as long as the movie is well-made - but that's stupid; it really does matter, because facts are...well...you know...facts.

And why, just WHY, can they not hire an actor with red hair to portray Henry VIII?  After all, Henry really was a redhead. Is it that evil to be historically accurate?  *sigh* Well, if you're looking for nothing more than a glamorous costume movie with lots of high drama, then ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" is for you - but if you want an accurate depiction of Henry VIII and his women, look someplace else.  (I would suggest the BBC miniseries ""The Six Wives Of Henry VIII"" or even ""Anne Of The Thousand Days"", which is worth watching for the brilliant performance by Genevive Bujold in the title role as Anne Boleyn.)",1407628800,,1226,4.932038834951456

3404922,1,B0017APPSE,"Like some others here, I wonder what if some people see this mess and think this is what really happened?

I realize that rewriting history for dramatic and political effect goes back to at least Shakespeare, and I have been known to complain loudly about his Richard III, but it is hard to see any legitimate motivation for this mess of historical inaccuracy.

Only the costuming and scenery seems at all accurate. It is not even consistent with the novel upon which it is loosely based.  ( For the record Anne did wear the necklace complained of above with the large B around her neck.)

This rendition ignores Mary's daughter, also probably Henry's and thus her descendent Essex later weak claim to the throne, and also ignores several mistresses following Mary before Anne became part of the story.

While it would be nice to think that Lady Boleyn objected to using her children in this way to advance the family and then the loss of two of them, there is no evidence for this at all.

While the ambition of Anne and Mary's uncle, the Duke of Norfolk is well portrayed (later he pimps another niece, Katherine Howard, forward to Henry's bed, being queen, and then to her death by beheading as well), he was hardly the only one, and Wolsey is not even mentioned and Cromwell is only a footnote.

The film's ending does hint at the delicious irony that in his mad quest for a male heir, Henry misses that he has fathered the greatest ruler of all in Elizabeth.

The actresses are lovely, but what a waste of time.",1401062400,,1516,4.547794117647059

There is no build up, not strong emotional connections, nothing. The casting is terrible. I absolutely loved Stafford in the book but he was such a disappointment. Childish and unattractive.

3404930,3,B0017APPSE,"This version rings slightly truer than Anne of the Thousand Days of 40 years ago.  Natalie Portman is slightly more believable as Anne, and Scarlett Johannsen is an acceptable Mary.  A pleasant surprise was Benedict Cumberbatch in an all-too-brief appearance as William Carey, the husband that made it possible for Henry to consort with Mary; after all, it would have been unseemly had she been unwed, wouldn't it?  But wait--her sister was unwed!
The actor portraying Henry did a much better job than Jonathan Rhys-Meyers in the Showtime series (JRM was simply too young to make a believable Henry after about the first episode; by the time the real Henry was 40--about the time that Anne and he finally marry--his looks and both his physical and mental health began a rapid slide downward).
Like all the film renditions of this piece of Tudor history  The Other Boleyn Girl takes a great deal of license with the facts.  (for example, the film ends with the implication that Mary and her new husband raise the toddler Elizabeth with Mary's other children; the future queen spent her childhood and adolescence in various castles, looked after by just about everyone but family members).  I suspect the film was made to capitalize on the celebrity of the two leading ladies

3404968,1,B0017APPSE,"First off, I'm going to say that I am a huge Eric Bana fan (hello, Munich?!). I also have enjoyed most of Natalie Portman's films. Now that the niceties are over- this is one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. And by far the worst ""historical"" movie I've seen, ever. Period. Almost no part of this film was accurate. Henry raping Anne? Are you serious? Mary storming through the palace after Anne's death to claim the baby Elizabeth? Again, really? This film is a wayward attempt at feminism. Sure, we can pretend that Mary was a jilted lover, we can pretend that Anne was raped and then conceived her daughter. But why lie? Why portray Mary as such a heroine ( she had limited involvement with the king outside his bedchamber), and Anne as such a deviant (she being the one who kept her legs close for YEARS before they were married). Why flip this story into something it never was, and honestly far less interesting? Also, the costumes are embarrassing at best. They remind me of cheap ""Renaissance Faire"" garb that you can buy for a couple hundred bucks at your local Halloween shop. Where are all the fabulous gowns and jewels that Henry bestowed upon Anne for years before their marriage? Frankly, she looks homely for most of the film. Anyway, if you are looking for a good watch about Anne, or Henry, I recommend The Tudors (offered on Prime for FREE)- it is LUSH and SEXY. Natalie Dormer LIVES and BREATHES the essence of Anne Boleyn. Sorry Miss Portman, you were better as a Black Swan!",1375833600,,1507,4.523809523809524
3404969,3,B0017APPSE,"Too many facts fall by the wayside in this version of the Boleyn sisters and King Henry the VIII. True, Natalie Portman resembles portraits of the real Anne Boleyn but Scarlett Johansson looks too young and beautiful when compared to portraits of the real Mary Boleyn. Meanwhile, Eric Bana as Henry remains svelte and muscular looking throughout the movie. In real life, by the time the king was enmeshed with the sisters, he was already bloated, well on his way to obesity.
The tight focus on these 3 characters also leaves out pertinent facts. While the film belabors Anne's alleged incest with her brother and their resulting executions, it ignores the fact that 4 other men were also tried on charges of adultery with the queen and executed. To add to the drama, Mary is shown returning from banishment from the royal court to plead with the king to spare Anne. In reality, she never returned after her banishment.
But at least some of the palace intrigue that really existed is brought to light. The scene of Queen Catherine of Aragon, Henry's first wife, confronting ""the Boleyn whores"" is classic. Their looks of utter surprise and hurt after being called out and subsequent anger were the best of many such expressions sprinkled throughout. And the emphasis of various court officials scheming and manipulating on the sidelines as they try to steer the king's many whims in directions favorable to themselves and supposedly beneficial for England reflect the shenanigans that continue on in halls of power to this day.",1375660800,,1526,4.9186046511627906

I'm pretty flexible with my Tudor fiction (I loved The Tudors with Jonathan Rhys Meyers), this movie is beyond the pale.

As much as I love Natalie Portman in other things, she really missed the mark in this movie.  Eric Bana was a non-entity.  Scarlett Johansen was probably my favorite part, but of course you could characterize Mary Boleyn Carey Stafford in just about any way since so little is known about her.

3404988,3,B0017APPSE,"THE OTHER BOLEYN GIRL suffers from overexposure to the passion for all things Tudor that has produced multiple novels, television series, and films that range from great to mediocre. Having not read Philippa Gregory's best selling novel, this viewer watched the DVD without preconceived notions of the path the story would take/stray in the wake of heightened interest in historical data. From the opening scenes to the end the impression is one of having viewed some very beautiful scenery, sumptuous costumes, grand lighting - and very little involvement in caring for the plight of the characters. The soggy music score underlines the unrelenting dark atmosphere of the story and the production, and despite a cast of actors known for credibility in historic roles, there is little compassion stirred.

King Henry VIII (Eric Bana, in relatively little screen time) tires of Katherine of Aragon (Ana Torent) and her inability to bear a male heir. The Boleyn clan (Mark Rylance and Kristin Scott Thomas in collusion with the Duke of Norfolk (David Morrissey) seize on Henry's frustration and serve up their daughters Anne (Natalie Portman) and Mary (Scarlett Johansson) to satisfy his dalliances. The younger Mary beds him first, does produce a son, but falls out of favor leaving Anne to work her newly honed skills of feminism learned during her exile in France on the easily seduced King to become his queen, yet is able to only bear him a daughter, Elizabeth. The results are tension in the castle, in the Boleyn family, and between the sisters Anne and Mary. History is molded by the writer to maintain more of a Hollywood soap opera that a recreation of fact and it all ends with beheadings and the child Elizabeth running gaily through sunny old meadows of England.

The actors all try to make us buy into this version of betrayal and lust and loathing, but the dialog (written by Peter Morgan) is tired and used and anything but in keeping with the period. But then, the movie is a collection of scenes that are very pretty to watch... Justin Chadwick directs. Grady Harp, February 13",1361059200,,2093,4.909604519774011

3405000,1,B0017APPSE,"Where do I even start? I understand that everything in a film can't be accurate, but there are so many things wrong with this movie, I can't even begin to remember them all. Is it really necessary to just change the story like this?
In an attempt to educate those of you who are unfamiliar with Tudor history, I will try to outline the many inaccuracies of this movie.

1. Anne is in fact younger than Mary. I can only assume that their ages were reversed in the film to make Mary appear like the oppressed younger sister.

2. Mary was not an angel. She was in fact called a prostitute before she even came to Henry because of her exploits with the French king.

3. Henry was interested in Mary first, NOT Anne, as the film implies. Anne was very young at the time her sister first started her affair with Henry.

4. Henry did not ""rape"" Anne. Why on earth would he go to such great extents to respect her wishes to remain pure before marriage and not have sex with her only to ruin all of that in the end by completely disrespecting her.

5. Catherine of Aragon's representation in this film made me ill. She looks like a stuck up old bitch. I didn't feel sorry for her at all (which made me sad because she is quite a tragic figure). She was also a strong woman, and this movie makes her look woefully insecure. Don't even get me started on the mole...very distracting.

6. We can be 99.999% sure that George and Anne did not even attempt to have sex with each other. This was just part of Henry's propaganda to justify getting rid of Anne, and apparently the creators of this film have fallen for it.

7. This isn't an inaccuracy so much as an annoyance. Henry pretty much starts hating Anne right after he gets married to her. After trying for years to get her, you'd think he'd be happy with her for at least a little while.

8. Anne supposedly had five lovers (including her brother) according to Henry. All (except for George) were left out of the story. How can you blatantly leave out 4 people??! I understand the time restrictions, but honestly, if they would have spent a little less time on stupid crap (like that hunting scene where Henry gets hurt) and a little more time on stuff that ACTUALLY HAPPENED, maybe then they could have included it.

9. What is with Henry promising Mary that he'll free Anne at the end?? This is YET ANOTHER ATTEMPT to make Mary look like the good, poor, put-upon, little sister *barf*.

10. Elizabeth is supposed to be almost 3 years old at the time of her mother's death, but she still looks like a baby at the end of the film.

11. Mary actually had two children, a girl (born first), and then a boy. It is questionable whether they were even Henry's kids.

12. Oh yes...Cromwell and Wolsey...where were they??! I can't believe two such important historical figures who were instrumental in Henry's divorce were completely ignored and left out of this movie. Unbelievable. Would it really have been so hard to at least just mention them???

There were other things, but I can't remember them all right now, and I haven't watched the film in a while. This film had good potential, but the story was mutilated and the script was dreadful. I love Eric Bana and Natalie Portman, but I HATED them in this film. I am very sorry to everyone who knows nothing about the Tudors and then goes to see this film. Far too many people take it at face value and come out spewing all kinds of crap about how ""evil"" Anne was and how Henry should never have ""raped"" her. This movie should definitely be called The Other Boleyn Girl: A Story Vaguely Based on History.",1352073600,,3594,4.410876132930514

Original story aside, the movie is very well done and the costuming is beautiful. Who would have thought that I'd think Henry VIII is sexy?  Nice choice of actor for that role.  Watching it a second time, for those who haven't read the book, will allow you catch more of the subtleties (sp?) that explain the actions of the players.  They're easy to miss on the first run through because you're following the broader storyline instead.

Well worth watching (a couple times) but forget the book and just enjoy the movie for its own merits.",1351382400,,843,4.435064935064935

Benedict Cumberbatch is William Carey, husband of the beautiful Mary played by Scarlett Johansson...he actually resembles a painting of William Carey.  He is only shown in the early part of the movie.  They don't show her going back to him, and the birth of their son Henry.  Eric Bana plays Henry (who I might add never looked that good).

I know the Tudors was somewhat inaccurate - especially with the portrayal of Henry as a young viril man well into his 40s- but it was far superior to this movie. Of course, it is easier to develop characters, plots and timelines over the course of a 4 year series than in a 2 hour movie. However, the major events of the story are barely touched upon in TOBG. The timeline is wrong. It has Henry hating Anne almost on their wedding day, when actually his disappointment in her didn't occur until after Elizabeth was born. And at the end, Mary takes Elizabeth to raise. Elizabeth is portrayed as an infant when we know that she was 3 when Anne died. Plus, there is nothing I've read to indicate that Mary actually raised Elizabeth. Many other reviews have already pointed out the many other historical inaccuracies so I will not repeat.

I am so tired of filmmakers remaking films that are already great. This movie is horrible. It's incredibly boring that you can't sit through it at once. The acting is draggy and laughable. I am sorry but a lot of today's so-called hot actors don't have the range or the talent to attempt something like this. Scarlett Johnansson and Natalie Portman might do well with a modern-day romantic comedy but they do not have the chops for a film like this. It's laughable to see them step in the shoes of all the great actresses who have played these roles. I mean no disrespect to these ladies but this film was over their heads. To me I didn't see them as the parts of Mary and Anne but as replicas of the actresses who'd played them in the past. I got the sense that Natalie and Scarlett were just trying to imitate the actresses who played these roles before, not truly conveying Mary and Anne as people.

Eric Bana was the best actor in the film AND the king yet showed less than anyone.

I don't even have the interest to go into what I didn't like about this movie because it was so pitiful. If you want to see the REAL deal when it comes to the legend behind this movie check out the amazing classics that got the job done:

Anne of a Thousand Days

Mary, Queen of Scotts

And for great modern-day period films in general check out Cate Blanchett in the Elizabeth series. Now that's acting!

As for The Other Boleyn Girl, it takes more than fake accents and dressing up in old century clothes to get the job done. Obviously the filmmakers of this movie went with who was popular, not the best talent.",1337212800,,1872,4.408695652173913

3405019,4,B0017APPSE,"This is an interesting ""take"" on the famous / infamous love affair between Henry VIII and his mistress & future queen, Anne Boleyn.  The central figure in the story is her sister, Mary (portrayed by Scarlett Johansson).  While everyone is @ least vaguely aware of Henry & Anne, the same cannot be said of Henry & Mary.  And yes, Mary and the English King has their own sexual liasons.

Anne (Natalie Portman) is depicted as a very deceitful & conniving femme fatale in the present movie.  Her's is quite a controversial persona as the opinions of her have gone the full spectrum in the minds of various historians.  Or, to put it another way, there are probably as many differing views of Anne Boleyn as there are Medieval historians!

Eric Bana is a solid choice to play King Henry.  Some may say he's too debonair & buffed to play Henry VIII, but this is simply not true.  Most people know Henry as the fatso he became in his latter years, but in the early yrs of his reign he was known as being a very dashing and athletic fellow.  Bana even looks a bit like him in a few of the sequences.

***WARNING:  THIS MOVIE MAY LEAD TO SENSORY OVERLOAD IN THE SCENES IN WHICH NATALIE PORTMAN & SCARLETT JOHANSSON ARE BOTH ON THE SCREEN TOGETHER.  I had to keep a defibrillator by my couch while viewing the DVD ~ just in case.  Guess I'm getting old.

The main ""problem"" with the present film is not with the acting, directing or the point-of-view of the story that it takes.  Rather, the difficulty lies with just how big a historical chunk that it's trying to bite-off in a very limited amount of time.  As such, it glosses over an awful lot & omits even more.  What the film-makers tried to do was the theatrical equivalent of fitting a cruise ship into a 2 stall garage.

With that in mind, if you want a more ambitious & thorough rendition of what is really going on, I would HIGHLY recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Tudors-The-Complete-Series/dp/B0042RJWTC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Tudors: The Complete Series</a>.

3405020,1,B0017APPSE,"I remember three years ago when I saw this movie with my mom and we were meeting a couple of friends to see it too. I had high hopes for this movie but was sadly disappointed. It was the worst movie about Anne Boleyn, Mary Boleyn and Henry the 8th I ever saw. It wasn't even historaclly accurate. First of all Anne was the younger sister not Mary. And the acting was kind of bad too. And there was a scene where Henry the 8th raped Anne Boleyn. Really? I know Henry the 8th was a womanizer and a tyrant but COME ON!!! A rape scene people? That never happened!!! And the scene where Anne and her brother were going to commit incest that was just a rumor Henry made up so he can marry Jane Seymore. That was just hollywood trying make it better. Instead they made it even worse. The ending was really strange too. At the end Mary takes Annes little baby daughter Elizabet and raises her when in real life Elizabeth always lived in a seperate palace and only saw her father when he requested her prescence so she like her other siblings lived lonely lives. And I don't think Elizabeth was allowed to visit her mothers family. If you want a good historical movie or show that most or all of it is historically accurate watch the 2003 BBC version of The Other Boleyn Girl and watch the Tudors that was on Showtime. The Tudors and that movie are what really stick to the truth of what really happened. Don't watch this garbage! The only good part of this movie was that Eric Bana, the man who played Henry the 8th was very sexy and we got to see him take his shirt off but other wise thats it.",1319587200,,1587,4.223684210526316
3405021,3,B0017APPSE,"So I'm not a historian.  And as such I don't really notice the historical inaccuracies in this movie or in the book its based off of.  That being said, I did notice how much they changed the movie from the book, which was rather irritating.

The Boleyn family has long been favorites at court.  So when little Mary Boleyn, newly married, attracts the eye of the King, she is forced to play his mistress but falls in love while doing so.  But he is easily distracted and while she lays in childbed, her sister Anne becomes his new favorite.  But Anne isn't content to merely be a mistress, she wants to be Queen.  She'll push King Henry to the limit for his desires and plays a dangerous game while doing so.  Mary, and her brother George, are also caught up in Anne's plan as these three Boleyns seek ambition far above them.

Characters:
Natalie Portman: Anne Boleyn
Scarlett Johannson: Mary Boleyn
Eric Bana: Henry VIII
Jim Sturgess: George Boleyn

I think that most of the characters were well cast in this film.  Portman and Johannson were great as the Boleyn sisters and even did the sibling rivalry thing quite well.  I'm used to Johannson in tougher roles so to see her a bit meeker in this role as Mary was unusual for me.  But she still played it well.  Their brother George, while a big part in the book, had a smaller role in the movie, but I thought Jim Sturgess did a good job of making him the light hearted sibling.  The only character I really have a complaint about is Eric Bana as Henry.  His acting was ok, but Henry was always described as a Golden King and Prince.  Eric Bana is dark haired and not very jovial.  In other words, he wasn't King Henry VIII.

As stated before the movie only partially followed the book.  They left out quite a few important details and I don't think it did them any favors.  I do realize that the passage of time that happens in the book couldn't happen in the movie, but that also kind of ruined things for me too since the timeline was too rushed.  The actual movie was shot well and the scenery was very nice.  I was impressed by the settings of the castles and inside the castles as it seemed very authentic.  The music was ok, but nothing that really made you stand up and take notice which is just as well since this is more of a drama than any other type of movie.

I do have to make mention of a few scenes in this book because those viewers with a weaker constitution may not find them appropriate.  While no naughty bits are actually shown, there are a couple of sex scenes and a rape scene within this movie.  Consider yourself warned if you can't stand such things.

It wasn't a bad movie but it could have been much improved on.  If they make another one of Gregory's books into a movie I just may check it out.

3405023,2,B0017APPSE,"This is one of those movies that could and should have been great. After all, it has a phenomenal cast, is adapted from a best selling novel, and has lush costumes and settings. The reality, however, is that those elements are not enough to carry this film as the script and storyline is severely lacking.

For those not familiar with the book this is adapted from, The Other Boleyn Girl is actually about BOTH Boleyn Girls. It starts with Mary but eventually follows her more notorious sister, Anne, as they climb up the social ladder in Tudor England. Their king and the object of both of their affections is King Henry VIII. While history remembers Henry as having six wives, at the start of the film he is still married to his first, Catherine of Aragon, and it is the Boleyn sisters who start him on a journey that will change England forever.

One of the aspects that makes this film so painful to watch is the gross historical inaccuracies, much of which is the fault of the script. The scene where Henry and Anne finally, uh, consummate their relationship is so infuriating for someone who knows the real backstory and gives people who aren't familiar with it an untrue portrayal of this famous couple.",1316563200,,1210,4.623255813953488

The Tudors like Elizabeth both used poetic license BUT with superior writing and a stronger reference to history.  Mary Boleyn was not the quiet, virginal (I don't want to go to court) girl portrayed in this film.

Eric Bana is pure eye candy and the costumes are well done.  After that there isn't much more to recommend this film.  I did read the book and also found it to be poorly written fiction.",1316563200,,622,4.460176991150442

3405029,1,B0017APPSE,"I devoured Phillipa Gregory's ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" and was excited to then watch the movie.

I was so very disappointed.

The movie is basically only about the fact that Henry needs an heir.

It barely touches on the great measures he takes to gain one. (Forcing his current wife into exile til he can marry Anne, claiming his first marriage was invalid, his separation from Rome and the Pope, setting forth new laws to suit his own needs, the Oath of Succession (after Elizabeth is born) and the fact that Henry put to death anyone who refused (even his good friends)).
None of that was really touched on in the movie at all. The separation from Rome was merely mentioned in passing.

It hardly touched on how tortured and desparate Anne is to give Henry a son.
The bitter rivalry between Mary and Anne is hardly felt at all.
And the time just flies. Anne managed to keep Henry's eyes on just her for many years, but in this movie it seems as if just days had passed. There is no showing of time passed.

Lots of other interesting stuff was left out of the movie, making it very dull to me.
To mention a few: ****BOOK SPOILERS!*****
The fact that Mary bore Henry two children before he moved onto Anne.
The ""monster"" baby that was born to Anne after she supposedly slept with her brother to conceive a son (which she was sure Henry could not.), which then led to her downfall, trial, and then death.
Anne being so desperate, and unfeeling towards Mary, that she adopts Mary's son out from under her.
Mary finding true love with William Stafford and the drama that that relationship caused.
George's hidden homosexual love life.
How the Howards and Boleyns treated Mary and Anne as if they were nothing more than pawns, and had no cares about their wishes or feelings.
Henry moving onto Jane Seymore when Anne was so desperately trying to hold onto him and give him a son.
I could go on forever.....

Bottome line, the good stuff in the story was all removed for this movie and we were left only the most basic of details.

No feeling, no emotion, no richness, etc.
Everything was just so glossed over.

I would not recommend this movie.
Book or no book.
It's just not a very interesting/good movie.",1309996800,,2202,4.501253132832081
3405030,2,B0017APPSE,"What I liked about this movie is beautiful costumes, scenery, castles, etc. What I didn't, that many historical facts were missrepresented. Mary didn't visit her sister before her death; even though Anne was accused of incest, that was just a way for the king to marry his mistress with hopes to have a male heir. The king is shown as a guy overcome with passion for the evil calculating woman, but he had his motives for the male legite son in mind, when he anulled his marriage to marry Anne. And he married a few times after that too. Ironically, he did get his male heir, but he died too early to actually rule- even though officially he was a king for a while.
  To sum up- too much drama, too little historic truth, but lots of beauty.",1308614400,,741,4.36231884057971
3405031,5,B0017APPSE,"Not only is this a pretty decent costume drama (check out the water wing sleeves on Henry VIII's clothes in some scenes) but it's amazingly a new take on arguably one of the England's most bizarre royals.

Now I don't quite understand how the entire nation of England cannot produce actors to play English historical figures but having an Australian (Eric Bana) and two Americans (Natalie Portman and Scarlett Johanssen) in the lead roles works out fine.

The Other Boleyn Girl is about the Boleyn sisters and is an incredibly overlooked part of British history (even if a lot of the ideas on their relationship with each other and Henry may be more in the author's mind than what actually may have happened) but all the more fascinating. Who'd have thought there was anything more to mine from the Henry VIII vaults but there was in this movie.

Needless to say you get all the court intrigue, backstabbing and sex on a stick. What makes it all the more fantastic are the elaborate detailed sets, the often Vermeer-like quality to the camera shots where we peer through doors, archways and any opening where light shines through to give a somewhat voyeuristic feel to many of the secrets of the court.

It's also a look at how badly women were treated back then (pretty as chattel) and how men manipulated women for political gain. Throw in the DVD extras which are superb. They include a look at what life was like for women in the Tudor age as well, a rundown of each central character and some more nuggets in which the actors, producers, director, the author of the book the movie is based on and some noted scholars throw in their two farthings' worth.

As far as reviews here that compare it to the book, these people need to watch the extras again as even the author says it would have been impossible to film the entire book and that the movie (which she loves) adds a bunch of necessary background needed prior to the Boleyn sisters entering court.",1304726400,,1958,4.598853868194842
3405032,3,B0017APPSE,"This is considered ""historical fiction"" - a fiction based on historical facts. It mainly concerns itself with the feelings of the Bolelyn family at the time of their greatest power and their rapid fall from grace. It is a very well told tale with 2 very solid performances from Portman and Johanson as the 2 Bolelyn sisters.
I don't mind speculating on how historical characters may have felt or their motivations or desires. Where I do object is when they alter the facts to create what they feel must be better drama:
-Mary had already been the mistress of the French king when she met Henry.
-Henry had in fact had many mistresses prior to Mary. So neither Henry nor Mary were the innocents at adultery portaryed in the movie.
-Henry was also an older and heavier man at this time than the character Bana portays. He had been married almost 25 years at that time.
So while this is a worthwhile movie that does get some of the facts right, I think it loses a bit when it tries to rewrite the facts. The facts alone are great drama. 3.5 Stars.",1301961600,,1044,4.442708333333333
3405033,4,B0017APPSE,"I have been watching The Tudors and decided to take a little side trip and watch The Other Boleyn Girl (Natalie Portman, Scarlett Johansson, Eric Bana) to get a feel for more of the Boleyn story.  Well, now I am completely confused.

Though both stories are dealing within the same period and the same basic characters, the two adaptations could not be any more different.  Now I understand poetic license, but when facts are toyed with, it leaves the watcher quite befuddled.

For instance, Mary Boleyn is referred to as the older sister in The Tudors and the younger sister in The Other Boleyn Girl, so off to Google to find out.  According to The House of Tudor, Mary is the older sister.  OK, The Tudors got this one right.  The Other Boleyn Girl tell of an illegitimate child that Mary bore during her time with Henry the VIII, The Tudor's doesn't comment on this.  This time to Wiki.  Apparently, Mary bore two children, but then again who is counting.  So I will give that one to The Other Boleyn Girl.  Now the most curious part, the end of The Other Boleyn Girl shows Mary taking the young Elizabeth and leaving Court to raise the child.  Really, does anyone think that was possible?  I thought Governess cared for her, but then people do like a happily ever after ending when dealing with royalty.

The more I look into the Tudor history, the more confused I get.  I understand that movie making is supposed to be fantasy, but how hard would it be to research what is ""known"" and go from there instead of making it up as you go.

Now back to the actual movie.  Overall, it is quite a stunning spectacle.  The costuming and staging are beautiful.  The casting is reasonable, though Henry should have been shorter and rounder, but then again who would want to see that.  I have also seen in some reviews that the sex scenes in The Other Boleyn Girl shocked people.  Well, if you are offended by that, which there really was not much shown, it is a PG-13 after all; I suggest that you completely bypass The Tudors.  That one will make you blush.

Unless you know some of the prior history of the time, you would have been lost in this movie.  The timing is a bit choppy, sort of like a Cliff Notes version of a small part of the Tudor Period.  If you are not looking for a history lesson you might like this movie, but just be warned that it is an adaptation of Philippa Gregory's historical fiction novel and not necessarily a work of fact.",1301961600,,2448,4.422818791946309

This follows the Boleyn family and their ambitions to make themselves powerful in the court of England.  If that means the daughters sleeping with the King or manipulating him for their own ends, then so be it.  This shows Mary, the gentler of the sisters, as she is seduced by the King and Anne's more ruthless manipulations to get into this good books and the throne of England.  The girls Uncle is seen to be the mastermind behind all of the manipulations and the girls would have done better not to have listened to him so closely.

I found the acting pretty good throughout and Johansson, Portman and Bana all give reasonable performances.  The father was a little wooden at times, but he isn't in the film enough to upset you too much.

This is a reasonable historical drama and if you take the facts with a pinch of salt and enjoy it for what it is, then you should enjoy this just fine.  Of course if the book is as good as some others here say, and you've read that first, you may have a different view on this, but coming to this as a stand alone film, it kept me entertained well enough.

There was perhaps no personal relationship that had more far reaching affects both geographically and historically than that of Henry Tudor and Anne Boleyn.

Henry did have a son (whom he formally recognized) with a mistress, but it wasn't Mary Boleyn - it was Elizabeth ""Bessie"" Blount - another married subject like Mary.

3405042,1,B0017APPSE,"If you've read Gregory's book, you'll be disappointed in the many things that were left out of this film. If you've read a number of Tudor biographies and/or sources, as I and many of the audience with whom I saw this film had, you'll be in a major rage upon the film's conclusion.  Costuming and cinematography were very well done, but a pretty picture does not a pretty accurate movie make.

The best part of watching this film in it's entirety (twice if you're a glutton for punishment and nit-picking as I am) was the opportunity to start counting the number of historical mistakes and jumps to conclusion that were paid, undoubtably for 'dramatic purpose'. Among the most egregious:

1. Mary Boleyn did not enter her first marriage to William Carey an innocent virgin. She and Anne had both been at the French court (there goes another one. Anne was never exiled to the French Court; she went there directly from the court of Margaret of Austria. It was a position of prestige not dishonor). Mary was unfairly maligned as the Great Prostitute, but she had been the mistress of the French king. She was Anne's sexually experience, though probably naive OLDER sister.

2. Anne's betrothal to Henry Percy was NOT consummated nor did she trap him into a secret marriage.  Henry was a page in Cardinal Wolsey's household and Wolsey and Percy's father, the Duke of Northumberland opposed the union.  Henry was a member of the council that ultimately convicted Anne of treason and contemporary sources have found evidence that he bore the guilt of sending her to the block. He died in 1537 - a year after Anne's execution.

3. Speaking of Wolsey, where the hell was he?  He was Henry's Lord Chancellor AND the major figure during the trial to determine the validity of Henry's marriage to Catherine.

4. Henry was enough of a tyrant in his later years. There was no need to make him a rapist. That was just shockingly bad and unfounded.

5. Anne and George did NOT commit incest. I hated this in the book and hated it on screen.  Tudor scholars are almost entirely in accordance that the charges against Anne, Sir Henry Norris, Sir Francis Weston, Sir William Brereton, and Mark Smeaton were all fabricated with the only evidence presented in court the confession of Mark Smeaton (this gotten after torture).

5. At Anne's trial, the onlookers were stunned by the verdict.  Even Eustace Chapuys, the Spanish ambassador and fervent supporter of Catherine of Aragon believed she would be found innocent. In the film, it was a forgone conclusion that she would be found guilty.  Cromwell was the major player behind the scenes and instrumental in the determination of Anne's guilt.

6. Speaking of Cromwell, where the hell was he?  Again a MAJOR character isn't even given a cameo role. The man was Henry's Lord Great Chamberlain!

7. Anne's final words before her execution in real life contained NO admission or allusion of guilt.  They were 'Good Christian people, I am come hither to die, for according to the law, and by the law I am judged to die, and therefore I will speak nothing against it.  I am come hither to accuse no man, nor to speak anything of that, whereof I am accused and condemned to die, but I pray God save the king and send him long to reign over you, for a gentler nor a more merciful prince was there never: and to me he was ever a good, a gentle and sovereign lord.  And if any person will meddle of my cause, I require them to judge the best.  And thus I take my leave of the world and of you all, and I heartily desire you all to pray for me.  O Lord have mercy on me, to God I commend my soul.'

8. Mary Boleyn did NOT witness the execution of her sister. She had been banished from court and disowned by the Boleyns for marrying William Stafford, a common soldier who was not considered a proper consort for the sister of the Queen of England. They were very poor and Mary wrote to Cromwell on several occasions asking him to intercede on her behalf to the king.  They lived out their lives on a Boleyn estate - Rochford Hall in Essex - where she died in 1543.  After her banishment, Mary never spoke or saw Anne, George or her parents again.

9. Elizabeth was NOT at Greenwich Palace at the time of Anne's execution. Such as had been the case with her older sister Mary, once she was a few months old, she'd been given her own household in Hertfordshire (Hatfield House).  Unless Mary's horse had wings AND armor, there was no way she could have traveled from the Tower of London to Hertfordshire and taken the child away from a royal household.  She would have been arrested on site.

10.  Elizabeth was NOT raised by her aunt.  She grew up at Hatfield House, though she did spend much time at Enfield Palace (her beloved brother, Edward's home) as well as Henry's other palaces when she was called to court.

Such a waste of actors, resources and plot. The story of the Reformation and in particular the Anne Boleyn years warrants a better and more accurate on-screen interpretation. This was definitely not that.",1286841600,,5043,4.568888888888889

3405049,4,B0017APPSE,"""The Other Boleyn Girl"" is an exciting period costume drama, very loosely based on King Henry VIII's relationship with the Boleyn sisters Anne and Mary, members of an ambitious family associated with the Royal Court, and derivative of Philippa Gregory's novel of the same name.

In 16th Century England, power politics are a family blood sport, in which the goal is to get close to the King, and stay close by any means necessary. When the dashing and handsome Henry VIII (Eric Bana) pays an official visit to the Boleyns, the family schemes to draw his attention to pretty, ambitious and eligible elder daughter Anne (Natalie Portman in full vixen mode). Through an unfortunate accident, the King instead becomes interested in plainer but honest younger daughter Mary (a superbly sympathetic Scarlett Johansson). When the two daughters are invited to court, they end up in competition to replace Henry's aging, barren queen. It is a high stakes game that the brazen Anne will do anything to win, in which the fate of the entire Boleyn family is very much at hazard.

The story falls short of historical accuracy, but many viewers are likely to be caught up in a fascinating historical melodrama, filled with a solid cast in colorful costumes, lush sets and lots of authentic location shooting. Ultimately, the movie turns on the complex relationship between the two sisters, who become bitter rivals but somehow never quite stop being sisters. Natalie Portman and Scarlett Johansson as Anne and Mary are fun to watch, and the story generates plenty of suspense before its dramatic ending. ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" is highly recommended as good entertainment. The DVD includes some nice extras.",1275264000,,1693,5.042857142857143
3405050,2,B0017APPSE,"I've been a student of Tudor history, and especially the tragedy of Anne Boleyn, whose story has always fascinated me,  for about forty years.  I saw the movie after reading Ms. Gregory's book, itself a wildly speculative work of loosely based historical fiction - emphasis on fiction.  The movie is even worse, from an historical accuracy perspective.  Mary Boleyn was anything but the shrinking violet and dutiful little daughter she is portrayed to be; what little can be found of her in historical accounts indicates that she was sent home in disgrace from the French court for promiscuity.  She was married to Will Carey right after her fling with Henry, and if the child she bore was in fact the King's, he did not acknowledge it so.  Anne spent several years at the French court, not just a couple of months, and not because she was sent there as punishment; when she joined the English court, she introduced many French trends, a sharp contrast to Queen Katharine's Spanish ways.  Nor was she as young as Natalie Portman plays her; she was at least thirty when Elizabeth was born, and somewhere around 36 when she died.  Henry, as portrayed by Eric Bana, was anything but the still young, still slim, still handsome sex symbol he is shown to be, and he was red-haired, to boot.  George Boleyn was anything but the scared little boy he is made out to be; although compelled to marry Jane Parker, he was actually the life of the court, quite a womanizer and gambler, and the center of a group of courtiers who were the King's, and Anne's, friends and constant companions.  Rather than being the only man sent to the block for adultery with Anne, George was only one of five men accused and executed.  Jane Parker recanted her testimony regarding the siblings' incest, which sent her husband to his death, at her own execution in 1542.  The sisters did not take turns competing for Henry, nor did they take turns playing serving maid to each other while the other slept with the King.  Mary was, in fact, banished from court, never to return, when she secretly married William Stafford.  There is no record of her attempting to intercede with the King on Anne's behalf, and she certainly did not carry Elizabeth away with her to raise; Elizabeth at the time of her mother's death was established in her own household, with servants, nurses, and governesses, and at some remove from court, an arrangement that did not change for several years.  Norfolk, while the malignant mover and shaker behind pimping out the Boleyn and Howard girls, was not the person who destroyed Anne's relationship with Henry Percy; that was done by Cardinal Wolsey, at the King's instigation.

3405051,1,B0017APPSE,"Many times whilst watching this movie, I found myself wishing I was watching the much better 'Anne of the 1000 Days'. 'The Other Boleyn Girl' is a travesty of a movie.

Scarlett Johansen seemed to have the acting range of a cold, dead fish. Natalie Portman did better, but frankly, she was fighting a losing battle against very poor scripting. And Eric Bana...well, as an Aussie, I have of course taken the oath of allegience to always adore Eric Bana, who like Hugh Jackman is one of the nicest guys you could hope to meet. But Eric has a very strong accent, of the type that many people who hail from Melbourne's northern suburbs do, and he just can't seem to hide it, no matter what. When he tries to sound English, it just makes me cringe. I was almost expecting King Henry VIII to crack open a beer, throw another shrimp on the barbie and call Anne 'a beaut sheila'. Ugh! Sorry, Eric, you're a top bloke, but I can say with all honesty that Amy Winehouse would have made a better King of England, even with the problem of trying to get a crown on over the wig.

The film made me angry because it was so historically inaccurate. No film better deserved to have the 'This movie is a work of fiction and bears no resemblance to any persons or events ever etc.' disclaimer appear in its closing credits. Worse, I sensed a strong bias from the writer (the writer of the book this was based on, assumedly), in that she seemed to be living vicariously through the character of Mary, and wanted her to be all things good, whilst her sister Anne had to appear as all things bad, assumedly to make Mary appear even better by comparison.

And as for the scene with Anne and her brother (and anyone who's seen the movie will know exactly what scene I mean), well, that was just ICKY!

I like my historical dramas to have at least some resemblance to actual history. And I like them to seem realistic and believable, not just like soap operas or bad romance novels, with inane dialogue and two-dimensional, illogically-constructed characters. I mean, in this movie, King Henry VIII is a thin, fairly stupid, silent and moody bloke who can be manipulated by the most transparent of women's wiles, who makes decisions on the merest hint of a whim, without a real thought of his own in his pretty little head. If King Henry VIII had been as much of a moron in real life as he was scripted to be in this movie, I doubt he would have survived beyond the cradle, let alone to become one of the most powerful, notorious, world-changing kings in history.

Oh, and one final thing -- if you're going to spend nearly half a movie boring us viewers by showing women in bed either in labour or miscarrying, at least get the details right.

3405059,2,B0017APPSE,"For those who give high ratings to 'The Other Boleyn Girl', I can only suggest that you either rent or buy the superb 1969 film, 'Anne of the Thousand Days'. Both films basically deal with the same subject but there's really no comparison. Where 'Anne' is a complex historical recreation and magisterial drama, 'The Other Boleyn...' is a ponderous soap opera, where numerous film-goers today have been taken in by the film's lavish production values (shot in High Definition), along with the three big name Hollywood stars who can't hold a candle to predecessors such as Richard Burton and Genevieve Bujold who really make you feel like you're watching flesh and blood human beings who lived in the 16th century.

I haven't read the book which the movie was based on but I question why it was necessary to tell Anne Boleyn's story through the eyes of her older sister Mary (inaccurately depicted as the younger sister here in this film). Mary's part in 'Anne of the Thousand Days' is wisely depicted as brief and her bitterness toward her father for 'pimping her out' to King Henry VIII is much more believable than Scarlett Johansson's Mary who continues to hold a soft spot for the King despite being unceremoniously dumped by him and bearing a child who was dubbed a bastard. Mary is basically depicted as a saint who we're supposed to identify with because she has a 'good heart'. Unfortunately, most saints make for boring drama and Johansson's Mary is no exception. Johansson did well in Woody Allen's well-scripted 'Vicky Christina Barcelona' but she is completely out of her element in the 16th century. Instead of a world weary traveler in the Tudor court, Johansson's Mary is more like an Amish-like simpleton whose grim and ponderous expressions suggest that she is an actor of extremely limited range. Mary has little to do in 'The Other Boleyn Girl'. Her two big scenes (the love scene with King Henry and the birth of her son) are devoid of substantial dramatic conflict.

What's worse is the suggestion that Anne and Mary were competitors for Henry's approval. In 'Anne of the Thousand Days', there was no competition between the two sisters. Mary's story was over when Anne comes on the scene. Genevieve Bujold defiantly states that she will never let the King do what he did to her sister and it takes a very long time in that film before Anne changes her mind. In The Other Boleyn Girl, Natalie Portman's Anne is a cold and calculating schemer from the beginning, inexplicably accusing her sister from taking the King from her. Later, she blames Mary for being responsible for the breakup of her secret union with Henry Percy. Ann's Uncle, the Duke of Northrop, orders that the two lovers separate. In 'Anne of the Thousand Days', the breakup is a matter of state policy. The head of the Catholic Church, Cardinal Wolsey, threatens Ann's lover and they're forced to part due to the King's designs on Anne. In 'The Other Boleyn Girl', Anne's undoing is attributed to what appears to be something like a bi-polar episode. After Henry rejects her because she can't bear a male heir, she becomes unhinged and ends up slapping him. In 'Anne of the Thousand Days', Anne is both the victim of Henry's cruelty and her own ambition to see her daughter declared the first in succession to the English throne.

Screenwriter Peter Morgan's view of Henry VIII is way off the mark. Thanks to Morgan's superficial portrait, Eric Bana, turns Henry into a GQ model rather than the petty but complex Henry of history. For those who are offended that I dare suggest that Bana isn't right for the part, I strongly urge you to watch Richard Burton in 'Anne of the Thousand Days'; afterward, come back and tell me with a straight face that you think Bana was right for this part. What's missing in 'The Other Boleyn Girl' is how Henry relates to members of his Court. Who are his friends and confidants? And of course there's the whole political intrigue of the court which is glossed over in 'The Other Boleyn Girl'. The key players, Cardinal Wolsey and the King's adviser, the deadly Thomas Cromwell, are missing. In 'Anne of the Thousand Days', there are a myriad of characters interacting with the King and as a result of these interactions, a full portrait of Henry's personality comes through. Here, Bana's Henry is dull and witless. What's more, Morgan's view of Henry and Anne's relationship has no real grace or drama. The best Morgan can come up with is a crude rape scene which reduces Henry to a comic book villain.

'The Other Boleyn Girl' is not without a few good points. Ana Torrent is brilliant as Katherine of Aragon, depicting the quiet dignity of a woman terribly wronged. David Morrissey is credible as the steely social-climbing uncle who holds the strings in the family. Kristin Scott Thomas as the Boleyn mother acquits herself well but she's a bit too much of a feminist icon for 16 century England. Mark Rylance was much too ineffectual as Sir Thomas Boleyn but he looks very good as a 16th century nobleman.

Production-wise, 'The Other Boleyn...' is filmed in sumptuous high definition and the scenes in the English countryside are a pleasure to watch. The camera work is for the most part pretty good with first-time director Justin Chardwick shooting scenes from a multiplicity of angles.

In the end, 'The Other Boleyn Girl' is not the other Boleyn's Girl story. If you want the 'real McCoy', then you must see Richard Burton and Genevieve Bujold together. They are master craftsmen and you will be truly moved by their performances. The remake connects the dots but can never hold a candle to the 1969 production. Sometimes it's best to leave things well enough alone!",1259366400,,5696,4.777664974619289
3405060,5,B0017APPSE,"""The Other Bolyn Girl"" was released to theatres on February 29th, 2008 and became an immediate hit grossing over $75,000,000 at the boxoffice. These were huge numbers considering the movie only cost $35,000,000 to produce. Perhaps it was the fact that television viewers, at the time, were enthralled by Showtime's ""The Tudors"" and movie-going audiences were inclined to watch a historical piece on King Henry VIII that made this a hit, but ""The Other Bolyn Girl"" could never have failed; it had all the ingredients of a hit film: stunning photography, a wonderful story that was known to its audience, and enthralling performances by its three leads. ""The Other Bolyn Girl"" tells the story of 16th-century aristocrats Mary and Anne, sisters, fighting over King Henry VIII. Mary would ultimately be only Henry's mistress(one of many) and Anne would become his second wife(also one of many). Both sisters were trying to better themselves and their family by getting involved with the Monarch, but both failed to realize the King was only in love with two things; his country and his unfulfilled sexual apetite. The sisters are played by Natalie Portman (Anne) and Scarlett Johansson (Mary), but it is Eric Bana, who plays King Henry, that is mesmerizing. He displays many emotions as the King of England; everything from raw sexuality (Eric is breathtaking to look at with his beard) to hatred, passion, love, desire, and vengefulness. The production values of this historical drama are first-rate with beautiful costumes and cinematography. The DVD comes with deleted and extended scenes, featurettes on the film and its historcial figures, and more. WNBC says of the film that it's , ""a wonderful, dramatic and powerful saga of the dangers of absolute power. The cast is impeccable"".

3405062,3,B0017APPSE,"""The Other Boleyn Girl"" tells the rise and fall of Anne Boleyn, the woman who manipulated Henry the Eighth into separating from the Vatican and who gave birth to Elizabeth, Britain's greatest monarch.

When Catherine of Aragon is unable to produce a male heir for the king (Eric Bana) the Boleyn family plays political intrigue, assigning Anne (Natalie Portman) to be Henry the Eighth's mistress. But Henry the Eighth prefers the younger sister Mary (Scarlett Johansson), and beds her. Dejected and angry Anne secretly marries the young lord Henry Percy, an impetuous act that is rewarded with her exile in France where she completes her education in the ways of man. Upon her return Anne seduces Henry the Eighth, manipulates him into rejecting her younger sister, the queen, and the Vatican. Branded as a witch by the English public Anne gives birth to Elizabeth, and then loses a child in a miscarriage. Fearing for her life and clearly growing insane Anne tries to get her brother George to impregnate her, and the king hears about this and beheads both.

When we first learn that Natalie Portman is to play the wildly ambitious seductress Anne and Scarlett Johansson her wide-eyed innocent sister we're forced to think that there's been a terrible mix-up in casting. But Natalie Portman is the anchor of the film, holding together a flimsy and sometimes incoherent script and yet another half-hearted performance by Scarlett Johansson.

Natalie Portman will be remembered as the greatest star of her generation -- the Audrey Hepburn of our times. She lacks the stunning overwhelming beauty of Audrey Hepburn but she is far more talented and versatile. She was terrible in the Star Wars trilogy but so was everyone else, and since then she has given nothing but competent performances. In ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" her character isn't all that believable and developed, her supposed transformation halfway through the movie isn't really noticeable, and it's hard to figure out why Henry the Eighth becomes so infatuated with her -- and yet despite all these stark flaws in the script and direction Natalie Portman's still compelling to watch: she's just stunningly beautiful draped in vermillion, and she makes the usually sexy Scarlett Johansson look dull and ditzy.

Ironically Portman's brilliant performance only hurts the film. The film is designed to be a tragedy, centering around a family that suddenly rises and then suddenly falls because of their overwhelming thirst for power. It is this blind famly ambition that would create Anne Boleyn, a woman who's either evil or insane and who almost singlehandedly managed to tear England apart. Countering Anne is good and noble Mary, who almost loses her soul to her family's ambition but in the end learns to trust her goodness. So what does it say about the direction of the film and the film itself when at the end we really don't care about Mary, and we don't want Anne to be beheaded even after we've seen Anne destroy her younger sister, destroy the good queen, and try to bed her brother?

Clearly directors need to learn to control Natalie Portman better. She's not yet as famous and powerful as Julia Roberts and Tom Cruise but already she can warp a film -- in a very uncanny Anne Boleyn way -- around her. The good news is that unlike Julia Roberts and Tom Cruise she is talented, and when she finds a script and meets a director worthy of her talent the result will be truly mesmerizing.",1257811200,,3456,4.890784982935154

3405064,3,B0017APPSE,"I saw this only about a week after having seen Ann of a Thousand Days so, of course, my mind was busy making comparisons.  I'm not a student of English history but from what I've read here, ""Ann"" was much closer to actuality.  It seems to me that if you're going to make a historical drama, tell the real story--otherwise why bother?

As far as casting is concerned, Richard Burton and Genevieve Bujold were head and shoulders better than this group, with the exception of Kristin Scott-Thomas, who is always good.  Apparently these were chosen for box office appeal. Scarlett Johannsen is a gifted ""personality"" (don't know if I'd really call her an actress.)
She is physically gorgeous and has a strong screen presence, which suits her very well for some roles.  However here she was given the role of the shy, mousy sister--what a waste of glam-power.  She played ""dumb"" a lot, often by looking blank and breathing through her mouth---not attractive.

Natalie Portman is very pretty and she can act a lot better than Scarlett, but neither one of them had the substance that one looks for in a drama of this sort.  Let them stick to what they can do.  The fellow who played Henry was certainly hunky and handsome which gave credence to the fact that both sisters fell for him so quickly-but he lacked the power and authority that made Burton so convincing in the role.

The script of Ann of a Thousand Days was much more flattering to Ann.  She was shown as an innocent for most of the film and Bujold shone bright and clear in that role, which captured the sympathy of the viewer.  I wept at the final scene, when she asked the executioner ""if it would hurt"" and declared that she had ""a tiny neck.""  In this film, Ann was shown to be a calculating, duplicitous girl from the beginning so that I really didn't care what happened to her.

I am not always a stickler for historical accuracy but in this case I think some pretty big liberties were taken with the facts.  Having Henry rape Ann was certainly a violation.  Also the question of Ann and her brother having sex--did this happen or not?  Was he gay?  These are not minor issues--they are important to the plot and should have been shown truthfully.

If you really don't care about what really happened, then you can watch this film and enjoy the pretty people and lush costumes.  Although those pretty people are prettier in other films.",1253664000,,2398,4.571428571428571
3405065,4,B0017APPSE,"I was a history major in college and was surprised by this storyline, or more surprised by people who believed it to be true. I haven't read the book but I took the movie as entertainment and a work of fiction and if judged by those standards you will love this beautiful, cunning tale.",1252800000,,286,4.314814814814815
3405066,1,B0017APPSE,"Let me preface this by saying I read the novel way before the film was released. The book was all right, if relatively inaccurate about historical plot points. It is indeed a work of fiction based on people who lived, so you take the good with the bad. But the film? Half of it didn't even follow its own source material, let alone ANY of the actual history of Anne and Mary Boleyn!

Trying to cram several decades of events into two hours is challenging, but throwing away important points is the result of terrible script writing. Eric Bana is awful as Henry VIII; he captures none of the drama and power and majesty of the real man. Natalie Portman is decent as Anne Boleyn, but there is still something lacking in her performance. Scarlett Johansson was pretty much only there to be just that, pretty. The rest of the actors and actresses were relatively miss-cast as well. They seemed to be phoning in their performances.

But the worst part was the historical inaccuracies portrayed by this film. Some of the most stand-out ones being:

Mary allegedly hopping directly into bed with Henry VIII and skipping the fact that she was originally sent to the French court (where she was allegedly the mistress of the King of France for a time.) Anne had also been at the French court; she was never ""banished"" there. She was actually there when Mary started her affair with Henry VIII!

The ""Henry VIII fell down a ravine and got hurt!"" bit? Totally made up.

Mary had two children during her time at the English court. Catherine and Henry were never officially announced as Henry VIII's bastards; it was only implied later on.

Anne and Mary were never close. It is believed that Mary was actually the elder sister and Anne the youngest. It wasn't until after the affair with Mary that Henry VIII took any interest in Anne. And Henry VIII never banished Mary at Anne's wishes.

That bit where Catherine of Aragon confronted Anne and Mary? NEVER HAPPENED!

Mary married William Stafford in secret, shortly after Anne became Queen and gave birth to her daughter Elizabeth, but as soon as the secret was found out, Mary was disowned by her family and the couple was banished from court. Mary was virtually penniless and begged Thomas Cromwell to speak on her behalf to Anne and Henry VIII. None in her family would help her; Anne eventually took some pity on Mary and sent her some money but refused to receive her at court.

Mary NEVER begged Henry VIII to spare Anne's life. She never attended Anne or George's executions and never returned to court. Nor did Mary raise her niece Elizabeth. She most likely never even saw Elizabeth, as the future queen was raised at Hatfield House.

Honestly, this movie was terrible. It was almost as if the script writer wrote plot points on slips of paper and drew them out of a hat, then cobbled the script together with droll dialogue. They couldn't even get the scenery right. Why must Hollywood screw up something that's actually documented? History is far more entertaining than fiction!

If you want to watch something quality with decent attempts to be historically accurate (although with its own faults) I suggest you pick up Seasons 1 and 2 of HBO's ""The Tudors"". Beautifully cast, great acting, fantastic script writing, only minor inaccuracies in places. Skip ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" entirely!",1252108800,,3341,4.733218588640275
3405067,4,B0017APPSE,"I have not read the book by this same title. Nor have I watched any of the popular Tudor's series of late.

I don't know what's worse...watching a film that is beautiful in scenery, costume and acting not knowing what the outcome will be and hoping for the best, or knowing and having the impotent sense of horror as you watch it all unfold. The film starts with ""Mr."" Boleyn offering his girls to the highest bidder...more or less. Anne (Natalie Portman), the oldest, is requested for marriage. Her father offers her younger, equally beautiful sister Mary, (Scarlett Johansson) instead. She's the nicer of the two and more likely to be content with a mere merchant.

 Father is not, he has great ambition for his children. And so the story goes.

Mary's marriage conveniently gets set aside on account of the King Henry's (Eric Bana) great need for a male heir and his wife's inability to provide one. When Mary Boleyn is pregnant, the king's eye must not wander away from the tight circle of power that is being woven around him, enter Anne.

But Anne has ambition of her own. The madness and horrible outcome unfolds in the absolute worst possible way. The history is fascinating and brutal. As ugly as American politics are today, they are nothing compared to the drama of King Henry's court.

There are sex scenes in the film. However, they are more arty that crude. One is disturbing but both partners are shown fully clothed. A couple others are shown quickly and include a naked thigh in profile. Beheadings occur off screen. There is no language warning. The lighting was sometimes a little dark. And more than one scene change made me pause to figure out what had just happened.

Definitely worth the rental in my book. But a little depressing to keep in my permanent library, but if I can find it for a decent price I might. It felt very much like  Girl With a Pearl Earring and a little like Marie Antoinette. Fans of either or both would probably like Other Boleyn.",1251763200,,1978,4.615384615384615
3405068,1,B0017APPSE,"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix was actually closer to the book than this was.  I would never guess that even possible!  Ill admit that I had to turn the movie off after 1 hr 10 minutes because it was..... lunacy.  I'm sure Ann was not happy that her sister was marrying b4 her because they are rivals but the movie makes her seem not only happy but almost excited.

Ann seems soft and girly.

Marys marriage to sir Carey was not romantic, it was arranged so the conversation in the dancing circle about loving him for him and not needing someone grander never took place

It was not Marys wedding that Ann caught the eye of Percy

I don't think that Princess Mary was there when The Queen miscarried.  Children are sent away at the very latest 4 and with Mary being a Princess She was sent away much sooner that that.  When the Queen did see Mary it was because she and the King visited her not she visit them.

The first conversation between father and uncle bugs me.  #1, uncle talks of the king needing a mistress soon and suggests a Howard girl  that isn't how it happened.  Henry took an active interest in Mary and they went from there it was not premeditated.  2 they say that father suggested Ann and uncle was concerned that she she was his first born and favorite and father might want a simpler life for her.  This is absolutely ridiculous.  If this conversation had actually taken place which I know it didn't because of #1, uncle would have salivated!  He cares of nothing and no one but himself getting ahead and it doesn't matter who gets him there.  He never would have been concerned that father might want a simpler marriage for Ann.

On Mary's wedding night when Ann and Mary are having a heart to heart and Mary is telling Ann that no one could wish for a better sister, I notice that the B is absent from Ann's pearl necklace.

Check to see if the king and really went to the Boleyn's.  The girls were members of court at 4 years old so I don't think that is how it would have played out.  Additionally Ann is wearing a cross from her pearls instead of the B.  If you read the book you know that the B on her necklace is where Ann pulls her confidence. It is a symbol of everything she is.  It's her soul on a chain.

Ann was not with the king when he was initially hurt.  She was in France.  He hasn't met her yet.

This is lunacy. Mary is tending to the king after the first injury instead of the queen!  The Queen always takes care of the king.  After the king is hurt the second time in the book and slipping in and out of conscience, it is the Queen (even though shes dead) that he calls out to exclaiming that if she were here she would know exactly what to do. Additionally he asks why hes never seen her at court.  Mary was raised at court and has served by the Queens side her whole life so much so that she looks at the Queen as a mother to her.

On top of the fact that Mary and Ann don't go to court together instead Mary has been there since she was four to serve the Queen (and is her favorite) and when Ann comes home from France (not because she was exiled) she goes to the castle and visits George and Mary.  This is the first time that the King meets Ann.

Am i watching the right movie??????

The girl that chases Mary to tell her what a good woman the Queen is after she makes Mary sing is so sweet.  I almost fell off the couch when she introduced herself as Jane Parker.  Haha what a joke that girl doesn't have a sweet bone in her crazy, nosy body.

30 minutes in and we meet Stafford!!!  Oh for crying out loud.  And they should have made him hotter.  ps  Still no B on Ann's chain

George was supposed to walk Mary to the kings Quarters.  He does so every time and he waits outside for her and escorts her back to her room.

Did Mary really ask the king to have the servants bring her water?  Ill check but I don't think so.  She never asked him for anything until after they had children and it was only in their regards.

On a positive note Good choice for King.  What a knockout!!!!!!

I cant believe how badly Ann's marriage is portrayed.  They are engaged and bed but not legally married to get legally married they have to go to Wolsey and thus creates the very seed of Ann's hate and ambition.  ahhh

The movie works hard to make the Boleyn girls mother seem loving and caring and even sad at Ann's departure to France (which is all screwed up) but in truth she stands quietly behind her husband and brother.  She even states to Mary in the book that she did what was best for her children by sending them away at 4 and no she most certainly never missed them at all.

A son!!!!!!!!!!  What of baby Catherine

I am 50 minutes into the movie and Ann finally has her B necklace.  I have to give up on notes because the movie isn't even close to the book.

At 70 minutes I have given up on the film.  I am embarrassed that someone tried to pull this off as a movie of the book.  Maybe if it had been someones version of what happened I would get that but to say it is of the book is absurd. Everything is so screwed up I can't stand it.  The way Henry courts Ann, Mary's little girl isn't even in the movie, the lack of relationship between Mary and the Queen (and how they are associated) the list goes on and on.  I give up.

In the film, Boleyn sisters Mary (Scarlett Johansson) and Ann (Natalie Portman) are raised in the country. The two girls are unfortunate enough to have an ambitious father and uncle, who plot to advance the family's fortune and position. To achieve such a lofty goal, the two men decide to use Mary and Ann as bait for the frustrated King of England (Eric Bana), whose current wife has failed to bear a male heir to the throne.

The King is initially captivated by Mary's innocence and sweetness. However, conniving Ann turns the King's affections towards herself, despite the fact that Mary bears the King an illegitimate son. Unsatisfied with simply being a mistress, Ann convinces the King to divorce his wife and break with the Catholic church, merely to possess her. As England, and the Boleyn family, is ripped in twain by the King's actions, Ann and Mary cling to one another.

I thought that all performances were solid, but the movie suffered from a talk-y plot and too much meandering, too much readiness to cast blame upon characters rather than just present the action. Also, it is unfortunate that Johansson's beauty, one of her greatest assets on screen, was basically washed-out in this film. Very little makeup, lots of drab colors. I understand she was presented as an opposite of the vibrant Ann, but such choices did the actress a disservice.

Bana did an admirable job, as did Kristin Scott Thomas (who played mother to the two girls). David Morissey, as the calculating Duke of Norfolk, was delightfully seedy.

""Mary Boleyn"" (Scarlet Johansen) is a sap who moves out of Henry's bed without a murmer, so that her sister can take her place.  ""Anne Boleyn"" (Natalie Portman) is a brazen hussy who gives the king and his assembled court a lecture and brags about using ""[my] thighs"" to stay on her horse.

Bana is surprisingly good at Henry VIII, and Kristen Scott Thomas steals every scene she is in.

The film's pace is so sprightly it is over before we can really appreciate what is happening between the characters, who therefore develop very little, and so we can't come to care about them. In the end, they are just three attractive cardboard cut outs in nice outfits.

Mary was a ribald character and was not at her sister's Anne's side faithfully thru all.  In truth, the two sisters were not close.

Too bad the film didn't choose to focus on the intense struggles between Rome and England, didn't go more into depth on Anne's fierce Protestant sympathies, and didn't delve into the remarkable personalities of Wolsey, Cromwell and Thomas More.

So, when I bought this movie I didn't expect accuracy, but I did expect to be entertained. The only connection between this and the Gregory books, besides fleeting moments, is the title. This is even less accurate than the book, and much less entertaining.

The makers compressed relationships so much that the audience doesn't have a chance to care about any of these people. The Mary/Henry relationship in the book was much more fleshed out -- Mary was the main character. They're barely shown having a relationship, yet the movie tried to trade on that bond.

The Anne/Henry relationship was just a mess, following no logic. We know he turned on her, but the movie would have you believe that he did so after one conversation with Catherine, but that he married her anyhow -- completely random. If the events of the relationship with Anne post marriage were any faster, they'd be a montage. There was no time at all to see it slipping away from Anne. There are a couple brief scenes where they show her desperate, but to someone unfamiliar with it all, it wouldn't convey the true scope of what happened. Even a Lifetime movie fleshes out characters better than this, even the villainous  husband characters.

I loved when Stafford proposed to Mary and they'd simply not cared to point out that her first husband had died. We see him early on looking sad that his wife has to bed the king and then he's shuffled off the stage. This has to be confusing to people not familiar enough with the story.

Everybody was wasted in this, the whole movie was a waste. Throw away accuracy, if you must, but the result should still be a good story. This movie failed in every way possible.

There are three good things about this film. First, the tension between the beautiful women. While Natalie Portman appears rather rigid through the film, Scarlett Johanssen is great. It's strange to see these beautiful women spar with one another, and that tension makes the film more enjoyable because it makes the audience tense.

The second good thing about the film are the beautiful sets. The film sets the Tudor mode wonderfully.

In my review of the book this movie is based on, I noted that the book is very bad history, but if you are willing to accept the premise of a ""Boleyn alternate reality"", it is not a bad story. Sadly, the movie doesn't even have that in its favor.

The timeline is rushed and compressed into a few short years, leaving the viewer disoriented and confused at the blurred pacing. Although I had not thought it possible, Anne has been vilified here even worse than in the novel, and Henry is uncharacteristically physically violent and cruel, apparently so that we could have a violent rape scene presented to us. The rape of Anne is particularly disturbing because the viewer seems to be expected to revel in Anne's ""comeuppance"" - apparently her sexual assault is meant to be seen as her fitting punishment for being such a shrew during the first half of the movie. I can think of no other explanation for this gratuitous and violent scene, which almost certainly never happened and was not even featured in the book. The entire feel of the movie from that point onward - rape, madness, (attempted) incest - is quite disturbing. The gross distortion of history in movies is common, but this strange obsession with the most sordid gossip about Anne despite the fact that even the source novel managed a light touch seems to reveal less to us about Anne and more about the screenwriters. (I kept expecting them to accuse Anne of bestiality, too, just to be really thorough.)

As far as the acting, Johansson does a good job portraying the Mary Boleyn of the novel, but since Mary serves only as a window through which Anne's actions are observed, she seems criminally wasted in this role. Portman tackles the job of Anne-as-demon-spawn with verve and determination, particularly in the elopement scene. Katherine is played well enough, with the proper amount of stern stubbornness, but Henry seems terribly out of sorts and character - in keeping with the book where Gregory seems unable to see him concretely as much of anything, but rather just a leaf on the wind of the women he surrounds himself with.

This movie is closed captioned for the hearing impaired.

It was like reading the cliff notes for Tolstoy's ""Anna Karenina"" - Married woman in Russia falls in love with soldier, runs away, gets hit by train.  The movie didn't have any of the details of the rise of Anne Boleyn, the persuasion and manipulation of Henry or the problems that she caused with the country.  The main thread throughout the movie was sex.  I do understand that power was bought and traded with sex.  But it only seems that this movie was made in order to show Portman and Johansson half naked or more.

This movie was a total disappointment.  Understand that a movie based on a book will never be as good as the book.  I do think though that a reader should expect more.

I loved the book, but when I compared the movie to it, the movie left a lot to be desired. When I looked at the film as just a film, standing alone, with no basis for it, I loved it. It was a great film, and it added a few things that I wasn't expecting that were credible.

For people like me, though, who adore learning about the Tudor period, the film was innacurate, even ignoring all that was left out from the book. I was grateful for its tasteful love scenes, since I am not a fan of graphic sex scenes, but much of the movie didn't really hit the mark, I thought, when comparing it to Henry VIII's real court and the real characters. Some of the dresses were a little over-the-top, I thought, especially the shiny green one Anne is wearing on the DVD cover. My favorite scene that I thought was the clearest view of the characters was Anne's breakdown.

I thought Natalie Portman was an outstanding choice to play Anne, and as much as I like Scarlett Johannson, the part of Mary Boleyn was not right for her.

The Other Boleyn Girl delivers on the gloss but the acting is mediocre at best, the writing several steps below mediocre.  I rather like Natalie Portman, but her variable English accent was distracting, to say the least.  (Obviously there is some logic in casting English actors in such roles.)  I didn't find Eric Bana particularly appealing (maybe we hetero males aren't easily swayed by an actor's looks), and the rape of Anne is unhistorical and was obviously included to spice up a rather dull movie.  (Tip to movie-makers: sex can actually be very titillating when it's just suggested, and off-screen.) After seeing this movie on DVD, I found myself dragging my old Six Wives of Henry VIII tapes out of the closet and relishing the great acting and the intelligent scripts, and the great actress Dorothy Tutin as Anne is a pretty tough act to follow.

It was the story that was lacking and really quite depressing. I don't remember feeling depressed reading the book -- just a bit fascinated with the author's portrayal of the court and sad for the noblewomen who had little to no control over their own destinies.

If the movie had been named differently, I would've watched it with the expectation that it might have a different take on the story. All I could think about, though, was ""Hey wait, that's wrong."" And ""No, that didn't happen."" And ""Hey, that's not the way it's supposed to be."" Even knowing that most films can't adhere that closely to the book, this one was so far off that it was jarring.

Do I think you'd enjoy it if you hadn't read the book? Hard to tell. So many parts were glossed over that I don't know how easy it would be to follow the story and the characters. For instance, Mary is courted by Stafford, but we weren't told that her young husband had died, so that seemed weird. I'd suggest you read the book instead.

3405101,2,B0017APPSE,"If this film had been based on the life of a fictional King of England, I would not have had a problem with it. However, as it is presented as an account of the lives of Henry VIII and the Boleyn sisters, packing a staggering disregard for historical accuracy, it gets rather low marks in my book.

As other reviewers have pointed out, the list of inaccuracies is too long and complex to even begin to tackle, but I can't resist citing a few: for starters, Mary is considered to have been the older sister; the King had tired of Mary before taking a fancy to Anne so there was never any competition there; Anne and Mary were not thought to be close and Mary was not present at Anne's execution. Though painted as pure and chaste, Mary had already been the mistress of King Francis I of France before she made her way into Henry VIII's bed, and had a solid reputation of promiscuity at the French court where she and Anne both spent time. While it is portrayed as a matter of fact that Mary gave birth to the King's son, in reality the child was thought to be that of Mary's first husband William Carey, and Henry VIII never acknowledged the boy as his. However the King did acknowledge the son of a previous mistress, Elizabeth Blount, so perhaps the characters of Mary and Bessie are merged into one in the film. In one scene, Mary reads aloud a few sentences of a love letter from the King which was actually one he had written to Anne. In another, the King assaults Anne sexually before their marriage which almost certainly did not happen. Though he was indeed a tyrant and thought nothing of sending whomever he so desired to their brutal deaths, personally administering violence didn't appear to be his thing.  And some of the most important figures behind the scenes of Anne's ultimate undoing are nowhere to be found, while others, like Anne's uncle the Duke of Norfolk, seems to be merged with the notably absent Cardinal Wolsey and Thomas Cranmer.

The film does get a few minor points right. Both Anne and her father were highly ambitious manipulative schemers, the King went all out to rid himself of his first wife Katherine (though the complexity of the circumstances behind this would have filled up a six week mini-series and is only dealt with fleetingly in the film). And of course, Anne did lose her head in the end.

Only die hard fans of Natalie Portman and Scarlett Johansen should bother, with the understanding that practically nothing in it is based in actual fact; those interested in a history lesson should pass it up.

Despite the foregoing, lead actresses performed rather admirably, especially since neither is English, and Portman had captured the essence of who Anne probably really was, if perhaps slightly less evil. Eric Bana as King Henry VIII was generally fine, and I especially liked Anna Torrent as Queen Katherine. On a trivial side note, Henry and Queen Katherine, his Spanish first wife, were both redheads, but are rarely protrayed as such.",1231632000,,2986,4.6477272727272725

Though no ""A Man for all Seasons"" by any stretch of the imagination, Justin Chadwick`s ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" is a handsomely mounted, reasonably entertaining soap opera set in the politically-charged court of King Henry VIII.

Based on the highly fictionalized and speculative novel by Phillipa Gregory, the movie chronicles the 16th Century catfight between the two Boleyn sisters - the more famous one, Anne, whose marriage to the divorced king resulted in England's final rupture with the Church of Rome (and the eventual loss of her own head when she, like his first wife Catherine, could not provide him with a male heir), and the lesser known, already married Mary who, at least as portrayed in this film, was every bit as attractive to the king as the sister who would eventually win his hand.

The Peter Morgan screenplay reduces the complex historical events to the level of a Harlequin Romance, pitting the two sisters against one another in a competition for the king's affections.  All of this is of considerably less interest than the almost ruthless, behind-the-scenes machinations undertaken by the girls' family to groom them as concubines for the crass purpose of currying royal favor.  In fact, it is when the movie touches on the mores of the time and of life at court that it is at its most compelling.

Natalie Portman, Scarlett Johansson and Eric Bana all seem to be having great fun playing at dress-up, but the richest performances are delivered by Mark Rylance and David Morrissey as the girls' calculating father and uncle respectively, and Kristin Scott Thomas as their levelheaded, pragmatic mother, helpless to prevent the tragedy that was doomed to engulf her family.

The costumes and settings are nothing short of sensational, and they alone maintain our interest even when the scriptwriting fails to live up to the level of its subject.",1230681600,,1879,5.003205128205129

She is married already, and that makes it easier, for the king need not bother with her virginhood.  Mary has a child with Henry and then is abandoned; his interest now turns to her sister, Ann, who had been in France a while, ""educating"" herself in court manners. Now she is a daring woman who has the temerity to exchange witticism with the mighty king. She defies him to marry her, something that will cost England a rift with the Pope.

The details of two beheadings, for she has to be found guilty of something--incest with her brother--are gruesome, and both she and her brother undergo the usual decapitation process, he with an ax, his head on a block, she by a horizontal hit with a blade that cuts off her head while she knees, and her head and neck are in vertical position.

Eric Bana, who plays Henry, makes an effort to make this male monster's tale sympathetic--after all he has to have a son!--but, in this one of his weakest performances, only succeeds in giving the viewer a bag of inconsistencies, for Henry seems beyond redemption--whatever his reasons.

It was just a bit over the top and probably just done to show the differences between the relationship with the sisters.....

Someone previously had mentioned that Mary and Henry's conversations in the movie seemed inadequate and unfulfilling....I think that for the time it was appropriate.

3405119,4,B0017APPSE,"""The Other Boleyn Girl"" is an entertaining historical drama that reminds many of us that the rakish, irresponsible Henry VII actually knew two Boleyn women - the known one - Anne, and the unknown one, Mary.

The film tells a story how both sisters end up romancing the king, and how both are used by their father and the Duke of Norfolk to assure their family's status and fortune. Like the later film, ""The Duchess,"" the film paints an extremely bleak portrait of a woman's life and choices - something that changed very recently in history.

Eric Bana brings life and vitality to Henry, depicting a time before the king had become corpulent and lazy. Natalie Portman is duplicitous and still manages to conjure some sympathy as Anne, and Scarlett Johansson is noble and admirable as Mary.

People will aruge over the factual nature of the film, but history should be learned from history research, not from motion pictures. This is a great story and one that can be enjoyed by many.",1224460800,,984,4.709302325581396
3405120,4,B0017APPSE,"Although the characters are real and the story based on true events, the author takes a good deal of liberty with the plot - this is a ""what might have happened"" vision of history and as such cannot be taken too seriously.

That said, it is an interesting depiction of 16th century England at the court of King Henry VIII, when position and power meant everything, it was very much a man's world and women were reduced to mere pawns to serve their advancement (either as wives or mistresses) and assure their descendance. All in all, I found the film entertaining, more so than the television serie, where the actors were less charismatic and somewhat unconvincing, especially Anne.

However, my favorite film on the subject remains ""Anne of the thousand days"", which is closer to the real story and far more believable as a whole, and Genevieve Bujold and Richard Burton deliver dynamite performances.",1224288000,,902,4.85064935064935

A great treat after a long study--Not being one who is especially fond of history...before my study of Henry VIII for a Church History class, I knew very little of the Boleyns.  Since I am a visual learner, I looked for a movie to see if I had a grip on the information.

The producers intend to show how women in a different era were debased for ambition. But with their historical inaccuracies they once again debase Anne Boleyn but on a much wider scale then Henry VIII could've dreamt. He was in reality a narcissist and serial adulterer who would kill or accuse a wife of anything to be rid of her. This movie claims a lot of the rumors he created about Anne were true and reported by people without machiavellian motivations. In the process they debase a woman who happened to be vaguely successful in her ambitions, while rewriting history to glorify women of the court who lived dark and petty lives. Phillipa Gregory and the producers should all get jobs at McDonalds. The product would be about the same.",1223769600,,889,4.741935483870968
3405123,2,B0017APPSE,"First of, I haven't read the book. So you won't be seeing me complaining about the differences between the two.

Boleyn Girl is a pretty movie. From the actors, to the setting and the cinematography, everything is put together in a way that pleases the eye.
But aesthetics isn't quite enough, and it doesn't make up for blatant flaws like the bad accents, the over the top story that resembles a soap opera and the script that manages to be uninteresting although dealing with a subject that can appeal to most audiences: two sisters on luxurious dresses and living in a castle fight for the same man, who happens to be a king. Deny it if you will, but everyone loves a little intrigue and cat fight especially if it comes from the absurdly beautiful main actresses.

Speaking of which, they both use to full extent their amazing acting skills, although not at all times. Portman manages to be stunning while acting alongside with Scarlett, which is quite an accomplish on her side.

Overall, the movie has a flawed script that isn't made up by the talented main actresses or the beauty of the movie itself. What amazes me about it is not what it is, but what could have been. With such a cast and story, it could have easily become one of the best period movie of the last few years. It didn't.

Too bad.",1223683200,,1305,4.493670886075949
3405124,1,B0017APPSE,"To begin with, let me say that I am a huge fan of Phillipa Gregory's. I read my paperback copy so many times that pages almost fell out. But after watching this movie I almost started hating the novel. Yes I understand that Hollywood has many difficulties in translating book to film, but this was basically a failure. So many literary AND historical inaccuracies it was laughable.
  The mother was shown as too sympathetic and the father extremely weak, Mary and Anne became enemies much too quickly, Mary was married too late, and Stafford?! They should never have brought him into the movie so early; it ruins his future relationships and role with Mary. A major dislike for me was Mary's great reluctance to leave the country for court-mainly this was bad because in the book she BEGAN at court-as well, her loving the King came up really suddenly, she sleeps with him twice and BOOM! ""Anne, I love him,"" a little fast even for this movie. And WHERE did William Carey go to?! Just ""disappeared"" and Mary starts leaning toward Stafford. Implausible, yet no one seemed to notice. But I felt pity for the character of Anne during her virtual rape by the King-that was NEVER even insinuated in by any historians. And George Boleyn, for a character with such a pivotal role in the story, he had very little screen time, though Jim Sturgess did a fine job.
  Also, the basic premise of the story-two sisters' rivalry for a King's love and standing in court-is twisted by having Anne try to catch the King first, and getting him injured. Anne was shown as having an extraordinary amount of power over even her family, especially too much sway over her uncle. The debate over sending Queen Katherine away was cut too short, as was the furor over divorce. Showing Mary in the countryside and Anne in France would have also been nice touches.
  I truly admired Katherine of Aragon's character-very regal and formidable and her quoted lines from the novel- and how the failed Henry Percy marriage was shown. Also, Mary's lying in and both sisters' birthing scenes were very adequately stifling and scary. This could definitely be shown as an ""anti-teen pregnancy movie."" Anne's coronation was suitably gaudy and brought to film well as did the people's ill reception of her as queen. Another well-done accuracy was Jane Boleyn's betrayal; almost all sources agree she began the family's downfall. But when the King decided to forgo Mary completely just to have the HOPE of getting with Anne I became utterly disgusted with the movie and could barely finish it. This is saying a lot for me since Scarlett Johannsen and Natalie Portman are two of my favorite actresses.
  So maybe the author approved of the novel being dissected and stripped apart by this movie's portrayal, I as a fan, truly dislike this movie adaptation. I was all set to enjoy and revel in seeing some of my favorite characters and storylines brought to life, but this time Hollywood failed me.",1223164800,,2956,4.759765625

Before viewing the movie I had little knowledge about Henry VIII other than he had six wives whom he beheaded.  I was intrigued by the plot of the story and decided to investigate into the history of his rule a bit further.  I quickly found out though that the details of The Other Boleyn Girl are not entirely accurate.

I recommend this movie to anyone who is looking for over-the-top drama in a historical movie, rather than accurateness.  I enjoyed watching the movie because I had little knowledge about the historical background beforehand and felt the tension unfold as the characters' relationships became more and more complex.

3405131,3,B0017APPSE,"If you've read the novel this movie is based upon ('The Other Boleyn Girl,' by Phillipa Gregory), you'll probably be a bit disappointed in the movie.  Natalie Portman does give a good performance as Anne Boleyn, but Scarlett Johansson is less than stellar as Anne's sister, Mary.  The script focuses too heavily on Anne and her relationship with Henry VIII, ignoring the other characters that made the book so interesting: the Duke of Norfolk, Anne and Mary's brother George and the role he played in Anne's downfall are largely ignored.

Those of you who are familiar with Henry VIII are likely to be left scratching their heads over the choice of Eric Bana in the role of Henry.  While I'm sure Mr. Bana is a fine actor, he bears no physical resemblance to Henry at all.  Furthermore, the script writers left his quite one dimensional.  In their efforts to showcase the hold Anne Boleyn had over Henry, he's left appearing like a dog on a leash, rather than besotted.

Great time periods are compressed as if events that, in reality, occurred over years and years appear to have happened in just days.  This leaves the film with a disjointed feeling.

The role of Henry Percy, Anne's first husband, provides unintentional comic relief.  While he appears in several scenes (and is quite important in Anne Boleyn's life story), the poor character has no lines whatsoever and the actor is left resorting to over-dramatic facial expressions. Very funny to watch.

The one bright star in the production is the performance of Ana Torrent as Katherine of Aragon, Henry's first wife.  Not only are her physical attributes perfect for the role, but her performance is utterly believable and left me wishing her role had been larger.

If you're unfamiliar with the original novel or Anne Boleyn's story, you may very well enjoy this film.  Do not, however, believe this film is in any way historically accurate.  If you loved the novel and are a history buff, you might want to skip this one altogether and go rent a copy of ""The Lion in Winter"" for a great retelling of Henry II and Eleanor of Aquitaine....much more accurate and a good history lesson, too.",1220745600,,2150,4.772972972972973

3405134,2,B0017APPSE,"Do you remember that ""telephone"" game? The child at the beginning of the circle whispers a word to the kid next to them and it passes down the line becoming more distorted as it goes along. By the time it makes it back to the beginning it usually has no resemblance to what it was supposed to be.

This is a pretty good metaphor for ""The Other Boleyn Girl."" The dramatic license in Phillipa Gregory's book caused controversy but ultimately resulted in an entertaining story.

In contrast, the film plays somewhat like a game of telephone that started with a Cliff Notes version of Gregory's novel. As the film progress, the storyline spirals farther and farther outside the realm of credibility.

The life and times of Henry VIII were tumultuous, dramatic, and populated by interesting characters. It should have been an easy task to write a reasonably entertaining script about this era. Unfortunately, a fifth grader's plagarized essay on this period would a lot easier to get through than this extremely boring and disappointing film adaptation.

I can't fault Eric Bana's performance. He made a great Henry VIII despite limited screen time. Other cast members made valiant efforts to squeeze something out of the terrible script they were saddled with. Sadly, the beautiful costumes and scenery might have been an asset to this film if I could have stayed awake to appreciate them better.

My friends who saw the movie in the theatre warned me that it was disappointing if you were a fan of the book (or if you had even read the book!) and they were not wrong.

This is a horrible adaptation.  ""Loosely based"" is a generous description of what this movie did to Gregory's work.  None of the characters are well developed, so you end up asking yourself ""why did she/he do that"" at critical points of the movie because you don't have the background provided by the book to understand the character's motivation.  Also, the movie is primarily about Anne Boleyn (Natalie Portman) whereas the book is about the other Boleyn sister (duh) Mary (Scarlett Johansen).  The book's focus on Mary was what made it an interesting take on the whole Anne Boleyn/Henry VIII saga--if you want to see something purely about Anne Boleyn watch ""Anne of a Thousand Days"" or even the recent Showtime ""Tudors""--both are better.

I will say that this movie is beautiful to watch.  They obviously spent lots of money on costumes and sets, so it is a visually pleasing film.

Seymour's  daughters the mistress of KIng Henry.
Initially Anne (Natalie Portman) is selcted but after a riding accident he is nursed by Mary (Scarlet Johansen) who he coerces into becoming his mistress.
Meanwhile Anne marries the nobleman Henry Percy (Oliver Coleman) and refuses to keep this a secret, therefore being exiled to France by her angry uncle and father.

Lady Elizabeth Boleyn (Kristin Scott Thomas) is broken hearted about her children used as pawns in Sir Thomans and Norfolk's power play but is powerless to stop it.
Anne returns from France at a time when Mary is recovering from a miscarriage and beguiles the king with her beauty, charm and intelligence.
Though Mary bears the king a son born out of wedlock, Anne has enraptured the king and by withholding her sexual favours, forces his hand in wedding her.
The divorce of Queen Katherine and marriage to Anne Boleyn, as is well known, resulted in Henry breaking with the Roman  Catholic Church and founding the Church of England.
Anne bears Henry a daughter Elizabeth but the marriage is unhappy and Anne is brutally raped by the King.
Desperate for a male heir Anne unsuccessfully asks her brother George Seymour (Jim Sturgess) to impregnate her. This is discovered and Anne is accused of adultery and imprisoned. Her sister Mary begs King Henry to spare Anne's life but both George  and Anne are executed.
Mary fulfills her last promise to Anne and takes care of her infant daughter.
Ultimately one is struck by how for all Anne's machinations both girls are simply porns in a game by powerful men and don't stand a chance.
The closing scene tells us that though Anne did not produce the male heir desired by the King, she instead was the mother to Elizabeth who would reign for 45 years as one of England's greatest rulers, accompanied by a photographic shot of the little Princess Elizabeth (Maisie Smith), a truly beautiful ending and promise of great things to come out of the tragedy and heartbreak.

I've seen better costumes on sale at the Halloween store. No one making this movie was interested in the facts.

Anne, Mary, Henry, Katherine, how could they not be rolling in their graves? The accounts are there. I'm sorry that some people will actually believe that this is the way that it was. Books. Go read some books. Books are good.",1216944000,,678,4.697478991596639
3405175,3,B0017APPSE,"You really have to take this movie for what it is. It's just a big, dumb historical soap opera, with pretty locations, some Hollywood actresses, and a lot of nice frocks. I sat down on a wet afternoon and watched the DVD, and found it reasonably amusing. It is, of course, wildly historically inaccurate, but so was the Philippa Gregory book it was based on, so you can't be too hard on the film-makers for that. What it does lack are the book's strengths, which include tight plotting, good construction, and a clever manipulation of point-of-view throughout. When you read the novel, you see familiar events through the point of view of a naive woman (Mary Boleyn) who does not know how things are going to turn out; right up to the end, you half-believe, with Mary, that things are going to work out all right. This creates a dramatic tension that is wholly lacking in the film version. In the film, the director underlines from the start that things are going to end badly for Anne. Well, we all know she ends up decapitated, but it would be nice to have a bit of suspense along the way.

The twist in Philippa Gregory's novel is that all the characters are absolutely as bad as their worst historical reputations. Her Anne is a guilty manipulative adulteress, a portrait which is unfair to the historical woman, if entertaining in a novel; here, the film-makers shy away from making her out to be as black as Gregory paints her (Henry VIII, on the other hand, emerges as a rapist, which for all his sins is one thing I don't think any historian has ever accused him of). Other characters are softened too, notably Lady Elizabeth Boleyn, the girls' mother, and the self-seeking George Boleyn, who here is just a nice boy whose parents force him to marry a girl he doesn't like. Nor is the court the sink of iniquity it seems in the book. It is extremely annoying that Mary's first husband, William Carey simply disappears (she was actually widowed, but we are never told so), while her romance with her second husband--a marriage that is social suicide, but which is ultimately her salvation--barely gets off the ground. There is no sense of love or even affection developing between them, which weakens the story considerably. But clearly the big relationship here is the love-hate between the sisters, and any romance other than the struggle for the king's affections is purely secondary.

All in all, this is a pretty but forgettable film, with some nice costumes, a weak script, and some reasonably good acting from the female leads.",1216684800,,2541,4.695067264573991

3405181,1,B0017APPSE,"First off, let me say I am not a fan of Philippa Gregory, mainly due to her blatant disregard for history (although she claims to do extensive research for her novels, she uses no primary sources (first rule of historical research = use primary sources) and her secondary sources (which from reading the book, she appears to have only skimmed over) are often outdated or don't stand up to the test of time).  I watched the movie mainly to see the costumes (I'm a Tudor period fanatic) and to see if it would be better or worse than the book.

The Tudor period is a fascinating time, and it doesn't need to be changed or altered in order to make it more interesting.  There's plenty of love, sex, betrayal, political scheming, etc. so I'm not sure why PG felt the need to completely alter the story so much.

I won't go into all of the historical inaccuracies here, if I did, I would be here all night.  Besides, there are many other amazon reviewers who are better-spoken than me and have far more knowledge of the Tudor period than I do (I'm only a student), and they have written some wonderful reviews pointing out errors (head on over to the TOBG book page, or check out forums on IMDB).

My main problem with this movie was that it seemed much more like a TV Movie (Lifetime channel anybody?) than a Hollywood film with well-known, highly-paid actors and actresses.  The Henry/Mary relationship was almost non-existent, they have a few sex scenes, but nothing to show that they might have actually cared for one another.  Henry and Mary have TWO very short conversations before they sleep together.  And this is supposed to be our heroine, who has fallen in love?  This is preposterous even to romance novel readers.  There is no character development or relationship development between the beginning of Henry and Mary's affair and Mary conceiving.  So when Anne comes back and ""steals"" Henry away from Mary while she is pregnant, do we really feel that bad for Mary?  Not really, since we haven't seen anything to show us that Mary is in love (at least in the novel there was an actual emotional relationship, one-dimensional as it was).

The one main thing that *really* put me off of this film was the rape scene with Henry and Anne.  Henry certainly was not a wonderful guy, history has clearly shown us this, but is this scene necessary?  As far as history goes, Anne held off Henry for many years, so a rape is very unlikely (not to mention she wasn't pregnant when she and Henry married secretly (winter 1532, second ceremony in London January 1533, Elizabeth born Sept 1533)).  I'm not really sure if this scene is here to show us that ""you'll get what's coming to you"" if you act like a shrew, or if it's supposed to make us feel a hint of sympathy for Anne.  Yes Henry and Anne's relationship (obviously) fell apart, but it fell apart over a period of years, not months.  *SPOILER ALERT* Also, the ending with Mary storming into the castle and grabbing Elizabeth from her caretakers and walking out with her seems pretty preposterous.  Henry had gotten rid of Anne, but he still did show regard for his children and made sure they were properly raised.  Snatching Elizabeth, especially after the king has warned you he will not tolerate you, your pleas to him, or your family anymore, seems like asking for some major punishment to me. *END SPOILER*

Strangely enough, considering that Ms. Gregory considers herself a ""feminist author,"" the only characters remotely resembling anything feminist was the Boleyn mother, Elizabeth, who encourages her daughters to be well-educated and shows her objection to the Boleyn-Howard males pimping out their daughters for political gain (gains which usually fell to the males), and Katherine of Aragon, who acts honorably and respectably at all times.  I don't think these are the characters we are meant to admire, but Anne is made out to be a self-serving, conniving shrew and Mary is too meek and mousy to be likeable.

One major (non-historical) error:  Mary is married to William Carey, but midway through the film William Stafford asks her to marry him and leave court with him.  Um, what happened to Mary's husband (He died of the sweating sickness, but the film never shows this)?

I was hoping for some great costumes from this film, and I was very disappointed.  The fabrics were very modern (some of them looked like 1970s curtains) and seemed very out of place.  Natalie Portman basically wore the same version of a dress, just in different colored fabrics, through the majority of the film  (same for Scarlett).  Tudor fashion is amazing; the costume designers could have shown so much more variety with the costumes.  The accents of Natalie Portman and Scarlett Johansson were incredibly bad.  Portman's accent seems to have gotten worse from when she did V for Vendetta.  Also, at times certain scenes were so dark that I had to readjust the settings on my screen (which I've never had a problem with).

The one positive thing about the film is that they chose to leave out the incest plot-line that was very strongly suggested in the book.",1216252800,,5110,4.722660653889515
3405182,4,B0017APPSE,"I just finished watching this film based on Phillipa Gregory's best selling novel by the same name.  Some of the words that come to mind are dark, brooding, tragic...beautiful.  The movie is decidely more heavy than I would have expected but beautifully filmed and for the most part well acted.  I found Natalie Portman not quite up to the roll as Ann.  As a scheming, ambitious woman, she just lacked substance.  This character definitely calls for a more well rounded and experienced actress.  On the other hand Scarlett Johanson does an incredible job as Mary, the second daughter.  Believable and rich in ways Natalie Portman could never be, she plays the betrayed sister, victimized by her family perfectly.  I too wish there was more from Henry in this film, but true to Phillipa Gregory, he is always in the background as an important but secondary character.
This is really a story of family, about two sisters and their love for each other, even when not deserved.  About betrayal and runaway ambition.  In the end, it passed my test for period films, it was entertaining, and I had a sense of the time.  No, it may not be entirely historically accurate, but who cares?",1216080000,,1178,4.753694581280788

In this unemotional, historical drama, director Justin Chadwick and screenwriter Peter Morgan miss the mark not because of poor acting or directing, but because the writing is anachronistic and stale.

Once again, Natalie Portman, Scarlett Johansson and Eric Bana deliver as actors, but there is not enough substance in the script for them to rectify the film.

The dilemma of the film is given early on - King Henry's wife cannot conceive children anymore.  The solution - The Boleyn whores!

The love triangle that the film creates is on par with lifetime movies.  There is no purpose/no good reason to feel any empathy for any of the characters.  The characters are all robots - doing what they are told to do mindlessly for the aristocracy.

The strength of the film is the cinematography, but the weaknesses of anachronisms and continuity are too much (or too little?) to make up for impressive cinematography.

Ultamately, the film fails because the characters are lifeless and the pacing is unsure of itself.  I'm not sure how the film makers went about making this film without constantly asking themselves, ""what is the purpose here?""",1215993600,,1218,4.955665024630542

The acting is pretty good, although the dialogue is a big stuffy (though Natalie Portman certainly has plenty of experience delivering awkward dialogue from chewing her way through the various klunky Star Wars movies). I thought her portrayal of Anne Boleyn was good -- in fact, better than the story could carry.

This takes one of the most exciting and perilous chapters of the long and gory Tudor story and turns it ... dull. There just isn't any getting around it. They just make it dry. The perspective of Mary Boleyn would have been more interesting if they'd given Scarlet Johannson anything to do except go around looking like a sad puppy and acting like a doormat. The whole ""twist"" with George Boleyn, frankly, was not believable. The potential of Jane Parker Boleyn, so cornerstone to the books, was thrown into cameo status.

I watched this while doing some complicated work, and I was glad to have something interesting to do while I was letting this grind to its predictable and messy finish. One can say that any drama based on history is, by its very nature, predictable, but you're almost waiting for them to get on with the executions so you can roll the credits and move on.

In the film, King Henry VIII (Eric Bana) is desperate for a male heir, which his current wife, Katherine of Aragon (Ana Torent) has failed to bear.

I rented it from our local video store only because it was one of the few blu-ray titles still on the shelf, and because I wanted to see the great costume and set designs in hi-def. In fact, I was mesmerised by this movie from first frame to last. Everything about it--plot, character development, cinematography and music--was top-drawer. Easily, I would have nominated this film as a top contender for Best Film of the Year.

Particularly noteworthy were the characters, in both a lead and supporting role. Although a movie's limited time space cannot create well-rounded development, each of these characters came across as strong and unique; clearly each had his or her agenda, mixing fear, betrayal, rage and ambition as they interacted with one another and the circumstances they found themeselves in. Of course, this could not have been possible without great acting and plot development, and so credit has to be given to the writing and casting crew. In the fifty years that I've been studying film seriously, I can't remember the last movie that had such strong characterization.

So why is my review so much higher than most others? Honestly, I think it's because today's movie audience wouldn't know a good film if it bit them where the sun doesn't shine. Our society pushes people to go faster and faster to go exactly nowhere. We want action to blast our senses five seconds after we sit in our seat, and as such have no patience to allow quality movies to develop. You may note that the movie industry no longer makes classic films such as 'Lawrence of Arabia', 'Doctor Zhivago' or 'Ben-Hur'.

If you're one of those rare individuals who appreciates great drama, this is the movie for you. On the other hand, if you have the attention span of a house fly, with half the intellect, you might be better off drooling over '30 Days of Night'.",1215216000,,1997,4.765895953757226
3405199,3,B0017APPSE,"Luxuriously done and highly entertaining are some of the plus of this historical melodrama that recreates - once again - the tormented relation among Henry VIII and three of his wives. As a precedent, this film has the Alexander Korda's classic THE PRIVATE LIFE OF HENRY VIII with Charles Laughton (1933), Charles Jarrott's ANNE OF THE THOUSAND DAYS (1969) and the ridiculous miniseries THE TUDORS (2007). However, the most direct relation with a previous film comes from a good 2003 T.V movie of the same name, based on the same Philippa Gregory's novel, and with Jodhi May (Anne), Natascha McElhone (Mary) and Jared Harris (Henry VIII), directed by Philippa Lawthorpe. Thus, this 2008 version is, actually, a big-screen remake from the 2003 TV timepiece.
This new approach to Anne Boleyn and Henry VIII stands with dignity and becomes quite watchable. Natalie Portman is excellent in portraying Anne, as well as Scarlett Johansson in the role of Mary. However, Eric Bana - although a fine actor - is somehow miscasted as the King: he's far from giving even a physical approach to the character (to make this king appear as a sexy, good-looking character is a huge historical mistake), and his acting is not as good as the ones we've seen him (BLACK HAWK DOWN, TROY, MUNICH). The art direction is first rate, as well as the costumes, music and photography. It's a very entertaining timepiece, no matter the historical inaccuracies contained.

If you'd search out books by writers who know what they are doing, you would never again waste a nanosecond on pulp writers of Ms. Gregory's ilk. Both the book and the movie are historically inaccurate, absurdly ineffective as entertainment and all-over criminal blasts of hot air. What REALLY happened to Anne Boleyn and the people around her was a thousand times more riveting, sexy, tragic and dramatic than anything presented here. One typical example: when she met Henry, Mary Boleyn was NOT an innocent young bride. She and Anne had both spent years at the French court, where Mary (who was the elder of the two sisters) was so notorious a round-heels that contemporary writers were moved to mention it. And this corrects only one of the dozens of imbecilic falsehoods perpetrated by Ms. Gregory.

For an infinitely better read, check out ""Brief Gaudy Hour"" by Margaret Campbell Barnes, ""The Concubine"" by Norah Lofts, or even some of Jean Plaidy's less thrilling but serviceable Tudor titles.

3405204,3,B0017APPSE,"As others have said, this film is pitiful in most respects. I watched it on a recent flight just to see how Scarlett Johanson and Natalie Portman would work in their respective roles, because they both seemed cast because they had the right hair color. Scarlett has the 'sex bomb' persona, Natalie always seems so much colder.

In the end, Scarlett's portrayal of Mary touched me, though historically it cannot be anywhere near the truth. Mary would never have been allowed near the king before Anne's execution (the whole family were fleeing in every direction imaginable to prevent them from being caught up in the king's anger), there's no evidence the king gave her a promise for Anne's life, etc etc.

A final thought: a number of reviewers mention how willing the Boleyn/Howard family was to sacrifice the two sisters. In fact, all three siblings (brother George included) were sacrificed. He, too, was executed - for supposed incest with Anne. Mary is the only one who survives the fiasco, to live a quiet and happy life with second husband Stafford.

The acting was excellent, especially by Portman. The sets, costumes, and cinematography were lush. No shortcuts were taken, and the production quality of this movie is superb. If there was a weak link in the acting, it was Bana. On the other hand, he was playing a banal and shallow person, so perhaps that is why he seemed to fade into the background when paired against the strong personalities of the female characters. This is one of the few movies that my wife and I wanted to see over again immediately after finishing our first viewing. Please read the excellent review by ""Jem"" to get a better understanding of the entertainment value this movie has in store for you. If you haven't rented it yet, you really should.

That's what I felt like doing when I got to the ending of this movie, perhaps the most absurd ending I've ever seen. It's a real shame. I've been reading everything I can about the Tudors (Anne especially) for about 10 years and of course, I read the book. While the book is very inaccurate and is pretty unfair to Anne, it's an overall enjoyable read. Despite the heavy material the book covered, there was still a light, fluffy, romantic feeling to it. The movie was shot dark and dreary, losing a great deal of the entertainment value of the book. There was ZERO character and romantic development in this film. The actors couldn't seem to decide whether or not to do English accents. The production felt comparable to a TV movie. I think the only thing anyone really worked on for this film was the costume design. I've seen lots of period pieces but these costumes were absolutely stunning. But the whole movie felt like it was slapped together. It just jumped from time period to time period leaving out major events and people. (WHERE'S WOLSEY???!!) It was even more inaccurate than the book. It was almost like the screenwriters just decided to rewrite history.

However the whole ""Anne slept with her brother George"" was the plot point that had me putting the DVD back in the Netflix envelope.

3405209,3,B0017APPSE,"I would not study history of England based on 'The other Boleyn girl (2008) but I enjoyed it and found it quite entertaining. Boleyn girls, two sisters, Anne (Natalie Portman) and Mary (Scarlett Johansson,) were gorgeous and Henry VIII (Eric Bana) long before he looked like on his famous portraits by Hans Holbein, Jr, the object of both sisters' desires was very appealing.  Kristin Scott Thomas played Lady Boleyn, Anne's and Mary Boleyn's mother. Scott Thomas has so much class and dignity about her, and I like her in every movie I've seen her.

I actually did not know that Mary Boleyn, the older Anne's sister (in the movie she was younger), had been Henry VIII's mistress and might have (or not) had a son with him. According to the movie and the novel by Philippa Gregory it was based on, Mary had a son with Henry who then fell in love with sharp-witted, alluring, and unavailable Anne who firmly refused to become the king's mistress. So great was his desire for her, it led to Henry's annulment of the 20+ years marriage with the queen Katharine of Aragon and split with Catholic Church thus starting the Church of England. Katharine of Aragon comes as a decent and intelligent woman  played by Ana Torrent. Now, that's the most pleasant surprise of the movie. Eight-year-old Ana Torrent gave an unforgettable performance as ""Ana"" in the film El espritu de la colmena (The Spirit of the Beehive) by Vctor Erice. She was memorable in the relatively small role in Justin Chadwick's historical drama comparing to Portman or Johansson.

Anne Boleyn was a remarkable and bright woman, (bitch as she was, quick-tempered and spirited) and it is  clear that her daughter Elizabeth, the future greatest Monarch in the England's history, Good Queen Beth inherited strength, iron will, brilliance,  and brain from her mother. The fact that Elizabeth did not want to get married only speaks in her behalf - she was smart enough not to let any man to tell her what to do and to dominate her. Her mother Anne was not that lucky. The second part of the movie, the fall of Anne Boleyn, ""Anne of Thousand Days"" was rushed, sensational, and much weaker than the promising beginning. Since those historic figures had been dead for almost 500 years, it is easy to come up with any shocking accusation toward them - they won't defend themselves. Anyway, the costumes and the sets were the feast for eyes, I was not bored and after the movie was over, I spent some time researching on the web the key players of the real life drama that was set in the beginning of 1500s, changed the future of Europe, and included love, lust, ambitions that would destroy the family ties, rise to power, and deadly fall from it.

3405211,2,B0017APPSE,"This is a re-review of this movie. I reread The Other Boleyn Girl and I decided to give this movie another chance. But I was able to get it for free this time rather than paying for it.

Upon watching it again I'm still not completely sold on it. It's only moved up to three star for me from the original two. I'll say why.

It's only loosely based on the book and history. Instead it more focuses on the rivalry between the sisters over the history that was really all important in that day and age. But I still felt that Mary was missing in a lot of the film, as was George, who was so instrumental in the book.

Natalie Portman's Anne grew on me in the second viewing, but I still prefer Natalie Dormer's Anne.

I'm still horrified that the director had Henry rape Anne. That was totally and completely unnecessary. This man was in love with this woman and I highly doubt he would have done so. That was truly a shame.

I also still feel that this movie was rushed in the end. You went from seeing Anne on top to a steep descent to the bottom. And sure, it was quick, but this movie add G's to it.

And again Katherine of Aragon should have been given a larger part in this film. Ana Torrent(?) I believe would have been phenomenal in this role had she been given a larger part.

The costumes and the sets were amazing though. The colour is real and you almost want to touch. It's like visual eye candy. That's a real redeeming quality to this film.

3405215,4,B0017APPSE,"The King of England (Eric Bana) has had bad fortune - his wife has miscarried a male baby and left an absence where an heir should be.  With the need of succession, the King soon tires of his queen, and it becomes rumored that he may desire a mistress who can conceive a baby boy.  In walks royal sycophant Thomas Howard (David Morrissey), a power-hungry family tyrant who just happens to have two gorgeous, young nieces and ambitions of pseudo-royalty.

In a matter of no time, Howard convinces Sir Thomas Boleyn (Mark Rylance) to pimp one of his daughters.  Together they choose the precocious Anne (Natalie Portman) to seduce the King, mainly because she's the daughter who is not married, during a stay at the Boleyn family home.  Their plan for Anne to whore herself in anticipation of royal favor, much like giving away livestock, soon fails as Anne leads a group of men - along with the King - on a hunt gone awry, producing an injured King and a family decision to let the other daughter Mary (Scarlett Johansson) nurse the monarch back to health.  With his pride and dormant libido revived by Mary, the King soon gives her a job at the castle; and along with the job for her husband, the way is paved for a marriage dissolved and an illegitimate child to be born.  Anne quickly feels slighted, and a sibling rivalry ensues.

Subertfuge, betrayal, secrets, and a royal-political chess game on the grandest of stages soon leads to an intense story in which ""the other Boleyn girl"" soon becomes a phrase that defines this movie's struggle, where the difference between being revered and beheaded is only a single moment or decision away, and where sisters engage in a sibling version of Desperate Housewives proportions while destroying the country.

A very dark, twisted storyline mixes perfectly with the bright, vibrant, incredible cinematography and costume design that vividly highlights the romantic flair and scenery during that period, as well as the battles often associated with the ascent to royal supremacy.  While this adaptation may have historical inaccuracies, the surprise twists to the well known ending and the pairing of two of Hollywood's most beautiful starlets makes a worthwhile, entertaining movie.",1214006400,,2229,4.935828877005347

3405218,1,B0017APPSE,"Anyone who's seen the magnificent film ""Elizabeth"" starring Cate Blanchette, and Showtime's authentically created, well-acted, and well-directed, ""The Tudors"" ((both of which were written by the talented Michael Hirst) will be in for deep disappointment with this film.

Having read Philippi Gregory's tantalizing book ""The Other Boleyn Girl,"" which this film was based upon, I was looking forward to the film until I heard Natalie Portman was cast as Anne Boleyn.  I knew then the film was in trouble, not that Portman is a bad actress, just seriously miscast as the fiery, sly, manipulating, and conniving Anne.  Anyone who's seen Showtime's ""The Tudors"" with the very fine acting of Natalie Dormer as Anne will know what I'm talking about.

Eric Bana who is usually a good strong actor, was surprisingly one dimensional and flat with the exception of the love scenes with Scarlett Johansson, which were although brief, quite alluring. Bana didn't begin to pull off the emotional turmoil and layers of obsession that Jonathan Rhys Meyers as Henry VIII does so wonderfully in ""The Tudor's, and Bana and Portman had zero chemistry.  You can say pretty much the same for Katherine, Queen of Aragon as Henry's long suffering wife (except of course, for the love scenes with Scarlett Johansson, which could have been more interesting than this entire film). Once again, ""The Tudors"" excels with Maria Doyle Kennedy cast as Katherine, Queen of Aragon, who is riveting. The casting agents for ""The Tudors"" and as well as for ""Elizabeth"" have a rare talent indeed.

Scarlett Johansson performance, although somewhat on the understated side, was the only actor who felt believable in this film, and Kristin Scott Thomas, if given a more beefy part, probably would have stood out as well.

With a few exceptions, for the most part the costumes and scenery were also mediocre, lacking the exquisite richness and sublime beauty that dominated in ""Elizabeth"", and to some overall extent ""The Tudors"".  The era may have not had good lighting, but they made up for it in the beauty and reflective glow of candlelight, the depth of colors, the contrast of  light and dark, and an overall mystery to their environments.

All in all, I found the film to be flat, poorly directed and poorly cast all around, and felt bad for Philippi Gregory, who wrote such a fine book.",1213833600,,2353,4.979591836734694
3405219,2,B0017APPSE,"I read the Philippa Gregory novel years ago, and even though I wasn't that into the Tudor history at the time, I enjoyed the author's take on the Boleyn sisters very much.  So, having read and enjoyed the aforementioned novel, I couldn't wait to watch the DVD.  I won't go into plot details, for most people here have read the book and I'll spare you another synopsis.  However, if you haven't read the book, then you'll probably be either disappointed with the somewhat soap opera-ish plot or be kind of lost when you get watch this film.

First of all, the costumes and period feel look very authentic and beautiful.  Unlike the Showtime TV series The Tudors, which seems to show a version of the sixteenth century fashion and mores that fit to their liking rather than mirroring reality, this film focuses on how things were really like in those times.  (To the costume designers of The Tudors -- women in those times wore headdresses ALL THE TIME!  They were considered harlots if they did not.)  Other than that, however, I found the film rushed and the story very soap opera-like, depicting Anne Boleyn (Natalie Portman) as both a petty and jealous sister and a victim in her desperate attempts to have Henry VIII's heir.  Portman did a terrific job though.  The accent is okay and her performance is wonderful.  I am less impressed with Scarlett Johansen, who seems more concerned with looking pouty and pretty than putting on a convincing performance.  I also didn't buy into the fact that Mary fell in love with Henry in such little time and with nothing but sex and a few conversations in common.  I had that problem with the novel, and I had it with the film as well, but somehow this problem is more glaring in the film, seems everything is very much glossed over.  The actors who play Henry VIII, Jane Boleyn, the Duke of Norfolk, Katherine of Aragon, etc., get very little airtime and are cardboard cutout characters at best.  Needless to say, I am disappointed with the film.  Gregory is a wonderful writer of historical novels.  I recently read The Boleyn Inheritance and loved it.  The filmmakers should have done more than just make this film look pretty.",1213833600,,2173,4.673684210526316

3405221,3,B0017APPSE,"The film adaptation of Philippa Gregory's novel ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" left something to be desired. I can list dozens of things wrong with it, but I'll go with the ones that stick out the most.  Anne Boleyn was not shipped off to France as a punishment for secretly marrying a pre-contracted Henry Percy; her father Sir Thomas Boleyn had brought her back from the French Court several years before she ever met Percy, and she was banished to Hever Castle for her indiscretion.  Mary Boleyn is portrayed in the film as a wuss, while in the book she could breathe fire as readily as Anne could.  She's also depicted as having had only the one child with Henry VIII when she had both a girl and a boy with him.  Mary's first husband, William Carey, disappears roughly half-way through the movie, leaving the impression that he went to European and never came back.  The truth is that he died in 1528 from the dreaded sweating sickness, freeing Mary to later wed William Stafford, her second husband.  Henry VIII forcing himself sexually on Anne Boleyn is fictitious; he may have been many things, but a rapist wasn't one of them.  Anne didn't shake or cry at her execution, but went to her death bravely and composedly.  Mary Boleyn Stafford permanently left the Tudor Court with her children and her second husband to live the rest of her life in the country, but she didn't take Elizabeth with her.  The child lived away from the Court in near poverty with a governess and skeleton staff until Jane Seymour, Henry VIII's third wife, persuaded him to bring both Elizabeth and his older daughter Mary back to Court.

Now for the performances.  Natalie Portman does a creditable job as Anne Boleyn.  Scarlett Johansson's portrayal of Mary Boleyn is so bland that it's nearly colorless.  Jim Sturgess is quite good as their brother George Boleyn, while David Morrisey, Kristin Scott Thomas, and Mark Rylance (who last Sunday night won a Tony Award for his performance in the play ""Boeing-Boeing"") give solid support as the Duke of Norfolk, Lady Elizabeth Boleyn, and Sir Thomas Boleyn.  Eric Bana is acceptable as a young, virile Henry VIII.

In this case Philippa Gregory's Boleyn books provided just the right mix of history and speculation to make for an indulgent read. The movie however was exhaustingly boring. I could hardly wait for Anne to be without head. I find Natalie Portman generally a pleasure to watch. In this role she was simply silly, unbelievable both as a tricky temptress and/or a victim. The larger casting error here was Scarlett Johansson.  She is unconvincing at best in this period piece. I suspect as with her singing, if the audience cannot be distracted by her breasts her lack of talent really shines through. This movie was visually attractive with out be screaming big budget.

3405224,3,B0017APPSE,"Philippa Gregory's novel, of the same name, is one of my top ten reads of all time.  Yes, the story was about the Boleyn Girl's, but there was so much more than the movie had to offer. The in-depth political intrigue, skulduggery, deadly betrayals and debauchery were vividly depicted. You became totally enmeshed in the 16th Century, Tudor atmosphere. It also made you realize that if there were ever a time-machine, it would not be a Century you'd like to visit...particularly as a woman.

It became clear that the only thing separating women from chattel, was their momentary status, which they manipulated to elevate, their attire and whether or not they were being served, or the servant.  Either position was not enviable. In the DVD Featurette, Gregory described the 16th Century as possibly the worst time to be a woman...""they were simply beasts of burden.""

The film was visually splendid!  The set, the costumes...everything was a feast for the eyes.  However, the story itself, represented only a small portion of the book.  The Producer decided to focus only on the relationship between Anne and Mary as they vied for the King's attention and the drastic steps they would take, at the behest of their ambitious family. The battle ensued, as they both began lusting for the Queen's chair. With Anne, it became a game of control and power, for Mary it may have been one of devotion. But, from either viewpoint, it was a disaster waiting to happen.

Natalie Portman, best portrayed the fiery Anne. Johansson's role as Mary was not one of her best. She had very little change in affect throughout the entire movie.  Her beauty couldn't save her in this one. Bana was an excellent King Henry, depicted in his youth, when he was virile and strong...long before the paunch. Katherine of Aragorn (Kristen Scott Thomas) tugged at your heartstrings, as she has in all historical documents of that time. Hers was the ultimate betrayal, as she was so loved by the Court, only to be outcast for not producing a male heir.  But the impact on England's religious/political histories, remains today, making her one of the most integral characters of the King's Court, an area that should have been given more depth.

If you haven't read the book, or studied the 16th Century, you might be a little lost with this film.  I would suggest that you watch the Biographies and Featurettes at the end of the DVD, as they will fill in some of the holes left in the movie.

I wish the movie could have been more in keeping with the book, but realize that it would have required a movie of epic proportion, that would have probably been cost prohibitive and perhaps too long, in order to capture it all.

I'd recommend seeing it once, but suspect many won't want to add it to their keeper shelf for repeated viewing.  If you haven't read the book, I strongly recommend it, though. It IS on my keeper shelf.",1213660800,,2893,4.712301587301587

Yes, the costumes were outstanding, I even think that the actor who portrayed Henry did a fairly decent job (and a very good looking younger Henry he made, too).  I do not really care for Natalie or Scarlet in particular, but they didn't do all that bad of a job, considering the script they had to work with.  I love all things Tudor, so I was disappointed, again, to find that known truths were toyed with and manipulated.  Mary did not take Elizabeth (a very young Elizabeth, actually...I believe Elizabeth would have been a bit older when her mother was beheaded, maybe 3ish?) from court and raise her with her children as was implied in the end of the film...perhaps she visited from time to time, but she was not whisked away by her Aunt. She had her own household, and was away from court much of the time during her younger years.  I also do not believe that Henry forced himself on Ann, I have read many books on both Henry and his family and I do not recall ever reading any such thing.  I believe he was frustrated with her and may have been angry at feeling manipulated, and also I believe that they did eventually have relations before their marriage, but he didn't rape her.  However, I can say something positive...they did a great job with the sex scenes...barely any skin shown and the ""rape"" scene was a mild as you can get.  The rape scene in Rob Roy is far more graphic and upsetting.  Kudos for handling these scenes with some class.  But, all in all, only three stars because I dislike when people twist and turn facts to suit their needs.  Things happened as they happened, and I'm not sure if Henry were able to attend the opening of The Other Boleyn Girl, that he would have been pleased at the final product.

3405227,2,B0017APPSE,"This is my first review on Amazon. Becuase I found this movie to be a complete disspointment is why I decided to write a review. My review is based soley off of this movie as based off of the original book and not historical accuracy. When this movie first came out in the theatres I was excited to see it becuase I had heard that the book was excellent. Becuase I am one of those people that absolutely must read the book before the movie I read the book just a few months ago knowing that the DVD was going to come out. I found all 661 pages of the book to be very engaging and entertaining. Although the characters were all 'grown up' from the beginning of book, the author established the characters throughtout the events and timeline of the book. You knew who the characters were and what their qualities and behavior were like. This movie did not establish these characters at all nor establish the relationship each sibling, George, Anne and Mary had with one another. I also was dissappointed in the script for Henry. I thought Bana did the best he could with what was given to him which was a lot of fancy costumes and not enough dialogue. However, and I must mention this, in the book, Henry did not rape Anne. I'm not sure why they put that in the movie. There were many mini-plots throughout the book that weren't even touched in the movie at all. According to the book, Mary's first child was Catherine, not Henry. Furhtermore, Anne was absolutely horrible to her sister Mary in the book. Maybe one thing the movie maybe sort of got right was that dispite how horrible Anne was to her sister, Mary was always loyal to her.

The whole storyline is wrong, let's just start with that.  I know that there was a time when people thought like that (give my daughter to so-and-so and hope that it'll help me climb the social ladder), but why would we want to promote this type of behavior and make it have some sort of appeal to it?  I think that the acting was amazing and the costumes were excellent, but that is all I have good to say about the film.  And when did it become alright to have a rape in a PG-13 movie?!  Someone please answer that for me!!  I rented this film because, yes, I was intrigued by the story, but usually when there is something like rape in a film, it is usually mentioned in the tiny box that explains why the film is rated what it is.  You will not find the word ""rape"" anywhere on that box, not even ""strong sexuallity,"" just sexuality.  When the film was over, I was scratching my head over several things: why did Henry go back on his word and execute Anne anyway and not even have the guts to explain it in person to Mary?  Why did the makers of this film try to leave you feeling sorry for Anne when Mary was the one who suffered in every way imaginable and then return to stand by her sister?  Why do we want to watch these things, but then we never want to mention in public that we did watch it?  And finally, why do we watch things like this, and when we go to write reviews about them on the internet, we never mention the disgusting and nauseating rape or rapes that we see in them?  All I can say now is that I am in desperate need of a shower with a lot of soap, and it's not because I played in mud.  (Spiritual mud, maybe.)",1213488000,,1785,4.036931818181818

3405230,1,B0017APPSE,"""The Other Boleyn Girl"" is simply a bad film, not because of historical inaccuracies (what historical drama DOESN'T play with the facts?) but because it suffers from a terrible script, some unfortunate casting and an assumption that every viewer is already a scholar who doesn't need further instruction on why what's happening on the screen is happening. It is also just not very entertaining.

The film is an adaptation of a Philippa Gregory bestseller of the same name that takes a look at the classic story of how King Henry VIII of England fell in love out of marriage with the notorious Anne Boleyn and began an affair that marked England's break from the Papal power that ruled Europe. But that film doesn't really look at that story, it is instead a retread into typical teenage melodrama, and a tame one at that with a PG-13 rating.

To be fair, ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" boasts some excellent production values. The costumes are stunning and the cinematography is very lush and beautiful. But direcetor Justin Chadwick's finished product is a stale, boring take on a fascinating tale. Characters are never fully developed or explained, we never really get to know King Henry (Eric Bana) or understand the world he lives in. The plot revolving on why the Boleyn sisters (Natalie Portman and Scarlett Johansson) are enticed to seduce the King is never fully explained, in fact, we don't ever truly understand what interests their male family masters have in injecting them into the King's court,all we hear is ""it will be of great benefit to our family,"" and that's it. The world of these people is never established. Consider the fact that Henry's marriage to Anne sparked a major uproar which resulted in the establishment of the Church Of England. This is completely skipped over, you never even know that the Catholic church had an iron grip on society before Henry meets Anne or afterwards. Instead the movie lingers on uninteresting, cliche scenes where characters hush adolescent passions to each-other in darkened halls, or shots of Portman and Johansson looking at each-other with girlish jealousy.

The casting is also a bit off. Bana is good as Henry, but he is never allowed to inhabit the screen or conquer a scene, instead he is reduced to short, soap operish dialogue. Portman is wrong as Boleyn, she plays what should be a dark, seductive character more as some sort of confused, innocent teenager. Her performances feels out of place with the role, but then again her character is never defined. The same goes for Johansson's Mary Boleyn who after the second half, is reduced to just a walk-in who is apparently just meant to stand there looking teary-eyed at the camera.

Some have complained about dramatic license the film takes with history, when it comes to film it's pointless, the best period films, from ""A Man For All Seasons"" to ""Elizabeth"" have taken liberties with history. If you want the hard facts go READ, the faults of this film all lie in the bad writing and the obvious fact that the film suffers from a marketing ploy: People were more concerned with having Bana, Portman and Johansson all on the same screen. Too bad nobody bothered to give them a decent movie to participate in.",1213315200,,3223,4.833333333333333

3405232,4,B0017APPSE,"I won't comment on historical inaccuracies here since I am not that familiar with them, especially in regard to Henry and the Boleyn family.
This film is very entertaining to watch and it is visually pleasing, with the period costumes, castles, and other trappings of the century represented.  Portman, Johannsen and Bana do good solid work as the main characters in the royal intrigues.  The film also gives a good example of the low status of women at that time and how they were expected to produce male heirs or else fall into disgrace and be abandoned by their domineering husbands.
  There was a tremendous amount of pressure placed on young women not only in that regard but also re: their entire family's position and future.  Girls were married off not to men they loved, necessarily, but to men who could provide wealth and reputation or even repair broken relationships or warring empires.
  The ending was spot-on in showing that Henry's desire for a son and his despair at not having one should not have been such a worry for him, considering that he and Anne produced Queen Elizabeth I, who ruled England for decades.",1213315200,,1131,4.769230769230769

The mother is something of a feminist and stands up for her children rather than plays a submissive woman. It is one thing to have so many historical inaccuracies but to have so many inaccuracies that relate to the novel as well is just ridiculous. Why make the crappy movie at all?

The costumes are beautiful. The Americans trying to mingle with the British is okay. I also think it a bit funny that Anne's necklace is the same one that can sometimes be seen worn by America Ferrera's character on Ugly Betty. I'd rather watch Ugly Betty anyway.",1213228800,,691,4.390625
3405240,4,B0017APPSE,"If you're gonna watch this and enjoy it at all you have to know what you're getting into. I loved the book version but even that is a sensationalized version of historical events.

This movie is NOT by any means meant to be a serious portrayal of what happened between Henry VIII and the Boleyn family. It IS a very entertaining interpretation of what might have happened given the very spotty records we have from the time.

Sets and costumes are gorgeous, characters are written to be larger than life and the dialogue made me go ""Oh, snap!"" more than once in the theater. Acting is fine, Portman may have overplayed a little but she *is* portraying freakin' Anne Boleyn. Johannson makes Mary Boleyn a very sympathetic character, the heart of the movie. If anyone falls flat it's Bana who makes Henry VIII seem like a dunderhead totally being played by the ambitious families pushing their daughters into his bed to win influence.

Honorable mention to Ana Torent playing the role of Queen Katharine, who is forced to take both Boleyn girls into her service just so Henry can have access to them. Awk-ward!

Finally, if you like the movie at all, check out the book. The book is ALWAYS better ;) Part of the reason plotlines seem a bit tangled and incomplete in the movie is because there is so much detail involved and only 2 hours to cram it into.",1213228800,,1351,4.570247933884297

The historical truth of Henry VIII, Anne and Mary is much more compelling and fascinating than this tripe. If you want to see a more factual adaptation, watch ""Anne of a Thousand Days"".

3405242,5,B0017APPSE,"After seeing this in the theatre, I was ready to give it 5 stars.  I love period movies, especially about the Tudors, and I really enjoyed this one.  However, after watching the deleted scenes on the DVD, I realized this movie should have been much better!

When I ordered the DVD, I had already resigned myself to little or no features.  Elizabeth, and Elizabeth: The Golden Age were sorely lacking.  Most period movies have few extras, despite having such a treasure trove of history to mine.  However, I was surprised and delighted with the excellent selection of special features on this DVD!  First, there are several deleted scenes, many of which should have been included in the film.  For the most part, they centered around Mary and gave more insight into her life with her husband after Anne supplants her, plus some calculating scenes with Anne.  One scene with Mary's husband upon seeing her ""bastard"" child of Henry was quite poignant.  All of these would have enriched the movie to be more than just two women in rivalry for a king.  It could have been 5 stars and would no doubt have pleased more people who saw the film.  Also included in the extras was a feature called ""To Be Lady"" about court etiquette and the precarious life of a woman, even noble, in those times.  It featured interviews with the author, some college history professors, and the cast/crew of the film.  Women were often exploited in that time to the benefit (or detriment) of their families.  And Mary and Anne were no exception.  Another excellent feature was about translating history to film.  They discussed the book vs  vs the movie, what they used of history, how the expanded on Mary's lesser known character.  I have not read the book this film is based on, and didn't feel any urge to do so after seeing the movie.  However, these two features and the interview with the author and cast have piqued my interest in the novel.  I definitely intend to read it now.

Many DVDs throw in biographies of the characters just to have another extra to list.  They are usually nothing more than frozen screen shots a viewer clicks through.  But, this DVD included bios of 5 principal characters which included interviews from the author, historians, the cast and crew, coupled with footage from the movie.  They were like mini-bios from A&E.  Very well done, and I would recommend first time viewers of the movie watch before the film as they really help to keep the characters straight (such as Mary's two husbands, William Carey and William Stafford who look enough alike with the same name that I sometimes confused them).  The DVD also includes a commentary, which I didn't listen too because I find them very boring.  Overall, a fantastic set of features on a single disc edition.

As to the film, I thought the costumes and sets were phenomenal, the story was very good and the casting spot on.  The cinematography is expertly done, and helps set the tone and tell the story as much as the script.  Some viewers have complained that Natalie Portman wasn't good as Anne Boleyn.  I've read a lot of history books and historical fiction on Anne and I thought she played the part true to the person (if not the book, which I can't comment on).  Anne Boleyn wasn't a raving beauty, she was striking.  Her major appeal came from denying Henry and being intelligent, ambitious, manipulative - in short, a match for him in many ways.  She intrigued him.  Portman brought all these qualities to light in her portrayal.  Scarlett Johansson actually exceeded my expectations.  I have only seen her in a couple movies, and the parts didn't require much effort.  However, I thought she embodied the somewhat nave and soft Mary, who is quickly disillusioned about the real world, and even her family.  The two women played against each other beautifully.  In one of the features, the director mentions how in the book it is often not clear which of them is ""the other"" Boleyn girl and that he uses this in the film.  He does, and it works to great effect.

Eric Bana as Henry is perhaps the weakest casting choice, but he wasn't bad by any stretch.  History bears out that Henry was young, handsome, charming and athletic until injured falling from a horse so Bana fit that fine.  Bana is best as the temperamental king who is at once attracted and disgusted by Anne's manipulation, and drawn to Mary's docile nature.  His interactions with other characters didn't really stand out, but the movie was focused on the women so this was fine.  Two other stand outs were Anna Torrent as Queen Katherine of Aragon and David Morrissey as the Duke of Norfolk.  Though her role was small, Torrent's Katherine made a big impact.  She commanded every scene she was in.  She was at once regal, and pitiable, as the victim of her husband's desperation for a male heir.  Morrissey played a consummate politician - calculating, controlling and just a bit sleazy.  Without him, it would be difficult to sympathize with either Anne or her family.  His ruthless game of chess, in which they are pawns was vital to the film. Yes, liberties are taken with historical fact, but some license must be given to film as its own art form just as for a historical fiction.  Not much is known about Mary Boleyn, but this film certainly stirs the imagination of what she may have been like.

Overall, I highly recommend this DVD!",1213228800,,5380,4.68409818569904

3405245,4,B0017APPSE,"""The Other Boleyn Girl,"" (2008), a historical costume drama/romance about the 16th century relationships of Anne and Mary, two sisters of the Boleyn family, and that notorious old Tudor bluebeard, King Henry VIII of England, arrived at these shores in spring.  It boasts a high-powered cast, and lovely location shooting.  It is based on the popular novel of the same name by Philippa Gregory,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Other-Boleyn-Girl/dp/B000W4FO1O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Other Boleyn Girl</a>, with screenplay by the currently hot Peter Morgan, directed by Justin Chadwick.

This period of English history is, of course, very essentially dramatic, therefore very popular, and often treated in literature, theater, and film.  The Cliffs Notes go: Henry is crazed with lust for Anne, who denies him; Queen Catherine (Aragon, of Spain), will not give him an excuse for an annulment or divorce; he therefore breaks with the Catholic religion, and anoints himself the head of the new Church of England, in order to be able to grant himself his intensely desired divorce to marry Anne.  But he rather quickly tires of Anne, and it's therefore ""Off with her Head,"" so that he can marry Jane Seymour, who will give him his fiercely desired male heir, while, unfortunately, dying in childbirth.  Jane will be followed by three more wives, with varying degrees of luck.  There was also, of course, many a mistress --including Anne's sister Mary --- can we now hear a chorus of ""It's good to be King??""

The excellent cast is headed by those two luscious young stars, Scarlett Johansson as Mary, Natalie Portman as Anne; both gorgeously gowned by Sandy Powell.  And these girls can act, though their English accents sometimes waver.  Eric Bana plays Henry Tudor.  Ana Torent holds the screen as Catherine of Spain, Henry's first wife.  Jim Sturgess makes his small part, as the tragic George Boleyn, heart-breaking.  Mark Rylance and David Morrissey are good as Sir Thomas Boleyn and Thomas Howard, Duke of Norfolk, the girls' scheming father and uncle, willing to use their own flesh and blood for advancement, as they threw both sisters at Henry, playing them off against each other. Kristin Scott Thomas turns in a towering performance as Lady Elizabeth Boleyn, who sees her children used and destroyed in pursuit of the family's ambitions.

Many have quibbled with the historical accuracy of this picture: among other things, it shows Mary as the younger sister, when she was the elder.  But I was a Renaissance History major, and studied this period, and the picture gets the general outlines right.  Human life was cheap, and that of women, be they ever so young, beautiful and blue-blooded, even cheaper.  The picture does not make it as clear as it could that the plot against Anne was orchestrated by Cromwell, her mortal enemy.  But it does show us that Anne's likely true love, Harry Percy, and her uncle the Duke of Norfolk, were forced by Henry to be on the jury that doomed her.

It goes beyond the scope of this movie, but the Howards, a rich, powerful, avaricious and ambitious family -- still-- evidently thought they had plenty of spare beautiful young girls with which to tempt Henry.  Later, they were to throw yet another niece, the pathetic young Catherine Howard, at the horny old monster Henry had become, as his fifth wife.  That marriage didn't end well for her, either.

""The Other Boleyn Girl"" is, of course, a chick flick, but it's lushly filmed, and completely engrossing, even to those who generally don't go for that genre. Boring, it ain't.",1213142400,,3613,5.098471986417657
3405246,4,B0017APPSE,"Professional and audience reviews of this movie have, for the most part, demonstrated a lack of knowledge and/or understanding of the Tudors, Henry VIII, and the Boleyn girls. The Tudors were probably the most conscious of the need to have a queen provide an heir in the centuries when the lack of one spelled the end of dynasties. Henry VIII in particular was desperate for a male heir, to the point that his queens were either divorced or beheaded for not providing one. He was the ultimate ""stud"", and had many mistresses, but the availablity of a young woman who combined beauty, sexuality, and the possibility of providing that heir was more than enough to cause the divorce of Katherine of Aragon, a break with Spain, and the invention of the Church of England, all of which was blamed on Anne Boleyn. She had more spirit than Mary, and there is nothing to contradict the fact that she held Henry at bay until he agreed to make her his queen. She didn't want to be cast aside like her sister, and he saw the chance for a son.
All this was accurately presented in the movie; Henry was not yet the obese Holbein portrait so Eric Bana was physically acceptable in the part. As to the girls, the portrayals were excellent, the accents more than adequate (my English friends had no problems), the differences between the personalities very well defined, and the acting of a very high standard. Contrary to what some reviewers have said, Natalie Portman seems to be incapable of being anything less than very good and is mostly superb, and as Anne she was excellent. Scarlett Johansen improves with every film. Producing a movie like this will never satisfy everyone because there is so much that could be included, but which must be left out because of time restrictions. For what it was intended to be, ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" is excellent and worth watching more than once.",1213142400,,1876,4.670694864048339

Ironically, that bonding is exactly what works against the movie, specifically the lack of a sharp edge in their characters' intractable relationship which dilutes how far sibling rivalry can go in shaping fates and destroying lives.

The overstuffed story begins with a cursory portrayal of the Boleyn sisters, headstrong Anne and diffident Mary. Even though Mary is married to wealthy courtier William Carey, the sisters soon find themselves in a competition for the affections of King Henry VIII, thanks to the machinations of their weak-willed father Thomas and their Machiavellian uncle, the Duke of Norfolk. Henry is initially drawn toward Mary's gentle nature, siring an illegitimate son as he is still married to the barren Catherine of Aragon. However, Mary's difficult pregnancy and mandatory bedrest opens an opportunity for Anne, who uses all her cunning wiles to land the King. At the expense of Mary's happiness, Anne succeeds but not before the creation of the Church of England and her own ascension to England's Queen. Meanwhile, Henry evolves from gregarious womanizer to haunted despot, and everyone already knows what becomes of Anne at the end. The film's perspective alternates between the sisters, thus reducing Henry to a convenient plot device. Thanks to the film's broad brush strokes, the challenge for the viewer is to monitor the imbalance between the sisters. For instance, Mary is rather bland in her virtue but her story is affecting, while Anne is comparatively intriguing in her blind ambition but her fate feels less than tragic.

I still think Johansson is the more natural temptress onscreen, but she actually plays Mary and manages to elicit sympathy to her character with surprising ease. However, Portman gets the lion's share of meaty scenes and runs with them, especially a couple of effective face-offs with Henry. As expected, both are alluring in period costume even as their accents waver a bit. As Henry, Eric Bana seems to have been hired for his brooding persona and beefcake appeal, while the character's lightning-fast transitions make Henry an elliptical figure at best in Morgan's truncated script. Kristin Scott Thomas again brings her innate chilliness to the abbreviated role of Boleyn's mother, while there are mildly interesting turns by Jim Sturgess (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Across-the-Universe/dp/B000ZLFALI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Across the Universe</a>) as devoted brother George, Mark Rylance as Thomas, and David Morrissey (Sharon Stone's befuddled paramour in the execrable&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Basic-Instinct-2/dp/B000FS9UKI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Basic Instinct 2</a>) as the Duke of Norfolk. Spanish actress Ana Torrent brings conviction to her few scenes as Catherine of Aragon. Sandy Powell, no stranger to the period (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shakespeare-in-Love/dp/B00001U0E1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shakespeare in Love</a>), designed the exquisite costumes, while John Paul Kelly's sumptuous production design feels authentic. Kieran McGuigan's richly colorful cinematography is undermined by his recurring tendency to use a side-swipe effect to transition shots. Production details aside, the film remains stubbornly hollow at its core.

Starting with Chadwick's zealous albeit sometimes overly technical commentary track, the 2008 DVD has a robust set of extras. Thumbnail sketches of the film's historical figures are provided in brief video snippets with insight provided by scholars and various members of the cast. Two featurettes are also included - a ten-minute short, ""To Be a Lady"", which discusses the severely limited role of women in the 16th century, a theme addressed pretty well in the film; and another ten-minute short, ""Translating History to Screen"", which prominently features Gregory and focuses on how a voluminous bodice-ripper of a book had to be pared down to a running time of 115 minutes. Separately, there are twelve scenes presented, mostly expanded versions of the ones that ended up in the film and none I would consider indispensable to the final cut. Rounding out the extras is a brief reel of a test used to calibrate the HD cameras used during the shoot, as well as eight previews of other films.",1213142400,,5772,6.29456384323641

3405252,4,B0017APPSE,"I asked some friends recently if I was crazy for actually enjoying this movie, and while the majority told me that I was indeed crazy I found solace in the fact that a select few (my smarter friends w/w) shared my adoration for this film.  No, `The Other Boleyn Girl' is not perfect and it is not brilliant but it is entertaining and passionate and quite memorable.  I find much disgust with the way that this film is being advertised now that the DVD release is close at hand (today, right?); the film being paraded off as if it were nothing more than a period version of `Gossip Girl'.

`The Other Boleyn Girl' is much more than that, and it deserves to be regarded as such.

Telling the fictionalized true story of the Boleyn sisters and their effect on the King of England, `The Other Boleyn Girl' is not without its fare share of drama.  The two sisters couldn't be any different.  Anne is the eldest.  She is outgoing and fresh and extremely charismatic.  She is the apple of her father's eye, the one he invests his hopes and dreams in.  Mary is a stark contrast to her sister.  She is simpler; doe-eyed and quiet.  She is reserved and shy which translates into a warmth that is most becoming.  She may not be immediately noticeable, but once she catches your eye you are swept up in her mystery.

The film opens on the wedding day of Mary Boleyn.  She is happy and hopeful in what her new life will bring her.  Her sister Anne is equally excited, so gleeful at the opportunity to share in Mary's day with her.  But then the mood shifts as Anne is summoned before her father and Uncle and given a most interesting and surprising commission.  It is becoming local gossip that King Henry is unhappy with his wife, Katherine of Aragon, and her inability to produce for him a make heir.  Anne's Uncle suggests that she make herself available to the King when he comes to visit so that she may become his mistress, which will of course mean good things for the Boleyn family.  Anne accepts the request, with disastrous consequences.  Anne's personality is abrasive and strong, and while this serves as an immediate draw it actually pushes the King away and into the arms of Mary.  When Henry decides that he wants to make Mary his mistress instead of Anne he sparks a jealous rage that destroys not only the Boleyn family but leaves its stain amidst the entire empire.

The first thing one will notice about `The Other Boleyn Girl' is that on the surface it is a beautiful film.  The set designs are flawless, the costumes are radiant (even more so than last years `Elizabeth' debacle) and the cinematography is stunning.  But focusing on these mere facets of the films larger picture would suggest that this film relies on surface value alone, which is not the case.  Underneath the beautiful exterior lies a gritty story that is told wonderfully (for the most part) and is littered by some superb performances.

Scarlett Johansson and Natalie Portman tackle the roles of dueling sisters Mary and Anne.  Portman may be the most flamboyant and may garner the most immediate attention, but it's Johansson's brittle and soft performance that truly stole my admiration.  Portman makes Mary a showboat, a canvas for scene stealing antics, which work to the nature of her character.  She has the silky sensuality down pat and works it to produce magic with the audience; drawing them in with her wispy words and her piercing stare.  Johansson instead builds a trust with the audience by creating a likable and compassionate character out of Mary.  We watch as she slowly allows her guards to fall, her pain and suffering exposed for us to see as she is mistreated and walked all over all for a crown that doesn't even fit.  Scarlett says more with her eyes than anyone else within this film can mutter.

Eric Bana is a great actor who really needs more high profile film roles.  He manages to make King Henry a desirable man (he truly is beautiful to look at) but the film is ultimately uninterested in him and thus he becomes cast aside at the focus of the two Boleyn girls.  He doesn't quite yet have the commanding presence of some of his peers (I can only imagine how amazing Russell Crowe would have been in this role) and so he suffers from lack of interest.  His performance is good; great even in moments (when he unleashes himself on Anne towards the end I finally took real notice of this man) but he never truly becomes the `reason' we are watching the film.

The supporting cast, while never given much to do, manages to deliver to the best of their abilities.  Jim Sturgess especially is heartbreaking as the sister's brother George, and Mark Rylance and Kristin Scott Thomas are memorable as the Boleyn parents; especially Thomas who allows her pain and disapproval be made known to her husband and brother.

My main complaint with `The Other Boleyn Girl' is that as the film progresses the dialog and situations start to get repetitive.  I understand that if pregnancies and miscarriages were what happened then you have to include them, but I feel that the film could have found better ways to go about it.  The repetitive nature caused the film to lag a bit towards the end.  Some have noted that the film feels a bit soap-operaish, but I didn't really get that.  Sure, it's not as high profile or as richly stern as some period classics, but the film is serious and dark and maintains that same aura throughout.

Like I said, I wholly enjoyed this film.  Sure, it's not a masterpiece, but it is far from rubbish as far as I am concerned.  The performances are rich (the accents are not as badly uneven as some would have you believe) and the film is altogether a beautiful visual experience.  The story is a moving and painful one, and I felt that director Justin Chadwick crafted an accessible and entertaining film that does not disappoint; at least not in my book.",1213056000,,5882,4.590038314176245

3405254,2,B0017APPSE,"I work for a bookstore and when I saw the novel The Other Boleyn Girl by Phillipa Gregory, I was very intrigued. I bought and read it in about a week and absolutely fell in love with it. I especially loved it because I am a fan of the show the Tudors and am a history buff. When I found out the book was going to be a movie with Natalie Portman and Scarlett Johannsen I was very excited and expected it to be really good. Boy, was I wrong.

The movie was terribly disappointing. Here's why:
  The book is about Mary Boleyn and her experiences through the years that included her liason with the king and her sister Anne's. Mary is the other Boleyn girl. The book is about her experiences, her feelings, and her loves. Whoever wrote the movie made the entire story about Anne! And Mary was once again tossed in the background. I absolutely hate it when movies based on novels aren't true to the author's work, and The Other Boleyn Girl is no different. If I wanted to watch a story about Anne Boleyn, I would watch The Tudors, which is more accurate. This is supposed to be Mary's time to shine. And although Eric Bana is hot, he made a terrible Henry VIII.
Spoiler ** Henry rapes Anne in the movie when he becomes tired of her games. NOT IN THE BOOK AND NEVER HAPPENED!!!! Henry was obsessed with Anne, yes, but he never went that far.

Whoever wrote this movie needs to learn to treat books with more respect and be more true to the novel.

The characters are very bland. Eric Bana has very little to do in the film. His screen time feels wasted and unimportant. Natalie Portman does what she can, but she feels out of place. Her accent is OK, but i expected better from someone like her. Scarlett J. is the only one in the film that actually remembered to act. I actually cared what happened to her as opposed to anyone else. Kristen Scott Thomas, as the mother did a great job in a small role. The actual script is bland and a tad on the boring side. The editing could use some work as they switch from one time fram to another in a matter of seconds. One scene, someone finds out they are pregnant, then literally, the next scene, they are giving birth. It is very jumpy at times. The costumes are lovely and accurate. As for how accurate the actual film is, that is up to debate but I am sure they embelished QUITE a bit.

3405258,5,B0017APPSE,"""The Other Boleyn Girl"" is one of those movies everyone will like one way or another. It has the historical appeal, lush sets and costumes, an all-star cast and a wonderfully evil plot. What strikes me most about this movie is how the conflicts and plights of these characters still exist today, and to a great extent. It is a very watchable, yet moody film, the one I am sure I will watch again.
The semi-true story centers on two sisters, Anne and Mary Boleyn. Mary (Scarlett Johansson), although she is younger, gets married first and settles into the country lifestyle she is fond of. This leaves Anne (Natalie Portman) eligible to become King Henry's (Eric Bana) mistress, but once he arrives to the country, he falls for Mary rather than Anne. Much to the disapproval of their mother (Kristin Scott Thomas), their father and uncle ship them off to the court of England, where Mary is to become King's mistress, despite her marriage. However, Anne is the head-strong sister who won't be happy until she has made a life for herself, and from then on, the sisters combat each other, the King's wife and fatal ambitions.
Although Bana and Johansson give satisfactory performances, it is Portman who is the heart and soul of this movie. Her portrayal of the woman who is responsible for the English Reformation is both seductive and profound. Also, Kieran McGuigan's cinematography is wonderful, and kudos to Peter Morgan, whose screenplay captures the time and place wonderfully.

However, the history buff in me wanted to scream as I watched history manipulated for the sake of drama. This story is already dramatic enough, no changes needed to be made. Anne did not get involved with Henry until after his affair with Mary was over. She did not ""steal"" him from her sister, and certainly not while Mary was pregnant. Anne married Henry Percy?? Really?? Funny, I've never read that in a single biography. Yes, betrothals were viewed as sacred as a marriage, but it is my understanding that they were denied the right to become formally betrothed. I'm not even sure why the ""secret"" marriage ceremony was included in the story.

Mary did not go to the palace and grab Elizabeth and raise her. The incest incident was even dismissed during Anne's lifetime as an attempt to legitimized her murder. So many things wrong with this movie historically... I'm sad to think that there are those who will walk away from this movie thinking they've gotten the real story. Natalie's shining moments were at Anne's trial and execution. Her performance was moving and realistic. I give this movie three stars for those moments alone.

If you have read the book, steer clear of the movie if you expect the film to follow the novel, but if you haven't read the book or keep the two separate, the film is moderately enjoyable.  The costumes are pretty and the actors aren't too bad, with Natalie Portman doing a decent job as Anne Boleyn.  The problem I have is with the rediculous hack job they did in editing. Scenes just chopped into others without any form of a transition, and you are just left in confusion. They never explained what happened to William Carey (Mary Boleyn's 1st husband) in the movie, and she just magically is married to William Stratford in the end.  They also forget to mention that Mary has two children in the book not just a son, and they sadly do not delve into Mary and William Stratford's courtship, which was one of the most enjoyable portions of the book.

So states the Amazon Review for this movie.

2. Anne Boleyn (Natalie Portman) and her sister Mary (Scarlett Johansson) were babelicious babes
3. Married Henry didn't have an heir, so he wanted to pick up a spare
4. Sir Thomas Boleyn had tons of ambition and a couple of daughters to spare
5. Henry picks up the wrong one, who might have turned out to be the right one, if not for ....
6.  ... the other Boleyn girl
7. Abstinence can make the heart grow fonder but befuddles the brain
8. The lady may have been in waiting, but the King wasn't
9. By George! I think she's done it
10. Off with her head!

Warning to students:  Quoting the above in History class may be detrimental to your grades.

More hysterical drama than historical drama, this movie seems more ""Desperate Housewives"" than period piece, but there's no denying that the costumes and sets are stunning, and the lead actors and actresses simply amazing, despite the lack of the proper accents.

3405265,2,B0017APPSE,"Have you ever noticed how Cliff Notes generally do a fair job telling the plot of a story and a poor one handling the characters. Then in the case of character driven pieces they do an even poorer job.

Well watching this movie felt like the director sent an assistant to read the Cliff notes, then got the assistant drunk and then based the story on what the assistant told him

Henry the VIII is not exactly praised in the book, but he's not a rapist.

But Henry is not the only character mutilated in such a fashion. The books rich tapestry of feelings and sublety is shredded in a way that cannot simply be blamed on the change of format from book to movie.

Almost every role is dreadfully miscast, especially William Stafford, who in any responsible adaptation should have been a man of clear ability, not doe-eyed innocence. The all important son is basically ignored and that's just the beginning.

3405267,2,B0017APPSE,"""The Other Boleyn Girl"" charts the story of the fortunes of Mary Boleyn (Johansson) - Anne's (Portman) less famous younger sister - in her earlier bid for the affections of King Henry VIII (Bana). It also covers the major points of Anne's relationship with the avaricious monarch, as he divorces himself both from his barren-yet-faithful wife Katherine of Aragon (Ana Torent), and the Roman Catholic Church.

Good points first: the cinematography and production design in ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" are stupendous. There's a real sense of reserve and quietly simmering passion in the hazy lighting and dream-like camerawork, and the sets and costumes are duly lush and incredibly detailed. Visually, Scarlett Johansson is a great choice to play the innocent, buxom Mary Boleyn, and there are several moments where ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" looks like a moving painting, reminiscent of Vermeer or Holbein.

Unfortunately, almost every other element of ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" is below-par, not least of which is a truly awful script. It's a kind of mishmash of faux-Tudor dialogue peppered with contemporary phrases so the audience can follow the story - but sadly, it's overdone and cheesy. And the movie's truncated running time means that major events of the film - such as Henry's discarding Mary for Anne or his divorce from Katherine of Aragon (a major event in European history) - are given the briefest of scenes depicting them, before the too-thin script takes off to cover yet more ground. There's no real sense of drama or danger anywhere in the movie.

And it's because of this poor scripting that Eric Bana doesn't get much to do: I'm still not sure that he was in love with either Mary or Anne Boleyn, such is Bana's one-dimensional and expressionless reading of one of History's most vibrant kings. Portman as Anne is alright, but she doesn't really capture the intensity or the ambition of this most forward-thinking of women in history - nor does she touch on the dangers of Anne's situation when her marriage to Henry begins to fail. And Scarlett Johansson comes off as a bored simpleton. Other cast notables include Kristin Scott-Thomas as the Boleyn Matriarch (yawn, she's not around for much of the movie), Mark Rylance as Daddy Boleyn (with one expression of less-than-fatherly concern slapped to his face for all of his scenes, this guy gets really boring really quickly) and David Morrissey as their uncle, the Duke of Norfolk (high camp in Tudor tights: this guy's been nominated for two consecutive Razzies - I'm not surprised, and he's not good).

All-in-all ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" is a one-dimensional romp through some dull acting and poor writing, saved from one-star hell by its beautiful appearance. You'd be better off with a few episodes of season 2 of ""The Tudors"" - high-camp soap opera that doesn't try to be anything else. ""The Other Boleyn Girl"", sadly, is too high-falootin' to really recognise its own limitations, and it's in this pretension that the audience, once again, loses out.

3405268,4,B0017APPSE,"I saw this one in the theater.  It seems to be getting some mediocre reviews, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. Obviously, there is some historical fact.  As most of us know, Ann lost her head over love.  How much of the rest is accurate?  I have no idea.  This is a story about the Boleyn family, King Henry VIII, and surrounding people.  It is not about war or anything else.  It includes: deception, lies, and the goals of achieving power and wealth by using people.  There are also 3 violent scenes that I had to hide my face from (but I am a wee bit sensitive).  Still, I very much enjoyed the movie and thought the parts were well played. I heard someone call it a ""chick-flick,"" but I did not see that as accurate. Natalie Portman (from one of the Star Wars movies, as Luke & Leia's mother--and other movies) did a great job as Ann Boleyn.

The story begins with the 3 Boleyn children playing on the grounds of the family's huge English estate, while the father plots of whom he might marry his daughter(s) off to, to secure wealth or power.  Next thing you know, the children are all grown up.  Ann is the eldest.  She has a sister, Mary and a brother.  Ann is a pretty girl.  She is also very independent and with a fiery disposition.  Mary is more plain in appearance, a simple quiet soul.  Mary marries a simple young man and they hope to live a quiet life in a small village somewhere.  Mary and her husband have no interest in the English Court.  Then things change.

The Duke of Norfolk, in the best interests of King Henry VIII of England, decides to help the king out.  The Duke is also uncle to the Boleyn children.  The Queen has born a daughter and had still-borns trying to bear the king a son.  The king and queen are barely speaking at this point, so the well-meaning Duke decides the king needs a girlfriend, who could maybe bear him a son while she's at it.  The Uncle and the Boleyn father try to set up the king with Ann, promising her that when the King is done with her, she will be set up with a nice Duke or Earl (maybe the Duke of Earl :-)  Then the Boleyn family would be set for life. (Those English estates were often inherited and cost money to maintain.)

Well, as luck would have it, Ann is all ready to enjoy the pleasures of the King's generosity, when the King does a flip and takes an interest in Mary, because of her good nature, honest, kindness, etc. (and Mary is pretty too--just more plain than Ann.)  This causes a bit of tension between the girls as the whole Boleyn family moves to Court to, again, enjoy the generosity of the King.

I don't want to tell you any more because then you will know everything I know.  Most of you already know what happens to Ann and that is where the movie ends, but I found all the stuff in between pretty interesting.  I wanted to get up from my seat for a couple of minutes but could not walk away.  By the way, Queen Elizabeth was the daughter of Ann and Henry.

How about the Boleyn father.  Nice guy, huh?  ""Take my daughter and just set me up financially.""

Just a side note, but I would not recommend this for your children.  Children sometimes see things that invoke fear, project the fears onto people they know, and have fear, nightmares and bad feelings for years.",1205712000,,3251,4.2894736842105265
3405269,3,B0017APPSE,"There seems to be quite a revisionist movement afoot in Hollywood these days. After decades of picturing Henry VIII as a fat, bearded man who could always be seen tearing a bite out of a turkey leg, the type of role Charles Laughton would (and did) play, an image perpetuated by American and British film. In the last few years, there has been a definite effort to make the role seem sexier. Given the shenanigans the Tudors got into, this isn't surprising. Who wants to see Laughton bedding the beautiful, young actress playing Anne Boleyn, or Jane Seymour, or one of his other wives. So Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, the young Irish actor who made a memorable impression in, among other films, Woody Allen's ""Matchpoint"", is the King of England in Showtime's ""The Tudors"" and Eric Bana (""Hulk"", ""Munich"") takes the throne of England in the new film ""The Other Boleyn Girl"".

Henry the VIII (Bana) is desperate for a male heir to take over the throne of the country when he dies. His wife, Katherine of Aragon (Ana Torrent), has just given birth to a stillborn son and he is so furious he can barely look at her. The scheming Duke of Norfolk (David Morrissey, ""Basic Instinct 2"", British TV's ""Viva Blackpool"") knows the King will soon stray and fortune will favor whichever family can provide him with a mistress. His brother and sister-in-law, Sir Thomas (Mark Rylance) and Lady Elizabeth (Kristin Scott Thomas, ""The English Patient"") have two daughters, Anne (Natalie Portman) and Mary (Scarlett Johansson). The Duke convinces his brother they should host the King and manages to convince him if they were to arrange an affair between the King and Anne, the Boleyn family would be much the better for it. The King arrives and Anne is practically thrust into his face, but he is put off by her forceful nature and comes to fancy Mary instead. But as Mary has just married a merchant whom she loves, this complicates matters, but not much. Anne suspects her sister of going behind her back and their relationship becomes strained. When Mary becomes pregnant, and the pregnancy proves difficult, the family decides to try to make Anne the King's new mistress. But Anne wants more and has since learned how to make men give her what she wants.

""The Other Boleyn Girl"", directed by Justin Chadwick (who comes from British television) and based on the popular novel by Philippa Gregory, is a handsomely mounted production, but it can't quite escape the soap opera elements at the core of the story.

I'm not sure how Gregory actually researched the subject matter, but this film and ""The Tudors"" seem to be plundering the same treasure chest of material. If even a small portion of this material is based in fact, the Tudors were one randy family - and this is a very different view of what we are used to. Royalty is supposed to be noble, elegant, above reproach. This is, of course, the fairy tale version we all grew up with, and anyone with half a wit realizes royalty are real people. And real people with a lot of power and money tend to abuse both. The Tudors were, apparently, no different. Bana's Henry the VIII carries on affairs with women when he becomes the slightest bored with his current wife. It doesn't help their relationship that his wife is unable to provide him with a male heir, someone to leave the throne to, to ensure the stability of the country. As he feels this is his lasting legacy, he feels it is of the utmost importance. His desperation to find an heir, and his randy nature, lead him to the comfort of many women. It even seems to be a well-known secret the King strays. The Duke of Norfolk, one of his trusted advisors, recognizes the signs and wants to ensure his family can benefit from the King's wandering eye.

While this is certainly intriguing, the problem is Bana is pretty bland. At one point, Henry the VIII learns one of his gifts has been refused and he blows up, shouting. This is about the extent of the fireworks from this man, the King of England, a man who would change the course of his country's history for good and bad. Throughout the rest of the film, he merely walks at a fast pace from one location to another, painting a vivid picture of his frustration, but little else.

Eric Bana has been in a number of films and we keep waiting for that ""Great Eric Bana Performance"". He came close in Spielberg's ""Munich"", but overall, his career has been one big disappointment. He's a good-looking guy, but I suspect he isn't a great actor, which is why his performances are so universally mediocre (i.e., ""Hulk"").

Natalie Portman plays Anne Boleyn, and she does a pretty good job. When approached by her father and uncle, she is initially intrigued by the idea of becoming the King's mistress. But when this doesn't work out, she is sent to France, to become a member of the Queen's court. Upon her return, she is a different woman. When the family needs her again, she decides to make sure she gets what she wants and starts to manipulate Henry. How does she do this? She refuses his attentions, his gifts and this makes him desire her all the more. In fact, she wants to be Queen. One small problem, Henry is already married and that pesky Catholic Church frowns on divorce. As Anne manipulates the situation to her advantage, and Henry starts to do things that will forever change the course of England's history, Portman makes Anne seem extremely, utterly devious and manipulative in her own right. She clearly did learn a thing or two in that French court.

This performance, full of different moods, actions and shenanigans is a role most actors dream for. It allows them to show off their skills. More often than not, this type of performance ultimately becomes hammy and overdone. But Portman manages to play all of the facets of Anne's character while keeping her just this side of human. She doesn't downplay it, she is just more subtle than I could have imagined or believed.

Scarlett Johannson plays Mary, the ""less-attractive"" daughter of the Boleyn family. So it comes to everyone's surprise, including the audience, when Henry falls for her instead. Mary is supposed to be plain and simply seems more boring than anything else. She wants to marry a common merchant and doesn't seem to have the designs her sister has, so when Henry favors her, she pleads with her family to convince him to take Anne instead. When this doesn't work, she agrees, for the sake of her family. Mary is not the ""less-attractive"" daughter. She is simply the less-interesting daughter. As the story begins, the two sisters are inseparable. When the King favors Mary, this puts a strain on their relationship because Anne doesn't believe Mary didn't seduce the monarch. Later, she returns to the court, to plead with Henry to spare Anne's live. He asks her ""Why are you here?"" Apparently, he has as much trouble as the rest of us figuring out why she even cares about her sister, because she shows so little emotion.

Kristin Scott Thomas plays Lady Elizabeth Boleyn and she is quite good. As a female living in this society, she has a very definite idea of what her role is and could be. Because she has to live by the stringent rules governing women, she is frustrated. But she is not without a certain amount of power. She is frustrated, angered, maddened and annoyed by her husband and brother-in-law's manipulation of her daughters, of their efforts to basically prostitute the two young ladies. She is fully aware their new roles could help the family, but she recognizes how morally wrong the idea is.

The film is, as mentioned, handsomely mounted, and despite the soap opera strains in the story, it is an interesting film but it would be a better film with a more mature director at the helm. In virtually every scene, there is at least one shot looking through a doorway, panning across a railing, looking out from the interior of a coach, the fabric fringe obscuring the view, looking through wooden fraught work. It simply becomes annoying. Chadwick is trying to give us the feel of how conspiratorial this society was, how people were likely eavesdropping on everything. But this technique is overused, and abused by about the fifth time it happens. Then, every time it occurs, it stands out like a glaring thumb and draws attention to the fact we are watching a film. When we become conscious we are watching a film, it draws us back to the real world, ruining any chance we have of getting lost in this time, this world, this land of make believe.

For that, you are probably better off turning on the television and catching the latest episode of ""The Tudors"".",1205712000,,8613,4.678547854785479

Yet the writers have taken enough artistic liberties to raise questions regarding the accuracy of these accounts.  This story is based on the historical fiction novel&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Other-Boleyn-Girl/dp/1416560602/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Other Boleyn Girl</a>&nbsp;by Philippa Gregory.  Despite the artistic liberties taken with the story it  is very well put together and interesting to watch for those willing to broaden their historical views on the period.

The Story and the Acting

The story of King Henry VIII's many romantic exploits are well known.  He married Catherine of Aragon for political gain, yet engaged in many well publicized affairs. Eventually, each of the Boleyn sisters landed in his crosshairs.

Eric Bana is very good as the king, though his isn't the best written role in the film. Anne Boleyn's character is dynamic and vindictive, and Natalie Portman shows her range here.  Her sister Mary, played by Scarlett Johansson, catches the King's attention.  Though she is newly married, her husband is disposed of and the King has soon added her to his list of conquests.

But Anna will not be outdone.  She coyly preys upon the King's desires, and soon becomes the object of his affections.

All three of these actors put in strong performances.  Johansson's role is understated and Bana's is exaggerated.  Only Portman has a character with full range, both manipulative and vulnerable.

Jim Sturgess, whose star seems to be rising, has a somewhat understated role as the brother, George Boleyn.  His role is ultimately manipulated by the powers that by to undermine Anne when her perceived value falls.  He is perhaps the most under-utilized actor here, with few lines and a role not in keeping with the importance he played in history.  Yet with his lead role in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/21/dp/B0018CWW5K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">21</a>&nbsp;to add to this one, he is clearly not hurting for work.

Yet the sets and the costumes are also characters here, as in any period piece.  The castle is made shadowy with expert lighting.  The costumes and the makeup are also beautifully done, though I can't comment on just how historically accurate they are.  Yes, we can expect Academy Award nominations in many categories, including costumes, set design, art direction and cinematography.

The DVD Extras

While the DVD version of this includes the standard commentary track to accompany the film, it is the other extras that really add dimensions to the story.  There are bios and back-stories of principal characters which were close in production value and content to something one might watch on The History Channel.  Including the standard author, cast and crew sound-bites, there were also interviews of historians to put the story in context.

Warnings and Considerations

At the close of the picture, after the inevitable historical event which everyone familiar with the story will be expecting, there is a somewhat strange montage of all the characters which includes brief captions explaining their fates and the historical significance of the events they took part in.  The notes are hard to read, somewhat prosaic and are definitely subjective.  Yet they do seem to convey a message which I conclude was intentional: that the somewhat petty sexual and interpersonal exploits of this group of people had tremendous historical consequences for the UK, Europe and the world.  This is very subjective, yet it partly justifies what is otherwise a very convenient and abrupt technique to end the movie and tie up all the story lines neatly.

This is definitely a version that is not for kids.  The story deviates in sometimes shocking ways, with the sex turning violent in at least one scene.

Some of the actors do suffer from a loss of their accents in some scenes, yet the in-the-moment performances make that easy to ignore.

Conclusion

If you're a fan of period pieces and all things English royalty, this movie is already on your list.  It's worth the price of admission.

Enjoy!",1204934400,,4727,5.743884892086331
3405271,3,B0017APPSE,"With so many good actors, they could have done so much better. And yet, we get this, a rather boring, inconsistent and inaccurate film full of fluff. I was expecting a great and passionate love story. Granted, it is really hard to make a love story where Henry VIII is involved. In the story of the two Boleyn girls as mistresses  (and one wife) of Henry VIII, Johansson and Portman do the best with what they are given. I have nothing much to say about this movie because I didn't get much out of it. It was boring and I could not wait for it to end. The end was fitting of a Lifetime movie and the budget seems to have gone to costumes rather than producing anything of serious value.",1204848000,,686,4.236641221374046
3405272,4,B0017APPSE,"It is the year 1518; after years of marriage, England's Queen Catherine has delivered a still-born daughter, much to the chagrin of King Henry VIII.  The ambitious Duke of Norfolk suggests that his niece, Anne Boleyn, become Henry's mistress and give him the male heir he desires.  The King doesn't take to Anne, but is attracted to Mary, her younger, married sister, and an affair begins.  Mary has a son, but Henry abandons her and pursues Anne who insists that Henry marry her.  To do that, Henry severs relations with Catholic Rome.  His short marriage to Anne is disappointing; when she produces a daughter, he tires of her.  She is accused of treason and adultery and executed.

While the film's costumes, sets, and photography are truly sumptuous, something is lacking here.  As much as I enjoyed watching it, the film was immediately forgettable.  The story has been told many times before and there is nothing new here nor are the performances memorable enough to stand out from previous renditions.

Scarlett Johansson (Mary), Natalie Portman (Anne), and Eric Bana (Henry) are all fine, but not remarkable.  The script plays fast and loose with historical facts and time and lacks a feeling of high drama, but it is a visual feast.  It's a pleasant-enough tale that could and should have been better.",1204761600,,1310,4.904545454545454
3405273,3,B0017APPSE,"For a soap opera, THE OTHER BOLEYN GIRL is reasonably diverting.  I enjoyed myself while watching it and it even made me go to the internet when I got home to look up the ""real"" story behind Anne Boleyn, Catherine of Aragon and many of the other historical characters presented in the fictionalized world of the film.

The movie succeeds primarily due to three nice performances. Erin Bana, as Henry VIII, is a different Henry than I've seen before.  He's younger and certainly handsome enough.  He's a more modern king...not just some fat, turkey-leg munching pig.  He's plenty manly, and seems to primarily be a reasonable guy...except when it comes to his roving eye.  Scarlett Johannsen is the shy sister Mary, who doesn't seek the limelight, but catches Henry's attention and falls in love with him.

Natalie Portman, in one of her livelier performances, is Anne Boleyn, the sister who dreams of climbing the social ladder, and seduces the king by sheer force of will and psychological manipulation.  Her role is certainly the juiciest one in the film and she handles it quite well.  We see her ambition and we see her at the height of success and at the absolute lowest of states.  We grow for a time to loathe her and then to embrace her again.

The movie basically tells a story of how these two sisters manipulate and are manipulated as they jockey for position in the king's court...or try to stay out of it altogether.  We see each of them achieve a grand height and a remarkable low.  Because it's set in a historical time period, it has that sheen of respectability that all period pieces seem to achieve.  Yet at its heart, it is a soap opera...one that is actually fairly predictable.  Most of the minor characters in the film are merely caricatures, and most are not very likeable.  Kirsten Scott Thomas shows some strength as the Boleyn mother...but mostly I yearned for someone to give this gifted actress a great, big part again.  It's been too long.

The script is also a bit scattershot.  It assumes we understand just a bit too much about the real history.  (For example, when Henry's first wife, Catherine, is put on trial, it would certainly have helped to know the historical circumstances that led her to be Henry's wife in the first place.)  Yet it is also trite all to frequently.  When Henry first seduces Mary, their dialogue is merely generic flattery.  Mary is supposed to fall for Henry during this scene...but the movie fails to make us ""fall"" for Henry at that time.  It's tough to make a person like Henry VIII likeable, because we've all got pretty hard and fast ideas about the kind of person he was.  If the movie had made his likeability easier to see and then made his torment a bit more approachable...the movie would have gone from generic to something truly special.

I don't want to take away from Portman's performance in particular.  The movie is entertaining enough and Portman good enough to make it worth seeing.  But it seldom rises to the level it aspires too.",1204588800,,3012,4.67490494296578
3405274,2,B0017APPSE,"Natalie Portman, Scarlett Johansson, Eric Bana, a bestselling novel, and an Oscar-nominated screenwriter--all these elements should form a brilliant, talented collaboration, but unfortunately the novel is hacked into an incongruent muddle of scenes which are further ruined by the atrocious editing.

It is based on Philippa Gregory's bestselling novel The Other Boleyn Girl, and tells the story of two sisters, Mary (played by Scarlett Johansson) and Anne Boleyn (played by Natalie Portman), who bother vie for King Henry VIII's (played by Eric Bana) affection (if only they knew he was not the one-girl-type). It is a time in England when girls were as their mother lady Elizabeth Boleyn (played by Kirstin Scott Thomas) put it ""...Traded like cattle for the advancement and pleasure of men."" The girl's father (played by Mark Rylance) wants to catch the eye of the King to secure wealth and status by ""pimping"" his daughter Anne to be the King's mistress. King Henry passes over Anne in favor of the quiet submitting daughter Mary, but once she is pregnant with his illegitimate child, he quickly turns back to Anne who has returned to the court scene with a newfound sensual, seductive confidence. As Henry falls hard for Anne, Mary is quickly swept aside so the stage is set for the inevitable conclusion.

I did read the book and loved it. However I generally enjoy film adaptations no matter how far they stray from the book. Film and book are two completely different types of storytelling, so with that said the reason I did not like this film was not its major detractions from the book, but the incredible dull, emotionless production.

The acting from Natalie Portman, Eric Bana, and Kirstin Scott-Thomas was top-notch, especially Portman's (I am convinced had this been a better production and release date she would probably be garnering nominations). The rest of the cast could not hold up. Scarlet Johansson's acting was cringe-worthy as she never removed the same complacent, angelic expression from her face (she didn't even cry when her sister's head was chopped off!) and spoke in the same tone the entire film.

The production itself was not bad, the sets, costumes, etc. were all quite exquisite. The problem with this film was it had so many good aspects it could not make use of them. The editing, I must point out, was the downfall of this great story. All the scenes were so disjointed and quick that you never had time to get pulled into the story. Helping it along was the frustrating script which had lines spoken so impassively and for the sole purpose to inform the audience what was going on that it was devoid of any eloquence or originality. I felt there were whole sections left out that I knew because I had read the book, but someone new to it would be thoroughly lost.

This is such an unfortunate botching of an intriguing tale, and once again feels like the producers did not know what to do with all the talent they had. It not only is a horrible adaptation, but a very poorly done film that moved through its' material so quickly it lost its' emotional depth on the way. At the end you are left still waiting for it to start, and are so detached you do not even care about the characters whose lives were so horribly ruined. The only reason I would recommend anyone to see this film is to see Natalie Portman's performance which is utterly fascinating to watch as she plays this illustrious historical figure.",1204502400,,3451,4.783557046979865
3405275,2,B0017APPSE,"Perched stupidly between an austere prestige picture and a tempestuous bodice ripper, ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" is little more than a posturing goof ball that happens to feature a semi-decent turn from Natalie Portman. Why this movie was made, and the purpose of its tone, is beyond me. It almost makes ""Marie Antoinette"" look restrained.

Based on Phillppa Gregory's novel, which pads the story of Henry VIII and his marriage to Anne Boleyn - as if the split from the Catholic Church and Boleyn's eventual beheading needed it - ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" introduces us to Anne's moon-faced, guileless sister, Mary (Scarlett Johansson).  It's she, not Anne, who's the first pawn in Sir Thomas Boleyn's plan to ensnare Henry (Eric Bana) and cement the family's royal bloodlines. It's Mary who goes to court, bringing Anne in tow. Mary, who drops her sap of a husband to crawl into the king's bed.  Mary, who bears the son that Henry's first wife, Catherine of Aragon, couldn't provide.

But Anne only trails until halftime, so to speak, returning from a short exile in France to pour all kinds of sugar on the grim, sad-faced Henry while Mary's bed-ridden, awaiting her child. Anne taunts Mary with this knowledge as payback for Mary's betrayal during Anne's first, ""secret"" marriage. According to Peter Morgan's screenplay, Anne's hard-to-get routine is more or less the source of the great schism between Henry's England and the Catholic Church. When the king finally ""has"" Anne, it's in a fit of petulant  rage after a scolding from wife Catherine. The movie's final act concerns Anne's rule as queen and her eventual execution.

How accurate is any of this? Who knows. History generally tells us that Mary got around quite a bit more than Anne did in the French courts; a sweet simpleton she was not. Gregory's book  acknowledges this; the movie does not. The bigger problem lies in Justin Chadwick's oppressive direction, which throws an odd, dark tint on the visuals and the portentous music over too many scenes. That's a holdover from the movie's Oscar hopes - dashed once it became clear ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" has all kinds of lapses and absurdities, not the least of which features Mary riding alone on horseback, presumably for days, to save her sister's life, and walking out of the castle with Anne's daughter Elizabeth to ride that same horse back home.

Gregory's novel doesn't exactly have a healthy scorn of Henry's intelligence, but, as Bana plays him, Henry's a chiseled stud with a Dom DeLuise beard and a pea brain. The man was indeed an oaf, but history's shown him to be a brilliant one: A musician, a poet and an accomplished thinker. Henry enjoyed as much power, if not more, than any royal before or since. The movie doesn't reflect it. Bana, a dark-eyed brooder, is the wrong fit for the role.

Portman, however, makes an intriguing Anne. Her looks fit the paintings of the queen to some extent, and the actor manages to suppress that giant, unflattering grin of hers. Portman's  never going to be a particularly great actor - charmed lives such as hers rarely produce the needed range - but she's endearing in her own way, and the role of Anne lets her try on manipulation. It suits her, as does the trappings of the time period: Wardrobe, accents, etc. Better than Kirsten Dunst, anyhow.

And, frankly, Johansson, who glides through her scenes with her trademark opacity. We don't find out what makes Mary tick so much we hear the wind blowing through her ears. Although Mary smartens up by the end of the picture, she always seems a little slow on the uptake, and Johansson's bewildered, open-mouthed persona transforms virtue into the addled gaze of a milquetoast. It worked five years ago in ""Girl With A Pearl Earring;"" it's growing a little old now.",1204502400,,3779,4.825347758887172
3405276,3,B0017APPSE,"THE OTHER BOLEYN GIRL suffers from overexposure to the passion for all things Tudor that has produced multiple novels, television series, and films that range from great to mediocre. Having not read Philippa Gregory's best selling novel, this viewer entered the theater without preconceived notions of the path the story would take/stray in the wake of heightened interest in historical data. From the opening scenes to the end the impression is one of having viewed some very beautiful scenery, sumptuous costumes, grand lighting - and very little involvement in caring for the plight of the characters.  The soggy music score underlines the unrelenting dark atmosphere of the story and the production, and despite a cast of actors known for credibility in historic roles, there is little compassion stirred.

King Henry VIII (Eric Bana, in relatively little screen time) tires of Katherine of Aragon (Ana Torent) and her inability to bear a male heir. The Boleyn clan (Mark Rylance and Kristin Scott Thomas in collusion with the Duke of Norfolk David Morrissey) seize on Henry's frustration and serve up their daughters Anne (Natalie Portman) and Mary (Scarlett Johansson) to satisfy his dalliances.  The younger Mary beds him first, does produce a son, but falls out of favor leaving Anne to work her newly honed skills of feminism learned during her exile in France on the easily seduced King to become his queen, yet is able to only bear him a daughter, Elizabeth. The results are tension in the castle, in the Boleyn family, and between the sisters Anne and Mary. History is molded by the writer to maintain more of a Hollywood soap opera that a recreation of fact and it all ends with beheadings and the child Elizabeth running gaily through sunny old meadows of England.

The actors all try to make us buy into this version of betrayal and lust and loathing, but the dialog (written by Peter Morgan) is tired and used and anything but in keeping with the period.

3405277,4,B0017APPSE,"*Mild Spoilers*

In this gorgeously made film, we take a deep look into the Boleyn intrigue through the eyes of a young woman often overlooked in the tangle: Mary, Anne Boleyn's sister. A shadowed fact in history is that Henry XVIII made love to and fathered two children with Mary Boleyn before he moved on to Anne. This brilliantly woven tale, first an intricate novel by Philippa Gregory, reveals not only Mary's traumatic tale, but some of the deepest folds of the Boleyn family's saga.

It's well known that Mary and Anne's parents were ambitious to a fault and offered their children up for royal barter whenever King Henry smiled upon them. Mary, newly wedded, was offered before Anne and remained a pawn and an assistant to her family's schemes long after Anne and Henry married. What this amazing movie and its parent novel focus on is the Boleyn scandal, the decay of Henry's two first marriages, the deadly consequences of reckless ambition, and Mary's own desperate loyalties and love for her family: all caught and tangled in the threads of Henry's swaying favor.

The only reason I docked one star is the omission and alteration of certain important historical facts. For one thing, Mary had two children, a daughter first and a son second, with Henry. In this movie (not the book), Mary's daughter is completely omitted and her son is scarcely mentioned. Movie editing aside, the existence of Mary's children was an important fact in history and not one to be overlooked. Secondly, the movie added a ridiculous scene in which Henry promised Anne that he would never sleep with his wife or speak to her sister again if she only promised to consider accepting him (right in the middle of Mary's child labor!) This is flat-out ridiculous: no king with an ounce of pride would make such a promise, much less Henry XVIII! The result of his words was equally ridiculous: Anne accepted his promise, and when the midwife called to him that he had a son, he simply looked over at Mary and walked away without a second glance! Please; the one thing that Henry never did was turn his back on a son and his desire for one proved, over and over, to trump his lust for a woman.

Lastly, and most offensively, there was a disgusting scene in which Henry raped Anne from behind in a rage, before they were even married. This is flat-out preposterous Hollywood soap opera: from all historical accounts, Henry was nothing but desperate for Anne before their marriage and it was not until after Elizabeth's birth that he began to lose patience and show anger towards her. The idea that he would rape her, especially before their marriage, is nonsensical in every extreme.

Luckily, the second half of the film made up for any earlier faults. The two main actresses, Johansen and Portman, were simply phenomenal: Johansen perfectly captures Mary's gentler but strong spirit, while Portman really came into her own showing Anne's increasing despair and desperation for her life. The scenes with Mary's quiet fire and Anne's pacing around the room, black hair swinging like a silk cape in her frantic energy, are unforgettable and trademarks of amazing acting. What truly won the movie in my eyes was the heartbreaking and eye-opening truth that the film and the book both revealed: the ultimate and utter tragedy of placing ambition before love, greed before caution, and reward before family. I couldn't be happier that I watched this stunningly beautiful film and, inspite of certain omissions, I think it deserves a place of honor right up there with the book. I recommend this film to everyone; you'll never forget the tragedy of the Boleyn family and what they reveal of humankind.",1204329600,,3680,4.8256735340729
3405278,3,B0017APPSE,"As a standalone movie, ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" is okay....not great, but okay. However, as someone who is a die-hard fan of Philippa Gregory's novel, I wasn't at all impressed with this film adaptation.

The problem with this movie is that the script sucks, pure and simple. Obviously, the basic plot is the same as the book: The young Mary Boleyn (Scarlett Johansson) is commissioned by her ambitious family to cast her husband aside and become the mistress of King Henry VIII (Eric Bana) while her older sister, Anne (Natalie Portman), jealously looks on. Eventually Henry's eyes drift over to Anne, who replaces Mary as the favorite and embarks on a dangerous plan to replace Queen Katherine (Ana Torrent) on the throne of England.

Unfortunately, this movie doesn't capture the energy and passion of Gregory's brilliant novel. The pacing is tediously slow, and so many details of the plot were changed for the film, for no apparent reason at all. The Boleyn girls grow up at court, so the way Mary and Henry initially meet was rewritten in the film. Mary had two children by Henry, but only the boy is shown in the movie. Lady Boleyn (Kristin Scott Thomas) was reinvented for the screen and is portrayed as a woman who actually gives a crap about her children, but in the book she supports the use of her daughters as pawns in the family's quest for power. I didn't understand what happened to Mary's first husband in the movie...he just sort of wanders off-screen 15 minutes into the film and is never seen or heard from again. (In the book, he dies from the sweat, which is why Mary is later free to marry William Stafford.) What else? I was disappointed in the way the incest issue was handled in the film. I guess the producers assumed that it was too taboo of a topic for the movie, because they totally changed the way it was handled. Oh yes, and King Henry never raped Anne Boleyn in the novel, and he certainly didn't tire of her before he married her! That was so ridiculous.

There are many more discrepancies between the book and the film that I don't even have time to list, and they completely ruined what could have been an excellent film. Another thing that bothered me is the way the pacing constantly shifted. At times things moved very slowly, but then the plot jolted forward at lightning speed, especially toward the end of the film. Major historical events were glossed over and only mentioned in a sentence or two of dialogue, such as Katherine's banishment and the establishment of the Church of England. If you blink while watching this movie, you'll definitely miss something important.

This movie had all the makings of a hit. Visually, it's absolutely stunning. I especially loved all the brilliant costumes. Also, the performances by the actors were phenomenal. I was particularly enchanted by Portman's portrayal of Anne, which was completely on the mark. However, all of the actors were limited by a terrible script. It's such a shame.

I am so incredibly bummed about how crappy this film turned out to be. Do yourself a favor and read the book BEFORE you see the movie so you know what you're missing (that is, if you even want to bother with the movie at all).",1204329600,,3198,4.673179396092363
3405279,3,B0017APPSE,"After reading Philippa Gregory's novel ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" and finding it a head and neck above the normal bodice ripping fare, I awaited the film of the same name, directed by Justin Chadwick with anticipation, expecting the same interplay of jealousy, connivance and sympathy between the two main characters as depicted in the book.  Instead Peter Morgan's screenplay cuts to the chase rather literally, boiling down the relationship between Anne Boleyn and her sister Mary to simply that motivated by a touch of the old green monster.

The book begins in London where lady-in-waiting to Queen Catherine of Aragon, Mary unwittingly and unintentionally catches the king's roving eye to the delight of her scheming upwardly mobile family.  Anne, a recent returnee to Tudor-ville via the French court acts as staunch backer and campaign strategist to help her sister maintain her rise in status.  Brother George simply adores his two siblings and moves heaven and earth to help his family accomplish their objective in this velvet-and-ermine-clad sexually permissive jungle that vaguely suggests a more somberly Desperate Housewives at their hair-pulling best. The trio works together as a mini-coven, understanding their fate and trying their best to elevate the Boleyn standing in the British realm at the expense of their own personal happiness through any means.  Even though a basic knowledge of history spoils the ending of this tale, Gregory does her best to keep the bombardment of all these plots and machinations at an understandable yet intriguing pace.

Not so with the film, although the overall motivation and maneuvering of the film Team Boleyn is no different.  After the opening shots of the trio as children romping in an amber-hued countryside, the audience is rather quickly propelled forward to the task at hand--Queen Catherine of Aragon, Henry's wife has failed to give him the male heir he so frantically desires--the Boleyn solution?  Showcase one of the saucy sisters to solace the king in his yearning with a little adultery and thereby procure a Boleyn-Tudor son.  Simple.  Raise the family stakes up an earldom or two to secure the families future for all generations. Cut to a boardroom-type scene where the Boleyns wait at their family estate for the arrival of the king like an over-starved bunch of crocodiles awaiting a barge of tasty morsels gone aground. Uncle Howard, played to slimeball perfection by David Morrissey and dear old dad Thomas--Mark Rylance imbues this character with anxious looks and an almost prescient wretchedness--push first daughter Boleyn forward even though mother Boleyn, the ever sophisticated Kirsten Scott Thomas cries out like a pre-feminist Greek chorus that no good will come from using her children like chattel. Enter wily brunette teaser Natalie Portman slithering provocatively with dark eyes all a-sparkle in sideways looks like a brilliant green snake in a bejeweled stomacher--her plan to wow the king with her expert horsemanship backfiring when she one ups Henry's lesser equestrian ability.  On his royal back, he is nursed by Mary of the pout-y lips (Scarlett Johansson), the pinch hitter whose golden beauty, Rubinesque form and utter submissiveness seem far more appealing (and easier to conquer) than sister Anne of the thousand tongue-in-cheek flirtations.

As in the novel, Eric Bana's positively vainglorious Henry enthralls the love-starved Mary. But even after the procurement of the desired male heir, sister Anne's agenda sheet still bears a golden crown above her entwined initials--why settle for illegitimate when a fully legitimized heir could concrete the Boleyn legacy in the annals of history for all time?

And so the story moves forward at a rate that rivals the speed of light, urged on by a rousing soundtrack written by Paul Cantelon.  The five years that it takes Anne to achieve her endgame literally take place in a few moments.  The characters of Thomas Moore and Cardinal Wolsey might as well be non-existent.  The role of brother George, although `touched' upon is not given the extensive treatment Gregory bestows him in her novel.  But most of all the characters of Anne and Mary wallow in stereotype.  Anne epitomizes dark ambition--Portman's performance depicts a witch of a girl-woman bedazzled by court life yet angered and frustrated by her own failure.  Ultimately she realizes her plight, stumbling as she goes, over her own bravado and cunning.  As her foil, Mary shimmers in a soft light that showcases her Renaissance beauty--I can never fail to think of Scarlett Johansson as the model for Vermeer's `Girl With a Pearl Earring""--as the alternate other Boleyn girl, she symbolizes the milkmaid's existence--the simpler lifestyle fueled by the sun and outdoors that ebbs with the absence of light and abstract absolutes.  For her, love takes precedence over wealth and prestige.  Without the clever nuances of the novel, the film brands the two sisters as two-dimensional symbols of good and evil.  They stand apart as rivals rather than Boleyns working towards the same goal who ultimately love each other and their family more than they do anything else.  The insistence of the film to tell this tale at a quantum leap diminishes the multi-faceted qualities of its main protagonists.

Not being knowledgeable regarding the actual ages of the historical figures, from my vantage point--and this I am afraid is definitely a sign of age--I felt the characters to be so overly and fragilely young.  William Stafford, Mary's love interest, may well need Clearasil--I could well imagine him in a junior varsity basketball uniform--all arms and legs--than in the velvet garb of Uncle Howard's page.  Likewise for Portman who, although resplendent in her verdant green gowns that show off her creamy skin and her downy profile, neck and d&eacute;collet&eacute; to perfection, still appears sometimes frail and childish.  I can more easily imagine her stamping her feet like a willful brat than seducing and satisfying the likes of Eric Bana. Case in point--the beheading scene.  Portland reminds me of a high school Portia spouting off about the `quality of mercy' rather than a grown woman who had used her wiles to entertain and bamboozle the king of England.  In a more mature sense, Johansson appears way too many times striding or riding purposefully in and out of the castle.  Like an overprotective St. Bernard, her persona as nurturer and semi-saint seems overdone.

Bottom line?  The 2008 film, ""The Other Boleyn Girl,"" concentrates on one aspect of the Gregory mega bestseller.  Pitting one Boleyn girl against the other, it succeeds in depicting a Tudor England of great intrigue--engineered by scheming families who did not play it safe and were literally willing to put their necks on the line.  The frenetic pace of the film offers only enough time to create outline caricatures of each of the main personalities rather than nuanced flesh and blood women who skewed the hypocritical rules professed by their faith to snare future family glory.  Natalie Portman as Anne Boleyn gives an interesting performance as the doomed pseudo queen that needs more taming than a shrew by any other name. Is there any wonder as to why women carry with them the reputation of being manipulative and deceitful after viewing such degradation? The scene where Anne gives birth to Elizabeth especially seethes with poignancy; the sense of uselessness blatantly apparent--how dare you birth a female and not a male?  What a sad history we women share--enough to keep all the psychiatrists in the world busy until the next millennium with the theme of little self-esteem and worthlessness alone.  Gold diggers?  I guess one had little choice.  Voyeur that I am, I wish the five years Anne kept Henry at bay portrayed in the novel in much detail was given due diligence here.  Recommended to those who enjoy yet another telling of this Tudor soap opera with nary a qualm with regard to historical authenticity.

3405280,4,B0017APPSE,"King Henry VIII's (Eric Bana) growing tired of first wife, the Spanish Katherine of Aragon (Ana Torrent) since she cannot bear him a son. The Duke of Norfolk (Morrissey) and Sir Thomas Boleyn (Rylance) offer young Anne Boleyn (Portman) a 'commission'.  If she becomes the King's mistress, she will both advance the family's interests and secure a ducal marriage for herself.

Anne's mother objects with the review's tagline and more, but Anne's intrigued.  Unfortunately, the men's advice on a hunt to 'ride strong' gets the King injured and ill-disposed to Anne, who showed herself a better rider than he.  When just-wed Mary (Scarlett Johansson) is sent to tend the King, he fancies her instead and sends for her to court.

Soon, Mary's husband is disposed of, and King and younger Boleyn girl are having a torrid affair.  When Mary lies in with Henry's child, the balance switches.  Anne is brought in ""only to keep the King's interest on Mary.""

The following film details Henry's subsequent 'beguilement' by the older Boleyn sister, and Anne's rise and fall.  While the historical accuracy isn't there, it's an interesting tale.

Eric Bana would not have been my choice for Young Henry Tudor.  While he's handsome enough, he doesn't look the part.  Scarlett Johansson was the performer who I thought luminous in this tale of court intrigue.

I suspect this film will get the nod at the 2008 Oscars for Costuming. The garb was gorgeous and beautifully detailed. The film's a treat just for Ren Faire junkies just to see what everyone's wearing.

""The Other Boleyn Girl"" is based on the historical fiction of the same title by Philippa Gregory.",1204329600,,1647,4.941818181818181
3405281,3,B0017APPSE,"""The Other Boleyn Girl"" opens ominously, develops into a dark tale of nasty sibling rivalry, and ends with virtually every character crying bitter tears. I was essentially watching a medieval soap opera, one that lulled me into that gray area between fascination and repulsion. Yes, this movie has that effect, and that makes me wonder if it really achieved what it wanted to achieve. Was it supposed to be a nonstop gloom fest, or were the filmmakers actually trying to say something important? I honestly don't know. I'm well aware that this is a representation of historical events, and as such, I know that the circumstances leading to Anne Boleyn's death were not pleasant. So that begs the question of why this movie had to be made in the first place; if nothing even remotely upbeat could be made up for the sake of the screenplay, maybe it would have been better to just leave the idea alone.

That being said, I did find a lot of the film compelling, especially in terms of the relationship between the Boleyn siblings. Initially, Anne, Mary, and George (Natalie Portman, Scarlett Johansson, and Jim Sturgess) are close-knit, more like best friends than relatives. But things quickly change, especially for Mary and Anne. Around the same time Mary weds William Carey (Benedict Cumberbatch), we learn that the Queen of England--Katherine of Aragon (Ana Torrent)--has given birth to a stillborn child, and worse yet, that child was a boy. This is unacceptable to King Henry VIII (Eric Bana), who only wants a male heir to the throne. The Duke of Norfolk (David Morrissey) sees this as a perfect opportunity for the Boleyn family, especially for his niece, Anne: she can be the first to offer herself as the King's mistress, and with a little luck this will lead to the birth of a son.

With a little coaxing, Anne accepts the offer. The King arrives at the Boleyn estate within no time at all, and at first, it does seem as if he's taken a liking to Anne. Consider the moment before an afternoon of hunting, in which Anne announces she'll be riding her own horse: ""Without a man,"" asks the King, ""how will you hold onto your horse?"" ""The same way you do, my Lord,"" she answers coyly. ""With my thighs."" But when an accident injures the King on the hunt, he's introduced to Mary, who tends to his wounds with care. He finds her fascinating, so much so that he wishes her to come to his castle and become the Queen's Lady in Waiting. He also appoints her husband to be a Gentleman of the Privy Council. Thus the seeds of jealously are planted within Anne, who believes her sister purposely stole the King away from her.

The jealously becomes full-fledged resentment when Mary exposes Anne's secret marriage to Henry Percy (Oliver Coleman). Mary insists that she did it for Anne's own good, since Henry was already betrothed to another woman. But Anne hardly feels grateful, especially since she's now been exiled to France. Not long after, Mary discovers that she's pregnant with the King's child; when she's confined to bed rest after a near miscarriage, Anne is brought back with the hope that she'll be able to ""amuse"" the King and to keep his thoughts on Mary. This, of course, doesn't happen. If anything, her resolve to win the King's affections has greatly increased. By the time Mary gives birth, Anne convinces the King that his newborn son is nothing more than a bastard child, and therefore unsuitable to be the heir to the throne.

As you can see, ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" paints a very unflattering picture of Anne Boleyn. Whether or not this is historically accurate, I have no idea. What I do know is that, as far as a film is concerned, there's only so much backstabbing and betrayal I can handle in one sitting. The birth of Mary's son kick starts a series of even more deplorable acts on Anne's part. She seduces the King with every glance. She refuses to sleep with him until she's Queen, and in order for that to happen, she has Katherine humiliated into annulling her marriage. Anne also persuades the King to cut off any political and religious ties with Rome and the Catholic Church, essentially tearing England apart. And all because she's mad at her sister for being noticed by the King.

The last thirty minutes are too dark and depressing to describe. I will say that, by the time Anne realizes the harm she's caused, every character is lost in despair and things just keep going from bad to worse. It doesn't matter whether or not this happened in real life--my comments are solely focused on what I saw in the film, and I'm really not sure that I wanted to see any of it. Was it really necessary for this film to be so dreary, even if the subject matter was anything but cheerful? It really seemed as if the filmmakers were purposely milking the melodrama, forcing the audience into an almost constant state of apprehension. It wasn't at all a pleasant feeling. Still, I did find some of the material was convincing, if only just; the connection between the Boleyn siblings is fascinating, even when times are darkest for them. One gets the sense that even in midst of deceit and emotional turmoil, they will always love each other, no matter what. This is probably the only thing stopping me from giving ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" an even lower star rating--everything else about it is just too overwrought.",1204243200,,5338,4.674468085106383
3405282,2,B0017APPSE,"Despicable people doing contemptible things have never equaled solid entertainment. The Other Boleyn Girl is not without its highlights - those being negligible and spread out amongst poorly-paced, drawn-out bits of heavily censored romance. Natalie Portman delivers a worthwhile performance as the ill-fated Anne Boleyn, but the rest of the too-beautiful cast doesn't ever seem to authentically fit in to their lavish period piece costumes. Undoubtedly after viewing The Other Boleyn Girl, the audience will probably only want to research what truly happened.

When the Queen of England, Katherine of Eragon (Ana Torrent) is unable to produce a male heir for impatient King Henry Tudor (Eric Bana), he becomes besotted by Anne Boleyn (Natalie Portman), who is intentionally placed before him to allow her weak father Thomas and her conniving uncle, the Duke of Norfolk, to remain in good favor with royalty.

During the King's visit, Anne's competitive personality finds Henry becoming injured, and being taken care of by her sister, Mary Boleyn (Scarlett Johansson). The greedy King soon falls for the dewy-eyed sister, and she is whisked back to the court for his pleasure. Not long after, Mary is pregnant, and Anne Boleyn secretly gets married to nobleman Henry Percy. Anne is banished when the Duke of Norfolk discovers her spontaneous and unplanned marriage, but within a mere two months is brought back to keep the King occupied while Mary is bedridden.

Anne soon finds herself infatuated with potential power and control over the King, and manages to have Mary sent back to the countryside and Katherine of Aragon banished for false infidelities. Henry eventually breaks away from the Catholic Church when he arranges an annulment with his wife and marries Anne. Despite her promises, she is unable to produce a male heir for Henry, and he begins to regret his decisions over Katherine and his country, which leads to...well, the rest as they say, is history.

The Other Boleyn Girl is not entirely a history lesson, but it certainly is about as much fun. Which is to say that the beginning plods along with ruthless details on trivial things, and the love triangle that forms is predictable and blas. Perhaps the most unappealing factor with this film is its dislikeable characters. Mary is initially at fault for dispensing misery to her sister, causing her to be banished; after this, she never really feels like a leading force of good, but is sadly the only character the film steers the audience into rooting for. After Anne becomes jealous of her sister's success with the King, she is immediately an antagonist, wheeling and dealing to increase her power and remove her competition. The King himself is portrayed as an uncontrollably lustful and self-absorbed despot who thinks of himself before his kingdom, and presiding over all of these miserly characters is the Duke of Norfolk, who pulls the strings of his brother Thomas and plays with the lives and romances of Anne and Mary.

With the leads dressed in luxuriant costumes (Portman looks like Queen Amidala from Star Wars) and being traded like cattle, The Other Boleyn Girl goes to great lengths to show off beautiful people frolicking about in medieval fetes. Outside of Portman, who does a sensational job in a poorly penned role, the remaining cast feels horribly misplaced, like wolves in sheep's clothing. By the conclusion, which perhaps unintentionally perfectly sets up for the film Elizabeth, all we really want to do is read about actual facts, and clear our minds of this heavily flourished film.

3405283,3,B0017APPSE,"This piece of pulp fiction is a mixed bag. It seems to be made for those who like history and love a racy tale, but don't want to see any nudity and don't mind a screenplay that doesn't know where it's going and is in no hurry to get there. Cursed with a story that too often sinks into being just another generic melodrama, the movie has Natalie Portman and Scarlett Johansson all dressed up with no place, at least on screen, to get naked. Worse, it's not even good eye candy. Though the costumes are lavish (especially on Portman), the film displays them, as well as everything else, in a color palette that's as drab as its story.

When I read&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/the-book/dp/1416560602/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">the book</a>&nbsp;I was a little bothered by its repetitive story and inaccurate history. The movie is worse on both counts, and in the process also cuts the novel's intriguing glimpse into what life was like back in the 1500s. Its many slow-moving scenes give the gals plenty of chances to comb the lice from their hair, but, unlike in the novel, never once do they do it. The book also certainly didn't pretend that women were anything more than what they were back then -- unimportant and often humiliated, used as pawns by the men of the family. In the movie, however, Anne and Mary's mother makes more than one speech with a modern, feminist take.

Despite all that, I must say that Portman impressed me. She knows how to play someone with a nervous, desperate obsession. Good ol' Queen Amidala is really the only reason I gave this even three stars.",1204243200,,1628,4.894927536231884

They also left out the facts of both trials of Katharine of Aragon and Anne. Also, Anne, Mary and George were the three youngest Boleyn children. There were two older boys that both died. And William Stafford worked for Norfolk, not Thomas Boleyn. Elizabeth Boleyn did not marry Thomas for love, either. Elizabeth was 2 years old when her mother was executed, not an infant. She wasn't rescued by her aunt, Mary Boleyn, and never lived with her unrecognized half-siblings at the Stafford farm. She was already living at another palace, i believe Hampton Court (previously Wolseys home) which i think was designated the royal nursery. And Jane Parker? Well, she ended up being a pawn of Norfolks later on as well. AND. Anne had grown up at foreign courts, she wasn't exiled as young woman to France. She WAS sent to Hever Castle after the whole betrothal mess with Henry Percy. They left out the facts that George was rumored to be gay as well, which I suppose was to make the film more palatable to bigots and anyhow, why bother to mention it when the movie is half fiction. Also, the rape of Anne Boleyn is fiction- and i find it disgusting that rape is used for shock value. While were at it, its rumored that Henry raped Mary.
