3531513,4,B001DJ7PU0,"I've seen this movie last year at the Festival Rojo Sangre in Buenos Aires. This is a great movie showing us a big scale zombie breakthrough from the eyes of the human survivors. The key of the film is that this is not a movie about the zombie invasion itself, it's not a classic zombie movie the way Romero usually does. What the film shows is the behavior of the survivors, the way they try to stay alive, getting supplies, guard their refuges. I'v really enjoyed this movie, it really made me think about this side of the story: what if you were there?
Don't get this movie if you just want to see some blood flowing or green looking zombies walking around like some reviewers seem to like. But if you like the horror genre in general, you'll enjoy this humble masterpiece.
I can't talk about the DVD release, but that's my opinion on the film.",1224288000,10,847,4.401273885350318

Terrible acting - only a HANDFULL of zombies - and jerky video that will make you feel sick.

3531515,5,B001DJ7PU0,"I first saw 'The Zombie Diaries' at the Austin Film Festival in October 2007.  My review is based on the screening and not on the DVD itself or any of the bonus materials, as at the time of writing the film is still on pre-order.

The film is similar in premise to George Romero's film 'Diary of the Dead' but this is probably where the similarities end.  The Zombie Diaries breaks new ground in the 'found footage' style of movie.  Before this, Cannibal Holocaust and The Blair Witch project were the two biggies in the genre.

Recent efforts such as Romero's film and Cloverfield fail where this film succeeds because they never concentrate on realism or believable performances.  With The Zombie Diaries you don't really even notice the 'acting' because people behave the way real people would in such a post apocalyptic scenario.  Many critical reviews have also noted this as the film's strength, and I admire Kevin Gates and Michael Bartlett (The two directors) for choosing to approach the film from this angle, as opposed to taking the easy way out and making a typical film where all loose ends tie up nicely and almost too conveniently.

Other points of note are the excellent score by Stephen Hoper, and the brilliant use of sound design all the way through the film.  This is what made the film [.REC] so successful, and the filmmakers hit the nail on the head in this film as well.

One point of note is that the film has three separate stories (diaries) that are cut together in the same way as Tarantino's Pulp Fiction.  It means the audience is challenged throughout and it never descends into the same three people arguing in the woods which is would have if it was one group of people for 90 minutes.

I do have some minor criticisms.  I would like to have seen more of the undead world, and more zombies.  The zombies are always there, lurking, but not in the hordes of 100s or 1000s like you might expect.  But this is a budgetary constraint.  Remember Aliens only had 5 full scale alien models!

The low budget is obvious, but the zombie makeup is excellent.  Hats off to all involved in making this production, and also for essentially blowing away Romero's film.  Beating someone at their own game is tough.  Romero invented the zombie genre.  So well done.  A great and entertaining film.  Highly recommended.",1223078400,15,2333,4.65036674816626
3531516,2,B001DJ7PU0,"I'm always keen to support indie horror movies but its a struggle to recommend this. The basic premise of a bird flu pandemic is slightly dated now, and the idea that it would lead to the dead rising is a stretch to the credulity of even the most imaginative horror fan.
  Having said that the first horror set piece is very well handled and quite effective.
 Sadly the second two instalments are far less successful with major problems in pacing and narrative. I suspect many zombie movie fans are more interested in suspense and visceral thrills and here too the film falls flat after the first encounter.
 Acting is on a par with most micro-budget exploitation flicks,which is a shame since the script attempts to be character based. Unfortunately there are too many characters and they all seem to be the same basic personality
so it becomes difficult to remember- or care- who was who.
 I'm afraid I didn't enjoy this production much at all and have no desire to see it again",1220486400,10,980,4.641618497109826

I'd actually give it 2.5 stars if possible since I didn't really like or dislike it.  It's not a memorable flick nor one I'd really watch again so take that for what's it worth.

It was just so boring, like standing in line to get your autotag renewal, or standing in line to vote.  No good emotion, no good storyline, no good acting, no good effects, just nothing to be memorable.  Contrary to popular thought, I like zombie movies because of the humanity, the emotion, the concern I feel for characters facing death of loved ones, people coming back from the dead, and the end of life on earth....really heavy duty emotional stuff!

Especially when the the ""Shaky Camera"" is done at night and I can't even see what is going on, that makes it that much worse.

I'm pretty sure that all the locations they shot at were just places the actors worked at in real life, or their own homes, or public parks.  I can usually find something I like in every zombie film I watch but this was just awful!

The photography? Well this is one of those places where teenagers on a $15 dollar budget do a better job.

3531542,3,B001DJ7PU0,"Set in England during a world-wide viral infection, this documentary-style film records the rise of the undead from the videocams of several survivor groups. It charts the early days of the plague, right through to the last days of the apocalypse.

<sigh> Yet, another film done in the perspective of such films as ""The Blair Witch Project"", ""Cloverfield"", ""Paranormal Activity"", and ""Diary of the Dead"". That's one thing from the get-go that had me against this movie. As much as I love zombie movies, I have a strong dislike for movies filmed like this. Why? Most of the time, the cameras shake so badly that you can't focus on what's going on and, a good bit of that time you're watching, all you see is black. Sad thing is you never really get much out of movies filmed in this manner. However, that's one thing that Zombie Diaires had in it's favor. The camera work wasn't quite that bad and was mostly tolerable.

Course, after viewing the film, Zombie Diaries had alot of pluses to it. The acting was good, better than some other low-budget films I've seen of late. At times, the movie was extremely effective at being creepy. The story, although typical for a zombie flick, was alright. Effects weren't too bad.

As far as Zombie Diaries being better than 28 Days Later? Um, sadly, no. As far as it being the most realistic zombie film ever made? Again, sadly, no. Okay, how about it being a bloody powerhouse of a movie? Maybe. I will give credit where it's due. It was pretty creepy at times, folks. These zombies, like the ones in ""The Dead"", were quiet!

Overall, Zombie Diaries was an okay movie. There's alot of room for improvement, however. We'll see if they deliver that in Zombie Diaires 2.",1345593600,,1708,4.627062706270627

3531545,1,B001DJ7PU0,"The packaging is the best part of this movie.  There is not a single new idea in this movie.
I wish I could say that the make-up and gore was top notch.  The hand cameras they used were
always in motion, the make-up looked ok for the brief instants the zombies were observed.
These zombies are the slow, stupid kind.  Some people in the movie are more evil than the zombies.
The young people making the zombie documentary were typical 20-21 year olds.
The segments that made this movie are not shown in order, which is a pulp fiction borrowed idea.
Rather than buy or rent this movie, one might find a very greasy diner with left-over food, and pay
to eat beans with congealed grease on it. That would be a better investment.

3531546,1,B001DJ7PU0,"When I saw on the box that this movie was ""better than Danny Boyle's 28 Days Later"" I had to watch this. Whoever wrote that must hate 28 Days Later because it has fast zombies or for some personal reason, because this movie comes nowhere near that movie. This movie box art, both front and back, pictures a city with zombies in it. Anyone would think that this movie is at least filmed in some sort of city environment or town or something, but no! Most of this movie is filmed in the woods, and there is nothing good about this movie at all.

There are 3 separate groups that have ""diaries"" about them. The first group was the group that filmed during the outbreak, the second was a group of three people who were scavenging for supplies, and the third was a group who were staying at a house (near the woods I might add) and helping each other survive. The second group had potential for a good story to be woven around them, but their story just ended in a bland ""running through the woods"" kind of scene.

From bad acting to terrible locations, this movie has to be the worst movie, let alone zombie movie, I have seen in a long time.",1334361600,,1138,4.288372093023256
3531547,1,B001DJ7PU0,I really like zombie movies and like independent films. The cover art got my attention. Unfortunately the cover art/disc art has nothing to do with the film and nothing even close either one is shown in the movie.

I don't know what the reviewers were thinking. I'll probably sell this pile of crap. I only gave it 2 stars because it is at least a zombie movie.,1332288000,,478,4.042105263157895
3531559,3,B001DJ7PU0,"Told in a non-linear manner, featuring video footage of events supposedly shot in real time, The Zombie Diaries (2005) attempts to convey a sense of realism, as it focuses on the adventures of various individuals during some kind of viral outbreak.  More than most movies, viewer expectations may play a greater factor in how much you appreciate the film, which seems quite realistic in some aspects, and totally ridiculous in others.  Those seeking a frenetic heated battle with a vicious hoard of the undead, will be severely disappointed, but if you stick with it to the end, the film may leave you with something more to think about than you typical zombie movie.

Set in Britain, The Zombie Diaries has three segments.  The first, features a film crew shooting a documentary in a small village, lays the foundation for what is to come, as a worldwide outbreak of a virus that reanimates the dead into zombielike creatures, has taken place and has apparently reached Britain.

Segment Two follows a husband and wife, who are travelling in their car, with a hitchhiker.  Cruising through rural areas, armed with a gun, they attempt to scavenge what they can from the surrounding towns.

Segment Three concerns a group of survivors living on a farm.  They are organized and armed, and conduct daily sweeps to kill any zombies in the area.  Unfortunately the danger is not confined to external sources.  This segment ties up some loose ends, and sets up thing for the sequel, The Zombie Diaries 2.

An entire film consisting of live action video is something of a double edged sword.  Image quality often isn't the greatest, and the shaky images become a drag after a while.  On the plus side, the story itself has a certain edge of realism, as there aren't the traditional camera cuts, and the action is often happening in a continuous take, and the acting flows along in real time.  The results are kind of a mixed bag, with some seeming real and natural, and others not so much.

While the live video aspect is very realistic in terms of capturing actual events, there are times, such as when danger arises, where the premise that someone would still be shooting video at that time, isn't very credible.  The movie is also realistic in regards to how people might really behave in such a crisis, as humans are not always cooperative or benevolent.  People are certainly capable of noble and heroic behavior, but when the force of law no longer exists, there are certainly those whose dark side will emerge in order to survive.

The Zombie Diaries is scary for its depiction of the undead, but that's nothing new.  What is perhaps the more shocking and memorable element of the film, is that the most horrible creatures, the ones committing the most heinous depraved acts, are in fact human.  This is not very pleasant to contemplate, and may be why the film is not very well regarded.  However, it is because The Zombie Diaries may give rise to some thought, that it may resonate so profoundly with some.",1327104000,,3008,4.746153846153846
3531560,3,B001DJ7PU0,"Some spoilers, not many.

This is a British zombie film made in 2006.  It's gotten some rave reviews, but I think it's mediocre at best.  It plods along really, and just isn't scary. I'm giving it three stars, and one of those stars is for the British accents. The plot is that this movie is an amalgamation of several videocams documenting the debut and spread of the undead.  Several survivor groups are involved. Characters drive around, rummage through abandoned buildings and look for food and radio parts. Occasionally zombies attack, and one of the survivors is a psycho.  Really, he's not worth waiting around for.

3531563,4,B001DJ7PU0,"The British outbreak and effects of a mysterious pandemic, as captured on 3 different camcorders, by at least 3 operators, reveals the horrific details. As usual, the zombies aren't the human survivor's only threat; after all, humans are really the most accomplished killers on earth - much worse than those pesky ol' zombies.

The most realistic zombie film I've seen (as of 4/11), ""Zombie Diaries"" is roughly a blend of Romero's ""Diary of the Dead"" and ""The Blair Witch Project."" More believable than the former, but not quite as convincing as the latter, this is a very effective, low budget zombie thriller.

The actors improvise throughout, and operate the cameras, most of the time, to create a natural, matter-of-fact feel, that works well. However, if 'herky-jerky"" handheld camerawork upsets you, this film will make you hurl!

Not lots of gore, but the zombies look believable and the horror is plentiful. Plus, the excellent ambient noise soundtrack helps intensify, and sustain an appropriate sense of dread and impending doom, from beginning to end.

My only complaint is that the editing in the 3 chapter structure of the movie, made keeping track of the many characters, difficult. But while distracting, it didn't completely ruin the unsettling effect of the film, and once I caught on, my confusion eased. Later viewings revealed the brilliance of this under-appreciated addition to the deliciously bloated, ""flesh-eating zombie"" genre.

If you decide to watch ""Zombie Diaries,"" for the first time, I suggest paying real close attention to the actors names and faces, writing down the character's names and taking additional notes, if you need to, or just turning out the lights, as well as your mind, and letting the horror engulf you.

By the way, it should be easy to find this one for a couple of bucks, or less, so if you like zombies, hunt down a used copy and sample it's tasty terrors.

Note: the 4 stars are a genre rating. I'm not comparing this movie to the ground breaking greats in film history.

One more thing (added 11/09/11): after reading several of the other customer reviews, the 1 star reviews seem to reflect disappointment that ""Zombie Diaries"" wasn't what they were expecting. True, it isn't an action packed mainstream horror movie and it does require the viewer to pay close attention to everything that's going on, to get it, but if you're up for a more thoughtful extension of the Romero zombie film themes, check this one out.",1303776000,,2472,4.954106280193237

3531565,5,B001DJ7PU0,"Most independent horror films - especially those in the zombie subgenre - are nothing more than FX reels or [in most cases] misguided pocket-cam produced fodder that does nothing but detract from the genre.

Zombie Diaries is a well made and amazingly well-written non-linear story of a British zombie outbreak, which weaves together 3 individual stories [as video diary entries if you will...] without feeling forced.

The DVD cover misrepresents the story, as it makes it look like a UK-version of ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin is running through the ruined streets of London shotgun-headshotting any zed in his path... and that is not at all representative of the contents of the DVD case.

Shot Cinma vrit [ie., hand-held first-person camera perspective, ala Rec or Blair Witch Project], Zombie Diaries is more of a story of the people trying to survive a world gone to hell.

I will refrain from spoiling the story, but I will say this: most people praise Night of the Living Dead for focusing on the survivors rather than the threat of the recently deceased returning to ""life"", and Zombie Diaries dives deep into the survivors -- specifically who could and how would they survive -- better than any genre movie I've seen in recent years.

It takes effort to make Blair Witch and Cloverfield look acceptable and Zombie Diaries goes the extra mile to do so.  The film is even cut up into chapters and pieces of chapters of wholy unrelated groups of unlikable whiners, skipping between them all forward and back in time.  It's not just trashy film, it's trashy, incoherent film.

Don't expect any happy endings here either.  It also takes the tiresomely well trodden path where armed, psycho humans are the bigger villains of the piece.

3531578,4,B001DJ7PU0,"A deadly virus has torn through London and the surrounding villages. Several groups of survivors struggle to stay alive as the infected begin to cannibalize the living. With nothing left but the camera at their side, they begin to document the events as they occur. These are their tapes. Taking the same ""found-footage"" approach as CLOVERFIELD or REC before it, THE ZOMBIE DIARIES passes itself off as factual video evidence of a zombie outbreak as it occurs. The film is much more successful at achieving this goal than the similarly titled DIARY OF THE DEAD, offering a much more natural look and a sense of spontaneity that was lacking in Romero's attempt. Unlike any of the other films of its type, THE ZOMBIE DIARIES assembles a collection of tapes that were taken by several groups of survivors, which gives it a range of different stories and personal accounts of the outbreak from various perspectives. Kevin Gates and Michael Bartlett further sell this idea by using multiple cameras and damaging some of the footage to create an individuality in each video diary. While the approach is a unique and interesting use of the ""found-footage"" style, in the end, it is still a zombie film, and must succeed on this level as well. There is very little gore or gut-munching to be found throughout the runtime, and the slow pacing and shaky camerawork will be unappealing to many viewers. Instead, the most effective scares are built in these slower moments, where the survivors comb through houses and buildings looking for food or refuge but only find more of the infected! Because the film is pieced together from various sources, it is sure to catch criticism for its lack of continuity and non-linear storytelling, but fans of the recent trend in faked documentary Horror films will find this to be a much more satisfying and realistic effort than the disappointing DIARY OF THE DEAD.

There is little point to quite a few scenes in the movie, as well as to the movie itself.

One scene that included ""brains"" on the ground had us both wondering, ""Was that canned cherries?""

There is a huge bounce in the timeline that made no sense, three groups of characters that made you cheer for the zombies, and a setting that was bland and uninteresting.  You lose characters who they go back to at the end for no apparent reason.  A lot of ""What?"" moments throughout.  The writing lacked a basic knowledge of what people would do in a situation like this, going from one extreme to the other.

I won't name them, but the blurbs for Zombie Diaries include: ""The Best Zombie Film Ever!"", ""Better than Danny Boyle's 28 Days Later"", ""The Most Realistic zombie film ever made!"", and ""A Bloody Powerhouse of a Movie"".  Evidently they were watching a different film than I was because to say this is the better than 28 Days Later is the most laughable and appallingly inaccurate blurb I think I've ever seen.

Zombie Diaries, not to be confused with Diary of the Dead, borrows George Romero's filming style by shooting this film with hand held cameras from the perspective of three groups of survivors of a zombie plague in England.  The difference is that Romero knew went to back out of a scene and give you full view, whereas the makers of this film are content to film everything with a camera work that threatens to repulse the viewer with vertigo.

The plot, if one can call it that, concerns a zombie outbreak that begins to spread around the world.  Three different groups of survivors are followed.  Their stories begin separately and jump unexpectedly from one to the other, until they finally intersect later in the film.  Early on the film shows promise.  We see a trio of survivors pull into an apparently abandoned town as they scavenge for food and supplies.  This is the best part of the film.  There is a sense of eerie creepiness from the deathly silent town and you feel that this is what a zombie outbreak would really be like.

Unfortunately it goes down hill from there.  The all-too-few encounters with the zombies are difficult to see because they are generally shot at night and when you add the jumpy camera movement, it becomes aggravating to say the least.  And seriously, what moron is going to continue to shoot his video camera with a horde of zombies coming his way?  There is no development at all to the characters.  We know the first group of four is part of a news team who has come out to a remote country farm to do interview a farmer but beyond that, we learn almost nothing about the characters.

Worst of all, the last fifteen or twenty minutes of the film goes completely off the tracks with a sub-plot about two of the survivors being psychotic nutcases who end up a greater threat to the rest of the people than the zombies themselves.  This idiotic subplot made a bad movie even worse.  Oh, and there is tough looking hombre on the cover of the DVD holding a shotgun and pistol, marching towards a group of zombies.  Nothing remotely resembling that scene appears in the film.  Just another blatant hook.  Trust me, don't take the bait!",1258588800,2,2674,4.585263157894737
3531603,3,B001DJ7PU0,"THE ZOMBIE DIARIES

It seems that the big thing to do in horror now a days is the hand held POV style of filmmaking as to make it seems more real. Ever since The Blair Witch thing I guess people have thought it is the thing to do, I don't think so. Some of these films have been good but I do not know if any have been classic. Of course I could be wrong because I have not seen all of them but from what I have seen most are just ok. Sadly I would say that this falls into that category, this is far from horrible but it is not a classic. On the flip side it is much better than I thought it would be. Still this is the second zombie film from D.E. with first being Romero's ""Diary of the Dead"", so it should have been a little better.

This film is somewhat of a zombie Pulp Fiction in editing only of course because it does not reach that type of status. Still it is three different stories mixed together rather easily because transitions are smooth. The story is easy enough to follow as the world is being infected with a virus it makes its way to Europe, England to be exact. With that people are actually caught off guard since most did not thing it would reach England, but it did. So the three stories take place all within the same general area around London I believe, three different groups of survivors. All of which want to document what is going on in their world, one of which actually started out as a documentary.

One story follows a group of documentary filmmakers as the event takes place while the others are all about survivors, one of which likes to make time for target practice. This while not original is an interesting tale of three unlucky teams of people. Some have what it takes to live but others will not make it, bad luck, breaking mentally, or what ever leads to the downfall of some. Writer/director/producers Kevin Gates and Michael Bartlett did a good job over all with this film, the stories are interesting and it must have been difficult to juggle three stories from the POV style format. Still the characters or at least some are flat but I guess that does not mean much in a zombie flick.

As for the zombies in this film they do look good and while there is not to much gore when there is some it is good. One shot in particular when they are eating a dude that was sitting in a car looks crazy real, at least to me. Other than that this is just every other zombie tale out there but from three different points of view. The thing I can't get is why people are always complaining about this style of filmmaking, don't like it don't watch it. Also if this happened in real life this is actually how it would be documented.

Any way this is not the best zombie film ever made but I didn't hate it and actually thought it was pretty good. The best way to go into this film is to know that things don't pick up for a while and go in with low to no expectations. I did that and found it to be entertaining enough, plus there are some cool parts in it. Some guy has a female zombie tied up and may or may not have been doing things with her. Also the part with some guy running to his [what he thinks] saving grace when he realizes there other people is excellent. Do I recommend this film is the question and the answer would be yes, but I think zombie lovers are best suited for this not the casual fan.",1256947200,4,3344,4.170278637770898

3531606,3,B001DJ7PU0,"The Zombie Diaries was largely disappointing.  Unlike most, I was fascinated by Diary of the Dead - still am after 4 viewings.  Maybe I'm enamored with cinema verite but I find that this style of film, especially with horror, lends a more intense experience.  This ""first person"" perspective is one of few effects that causes an emotional reaction in this movie watcher.

That being said, TZD is a fair example of the genre.  There are some intense scenes (the film crew investigating the farm house in the beginning of the film, for example), but largly TZD falls into the typical ""British"" style of storytelling - long on dialogue and characterization, short on action and shocks.  Not that this is entirely a bad thing!  Compared to a lot of horror films that are just a string of set pieces, Britain manages to inject some intelligence to the genre but often at the expence of excitement.  Some films manage to buck this fault: ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Cottage/dp/B0013D8LLS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Cottage</a>"" and ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Severance/dp/B000SM6FM2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Severance</a>"" come to mind as recent examples of really outstanding British horror with interesting characters, dialogue and buckets of blood.  TZD, however, suffers the same fate as most British horror films - long on talking, short on action and suspense.  TZD can't quite manage to create the feeling of civilization's collapse.  Village streets are empty, but there's little feeling of menace; perhaps because they couldn't afford to hire the extras (or create them via CGI) needed to create the ""zombie hordes.""  So, most of the zombies are encountered at night and/or at long distance; maybe to cover up the use of the same people again and again. Instead, the film replaces the zombie menace with a human one.

Now, Romero used the same tactic in several films, but never gave up the idea that the zombie was the constant danger that lurked underneath the interhuman conflict.  TZD loses this; the human villans become the primary threat, the zombies are just irratating annoyances that the protagonists have little trouble dealing with.  Thereby lays my 3-star rating.",1254441600,,2276,5.556521739130435
3531607,3,B001DJ7PU0,"I probably don't have to tell you that this independent horror film isn't about zombies writing in their diaries.  However, I should point out that the cover art has little to do with anything that happens in the film.  In such a case you might conclude that this film is a complete waste of time since most DVD cases with exceptionally enticing and irritatingly deceptive cover art are stinkers.  In this case that's not so clear.  It depends on what you're looking for.  As usual, I'll have to chew this into smaller pieces.

-OH GOD NO!!  NOT THE HANDI-CAM AGAIN!!!
That's right.  This English film is shot using hand-held video cameras much like ""Blair Witch"" and ""Clover Field"".  Unlike those films, the cameras are handled with some competence.  Though I did get a bit sea sick at moments, overall it was tolerable.  Other than the adept use of the cameras there was nothing original about this idea.  Strangely and mistakenly, there is some very tight in-camera editing while nobody is holding it.

-PLEASE GET ON WITH IT
The actors do about as well as you'd expect from a low budget independent horror film.  However, they often aren't given much to do but drive around, rummage through abandoned buildings and look for resources.  We get to know them to a certain degree and they all act fairly natural most of the time.  Though probably a realistic approach, it hardly makes for compelling viewing.  This film really does take its time getting to the zombie part of the diary.

-PLAUSABILITY TAKES A HOLIDAY.
Aside from the whole idea of zombies, there are problems with plausibility in ""Zombie Diaries"". The biggest problem is one that threatens the entire concept of the film; three separate and unrelated groups of people are forced together by events beyond their control and all of them happen to be video recording their ordeals.  That's just a bit too convenient a coincidence.  But hey, I'll buy into the premise.  Perhaps the thing that bugged me the most was the inconsistent response to the slow moving and physically inept zombies.  At one moment a man can push them over and smash their heads in with little resistance and the next moment he's running aimlessly in fear, screaming and getting bitten.  If I could walk up to them, push them over and smash there heads in, I'm never running frantically from the buggers.  Escape would not be a problem.

-IT'S STILL CREEPY
Despite my criticisms, ""Zombie Diaries"" has a scary edge to it.  The first half hour is especially frightening even though very little seams to be happening.  When we do see the antagonists, it is uber creepy.  Even though the zombies moved slowly, they also moved very quietly.  This kept me on edge and proved fatal to the protagonists a couple of times.  Though I think in real life, without the limited peripheral range of a camera, you'd see these guys coming in plenty of time to act.  Regardless, I was constantly on my guard waiting for the protagonists to let their guard down or stumble into the stealthy infected.

-GIVE CREDIT WHERE IT'S DUE
Though almost completely derived from those who came before, ""Zombie Diaries"" manages to combine the ideas of it's predecessors into something new.  Perhaps the most intriguing concept this film tackles is the idea that we'd have more to fear from unfettered sociopaths than the zombies.  With a plague shutting down the normal functions of society, even the zombies become victims at these ""monsters"" hands.  They also would make survival for the average person far less probable, as if zombies weren't enough.

-THE FINAL SOLUTION
Whether or not people should see this movie depends strictly on personal tastes.  This isn't exciting enough for those who crave high octane action and it isn't thought provoking enough for those who require a challenge.  It has scary and edgy moments but might not succeed upon repeat viewing.  There is good gore and some nudity but not a lot of either.  Yet it definitely has a disturbing and nightmarish mood to it.  The DVD has all the requisite extras including deleted scenes, commentary, making of and trailer.  Rental might be the way to go if you are curious.

At first - I found it confusing and even a little irritating.  I won't even put this up next to Blair Witch, but - it was really just diff' in its own way, so I came back to it a few times. And low budget never bothers me.

I've watched it about 5 times now, and have found I actually now get enjoyment out of it.  While I really like zombie films for the sake of good zombie action, I also like films that tickle around at the edges of psychological issues.

From that standpoint with what is mainly, some infrequent zombie action (almost as background filler).... I hav ended up with a movie that I will continue to pull off the shelf in between the better ones I'm waiting for.

It really is NOT for every zombie film fan out there and unless you watch or have watched LOTS of indie-zombie films, you may not like it.  So rent it first.

3531610,5,B001DJ7PU0,"""The Zombie Diaries"" takes one theme from George A Romero and carries it to its logical conclusion: the real ""bad guys"" are not the zombies but the ""normal"" humans - and, as you might expect, that's what's so disturbing about it.  But that doesn't make it a bad movie, just a movie that's a bit hard to watch.  You don't realize, however, just how bad the ""bad guys"" really are till almost the end.  Nor do you catch a common thread uniting at least two of the three plot lines until the end.  The movie is a bit disjointed because of the three distinct plot lines - the three ""Diaries"" presented as three separate videos in the process of being made.  And, as several reviewers have already pointed out, there is a definite ""Blair Witch Project"" feel to it; but that's only a flaw if you hated ""The Blair Witch Project.""  I didn't; I thought that movie was little short of great.  As for the acting in ""The Zombie Diaries,"" it was first rate - because it was believable.  I'm willing to bet that if someone who knew absolutely nothing about horror movies or zombies or the ""making a video"" format, this hypothetical person (let's say from another planet) would absolutely believe these three ""diaries"" were real-life events being played out.  Because the actors are acting exactly how real people encountering these events would act.  One final note: if you love lots of blood and gore, this is not for you.  I've never before seen so little blood and gore in a zombie movie.  But, believe me, it's just as scary as any zombie movie I've ever seen.  And a lot more disturbing.",1249776000,2,1577,4.530035335689046
3531611,3,B001DJ7PU0,"The Zombie Diaries is basically Blair Witch but with zombies instead of... well, nothing. That sentence alone will probably already tell you if you'll like it or not.

It's not a bad film; it's the story of three groups, all with video cameras, recording their experiences during a zombie outbreak in Great Britain. The three seperate stories all co-mingle at the end. The problem is it has 3 HUGE flaws:

1: There really isn't any reason for these people to be recording all this. They are literally recording themselves about 80% or more of the time with very little explanation as to why or, indeed, how since they don't seem to have extra film, electricity or batteries. There's really only three times in the film I could see people actually filming the events happening. It gets ridiculous when they record themselves having day to day conversations or when they are supposed to be sneaking through dangerous buildings.

2: The zombies are a sideline at best. They rarely show up and they are very much the ""lurking threat"". This isn't really a problem, any good zombie film is about the people, not the undead (with the exception of the excellent Return of the Living Dead) but the camerawork makes the living dead seem strangely mythical in nature; as if they were never really there. Plus, zombie makeup apparently stops at the neck, there's more then a few zombies with very decayed facial features only to have silky smooth Ivory soap hands.

3: The director. What? How is the director the one of the biggest flaws? Well, he and another member of the production crew apparently have been making multiple false user names and spamming message boards with how great the film is. Normally, big deal, but when you create converstaions between multiple fake indidviduals and viciously attack anyone who doesn't like the movie, you're doing WAY more harm then good. Go look up Justin-97 at IMDB to see what I mean.

Overall, the film was an excellent first try with some intriguing ideas and, with a notable exception, some really good acting and I'd certainly look out for any follow up but I can't say I could recommend it.",1249344000,,2130,4.7771739130434785

3531614,3,B001DJ7PU0,"Zombie Diaries is a zombie film under Dimension Extremes line of work. The movie is set in England, offers up old school slow moving zombies, and trades in heavy CGI for realism.

I just watched this movie twice in one week, alongside with Romero's ""Diary of the Dead"". Many have pointed out these movies are quite different and are strongly separated by budget and idea. Both films are decent, but one 'diary' comes out ahead.

Without breaking too much details the movie is in course of movements. The film shifts from different view points and locations along England to give you a better idea of what's truly going on in this infestation. Each time it changes the scenario remains the same, though the groups are quite different in actions and emotional quotients. TO be fair the movie begins with a clean understanding of the nations feelings toward other infected regions. So you do get some impending fear for what's going to happen.

What keeps this movie interesting is the realism, though at times it seems a low budget adds to that factor. Cameras rolling with amateur looking gear, but not all too bad filming  on the characters behalf. The odd thing to me is the dark ambient music during encounters, Romero's film at least explained why music has been added during 'real recordings'. Oh well, the foggy ambiance definitely helps us adjust to this morbid film.

It retains morbidity throughout without over indulging in gore, in fact I like the stylistic 'less is more' method. Seems many directors lend the gore to its success or fright factors, while this may work in squeamish films like Eli Roth's ""Hostile"" series, a film trying to achieve realism might benefit from being a little bit reserved. I think it works great for this film, when a moment is meant to puncture your memory it does so.

Overall a variety of locations are shown (though all fairly similar), you get some hope some despair, some close calls, and some shocking revelations. It has everything a movie would need to sell, with it being a stripped down title it still holds up generating many of the right elements most films need but can't provide.

Shaky cam, cam blur, night visions, clipping frame rate, you can tell this is a more realistic environment, one with earthly tones never too saturated. The acting though not superb is better then I expected, a lot of improvisatory went into this film. Watching the documentaries included on this disk really helped me understand the struggle they went through to make it, the effects crew really shined with so little time.
The doc also goes on to explain actors weren't filled in entirely on what's going to happen, so again the improvisation does nice wonders on a zombie movie like this. Keeps the horror real, fresh, and suspenseful.

Here are my opinions on the film overall:

Pros: Documentary= great idea, old school zombies are nice, ambience is also a nice addition, realism embraced by horror. Majority of the characters are likable, but maybe a bit too similar.

Cons: With as many movements/changes between characters, plots become a little watered down, a majority of the film is rationalizing or over estimating a situation. Though the movements are decent, they don't leave for a good mixture.  With as much talking that goes on no character is too boldly fleshed out, though realistic in dialect not so much on individuality.

The movie could have been worse, and by that I mean much worse. Zombie movies need room to breathe, we can't always have the same old same old. So while not epic or bold, it slides past the poor mark to the decent mark for its different takes on things (though some have been done before)",1247443200,4,3668,4.7863924050632916
3531615,5,B001DJ7PU0,"I got this film based on some positive recommendations and was not disappointed!  Not a mindless ""action"" movie like the truly aweful ""Dawn of the Dead"" remake, nor a boring docu-soap-horror like Romero's latest offering ""Diary of the Dead.""  This movie shows a stark side of human nature as well as the usual problems that occur during an end-of-the-world zombie apocalypse.

The actors are all quite good and the progression of the film is reminiscent of ""Pulp Fiction"" and in some ways, ""Memento.""  A good way to ensure the audience is paying attention and getting new things from every scene instead of the usual, obvious progression in a film like this.  The zombies are interesting too.  Lots of gore, plenty of flies (that's right, buzzing, swarming flies) as in the real world.  In fact, the appearence of the walking dead is foreshadowed by the sound of the flies.  A nice realistic touch that has never before been explored (though I'm not sure why).

As in Romero's films, it turns out that we are our own worst enemy, whether live or dead.  And sadly, the way the world is these days, it's all to obvious that this fact has never been so clear.

True the cover art depicts nothing from the movie.  BAD call.  However, if you want a realistic, non-Amero-centric view of how the world would react to a zombie uprising, give this movie a look.  You'll be listening for flies any time you're outside for at least a couple of days!

3531617,2,B001DJ7PU0,"I bought this movie based on recommendations comparing it favorably to ""28 Days Later"".  Boy was I disappointed.....

First, a minor complaint.  I hate, absolutely hate when the cover art is not based on anything from the film it is supposed to represent.  This is the case here.  You will not find anything in the film that resembles the cover art.

Also, I do not like trailers that emphasize a tiny scene as if it will be a significant portion of the film.  I this case, it's the British soldiers shown prominently in the trailer.  They are in the film for approximately .5 seconds longer than they appear in the trailer.

This movie starts out with a bunch of potential - realistic news broadcasts and interviews and such.  Then it goes into ""Blair Witch"" mode, and imitates that movie, but with the addition of zombies.  If that sounds like your idea of fun, then by all means buy it.

In reality, this is a pretty decent effort.  It was what I would consider quite realistic.  But I cannot forgive the two blatant misrepresentations that I mention.  Most people have only the trailer and the cover art to help them decide whether or not to view (or buy) the film in question - it is the studio's obligation to ensure that they be accurate.

3531619,5,B001DJ7PU0,"Scattered groups of survivors try to stay alive at the time of a terrible, fast-spreading zombie plague. The movie has us follow their demise in a documentary, shoulder-held camera fashion.

Critics for this low budget, low publicity, UK-made movie have been black and white. People either love it or reject it, there is seldom any middle-of-the-road standpoint. Those who did not like it might have either overlooked it or been too keen on special FX, which aren't numerous in this movie. They might also have been turned off by the absence of any strong, leading character, or even the realistic, saddening turn of events.

What I loved in it though was its authenticity. Characters are believable. None is a hero, they are ""everyday-people"" that, in different times, you would not have met. They get to group for better protection. Most of the time, they are ill-fitted, disorganized, poorly trained, overwhelmed and emotionally shattered by what's happening around them. The movie's overall objective seems to be a simple description of an end-of-the-world event seen through the eyes of ordinary people. Some of them die stupidly of benign causes, some are reckless, some are selfish, some care for others. Also noteworthy is that there is no stereotype whatsoever on the zombies: they are neither bad nor good, they are just a nuisance that must be disposed of.

Without question, slow, shuffling zombies are terrifying. However, this premise only works in two scenarios: if there's a horde of them or if they are able to take you by surprise. This movie doesn't feature any of this. A disjointed effort with with terrible dialogue, anyone who claims this is the most realistic zombie movie ever made is either easily swayed by anything British or comparing its content to normal, real-life home movies which are, for the most part, dull, poorly shot, and full of people making complete idiots out of themselves.

Where is the realism in: stopping to film a zombie eating your female companions guts after a car crash; a quick cut to a close up of a zombie being shot in the head; keeping the camera rolling at night in the woods while running from multiple ghouls; and a man with a camcorder being shot while sprinting away from zombies?

The acting is terrible, stiff and unnatural, although to an American audience the awkwardness may be confused for a normal British accent.

An approach that focuses more on the human aspect in a zombie film is perfectly acceptable if it is achieved. The problem here lies with the fact that while there are multiple character, not a single one inspires any empathy or even sympathy. The mockumentary premise works for the first thirty minutes or so, and then fails horribly. Despite some claims, there is no social commentary; nothing on the level of any of Romero's films, merely the same trite ""man is the real monster"" motif featured in many other productions.

For all the reviewers hailing this film on the strength of its sound: it's impossible to see anything a lot of the time, so sound means little out of context. In addition, having a score that creeps in at only very particular moments (and a score almost directly ripped from Romero) becomes distracting. I don't see how adding the buzzing of flies to indicate a zombie's presence qualifies as a ""brilliant use of sound"" as it spoils many potential scares.

I'm all for low-budget, indy horror. I have plenty of it in my collection. But apart from making me feel a little at home with all the accents (I am a UK native) this film has almost nothing to offer. There are no new, original, or creative concepts here. To grossly misrepresent a movie like this does real damage to independent horror and it should not considered a measure of success.

Unless you like wasting time in an unenjoyable fashion, don't listen to the positive reviews. They are desperately trying to turn this film into some kind of cult classic.

For the rest of you, here it is.

The Zombie Diaries is an independent British film from 2006 written, directed, and produced by Michael Bartlett and Kevin Gates. The entire film is shot with a hand-held DV and is done in a documentary style, broken down into three chapters, The Outbreak, The Scavengers, and The Survivors. On the surface, the story unfolds when an unknown virus begins to spread; starting rurally, then eventually making its way through the major cities of Britain. In each chapter the protagonists managed to have a video camera for one reason or another and were able to capture the events.

Looking further you see that each chapter illustrates contrasting behaviors ranging from denial and apathy in The Outbreak, to a mix of confusion and determination in the chapter The Scavengers, followed by an escalation of paranoia in The Survivors.

All of this seemingly corresponds to the coping mechanisms one might encounter in a situation where an apocalyptic virus is off-ing people then re-animating their corpses in order to further spread the disease. There is a slight twist at the end that I think further illustrates a darker, primitive side of humanity and ties into the apathy we see early on in the chapter The Outbreak.

Overall the story that each chapter tells was good and as a whole the plot was refreshingly cerebral for a zombie flick. The subtlety throughout the film was notable as this was not an attempt at making a zombie action film. The Zombie Diaries seems to align more with books like Walking Dead and Max Brooks's Zombie survival guide. The grainy imagery of the DV proliferates the depressed apocalyptic mood and actually enhances the make-up effects.

The creature effects where really a highlight in this film for me; working with, what I am sure, was a shoestring budget, the effects where comparable to Fulci's zombies back in the day. An added bonus was the use of the DV giving the decomposed corpses that extra realism. The zombie's behavior was interesting; I never thought I would live to see zombies slower than Romero's. Their slow lumbering added a psychological layer, a persistence that really added to the futility of the situation. Especially in the last chapter where the survivors would go out and try to exterminate the undead only to find a whole new group of zombies were back the very next day with that slow lumbering, practically just standing there.

The acting wasn't great but it wasn't terrible either again it really just added to the realism. I don't think the point of the film was to allow the audience to identify with each individual protagonist but to merely offer a glimpse into a chaotic situation that had happened once upon a time and if anything allows us to reflect on our humanity in a larger scope.

Towards the end there is a small twist that I think was intended to work in a binary fashion with the plot, meaning, sort of driving home this commentary on humanity in a fatalistic way. I think people are going to get or not and I don't think it's intended to be this big M. Night Shyamalan shocker.

To sum it up, people should give this movie a chance especially if you're a fan of zombie things. Given a bigger budget and some time Michael Bartlett and Kevin Gates are going to rock.",1236729600,3,4401,4.622279129321383

For a majority of those 80 minutes, not much happens sadly however.  The acting ranges from good to ungodly bad, and the dialogue doesn't fare much better either.  What The Zombie Diaries does have going for it however is that during the last third of the film, things really pick up for some truly horiffic moments.  Also, there is some great zombie makeup on display as well, but not nearly enough gore moments to satisfy die hard zombie fans.

The digital camera/documentary style of filming is just annoying. You will not understand what is going on because the camera is just shaking. It is also apparent that the producers discovered that instead of fight scenes they can just point the camera at the ground and have a woman scream.

ANYHOW... this movie is more about MAN and how they behave in a Zombie world...or better yet how man's insanity is allowed to go unchecked in a world without law enforcement!!! same yourself some cash and skip this movie... unless you buy it used or you run across it in a bargan bin for under $6.00!!!!",1232668800,3,804,4.33112582781457

Acting isn't horrible but of course isn't the best ever either. As for gore it was ok and actually looked pretty real on most scenes. I'm rating it 3 star just because it wasn't a horrible movie but it was a good one either, If you collect zombie films then this will go good in your collection but its nothing to get excited about either. Zombie Diaries isn't as bad as house of the dead 1 or 2 but its not as good as dawn of the dead either. Personally I think the hunt is still on for the perfect zombie movie...",1232496000,4,652,4.1015625
3531636,5,B001DJ7PU0,"This movie was very well made. I'm convinced that had they had a bigger budget and more resources it probably would have affected the film negatively. The acting was good. The characters were believable. The camera work was excellent. This movie honestly and truly felt like a movie that was shot on camcorders by normal people to document the zombie apocalypse. The plot moved a bit slowly at first but there was enough action to keep things interesting. Everything ended up coming together seamlessly, though.

At first I didn't understand where all of the negative reviews were coming from. Then I started to read them. ""LOLz their waz hardlee iny blud LOLz"", ""I didn't like the ending"" and ""Diary of the Dead was WAY better"" are the biggest arguments against the movie that I see. This movie isn't for gorehounds. You won't find buckets of blood or people being ripped limb from limb by huge hordes of zombies here. It does have it's moments, though. The zombies were very convincing. There are some gory parts but they don't overshadow the film. Some of the images go way past gore and into shocking and horrifying territory. The ending was definitely sick and twisted. It was done in such a way that you could appreciate what the directors were trying to accomplish, though. There's a lesson there. I'm not sure if the people who claimed to have liked Diary of the Dead more than this movie even bothered to watch it. There are a lot of Romero sackriders out there and some people will just automatically deride any movie that's anywhere near as good as one of his. In this case it's MUCH better than Diary of the Dead. DotD was unconvincing. It didn't come close to capturing that ""documentary feel"" like The Zombie Diaries does. It wasn't bad but it wasn't this good, either.

This isn't so much a zombie movie as it is the social commentary that George A. Romero has been trying to pull off since he made the original NotLD. The movie isn't supposed to mindlessly focus on zombie killing. The zombies are just ""the thing that collapsed civilization"". The movie isn't supposed to be about how people deal with the zombies. It's a movie about how normal people have to continue to deal with that ""thing"" (whether it be pandemic, nuclear war, asteroid strike or any other major catastrophe that could potentially wipe out civilization as we know it). When the grocery stores can no longer be stocked you still have to find food. When law and order breaks down then YOU become the law and order and you have to be careful about who you trust. When the government is gone then no one will be there to save you except you. While all of the mindless zombies that will most assuredly be roaming around will be dangerous they'll be easy to avoid as long as there aren't too many of them around. It's the people that know what's going on and who want to survive as badly as you do that you have to worry about the most. This movie captured that feeling perfectly.",1232496000,3,2962,4.597353497164462

I had over a bunch of my friends for Zombie Movie night and 3 out of 6 of us actually fell asleep!  Sorry but it wasn't the beer as I tried to watch it again cold sober and guess what?

After the first 20 minutes I knew the Zombie Diaries was a total disaster and disappointment.  Unfortunately I had to swallow it till the end since I was watching it with some of my best friends who are lovers of Zombie movies.  None of us loved it; in fact all of us agreed that the movie could do much better.  We don't like movies that looks like a documental to make the watcher believe that everything is all real... some movies have been done this way like ""Cloverfield"" (Not bad but not a killer), The Blair Witch Project (it was OK), Diary of the Dead which most people think is the best in this filming style, or at least got us stuck to the screen wanting for more.  Regarding to what the back cover of the DVD states that is far better than ""28 Days Latter"" I will have to remind them that ""28 Days Later"" WON 7 international Awards including  ""Best Horror Film"", ""Best Breakthrough Performance: Naomie Harris"", ""Best British Film"", ""Best Cinematographer: Anthony Dod Mantle"", ""Grand Prize of European Fantasy Film in Silver: Danny Boyle"", ""Best Director: Danny Boyle"", ""Best International Film: Danny Boyle"" and in was nominated in 21 another categories, so we are talking about a HUGE production here, not for the budget that was only 8 million dollars, but for the HIGH QUALITY of the product in the whole and the ENTERTAINING VALUE, whether they like it or not.  Zombie Diaries is a waste of money and time, unless you are a big fan of low quality movies then give it a try.  You'd be like me after watching it.  I need to recognize that some actors did very well to make you believe everything horrible is happening even though nothing is seen; and that's one of the humungous flaws of this movie a lot dialogue but no action is seen, all is in your imagination... they talk about the outbreak but you don't see any of it, they talk about surviving but you don't see the survivors how they did to survive the zombie infestation or anything related to it.. you just see them most of the survivors die in the hands of a mad man, NOT EVEN A ZOMBIE... It is very rare to see a Zombie biting a victim 2 or 3 times at the most and when it happens it occurs so fast that can't actually see anything clear.  In fact most of the zombies that appear they never attack since they are too far from survivors you just see them they are shot down in the head... GO BUY ZOMBIE DIARIES...

3531650,1,B001DJ7PU0,"This movie is without a doubt, possibly the worst movie ever made...period! As zombie movies go, a viewer should be ready for mindless violence as is the norm for this genre of movie. But one would hope that there is some sort of story line. Zombie Diaries has absolutely none. The photography amature, the storyline non-existant and the acting worse yet. This movie is supposedly a video diaries of three groups of folks at various stages of an outbreak of a virus that reanimates the dead. The movie jumps from group to group seeming at random. There is no flow to any of the sequences. What's happening in each of the sequences is pretty much open to your imagination as the direction is so lacking that you don't know who any of the players are, and quite frankly, you really don't care. One minute the road is clear, as the groups make their way through mindless woods, and then as if a shooter game, the zombies are there, right in front of you, maybe four feet away. Not that zombie movies are supposed to be believable, but this movie is nothing if not a video presentation of how not to make a movie, regardless of the genre. Don't waste your time or your money on this movie. It is 81 minutes of your life you basically wasted. It is but a mere want to be of George Romero's Diary of the Dead.

There wasn't really a plot at all all it was was a group of people running through the woods yelling profanities and half the time you couldn't even see what was happening.

low b or c level movie.  Many microbugdet movies are very bad with a
inexperienced crew using hand held cameras.  This isn't very bad it is ok for what it is and that's a c budget flick.  The boxart is very deceiving as it shows what a higher budget movie would feature : zombies on the loose in major cities.  That being said the zombies do look excellent which puts this up into a c level movie.  The movie follows various people who are documenting their attempts to survive a zombie plague.  It all takes place out in the english countryside and small villages and that is ok.  The movie becomes sidetracked with a psycho who kills survivors and that only hurts the procedings.  These type of movies have always been a aquired taste.  Some of them like the ""blair witch project"" carry it off very well.  But most others are claustrophobic afairs that become annoying in that you must rely on the video taper and don't see the wider picture. George Romeros 'diary of the dead"" is a much more accomplished movie and this is a dead on copy of that idea. Which means it's ok at best and can't compare to a regular well made zombie flick with it's filmic values.  It's not the worst zombie flick ever made; it's just a pale imitation of 'diary of the dead' with far less of a budget and experience.  That being said if you like zombie movies you may like this one because it's one of the many average chompers out there.  It is NOT the best zombie movie ever made though (the boxart claims this), this isn't even close to the original ""dawn of the dead"" or even lucio fulcis' ""zombie'  two real classics of zombiefication.",1231027200,2,1708,4.380952380952381

What was written on the box, that is, but with the reviewers saying it was ""The best zombie film ever"", ""The most realistc zombie film ever made"", ""Dark, uncompromising and frighteningly real"" and ""Better than Danny Boyle's 28 Days Later"", I took a chance. It was like checking on that banging noise coming from the tool shed, knowing that a ghoul lies in wait on the other side ready to eat your flesh. Blood soaked mistake. This film is no different, a MISTAKE.
It had no emotion towards any actor, no character development of any kind, and all the pictures of London in ruins on the dvd box weren't even in the movie. It took what felt like an eternity(20 minutes of [...]  boring gibber-jabber) to even make it to the first zombie scene...I kept telling myself, """"okay this is where the film gets good,where it becomes ""The best zombie film ever"""". It NEVER happened. I love zombie films, my fave sub-genre of Horror having seen dozen's on top of dozen's of films involving the walking dead and this ""Zombies Diaries"" rates in the top 10...Of the WORST. I actually rolled over and started to doze off...
  It did have a Night of the Living Dead feel to it, maybe because they ripped off the same eerie sound track, or the way most of the zombies were shown coming out of the woods in hoards, but that's the only comparision I saw. To the ones who said it reminds them of NOTLD, please watch either Romero's NOTLD again or even Tom Savini's remake of NOTLD and see that you're Undead WRONG.
And to the ones that may say they had no budget- I assure you that money has nothing to do with this tripe. I work on no-budget films, ZOMBIE films included, and I blame the writers and Die-rectors for this foul stench of film decay. It seems to me they just wanted to jump on George Romero's bandwagon after ""Diary of the Dead"" and had no interest in the living dead. Replacing the love for brain munchin' with quickly making a film that's hot in the market doesn't work, It's obnoxious and disrepectful to the Undead.

3531655,4,B001DJ7PU0,"First things first, this movie is shot on video. If video bothers you or you hate cinema verite, then skip The Zombie Diaries.

There are two reasons this is done in video, the primary one being that it is cheap and allowed a couple of independent filmmakers to shoot their zombie movie on a low budget. Second, this story is told from the viewpoint of people caught in a horrific situation ( via video diaries ), rather than in third person by the omniscient camera. Neither is a reason to trash the movie, and if it was not done on video it would probably not have been done at all.

That being said, the Zombie Diaries has a good solid plot. The story is composed of four segments which are seemingly unrelated, but are all tied together in the end. The zombies are classic shambling Romero-esque creatures, not Olympic sprinter zombies, which should please the purists out there. The makeup effects are more than adequate, and there are some interestng twists.

Until the Last Light Goes Out: The Making of The Zombie Diaries featurette

All in all The Zombie Diaries is an entertaining little movie. It has more than a little in common with a cheaply shot black and white flick from the sixties made by some Hollywood outsiders who just wanted to make their own movie.",1230681600,2,1382,4.741666666666666

All we need is a camcorder and the ability to run through the dark woods yelling, screaming and shouting, "" for f*&%k sake, for f*&%k sake!!!"" No need for any plot or to even see what's happening half the time.. no script needed. Sounds like a backyard job to me.",1230595200,,305,4.186440677966102
3531657,4,B001DJ7PU0,"This one is definitely for fans of low budget zombie movies only.  3.5 stars on the low budget b-movie curve, rounded up to 4 because it clearly is an ""homage"" to Romero and his zombie movies.  If you aren't a big fan of the Romero Zombie movies and the ""fake documentary style"" found in Diary of the Dead and Blair Witch Project, definitely skip this movie.

The Plot:  A virus, similar to Avian Flu, spreads from Asia to Western Europe and the U.S.A.  The Government covers-up both the degree of contagiousness and the fact that it causes its victims to rise as zombies.  We follow the adventures (misadventures) of various people who are obsessed with filming the ongoing disaster with a camcorder.  Again, a word of warning, if you aren't a fan of the whole ""fake camcorder/documentary"" thing (a la Cloverleaf, Blair Witch, etc) you will not enjoy this movie.

The film follows the lives of various survivors in the UK.  These range from a group of young people filming a documentary on the ""virus"" before anyone knows that zombies are involved to a group of survivalists holed up at a farm house and dealing with life after ""everything changes.""

The zombies in this movie are lifted straight out of the ""Romero"" films.  They are dumb, they are slow, and they are contagious . . .  Also, right out of the Romero school of social commentary the point is made that the biggest danger we face in a crisis is each other, not the zombies.  (Zombies are hungry and contagious, they aren't evil . . . people are evil.)

If you keep your expectations as low as the budget this film was made on you will be pleasantly surprised by this import.",1230422400,3,1639,4.568493150684931
3531658,4,B001DJ7PU0,"At first, I assumed, this was a ""Diary of the Dead"" knockoff but then found information stating this was actually completed prior to ""DotD."" And, quite unfortunately I might add, I was greatly disapointed by ""DotD,"" so I figured this couldn't be any worse. Quite the contrary actually, I found this flick much more enjoyable than Romero's. I am a huge Romero fan, but his last film was hard to sit through. Bad acting, bad pacing, bad characters, made DotD a 3 star flick at best.
Now Zombie Diaries is not without it's flaws either. The movie is made up of ""documentary style"" videos from three groups of people, a news crew, ""The scavengers"", and ""The survivors."" The acting starts out pretty rough and then gets progressively better as the movie goes on. ""The survivors"" sections are the best acted and most interesting. I also didn't like the quickness that the first group decided that the zombies were zombies (if that makes sense...?).
Zombie Diaries will most likely only be enjoyed by original Romero fans (i.e. Night, Dawn, Day). The zombies in this flick are slow-moving (Not Snyder's Runners) and basically follow all of Romero's ""Zombie Laws."" The atmosphere is very carefully crafted and quite tense and much of the music in the movie was from Night of the Living Dead (even an original preview for NotLD is featured on the dvd). The story is a bit like 28 Days Later (takes place in Britain and also focuses on the degredation of individuals) mixed in with Night of the Living Dead (Romero's shamblers and a wide mix of char. types) with a touch of Blair Witch camera style (I hated Blair Witch, but this movie somehow works.)
Zombie Diaries will either be a hit or miss with viewers (If your a fan of the Romero classics you should enjoy it). I notice this flick got a lot of negative reviews but I found it very entertaining. The film quality isn't bad at all (while it is documentary style, the film quality is decent), so-so acting that gets better as the movie goes on, enjoyable story, tense atmosphere, decent budget, and a great ending. Overall, in my opinion, a solid 4 star zombie flick and, quite honestly, more enjoyable than ""Diary of the Dead,"" sorry Georgie.",1229472000,2,2188,4.685714285714286

It approaches it from a very real human perspective and that is part of what makes it so freaking scary. How do people deal when they come across a zombie outbreak, how do they cope in a world infested by zombies and how do they react to living in a society where all rules are gone?

Who are they kidding with this movie box, for one? All of their budget must've gone to the cover art & teasers.

NOT REALISTIC, NOR ENTERTAINING. Definitely not pleased and does not even come CLOSE to the 28 Days franchise. ""Documentary"" style should not mean ""be horrible & cheap"".

By the way, the cover art for this DVD has nothing to do with the actual movie. Please see my video for more about this bad movie.",1520294400,,743,7.175824175824176
8293693,2,B001DJ7PU0,"I doesn't totally blow but that shaky cam, you're in the movie, docu-style really sucks!!! I've seen iraq war footage with soldiers being shot at with more camera stability. These guys do the shaky cam crap while talking to one another sitting on a log, Come on! The acting was fine for what it was. I liked the countryside and scenery. The concept was fine, although the story does definitely crosses into the realm of how dumb can you guys be during a Zombie outbreak. I suspect the actors were paid in pizza and beer.",1510358400,,520,4.484210526315789

8293695,4,B001DJ7PU0,"The film was shot in a hand-held documentary style format on DV in the style of blair witch/last broadcast,  with the story split into three separate parts all taking place in a zobie infection outbreak.

Disc wise it's kinda limted on extras but the film turned out to be a good pace and if you sit in dark with popcorn and have sound up you will find your self emersed into the action , kinda like watching a live news story,, not a bad ideal , the sequel is also good and don't forget Diary of the Dead by romero now  :)",1481155200,,523,4.107843137254902

8293697,4,B001DJ7PU0,One of the better British Zombie films! There are two parts to this film and both are good but the first is a great zombie horror film. A definite must see for horror fans.,1438214400,,172,4.088235294117647

 This movie owes much to 28 Days Later and to Cloverfield.  It may not be technically better or artistically better than either of the forerunners, but that is a matter of taste.  It is absolutely more scary and at the end, a lot more horrifying.  I have seen dozens of Zombie movies lately and this is the only one that actually scared me.  Bravo.
 The tail is told of a Zombie pandemic from the viewpoint of various English twenty somethings.  This Zombie outbreak is stimulated by a highly infectious virus, ala 28 Days Later.  The pathogen spreads so quickly that the organized humans are quickly overwhelmed, leaving only tiny groups of survivors.  The story follows several of these groups over a time period that spreads from immediately after the outbreak to a month or so later.  The movie is filmed by the hand held cameras of the survivor groups.  A lot of the action occurs at night where the humans cant see what is happening around them.  It is very scary.
 Kevin Gates and Michael Bartlett wrote, directed and produced this spectacularly well done film.  The cast are real, if little known, actors.  This avoids one of the perennial banes of Zombie movies, crappy acting.  These people act their collective tushies off.  But it is the camera work and the direction that make this one work so well.  The writing is also good, the characters act as we imagine we might act in a similar situation.  There are none of the typical horror film flaws like having people wonder off into the fog all alone while something tries to get them.  This film is hyper realistic.
 This is rated R for gore and a little nudity.  It is pretty short at only 85 minutes.  If the twist at the end doesnt horrify you, maybe you have seen too many Zombie movies.
 Three and a half brains, the highest award ever give a Zombie flick.",1426118400,,1839,4.567484662576687
8293699,1,B001DJ7PU0,The movie case is the best part of the whole thing. I just bought it and it was a total waste of money.  Poor graphics poor acting. Zombies don't look dead. And the movie is very hard to follow. And also a very very poor ending.  Don't buy. It's a waste of ur money and time,1421884800,,274,3.875
