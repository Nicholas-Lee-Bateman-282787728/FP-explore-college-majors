8401400,1,B003O578XK,"One of the most pathetic so-called 3D  I ever purchased; advertised as a 3D is only a CYAN Movie ( even then this type of Anaglyph 3D is awful) ; Tell you what >my own created 3Ds are far better than this movie, considering I only use simple avaiable 3D software  to convert and/or create all my 3D movies; and the story is so weak with hopeless characters.  Even if it was a giveaway I would throw it to your face..  Why would any producer creates this type of movies for the market is beyond me. My rating is just ONE STAR that's only because of the visible colours in that movie. Please don't bother in purchasing this type of 3D movies, just leave it on the shelves.",1407888000,,670,4.2109375
8401401,3,B003O578XK,"...the 3d affects aren't great-are hardly noticeable but depends on a persons ability to see in 3d more than others-proven fact.
the story line is solid, simple & (different enough being about lil' herc.). theres not enough at all of brooke h., just seconds clip of her on stage so silently-too ridiculous. nick & hulk are seen here the most, doing the only full acting in this show. the only thing about this show that hipes up at most is the battle between  good guy hulk & his off stage friend thruout the film and good guy lil herc vs nick h. .the good prevail. i hate giving this 3 stars, should be 2.5 or so. not much more to say comes to mind on this goofy film. gawd.",1303171200,2,675,4.232558139534884
8401402,1,B003O578XK,"This really should be a cute movie. Instead, Hogan way overacts his roll as Hercules father and plays it off The Big Show who also really overacted his roll. Overall, this could have been a cute kids movie but just turned out horrible. Robin Wright is in the movie and plays her part perfectly. Cudos but not the movie to get back into acting with. Bad really bad.

On the other hand. The 3D was great. Whoever the production company was did a wonderful job with the anaglyph. There were a couple scenes I had problems seeing but for the most part the anaglyph was done very well.

 Don't expect this one to come to the new 3d tv's. It isn't woth it. Good anaglyph but horrible movie.",1297382400,,684,4.328125
