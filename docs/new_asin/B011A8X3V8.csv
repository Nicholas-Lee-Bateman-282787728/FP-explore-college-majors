8723986,5,B011A8X3V8,"Spoiler alert: if you don't want to know the details in advance,then all you need to know is that it's quite good!

I bought this DVD to add to my growing collection of Christmas Fireplace DVDs; I'm used to ""The Ambient Collection"" dvds
for their HD quality (some even in 4K), but once in a while, I'm tempted to try something new.

This is actually a DVD combo, though all on one double sided dvd; It's recent (2011)  and repackaged in 2015.

First of all, it's in Widescreen, ideal for our flat TVs, dolby stereo and HD.

The first side : "" Fireplace and Melodies for the Holidays' is the actual Fireplace with Holiday music or simply with the natural sounds of
a crackling fire, 60 minutes each; your choice; it looks nice, sometimes the angle changes from full fireplace to close-up of the flames licking the burning logs; it's done smoothly, so it' not annoying; I like the music, though I wish there could be other instruments like a guitar instead of all piano, but it's still fun to listen to in the background .

The other side, """"The Spirit of Christmas' is very fascinating; the music is much better, varied, a different  scene (about 25 of them) to each song (varied Instrumentals); it's really hard not to stay mesmerized  because the scenery is so beautiful and diverse; you have live snowy exteriors with softly falling snow; many Snowmen, of course, awesome Christmas decorations, candles and even a cute animation; it has it all.

When I take the time to write a review, it's because I really like the DVD (or DVDs in this case, A side and B side).

Knowing what you know now, if you are still interested, you won't regret it; it makes you feel happy and cheerful;
very original visuals and familiar Holiday music.

I highly recommend it!",1480032000,,1755,4.575079872204473
