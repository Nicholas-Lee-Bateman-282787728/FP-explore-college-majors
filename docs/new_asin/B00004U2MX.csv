7923541,1,B00004U2MX,"This video is not worth the price or your time. It is only 40 minutes in length and does not go into enough detail or have enough substance to be of much value. As a previous reviewer commented, ""Uncle Matty"" seems more interested in showing off his skills in berating the owners (""You BAD owner!"") than in providing useful info on how to train/correct the dog. The examples he does give (""Here Spot, Here!"") do not go into enough depth to be of much value. See the 3-set video by ""The Monks of New Skete"" for more in-depth discussion, review, and analysis of how to train and raise your dog. Spend your [money] on something else.",1053648000,,630,4.439655172413793
7923542,1,B00004U2MX,"Usually I am not the sort of person who complains about a poor choice I made. This Video was so bad I feel that I want to suggest to anyone else considering it not to do so. There is almost nothing of any value about raising puppies in this video. Uncle Matty seems more interested in becoming the Car Talk brothers of dogs, than in providing solid information to those of us who are looking for reasonable assistance in bringing a puppy into their lives. We have seen about 4 or five videos or DVDs on puppies and the best was an older Video entitled ""Good Puppy"" by Jeanne Carlson, available on this site",1032307200,7,606,4.324561403508772
7923543,5,B00004U2MX,"If you want to see Uncle Matty in action, check him out on PBS.  Then, if you want to get your dog to do pretty much anything, follow Uncle Matty's advice in this video.  Patience and practice with this tape will give you the dog you've always wanted.",984182400,3,251,4.208333333333333
