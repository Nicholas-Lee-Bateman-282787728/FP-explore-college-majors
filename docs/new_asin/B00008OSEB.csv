7986041,1,B00008OSEB,The date of this movie says 1996 but from the soundtrack and visual effects it felt more like 1986 Bad acting in what could have been a pretty good movie I figured out who the killer was within the firs 5 minutes and so will you If you're looking for a relaxing bedtime type movie this is it,1442016000,,291,4.0344827586206895
7986042,2,B00008OSEB,"Horrible acting and production to the point where this film has you wondering if this is a spoof of a real movie.  Like a train wreck, what your watching is terrible, but some how you just can't quite turn away!",1440979200,,211,4.275
7986043,5,B00008OSEB,Good movie.  Keeps you spellbound until the end.  Good acting also.  I recommend this DVD after watching it.  Buy it.,1365638400,,117,4.7
