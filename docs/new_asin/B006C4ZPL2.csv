I thought ECW Guilty As Charged 2001 was the last ECW show only to find out they had 2 more house shows before the company closed and this DVD has those two events via fancam. If you're not familiar with fancam DVDs there's no commentary it's basically just like being there live right up by the ring.

The first show was about an hour and a half, the matches were short but the show didn't freel short or lose any of it's charm. Everything from tag team action, falls count anywhere matches, crusierweight action, and a hardcore main event. Awesome show. The second shoe was 2 hours and just like the first event plenty of great matches and some weapons galore that you'd expect from ECW. It certainly didn't feel like a ""final"" show, furthering how shocking it was when they closed. Both events had lots of action, some comedy, and great crowds. Very happy with this historic DVD.",1425340800,,893,4.546583850931677

If you are a fan of the original ECW, i recommend getting this cause these are the very last 2 ECW shows before it went into bankruptcy. There is no commentary on these dvds, i wish there was but its still a good dvd",1350777600,3,263,4.176470588235294
