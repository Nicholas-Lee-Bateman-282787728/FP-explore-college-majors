8124073,2,B000FKP1UY,"This is a ""Biography"" of the Astor Family.  But to try and put that much history into less than an hours show is very difficult.

Please I did notice some errors in the presentation.

I am afraid I would not recommend this purchase, as much as I would like to.",1270771200,,260,4.16
