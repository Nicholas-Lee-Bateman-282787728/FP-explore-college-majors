2534173,4,B000EU1OPQ,"Suitable for beginners to intermediate level. It covers Martillo basics and variation/improvisations (2), Guiro 6/8, Songo, Funk, Calypso, Reggae, Samba & Motown.
The pattern is shown in tiempo, than at 80 beats per minute (for approx.  2 mins) and play along in tiempo (for approx. 2 mins.)  Professional, clear and precise with adequate time to get good practice in . Excellent.
It also covers warm-up exercises,  tuning, care and maintenance.
Bongo Tuning (A-La/G-Sol or F-Fa) with an octave difference Macho to Hembra (lower).

Tip:
Kalani, also provides good advice on putting vaseline on the tightening lugs and rim edges where the skin is stretched over. Also if dry/new put skin loating cream on new skins.

Word of advice if your set is new and of real skin, soak them first and then tighten, else you might get a split/tear developing along fault lines.
Why not 5* ? - it is not multi-regional, has no dots//notes (but does have it own notation on the bottom of the screen), it does  provide a legend/index to Kalani's notation (hidden in the intro section) but does not have repeat loops to the various patterns.

I would also recommend for intro, 'The Bongo Book' by T. Salloum [Mel Bay] ISBN:0786620714  and 'Beyond the Basics' by T. Salloum [Mel Bay] ISBN:0786643846.

8114246,5,B000EU1OPQ,"This guy's pretty cool in his delivery, and doesn't feed you a lot of useless information.  Lot's of stuff here and if you can master it well...awesome.  Since I play this on a computer I can slow him WAY down and see what he's doing when he is playing very fast (which is different from what he does when he plays slow) and is helping immensely with my technique.  Also, having the stereo tracks separate for bongo and band is a nice touch, and the mp3 files included also nice.  Lotta good material here and enough complexity to give yourself plenty of entertainment.  I bought the Bongo Grooves for Beginners first, and went through that before the Bongo Jam and the two instructors play with VERY different technique; youtube has shown even more dramatic differences in technique",1447632000,2,783,4.686131386861314

8114252,5,B000EU1OPQ,"For the price it's the best you can get. What makes this one the best is that he goes through the instruction slowly, 88BPM, then you have 2 minutes to practice with music. Another great point about this DVD is that it has a section for everything, from tuning, mounting a new head, etc. Be advised, it doesn't come in a plastic case, but how needs one. Before you think of buying some other one, try this one first; you won't need another DVD instructional material for awhile.",1401753600,7,478,4.443181818181818
8114253,5,B000EU1OPQ,Kalani  is good at showing and explaining techniques on the bongos. I have purchased other videos by him and he lives up to my expectation on this dvd in being thorough with the topic.,1396137600,,184,4.411764705882353
8114254,5,B000EU1OPQ,"OK, this one is exceptional. I should be at Betty Ford Clinic for Amazon addiction, and order loads of stuff; merchandise, books, products, movies, etc. and, of course, instructional DVDs of all kinds. Kalani's, both on clarity and thoroughness is a stand-out. It is really great, from  the history of to opening the shipping package with your new bongos, to describing hardware and set up, in depth description of how to hold comfortably and warm up to an extensive offering of rhythms for all sort of music including notation and over the shoulder views as they are being played, both slowly and up to tempo. There are several good bongo DVDs out, and this one is definitely near or at the top of the list-very happy!",1389916800,6,719,4.7063492063492065
8114255,5,B000EU1OPQ,"Most of the bongo instructional videos I've seen are ridiculously limited.  You'd think that the only pattern for this instrument is basic Martillo. Kalani instead offers several variations on the Martillo and a wealth of other patterns to practice and use in a variety of grooves.  The maintenance and head replacement sections were a welcome surprise as I broke a head the day this video arrived!

I can read music but the notation used on the DVD is as easy as it gets for anyone who can't, and is actually better suited to playing hand drums.  This is the video I was looking for.
Ok, gotta go jam!",1279843200,27,602,4.546296296296297
