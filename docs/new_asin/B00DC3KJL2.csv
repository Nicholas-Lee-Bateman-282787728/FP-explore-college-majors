8591567,5,B00DC3KJL2,This is the most effective 30 minute DVD workout(more than kettlebell/crossfit/mma) you can have while learning the most effective fighting system ever! Great as a core part of your overall training.,1403654400,,199,5.451612903225806
8591568,3,B00DC3KJL2,I took some Krav Maga classes but my new area doens't offer any. So I purchased this thinking it would be more instructinal on Krav Maga. I only gave it 3 stars for that reason. It's a great cardio workout as I was winded and sweating. I'm still using it to workout on the days I don't make it to the gym.,1393545600,2,305,3.935483870967742
8591569,4,B00DC3KJL2,"This is just what it says it is, it is a workout.  It will make you stronger and help with your cardio needs.  It is not designed to be a Krav Maga Self Defense instruction course.  If that is what you are looking for don't buy this.  If you want to feel better after working out and do movements used in Krav Maga and have better balance and coordination, buy this video.  If you want to learn how to defend yourself there are several defense instruction videos available.  This video is a exercise workout, it is fun.",1391472000,,519,4.298969072164948
8591570,1,B00DC3KJL2,This DVD look like it was made and recorded at home. Starting from the box and ending what is inside DVD. This is not DVD to learn Krav Maga. It is DVD with aerobic and it is not a good one. For $27 I can buy two good aerobic DVDs . Would not buy it again!!!,1385596800,,258,3.625
