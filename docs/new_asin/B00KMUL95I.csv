6434281,3,B00KMUL95I,"Steve Dallas (Owen Wilson) is a shallow weather man for an Annapolis, Md. station. He is the best friend of Ben Baker (Zach Galifianakis) a scruffy bipolar paranoid pot smoker, i.e. Zach Galifianakis type cast. He is also a ""yellow belt"" and is writing a book in a spiral notebook. When Ben's father passes away, Steve returns with him to Lancaster, Pa. where we meet Ben's unlikeable sister Terri (Amy Poehler), and his young ""back to nature"" step-mom Angela (Laura Ramsey).

The story goes off in different directions. There is a sibling estate fight. We have shallow Steve falling for the step-mom who sees through him. Then there is Ben's mental health and desire to create a utopian society starting with his farm.

The film had some good scenes as one might expect in a Zach Galifianakis film. Owen Wilson, or at least his character put a dampener on the whole film whose theme was...friendship? The ending really didn't tie things together and Steve was such a plastic character, you never wish for any success for him.

Okay as a Red Box rental- Magnolia film substitute.

6434283,1,B00KMUL95I,"Having never seen a single moment of Mad Men I can't truly speak to the quality of that show except through the superlatives others have placed on it. Lapping up all of that praise has been the show's 9-time Emmy-winning creator, Matthew Weiner, who has always managed to create something special on the small screen. And that's what makes his feature film debut with the middling and muddled buddy comedy Are You Here, which only a few months ago was titled You Are Here. Not that anybody will care because they'll be too busy wondering where the laughs are to notice.

Weiner has gathered a cast built for comedy but there's a breakdown suffered somewhere along the way. Owen Wilson plays pot smokin', womanizing weatherman Steve Dallas, the stereotypical big fish in a small pond. He thinks he's the king of the little Annapolis, MD news station he struts around at, sleeping with one of the co-anchors and driving his boss crazy. He's incapable of connection on any emotional level with everyone, except for his old pal Ben Baker, played by Zach Galifianakis with the same childish idiocy he brings to every character since The Hangover. Bipolar and claiming to be some kind of ""green"" enthusiast, Ben has nothing except his friendship with Steve, who he looks up to for unknown reasons.

Drifting along lazily for far too long, the plot kicks into gear when Ben learns that his rich father has passed away up in Pennsylvania. Well, it ""kicks into gear"" in the sense that something actually happens and it's the last time anything of worth does. Ben learns that he's basically inherited everything, with his eternally-negative sister Terri (Amy Poehler) gaining little and the man's sexy young wife Angela (Laura Ramsey) getting absolutely nothing. While Angela is shocked at first she learns to deal with it, but Terri sees Ben's psychological issues as a means of getting the money for herself. Basically she's a terrible person but at least she's transparently horrible. The other characters, who we are supposed to like, don't have any qualities worth rooting for.

Surely the characters on Mad Men aren't as one-note as these otherwise a petition should be started to have Weiner's Emmys forcibly removed. He seems convinced Wilson's meager charms can make the self-involved Steve likeable, as one of the key arcs involves his growing feelings for Angela. It culminates in a terribly unfunny scene where Steve is asked to capture a chicken for dinner, and he does, chopping its head off and watching it run around decapitated. Yeah, that's hilarious. There's a meandering shapelessness to Are You Here that is trying from the outset and punishing in the long run. Weiner doesn't seem to have any idea what the film is supposed to be about, and he clearly wants it to be about something. Ben, who is magnanimous as often as he's depressed, is suddenly cured in such a knee-jerk fashion it's like Weiner was worried he'd have to cut for a commercial break. But the worst treatment is reserved for Poehler and Ramsey who are given few opportunities to flesh out forgettable female roles.

Sometimes working in the world of serialized television can be detrimental to a movie career. There's a different rhythm and structure to directing features and Weiner may just need more time to adjust. He can always bounce back if somebody's willing to give him another shot, but Are You Here is such a disaster a second chance could be hard to find.",1408752000,2,3446,4.8654173764906306
6434304,1,B00KMUL95I,"Poor quality DVD. Halfway through the movie the screen went black, fast forward a little bit and it started playing.

I'm thinking an inheritance probably goes a long way to straighten things out if you've just been drifting along for awhile.
Good humor. No constant vulgar jokes through the whole movie and really if there were any, I couldn't remember because the humor is of the mild variety.
Probably the biggest reason to see this movie, other than it just being a good over-looked movie, is you get to see that guy without a beard.",1473811200,,612,4.473214285714286

6434315,3,B00KMUL95I,"Poehler.  Wilson.  And the other guy.  I am hesitant to critique this film, because I do have a mixed opinion about it.  My choice for a rainy day was this, because Wilson always delivers on his charming, self-absorbed smoothness, which I have found, often taints the film's pattern.
Unless I miss my guess, in this quiet little sleeper,  has Wilson lost his comedic touch, or did he just sign on for the paycheck?  Life is serious enough, when I want to be reminded of the state our world is in, with so much pollution, drastic weather consequences, poverty, disease.....well, all I have to do is pick up a paper or watch the news....all there, destruction, wrapped up in some stupid laugh fest with Wilson.  It didn't happen.  In this poor film choice, humor was so vague, so much a non-presence for these actors, all of them comedians of a sort....this film left me thinking and wondering why I didn't just turn it off after 20 minutes? I kept watching, thinking any time now, Wilson will deliver his real lines....the laughs will start....this will be funny....uh, nope.
Not even a whisper of humor.  Snide and snarky, (Poehler); panic-driven and co-dependent (Zack G), bland and pretty much milked dry, (Wilson), there just wasn't much to it. I am only giving 3 stars, because they tried, but really, it seemed as though everyone was phoning in their lines, rather than developing the story.
The writing is all over the place. The satire is weak and not well played. What's left, the scenery? OK, that was nice.
I have never been let down by a film with Wilson, even if he takes a second line role. But in this loser film?  I think he should have passed this one by.",1453334400,,1671,4.614864864864865

6434319,2,B00KMUL95I,"With a cast like this, they should label the movie as 'not a comedy'. I probably honestly only made it half way through before I stopped watching, which is unusual for me. What's sad is, with those actors, they could have made a great flick.. I was really hoping for more. I do not understand why actors choose roles in films that do not fit their skills. All 3 of the main characters are comedians. I wanted to laugh, and instead I ended up in an irritated mood. Oh well, Live and learn. Zach is one of my favorite comedians and I hope in the future he doesn't choose every role that comes along. He's much better than that, as well as the others.",1449792000,,648,4.233870967741935

6434328,2,B00KMUL95I,"I wanted to love this movie because of the all star cast, but it just wasn't funny. It is difficult to make Amy Poehler unlikable and this movie managed to do it.

I tried watching this twice. The first time I fell asleep, and the second time I stared with confusion - everything was just too far beyond far-fetched and was depressing. The characters lacked charisma, and the chemistry was strongly lacking. Character development was weak and if there was some hidden message, I wasn't getting it. The title, ""are you here"", seems to be more like a question to the audience, as I feel like you're likely to tune out or turn this off before getting through it. ""Are you here? Did you turn this off yet?"" That's what I'm feeling.

6434333,1,B00KMUL95I,"This is not a comedy.  There is nothing funny in this movie and there is nothing fun about this movie.  Not a single character has an ounce of charisma.  All are very immature.  If at any point a character in the movie had died  nobody would say: ""Aww.. I really liked that person.""  Every character is flawed and broken.  When they stop taking recreational drugs then their lives [in this movie] become worse.
  The plot: A pot head's father dies.  He goes to dad's funeral with friend.  [both smoke dope all of the time] Family faces obstacles created from greed and jealousy.  Compounded by the will.  Many insipid emotional feelings come out due to misunderstandings and personal insecurities. [Partially due to stopping pot cold turkey and licentious behaviors]  Maybe everyone will live happily ever after.
  It comes down to a really bad script can't be saved by a director and actors.  The other parts: filming, camera work, lights, sound, back grounds, were all very good.  I'm not sure about the music because it was so innocuous that I didn't even notice it.

Luke Wilson, Hangover Guy, and Amy Poehler (would have preferred to see more of her (in spite of her be-atch) character are all awesome actors and funny. Hangover guy manages to show a different part of his personality other than nuts. The hippie dippie gal in the movie, who's name I'm not motivated to look up as I wasn't a fan, was obviously a good actor as I think in real life she may be a decent person but, her character was annoying and the part of movie involving her was weird. Didn't like the part of the story involving her. Movies are movies but, her involvement with various characters what over the top bizarro. Nevertheless, I liked it.",1429747200,,713,4.450381679389313

6434348,4,B00KMUL95I,"The movie has f-bombs and nudity.  Owen Wilson's character is a moral screw-up, numbing himself to life with abundant pot-smoking.  His moral saving grace is the loyalty he shows in dealing with his childhood friend.  Amy Poeler is the sister who stayed in town and watched her father spend his last years happily distracted by a hippie-chick singing the praises of back-to-farm life.

This movie was good. I liked it and found myself thinking of it the next day.  I liked the contrast of Amy Poehler's character saying she wanted to tear down that ""crappy old house"" and develop the farmland.  Her brother, Zach, refuses and she marches home to her McMansion which sits in a treeless landscape of other McMansions.  The next scene is at the farmhouse set beautifully in the pastoral landscape of Amish country.  This is the ""crappy old house.""

Throughout the movie we see a contrast between real and the modern markers of ""success.""  Everyone seems hungry for more.  SomeOwen, Zack and the new widowhunger for something ""real.""  Amy's character is still on the path gobbling-up ""success"" to fill her hunger.

I like the use of the farmhouse as the a place that is fufills the hearts desire for home and the use of the newly widowed hippie-chick as representative of a desire that somebody that loves us be waiting for us at home.

Can it be that in a world of kleenex homes and lives (useful to an end) that is hard to give a damn aboutcookie-cutter condos and fakey-fakey careersthat mental illness is a normal reaction to an abnormally, flat-feeling world.

Steve (Wilson) and Ben (Galifianakis) have been best friends since they were kids. Ben is his own person and has a hard time fitting into the world. Steve is a weather man who spends his time drinking and getting high. When Ben's father dies the two head back to their hometown for the funeral and when the will is read the bulk of the estate goes to Ben. His sister isn't happy about it but Steve sees a reward coming. Going in to this I was expecting a comedy. The preview makes it seem that way but even if you haven't seen the preview the cast would suggest it. I did like this movie and I think it's worth watching but this is not a typical comedy. There are some funny parts in this but for the most part it is a little depressing. Galifianakis is a perfect choice for this and the role really fits him. On the other hand Owen Wilson plays the same guy he usually does and that kind of detracts from the movie a little. This is a movie I would say is worth seeing though but do not expect a full on comedy. Overall, a movie that is good and worth seeing but not really all that funny.

6434445,3,B00KMUL95I,"I have the impression that the question title of this movie is in response to the ""Be Here Now"" slogan from the sixties/hippy days.  The advice to be here now is offered because if one is not present to themselves and others in the here and now, they run the risk of sleepwalking through life, to be nowhere (no-w/here).  The journey to be here now seems to be universal and at the same time unique for each person. In this film, an attractive young woman helps three lost men along their way.

Owen Wilson's character, Paul, plays a charming narcissistic playboy who finally gives up his ways when the attractive woman makes an attempt to see behind his facade.  Her efforts to see who he really might be sparks him to finally have some feelings for others as shown by his regret over having had an ancient tree chopped down for one of his earlier whims.

Zach Galifianakis' character, Ben, takes on more complicated journey.  As a child his mother was emotionally unavailable while his father harshly criticized him.  To cope with what he had gone through, he numbs out and withdraws.  When he learns that he has inherited 2.5 million dollars worth of property and assets, he decides that it's time to activate himself.  But as James Masterson says in his book, The Search For the Real Self, one needs to be cautious during this time because when one self activates themselves  (ie: does something in line with their real self), all sorts of old unprocessed/unmetabolized memories and feelings may be triggered and brought up to the surface.  Without awareness and support during this time, a person might turn to some form of defensive acting out in order to somehow deal with those feelings.

Ben identifies a genuine interest of his, to use some of his inherited land to create an organic farm and a training centre for sustainable living.  His initiative brings up his father's voice in his head which is so intense that Ben hallucinates his father's harsh words being spoken to him by an innocent person standing next to him.  Ben loses it and pushes the stranger.  His acting out results with him ending up on meds.  A sad ending for Ben.

The lesson seems to be to acknowledge the importance of attachment theory.  Ben first needs to find a ""secure base"" from which he can explore his interests.  Like a child exploring his environment, the child returns to his mother for soothing or ""refueling"" as needed.  No one in Ben's memories, or in real time, had his back.

Ben's father had the happiest years of his life when he married the attractive woman now involved in Ben and Paul's lives.

In reply to the question ""Are the boomers now more present (ie: aware of being aware, body and mind more united, calmer but not number, feel that the purpose of a relationship is the relationship, etc) than they were in the 60s,"" it's up to each viewer to decide for themselves but I wonder if the final scene with the two horses perhaps offers one opinion about this.",1410652800,5,2968,4.634799235181644

6434453,2,B00KMUL95I,"I was in the mood for something different and watched the previews and thought ""this is it!"" It was a little bit different, but not in a good way.

I feel like this could have been great, there was just too much in it, and oddly enough, I didn't feel like it had enough depth. It felt like they were trying to do and say too much at once, and if they would've followed through with one solid thought, it would've been much better.

So Owen Wilson plays Steve Dallas, a weatherman who's main concern is doing whatever it takes to not be sober, and getting laid. This is one of the characters that I felt like they could've spent more time on. To me, that was his character in a nutshell. He didn't have much of a back story and there was no indication as to why he was living his life the way that he was.

Now Zach Galifianakis played Ben Baker, Steve's best friend, who is bipolar and also spends most of his time getting high/drinking. His character had the needed back story, you could easily connect with him and care about what was going to happen to him. I think that they did a decent job showing the breakdowns that he had and explaining why he reacted the way he did to certain events.

'Amy Poehler played Ben's sister and was another character that I felt could've had more depth, although she did at least have a storyline that you could follow and gave her character something more rounded than Owen's character.

It was like they struggled between 'Hey, this is the seriousness of someone who is bipolar' and 'Hey! We should make a stoner comedy!"" but they were not able to mesh the two ideas together cohesively. And the end legitimately felt like they said ""Oh! We're out of time! The end!"" and that was that.
The idea was good, the cast was good but overall, sadly I would not recommend the movie.",1409961600,4,1814,4.355029585798817

6434468,3,B00KMUL95I,"I watched this movie because it was recommended to me, with the statement that I would probably ""identify with a character played by Zach Galifianakis."" In the film, Zach plays a man who suffers from bipolar disorder with schizoid tendencies, coming to grips with his illness and trying to re-integrate himself into society. I think the moment that hit me the hardest was when Zach was prescribed mood stabilizer medication for the first time and it really hit him that, man, I'm going to be on this stuff for the rest of my life. I could totally relate to the crushing feeling that gives a person.

So anyway, Zach plays the aforementioned bipolar and Owen WIlson stars as his best friend, a weatherman for the local news. They are both heavy pot smokers and the movie features loving scenes of them hanging out and smoking it together. Anyway, Zach feels disconnected from society and Owen is struggling with his own problems relating to women and settling down into a committed relationship, not to mention having a hard time keeping a handle on his money. They're both flunkie losers, basically.

Suddenly Zach breaks the news that his Dad has died, and he and Owen attend the funeral and the reading of the will, whereupon Zach is bequeathed a lot of money, a country store, and 100 acres of farmland by his old man. His sister (played by Amy Poehler) is outraged at this, considering him incompetent, and desperately wanting to take control of the property and manage it as she sees best. So, she tries to declare him unfit in court, which goes awry, and Zach takes control of the properties. He promptly goes haywire and tries to create an ""Omega Society"" to teach people to ""live in harmony with the land"" and ""get rid of all the bull#@^!."" All this is cut short, however, when he attacks a man in a bar, imagining him to lob harsh insults in his direction about his competence.

In the mean-time, Owen is starting to develop a thing for Zach's dad's widow, a young girl he obviously married for her sexual characteristics, and who spares no insult directed toward Owen for his drunken, pot-smoking lifestyle. At one point Owen offers to ""get her on the next flight,"" and waves a bong at her, to which she responds ""No thanks, I try to avoid things that keep me from feeling."" Ba-zing! They continue to hit it off however, and there's a lot of sexual tension in the air.

However, Zach gets really upset one night and bemoans his very existence, and his dad's widow feels a connection with him and they sleep together. This does wonders for Zach and starts getting him thinking about how he needs to ""get his s*** together,"" so he shaves his beard (the first time I've seen Zach without one), regularly takes his medication, and bequeaths the country store to his sister for her to do with as she sees fit. She promptly turns it into a SuperStore called ""Amish Farms."" Zach bequeaths the farmland to Owen, who quickly finds out about Zach and the widow sleeping together, and threatens to kick them off the land. But, things are soon resolved in a heartwarming conclusion.

Overall the movie is very uneven and hit-or-miss, with a lack of focus or narrative drive, as it kind of meanders from plot point to plot point. In addition, the emphasis on mental illness lacks a lot of the direct ""oomph"" of something like say, SIlver Linings Playbook, perhaps because it deals less genuinely with the subject. However, because of my empathy with Zach's character, I overall enjoyed the film, and must give it three out of five stars.",1409702400,3,3534,4.657051282051282

This movie gathers depth as it goes.  It starts with two seemingly shallow people (Owen & Zach) living essentially empty lives.  But just as the characters have to face sorting their lives out, the movie starts to focus on some very real questions.  I do not think you walk away totally feeling like you know what the movie is about, or even what the characters are about. There is the sense of a lot more drama and tension to come.  Even though there is a conclusion to this particular episode of the characters' lives, there is no ending and certainly no ""happy"" ending.  Which makes the movie more authentic I think.  There is a thread of sadness running through the movie which I think is part of the theme of inauthenticity.  That sad, the movie is not sad or depressing, it is very entertaining -- but complex.
