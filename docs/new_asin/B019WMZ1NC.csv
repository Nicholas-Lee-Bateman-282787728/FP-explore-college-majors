7584279,5,B019WMZ1NC,"So far I have only completed Cardio 1, as I am getting over a cold, but I wanted to take the time to share some thoughts. With just a 20 minute cardio workout and minimal equipment, I found myself sore the next day. I found that Cardio 1 was much more lower body intensive than I had realized! The tempo was also quite fast, sometimes almost too fast for me, but I think I will adjust. Also, Cathe's warm up and cool down felt entirely adequate, which is not always true of some of my other favorite trainers.

The most impressive thing about this DVD, though, is the quality and production value bringing all of the content together. Not only is there TONS of content, but it is all laid out in detailed menus for your perusal. Plus everything just looks and feels professional, including the background trainers.

It's taken me a year to finally pull the trigger on buying a Cathe DVD and I'm glad I did. Sure, her DVDs are a few dollars more expensive than the more mainstream competitors, but I've found that it's worth it. I'll report back when I can speak on the rest of the content.",1475625600,11,1089,4.3861386138613865

7584281,5,B019WMZ1NC,"Great workout, as usual, for Kathy.  I will say it's not as hardcore, but that's the intent behind the ICE series.  You can amp it up yourself though, which makes this a nice one for days when you don't feel like going full-speed-ahead.",1458691200,7,236,4.465116279069767
7584282,5,B019WMZ1NC,"Workout time: 46:13 minutes
Equipment: 3, 5, 12, & 20 lb. dumbbells, step, mat stretch band
Muscle Meltdown: Back
Outfits: Bright yellow tops and black or blue bottoms

This DVD has two cardio workouts on it. Cardio 1 uses a mat and dumbbells, while Cardio 2 uses a step with 2 risers on each side.

Cardio 1:

Some fun, new exercises include:
Discus throw with 3 lb. dumbbell
Forward leaning lunge with 3 lb. dumbbell

Even though this was low impact, my heart was pumping!

Cardio 2:

I had to go down in weights for the back muscle meltdown, especially for the pullovers.

The 10 minute Blizzard Blast used a step with 2 risers.  Cathe threw in some old favorites like jump kick and salute squats.",1452988800,8,700,4.5

8746132,5,B019WMZ1NC,"This is my new favorite work out DVD.  It has so many different options and I find it challenging but not to the point of I need to take breaks and can't walk the next day.  It is perfect for someone that is fit, wants to stay fit but can't do a lot of the jumping anymore.",1500336000,,273,3.7719298245614037

8746134,4,B019WMZ1NC,"Whoa!!!  I've been doing Cathe's workouts for 20 years so I am no stranger to intense workouts.  Don't be mislead by the words"" low"" or ""intermediate"".  This one had my heart  pumping after 5 minutes and did not let up.  Add the core workout to it and you've got yourself a solid hour of huffing and puffing.  The only complaint I have about this workout (and the series) is the music.  Not at all impressive or helpful to my goal of a fun workout and a few times she goes offbeat but that's on purpose.  All in all, a thorough, effective workout that will stay in my rotation for good.",1491696000,,586,4.263636363636364
