8643133,5,B00IKQH284,"Montalbano is magical, the scenery, the intricate stories, the rough, windy Sicilian beauty with its Baroque architecture. One can feel the smells of the simple daily very good food Salvo Montalbano treats himself to. No wonder the series has sparked interest from fans form Belgium, the UK, Germany, Switzerland to do the Montalbano trail, visit the locations, the restaurants, stroll along those magnificent vistas and experience the history. Author Andrea Camilleri is a great writer who plunges the reader and, in this case the viewer, into the Sicilian ethos, pathos and logos. Very few writers convey these elements of the Sicilian mind so well, for unlike Mario Puzo, Andrea Camilleri conveys, elements beyond the criminal mind, showing the intimate feelings, the frame of mind, the wit and hypocrisy, self-derision and sarcasm of the Sicilians. It is so good that through Montalbano, Italians have learnt to better understand the mind of the Sicilians. With Montalbano Camilleri deserves a Nobel for literature.",1438387200,,1019,5.375
