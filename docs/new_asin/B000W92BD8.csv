8738573,5,B000W92BD8,"I like viewing older B and Ws. I also like the ""corny"" scripts. No deep drama like most of today's overrated movies. Actors/Actresses played their roles w/o profanity but with open imagination.",1485129600,,193,5.0625

8738575,1,B000W92BD8,"The only thing good about this movie is the title and the fact that it's a Roy Rogers movie.  The Son's of the Pioneer's are always great as well.  I love old movies, but try as I might, I just couldn't make it to the end.  I would rather watch ""Rio Bravo.""  But that's just me.",1392940800,,278,3.9107142857142856
8738576,5,B000W92BD8,"Roy Rogers and Dale Evans are impossibly young in this 1944 flick...I'd forgotten what a sensational voice he had. Even Gabby Hayes is a young middle age and still singing with the Sons of the Pioneers. It's no wonder I love Mexican trios music...it sounds just like the songs in this movie.  Fun, nostalgic piece.",1370390400,,314,4.709090909090909
