This two disc dvd is well made, explanations are clear, instructor is very, very knowledegable and will provide the instruction needed to capture and understand Cha Chui Quan.  I have used several dvd from this organization MartialSkill.com, and I most say that I always go back to see what new product they have released.  Again, it is the responsibility of the practictioner to practice and put in the time and if you do using this dvd, you will learn a very intense and fasinating form within Praying Mantis.  If you are a new commer to Kung Fu or the Praying Mantis form, this is the way to start.  This is my 6th dvd from these individual and I also use their techniques to teach my classes and my students love it.  I recommend this to all practitioners of Kung Fu, especially those of us who have dedicated ourselves to the Praying Mantis Style.",1515715200,,951,4.5321637426900585
