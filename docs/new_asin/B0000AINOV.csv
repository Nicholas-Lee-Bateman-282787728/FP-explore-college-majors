7997286,3,B0000AINOV,"No Escape, No Return is a fairly unique entry into the subgenre of police-themed action-thrillers, and it is worth checking out despite my average rating. This well-written adventure is engaged in a fight with producers trying to shoehorn it into the form of a throwaway adrenaline piece. Concessions appear to have been made that result in some sloppily-presented scenes and heavy-handed drama, but you're still looking at an interesting and engaging alternative to the usual PM cop fare.

The story: Three police officers  played by Dustin Nguyen (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/21-Jump-Street/dp/B003K2G0TA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">21 Jump Street</a>), Denise Loveday (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Phantasmagoria-A-Puzzle-of-Flesh/dp/B00069EVOG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Phantasmagoria: A Puzzle of Flesh</a>), and Maxwell Caulfield (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Colbys/dp/B00T73AVIC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Colbys</a>)  are targeted for internal sabotage after interfering in the plans of a drug baron (Kevin Benton,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/White-Men-Can-t-Jump/dp/B0000AC8LH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">White Men Can't Jump</a>).

The movies strengths begin with its three leads, who do collectively well with their roles. The film gives Maxwell Caulfield top billing, but this is in fact one of the few times wherein all three of a movies leads play equally prominent characters. Too much of their background and motivations are revealed via exposition and the strongest of their dramatic scenes are mucked about with attention-pleading editing, but the performers seem to genuinely feel their roles and have a natural chemistry that make their relationships believable. Additionally, the extended storyline is equal to these characters for its unconventionality. The plot against the characters begins as an assassination attempt but morphs into a cerebral attack, leading to the stars making some genuinely surprising decisions throughout the film.

The action is a solid mix of shooting, fighting, and explosions. Its not the best stuff ever, but a little more of it would have bolstered my rating. Some of the gunfights are nice, and the PM studio lives up to its reputation by including a couple of cool car crashes, but the clear star of the action scene is Dustin Nguyen. Nguyen is choosy when it comes to his action roles, supposedly having turned down films for years to avoid being typecast as a karate man, and a feature like this makes you value the parts wherein he does demonstrate his aptitude for the martial arts. He leads four of the five fights, and while I would have given a lot to see him take on some credible opponents, its a thrill to see him cut loose, particularly in the three-on-one brawl.

Problems with the jumpy pacing occasionally give the feature an oddly experimental vibe, and its passive justification of police brutality rings particularly foul nowadays. Nevertheless, for all its faults, the movie is entertaining in more than a mindless way. It would be great if writer-director Charles Kanganis screenplay had instead been filmed by someone like Dwight Little, but even in its current state, I recommend this one for viewing by action fans.",1440720000,,3372,6.10337552742616
7997287,1,B0000AINOV,"For this uninvolving action piece, the director's eye is more upon pyrotechnic effects and stunt work rather than narrative flow, and following upon its violent opening minutes, the work simply skids into predictability, a viewer being able to foretell even the details of dialogue.  The setting is Los Angeles, where this movie is filmed, its plot relating of three members of the Los Angeles Police Department, assigned to an undercover narcotics detail, during which deadly complications occur, as a DEA operative and two uniformed officers are killed, this while a very large amount of drug sale money disappears, about which none involved appears to have any knowledge.  The three surviving undercover officers are subsequently under suspicion, leading to a Department personnel investigation that alleges they are secreting the missing cash, whereupon the trio become fugitives as they attempt to discover who is answerable for the aborted operation.  The police official heading the investigation, Captain Mitchell (John Saxon), and a sergeant working under him, Dante, played by Michael Nouri, are aware that the longer the renegades are on the lam, the more serious their situation will become, yet the officers remain in hiding, although each alienates the others during the course of their search for the elusive drug dealer.  Any possible inner aspects of the officers (Maxwell Caulfield, Dustin Nguyen, Denise Loveday) are neglected while they behave as rampaging steamrollers while seeking the narcotics kingpin.  An additional matter of significance appears from within the Department, as a possibility exists that a police official is linked with the Forces of Evil.  Despite the generally reliable cast members, a flabbily constructed script and weak direction impede their best efforts, with a surfeit of the storyline's emphasis being upon cartoonish violence and frequently occurring explosions to please devotees of that sort of activity.  A hackneyed screenplay simply does not provide enough contributing sidelights to keep plot emphasis away from clich&eacute;d episodes of violence, and the actors merely go along with the work's prevailing mediocrity.  Nouri, as a conflicted Dante, is able to liberate himself from his limitative lines often enough to handily gain acting honours here. Essentially a thick ear production that favours loud noises and lead characters yelling at each other, the movie is at the typically low level plumbed by PM Entertainment Group, a company that specialised in cinematic slag.  The DVD release of the work comes from Madacy, an outfit with a spotty reputation for quality.  However, in this instance, both its visual and sound grades are excellent.  The only bonus feature is an imposing 50 minutes of strident trailers from PM for films which a viewer of sensibility might not sit through by choice.",1242864000,,2860,5.418918918918919
