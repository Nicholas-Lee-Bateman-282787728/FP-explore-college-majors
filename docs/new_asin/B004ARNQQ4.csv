8599468,1,B004ARNQQ4,"I bought this disc from Amazon France. I live in the UK (the same Blueray region as France), but the disc will not play on my multi-region Oppo blue ray player. Instead I get an on-screen instruction that the disc is not compatible with the region of my player (in French, of course). So, wait for the US version to come out: buying this French-sourced disc will probably be pointless - and expensive.",1305417600,8,401,4.506849315068493
