1785324,3,B00006LPGC,A nicely paced sexual romp/farce. Could have done with a bit more edge but if you are looking for hardcore this is not the place.  70's genre softcore with nice looking actresses and interesing storyline.,1124150400,12,204,4.828571428571428
1785325,5,B00006LPGC,"I simply can't begin to describe this film. It delivers everything a red-blooded human male could possibly want: It's porn, but not porn; It's hard-softcore. Chock full o' nudity and rather explicit sex for a non-porn film, it is not meant to be watched with an analytical eye. Of course there's a paper-thin plot. DUH! The turn-on here is that these aren't technically porn actors in some serious hot and heavy activity. For those of you who got started watching tripe like Basic Instinct or Wild Orchid, THIS is what you are really looking for. American actresses won't dare get this nasty.",1050883200,69,592,4.813725490196078

7971688,3,B00006LPGC,"Appears to be a VHS transfer to DVD.  Fuzzy when watched on a computer.  If it is remastered, it was a poor job.",1367539200,,112,3.8260869565217392
7971689,4,B00006LPGC,"The main character in this film, named Valerie, house-sits for her absentee cousin. She's lonely, and scared to be in the empty house by herself. So one night, she immediately summons her pal Sophie to come over, and keep her company. The two women drink vodka, and indulge in piping-hot lesbian sex together.

Valerie and Sophie have a great time with each other, until Sophie is kidnapped by a strange cult of sex-fiends. The plot then revolves around Valerie trying to find Sophie, and rescue Sophie from her captors. But not before Valerie has had a chance to enjoy prolonged, decadent sexual trysts with various strangers, that she happens to become acquainted with.

Marie-France Morel as Sophie, is the only cast member who stands-out. Marie was a good choice, to play the sensuous, yet vulnerable-looking Sophie. Pale and diminutive, Sophie seems like a waif who needs to be looked after. It's easy to see why she was the one who was snatched away in the night, by the kidnappers.

Like many French films, the pace of this film was excruciatingly slow. The story-line is nearly impossible to follow. And illicit sex between the characters, seems to be the centerpiece of this movie, to the detriment of actual character and plot development. The main reason to see this film, is the sizzling, hot-to-trot
performance, of Marie-France Morel as Sophie.",1257292800,2,1358,4.947368421052632

7971691,2,B00006LPGC,"If you into this kind of film, and can fast forward, great.  Otherwise, don't waste your time.  The story is weak, the acting weak, and the sex forgetable.

The credits are ok.  So it wasn't a total waste.  But masked charters tip-toeing thru a room like some animated cartoon..  Call the acting police.",1224201600,,303,4.622641509433962
7971692,1,B00006LPGC,"The idea behind this movie is simple: get together the ugliest men and women ever assembled and force one beautiful woman to simulate sex with each of them.  The lead actress does manage (with effort) to keep a straight face while getting intimate with these gargoyles, but she doesn't manage to show any chemistry.  Who could?

If you want an erotic movie with lots of nudity, see Young Lady Chatterley, or Sexual Chemistry, or Animal Attraction, or The Ultimate Attraction.

If you're looking for a horror movie with lots of ugly people nude, you've found it.",1146787200,24,561,4.8125
7971693,2,B00006LPGC,"First, If you can find this film to rent, do so before buying. It is listed as a French sex farce. It is more French and farce but yes there is simulated sex as well. It is a shallow film without much substance. It was only an okay film, and in retrospect not worth buying. It probably will not remain in my

collection. There are much better ""sex farces"" such as the Italian films starring Laura Antonelli. It is worth a look I guess, if you can rent it.  Charlie Spivey",1138665600,16,471,4.164835164835165
7971694,2,B00006LPGC,"Ok! So it had a Swiss cheese plot. That's not so unusual for a soft core move is it? I've seen my share of soft porn movies and usually, not always but usually, what was lacking in a storyline was  made up by the fact, that numerous gorgeous gals were romping around in the altogether, doing stimulating things to make you forget, there was even supposed to be a plot.

Yes, Bacchanalles had a lot of nudity and a lot of make believe sex but except for the star, Joelle Coeur, who was genuinely a looker, most of the rest, looked like the girls, that get better looking at closing time. I know everybody can't always be fussy about the women they make love to, but certainly, they can be fussy about the ones they watch women make love. Right?

So what do we have? We have a plot, which, believe it of not, could have been the inspiration for ""Eyes Wide Shut"". Oops! I've already said too much! Bacchanalles Sexuelles, meaning `sexual festival`, features a generally unattractive cast of amateurish, stiff (not that way) actors and actresses, performing mostly sans clothing, in a fairly low budget, thirty year old erotic, French movie, with subtitles, where you sometimes have to choose between reading the subtitles, or watching the action. Still interested? Read on.

Valerie, the one bright spot in the movie, played by Joelle Coeur, who along with her friend Sophia, (Brigette De Borghese) is apartment sitting for her cousin, when Sophia, unbeknownst to Valerie is kidnapped by a sex cult. Valerie is awakened in the morning by Fred, whom Sophia apparently invited over without Valerie's knowledge. Fred forces Valerie to have sex, which she ultimately enjoys.

In the meantime The culprits realize they have kidnapped the wrong girl, for they really needed Valerie and not Sophia for their evil purposes, so the head seductress, (my expression) sends one of the cultists, pretending to be a maid, back to the apartment to garner information on Valerie, where she promptly ends up in a bathtub with Valerie and Fred before taking their ma`nage a trois to the small (double) bed in the bedroom, where the action continues for what seems like hours.

Eventually the real maid shows up and Fred and Valerie, the super sleuths (that`s sleuths as in detectives, not sluts as in ....) that they are, start to unravel the mystery of Sophia. But not until we have a half dozen more sex scenes including the grand finale, an orgy of cultists. WOW!

Conclusion

I suppose this movie in a sense was an orgy. An excess of mediocrity. It also had a sense of absurdity. This may have been purposeful, which, it was would somewhat mitigate against the amateurish feeling of the film, However, that said, for all it`s weaknesses, it wasn't that bad. Like I said the story was full of holes and except for two ladies, the femmes were closer to homely than attractive, or they were hard and used looking. That said, their bodies were decent and the were enough (probably a dozen) sex scenes, that I wouldn't stop anyone from watching this bomb.

Another point should make is that being filmed over thirty years ago and in Europe, the girls were unshaved, including in some cases, under the arms. Also the color quality was a little flat.",1129939200,52,3226,4.725978647686833
7971695,1,B00006LPGC,"Jean Rollin is a name instantly recognizable to hardcore horror fans, yet meaningless to nearly everyone else. This ignorance is quite unfortunate because the French director concocted some of the sleaziest, most unusual films ever made during the 1970s and 1980s, films usually imbued with a disturbing mix of hypereroticism and bloody violence. I have often tossed Rollin's name around in impolite company with seeming aplomb even though I had never seen even one of the man's films. You read enough plot synopses about someone and you start to feel as though you know every intimate detail about their work. What I did hear from others about this director oftentimes did not bode well. He is apparently well versed in schlock filmmaking, which in and of itself is not a problem with me, a true lover of bad cinema, but several of his films continue to draw raves from a selected minority of genre fans. Well, I finally sat down with a Jean Rollin film, his 1979 effort ""Fascination,"" and was pleasantly surprised with the results. Then I followed up with ""Living Dead Girl"" and was even more impressed. Then came ""Lips of Blood,"" ""The Demoniacs,"" and ""The Sidewalks of Bangkok."" No wonder most people think Rollin is a hack.

Prime proof of hackery is Rollin's 1974 Eurosex romp ""Bacchanales Sexuelles,"" sometimes referred to as ""Fly Me The French Way."" I call it ""BORING."" Oh lordy does this film reek! There is a plot, if you can believe it, but it's so laughable I can barely bring myself to describe it for you. Valerie (Joelle Coeur) takes it upon herself to apartment sit for her journalist brother, who is ostensibly in the States somewhere researching a story. Val gets a little bored, however, and promptly invites her lascivious pal Sophie (Marie-France Morel) over for a bit of conversation. The two quickly begin drinking and...well, let's just say they prove their friendship in no uncertain terms. Welcome to the first of many scenes involving birthday suited Eurobabes that seem to run on, and run on, and run on again for what feels like an eternity. After Sophie and Valerie acquaint themselves, they turn in for the evening. In the middle of the night a couple of intruders waltz into the apartment and end up abducting the hapless Sophie. Why? They meant to nab Valerie because her brother's investigations into a sex cult threatens some very powerful people, and they hope to exert a bit of pressure by whisking Val away to the countryside. Ooops.

Valerie teams up with one of Sophie's boy toys to crack the case. After interminable scenes involving Val and this guy ""acquainting"" themselves, they finally get around to taking action. In the meantime, poor old Sophie runs head on into the leader of the cult, Malvina (Brigitte De Borghese), and her sordid minions. A rather lame punishment involving a few lashes with a whip follows, as do more scenes where lumpy French men and sleek Eurobabes ""acquaint"" themselves. Malvina, decked out in some kooky looking bead clothing, takes her frustrations out by target shooting a bunch of mannequins in the courtyard and screaming at her underlings. There's a bunch of bunk about a cache of film negatives back at the journalist's apartment, and a bunch more bunk back as Valerie and her new beau receive a visit from a maid named Jenny (Jenny Trochu) that involves--you guessed it--striking up an ""acquaintance."" I think that's enough description to prove the utter mindlessness of Rollin's film. Plot exists only to provide an excuse for matching up women with women and men with women. At least the movie gives us maid wrestling.

The most notable thing I can say about ""Bacchanales Sexuelles"" is that it's the first Rollin film I've seen that doesn't look like a Rollin film. If you've spent any amount of time watching this director's films, you know what I mean. The high atmosphere and deliberate camerawork that mark his horror films is absent here. Instead, Rollin slaps together a typical soft-core sex film of the sort churned out by the hundreds in Europe during this period. The dialogue is dumb, the acting negligible, and the clothing is scarce. The second thing I can say about ""Bacchanales Sexuelles"" is that it's BORING! Watching this film from start to finish requires a herculean effort. I felt like turning the DVD player off at least once every five minutes. In this day and age the sorts of activities we see in the movie just don't create a stir. If you really want to watch this sort of thing, just go the whole nine yards and pick up an adult video. While a thirteen year old boy might find this stuff exciting, worldlier adults (meaning anyone who has moved past the stage of holding hands with a pretty girl) will find it lacking in the extreme. Ugh, I can't believe I spent an hour and a half watching this pap!

The only extras on the disc are two trailers for the films ""Castle of Blood"" and ""Grapes of Death,"" two movies that are ""Citizen Kane"" compared to this lumbering monstrosity. I apologize to Joelle Coeur, Brigitte De Borghese, Marie-France Morel, Jenny Trochu, and the rest of the lovely gals who appeared in ""Bacchanales Sexuelles."" You're all attractive women in that inimitable Eurobabe way, but even loveliness couldn't suppress the immense boredom I felt while slogging through this tripe. I'm sticking to Rollin's horror films in the future. At least with those movies we usually get an interesting plot AND lovely ladies. Au revoir, ""Bacchanales Sexuelles."" May I never have the misfortune to stumble over you again!",1128643200,11,5532,4.8446088794926006
