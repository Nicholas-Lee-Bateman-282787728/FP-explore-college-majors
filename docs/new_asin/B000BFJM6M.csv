2415740,5,B000BFJM6M,This movie was a strange movie. It had good music by Quincy Jones. One of the main reasons I got this film is I am a long time fan of Julie Newmar best known for playing Catwoman on the 60s tv show. She's still a raving beauty at 80. Victor Buono is in this and he also is known best for being King Tut on the 60s Batman show. Buono was a great actor and criminally underrated. He left his mark in the great iconic movie Whatever Happened To Baby Jane earning a Best Supporting Oscar Nomination. Finally the lead actor is Wally Cox. Newmar plays the owner of a toy company who wants to recruit a toy maker in Cox to join her company. Cox is a strange fellow he likes to follow pretty women all day long and when he sees Newmar she instantly reminds him of his mother. Cox has a mother complex or some problem there. He doesn't want to work for Newmar and Buono who works for Newmar is sent to recruit him by any means necessary including providing him with female company. It's a real bizarre movie and in the end you make ask yourself how it got made. I found it entertaining and it's not the best movie but it's fun. Nice for Julie Newmar fans too. So I would say give it a shot you may just like it! Cheers!,1391731200,7,1210,4.088235294117647
2415741,1,B000BFJM6M,"There are actually worse films on the market than this, but not by much. However, the fact that I can't say it's the bottom of the heap says something. Years ago a review for ""Beach Party"" stated: ""You have to have the intelligence of a moron to sit through it."" I'd put The Seduction of a Nerd a notch above ""Beach Party"" and the Beach Party sequels, but just a notch, primarily because I think it shows at least some originality. The sexual emphasis is all in good humor, not too heavy, and that places the movie in a more average category. But all in all, I'd rather watch films like The Postman, Dragonfly, and Eight Below than waste my time on this kind of shallow silliness.",1252972800,4,680,4.362204724409449
2415742,3,B000BFJM6M,"Sometimes camp is a little too aware of being camp, and this might be the case with this odd 1972 film.  Wally Cox is way over the top as a little man who likes to follow pretty girls around the streets and who really just wants a mother figure to push him around.  Victor Buono steals the show as the slobbering fool who is trying to lure Cox into working for his boss, a radiant and all-too-sexy Julie Newmar.  This is great camp fun and Newmar is in her prime.  I would have liked it a little more if it had been slightly less aware of its own oddness.",1217203200,5,555,4.064220183486238
8086129,2,B000BFJM6M,Any budget funds for this movie was spent on Julie Newmar and to pay some attractive ladies to take off their clothes.  The rest was junk.,1503878400,,138,4.3076923076923075

8086136,3,B000BFJM6M,"There was a certain style of film that could only have sprung from the 1960s. While this film is dated 1970, it is firmly rooted in the surrealist comedy of 60s films like Phillip Kaufman's ""Fearless Frank"". Since this is currently free to screen on Amazon Prime, it may be worth checking out, since it is otherwise indescribable. This movie (AKA "" up your teddy bear"") is SUCH a product of its time. ...but that's not necessarily a bad thing.",1474416000,,443,4.55
