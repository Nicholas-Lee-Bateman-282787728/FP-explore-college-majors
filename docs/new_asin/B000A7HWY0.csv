8167230,5,B000A7HWY0,"In the 1960s, American audiences were treated to a large influx of European-made movies.  The results were culturally broadening alternatives to the somewhat boxier films being produced domestically at the time.  The elegantly macabre ""Terror in the Crypt"" is one of the best of the lot.

Cult favorite Christopher Lee has a fine role in a cool but vaguely sympathetic role as a mysterious Count whose even more mysterious daughter appears to be the reincarnation of a witch killed by his ancestors. A handsome young historian arrives to work at the family castle just as dead bodies begin piling up and the Count's daughter becomes a little too close to her best friend.

Like so many Euro-horror productions of the period, this one was filmed in an actual, medeval castle and boasts fine actors, period costumes and manners. The mood is dark and the music gorgeous, making this a perfect bet for late night viewing.

This DVD was of excellent quality and very reasonably priced. I have no regrets and you'll probably have none as well.  Turn the lights down low and enjoy!",1352851200,,1074,4.841530054644808
