385250,5,6301966236,"I first saw the original(Head Over Heels) on cable in 1981. I loved the original ending when Charles returns from the park and finds Laura in the kitchen making the famous dessert. He was amazed that she kept the house key. ""You kept the key"", he repeated while she tried to excuse herself for being there. He wanted so much for her to want him while he nearly went insane waiting for her to come back to him. Yeah, I can sympathize with Charles; been there done that. But the original ending gave us romantics some hope. When my ""Laura"" closed the door, I never looked back and I never saw her again [that was 19 yrs ago]. When I saw the re-release in 1982 I was a bit disappointed in the ending. If I remembered correctly, the ending in the book was similar to the original cut. Why did they change it? According to a review in the NY Times, Ann Beattie requested the change. Why? Who knows.
I searched the web for the video with the original ending and found a copy that listed listed ""Woman in Park"" as one of the characters. The scene in the park was cut so I thought I had found it. When I opened the video at home I found it was the re-released version. I continued my quest and emailed MGM/UA and several other places without response. By chance I tried a newsgroup. I got a reply from someone who said the re-released ending is the only version available on video because the original was made before videos were existed. So, unless someone at the studio picked up the 16mm film from the editing room floor we will never see the better ending.",984787200,,1552,4.318493150684931
385251,5,6301966236,"I fell in love with this film in it's original form as ""Chilly Scenes of Winter.""  I admit the new truncated version is more ""realistic"" in an worldly sort of way, but the original ending offered a redemtion in keeping with the fantasy.  This is one of the few times I prefer the fantaz ending.
If I'd a wanted an affair with a real ending I would'a had one.  If I wanted a brilliant and satisfying escapist dream I'd see ""Chilly Scenes of Winter.""
Maybe with DVD will have a chance to see it both ways.",976060800,,503,4.21875
385252,5,6301966236,"""What do you have?"" asks the blind man. ""I don't have Laura!"" answers the young executive.
These are the first lines of the film ""Chilly Scenes of Winter"" and a line which had me saying  things to myself like 'Good beginning' and thinking if the guy was  depressed or just being sarcastic.
""C'mon, what do you have?""  booms the blind man. ""Baby Ruth,"" answers the young executive.  ""That's 50 cents,"" he answers as the executive walks off.
I  know ""Chilly Scenes of Winter"" and its lines/dialogue like the  back of my hand. The  one-liners might be even superior to a Woody Allen  movie (they at least tie each other). I, myself, am very interested in  seeing the original ""Head Over Heels' like many of the critcs below  me. I'm with you, everyone and I love ""Chilly Scenes..."" just as  much as you. If some MGM big-shot ever reads my review (which is  slim-to-none) please take my advice- there are many people out there  wanting to see the original cut of Joan Micklin Silver's masterpiece  ""Chilly Scenes of Winter"" (apparently entitled ""Head Over  Heels""),so if you can pull some strings for us, please release it on  video. It at least deserves a place in MGM/UA's Home Video collection of  ""Contemporary Classics"". This is one of my personal favorite  movies and I've seen plenty. John Heard and Mary Beth Hurts' performances  are magnificent and the characters really are colorful enough to the extent  that they come alive. For anybody who hasn't seen it, purchase it on Ebay  used or get it new on Amazon. Either way you have to see it. It's a real  treat!",936662400,,1566,4.65934065934066
385253,5,6301966236,"For those reviewers wishing to find the original ""Head Over Heels"": don't bother! The final five minutes of ""Chilly Scenes"" separate it from your average happy ending romantic comedies.  I was stunned by the rejection, running, and fadeout ending. This is a big  part of what made this film memorable.",927417600,,301,5.0
385254,5,6301966236,"John Heard and Peter Reigert give such effortless performances - the one-liners are great.  It's just a great movie for anyone who's ever ""been there"".  I saw the original (with the different ending),  Head Over Heels, about five years ago on television, but cannot track it  down anywhere.  Anyone have a copy out there?",918172800,,321,4.87037037037037
385255,5,6301966236,"This is one of my favorite movies of all time.  That's because all of us can clearly relate to being obsessed with a member of the opposite sex, and this movie's tremendous humor and well-developed characters keeps what  could be a depressing subject watchable. A group of friends and I have seen  it at least a dozen times and are fond of quoting the movie's best  one-liners to each other .. i.e. ""very sharp, Betty!"" and  ""I've got an unemployed jacket salesman living in my spare  room!"". We do wish we could see the original version, just because  none of us have, and I haven't been able to find it on video.",914457600,,614,4.428571428571429
385256,5,6301966236,"The characters in this movie were so fantastically developed ... John Heard's, Laura's, the mother's, the unemployed jacket saleman, the candy salesman, the boss  ... the cat and dog killer ... Mrs Delillo ... LOL this  was just a delight.
This movie really nails an obsessive love gone  sour.  This movie is a must for anyone who ever went head over heels over  someone, only to have the realtionship go south.
I saw this movie many  years ago as ""Head Over Heels"" and would love a copy of the  original, also.
Anyone out there have a copy?",911433600,,541,4.515463917525773

7817784,1,6301966236,"I love this movie. I bought it for myself as a stocking stuffer. When it came in the mail, I realized it was VHS format. Yes, at every step of the process, VHS was prominently displayed and I did not notice it.  I didn't notice it because it never occurred to me that you could still buy any movie on VHS. There should be a banner on such sales in bold caption stating -  CAUTION. THIS MOVIE IS IN VHS FORMAT.",1390089600,,409,4.037037037037037

7817786,4,6301966236,"I first saw this movie last night, it was fascinating. Young John Heard was handsome and it was fun to recognise Peter Riegart (crazy hair) Griffin Dunne, and the always great Gloria Graham. It was hard, however, to fathom what Heard saw in his Laura, altho maybe that was the point. She herself thinks he's idealising her way out of proportion and it's driving her mad. In today's world it's funny, instead of a romantic, John would be consider a creepy stalker. He made me want to scream, ""get over it and get on with your life!""...I would love a dvd of this, hope they do release it, especially with a commentary. It was never boring.",1318291200,,637,4.5
7817787,5,6301966236,"This is a great movie, one of my all-time favorites. It's as packed with great scenes as, say, Annie Hall. So where the hell is the DVD (or, dare I say, the blu-ray?) I've been waiting for this one for YEARS.",1291075200,,208,4.097560975609756

7817789,5,6301966236,"This film needs to legally released on dvd NOW because it is an original, extremely well-written portrait of a man in love, and the forever underrated John Heard gives the best performance I have ever seen in a romantic film. John Heard is so sharp and funny; it is a delight to watch him in every frame of this. I watched this back to back with Cutter's Way (and Cat People the night before), and this man deserved to be a big big star rather than waddling around in tv shows and second rate movies I've glanced at over the years. He is really one of our finest actors. Mary Beth Hurt is also quite good as the object of his obsession.  Look for Peter Riegert (and his hair - whoa!) and a young Griffin Dunne who also co-produced this when he was only in his twenties. I bought an old used VHS of this and the picture is worn and wobbly; I know new releases are always top priority, but more of these 70s and 80s small movies need some attention, too. Many people are begging for the dvd release here, on IMDB, many places, and I want to add my voice - PUT CHILLY SCENES OF WINTER ON DVD NOW, PLEASE!",1255219200,,1101,4.169014084507042
7817790,5,6301966236,"Maybe it's just my age (baby boomer), but this edgy romantic comedy from 1979 has such wit and charm, it has always had a very special place in my heart.  John Heard plays a somewhat lost, slightly wounded romantic, and Mary Beth Hurt is the perfect companion he meets while she's separated from the husband she never should have married.  They are brought to life from Ann Beattie's novel with such commitment, it's a joy.  The secondary characters, every single one, are all such a treat as well.  The late Ken McMillan and Gloria Grahame, Peter Riegert when he was just starting out, they're all wonderful.  Find a copy of this movie and enjoy!",1172880000,,647,4.640350877192983
7817791,5,6301966236,"This is one of my favorite films of all time. The original ending is the only way for the film to end.  There are those of us out there who really do believe in fate and happily ever after.  I am one of them.  If you ever get the chance to see the original, see it! Head Over Heels is what it was called when I saw it on HBO nearly 25 years ago (not the Chilly Scenes of Winter, how did that title come about?), anyway, is a very emotional and intellectual film. A+A+A+A+  Long live the romantics in the world.  Will SOMEONE release this film in it's original version!",1111017600,,568,4.081081081081081
7817792,5,6301966236,"This is one of the best films few people have heard of! I don't know about some people, but I LIKED the new ending of the re-edited version. I mean, happy endings are nice and all that, but sometimes things just don't wrap up neatly and I thought this ending really fit the film as a whole. Although I would be interested in seeing Silver's original cut. You know, MGM could prepare a special DVD containing Ms. Silver's original cut on Side 1 and the re-edit on Side 2. But it will never happen. And it's a shame. It would be the perfect candidate for MGM's ""Contemporary Classics"" series.
John Heard, where are you? You seemed to disappear from film. Such a good, understated performance deserved Oscar recognition. But of course, unless the pic is a hit, you don't get nominations. How else to account for this year's lackluster selection?",985219200,,842,4.62
