This horror flick will produce some gruesome and horrifying scenes that will make you want to watch it over & over again.  The acting is classic & will make you want more!

Written By Michael Gingold,  Directed by Mark Atkins.

Starring Derek Osedach, Rebekah Kochan and Scot Nery.

So,There are tributes to Psycho,Halloween and Friday the 13th...The Badguy very much resembles JASON as original boyish self from the lake. I really liked this film from theasylum,It has a look and flavor that will make rentals happen. The make-up is good and use of blades more than guns look fresher. Derek Osedach(see interview) does a different acting style,That we wonder if rest could keep up with. Rebekah Kochan reminded me of REGINA CARROL (Al Adamson's wife who co-starred in most of his films),That Scream Queen who is too well liked to get killed. Scot Nery does a wonderful job as monster,Was hoping it was Eric Spudic inside,Size was right. Erica Roby STEALS the film as The Strong Lesbian,She did a great fight scene with Scot Nery and Saved wardrobe, So Much money .The downside would be all the red herring points and cops that didn't ring true, in character. So,What have we learned ...This is a Theasylum flick of a different color,Based On David Michael Latt memories.",1161216000,9,1129,5.016042780748663

So lets talk about HALLOWEEN NIGHT...if you like horror B movies...well then HALLOWEEN NIGHT is definitely for you. (lol) It's got total cheese blood and guts...not so good acting - - It's just an over the top horror flick. Even though it's from 2006 - I felt I was watching a 1980's flick. (lol) The over the top killings were cool and the girl on girl action was nice. (lol) I just didn't dig the killer. If you watch it - let me know your thoughts. (lol)

2664949,3,B000J10F6O,"I had heard about The Asylum before and knew that mockbusters was what they were all about. Halloween Night was my first movie to watch from The Asylum and I'm not exactly sure how I feel about the film. The movie is a rip-off of the Halloween Franchise and is about a guy named Chris Vale who witnesses the rape and murder of his mother on Halloween night in 1982. During the murdering, Chris's face is horribly disfigured after a bullet goes through a water pipe and burns his face. After the murder, his father commits suicide and Chris is sent away to an insane asylum after he was supposedly framed for the murders. 10 years later on Halloween night, 1992, he escaped the asylum by killing 2 facility workers and heads back to his home to look for vengeance and answers as to why his mom was killed.

It's discovered that a group of teens are having a Halloween party at Chris Vale's house and he'll murder every last one that stands in his way of finding out why his mom was killed. Right off the bat I want you to know that this movie does get pretty gory at times and a few of the kill scenes are done in pretty gruesome ways. There's blood, cursing, I think nudity, a lesbian scene (one of the lesbians is pretty attractive and at one point kicks the killers ass for a little while before being killed off), and of course, plenty of stupid teens doing plenty of stupid things. The acting and graphics in this movie are somewhat subpar but is somehow a good bad horror movie---at least in my opinion anyway.  I only recommend buying this movie if you're just looking for a horror movie to add to your movie collection for the Halloween season",1381363200,,1650,4.388888888888889
2664950,1,B000J10F6O,"Halloween Night (Mark Atkins, 2006)

I've seen a number of the ""mockbusters"" put out by The Asylum over the years, and they've all been crap. And then there is Halloween Night, which may have been the first of the mockbusters, after they decided that actually putting out good, original films wasn't getting them anywhere (they were responsible for King of the Ants, Stuart Gordon's best movie since the mid-eighties, before they went down this path, for example). It is certainly, of those I have seen, the least obvious a copy of the movie it apes. It is also the most watchable of the mockbusters I have seen; I do not believe these two things are unrelated.

Plot: David (Snakes on a Train's Derek Osedach in one of his last screen appearances before he headed behind the camera to become a full-time producer) is a guy who has been putting on haunted houses for Halloween every year, but really wants to amp things up, so he hatches a plan with his old college roommate Darryl (Bikini Spring Break's Jared Cohn) and friend Todd (YouCube's Nicholas Daly Clark) to spring on his guests. Meanwhile, however, crazed and horribly disfigured serial killer Chris Vale (You Don't Mess with the Zohan's Scot Nery) has broken out of the mental hospital where he's been held for the past ten years and is headed home... which happens to be the house where David is planning his hijinks. Put a serial killer together with a bunch of drunk kids and what do you get?

...pretty much every slasher film made in the past thirty years, really. The Asylum, screenwriter Michael Gingold (Leeches!), and director Mark Atkins (Sand Sharks) weren't going for originality here, but they were at least keeping the Halloween references to a few in-jokes (Todd, stopped at a roadblock, mentions to the officer that he's coming from Russellville, for example) rather than copying the movie as close to frame-for-frame as they could get away with, like they normally do.

I should rush to add that when I say Halloween Night is a better, more watchable movie than A Hunting in Salem or Transmorphers or Death Racers or... that I don't mean to imply that this is a good movie in any way. It's about as awful as one would expect from the Asylum's stable. But it's not the worst movie I saw this week, so that's something. *",1367107200,3,2298,4.694789081885856
2664951,4,B000J10F6O,"If you haven't figured it out by the title, this is an Asylum mockbuster of the movie ""Halloween"". It is based on a true story, i.e. there was once a successful movie by the title of ""Halloween"". It seems they even borrowed the sound track. As a child Chris Vale (Scot Nery) witnessed the rape and murder of his mother (Jan Anderson). He becomes badly disfigured and enters a mental institution where he escapes and returns to his old neighborhood...and I think you know the rest. The opening scene after credits starts to introduce the young adults and future victims. The scene hits on the classic Asylum trifecta of Bad acting, Bad writing, and Bad directing. The beginning includes the token horror film lesbian scene, although not nearly as good as the one in ""Wrong Turn 4"". Thank you Amanda and Alicia for allowing those wonderful close-ups that omitted your face.

I enjoyed the old time looking Gilmore gas pumps. Our killer is both psychotic and capable of reasonable thought as he goes to a Halloween party where he meets a bunch of nice party people and guys in Michael Myers' masks. The movie becomes a typical 80's style Roger Corman slasher with plenty of blood, gore, twists, and young topless girls. If your a Corman style fan, check it out.

2664952,2,B000J10F6O,"The movie is definitely entertaining on a cheesy level, the bad acting, boobs, and cheap gore scenes make this movie a definite low-budget B movie. Only reason I kind of enjoyed it is that my bands songs were used through out the movie and all through the credits.

2664953,1,B000J10F6O,"In the old days even shlock cinema had some connection to the movie business. A first timer had to go out a buy film and lights and other equipment and try to do their best. Then came the 1980's and a glut of handheld vhs movies made by a guy who loved horror movies or someone wanting some money.  This is above those barely as it's about at that skill level , but it's what you'd expect from a movie made with so little money. But at least it's not as bad as they old 80's-90's hand held video cam movies. It's below grade b; it's down to grade d level which means the gore scenes are not too bad actually, and that's a kudos to the crew on this one.  The story isn't true and the killer has on what looks like a eddie from ""iron maiden"" mask on. Or at least that's how it looks.  Still I have seen so many of these very bottom of the budget made outside of any filming experience by first timers; that I knew what to expect.  It's a bad movie but it has it's moments.  And that's better than alot of those other no budget efforts out there but is for fans of no budget horror films only.",1240358400,6,1090,4.0046082949308754
2664954,1,B000J10F6O,"We, Sid the Elf, have seen a ton of crappy movies in our time. It's our lifeblood. There's nothing we enjoy more than a movie trying to be legitamately good and falling on its face, causing us to fall on the floor laughing. We consider&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Death-Ring/dp/B00069QD74/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Death Ring</a>&nbsp;the best movie we've ever seen--seriously. We once reviewed a film called&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wicked-Games/dp/B0002VEWR4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wicked Games</a>. Here's a line from our review, ""We are 100% convinced that this mess was filmed in one day with a home video camera, and a very cheap one at that."" We gave Wicked Games 4 stars so obviously we don't have a problem with low-budget bad movies. But this one was truly awful in every way imaginable. We decided to pick this one up because the cover passed the movie off as kind of a based on a true story version of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Halloween/dp/B000RIWAVW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Halloween</a>&nbsp;which could not be more up our alley. Not so much. Excellent marketing idea, though by the losers who made this film, take something successful and ride its coattails by leading people to believe your product is similar. Then add the ""based on a true story twist"" and you've snookered enough people in to keep yourself in lattes and hybrids for at least a few years. Check out Derek Osedach on IMDB and you'll see this is a patern.

The film starts out with a kid watching his mother being raped and killed by guys in white masks. One of the killer's bullets hits a steam pipe the kid is hiding behind, burning him and badly disfiguring him. So the kid gets sent off to a sanitarium. That's the true story part of the film, not that interesting. Then we have some complete yambags years later who utter ""dude"" every two seconds. These winners are having a halloween party. The disfigured guy escapes from the sanitarium and makes his way back to his old house--you guessed it, the same house where the halloween party is taking place. And, if Sid was a betting man, the producer's house as well. While we're on this subject, there is absolutely no way that this film cost more than $2000 to make. Anyway, the disfigured guy is wearing a copper mask and black getup, this is aparently the same costume as one of the party-planners. Not that this matters mind you, because the disfigured guy just obliterates the idiot at the door letting people in. So once he's inside, the killer just takes people out in some really gory ways, appealing to people who like that sort of thing. So it had that going for it as well as some truly lukewarm girl-girl makeout scenes. A decent ammount of gore and chicks kissing chicks, and a few nude shots. Those are the highlights. I'd love to see the people who enjoyed this flick.

At the end, the killer gets away from the party house after killing mostly everybody because all the partygoers and even the cops believe the whole scene to be an elaborate hoax by the hosts of the party. The last thing we see is the killer wearing a paper plate and magic marker mask--seriously--getting picked up while hitchhiking by a guy in a '93 Chevy Cavalier. What does this mean? Well, for one, that our hypothesized $2000 budget for the film is probably grossly over estimated, and that there is room for a sequel. For the sake of horror fans, let's hope the stars, director, and producer stay on at their landscaping/cashier/Starbucks barrista jobs instead of making a sequel to this crap.

Sid believes it is needless to say that we are recomend staying away from this garbage. If you're a huge Halloween fan, like us, you will be temped to pick this one up. Resist the urge, this film is nothing like Halloween. Not even remotely in the same league. And yes, this is the worst film we have ever seen. And yes we were pretty steamed that we wasted time watching the crap. We only reserve this barb for films we truly hate with a passion: If you do decide to rent this movie, when you return it to your local video store, scream ""He's gone! The Evil is gone from here!""",1222819200,4,4254,4.980309423347398
2664955,2,B000J10F6O,"Ok, they tried and thats why they deserved a review: The plot overall is a little old,you know,the mother gets raped and murdered in front of her kid, the kid gets nutts,goes to a hospital,grows older, escapes, and seeks for revenge. Two things in the movie that made me laugh was when one of the girls gets handcuffed to a bed (lift that side of the bed and your free!) and the other one, another girl blocks a door by putting a chair to hold the door closed by the knob(but,the door opens the other way, but nobody noticed during the film!!! o my god) ok, i still enjoy a little watching B horror films.",1191888000,3,605,4.269565217391304
2664956,1,B000J10F6O,"This has to be the worst movie I have ever seen in any genre! The acting is so bad that these people can't even pull off a McDonald's commercial! Even worse, is that the story is not even based on actual events. The actors can't even die well, meaning if you enjoy gore this thing will just put you to sleep. The obligitory lesbian scenes are overused to the point of being boring as well. I spent almost $5.00 at Blockbuster for this DVD rental, while it should be $3.00 to own, if you really want to waste the 1.20 mins. to watch it. If the makers took their time just a bit,it may have been a decent story, as it does show some promise with the Halloween party prank(which is the subplot),but it falls short as being a direct to video, and tries to borrow too much fromm other worthy classics.",1183248000,5,796,4.243421052631579

8148391,2,B000J10F6O,"It all starts with some kid named Christopher Vale who's hiding under a bed while witnessing his beautiful mother being tortured and killed by 2 psychos wearing blank white-faced masks.  For no clear rhyme or reason his  father is assisting them in this crime.  After they've totally killed his mother Christopher, ever nervous, crawls out from under the bed towards a furnace.  So the invaders shoot at him there by hitting the furnace and winding up torching poor Christopher's face, arms, hands and whatnot.  It's also never explained as to where the psychos went and why Chris's father is thinking about killing him but turns the gun on himself.  That whole beginning is not explained at all.  Some time goes by and Chris is in a mental hospital terribly burned.  An uncouth guard there decides to be a creep and wear a familiar white mask and tease poor Chris.  Well it isn't long before the fellow patients witness him killing that nasty guard and somehow having no trouble what-so-ever escaping.  What kind of security does this hospital have anyway?  All that happened after that is Chris makes it to a gas station stop and first kills a young teenage guy who has an executioner costume and play weapons that somehow can actually kill a person.  What?!  He then takes to killing the guys girlfriend making her think that it was her boyfriend in the costume.  Eventually as you would guess he finds his way to their party to claim more victims.  The rest of the movie just quickly goes down hill soon after. All I can say is this movie boasts very dull and one-dimensional characters, terrible gore effects, god awful acting, slow deaths, unconvincing deaths, a plot that makes absolutly no sense,  to say nothing of the death scenes proving so bad that they're just so friggin' funny.  The only thing this movie has to offer is good nudity and sex scenes, other than that this movie just has nothing to offer anyone with a taste for slashers that actually get it right like, Friday the 13th(1980+2009),  A Nightmare on Elm Street(1984), Silent Night, Deadly Night(1984+2012), Halloween(1978)  Iced, and Silent Madness.
