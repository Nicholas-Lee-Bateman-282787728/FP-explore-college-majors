  Three Men and a Comic Book: Bart goes to a comic-book collection and sees the very first issue of Radioactive Man for $100. Seeing he doesn't have enough money, he decides to get a job. When he only gets 50 cents for working really hard, Bart tries to get the issue for $35. But, when he sees Milhouse and Martin at the Android's Dungeon, they decide to put their money together and buy it. But chaos stirs after all of the 3 kids think the others are trying to steal the comic book. It ends up with Milhouse dangling by the edge and the comic book blowing away. Will Bart choose poor Milhouse and let the comic book blow away or will he choose the priceless comic book and let Milhouse fall to his possible death? Get the video to find out. Three Men and a Comic Book is an overall good episode and I'll give it a 10/10.

  Lisa's Substitute: When Lisa's teacher comes down with Lyme Disease, a substitute teacher named Mr. Bergstrom comes in. Meanwhile, Bart's class has to pick a class president. Nominated are Bart and Martin. Lisa starts to have a crush on Mr. Bergstrom. Lisa sees her substitute teacher and Homer makes her feel like a fool. When Mr. Bergstrom sees that Lisa and Homer don't have a very good relationship, Bergstrom talks to Homer and says he should be a better role model. Looking forward to talking to Mr. Bergstrom and saying she likes him, she goes into her classroom to find Ms. Hoover back and fine. Meanwhile, Bart is sure of his victory, but everybody but Martin and his friend Wendell forgets to vote. Lisa is devastated by Mr. Bergstrom's leaving and blames it on Homer, calling him a babboon. So Lisa's mad and sad and Bart's sad because he lost the election. What will happen to the family? Will Homer continue to be despised by Lisa? Find out by watching Lisa's Substitute! Overall, Lisa's Substitute is a good episode and deserves a 8. That means out of a possible 20, The Best of The Simpsons, Vol. 9 gets an 18, scoring a 5 star rating! Buy it and you'll love it.",1093392000,,2155,4.388471177944862
7879205,5,6304907745,"I'm sort of a Simpsons fan by default; my boyfriend is a fanatic, which means I've seen every episode multiple times. One Friday night, we decided to put together a list of our top 25 episodes, and ""Three Men and a Comic Book"" came out #4. Bart, Milhouse, and Martin pool their money to purchase Radioactive Man #1, but when they begin fighting over the comic, hilarity ensues. ""Lisa's Substitue"" is also a great episode (#23 on our list), but in many ways, it's more poignant than funny. Lisa's regular teacher, Mrs. Hoover, is out with an extended illness, so Lisa's class gets a young, hip substitute who actually cares about teaching. Lisa quickly develops a crush on the teacher (voiced by Dustin Hoffman in an uncredited appearance) and strikes an unfavorable comparison between the substitute and the other male role model in her life, her father.
This is also a great set for introducing others to The Simpsons. My boyfriend's father was very skeptical, but when we showed him these two episodes, he really enjoyed them. If you're a fan of the show yourself, this set is a must-have.",1028851200,,1091,4.747368421052632
