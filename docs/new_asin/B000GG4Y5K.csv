Boxed set have the choice of commentary ""On"" or ""Off""--really enjoy the ""behind the scenes"" information.

2608682,5,B000GG4Y5K,"If you enjoy this show, then I would recommend purchasing the seasons to add to your dvd collection.

2608683,5,B000GG4Y5K,"""It's logic. It's rationality. It's using your mind to solve the biggest mysteries we know.""

If you're interested in this box-set, you've probably already seen the show, so I'll just summarize briefly. In ""Numb3rs,"" the character Charlie Eppes (played David Krumholtz) helps his FBI agent brother Don Eppes (Rob Morrow) to solve cases. He's a professor at a university and a mathematical genius. He's also assisted by his good friend and colleague, Larry Fleinhardt.

In this second season, some fun new things come into the mix. The characters of Megan and Colby join the mix. They make wonderful additions to the show. The opening intro has been changed to be more exciting and interesting, which hints at changes in the show. The cast is really getting into its groove and the writing is very strong. With guest-appearances by folks such as Bill Nye, this show definitely doesn't suffer from a sophomore slump.

This DVD set offers all episodes from the second season. All are closed-captioned and feature Dolby Digital sound.

This also comes with some special features, which are also closed-captioned. Unlike a lot of other DVD season sets, the special features are accessible on the first and second discs, rather than all on the last disc. You get behind-the-scenes with David Krumholtz and show co-creator Nicholas Falacci. There's also a blooper reel, a season retrospective and an inside look at the production of one of the episodes. There's also commentaries by cast and crew (including Bill Nye) for several episodes, generally one per disc.",1164067200,24,1556,5.090196078431372
2608684,5,B000GG4Y5K,"Until a few months ago, I had never heard of this series.  I live in England where it is not widely known. I first learned about it when I was flicking through the recommendations on Amazon.com (well done to Amazon by the way, great feature, they sometimes seem to know my tastes better than I know myself!) and after reading the online reviews I was compelled to order season one, though I'D NEVER EVEN SEEN AN EPISODE!

I absolutely love detective / action programs and am an avid fan of the likes of 'Bones' and '24' and never miss an episode of 'House MD' (which I've included in this review since as every House fan knows, they solve illnesses instead of crimes but the format is the same).  So I firstly, decided to give 'numb3rs' a chance because the new approach of 'maths' (as we English call it) to solve crime seemed intriguing.

Secondly, I noticed that Ridley and Tony Scott had put their names to it, which to me gave it excellent credentials since I am a fan of both their work, especially Ridley Scott since I loved his work on 'Gladiator' and 'Kingdom of Heaven'.

My final reason for buying the boxset could be construed as a bit of a shallow one, that is I've had a bit of a soft spot for Rob Morrow since 'Northern Exposure', I also knew him to be a good actor, honestly.

Cutting a long story short, I got season one and after watching only two episodes I immediately pre-ordered season two, I enjoyed it that much.

So, to the series itself.  The stories are excellently written and the more you watch, the more addictive it becomes.  All the characters are well rounded (not just the key ones) and you actually care what happens to them which to me is the essential to a good drama.  You see their  interactions while solving the case, but also when its finished, the key characters seem equally as close to one another.

The main premise of the program is that there are two brothers (both equally lovely in their own particular way, purely from a female perspective).  The older, Don Eppes (played excellently by the afore mentioned Mr Morrow) is an FBI agent who calls upon his younger brother Charlie (or to give his full title Professor Charles Edward Eppes) to help him solve his cases through maths.  Charlie (played by the very attractive David Krumholtz) is a mathematical genius who uses equations and algorythms in order to for example, decide the next target for a robbery or the whereabouts of a suspect.  Don't be put off by the idea of all those sums however, being something of a mathsphobe myself (my brain tends to shut down in self defense when comfronted by too many numbers) I still found it fascinating and all the complex stuff is explained using methaphors and symbolism making it really easy to follow.

Though ultimately, the plot focuses on the pursuit of the guilty, the series is also largely about family, in its many guises, be it the Eppes family itself, the close knit FBI team or Charlie and his colleagues at the university.  Special mention should be given to Judd Hirsh as Don and Charlie's father, Alan Eppes, who helps bridge the gap between his two sons, who are in many ways different but also in may ways alike.  Hirsch plays the part with warmth and is a perfect balance for his offspring, always trying to see things from both their perspectives and find common ground to heal the ever diminishing rift between them.

Season two, is as good as if not better than the first.  There have been some changes, Sabrina Lloyd's character has been replaced by Megan Reeves (played by Diane Farr) and there has been an introduction of a new character, an FBI agent played by Dylan Bruno, but both fit in very well and help rather than hinder the show.  The supporting cast is also brilliant. It is good to see that Lou Diamond Phillips, reprises his role as Agent Edgerton from the first series, in the episode entitled 'Toxin'.  Here's hoping that we see more of this character in future series as Phillips is a great actor.  Colin Hanks also makes a memorable appearance as Charlie's mathematical rival, Penfield in 'Convergence'.  How Charlie spars with his 'nemesis' is really humourous as they try desperately to get one better than each other. Another particularly good episode is 'Rampage' which without giving too much away, looks at how Charlie's life is affected when he suffers a brush with death in a place that he normally considers safe, and how he must overcome the fear to help Don.

In conclusion, I recommend this series to anyone who enjoys a show where you have to go through the process of solving a crime with the cast members, to take the journey with them as it were, to find the bad guys.  If you like the idea of a different approach to crime fighting and want to watch an intelligent, interesting program filled with likeable characters and interesting plot twists, give it a go.  ALL THE VARIABLES IN 'NUMB3RS ADD UP TO A TRULY REWARDING VIEWING EXPERIENCE!",1162857600,32,4943,4.600227790432802
2608685,4,B000GG4Y5K,"please, forgive my bad english.

first, there is a mistake in the data: the announced english subtitles are missing, so it is sometimes hard to follow, because I'm a foreigner (Germany).

This new kind of series is intelligent, with marvellous actors (great judd hirsch as the dad of the brothers, lou diamond phillips two times in a small part and various other brilliant actors) and always with interesting subjects (themes).

So, I give only 4 stars, because of the missing but announced subtitles.

If there were subtitles, no question, 5 stars!!!

Thanks, PARAMOUNT for this great show, but please give us subtitles for box no. 3. Thanks!",1162166400,8,643,4.97196261682243
2608686,5,B000GG4Y5K,"Even for a bad math-student like me, this show is so cool. It's thoroughly and really simplify all the math thing related to the case. Love the cast and the script. I'm waiting for the third season to come out now.",1161043200,5,214,4.2439024390243905
2608687,5,B000GG4Y5K,"With its second season, this absorbing and original crime drama seems to have matured and blossomed, making it one of the more entertaining shows on network t.v.  The premise of using numbers and mathematical equations to solve crimes is unique and the writers have made their integrations a little more down to earth and plausible this season.  The writers were also able to incorporate personal sidebars to help us identify more with all of the characters and do so without losing focus of the episode's main plots.

Much of the credit for the superior quality of this show goes to its talented cast:  Rob Morrow exudes a strong sense of duty as Don Eppes; he is dedicated to the point of having very little personal life; David Krumholtz is amazing as the brilliant Charlie Eppes, a world away at times from his older brother; Krumholtz is perfect in explaining his theories and algorithms, etc., he seems perfectly at home with some tricky dialogue and his personal demons seem to make him even more approachable; Navi Rawat (sp) is charming as Charlie's unrequited love, and she brings a lot of warmth to the show; Alimi Ballard is good as the stoic Dave Sinclair, who is supremely focused and dedicated as well; Judd Hirsch is perfect as the boy's wise father, recently widowed and trying to jumpstart his life; Peter MacNicol, underused in the first season, gets a little more exposure this season by getting more involved in the cases.  Two new additions this season are also beneficial:  Julie Farr as Megan, the forensic psychologist, brings a sense of strength, compassion and humor to her role; and husky Dylan Bruno brings a sense of commitment and dedication along with his impressive pecs.

This season also features some strong guest performances from Will Patton, Robert Forster, and Jobeth Williams.

You can count on one thing with NUMB3RS: It's absorbing and very entertaining.",1160956800,14,1897,4.924764890282131

I am intrigued by solving seemingly impossible cases with the use of math and statistics and very interested because of the direction, writing, the plots and mysteries to be solved.

2609101,5,B000GG4Y5K,"My husband and I started watching ""Numb3ers"" a few weeks ago just to try it out and I've really enjoyed it. My husband thinks it's kinda goofy and far-fetched, but even so, I love listening to Charlie Eppes' interesting applied math analogies and hearing about game theory, set theory, and other things I never even heard about during my many years as an engineering major. P vs. NP? What's that? Seems like it's ""a thing"" (I came across another movie on amazon prime dealing with that). I don't know if it's really possible to catch criminals using mathematical models and algorithms, but the show is still very entertaining, and I also enjoy the side stories with the Eppes family and Charlie's professor friend, Larry.",1465257600,,721,4.82258064516129

Since there is almost NOTHING I want to watch on tv anymore - seriously, I'm so put off by all the ""housewives"" who can't behave themselves and the reality phenom I almost never watch tv (except for Big Bang, Scorpion and Anthony Melchiourri on Hotel Impossible).  I'm relying much more on past series when I want to watch tv because I was so busy in the previous decade I never saw any of them.  In this series, a college math professor helps his FBI brother using math to find the bad guys.  Using math to solve crimes is interesting by itself, but the extra family and friends dynamic in this series keeps me coming back. I like the actors;  Judd Hirsh and Peter MacNicol are great support.

It takes some suspension of disbelief to accept that one person could be expert in some many different mathematical disciplines and could create new algorithms so quickly, always in time to thwart the evil doers, but hey, it's entertainment, not a documentary! The casting is great, Rob Morrow, David Krumholtz, Judd Hirsch, Peter MacNichol, Navi Rawat, Alimi Ballard, Dylan Bruno, Dianne Farr - some names you know, some you won't, but they are all good (some great) actors.

Id seen every episode when the show ran on TV, so I do remember most of the plots, but its great to see them again. And again and again and again, because Im watching them over and over. Right now Im going through to watch with commentary.
NUMB3RS is a show that, in addition to great action, makes the viewer think, which is something a lot of procedurals dont. I have to say that I don't always follow Charlie and Larrys explanations, but I find them fascinating.
I was thrilled to see Lou Diamond Phillips as Agent Edgerton again. The other guest stars were a real treat, especially Graham Greene.

2609275,5,B000GG4Y5K,"A great season now on Amazon Prime. This is where the show really kicks off and hits the ground running and doesn't stop at all. My only pet peeve (and this isn't anything big at all) is that when I watched these episodes on DVD they were in a different order. Not a big thing, but when you marathon this series it changes the rhythm.

Anyhow, this season is great because it brings in the cool characters of Colby Granger and Megan Reeves to the FBI and expands on the characters of Larry Fleinhardt and Amita Ramanujan, as well as introduce a more stable love interest for Don Epps: Assistant Prosecutor Robin Brooks, who in later seasons is a much more bigger character. Also, look out for the NYPD character of Gary Walker, all-around cool tough guy and the triumphant return of Ian Edgerton, sniper extraordinaire.",1448236800,,819,4.609589041095891

2609295,5,B000GG4Y5K,"Although the basic premise gets stretched to unbelievable proportions--honestly, would the FBI let him consult on every bloody case like this without owning him?--the writing is consistently intelligent, witty and engaging. The characters are real; they grow from show to show and season to season. Formulaic because it has to be, this is one of the best crime/suspense dramas ever made for tv.

2609313,5,B000GG4Y5K,"Revisiting this series is a real treat. So much drivel on American TV means I revel in well-crafted  presentations that require more than a few brain cells. Typically, only the Brits accomplish this. The balance between action and romance is maintained well and the main characters are both credible and consistent over several years of production effort. The advanced math language is impenetrable but the explanations carry the narrative coloration nicely for us mere mortals. Highly recommended as a standout in a popular genre that often dissolves into boilerplate.",1444953600,,569,5.393258426966292

Therefore producing an attitude change in the student so that they feel motivated to learn Algebra 1 or other HS math skill.  The student observer sees why they can achieve a longer term goal by learning and using mathematics.
Each episode is mostly independent of previous episodes. There is a companion book, ""The Numbers behind Numbers"" which an instructor might also use for student discussions.
WARNING - some graphic material is presented!  High school students probably wouldn't object but parents and administrators might not approve such a presentation in a classroom.  Prepare to explain your purpose.  This is a ""why and how applied"" discussion not a instruction in the actual details.

2610039,5,B000GG4Y5K,"""Numb3rs"" is one of the best police / crime dramas to come from Hollywood.  Special Agent Don Eppes (Rob Morrow) leads his FBI team to solve cases of murder and mayhem with the help of his genius brother, Charlie Eppes, a math professor at nearby CalSci.  This series sports good writing, interesting character interaction and development, and reliable (occasionally excellent) performances.

In Season 2, FBI Agent Megan Reeves (Diane Farr) became one of my favorite characters.  Granted hers is a supporting role, mostly to provide context and plot progression / exposition.  This character is a gem, though.  She's one part FBI special agent, one part profiler, and one part caring human being.  She's never afraid to ask the question that the guys don't want to admit they don't know.  Mostly, she's just a fun character with some great one-liners.",1393632000,,852,5.079136690647482
2610040,5,B000GG4Y5K,"This is a great show.  I only wish it had run more episodes instead of the abbreviated final season.  However, they did do one thing that the producers of a series are able to do when they leave on their terms, that is, they had a finale which resolved all of the character loose ends, etc.  The final episode is a terrific, very heart warming.

Now for the serious and good stuff.  I see Numb3rs as much more complex of a show than just an FBI again and a math professor teaming up to solve crime.  In fact, to me the real story is the inter relationship between the 2 brothers and then between them and the father.  These are 2 siblings as different form each other as any siblings can be.  Through some of the dialogue it is obvious that in their childhoods there was some resentment form both to the other.  However, somewhere they must have been wired correctly because here they are as adults working together, one for the FBI and one a professor.  Still, in adult life the brothers have found a bond and the closeness of this bond becomes more and more evident as they complement each other in this difficult work.  The actors, David Krumholz and Rob Morrow develop a strong chemistry and are very believable on screen.  Of course what can one say about Judd Hirsch, he hasn't missed a beat in all these years, he is a consummate professional.  His character as the father to the two brothers works out great.  One can also see that it is never too late to benefit from the wisdom of the previous generation.

I love Numb3rs, and watch certain episodes again and again.  Oh, I forgot to mention, the brothers also grow in their relationships with their respective girl friends as well.  In short this is just a great show, and it should be considering the executive producers, Ridley Scott, (Alien), and his late brother Tony Scott.",1393632000,,1839,4.490963855421687

2610042,2,B000GG4Y5K,"I love the Numbers shows, but the buffering every few minutes gets really old.  Is there anything that you can do to reduce how often buffering happens?",1393545600,,152,4.62962962962963
2610043,4,B000GG4Y5K,"I'm not really into the same old police dramas, so I was glad to see one with some imagination. I was also glad to see a new female, the old one was boring. I like that there aren't a lot of inter-agency romances.",1393372800,,213,3.9767441860465116
2610044,5,B000GG4Y5K,This series is always fun to watch.  It's a smart drama with humor and wit.  Characters are very likeable and well-played.,1393286400,,122,4.761904761904762
2610055,5,B000GG4Y5K,"This is one of those shows that is just a solid steady program.  It's not the kind of epic show (for me anyway) like Lost for example that you very much look forward to seeing every week (IT'S WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND ""BLANK SHOW"" IS ON YESSSSS!!!)
But it's just an enjoyable, steady and consistently satisfying show to watch.
The two main characters are brothers Don the cool mans man FBI agent and his younger brother Charlie (five years younger) who graduated high school the same year as his older brother and went on to Princeton to become a renowned mathematician prodigy.
In the pilot episode FBI special agent Don gets help from his brother on a case he can't crack.
At the time it seems to have never crossed his mind (or the viewers I would think) to use his math professor genius brother as a resource in helping him to solve crimes.
The writing is so unique and the way they have Charlie use his math to predict crime patterns by creating algorithms or find the suspect using ""I'll take your word for it"" math formulas is ..... well genius!
They always have a ""let me explain this crazy math formula in a way all you morons can relate to it"" metaphors and like Charlie, once you've seen a few shows, you start to believe that math can solve just about any problem life has to throw at us.
Sounds crazy but if you watch the show you'll see what I mean and you'll believe it too.  (because it's true)
Remember Doogie Howser, M.D?  This is the math/crime solving professor version of Doogie as a grown up.  So it's easier to believe because he's an adult (slightly socially inept but very believeable)
At the very least you feel like you learned something after every episode.  You won't by any means be able to convey what you learned to anyone without sounding like a total moron.  But hey, at least you know, that you um know ..... um....you know?",1392854400,,1854,4.454277286135693

2610057,4,B000GG4Y5K,"The acting is very good here. The FBI agents do not look like bumbling fools when they try to apprehend
suspects. The characters treat each other respectfully. The math and science reduced my rating to 4 starts, even though that is my field. There will be times in each show when a typical viewer will have no idea what the math and science explanations mean. They do try to give commonplace analogies to aid understanding and that is probably enough for most people. In contrast to Damages, for example, one likes these FBI agents and each show's ending usually lightens the mood before bedtime.",1392163200,,596,4.740384615384615

2610098,4,B000GG4Y5K,"First and foremost, I like the way all the characters are portrayed. Good acting across the board. Personally, I enjoy the goofy, over-serious graphics that are meant to show the math-mind in action. Stories less than perfect, but it doesn't matter much!",1390348800,,254,5.071428571428571

2610105,4,B000GG4Y5K,I thought the series really improved over the first season. The characters are more fully realized and the relationships are being developed. It is also nice that Charlie isn't always the only one who has the answer!,1388275200,,216,4.864864864864865

2610111,5,B000GG4Y5K,"This show is amazing!!!! The first season was great but this one's even better! The show itself is totally different from other crime dramas. I love how it combines family life and shares the lifestyles of everyone (Don, Charlie, Alan, Amita, etc.) in the show, almost as if they all are equal characters. I only wish that they were never cancelled :( I would 100% recommend this to anyone who loves not only criminal justice and mathematics but also comedy and family.",1383696000,,469,4.7317073170731705

2610116,5,B000GG4Y5K,The cast is great. The stories are great. Just a damn good show. My wife and I have always liked the way Numb3rs handles the main story and the relationship growth of the characters. Neither feels over emphasized compared to the other. This season has episodes where one of the characters isn't there and I'm immediately aware of it. I miss them in that episode and I wonder what that character would have done had he/she been there. Guests are handled great and I forgot Lou Diamond Phillips had been making appearances since the first season.,1380240000,,544,4.677083333333333

I find myself looking for extra time to watch. The characters are unique. Who ever heard of a math genius FBI guy? Most of the episodes I find to be surprised at how they solve the crimes. The extended family is a delight. Judd Hirsch plays a great father role. I can't wait to watch the next season!",1379548800,,434,4.117647058823529

2610132,3,B000GG4Y5K,"correct me if I am wrong, but The Fbi does not investigate murders except maybe on fed property.
Other than that, great show. I love the mathy stuff even though most of it is theoretical and would not hold up in court or most of the  microcosm of real life.",1379289600,,257,4.14
2610133,4,B000GG4Y5K,Season 2 had nice character development--Charlie becomes more mature while remaining gifted. The plots also become more complex and not as formulaic. Enjoyable tv.,1378944000,,163,5.833333333333333
2610134,5,B000GG4Y5K,Pretty good escapism . Like the professor friend . Plots not that predictable but a little far fetched but that's escapism right.,1378512000,,129,4.909090909090909

Still loving the show (see review for Season 1), and getting rather invested in the characters. I love police procedural fiction in all media forms.

2610163,4,B000GG4Y5K,Numbers is highly entertaining action crime fighting  with excellent performances grounded by the iconic judd Hirsch as the near perfect patriarch of A type mathematician genius & FBI Wyatt Earp type crime fighting duo.

I like Rob Murrow from way back when he was on ""Northern Exposure""... The show is structured around math and how anything can be solved via some mathematical algorithm. Generally not a bad idea and shows how math is everywhere, so not a bad idea. The core characters - 2 brothers, father - are reasonably well developed but the rest of the team a bit ""too pretty"" and formulaic and the stories never go beyond cookie cutter predictability.",1372204800,,606,4.568807339449541

It has been established more about the Epp's brothers relationship and the side stories concerning the boys father and the love interest of the professor is more established.  The plots remain interesting and Charlie's mentor, the physics guy is a nice addition.  They have recurring guest stars and are slowly (too slowly) filling out the backstories somewhat.  I find that some of the math explanations given in the squad room-sometimes with minutes to spare- un realistic.  I would rather they went into them at the end some of the time.  It ""almost"" is a really good show; but just slightly misses the mark for me; probably because I don 't find Charlie to be a character that has depth.",1361836800,,732,4.6796875

2610256,3,B000GG4Y5K,"Maybe I'm a bit harsh, but here's how I see this series:
*it tries to be cerebral, but misses
*it take stories right out of the news
*it glosses over when it could go deeper
*the producers couldn't get enough ratings in the first season, so they replaced the female lead no-nonsense agent with one wearing California chic: camisoles, vintage jewelry, tight shirts, lots of makeup, and a bit of blonde attitude
*they brought in a beefcake male agent in the second season for?
*the good guys always win
*a relationship between Charlie and his protege ends ridiculously
*is someone supposed to have Aspergers?
OK... since I've been a bit harsh, let me point out the positive:
*Judd Hirsch is amazing! I mean, he's nearly 80 and he's got more energy than both his two sons. Go Judd!
*Charlie's sidekick professor (actor McNichols) is hilarious, but enough with the white food already!
*The craftsman house is glorious and so are the set interiors
Which reminds me (uh-oh, I feel a negative coming on), what is with the glossy FBI headquarters??? The big flat screens, the dark moody interiors, the glass white boards, the up-to-date computers and friendly work stations? This is supposed to be the Feds, not 24!
As I say, although I've torn this series apart, the concept and Hirsch bring me back when there's nothing else to watch.",1360454400,2,1328,4.778260869565218

Time allows the writers to share more and more of the characters backgrounds.  Where they've come from.  Why they do what they do.  The writing continues to gain believability and the directors continue to improve the view.  You feel like you're right there.  You laugh, celebrate, and cry along with them.  They become an extension of your family.  Cheer for the good guys.  Bad guys can go to hell! :)",1357689600,,560,4.739583333333333
2610269,5,B000GG4Y5K,"Season Two of ""Numb3rs"" was the first full-length season of the series--the 24 episodes were first broadcast on CBS from September 2005 to May 2006.  Although there are some good new additions to the cast in this season, the story still centers around Don Eppes (Rob Morrow), a Los Angeles FBI agent, and his younger brother Charlie (David Krumholtz), a mathematics professor who consults for the FBI and uses math to help his brother's team solve crimes such as murder, terrorism, meth production, child abuse, arson, gang violence, and phishing.

This season delves a little more into the personal and family issues of the two brothers and their father, Alan (Judd Hirsch).  The information used to solve the crimes in Season Two is wide ranging--the viewer learns about traffic volume sensors, chess, cell phones, CDs, and casino gambling, and some of the mathematical concepts mentioned are game theory, probability, data mining (and the ethical issues that go with it), and encryption.

There are also special features on this six-DVD set that describe the production of the show.  Although a few of the episodes about Iraq already seem a bit dated, Season Two of this top-notch crime drama is very strong.",1355270400,,1211,5.035

The villains they had were scarier than the normal type: they were constantly trying to be 2 steps ahead of the gang and they succeeded.  There were certain parts that were forced in, in order to keep it under an hour, but it was only *after* watching the episode that I noticed them.  It was a good, engrossing episode.

When a skull is found that would possibly ruin the engrained thought that Native American's are the first people to live on this continent, some persons become anxious to make sure the skull disappears. Is it a scientist or a local Native?

Ok, not perfectly so for purists but the show makes one think about different ways in which mathematics can be and is used in the series.

I showed a couple shows to my high school classes and overall they enjoyed it - some already were watching the series.  The tough part is that the math can be a bit heavy, thus ""Charlievision"" is the best creation of the series.  Whenever the main mathematician, Charlie, goes off on a real-world comparative model for the math he is explaining they use a different type of filming technique.

The character development is also pretty good.  Main downfall is the overly Hollywoodish elements of too much violence and occasionally other risque plots making it less appropriate for younger audiences.

After viewing six episodes,
1. The plots are are less believable in this series as far as the application of maths are concerned.
2. It's a pity that there is no subtitling. There is much more background noise these days in this sort of serie. I suppose that it seems more realistic but when you get a bit older and your hearing gets a little worse you just need clear talk. By the way, the new female FBI agent doesn't speak at all clearly. Seems to be mumbling all the time.
All in all a bit disappointing and I have doubts about buying a 3rd series.",1185408000,5,562,4.212962962962963

2610345,5,B000GG4Y5K,"I love this show, for reasons I didn't expect. It's more than a show about catching the bad guys, and how number theories can be used to hunt them down. It's mostly about the Eppes family, and how the two sons and father are coming together to deal with life, and each other, after the loss of their wife and mother. The father and two sons are very different people, but love each other dearly, in spite of the different ways they see, and function, in the world.

Now with season two, I've just fallen harder for the show. I love the consistency of the story-lines, and the very natural feeling the show has in dealing with the relationships while the criminal cases are played out. No one magically changes overnight, and issues are brought up, and dealt with, in a way that feels realistic. Squabbles between the family members aren't overplayed, or over blown, and neither are the scenes when they come together and 'make up' or just need to spend 'face time' together. There continues to be a very strong feeling of family, family ties and the love that keeps them seeking each other out for company.

The actors do a wonderful job of portraying their characters as three-dimensional, complicated people who are doing their best to understand the others in their lives.

David Krumholtz does an exceptional job portraying Charlie, and how he's grown during the two seasons. While he may have seemed coddled to others, safe and secure in his 'bubble' of being raised as 'special', it's clear that Charlie's very keenly felt the burden of his difference. His high school years (he graduated at age 13) were hell for him, and he's conscious of the fact that he doesn't fit in outside of his life as a professor, or Acadamenia. While he's now comfortable with his role as teacher, and working with his friends and peers, he's taken some very hard steps toward seeing and dealing with the dark side of life. In trying to connect with his FBI brother, who's still very protective of what Charlie is exposed to, he is still tremendously bothered and upset by what he sees, and sometimes, must do. But Charlie keeps stepping up to the plate when he realizes that his math can do more than describe the universe around him, it can, and does, help save lives. But he's also becoming torn between spending his 'best years' as a mathematician and making great breakthroughs in his field, or spending his time and energies helping his brother save people. This is playing out very well by Krumholtz and the writers of the show.

Rob Morrow is excellent as Don, the older brother. Because of Charlie's gift, and the amount of time, energy (and presumably money) that was spent to give Charlie the education and training he needed to fulfill his potential, Don was left to himself quite a bit growing up. More outgoing and athletic than Charlie, Don learned to be self-sufficient very early. He's protective of his younger brother, yet at the same time not inclined to coddle him as much as other's would. While he does make exceptions for the way Charlies' mind works, he also encourages Charlie to fight his own battles, and take on his own challenges, making it clear he has Charlie's back. Even when it means fighting with his father over what Charlie can, and can't, handle. Morrow does a wonderful job showing the complex relationship Don has with is father and brother. Because of what he does, what he sees, he can seem very detached at times. But it's clear that underneath all the darkness he has to deal with that the walls he's built up are to protect those he loves. He wants to connect with Charlie and his father as much as they want to connect with him, but he wants to protect them as well. Don is like that onion, with many layers and as they're removed we get to learn more about him, who he really is inside, just as his family does.

And I can't say enough about Judd Hirch, who plays their father. I'm thrilled to see his character is still just as vital a part of the story line in the second season as the first. He's just as complicated as his sons, and you get the feeling that his wisdom is well earned. But neither is he incapable of being wrong, nor admitting to it. His love for his two boys is clear, and your heart aches for him as he also takes his first steps out into dating once again, dealing with his wife's memory, and coming back out of retirement. I love it when the three of them work together on a case. You just can't beat the Eppes family when they're focused on a problem.

All around a great show, and one my whole family loves just as much as I do.",1169769600,7,4587,4.507211538461538

While the characters are fairly enjoyable, and I like the ""genius"" angle I have two complaints. 1) Everybody (putting the father aside) is young and gorgeous. My wife says that ain't real. I agree. FBI veterans should have some battle scars. 2) I get so tired of political correctness. It rears its ugly head too often in this series.

8131700,2,B000GG4Y5K,"It's true, to an extent, that you can apply patterns from one field to another in order to find a truth that has eluded you. I guess this is called a lightbulb moment? Anyway the basic premise of this show is: a mathematician (and sometimes a physicist) have a bunch of these lightbulb moments and help the mathematician's cop-brother solve crimes. It's okay in theory but too many lightbulbs and not enough illumination from each makes the show feel pulpy and cheap. I'll give a few examples

I made it to season 2 ep 1 and we have yet to see an instance where these lightbulb moments do not pan out into a successful apprehension or shooting or whatever. Isn't that like, statistically improbable

Don seems competent at first, but after ep1 he relies so heavily on his brother? I keep telling myself as I watch that Don is solving tons of cases on his own and the show is about Charlie which is why Charlie's math needs to be the crux of every single investigation (sorry I get that shows have formulae but this one just got old fast)

Some of the math is so basic it's surprising the police force hasn't? already implemented it?

In other cases the math is so complex that the viewers are neither intended to follow nor check lol. I don't have a math background but I have a feeling that understanding the equations would not help me enjoy this show

If Charlie is such a genius and these investigations are so time-sensitive, why does half of the FBI team always sit down for a lecture from Charlie as if they're in a classroom? Like, all he has to do is convince the boss, and the boss will give orders which everyone else will obey? or I mean maybe the FBI is secretly a nest of philosophers..

Smart People in this show use a lot of big words with moderate precision rather than using more moderate vocab precisely. You barely notice after a couple episodes but sometimes it's still annoying, like when Charlie says ""the confluence of so many unrelated factors coming together"" --ah, that sneaky thesaurus.

I usually watch shows to their completion no matter how horrible they are because i want to see what happens etcetera, but i just checked and Numbers has six seasons. That's soooo much mediocrity",1510185600,,2211,4.554156171284634
