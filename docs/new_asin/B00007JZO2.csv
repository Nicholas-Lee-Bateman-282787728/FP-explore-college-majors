7977031,2,B00007JZO2,"I have to say I was dissapointed with how the final volume of Burn up excess ended! The first two episodes leading up to the finale were pretty good, and I was really excited,but the last episode made me feel as though the producers were trying to squeeze to much in at the last minute. There was way to many things left unanswered as well. I wish that at least the final episode could have been longer or the producers of the show could've made it into a 26 episode series to sum things  up completely. Heck it could've even stayed a 13 episode series if they got rid of the pointless filler episodes,and just use those episodes to go deeper into the show.m My rating 2 stars,maybe a 3.",1182556800,,687,4.2846153846153845
7977032,5,B00007JZO2,"Adoring fans of the Burn Up Excess series are left with even more comedy, action, and gratutious clevage. The ending to this series was a bit of a surprise, but one that any could make up the conclusion to.  The dub was exceptional, for the twang of each characters' tongue made the English version special, unlike some that make you want to switch off your DVD player.  Although this series as a whole didn't contain as much action as some may have hoped, it made those who watched it lips' curl up into a smile.  Through the comedy of breasts bouncing up and down and Rio kicking serious butt came a strong sense of love for the characters that took part in this series.  Look out Mecca cops, here come Rio, Maya, Lilica, Nanvel, and Yuji in the LAST EXCESS!",1072915200,2,760,4.4071428571428575
7977033,5,B00007JZO2,"To start this off, the first episode on the disc (of three) has the lowest production values of the entire Excess series.  The animation budget appears to be at the bare minimum for the entire episode.  Even the action scenes are reduced to near-slideshow quality.
However, there are many humorous scenes in that episode... especially the 'sexual assault'.  Hilarious.
I guess they were saving up the money for the final two episodes.
Well, that's fine with me becuase the final two episodes are amazing.  Well worth the price of the disc.  They really turn things loose.  It's spectacular.  The animation is spot-on, and there are so many memorable moments.  The action scenes are very creative and well-directed.  The story wraps up nicely.
I didn't much care for Nanvel up to this point.  Now I think she's my favorite character.  Yuji's got some great ""Additional Theater"" stuff on the disc as well.  ""EXCITING!""
If you enjoyed the action and pacing of the final volumes of Macross Plus, this is for you.  And Burn Up fans, this is what we've all been waiting for.  Excess at it's best.  I dare say that no one will walk away disappointed with the finale of this series.
Extras are average.  Disc layout is easy to navigate.  In the end, I've got no complaints.  Highly recommended to all anime fans.",1055894400,4,1304,4.745535714285714
