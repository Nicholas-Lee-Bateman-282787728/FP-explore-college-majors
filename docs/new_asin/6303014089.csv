534664,4,6303014089,"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) presents ""THEY MET IN BOMBAY"" (1941) ~ (92 min/B&W) -- Starring: Clark Gable, Rosalind Russell, Peter Lorre, Jessie Ralph, Reginald Owen, Matthew Boulton & Eduardo Ciannelli

Directed by Clarence Brown

Clark Gable and Rosalind Russell play Gerald Meldrick and Anya Von Duren, a pair of rival jewel thieves at large in India. Both parties are after the same prize, a priceless diamond owned by the Duchess of Beltravers (Jessie Ralph). To inveigle their way into the Duchess' confidence, Gerald poses as a Scotland Yard detective, while Anya pretends to be an aristocrat. After a series of cross-purposes, Gerald and Anya decide to team up, keeping one step ahead of a diligent police inspector (Matthew Boulton) and mercenary freighter captain Chang (Peter Lorre).

This film is fast paced and very funny and still holds up remarkably well today, even though it was made in the early 40s.

Gable & Russell work well together, too bad there wasn't more of them during their careers.

534665,5,6303014089,With two of the best actors in  Hollywood. Clak Gable and Rosalind Russel shine in this story of two  crooks that  try to outwit one another. Gable is a conman and thief that  falls for the Lovely Russel. He ends up  back in uniform as a British office in China before WW2.  he saves the lives of British soldiers and is award the Victoria Cross.  He returns the stolen money  and  leaves to face trial.,1318636800,,403,4.266666666666667
534666,4,6303014089,"They Met in Bombay is a film about two thieves, one of which is amateurish but successful (Rosalind Russell) and one who takes his time and replaces jewels with fakes to buy himself time (Clark Gable). The two stumble upon each other when they both plan to steal the same piece and join up when things do not go as well as they had planned. They escape on a Chinese boat heading toward Hong Kong with a suspicious captain whose money hungry behavior is detrimental for their cause (Peter Lorre). The thieves head toward China themselves but find themselves in the midst of an impending war with Japan. For authority purposes, Gable disguises himself as an officer in the military but gets roped into a major scuffle with the Japanese army.

There are plenty of great events throughout this movie which never leaves one bored. The cast is great too. Russell plays the beautiful damsel type to Gable, quite a departure from her comedic roles. She does well in the part though. Gable is wonderful as always, brash, crafty, and good at heart. He is very attractive in this film; it seems he was having a great deal of fun.",1158537600,8,1118,4.59
534667,4,6303014089,"Gable plays a suave jewel thief named Gerald Meldrick.  While in India, he encounters an equally smooth lady crook named Anya Von Duren; both are after the same loot: a diamond penant owned by Duchess Jessie Ralph...This is a surprisingly underrated and entertaining sleeper in which both stars are seen in rare form. Their styles are light and assured, and even though the story is quite preposterous, the smart dialogue is made smarter by the expert comic delivery of Gable and Russell. The love story angle is hardly believable, but it doesn't really matter: Gable is in fine form as the thief (who is also a master in posing) and Roz is superb as usual.  Their particular talents are exqusitely exploited in this adventure farce which was never meant to be taken seriously in the first place!  Peter Lorre plays Captain Chang - who exploits the duo to the police inspector.  But, alas, they escape - again ...",1026691200,2,913,4.7594936708860756
534668,2,6303014089,"""They Met in Bombay"" is a curious film because although Rosalind Russell and Clark Gable meet in Bombay, they seem to get a move on and wind up in several different places, trying out several different plot line developments. It's not necessarily a bad movie, but you wind up feeling lost because of all the upheavals. Features Peter Lorre as an Asian sea captain.",1004054400,,364,4.703125
