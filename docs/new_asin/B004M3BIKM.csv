8435436,5,B004M3BIKM,I am comparing this to the nightmare MET HD version. This is a charming and beautifully staged opera with traditional staging in a quaint Swiss village. I have to admit that Gutierrez is going to be the next coloratura soprano STAR. Unfortunately the tenor role played by Siragusa is mediocre. Let's get Florez and Egise Gutierrez together in this opera. Then we will have perfection.,1321056000,3,384,4.923076923076923
8435437,5,B004M3BIKM,"After readings some 'so-so reveiws' re. previous ""La Sonnambula""'s , i
was reluctant to even sample one. I now see that we should not put
too much faith in those who may even find fault in Heaven. This is pure
BelCanto, as most all the reviews here proclaim. This is the standard
-the bar is set very high. I heard Antonio Siragusa on an Opera Rara in ""Zelmira"".
And also in ""Don Pasquale"" with the show stopping, scenery eating Allesandro Corbelli. Though he possesses mastery with his tenor, he , as by Corbelli, has been upstaged once again by this 'newcomer'...Eglise Guierrez. Sort of ""I'll see your coloratura rich, melifluous voice, and raise you two"". It is such a wonder and guilty pleasure to see such a magical, and consummate staging of a romantic opera.
There is enough ""near tragedy"" for Bellini to serve up his specialty...tableux after tableux of soaring melodic majesty in waltz time.
This is a awful, stupid metaphor, it only serves to point to my giddiness over this parfait of an opera...but the words came to me that if a train whistle
was some how transported to personification, it might, in a surly huff, turn in its badge, and quit the steam train business after hearing Ms Gutierrez never fail to~reach any note she likes, and perfectly on pitch...up to what the H - - - is that?...an ""E""? My wine glass in actually vibrating the liquid in the glass.
Such a guilty pleasure, I feel I must get to ""confession"" soon.
Oh, and do not overlook Simone Alaimo, who played the ""Amazing Dr Dulcamara"" in ""L'Elisir d'Amore"" with Angela Georghiu. He will not disappoint with his grandly stentorian baritone. Orchestra is superb; the chorus threatens to steal the show as well.",1318809600,7,1691,4.716216216216216
8435438,5,B004M3BIKM,"Is there a better recording of this Bellini masterpiece? Probably not. The cast led by Eglise Gutierrez is outstanding.
The staging is inspiring and the whole conducted by Maurizio Benini brings all to a perfect production. I am an avid DVD Opera collector  and this recent purchase is likely to be much often viewed and enjoyed. If you admire Bel Canto at its finest set against beautifully inspired backdrops, then you should rush to buy this Dvd recorded by Dynamic in vivid colour and glorious sound.",1317513600,7,504,4.8604651162790695
8435439,4,B004M3BIKM,"Like others on this site, I have been waiting for recordings of the promising soprano Eglise Gutierrez.  As others have also observed, this performance has definite highs and lows, of which the highest is the performance of Ms. Gutierrez.  I barely missed hearing her in 2009 as Violetta in the Seattle Opera's production of ""La Traviata."" While she was part of what was called the ""silver"" cast (as opposed to the ""gold"" cast), the silver cast won the best reviews, largely because of her.  She has a very large and impressive voice, beautiful to listen to and with a range more than adequate to hit the high notes accurately without apparent effort. She has great presence: she commands the stage and really makes this production as successful as it is.  Also as others have noted, Antonino Siragusa has a distractingly nasal tenor voice. I almost thought at one point that he had been cast deliberately in this role, since the part he plays, Elvino, is so repulsive, at least in this day and age. Simone Alaimo makes a good count but appears too plaintive: he lacks the aloofness, the more aristocratic bearing and worldliness of Plinio Clabassi, say, in the version starring Anna Moffo.  And Sandra Pastrana is a superb Lisa, with an excellent but more restrained voice. The production is otherwise quite good and the colors are great, but as one reviewer noted, the sound is somewhat compressed. The sleepwalking scene is also a little stylized and struck me as odd.

This video was my introduction to the Italian ""Dynamic"" label, which is devoted to Italian music, opera, recitals and to showcasing less well-known operas.  Their full-color booklet was included. (See [...]) I looked up Ms. Gutierrez and discovered, not to my surprise, that she is booked for about the next three years.  This fall, she will reprise her performance of Amina in ""La Sonnambula"" at Covent Garden. She seems to be on her way.",1316995200,3,1912,4.843558282208589
8435440,5,B004M3BIKM,"To hear Bellini's La Sonnambula performed by such wonderful voices as Eglise Gutierrez and Simone Alaimo is a real pleasure. The tenor Siragusa's voice was a little nasal for my taste, but he acquitted himself well. The sets in this production are a delight. The fact that this is the only commercial recording of Ms. Gutierrez that I know of makes it even more special. Hers is a spectacular voice, and her breath control is impeccable. Wish there were more recordings of hers available.",1313712000,3,488,4.821428571428571
8435441,4,B004M3BIKM,"For me, the rating in a review of an opera reflects how the totality of the performance impacts me. What this means is that this review reflects the performance as the sum of the parts, rather than the talent of the soprano. And let me say at the outset that Ms. Gutierrez is exactly what the other reviewers have noted: she is an extremely gifted young coloratura soprano, with an even, extended range, a wonderful sense of the legato line and a vocal agility that is amazing in one so young. Her finale, ""Ah! non giunge"", is breathtaking.

However, she does not yet have the stage presence of some of her older sisters. This comment may be mitigated by the fact that Sonnambula has a ... simple ... plot that does not demand much by way of acting.

But after Ms Gutierrez, the singers go from good to poor. Simone Alaimo is good as Count Rodolfo; he has been around long enough to have a well balanced baritone and very good stage presence (he is fantastic in the Alagna Georghiu Elisir).

And, as with much of Bellini, there is an important tenor part, which is this disc's biggest drawback. Antonio Siragusa (Elvino) sings well when he sings softly. He has a very nice mezza di voce, but when he hits the volume control, the voice goes right into the nose. It is visible in closeups and painful to experience. Compare his performance with that of JDF in the Met production on Decca. While the staging in this latter performance is appalling in the extreme, JDF (and Ms. Dessay) demonstrate what real Bel Canto is all about. The tessatura (range) for Bellini tenors is very high and requires a special voice and technique to execute. Siragusa has neither.

As for disc quality, the picture is crisp and well defined, but the sound seems compressed. I have a very good home theatre setup, and on most discs the efeect of the surround is impressive. But not with this disc.

So, if you want to experience a gifted young soprano at the outset of what one hopes is a long career, buy this disc, because, as noted by other reviewers, she is something to hear!

If, on the other hand, if you are looking for a balanced and well executed performance of this opera, be prepared to wait.",1306627200,7,2181,4.508860759493671
8435442,5,B004M3BIKM,"We have waited so long to have a recording of Eglise Gutierrez. Her voice is overwhelmingly rich. For once, I am speechless. This is a must have DVD.

 Beautiful ! ! !  I have never been this overwhelmed by an artist since Callas and Sutherland in their prime. We just finished watching the DVD. The art of Eglise is that she opens the heart of the listener and lets them experience the truth in the music/art.  Only a handful of artist can accomplish this. All the work, understanding, thoughfulness and yes love, reveal the truth. I wish I was a poet and could put into words the beauty revealed in this DVD. It is a must have for everyone.  thank you, Eglise for giving this performance for us.",1303862400,4,697,4.4140625
8435443,5,B004M3BIKM,"This is a lovely, traditionally-thought-out, very pretty and colorful performance. We are in the realm of the true belcanto: that which Bellini had in mind at the time that he wrote this masterpiece. The singing of Eglise Gutierrez is a throw-back to the grand days of the true belcanto singers of the past. Her piano-singing seems so easy! I recommend this DVD very highly; either to avid opera-lovers or to people new to opera; or to this opera.",1302048000,20,447,4.743589743589744
8435444,5,B004M3BIKM,"In fact, as the previous reviewer says, Amazon says very little about this DVD.  I noticed that the name of Cuban-American soprano Eglise Gutierrez was mentioned in the dry product description.

I was curious about this artist.  After doing some Internet search, I found out that the performance was taped in Teatro Lirico di Callegari in 2008, and that the cast, in addition to Ms. Gutierrez, includes Antonio Siragusa and Simone Alaimo.  Not much more information.

I first heard of Eglise Gutierrez when she sang Lucia di Lammermoor at Teatro Colon in Buenos Aires, in 2005,  but I did not attend any of her performances.  From her website I heard highlights of her performances.  She is just breath-taking; superb!; she will probably be THE bel canto soprano of her generation.

I would like to encourage readers of my comment to visit her website: [...].  After hearing her, I bet there will not be many people left who would still think I am exaggerating.  By the way, highlights of this ""Sonnambula"" performance are posted in her website.

Although I have not yet watched the complete DVD, this is not to be missed.  Ms. Gutierrez is consolidating her career in Europe,  but she is still little known in USA.  I look forward to seeing her live there (what are Maestro Levine and Mr. Gelb waiting for?).  In the meantime, we have no option but rush to buy this video at once!.  I am posting this comment while I order my copy of the DVD since it is SO UNFAIR that the first DVD of this wonderful artist would be missed because of lack of information and a low rating!

Eglise: The five stars are just for you; you are the sixth!",1300924800,13,1634,4.595155709342561
