7824607,1,6302362806,"This movie sucked because it did not play and I tried it on four dvd players,  I let the owner client know and they never responded to me, this was the worst thing I ever bought through Amazon. So thanks for nothing,  I feel like I was stuck up without a pistol w Ith this one.",1440633600,,277,3.9285714285714284

7824609,4,6302362806,"This video brings out some of the best of these explosive athletes. I enthusiastically watched this very well done video remembering these fights like yesterday. The highlights of each fight is straight to the point. And, the filming is crisp and clear. The only drawback is that you don't watch all of the fights, but very well done!",1363737600,,334,4.775862068965517
7824610,5,6302362806,"As I'am only 17 years of age, i was only a baby when these marvellous boxers were in their respective primes, but as i have grown i have learned of their charisma, their courage and their unbeleivable boxing ability. This film highlights four of the greatest fighters ever at their peaks, and against each other.
The Fabulous Four is a film that not only shows you the great fights but it gets inside each boxers corner and gives you a run down of what really went down in their minds on those special nights. Never again will you see fights with such action and such deep emotions roaring, that is what makes this film the one to have. The film includes highlights from all three Leonard/Duran fights, highlights from both Leonard/Hearns fights, the full Hagler/Hearns fight,the full Hearns/Duran fight and highlights from the Hagler/Duran fight. This is an amazing film which i think every boxing fan should have at home. It is truly "" A Boxing Masterpiece"".",1027296000,2,960,4.754491017964072
7824611,5,6302362806,"This is a piece of beauty.
Best middleweight fighters of last century.
The movie itself is very good composed, you'll
see 10 dramatic years of a fight for championship.
No talk about boxing, but action itself.
Original TV comments bring you right there.
I would give it 10.",1023926400,,273,4.708333333333333

I got Props for all. Marvin Hagler,Sugar Ray,Duran&My Fav of the Bunch HitMan Hearns.these Guys&there Battles with one another kept Boxing with a Edge.the 70's was the HeavyWeight Era&the Mid-80's till Now is the Middle Weight.these 4 Guys I Believe could hang in any Era.",1020211200,,470,5.28
7824613,5,6302362806,"Only for watching again the Hagler-Hearns ""alley fight"", it's worthwhile having this tape, but I enjoyed most of all",997142400,6,116,5.157894736842105
7824614,5,6302362806,"I received this video as a Christmas present and ended up watching it straight through three days in a row. It contains outstanding footage of some unbelievable fights. The theme of ""The Fabulous Four"" is used creatively and is not at all contrived. It's thought-provoking to watch four fighters with very different styles and personalities take each other on at different stages of their careers. If you don't know the histories of all the fights, you will be continually surprised. You will find yourself posing questions like the following: If A can beat B, and B can beat C, why does C beat A? The answer, of course, is that there is no single scale of greatness, and on any given day the right set of skills will triumph over the wrong set. It's all in the matchups -- a lesson for sport and a lesson for life. Terrific.",977961600,11,825,4.543624161073826
