They are his default choice anytime we let him pick one toy to bring on errands or to a restaurant. They don't have pieces that can get lost, and are not so huge you can't throw them in your purse.

5444349,4,B00AJXO3QK,"I brought this toy for my 3 y/o son and he LOVES them.  The toys are small and a perfect size and weight for small hands.  The plastic is not the sturdiest and the ladder broke off the fire truck within the first day. But hey, for this price what do you expect.  The toys do not look or feel cheap like some of the toys you'll find in a dollar store.  The major plus, it's a transformer where my 3 y/o can change back in forth w/o asking for help.  Unlike some of the transformer toys on the market.  Well buy again!",1515715200,,516,3.9611650485436893

5444351,4,B00AJXO3QK,"These were a gift for a 5 year old, he loves them. They are made from a sturdy plastic and so far seem to be made pretty tough for smaller children. Due to the simplicity of transforming I'd say these could even be suitable for a 2 or 3 year old. My only complaint is the price, $35 for  these 4-5 inch pieces of plastic that only take one move to transform is a bit steep.",1515456000,,373,3.9078947368421053

5444353,5,B00AJXO3QK,"I bought these for my 4 year old nephew for Christmas. He couldn't wait to open the rest of his gifts so he could play with his rescue bots. Everyone ended up down on the floor to play with him, even grandma. They are really a lot of fun! They aren't like the transformers from when I was growing up. You just push or pull one part and they go from vehicle to robot and back again. Perfect for a kid his age. The only down side is it didn't come with their boss, optimus prime.",1515196800,,477,3.9791666666666665

5444391,3,B00AJXO3QK,"My son loves these toys he hasn't stopped playing with them since he opened them on Christmas. They are very cool in the way they actually transform and don't stay in bot mode. The reason it is getting 3 stars instead of 5 is that only 5 days after they were opened they are now getting stuck in bot mode and not transforming back into cars (particularly Heat wave). They are a good size tho for toddler hands not too big not too small, If they had continued to work properly it would have been 5 stars!",1514764800,,503,4.195876288659794

5444396,5,B00AJXO3QK,"Sturdy and easy to transform (but still a cool transformation!). My 2 year old was able to pick up how to do it with only being shown a few times. Highly recommend. I like them much better than the Transformers one step transformers I got for my four year old, which have already had parts break off and have to be put back on and the transformations are much harder on those. This was one of the favorite Christmas presents!",1514246400,,425,4.325

5444398,1,B00AJXO3QK,"It was my 3yo top toy on his list for Santa. Looked perfect in box. He was extremely excited when he opened it and instantly began playing with them. Became vVERY frustraded fast as the chase toy does not transform right. As soon as you turn it into a robot it goes back to a car, won't stay transformed for more than 5sec no matter what we try to make it stay. The other 3 are great and easy to transform and play with.

Extremely dissapointed with chase as it was his favorite character and now only makes my son sad.

Now i will have to buy a separate chase to make up for it. As returning it requires sending them all back and its hard to explain why his christmas gift needs to be taken away.",1514160000,,697,4.08029197080292

He has been playing with them more or less nonstop for the past 2 days. He even had them sleep in his bed. Boulder and Blades are really easy to transform. Chase is a little trickier to get his feet to sit correctly (you really need to transform him in a smooth motion for his feet to sit flat so he stands up). Heat Wave was the trickiest to transform (tuck in his arms then rotate the whole upper body backwards -towards the ladder). With all that being said, my 3.5 year old son had it down by the end of the first day, so it's really not that difficult. They seem to be holding up well, there has been a lot of transformations in the past 48 hours. We did have to have a conversation about how they were plastic so we have to be a little gentle with them when transforming.

Turning him into a standing position requires pulling his legs out and snapping these grey plastic things in between, which is hard for a young child and took awhile for me to figure out. Otherwise, having played with Transformers when he was young, my husband says the rest are much easier to transform than other Transformers out there.",1479254400,9,583,4.615384615384615

My whole family loves this show!!!! The only reason for four stars instead of five is they keep putting repeat episodes on each disc, so if you own most of the rescue bot DVD's you only get a couple new episodes and at $10 a disc that's kind of pricey. I still don't understand how adult shows can be sold by the season at reasonable prices, yet most kids shows are sold with random and repeat episodes at very high prices. Honestly I would love to actually have the ALL the episodes available IN ORDER!- I know you can do this Shout Factory- you're selling the old school Transformers cartoon that way.",1436227200,5,762,4.435714285714286

The show is wholesome and my boys love seeing them in action and solving problems.  These are not the same Transformers as the adult movies, but rather kid-friendly ones.  There is also a real boy as the main character that is friends with all of them and guides them, I think my boys like to pretend they are him!

It contains five episodes for almost two hours of Transformers-watching fun.  Whats great about these Transformers is that they are geared towards kids and while they still transform they are not scary like regular Transformers movies.  I know my boys (5 and 6) love Transformers but they wouldn't like nor understand the adult movies featuring them.  These Transformers are great rescue heroes for young kids and I didn't feel anything was inappropriate.  For any kid that loves Transformers, Super Heroes or Heroes (police, fireman, pilots), this is a great DVD!

8552811,5,B00AJXO3QK,"Like many kids my almost 4yo is really obsessed, okay that should be OBSESSED with the rescue bots. He carries them around all the time. They are the perfect size and very easy for him to transform. His younger, almost 2yo brother also loves them and is able to transform them as well. The only thing that has broken is heatwave's ladder, which my son broke on purpose... They are nice and sturdy little toys and were a perfect Christmas present. I see my boys using their imaginations and making up stories with them, it's entertaining and helps their brains develop. Win win!",1524441600,,577,4.611650485436893
8552812,4,B00AJXO3QK,"Very kids friendly to transform, but do not hold up well to being transformed multiple times as intended. The Chase car would not transform after only 4 days of play. We returned the first set and the second has held up but the foot on that same vehicle is beginning to stick again.",1522800000,,282,4.339622641509434
8552813,4,B00AJXO3QK,"My son loves these and plays with them daily. So far they have held up to numerous bangs and actions that my 5 year old puts them through. Great set and size for small hands, very easy to transform and they stand very well in robot mode.",1522108800,,237,4.0638297872340425
