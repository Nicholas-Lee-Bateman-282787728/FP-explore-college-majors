711913,5,630383261X,"This is a great movie, worth watching over and over again. I dare say it  is director Jim Jarmusch's best to date (though ""Stranger than  Paradise"" runs a close second). It's sort of a romp, sort of a noir  screwball comedy, if you can fathom that. Fans of Tom Waits and John Lurie  will be charmed by their performances as two hapless bad guys who really  aren't so bad once you get to know 'em (like the characters in so many of  Waits' songs). Fans of Waits and Lurie will also enjoy the soundtrack,  which features instrumentals by Lurie and a few ""Rain Dogs"" songs  by Waits. Expect to be charmed by their co-star, as well, the Italian actor  whose name I can't remember (shame!)--Robert something. Ellen Barkin puts  in an excellent performance, playing (yet again) the frustrated girlfriend  of an over-the-top audiophile (see ""Diner""). Warning for the  squeamish: this film does involve a love story...a magical one without a  lot of thinking or talking...but it doesn't take over the movie. It just  makes the other two guys rethink their priorities.  END",907718400,2,1064,4.769230769230769

You keep trying to get into it because the really cute girl with all the tattoos who works at the used-clothes shop raved about it and you're desperate to find something in common with her. But no. This is just pathetic. Is that it? Is the message that movies stink? Is that the hopeless conclusion of the hopelessly ignorant hip? No! I refuse to believe that there is anyone mentally degraded enough to enjoy this waste of light. The producers are just social vandals who should be shunned. Don't watch this film!

712496,5,630383261X,"""Down by Law"", a 1986 low-budget film was a surprising and rare find. It is the third work directed by independent film director Jim Jarmusch, and it stars Tom Waits, John Lurie, and Roberto Benigni as a trio of convicts consigned to the same cell in a dismal New Orleans prison. The film is in a grainy black-and-white which captures the grimness of the surroundings and which makes the movie seem to come from an earlier era.

The film can be divided into three parts.  The first part shows the lives of Waits and Lurie on the streets of New Orleans.  One is a failed disk jockey while the other is a pimp. The second part of the movie shows the three protagonists in jail. Waits and Lurie don't get along. Benigni plays an Italian jailed for manslaughter who talks incessantly in a broken English and brings the three men together. They figure out an escape, but the movie dwells much more on the relationship between the three prisoners than on the mechanics of the escape.  The third part of the film shows the three men wandering in search of safety and freedom through the Louisiana swamps on the border with Texas following their escape.

This is a tough-minded film which explores New Orleans streets, a harsh prison, and the swamps.  The cinematography by Rubby Muller features realistic, slow shots of each setting and is in the black and white shadow of old film noir. The film also features a down-home Louisiana musical score by Waits and Lurie and with songs by New Orleans artists including Irma Thomas. The story has themes of trouble, friendship, and finding possible redemption.  The Louisiana setting is surprisingly realistic especially because Jamusch confessed to writing the script before ever setting foot in the state. As Luc Sante observed in his essay for the Criterion edition of the movie, ""'Down by Law' takes place in the land of the imagination, in the province of the movies."".

I was fortunate to see ""Down by Law"" on a full screen at the American Film Institute.  Thus, I cannot comment on the quality of the DVD reproduction.  It is a rare gem, particularly for those who love gritty movies and film noir.

When I received the DVD I gleefully opened the package and case. Unfortunately the DVD was so firmly stuck in the case I couldn't get it out no matter how hard/carefully I tried, until finally it snapped. I was left with a huge crack through one section of it while still stuck in the case with unrelenting grip...

So while I'm sure I would have loved the film and all the features, I will never know, and due to Amazon's policies I am unable to return the item because the box and case weren't damaged... turns out the case is a little too protective and won't even give it to the user to use.",1406332800,,711,4.189781021897811

so good, so much fun to watch, so well done, that I'm interested in and want to watch the extras, as well as own the movie.

Now, if you are looking for the biggest boobs, the most death, mind blowing special effects and various other contemporary
come ons, look not here.
But, the visuals, the acting, the dialogue, all the ingredients of film art, those are here.

It will draw you in, you will care about the characters-even as you wonder what exactly they are made of-and you will lament
and rejoice at their losses and successes.

What could be cliche', easily, in many movies, is not. Watch the police for an example of that, but there's more.
It cruises right past those things leaving them as they are, or as they would be to the people experiencing the situations
and characters that act upon our three.. shall we call them heroes? Yeah, I think so.

Man.. I hate to post this, because I'm not a critic, not an expert, and I'm being a lot more wordy than I like.. and I hope not to put
anyone off.
This is not an 'art' film, --god, am I gonna say per se????--it's just art. It's not something you have to discuss for an hour, or
something that only 'true lovers of' can understand or appreciate.

Beautiful, darkly comic, and oddly heartwarming Down By Law is an easy favorite for anyone looking to for an entry-point discover the Akron auteur's filmography.

Jarmusch went out of his way to make them rather common.  I like that we see a few minutes of backstory on two of them before they meet.  It's got a slow paced European flavor and makes crime and jail much less dramatic and explosive than American films usually do.

712686,4,630383261X,"Jim Jarmusch's DOWN BY LAW is one of the art-house productions that the American independent director made his name with in the 1980s.

At this point in his career, Jarmusch wanted to depict not the glitzy, glamorous America of Hollywood films, but rather the side no one ever talks about: vacant lots overgrown with weeds, the ramshackle homes of the working poor, and empty suburban streets. As the film opens, Jarmusch sets the stage by depicting New Orleans from this angle in a series of shots made from a moving car. Only then we see how a small-town pimp (John Lurie) and an itinerant DJ (Tom Waits) get themselves arrested after they've each accepted a job from a seedy friend. They subsequently end up sharing a jail cell, into which one day an Italian immigrant (Roberto Benigni) is also placed. The plot of the film is the developing camaraderie between these three men. The Italian's bumbling antics act initially aggrevate his cellmates -- Benigni's role serve as comic relief against the morose behavior of the other two characters. DOWN BY LAW begins as a drama portraying the underbelly of a Louisiana town, but by the end it has transformed into absurdist comedy.

Lurie's acting is fine, representing his character convincingly as a pathetic d-bag. Benigni might seem like he's playing himself, but his English is reputedly much better than the broken phrases he offers in the film. Nicoletta Braschi appears as the Italian's love interest, a role that must have been easy to play since Benigni and her are married in real life. I've never thought Tom Waits was a great actor, however.

In terms of cinematography, this is a major step forward for Jarmusch. Bringing on cameraman Robby Mller, most famous for his work with Wim Wenders in the 1970s, Jarmusch shot many scenes with blatant diagonals and claustrophobic framing that suggests the prison in which these characters do time. It's certainly the most geometrically striking film of Jarmusch's career. Criterion's Blu-Ray release is welcome, with its HD quality better delineating this careful composition.

This is an entertaining film, with many fine touches. If I give it less than a rave, it's just because I can't completely get into these black and white portrayals of contemporary lowlifes (I have a problem with early Kaurismki for the same reason--his aesthetic was very similar to Jarmusch's.) But I think this film has held up pretty well three decades after its release, and I'd recommend it for anyone looking to explore Jarmusch's work.",1257033600,,2525,4.990498812351544

Unlikely? Maybe. Dysfunctional? Definitely. Entertaining? Always.
The first half may seem a little slow paced to some; if one is a bit patient, the film is WELL worth it. The music is low-key jazz with Tom Waits singing, and the atmosphere pure poverty-stricken, stifling, Southern summer.",1217980800,,748,5.139344262295082

This movie seems like something thrown together as a lark by a few buddies after a few beers. I guess advocates of anti-hollywood artyness needed a new posterchild and Jarmusch was in the right place at the right time with the right haircut.,1196208000,8,357,4.343283582089552
712767,5,630383261X,"On Stranger than Paradise,  one could be forgiven if they felt Jim Jarmusch was being a little pretentious.  As minimalist no budget film making, there were lots of those so called artsty shots that cojure up a laundry list of foreign art house directors.  But Stranger than Paradise was not only a watershed moment for the American indie film, it also set the stage for Jarmusch as a great indie film director and it was the stepping stool for the great Down by Law, arguably his best work.

Like Stranger than Paradise, Down By Law follows of a trio of losers.  While the characters in Stranger than Paradise were living possibly on pipe dreams, Down by Law's trio are losers of the worst kind.  Tom Waits plays a down on his luck DJ set up delivering a car that, unbeknownst to him, carries a dead body while John Lurie plays a pimp, also set up to meet a possible new employee.  This basic setup allows both characters to meet up with Roberto Benigni in jail, escape, and get down and dirty in the swamps of Louisiana.

One of the most remarkable things about the film is the feeling evoked by the long takes, emphasizing minimalist film making and allow us to watch, feel, and observe these characters.  There is a degree of mistrust, annoyance, and friendship that exists between our three ""heroes"" as they wander through Louisiana.  As outsiders, we feel it all.  Jarmusch's long takes seem like they say nothing.  Some argue that nothing is going on.  The beauty of the scenes is the patience they reward the viewer.  Instead of quickly flashing to the next scene, we get the feeling of despair, hopelessness, and even apathy as the three character reside in prison.

On this film, Jarmusch found a brilliant collaborator in Robby Muller who serves as director of photography on this film.  Capturing the mood and feel of New Orleans from the opening montage through the dingy swamps, it's the fourth main character.  Jarmusch comments on the disc that he specifically chose not to shoot the more tourist areas.  We get a feeling of blue infected south, that is only emphasized by John Luries sporadic jazz/blues inspired score.

Like all of Jarmusch's works, there really isn't a ""plot"" per se.  Yes the main characters are wrongfully imprisoned and consequently escape, but this is not a fast paced action drams.  It's mostly a character study.  Watching the interactions between the three characters is precious.  Lurie and Waits have excellent exchanges and are great here, despite the fact they are not traditional actors.  As their foil, Roberto Benigni provides a somewhat madcap (though according to Jarmusch, somewhat restrained) performance, easily stealing the show and providing a hint of color to an ironically black and white film.

This edition is another excellent entry from Criterion.  While Jarmusch doesn't provide a commentary (he doesn't do em, so don't ask), he talks a good while on every aspect you'd like to know about the film in a set of audio only reflections.  There is also a very entertaining q&a from fans, phone calls to the stars of the film, and a video of Waits directed by Jarmusch and much more.",1192320000,3,3142,4.79182156133829

Of course, irrepressible Italian comedian Benigni steals virtually every scene he's in (which is pretty much the second half of the movie), but the three have a punchy rapport nevertheless.

His films, all of which he's written himself, are on the same level of genius as Truffaut, in his ability to tell a realistic story, and Fellini, to fill said realistic story with all kinds of eccentric and memorable characters.  Down By Law, his second full length film, is his undisputed masterpiece.

How I found out about this film was through being a fan of Tom Waits.  Looking at his filmography on IMDB I stumbled across this film, it sounded promising, it's rating high (not that all films with great reputations are good,) so I decided to give it a shot - I was not disappointed.

712890,5,630383261X,"I haven't seen all of Jarmusch's films, but I've seen plenty (Ghost Dog, Mystery Train, Stranger than Paradise, Dead Man) to know this is probably gonna go down as my favorite of them all.  Jarmusch and photographer Mueller do a brilliant job setting everything up.  Its style is as classic and effective as the film noirs of the 1950s, including the seedy characters, the dialogue, and the moody jazz courtesy of John Lurie, one of the film's stars.  Story wise, we're dealing with two lowlifes, a pimp and a recently fired DJ, who don't know each other, who are each set up and sent to prison for crimes they didn't commit.  They are thrown in a cell together, and eventually an Italian who accidentally killed a man after cheating at a game of cards (hit him with an 8-ball--CLASSIC!) and find a way to escape.  John Lurie is the pimp, Tom Waits is the DJ, and Robert Benigni makes his American film debut as Bob, the Italian.  (Ironically, he is the kindest, funniest, most jovial of the trio, yet he is the only one who actually is guilty of the crime he's in for).

I've read the other reviews, and I'm dissapointed in why some people don't like the film.  First off, I believe that Criterion has once again given us a top of the line DVD transfer.  The extras are great for folks that are into the ""hows"" and ""whys"" of a film, as I am, and the transfer itself is clear and beautiful to watch.

The acting may not be the best (Lurie was adequite), the dialogue and storyline are right out of the 50s, and help the mood of the entire thing.  The characters are introduced perfectly so that we don't really need to know why they're being set-up.  Our imagination can do the walking for us there.  We know they're both kind of shady guys, and there are any number of reasons why someone would wanna see them put away, or use them so that someone else doesn't get caught.

And as far as the reviewer wondering why we don't see the dogs, only hear them; don't see the escape, only the afterwards; and don't see the prison, only their cell, the answer is simple:  its an indie film made before indie's were all the rage.  Jarmusch could only afford so much, and I find that he did an incredible job giving us all the necessary information without having to show us everything that was going on.  The only thing I might raise an eyebrow to is Bob and Nicoletta (Benigni's real life wife) falling in love in under an hour or two.  But hey, sometimes, if its worth it, you gotta suspend reality.  The chemistry between the two characters is enough for me to believe they're in love, so who am I to argue!

All in all, this is one of my favorite movies to watch.  Criterion did a great job with this DVD, and at the very least, its a fun flick in the noir tradition, with a bit of a smart-ass underworld, beatnick edge to it.

""Down By Law"" also perfectly crystalizes the lower echelon life experience in New Orleans, which is pleasantly surprising given that it's so elusive, and, that none of the principals are natives. Although Tom Waits did spend a lot of time here - I saw him and Rickie Lee Jones perform together while they were living here in the 9th Ward, so maybe that counts for something in terms of him getting into character.

BTW, just as an aside, I understand that Italians LOVE this movie. Not just because of Benigni (like any big star in his home country, there are mixed feelings about him) but because the film is so wonderful.

712896,4,630383261X,"This unique and original film is a personal masterpiece, a real sleeper. I'd recommed it to anyone interested in non-formula American cinema in general, and fans of the macabre. It ranks up there with some of the better black and white movies of recent times, in the mold of Woody Allen's ""Manhattan"".
What made this film great for me, was that the director masterly chose to leave out extraneous footage and instead keep our focus on character development - much the way Jean Luc Goddard does. Indeed Goddard's stamp is felt everywhere in this picture, which is why I liked it so much. This is America's answer to neorealism and done very well. The fact that we don't really see exactly how the main characters escape from prison, nor do we see how Zack rescues Bob from his fear of swimming add (rather than detract from) the plot, and give us more time with the personal nature of the characters, their ""everyday chit-chat"", etc, is what gives this film its charm. I won't give away the ending, but even that is told in an unorthodox manner, which is a breath of fresh air from formula Holywood films.
The acting is surprisingly naturalistic and believable, and Tom Waits gives an especially brilliant performance here. Roberto Bernini is hilarious as the sort of comic sidekick to the two streetwise contenders of the trio - this is a truly original chemistry of character mixes, and the film could have taken the more traditional path of ""straight-guy/goofy-guy"" as in Laurel & Hardy or Abbot & Costello, but instead wisely opts to break new ground by having two ""straight"" characters that battle it out for leadership.
The ""We All Scream for Ice Cream"" segment is one of the funniest bits I've seen in a film in years and should be one of those rare legendary film icons by this point.
The DVD transfer is wonderful - a crisp, clean print that looks great onscreen. Criterion have done yet another great job here.

A truly seemless masterpiece.",939254400,4,351,4.507936507936508

7853496,5,630383261X,"Cool movie. It's very low budget and not super exciting, but the dialogues are great and the geniuses Waits, Lurie, and Benigni are all on point. I really love the subtle humor in lines like, ""Bob Frost, in Italian?""
