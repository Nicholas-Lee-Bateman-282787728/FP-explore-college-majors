8285299,3,B001BYZX10,"The video actually felt really short. It's not too engaging is my guess on why some people cannot watch it in one sitting. I would have like it if they went a little more in-depth with the cars with some key people responsible for them. Even the feature cars were merely just touched upon. With that said, the video quality was excellent and the narrattion by Mike Shepherd was easy to listen to.",1276214400,3,396,4.438356164383562
