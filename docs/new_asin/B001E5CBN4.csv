3545955,5,B001E5CBN4,"Stumbled across this series on Netflix.  Best show of the 21st century!  Absolutely hilarious!

Still Game has introduced me into the world of Scottish humor.  I couldn't love it more!  They don't hold back like American sitcoms do.  Lots of ""insult humor,"" the kind guys throw at each other (friendly but unmerciful).  These old pensioners don't avoid sensitive topics regarding old age--everything from urinary problems to freezing to death is fair game for these guys.  That's not to say these characters are unlikable, they're downright lovable.

Jack and Victor = two life-long pals sharing retirement and a lot of ""pints"" at the pub!
Winston = Tough-minded, streetwise friend; loves gambling and a good prank.
Isa = Good-hearted gossip; knows your business better than you do!
Tam = Scheming tightwad; unashamedly selfish.  Has he ever paid for his own pint?
Navid = Indian shopkeeper; provides wisdom and advice, when he's not taking guff from his wife.
Bobby = Loser bartender; victim of much abuse!

I was drawn in by the raucous humor of the guys, but I'm hooked on learning the language.  I love figuring out all the sayings.  If I don't get it by context, I Google the phrase.  There are plenty of sites that will help with understanding it all.  Example:  look up ""boaby"" and you'll get the first bar joke of the first episode!

Warning 1:  It takes time to figure out what they're saying.  Scots roll their ""r""s hard, so it takes getting used to.  Plus, they have lots of slang we don't use.  You might need to Google some of the phrases to catch all the meaning.

Warning 2:  This comedy relies heavily on ""swear words.""  Don't watch it with the kiddies in the room!

I have honestly watched every episode of every season at least 4 times (some I've watched twice as much).  I catch new words every time.

I only give this series 5 stars because I can't give it 10!  Get it bought!  Get it watched!",1460332800,6,1913,4.66066066066066
3545956,5,B001E5CBN4,"It's great series like this one that made me purchase a region free DVD player. US television is sorely lacking foreign comedies and although Netflix streams Still Game, currently, it's missing the last season and 3 of the holiday specials, so having this on DVD is well worth the price. Crack open the Midori, sweet sherry and a pint of lager and enjoy the laughs with Jack, Victor, Isa, Winston, Tam, Navid and Boabby, ya daftys!",1456185600,9,431,4.684210526315789

3545958,4,B001E5CBN4,"Quite good Scottish sitcom. Saw first on streaming video but only a couple seasons were available. The only problem with this is that the DVDs are in a foreign playback format. Easily resolved on my laptop, though. Great collection. Highly recommended.",1452038400,,252,5.170731707317073

8296507,5,B001E5CBN4,"I had never heard of this show, I bought it on recommendation from my sister.  I really enjoyed this comedy and will watch it a second time.  I had trouble understanding so of the dialog because of the thick accent.  I used the closed captioning and it was fine.  Really liked the show.",1503964800,,286,4.339622641509434

8296510,5,B001E5CBN4,I highly recommend this as a super funny series. It probably won't mean much to anyone who isn't Scottish though.,1485561600,,113,4.7
8296511,5,B001E5CBN4,"The box and packaging for this set of DVDs look good, but I have to say that I have never, in my life, come across discs that are so difficult to get out of their casing! Its absolute murder.

Well worth the effort though! This is one of the best comedies ever devised for lovers of zany humour. Extremely funny, with a brilliant supporting cast. The broad Glaswegian accents might be difficult to understand sometimes, but you get acclimatised after a while.

This is a Region 2 DVD so US viewers will need an all-region DVD player.",1480982400,,533,4.484536082474227
8296512,5,B001E5CBN4,Arrived quickly! Thank you! Very happy!,1480896000,,39,5.666666666666667
8296513,5,B001E5CBN4,"While owning these is inconvenient unless you have a Region 2 DVD player (I don't, so I have to use my computer,) Still Game is not only one of the most entertaining shows I've seen recently, but one of the funniest shows I've ever seen. While the characters do speak English, I had to watch the first three episodes with subtitles on before my ear for the thick Scottish accents developed. Once everything was understandable, I became engrossed in how much more these characters are fleshed out than in a typical sitcom. While there is much more profanity than in American broadcast and cable television, it is good-natured and probably appropriate for older teens and above.",1478908800,4,676,4.836206896551724
8296514,5,B001E5CBN4,"We get this on Netflix streaming and it has to be one of the funniest shows ever. It beats the hell out of the so-called American 'comedy' which to us is not funny at all (Modern Family, 30 Rock, etc.). Those shows absolutely suck compared to these classics. We do have to watch with sub-titles because there's no way in hell we would understand the dialogue otherwise. We also just discovered 'Chewin' The Fat' with most of the same characters. Bloody brilliant.  :^)",1476489600,,468,4.63855421686747
