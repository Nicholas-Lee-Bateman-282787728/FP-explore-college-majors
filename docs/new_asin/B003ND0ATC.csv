4156895,5,B003ND0ATC,"My grandson is 2 1/2 years old and loves this video with remote.  He feels like he is part of the action which keeps him interested in the dvd.  In the process of keeping him interested, he is learning without realizing it!  Awesome!",1294444800,3,233,4.372093023255814
4156896,1,B003ND0ATC,"The remote is cheaply made. It only works on compatible DVD players and select episodes.  I had ordered the Handy Manny one as well, I am returning it.  Don't waste your money!",1293926400,2,176,4.46875
4156897,1,B003ND0ATC,"""Santa"" brought this gift to our 2 year old son. He was so excited to get it. The Mickey Mote set-up is simple enough...IF YOU HAVE A COMPATIBLE DVD REMOTE!!! We have a Sony 5-Disc changer and the Mote would not program to our DVD remote. It wouldn't program to our Blu-Ray (also Sony) remote either. Practically, we paid $30 for a DVD. We tried to find a link to techincal support, but there is no such listing. I'm sure it is a great product if you can use it. Just be advised that it might not work with some remote controls.",1293235200,13,528,4.186274509803922
4156898,3,B003ND0ATC,"Kids love to have ""pretend"" version of equipment, appliances and other ""grownup"" stuff, so why wouldn't they want to have their own TV remote? The new ""Mickey Mote"" doesn't change channels or control volume, but it does allow young children to answer multiple choice questions on specially-equipped Playhouse Disney DVDs.

This feature was formerly known on earlier releases as ""Discovery Mode."" You could choose a setting on the DVD so your home remote could allow your child to answer the questions, which randomly stop the story action throughout select episodes and feature length specials (more about just how ""select"" in a moment).

So you can already do pretty much the same thing with a regular remote that you can do with a Mickey Mote, but where's the colorful fun in that? And do you really want to have a small child fiddle with a complicated remote and maybe get strawberry jam all over it? That's the idea, and it's not a bad one if you want to add just a little more interaction to shows that already stop their action frequently to ask the viewers what to do, or to count things, etc. in the manner of Blues's Clues and Dora the Explorer. (I personally prefer the more plot-driven features because they are richer in content than the shorter episodes.

Parents shouldn't just load the batteries, start the DVDs, hand the child a Mickey Mote and let it go at that. First it has to be set in a specific way with a specific sequence of steps. It's not complicated, but if you skip a step it won't work. It comes with printed instructions and on-screen directions. Once you've set the Mickey Mote, it's ready to use.

Then you must choose from two play levels on the settings of the DVD and the episode starts. Here's where we had some issues. On Mickey Mouse Clubhouse Numbers Roundup, which is packaged with the Mickey Mote, there are short episodes that seem chosen at random after you select the activity mode. In other words, you might see ""Mickey's Big Surprise"" one time, set it again and then see ""Mickey's Round Up the Next."" We tried it over and over again and it seems to allow no control over which episodes it shows after you choose the activity mode -- and for the life of me, I can't figure out how to use it for the bonus episode at all.

So your child can of course watch all five episodes but I couldn't tell you how to see all four plus the bonus one on Mickey Mouse Clubhouse Numbers Roundup with the Mote.

It's much better with feature-length episodes like that of another new Playhouse Disney DVD release, Handy Manny Big Construction Job. You set the DVD for the mote, and the whole 67 minute story follows with lots of Mickey Mote interactivity. We also tried it with an earlier release, Mickey Mouse Clubhouse Mickey in Wonderland, and the same holds true.

We had a three year old over for the holiday and she loved using the remote, and since her attention span is less than those of me and my older kids, she was perfectly delighted with Numbers Roundup. We did not get the opportunity to see if she would become frustrated if she couldn't ""Mote"" on all the episodes, but perhaps it's a bigger deal to us than to the little ones.

Me -- I still love putting the Magic Screen on the TV, getting out the Magic Crayons and helping Winky Dink in one of his adventures. Now THAT'S interactivity!",1290816000,14,3331,4.54
4156899,4,B003ND0ATC,"I'd give the DVD 5 stars but, I had to deduct a star for the remote.  My 2 year old son is facinated with numbers and counting.  All 4 episodes are geared towards counting and number recognition so the DVD is perfect for him.  HOWEVER - unless you have an older child or have your DVD player positioned directly below your TV - it's very difficult to show your child that they need to point the remote at the DVD player - not the TV.  I'm going to program the remote to work with our portable dvd player.  Usually when he is watching the portable DVD player he is in a car or plane seat directly in front of the player which would work better.",1289865600,42,643,4.112

Numbers roundup is a simple story in which goofy let all of the numbers 1-10 escape and they now must search for them.
The other episodes on this disc are cute as well and include Daisy bo-peep, mickey's big surprise and super goof's super puzzle and mickey's show and tell. Each of these has been aired on television, but since we do not get the Disney channel it doesn't matter to us!

Discovery mode is also featured on this however we have not tried to use it as of yet. It is compatible with either a mickey mote or regular dvd remote.",1404518400,,733,4.503759398496241

4157074,3,B003ND0ATC,"If your child loves Mickey Mouse Clubhouse, then they will enjoy this video. The video is wonderful.

However, the Mickey Mote (MM) is something to be desired. Our main dvd player has a non-infrared remote possibly blue-tooth (Sony blu-ray player). These remotes DO NOT work with the MM. After many attempts and searches for troubleshooting I came up with nothing. Until finally finding a personal review that discussed the infrared remotes. After reading this I took the remote into the masterbedroom where our old dvd player is with what I assumed was an infrared remote. It programmed instantly. Unfortunately, this isn't a place where my son watches tv, so the MM would still be useless. I had one more option...the built-in dvd player in the car (2006 Volvo XC90). With a little bit of testing out distance and angle, the MM programmed just fine. So, hopefully while my son watches MMCH in the car he will be able to use the MM. SO BEWARE if your remote is NOT INFRARED this will NOT work!!!",1397952000,3,996,4.724137931034483

4157129,5,B003ND0ATC,"I currently have 2 Mickey Mouse Clubhouse DVDs. The first one I let my son pick when we were at another store. It only had a mere 2 episodes (one episode was longer than the average episode). However after watching just the 2 episodes on repeat for days I broke this one out. It was supposed to be a Christmas present, however it didn't make it. Since we've gotten it out my son has watched it probably 30+ times. He's also taken it out of the case and rolled it across the floor. It still works great. There are 5 episodes staring all the main characters and some of the minor characters (the Professor, Pete, Clara Bell, Space Mickey). Daisy Bo Peep episode and Space Mickey's Shape episode has really helped my son (2.5 yrs old) with shape recognition. Given the amount of episodes on this particular DVD compared to some of the others, I highly recommend it.",1353974400,,862,4.462025316455696

4157137,1,B003ND0ATC,"If I could give this remote zero I would. It's not compatible with Xbox, Windows Media remote, or PS3. I bought a Sony blu-ray player thinking, well this will work. NO! Only the left arrow registers properly with this red piece of poo. Make sure to try and program it before you give it to your child. Big sadness will ensue if you try and do it with them in the room and it doesn't work with your specific remote.",1327104000,,414,4.1875
4157138,3,B003ND0ATC,"I got this for my 2 year old son for Christmas.  Was really excited about the interactive ""mickey mote"" that comes with it but we were not able to get it to sync with our dvd remote.  The dvd is great but the ""mickey mote"" is far under expectations.  Maybe this is just a problem with our dvd player, but for the buyer that is mainly purchasing for the mickey mote, it may not work as expected!",1325289600,2,394,4.090909090909091
4157139,1,B003ND0ATC,we don't use a DVD player. we have both an Xbox and a ps3. the controllers from either system were unable to program the mickey mote which sucks bc my toddler was really stoked on it. i got it for his birthday and now i feel awful that he cant use it.,1318550400,2,251,3.8461538461538463

4157141,2,B003ND0ATC,"This was a gift to our 4 year old for her birthday.  She absolutely loves Mickey Mouse Clubhouse and to think she would be able to participate in the show, was just icing on the cake.  That is until we couldn't get the Mickey Mote to work.  No matter how many times we programmed it, reset it, removed/replaced the batteries, it just would not work.  Now we are forced to use the regular remote while she pretends the Mickey Mote works.  Sad.  For the record we have a Sony Blu-Ray player.",1308096000,,489,4.318681318681318

Therefore, I would say please don't bias your purchase of this DVD based on some of the low reviews listed.  Note that you can access all the bonus activities on the DVD without using the Mickey Mote... your regular remote control will work just fine.  This is a GREAT DVD for kids... let's not review just the Mickey Mote PLEASE!  Both of my daughters love this DVD, and we don't use the Mickey Mote at all... which is an optional accessory purchase anyway, and not required to enjoy the DVD features.  (I find that our regular remote control works just as well, if not better.)

In summary, if your kids love the Mickey Mouse Clubhouse episodes, this is a WONDERFUL DVD with lots of bonus features that don't necessarily need the Mickey Mote in order to enjoy.  I highly recommend this DVD!  :-)",1301875200,53,1191,5.4
4157144,2,B003ND0ATC,"Great idea, thought the grandkids would love the interactive mode of the new AMickey Mote DVD's.

4157145,5,B003ND0ATC,This was purchased for a 2 year old who knows his numbers. Child must know 0-9 and A B C.  He loves the little remote and wants to play this all the time.  It teachs adding and more. It also travels well.  You only need program the Mickeymote with the dvd player remote to use it anywhere.  A wonderful learning tool and holds even a 2 yr. olds attention.,1295308800,4,355,4.101449275362318
4157146,5,B003ND0ATC,"I just bought this for my son with some hesitation after what some of the other reviews stated.  I was able to program the Mickey Mote with ease for my Blu-ray dvd player.  If you have a Blu-ray DVD player...you must use your Blu-ray dvd remote control to program the Mickey Mote.  I was having some trouble when using a universal remote contol.  I assume this is the way with regular DVD players too.  Also, you do need to have your child near the DVD player in order to use the Mickey Mote.  He is just thrilled with this item since he has not been introduced to the world of video games..DS...Wii..etc.  He is 3.5 years old. I like that it is more educational and thinking then other type games.",1294876800,2,698,4.323076923076923
