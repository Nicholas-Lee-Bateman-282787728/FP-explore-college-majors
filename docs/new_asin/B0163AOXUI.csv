7456044,1,B0163AOXUI,"He writes better than he performs. We were expecting brilliance, but it was slow and at times insipid.  If you are looking for something spectacular by someone associated with ""Sordid Lives"", check out Leslie Jordan's ""My Life on the Pink Carpet.""",1376611200,4,247,5.024390243902439

7456047,4,B0163AOXUI,"Del Shores, the amusing mind behind ""Sordid Lives"" and a staff writer on ""Queer As Folk"", films a stand-up performance in Dallas, during which he presents his extremely politically-incorrect take on current events, pop culture, gay activism, sexual fettishes, and the uniqueness of Southern charm.  From Snooki to Bristol Palin, from Waffle House waitresses to a ""little person"" male stripper, and from trailer trash sluts to feedback on his Facebook page, Shores is not shy about sharing his thoughts with a very receptive hometown audience, where he is clearly in his element.

His stories are creative, and his delivery is good, but this is best enjoyed by current fans of this Southern humorist. I'm not a prude, but I have a problem with ""F*** You"" as a common punchline in his stories, and, if you feel the same, this may not be for you.  With those caveats in mind, I'll give it four stars out of five, for those open to his humor.  Your mileage may vary.",1349827200,4,962,4.74251497005988

8735493,2,B0163AOXUI,"although I absolutely love Del Shores and have seen many of his plays, the movies based on them & his other ""stand up"" specials...I could hardly handle him in this...he's just so angry in it. I realize that this was filmed in the midst of the break up of his marriage, so it wasn't the best time in his life, but he was just very dark in it and not like the usual Del that I've come to know from the above mentioned, or from meeting him on a few occasions here in Dallas. I'll obviously continue supporting him as I always have, I just won't be watching this particular show again.",1488758400,3,581,4.196428571428571
