3467615,5,B001AV3BYA,"I loved the original British version of ""The Office"", so I decided to check out the American version.  I got hooked.  This collection contains Seasons 1-4 with lots of extras.  I love the episodes that come with commentary.  Buying the collection was cheaper than buying each season individually.  It's a real winner.  Now I can watch my favorite episodes whenever I want.",1222992000,,372,4.919354838709677
3467616,5,B001AV3BYA,"This is an excellent way to watch this series-back to back to back, one after another!  Great extras-the blooper reels are hilarious and lengthy.  Plenty to enjoy.  Watch the deleted scenes right after each episode-some of the BEST scenes have been deleted!  Well worth the money!",1222732800,,280,5.021739130434782
3467617,5,B001AV3BYA,"This has been the best investment for some good laughs. I love this show.  My husband and I couldn't wait to come home and watch another episode.  Love it, Love it!!!!",1222560000,3,167,4.354838709677419
3467618,5,B001AV3BYA,"the cases didn't look any different than if bought separately, but the content is the same..... HILARIOUS.",1222214400,,106,5.294117647058823
3467619,5,B001AV3BYA,"The guy above me nailed it on the head. The series has not lost its freshness; it keeps changing enough to stay interesting and is often a full-blown riot. It takes those awkward, embarrassing moments you have no doubt experienced in your own job and allows you to laugh at them (because it's not very funny when the people in your own office are incompetent and dumb). It is, as I refer to it, ""believably over-the-top,"" meaning that although the characters often find themselves in bizarre situations, they never break character and react in realistic ways. If you haven't seen this show, what are you waiting for?

Steve Carell's character will go down as one of TV's all-time greats. He embodies this show perfectly: he is offensive, inappropriate, and completely self-centered, but he has a good heart and he really tries to make people happy.",1219276800,8,848,4.848275862068966
3467620,5,B001AV3BYA,Let me be the first to say - this will be the best use of your $105 that you will ever spend.,1216944000,9,93,3.272727272727273
3467672,5,B001AV3BYA,"I was introduced to The Office a few months ago through some friends.  This show is brilliant, unique, fresh, and entertaining.  All of the characters are funny in their own way, and once you get over the initial annoyance of Michael Scott you learn to love him too!  The extras that are on seasons two and three are great.  This is a great show that you can watch over and over again.  I would recommend this show to anyone looking for a comedy that will keep you laughing and smiling time after time.",1245196800,,502,4.354838709677419
3467673,5,B001AV3BYA,"Arrived right on time, gave this as a present for my sister for Christmas. She loved it.",1244505600,,88,4.235294117647059
3467674,1,B001AV3BYA,"You don't want to buy from this seller. The boxed set is shipped directly from China and the quality is pathetic. There are episodes missing, some episodes will not even play, some are on a disk more than once under different titles. The list goes on and on. They skip. They came in pink plastic sleeves and nothing is properly labeled so you don't know what season or disk you are on. It was very disappointing. Pay a little extra and buy from a better seller.",1242345600,6,461,4.372093023255814
3467675,1,B001AV3BYA,Product was lost in the mail and seller did not have any backup product in stock.  Never received shipment but received prompt refund.,1241481600,,134,4.826086956521739
3467676,5,B001AV3BYA,"I don't watch much television, but my wife knew about this series and introduced it to me with this set for my birthday. It is a spot-on parody. Actors deliver their lines so well you'll swear it is all ad libbed! The humor is too risque to watch with our daughters, but for the two of us it is hilarious! Plus, the whole show is so subtle that you can watch a disc many times and still be fully entertained. Season 1 is a little out of character compared to the rest of the seasons here, but it's still worthy. A+",1237161600,,514,4.099009900990099
3467677,5,B001AV3BYA,"This was a gift for my daughter and husband, and they love it of course - can't get enough Office!",1236470400,,98,3.95
3467678,1,B001AV3BYA,I have never received this item.  Sent an email to the product's address 2 weeks ago and have never received a response.,1235347200,,120,4.454545454545454
3467679,5,B001AV3BYA,"The Office is, plainly, the funniest comedy on television today. When put up against the all-time greats, it holds its ground vs. even a heavy-hitter like Seinfeld. This set is a great deal, you know you want it, and don't try to make the argument that you will wait for the 'Seasons 1-5' collection next year. Don't put off hilarity until tomorrow.

Buy this now! Great set, great packaging, great series.",1234742400,,406,4.71830985915493
3467680,4,B001AV3BYA,"My brother-in-law loaned us the first & second season, we loved it and had to have our own.  I like the documentary style, it almost makes me want to work in a office!",1234483200,,167,4.0606060606060606
3467681,5,B001AV3BYA,I watched my daughter's set and just had to have one of my own. I am hooked on this show. I have watched my DVDs over and over and am enjoying everything about them. This set is nice- including the deleted scenes and the bonus sections. Great to own and to share!! Amazon delivered my set in perfect condition and in great time. I didn't have to wait long at all.,1233532800,,363,4.126760563380282
3467702,5,B001AV3BYA,"It so good it will keep you up at night because you just can't get enough.
That's what she said.",1231632000,2,96,3.85
3467703,5,B001AV3BYA,If you have a warped sense of humor like me you'll love it.  One of the funniest shows I've ever seen.  Brilliant!!!,1231632000,,116,4.2272727272727275
3467704,5,B001AV3BYA,"Not only is it a better deal buying these as a set, but you also get them in a case.  I am disappointed that Amazon no longer has a price guarantee, but I got a large discount before it ended.  Hopefully they will start it back up, since that is one of the main reasons I love Amazon.",1231027200,,284,3.8793103448275863
3467705,5,B001AV3BYA,I bought this set for my boyfriend and we cannot stop watching it.  It is excellent.  I highly recommend becoming obsessed with the office.,1227657600,,139,4.75
3467706,5,B001AV3BYA,"I bought this for my adult son who is 32. This is his fav sit com, but due to work and travel he couldn't always keep up. He called just now from N.C. to tell me how much he loved having the set and how he is enjoying watching the episodes. Very happy",1227398400,,251,3.7547169811320753
3467707,5,B001AV3BYA,"if you are a office lover and you don't already own all the seasons,this is the ultimate package for you!",1225584000,,105,4.3
3467708,5,B001AV3BYA,"Personally, I think these are the funniest seasons...even funnier than Season 5 (the current season).",1225584000,,101,5.8
3467709,5,B001AV3BYA,"Its a great deal, considering that each season bought seperately will cost you nearly forty dollars each! This was a great way to save money and still be able to enjoy the laughs of the office.",1224028800,,193,4.388888888888889
3467710,5,B001AV3BYA,The Office Seasons 1-4 was fabulous.  I've watched them all and enjoyed them immensely.,1223683200,,87,5.214285714285714
3467711,5,B001AV3BYA,I purchased seasons 1-4 of The Office for my son's birthday (15) and didn't expect to become addicted. I loved the UK Office and am a big Gervais/Merchant fan and was skeptical.  But this production was a great buy and produces hours and hours of laughs and together time for us. I have come to love Michael Scott and his crew and cannot wait for Season 5! You should add this to your collection.,1223337600,,396,4.351351351351352

8279840,5,B001AV3BYA,"watched this over and over, completely worth it, just wish they didn't release a box set till all seasons were done.",1461974400,,116,4.571428571428571

8279842,5,B001AV3BYA,I miss this show,1420329600,,16,3.25
8279843,5,B001AV3BYA,All four seasons are fantastic & I love that they are all grouped together. It's definitely worth the money to get for any The Office fan.,1390521600,2,138,4.346153846153846
8279844,1,B001AV3BYA,"Bought seasons 1-4 from him and got seasons 1, 2,3,5. No response from seller. I already had season 5 so that was quite annoying",1373068800,,128,4.375
8279845,5,B001AV3BYA,"I got this product when I was a sophomore in college and had crippling insomnia and needed something to entertain me at 3 in the morning when TV sucked and I couldn't read because I was too tired.  I would always laugh along until class in the morning!  I think the first four seasons are this show's best, so it's great to have them all packaged together.  One thing that I would improve would be that in some of the seasons there are only a few episodes on each disc, so if you're doing a marathon you'll have to change discs pretty frequently.  But if you like the early Office then this really IS the Ultimate Package (that's what she said).",1362787200,,645,4.305785123966942
8279846,5,B001AV3BYA,"Bought this for my brother for Christmas, and he loved it! It's a great gift for anyone who loves The Office",1355788800,,108,4.190476190476191
8279847,5,B001AV3BYA,"This show is simply addictive! After seeing it in syndication on TBS and other channels, I couldn't help but to buy it. So I started watching it, and watching it, and watching. At that poin I realized The Office is like an addiction. It's funny, unique, and everything in between. The show focuses on an office, obviously. But this office is like no other. With regional manager Micheal Scott(Steve Carrell) in charge, there's no telling what will happen! Making off-beat remarks, offensive comments, and the infamous ""that's what she said"" jokes, Micheal Scott is only half of The Office's humor. The co-workers are what make things even funnier. With everything mixed together The Office is simply wonderful and hilarious!",1259798400,,724,5.092436974789916
