5178760,5,B008R4LNPM,This is my favorite reality show and this season was no exception.  It is fun watching it in a shorter period of time rather than over a few months. I recommend this to anyone who likes the show.,1355443200,,195,4.131578947368421
5178761,5,B008R4LNPM,"Now I am waiting for Season 10, 11, 12......... it seems like a long time between releases.  Thanks for working on this series releases.",1352851200,,136,4.666666666666667
5178762,5,B008R4LNPM,"It was great rewatching one of the best seasons of TAR. From Lake and Michelle's bickering to Yolanda confronting Ray over him cursing and shooting birds at her. Great season. What I didn't like about the DVD was that they cut out the previous episode's recap and the next episode's teaser. The DVD just goes straight to the TAR logo and the cast. Other than that, great season, great DVD.

Best line in the entire DVD was:

BJ: All right guys, we'll see you soon. T-Tow!
Monica: T-tow my ass.",1351641600,,493,4.466666666666667
5178763,5,B008R4LNPM,"I honestly can't wait. Season 9 has been sitting in my cart since this summer. Why can't Amazon release it soon?

I especially liked the surprising twist at the end when a team was overtaken late in the game. Not as good as Season 4 and 5 but quite memorable and fast paced compared to the recent anemic, slow paced seasons filled with mickey mouse tasks and boring teams.",1349308800,2,372,4.391304347826087
5178764,5,B008R4LNPM,"As usual, the Amazing Race, Season 9 delivers in entertainment and enjoyment.  This is the season with ""the hippies"" whose comments and antics were fun to watch.  Would recommend this DVD.",1365292800,,188,5.032258064516129
5178765,5,B008R4LNPM,I ENJOYED WATCHING THE SHOW. IT HAS SUSPENSE OF WHO WILL  BE OUT AT THE PIT STOP. NO COMMERCIALS IS A DEFINITE PLUS. GOOD QUALITY DISCS. I ENJOYED ALL THE SEASONS THAT I HAVE ( 1-9 ).,1360627200,,183,3.945945945945946
5178766,5,B008R4LNPM,"My husband and I are real fans of this reality series.  I will buy all seasons as they become available, so get with it CBS.",1359244800,,124,3.96
5178767,5,B008R4LNPM,I am a big fan of Amazing Race. It's a great way to see the cultures of other countries. The product arrived quickly and in new condition. I enjoyed watching it at my leisure.,1358121600,,175,4.176470588235294
5178768,4,B008R4LNPM,"I bought this for my mom who lives out in the middle of nowhere and doesn't have cable or satellite.  She watches an episode as a ""treat"" in the evenings and she really is enjoying.  I only gave it 4 stars because I haven't personally watched the entire series.",1358035200,,261,4.3061224489795915
5178769,5,B008R4LNPM,Love it!!  Will buy all remaining seasons as soon as they are released or even as a pre order...I will wait!!,1357516800,,109,4.190476190476191
5178770,4,B008R4LNPM,"This was one of my favorite seasons on TAR, but I was very disappointed that this DVD set contained NOTHING other than the episodes, with no extras of any kind. Since I have several other seasons from different sellers that do include hours of extras (including Season ONE), this makes me suspect that CBS did not release this particular set; instead, I think someone just burned the episodes to the discs. The quality of each episode was ok, but for the money, it should have included the extras (commentaries, mat chats, side trips, etc.) that all of my other seasons contained.",1357344000,2,580,4.752475247524752
5178771,1,B008R4LNPM,Had problems with Season 6 as the the picture wasn't sharp and sound was missing at times.  For the most part we saw the season.  Now when I tried to watch Season 9 the first episode had no sound and I just sent the DVDs back.  Also please note that the picture was not crisp once again.  How does CBS continually allow poor quality DVDs in the market place?,1357257600,,358,4.144927536231884
5178772,4,B008R4LNPM,I enjoyed all seasons up to the 9th season of the amazing race just wish seasons 10 on were available.,1356912000,,102,4.15
5178773,5,B008R4LNPM,"This show just gets better and better...every season is so great, the contestants are always fun and different...Phil just continues to be such a great host - keep them coming - want to see Season's 10 and up!!!",1356825600,2,211,4.578947368421052
8529839,5,B008R4LNPM,"I expected a better quality on an original DVD but every now and then you can see the pixels on the  video... I would have liked to see Elimination Station after each leg as a bonus feature (like other seasons have).. All in all, it's my fav reality show and i'm glad that i bought it. :-)",1512950400,,289,4.0701754385964914
8529840,4,B008R4LNPM,"It's diffently a great series, but there's one thing that bothered me. I first purchased seasons 8 and 9 on dvd when they were first released. But the recaps and previews are not included in either of the dvds I purchased. I don't know if there are any updated versions of these dvds that includes all of the recaps and previews, so if anybody could let me know, that would be great.",1470700800,,383,4.333333333333333

8529844,5,B008R4LNPM,"I did enjoy the season. the only thing is that for some reason it would skip on my dvd player, but play smoothly on my PS3. im guessing a PS3 has more lasers in it or something, i really don't know lol. i would say buy it if you love the show.",1423094400,,243,3.6923076923076925

8529847,4,B008R4LNPM,"I have ordered several of these DVDs and they have been fantastic.  I haven't watched this particular one yet, so I am rating it high because of previous DVDs that I have ordered.  The quality has been good and there have been no problems with the orders.",1378252800,,255,4.404255319148936
