8403886,4,B003RUQIU6,"I have several HIghball videos. I believe this is one their earlier ones in my collection. More than just watching trains, the cinematographers at HIghball make their viewing that of the whole. The seasons, the valleys, the mountains, the interplay of man-made locomotives and long-trains winding their way through the obstacles nature grew in their way involve the viewer with many senses. All that is missing are the diesel fumes and creosote of the ties. I highly recommend their Canadian Pacific's Mountain Sub and Rogers Pass dvd of 1999.",1325808000,,543,5.112359550561798
