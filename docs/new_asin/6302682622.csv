494485,5,6302682622,"Errol Flynn is largely forgotten today by the average movie goer which is a shame since he was a genuine superstar of his time.  His dazzling good looks and charm combined with a rakish off screen behavior catipulted him to quick success and gave fuel to detractors who claimed there was little talent behind the perfectly chisled facade.
  In reality, Flynn was a largely underrated actor shackled to many less than stellar productions by the studio's type casting.  His talent for light comedy shows through brilliantly in Gentleman Jim this early forties biopic of Heavyweight Champion James J. Corbett.  The movie is factual fluff when it comes to Corbett's personal life, but largely true to history concering his pugilistic efforts.  Corbett did fight on barges and in rich sporting clubs to circumvent the public ban on the sport at the end of the nineteenth century.
  Flynn's considerable atheticism adds further creedence to his excellent portrayl of the turn of the century fighter.  An accomplished amateur boxer in his youth, Fylnn was widely regarded as the best tennis player in Hollywood and his fluid ring movmenents are a welcome relief to the bumbling screen fight efforts of Gable, Tracy and Cagney.
 The beautifully understated post fight meeting of the defeated Sullivan, well played by Ward Bond, complimented by a restrained Flynn as his conquerer, is quite touching and serves as further evidence of Flynn's acting skills.
  Watching Gentleman Jim is great and entertaining fun and can only make one wish Flynn was given more oppurtunities to display a largely untapped talent.",1083628800,23,1602,5.119230769230769
494486,4,6302682622,"Despite several departures from historical accuracy this biography of world heavyweight champion Gentleman Jim Corbett is enjoyable and colourful entertainment with a performance from Errol Flynn that ranks alongside the  liveliest he ever gave.
He is ideally cast as Corbett ,a San Francisco bank clerk ,who defeated John L Sullivan in 1892 ,in New Orleans ,to become world heavyweight champion. Success ,we are told .brought a swollen head ,an over indulgence in liquour and a tendency to braggadocio. This is plain wrong-Corbett was a modest and self effacing man throughout his life ,and it was this which earned him the soubriquet ""Gentleman Jim ""
Raoul Walsh -a splendid action director-directs with typical vigour and keeps thinks moving briskly with the fight scenes in particular being fine,although ,for my taste the scenes of comic relif are too broad and unsubtle. Neither does the love interst tacked on to the movie ,with Alexis Smith's society woman who becomes entangled with Corbett, work too well. The actual Corbett-Sullivan bout is well staged and Flynn accurately catches the man's revolutionary ,scientific pugilistic style.
Ignore its departures from the facts and this is enjoyable big studio film making from the golden era of the studio system with a charismatic performance from the star and some solid period detail.",1063584000,17,1344,5.309859154929577

494489,4,6302682622,"Gentleman Jim features what I think may be the most relaxed performance I have seen Errol Flynn give in a movie.  He's seems very comfortable and at home in this somewhat fictious account of the life of boxer James Corbett.  Flynn is cocky and charming as usual in this story of how Corbett rose from being a bank teller to world champion.  A beautiful and sassy Alexis Smith is along as the love interest, while Alan Hale is his very Irish father, William Frawley his manager, Jack Carson his best buddy, and Ward Bond his biggest rival.  Everyone is very good and appears to be having a great time.  The boxing sequences are well staged by director Raoul Walsh, and generous doses of humour are found throughout.  It teeters on corny at times, but it is all played with such energy and obvious enjoyment, the corny moments can be overlooked.  As usual for most Warner Bros biopics, I'm sure it takes many liberties with the truth, but it doesn't matter.  The film is very entertaining in its presentation of his life and how boxing evolved.",1021507200,31,1042,4.594594594594595
494490,4,6302682622,"The boxing scenes in this excursion from 1942 are well done and excitingly staged;  Flynn was the perfect choice to play Corbett, and the actor apparently approached his subject seriously (which wasn't always the case with Flynn!).  James J. Corbett was of Irish parentage, twice expelled from school for boyish pranks, married an actress at 19, (later divorced) he was a quick-thinking, bright, brash, confident man with a ""gentlemen's demeanor""; Flynn sustained and made believable his characterisation. Ward Bond is first rate as John L. Sullivan and Bill Frawley is great in his role as Billy Delaney. Unfortunately, this film is annoyingly uneven. The writers invented a wholly fictitious and rather unbelievable love interest (how unusual for 1940's Hollywood!)  But it doesn't stop there. There are incidents in the film which wander far from authenticity;  Corbett's charactured Irish family is accompanied by painful attempts at humour  - which, unfortunately,  - tend to mar the film. However, despite it's negative aspects, this is a favourite film among Flynn devotees and it was one of Flynn's own personal favourites among his own films.",1018051200,14,1151,5.331491712707182
494491,4,6302682622,"A rather smashing tale of the bygone years of fist fighting,(boxing?) sporting clubs and general Raul Walsh mayhem. Its all served up by a stellar cast that includes; Alexis Smith( with her most appealing upsweeps) Jack Carson, Bill Frawley, Alan Hale (sr), John Loder, Minor Watson et all.
The concepts are dated, the dialogue is somtimes absurd, the social moires are a bit comical and even the fight scenes are a bit over the top. All this really doesnt matter because if you have the charsima of Errol Flynn..and the elegance of Alexis Smith it all seems to work.
Ward Bond does a fine turn as John L. Sullivan....himself..

494492,3,6302682622,"Glossy Warner Bros. comedy-melodrama mainly designed to show off Errol Flynn's impudent charm and youthful athleticism -- which it does beautifully. The movie features a typically professional recreation of the turn of the century, though as usual they lay the period detail on thick (Flynn's roistering Irish family may have you lunging for the remote). But the fight scenes are great, especially a very atmospheric match at the waterfront, complete with huge old ships docked just beyond the ring. Flynn has a nice scene with Ward Bond at the end, too, showing the sensitive actor he could be when he had the chance.",967852800,3,618,5.009708737864078
494493,5,6302682622,"In real life, Errol Flynn was no pushover. Despite devastating good looks and a wickedly easygoing charm, he could hold his own in either a one-on-one fightfight or a barroom brawl. He was, in fact, one of the most feared fighters in Hollywood.
""Gentleman Jim,"" the story of 19th century boxer James J. Corbett, gave Warner Brothers a chance to put their bad boy on display at his physical best -- exhibiting a lean, mean physique and an undeniable flair for ring work. His toothy grin, devil-may-care charm and boyish glee in a good fight all combined to make ""Gentleman Jim"" one of the 1940s' most compelling films, and one of Warner Brothers' biggest hits.
It is interesting to note that during the filming of ""Gentleman Jim,"" Flynn collapsed and was carted off to the hospital. He was diagnosed, at the ripe old age of 32, of having had a mild heart attack. His co-star in the film, Alexis Smith, visited him and begged him to slow down his destructive lifestyle. Flynn, she later said, flashed that beautiful smile of his and shook his head.
""I enjoy this side of life,"" he told her, ""and don't care to see the other side.""  END",891820800,16,1133,4.58128078817734

494881,5,6302682622,"The Motion Picture ""Gentlemen Jim"" is interesting and enjoyable.""Gentlemen Jim"" is as much about the fight game as it is about John L Sullivan. It is a particular time that Jim Corbett takes center stage. The sport of Pugilism was a time ago illiegal with participants settling there differences with bare knuckles. This was very brutal stuff with legendary fights a matter of record. I put forward that this motion picture was about John L Sullivan,it is that and more. John L Sullivan sometimes called ""The Boston Strong Boy"" was very real,He once traveled the country with a number of other fighters  whereby he fought all comers for a fee. His accomplishment was an outstanding accomplishment of 250 Wins by Knockout with some 400 fights in all with no defeats. These were not official bouts but something of a ""goodwill tour"", many are a matter of record with others merely a historical footnote. John L Sullivan fought such brutal stuff that a particular fight with one Jake  Kilrane lasted some 76 rounds before the fight was broken up. It was scheduled  to go 80 Rounds. Jake Kilrane was so badly mauled that he spent an extended amount of time in a hospital. This is the real story as Pugilism was perhaps nearer a gladiator than some  gentile equivalent.""Gentlemen Jim"" is in part the story of the changing of the guard and the changing of the rules from bare knuckles to Boxing Gloves to 3 minute rounds plus. The film introduces ""The Marques of Queensbury Rules"" which in fact to this very day serve as the governing basis to Professional Prizefighting. John L Sullivan had 35 recorded Professional Prizefights with only 1 loss and that loss this motion picture tells about. Jim Corbett was slightly taller with John L Sullivan possessing a slightly greater reach. The ""Boston Strong Boy"" was as well sometimes known as the ""Honest BackWoodsman"" with Jim Corbett possessing a talent as a performer. He,Jim Corbett starred more than once in one man shows providing for a true compliment to his career in the ring. Jim Corbett was well spoken,and well mannered perhaps why he gained the nick name as ""Gentlemen Jim"".Jim Corbetts boxing career was nowhere near the likes that made for John L Sullivan however Jim Corbett fought one Peter ""Black Prince"" Jackson to a 61 round Draw and it is thought to have been good enough for Sullivan. Jim Corbett once in possession of the crown held onto it for nearly five years when he unexpectedly lost it to Bob Fitzsimmons. The motion picture ""Gentlemen Jim"" stars Ward Bond as John L Sullivan,Jack Carson as Walter Lowrie, Alexis Smith as Victoria Ware, Minor Watson as Buck Ware(Victoria's Wares Father), William Frawley as Billy Delaney  and Alan Hale Sr. portraying Jim Corbetts Father Pat Corbett. Arthur Shields portrayed Father Burke with Dorothy Vaughan as Ma Corbett.  Errol Flynn portrayed Jim Corbett with the Directing of Raoul Walsh being mentioned for good cause. The choice of Errol Flynn for the lead may of been aided by the fact that Flynn was well known for his skills in a boxing ring. He could very ably defend himself. This is a very good and very entertaining film. I might actually suggest with care that this particular motion picture is a sleeper. It was not the likes of a ""Yankee Doodle Dandy"" nor ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" nor even ""They Died with There Boots On""it was just on this, one night in the year of 1970 which is when I first viewed ""Gentlemen Jim"". The viewing of this film was like a discovery and so well thought of as a discovery perhaps of entertainment that it is well to mention it. This film it is suggested has everything going for including the flood. It is full of spirit and love and to put it any other way would be foolish. This is great entertainment. I do not have nor is there any reservation in recommending ""Gentlemen Jim"" as first class entertainment. I would recommend to anyone who happens upon this particular review do not short change your viewing of this film as there are scenes that have the capacity to put this motion picture over the top. It is that worth mentioning.",1393027200,,4092,4.732117812061711

Sullivan is also over the top...bigger than life, especially when you consider that he packed the weight of a light heavyweight.

494952,5,6302682622,"Except for shots of his dancing feet, which actually belonged to former Jr. Welterweight champ Mushy Callahan, Errol Flynn did all his boxing stunts in GENTLEMAN JIM. Flynn suffered a mild heart attack during production but after a brief hiatus came back to finish the fight scenes.

There's any number of historical errors in Raoul Walsh's biopic of heavyweight champ James J. Corbett. Accepting that it's a fictional account of a real person is easy, for this picture is just so likable. Flynn's Corbett is an ambitious fellow from the wrong sde of the tracks. He's a bank teller who quickly ascends the societal ladder while turning a penchant for familial donnybrooks into a marketable skill: Jim simultaneously becomes a dandy and a pugilist of renown.

As depicted here, boxing was illegal in Corbett's San Francisco, yet this didn't stop the organizing of matches which were often raided by the cops. In one scene, Jim and an opponent square off on a moored barge located next to a ship that also appeared in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-SEA-HAWK/dp/6301977149/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE SEA HAWK</a>&nbsp;(1940).

As good as Flynn is in the ring, Ward Bond's flamboyant John L. Sullivan is his equal. Their battle for the title is this movie's highlight, a very well-constructed and executed sequence. As boxing films go, this one's up there with the best of them. Flynn's charisma never flags and his fisticuffs always look genuine. GENTLEMAN JIM is a knockout of a sports picture. Don't miss it!

494959,4,6302682622,"Well this movie was very original and very Irish Classic film, full of entertainment for the whole family.  A real gentleman who deep down respected another sportsman after a challenge that nobody else could see possible. This was a showman;( Errol Flynn)that really impressed me to believe in his determination to achieve the impossible and possess so much self belief and strong belief to take on and defeat the champion fighter that ""Shook the World"".  Actor Ward Bond was perfect for his role as John L Sullivan, and I was left with a feeling of why is the World so different today? This story was simple but full of fun and old fashioned laughs from great characters from a different age of hats and drinkers but good people. Women and men that really are no different than those real people of today.",1300838400,,806,4.669014084507042
494960,5,6302682622,"Except for shots of his dancing feet, which actually belonged to former Jr. Welterweight champ Mushy Callahan, Errol Flynn did all his boxing stunts in GENTLEMAN JIM. Flynn suffered a mild heart attack during production but after a brief hiatus came back to finish the fight scenes.

There's any number of historical errors in Raoul Walsh's biopic of heavyweight champ James J. Corbett. Accepting that it's a fictional account of a real person is easy, for this picture is just so likable. Flynn's Corbett is an ambitious fellow from the wrong sde of the tracks. He's a bank teller who quickly ascends the societal ladder while turning a penchant for familial donnybrooks into a marketable skill: Jim simultaneously becomes a dandy and a pugilist of renown.

As depicted here, boxing was illegal in Corbett's San Francisco, yet this didn't stop the organizing of matches which were often raided by the cops. In one scene, Jim and an opponent square off on a moored barge located next to a ship that also appeared in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-SEA-HAWK/dp/6301977149/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE SEA HAWK</a>&nbsp;(1940).

As good as Flynn is in the ring, Ward Bond's flamboyant John L. Sullivan is his equal. Their battle for the title is this movie's highlight, a very well-constructed and executed sequence. As boxing films go, this one's up there with the best of them. Flynn's charisma never flags and his fisticuffs always look genuine. GENTLEMAN JIM is a knockout of a sports picture. Don't miss it!

495032,4,6302682622,"So great to have this to add to our collection of solidly entertaining movies that we can watch many times and not get tired of. We're Ward Bond fans. He beefed-up and buffed-up for his role of John L. Sullivan, with all that swagger and commanding Irish pride he does so masterfully. A blustering,larger-than-life, unforgetable character.
Errol Flynn is top-drawer- seems just an extension of himself. Lively and polished as he plays an over-confidant charmer that gets a lot of lucky breaks but never seems to notice. His humility with the beaten Sullivan is the balance. Are those actually his dancing feet in the ring? This is only our second Flynn movie to own. We'll be looking for more.
The supporting characters really make the movie more fun and endearing- like Jack Carson and Alan Hale. Mr. Hale is a great characature and, again, over-the-top, but it's just that kind of license to take to keep the movie humming along. He's the kind of guy everyone wants at holiday parties.
Alexis Smith is a beautiful balance to all this male animation. She's keeping her cool head, but chimes in with her own willful and emotion-driven replies. Again, all the characters keep the movie moving with a lighthearted flow.
Just a great, enjoyable evening's entertainment.",1225065600,2,1266,4.920560747663552

495034,4,6302682622,"When I was given this movie I did not know what to expect. As a fairly young guy I had never even heard of Errol Flynn let alone had any desire to watch the film itself.

As soon as I started watching though I instantly was drawn into the movie. Errol plays Gentlemen Jim Corbett, a fighter who turned boxing from its roots of brutish fights into an art. You watch as he grows in his career until the match with John L. Sullivan the toughest competition around.

The movie was exciting to watch and Errol's character's charm is easily seen on the screen. The only piece of the movie that really hurts it is the fact that many members of the audience today will not adapt well with the movie. While very fun to watch it doesn't have the flair of movies today. What's worse is it also seems to lack any form of real plot twist --- while it's fun to watch Errol win fights you never really see anything that makes you feel like he'll have trouble outside of his fight with John L.

Either way, the movie is a gem and while most people will not enjoy it today if you're into fun exciting movies and can put up with some inability to adapt to the times then this is the sort of movie for you.",1207526400,,1187,4.1521739130434785

Errol Flynn was never bolder and more dashing and arrogant than he was in this role.  With an excellent cast, the period piece of the 1890s reminds us of what boxing was like way back when.  The movie builds to its inevitable climax of Corbett beating Sullivan and, along with it, a rare dose of humility in his treatment of the great John L. following the victory.  It is here where the movie reaches its highest level of greatness.  A worthwhile view for sure.",1187827200,,562,4.524752475247524

495038,5,6302682622,"Walsh's splendidly robust biopic of Corbett, the first fighter to win the world heavyweight title under the more refined Marquis of Queenberry rules he helped draft (i.e. no biting, kicking, or clawing), is one of Hollywood's greatest sports dramas. Flynn's deft handling of Corbett's outsize personality--a mix of classy manners and boorish bluster--and Bond's own turn as Sullivan, a champion boxer who can ""lick any man in creation,"" are the film's main attraction. In dramatizing Corbett's colorful career, Walsh handles the action exceedingly well, especially the final ring showdown, a bout as jarring and thrilling as anything in Scorsese's ""Raging Bull.""",1182470400,,662,5.564356435643564
495119,4,6302682622,"Gentleman Jim is another case of print the legend, with Errol Flynn playing the legendary boxer as a brash but charismatic social climber in a rollicking entertainment that barely stops for breath. It's as pointless looking for historical accuracy here as it is in Flynn's The Charge of the Light Brigade - this is sheer hokum with all the stops pulled out, filmed on a surprisingly lavish scale and given a real sense of energy by Raoul Walsh's vivid direction. Flynn is still at the height of his powers (you'd never guess he suffered a mild heart attack during the production), with Alexis Smith a beautiful romantic sparring partner and perpetual sidekick Alan Hale along for good measure, this time as Flynn's father (Jack Carson takes sidekick duties this time). Indeed, even the pirate galleon from Flynn's earlier movies makes a somewhat out-of-place cameo in a dockside bout! The 103 minutes just breeze by.

Warners' DVD boasts a fine black and white transfer with a good selection of extras - a radio adaptation, original trailer, cartoon Foney Fables and two sports shorts (one featuring Ronald Reagan and Jane Wyman!).",1180310400,2,1131,4.984126984126984

The amazing thing is how the character of Errol Flynn wins our sympathy little by little, despite his huge ego and conceit. The same way he finally wins the rich girl. Great characterizations, wonderful direction by Raoul Walsh (one of his best films), fantastic sets. There's not a dull moment in its 2 hours of film. Ward Bond does a great performance too as the final rival for the title. It has all the ingredients of a truly great classic. But best of all is the role of Corbett (Flynn), it just suits him perfect. One more masterpiece for the collection.",1177718400,4,622,4.663636363636364
495123,5,6302682622,"I loved this movie. My only regret is they don't have it in dvd. Great historical movie of James J. Corbett. Truly the father of scientific boxing. It was said when someone saw him in his coffin when he had died, ""He doesn't even have a scar on his face"" That is how good of a boxer he was. He fought great fighters, and done well against them all because of his acquired skill. The movie brings some of this out. His movement and his left jab, keeping his opponenets off balance. He came along at a time when boxing was primarily brawling with the bigger, harder hitting man the victor most of the time. Corbett was most of the time 185 to 195 pounds. A small heavyweight these days. But he consistently beat men heavier than himself. Flynn brings this out in this movie. I don't know how truthful the romance part was in the movie, probably typical hollywood. But a great movie never the less.",1174435200,,895,4.365269461077844
495124,5,6302682622,"Over acted, historically innacurate, and absolutely one of my favorite movies!!! The chemistry between Flynn and Smith (to be used again in other films) is amazing for the time. Their last lines to each other in the movie were a great example of the banter between the two. Ward Bond, Jack Carson, and William Frawley (plus others) all played their parts in this charming free-from-all-fact story of Jim Corbett's rise to the heavyweight championship finally doing what no man had done before...defeat John L. Sullivan.

I have warn out my VHS and am thrilled to have it coming out on DVD. There are a lot of funny classics that are at last comng out on DVD. This is more comedy and light entertainment, but well done. It has some of the tongue-in-cheek that The Man Who Came to Dinner has, which I would highly recommend as well.

I can't wait to watch the brawling, the foot work, and the flair that Flynn had in this delightful movie. It looks like it would have been fun to make :)",1169683200,4,985,4.52808988764045
495125,5,6302682622,"In my bold opinion, Errol Flynn's portrayal of Gentleman Jim Corbett was one of his finest performances.  I have been an Flynn fan since the age of 10, I am now 74.  My grandfather introduced me to this marvelous actor and for that I will be forever grateful.

I am replacing my VHS tapes with the DVDs as they are released.  This film MUST be released on DVD for all of the Errol Flynn fans around the world.

Final note: Like Errol Flynn, I too have a Standard Schnauzer and guess what I named him:  You are correct: Corbett!

495126,4,6302682622,"Well, I am delighted to hear a rumor that this may finally be issued on DVD in 2006, In my humble opinion, this is Errol Flynn's most entertaining film, especially when ""Gentleman Jim"" Corbett's ring career begins in the film. Then it goes from a good film to a great one.

Few people could play arrogant men and still come off as a likeable good guy as well as Flynn could and this film is a perfect example of that. Reportedly, this was Flynn's favorite role and I believe that. You can just sense how much fun he was having here. Ward Bond also looks like he was really enjoying his role playing the famous John L. Sullivan. Bond, too, was never better.

There is just the right amount of action boxing scenes in here and they are pretty well done, too. Corbett's family is fun to watch, too, as they carry on in the stands during Jim's matches. Out of the arena, Corbett's family's constant arguments and yelling can get a little too loud and annoying but they set the stage for a fitting conclusion.

And speaking of the conclusion, Sullivan's speech to Corbett after the big fight is very touching and the highlight of the film. Some mean-spirited critics (Variety, for example) didn't like that ending nor the fact that much of the film is fictionalized but - duh - most films are fictionalized, like it or not. And, in this case, it made for a nice story and nice ending. (In real life, Corbett was a very soft-spoken true gentleman, not anything like Flynn's portrayal, but Flynn still make him a good guy.)

This is one of the more entertaining classic films I have ever watched.",1147305600,8,1589,4.4878892733564015

It needs to be because it is a classic movie. The boxing shown was actually very good for it's time.
