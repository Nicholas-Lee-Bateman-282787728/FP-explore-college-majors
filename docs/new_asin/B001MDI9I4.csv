Of course, it features several of my favorite Brit actors, so that was no surprise. It definitely lived up to the high standards BBC has set for TV series.

3695419,4,B001MDI9I4,"I am a HUGE HUGE fan of BBC programming and this show did not let me down. As an American who appreciates quality, intelligent shows/programs, I am really partial to the programming on BBC. Not everything -but 80 percent of it (I have seen A TON of shows) is down right brillant. This show is really well done and well acted. I am a great lover of mystery and suspense with the sprinklings of the criminal element. The acting, the writing and the story development is well executed. If you are a fan of the mystery of Jack the Ripper coupled with the solid acting then this is your show. BBC once again proves its mastery!!!!!",1298246400,67,626,4.405172413793103
3695420,5,B001MDI9I4,"I loved this series. I would call it ""well-crafted"". The three episode length was a perfect fit for the drama/suspense. If you're a fan of Spooks, you will enjoy seeing Rupert PJ in a much more vulnerable role, and of course when he's with Phil Davis (who must be 2 feet shorter than RPJ) there is that true partner tension. Some of these hallmarks are cliche in TV, but here they work together really well. If you like good old fashioned suspense thrillers, you'll probably enjoy curling up with the lights out for this one. I couldn't wait to watch the next episode.",1297209600,64,568,4.524271844660194
3695421,5,B001MDI9I4,"well paced, well written, well dressed... interesting characters. My only complaint is that there are only these three episodes available right now. Hopefully we will get season 2 on  Amazon",1292716800,25,190,5.333333333333333

If you love Inspector Morse, Inspector Frost, Inspector Lewis, then this is for you!",1290124800,27,360,4.492307692307692
3695423,4,B001MDI9I4,BBC again offers quality of quantity and this 3 part series engages the viewers with a modern copycat Jack the Ripper on the loose in modern Whitechapel.  Fastidious acting by Steve Pemberton from The League of Gentlemen and a very capable cast make up the rest of a well layered piece of TV crime drama.  The cinematography and storyline will keep you held rapt until the end of Season 1.  The video glitches a bit but use your Amazon DL video credit and you won't feel so bad.,1282176000,3,478,4.409090909090909

3695438,4,B001MDI9I4,"Whitechapel is a dark series that gets darker over four seasons.  I rate season 4 three stars and the first three seasons a dwindling five stars.

An assortment of idiosyncratic, well-developed, and well-played (if not always likeable) characters investigate sets of serial murderers. The main character is DI Chandler, a novice w/ friends in high places, who struggles with serious, but not quite incapacitating, obsessive compulsive disorder. His sidekick is DS Miles, a seasoned detective who resents what he sees as Chandlers ineptitude but ultimately credits his OCD for progress in their work. They are aided by Edward Buchan, a highly competent crime historian fancied by Chandler and despised by Miles. He is not on the payroll, but Buchan, an expert on the Jack the Ripper, at least initially supports himself by conducting Ripper tours of London and selling books. Several other well developed characters round out the team.

In each of the first two seasons, three episodes address a single basic story line. In the first, by helping to stop a Jack the Ripper copycat, Buchan is discovered. In the second, hampered by insiders on and off the team and aided by Buchan, Chandler and Miles bring down an infamous gang resurrected a couple of decades after the incarceration of its now dead founder.

Each of the remaining two seasons has six episodes. Episodes in the third season appear in pairs with three story lines addressing different sets of murders. The final season addresses two discrete strings of murder, but the story lines are integrated. The final scene seems to set the stage for more. Alas, that was not to be. Whatever the cause, cancellation appears unrelated to ratings. Rated at 4.6, the final season beats the firsts 4.4 and the seconds 4.5 ratings.

Reviews of season 4 foretelling increasingly explicit mayhem coupled with paranormal overlays, made me reluctant to continue. For those similarly put off by gore, not to mention paranormal folderol, I must say that, fascinated by Chandler, Miles, Buchan, and other members of the team, I did continue. Moreover, I have no regrets. Others, too, may find excellent acting and further character development adequate compensation for unnecessarily grisly scenes and pithy story lines.",1507852800,5,2261,5.1498637602179835

3695441,3,B001MDI9I4,Until Season 3 it did not make any sense to me as to why this English detective series was so inferior to others.  If you are a fan of English mysteries you may know what I mean by watching until Season 3.  I will not reveal or spoil this for anyone as to my meaning.  It doesn't measure up beause I think this may be earlier in the careers of the actors & writers.,1504137600,4,365,3.9054054054054053
3695442,5,B001MDI9I4,"This is a great series with one exception.

None of the officers carry guns which is totally laughably ridiculous. In today's world, an officer who cannot defend himself with lethal weapons is absurd. Watching these officers going up against bad guys with no way of protecting themselves destroys the credibility of the series especially in today's world. They really need to get with the times.

On the other hand the stories are very well written and interesting.",1503187200,,465,5.025974025974026

3695454,3,B001MDI9I4,"This British police procedural starts with the same stereotypes that annoy me about older American police procedurals--the police in the beginning are depicted as bumbling, incompetent, and apathetic, while the newcomer is fresh-faced and about to set things straight.  The last episode is the best of the 3, but I wouldn't watch the first 2 again just to get to that one.",1501459200,,372,5.0
3695455,4,B001MDI9I4,"DI Joseph Chandler is played by Rupert Penry-Jones. I have seen in many previous BBC series, like Mi-6, and enjoyed his work. This drama has more thoughtfulness than we see in the American counterparts.

This series is a police drama based on the Jack the Ripper murders. These are copycat Jack Ripper murders, and it takes almost the first episode for DI Chandler to recognize this. It takes a Ripperologist to identify the similarities.  Whitechapel is full of spooky shadows and artful glimpses of gory doings. But, we do not see the blood and gore inherent in the Ripper murders, we hear about them being described.

The characters on Whitechapel drew me in very quickly. We have the street-level detectives with the polished DI Chandler. The quirky Ripper expert brings an expertise to the investigation. It is fun to watch these men clash and then collaborate. The suspense level ratchets up with the pursuit of the Ripper copycat.  Whitechapel is a drama, and the storyline has three hour  episodes. This is a high quality series, you will enjoy.

3695459,5,B001MDI9I4,"This first season of ""Whitechapel"" commences a decidedly dark and stylish British detective drama from BBC America, depicting modern-day Jack-the-Ripper copycat murders. As is the case with most BBC America programming, ""Whitechapel"" is intelligent, intriguing, and suspenseful. The writing, the sets, and the acting are all superb. In addition, the concomitant interpersonal drama between the inexperienced command detective, and his hardened veteran investigators, makes for an interesting dynamic for the viewers of this excellent series. ""Whitechapel, Season 1"" is an outstanding BBC America detective procedural, and it merits a five-star rating, along with a strong recommendation.",1491609600,6,687,6.166666666666667
3695460,2,B001MDI9I4,I watched seasons 1-3. The characters were well developed and believable with some truly excellent performances. Then your writing staff got lazy and tried to increase the tragedy of the story by killing off characters. The death of the character wasn't necessary to the story and only served to let your writing staff avoid having to write more complex relationships in future episodes.,1490572800,2,387,5.158730158730159

3695463,4,B001MDI9I4,"Great show, unique. Fantastic performances, especially the two lead detectives (head DI and his sergeant). It's a bit too violent for my tastes, so I knocked it from 5 stars to 4 because I felt a lot of the violence and gruesome scenes were unnecessary. Occasionally the stories got goofy, but were quickly pulled back by a good twist at the end of each episode. The single biggest drawback was the gaping loophole involving the head DI's mental health. CLEARLY he was un-fit for duty - even though he was a good detective - but not once do you see him seeking help for his problem, nor does his staff ever once suggest that he should be seeking help. It was disturbing to watch him un-ravel in episode after episode, and also never find happiness from his loneliness and lack of intimacy. I just feel the writers made him TOO dark.",1488672000,3,832,4.516556291390729

As the seasons progress, the characters and their interactions grow more interesting and campy (how can you not love Miles?). It was with great sadness that we reached the end of series 4.

I marked Whitechapel Season 1 down because of the cinematography: All manner of distracting momentary flashbacks, popups, and extraneous matter, apparently in an effort to increase suspense. Unfortunately, the effect was the opposite and negative: It was distracting to the point of losing a sense of continuity. Change the cinematography, make it simpler and more consistent, and the series would benefit mightily.",1478390400,2,484,5.554054054054054

3695791,3,B001MDI9I4,"Whitechapel is a British mystery series first produced for ITV in 2009. The idea is to transport infamous murder cases from history to modern times by way of copycat killers. In Series 1, DI Joseph Chandler (Rupert Penry-Jones) is well-connected, inexperienced, and posted to Whitechapel on his way up the career ladder. A meticulously attired, affluent metrosexual, Chandler doesnt fit in with his new working class colleagues, and abrasive DS Ray Miles (Phil Davis) doesnt miss an opportunity to tell him. As Chandler begins his new job, a woman is found murdered and eviscerated in a school yard. The location and details of the crime resemble a Jack the Ripper crime, specifically the 1888 murder of Mary Ann Nichols. When Ripperologist Edward Buchan (Steve Pemberton) comes forward with a theory that the murder was a copycat, he is dismissed by DS Miles, but Chandler considers the implications and tries to prevent a second copycat murder.

There is a lot about Ripper theories, as the police and Buchan try to anticipate the next murder(s). Thats the most interesting aspect of the show. Otherwise, it is a string of clichs without the charisma to overcome them. DS Miles is ignorant, stubborn, and given to flaunting those features. Im sure Ive seen Phil Davis in this role several times before. He yells a lot. DI Chandler is sleek and well-groomed but lacks confidence and screen presence. Hes like wallpaper. His perpetual crises of confidence are implausible in someone with such a strong sense of what he wants. Steve Pemberton has also played his role before. He looks the parttoo much. And they all come to a grudging mutual respect in the end. Nothing could be more predictable or unrealistic. The murders are gruesome, and the modern Ripper is always at least one step ahead. The mystery and the characters fall flat. Its grisly, mindless entertainment. There are three episodes for a total of 2 hours 15 minutes.",1476403200,,1931,4.959876543209877

3695973,3,B001MDI9I4,"Started watching this on PBS & loyally watched the first 2 seasons.
The 3rd season was off-putting from the start, suddenly trying to imitate teen horror movies...  There was nothing suspenseful, thrilling, or mysterious about it.  (The 2nd season was full of surprises & sufficiently creepy!  I can't understand why they abandoned the formula!)  The only horror season 3 made me feel was for the talented actors who had originally signed up for a well-written mystery series.
Saw part of first episode of season 4, looked up spoilers of the whole ridiculous, ghostly, supernatural season & decided not to ruin the memory of the first 2 seasons.
I started watching this show because I wanted a mystery, I quit watching because it ceased to be one.  I sincerely hope that this doesn't start happening to comedies I watch--changing mid-stream to a drama or tragedy!",1470528000,,863,4.965277777777778

3696087,3,B001MDI9I4,"Good production values and an excellent cast but spoiled by the writing. The conflict between the older members of the experienced murder squad and the new, young detective inspector is too artificial. There is no way even a ""fast-tracked"" police officer could make Detective Inspector and still be so naive. In the first episode we see him reading the metropolitan police equivalent of ""Murder Investigations for Beginners""!

It felt as if the writers were unsure of whether to make a serious drama or more of a light-hearted police procedural. Different elements appear at different times and the incongruity made it difficult for me to suspend disbelief and enjoy.

Sadly, can't really recommend this.",1468540800,2,704,5.221238938053097

The script is well written and the characters are developed throughout the series.  This is one of several BBC shows that I have seen and ranks along with Endeavor, Midsomer Murders and Foyle's War as being well worth the time to watch.  This one seems to be a bit more vivid in the crime depictions than those series.  I have already finished season two and looking forward to binging on season three.  I like the fact that the entire story doesn't have to be wrapped up in 50 minutes.  And the lack of commercials on Amazon is also nice.",1467072000,,661,4.466666666666667

So, although I watched that series a few yrs ago, I still have that character in the back of my mind while watching this one.  Keep wanting his character to be a bit more aggressive in leadership.  But, this series is quite entertaining and quick-paced.  Good acting.  Good mystery.",1466985600,,406,4.583333333333333

I was bothered by the extreme camera work. Unusual angles, indistinguishable close ups, intentional out-of-focus, flashed too quick to be comprehended. I watched another British series called Hinterland and had the very same complaint. I suspect the same people were responsible for shooting and editing both series. It as though they're artists that have become so caught up in being new and innovative for each other's benefit  that they've left the viewing audience behind and diminished the importance of the story.",1464048000,,725,4.838709677419355

A more dysfunctional group of coppers I've never seen, but somehow you believe they can get the job done.
The shooting style is a copy of the style used by the Cohn Bros for ""From Hell"" and was totally appropriate for the ripper themed first season. As time passed, all that rapid cutting, red lighting and out of focus visuals began to pal somewhat, but I still want to know who or what that little old lady Ivers really is.",1463875200,3,592,4.294642857142857

3696770,3,B001MDI9I4,"As British police dramas go, Whitechapel is average.  The first season revolves around a serial killer who is reacting the murders of Jack the Ripper.  The hero is an inexperienced police officer who has been fast tracked for promotion.  If he catches the killer his will look good.  If not, then he is off the fast track.  His superiors are an ugly bunch of elitists and his colleagues are slackers who don't give him respect (at least initially).  He suffers from OCD and has little experience with violent crime.  After the first episode, this all becomes predictable and boring.  I'm now watching the second season.  It seems to have more promise.",1462060800,5,651,4.792792792792793

An intriguing premise, A Jack the Ripper copycat is at work in modern day London. As with many new shows or movies, being introduced to the characters is much of the fun. I'll be interested to see how the producers sustain and expand the characters going forward. Three episodes for the first season felt about right. They could have stretched it to four, but I think the pacing would have suffered. Events move along in rapid enough order so that it never felt slow or dry. I'm looking forward to season two.

My only complaint is that the cinematography is too much like a music video and it doesn't fit. It felt like the director was shooting for spooky but settled for carsick. :P",1461715200,,437,4.905405405405405

The mystery here is foremost, complex and intriguing but the characters develop into well-rounded, interesting people.

I loved the OCD bit but all in all I found the DI to be a bit more wimpy to be believable for this type of role.  Maybe not if they made it into a humorous series but for a serious role this portrayal just did not work.  Still, if the series continues, I will probably watch it.",1419811200,,386,3.923076923076923

3697237,4,B001MDI9I4,"The plot is a little familiar--a murderer who follows a pattern, and the cop who sees the pattern being dismissed as a sap--but the atmosphere and acting are first-rate, and the story builds suspense quite effectively. Interesting character development, too, although again it's familiar--the by-the-book neophyte who is gradually brought to heel by the gritty world of cops-and-murderers. But between the atmosphere and the acting, as well as the  well-written dialogue, it's a good 'un.  And the sound mix is unusually good: they resist the temptation to drown out the dialogue with the musical sound track--the characteristic that makes so many British productions unwatchable without subtitles.",1417305600,,698,5.5754716981132075

3697251,5,B001MDI9I4,"I have no idea why I put off watching this, but was pleasantly surprised when I did. I thought it might be a bit too 'dark' or 'gritty', but actually, it's more along the lines of 'Sherlock', with engaging inter-character relationships, fun, flashy and implausible crimes, and some nice, light moments. The leading characters are extremely likable, and I was sorry to hear that ITV had canceled it. So enjoy it (free streaming with Amazon Prime) while you can.",1416182400,,460,4.8354430379746836

The development of their relationship is both convincing and restrained.  In truth, all characters ring true, and the writing gives them a chance to bring fiction to life.  My one criticism pertains to the visuals.

Rupert Penry-Jones as DI Chandler is believeable, inspiring and, at times, truly heart-breaking.  His supporting cast is also wonderful. This show has an unusual tone -- which I very much enjoyed.

How can you blend historical and current (similar and copy cat) crimes, present an interesting story line, blend mismatched characters, from different social/educational backgrounds, with very different methods and be successful?  The cast, the writers, directors, etc. have amazed me.  I couldn't watch the episodes fast enough.  The conflicts between team members added to the story rather than misdirected your attention.  The false leads and struggles to get the crimes solved pull you in to the tension and desire to catch the criminal(s).  It does take a little time to accept the historian as part of the team, but that is the teams, as well as the viewers, challenge.  Can you start off with a story about Jack the Ripper and go up from there?  YES!

3697470,4,B001MDI9I4,"If you love mysteries and thrillers, this is for you.  The story development is excellent, but what I really loved about this series is the character description.  Not just the detectives, but even the ""secondary "" characters are very well drawn with distinctive personality traits and temperaments.  We see the characters change and grow through the episodes as well.  There is quite a bit of humor in this series as well, which helps dilute the darkness of the subject matter.",1403049600,,478,4.9375

3697473,3,B001MDI9I4,"The DI is not very interesting as a character. Maybe he'll get filled out next season. Supporting cast is good. Story is a little hard to believe -- beyond the usual. Always wondering where the heck the police force is; no way this big, widely publicized crisis would be handled by this small group of detectives, running all over the place themselves, so that the hero gets to confront the villain in person unarmed, etc., etc. Apparently there's only one tactical squad in the entire city, and they've gone home.",1402790400,,514,4.722222222222222

3697475,4,B001MDI9I4,"Watched first show and will continue to see the rest of the series. Interesting premise, good cast, solid policework and some good surprises.
Interesting take on the Jack the Ripper legend, and a modern day copycat killer.",1402790400,,222,5.027027027027027
3697476,3,B001MDI9I4,"A modern day serial killer tries to recreate the Jack the Ripper crimes.  As is often the case in British dramas, the acting is first-rate, but unfortunately the writing and concept are not.  Also according to Wikipedia (so it must be true) present-day Whitechapel neighborhood in London is mainly ethnic and 40% Bangladeshi, but good luck finding anyone who is not white in this show.

Still the acting does keep things afloat.  It's not essential, but not a total waste of time.  But if you want a really good British crime drama, watch Luther instead.",1402531200,,554,4.7894736842105265
3697477,5,B001MDI9I4,Love this series. Quite addictive I watch two episodes in a row. Interesting concept to solve crimes using past crimes as lessons.,1402444800,,130,4.954545454545454

3697481,5,B001MDI9I4,"Whitechapel runs red in a series of murders of women. Newly promoted Detective Inspector Chandler, tall, handsome and untried must prove to the men in his division that he has what it takes and is not simply an expert in three day courses and police politics, i.e. boot-licking. The members of his division sneer at him at first as he successfully orders them to wear neckties, put their trash in bins and tidy up their office and take a shower now and then. Slovenly policemen do not get respect. Chandler's chief opponent is Sergeant Inspector Miles, who is the proverbial hard-boiled cynical detective. The men obey Chandler, they have to but their grumbles subside as they see their new boss develop into a leader commanding their respect. They clean up their office, don neckties, albeit garish ones,put their trash in bins, stop belching and chewing gum and lolling on desks.

A Ripperologist warns that a copycat Ripper is on the lose who will one by one imitate the ghastly mutilations of 1888. Edward Buchan, the Ripper enthusiast, conducts Ripper tours and Chandler joins one of them. Buchan predicts where the killer will strike next, the officers go to that area, lounge around all night and then they hear a terrible scream....

Not only are the distinct and interesting characters beautifully played but the camera crew create absolutely fantastic scenes, sometimes garish, sometimes shimmering like a mirage, sometimes lunging back and forth to portray tension, brilliant color suddenly giving way to immensely moody and terrifying thready darkness where you think you see something awful. (You do). The camera hones in on the faces, too, so close the emotions are vividly portrayed, almost in slow motion. The camera loves Chandler's beautiful hands, moving in often on his restless fingers, hands that could grace a violin.

 Whitechapel is exciting, taut and fast-moving yet strangely intimate with sharp stabs of gallows humor to alleviate the tenseness of a murder scene. It is a classy production, breathtakingly origina",1401840000,4,2041,5.12012012012012
3697482,3,B001MDI9I4,"Interesting concept for a mini-series. A bad guy wants to re-enact Jack the Ripper cases in modern times. Penry-Jones is a likable enough guy (though I liked him far better in MI-5). The pacing is good and the acting is fine. The writing is a bit trite at times and guilty of over using hackneyed plot lines: new fast-track DI with little experience meets skeptical and slovenly team but our hero comes through in the end. Arguably, the most trite of all... our hero is repelled by gore. As I suggested, in spite of some lack of creativity in the sub-plots, it was entertaining overall and I plan to watch the subsequent seasons.",1401753600,,629,4.575221238938053

3697484,5,B001MDI9I4,"If you dig British mysteries, but are a bit weary of settings reminiscent of Downton Abbey, this is just the ticket.  Gritty and atmospheric Whitechapel has mystery, horror, conspiracies, and oddball characters, all wrapped up in a breakneck police procedural.  Thank goodness this first season has only 3 episodes, since you'll stay up late just to watch all 3.

3697491,5,B001MDI9I4,Hard to go wrong with Rupert Penry-Jones in the cast.  He seems to be very credible in whatever role he plays.  The interaction amongst the characters was believable and it's a nice touch that DI Chandler is a touch obsessive-compulsive.,1400889600,,237,4.9

It's well-cast with great cinematography, original dialogue, compelling plot, atmospheric - everything is quality about it.  It's amusing, dramatic, and feels real life.  Like to watch these British mysteries while on the tread mill, and this series will be motivating to get on the treadmill to watch.

3697549,4,B001MDI9I4,"The series just doesn't have that ""it"" factor for me. Not one that I enjoy watching, and will likely not finish the series.",1396137600,,123,4.391304347826087
3697550,5,B001MDI9I4,Not for everybody's taste. Parts are violent.  Not for children.  Interesting psychological-type story about Ripper copy cat. Season 2 and 3 are similar.,1395964800,,153,5.608695652173913
3697551,4,B001MDI9I4,"I have gotten hooked on the quirkiness of this series. The language is a bit hard to follow sometimes but I don't know if that is my from hearing, I am hard of, or the dialogue and the difference of accents. I am looking forward to more these characters.",1395964800,,254,4.204081632653061

3697553,5,B001MDI9I4,I really enjoyed the interaction between the character's.  The story lines and cases are interesting. I wish they would release season 4 the final season.,1395964800,,154,5.16
3697554,4,B001MDI9I4,I liked this more for the personal relationships amongst the protagonist and his precinct rather than the Jack the Ripper plot line.,1395964800,,132,5.045454545454546

3697556,4,B001MDI9I4,"This is just another British police procedural, but with a twist. DCI Chandler and his crew are depicted warts and all, and with each episode the viewer gets to know them better. The story line is gritty and gory with abundant serial killings to satisfy the weariest fan of the genre.",1395878400,,284,4.588235294117647
3697557,3,B001MDI9I4,lots of the same background personal issues as other shows... seems derivative... but entertaining enough to watch if you don't need a challenging show,1395878400,,151,5.333333333333333
3697558,5,B001MDI9I4,The usual squad room police procedural?  Yes and no.  Exceptional writing with deepening character profiles with each episode.  Interesting crimes.  Highly recommended.,1395792000,,168,6.5
3697559,5,B001MDI9I4,The copycat murderer makes for good drama when presented as well as this series.  Especially interesting character development.....well acted in believable settings.  Worth your time to view.,1395705600,,191,6.037037037037037
3697560,5,B001MDI9I4,"I think almost anyone will find this to be enjoyable and deeply interesting to watch.

3697561,5,B001MDI9I4,"I love Rupert Penny-Jones so when I saw he was starring in this British series, I ordered it (via prime).
Watched three episodes and while some of it was about gruesome (it tells of a copycat Jack the Ripper
living in present times) it was very good story telling and well acted by all the cast.",1395446400,,295,4.285714285714286

3697563,4,B001MDI9I4,"Another British show that makes something out of nothing. Season one (three episodes) chases a Jack The Ripper copycat. But is also follows the main character as he stumbles through his new position, and his sergeant who resents him. Put it all together, and it makes for a very entertaining evening or evenings.",1395360000,,312,4.90566037735849

3697565,4,B001MDI9I4,I liked this show in spite of the gory scenes they love to show.  I have seen Rupert Penry-Jones in other British TV movies and I really like him as an actor.  I will be watching the other Seasons that are available on Amazon Prime.,1395187200,,232,4.133333333333334
3697566,3,B001MDI9I4,"The acting in this series is quite good, but the idea is not exactly original.  It's another take on the Jack the Ripper mystery.  But, for those who have not seen too many of the other versions, it's pretty good.  There is a lot of graphic violence, so one might not want children to view this.",1395187200,,295,4.232142857142857
3697567,5,B001MDI9I4,Great camera angles setting the mood for a dark thriller. The British actors are very good. This is mixture of the present and the past in crime. I recommend this series.,1395100800,,170,4.516129032258065
3697568,4,B001MDI9I4,"Just watched Season One, Episode One, and found it to be very good.  I have to use the subtitles because the accents are occasionally difficult to understand, but other than that, a very good show.",1395014400,,197,4.628571428571429
3697569,4,B001MDI9I4,"Proved not to be your standard British crime drama.  People make mistakes, a well-groomed commander sheds his place as inherited Met Royalty to be a real boss, and the criminal is not brought before the bar or felled by hubris.",1395014400,,227,4.675
3697570,5,B001MDI9I4,"Another excellent British mystery series.  Running out of choices and came across this one on Amazon Prime.  Think Prime Suspect, A Touch of Frost, etc.  This one has a different, rather unique story line relating the theories about & solving of past murders to newly committed crimes.  We watch all seasons and liked it.",1394841600,,321,4.888888888888889
3697571,5,B001MDI9I4,"Without a doubt, the best show on tv! The British have got it right, realistic actors, perfect characterizations, and twisted plots galore. I just wish American television would pull it's head out and take some much needed lessons from the British.",1394841600,,248,5.073170731707317
3697572,5,B001MDI9I4,"I like gritty detective stories written with ingenuity as this was.  The British penchant for making characters human, real and life size rather than the typical larger than life Hollywood style heroes is another reason for my rating.  Here was a chance to put a new spin on the story of  Jack the Ripper putting it in the present era by using the concept of a copycat killer reproducing the details of the Whitechapel Ripper's murders.  Spreading the story over 3 episodes gives plenty of time to develop the main characters.  A gripping mini-series from start to finish.  I was hooked from the get-go.  I was looking for an alternative to my favorite Brit cop series, Luther, and this fit the bill - no pun intended to any fellow ex-pat Brit readers of this review",1394755200,,766,4.62962962962963

3697574,4,B001MDI9I4,A little gory at times but very good character development. Story line on season 2 seems a little far fetched.,1394668800,,110,4.55
3697575,4,B001MDI9I4,i enjoyed the first show of the first season haven't had  time to watch the rest but it seems like my kind of show,1394582400,,114,3.75
3697576,1,B001MDI9I4,I couldn't even watch the whole episode.  The leading character comes off as a cocky putz.  Maybe the characters will develop better as the series continues but I just cant watch anymore.,1394582400,3,187,4.8125
3697577,5,B001MDI9I4,Rupert Perry- Jones is so fantastic.  How do the Brits just keep knocking out these fantastic crime dramas?  Each character is so distinctive.  Could watch all day...and do sometime.,1394582400,,182,5.206896551724138
3697578,5,B001MDI9I4,"I enjoyed this three episode season.  I don't know if there are more seasons, but the first three episodes were great.  The premise of the young detective inspector joining a team of homicide investigators as their new boss and he being very very wet behind the ears was a fun way to get the first episode started.  It was about a copycat Jack the Ripper killer whom they were trying to find.  It was neat to see how the team adapted to the new boss and how he adapted to them.  Besides the plots were really gripping.  I recommend this heartily.",1394409600,,546,4.356435643564357

Although not actually the Ripper, but similar killing mentalities, the acting, writing and directing on this show is wonderful.  RPJ portrays an any thing but ""butch"" leader, but intelligent, tenacious and endearingly flawed.  Love the show and all it's characters, there is such a wealth of talent.",1394064000,,442,4.701298701298701

3697590,5,B001MDI9I4,"I loved it.  DI Chandler is such an interesting character and I loved the way Joe and Miles develop a strong relationship in spite of their differences.  Seriously, who wouldnt love a modern who-done-it about the Ripper?

DI Chandler is such a miss match for his position with his OCD issues or is he?  Ed the researcher adds equal parts creepiness and history that move the story along and Miles; well Miles seems to be the character that puts everything into prospective.  The rest of the cast is also brilliant because each is unique and so very different from any American dramas.

British TV series in general have more depth to their story lines and characters than American TV does.  If you want a lot of razzle dazzle tune in to any USA cop extravaganza, but if you want some more story and character studies give Whitechapel a try.",1393804800,,840,4.597315436241611

3697597,4,B001MDI9I4,Love detective/mystery series and the BBC does a great job of producing them.  If you saw and liked Broadchurch you will also like Whitechapel.  The central detective is a flawed character but pure in his mission.  Great ensemble cast.  Only three episodes in Season 1 so easy to consume all three in one setting.  Only some difficulty in following the British accent which is why only 4 stars.,1393286400,,394,4.735294117647059

Being a full on fan of British Drama, Mystery, Period Pieces and especially Crime/Detective Series, I was as always charmed by the setting of WhiteChapel (the History), the acting was excellent and my praise ends there. While the Writers keep you going as to who the Modern Day Ripper is, the other mysteries are easily solvable, I.e, who's the Mole leaking to the Press. Also, the wannabe Copper, researcher gentleman got on my nerves in the first hour. By the Third Season when DI Chandler hires him on I almost can't watch anymore.

I was a bit leery at first because I am not big on a lot of violence in a show, but you got the idea of the details without having to see every little act being committed.

Binge watched all 3 series that were available. Now anxiously waiting on series 4. It starts off in Series 1 with a copy cat of the Whitechapel murders and the mysteries of Jack the Ripper. The show just gets better from there. Wonderfully done! If you like Sherlock, Luther & The Inspecter Lewis series, this is another great one. Join DI Joe Chandler on an exciting ride!",1391385600,,520,4.663043478260869

But, I am not fond of his character in this season, and now I'm on season 2 so I'll find out if his character improves.  The character is too wimpy, and I have seen Rupert in other shows play a strong character much better. Perhaps he struggles a bit to work in an ""in between"" type of role.

3697647,5,B001MDI9I4,"Whitechapel gets you involved with the characters immediately.  The motivations through ambition, politics, and class prejudice all combine to make this a more in depth program than you would suspect.

3697651,4,B001MDI9I4,"The best crime dramas on television are by the British. Rupert Perry Jones is as as handsome as he is effective as a well educated upper class detective on the fast track for some higher office. He falls in with a group of working class cops not the least impressed with his modern by the book methods. They fall in the middle of a modern day copycat to the notorious ripper murders of Victorian London. It does not go well, they are always one step behind and a minute too late and things are not saved until the last minute. if you are fascinated by the Ripper case or if you just like British crime dramas, you will love this.",1390176000,,629,4.25

I rarely give anything 5 stars, and felt that this series didn't rise to that level, but was very entertaining. Season 1, dealing with a Jack the Ripper copycat, was a bit gruesome at times.

3697696,4,B001MDI9I4,"Whitechapel is entertaining television with a unique approach to crime drama. The ""hook"" of this show, is the cases mirror distinct cases in history. (Can you guess where this is going? I bet you can!) The first season details the assignment of D.I. Joseph Chandler, a fastidious if not downright OCD impaired, well connected ""up and comer"" to the homicide division. Having no legitimate field experience, he is met with resistance, if not outright disdain from his detectives. The first case he encounters looks to be a Jack the Ripper copycat.  (Hence the name, Whitechapel) The mere mention of Jack the Ripper sends his detectives into fits, as their experience has shown that such cases (rightfully labeled or not) bring looneys and self proclaimed ""ripperologists"" out of the woodwork.
The full season deals with the handling of this one case, slowly unraveling the complexities of D.I. Chandler and his relationship with his staff. Chandler, faced with a lack of cooperation, is forced to fall back on his personal brand of dogged determination, is revealed to be fiercely loyal and dedicated in addition to suffering from serious OCD. His team is shown to be hardworking and dedicated despite their sorely lacking first impression.
Whitechapel's unique premise is entertaining but, the writing is somewhat lacking. There are occasional ""gaps"" in the writing that make the detectives and the police dept.  seem a bit bumbling at times. In order to move the script along, the major players are required to make some very unrealistic leaps of faith.
As I watched the first season I remember thinking:"" This show deserved better writing. It won't last long with this treatment.""
The concept of a crime drama that deals with historically relevant crimes in a modern setting, requires some serious talent all around the table.
It seems I was right (although, I wish I wasn't). The upcoming fourth season will be the last.
I highly recommend Whitechapel although I can only give it 4 stars due to the writing. It's ambitious concept makes for entertaining, if unrealistic television.",1387065600,,2083,5.087719298245614
3697697,4,B001MDI9I4,"Warning from the wise, this is an incredibly grisly and gritty TV show. I thank God that I didn't start watching it late at night. After the third disemboweled body in Episode 1, I just about lost it... I've been shaking ever since. No kidding. Or maybe i just need to turn up the thermostat. Despite all this, I will go back for more. It's intriguing and very interesting, but it's the most goddam scariest thing I've ever watched in my life. Definitely not for the squeamish.

Other than that, the characters are good, well-formed, and portrayed very well. Rupert Penry-Jones is an excellent actor, and portrays his character very truthfully. It isn't all just blood-and-gore; there are other problems as well. But thank God (again! twice! Wow!) that there aren't any sappy romances in this gritty show.

So, verdict: Scary, but intriguing, and excellent storyline. Definitely going to be coming back for more.",1386892800,,912,4.915584415584416

3697699,4,B001MDI9I4,"We really enjoyed the acting and setting of this ""mystery,"" though its predictable writing and directing causes me to give it a four star rating rather than five.  I hated the continual flashing of the bloody knife, etc. that was used for every single transition between scenes. We called the killer in episode one as well as other major plot points, but it was still good fun and the top notch actors are a pleasure to watch.",1386720000,,426,4.532467532467533

3697703,5,B001MDI9I4,"A thoroughly enjoyable detective mystery based on historic crimes.  The first season was about a Jack the Ripper copycat in present day Whitechapel.  There is a new commander, from a different class and inexperienced on the street, his working class detectives and the powers that be, who are grooming the new commander but are not interested in integrity, compassion or chivalry.",1386460800,,380,5.213114754098361

3697707,4,B001MDI9I4,"This show isn't quite as gripping as the similarly themed ""Sherlock"", but it's certainly well made, acted and paced. I'm a fan of Ripper lore, and my sister recommended this show to me. The seasons are absurdly short ( 3 45 minute episodes) and I've only finished the first season. The show is the area of Whitechapel, obviously, which is where the original JtR murders took place, however the show takes place in the modern era while the Ripper is still the past. The first season takes off with a Ripper copycat and it's handled very well. The main character are flawed, which I'm a big fan of, as it grounds them and makes them easier to relate to. Without going into too much detail, the show twists nicely, has interesting characters and is portrayed very well, especially by the DI and his assisting DS, and the Ripper Expert they lean on for advice. Apparently, the second and third seasons move away from Jack, and my sister assures me they're equally as good. Fans of English drama, particularly Sherlock, should give this a look into.",1385596800,,1044,4.648648648648648

3697734,5,B001MDI9I4,I can across this TV Series looking for a movie about Jack the Ripper. This British TV series interweaves a modern serial killer that duplicates the original killings of Jack the Ripper. It's brilliantly acted with great story lines with a film noir type setting.

Whitechapel is well written and performed. The actors seem to be very much in touch with the inner workings of the characters.  Penry-Jones' display and use of Chandler's obsessive compulsive behaviors and touch of Asberger's Syndrome are well handled.  Both he and Chandler are aware of the problems and work to overcome the negative effects.  Phillip Davis is perfection as DS Miles, bringing the hardness and jaded views of long experience as a detective, while ineffectively hiding his human side. I enjoyed watching Chandler and Miles learning to work together and respect each other and Ripper expert, Buchan.

3697762,5,B001MDI9I4,"I made the mistake of watching the first episode late in the evening and I couldn't stop until I'd watched all three episodes of the mini-series. A hoary old concept - someone is re-creating the Jack the Ripper murders - done with style, high production values, and filled with Ripper lore.

Detective Inspector Chandler, a foppish and ambitious member of an elite group within the London police force, is promised he will get a promotion if he solves the brutal murder of a woman in the Whitechapel district. He takes over a resentful and rumpled squad of experienced detectives. A Ripper tour guide comes to him and points out the murder matches exactly the circumstances of the Ripper's first victim. His experienced detectives scoff at him, reminding him that every stabbing in Whitechapel is called a Ripper copycat. All too soon it is clear that the theory is correct and more murders will follow on the exact dates that the Ripper murders occurred. Chandler and his squad must try to stop the killer, and soon his career is in peril as his colleagues distance themselves from him.

Chandler is no flawless hero: he suffers from OCD and seems incapable of forming relationships, especially with his squad, who at first disrespect and attempt to undercut him. He does not believe in his own abilities, but is drawn in by the case's mysterious allure.

This is not family viewing, but the gruesome shots are very quick and not entirely clear. The atmosphere is great and the suspense relentless. The climax of the final episode is heartstoppingly suspenseful. I look forward to watching the next two 3 episode seasons.",1378857600,,1622,4.869565217391305

Whitechapel was one of those wonderful surprises that just floored me.  This show is masterfully written and has a magnificent cast of superb artists who weave a wonderfully Whitechapel web of delicious decadent whodunits.  I loved Copper and Ripper Street and was afraid that I would not like this one as much because it was not a period show, but it pulls in the history of Whitechapel in such a way that it gives the best of both worlds.

3697771,4,B001MDI9I4,I'd put this show somewhere below Sherlock but above your average law and order show. Well thought out and written. The second season goes down hill however. It makes the London police look like a bunch silly nannys.,1377820800,,216,4.7105263157894735
3697772,3,B001MDI9I4,"Well scripted episodes focus on a Jack the Ripper copy cat series of crimes.  Acting and scripts are all well done, but this theme is still grisly.  Plus, there's no humor, nor softer scenes with girlfriends or wives:  just relentless battle of cops vs. detectives competing to solve these grisly crimes, so not working well as a team.  Older Sgt. is a local who adds warmth as well as an East Ender point of view; top DCI is a posh bloke who demands more professionalism.  He has the interesting edge of being obsessive/compulsive, but this seems like an homage to USA TV detective character Monk.",1377388800,3,598,4.6571428571428575

3697797,1,B001MDI9I4,"I watched the first series and it was horrible in my opinion:  the acting was terrible (especially the actor playing the older seasoned detective), the storyline was rehashed from countless other movies and books, and whoever made the decision to insert jerky camera movements and gimmicky ""special effects"" that do nothing for advancing the story or even make sense should never get to work on a TV series again.  Everything was a clich, including the red herring of the ""Ripperologist"" and the detectives' use of flashlights when entering the killer's apartment in broad day light. Seriously? No one thought to turn on the lights?  Arrgh. Also, the total incompetence and disdain of the higher-ups were ludicrous as well as the fact that DI Chandler didn't seem to be getting additional help and manpower once the press got a hold of the story and a ""public panic"" ensued and ""the commissioner was under great pressure"". I rolled my eyes so many times that I decided to pass on series 2 and 3.
There are many great British crime TV series but this is not one of them. I suggest you watch Ripper Street or The Fall instead, for example.",1374969600,12,1137,4.732323232323233

The murders create a lot of pressure for a solution and the relationship between the newly appointed DCI and the group of experienced detectives he is charged with leading is also fraught with tension.

3697829,5,B001MDI9I4,"I admit it. I enjoy most Ripper fiction, even when it's shabbily made. Fortunately, Whitechapel went above and beyond my expectations. I thought the characters were decent, realistic people who were forced into a genuine life and death drama. If they succeed, they can stop a modern day serial killer copycat, a Jack the Ripper reenactor.

This 3-part series focuses on the crimes themselves and on attempts to catch the killer. Background stories are minimal, but enough hints are dropped to provide an impression of realism for the characters. The story proceeds nicely, with enough complications to keep the final outcome uncertain. The acting, directing, and style are all good. And as is the case with most British television series, the writers assume each person in the audience has a brain--something I appreciate.

If you like Jack the Ripper stories, if you like police procedurals--hell, if you just like British dramatic television, give this series a try. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.",1370390400,,1008,5.177914110429448

The duo is joined by an eccentric writer and Ripperist historian, who joins the department as a researcher in later episodes. I enjoyed all three seasons and am looking forward to more.",1370390400,,558,5.2

3697832,4,B001MDI9I4,Interesting British series.  Has a raw detective inspector newly assigned to a high profile murder that turns into a Jack-the-Ripper copycat serial killer hunt.  Failures occur at every turn but you still think he and his team succeed.,1369872000,,235,5.157894736842105

3697834,5,B001MDI9I4,Penry-Jones was initially a weak character but not untypical within the structure of the Metropolitan Police Force. As the character was fleshed out he became more complex and sympathetic. The series has a very strong cast in depth and develops well due in part to a meaty script.,1369526400,,280,4.854166666666667

I know the series starts out with a case involving a Jack-the-Ripper copy cat murderer, by it's very nature a very violent scenario, but that doesn't mean you have to actually show mutilated bodies.

So, two detectives can't take down this bad guy?  Even with one of them standing behind him (hint, hint cop, break a vase over his head).  In all fairness to the writers, it DOES play in very well with the concept of recreating some of the most sensational true crimes in Britain and I love the attempt to keep it pretty accurate.",1367366400,,475,4.363636363636363

3697863,5,B001MDI9I4,"I love the way the Brits use the time needed to tell the story.  We Americans have gotten used to our mysteries wrapping up in the allotted 43 minutes. Not much time to develop characters or side plots. Rupert Penry-Jones does a great job as an detective inspector with OCD, placed in the Whitechapel area (Jack the Ripper territory). His supporting actors play well against him and the plot lines for each episode have often kept me guessing until the very last frame! Great series!",1366156800,,483,4.682352941176471

3697870,5,B001MDI9I4,I loved it. Being interested in anything ripper it was great how they mixed pictures from the original killings into the series.  Also there was much more speculated info involved that made it fascinating and interesting that I had never heard before.  The conflict turned comraderie between the two lead characters was stimulating and made for much of the fondness of the series.  I will definately buy this season whether through Amazon Prime or dvd.,1364601600,,452,5.0
3697871,5,B001MDI9I4,Again not for children. Left me wanting to see the next season. Rupert Penry-Jones plays an OCD detective and does it very well. Saw him first in MI5 and this is a completely different character. Show uses history to help solve crimes.,1364601600,,235,4.619047619047619

Great characters and acting, decent writing -- but the attempt at giving it edge and ""slickness,"" like ""Sherlock"", just don't work.

This one has a very good cast as well as the age-old conflict between the up-and-coming well-educated policeman who is anxious to prove himself and his rough and surly underlings - old hands at solving crimes and filled with disdain for their new leader.  It has moments of gore, so be warned.
Perhaps my only criticism is that when you stream this, you can't get subtitles - which I desperately need when I'm watching British tv series or movies where many of the characters are not graduates of English public schools.",1361232000,,578,4.6568627450980395

The fast zig zaggy photography I found to be annoying, literally made me sick, and I found distracting and took away from the story.  I think I understand the reason they used it (simulate the killer's perspective) from it took from the story and added nothing to do, for me anyways.

I found the characters, their relationships and the building of these over the three shows to be believable and added to the show's procedural format.  The acting was very good on the part of the main characters and the counter-balance between the lead DCI and his foil was great.

Seasons 1 and 2 are only 3 episodes long, which I wanted more of. Season 3 has 6 episodes which is much better. It's one of those shows that you want to watch over. It's pretty fast paced and you can easily miss things. I watched the first episode through Amazon Instant Video and ended up watching Season 1, 2 and 3 over one weekend.

3697922,5,B001MDI9I4,"I wasn't sure what to expect from this series, but I was specifically in the mood for British crime drama. What I found was great performances and crackling dialogue. The mystery itself is compelling - someone in modern day London is copying Jack the Ripper's killings. What really makes this series great, though, is the relationships that develop between the characters, who are very well-rounded, real people. Even the minor characters seem like real human beings. The rapport between Chandler (Rupert Penry-Jones) and Miles (Phil Davis) is hard won but well worth it, as their interactions are both humorous and sometimes very moving. The series is actually very dark, but has moments of hilarity where the drama and tension lighten and this gives it good balance. Once the (only three!) episodes were finished, I was delighted to find that there were an additional two seasons to enjoy. Highly recommended.",1359504000,3,911,5.120805369127517

3697940,4,B001MDI9I4,"I purchased this show thinking it was something else and I'm glad I made the mistake! I ended up buying the remaining episodes and powering through them over the course of a weekend. It's a great murder mystery and that manages to get a bit creepy at times. If you enjoy watching British television, this is a must see. Spend the $1.99. If you like it, purchase the season.",1346630400,,373,4.420289855072464
3697941,3,B001MDI9I4,"After enjoying ""life on mars"" and ""wire in the blood"", I thought I would enjoy this series. Maybe I cannot appreciate the ""style"" glorified in the other reviews, but the plot was pretty boring. A usual plot about a clean-cut high-rank by-the-book officer (DI) who has just been assigned to manage a bunch of slobs, in a dirty messy office, trying to catch a ""sophisticated"" serial killer. Sounds familiar? I did not find any sort of sophistication in the killer, the expert, the DI, or any of the wittiness/charm/charisma I expected from the detectives. Maybe it gets better, but think I'll spend my $1.99 somewhere else..",1345334400,,622,4.877358490566038

3697943,5,B001MDI9I4,I enjoy a good English detective story with all the nuances of social class and eccentric down to earth detectives combined with creative plots. I thoroughly enjoyed this series. I just with season two was available.,1343952000,,216,5.027777777777778
3697944,5,B001MDI9I4,"First, I've only seen the first three episodes available here on Amazon Instant Video. Second, I watched this show with my Mom who has actually taken the Jack the Ripper tour in England. She kept commenting ""been there"" and ""that's exactly how it looks"".  She also informed me that you can only take the tour at night.

The cinematography works well with the gruesomeness of the story and I was pleasantly surprised that I didn't figure out who ""jack"" was before he was discovered in the script. The story is well written with many interesting ""Ripper"" facts and theories worked into the plot.  The characters are well acted and their stories add more to the show's plotline. The downside is that only the first three episodes are available on Amazon and after they are over you want more.  These episodes are the entire plot for the ""Ripper"" case so your not left hanging. However, I want to see the rest of the episodes and see how the characters play out.  An internet search did tell me that iTV continued the series after BBC. Hopefully the next episodes will be available soon.",1342569600,,1083,4.649214659685864
3697945,4,B001MDI9I4,"Okay, so the first ""season"", the three episodes focusing on Jack the Ripper, is very good. Very intriguing, well acted and scripted. Just when you think there can be no new take on JTR, leave it to these guys to make something new and enthralling. I can't add much to what has been said here, I really enjoyed this show and it deserves the 4 star and 5 star ratings it has. My rating is for this first season only.

The subsequent ""seasons"" of which I believe their are 2 or 3 were pure garbage. Overacting, ludicrous story lines, implausible situations. It's like some yahoos bought the rights after the first season and hired some teenage creative writing students to do the subsequent seasons. There are some interesting horror-artsy cut scenes played over and over but overall, it's crap. I watched them all to see if the magic of the first would come back. It never did. 1 star for the rest of the seasons.",1340236800,,911,4.5212121212121215
3697946,5,B001MDI9I4,"I have been a fan of Rupert Penry-Jones since watching his performance in Persuasion where he played the dashing Captain Frederick Wentworth. In Whitechapel though, Penry-Jones finds himself playing a very different role indeed. He is still dashing, and smartly-dressed in Savile Row suits, but his rank as a newly-minted DI on the fast track inadvertently places him on a case that turns out to be a serial murder mimicking the gruesome crimes of Jack the Ripper.

DI Joseph Chandler is being groomed for the HQ and as part of this training, is expected to pay his dues with a brief stint as a DI on a case that initially appears to be open and shut. The DI finds himself in unfamiliar territory and is looked upon with derision by the cynical DS Ray Miles (Phil Davis) and the other members of the team. The series is broken up into three episodes and each episode sees the team puzzling out the case which gets even more complicated when the team realizes that this is indeed a copycat killing of the Jack the Ripper murders, which means more victims will be targeted soon enough.

Over the course of the three episodes, DS Miles and the other team members come to a grudging acceptance of DI Chandler and even accord him some measure of respect especially when his hunches prove true. Chandler is also assisted during the course of the investigation by a self-avowed Ripperologist Edward Buchan (Steve Pemberton) who prides himself on his vast knowledge about the Ripper murders and delights in the macabre Ripper tours he conducts in London's Whitechapel district.

The show's appeal partly lies in the plausible interweaving of the past events and the parallels with the present-day crimes. Then there's the all-consuming question of the modern Ripper's identity - will reading about the past crimes yield any clues at all about the present-day murderer's identity? There's a sense of suspense throughout and the viewer is left puzzling out the case along with Chandler and his team and trying to unmask the killer. The sense of menace is palpable throughout as viewers get a view of some of the gory details of the past crimes and present.

3697955,5,B001MDI9I4,"The entire first season is excellent. Exactly what I had hoped. This is to American detective dramas what All Creatures Great and Small was to American Medical dramas.  It feels like a real investigation by people who live in real life instead of an over-acted, over technical mess like CSI.  CSI is not how crimes get solved.  This show shows how difficult crimes are solved.  Granted, most crimes are not this complex, but it is how they would be solved!

I have high hopes that this will turn into another great series of interesting crimes battled by this team of detectives.  Great stuff!",1311033600,18,593,4.70873786407767

Well played and developed characters (main character played by former MI5 actor - very well done, with other well known British actors), kept one guessing to the end, intense high action sequences, rooting for the underdog.

8321088,5,B001MDI9I4,"Recently I have found myself watching a lot of British detective shows. This show is similar to other British crime shows in that you have a detective and a side kick that are almost complete opposites. Together they put their difference aside and use those differences to solve a crime.
Often these mysteries take place over two or three shows, or one season that might last only four shows.

One of the things that is different with this show is that it has spotty odd breaks. It will have flashbacks to similar crimes in the past or to the original crime but they are oddly framed or out of focus. Sometimes this was very distracting. And yet each of these odd sections are important to the show and eventually make sense.  The description says cinematic and stylish and they mean it.

The characters have their own lives, having babies, getting divorced, dating and so on. They were likable and interesting.

This is a very dark show. It starts with a Jack the Ripper copy cat murder and then it moves on from there. An escaped Insane Asylum inmate and so on. This is not something that I would classify as a family show. But it is well written and interesting.",1518652800,,1165,4.533333333333333
