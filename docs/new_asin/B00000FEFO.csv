8236034,1,B00000FEFO,Not satisfied. THE VHS did not come to me in mint condition as stated. This movie has snowflakes; can't view movie clearly. I have DVD;wanted the 80s;90s angel force. Not the same movie. It will take more in postage to return it. Not worth it. I hope to find the Ninja warriors movie Angel Force.(adults only),1361059200,,309,4.535714285714286
