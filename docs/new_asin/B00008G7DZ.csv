8503936,1,B00008G7DZ,"Without the endearing southern dialect that I remember from the 1950's radio program, the story becomes stupid and uninteresting. It would be like doing a story of the lives of hillbillies and having them speaking in the accent of the formal ""Queen's English."" I attempted to watch this on Amazon Prime. I would not have this trash even If it were given me.",1508803200,,357,4.682539682539683

8503938,4,B00008G7DZ,"This is one of the most unique versions of ""A Christmas Carol"" that I've ever seen.  It's story line is one of the most far removed from the original story, too.

The ""Scrooge"" in this version is a landlord named Brer Fox.  Brer Fox abuses the other animals in his neighborhood, so Brer Rabbit gets some of his animal friends together to try to persuade Brer Fox to be nice, by pretending to be the Ghosts of Brer Wolf, as well as of Christmas.  Brer Rabbit and his cohorts catch Brer Fox in bed, and he uses hand shadows and an assumed voice to convince Brer Fox that he is Brer Wolf.  He also creates a fake ghost with a large cross, a jack-o'-lantern for a head, a sheet, and a cord with which to control the whole contraption, as if it were a marionette.

At one point during this extended ruse, four small animals each lift a leg of Brer Fox's bed in unison, creating the illusion that his bed is being elevated with him under the covers on it.

One of them suddenly needs to do something, so Brer Rabbit jumps in to switch places, then they switch back.

Meanwhile, Brer Bear, whom Brer Fox has abused, has observed the invasion of Brer Fox's home, so he arms himself with a club in order to save his abusive neighbor, even though he's been the object of Brer Fox's abuse!  An exemplary case of ""turning the other cheek"" and being your ""brother's keeper""!

This is one of the strangest, yet most intriguing versions of ""A Christmas Carol"" I've ever seen!",1231891200,3,1460,4.354243542435424
