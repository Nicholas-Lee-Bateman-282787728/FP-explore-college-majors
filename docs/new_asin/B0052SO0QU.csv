4530876,5,B0052SO0QU,"As an 11 year old at the time The Man in the Net, came out 1959, I saw it twice on Canadian TV (CJIC/ CBC)in Black & White. I haven't seen this movie in 50 years! It was a creepy fun movie for an 11 year old back in 1960. I have to add it to my collection.",1376352000,2,256,3.4310344827586206
4530877,3,B0052SO0QU,"Nothing especially wrong with the story...it's a frame-up in a style most modern film viewers could enjoy, but it's so over-the-top with melodrama and see-it-coming scene pacing that what could have been a whiz-bang of a drama ends up being a plod through a get-to-the-point sea of procedural scandal and hassle. If you don't want a rundown of the plot, you can stop reading here. The set-up involves Alan Ladd as an artist...a painter. Not shockingly, he plays a man of few words with a flat affect. He's shown as friendly with a particular set of kids (as portrayed in the film, it would be regarded with open suspicion in today's climate... and by the way none of the kids speaks clearly so you can't understand about 70% of what they say.) But he's a hard-working artist who happens to paint in every known style... and prolifically with what appears to be about 50-75 complete canvasses scattered about the house and barn. Immediately and very negatively, it is established that he is not liked in the community and that his nut-case secret-drunk wife is, conversely, very popular.
Yeah, so it's tough to watch a nasty drunk woman make a fool of herself and her husband, but when she turns up missing and is presumed, then confirmed murdered, you've got to go through the whole hick-town witch-hunt routine. The troop of kids he's buddy-buddy with that you can't understand, all help him to save his bacon. Worth watching if you have an Alan Ladd jones, and if you're looking for a good script to do a remake. As a form of entertainment, I'd say you can do better.",1365724800,4,1569,4.667870036101083
4530878,4,B0052SO0QU,"As a growing Alan Ladd fan , this marks the third picture i deliberately watched which headlined the fine actor . The first was SHANE . I was hooked right there and then . Next was BOTANY BAY , which i've written of elsewhere . The brilliant thing about this third outing is Carolyn Jones . My wife tells me the actress portrayed Morticia Addams in coming years . This 1959 film features a truly stunning peformance by Ms. Jones as a mentally unstable woman wed to a painter and artist (Mr. Ladd) . If you are familiar with folk who suffer from disorders such as bipolarism and/or alcoholism , you'll undestand just how stikingly well Ms. Jones both captues and conveys the emotions and actions of such a person . The whole cast is terrific , including a bunch of rather young child actors who's faces you're apt to recognize from various film and television projects of yor . See this film if you can . it's a keeper .",1341705600,9,919,4.380116959064328

She was wonderful in every role she played. She is very dramatic in this role of a woman who is the wife of a man who goes missing after they argue.",1515801600,,441,4.4875

8454333,4,B0052SO0QU,This is a great movie starring Alan Ladd.  I watched this movie about 30 years ago and was really happy to find it again on Amazon.  It was well worth the $2.99 rental fee.  Its a murder mystery with a side kick which includes four children who help Alan Ladd try to prove his innocence.  Alan Ladd plays a quiet and reserved artist with a wife that wants money and excitement.  Loved it again.,1395878400,2,394,4.27027027027027
8454334,5,B0052SO0QU,This movie was made near where I live in Connecticut and it was great to see all the old house that I know in the movie. The show wasn't as action filled and fulll of all the latest day effects but it was still very enjoyable to watch.,1395100800,,235,3.9166666666666665
