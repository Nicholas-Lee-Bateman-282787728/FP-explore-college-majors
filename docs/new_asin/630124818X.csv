It was recorded on Long Island (yes, for some reason they taped them in front of a bunch of ""yankees"").  If you love the ""real"" 38Special (read Carlisi,Barnes,2 drummers and girls singing backup) you should love this tape.  Reviews here indicate the Live concert from Sturgis has syncronization problems (if it is what was brodcast on TV New Years Eve '00-'01 I believe it)  NONE HERE!  Some neat effects with 5 or 6 frames at the bottom of the screen, like in a producer's chair, showing what different cameras are taping while displaying one of them at a time in the main part of the screen. (This effect only on a song or 2.) Great shots of the 2 drummers in sync with each other (and sometimes doing different things).  Great shots of Jeff Carlisi playing as well as Don Barnes, with Donnie running all over.  Shots of the girls OOOOHing and AAAHHHing in the background and a peek Larry hanging out on Bass. I'm hoping this title will come out on DVD so I won't be able to wear it out. (I do watch and listen to other things though.) It'll really cheer you up if you are a fan of the original lineup.  If you've come to know them since ""Second Chance"" made the charts, you need to see this.  If you've known them longer you gotta have this.",1010102400,7,1325,4.357723577235772
