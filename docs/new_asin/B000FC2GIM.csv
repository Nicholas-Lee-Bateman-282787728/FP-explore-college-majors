8120671,5,B000FC2GIM,"The Dart was a damn good car.  It really was.  It was a beautiful streamlined Chrylser that was light and lithe; it had a slant 6 engine and had a good track record on the road.

This film treats readers to the history of some really cool Chryslers like the Dart and its sister, the Plymouth Valiant and cousin, the Plymouth Roadrunner.  Viewers will no doubt see just what a damn good car that Dart really was!",1165449600,,411,4.298701298701299
