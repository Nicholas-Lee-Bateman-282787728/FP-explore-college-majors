746336,2,6303974635,"Wild Side was an odd mix of thriller, noirish mystery, crime drama, and sex-movie.  We get to see Christopher Walken once again parade around as a megalomaniacal nutcase, somewhat out of place in this movie, and with a bad  hairdo to boot.  The then-budding young actress Anne Heche plays the lead  role of a Bank Clerk by day, Prostitute by night.  The plot gets slightly  confusing and contradictory, but the acting is pretty decent, and the plot,  despite its faults, is somewhat clever.  Not too bad for a movie who's sole  claim to fame is Anne Heche's steamy lesbian sex scene with famous bisexual  actress Joan Chen.",916099200,2,623,4.738317757009346

746520,3,6303974635,"I have seen this movie several times and was fortunate to have also viewed the original uncut VHS version. Firstly, I agree that cutting the lesbian love-making scene between Anne Heche and Joan Chen has unfortunately resulted in misleading the audience and obstructing our understanding of the story and the characters. It is patently absurd to cut the lesbian scene while at the same time keeping all the homosexual shenanigans and innuendos between Walken and Bauer. Actually, the story has a really interesting plot line, with each person delicately trying to manipulate the other while pursuing their own secret agendas. I am a fan of Christopher Walken, but the years have not been kind to his performance. On the other hand, both Anne Heche and Joan Chen are more than competent. The story should really have pivoted on their relationship, but with the cuts Walken's theatrics steal too much attention. The movie has potential. Hopefully we will one day see a remake.",1378080000,,974,5.018518518518518

746607,2,6303974635,"Boy am I sorry that I bought this version.  I had no idea that so much of it was cut that the story barely makes sense.  The characters seem incomplete, some of the best scenes are simply not there, and you get little sense of the geography in which they are operating.  Who on Earth would have produced this incomplete version?  Who would ever want it this way?  Incredible.

As for the acting, Walken and Chen save it, but only to a degree (i.e. not a one-star rating).  They are both accomplished actors who can evoke entire personalities and environments in simple gestures and body language, and their characters appear reasonably complete.  However, the script is so poor that not even they can get beyond it and so much of it comes off as making less than cogent sense.  Heche, unfortunately, is pretty bad, for the most part failing to achieve a coherent and believable character.  She is quirkily beautiful and has her moments in the film, but doesn't quite pull it off in a manner of speaking.  OK, she is an ambitious young banker in debt to a corrupt boss and she decides to moonlight as a hooker.  Steven Bauer is also pretty bad as her dirty-cop  antagonist.

The plot is also badly uneven.  Not only is there no clever secret to discover - no subtle double entendres or a hidden pattern revealed later - but the sudden transitions of the characters identities make no sense and don't add to the plot.  Thus, Heche and Chen ""discover"" they are in love - it's just there to titilate and comes off as unbelievable and kind of stupid.

Not recommended.",1242172800,8,1563,4.544802867383512

It's still there, but shorter with less action and ultimately, less impact.

Christopher Walken gives an over the top performance that ends up being hilarious.  Anne Heche is a banker by day and an escort by night and plays the part well.  She and Joan Chen, who plays the wife of Walken's character, make for some nice eye candy in this film, and as I metioned are pretty much the reason for watching it.  The director, Donald Cammell apparently committed suicide over the stripped version of this film that was released.  The director's cut is supposedly available overseas.  One can only imagine what the director's original vision of this film was after seeing this version.

The plot is presposterous, the best scene - and truly a great laugh - is in the hotel room: gun-wielding, condomed  Walken in aforementioned get-up, bending undercover cop chauffeur over sofa, screaming prostitute Heche,  walked in on by Chen who looks at Walken and says ""whore""  His line:  ""It's not what it looks like.....I can't believe I'm paying for this""",1128816000,,699,4.88135593220339

746750,4,6303974635,"The provocative Anne Heche made a reputation in Hollywood due to her affairs with high profile comedians on her climb to the top.  Few know that Heche was briefly Steve Martin's girlfiend before she was Ellen's, and despite her evident ability and attractiveness, a certain pall fell over her persona, as a real life heartbreaker (even before Ellen).  She has hence been cast generally as a heavy, if not fem-lesbian, and even a twisted type.
All of which makes her heady performance in Wild Side the more exciting.  As the reviews tell you, the film is uneven.  Yet, it has moments of brilliance from all the players.  Walken is wickedly funny in his absurd role, Bauer is often convincing, and Chen is her usual, magnificent self.
But Heche carries the film.  The brief post-rape phone call scene on the kitchen counter is a high art, convincing
and sensitive, and she has rarely looked better than in the brocade (did I get the spelling?) kimono she wears in the following scenes.
But, it is the romance with Chen that is worth the price of the disc (although any cuts other than the director's should be universally outlawed on DVD, at least). Let's face it, these women are gorgeous, and even better together, au natural.  As close as mainstream Hollywood has gotten (or may ever get) to XXX sex.  But, the power of the justly celebrated scene arises from Heche's elegant portrayal of her character's seduction.  The film will probably endure, despite its many flaws, as the most revealing testimony to her notable, if not major, talent. Sexy and worth watching.",1076544000,18,1567,4.795539033457249
746751,1,6303974635,"This is probably one of the worst films I have ever seen. The reviewer that called this movie a masterpiece must have been on a high dose of Ecstasy when he saw it. With that being said, this is one of Christpher Walkens greatest performances. I love Walken, in fact I own brutal movies like this one, Day of Atonement, etc because he is in them and is freaking great.
The movie is about a banker who is played by Ann Heche who is banking one day and then just decides to be a hooker. She then meets Walken who plays a pimp named Bruno who is always in robes and wild clothes  and usually has a Cuban cigar and a drink in his hand. She meets Joan Chen an associate of Walkens who she takes out to one meal and then they become lesbian lovers. (I know, this movie is totally brutal, but if you like Walken, its a must see.)
This movie also features Steven Baur who plays a Cuban undercover fed. Its interesting because there seems to be no difference at all in this character and Manny from Scarface. Is Baur such a poor actor that he can only play a Cuban? Whats up with that mane?
Chistopher Walken is totally classic in this movie, at times it almost seems like the director of this film let him just do whatever he wanted because Walken is so outrageous in this movie, it really looked like he had a lot of fun playing a pimp. The scene where he tries to teach Baur a lesson for sleeping with one of his hoe's is totally classic. And the film peaks with a classic line from Walken before he smokes his disloyal body gaurd ""You said you'd take a bullet for me, take 3.""
All in all, this is a very, very poor movie, don't say I didn't warn you. But if you collect Walken scenes like fine wine, add this to your collection. Just try to get it as cheap as possible, because like I said, this movie is BRUTALLY poor.",1072224000,2,1814,4.153409090909091

What a shame that one wonderful scene can't be transplanted into a film with a better plot.
DON'T BUY THIS FILM; RENT IT. Once you slip it into your VCR, unless you particularly like heterosexual kitchen counter-top get-togethers or you're dying to see Chris Walken suffer through a bad hair day, fast forward about 38 minutes into the film, where you can watch Anne Heche and Joan Chen do lunch in a cool restaurant, drive around in a convertible, and indulge in an impromptu--and surprisingly beautiful--adult dessert in a seaside cabin.

746846,1,6303974635,"How DISGUSTING that this film has been put out in its awful BUTCHERED version, the one Donald Cammell took his name off, just to capitalize on the recent big public Lesbian love-affair of Anne Heche and Ellen De Generais. This is the version that has been showing up on lists of the worst films ever made, BOMBS, etc., and needs to be thrown on the trash heap where it belongs. And if that weren't enough of a disgrace and insult to Cammell's artistic vision, the Full-Screen Only specification should clue you in to what kind of charlatans you're dealing with here. You should know for your own good that people are just trying to take your money and run when they offer only a full-screen version on a DVD!
Fortunately, through the efforts of some of Cammell's friends we now have the original version which should be put out on a good DVD as soon as possible. In fact, I just saw (at the American Cinemateque in Hollywood)a pristine print of that ORIGINAL DIRECTOR'S CUT, meticulously reconstructed by Frank Mazzolla, Cammell's editor, from detailed notes Cammell left right before he shot himself, and was COMPLETELY BLOWN AWAY by it (no pun intended). I haven't laughed so hard and been thoroughly fascinated at the same time for a long, long time. The great, very long, leisurely paced and quite erotic Lesbian scene between Anne Heche and Joan Chen is maybe the least of the original film's virtues. Cammell's vision seamlessly puts together amazing cinematography, hilarious farce, off-kilter dialogue that goes everywhere you don't expect it to, virtuoso editing, and above all, the semi-improvised performances of their careers from the three main leads (Anne Heche, Christopher Walken, Steven Bauer), into a near-masterpiece that only a talentless producer could've ever turned into a 'bomb,' a film, that in the final analysis, can hold its own against ""Performance,"" and ""White of the Eye"" (the two mind-blowers that made Cammell a living legend, albeit one who couldn't find work!).
You might ask who's Steven Bauer? Steven Bauer is the guy who's mostly known for having played Al Pacino/Tony Montana's brother in De Palma's ""Scarface."" Now you know EXACTLY who he is, because he was so excellent in ""Scarface"" that people always wonder what happened to the guy! Well, he's done quite a lot of mediocre stuff just to keep working, but when given the chance, as here, under Cammell's direction, he's done truly exceptional work. The scene where Bauer has to 'bend over' to prove his loyalty to Christopher Walken and has his underwear torn off, with a non-chalant Anne Heche in the room amused by the goings-ons, is maybe one of the two or three most hilarious, daring, pulling-out-all-the-stops, semi-improvised virtuoso acting scenes in recent cinematic memory. This film will yet have its day!",996796800,71,2809,4.9787234042553195
746847,4,6303974635,"IMHO, this movie contains one of the most priceless moments ever graced the silver screen:  Anne Heche is sitting on Christopher Walken's lap, who is trying to demonstrate to her how to seduce a woman, says -- with the straightest face possible, of course -- to her: ""Imagine, I've got eyelashes, right?""  Then the two just stare at each other.
I just couldn't stop laughing.  It was so precious I felt for sure if this moment had a physical shape, it must be warm, furry, and very pettable!
Seriously though, this feels very much like a Christopher Walken kinda movie.  It's just so odd, so off-beat, so eccentric -- just so weird!  It at first makes you believe it actually has a serious plot: banker-by-day/callgirl-by-night Alex (Anne Heche) gets herself tangled in a web with a money launderer Bruno (Walken), falls in love with his wife Virginia (Joan Chen), while trying to outwit an undercover cop who's also a rapist.  But then everything just starts to get weird.  I can't quite explain it: the plot is not discarded (this is not a porn movie), but later it just feels like the plot is constructed to build up these ""moments"" for the viewers to savor.  Such as one I described above; or an extended sequence where Bruno tries to get justice for Alex (one of the most outrageous events I have ever seen in a movie); or the ""enigmatic"" ending (one of those things where you go ""hmm, that must have meant something -- but damned if I know!"").  This is certainly not everybody's cup of tea, but if you like Christopher Walken and his style of stuff, this is just perfect.
But of course, the star of this movie is actually the gorgeous Anne Heche.  Looking at her must make every straight man sigh -- what a tragic loss for mankind! =)  Also, the chemistry between her and Joan Chen is just magnificent: finally, somebody getting this lesbian seduction business right!  To watch the scene of their first kiss is like witnessing magic -- you know they are acting, but it sure doesn't look like it.  To watch their love scene, a fire extinguisher might be necessary -- your TV could catch fire because it's that hot.  I'm absolutely not kidding.
The ending is weird.  But fear not, it's a happy lesbian ending, with Anne Heche looking as handsome as can be in a white shirt and a hat, and Joan Chen happily chewing on an apple with Anne's arm around her.  Now, how can you beat that?",992908800,18,2386,4.539719626168225
746848,3,6303974635,"""The Wild Side"" is a good description of the tone of this film.  The whole thing is wild, erratic, and ultimately hilarious in its pace, plot, and casting.  Anne Heche, a banker, becomes a call girl for reasons never fully explained, but the reasons are ultimately unimportant.  After attracting the attention of a client (Christopher Walken), she meets his girlfriend (Joan Chen) and the rest is soft-core history.  Although the sex scenes between Chen and Heche were erotic, they weren't believable as being in love.  But even they weren't as odd a couple as Chen and Walken, who cracked me up every scene they shared.  Walken's psychotic, rapist driver has no redeeming qualities at all, and I enjoyed watching Walken screw him over.  As usual, Walken manages to impress in a horribly written role.  Heche is given the most (acting) meat to chew, but she is unimpressive.  Chen is given little to do other than cry and be sexy, which she accomplishes.  The relationship between Heche and Chen is ultimately unsatisfying because it is not developed.",983491200,,1051,4.920454545454546

I also agree with the previous  reviewer who felt that the lesbian scenes were tastefully filmed and  resembled real lesbian sex.  I think Anne Heche may have had something to  do with that.  Being a lesbian herself she may have been given free reign  by the director to direct the love scene with Joan Chen and get the job  done right!  After all they go to experts on World War II to film scenes  about the World War II, they go to experts on Drug trafficing to do film  scenes on drug trafficing!  Why not go to a lesbian to film a lesbian love  scene?  Joan Chen and Anne Heche look very charming and very sexy together.  I was glad that in the end, Anne Heche got the girl and they lived happily  ever after.  THE REST of the movie is really not worth your time.

Anne Hech and  Joan Chen did a superior job in their love scene, depicting lesbian sex.  Most actresses do not understand lesbian sex or lesbian romance and thus  misrepresent a deeply passionate act that they know nothing about.  I  haven't seen passion between two women portrayed this well in any movie  I've ever seen AND I've seen dozens of movies with lesbian characters.  Their sex scene was filmed tastefully and did not seem fake.  I would not  be surprised if Anne Heche actually had an orgasm in the scene.  Their love  scene was that realistic and convincing!  The only reason I do not give  this movie 5 stars is because of the violence and crude, brutal, criminal  behavior of the other characters in the movie.  I would like to see Anne  Heche in another movie playing a similar character in a lesbian love  affair, but make that THE FOCUS of the story instead of a sub-plot of the  story.",965606400,14,1106,4.661458333333333
