8709012,5,B00000F16A,"Do you like monster trucks and fighter jets AND you're afraid the world as we know it will cease to exist, all because of three zeros (that happened 10 years in the past)?  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the VHS you've been looking for!  Y2K Made Easy is one of the easiest to follow Y2K preparation videos out there.  I must admit that I haven't watched it... I'm sure it's great.  If you're like me you won't need to watch it because you'll have already smashed every PC and electronic anything in your house as you don't want your home appliances aiding in the uprising of the machine.  Brick over pizza is better anyway; no one actually thinks DiGiorno is delivery.

If you all believe in the Matrix and refuse to acknowledge the spoon section of your silverware drawer, this VHS has already been written into the binary that is your destiny and your destiny, my friend, will be relying on YOU to update its internal clock so it doesn't buy the farm on New Years Day in the year 2000.

What are you waiting for?  Buy this VHS (and run to Goodwill for a VCR) because you never know which of your trips back to 11:59:59 on December 31, 1999 might be the one to end the world... just because it hasn't happened any other time you were inspired to fire up the flux capacitor and travel back in time in your DMC-12, doesn't mean it won't happen the next time.",1283731200,,1357,4.357142857142857
