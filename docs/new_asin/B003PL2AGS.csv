8402017,5,B003PL2AGS,"I have a daughter and a son.  My daughter and I have struggled to be open and honest with each other for about 25 years now.  She is 41 and I am 68.  This video helped me so much understand how the relationships of mother and daughter are so complex.  It was refreshing to see the ""good"" relationships.  I have never had a good relationship with my mother and now I fight to get close to my own daughter.  I guess ""fight"" is the key word here.  It's hard to know how to do it, if you've never had a role model.  The struggle in my family went back to my great-grandmother and her daughter.  I am trying to break the cycle.  One of the things I plan to do, is share this video with my own daughter.  I enjoyed this video so much that I have sent a copy to my dearest cousin.  It runs in families.",1350345600,,795,3.962025316455696
8402018,5,B003PL2AGS,"""The Story of Mothers and Daughters"" is one of the most unique stories I
have ever seen. This was not a sappy film, but it did present a very
deep narrative. The numerous points of view present in the film allow
the viewer to understand the varying relationships mothers and daughters
can have throughout the world. The film is not out to show the ideal
relationship. Instead, it highlights the many different ways that
mothers and daughters transform throughout the years in order to
maintain their relationships with one another.

The stories told within this film are truly beautiful and while some
things that relationships encounter can be trying, the stories show that
everything can be worked through. I really got a deeper understanding of
how relationships work by watching this film. I would highly recommend it!",1276473600,,822,5.0
8402019,5,B003PL2AGS,"I really enjoyed this film. It highlighted how mother-daughter relationships can go through tremendous changes throughout the course of a lifetime. The film is extremely honest in that it does not sugar coat the mother-daughter dynamic.  Fifty unique women share their stories, giving the film a wide range of narratives, truly exemplifying the human relationships that are possible between women who are related to one another.

I thought that this was a very honest portrait of how mothers and daughters interact with one another. It was also welcoming because it was not based on the ""ideal"" relationship. It shows the ups and downs, but also presents a hopeful outlook that allows women to understand that they can work out even the most unique mother-daughter relationship. It was very encouraging and reminds viewers of how important mother-daughter relationships are - no matter what shape they may take!",1276214400,,911,5.232876712328767
