8642449,5,B00IIWEUBM,"Monsieur Leon is a beautiful film about the deceit and lies that the resistance in France had to practice in order to operate the underground railroad that smuggled Jewish people out of the country under the noses of the Germans during World War Two. Monsieur Leon is a Doctor whose deceit is so effective that even his ten year old Grandson Yvon hates him for being a 'Collabo', a French person who sides with the Germans. The two lead roles, Monsieur Leon and his Grandson, are played respectively, with class and panache, by Michel Serrault, a luminary of French cinema, and Arthur Vaughan-Whitehead, a young man who has great things in his future.",1480982400,,651,4.769911504424779
