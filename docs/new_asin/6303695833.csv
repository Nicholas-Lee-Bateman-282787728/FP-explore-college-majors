701657,5,6303695833,"Although copies of this film must be extremely rare, I felt the genius of Riefenstahl shines through... considering  the limitations of the film medium when it was produced. I was very impressed with the symbols of the  light and crystals of the film which have a very contemporary echoe to  them... a classic!!",921024000,8,311,4.830188679245283
7852696,4,6303695833,"The film is inspired - Made before Leni Riefensthal's desent into NAZI propaganda (she taught them how to goose step with effectiveness all too well - ""Triumph of the Will"" her best really worked as propaganda. ) . Genius Filmaker, the film is fabulous, one of the mountain climbing series of german films, one of the best. - However and this is important as a caution. this transfer to Video Tape sucks, it may have been nessasary as prints are very hard to find. Needs to be restored as a film and brought out as a DVD.",1448841600,,521,4.381443298969073
7852697,5,6303695833,"This is a story of love and trust and mistrust written by Leni Reifensthal. You see the results of exploitation. The situation can be related to today.

When the moon is full at night one can see a mysterious blue light coming from the mountains. For some reason this holds fascination for the young men of the town and if they are not watched carefully they will peruse the light. No matter how skilled they are they are destined to fall to their doom in this pursuit.

There is an outcast girl Junta (Leni Reifensthal) who knows the secret of the blue light. She is followed to its source and you will nave to watch to film to find out what happens.",1411257600,,651,4.327868852459017
7852698,5,6303695833,"This version of the Blue Light is practically worthless except for the serious film student

 As others have mentioned we have seen hints of how beautiful it COULD be from restored clips in ""The Wonderful, Horrible Life of LR"".

 Hopefully someone will come out with a restored DVD version soon.",1091577600,15,295,4.84
7852699,5,6303695833,"The fascinating, controversial Leni Riefenstahl displays her vast and complex skills as both filmmaker and actress in this enchanting fantasy tale of morality and emotion.  Not a great quality print, but its magic remains in tact.  Important historically, given Riefenstahl's cult status.",1080950400,12,288,5.833333333333333
7852700,4,6303695833,"Leni Riefensthal's beauty is only surpassed by the beautiful use of set and locations (the Italian/Austrian Dolomites eastern region of the alps).
The script is perhaps too complex for the average modern audience, but only if you are forcing them to go back to their Freudian schooling. Otherwise it is the story of a beautiful, if not altogether timeless legend of young men being attracted to their doom (The Blue Light of the title) on full moon nights - when it seems only the outcast Junta (Leni) can achieve it unharmed.
This is one of those 'mountain films' that Germany specialized in. Being shot in 1932 (1 year before the Nazi's ascension to political power) it is also the genre at its purest form. Leni Riefenstahl shines at too many levels to be described at length here. But the whole aura of myth about the outcast does not seem to make of her an ideological artist(not a Nazi one at that in 1932, certainly), it does seem to make her a mastermind in dominating light and shadow.
It is only a pity that this film's superlative cinematography has been so poorly translated into the VHS edition. Hope I'm not being sacrilegious if I recommend the german VHS edition available also at amazon.de
In any case I'm awaiting the DVD possibilities in all countries interested in bringing to Amazing Light this early 1930s exquisite piece of cinema",1031529600,52,1353,4.737288135593221
7852701,1,6303695833,Do not waste your money on this very bad copy of this film. We studied this in school years ago. This copy has not only been edited but the image quality is very poor. You can try to help the image quality by lowering the contrast control on your TV.,973296000,11,250,4.02
7852702,1,6303695833,"This copy is terrible, I have seen the excellent copies of this film and you can glimpse it on some  film history tapes of Europe and on the wonderful terrible life.... Documentary video that is available. Don't buy  this it will make you mad because of what has been done to it by timeless  video at times the brightness blooms allows you to see nothing! Did  timeless intentionally screw this great movie up or is this a bootleg from  the thirties. I'm never buying anything from timeless again because of the  poor standards of the company save your money wait for the version with  great audio and video it's out there,this is junk!",952732800,35,636,4.575221238938053
7852703,5,6303695833,"I must agree that the quality of this video is extremely poor, and the music is pretty hysterical.  However, the film, itself, is beautiful.  All in all, I would say it's worth the very cheap price as I'm pretty sure this  is the only version that exists on video.  Something that's been bothering  me, though --- I could have sworn I'd seen clips from this with synched  dialogue --- and it is from the early 30's.  Did I dream this or was the  soundtrack destroyed or lost at some point?  The best things about this  film have to be the bizarre and beautiful performance by Leni and the  equally bizarre and beautiful photography.  The story, itself, is simple,  sweet, and heartfelt.",947808000,12,686,4.570247933884297
7852704,1,6303695833,"If I could give this a lower rating, I'd do it. The videotape I received was a hideously butchered version of what may once have been a remarkable film. If THIS version is the one that won the plaudits claimed for it, then  those who gave the awards must have been blind and mad. The publisher,  Timeless Video, Inc., further mutilated the film by tacking on a  ridiculously inappropriate sound track, starting with tunes from the  musical 'Gigi'! (This I could fix: I turned the sound all the way down.)  Photos on the tape's dust jacket are NOT from this film, and the dust  jacket looked nothing like the one Amazon shows for this item. Because of  the film's butchered condition, the plot made almost no sense--successive  scenes often seem unrelated. Much of the film is very hard to see due to  light flares, scratches, etc. Certainly I'll be very wary of ordering any  videos from this site again, and I'll definitely never order one published  by Timeless Videos.",946944000,14,971,4.686390532544379
7852705,5,6303695833,"I have been a fan of this film since I first saw it as a young girl in Germany in 1949.  Much of its magic lies in the black-and-white medium and the fascinating use of ""Gegenlichtaufnahmen"" (shots taken against  the light). This gives the film a mysterious quality.  The film was shot  entirely on location and contrary to a lot of stories none of the climbing  scenes were staged in a studio nor were any doubles used.  Leni  Riefenstahl, originally a dancer, was forced to take a break in her career  due to injury, and during this spell of inactivity she visited a cinema in  Berlin which showed a film by and starring Luis Trenker, a wellknown German  mountaineer and film actor.  She fell instantly in love with the mountains  she had never before visited and on the spur of the moment bought a ticket  and went to see Trenker.  Subsequently she learned to climb, and all scenes  in this film have been climbed by her personally without any climbing aids  of any sort. This information is contained in her book ""Kampf in  Schnee und Eis"" which gives her early life story and which I have in  my possession.",928886400,40,1112,4.50251256281407
