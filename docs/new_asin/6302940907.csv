Narrated by Bernard Shaw

On August 2, 1990, Iraqi tanks rumbled into the tiny oil-rich emirate of Kuwait, triggering the turmoil that would soon engulf many of the world's nations in conflict.  For the first time in a century, Arab attacked Arab, sending shock waves through the Middle East and beyond.  But the war drums had been beating for months.  And the conflict between Kuwait and Iraq had festered for years.  Were the signs ignored?  Did the White House know more than it revealed?  CNN's award-winning ""Special Reports"" team forges the global newsgathering efforts of the Cable News Network into a compelling tale of historical hatreds, diplomatic ploys and military might in the opening chapters of the War in the Gulf.  Runs approximately 90 minutes, not rated.",1155254400,,815,5.022388059701493
