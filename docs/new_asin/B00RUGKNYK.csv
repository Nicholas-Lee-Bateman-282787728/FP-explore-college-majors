6935668,4,B00RUGKNYK,"A low-budget indie film partially funded by a Kickstarter campaign, this movie was surprisingly good.  The photography was suitably Gothic, with dark, lush woods, a crumbling castle, and perpetually overcast skies to help set the proper mood.  The acting was well done, the script understated and lyrical at times.  Lara and her father cross the Iron Curtain in 1989 to travel to an abandoned castle slated for demolition.  The father, played by Stephen Rea, is working under a deadline to uncover previously unknown murals painted by an obscure painter.  Lara, played by Eleanor Tomlinson, is a troubled teenager who finds relief from the pain of a lonely childhood by cutting herself with a razor blade, hidden in her journal.  But when Lara meets the mysterious Carmilla, played by Julia Pietrucha, everything is turned upside down, secrets from her past are revealed, and a future where no one else can control her is set tantalizingly in front of her.  As others have commented, it takes awhile for the movie to find its way.  But the pace quickens during the last half of the movie, and the decision that Lara ultimately makes is never certain until the very end.  Although this movie claims to be based on 'Carmilla' by Sheridan Le Fanu, only a couple of scenes, and the names of the two female leads, are faithful to the book.  The book, for example, takes a great deal of time laying the groundwork for the budding attraction between Lara and Carmilla, whereas in the movie it is practically instantaneous.  But as long as you don't expect this film to be a faithful re-telling of the classic book by Le Fanu, instead allowing the twists and turns of the relationship between Lara and Carmilla to carry you along, you will find yourself slowly mesmerized by the dark paths that are taken.  Don't expect a lot of neck-biting, or explicit scenes of seduction!  This film takes a more psychological approach to the vampire genre, which ultimately makes the themes explored in this movie more potent and disturbing.  Too bad the original name, ""Styria"", or the later title ""The Curse of Styria"" was jettisoned in favor of ""Angels of Darkness""--how unfortunate!",1425081600,4,2165,4.879781420765028

6935670,5,B00RUGKNYK,"I always like indie horror films that do something different with the genre, because there are so many that come out these days that are just more of the same.

This film has great production design for a limited budget, and the relationship between the two lead female characters is dramatically interesting.  Plus, how can you go wrong with Stephen Rea? 5/5.",1424908800,8,360,4.790322580645161

A good European indie flick and a fresh take on the classic novel. Well, it is inspired by the novel to be honest. It was quite atmospheric and well-done especially considering their budget.

PS The American title (Angels Of Darkness) is really bad though..",1424822400,,264,4.866666666666666

6935673,4,B00RUGKNYK,"Original, beautifully rendered, and more importantly, a socially relevant reimagining of the Carmilla story hampered by budget.  I only wish they'd given Stephen Rhea more to do. Also, the title U.S. distributors have slapped on the original is a ludicrous decision.

This is the story of Carmilla. It's been done in other films. If you don't know it the premise is of a lesbian vampire slowly preying on her young victim. There's nothing to recommend this version in particular.",1436572800,,354,4.446153846153846

6935678,5,B00RUGKNYK,"This film is a very refreshing take on the vampire legends of Eastern Europe and I really enjoyed it. The acting was good and the locale was picturesque and atmospheric. The film wasn't blatantly gory or full of over-the-top scares, but it was very frightening in a subtle way.",1430611200,4,277,4.673469387755102
6935679,1,B00RUGKNYK,"Umm.. I can't even put into words how bad this movie was. I would in no way recommend it, even if free.

6935680,4,B00RUGKNYK,"Set in 1989 in the last days of Soviet dominance over East Europe, a British art scholar (vintage actor Stephen Rea) and his daughter venture into Hungary where Rea's character is keen on studying and preserving some medieval murals in a castle that has seen better days.  The daughter, Lara is an alienated and maybe even vaguely disturbed sixteen-year-old played flawlessly by Eleanor Tomlinson. Lara meets stunning Polish actress Julia Pietrucha's wildly impulsive orphan gypsy bisexual girl Carmilla who, as it turns out, seems to be a half-vampire, someone turning into a vampire but not yet quite there.  A curse hangs over the castle and the surrounding environs that is ""infecting"" several local girls around Carmilla's age.  Inevitably the curse begins to draw in Lara owing to her ambivalent attraction to Carmilla.  The old Romanian belief that a person who commits suicide becomes a vampire lies at the heart of the curse, even though this is never fully explored or accounted for, just as the story is ambiguous as to just when or even if a vampiric presence is maybe just in the victim's mind (a matter of being haunted) or there is actually a physical dimension to it as well.  Almost every frame of this movie is perfect.  The only reason I didn't give Angels of Darkness 5 stars (I gave it 4) was that I think what the script was aiming for in terms of a final supernatural explanation never gets as explored as it could have if the film had been maybe a little longer.  As it is, between the acting, the directing, the all-pervasive gray atmosphere, even the social relevance and the all-round unique strangeness of the picture it is my favorite loose adaptation of Le Fanu's classic Carmilla, an old vampire story 26 years Dracula's senior (and a central influence on Bram Stoker when he wrote Dracula).  I say ""loose"" because the Carmilla story line is really just a point of departure, even as the script attempts to update that theme in modern terms in a way that amounts to a reply.  The real villain is a mortal, the General, an oversexed brute who bullies the peasants and has his way with the area's women, especially their young girls; his chief pretension in the story's plot being that he's out to ""save"" the infected girls, which is obviously just an extension of his sexual control fantasies.  Unlike Le Fanu's original story, Carmilla's bisexuality is not treated as a sign of her depravity but instead as a reaction to her outsider status with the village and the fact that the General embodies the bitter realities of her situation long before any curse ever caught up with her.",1430006400,6,2612,4.771618625277162

6935682,5,B00RUGKNYK,"Angels of Darkness is a retelling of Carmilla by Joseph Sheridan LeFanu. The year of setting was moved from the 1800s to the early 1980s to add an extra level of tension. Most of the movie followed the original story to a tee, and the changes that were made fit in with the time period that it was placed in. If I could have ranked this movie higher, I would have.

Angels of Darkness follows the story of Lara and her meeting with Carmilla, a mysterious girl. The whole plot has interesting twists and turns that keeps the viewer watching. One plot twist that I loved was that Spielsdorf took on a more militaristic role than in the original book. You can see how this shapes his character and places him as a villain in the film piece.",1428710400,7,737,4.340579710144928

6935685,2,B00RUGKNYK,"Joseph Sheraton LaFanu's novella Carmilla is one of my favorite stories, and it's good to see an imaginative, atmospheric production of it. The acting is believable. The location photography in an apparent real Hungarian castle is interesting. The theme is intriguing. Alas, the final execution lags. Mystery and mysticism overtakes plot coherence. The individual scenes are  more interesting than the sum of its parts. It's worth a look. However, the definitive Carmilla has yet to be adapted. Vampyr, Blood & Roses, Terror in the Crypt, The Vampire Lovers, The Blood Spattered Bride, Let's Scare Jessica to Death, Meg Tilly's 1989 Carmilla, Vampires vs. Zombies, all interesting, but LaFanu deserves more.",1427587200,,707,5.427272727272728

6935687,5,B00RUGKNYK,Well made horror film....with the just the right touch of erotica without all the smut and filth.....really handled the myth of the vampire with a lot of mystique and class.  I was really hooked watching the film even though we have been OVERSATURATED with vampire films to the gills.  It could have been even more complicated towards the end but it looks like the budget didn't allow for more......the acting was very good and nothing was too clumsy or over stated......well done.  Films rarely handle the vampire myth properly....they just put a bunch of goth looking teenagers in your face and have them biting each other and talking a lot about their 'feelings'..

6935693,3,B00RUGKNYK,"Lara (Eleanor Tomlinson) and her father Dr. Hill (Stephen Rea) explore the castle of Styria before it is demolished. Dr. Hill has discovered a foundation that he claims is pre-Roman, but the plot never develops beyond that. Lara is shrouded in mystery as she draws dark figures in her book. The town and castle have their own secrets and when Lar meets/saves Carmilla (Julia Pietrucha) the mystery deepens and the film becomes more weird. About half way through, we get a pretty good idea what is happening, at least the genre of the film.

The problem with the film is that it spends a lot of time attempting to stay shrouded in mystery that it hampers the plot.  If you are still trying to figure things out after an hour with a low action film, it gets boring. Sometimes I felt like I was watching a 70's Italian horror film.
I am sure the film has a niche. I am not part of it.

6935694,4,B00RUGKNYK,"Finally, a note worthy psychological thriller/horror story that includes an almost original twist to the Vampire genre! Our story takes place in the late 80's in Cold War Hungary at a dilapidated castle set for demolition. Dr. Hill (Stephen Rea) is granted permission to rescue the murals that adorn the walls of the castle. The Dr. brings his ill daughter Lara played by (Eleanor Tomlinson) along to help and to keep an eye on her health issues. A Cold War general named Speigel played by (Jacek Lenartowicz) is in charge of the project as well as the Dr's and his daughters contact with the local villagers. Lara meets a girl named Carmilla played by (Julia Pietrucha) who was involved in a mishap with the ??? The two girls spend time together getting to know one another as the story unfolds. The story is fairly slow moving for at least the first half and the pace picks up in the second half as we learn more about who Lara, her father, Carmilla and the general really are. We see the struggles the key characters are going through to understand whats going on and to either except it or challenge it and the means they use to confront/except the effects of Lara's and Carmilla's actions. The story combines actual practices still in use today for combating the supernatural as well as the different (refreshing take on vampirism) that drives Carmilla and the methods she uses to recruit young women. The acting, writing, direction and cinematography are all very good. That said this story isn't for everyone. The pacing is slow and there is no frontal nudity (backside only) and very little cursing (again, refreshing) with little blood and or gore or CGI. This is more of the old school horror movie of the 30's to 50's with beautiful settings, mood and lighting to go along with a story/performance driven movie without all the flash.",1425168000,32,1844,4.729813664596273

8695940,4,B00RUGKNYK,"Not exactly a ""new twist"" on the vampire genre, as the story of Carmilla is twenty five years older than our old friend, Bram Stoker's Dracula (1871-72 vs 1897)...Hammer Films mauled the story fairly well in the 70s with the Karnstein trilogy, as well as mentioned in several other movies...this telling starts painfully slow, but steadily builds steam. Carmilla is a much more seductive character than Dracula...so much so the story was roundly panned in its time for its overt lesbian storyline...this movie rather cleverly fits itself into a more or less current timeline, with  Communism, the Cold War, and the opening of Warsaw Pact countries to Western scholars. It gets only three stars, however, because of its catatonic start...all in all not a bad movie...Stephen Rhea is his usual methodical self, never letting too much out at once...definitely worth the time on a slow afternoon...and it is good to see Carmilla getting some show time...after all, she was the first vampire popularized in Western literature...one thing to recommend this movie is the cinematography...the camera work is strikingly beautiful...",1467158400,5,1123,5.273743016759776

It was called Styria at the time (a waaaaay better title for it), and it looked like an interesting take on Sheridan le Fanus novella, Carmilla.  I stumbled across it on Amazon today, and Im so glad I did!  The film is moody, atmospheric, and gothic.  The production design, cinematography, sets, casting, and directing were great.  If you're a fan of old Hammer horror films, you need to see this.  Oh, and ignore the cheesy new title and poster - they don't do this film justice.

8695945,5,B00RUGKNYK,""" Carmilla""  is a legendary vampire short story written by Sheridan Le Fanu  in 1871. The vampire tale continues to inspire filmmakers to release their own version on screen today. Of the few I have viewed such as  The Vampire Lovers 1970 and Roger Vadim's Blood and Roses 1961, I have always wished the horror story to be given the attention it deserves. It is about a vampire and some directors past have gone overboard with making the film turn out to be a laughable soft porn. Yes, Carmilla wants Laura as a companion, a lover, her blood and Angels Of Darkness is unique with Stephen Rea. I was surprised by the film and it is worth viewing again.",1441324800,3,651,4.453781512605042
