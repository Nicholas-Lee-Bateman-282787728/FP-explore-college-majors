1776743,5,B00006IJJB,"This is the best one out of the 3 Spongebob DVD's. Here are the episodes on this DVD:
-Hooky: When fishing hooks are found in Bikini Bottom, Spongebob and Patrick like to ride them, but Mr. Krabs warns Spongebob and Patrick that they are dangerous, and can bring them to the land above!
-No Free Rides: When Spongebob yet again fails his boating test, Mrs. Puff gives Spongebob extra credit to get his license, so he can get out of her boating school.
-Sailor Mouth: When Spongebob finds a ""bad word"" on a dumpster, Patrick says it is a sentence enhancer. They use it often, shocking Squidward, Mr. Krabs, and Krusty Krab customers!
-Life of Crime: Mr. Krabs is found stealing many items from his friends, and Spongebob and Patrick learn that ""borrowing"" an item is okay as long as it is given back before it's missed. Patrick wants to buy a balloon, but he can't afford it. They decide to borrow the balloon, and they pop it. They can't return it now, so they run away from Bikini Bottom thinking they're criminals.
No Weenies Allowed: When Spongebob tries to get into the Salty Spitoon, the toughest club in Bikini Bottom, he is denied access because he is considered a weenie. Spongebob will do anything to get in this club, even beat up Patrick!
-Pickles: When Bubble Bass comes to the Krusty Krab, he claims that Spongebob forgot to put in pickles in his Krabby Patty. That makes him forget how to make Krabby Patties, and how to just about anything. Mr. Krabs will go to lengths to get his money maker back to the grill!
-Jellyfish Jam: When Spongebob befriends a rare jellyfish, Spongebob brings it home. The jellyfish becomes addicted to loud, rave music, and calls his jelly friends to take over Spongebob's house to party.
-The Algae's Always Greener: When Plankton is fed up with his failed attempts to take[] a Krabby Patty, he builds a machine to switch lives with people. He switches lives with Mr. Krabs to see what is like to be him.
-Gary Takes a Bath: Spongebob has to do whatever possible to get Gary to take a bath. (Unseen episode, but was aired with Shanghaied on Nicktoons TV!)
-Shanghaied: The ultra-rare, only seen on TV twice! Squidward, Patrick and Spongebob stumble upon the sunken ship of the Flying Dutchman. They are all given 3 wishes when the return an object of his. The DVD will feature all three endings!

1776765,5,B00006IJJB,"I bought this dvd for my son a few years ago because I prefer that my kids not watch a lot of commercials, especially when they are very young. The episodes are hilarious! The first episode, in which Spongebob tries to give Gary a bath is my kids' favorite and actually my favorite too. Watching SB try all the tricks we parents resort to when we are desperate to get our kids to do something just cracks me up :)  These are earlier, gentler episodes, I feel like the stories got a bit too violent for toddlers as the series went along. I have no issues with my almost 3 year old being afraid of any of these episodes. Although I can't speak to newly made copies, my copy (bought in 2009) has no annoying previews! I hate standing there pressing the skip button over and over.",1358208000,2,776,4.27891156462585

Also spongebob's friend Bubble Buddy that drives Havoc all over town.,1293062400,2,309,4.636363636363637
1776770,5,B00006IJJB,"'Sea Stories' is the most popular compilation of episodes of Nickelodeon's cartoon hit, SpongeBob Squarepants.
The VHS edition contains five episodes, all of which are insanely funny:
-""Shanghaied"", where SpongeBob and his team deal with the ghost pirate The Flying Dutchman, driving him up the walls of his patience with their nonsense.
-""Gary Takes A Bath"", an instant classic that can make many parents feel identified, as SpongeBob goes through lots of hoops in an effort to try to get his pet Gary to take a bath... the best of all the episodes!
-""Hooky"" - SpongeBob and Patrick have fun playing with the hooks from fishermen, in somewhat of a ""bungee-like"" fashion, jumping off of them before they get pulled out of the water, until SpongeBob learns his lesson.
-""Life of Crime"" - another very funny episode where SpongeBob and his 'partner in crime' Patrick run away after the ballom they borrowed (because it was ""okay to borrow things"") pops and they feel they're going to be put into jail for having stolen a baloon.
-""Pickles"", a hilarious face-to-face between SpongeBob and Bubble Bath makes him loose his self-confidence as a chef when he's accused of having forgotten to put pickles in his locally ""famous"" krabby patty.
While all the episodes contain fairly innocent humor (that parents and everyone alike will laugh to) when compared to other past cartoons (such as ""Ren and Stimpy""), I'd advice parents to stick around when your children watch SpongeBob. He can provide you with some valuable tools to get your children to understand certain things, but by the same token, he can twist some things that might later complicate matters (making certain things confusing in their minds), considering the easy way in which the kids connect to the character. All in all, far from a bad influence and very funny. The only aside: just keep an eye on the kids and talk to them about the episodes, if you feel it is appropriate.",1077321600,15,1935,4.8844984802431615
1776771,5,B00006IJJB,"If you have little ones (and big ones too) that love the yellow sponge, then this is a great addition to your collection.
It has 10 quality episodes, including my personal favorite, Sailor Mouth.  Now that is one funny episode, but back to the DVD.
Overall, 10 episodes, including Shanghaied with 3 different endings.  A music video that is really nothing more than snippets of action from other shows, video game hints and tips and they are all in full screen format.
All the characters are here, so pull up a chair, grab a Krabby Pattie and enjoy the show without hesitation matey!",1077321600,2,583,4.650485436893204
1776772,5,B00006IJJB,"Here's a list of the episodes:
Gary Takes a Bath:  4/5  Can only watch it once.
Hooky 4/5  Funny, but gets old after a while.
Life Of Crime 5/5  One of my favorites - shows how stupid Patrick is.  ""Liar, liar, plants for hire.""
Pickles 5/5  I like when Spongebob tries to remember how to make the Krabby Patty.
No Free Rides 4.5/5  Good episode
Sailor Mouth 5/5  One of my favorites.  Spongebob and Patrick learn a new word...
No Weenies Allowed 6/5  One of the best episodes.  My favorite besides the Krusty Krab Training Video.  It's really funny.
Jellyfish Jam 3/5  The jellyfish episodes just sort of annoy me.
The Alge's Always Greener 4.5/5  Funny - Plankton switches lives with Mr. Krabs.
Shanghaid 5/5  Hillarious and it comes with three different endings.
Overall, it's a great DVD.  Also, has some special features.",1076716800,20,825,4.664335664335664
1776773,5,B00006IJJB,"this dvd was so cool and is great for people who adore spongebob cause it has episodes no one has seen on it. spongebob is wonderful for anyone cause he's so awesome. there are jokes for kids, teens, adults, and even the elderly!! anyone who watches spongebob will love him!!",1057795200,2,275,4.52
1776774,5,B00006IJJB,"I purchased this for my children for Christmas, not knowing very much about Spongebob, and this DVD turned me on to the joy of Spongebob!  This one even has the episode which is now one of my favorites, called ""Sailor Mouth"".  We've watched and enjoyed this DVD many times, and I'm very glad that I bought this.  The humor is perfect for both kids AND adults.",1055721600,,359,4.409090909090909
1776775,5,B00006IJJB,"Sea Stories is the best of the SpongeBob dvds. The single best episode is ""Texas"" which is on another dvd, but Sea Stories is the best overall collection--though the other SpongeBob dvds are great. There's ""Gary Takes a Bath"" and I've found all episodes featuring Gary to be great. There's ""Hooky"" where Patrick and SpongeBob play on the hooks that come from the sky. ""Pickles"" where SpongeBob loses confidence at the Krabby Patty (and then in life). ""No Free Rides"" where SpongeBob fails his driving test (again) and hilarity starts there. ""Sailor Mouth"" which is hilarious. Also contained are ""Life of Crims"" and ""No Weenies Allowed"". The cream of the dvd is contained in another Plankton episode (""The Algae's Always Greener"") and the classic ""Jellyfish Jam"". This also has ""Shanghaied"" where Patrick, Squidward, and SpongeBob are taken by the Flying Dutchman, and this contains all three endings. Yeah, this is a great dvd, the only thing that would make it perfect would have been slipping ""Texas"" in this one.",1053216000,14,1015,5.011834319526627
1776776,5,B00006IJJB,"Aye Aye Captain! That's for sure! SpongeBob rules the seven seas. I have all the DVD's so far, and I never get tired of watching them over and over again.

1776777,5,B00006IJJB,"The reason I say that is because...well...the cover is [unimaginative]. Check out the other Spongebob DVD covers and compare. Of course, that's not important. What is important is that this DVD rules. 10 great episodes, 11 if you count the great Shanghaied with all 3 endings. You also get some tips that you don't need for the video game Revenge of the Flying Dutchman and a music video with clips from the episodes on the DVD. As usual, the episodes alone are worth buying this DVD.",1044748800,,484,4.6395348837209305

1776779,5,B00006IJJB,"This is family cartoon fun at its best. Children love the comic antics of Spongebob and his pals, and the parents will like the risq surreality of it all. The stories are well written and animated and the characters are silly but pleasant.
More special features would be welcomed, but of interest is one story with three alternative endings. This could have been improved if you didn't have to sit through the entire story to see each different ending (the endings are only the last 30 seconds - the punchline).
I was surprised that there were no subtitles for the hearing impaired, as lipreading these characters is impossible and deaf people have a right to enjoy Spongebob too!",1041984000,3,680,4.771186440677966

Hooky-Not so good. 6.5/10
No Free Rides-Pretty funny. 8/10
Sailor Mouth-Used to be my favorite episode, until I saw I Had an Accident. 10/10
Life Of Crime-An OK episode. 7.5/10
No Weenies Allowed-That was so funny, especially with Patrick being beat up while Spongebob wasn't even touching him. 9/10
Pickles-The worst episode on the DVD. Only reaches my average. 5/10
Jellyfish Jam-Wasn't horrible by any means, but after the greatness of Sailor Mouth, it seemed terribly lacking. 7/10
The Algae's Always Greener-A solid episode, but nothing memorable. 7.5/10
Shanghaied-Pretty good! Especially Squidward's ending. 8/10
Overall Rating: 78.5/100
Final thoughts: The DVD included many very good episodes, but still, none of them were better than Sailor Mouth or Gary Takes a Bath. Those were in my opinion the best episodes on the DVD. Some episodes were very good, others stunk.",1041811200,2,916,5.324137931034483
