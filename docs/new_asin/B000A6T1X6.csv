2368204,5,B000A6T1X6,"I bought this wonderful series on a whim. I adore Edwardian dramas,  and this one did not dissapoint. Louisa Leyton learns to be a chef and opens a hotel while capturing the hearts of men of all stations. Her temper and cockney accent are fabulous and make Lousia quite the character.

My only quibble is that is is in ""BBC vision"" like Upstairs Downstairs.

If you enjoy edwardian or victorian period peices, this is a wonderful series. Louisa Leyton charms the audience while she cooks up masterpeices. This is a detailed look at the life Edwardian ladies faced, and the type of people they encountered.",1130457600,,605,4.742857142857143
2368205,5,B000A6T1X6,"Just as Criterion is the gemstone of DVD product, John Hawkesworth is the prince of British serial historical drama. Every project he worked on was sublime. Duchess of Duke Street is educational, earthy,  and  engrossing. Just got my 17 year-old daughter hooked on Episode 1 alone. You learn to love and care so desperately for Louisa, Mary, Merriman, Starr, Smith-Barton, and Charlie. My only criticism is this--how dare they make me wait for series 2 !",1129161600,8,454,4.9605263157894735
2368206,5,B000A6T1X6,"This series is of the same story quality as Upstairs Doiwnstairs but of better technical quality. Enyoyed in our household for repeated viewing. Louisa is a gem of a character,fine details of the period are obvious in the sets and costumes.",1126742400,27,240,4.878048780487805
2368242,5,B000A6T1X6,"I loved The Duchess of Duke Street Season 1! If you are a fan of Downton Abbey. You will enjoy The Duchess of Duke Street.
Unfortunately, there is only ONE Season.",1512691200,,163,4.290322580645161
2368243,4,B000A6T1X6,"After watching Season 1with 15 episodes. Anxious to start Season 2 only to be informed it's not available.  ""WHAT""
. Very unhappy",1511222400,,129,4.863636363636363
2368244,1,B000A6T1X6,"Unlike the other 1-star reviewers, I liked episode 1. The video was low resolution and poor quality, but I thought the characters and story were engaging enough to overlook this. I stopped watching after episode 2 because of the corrupt motives of Louisa the assistant cook, Augustus the butler, and the Prince of Wales. Who would marry a woman who didn't love him and agree for her to become someone else's mistress? She corrupted herself for her career, her husband corrupted himself for his forlorn love, and the Prince abused his power to exercise his lusts. See my review at i_m_d_b.c_o_m (without the underlines) titled 'ambushed and disgusted by episode 2' for details.",1509926400,,676,4.991150442477876
2368245,5,B000A6T1X6,"One of the best PBS series ever!  Not a stupid fluff romance.  Well-written, witty, meaningful.  Culturally and historically accurate.  Fulfilling from emotional and literary view.",1508112000,,180,6.08
2368246,5,B000A6T1X6,Couldn't get enough of this.,1506470400,,28,4.8
2368247,5,B000A6T1X6,"Wonderful Wonderful Wonderful!! Haven't watched since first time it aired... never was offered on PBS or other. Thank you for offering..such a treat...and PLEASE bring back season 2 so we're not frustrated! I have to add...after reading several critical views concerning Gemma Jones physical appearance and her appropriateness in this role...I thought she was perfect for this leading character. I felt others were stating she wasn't pretty enough...certainly not alluring enough to be desired by Prince Edward. But she was very attractive in the style of the period. She still is. She had creamy alabaster skin, bright blue eyes, thick auburn hair, and a tiny waist. What made her most attractive was her personality and great skill as a chef. She was great fun to be with when entertaining...witty and not afraid to call it as she saw it.",1503619200,,840,5.0503597122302155
2368248,5,B000A6T1X6,love these series. the duchess was one of my favorites.,1501545600,,55,4.6
2368249,5,B000A6T1X6,"Fascinating series ! The casting was superb, and the reproduction of the manners and mores of the era. along with the furniture and clothing was exquisitely well done.
One wonders why Hollywood cannot, with all their resources, achieve the same high quality with period pieces .
There is a second season PLEASE include it in Prime viewing - soon !",1499212800,,347,4.8
2368250,4,B000A6T1X6,"I stalled watching this, thinking it would be corny and too dated. What a pleasant surprise. The low production value is annoying at first...fuzzy resolution, muffled sound, few sets, simple camera angles, unsophisticated change of scenes. But, if you occasionally return to old BBC productions, you know what to expect. The point being, a good story and fine acting. The first episode is Julia Child concoctions on steroids and altho you think you'd be bored scene after scene, you aren't. The low brownish tones make it hard to fully glory in the remarkable ""food porn"" prepared in the primitive kitchen but it is the set-up for the story. Others have commented on not buying the plain looks of Gemma Jones as a 'femme fatale"", but I disagree. For once, men seem attracted to her genuineness and a powerful sophistication inside of her low-class status. She is an unpolished stone who doesn't seek the attention of possible paramours but when she must dress up in fancy duds, looks the part. Her proper social behavior is guided by that period until she is forced to defend herself and her righteous anger is unleashed. I was slow to ""get"" the improprieties somewhat disguised in this rather puritanical production. At the same time, I was grateful to be spared modern cinematic love scenes with clothes ripping, furniture thumping and glass breaking. That said, I do wish BBC would do a new version of this fascinating story. It would be another hit and I would be helplessing streaming it.",1498867200,,1493,4.881889763779528
2368251,5,B000A6T1X6,"Delightful!  I expected to find this series a bit too slow-paced or dated (it was filmed in the 1970s), even though I usually like period dramas.  But it was unexpectedly funny, and Gemma Jones so animated the main character that I wanted to see more, more, more!

I found the second season at my local library and highly recommend it too.  The series finale choked me up, and I'm sitting here after watching it with a feeling of gratitude that I discovered this series.  Thanks, Amazon Prime, for making it available!",1498348800,,518,4.648351648351649
2368282,5,B000A6T1X6,Very long but interesting series. Hope there is another sesson..,1497139200,,64,5.5

2368284,4,B000A6T1X6,A great Historical period piece! The acting is superb. Don't expect lavish sets akin to Downton Abbey. This resembles more like a stage/play performance. But it more than makes up for that if you call it a downfall in some outstanding performances by all the cast. I am just disappointed to find out that Amazon does not have Season 2.,1490918400,,335,4.6
2368285,5,B000A6T1X6,I like these old English tv shows.,1490227200,,34,4.0

2368307,4,B000A6T1X6,"We're enjoying it in bits and pieces here and there...easy to follow and mostly pretty amusing. If you aren't quick, though, you'll have trouble following the dialogue as the Duchess talks fast and its easy to miss some of the quips. Getting fond of some of the characters.",1486598400,,273,4.708333333333333
2368308,4,B000A6T1X6,"More in a theatre style, the Dutchess of Duke Street is a wonderfully acted drama set in the early 1900s where protocol ruled the day in England. Not being English, I sometimes have difficulty understanding some of the references. But if you love Downton Abby and you are a bit of an Brit History buff, you will enjoy this series.",1486598400,,330,4.516666666666667

2368332,5,B000A6T1X6,"I'm loving the feminist themes running through the series, made in the late '70s at the height of the movement.  It's a bit stiff, but so much fun and a great relief from the hostile mania in the public sphere right now.",1486598400,,220,4.238095238095238

2368337,3,B000A6T1X6,"Obviously, the production values are not like today's TV series. That being said, there is something compelling in this show that makes me keep watching it. It is based on a real person with a colorful life among the upper crust of London. Always fodder for drama and scandal.",1486252800,,276,4.653061224489796
2368338,3,B000A6T1X6,"I would give this 5 stars, but for the fact that once I started Season 1, they stopped allowing Season 2 and now I can't finish it all. Extremely disappointing.  It's still listed there too.",1486166400,8,190,4.428571428571429

2368340,5,B000A6T1X6,"Evocative storytelling.  Classic production in the  ""Upstairs Downstairs"" tradition of British tv-series productions  I was drawn in by the characters portrayed.  I stayed because of the unflinching storyline.  The lead character is determined to succeed despite the roadblocks thrown in her way by the male-controlled 'polite society' of London at the turn of the 20th century.  The leading lady ""pulls herself by her bootstraps"" while she lifts up those around her.  This production includes many unique and interesting characters along with those we have come to appreciate from a British tv piece set in this period.  A warning to anyone who isn't already aware; the aristocracy's view and treatment of women 'in service' is appalling.  In keeping with tv series from this era, nothing vulgar appears on screen.",1486166400,2,815,5.3046875

Such great acting for a wonderful and captivating story that is more truth than not.  Main character Louisa is a throughly modern woman who fights for the right to become a chef in a man's world and then fights to keep her position and property and skills in what was still a man's world in the early 20th century.  Right down to the Hall porter's dog Fred, each character in the series engages the viewer in a totally satisfying drama.",1484697600,,540,4.414141414141414

She is a good actress, don't get me wrong. However, I believe if this woman was picked as a royal paramour, she should have a beauty to make it believable.  This role definitely calls for a beautiful and charming woman.  But the way it is written and acted, makes it hard to understand this woman's appeal. The rest of the cast does a fine job.

I gave it four stars because the way the dog was treated/handled in the series made me very uncomfortable.  He looked stressed, his leash was pulled hard when they wanted him to walk, the leash was very short for him to lay down easily, and, among other things I noticed, they gave him chocolate! Perhaps at that time people were not aware that chocolate is very bad for dogs. Other than that, as I said, it was worth watching.

Her story line is interesting but she is so harsh and as the storyline continues, she becomes even more so.  She's not a very likeable character.

The first season follows the main character's rise to fame in the early 1900's. Some history is woven in. Says it is based on a true person.",1469318400,,452,4.1477272727272725

It could have been a better exploration of the class divide and the cynical manipulation  of the title character's aspiration by the future monarch and his upper crust pimps.

2370635,3,B000A6T1X6,"Based on a true story, this Brit Soap is a rags to riches to rags to riches etc. story of a woman who starts out as a housekeeper and becomes a well known cook. Along the way she becomes mistress of a future King of England, opens a hotel etc. Quite entertaining.

One thing that's a bit annoying is aside from the open and closing themes, there is no background music, so it's like watching a play, Don't know if the series did not have any, or if it's some kind of rights issue involved with the lack of music.",1466899200,,512,4.12

It is interesting to watch the ""Dutchess"" go from learning to be a cook, to being quite a successful business woman. As with any TV show, some stories of the TV series are better than others. I enjoyed watching Ms. Jones play Louisa and 'grow' through the series. I think if you like period pieces, especially with strong women characters, you will like this. I am sorry that Amazon is not offering season 2. Thank goodness it is on YouTube to continue the saga.",1466812800,,553,4.276190476190476

You really get into the characters quickly. I have always enjoyed period dramas and comedies and this one did not disappoint.  The quality of the video I must agree with others that it is poor but not so bad that you can't enjoy at all.  I also love the fact that the dialog is shown as some of their accents are strong and you might miss what they are saying. I do hope season 2 becomes available on Prime soon.",1466812800,,548,4.1415094339622645

This was season 1 of the series. I notice there is a season 2 but it is not offered by Amazon Prime. Perhaps that is just as well because by the end of the series, I was getting rather annoyed by Louisa's attitude.

I like that, after years of watching ""Upstairs/Downstair,"" that the strict rules of society are turned on their heads by Mrs. Trotter. To the 21st century eye, especially compared to ""Downton Abbey,"" the staging will seem simplistic. However, the story is just as fascinating.

2371536,4,B000A6T1X6,"I watched this entire series when it was first run, and I'm delighted to see it again.  Like ""Upstairs, Downstairs"" and ""The Jewel in the Crown"", it set American minds up for ""Downton Abbey"" and a leisurely chance to see the British in their own environs.  To see actual servants, with back stairs and a half-day off a week--imagine!
Of course, they all slide into soap opera territory now and then, but that's part of British life too.  But ""Duchess"" is memorable for Gemma Jones and her determination, and soon Fred the terrier will join the group.  I can't recommend these series enough.",1465430400,,590,4.699029126213592

However, I love the characters and Mrs. Totter gives new meaning to the word ""spunky"".

2372102,5,B000A6T1X6,"Old school PBS/BBC production style so there is no soundtrack playing in the background, so it seems more like a play than a TV production, which did seem strange at first, but I actually grew to like it. I find at times music can be a distraction, even annoying, on some TV shows. Music is great when it is well integrated in to the show and/or relevant to the scene. In fact I've found some of my favorite tracks through shows like True Blood and Justified, but on some TV shows music can be so loud and jarring at times it ruins the scene. It is also from the 1970's so it is not an HD quality picture, but the story, which is loosely based on the real-life career of Rosa Lewis, is very interesting, especially if you like period dramas, and the writing and performances are exceptional. Unfortunately Amazon does not stream season 2, which is something I find happens too frequently, and is very annoying about Amazon PRIME streaming versus Netflix. You get invested in a show only to discover the next season is either not available or you have to pay for it. Figuring out which shows are free and which I have to pay for while searching is a big enough hassle but when I find a ""PRIME"" show I like then discover if I want to continue watching it I have to pay even more is so frustrating, and it all seems very random, I can understand if it is the current season of a show, but if a show is from previous seasons then why are some seasons free and others are not? I have even found a TV series where you have to buy the first season for but the second season is free WTF??? Although at least this way I don't get hooked on a show only to find out if I want to keep watching then I have to pay Amazon more money. The only reason I am an Amazon PRIME member is for the 2 day shipping, I would not pay exclusively for their video streaming service like I do with Netflix. The stream quality is not as good but the fact that some things are included and a lot are not is what is most annoying. Anyway I digress, so season two was not available at all, luckily I found it on YouTube so I was able to see the story through to it's conclusion.

I watched every episode of this ageless drama, a delightful display of a woman's life and personal success in Edwardian England, when women were told to just ""get married, have children, be subservient."" Gemma Jones plays the part to the hilt, giving us a delightful, determined character. In the beginning, she is a servant in a wealthy household, who manages to rise to the top. As the owner of a  hotel, she kicks out her no good husband. This is a delight, especially if you like to watch life as it was in those times.",1464307200,,603,4.583333333333333

Not only is it a telling story about the limited choices of women and one woman's drive to break the mold, but it is beautifully and interestingly shot. Although shot on video, every other part of the production value, from acting to production design, is quite high. To a contemporary eye it may seem slow-moving, but I love that the camera follows the characters in real time, so that you see how they move through the elaborate, but cumbersome environment of the time, in their equally stylish, but restrictive clothes. What's more, I love how the food and its preparation are featured. At times you almost have the feel that your watching a Victorian food show.

Plucky, intelligent and persistent, she pursues her passion for her career as a master cook, while fending off the setbacks caused by freeloading relatives and the social morays of the time. She was a feminist well before we named it that. I was glad to see this on Amazon Prime because I remembered it fondly from the 1970's.

2372868,5,B000A6T1X6,"In TV series with strong female characters, the female protagonists rarely get the best dialogue; this series is an exception.  G Jone's Louisa Trotter embodies the self-made woman who takes advantage of all the opportunities that come her way.--and who learns as she grows in a very uninhibited and public way.  Depicted as fierce, loyal, unforgiving, with a strong bent towards perfectionism, Louisa Trotter simultaneously rants and raves.  Duchess of Duke Street is everything that Mr. Selfridge, for example, isn't.  This series (Duchess of Duke St) reflects societal behavior with much more clarity and accuracy.  The entire cast is simply awesome; the bon mots and asides are great stuff--even if some of the accents make them a tad hard to catch.  Based on the set design/production values, one surmises that the producers chose to spend their money on the cast and writers, than say, Downton Abbey producers may have...and it was a great investment.",1463184000,2,957,5.181818181818182

A big problem too is that every word if very difficult to understand so you have to kind of guess what's going on. If you have any hearing loss you will be lost. You can still enjoy the scenery and authenticity of the period.
It's done in the form of a stage play which adds even more authenticity to it. The main character is really interesting in an annoying sort of way.

2373072,5,B000A6T1X6,"These days, people probably associate Gemma Jones with the Harry Potter films or Sense & Sensibility; I remember her from this series, which my BBC-loving parents watched back in the day. My own kids were drawn in by the story and main cast of characters in the early episodes (they even spotted Harry Potter's Minister of Magic, Robert Hardy,,in a guest role). Well worth a look, really a must-see for Gemma's performance alone. Loosely based on the life of Rosa Lewis, you'll get plenty of soap-opera drama along with a history lesson.

Production value isn't what we expect of a modern TV show---don't expect Downton Abbey opulence or scenery. Quality of the film transfer to streaming video is also a little dicey in spots, but it's not a deal breaker. A few of the episodes suffer because they focus too much on guest storylines.

2373258,4,B000A6T1X6,"This is for the entire series the second season of which can be found on YouTube.

Luxury hotels have always been good settings for period dramas, few better than this one. The writing and acting are first rate and feature a who's who of great British character actors most of whom are no longer with us.

Series one is an absorbing take on the Edwardian period that would seem unbelievable were it not historically accurate. So would Louisa Trotter were she not based on a legendary, real person - Rosa Lewis. My only fault was the casting of Gemma Jones in the lead role. Although her acting is impeccable her looks strain credulity as a woman acknowledged as a great beauty, which Rosa Lewis certainly was. I've attached the portrait of Rosa Lewis that hangs in the Cavendish Hotel.

Series two's focus is World War One, the shattering effect of it and its immediate legacy. Here the series becomes an ensemble drama with a wonderful collection of endearing regular characters. Again the writing and tone are near flawless. Only problem in my opinion was casting Lalla Ward as Lottie, because she cannot sing yet plays a rising singing star.

Dedicated fans of Doctor Who will notice Maureen O'Brien, the Doctor's first companion, and Lalla Ward, the best known one from the Tom Baker era. At least she isn't asked to sing in that series ;)",1462838400,7,1343,4.702127659574468

TV and movies which are full of profanity galore...I don't mind a little of it, but when every three words are the famous F---- word, I always shut it off and go to another series or Movie.
This series is very interesting, showing that even at that time, women had to fight for jobs and status.  I like this feisty "" Duchess"" very much.  She always rises above her troubles.  It's a hopeful drama.",1462752000,,539,4.459183673469388

2373813,5,B000A6T1X6,What a delightful series!! So imaginative each episode it is a pleasure. Do have a bit of a time getting through some of the heavy accents but there is not a character that arrives on the scene who is not interesting and full of surprises! I SO await being able to access the second season! Wonderful to see a young woman of spirit and ambition who is able to chart a course to her dreams despite many shoals of heartbreak to manuver.,1461801600,,434,4.304878048780488

2373835,2,B000A6T1X6,"Normally I'm a big fan of programs like these but I found this surprisingly disappointing and so I only watched the first few episodes. The production seemed especially dated, but what I mainly disliked was the oddly abrasive ""Duchess"" who was supposedly so fetching that upon first glance, royalty became smitten.  It just didn't seem believable.",1461801600,,347,5.196428571428571

2373858,4,B000A6T1X6,"I loved this season I.  The story moved enough to keep me interested, and I found that some of the episodes were almost self-contained.  But the biggest problem was the accents were so heavy and the duchess said her lines at such a fast pace that I missed about 25% of her delivery.  The strength of her character was formidable and  as is so often in real life, the strong character doesn't even realize that she is at the head of the line. I recommend this highly  to anyone who doesn't have trouble with the combination of heavy accent/fast delivery and is interested in the social position of women in the early 1900s.",1461715200,,622,4.469026548672566

2373862,5,B000A6T1X6,"The series was very well written, smart and witty. The characters were so genuine, they felt like old friends by the time I finished watching season 1. While I couldn't always agree with the ""Duchess's"" behavior, I was always entertained by her and could understand and relate to her foibles. I came away wanting more, and felt sad that this show aired in the 70's and would never be produced again.",1461715200,,399,4.633802816901408

It really gives you a glimpse of England in such an interesting era.  As the main character is learning to be a chef (NOT just a ""cook"") ... there is a LOT of food preparation in this series and I love seeing the actors get better at it as the story progresses.  =)

Highly recommended!

It's about a woman with an unusual drive: not to marriage and motherhood, but towards success and mastery of a ""man's"" skill. If I didn't know the storyline was based on true events I'd guess they wrote the part for a man, got a wild hair, then changed a few pronouns and did the show.

2374351,5,B000A6T1X6,This was an extremely appealing and engaging classic BBC series. Given the fact that it was made in the mid 1970s it didn't have nearly the production value of modern blockbusters like Downton Abbey or Orphan Black. But I the low budget sets and theater like staging reminded me of classics like Are You Being Served? and Old School Dr. Who. Gemma Jones is a delight as Louisa Trotter. She gives vulnerability and dimension to a lead character that could easily become a stereotype. Her supporting cast is camp in the best spirit of classic BBC sitcom,1461024000,,551,4.690721649484536

2374372,5,B000A6T1X6,"If you've got no objection towards a woman ruling the roost, Louisa Trotter and her flock at the Bentinck Hotel will make you feel right at home. More than just a tea party for lady viewers, The Duchess of Duke Street (Series 1) serves up a colorful cast of characters. Louisa, the strong-willed and sharp-witted hotel manager will have you dancing in consomm in one episode and have you wanting to wring her ""she-devil"" neck in the next. Merriman, the aged, gaunt, lumbering, and allergy-prone manservant always manages to find something to mumble and grumble about. His stodginess often makes him the butt of staffer's jokes. The Bentinck's short, eccentric, and most distinguished-looking doorman, Starr, happens to be joined at the hip to his trusted canine companion, Fred. It is to Fred in which Starr solely confides. Mary, young, sweet, obliging, and unassuming, is maidservant and Louisa's right-hand lady. This cast of characters and level of production graced with John Hawkesworth's magic (i.e. ""Flame Trees of Thika"", ""Adventures of Sherlock Holmes"", ""Upstairs Downstairs"", etc.) are what sets this series apart in the world of television. Well-written scripts along with adept acting and witty dialogue entertained me all the way through. Many episodes left me on the edge of my seat, unable to wait for the next one. Bloomin' grade-A entertainment that's fit to bung in anyone's player.

2374399,4,B000A6T1X6,"When first watching it, do give it a chance. If what the lives of people were like from an historical vantage point is of interest to you, this series will be enjoyable to watch. You get a glimpse of the differences in the lives of the upper (lords, ladies, etc.) and lower (butlers, cooks, housemaids, etc.) classes and the pride the lower class had in who they were. The main character, Louisa, finds a way to straddle the fence of the two classes - she's a wiley one. This season, and season 2, have humorous moments as well as sad ones. There are perplexing moments, however, where you feel like you have to ""fill in the blanks"". I don't know if that is how it was originally done or if Amazon just wasn't able to get every episode of each season, The storyline also quickly jumps through the years - once again, was that originally done or was it an inability of Amazon being able to get every episode. (Some episodes show the month and year, others don't - but you do figure out many months have passed since the previous episode.) I wish the storyline would have flowed more seamlessly and that there would have been more seasons, but it was enjoyable, especially from an historical point of view, for me. In addition, British humor IS incomparable to any other so in order to fully enjoy this show, you need to be able to understand and appreciate the wit of the British.",1424476800,,1379,4.454545454545454

I cannot believe that you would discontinue this wonderful program without any warning.  I am so disappointed that you would do such a thing.  So many people have developed an interest in that time due to the wild success of Downton Abbey and the Duchess is a series in a similar genre which would be enjoyed by many.

In many ways the costuming and scenery seemed more realistic of the time period than the glitzy and overly glamorous look of the sets and costumes in Downton Abbey.

I don't have any respect for people, no matter what time or decade, who pimp out their morals, their marriage, and their lives so they can be used as a harlot to climb the social ladder, 'using it to their own advantage'. I found it particularly disgusting that she had barely been a week married and Prince Edward came calling to use his new mistress. I stopped it at that episode when she came down the stairs to meet with her 'benefactor'. Blah..... :-x I don't care how women were treated at that time, no excuse for it, or how badly she wanted to be a chef.  And her 'dialect' what some would call 'accent' was enough to drive me up the wall, it was as bad as Eliza Doolittle from My Fair Lady, I know that's most likely how she talked but still like finger nails on a chalk board.

More clothes, more d&eacute;cor, more food and drink, but low on story line. In the end I actually ended up not liking the main character very much.

2374640,3,B000A6T1X6,"Set at the turn of the 20th century, the story starts out quite interesting but some of the following episodes, depending on the writer, do fall from expectation.  Plus there is some overacting by Gemma Jones, the main actor. Her character Louisa  can become a bit annoying. Some of the questionable decisions by the writers include, why Louisa is anti suffragette  since she is a progressive owning her own establishment and competing with men is questionable. Aside from that, Louisa hob nobs with the gentry and dresses the part but unlike Eliza Doolittle does not improve her phonetics.  This is a BBC series,  probably ahead of its time, produced in1976. Color is poor, small screen and mostly on stage settings.

2374647,3,B000A6T1X6,"I watched this at a friend's recommendation because I'm a huge fan of period and costume dramas. The Duchess of Duke Street was produced in the mid seventies, and it looks like it. I realize that techniques evolve and cinematography has come a long way since the 70s, but this looks like it may have been a low-budget production for the time. Suprisingly, the sound and video quality were poor enough at times to detract from the viewing experience.

The story, which is loosely based on real-life Rosa Lewis's rise from scullery maid to hotelier, starts off on a strong note as we watch Louisa find her footing in her new employer's household and begin to establish herself as a force to be reckoned with. Gemma Jones is a terrific character actress and the perfect choice for the role of headstrong Louisa Leyton/Trotter. Christopher Cazenove as Charlie Tyrell and Victoria Plucknett as Mary did a respectable job as well. Other actors (and I will admit it may be the dialogue at fault here) seemed to be reading lines more often than not and never really got into their characters.

Around the third episode, the focus seemed to have changed to a situational drama with subplots about romance, deception, adultery, thievery, intrigue, mystery or some combination thereof-- and temporary characters, whose stories are all wrapped up by the end of the episode. And there are the occasional comedic moments thrown in too (at least I think they were supposed to be as some characters are more of a stereotype or caricature than a character with dimension). The shifts were a head scratcher at times because the bit part characters' motivations and actions felt inauthentic as compared with the storylines of the main characters, as if they were just thrown in to make sure the viewers don't get bored and change the channel. Then, the main characters' behavior in some episodes leave you wondering what happened to the character that you had been watching develop over all the previous episodes. :: shrug ::

I found Season 1 interesting enough to go on to watch Season 2 to find out how the main characters' stories are resolved, but unlike other period dramas, I don't expect to ever watch it again. This is a personal bias, of course, but I would have enjoyed a more in depth treatment of and focus on the handful of main characters rather than the leaps from one improbable tale to the next.",1419811200,,2394,4.777777777777778

2374885,3,B000A6T1X6,"The first season is the most interesting.  After that it seems as if the writers are straining to come up with story lines.  The lead actress is an acquired taste.  Her strident voice is a little wearing.  The original story lines are interesting.  However, the heroine seemed to be the dumbest woman about men.  She was clueless and had very bad taste.  She got a man, she lost a man.  She got a  hotel, she lost a hotel.  Rinse and repeat.  There is not the same sense of ensemble that you get with DOWNTON ABBEY.  As always the period detail is superb.  But, after five or six episodes it wears thin.",1415836800,,603,4.324324324324325

The Prince was an evil, immoral man as he thought it was ok to force people to marry so that he could spend time with the married woman so his reputation wouldn't be ruined by his hanging around with a single woman who was below his station in life, and there is also tons of drinking and profanity, in other words, this is NOT a christian show in any way, shape, or form so beware!",1412121600,,415,4.0120481927710845

2375111,3,B000A6T1X6,"I like period pieces without violence. However, this one is not very well written. The characteers are not well developed. Instead of staying with a caste of characters and developing them, it goes for the sensational action with the main characters in the background just barely stitching the episodes together.

2375122,4,B000A6T1X6,"So you know where I am coming from, I love BBC productions, especially period pieces such as Foyle's War and Jane Austin productions.  So I was intrigued when I found The Duchess of Duke Street recently.  Although it was made in the 70's and has that strange production value of video for inside shots and film for outside shots, it still has a more substantial quality to it than many other shows made during that era.  It was probably the ""Downtown Abbey"" of it's day.
The series is based on the real life Rosa Lewis of the Cavendish hotel, and stars Gemma Jones, who some may remember as the mother of Emma Thompson's character in ""Sense and Sensibility.""  Good acting and character development kept me coming back for another episode, although the main character of ""Louisa"" can wear on one's nerves at times.
The show has a small amount of swearing, sexual affairs, and more than a little consumption of alcohol, but it is tame by today's standards, and usually discreet in how it communicates those circumstances. Homeschooling families will want to avoid it unless they have no problem with the antics at Downtown Abbey, but it does deal well with ""upstairs, downstairs"" issues, and being limited and controlled by outside forces.
Overall, it's probably not going to be appreciated by someone who isn't a period piece junkie, but it has been an entertaining discovery for me.",1410566400,,1382,4.818565400843882

2375125,4,B000A6T1X6,"Throw back to another era, not only in the story line, but also in the way the production feels. The stories are more like one act plays and the performers are magnificent. This series is quiet and a little slow paced, which is welcoming in our current age of so many violent show options. The Duchess of Duke Street is a nice change of pace. I'm giving this a four star review because it's not in HD and it's showing it's age. (But then again, this may add to the charm of the show.)",1410480000,,484,4.159574468085107

Gemma Jones did a great job as the ""duchess"" but after a while her voice became irritating: always truculent and too often bellowing. Although she was a caring employer always her first reaction was negative, bossy and argumentative. I realize that she is playing the part of a lower class woman who worked her way up in the Victorian/Edwardian England but after so many years as owner of the Bentinck private hotel, an affair with the man who became King Edward and a love affair with a lord one would expect that those very hard edges would have softened.",1407542400,,692,4.634146341463414

Towards the end of Season 1 got a bit weary of Mrs. Trotter...but really glad I stuck it out.
The dialogue is fast and British...so sometimes hard to understand what they say.....and of course the ""meaning"" of some of their
words are different from Americans but you will get the gist of it.

I probably wouldn't have even been interested in this even if I had I been aware it was on but tastes change, thank goodness.  It is quite interesting.

Good story and interesting characters.  It is obvious, however, that over the years, the production values of BBC shows airing on PBS' Masterpiece Theatre are significantly more elegant than shows produced in the 1970s-80s.

2375388,5,B000A6T1X6,"I loved this series when it first was seen in the 1970's and still enjoyed seeing it recently. Though the story line centers around the central character of Louisa Layton Trotter, each of the characters of this series added their own sense of humor, sadness, dutifulness, loyalty and at times a bit of contention.  This series (season 1 and season 2) takes us through time beginning in the early 1900's to the year 1925.  Louisa has turned an old London hotel into one of its finest as well as its staff.  Though her approach may be considered harsh, or old fashioned, the times dictated that manners and protocol be properly followed.

The episodes covering the period during WW1,give the viewer only a fictional view of the horror and devastation that occurred during that time in England (and most of Europe), and is really focused on the effects it had on the individual characters, each expressing grief, anger and an understanding of fellow human beings.  There was no graphic violence presented, but the sense of loss was felt and I felt the story line remained balanced as it moved along.

I enjoyed this series for the nostalgic look at a very independent (?) character living during some very challenging and difficult times.",1406332800,,1235,4.829383886255924

2375402,4,B000A6T1X6,"Like Downton Abby, The Duchess is a period drama set in London in the early 1900's. Louisa is a poor country girl with the determination to become the best cook in London, and at a time when chefs were always men. She managed to learn and get breaks through hard work and luck, and eventually became one of the most celebrated cooks in high society. Eventually buying a hotel, the series then goes into the day to day life of the servants and the gentry in this hotel. Another series similar to this is The Grande Hotel. Both are good dramas if you like the British period pieces.  It's kept me interested enough to watch the first 15 episodes of Season 1, and have started on Season 2.",1406160000,,686,4.359375
2375403,4,B000A6T1X6,"An older Brit historical drama featuring an early 20th century working class woman trying to make a living for herself. The early shows are pretty good, with a strong likable female lead that stands up for herself through some fairly improbable but interesting traumas.
Sadly, the series jumps the shark in season two.  The previously likeable female lead now becomes strident, unreasonable and gradually hateful.",1406073600,,413,5.3538461538461535

2375423,5,B000A6T1X6,"In my opinion, this series is far superior to Downton Abbey and as good as the original Forsyte Saga. The acting is simply brilliant. You will see many actors who were in many of the great British dramas that were shown on Masterpiece Theater during the late '60s and 70s:
The Spoils of Poynton , I Claudius, Poldark, Elizabeth R, Forsyte Saga et al
For baby boomers, this series is a wonderful reminder of what it was like to experience literate television drama with great British actors.

2375442,5,B000A6T1X6,I was looking for a new series.  I love anything to do with the pre 1920's in England.  I watched Mr. Selfridge and loved it.  This is almost the same type of mini series only this time it is a woman who is making it from rags to riches.  I am now watching Season 2 and love it just as much.  Gemma Jones is fantastic.  Just the way she plays Louisa... the way she carriers herself in all situations.  I really love this series.,1405728000,,428,4.023809523809524
2375443,3,B000A6T1X6,"The era this portrayed was quite interesting and I found ""The Duchess""  quite in contrast with herself.  There were moments that the characters seemed to think you knew what had happened and what background they were coming from.  I found it jumping from scene to scene without and connection/or very little.

This was a ""JUST OKAY"" video.",1405728000,,339,4.894736842105263

The Duchess of Duke Street is based on the true story of Rosa Lewis, a culinary genius and hotel owner. The stories are centered around the drama surrounding her own life, her staff's lives and the colorful guests who stayed at her hotel. My favorite is that of an American conman who is trying to get the better of  a European guest who  unbeknownst to him is a conman as well. The European conman's room is right next that of a young bride whose husband is sick of men ogling his young bride that he locks her in each night...they have separate rooms. Well, the conman discovers a connecting door, bribes the hotel staff to  steal a key for him and....well you know the rest.

Gemma Jones has played in Bridgette Jones, as the Mother, and the mother in Sense and Senibility with Kiera Knightly. She is a seasoned actor and I wanted to watch her as an actress in her younger days. She sings and reminds me of an old Vaudville stage performer. I'm sure she started that way. I was very surprised how deep and loud her voice was but I guess she learned that on stage because she had to project her voice to the very back of the theater. It made me more interested in WW I and why it lasted so long and why it started to begin with years ago. I learned a bit of history and love seeing series that take you back in time and it does teach you about history and what people of that era thought and felt during that period. It was a wonderful period piece and I not done watching it but will be sad when it's completed along with my journey into the early 1900s.",1404604800,,946,4.091397849462366

2375571,4,B000A6T1X6,"Loved the premise of this series. Gemma Jones is a fabulous actress. Unfortunately, due to the quality of the film or sound recording plus the added difficulty of her cockney accent it is extremely hard to understand what is being said. Also, the closed captioning is done in white lettering which is very hard to see as there are so many white backgrounds. I think we have missed more than half the dialogue and it is very well written. We are into our second season and I was hoping the film quality would be better but NOT.

It was teased as the 'rise of a scullery maid to chef for the rich and royal.'  That rise was shown in 2-episodes, then she buys a hotel and the whole plot stagnates.  The lead character is rarely seen in the kitchen or even talking about great cooking ability.  Once in the hotel setting, the plots center mostly around that week's guests or some of the staff.  And while Gemma Jones is an excellent actress, she her character shows very little growth or change between episode 5 and 15 when season one ends.

2375676,4,B000A6T1X6,"Don't let the release date and the stagy production values put you off. This is a wonderful story about a very strong minded and determined woman who rises from servant to cook to chef to royal mistress to the proprietor of an exclusive hotel. And you will be rooting for her all the way, despite the fact that she can be abrasive, annoying, and a perfectionist who is terribly judgmental and misogynistic. Add to that, her indulgence of her upper class guest's whims and her almost brutal treatment of her staff and you could almost loathe her--except that she does have character and a kind heart, along with a willingness to apologize when she knows she is wrong.
Louisa does many things which are less than womanly or thoughtful--she abandons her child, she passes out white feathers during the war, she is opportunistic, and hypocritical towards the mores of other women--but that's what makes her so real and the character so great.

If you know Gemma Jones only in roles roles as kindly mothers and nurses, you'll be surprised by the power of her performance. She might not be a beauty in the modern sense, but in Edwardian England with her lush auburn hair, willowy figure,oval face,  perfect complexion and clear blue eyes--she was quite the thing. Add to that her independence, outspokenness and her masculine turn of mind and I could see how she would appeal to upper class men who were accustomed to a very different type of woman whether reticent lady or shallow and spoiled.

Most of the stories held my interest, were very realistic and sometimes heartbreaking. Great supporting cast and I particularity loved Mary, the quiet, dignified Welsh girl who becomes Louisa's right hand. The over the top menus, tablescapes and wine selections  are wonderfully interesting as well.",1399852800,,1789,4.894389438943894

Louisa is a strong woman who is beliveable bcause she faces multiple situations and makes emotional decisions that are not always good, but always understandable.

2375710,5,B000A6T1X6,I enjoyed the show very much so much I moved to season 2.  I enjoyed seeing the history behind the show the character were good in the show.  My kindle is acting up I order a new adapter and cord hopefully this will help me with my problem.,1399161600,,240,3.9791666666666665
2375711,3,B000A6T1X6,We enjoyed the first few episodes more than the later ones of season 1.  It became harder to understand the dialog the further we got into the series.,1399075200,,150,4.357142857142857
2375712,5,B000A6T1X6,Worth watching! Well done and holds your interest look forward to watching each episode . Really worth a try and enjoy!,1399075200,,119,4.714285714285714

2375714,4,B000A6T1X6,I enjoyed the story but had a little trouble understanding the Duchess because she talks so fast and I am not used to that dialect. Looking forward to more???,1398902400,,158,4.482758620689655
2375715,4,B000A6T1X6,Great characters and good acting. Entertaining. without violence or swearing. It is old so it is like watching a play.,1398816000,,118,4.95
2375716,5,B000A6T1X6,I had seen later seasons many years ago and enjoyed it. I was so happy to watch the first season and see how the story began. This show is a great view of what a woman's life was like in turn of the century England from a life of service to owning her own business. It is very detailed in costumes and settings giving an impression that lingers.,1398729600,,345,4.088235294117647

2375718,4,B000A6T1X6,"I really enjoy watching this series.  I don't understand what exactly fastenates me about the british upper class of the past, but it is fun to watch.  I gave this four stars because the recorded quality isn't up to today's standards, but the content is entertaing and fun.",1398729600,,273,4.666666666666667
2375719,5,B000A6T1X6,"It's not ""Downton Abbey,"" but I've found this series to be very enjoyable. And because it is based on a real character, ""The Duchess"" is all the more fascinating to me.",1398729600,,168,4.451612903225806
2375720,3,B000A6T1X6,"This series is continuous for the first few episodes, then revolves to the telling of a story in each episode.  The main characters remain throughout the entire series with different problems arising and being resolved.  It is fairly pleasant to watch and some story lines are quite interesting.  For an hour with nothing better to do, it will keep you from being bored.",1398643200,,370,4.841269841269841

2375722,4,B000A6T1X6,I like this series because I enjoy British humor and use of language.  The only thing I would say that I didn't enjoy was the storyline.  It's a little disjointed.  But The Duchess plays a terrific part and so does Lord Haselmere.  The characters are developed quite nicely but Mary gets dropped out of a couple of episodes without any explanation.,1398643200,,348,4.655737704918033
2375723,5,B000A6T1X6,The Duchess I like her style she was determine.  She had mind made up and didn't give a damn.  She lived life to the fullest.,1398556800,,125,3.96
2375724,5,B000A6T1X6,"When it first aired in the 1970's, I remember I enjoyed ""The Duchess of Duke Street"". Now, many years later, I'm enjoying it again, having forgotten much of the details. It holds up well, due largely to the acting ability of the ensemble led by Gemma Jones. Louisa Trotter is strong and works hard to get where she wants to be, in spite of being used by the rich and powerful for their own ends. She comes from the lower class with a fiery temper, but is a snob herself. But she will fight for those she believes in, no matter their background. And will fight against those who wrong her, no matter their power. The story of the ups and downs of her rise to ownership of the Bentinck Hotel is the most compelling part of the series, but the ""soap opera"" of lives intersecting at her hotel is also entertaining.",1398556800,,810,4.3355263157894735
2375725,5,B000A6T1X6,"REALLY really good!!!  The acting, the character development, the directing, the story loosely based on a real woman.....a masterpiece!  Set in the same time period as DOWNTON ABBY,  it was really a treat!",1398470400,,205,5.151515151515151
2375726,5,B000A6T1X6,What a surprise to find this show I watched years ago available.  I enjoyed it as much as I did when I first watched it on Masterpiece Theater back in the 70s.  The storyline has really held up well and is not at all dated.,1398470400,,223,3.933333333333333
2375727,5,B000A6T1X6,Very entertaining and well done production that continues to last after many years.  Great writing and acting.  Can highly recommend the complete series.,1398470400,,153,5.608695652173913
2375738,4,B000A6T1X6,"I'm fascinated by this time and manners - I hate it and what it represents -  This show and others present life from the point of view of that time

The attention to detail - the rooms the detail - the manners - the interplay of the people  keeps me watching -The uber rich much be watching behind closed doors / gates and waiting for 'their due'.  Or they might not be waiting",1398470400,,377,4.123287671232877
2375739,5,B000A6T1X6,The story line is very good with interesting characters.  Gives a glimpse of English history at the same time. I enjoyed it.,1398470400,,124,4.636363636363637
2375740,5,B000A6T1X6,"There's no shortage of British period dramas out there, and this one really grew on me. It's different from Dowton Abbey or the new Upstairs-Downstairs in that first few episodes seem disjointed rather than a continuous series. Then, towards the end of season one it all comes together and you can't wait to watch season two! It's especially good as the story is based on a real-life character; don't hesitate to watch and enjoy.",1398384000,,429,4.8108108108108105
2375741,1,B000A6T1X6,Really never caught our interest.  Might be because it was done back in the 70's and we've been spoiled by Downton Abbey.  I'm sure for it's time it was a decent enough show.,1398384000,,174,4.242424242424242
2375742,2,B000A6T1X6,"Creaky series: all those accents and costumes don't hide the lack of character development. This is just a series of stories with some of the characters staying on, or popping in and out.  The characters are dull, and reflect the outmoded social values of a class-ridden England.  I watched thinking this would be a precurser to Downton Abby, but I was disappointed.",1398297600,,366,4.887096774193548
2375743,5,B000A6T1X6,"Having watched this series the first time around, I was delighted to find it has survived the test of time.  Delightful as ever, the Duchess captivates not only Lord Haslemere (and the Prince of Wales) but the rest of us too.  I found myself watching the episodes more than once.  Now it's on to Season 2!  Such great fun to lose yourself in the London of the Edwardian era, a period of great change, romance, and style.",1398124800,,420,4.415584415584416
2375744,4,B000A6T1X6,"I truly enjoyed the characters in this series and was disappointed when the episodes ended, and I do hope there will be other seasons to follow.  The story of survival and all the trials and tribulations she has to endure to get to the top and to stay at the top just shows her character's determination.  Enjoyed the entire season!",1398038400,,332,4.516666666666667
2375745,4,B000A6T1X6,"Enjoyable, but I grew tired of the ""Duchess's"" faux-Cockney accent.  Plenty of amusing scenes, particularly the occasions when the staff would fall into squabbling downstairs.  The costumes were lovely, and the historical allusions made the story more interesting.",1398038400,,264,5.921052631578948
2375746,5,B000A6T1X6,"I watched this series sporadically in the 70's when it came out and enjoyed it then. It is a real pleasure to see it again almost forty years later, on my big TV, in order, at my pleasure, being able to pause it, etc. A spare hour can be filled in a delightful way with this well-done British drama. Acting is superb, stories are entertaining, and you get a real insight into Edwardian England. Highly recommended!",1398038400,,414,4.4605263157894735

2375758,4,B000A6T1X6,"This is one tough lady, and perhaps in Season 1, a little too tough.  I was waiting for some storyline that softened her a bit, or otherwise you would watch the entire series and really not like her.  Fascinating strength for that time period, but not a likable lady.",1397952000,,267,4.428571428571429
2375759,4,B000A6T1X6,Very entertaining series.  We always enjoy the old English life styles and this is no exception.  We can't wait until we view the next episode.,1397865600,,143,4.68
2375760,3,B000A6T1X6,This was the first of I suppose is a series. The premise was good and the story was OK but I had to concentrate more than I wanted to because of the thick cockney accents.  Maybe if I watch more of the series I will get used to them.  The other British series TV that I've seen have not been as difficult to comprehend.,1397779200,,319,3.96875
2375761,3,B000A6T1X6,i enjoyed this series at the beginning but after the mid-point the story line seemed to drag.  I didn't finish watching the entire series.,1397779200,,138,4.75

2375766,3,B000A6T1X6,"The first few shows were really good, but then it changed to be more about the guest, than the Duchess herself. All in all it is a pretty good show.",1397692800,,148,3.966666666666667
2375767,5,B000A6T1X6,One of my favorite BBC television dramas of all time. Don't let the fact that it was made in the '70s prevent you from watching.  Gemma Jones and the rest of the cast are so good! I didn't want it to end.,1397606400,,204,3.857142857142857
2375768,5,B000A6T1X6,"Before there was BBC America, there was PBS. I have many fond memories of family viewing ""the Duchess of Duke Street."" It seems British TV gave America examples of ""women before their time"" (also think of Emma Peel on the Avengers)."" The Duchess"" knew what she wanted to do with her life and by golly no one was going to stop her. Neither her mother or a handsome aristocrat was going to stand in her way. I remembered, as I watched the first episode, that my son loved the porter's chair just inside the door of her establishment. He would say with every episode how he wanted a chair like that, because one could hide in it and no one would ever find you. Now that these chairs are available maybe that would make a nice Christmas present. If you like all things British, do watch the The Duchess in action. You won't regret it!",1397606400,,830,4.361290322580645

I had hoped for political intrigue, class struggle, and triumph of spirit in the main character.  Instead, the series settled into a boring routine of boring characters.  Suffice it say that if you were hoping for a series as interesting and enjoyable as Downton Abbey, Mr. Selfridge, or Pride and Prejudice, you will likely be disappointed.",1396656000,,423,5.014285714285714
2375818,4,B000A6T1X6,"Others have objected to to Emma Jones' character being so ""stoic and icy"" and how ""annoying"" she is. I concur.  Aside from her unrelenting ambition to be a famous chef at any cost (allowing herself to be prostituted to a prince) a move that seemed at odds with her basic character, it was also hard to see how she could be considered so desirable and such a ""great beauty"" to so many menespecially to the one man who could have had anyone (and pretty much did): Edward, Prince of Wales.

First, while she has lovely eyes and an enviable mane of hair (if that was really all Emma Jones' hair), that's pretty much where Mrs. Trotter's feminine allure ends.  Her gestures and mannerisms (especially the way she walks and hold her arms) are very tomboyishmake that bordering on deformed.

And that voice...ugh. I realize this is not My Fair Lady where the screeching, unkempt cockney flower girl is gradually transformed into a stunning, lady-like beauty, but really...after all that time in the company of lords and ladies, one would hope that Mrs. Trotter  would have picked up a least a modicum of sophistication and refinement.  Not over the top mind youwe certainly would not like her any better if she were pretentious and full of airs. I just would like to her be a little easier on on the earsand more alluring in the best sense of the word.

Of course at her core she was a good person: kind and compassionate, and refreshingly candid, direct and no-nonsense.  But the visual and audio on Mrs. Trotter was enough to almost send me trotting off to another British show (of which I have watched dozens).

In short, the only reason that I didn't tune out this series completely was the otherwise excellent cast of characters as well as great writing.  Do wish they had picked another actress for this role.",1396569600,,1808,4.639498432601881
2375819,5,B000A6T1X6,I thought performance and story were both excellent. I wish there were more seasons to watch. Always looked forward to next episode.,1396569600,,132,5.045454545454546
2375820,3,B000A6T1X6,"The beginning episodes are better than several of the last ones.  During the earlier episodes the family background of the ""Duchess"" is revealed, and I felt a great deal of sympathy for her and developed great admiration for this Cockney woman who became very successful in spite of her background in the class-conscious environment that still exists in the UK, and was particularly at play during Edwardian England. She did what she had to do to reach the considerable degree of  success that she did, including marriage to a man she barely knew and, briefly, was mistress to the Prince of Wales (an affair which he ended when Queen Victoria died and he became King Edward VII).

She was not always easy on her own staff, which is an understatement, but is typical behaviour of people who have had to prove themselves by becoming perfectionists. However, she was kindness personified when she encountered people in distress, and when she was particularly harsh to staff members, she didn't always apologize for her rudeness but made up for it in her own way.

Once her identity and character were established, the storylines wavered off track at times.  One episode (No. 6, I believe) involved an American who was duped out of a considerable amount of money by one of her hotel guests who was an imposter. The storyline wasn't very interesting, and the actor's American accent was all over the country. In the same sentence he might sound like someone from the Deep South, then from the Midwest, New England, the West and from various levels socio-economic levels.

While I wasn't spellbound by this series, it did hold my interest enough that I'm going to watch the second season of the show.

2375879,4,B000A6T1X6,"I am watching this series on Amazon, and have been watching an episode nightly,almost through season 2. It is very charming, and I find that even though the character of Louisa Trotter is front and center in every episode, Gemma Jones manages to hold my attention and command it. The writers have developed her in a consistent and believable fashion, and her eccentricities and pluck never become cloying. There are a few great supporting male roles too, and Merriman, the waiter, and The Major, come to mind. They both add so much to the series. I particularly like the understatement of how much a woman could achieve in the days before suffrage and well before women's lib. The script actually points that out in one episode when Louisa acknowledges that she is very aware that she herself has no gender issues when it comes to achieving what she has set out to do. The few things that annoyed me, watching this series in such condensed time, as I say, nightly instead of weekly, were the squeaky shoes of Starr, the doorman, and Merriman, as they cross the Bentinck 's lobby, and this is frequently and in every episode. It is like scratching a fingernail on the blackboard, but on some level it adds to the charm, I suppose, and I am almost certain it was intentional. This is a hotel with no pretenses, afterall.  I was also less than satisfied with the portrayal of Fred, Starr's fox terrier and constant companion. He holds the place of the Bentinck's mascot, a permanent fixture in a basket in the lobby, but he has the least personality of any fox terrier I have known. The breed is known for its quirkiness and sociability, but poor little Fred , chained to that lobby bed, has almost no chance to strut his stuff, and it made me feel sorry for him. All in all, this is a very entertaining production with some very fine performances.",1395705600,,1845,4.590909090909091

But it goes without saying that I would have to come from the priveledged classes.  Now I've become fascinated with the Edwardian period; the emergence 'upstairs' on one hand from the rigid Victorian and into the more 'casual' of the new period while those below-stairs are pretty much locked in the past.  We in the 21st century truly have no idea of how people lived then; the strict class system, the drudgery of those who were employed to wait on them hand to foot and the lack of ability to speak up, to demand rights, to have a day off when desired, even to be ill.

I was hesitant at first because it was televised back in 1976, but rest-assured that this is a top-notch show!  It took myself the first couple of episodes to get to know and like the main character, Louisa Trotter played by Gemma Jones.  She's a straight-shooter from the get-go who doesn't fear or hold back on what she thinks or wants despite class and more importantly gender restrictions of early 1900's Britain.  It's refreshing to watch in any production, much less a British one.  There are also unexpected comedic moments peppered inside the episodes in lovely British style.

2375953,5,B000A6T1X6,Still a winner after all this time.  Good representation of Edwardian+ times.  Acting is solid and good set decoration both upstairs and down.,1393891200,,142,5.130434782608695
2375954,4,B000A6T1X6,"I was intrigued with this show - plot line and character development especially, from the opening episode up through episode 6 or so. It offered a unique view of English life through the unlikely eyes of a woman servant who works her way up in life. Overcoming cultural challenges and class distinctions made the main characters rich and worth following through the ins and outs of every day life in England at this time.  It was as if the underside of readily-known history was being revealed through the life and trials of the protagonist and those characters in her immediate circle.

I was surprised and a bit dismayed when the story line began to change as the life of  the ""Duchess"" stabilized and the character I had come to admire and enjoy was relegated to a periphery role!  I gave the show 4 stars, because the story line is still interesting and well-done.  I just find it disappointing that the main characters, whose lives so attracted me initially, have been moved out of the spotlight.

The show is enjoyable. I still watch it.  I am not so passionate about it now, however. I recommend persons do not get too connected to the main characters...they fade into the Victorian wallpaper much too soon!",1393804800,,1214,4.69811320754717

2375975,5,B000A6T1X6,"Louisa Trotter is a person you will not soon forget. From a young girl put into service, making it up the ranks to a famous chef, which at that time, was an all male profession. Forced to marry to remain a chef, she was very unhappy, but muddled through and made a substantial living, which she entrusted to her husband. She bought him a hotel and placed him in charge to boost his ego which was a tragic mistake. He lost all her money by his poor judgement. Louisa chucks him out and she works her way up to the top again. Falls in love and things just get more and more interesting. From start to finish you will love this feisty, determined, lovable woman. She shows all, that determination to better yourself pays off in the long run. It is all based on a true story.

A strong-willed woman with a mind of her own and her rise in society from an apprentice cook is the main theme of the early episodes.  How all of this comes about is intriguing and unconventional.  The series can become ""addictive"".",1393200000,,331,4.875

After having first seen it years ago on Masterpiece Theater, I saw that videos were for sale (Parts 1 and 2).  That was years later and the cost was exorbitant.  Then it was offered a few years later and the price was something like $100.  I didn't go for it.  I am so glad it is on Netflix.  Gemma Jones who plays Louisa is fabulous.  The acting, the storyline (taken from true events), the costumes, the sets, all transport one into a wonderful world of life drama.  This is a no-miss hit.",1393027200,,585,4.351851851851852

I have to agree with most of the  reviews that explained the story line so articulately and
in potent detail. I would recommend this series to anyone that has the time and patience to
listen closely as the cockney accent is very thick. Louisa's mother and daughter were the two
most annoying people and I was waiting for Louisa to smack them down each time they appeared in
a scene. As strong as Louisa appeared to be, she just never seemed to put them in their place when she
should have.  Apart from that the whole series was outstanding with superb acting.",1392940800,,645,4.551724137931035

The young Gemma Jones is fantastic-- and her long career continues to present day.  She was notable in Bridget Jones' (no relation) Diary and Sense and Sensibility as well.  Great cast, great evolving storylines.  I feel like I stumbled upon a lost work of art (for myself at least).  On to Season 2.",1392940800,,433,4.644736842105263

I can't really put my finger on what I find better, but I'm enjoying it more.",1392940800,,352,4.603174603174603

2376007,4,B000A6T1X6,"I'm a huge fan of British TV. This show is good. I love the characters and story lines. The one thing that absolutely drives me batty is that the main character Louisa never learns to speak ""like a lady."" She's the mistress to the King, a business owner and travels in elegant circles etc. Her hair and clothing styles progress but she retains the cockney speech. Drives me up the wall. :) Other than that the show is fun and interesting.",1392854400,,438,4.419753086419753

Working her way up the staff ladder from menial labor, she convinces a famous French chef to train her, against his better judgement, and becomes ""the"" society chef, eventually owning her own hotel.

The first few episodes resolve around her climb and laying out her personal life, the latter episodes become little self contained short stories with a continuing cast of her, her staff, and a particulary ""favorite"" hotel guest, but with different hotel guests each episode.

Luisa ends up loving Bertie and is very sorry when he dies. This little scullery maid becomes the best cook in England, opens a very discreet hotel for the rich and famous and proceeds to rule her little demesne with iron and empathy. Framed by history, this series follows her life as she falls in love with Charles, bears Charles' child, and encourages Charles to marry Margaret, a woman of his social status.

In Season II, the Great War will change everything. This is a fine series, hard to believe that is was created in the late 1970's. I have enjoyed both seasons of the Duchess of Duke Street.",1392508800,,809,4.429530201342282

I enjoyed Season 1 tremendously because one gets to experience the people's struggle to unravel society's norm imposed by those of the powerful ruling class.

The only requirement is the first couple of episodes so that you can see how such a rough character came to run such a very posh establishment.  I like the episodes but frankly Mrs. Trotter's voice is rather grating. Her accent never softens and her grammar does not change although exposed to the upper classes in society. It is made to appear that she never learns to speak with an accent that is less cockney which is hard to believe. Maybe the writers thought that was what would make her endearing but I personally find it hard to believe that rubbing elbows with the gentry did nothing to improve her use of the language. Also since she came by her position in life by being somewhat immoral it is strange that once successful she is very critical of others  personal failings

2376073,5,B000A6T1X6,"This is a series about how a feisty young woman worked her way to the top by her own sheer will and determination to be the greatest cook in England.  Women didn't become cooks during her time.  Women were only maids.  Eliza didn't accept that however and fought for her chance to become a cook.  Once she got her first shot, the rest was history.  She cooked for royalty and even made her way to owning her own hotel...with the help of a special friend, of course (you'll have to watch to find out whom).  She deals with love, friendship, and even learning to be true to herself.

All in all, I give this five stars.  The theme music is awful, but the series is definitely addicting for one like myself who loves period dramas.  I hope you enjoy.",1392249600,,747,4.316546762589928

Louisa Trotters character, complicated, disciplined and hard working is inspiring. Her story could take place in any time. This setting is detailed in its time period . It is an outstanding work, well developed, and presented. Louisa and Charlies love story is magical and so very sad.

Seeing her independence in an era in which a woman had difficulty achieving the kind of independence which allowed her to rise in the English caste system was very satisfying.

I like all the characters and love that it displays the many varied accents that are in England to say it's such a small island. The main character is rather brusque, but such a diamond in the rough, that she's endearing nevertheless.
I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 mainly because the story line doesn't always compel me to watch the next episode, which really isn't always such a bad thing anyway.",1391817600,,464,4.470588235294118

The ""Dutchess"" is from the working class, but with clear goals, and a ton of hard work and determination, she makes a good life for herself in a vocation that was not particularly welcoming to women.  She is a tough cookie with a heart of gold.  I am currently watching Season 2.  I will be sad to see the end of the series.  It's like reading a really good book.",1391731200,,477,4.197802197802198

The main character is still a strong woman with good business sense and an understanding of how to deal with people. However, about episode 5 I began losing interest and am only on Episode 7 now. I doubt I will finish the series.

For instance, the maids are often very naive and easily impressed by what they see. It would be more believable if there were more servants around doing all the work.

You will get to know each character so thoroughly--Mr. Starr's squishy shoes, Mary's lilting Welsh dialect, Charlie's warm blue eyes, and Louisa's tough-on-the-outside but creme brulee-inside--as you would know all the family members at your Thanksgiving table.  The stories are sweet, funny, tender, and sometimes painfully sad.  Over the years, Louisa ascends from lowly kitchen maid to London hotel owner to canteen manager in France during the First World War.  I will be so sorry to reach the end of this series.

The Duchess's fiesty and sometimes stubborn nature were the character traits that provided her and her employees a decent life in very challenging times.

The characters are authentic and the language is just right. The Duchess is a wonderful portrayal of a Londoner of that time, she is proud, funny, charitable, and has the indomitable spirit of a Londoner. It is the story, well told, of her rise from a poor child to a famous hotel owner, her ambition to be the best cook in the world and her success. Along the way she overcomes great sadness and experiences that only make her stronger yet kinder. You will fall in love with the character and never want the story to end. For a rollicking good time watch every episode- you won't regret it. It made me homesick for London.",1390953600,,769,4.347222222222222
2376305,5,B000A6T1X6,"Given the age of this series, more than three decades old, and the somber tone of the main publicity photo, I wasn't exactly wild with anticipation when I started watching it. By the end of it, I was truly sorry to leave it.

I'm sure other reviewers will detail the main story line of the poor and abused young girl who -- by determination, talent and the willingness to forgo everything else in life -- became the greatest cook in England. Her romantic life was extremely difficult but also, largely glamorous and enriching in many ways. Her family and coworkers were unforgettable characters. (Her parents and brother being particularly noteworthy, and her mother especially being a brilliantly acted monster of thwarted dreams and mean spirit.)

To say anymore about the most interesting characters would, I'm afraid, chase potential watchers away.  And not do justice to the story lines. Suffice to say that everyone is very real, and very much a product of the times.

The era is the early part of the 20th century up to and immediately after World War I. One of the powerful values of this series is how well it creates vignettes of the lives of people in both high and low positions. Louisa, the ""Dutchess,"" spends her working life serving the aristocracy and royalty, as a purveyor of cooking and later hotel services. She becomes close to them. But she is also surrounded by her own employees, whose lives are much more precarious as well as more grounded in reality. The integration of these class differences is skillfully handled by the script writers, and the acting is perfection.

One of the notable aspects of the writing is how the episodes are constructed. With the exception of Louisa's life story which of course progresses through the series, the episodes are very self-contained and concern issues that rise and are resolved in the episode. While there may be multiple characters in challenge during a single episode, the structure is more play-like and focused on one important story arc, compared the the more novel-like style of multiple independent personal stories that is so common today.

At first I found this a little antiquated and naive, but later I came to appreciate it for the scope it gave the designers of the show to illuminate the circumstances and details of life at that time. It created a sense of natural story-telling, rather than the artificial  and jerky cutting back and forth in modern drama that keeps the interest high but makes it almost impossible to study the scenes.

The era is as much a part of this story as the characters, which is true in any period piece, but particularly so in the Dutchess of Duke Street. Where people were located and what was happening there, as well as who they were in social and economic terms, were the inseparable foundations of the entire drama. The richness of the scenes and details made me glad when particular environments were revisited in different episodes. I can't imagine the effort and expense involved in creating these scenes, as well as developing the wardrobe. But whatever it was, it was worth it. I will go back to watch this again just to study that world.

Finally, no review would be complete without some comment about the character of Louisa. She is an odd protagonist for a series, and very hard to characterize in broad terms. The woman you see in the photograph that promotes this series has an expression that you will really understand only after watching the series  Toward the end, a journalist attempting to write a book about Louisa's life asks people around her what characteristics made her so successful. One resident of the hotel said it was her endless compassion and generosity. A long-time employee said it was that she was a heartless bully. Both were right, and it wasn't just because they were in the positions of customer and employee.

The series borders on being ""chic flick"" material, but not really. It's not soap opera, not sentimental or cheap in any way. Love is certainly an issue but not the dominant theme (often by sheer dint of Louisa's refusal to bend), and the wartime episodes are some of the best I've seen, heart-clutching scenes of the horrors in France.

I heartily recommend it as a great piece of theatrical work, but especially for armchair anthropologists who want to know what it was like a century ago for a woman who made the toughest decisions to pursue her vision of greatness.",1390953600,,4435,4.805774278215223
2376306,4,B000A6T1X6,"I'd never heard of this series, which is clearly several years old. But the main actress is superb, and it shows an era in history that is fascinating to me. In the vein of Upstairs Downstairs but with an independent character, rather than a large household, it shows the everyday challenges of lower to middle class England in the early 20th century.

This series alone was worth my Amazon Prime annual fee.  Many evenings I should have turned it off for bed but I was so involved in the episodes, I'd glance at the clock and think to myself ""I will just watch one more"".  It was hard for me to wait for the next evening.  I devoured both season 1 and season 2 with pleasure.  Thanks Amazon !",1390435200,,500,4.477777777777778

Fabulous series that is worth watching again every few years.",1390348800,,354,5.016949152542373

2376480,5,B000A6T1X6,"An excellent and addictive series. Pre - Downton Abbey and a contemporary of Upstairs Downstairs, the characters in the Duchess are as compelling and maybe even more so than the other shows'
What is wonderful and most interesting are the styles, lifestyle, and mores of the time. The stories are more contained in scope and therefore the characters take front and center stage. Thus far at least, WW1 and sweeping English countryside are of less significance than Louisa,her staff, and the hotel traffic that impact upon them.

Some great loves, some great fights, and most of all a woman to admire, respect and peek in on as she makes her own way in a time when that was not the way to do things.",1389916800,,697,4.620967741935484

By the end of the first episode, a poor girl with no training in cuisine has so impressed the Prince of Wales that he gives her a necklace and chooses her for his paramour?! By the second episode, she is being courted by the rich and famous. I think it's by the third, she has a beautiful house and a husband. It's just too much. It's also a bit tawdry. She may be called a ""duchess,"" but she lacks honor and nobility. And why doesn't her husband mind that she sleeps with the Prince? Actually, I'm not watching it anymore. I lost interest. I don't know what happens after all this. If you can stick with it, let me know.",1389916800,,717,4.318518518518519

Love, love, love period pieces (like Downton Abbey) and this series satisifed that  yearning.  The main character, Louisa, was entertaining and brilliant.  She kept my interest in the series going from one episode to the next and from series one to series two.  The Duchess... was educational, informative and entertaining.  I learned that  the issues women faced back in the day were surprisingly, similar to the issues  women face today... whether the issue centered on a career minded person, like Louisa, or leaned towards the domestic, stay at home care taker.  Louisa, was exception to the rule, for she chose to have a career and  life path ...she was true to herself and to all who surrounded her...excellent series to involve yourself in for a turn of the century experience.",1389830400,,865,4.903448275862069

2376542,5,B000A6T1X6,"This serIes is perfect for immersing yourself in the Victorian era, with excellent scenery, costumes and acting. It's a great escape into another time period.",1389657600,,158,5.36
2376543,5,B000A6T1X6,"So I came across this by accident, but I love period pieces so I thought, why not......
It is a great, great series of shows.  It is about a woman who starts out as gentry (working class back in the day), and with pride, determination, and a great head on her shoulders, makes a success of not only herself, but her business and life.  She makes some amazing friends along the way.  Each show deals with trials and tribulations that she overcomes.
You see the star always hard-headed and practically emotionless, but there are those times you get to see her vulnerable, which makes you fall in love with her character and stay loyal to the show.
I highly recommend watching all the seasons.  I especially love the last show....it isn't sad like most other endings can be to a television series.",1389571200,,794,4.570422535211268
2376544,5,B000A6T1X6,"I found this one of the best Period dramas that I have seen to date.  At first I was turned off by the cheesy intro music and the old camera quality.  However, the acting, characters and story were just marvelous.

All characters were believable, admirable, human, and interesting.  There were plenty of very funny quips.  The writing and dialogue were great.  There were also a few very sad scenes.  I definitely had tears during one particular scene where Louisa read a letter.  The envelope is pushed a bit with some extreme events.  Some things happen that you don't expect.  It is kept interesting throughout.

This is filled with plot, not fillers.  In the first few episodes, there is enough that happens that you would see in a typical entire 3 season tv show.  While there may be 1 or 2 episodes out of the two seasons which felt a bit filler, the rest of it was pure plot development.  And it was done superbly.  I loved Downton Abbey, yet while the camera shots were newer, the acting and characters and plot pale in comparison to the Duchess at Duke Street.

Louisa Trotter is an admirable yet human character, with her own flaws.  Her flaws are also her strengths.  She is an inspiration when it comes to having guts, speaking your mind, and holding on to your dreams.

:::::Some possible spoilers below but I kept it pretty vague so they're not really spoilers:::::

Lastly, there seemed to be some elements of this series that are repeated or were similar to other more current period dramas.  I believe the song with the lyrics ""If I were the only boy in the world and you were the only girl"" also appeared in Downton Abbey.  Also the way one maid was thrown out was similar to the way a maid was thrown out in Downton Abbey.  And a young girl sneaking out to go dancing also appeared in Downton Abbey.  And there were little cultural references that I've seen repeated in newer shows as well.  E.g. tea leaves being read also appeared in Lark Rise to Candleford. Also the way a certain young girl developed reminded me of a kinder version of Veda in Mildred Pierce.  While some similarities may be coincidental or a result of using the same cultural references due to a similar time period, I can't help but wonder if some of the later presentations were influenced by this gem of a series.",1389571200,,2307,4.538834951456311
2376545,5,B000A6T1X6,"It took me a few episodes to get hooked, but then I couldn't stop.

2376562,5,B000A6T1X6,"This show is the quintessential story of a girl from the wrong side making it in the world. The lead character is brassy, beautiful, bold & has a softness that rarely comes out. She takes care of her foundlings just like a mama bear would her cubs. She doesn't always do things above board but has a moral center that's unshakable. The supporting cast is colorful and adds the spice to the soup that is this show. I really hope they continue to make new episodes. It's rare to find period pieces on tv that work & this one definitely works. Huzzah!",1389398400,,548,4.382352941176471

 Is ok to see if you have nothing else to watch. It offers a few details of the cultural aspects of the time but that is all.

I can not recommend this as a very good program because it can not keep you interested and is boring sometimes.",1389398400,,478,4.3

Louisa wants to be ""the best cook in England."" Early in the series she gets great promotion help opening her hotel from Prince Edward, who wants her as his mistress if she'll marry a man she doesn't love (the prince wouldn't, of course, in those Victorian years, have a single woman as a mistress). She does marry, then loses the arrangement when the prince becomes the king and has to be more careful. Her marriage fails, she falls in love with a Lord (her first sentimental feelings), then is heart-broken when she must give that up. There are many episodes involving all sorts of people coming and going from the hotel. Her staff is a fresh, funny, well-meaning bunch, each with his/her own story.",1389398400,,859,4.695364238410596

2376568,5,B000A6T1X6,"This first season of the two-season BBC period drama of 31 episodes from 1976-77 has staying power. It could be broadcast on PBS next Sunday night, and it would be a crowd-pleaser. The sets look good, sometimes lavish; the photography of food and flowers is sensual; and the acting's captivating. At the center of the drama is Louisa Trotter (brilliantly played by Gemma Jones). A Cockney working girl since the age of 12, Louisa has one aim in life: to become the best cook in England. She largely succeeds, at some personal cost. Along the way she becomes the proprietress of the Bentinck Hotel in London, discreetly and exclusively catering to the wants and desires --- not all of them culinary --- of Edwardian swells. That service leads to a number of the series' episodes. The most enjoyable and fascinating episodes, however, are the ones that focus directly on Louisa, a complex, flawed, but very appealing character.",1389312000,,925,4.898089171974522

Sometimes the British speech is challenging to understand but the characters and plot are enjoyable.  We see that there are two more sessions (only the 2nd is currently accessible) so we hope to continue it for a while.

It is following through her ups and downs from the beginning of her career and continuing on.  It is beautifully done.  It is very well acted and the costuming and staging are stars in themselves.  I had seen Jemna Jones in other works so it is lovely to see how good she was even as a young person.  I think if you're a Downton Abbey fan you would enjoy this as well.

2376662,5,B000A6T1X6,"Just loved this series!  Much grittier than Downton.  Each episode reveals more of each character.  Has 'upstairs, downstairs' characters: from aristocracy to cooks and maids.  Gemma Jones, as Louisa (the Duchess), from working class backgroun;  and Christopher Casanove, as Charlie, Lord Haselmere, are both endearing, irrascable at times, fantastic, as are all of the supporting actors.  Hard to believe it aired in the 1970's, it is not dated at all, and somehow seems more British than Downton.  The main plot moves slowly through the episodes, don't skip any!",1388707200,,564,5.340909090909091

Easy to like the characters and really eye opening to the whole cultural thing of the Edwardian era.,1388707200,,291,4.178571428571429

2376688,3,B000A6T1X6,"The lead actress and her leading man are fun to watch and the chemistry definitely is there.  However, the secondary characters, with the exception of the ladies maid who becomes manager of the hotel,  are tiresome and take away from the main,characters.  This a low budget soap of the seventies that is worth a look as long as you watch the episodes featuring the dutchess and the lord.  Too slow even for historical fiction.",1388275200,,426,4.716216216216216

2376690,4,B000A6T1X6,"The beginning of this intriguing story of a poor girl's dream of being a Chef is a wonderful view of life before liberties. The story shows how lives were meant to be lived but how some would come to be known as pioneers in their world. The story in Season 1 begins very well but as it progresses, it becomes a bit harsh to see the way people are treated. I was not very excited with the end of Season 1 but have begun Season 2 & am very glad the story has picked up well. Don't give up, better episodes are ahead.",1388275200,,514,4.0

2376749,5,B000A6T1X6,"Well, the poor girl with a lot of ambition to be a famous cook/chef, becomes just that, but more. The trials and tribulations are very dramatic, and this actress is great in the part. I would never have recognized her in her other roles,eg as Morse's fancy, never realized, in ""Morse."" (Gemma Jones) Her personal morality portrayed is modern though, ie lack therof. I doubt very much if that was the kind of morality a young lady of her caliber would have had in her day. A tough risk-taking, no nonsense girl would have much more likely been a strongly religious type! Ladies (and men) of wishy-washy morals, at least in the post-Victorian era, contrary to movie-makers portrayals, rarely shine as heroines or heroes. And she insisted on strict morality in her employees, if not in her clientele.

She seems to have paved the way for other women to follow their dreams, not let anything get you down, and keep on keeping on. The only thing I didn't like is she seems to be a bit too brash and discomforting at times. But then again, at that time in England, she probably had to be. My most unfavorite episode is when Mary and Louisa get into a row and call each other a most unsavory name.

It's mostly about the Duchess herself and ocassionally focuses on other character's story lines.

I've followed her career for a long time and will watch anything she's in.  The characters are interesting and sometimes I love to hate the ""upper classes"" whose snobbery is disgusting.  But I understand the History  of Britain and they were extremely class conscious
to the extreme which makes for great entertainment for us ""masses"".",1384819200,,468,4.8125

This series is one of the earlier Master Piece series when they really were master pieces and based on a true story.  The main character is a woman of Cockney (poor) descent who desperately wants to learn to cook.  After a rough ""internship"", she because famous for her very sophisticated cooking and comes to the attention of the current King of England.  It is hinted that she had an affair with the King.  She opened her own ""boarding"" house still serving excellent food but also quietly providing private rooms upstairs for very rich gentlemen who want an evening alone in a bedroom with their lover.  I can't go very far into this because there are cool twist to it that are impossible to explain in a few sentences.  If you remember this series, by all means buy it.  It holds up beautifully.",1383782400,,956,4.479768786127168
2376851,5,B000A6T1X6,"I saw this when it first played on ""Masterpiece Theatre"" (with Alistair Cooke) and followed it faithfully. Streaming it now, it still holds up well, the eccentricities of the characters, how they grow and change over the course of the drama. However the video is not striking, too bad it was not filmed in technicolor.",1383696000,,318,4.8

2376857,4,B000A6T1X6,"This series is rather interesting but the characters are fairly simply drawn with out much dimension.  Seeing a woman succeed in Victorian England is delicious, when one considers that women were kept in menial positions, for the most part.  Was it just a matter of spunk or raw ambition?

2376870,5,B000A6T1X6,"This series told its story through a timeline of when it was really hard for women to do what Luisa Trotter did --- own her own business. Although this was the dominant storyline, the sub-stories gave Luisa a lot of credibility as a human being, and they really showed her as a human being. I watched a couple of these episodes in the 70's and lost track of it. I'm glad I found it again on Amazon Prime and was about to watch both seasons.

2376873,4,B000A6T1X6,"A good show, the clothing was reasonably accurate, the first few seasons were the most interesting, especially about such an interesting person! Once you got past the documented parts of her life it became a little formula-driven, but the main character's strong personality kept it going.

Immensely enjoying the travails of Louisa Trotter, who has worked herself up from cook to the operator of a fashionable hotel.

The workings of the hotel and the staff are very interesting especially considering all the modern conveniences that are missing back then.  The staff relationships are probable and intricate at times.  The politics of the day are intreging and the family relationships.....I can not even imagine putting a girl ""out to service"" at such young ages or selling your wife off to the kings fancy.

Yet, ""The Duchess of Duke Street"" so captured both my time and attention that I watched every episode in less than four days.

Louisa works hard and proves herself to the resident  French chef and her employers. Life is hard and very complicated as you find out as the story unfolds.  Hard decisions are made and not ones you would ever expect. The casting in spot on. If you love other BBC series then you are sure to love this one.,1380240000,,427,4.011764705882353

2376933,2,B000A6T1X6,I liked this series at first but the main character became annoting and hard to like.  There are some wonderful supporting actors and some of the characters are likeable ..but not Louisa.,1379635200,,187,4.84375
2376934,4,B000A6T1X6,"First few episodes were great, but then it headed south. Original plot . . . woman wants to be a great chef in a era where proper women didn't work . . . Instead, the ""Duchess"" winds up as an ""innkeeper"" but the inn is more a boarding house than an hotel. Except for staff and stars, not much weaves the weeks together. Enjoyable and commendable for a series of 70s.
And yes, I admit, ""Downton Abbey"" has spoiled me for loving much of anything else!",1379635200,,449,4.232558139534884

While the beginning episodes might not rate 5 stars, the series builds and becomes more and more enjoyable. I should also mention that ""The Duchess.."" has fine comedic features which I thoroughly enjoyed.",1379548800,,353,4.80327868852459

2376950,5,B000A6T1X6,"Discovered this due to Amazon Prime, and we just thought we would try it out. This was on for just two seasons in the late 70's, but what a great BBC gem this is. The writing and the story concepts are just delightful, with terrific acting. You won't be disappointed!",1379548800,,267,4.36
2376951,4,B000A6T1X6,"I had already watched The Duchess of Duke Street once a long time ago, and I've thoroughly enjoyed rewatching it.  The story of a talented, ambitious working-class woman who parlays her cooking skills into a place in society is fascinating.  Louisa Trotter isn't a typical storybook character -- she has flaws, including being a snob and having a fiery temper.  But she' s determined, loyal, a good employer and better friend.  Her storyline starts when the then-Prince of Wales takes a fancy to her.  The show makes it clear that, really, Louisa has no choice but to acquiesce to his plans to make her one of his many mistresses if she wants to cook for high society, her only path to respectability and financial security.  I think the scene where she asks her soon-to-be-husband (she has to be married; the Prince of Wales couldn't possibly ""ruin"" an unmarried woman) if he doesn't mind the Prince's plans for her, and he asks her what other choice people like them have.  That one brief scene highlights the cold-blooded reality behind Edward's affairs.

When Victoria dies and Edward becomes king, he ends his relationship with Louisa, and she's on her own.  Watching her work herself literally sick and rise in status and wealth makes for fascinating television.  The plot might seem impossible, except that the series is based loosely on the life of a real-life woman who ran the Cavendish Hotel in London.",1379548800,,1413,4.85
2376952,4,B000A6T1X6,This is a pretty good series set in Victorian England. We've been enjoying it and you may too. Good drama.,1379548800,,106,4.35

2376954,4,B000A6T1X6,"This can't be compared to Downton Abbey but it's still very good.  Louisa, the lead character built herself up from being a lowly kitchen person to a very chef that was demanded to cook at many meals for royalty and slightly lower peers.  She was an honest woman who wouldn't ask any thing a person that she had been capable of doing herself at one point in her life--extremely fair in most instances.  She would have been a great example in this day and age to young people that if you want to better yourself you have to give 110%.  How many people do that today and especially in today's economy?",1379548800,,599,4.36936936936937

2376957,1,B000A6T1X6,"The show was boring predictable steryotypical and uninteresting. I was surprised at how stale  I found it. I generlly enjoy the British humor, but this show was so formula oriented it had little artistic value.",1379376000,,210,5.0
2376958,5,B000A6T1X6,"I loved this story it was entertaining to say the least,Mrs. Trutter is a hard core woman who knew what she wanted and got it.
The whole story line is based around her and her staff of a posh hotel,and its many characters who stayed there for various reasons.
She is short tempered,demanding and stricked,but yet somehow you like her.
I recommend this saga .",1379376000,,358,4.523076923076923

Is very much like Upstairs, Downstairs except you have a heroine who you root for from the beginning who stays unpolished but works her way through the ranks of the aristocracies.

With so many great period pieces out in the last 10+ years, I was concerned that one from nearly 40 years ago (!) would seem dated and be hard to watch.

It gives a good look at English life in the early nineteen hundreds from a particular point of view and has excellent performances by most if not all the actors.  The character of Louisa Trotter played by Gemma Jones is unique, sometimes inspiring, and sometimes even disappointing.  She is a realistic character.

2377051,3,B000A6T1X6,I've only watched 6 episodes so far - it is entertaining and a glimpse into the Brit way of life but sometimes the Duchess gets a little too overbearing. Starting as a scullery maid and becoming a biggie so quick is sort of a stretch but hey! gotta give her credit.

2377053,3,B000A6T1X6,It is just okay to me.  The main character is brash and the hotel in question is somewhat a place for men in that era to pick up women for the evening or 2.  I just didn't care for season 1 and will not watch others.,1375056000,,216,3.6739130434782608
2377054,4,B000A6T1X6,The television series is older but very entertaining. It does not have the up-to-date flash bang that the newer shows have. It does have a complexity of a well defined character development .,1374796800,,191,4.818181818181818
2377055,5,B000A6T1X6,This really is a charming series.  Brew a cup of tea & get comfortable.  Tonight I will watch the last episode of season two- I think that is all there is......I am a bit sad!,1374710400,,175,3.9714285714285715

2377057,5,B000A6T1X6,I really enjoyed Duchess of Duke st.  The actors were excellent and the story was very interesting. I wish there were more tv series like it. I am a fan of Downton Abby and can't wait for the next series to start. I also watched season 2 of Duchess of Duke Street and enjoyed it just as well. I feel sorry it is over.,1374624000,,317,3.953125

2377059,5,B000A6T1X6,"I've recently become enamored with British TV drama and ran across this series while searching on Kindle Prime.  I was hesitant at first because the series premiered in 1976 and I was afraid it would be outdated.  I was delighted to find out I was wrong.  The premise is like a version of Upstairs/Downstairs with ""Louisa Trotter"", the main character, who has worked her way up from a servant in an uperclass house to a renown cook and manager to the upscale Bentnick hotel.  Each episode revolves around Louisa (The Duchess) and the hotel guests and the staff. The roles of Louisa and staff for the most part remain the same each episode with the hotel guests changing.  Perhaps because it is a period piece, taking place from 1900 to the 1920's, after 37 years it holds up very well.  Gemma Jones as the Duchess delivers a wonderful performance and the supporting actors play well off of her. Costuming is wonderful and I enjoy the small glimpse of life in London at the turn of the 20th century.  I laughed, cried and sympathized and cheered with and for the characters.  At some point I will definitely watch this series again.",1374624000,,1131,4.62

2377061,5,B000A6T1X6,"I love this series so much, I watched it twice! Louisa is a self made women. She worked her way up from maid to cook, from cook to entrepreneur. She had help from a friend when she needed it most, but there is know doubt that she she was in charge of her own visions of success. She yells A LOT, but when her softer side shows through, the is something very endearing about her character. Her friend/lover is also a real looker. The other characters all have their twists and turns which makes this family affair always interesting. Sets and costumes are superb as well.",1374364800,,570,4.386792452830188

2377063,4,B000A6T1X6,"The thing that makes this series work is the acting. The writing is only okay, the production is period perfect, the direction is adequate. Given those aspects, the cast shines from top to bottom. There are moments that seem under-rehearsed, but the professionalism of each performer rises above such moments.",1374364800,,309,5.2

2377080,4,B000A6T1X6,"Once again the BBC captures our attention with a period piece that becomes addictive. Made long before Upstairs and Downstairs and the other popular series that followed this series is well worth viewing.. My wife and I watched both seasons in a week, such is the lure of this story of a common woman's rise to success in a world populated with blue bloods and aristocrats. The episodes covering WW1 and its aftermath produce some poignant moments and may produce a tear or two in sensitive people.
  Watch and enjoy.",1373760000,,517,4.733333333333333
2377081,3,B000A6T1X6,This series is okay...I keep watching and waiting for not sure what.  It is hard to see the heroine as a someone series with her accent.  She doesn't at all seem a lady in the part.  But I like the other characters in the series thus far.,1373500800,,238,4.0212765957446805

2377086,5,B000A6T1X6,I thoroughly enjoyed this series. The storey line and the acting was of the highest quality and each episode brought new adventures and excitement to the lives of characters. I wish more series of the same calibre were made these days.,1373155200,,235,4.7560975609756095

There was always a nice story line, the actors were personable, the clothing and settings excellently done; and I wish there were more!

2377102,5,B000A6T1X6,"Gemma Jones doesn't miss a step in her exhaustive performance as a woman who goes from the scullery to the drawing rooms of London society. As the younger cousin of ""Upstairs Downstairs"" it makes ""Downton Abbey"" appear as very thin stuff indeed. The writing is soapy and soppy but perfect for the genre. The period and food is picture perfect. The ensemble playing is a joy of performance with unforgettable characters coming to life before your eyes. Watching it in a marathon is like gorging on chocolates but irresistible. You'll find yourself in deep mourning when you watch the final episode but what a treat.",1372550400,,614,4.857142857142857
2377103,4,B000A6T1X6,"This is one of my favorite docudramas but it took a third attempt at watching before getting hooked. The cast and characters will reel you in(unknowingly) and it's sure you'll miss them when it's over. ""Charlie"" is my personal favorite. A complicated, yet uncomplicated guy. There's a steady stream, or undercurrent, of humor throughout. You'll need it for the life of these characters...
I was a little disappointed in the quality of the dvd. It was reformatted for widescreen t.v., causing details and characters to be partially cut out and insignificant details to zoom in! (I'll let the viewers find those on their own)
The filming of this series isn't as rich and full-bodied as it deserves, so evident during this era of film-making.",1372377600,,739,4.967741935483871
2377104,5,B000A6T1X6,As a teenager I watched the entire series and tapped it on VHS tapes.  It was one of the first BBC series that I watched.  I enjoyed it also because it had no commercials.,1372377600,,171,4.0

2377120,5,B000A6T1X6,"Duchess of Duke Street is fabulous. I loved the tie in of early 1900's history to this story of Louisa Trotter, master chef and hotelier. Each episode of this 2 season PBS Masterpiece Classic has a sub-plot to the entire series which starts with Louisa's desire to become the best cook in England and ends, well I won't give that away. Duchess of Duke Street is my all-time favorite PBS series.",1372032000,,394,4.563380281690141

2377123,5,B000A6T1X6,"An excellent cast creating multidimensional characters in an intriguing and inspiring story based on real events. Gemma Jones is
amazing as the Cockney cook who conquered England. It's also a glimpse into the world at the turn of the 20th century; English attitudes about social classes, and women roles, but a look, too , at how things were changing. I could watch this again and again!",1371686400,,387,4.878787878787879
2377124,5,B000A6T1X6,I really like this UK series.  It is different from the typical upstairs/downstairs approach as the heroine is from the working classes and has found a niche for herself.  Great acting,1371686400,,184,4.903225806451613
2377125,4,B000A6T1X6,Think of this series as a very early version of Downton Abbey.  It moves at a slower pace but you grow attached to the characters.,1371427200,,130,4.2

It is right up there with Downton  Abbey, and Upstairs Downstairs.  Love it",1371081600,,393,4.173333333333333

Remember more or less the plot of it but I was amazed at all the details that I had forgotten  The drama unfolds around the same period of the new series Downton Abbey but it focuses on the relations of the working class. Because of my interest on period films I appreciated the details given to clothing , lavish surrounding specially .

It was not the happiest life but she knew what she wanted out of life and pursued it with all her abilities. Ironically, she did not always allow others the same thing. Without giving away some of the important facts in the story she formed an odd sort of family in which she was the taskmaster and an unforgiving one at that if you did not meet her specifications. The Duchess of Duke Street is a glimpse of another time. I would recommend this show to anyone who enjoys an English drama.",1370131200,,638,4.153225806451613

It's a bit smarmy that this could happen but I shall not be one to state it couldn't or didn't.
I love the crusty part played by the Duchess.
Who wouldn't love seeing a woman back when, have the abilty to do as she pleases.
I havn't watched all of the seasons but I don't need to, to state my total enjoyment of a time past that a female handled life her way by hardest efforts.",1366761600,,579,4.178571428571429

The characters are very interesting, if you like people who struggle day in and out to make something of themselves....
The characters are always developing as the series continues, you get very involved in the fact that Louisa, who starts out with virtually nothing in her life going her way.....wants to be a chef.....a good chef...the best in London!! She is extremely clever in working hard, taking a beating in life from the people around her, especially her parents.....she's knocked down again and again and even with compassion she continues to succeed in life despite many many many obstacles...most of these obstacles would flatten the best of us....still she proceeds, this admire greatly as great character....This story is NOT soap-opera type in any sense of the words.....These are real, genuine people, with many character flaws.....as you watch them grow, some failing in their pursuits...some succeeding.....you can't help but get involved......
The actors are absolutely wonderful performers.....the best ever!!! Not once are you thinking, like most viewing I do of films, are the actors acting......what a beautiful treat to watch these episodes over and over....Thank You",1365206400,,1370,5.260273972602739

2377219,4,B000A6T1X6,"I came upon this series by accident and gave it a try. I gravitate toward period pieces.

The main character is indeed 'a character'.  Louisa isn't titled but she is allowed inside because of her skills as a cook. (A hard earned livelihood.)  While, at times the Louisa character is a bit 'over the top' with her loud, shrill voice, I found myself really caring about her happiness.  And the Charlie character is a nice balance for Louisa.  Their relationship is interesting and endearing. In fact, all the characters are well written and presented in various episodes.  This series was a pleasant find. If you liked Upstairs, Downstairs, and Downton Abbey you will probably enjoy this series.  It's not as polished but it is entertaining.",1364601600,,739,4.864

Audio management is somewhat worse than that captured with any parent's digi-cam at a high school production of ""Oklahoma"". Video quality? Well... after all... it was the BBC in the 70's.

Nonetheless, compared to most of today's network fare, the Duchess rocks. Several characters were wrought well enough to capture interest and entertain. And the story lines (largely centered on the comings and goings at Hotel Bentinck, circa 1900) are significantly more inventive.",1364515200,,626,5.26

As usual the BBC puts together a great period piece showing the ""downstairs"" life of servants vs the ""upstairs"".  The only problem is that the accents are so thick it is hard to understand all the words.

On nights that the show aired, I used to tuck my little ones in bed and then settle down for an hour of good TV.  When I ""rediscovered"" The Duchess of Duke Street on Amazon, I immediately started watching the first episode.  I was pleased to find that even though the show was made 37 years ago, and I (of course:-) am 37 years older, The Duchess is still gold.  I highly recommend it for anyone who doesn't have too much difficulty with a variety of English accents.

Her one love affair didn't end so well, so I'm hoping in season 2 she finds the right man and partner.  Some social issues of the time are also addressed.",1363737600,,533,4.688172043010753

If this is the way the rich acted and dressed, daily life was truly a stage play and each player going for broke with trying to upstage each other with stiff upper lips, noses in the air, and the feel of a tight knit family.  Fast food will never be the same as well as a normal family dinner. After viewing the food on the program, I'm ashamed of the simple parsley used as garnish on my platters.

But, in my opinion, what would be an interesting storyline is ignored, and unrelated storylines are highlighted--almost like something out a 1960s comedy show that relied on unrealistic scheming.

2377268,3,B000A6T1X6,"Season 1 was moderately interesting, season two was simply too boring.
I think that the authors while writing the script used fro the close reference, the work of Jerome K Jerome ""Stage-Land"", a hilarious guide to the clichs of late-Victorian theater, with cynical commentary on all of the character types and situations that plagued most plays of the era.

""She is very good, is the stage heroine.  The comic man expresses a belief that she is a born angel.
She reproves him for this with a tearful smile (it wouldn't be her smile if it wasn't tearful).
""Oh, no,"" she says (sadly of course); ""I have many, many faults.""
We rather wish that she would show them a little more.
Her excessive goodness seems somehow to pall upon us.
 Our only consolation while watching her is that there are not many good women off the stage.
 Life is bad enough as it is; if there were many women in real life as good as the stage heroine, it would be unbearable""

The Duchess of Duke Street is a terrific period drama wrought with all kinds of twists and turns, surprising incidents and sardonic humor. It is inspiring because despite her cultural trappings, Louisa was not limited or afraid. Rather, she is shrewd, pragmatic and focused. She had a dream to become the best ""cook"" in London and did what was necessary to get into the right places and realize her dream. In a world when men are in charge, she manages to befriend and gain the respect of many of them. She treated all men the same, including her lovers, servants and customers- with respect and dignity...

I rated the series at five stars because of the great script, the beautiful decor and fashion and the wonderful performances by the actors.

This is such a good series, well acted and the sets/locations look and feel genuine.

The surrounding characters and plots are all full of idiosyncrasies and a little whimsey  - at the same time totally believable both as a period piece and as well observed examples of human nature.

I'm just having a lot of trouble considering her a beauty. She's not very attractive in this at all. Also I'm not liking how cheaply made it looks. It looks just like The Young Ones. It reminds me of a stage show. Finally, Gemma Jones speaks so loudly that I'm more annoyed than interested. I'm going to go out on a limb and guess that she was once a great stage actress?

I liked her steely determination to be the ""best cook in London"", that was the admirable thing about her, and I respected her temper and outspokenness, but my admiration was undermined by this unbelievable premise that men would fall head over heels for her at first sight. Wow. It just doesn't fly. And so no matter how good the representation of the era, if the story doesn't ring true, interest wanes. Mine did by the end of the second episode--the very thing I admired most about this plain Jane with the irritating voice was her unwillingness to compromise, but then she compromised.

2377318,5,B000A6T1X6,"The Duchess of Duke Street was a BBC period drama set in London circa 1900-1925. The lead character, Louisa Trotter, was played by Gemma Jones, an actress who made the role her own, and mesmerised audiences in the role of a maid who works her way up to becoming a famous cook and eventually the proprietress of the Bentinck Hotel in London. This story is loosely based on the real-life Rosa Lewis who managed the Cavendish Hotel in London.

In the first season, we are introduced to the cast of characters, with Gemma Jones in the lead role of Louisa Trotter. She plays a fiercely determined, independent, strong-willed woman who is bent on making a success of herself. She wants to be the most famous cook in London, and gets employed in the household of Lord Henry Norton, to the detriment of his French chef. But Louisa's determination sees Monsieur Alex relenting and eventually developing a grudging admiration for her cooking skills. Louisa's attractiveness garners her the attentions of many men - ranging from her employer's nephew, Charlie Tyrrell[Christopher Cazenove], to the household's butler, Gus Trotter [Donald Burton], and even the Prince of Wales himself!

This first season sees Louisa's struggle to get to the top - she is pressured to marry the butler, Gus, a disastrous union, and eventually finds herself getting the lease on the Bentinck Hotel, and making a name for herself as a famous hostess in London society. There are many light-hearted episodes here, and also poignant ones - and the wonderful co-stars make the show truly enjoyable - there is the porter, Starr [John Cater] who insists that his little terrier Fred works alongside him, the very old but steady waiter, Merryman [John Welsh], Louisa's steadfast friend and employee, Mary Phillips [Victoria Plucknett], and Major Toby [Richard Vernon], a gentleman who has fallen on hard times, but is brought into the fold of the Bentinck family.

Those who love period dramas will love this series, and not just for the high quality of the acting. The attention to period details is wonderfully authentic, and the sets and location shots are beautifully done, given the time this series was made, circa 1970s. All in all, highly recommended.",1350777600,,2222,4.9838274932614555

2377322,5,B000A6T1X6,"After the hugely-successful ""Upstairs Downstairs"" came to an end, writer/producer John Hawkesworth crossed over to the BBC to create another weekly period series, THE DUCHESS OF DUKE STREET, set against the backdrop of London in the Edwardian era, leading up to the outbreak of the First World War.  The series was partially-based on hotelier Rosa Lewis, the legendary Chef de Cuisine and owner of London's Cavendish Hotel.

For a woman, unmarried and with no independent fortune to support her, London can be a dangerous place.  Armed only with a fierce determination, Louisa Leyton (Gemma Jones) aims to become the greatest cook in the city - if not the entire country.  Studying under the supervision of esteemed society chef Monsieur Alex (George Pravda), Louisa learns the tricks of the trade, but, against her better judgement, finds herself pressured to get married, if only for the fact that most lady cooks, for respectability's sake, go under the moniker of ""Mrs"".  Thus, Louisa Leyton becomes Louisa Trotter, but her husband, former butler Augustus (Donald Burton) hits the bottle when his wife's career overshadows his own small ambitions - to say nothing of Louisa's clandestine affair with no less than the Prince of Wales himself!  Louisa believes she has found the ideal solution to their various problems when she takes over the lease of the Bentinck Hotel in Duke Street - there, Augustus can take the spotlight as manager whilst Louisa whips up her culinary marvels in the kitchen, but it's not long until Augustus begins abusing his power, driving the business into the ground by squandering most of the profits on drink.  Louisa throws him out, and with her usual ""roll your sleeves up, just get on with it"" attitude, attempts to turn the fortunes of the Bentinck around single-handed...

Series 1 of THE DUCHESS OF DUKE STREET takes a few episodes to properly gather momentum, but pretty soon you'll be hooked on the daily dramas of Louisa, her staff and the various guests of the Bentinck.  Gemma Jones was born to play Louisa, the steel-cast ""duchess"" of the title.  The character can often be quite unsympathetic and rough-edged at times, and it's largely thanks to Ms Jones' performance that she remains so ""likeable"" despite her harsher moments.

Co-starring as the Bentinck's unflappable staff are Victoria Plucknett (Mary the chamber-maid and Louisa's long-time confidante), John Welsh (elderly waiter Merriman), John Cater (doorman Mr Starr); and Richard Vernon (Major Smith-Barton, the hotel's main permanent guest).  Christopher Cazenove is Lord Charlie Haslemere, Louisa's great love.

In addition to John Hawkesworth, THE DUCHESS OF DUKE STRET also reunited several of the ""Upstairs Downstairs"" scriptwriters (Rosemary Anne Sisson, Jeremy Paul), composer Alexander Faris; and directors (Bill Bain, Simon Langton, Raymond Menmuir).",1339891200,,2864,5.28193832599119

I have the feeling Amazon is being the Trojan horse of the streaming industry, drawing users away from Netflix, then moving titles to pay-per-view (as is the case here). Once Amazon becomes a popular venue, the content providers can simply remove titles from Netflix (which they have done with this show).

I love it more this second time around for its' sheer quality of production, acting, furnishings and dressing, all of which are absolutely first class. Louisa Layton is a working class girl of humble background who is determined to raise her place in life by becoming the first famous female cook in a world dominated by men. Under the tutelage of a French chef, she does exactly this and, while working as a free lance cook, comes under the notice of Edward, Prince of Wales. A notorious womaniser, Edward insists that his ladies are always married, thus avoiding a scandal should any ""little"" accident ocurr, and so a marriage is arranged between Louisa and Gus Trotter, the butler of one of Edward's friends. Louisa at first objects strongly to the whole idea but is overwhelmed by royal attention and the promise that she would always be under the royal protection, even when the affair faded. With the money earned from her working as a top chef under royal patronage, she buys The Bentinck, a private hotel where she allows only the cream of Society to be guests. After a brief and disastrous marriage to Gus the butler (who squanders all of her money)she meets and is given financial backing by Charles, Viscount Tyrell, later Lord Hazelmere, and a passionate love affair begins. Louisa has Charles' daughter, Lottie, who is boarded out with a couple on his estate in Yorkshire, while Louisa and Charlie agree to have just a friendship as he lives almost permanently at the Bentinck and their love affair is too disruptive to her business life. Charlie is also aware of his need to marry and provide an official heir. I am now waiting impatiently for Series 2 to be released here on DVD, so that I may continue to enjoy the lives of the guests and staff of the Bentinck and to continue to drool over the magnificent gowns worn by Louisa, which are gems of perfection to anyone who has a love of fine costuming in movies.",1180742400,4,2074,4.653950953678474

2377361,5,B000A6T1X6,"I loved it. I really enjoyed watching this DVD. Very good dialogues, very well acted and a very interesting issue. A very strong woman at the beginning of the 20th century shows us that is possible to get our dreams. I recommend it.",1168473600,10,232,4.4186046511627906
2377362,5,B000A6T1X6,"I've just seen series 1 for the first time and was quite impressed. Considering that it was filmed 30 years ago it managed to hold my interest. I generally don't like tv/films from that era due to the inferior quality of production and lack of historical accuracy. However, Duchess manages to look authentic despite some minor filming flaws and being done mostly on stage-like sets. The most important feature is the first rate acting by all the stars. Gemma Jones provides a strong performance that binds everything together. The supporting roles and guest appearances also seem genuine and intriguing. At no point did I feel restless when the main star is absent from a scene or episode since so many unique aspects of life during the Edwardian period are explored. The dialogue and behaviors seem to be consistent with the period. I find it fascinating that much of the plot was derived from real life events. As for the DVD - the quality of the show seems clear with a few flaws here and there. Meaning, at the beginning of one episode I noticed a blur/contrast in a partial scene, but in general seems ok. A continuity error was spotted at the beginning of episode 12 - (As the major enters Trotter's office the view out the door is not of the hotel lobby as usual, but seems to be a modern city street?) Someone mentioned the lack of subtitles, however my dvd had closed captioning which your tv has to have as an option and needs to be turned on to view. Only the first disc has a few special features, mostly textual background info. Overall, very enjoyable with much emphasis on the wonderful acting and unique plot lines.",1166313600,15,1631,4.627586206896551
2377363,5,B000A6T1X6,"For lack of anything interesting to watch on TV, I checked out The Duchess of Duke Street from my local library on a whim and was blown away by the quality of the production - the storylines, writing, acting, and direction are all top-notch. The series really does represent the very best of Masterpiece Theater.  From the first episode, my husband and I were engrossed in Louisa's story and by the time we finished watching the final episode of Series 2, it was almost like losing a member of the family, so attached had we grown to the characters. Throughout the series, Louisa and the permanent residents of the Bentnick Hotel provide countless memorable moments, some hilariously amusing and others serious, sad, and thought provoking, all the while highlighting the historical context of the period. Each of the 31 episodes more or less stands alone, but there are overarching storylines, most notably the love affair between Louisa and Lord Haslemere.  As captivating as Louisa is, her character would not be as appealing without the presence of the handsome and ever charming Lord Haslemere.  Their tragic romance reminded me of another heartbreaking couple on film, Fanny Brice and Nick Arnstein in Funny Girl.  I can't praise this series highly enough.  It is a treat from beginning to end, and I would urge anyone who enjoys a well-told and superbly acted story to watch it.",1165363200,8,1384,4.92274678111588
2377364,4,B000A6T1X6,"My problem was not with the story or the characters.  They were great.  My problem was understanding the duchess's heavy cockney accent, and I missed much of what she said.  That would have been no problem had their been sub-titles.  None.  That really disappointed me, since I suppose I expected it on DVD.  Since i had the whole set in video, I expected the DVD to have subtitles.  It didn't.  Also scenes have been cut. The format of a DVD is certainly easier to use than video, but sometimes you do lose some of the story line with the easier access.  Too bad.  But that's what happens with lots of DVD's and I don't know why.",1162252800,5,630,4.353448275862069
2377365,5,B000A6T1X6,"Produced and co-written by John Hawkesworth (best known for his role as producer and co-writer of Upstairs Downstairs), The Duchess of Duke Street (which was produced between 1978 and 1980) tells the story of Louisa Leyton Trotter, a young Cockney woman from a working-class background with aspirations of becoming the finest cook in London. The series open in 1900, with Louisa landing a job as a cooking assistant to one of London's finest chefs. It's the chance of a lifetime for her, but her outspokenness threatens to be her downfall.

Nevertheless, she indeed rises to become a first-rate and much-sought-after cook and the proprietor of London's exclusive and very expensive Bentinck Hotel on Duke Street. Louisa owes much to Bertie, the Prince of Wales, with whom she has a brief affair. But she owes the bulk of her success to her own hard work and determination. The series spans some 30 years, throughout which we are privy to everything the hotel has to offer--from encounters involving aristocrats to the personal problems of the servants. Of course, it is Louisa's life that is at the forefront, and she must make some tough choices as she deals with crises of her own at both a professional and a personal level.

A feisty and independent young woman, Louisa is more than capable of taking care of herself, and she's played to absolute perfection by Gemma Jones. So convincing is she as Louisa Trotter that it's impossible to imagine anyone else in the role. As a point of interest, the character was based on a real-life individual named Rosa Lewis, a mistress of the Prince of Wales who set up a London hotel called the Cavendish. She died in 1952 and was personally known to John Hawkesworth.

Louisa is joined by a motley group at the hotel. The oldest servant, a butler named Mr. Merriman, came with the hotel when she bought it. He's a perennially wingeing old codger who one expects will keel over at any given moment. Then there's the new doorman, the mysterious Mr. Starr, with his trademark squeaky shoes and fox terrier Fred (upon whose supposedly unerring judgement Starr bases his opinion of potential guests!). Another fixture on the show is the Major (Richard Vernon of Sandbaggers), a decent and well-connected but destitute old war horse for whom the Bentinck has become home. Of course, one mustn't forget Louisa's right hand, the devoted Welsh servant, Mary; or Charlie Tyrrell, Lord Haslemere, a man with a permanent residence at the Bentinck and to whom Louisa owes much. In addition to the regulars, fans of British television will enjoy guest appearances by Robert Hardy (All Creatures), Anthony Andrews (Brideshead Revisited), and Joanna David, amongst others.

In conclusion, the entire series is available on two dvd boxed sets, and it is one of the best period dramas ever produced. Fans of British period dramas in general--of shows like Upstairs Downstairs, for example--are sure to enjoy it. But I'd go so far as to recommend it to anyone looking for a captivating, well-written, and consummately-acted series. This truly is quality entertainment at its very best!",1155081600,115,3109,4.961612284069098
2377366,4,B000A6T1X6,"The unfortunate lower class circumstance, and how it was so often manipulated to the benefit of the upper class, is the thematic backdrop to this John Hawkesworth series. In the same vein as other soap-opera-type dramas of the 70's, this one will hook you at the first episode, and have you calling up your local librarian to scout out the elusive Series 2.

Strictly speaking, I am not a fan of ""based-on real life story"" t.v., but this is a winning example of quality BBC dramatic production. So much was done right in the way of depicting the social mores and economic conditions of the early 1900's, that the viewer feels sympathy for the trials and tribulations of the characters; but humor is not left out.  There are some hilarious exchanges between the porter Starr (John Cater) and head waiter Merriman (John Welsh), and Gemma Jones does not disappoint as the headstrong hotel proprietor Louisa Trotter.  Historical significance of the times is not merely implied. Political events such as the rising of the suffragette movement to the national mourning at King Edward's death are woven into the storylines of the episodes themselves. Overall, a very enjoyable series.",1149724800,9,1177,4.964467005076142
2377385,5,B000A6T1X6,"After I spied this series on my local library's shelves & saw that it was about a female aspiring chef set in 1900-1910 London, I scooped up all the volumes.
This series really surprised me: It has strong writing and attention to setting. Louisa Trotter is a outspoken, cockney chef who works her way up in her profession and British society with lots of elbow grease, an understanding of human nature, and some luck. Gemma Jones is great as Louisa Trotter and the supporting cast is very solid as well.
I wasn't sure at first if this series was a miniseries or a TV series (It's TV), but it is rather Dickensian in that each episode builds on the previous. And I can pay a series no higher complement than to say that the conflict resolutions are neither trite nor perfunctory. Many allusions to historically accurate events, politicians, and contemporary culture are weaved into the storylines. I feel that I learned more about English classism and social mores from the ""Duchess"" & the Bentinck Hotel than from my semester abroad in London.
If you like period drama (and comedy) & strong, nuanced heroines with many battles to fight, then you will like ""The Duchess of Duke Street."" This series stands the test of time. My only complaint is that I did not learn much about the culinary arts, but the writing is so above standard that my complaint is rendered inconsequential.
Although this series began filming in 1976 the production values make it difficult to place. The Duchess of Duke Street is comparable in quality to BBC's 1979 Pride and Prejudice.",1148169600,39,1558,4.752767527675276
2377386,5,B000A6T1X6,Well we have only waited ages for this to come to DVD. How long do we have to wait for part two of this excellent drama that captures what is was really like in Edwardian England. Gemma Jones does her best work in this series based upon a real life character Rosa Lewis of the Cavendish Hotel. The series owes its greatness not only to the actors but to creator John Hawkesworth the former producer of Upstairs Downstairs. If you like Drama this is a must have DVD set.,1145318400,4,469,4.280898876404494

When you put in a disc, you do not have the ""play all"" option, either.

You have to view each episode one at a time.  That's a bad menu choice.

2377390,4,B000A6T1X6,"""The Duchess of Duke Street"" is the first series I remember watching on Masterpiece Theater, on PBS. Considering I was 8 or 9 at the time it aired, I think that's pretty fantastic. My mom and step-dad regularly watched programs on PBS, but nothing up to that point interested me. Perhaps it was the budding Anglophile which drew me to the series.  I think a large part of what kept me interested was the strong performance by Gemma Jones as Louisa Trotter, a woman in Victorian England, who works very hard to make a living, dealing with many difficulties as she builds an exclusive hotel from the ground up.

The series, originally shown in 1976, was recently released on DVD and it is a welcome addition. Involving stories, great acting, attention to period detail and a story spanning decades helped to create one of the most memorable British television series ever. Watching it again on DVD, I was struck by a number of things. The first is the series is very long. Long for British Television. When the creator of a British television series goes to work, they generally create 6 or 8, maybe 10, infrequently as many as 12 episodes at a time. Each time they go in front of the cameras, they are creating a new ""Series""; British shows are measured in terms of series, some add new series every year, some do a couple of series, take some time off and then return a few years later, presumably after some fresh inspiration. Some shows, like ""Fawlty Towers"" run for 12 episodes and that's it. So watching ""The Duchess of Duke Street"" again, I was struck that the series includes 31 episodes, more than a traditional ""season"" on U. S. television. Also, they only did one series. Perhaps Gemma Jones was exhausted.

The series begins with Louisa interviewing with a famous French chef in a large household. The chef is dubious, but Louisa convinces him to give her a try. Soon, he is happy and her place is secure. She begins to soak up information like a sponge. The Head of the House returns from vacation early, while the Chef is still away, and Louisa has to put together a meal quickly. She comes through with flying colors, attracting the attention of one of the guests, the Prince of Wales. They begin an affair, but the Prince can not be seen consorting with a common chef, so an elaborate ruse is created. Louisa will marry the Head Butler. In exchange, they will receive a nice home and ""assistance"". The Prince will continue to meet Louisa in secret. Along the way, she meets Charlie Tyrrel (Christopher Cazenove), a member of the royal family, and the definition of `playboy.' Their initial meeting doesn't go well. Soon, the prince becomes King Edward and a new era in England begins. Their relationship ends and Louisa decides to open the Bentink Hotel on Duke Street, catering to a very exclusive clientele. During a difficult period, Charlie convinces her to let him lease a suite of rooms, for his use, and helps her keep the hotel open. She will only take in the most exclusive clients, hire the most discerning staff and build a grand reputation. Over the years, Louisa and Charlie develop a relationship which creates a sort of roller coaster ride of its own.

A lot of the power of ""Duchess"" comes from Gemma Jones performance. Louisa is very strong, able to deal with any of the many problems and situations dealt her throughout her life. A working class girl who recognizes there is more to life than doing laundry or scrubbing floors, she wants to become a cook, despite the scarcity of female chefs in the country, and gets a job with a renowned chef. Working hard, struggling, she learns as much as possible. Soon, she becomes head of her own kitchen, but then the Prince of Wales enters her life and her career ends. Forced into an arranged marriage, for the sake of propriety, she continues to see the Prince of Wales and her husband becomes more and more irritated by the constraints of their marriage. Louisa puts up with very little, but she endures her husband for longer than she should.

After they decide to open the Bentink, against Louisa's better judgment, she begins to see the benefits and puts her all into this project as well. When her husband almost runs it into the ground, she runs him off and struggles to pay off his debts.

The key to Jones performance is she is a very strong woman. She doesn't take a lot of guff and is unwilling to compromise herself or her life for anyone. She doesn't suffer fools gladly. On the rare occasion she does let down her guard, it almost always causes another problem. You might think that she would become even more stoic, even more guarded, and, to a certain extent, she does, but she also still occasionally makes mistakes, adding more problems and drama to her life. In other words, she is human. And Jones does a remarkable job of creating this character, presenting her as a strong-willed woman, capable of making mistakes, but also capable of fixing them.

The two supporting characters who influence her life the most are Charlie and her husband. Both are played well, but Christopher Cazenove has the more romantic, dashing role of becoming Louisa's love.

Another thing that struck me as I watched the series again was that some situations were resolved very quickly, too quickly in some cases. The series runs for 31 episodes, so there is time for the narrative to take its course. It isn't necessary to rush the story. In one episode, Louisa learns she is pregnant. In the next scene, the Hotel staff is making due with her absence while on `vacation'. We learn that her vacation was a ruse to cover her extended stay at a hospital, where she has had a daughter and given her up for adoption. We never meet the daughter, never even see Louisa pregnant, and after this Louisa only mentions the daughter again, very briefly, in a much later episode. Perhaps unwanted pregnancies were taken care of this way in Edwardian England, but the series was shown in the mid-70s, at the height of the Woman's Power movement. It would seem a little more helpful, empowering and more to actually see Louisa deal with this problem in a little more detail.

When the character played by the star takes a ""vacation"", or is ""on assignment"", leaving the action to focus on supporting characters, it means one of two things. The star is either directing the episode and can't be in both places at once, or they needed a break. This happens three times over the course of ""Duchess"". I think the length of the project, and the fact that Jones is in practically every scene of the series, caused her to need an occasional break. So, at one point Louisa is on `vacation', getting a much needed rest. On another, she is off to France to cook a meal for a client. Unfortunately, Louisa is the force of the series, driving everything else. When she isn't around, the supporting characters do an admirable job, but the show is much less captivating and a lot less interesting. These characters are simply not as engaging as Louisa. An episode concerning an affair between a man and women, whom we have just met, proves particularly annoying. Thankfully, these are few and far between.

The series is only slightly dated. The credits and titles are very rudimentary, screaming their origin during the mid 70s. Also, on the few occasions when the story moves outdoors, the footage seems shot with another system completely. If they shot the interior footage on film (which I don't believe to be the case), it looks like the exterior footage was shot on video. The two don't mesh and haven't held up well, so even the interior footage looks slightly glossy, like it was created on early generation video.

These few complaints aside, ""The Duchess of Duke Street"" is a great series to watch. Gemma Jones gives a forceful, fascinating performance as one of the strongest-willed women you might ever encounter in a series filled with great attention to detail, presenting a fascinating portrait of life in Edwardian England.",1140480000,39,7985,4.684248039914469

2377392,5,B000A6T1X6,"While for me ""Upstairs,Downstairs"" remains the finest Masterpiece Theatre series of all time, this one runs it a close second.  Gemma Jones is superb as Louisa Trotter, the Cockney Cook/Hotelienne who never loses her blunt common-sense ways or her heavy cockney accent even after she becomes Hostess to Edwardian England's Rich and Famous.  The earlier episodes focus on Louisa's rise from assistant cook to mistress of the Prince of Wales (later King Edward VII).  But most of the series concerns the doings at the Bentinck Hotel, an exclusive, private establishment in London owned and run by Louisa.  With few exceptions, one's family has to have been listed in Debrett's Peerage for at least 100 years before one can book a room at the Bentinck.  And yet, Louisa's selectivity is not so much a reflection of snobbery on her part as it is of her passionate commitment to being The Best at whatever she does.

Thee entire series is rich in characters and incident, and in fact Jones/Louisa is very much in the background in several of the episodes.  But she is unquestionably the dominant, and dominating, character in this series.  You haven't seen Unbridled Righteous Indignation until you've seen Louisa, in the last episode in this collection, testifying at trial on behalf of her friend, Lord Haslemere, pouring forth diatribe after diatribe in all her cockney glory.  Now THAT'S a Character!

This wonderful series deserves to be much better known than it is.  Do not hesitate to acquire this set.  I can't wait for Series 2!",1135728000,8,1533,4.9453125
