2398938,5,B000B0WO58,"We have most of the Scholastic videos and this is one of the best.  The only dud to us is the Old Lady Who Swallowed a Fly--the concept seems dated, and it didn't make any sense to our four year old.  But we loved the rest.  The 2 that are billed as ""bonus features"" are actually outstanding.  ""I Want A Dog"" is wonderful--a delightful story with unbelievably good music sung by Neko Case.  Our daughter has requested it repeatedly, and we I can't blame her.",1146009600,3,458,4.341176470588235
2398939,5,B000B0WO58,Received as a gift and currently looking for more titles in the scholastic collection. Dem Bones had my daughter dancing. Over in the meadow just made you feel good about the world. Highly recommend. All the stories/music were fantastic.,1139184000,7,237,5.102564102564102
2398940,1,B000B0WO58,This video was so painful. My 22mo old daughter and I couldn't even finish the whole thing. What a waste of $.,1262995200,,110,4.045454545454546
2398941,4,B000B0WO58,Our 18 month old son was obsessed with watching youtube videos of Wheels on the Bus and we wanted to get a DVD so he wouldn't hold up the computer.  We purchased this not really sure what to expect.  We are pleased with the video as well as the 2 additional shows that are on it that we didn't know were on it (one is about a girl who really wants a dog...very cute story).  We just wish there were more we could buy but apparently the only other ones are story book reads.,1259020800,,473,4.01063829787234
2398942,5,B000B0WO58,"My 18 month old daughter has a Wheels on the Bus book which she loves so I thought she might like the DVD.  Well, she LOVES the dvd and watches it over and over on a daily basis.  She especially loves the part where it says ""the babies on the bus go wah wah wah...""  And ""the mommies on the bus go shhh shhh shhh...""  That part cracks her up every time! After the first few days I was singing this song in my sleep, it is just so darn catchy, haha...  (Thanks Bacon Bros.)

And in case you're not aware, Scholastic VIDEOS are basically Scholastic BOOKS brought to life by animating their original illustrations and by adding narration and music.

My Daughter is not too into the other five videos (4 older classics - ""The Wheels"", ""Dem Bones"", ""I know an Old Lady"", and ""Over in the Meadow"" + 2 bonus newer ones - ""I Want a Dog"" and ""Chinese Violin"" = 6 total vids) but I think it's just because of her age and I'm sure in another few months or so she'll be enjoying at least a few others and hopefully all of them after that...  This is a DVD that can grow with your child from ages 18 months to 3 or 4 years old at least.

To be honest though, for the great amount of enjoyment she get's out of watching only ""The Wheels..."" video, I think it's worth every penny!

I particularly enjoy the bonus videos, ""I Want a Dog"" and ""Chinese Violin"" they are both very cute and clever in different ways.",1257638400,,1395,4.152416356877324
2398943,4,B000B0WO58,The version of Wheels on the Bus on this video is definately jazzy.  My son still loves it!,1243814400,,91,4.055555555555555
2398944,5,B000B0WO58,"As a Paraprofessional in a Charter School, I work with children with disabilities.  Having a problem grabbing the interest of a down syndrome child, I decided to play this DVD.  It caught his attention immediately.
After playing the DVD (Wheels on the Bus) for many showings, the child
began to sing various parts of the song.  This was the first time he
sang over the one year period I worked with him.  The DVD served a
developmental need.",1239926400,,441,4.615384615384615
2398945,4,B000B0WO58,I bought this video for my 2 year old daughter and she loves it. Thank goodness it is on DVD because I think she would wear the picture off of a VHS tape she watches it so much. Very glad I found this DVD for her.,1234742400,,213,3.652173913043478
2398946,4,B000B0WO58,Our daughter enjoys this DVD. Sort of slow but the wheels & Dem Bones are super cute.,1231804800,,85,4.0588235294117645
2398947,5,B000B0WO58,"My 18 month old loves this dvd.  He brings us the remote and says ""Dem Bones Dem Bones"", because he likes the second track so much!  Great DVD.",1222646400,,143,4.071428571428571
2398948,5,B000B0WO58,"I am so glad I got this DVD for my 2.5 year old- he LOVES it, and I enjoy it too.  The animation in the four main songs is so well done and really diverse so each 'skit' feels completely unique.  My son especially loves 'The Wheels on the Bus' and 'Dem Bones' and I hear him humming the tunes even long after we've watched the DVD.  The extras are just so-so as I think they are skewed for older kids (5+) whereas the main four are very well suited for the 2-4 age group.  I even think older kids would enjoy it!  A great find.",1222041600,,527,3.9339622641509435
2398949,1,B000B0WO58,"The weirdest dvd ever made for children!

Felt as if the people responsible for making this dvd were doing drugs while making it.

Also, there are only 4 songs on this dvd.

I was very dissapointed and my child showed absolutely no intrest.",1221091200,2,240,4.534883720930233
2398950,5,B000B0WO58,I rented this product from a library for my two year on grandchild  and she absolutely loved it and did not want to take it back. I tried to buy it from them  and they recommend amazon com. to purchase it from. She watches it three or four times a day and sings and dances with it. I highly recommend every grandparent or parent purchase one.,1215388800,,342,4.166666666666667
2398951,4,B000B0WO58,"This includes Paul O. Zelinsky's The Wheels on the Bus, Dem Bones by Rob Barner, Over in the Meadow by John Langstaff (illustrated by Feodor Rojankovsky, who did an exceptionally lovely job), and I Know an Old Lady Who Swallowed a Fly by Rose Bonne and Alan Mills and sung by the great Burl Ives.  My almost two year old loves The Wheels on the Bus and will not move when it is on.  She also adores the book, which is simply magical, and sold seperately.  She does not care for the other three yet, these are for slightly older kids, maybe closer to four years old.  The production values on all are okay, not great, but the illustrations and stories are lively and imaginative.",1214006400,3,678,4.4
2398952,3,B000B0WO58,"It is an OK DVD.  My grandson doesn't like all the songs on the DVd, the 3rd one is too slow, he likes faster pace songs.",1200614400,,121,3.6538461538461537
2398953,5,B000B0WO58,"We own over 20 Scholastic Video dvd's and The Wheels on the Bus is one of our favorites.  We first got it from the library and my daughter just loved it.  She was so thrilled when I bought in on-line.  This dvd has 6 stories.  The main 4 stories are sung.  The first extra story (I Want A Dog) is read, but it does have a song a couple of times in it.  The last story is just read; no songs at all.

The Wheels on the Bus is based on the book by Paul Zelinsky.  When my oldest daughter, now 15, was little we had this book.  It's a really neat moving parts book.  I am now looking for it for my 4 year old.  The story on the dvd is animated and just like the pictures in the book.

Dem Bones is kind of educational; at the end a narrators voice talks about all the bones of the skeleton and then the song is sung again.  This one is also animated.

Over in the Meadow is my favorite and it's so cute to hear my daughter try to sing along.  I like the song/melody so much that I ordered the book by the same author and illustrator (we'll be able to sing it and see the pictures without always having to put the dvd in).  This story, on the dvd, has very little animation; mostly just still shots of the pictures from the book.

I Know An Old Lady Who Swallowed A Fly is an old one from 1964; before I was born.  The animation is the old cartoonish style.  This is sung by Burl Ives.  It's not one of my favorites....but I've never been overly crazy about that story anyway.

I Want a Dog is another one of my favorites on this dvd.  There is a song in the story and it's great.  I find myself singing it throughout the day after we've watched it (boy, do I gotta get out, or what??).  It is a very catchy song.  This has cute animation and is very colorful.  I think I'll have to try to find this book also to add to our collection.

The Chinese Violin is probably my least favorite on this dvd, only because I'm not crazy with the illustrations.  This is animated also.  The violin is totally different than the typical violin that you might think of, so that always sparks my child to tell me that it's not a real violin (to which, of course, I have to explain that it's just a different kind).  The voice, I believe, is a child.  He sounds like an Asian boy and I do like the voice of the narrator...it goes very well with the story.  It is a bit long and my daughter often doesn't sit through it.

Overall, I think this dvd is a great one to add to your collection.  I know it will be a favorite with us for a long time.  You can also put the words on the screen so you can sing along, which is nice.  Some of our other favorite Scholastic dvd's are Chrysanthemum, Swimmy, Harry the Dirty Dog, and Bark George.",1200355200,6,2713,4.01498127340824
2398954,1,B000B0WO58,"The songs are sung in a down voice ( not upbeat ).
The cartoon drawings are not cute and not happy.

Very few songs, and  not all are popular songs.",1195084800,6,148,3.9
2398955,5,B000B0WO58,"I ordered this dvd, sight unseen, for a number of reasons.  First, it is put out by Scholastic and after having been a teacher for 23 yrs. and a Mom about 40 yrs.  I have had a LOT of experience with Scholastic and  I've never been disappointed yet!  I also like the Bacon brothers but they weren't necessarily a selling point.  This was sent to my grandson (2 1/2yrs)living in GA, I'm in NY.  I visited a few weeks ago and we sat and watched it for the first time.  We did ALL the hand motions and sang ALL the words.  Then we watched it again, and again, and again, and so on.  The extra of the little girl wanting a dog was priceless, I loved it!  This is a terrific dvd.",1194566400,2,674,4.037878787878788
2398956,3,B000B0WO58,"Maybe somewhere it tells an age category for this DVD but I missed it and bought it for a one-year old. This is way too advanced for a one year old - even one who knows the wheels song - The song is much too long and too many ""musical interludes"" between verses. Maybe for older children.",1193702400,2,288,4.0701754385964914
2398957,5,B000B0WO58,"I originally borrowed this DVD from our public library, and my two-year-old liked it so much that I bought it for her third birthday.  She watches it a few times a week, and it's one of those rare kids' sing-alongs that I don't mind listening to over and over, either.  My 'tween doesn't even mind it, and that's really saying something!

My little one usually asks me to replay the title song, which I was surprised to learn is performed by The Bacon Brothers Band---actor Kevin Bacon and his brother Michael.  It's a very pleasant song, and it has me looking into more of their music.  (They also perform the title song on Sandra Boynton's ""Dog Train"" CD, and they have their own adult-music CDs.)

We enjoy ""Dem Bones,"" ""I Want a Dog,"" and ""The Chinese Violin,"" and Burl Ives' version of ""I Know an Old Lady"" makes me laugh out loud at the end.  My personal favorite is ""Over in the Meadow,"" which also makes a great lullaby.",1193097600,5,928,4.455621301775148
2398958,4,B000B0WO58,"Yeah another gift! My son loves this DVD. Naturally, the songs are a little different from what he is used to, but it gets the job done.",1190419200,3,136,4.074074074074074

2398960,5,B000B0WO58,"We have watched most of the Scholastic Video Collection DVDs and own a few.  We just borrowed this one in the library and my daughter said this is her favorite.  I think is my favorite too.  All the stories are very appropriate for little kids, nothing objectionable (like could be the case in other DVDs in the series which may have good stories with others you do not want your kids watching).  This one is a keeper!",1188000000,,418,4.3896103896103895
2398961,5,B000B0WO58,"My 4 year old enjoys music. So, this classic was worth buying.  He really likes trying to sing and dance to (Dem Bones) while watching the animation.  Fun for the entire family.",1181433600,,177,4.5
2398962,5,B000B0WO58,"My three year old adores this DVD.  (As well as my older kids, but they won't admit it!).  He asks to watch it every single day.  Each song/story is beautiful and captivating in it's own way.  The only story he doesn't like is the ""Chinese Violin""; it just doesn't interest him. (I'm not crazy about it, either).  The arrangement on ""Wheels On The Bus"" is especially awesome, I find myself humming it all day.",1181347200,2,409,4.472972972972973

2398964,5,B000B0WO58,I'm a special ed teacher for K-1 and my students love these videos.  They add a visual depth to these classic stories.  Don't forget to view the extras and you can also have the words displayed as well.  I find them invaluable for illuminating literature.  Most stories are no more than 7-10 minutes long and so are great for getting students involved quickly. Well worth the price.  Students ask for them over and over again. Get the books too and students begin to engage with the books and get excited keeping up with the video.,1172361600,3,531,4.5473684210526315

'Dem Bones, Over in the Meadow, There was and Old Lady Who swallowed a fly. Then the stories...""I Want a Dog"" is so cute. My daughter, 2 1/2 copies the whole DVD and gets better every day.

2398966,5,B000B0WO58,"I am an ESL teacher living in Spain. I use this sing along DVD to teach children to read in English, because it has the read along option. My students enjoy the wheels on The Bus video so much, that I have planned some lessons around different songs. For example today we are going to finish learning  ""Dem Bones"". Students will cut out and assemble a paper skeleton. Then they will fill in the blanks on a worksheet with the names of the bones. Another song that all my classes enjoy is ""I Want a Dog"". They just can't get enough of it.",1168473600,2,537,4.213592233009709

2398968,5,B000B0WO58,"I was fearful when I purchased my first Scholastic Video that the interpretations would somehow sully the original books for my son, or alter their meaning.  The animation, the songs, the voices are all consistent with the feelings of the original books.  The books that are included in this collections are all books I would want in my son's library, and I have, in fact, purchased some of them after viewing the videos.  Each dvd includes about 3 stories, and usually at least two 'extras'.  I would recommend that anyone interested in this collection invest in the 27 DVD bundle.  However, there are more DVD's to purchase.

The Wheels On The Bus is wonderful, so is Over in the Meadow, Dem Bones, and There was an Old Lady (come on, Burl Ives!)  Not crazy about I Want A Dog.  But wonderful music, and animation.",1163721600,8,816,4.618055555555555
2398969,5,B000B0WO58,"I was looking for a few sing-along DVDs for my 28 month old son and picked this one up along with a few others.

The first one I put in was a Sesame Street, Sing Yourself Silly.  He screamed and threw a tantrum crying for his Math Circus DVD.  Didnt go over so well.  Glutten for punishment, I put this DVD in instead of his Math Circus.

When it came on, the introduction was cute, and I thought, this is kind of nice.  Then the Wheels on the Bus came on.  And the people and the drawings made it look like some sort of psychodelic vision.  I thought it was creepy.  Plus the song was kind of slow and I was disappointed becuase I thought it would be something he could sing along with and this was way more drawn out.  Thinking this was a disaster I looked over at my son who, through tear stained eyes, said:

""ooooohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh""

Um, he loved it.  Creepy people and all.  He gets all excited by various parts and wants to watch it over and over again.  He is even singing along.  Now, Im so used to it, I kind of dig the singing (which is more bluesy or something, not sing songy kiddish) and I like it too.

Having not learned my lesson, I was again shocked at the Dem Bones being all these dead skeletons that appeared to have been drawn by a (not particularly talented) five year old, but once again, he thought it was great (wasnt scared) and starting singing to that one too (and pointing out the various parts on him, which impressed me he could make the connection to the freaky skeletons and himself).  He asks for this DVD all the time now.

So Scholastic obviously knows something I don't and based on my son's reaction, I have no choice but to give this five stars.",1149638400,28,1688,4.251572327044025

Their favorite is ""Dem Bones"" which introduces all the scientific names of the bones in a humorous and clever way.  The skeletons dance and play the New Orleans Jazz instruments. The kids are mesmerized for the complete class period (45-50 minutes) when your voice needs a rest or you need to get grades in.

My child loves these stories and seeing it come to life on DVD takes his passion to the next level: he recites the stories verbatim which is soooooo amazing, requests to read the books all the time, sings the songs all day long and it is a true delight for a preschooler and everyone around him.
