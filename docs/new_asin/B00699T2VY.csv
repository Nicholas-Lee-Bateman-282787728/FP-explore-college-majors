8495210,5,B00699T2VY,"Andy Aledort is one of my favorite guitar instructors and he does not disappoint on this disk. The disk has two parts really, first he explains the scales, then in the second part he analyzes the styles of a lot of rock guitar players that are now legends and the shapers of rock music.",1374969600,,286,4.314814814814815
8495211,3,B00699T2VY,"This DVD features Andy Aledort and he does his usual excellent job explaining how to play a number of songs or solos by different guitarists. However, the huge bold ""Keith Richards"" shown on the DVD box is pretty misleading because Keith is just one of several guitarists each covered through an example song or solo on the DVD. There's nothing wrong with the content there is, but the DVD doesn't focus on an in-depth analysis of any one guitarist as the title/graphic implies. The section on Ritchie Blackmore covers nearly the exact same small part of his ""Lazy"" solo as a video from someone else which I've seen for free on YouTube. Also, the inclusion of a lesson covering a Django Reinhardt style solo seems out of place among the blues-rock guitarists included.",1345248000,7,768,4.7819548872180455
