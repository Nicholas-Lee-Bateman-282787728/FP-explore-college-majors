8260930,3,B0016586S6,I didn't know it was for Brits only when I ordered it.  I'll send this to my cousin in Australia.,1494720000,,97,3.85
8260931,1,B0016586S6,"Wish there had been more clarity about the Region it could be played in. Not knowing about that, without resetting programming on my vcr, I have a useless DVD. All I wanted was to sit down and watch the dang thing which, I learned, could be watched on YouTube.",1490227200,,260,4.326530612244898
8260932,2,B0016586S6,"As advertised, I missed the part about this being a European DVD that does not play on U.S. DVD players. Sending it back would have cost more than the purchase, so I ate the cost. I'll try to find someone in Europe that wants this. It's useless here...",1484870400,,252,4.270833333333333
8260933,1,B0016586S6,I was looking forward to owning this title but to my surprise this movie couldn't play here in the U.S.  Why would you send items to another region?  It wasn't worth the money to return it so I junked it.  I would never order any items from this company again.,1379289600,,260,4.16
8260934,4,B0016586S6,"Wildly uneven yet hilarious hodgepodge made possible by the iconoclastic W.C. Fields and the spirited direction of Edward F. Cline. ""Never Give a Sucker an Even Break"" (1941) offers enough classic Fields material to compensate for the occasional dead spots. The climactic car chase through Los Angeles tops the finale of ""The Bank Dick."" Young Gloria Jean establishes a good rapport with The Great Man. Despite obvious studio tampering, a memorable end to Fields' starring career.",1351814400,,480,5.328947368421052
8260935,5,B0016586S6,THE  KARTES  VIDEO BY  MCA  EDITION  I  THINK  IS  A  VERY  GOOD  QUALITY  TAPE  AFTER  SCREENING IT. VERY  ENJOYABLE  TAPE.,1218240000,,124,4.45
