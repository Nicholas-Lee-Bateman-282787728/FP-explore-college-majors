2828253,3,B000PUB29I,"Overall, glad to have this in my collection.  I have done yoga off and on being mostly off right now I was looking for something to ease back in to practice.  Let me say if you are very low on flexibility or yoga experience then these poses will be challanging and there is a chance you may do them wrong (even a slight chance for injury) because instructions are as if you have done these before.  Perhaps this is true if you own other Shiva Rea discs, I do not.

The pace seems to go fast, could be a more mindful, gentler pace and be just as much benefit.  In the additional bonus features you can see 7 minute previews of 2 other of Rea's Dvd's.  I must say that I'm glad to see them because I can tell her style isn't what I'm looking for.  It is very fast and alot of quick twists of the spine (adding elements of kundalini I suppose, some tai chi in the 3rd segment) I am just not at that level of flexibility and want a more breath focused yoga.
Again, not bad to have in a collection of dvd's but not a main source of yoga for me.  The scenery was beautiful and her poses flawless and lovely to watch.",1205971200,7,1110,4.059633027522936
2828254,4,B000PUB29I,"I'm a Power Vinyasa Yoga instructor with my own studio in germany. Since I'm german my english spelling is pretty bad, please excuse me for that!
I own a lot of Shivas DVDs and also had the opertunity to learn from her personally on one of her retreats in Germany. I enjoy her great amount of creativity. She surprises again and again with her different fresh aproaches to Flow Yoga. Her work is a great contribution to the evolution of Yoga in the world.
About the product:
The main material of the DVD (without the Bonus, taken from Fluid Power) is a little more than 30 Minutes long. It consists of an entering movement meditation (Prayer Wheel), the main Heart Flow and a Kriya (energizing Movement Flow). You can do them all together, or one at a time.
I liked the Heart Flow a lot. Like all of Shivas Flows it is very creative with a lot of flowing and pulsating Movements you won't find anywhere else. This is not a Power Yoga like Flow. Regarding its intensity it is more like a lunar Flow, calming, opening without vinyasas.
The Flow does what Shiva promisses: It openes the Heartcenter beautifully. You can feel it strongly afterwards!
I enjoyed this main segment (about 25 Min) very much, but I have to say, that I did not like the entering movement meditation. For me this Movement called Prayerwheel hasn't much to do with Hatha Yoga anymore. It is simply a Tai Chi Movement. Tai Chi can and should be done with a Yoga-Mind, so in the end it's all Yoga, but I would prefer to see more Hatha Yoga on a Yoga DVD from a Yoga instructor. After all a Yoga Instructor is best in teaching Yoga, while a Tai Chi Instructor is best in teaching Tai Chi. So even though it is a nice part, it was not for me for I thing it goes to far away in a complete other territory.
The Kriya in the End is very dynamic and Kundalini like. The second part of it reminds a little of Martial Arts Movements like Yogi Bhajan also taught in some of his very dynamic Kundalini Flows. This is probably not for everybody who likes more ""traditional"" Ashtanga or Flow Yoga. Everybody who liked Shivas Yoga Trance Dance or her Martial Arts inspired Variations on Fluid Power will like this one to.
As a conclusion I can recommend the DVD to everybody who enjoys creative Flow Yoga. It is well worth the money, if only for the Main Heart Opening Flow. It is a great one for the days when you don't want to work on strengt and stamina so much, bu still want to do some Yoga to open and energize your body and calm your mind.
I hope this review was helpfull to you! Let me know. I truely hope so.
Check out my listmania list for all the Yoga DVDs I recommend. The list is constantly evolving. Ones again, sorry for the poor spelling!

2828255,4,B000PUB29I,"There are several short routines on this DVD, but unlike Shiva's other DVDs, there is not a matrix to customize and pick the sequence of your routine. Here's what you get:
3-part Practice:
Prayer Wheel, 9 min.
Hridaya Namaskar (Heart Salutation), 20 min.
Energizing Heart Movement Meditation, 3 min.
Extras:
Twisting Kriya, 7 min.
Yoga Trance Dance, 8 min.

The Heart Salutation is a wonderful morning practice, all performed on the floor and kneeling. It's a lovely way to start your day, wake up your body, and get in touch with deep love energy for yourself and others. It ends in a lovely deep seated meditation.

After the seated meditation it goes right into the standing Energized Heart Movement and Shiva's very loud energized voice. It does not fit at all with the rest of the practice and there is no way to omit it! I would rather sit in meditation and have 3 min. of soothing music than the super-energy of the 3rd section. It takes you right out of the lovely feeling from the heart salutation! I would give this DVD 5-stars if it wasn't for this issue.

Additionally, this DVD gives you a choice of playing the segments without naration, just music. I would rather have a choice of naration and no music, so I can add my own.

This is really quite a lovely practice, except for the two gripes I have. Does Shiva publish the heart salutation on another DVD within a matrix choice? Place email me if you know.

See my other reviews on Amazon for other great yoga practices!

2828256,3,B000PUB29I,"Nice. Could be added as bonus to her previous dvd. It is much sorter than other dvds. Buy it together with another ShivA REa dvd if a beginner. Buy it anyway if advanced. Same wonderful filming -if you don't do yoga just watch! This practise would round the Fluid Power dvd. Has some Aum chanting in poses, which is nice.  Also some Qui Qong (Chi Kung) like moves. Shiva Rea is well informed as well as very inspired, so you get traditional practises, given in a fluent and honest way. Through her experience and body-feeling she adds moves that feel a need, especially to a female body. Yoga is evolving and teachers that give expression  to new needs are so welcome. Shiva is indeed riding the wave and offering  joy to many.",1200182400,,727,4.492424242424242
2828257,4,B000PUB29I,"Shiva Rea is my favorite yoga teacher and I like all of her DVD's , though this is her least exciting one in my opinion , the main 20 min practice (Heart salutation) is a nice relaxing series of side stretches and backbends like camel and bow. Like other reviewer have mentioned the other 2 segments are short and a little bit ""parve"" though I liked the 3 min. moving meditation at the end. There's also 2 bonus segments that you can add to your practice from Fluid Power (Jala Namaskar) and Yoga Trance Dance (Twisting Kriya) though ""Jala Namaskar"" was also on Trance Dance with a different setting. On the whole , it's a nice short practice that you can add to other workouts as a stretch or do it on its own if you don't feel like doing much. Also take a look at her live DVD from Yoga Journal, a new practice cd ""Yoga Wave"" coming in february and a new DVD ""Surf Yoga Soul"" next year , can't wait!",1196899200,,901,4.213872832369942
2828258,4,B000PUB29I,"I own just about every Shiva Rea dvd.  This one is only 35 minutes long plus 2 sets from Yoga Trance dance (twisting kriya) and Fluid Power.  The dvd has 3 sections:
1.  Breathing vinyasa in which you move your arms and legs like you are doing tai chi in unison with your breath.  Your arm go in and out with your breath and over and around your head and chest- to open your heart and bring joy.  It is slow motion meditation.

2.  Heart salutation: cat/cow, moving half split (on one knee and one leg straight); side angle on knee, triangle on knee,  lunge hip opener,lunge back bend, camel holding onto heels and releasing one arm and swinging it back, cobra with om on exhale, bow pose with om-done 3 times, lying twist, happy baby. It ends with a seated meditation with hands in lotus mudra. (20 minutes)You'll need a pillow or blanket for tender knees.

3. twisting kriya with chanting Ha. (3 minutes)

parts 1 & 3 did nothing for me.  I liked 2 a lot as it prepares you for seated meditation and I use it at night before my nightly meditation.  It opens up your shoulders and hips making it easier to sit and puts you in a meditative mood to recieve blessings.

If you hit play all, you get the energetic kriya last which may not be what you want after the relaxing heart salutation.  There is not a matrix on this dvd so it makes it harder to program a customized set.  Shiva spoiled us with her unique matrix.

My only complaint is that the cinematography was a little too artsy and that you really couldn't see what she was doing as it was either in shadows or shot from far away.  Also when she asks you to say om with a pose, she doesn't say it with you and if you are face down and not looking at the screen, it is hard to know when to chant and when not to chant.  Minor quibbles.

I felt very calm after doing the heart salutation and I can see using set 2 every night as I love camel, the hardest pose on this dvd.

I can also see doing set 3 plus the Yoga trance dance twisting kriya to wake up in the morning before a hatha or kundalini yoga set.",1195862400,23,2063,4.148614609571789
2828259,4,B000PUB29I,"I have 3 other Shiva Rea DVD's and this one is a bit different.  The others have many, many options (time, focus, ets). This DVD is one complete workout.  Her voice is so soothing, her instructions are impeccable (you don't have to look at the screen constantly) and the music is wonderful.  The warm-up (Prayer Wheel Meditation) is a continuous 8 minute heart opening flow.  You will be doing a sort of rock with one leg forward and your arm moving together away from you and then towards your heart.
The longest flow (Heart Salutions)is 20 minutes long.  There are traditional poses in this section, but with a twist.  Your arms are always flowing and some the standing poses are done on your knees.  For those of you with knee problems, you may want to keep a pillow handy or skip this one.  A good 10 minutes or more of the 20 are spent on your knees, one at a time or both.  There is a very short relaxation and meditaion at the end of this section if you want to end here.
At the end there is a 3 minute engergizing flow.  I wish that it were less energizing and more relaxing. The DVD ends with this flow so there's no relaxation at the end.
There are also two bonus sections taken from Shiva's previous DVD's (Trance Dance and Fluid Power) making the total yoga time over 40 minutes.
Please don't let these few items I mentioned sway you from buying this DVD.  It is worth every penny and I just relax on my own at the end.",1195084800,52,1431,4.282527881040892
2828260,4,B000PUB29I,"I purchased this DVD after attending Shiva Rea's yoga instructor training at Kripalu. It includes backbends to open up the heart center (anahata chakra) through the practice of a heart salutation (Hridya Namaskar). Although short (only 35 minutes) in length, I love this DVD. Its not quite like having Shiva teach the Hridya Namaskar in person, but pleasant in its effects. After the practice, I feel that on a physical level, my chest and intercostal muscles have opened up; mentally I feel open to the idea that I can remain open in the face of adversity; and emotionally I feel open to the gentle, graceful and compassionate nature of my heart. I would not recommend this DVD for beginning yogi's as proper understanding of alignment is assumed. Without this awareness, one may do more harm than good. So, if you are an intermediate or advanced yogi looking to open up your heart - by all means enjoy this DVD.",1194912000,26,913,4.748427672955975
2828261,4,B000PUB29I,"This is a very good Yoga DVD for all levels of people who enjoy a Yoga workout using a DVD. It is fairly easy, but you will get a good work-out in about 35 minutes. The instruction is easy to follow leaving you relaxed and ready to start the day.",1269561600,,246,3.94
2828262,4,B000PUB29I,"I am fairly new to yoga, although I've been exercising for a long time. I tried a few yoga DVDs and was usually bored - until I discovered Shiva's Flow for Beginner's DVD.  I loved that and now have all but one of her Acacia DVDs, although I have not used them all as of yet.

This DVD opens with an 8 minute Prayer Wheel meditation.  This meditation didn't do much for me really.  I had just completed a full workout and couldn't get into standing that long during a meditation.

I did very much enjoy the main flow (Heart Salutations), though.  I am recovering from knee problems so was a bit worried with some of the previous reviews, but decided to try it anyway.  My knee was only bothered a small amount - not so much by being on my knee, but in the knee that was up during the half warrior poses.  (My mat is fairly soft and so makes balancing more of an effort for the raised knee.)  However, the knee problem was not major and I continued through the practice just fine. For me, this was a nice relaxing flow.

There were a couple minor flaws, both mentioned by earlier reviewers.  As mentioned, she would tell you to chant, but then did not chant along.  I'm not much of a chanting person, so that wasn't any problem for me, but it did seem a bit odd!  The other was there was one pose where she started prone and then ended up doing a spinal twist with shoulder blades on the ground.  At first I couldn't understand her instructions for this pose, and because of the shadows I couldn't see what she was doing either. But I did eventually figure it out.

I also enjoyed the final 3 minute meditation at the end.  Since it was afternoon, it was a nice way to end my exercise and yoga and restart my day. I recognized the music in this meditation from her Trance Dance DVD.",1265414400,2,1781,4.240356083086054
2828263,4,B000PUB29I,"I've used this DVD quite a bit since I purchased it back in June, and I can say it's a very relaxing and enjoyable yoga practice. As other reviewers have noted, the DVD is divided into 3 segments: 1. Prayer Wheel 2. Heart Namaskara and 3. Energizing Heart Meditation. Personally, I prefer to practice this routine in the morning before going to work. It's advantageous in that's it's only 30 minutes long and it's gentle, yet energizing for a morning practice.

Rather than incorporate a yoga matrix on such a short DVD, my suggestion would be to incorporate a forward and backward type of selection button to accommodate those reviewers who prefer to end with the more relaxing Prayer Wheel Meditation rather than the Energizing Heart Movement Meditation.

Specifically, here's what's included on the DVD. The opening Prayer Wheel Meditation has you standing, gently rocking back and forth using your legs while doing some slow arms circles around your ribs to open your heart. It also incorporates some heart messaging which I find very beneficial. Sounds goofy but this meditation is very relaxing and peaceful.

Next is the 20 minute Heart Namaskara which you do most of it on your knees, so it would be ideal for beginners who have a little yoga experience. Poses range from low lunges, runner's stretch, half warrior 2, half side angle pose, shoulder openers, modified beam pose, reverse namaste, to cobra and bow poses. Segment ends with some gentle spinal twists and knees-to-the-chest as counterposes.

Finally, the Energizing Heart Meditation begins with a Ha Kria using your arms, which is similar to the one on Yoga Shakti, and ends with a twisting kria.

Overall, I really like this practice. Shiva Rea, with her boundless creative energy, always manages to take a mundane salutation and turn it into something incredibly different and unique. I think that's why she's such an awesome and talented yogini.",1250121600,3,1918,5.0
2828264,4,B000PUB29I,"Because it's fairly short in length (especially compared to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yoga-Shakti-with-Shiva-Rea/dp/1591791847/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yoga Shakti with Shiva Rea</a>), I initially expected this DVD to be easy. Not so- it's a great workout. It's fairly hard on your knees though (and I don't consider my knees ""bad""), so I always use a blanket when doing movements on one knee.

I work as a proofreader/writer, and long hours staring at text or a computer screen have wreaked havoc on my back and neck. This DVD has become essential- almost as good as a chiropractor. The heart opening movements, especially the bonus feature twisting kriya (from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yoga-Trance-Dance/dp/1564559238/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yoga Trance Dance</a>), have done wonders.

2828265,5,B000PUB29I,If you are recovering from breast cancer treatments this is a must-have routine.  It is helping me regain necessary stretching ability in my inter-costal muscles and the affected arm where the surgery was necessary. It also has helped me feel more resilient psychologically as well as physically in facing all that goes on with facing cancer treatment.  Highly recommended.,1238112000,5,373,5.305084745762712
2828266,4,B000PUB29I,"I have been enjoying this one regularly when yoga is not my exercise focus for the day, meaning I usually do 1 1/2 hours of yoga and call that my focused movement for the day. I've been doing this before going out running or tabling more exercise for later in the day.

This lovely, short and sweet DVD opens up my heart, my shoulders, my spine, my hips (to some degree) and my quads. I like that Shiva focuses on *opening the heart* instead of *backbends* which is a lot of what is happening here. Focusing on opening the heart, for me, has a tendency to keep me from compressing my lower back.

Personally, I love the cinematography and after the first time or two have had no trouble knowing when to chant and how to position my body.

Chanting OM while in Camel pose is an amazing experience. This DVD is nice to do and then follow with segments from Shiva's Yoga Trance Dance.

The reason I'm not giving this 5 stars is that I wished she had explored the heart opening further. 30 minutes goes by so very quickly!",1237334400,4,1018,4.31413612565445
2828267,4,B000PUB29I,"Since I've been learning about the chakras, I was intrigued by this DVD which focuses on the ""heart center"" or heart chakra. Overall, I feel this is an excellent offering by Shiva Rea who has a very peaceful and detailed way of instructing. This yoga is all about the heart center (chakra) and focusing energy and healing towards the heart while calling up positive characteristics such as love, compassion, and forgiveness. I could feel love all around and inside me while doing it and even right now. So I would say that in doing this routine, my heart chakra opened up. Shiva Rea achieves what she set out to do. It would be so nice if Ms. Rea did other DVDs focused on the other chakras.

The poses/moves she uses were at times challenging for me so I did the best I could. It is definitely not a DVD for pure beginners. My only qualm with the DVD is the way it was shot. I get that they wanted it to be artsy and the background to be calming (it was a very beautiful background indeed) but it was kind of dark and shadowy and I had a difficult time seeing what Rea was actually doing. That's my only real complaint.

This DVD is not necessarily something I'd add on as part of a fitness routine. It's more of a moving meditation and a powerful one at that. She incorporates the chanting of ""Aum"" into the routine and the sound ""Ha"" in the sun salutation part. I enjoyed this DVD and it was perfect to do after yesterday's workout which left me a little sore.

Today's practice left me feeling energetic and bright even though the day is quite dreary. I'm ready to start my day feeling positive and joyful.",1236556800,2,1610,4.36
2828268,5,B000PUB29I,This video offers a wonderful opportunity to open one's heart to the universe.  The excercises bring about a sense of peace and openness of heart that is often difficult to access.  The end result is a strong sense of grounding in a world that is frequently chaotic.  I strongly recommend this workout.,1216425600,,302,4.769230769230769
2828269,5,B000PUB29I,"My only mistake was holding off buying this DVD until 2008 and missing out on an exquisite little gem.  It's a perfect early morning practice, with gentle music and a Prayer Wheel warmup as the sun rises behind clouds ... a brief period of arm circles and Ohm chants, a heart chakra ""massage,"" then the Prayer Wheel which consists of gently rocking forward and back in a staggered stance, while circling the arms to stimulate the chi.  This section alone is better than the strongest morning coffee!

The next segment, Hridaya Namaskar (heart salutation) is complete in 20 minutes, perfect to set the tone for your day.  It features gentle kneeling stretches to warm and open the spine and graduates to gentle/moderate backbends as the sun continues to rise, the most vigorous being Ustrasana (camel).  Backbends are appropriately countered with forward bends and side stretches.  You are bathed in nurturing!  Rather than lying Savasana, the practice ends with a seated meditation followed by prana mudra arm/breathing movements, which you might enjoy better than lying still again after sleeping.

The closing Energizing Heart Movement Meditation will launch you into your day with a vibrant attitude, in three closing minutes.  The music picks up apace as Shiva leads through a standing ""ha"" kriya with arm movements to open the ribcage and release any last stagnant air, and prepare your spine to uphold the stresses of the day.  If you wish to stimulate your morning further, the Twisting Kriya from Yoga Trance Dance and Jala Namaskar from Fluid Power are both included in the bonus chapters.

Though my review is geared toward a morning practice, this would also make an uplifting refresher after your day, before moving into nightly chores.  I only ask - Shiva, can we have more chakra centered practices?  How delightful would a similar brief compilation be for the head centers, root chakra, throat ...",1210982400,4,1912,5.031746031746032
2828270,4,B000PUB29I,"I would give this a full five star rating if the camera work, while pretty, was not a source of deep confusion and vexation the first few times I did the work out. Occasionally Shiva will instruct you to do something--say, ""bring your left knee up to your side"" but because she's shot in shadows, you can't actually SEE what it was she just did and only figure it out a few moments later when she progresses into the full movement. Where exactly is her knee? Where should I put my knee? Oh shoot. She's doing something else now! Wait. How did we get on our backs?...we were on our stomachs a second ago, right?...This isn't a problem when you've got the asana flow basically figured out, but initially it can throw a wrench of confusion into what was otherwise a very smooth practice.

Such flaws aside, I otherwise very much enjoyed this practice. It is very calming and invigorating (so funny how it can be both, but it is). I think this practice is suitable for beginners as long as they aren't totally new to practice. I'm a fairly recent beginner and only moderately flexible for the most part (and I have the tightest hamstrings ON THE PLANET) and am just establishing a regular yoga practice, and I could do this work out with relatively little difficulty once I'd run through it a few times and gotten over my camera woes.",1209513600,6,1330,4.4958677685950414
8193380,3,B000PUB29I,"I LOVE Shiva Rea, but I deeply wish she (or her producers) would stop with the 'artsy' filming. The practice on this DVD is filmed so dark and from a distance I was guessing what I was doing most of the time.
Some of her other DVD's also start focusing the camera on her 'live' drummer instead of her during a transition or pull in too close to her face to see what she's doing.
Just teach me yoga, I'm not here to watch a movie!
Other than that, she has a lovely way of teaching that makes you feel the Spiritual and intellectual side of yoga that I feel is sorely lacking on most yoga DVD's. She DOES make you want to learn Sanskrit words for the asanas and study the Sutras for a deeper practice. I don't feel that connection with other Vinyasa teachers that I get with her. She makes you get into your breath and out of your head!",1523750400,,834,4.122699386503068

I love this DVD I start out the week with it, then I move onto upper body plus core, lower body plus core and abs.  Not only do I feel amazing but my body is shaping up nicely as well.  I would unequivocably recommend this to everyone!  It is easy, simple, but does so much!",1456704000,,524,3.9711538461538463
8193385,4,B000PUB29I,"Every human being aspires to grow spiritually and help others (even if all do not know it). The best thing of all, however, is to learn through teaching others :). I think Shiva Rea is a master in listening to the beginner's mind. She takes her interests in flow yoga, dancing, music and combines them with her creative impulse to generate new combinations that inspire countless disciples to the point where she has become literally a cult figure. It is to her credit that she understands this dynamic and does not let it impede her work.

In this DVD, Rea goes through simple movements that are designed to open the front of the body. It is difficult to learn from a video however i imagine the product could be quite useful to her students and.or workshop participants.  The routines are well designed and helpful; my favorite was probably the ""twisting kriya"" bonus track. The most impactful feature of this DVD, at least for me, is Rea herself - the sincerity, drive for perfection, simplicity, seriousness, efficacy, creative permutation of existing asanas - speak volumes about the woman. Having danced with her (once) I can vouch for her tricksterish genuineness, charisma :) and power. I am inspired by her creativity. I just wish there were more women like her.",1411862400,,1271,4.825688073394495
8193386,4,B000PUB29I,"Ok so this DVD is beautifully filmed and I love the style of Shiva Rea's prana flow. That said, due to the artistic style of the way this was filmed with the camera zooming away from her body it's hard to see her, so it's not exactly user friendly to those new to this type of yoga. This is a VERY intermediate practice, not for beginners and caution must be taken to prevent injury. Don't try to copy Shiva just yet! My other concern is specific to myself--so much of this practice is done on the knees which can be excruciating for anyone with arthritis, sensative knees, or previous knee injuries. I used a blanket underneath my knees for most of the practice. The knee is the most commonly injured joint in the body and many students will experience discomfort when practicing on the knees for such a long time. Try using a nice padded mat or a blanket to make it more accessible. I find this DVD lovely and inspiring but it's not without some flaws!",1369267200,,954,4.395480225988701
8193387,1,B000PUB29I,"This DVD is a waste of money, you can't see the how she does the exercise well kind of dark when it stared and  they keep the camera to far way.

8193389,3,B000PUB29I,"As other reviewers have said, this series of poses does invigorate and energize.  The only problem is the filming (as others have said).  The shots are very often from a distance and in shadows which make it difficult to know what Shiva Rea is doing, especially when she is doing the mat work.  This also creates a situation which can cause serious injury for a novice who does not understand the poses and what she is doing.  At one point, it is virtually impossible to see what she is doing as she moves her leg and knee across her body and then twists.

I did love the way it energized and calmed and the flow of the poses as I like Yoga that continually moves.",1279843200,5,813,4.3509933774834435
