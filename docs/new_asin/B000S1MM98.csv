8203943,4,B000S1MM98,"In the city of Shinjuku, a battle between two armored warriors took place. Karas, the protector of the city was defeated by the villainous Lord Eko. Eko plans to rule the city with the assistance and absolute loyalty of metallic demons called Mikuru;a new Karas is soon reborn to battle against Eko and his minions.-summary

Karas: The Prophecy is the first three episodes of a six episode OVA turned into two movies, 80 and 90 minutes respectively. From the very beginning, the most noteworthy feature of the movie is the breath taking visuals. The combining of 2D and 3D with traditional drawings is very impressive, at the moment I can't think of anything that looks better. The animation and artwork has a sleek futuristic look that compliments the outstanding character designs for the armored warriors.

The battles move at a break neck pace. One would believe this could be very hard to follow but not at all. The battles move with such fluidity it is rather simple to see every move that is made. After watching this a number of times. I still haven't detected the slightest bit of jumpiness. I don't believe in perfection, but if anything is visually close it would probably be this. In combination with stylish visuals is the outstanding music score that gives the film an epic feel.

If Karas: The Prophecy was a meal, then some would feel somewhat full while others will still be very hungry. For the most part I was close to somewhat full. This may be another case of style over substance in a lot of peoples eyes, but not completely in mine. The story is slow paced but not impossible to understand. There's more than one plot taking place that appears to be working in the same direction. Of course, there's the basic action filled good vs. evil that we all know and love. However, there is a little more than that. One of the other plotlines takes place with a side character named Mr. Sakigawa.

There's a case going on with people's remains being found completely drained of their fluids. The police don't have a clue as what to make of it. Sakigawa is convinced that it's demons but he's shunned for his accusations. I find this segment of the story to be a welcomed addition plus interesting. The writing uses this character to paint a picture distinguishing the difference between those whom still believe in old folklore, versus those whom want to believe it could be anything else besides folklore, despite overwhelming evidence that whatever is causing these deaths can't be normal. Some look down on him and assume he must be crazy, but there happens to be a reason behind his drive. I found him to be interesting, and I wanted to know what was going on. I enjoy this part of the story simply because it gets old really fast when you only have to witness, ""my master wants you dead, lets fight"", over and over and over again.

While there is one character that caught my attention. I have to say the rest really didn't appeal to me much personality wise. They seem a bit too one dimensional. The characters aren't too developed at this point, but you can tell they serve a purpose other than as bodies to be slaughtered. Karas is very interesting concerning his abilities, he's an armored fighter wielding a sword and he can morph into heavily armed vehicles. This adds a lot of variety to the battles. A girl named Yurine is his handler, as bland as this character may be; she delivers one of the most dramatic pre-battle openings I can think of. I'll leave this part open.

The biggest flaw to this film has to be the cliffhanger ending. I know fans whom no longer consider this a flaw because the second volume has been out for a long time now. I'm not basing my rating on the series as a whole. I'm rating this particular opening film, and to me, it's a huge con and I'll explain. Someone whom has never heard of Karas: The Prophecy can easily pick this up and feel burned by the ending. This is almost how I felt about it years ago but my rating was still the same, because there was still enough going on in the story to let you know it wasn't over. It wasn't like Blood: The Last Vampire. You knew that was a done deal.

I enjoy this film but I can't recommend it to the casual anime fan. Despite the film being incredibly spoon fed. There are some whom feel there is no story or plot going on at all. The story and plot is only slow paced. This is something mainly for the die hard otakus.

Pros: Absolutely stunning animation and artwork, nice music score, great action

Cons: Very slow paced story and plot development, low character development, cliffhanger ending",1428105600,,4600,4.559322033898305

8203945,4,B000S1MM98,"Imagine if every city chose a special champion to defeat monstrous mechanical demons -- becoming the armored superhuman known as Karas.

That's the concept behind ""Karas - The Prophecy,"" the first half of a sprawling, lushly animated series about a mystery hero who spans the worlds of demons and humans. The rather underdeveloped characters hamper the story somewhat, but the scintillating animation and explosive action sequences make this a brilliant experience -- and the twisty-turny plot doesn't hurt either.

Two black-armored men engage in an explosive aerial battle, until ex-Karas Eko triumphs over his successor. Three years later, a young doctor named Otoha awakens in an enchanted house, under the command of the city's avatar Yurine.

At around this time, Tokyo is being attacked by the gruesome cyborg demons called Mikura, and harmless small demons are falling seriously ill. Otoha -- the new Karas -- is charged to destroy the Mikura, who are also being hunted by the mysterious superhuman Nue, and investigated by demon-obsessed cop Sagisaki and his skeptical partner Kure.

But Eko has a plan in mind for defeating this new Karas and getting ahold of Yurine. When a battle between Otoha and the Mikura takes a nasty turn, Nue's true nature is finally revealed -- and when the Karas is called on to defeat a gruesome spider-Mikura, Eko takes the opportunity to target the source of Otoha's power... and his life as well.

""Karas - The Prophecy"" is a bit of a brain-teaser -- several parts of it (including the first several scenes) don't make any sense until you see all of it. And there are three subplots which seem only mildly connected to each other. Then you go back and watch again, and suddenly all the little hints and disjointed puzzle pieces snap neatly into place.

Fortunately the twisting plot is riddled with moments of quiet beauty (Otoha tending to the sickly demons), humour (Nue chatting with an adorable little snail-child), and poignancy (the whole story about Sagisaka's mentally-ill daughter). And there's plenty of horror speckling the story, especially the Mikura with their glowing eyes and metallic roars. The height of freakiness is undoubtedly a girl dessicating into a mummy as she talks to her friend.

But what truly sets ""Karas - the Prophecy"" apart is the action and animation. Every fight with a Mikura is a kinetic, razor-sharp mingling of swordplay and acrobatics, full of bloody spiderwebs and water attacks. And the animation is simply stunning -- everything is depicted realistically, but with exquisitely glowing colours, deep soft shadows and lots of brilliant little details. For example: the spiky raven armor, the blinking Karas talisman, and the vast epic sweeps across a snow-covered Tokyo.

Unfortunately ""Karas - The Prophecy is recognizably the first half of a story. Not only does it end on a massive cliffhanger, but some of the characters feel... unfinished, as though their development is yet to come.

Otoha is one of these -- he's a nice guy with a good heart, but he's something of a blank until the last scenes, though Stan Staley is brilliant here. Eko gives off a feeling of ennui and bitterness as a Karas-turned-supernatural-mob-boss, which is somewhat dampened by Matthew Lillard's lifeless performance. But Nue is a brilliant piece of work -- a monstrous, unnatural creature struggling to overcome his base self.

""Karas - The Prophecy"" is obviously the first half of a whole, but it's a brilliant half -- richly animated and haunting. And it leaves you hungry for the second part.",1229817600,,3562,5.0528109028960815
