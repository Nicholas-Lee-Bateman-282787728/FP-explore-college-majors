2841962,5,B000QUEQ4A,"Anybody who is a fan of the original series has been waiting for this release. Finally, we can own all the SBTB,almost. It should be noted that the Hawaian movie was actually the last thing filmed with the original cast before the Tori episodes of season five. This is a great little escape when you're feeling down and out in the real world. And at last, for those who got the College Years box can finally endcap the series with Wedding in Las Vegas, as the gang has some hijinks in the city that never sleeps and finally we see Zack and Kelly get hitched. Even Jessie and Belding show up! Now if only Liongate would release thoe Junior year episodes with Miss Bliss...hint hint.",1180656000,36,681,4.456

2842199,5,B000QUEQ4A,"During the height of its popularity, the series aired a primetime movie titled Hawaiian Style Vacation during the fourth season. The movie is missing from the seasons 3 & 4 set, but Liongates later released the movie along with Wedding in Las Vegas on a single disc. The Hawaiian Style is set during the summer in between season three & four, while it actually aired in November 1992. (Note: The movie was actually filmed as wrap-up to the series, but the producers ordered a fifth batch of episodes in which Elizabeth Berkley and Tiffani-Amber Thiessen didn't return for.)

The plot involves the Bayside gang going to Hawaii to visit Kelly's grandfather, played by Dean Jones, but they soon find out that her grandfather's hotel business is going under due to a new resort taking all the business. He is going to loose the property if he doesn't get some tourists to check in. Of course, the gang helps out by conning a group of principles, including their own Mr. Belding, into checking out of the resort and checking into the hotel. Due to the fact that there is no staff, the gang fills in as the staff.

I had forgotten how the movie went, as I probably haven't seen it in at least fifteen years. The plot reminds me of the 1939 classic Blondie Takes a Vacation. There's also a side-story in Hawaiian Style involving Zack falling in love with an older single mother. Hawaiian Vacation actually stands out from the series with its clever writing.

After the short lived series Saved by the Bell: The College Years was cancelled, Wedding in Las Vegas served as the series finale for the original Saved by the Bell cast. I recall watching the movie when it aired on October 7, 1994, but I don't think I ever rewatched it until last week, so the movie was kind of new to me.

The movie is centered on Zack and Kelly getting married in Las Vegas. They only have $1,200 dollars to spend on it, but after Zack gets caught speeding, he no longer has any money. As soon as they arrive, Zack and Screech get odd jobs, but then they end up as male escorts as they try to raise the wedding money. Meanwhile, Slater gets involve with Carla, whose ex-boyfriend is a mobster. The whole gang get involved in a jewel heist, but of course everything ends happily ever after for Zack and Kelly.

Wedding in Las Vegas gives the Saved by the Bell fans a proper farewell along with a couple of cameos by old cast-members during the wedding ceremony. Overall, I enjoyed watching both movies and I recommend the DVD to other fans.",1347840000,8,2511,4.5342163355408385
2842200,4,B000QUEQ4A,I knew what this was when I ordered it. Must have for any Saved By The Bell fan. Great story and wonderful ending to Zach and Kelly's relationship.,1342742400,,147,4.285714285714286
2842201,5,B000QUEQ4A,It  took the college years not to mention a crush on a youthfull or youthfull looking professor at least to get Zach and Kelly back together. Now they're getting married-albeiet with a few obstacles and the other movie is good too though not as interesting but good. Get this or youll be disappointed.,1338163200,,301,4.679245283018868
2842202,5,B000QUEQ4A,"I have waited SO long for these two SBTB specials to be released on to DVD. When I saw Amazon carried it, I was so happy. This is a must own for anyone who grew up watching SBTB and wants to reminisce or pass it down to future generations!",1335139200,,239,3.8979591836734695
2842223,5,B000QUEQ4A,"You can NOT beat this DVD if you're a Saved By The Bell fan!! I find it to be the best and better than the other DVD sets. I loved the Hawaiian movie but the Wedding in Las Vegas has to be the most entertaining in the SBTB series. If you didn't catch them when they were on TV, you MUST watch them!!! I loved the high school years, loved the College Years a million times more, but these are my favorites! My cousins are digging the series and they weren't even born when it started on TV! You won't be disappointed if you like the series!",1321920000,,539,4.046728971962617

2842228,4,B000QUEQ4A,"If you are a die hard ""Saved by the Bell"" fan then this is a must!  I loved it!  I loved having resolution on the romance of Zach and Kelly.

If you are not a die hard, however, this may not be worth your dollar because it only has the two episodes and costs just as much as two entire seasons.",1269475200,,294,3.7868852459016393
2842229,4,B000QUEQ4A,"I just received this DVD as a birthday present about two weeks ago.  I grew up watching Saved By the Bell, and was thrilled to get the DVD.  If you love Saved By the Bell, you'll love these two movies.  The series' distinctive cheesiness is apparent in both movies (although probably a little bit more in ""Hawaiian Style"" than in ""Wedding in Vegas"").

The DVDs are great, and it's wonderful to finally own these guilty-pleasure movies, but I do wish that the DVD had some sort of special features on it.  If there had been special features, this DVD would be a five-star rating.

Verdict: Must-own for the die-hard Saved By the Bell fan, but don't expect anything extra.",1252368000,2,670,4.588235294117647
2842230,5,B000QUEQ4A,"This was a great movie, no commercials, was in great condition. Very easy to buy and receive",1247616000,,92,4.470588235294118
2842231,3,B000QUEQ4A,"Hawaiian Style--this was a fun movie. The acting and story are corny, but if you're a big Saved by the Bell fan that won't really matter. However, it's a little weird watching at first because there's no audience laughter. This was especially noticeable to me when Screech would tell his jokes--I was so used to hearing laughter after his comments. All in all, a fun escapade but didn't knock my socks off.

Wedding in Las Vegas--This one was better. The most important thing was that they did everything right to wrap up the series. You'll know what that means when you watch it. Again, the story and acting are corny, but there are some cute and even exciting parts, with some funny side characters. The one thing I was disappointed in was the lack of romance. The story really did have a strong focus on Kelly and Zach's wedding, but there was so much going on with setting the events up, escaping from bad guys, etc. that there weren't really many tender, passionate scenes between the two of them (the best place to see these are the last four episodes of The College Years). That was my main criticism with this one, as their romance is my favorite aspect of the series.

Again, all in all an enjoyable flick that wraps things up nicely, but on my repeat views I'll probably be watching the College Years more than these two movies.",1242172800,,1338,4.547717842323651
2842232,5,B000QUEQ4A,A great way to cap off your SBTB collection! Includes 2 great movies and a very low price....what a way to end the college series and the show in general!,1220227200,,154,4.166666666666667

2842263,3,B000QUEQ4A,"Saved by the Bell - Hawaiian Style and Wedding in Las Vegas is a so-so collection. Both of these short t.v. movies are good but not great like the College Years or the original show. The style and look of these movies are strange and slow, the chemistry seems forced as well. Only purchase this if you can't live without these fun-loving pals. Enjoy!",1208390400,,350,4.484375
2842264,5,B000QUEQ4A,"I've been a ""Bell"" Fan since the age of 8. Now, 17 years later and I still love watching these episodes! I wake up at 7 am just to watch the re-runs on TBS. They just don't make shows like this anymore. It brings me back to the innocence of my youth- as cheesy as that may sound- but it's true. I was very excited to receive this DVD in the mail and when I did, I opened it up and watched it right away!! Amazon expedited the shipping... It came very well wrapped and it was a fast delivery. I will definitely be shopping from AMAZON again.",1206403200,,540,4.0092592592592595
2842265,4,B000QUEQ4A,"I liked the Las Vegas wedding one better than the hawian movie. I've always liked saved by the bell and the romance between Zach and Kelly.
