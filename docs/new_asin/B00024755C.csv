8697420,5,B00024755C,"Absolutely love it!!  Ended up purchasing a new blue ray/dvd player that is a ""no zone"" restricted player so that I can watch this PAL formatted dvd on my TV rather than having to watch it on my computer screen.  Well worth the money I spent on the new player and have now ordered additional dvds from areas outside the USA and Canada, one of those being the more recent 40th anniversary Runrig ""Party on the Moor"".  Looking forward to its arrival.",1440201600,,448,4.439024390243903
