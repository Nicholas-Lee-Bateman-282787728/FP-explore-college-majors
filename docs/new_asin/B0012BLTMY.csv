8244980,4,B0012BLTMY,"Fast-edits, hand-held camera work, pretty actors, fast-paced scripts, questionable morals, and lots of sex.  These are the hallmarks this Irish mini-series or soap opera.  Reminds me a bit of MTV's wonderful and innovative youth opera, Undressed.  It would be difficult to match the beauty of the actors in that series, but this Irish version is fun.

The title comes from the name of a Dublin singles bar with lots of dancing, meeting and greeting, catching up, and going down.

The characters are more than just 'types' and all are relatively well-off and, pardon the expression, Yuppie-like:  bankers, stock brokers, contractors, computer geeks, wannabe musicians, students.  The least successful story-line follows the computer geek, played by the very cute Michael Legge (much sexier in Shameless).  He has father issues, girl issues, and job issues, but plays it too mono-chromatically with an ultimately-tiresome lack of self-confidence.  The most successful story involves a hip gay DJ (when called 'English fag' by his co-worker, he replies, ""I hate being called that -- don't ever call me 'English'."") and his budding and potentially long-term relationship with a policeman.  Real and sexy and heart-felt.  The most frustrating involves a beautiful, fast-talking super-bitch who knows what she wants and doesn't care how she gets it.  No shrinking violets here, except for the sadly wasted Michael Legge.

Nice views of a very modern and European-looking Dublin.",1306368000,,1472,5.4035087719298245
