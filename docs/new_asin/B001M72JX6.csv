8320637,3,B001M72JX6,"I have been viewing the ""Making of"" for these calendars from the very first Dieux du Stade calendar.  Originally, they were available as clips on ""Stade TV"" at the Stade Francais website.  In 2004 they started releasing the behind the scenes videos on DVD.  Those original web clips, though extremely low definition, were fun and sexy.  As each year is released, less and less of the players' personalities are on display.  These are becoming increasingly clinical.  If you want a study in how to apply body makeup and pose an athlete, these are great.  Otherwise, not so great anymore.",1323820800,,586,4.858585858585859
8320638,2,B001M72JX6,"This is a good video.. I bought it to play it on a theme party, and guests still thought that the 2007 version was much better...

I would recommend you buying the 2007 instead of this one...",1286841600,,191,4.162162162162162
8320639,1,B001M72JX6,"Again, I was looking forward to the 2009 edition, hoping it would be better than the 2008 edition, but this one is even more disappointing. I don't know how they chose the photographers. Being a photographer myself I was shocked at the amount of over exposure on parts of the bodies, especially the faces. This extreme lighting caused many of the men who have been handsome in the past, to look tired and washed out. There is almost no humor in the models faces as they do these poses, and because all the shoots are done in front of the same background, it eventually becomes very boring. The use of various locations in past editions was more interesting and the models seemed to be having fun, here some of the models look very uncomfortabe and afraid. By far, the best edition has been 2007 and yes, it did contain full frontal nudity in a very natural way. Here there is no frontal nudity. Some of the costume choices are really stupid such as a man's suit coat on a nude body...none of these work nor are they sensuous. This series may have finally bottomed out...a better choice for purchase is the Australian Football Players DVD based on their calendar. Taking the French players out of a more masculine, stadium, industrial setting is not working. Pass on this edition. This may be the last one I buy.",1236902400,17,1311,4.559322033898305
8320640,3,B001M72JX6,"as with the 2008 disc, NO FRONTAL NUDITY,even by the star players that did it in 2007.  otherwise, some really nice, sexy men. some didn't even bother to get nude at all.  lots and lots of behinds shown, but that's about it.  the last nudity year was the 2007 dvd.",1236729600,18,264,4.24
