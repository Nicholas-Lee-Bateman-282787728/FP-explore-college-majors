It's said that love conquers all. But what if that's a lie? Bewakoofiyaan, a 2014 Bollywood romantic comedy, makes a case for love conquers all. Observe these two lovebirds, two middle-class corporate youths, Mohit Chadha (Ayushmann Khurrana) and Mayera Sehgal (Sonam Kapoor). Both in their twenties, Mohit and Mayera believe that the world is theirs, that love conquers all.

Mohit is a rising comet in the marketing department of the airline, Air Connect Airways. He just got promoted to Senior Executive. His sweetheart, Mayera, is even more successful. She's a financial wizard. She draws a higher salary than Mohit: $72,000 to his paltry $65,000.

Mohit and Mayera have got it made in the shade, carousing like there's no tomorrow. He just bought a car. She's always on a shopping spree. Imelda Marcos is envious of her shoe collection. They've been together for two years. He wants to marry her. She says okay, but, uh, first he has to ask for her father's blessing. Dad's old school like that.

Enter our third participant. V.K. Sehgal (Rishi Kapoor), Mayera's crusty, bureaucratic father. V.K. isn't sold on Mohit. It doesn't sit well that he's only an up-and-coming executive. V.K. wants a wealthy man for his daughter. He pooh-poohs the young couple's assertion that they can subsist on love alone, on passion alone, if need be. The lovebirds protest: ""Money or no money, love finds a way.""  But V.K. has been around the block. He knows better, knows that one requires money to sustain that love. He decides to put Mohit to the test.

Bewakoofiyaan (English translation: Stupidities) is a fun watch, but it could've been more, only the movie doesn't really take any risk. It has stuff to say about recession and unemployment, only it mostly chooses to not dive deeply into these issues but to use them as comic bits. Anyway, it turns out, the airline industry is on shaky footing, and, so, Mohit loses his job. The irony of that is he loses his job because of his recent promotion, the reasoning being that sacking him would save three jobs to his one.

Mohit is like most guys in his pride and his foolishness. Still trying to impress Mayera's father, he goes on to pretend that he still has his job. At this juncture, the movie could've explored more in depth how a guy feels when his girl gives him a hand-out. Or, conversely, how the girl feels about giving her man a weekly allowance but couching it in such a way that he doesn't feel bad about himself. Instead, the plot plays it safe and takes a flippant approach, plays the situation for laughs. Given, there's one scene in which Mohit and Mayera are in the car and they engage in a tense quarrel about money, and their exchange of words has hurtful bite to it. So that's one instance where the plot treats the situation in a very real way. I wish they'd done it more.

Ultimately, Bewakoofiyaan has no significant blemish, but neither does it have any truly scintillating moment. There are times when it's a slog, watching Mohit lose his job, then his apartment, his car, his friends, and, finally, his girlfriend. And then comes the third act and the inevitable happy ending.

I like Rishi Kapoor. He's a fine old acting veteran. But I didn't care for his role of Mayera's dad too much. He's intended as the main comic relief, except I didn't think he was that funny. I just grew impatient, whenever he had one of his ""amusing"" antics. He kept boasting to people that the Home Secretary was his batch mate, like that was a showstopping punchline.

And the songs? They're forgettable.

I think I'm still in love with Sonam Kapoor. I've adored her since I first saw her in Aisha. Here, she is as stunning as ever, and I love the disarming vibe she exudes. And, man, she has got the longest legs. Even Deepika Padukone said so.

The lead guy, Ayushmann Khurrana, is aw-ight. I think my problem isn't with the actor as much as it is with the script and how it portrays him. As Mohit, dude is obstinate and so prideful he refuses to take a job that he thinks is beneath his qualifications.

3 out of 5 stars for this one. It's a movie that I think I'll only watch this one time. I enjoyed it because of Sonam Kapoor. But the story plays it safe, the humor is often strained, and I didn't find the lead actor too sympathetic. The movie suffers for that.",1513814400,,4333,4.618985695708712

8652725,4,B00JPEIEE6,"I enjoyed the movie. Ayushmann Khurrana and Sonam Kapoor doing a good job of starting off a movie funny but managing to make it real when it counts.  This isn't a heavy duty movie.  Date night fluff, but some good acting too.  I personally didn't like the dance scenes in the middle of everything.  It felt like the characters break character to become dancers in the middle of a non musical movie.  Notice Bollywood does that a lot, so for me it's a culture thing, I think. In American films, unless it's a musical, no one does formation dancing all of a sudden in the middle.  So I didn't let that bring down my score.  If I was using a 1 to 10, this would be a 6,5 for me.  I recently purchased the digital movie so I could watch it on Amazon anytime (even though I have the blu ray disc. I was disappointed. The cut a small part out that was not necessary. It is a scene that in India would have said intermission. But it has an artistic value, that shows the characters are becoming distant. It is foreshadowing, and beautifully done, showing their reflections in a skyscraper walker away from each other. They cut the song and the scene where it is picked up felts awkward. It has obviously been cut there and sticks out like a sore thumb.",1461024000,,1245,4.313304721030043
8652726,5,B00JPEIEE6,"This movie is for Rishi Kapoor fans.  He shines as the tough outside but melted-butter-soft at heart father of the beautiful Sonam Kapoor (no relation, she is the daughter of actor Anil Kapoor).  A powerful movie with a powerful message about the lifestyle and values of the current hedonistic youth of India's upper middle classes, spending like there was no tomorrow maxing out on their credit cards. When the young protagonist loses his job in marketing right after having received a promotion, he loses his way in the complications of the steadily worsening economic pincers. His girlfriend stands by him and supports him as long as she can, and then takes an overseas assignment to chart her own course in the financial world.  Then Rishi Kapoor (current Indian movie heartthrob Ranbir Kapoor's real life father) steps in to bring the estranged lovebirds together, using tough love, humor and a huge dose of earthy common sense.
A movie for the ages. Don't miss it.",1432771200,,970,4.938650306748467
