given this film all 5 stars if each girl was shown licking
pussies and sucking tits but none of that was shown",1302393600,,167,3.9411764705882355
8319332,1,B001LOR3VS,This had to be the most boring collection of crap thrown together.  I watch a lot of indie and foreign films...even down to the bizarre and artsy fartsy and this just blows.  None of them held my attention; I flipped to the next to see if it was at least better than the other and it was just as crappy.  Do yourself a favor and rent it.,1288656000,3,337,4.0

8319335,5,B001LOR3VS,"Full-disclosure: I am the curator of this collection of classic lesbian short films.

There are so many lesbian films to choose from these days it's funny to think it was not so long ago when there was almost nothing available.

Girl + Girl: Classic Lesbian Short Films gathers together a bunch of great lesbian short films that stand the test of time. Most of them were never released on video/DVD but they delighted audiences at LGBT film festivals throughout the '90s.

These are films that have entertained, influenced and inspired SO many lesbian viewers over the years. The program kicks off with the long-unavailable British short Rosebud. Cheryl Farthing's glossy lesbian coming-out fantasy was a major hit on the queer film festival circuit in the early `90s and is notable for it's exceptionally attractive cast (including British TV star Julie Graham).

Three of the films included here represent early short works from lesbian directors who went on to make important lesbian feature films. It is thrilling to watch Sande Zeig's 1994 short Central Park in light of the great success she would go on to have with her 2000 feature, The Girl. And to see Cassandra Nicolaou's evolution as one of Canada's most talented, up-and-coming filmmakers with her skills on display in Why I'll Never Trust You (and then go check out her 2004 feature thriller, Show Me). And watching Lea Pool's masterpiece of short filmmaking, Rispondetemi one immediately recognizes the talents and thematic obsessions of one of Canada's most gifted, established filmmakers who has made such beloved lesbian features as Lost and Delirious, Set Me Free, Anne Trister and others.

I have to confess that some of these selections are a bit melancholy, or poignant. There is much longing and desire. Don't worry, there are also cute girls and making out (two of the other most important aspects of lesbian cinema, if you ask me). I also have to say that Clara van Gool's Reservaat is one of the most beautiful films ever made -- watch it at least twice, I'm telling you! Like Reservaat, Regarde-Moi (from French filmmaking duo Sylvie Ballyot & Beatrice Kordon) is a meticulously crafted cinematic unfolding of desire and seduction. While Jennifer Arnold's far more Hollywood-style Maid of Honor warrants a feature film version for it's wonderfully polished rendition of lesbian life, love and the pursuit of non-monogamy!

Watch and enjoy. And ponder the journey of the past 20-something years in lesbian filmmaking.",1233273600,6,2493,5.083129584352078
