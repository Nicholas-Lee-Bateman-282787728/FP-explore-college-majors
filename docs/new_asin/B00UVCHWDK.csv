7071528,5,B00UVCHWDK,"This movie should prove timeless for its story, perfectly cast actors, scenery and overall quality. It does as much justice to the book as humanly possible in 100 minutes (apparently a defacto time limit for independent films). I watched the film twice: enwrapped in the tear-inducing story the first time, then appreciating the scenery, acting and comic relief moments the second time.",1433721600,15,386,5.241935483870968

7071532,5,B00UVCHWDK,"Being on the set of this movie makes me a little partial to this movie. But it really is an awesome story and filmed where I've lived all my life. Life Out Loud Films/David Baldacci made my home place look more beautiful than ever with the county being a character by itself. Another good thing about this movie...all the nice people....cast and crew, on the set. Mackenzie Foy and JP Vanderloo are cutie pies and have very sweet personalities. I can't wait to order this movie that came out today on DVD and filmed in October-Nov. 2012.",1433203200,7,537,4.546391752577319
7071533,5,B00UVCHWDK,"This is an amazing film and saw it at Heartland Fim Festival. I highly recommend it and the story is heartwarming and wonderful for families to see together.

7071546,5,B00UVCHWDK,"A story of the heart about the land and love, and how the glory of Grace shines through each one of us when we live in harmonious living with the land and each other to course through our veins rather than greed or evil.. Without that, all of living is rather hollow. This is not a complex film but within it's simplicity lies a much bigger message. Please hear it.",1530489600,,365,4.228571428571429

7071548,3,B00UVCHWDK,"While I love David Baldacci's books, there was nothing about this movie that even hinted at the writer's ability to write a great screenplay and it was difficult to imagine one of his books being the basis of this corny movie. Sure there were some good moments but the movie was overall slow, weak and vapid. The catatonic mother and the terrible fake southern accents didn't add anything positive to the unrealistic storyline.",1530316800,,427,4.863013698630137
7071549,5,B00UVCHWDK,Loved this touching film. The story far surpasses most films out there today. The beauty of the cinematography is beyond stunning. Great cast and crew. Congratulations and please make more. Absolutely in love with this film!,1530057600,,224,5.25
7071550,5,B00UVCHWDK,Loved this story! Gave me a glimpse of how life was and maybe still is for some in our beautiful Virginia mountains! And how important faith and family are in this world. My daughter also required her 9th grade English class to read the book and watch the movie as an assignment.,1530057600,,279,4.384615384615385
7071551,3,B00UVCHWDK,"I wanted to rate this higher, but there were too many things that kept me from it.  It's a sometimes-sweet/sometimes-silly....sometimes endearing/sometimes intolerable....sometimes believable/sometimes off-the-charts-unrealistic conglomeration that leaves me scratching my head at times.  The child actors were good, especially in the roles of Lou and her little brother, who was adorable. Lou's lipstick was completely out of place, however. The adult roles were filled with competent and likable actors, for the most part. PROBLEMS? a few:  I was startled to see a 50 star US flag in one crowd scene, since the movie was set in 1940.  That was an error they should have caught.  The courtroom scene and trial were completely unbelievable, unrealistic and downright annoying. I haven't read the book, but I understand from other reviewers that the ending was changed for the movie. Hopefully the book ended better than this movie did.  I won't go into particulars so as to avoid a spoiler, but....really? Older children would probably enjoy this, although the brutality of one father was something they probably should not see. And, last but not least....how did it stay autumn for the entire time-span of this movie??? Although it was hard to tell how much time actually elapsed from beginning to end, there's no way those trees would look like that for long. I live in the Appalachian mountains and that gorgeous foliage is at peak for about a week, max. The scenery was lovely, but...again, not realistic. They must have shot this movie in a very short time frame.",1529884800,,1568,5.129411764705883

7071570,5,B00UVCHWDK,"A Burstyn diamond, good story, a historical period piece of depth and dignity. Having endured tragedy in my own young life, the story was very easy to relate to in terms of all the characters. The film drops in deep and slow allowing all the actors, including the incredible young ones, especially the one who played Lou, plenty of time to flesh out their moments,.There is also lots of action. A wishing well, a wishing you well, a good solid drama with lots of subtexts, downright homespun wisdom that deals with issues still active in our times. It made me a bit nostalgic for a childhood in which I could be outside running around doing whatever without adult supervision, safely playing in the woods. The scenery was beautiful. It was nice to see Ellen Burstyn have a role to sink into, not at all who she is -- Incredible actress still offering up a great performance. The character says she's part Cherokee, and she sure looked like it at the end. It's a slice of Americana, a true to life story well-told.",1526774400,3,1013,4.571428571428571

7071576,5,B00UVCHWDK,"This was an excellent movie. There are not many movies I would watch twice-but this is one of them. It was wholesome, well written and well produced.

7071577,1,B00UVCHWDK,"The movie is beyond horrible.  Sickeningly sweet, absurdly unrealistic nonsense.  Since when does any court allow a jury (with interested parties on the panel) to determine a woman's mental competence?  Every line is a platitude or the most cloying, trite cliche.  I couldn't believe the actors recited some of that stuff without laughing out loud.  We were going to turn it off, but kept it on just to see how sad it was that Ellen Burstyn has sunk to doing this dreck.  It bends all rules to be ""pretty,"" including having autumn colors in the trees all year long, the little girl wearing too much lipstick and eye make-up, etc.  Figured that was because they filmed the entire thing in a week.  If you're trying to entertain 7-year-old girls, it's probably okay.  If you're an adult, you will not want to sit through this.",1526256000,,824,4.666666666666667

Two invalids who can't move, one for a prolonged time, with only 2 young children and 1 handy man to take care of things.  As anyone who has ever had to attend an invalid, you know it's a full time job well beyond those means.  Then the Hollywood 'miracle' ending where the invalid who has been bed bound for a year, suddenly just rises and walks to save them all from financial ruin.

7071629,5,B00UVCHWDK,"This film tells an absolutely lovely story about two children who have lost one and possibly two parents.  More so it is a story of hoping and helping - at just the right times.  It was heartwarming but not at all hokey.  I won't give away the ending, but the final scene where the kids get a hug from the one they needed the it from the most was so beautiful that I had to replayed it to freeze the screen on it a few times.  It was based on a book, and I don't know if the book tells how the attorney was connected to the great grandmother, but otherwise it was kind of a mystery.  Also, I wish they had showed more of the happy ending rather than just telling it in the last few minutes of the movie.  They could have just shown a few pictures of the happy moments that are described.  Lastly, the film did not show what happened to the little boy Billy.  Overall, this movie was incredibly beautiful, and you won't want to give up hope for the whole film.  As the saying goes, ""Never take away someone's hope.  It might be all they have.""",1483920000,2,1042,4.1138613861386135

7071633,2,B00UVCHWDK,This seemed like a good movie and I was really looking forward to watching it after reading the book.  The fact that there were no closed captions was a real draw back.  The men's voices were a bit more understandable but the female voices were lost.  We missed most of the dialog.  Please consider CC for all DVD rentals.

7071659,5,B00UVCHWDK,"What a wonderful book and more wonderful movie.  I was a little anxious about the movie--how much of the book could be included--but felt this was a charmer!!!  Of course, being a native of Giles County, VA, I literally ate up all the scenery!!!  It's too bad this film did not get more showing exposure.  The DVDs available locally were snapped up VERY fast, here and in surrounding counties.  The children were so comfortable with their roles and Ellen Burstyn, also.  The relationship between the 2 generations--so good for all generations to see.  When the book author picked this locale and said it was perfect, yes!  it was!  This story reflects the battle with coal companies and land owners in the Appalachians.  I shudder when seeing the effects of strip mining, and mine disasters are devastating to all of us. The pull and tug between the haves (coal companies) and the have-nots (local land and small farm owners) is heart-breaking.  Not only in the 1930s, but continuing today.  A recent example is the Upper Big Branch mine disaster in April 2010--an explosion killing 29 West Virginia miners.  Massey Energy, owner of the mine, had ignored the 515 citations issued by the Mine Safety and Health Administration in 2009 and was permitted to do that.

The script sought to include the story in many scenes and sequences - the entirety of it, when it would have been a more powerful movie and more intense if it had focused on part.  The scenery was beautiful, but could have included more of the area (this area in which I now live). The story is warm and powerful in itself, but is better in the book than in the movie.  Acting was very good and portrayed characters well.  It's definitely worth the purchase and viewing, but read the book, too.  Reading is wonderful.",1457049600,,629,4.3418803418803416

Author made me ""see"" the two boys & their antics and I laughed at much in the book as well as learned much about a coal mining town, how these people lived, endured and made best of what they had.

7071705,3,B00UVCHWDK,"A very nice indie treatment of a well-liked novel. As with nearly any filmed novel, much is left out and a number of plot changes were made, but these did not compromise the story. The film is well cast, although Ellen Burstyn might have worked a little harder on her Southwest Virginia accent. Still, she's totally believable as Miz Louisa. The only thing which bothered me a lot, and it's not really very significant, is that the seasons did not change as the story progressed. It's always autumn. In some scenes it's early autumn and in others it's middle or late autumn, and they're not in sequence in that regard so it's mixed up and looks a little off. The story as it is presented in the novel novel covers more time than one season. Again, this did not seriously affect the story but required some suspension of disbelief, with trees mostly red and orange in one scene, then just beginning to turn in the next, then going toward brown in yet the next, and back and forth again in a mishmash. Autumn is the most spectacular season in the southern Appalachians, however, so it does make for gorgeous visuals.",1439510400,6,1114,4.575

I'm amazed at the number of 5-star reviews.  This is a nice, sweet film.  Ellen Burstyn is amazing, but Josh Lucas, an outstanding talent, is given little to do.  The ending is rewarding enough but kind of unbelievable, and the pace is  S  L  O  W.  It's like a Hallmark film.  The young daughter, Bellamy Foy, is pretty good, but overacts a bit.  I'd cut her part some and increase Lucas', and give him a little to work with.

7071734,5,B00UVCHWDK,"This movie is based on an early Baldacci novel, and fans of his more recent works will find this a different sort of story.  It's set in the Appalachian Mountains of Virginia in a time when mining was a major industry in need of more land containing coal.  This sets up a conflict between a strong-willed, scrupulously honest grandmother who has recently lost her son, who had left for the area for city life, and now has responsibility for her two grandchildren and her daughter-in-law, who has been injured in her husband's fatal car crash.  The grandmother makes her living from farming the land and feels it is her duty to preserve it,  She does her best to pass on her feelings and knowledge to her grandchildren.  The coal company wants the mineral rights to her land and has been pressuring her to sell at a time when she is just barely making ends meet.  She has a local attorney who is her friend and who is on her side.  The story masterfully develops relationships between grandmother and grandchildren,  grandchildren and other young people of the area, and people who want to ensure the land stays in the family and those who would do almost anything to put the land into the hands of the coal company.  The suspense is well built and leads to a bittersweet conclusion.  It is in the building to this conclusion that the movie shines.  The acting is believable, and  the viewer is left nodding in agreement that the ending is as it should be.  It's a bonus that the movie was filmed in Giles County, Virginia, a place of awe-inspiring beauty.",1434412800,44,1555,4.5703971119133575

If you have nothing better to do on a rainy afternoon, you may enjoy it, however it felt like a rather mediocre ""made for TV"" movie unfortunately.

Not one bit slow, not one bit in-interesting.  I'm betting those who pan this movie have more than a passing interest in the destruction of this country in order to put money in their own pockets.

This certainly has all the trapping of a Hallmark MOW.The acting was fine, scenery beautiful, I just found the writing very simple.  AND in looking at the favorable reviews, many of them seem to have been from people who had read the book.  I did not.  3/4 thru I started making fun of the movie.",1530921600,,414,4.256410256410256
