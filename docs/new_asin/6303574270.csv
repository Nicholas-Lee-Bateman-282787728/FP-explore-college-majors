7850365,5,6303574270,"This is without a doubt one of the best, if not the best, by Gene Roddenberry!!  Of course it has spiritual overtones!!  If you listen and look for just about anything that Roddenberry produced, created or wrote; they all had a bit of that overtone.  And I mean spiritual in an evolutionary type of way, not in any religious type.

Roddenberry had faith in humanity, he believed that humans have a lot of  potential, and these believes reflected in most of his Star Trek programs and movies, all of them!!  He obviously believed that humans will grow beyond 'life', and this particular STNG: Transfigurations reflects that believe.  It reflected both our potential of being beyond human, and this particular program also reflected those against that growth or evolution that humans are destined to become!!

I  highly recommend this program, it was beautifully done!!  It had the potential of becoming a movie.  I loved this one in particular because it was such a reflection of what he believed and what we might become!!",1283904000,,1022,4.883720930232558
