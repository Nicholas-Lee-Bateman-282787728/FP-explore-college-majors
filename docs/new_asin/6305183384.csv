7884369,3,6305183384,"RELEASED IN 1969 and written & directed by Jess Franco, ""Kiss Me, Monster"" stars Janine Reynaud (Diana) & Rosanna Yanni (Regina) as detective duo The Red Lips who seek the missing Doctor Beltran who has concocted a formula for super-human clones with the mental capacity of canines. Key informants keep winding up dead so the girls go undercover as a nightclub act on an island off the coast of Spain where they charm the mogul, Eric Vicas (Adrian Hoven), whom they suspect has something to do with the killings and the missing doctor.

Quickie filmmaker Franco released 7 movies in 1969, including this one, which was shot in 24 days in August/September, 1967. Its the second of a duology featuring the detective pair; the first being Sadist Erotica, which was released earlier in the year. Being thrown together so quickly, the plot is virtually incomprehensible unless you're aware of it up front (as described above). Another problem is the lousy dubbing, which (1.) doesnt fit the lips of the characters and (2.) isn't congruent in tone with whats happening on screen.

But, if you can get past those flaws, there are several things to enjoy in this spy parody/adventure, which comes across as a melding of late 60s flicks like Raquel Welchs Fathom (1967) and Beyond the Valley of the Dolls (1970), but worse than both due to the issues noted above. Some highlights include the Spanish coastal locations, the groovy percussion-oriented soundtrack, the late 60s chic and a few good-looking 60s babes. Speaking of which Reynaud was 37 during shooting and Yanni 29. Neither do much for me (theyre a little too slinky), but I definitely prefer Reynaud as far as sex appeal goes. Unfortunately, with the exception of a couple of outfits, the 60s apparel they're laden with doesnt exactly augment their beauty.

THE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour 15 minutes and was shot in Spain with one part in Munich, Germany. ADDITIONAL WRITERS: Luis Revenga & Karl Heinz Mannchen.

7884370,2,6305183384,"I liked the other Undercover Angels spy spoof movie by Jess Franco just enough not to be bummed out like I was with this one. This one less so. It's slightly more ambitious with a flashback plot structure but  it's also seemingly a quick retread. It's not that you expect a lot out of these movies outside of lots of over the top outfits and tons of colors. Somehow even that doesn't quite work even on that level. It's even more haphazardly ended than the last one. I think they're trying to cut out the nudity. I could be wrong but I doubt it since Jess Franco is involved.

It's not utterly terrible but it's terrible enough to not want to watch it again",1506470400,,657,4.290322580645161

It is a clip; not a trailer. Look up each word's definition ... compare and contrast, then submit your essay.

7884375,2,6305183384,"I truly wish I could have rated this one higher, because after all, it's Jess Franco, one of my favorite directors.  However, I must call a spade a spade: this film, a sequal to ""Two Undercover Angels"" (see my review), never truly sparks.  A viewing of ""Angels"" is essential before digging into this one, and even then ""Kiss Me Monster"" so full of campy in-jokes that one quickly gets exasperated.  Here, our two beloved ""Red Lips"" chicks travel to the tropics for an ""adventure"" (I use the term loosely).  I caught myself glancing at the DVD timer to see how much time was left--and it's a short flick!  As a Franco completist, I own it, but I cannot in good conscience recommend it to the public at large.",1018915200,5,707,4.4921875

7884377,5,6305183384,"I recently became a big fan of Jess (Jesus) Franco.  This has to be his funniest movie.  I have to admit though, I not sure what was meant to funny and what wasn't.  The cheap production, the bad dubbing, and the over the top story, make this one very enjoyable movie.  If Mike and the bots ever do another MST3K film, this is the movie they should be forced to watch.  I would highly recommend this to any fan of B movies.",967507200,5,423,4.109756097560975
7884378,5,6305183384,"More from Franco's Red Lips duo (see also ""Sadisterotica"") this a fast, furious and ridiculous romp through comic book colours, eccentric stock characters and a plot so simple it becomes almost incomprehensible.  Franco himself cameos as a seedy contact who meets an untimely end in  service of the plot. Not one of Jesus's more profound efforts to be sure  but from the opening car chase (which runs under the credits and has  nothing to do with the plot) to the finale, by way of badly dubbed songs to  act as clues and show stopping night club scenes this is a joy. Franco  obviously had a lot of fun with this one and it seeps out of the film and  infects the viewer. A good introduction to the world of Jesus Franco for  the uninitiated this is well worth the purchase price. Check out the  opening credits and the (unmotivated) use of the ""Blow Up"" logo,  which dances along in time with the jazzy score to see why franco is such a  one-off.",950313600,7,947,4.4476744186046515
