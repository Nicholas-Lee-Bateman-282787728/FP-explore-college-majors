2729450,5,B000MEYKG4,"This is a great, adventuresome indy film about a rebellious teen in West Texas and how his grandfather helps him to manhood, as the kid lost his father early in life.  Menard, Ft. McKavett, and the Pecos River are the settings.  a great family and teen movie. The real challenge begins when he takes a 60 mile journey down the Pecos River by himself; he encounters quite a lot, some funny, some tense and suspenseful.",1278633600,2,417,4.546666666666667
2729451,4,B000MEYKG4,"Finally, I found it. I first saw this movie at Blockbuster, I didn't rent it! Oops, one week later it was gone, they said it was sent back! I looked everywhere for it, finally found it on Ebay.
Its a coming of age story, the wild teen who is set out on the open water to survive. I liked the actors/actresses in this one, rent it if you can, its definitely worth watching!",1203811200,4,372,4.109589041095891

8168243,5,B000MEYKG4,"Last month I was told this was an awesome movie by a Man shopping for movies too.  I bought this for my 10 year old son.  I would encourage any single parent to have their son or daughter to watch this to see if they can relate to it.  My son was not old enough to understand the realtionships between the family and to some degree, the friends.

Give it a try, the price makes it worth it.

8168244,5,B000MEYKG4,"A beautiful manifestation of the internal struggle of life in the mind of every person. A boy, insulted by life having stolen his father from him, and all the unfairness entailed, the boy reacts to take it out on the world he lives in. He discovers that he is free, and that he does not have to take it personally, and that he can return to his own creativity and love instead of being angry and mad, in the sense of crazy. He was led to his creativity by a cowboy who sees the boy in his own self, and finds a way to reach and grasp the boy's heart to bring him back to life. Well done all around!",1345420800,,598,3.9916666666666667
8168245,3,B000MEYKG4,"I understand that this movie won an award. I wonder what for. The acting is fairly good, but the direction is 2nd rate & the script is full of inconsistencies that leave you wondering what happened. But it's pretty fair entertainment if you're forgiving & imaginative & interested in a wilderness adventure of sorts. Barry Corbin plays a really laid-back small town sheriff who gives out with quite a bit of ""2-bit"" philosophizing which might be good for teens to hear.",1314489600,2,469,4.802469135802469
8168246,5,B000MEYKG4,I loved the movie and watched it several times.  It came quickly in the mail and I was very impressed.,1281052800,,102,4.1
