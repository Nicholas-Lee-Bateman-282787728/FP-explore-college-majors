8358318,4,B0029WLJGQ,"This is five part series about Irish outside of Ireland, such as in  Australia and America and Canada. I never realize how become a excile people, we are invisible empire of sorta.",1462752000,,180,4.625
8358319,3,B0029WLJGQ,"Any history of the Irish abroad will be  far-reaching, so it should not surprise that any attempt to encapsulate the data for public consumption will quickly get out of date. This Irish Empire series is quite interesting in its coverage - as far as it goes. Since its release in 1999,  much has taken place in the subsequent 16 years of Irish history in the modern world. A new series, therefore, could be welcome.  That's OK, the authors can't be faulted for dealing within a time frame.  I did feel that a lot of the present material was re-hashed within itself - one gets the impression that to create another sub-title, the team just re-badged and recycled the same photos with a different slant. Again, that's OK if the story is progressed.  Occasionally in this instance it isn't.  Consider purchasing but don't be too disappointed.",1373414400,,838,4.744827586206896
8358320,5,B0029WLJGQ,Quite a well scripted documentary with wide range of topics. Particularly impressed with topic of Scots-Irish in America...often overlooked. Downside is that the series ends prior to the peak of the Celtic Tiger and its demise...and the irony of the re-emergence of involuntary emigration/exile.  Additionally there is very little to suggest the anti-Americanism expressed by native Irish towards returning exiles and subsequent generations; and the contradiction of inviting the so-called Irish Diaspora to build and invest in industry in the Republic! Would love to see an updated series.,1332460800,2,590,5.704545454545454
8358321,1,B0029WLJGQ,"I've only watched the first part and my mouth was hanging open at the suggestion that the Irish have romanticized suffering, used the famine as an excuse when it really wasn't that bad, and were largely protestant immigrants, not Catholic. Also, its only in our heads that the famine drove the Irish here to America. The Irish who came, by the way, were not the most desirable tier. Wow, I'd like to see what they could do with the Holocaust. Its contrary to everything I've ever heard about Irish history.",1330560000,7,506,4.633333333333334
8358322,4,B0029WLJGQ,I cannot get enough Irish history. this series is one of the best to help me understand what my Irish family must have gone through in the past.,1302220800,,144,4.178571428571429
8358323,5,B0029WLJGQ,"Fantastic series on the Irish re-settlements in America, Australia, England and around the world. Engaging, fascinating, moving, full of things you've not heard or seen before.  This is the Irish equivalent of Ken Burns' series on the American Civil War -- and just as good!  Those who already know a lot about the Irish migrations and achievements will discover more. If you are a beginner, this is the place to start!  Why did they go, when did they go, where did they go, what happened when they got there, what happened in Ireland after they left -- you will be surprised again and again.  Two-thumbs up!",1265328000,14,608,4.7075471698113205
