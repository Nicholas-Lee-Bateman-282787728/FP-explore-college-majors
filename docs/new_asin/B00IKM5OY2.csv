8643107,2,B00IKM5OY2,"Three U.S. Army soldiers(incl. a female captain) suffering various degrees of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder(PTSD) become trapped in an elevator of a DC, VA hospital, during a possible terrorist attack on Washington.  How will this effect each of their stress levels, even to the point of cracking up?  They soon discover that they were all given the same meds.  What's behind it?  Do they really know what's going on outside as they learn bits of information.  I'm sure vets returning home from the Middle East and the Army itself would not approve of this script.  Filming is claustrophobic but the cast does it's best with the far fetched screenplay.  Rent, don't buy.",1403740800,,671,4.9375
8643108,2,B00IKM5OY2,"Some people involved in a dubious experiment are stuck in a lift. They then struggle to survive.

The acting is good; I thought the two main characters Jude Ciccolella and Josh Stewart acted well. The characters are fairly interesting.

The filming is good for a low budget.

Overall what let it down was a story done too many times.",1397692800,,333,4.610169491525424
