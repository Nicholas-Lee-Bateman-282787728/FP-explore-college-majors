8627446,3,B00GTSVNZI,"Basically a ""troubled rich girl's"" plight.... And we get to share in it through the movie. Wish we could have seen way more of Brenda Bakke!! Seeing her in ""an artistic way"" was great but short lived. Saw way too much of her boyfriend's!! Oh well, happy ending. Great to see more Of Brenda, the only reason to watch this.",1414195200,,321,4.366666666666666
8627447,4,B00GTSVNZI,I have no idea where this film came from. Great sexual energy between the two leads (and Brenda Bakke is smokin' hot) Watching this film I felt like a voyeur peering into a tantalizing intimate relationship. A young and always great Jeremy Piven provides some much needed comic relief as well. Great late night film,1410739200,,315,4.745454545454545

8627449,5,B00GTSVNZI,"White-hot erotic drama that is both pro-sexuality and pro-life, and definately pro-love.  Starring a personal favorite in Brenda Bakke, who gets to display both her great (and sadly unnoticed much of the time) acting skills and her electrifying beauty.  ""Twogether"", despite its dark moments, celebrates love (and loving!) while subtly scoffing at excessive macho aggression and at the tendency (in movies and in real-life) for couples who know they love each other to risk or let it slip away due to some stupid mistunderstanding or pessimism or wounded ego over some real or imagined slight.  Also helped by the development of a sweet relationship between Brenda's character and a homeless man who lives near her boyfriend's apartment (a friendship relationship, not sexual) and the themes of envirornmentalism and hope for the future running throughout (the main characters meet at an envirornmental fundraiser where he's displaying charity artwork and she's working as a volunteer at one of the tables).  Both characters overcome mistakes in their past, damaged relationships, and their own stubbornesses over the course of the film as they try to get things right.  Listed as R-Rated here, but both the cover shot and the longer running time listed here reveal that this is indeed the Unrated Version, which is obviously the one to get.  Whether you're a guy or a girl (or gay or lesbian for that matter) there are plenty of eyefuls for any persuasion.  A rare success in combining delightful raciness and deep, difficult drama.",1101081600,6,1533,5.157258064516129
