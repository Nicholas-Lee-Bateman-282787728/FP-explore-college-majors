6106486,5,B00GSA3TD6,"Amazing heartwarming and craftily shot film. Rowland's story telling of the 2012 Olympic's first-times captures their struggles, successes and failures in a fresh way. Definitely on my Christmas gifting list",1386028800,,207,5.933333333333334
6106487,5,B00GSA3TD6,"This film follows the journey of 12 athletes who compete in the 2012 Olympic games. For the first time, we are given a window into the lives of these outstanding individuals and what it took to get to where they did. I think this is something that many long to know while they watch the games and this film does a fantastic job satisfying the craving.",1385942400,,351,4.333333333333333

8626724,5,B00GSA3TD6,Good documentary of the whole Olympic Games in London 2012.,1464307200,,59,5.0
8626725,2,B00GSA3TD6,Not much of the actual Olympic games.  I wish I had not bought it.,1436745600,,66,3.7142857142857144
8626726,5,B00GSA3TD6,Very interesting documentary that shows some footage of the 2012 Olympics and the athletes that I hadn't seen before.  I'm a huge Olympics buff so this was must see for me.  I would definitely recommend watching.,1432080000,,212,4.861111111111111
8626727,4,B00GSA3TD6,"The video played without problems up to ~1 hr 21 min, and then it stopped suddenly in the midst of an episode about a cyclist (the video should have been ~1hr 44 min long)....I sent it back to Amazon and got a replacement, but the replacement video stopped at almost exactly the same spot and would not advance...perhaps it's a manufacturing defect in that lot...other than this disappointment, the stories of the athletes up to that point were quite engaging...it was especially refreshing to see athletes from multiple countries and inclusion of sports that are less ""popular""",1389052800,,578,4.969072164948454
8626728,5,B00GSA3TD6,This is such an engaging film that makes you feel like you were at the games. The stories in the film are very interesting and moving. Loved it!,1386115200,,144,4.178571428571429
8626729,5,B00GSA3TD6,"""First-The Official Film of the London 2012 Olympic games"" is more than a film about the Olympics. It's a visceral experience. The powerful music score, the amazing cinematography (especially the opening ceremonies) and the athletes themselves come together in a beautifully ""choreographed dance"" that keeps the viewer engaged from start to finish. (I'm still humming the theme song!). I was both educated and entertained by the inside look of this important 4 year international sports event. (Maybe one day, I will be a spectator!).",1386115200,2,534,5.369047619047619
8626730,5,B00GSA3TD6,"FIRST takes you behind the scenes of not only the 2012 Olympics, but into each athlete's life. The film shows the good, the bad and the ugly instead of only focusing on the positive moments. It will inspire you and bring you back to the 2012 games.",1386115200,,248,4.297872340425532
8626731,5,B00GSA3TD6,"I saw this film at a screening in Los Angeles several months ago. The access, the footage and the music are pretty incredible. You'll get an amazing inside look at a wide variety of personalities, nationalities and sports. And I gotta hand it to the director: some of the athletes she focused on ended up emerging as some the Games' biggest stars. Check it out!",1386115200,2,361,4.569230769230769
8626732,5,B00GSA3TD6,Amazing film! Excellent depiction of the athletes! Definitely recommend it! You will learn something and have an emotional response to it as well.,1386028800,,146,5.391304347826087
