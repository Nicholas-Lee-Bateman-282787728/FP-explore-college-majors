5021789,5,B006VWHR0M,I researched a lot before purchasing these dvds.  I bought both Japanese and Spanish Language DVDs for kids.  They are both excellent.  I am very pleased with our purchase and would recommend them to everyone.  The kids learn Spanish without realizing it.  They love to repeat the different phrases.  Great customer service.  I called to ask questions and the staff is extremely friendly and helpful.  Thank you!,1335398400,,412,5.044776119402985

She was able to repeat most of the words and became very interactive with what she was viewing. Asking questions, dancing to the music with the dinos!!! I was amazed by its ability to hold Isabella's attention the entire 22 minutes that we were able to view. The interludes were perfectly placed as well!

I might even try it myself because I want to learn spanish and I think learning it this way to start may help adults retain what you learn.  My neice has a little one and I am going to buy it for him and will work with him so we will both learn.  :)

5021797,5,B006VWHR0M,"I being an influenster didn't get one(I wish I would have) but was able to watch previews via Vimeo, and I thought it to very cute. It is aimed at kids by being very animated, it does use both cartoon as well as real images. The speaking is very clear and able to be understood. It is very repetitive and easy to remember. The shows are easy for a small child to relate to and easy to follow along with. It contains a wide variety of words and pictures. These are very relatable to adults as well, though they are aimed at kids its easy and enjoyable to watch. Great product I wish I could have a copy of my own my kids would love it.",1343088000,,634,4.0396825396825395

My son is currently going through an early intervention for speech specialist and is still building his vocabulary. Although he didn't immediately pick up the words being taught, the show definitely kept his attention. I would really consider this DVD set once he's gotten to a better place with his speech progress in English.",1342569600,,444,5.013513513513513
5021806,3,B006VWHR0M,"My Opinion: The animation and graphics leave ALOT to be desired. My daughters are used to iPads and HDTV so this was not comparable and they let me know. However, I LOVE the concept and the program's curriculum. My 2-year-old was repeating Spanish words immediately and used them later. I was impressed! She really did get excited watching it and I was ecstatic to see her learning so quickly. This would be perfect for early learners trying to learn a second language as they learn their first. If the animation and graphics were improved this product would very much be work the $99.55 for me.",1342569600,,595,4.6761904761904765

5021809,4,B006VWHR0M,I tried this out thru Inlfuenster and I think I learned more than either of my boys! They got bored with the video quickly since there are a few parts that go a little too long with out any talking or interaction. But I have heard my 2 year old going around the house counting in spanish (even though it is out of order lol) I would be willing to buy these.,1342569600,,357,3.9722222222222223

I got to try the Dino Language DVDs courtesy of Influenster and have to say I was impressed we got to use the spanish lesson which was so much fun. My daughter loves Dora the Explorer so I used the Dino Language DVD in conjunction with watching Dora to help my daughter establish a 2nd language she's going well and will be fluent before she even gets to high school where a 2nd language is required to be learned.,1342569600,,480,4.404494382022472
5021811,4,B006VWHR0M,"I watched Dino Lingo Spanish 1 with my son and must say it was not at all what I was expected.  I found the voices sometimes too high-pitched for me.  I personally thought the video seemed a bit low budget and low tech, BUT, my four year old absolutely LOVED it!!  In the past 24 hours he has asked me to watch the dinosaur movie five more times.  He loved the dinosaurs (esp. the baby dinosaurs in the counting section) and the animals.  He was completely captivated by it and seemed to understand and retain a lot more than I thought he would from just watching it once.  I will definitely continue to let him watch the video as it does seem to be a useful learning tool for him.

I received a demo of the Spanish 1 video to review for free in order to provide my honest feedback from Influenster.",1342483200,,799,4.217105263157895

5021819,4,B006VWHR0M,"I think that it is a lot easier for children to learn a new language at a younger age because it doesn't come across as a chore to them, but rather a new and fun way to communicate.  I looked into the Spanish set before I made the purchase and I am glad I did.  The children are able to speak full sentences, although they really enjoy looking at pictures of objects and reciting the Spanish word for that object.  I would recommend theis set to others.",1342224000,,453,4.183908045977011

He's a little young, but my other two enjoyed it. They started learning some words in spanish. I think this is a great dvd so you can start kids out younger learning another language. With all the diversity in schools these days this is a major help. Especially since Spanish is a language you can take in school. They can now be a step ahead.

With kids at home due to summer break it's sometimes hard to find educational shows/dvd that can keep you little one's interested.  What I love about Dino Lingo it grabs little one's imagination with the bright colors and characters. The dvd also feature different languages including: English, Spanish and Dutch just to name a few.  My kids are in love.  I find the little one jumping around singing some of many songs.  He also learned how to say ""Dog"" but he says Dag ""Cat"" is Khat.  It's so cute. I think considering he's 1 yrs. old that's awesome.. My older child is learning Spanish..

I wanted to fairly review this item and not having younger children of my own I enlisted my friends 7 year old. We sat down at the computer and I asked her which language she would like to learn. She seemed VERY excited to try out Spanish (I blame Dora! Hehe) From the moment the video started, she was HOOKED. Half way through she was chanting ""Rawrrrrr estes es un leon!"" LOL This video was great! So easy to understand and lots of fun, vibrate pictures and cartoons. After it was all said and done, (and a few minutes of begging for a replay) her mother was so impressed by her interest we decided to go to the website and check it out. That's where we found out not only do they have videos, but CD's. books, poster, games, songs, flash cards and more! They take learning in stages.

I was very surprised, because he never watch a video and then tried to reenact anything. This was the first time that he did that. So to me I feel that Dino Lingo motivates the kids to speak the different language and not only that but makes it easy for them to understand the language and repeat. My kids were watching the Dino Lingo Spanish video and I am definitely going to purchase different languages, for them to learn.
I recommend every parent to try these videos for their kids. Now and in the future it is very important for a person to know multiple languages. You can go a long way knowing more knowledge. For more information you can visit: [...]",1342051200,,1265,5.8432432432432435

My 5 and 3 year olds have already been paying attention to Spanish because of cartoons that they watch so they were very eager to learn more through the lesson!  I believe that the program is the #1 effective Spanish teaching program for children because it was very easy for the kids to learn and speak because they repeated words and gave you enough time to repeat the words back.",1341964800,,545,4.3861386138613865

I have a 9 year old and a 4 year old, and both of them loved the video, and had a lot of fun watching and learning the words and phrases.

However, he sat through the ENTIRE lesson and seemed to absolutely LOVE it! He counted along with the dinosaurs and recognized some animals, and learned a new word or two! I had my doubts before we watched the lesson, but as I watched it with him, I realized how educational it was. The characters do silly things to keep the child's attention, which I even chuckled at!

5021866,5,B006VWHR0M,This is worth the money! My kids learned and picked up very fast and love the way the program is built. I will be looking into buying another set soon as i think a child who knows more then 1 Language is very important.,1341878400,,219,4.0

5021882,5,B006VWHR0M,I recently was given a demo version of this product and I must say it is a great learning tool for children! I was playing it for my step-kids that are in their teens and after watching it we all were walking around reciting phrases from each chapter. The characters are very interactive and the phrases are easy to pick up. I would highly recommend this to anyone wanting to teach their children a second language since this is something you can pop into the DVD player and let them listen to it all day. They will pick it up and learn quickly! I sure started to!,1341792000,,564,4.280373831775701

5021886,4,B006VWHR0M,"Cute dinosaurs guide you through this language program as your little ones watch and learn Spanish vocabulary and conversation language.  I watched the first disk as a preview to the program.  This is not Pixar quality animation, but it combines digital & traditional animation with real video footage to show the Spanish in action.  I especially loved how the program uses repetition and builds on ideas of colors, plurals, and ""in context"" phrases.  First you see a bird, then two birds, then a blue bird, then ""There are seven birds: 1, 2, 3,..."" all in Spanish with the words on the screen.  There appear to be quite a few resources available with this program besides the disk and also the program comes in a variety of languages.  My only problem with this is the price, which is probably spot-on for a quality language program, but seems a little too high for the casual ""educational"" video just for fun or entertainment.  I think if you are committed to your child learning Spanish or another language, this is a fun way for them to learn.  If you just want them to know some basic numbers and colors, you can probably stick to Dora.",1341792000,3,1141,4.641791044776119

8505161,3,B006VWHR0M,My 4 year old loves the videos...however they do not play in all DVD players. I have a 2003 Honda with a factory DVD player in it and they will not play in there. We have long commutes to see specialists and I wanted to use these as an educational tool while on these long trips. For the price I wish I could play them anywhere I wanted. Oh well.,1529539200,,346,3.9571428571428573
8505162,1,B006VWHR0M,"I bought the DVD set (without the flash cards) a few years ago. Not Spanish, but they look like the same videos, only edited for different languages. The whole thing looks like a teenager made the videos on some primitive software. But my kids don't mind that. However, the videos present a bigger problem than that. Every few minutes there are some meaningless short clips thrown in, that have no educational value whatsoever. An about 33 minute video (DVD#1) has 7 minutes of those totally unrelated clips. E.g. Dinosaurs watching other dinosaurs on tv, almost 2minutes of a robot taking care of a flower, dancing guinea pig, dancing pencil, etc. all those have no words, just videos. Not even related to the subject being taught.
Now, you may need to preview some of those clips, because there are a couple of highly inappropriate ones:  1. A smiley face turns around and MOONS the viewers! (I'll try to post pictures), 2. A video of a bunny that grabs cut wires, electrocutes himself and dances as a result (DVD#2). I can imagine little kids learning a very wrong lesson from that!
As a mom and a language teacher, I think it is a useless product. The DVD labels are not printed professionally. They're done on a DVD printer. This looks like a product of somebody's home little business. They are asking way too much for that.",1433808000,14,1330,4.683760683760684
8505163,4,B006VWHR0M,"Since we received the disk a month ago, my 3 year old has watched the first DVD at least twice a week and he now names the cat and the neighbor's dog properly in Spanish.  He recognizes the names of the colors, but says them improperly, and can count to 10 in Spanish.  I've been speaking words in both English and Spanish for awhile now, but it never stuck.  Now, after watching this 40 minute show 8 times and repeating the words as they say them (and he repeats all of them as they're said), they've stuck.  I'm amazed by this program.  I received the first disk through an Influenster program, and I plan on saving up to purchase the the rest of the program for my home childcare.

I knocked a star off as the graphics aren't amazing, and I really don't want to listen to my son repeat the words that the TV says, but it's still an awesome educational show to put in while I'm making dinner/doing the dishes!",1361664000,2,912,4.273255813953488

My boys are learning Spanish in school, so I figured my youngest would love Dino Lingo. This DVD is Amazing!! I must say that the characters and the content is excellent. My youngest's Spanish teacher  was impressed after my son came to her class the other day. He was answering her questions about pictures she was holding up. I must say that my youngest also loves to sit down and watch the dvd. He loves dinosaurs, so this kept his attention. It really made his learning fun and entertaining at the same time. I may be looking into purchasing a few more videos since he truly enjoyed Dino Lingo. Again, I thank Influenster for giving me the chance to try out this awesome series.

8505167,1,B006VWHR0M,"There are plenty of other wonderful, far superior products for young children in Spanish language.  I would not recommend buying this overpriced and under-delivered package.  It is disjointed by using both real people and cartoons and by moving from the dino's to the present time throughout the product.  The lines are uninspiring and the music is annoying.  The flash cards are cheaply made and will not last long due to its thin paper. Get the Trend Enterprises Spanish Flash Cards like ""Things Around the House"" and ""Verbos""  instead. As a mother of two early learners, I recommend instead awesome Speekee DVD/CD/booklet set from the United Kingdom, my baby used to fall asleep with the music and still asks for Speekee CD/DVD at 22 months of age.  This is an outstanding product, very enjoyable to listen to and to watch.  Other products we enjoy are:  the Lyric Language Spanish Bilingual Live-Action DVD and Audio CD, beautifully made with great pictures, music and lines, displayed on the screen; Hola Amigos 3 DVD Set, which is a cute well made cartoon with a story about a dog called Paco and his family, also containing lines on the screen; and Whistlefritz' various Spanish DVD's and CD's, which are very enjoyable to experience and I hope that they will be expanded one day into a wholesome program. So, please before spending your hard earned money, take a look at your many other choices for Spanish before committing yourself to this large expenditure.  Unlike other languages, you have product choices with Spanish.",1357257600,21,1532,4.953125
8505168,4,B006VWHR0M,"Irish is not yet available on Amazon, but I wanted people to know it is out there. I have been looking for an ""Irish for kids"" DVD for almost 10 years and was very excited when I saw that it was available through Dino Lingo. My kids are 10, 7 and 6. We have played all five videos in the car during the long holiday car-rides. The 10 year old finds it to be ""for babies."" The other two have enjoyed it, and even the 10 year old is learning! The vocabulary is good, as is the grammar, pretty much the kind of stuff you would find on any baby learning video. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was the pronunciation. The accent is a little off, very ""American-Sounding."" However, I have to admit that it makes it easier for the boys to approximate correct pronunciation than my Rosetta Stone version did. We haven't done anything but the videos yet, but I am already pleased.",1356912000,,879,4.238095238095238

The lesson I viewed was in Spanish and taught numbers and the names of several animals. What a great way for young children to learn a language. It shows both animation and real images which I think is important. The animation is very colorful to capture your child's attention. They speak very clearly and repeat the words several times so that it easy enough for a small child to understand. Even as an adult I enjoyed the lesson and learned a few things as well.
I think this is a great product. I would recommend it to other parents of young children as a language teaching tool.",1343520000,,757,4.338028169014085
