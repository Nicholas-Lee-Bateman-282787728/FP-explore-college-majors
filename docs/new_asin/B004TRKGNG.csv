4466000,4,B004TRKGNG,"I've found that music concerts provide some of the highest rated DVDs of those reviewed by non-professionals.  No surprise I guess.  Most of us are going to buy/rent concert performances by our favorite artists, so yes we like them.  Back when the decade of the `80s began, Rickie Lee Jones came to the musical scene as an edgier version of Joni Mitchell who was at the height of her popularity.  As a talented singer/songwriter Jones gave audiences some great memorable songs.  Most are repeated here, but with slants different than what you might remember on the radio.  Ms. Jones earlier albums, including the self titled debut and ""Pirates"", were in heavy rotation in my house at the time and perhaps had a minor role in bringing my oldest child into the world.  I had lost track of her musically until recently as I've been diving into my old vinyl collection.  This 2010 concert shows Jones little worse for wear.  Sure she looks older, but don't we all.  She's still feisty and her strong voice is intact.  On the downside, her two man band (drummer and electric bass) are not always in synch with her, especially on vocals.  It's just a little distracting on a few songs.  The concert is directed by Grammy nominated Ian McCrudden, so from that perspective is very well done.  The camera movements, fades and dissolves are perfect for this mostly quiet show.  The 5.1 Dolby sound is just fine although it is missing from the ""B-Sides"" which consist of 4 additional songs.  And for the record, don't skip them.  I'm not sure why they weren't included in the main event as they are some of the best.  And why just in stereo?  Is it that expensive to just do the whole thing in 5.1?  In any case, fans should like this RLJ concert film.",1316649600,6,1741,4.590909090909091
4466001,5,B004TRKGNG,"I purchased this DVD earlier this year (legitimately) so not sure what's going on with this July release but anyway ...

I had the pleasure and privilege of seeing RLJ perform live twice last year. For days afterwards I was floating on this perfect bubble of musical wonderment. This DVD captures the heart of her concert experience, it captures the spirit of the woman and is quite simply a magical couple of hours. Standout tracks for me are Wild Girl, Bonfires, Young Blood and We Belong Together. And also all of the others and everything that she says between tracks. Seriously, I waited 25 years to see her live and in the space of one year got two shots at that and a live DVD. She does put a different spin on some of the numbers, different to the original recording so if you want a live reproduction of a studio produced song then you may be disappointed but I don't think anyone that is a true Rickie fan will allow this DVD to leave their sight. It's an absolute keeper",1311811200,9,981,4.419889502762431
4466002,5,B004TRKGNG,"I have been a fan of RLJ for a long time. Her Wiltern DVD is among my very favorite. When Rickie emailed me and told me to get this DVD of course I said, ""YES!"" I've seen it from beginning to end three times in just three days. The chemistry between Rickie, the bassist and drummer is amazing. Even more amazing is who truly masterful RLJ is on the guitar! The singing and harmonies are out of this world. This is truly the best live music DVD I've ever seen. Gorgeous songs from Balm in Gilead and songs from her debut release from 1979. It's too perfect to even describe. Any RLJ fan will be overwhelmed by this performance captured perfectly on dolby 5.1 DVD.",1306022400,5,662,4.304

8440832,5,B004TRKGNG,"A concert of the highest order. Rickie performs with minimal backing (bass and percussion), and carries the night on acoustic and electric guitar, as well as piano. Her vocals are spot-on. This is one of the finest performances by this often-overlooked artist and songwriter. The quality of her songwriting and the presentation of her songs is immaculate, poignant, beautiful, touching, and always moving. Do yourself a favor and get a copy of Live In Stockholm.",1456185600,2,462,5.173333333333333
8440833,5,B004TRKGNG,I am real impressed with this show. I must say that I've been in love with Rickie Lee Jones's music since 1979 when she released her first album. She is a very strong song writer and tell great stories in just about all she writes. One day I hope to catch a show. I would higly recommend this DVD to anyone who is deeply in love with music...,1454803200,3,342,4.044117647058823
8440834,3,B004TRKGNG,"First and foremost, I am a fan of Rickie Lee Jones. I have her first 4 CDs, which I love and listen to quite often. I hate to give this DVD a 3 star rating, but I just couldn't go any higher. The problem is, and this is strictly my own personal opinion based on my own taste, the show wasn't big enough.

Rickie can still sing and play just as well as she did when she first hit the scene, but this concert is like an unplugged version. There are only two other gentlemen on stage with her. A bass player, and a percussionist, whom you can't hear very well. They both provide some minor backup vocals, but nothing spectacular. Rickie's also changed the traditional arrangements of the songs.

I was hoping for an all out band on stage. Drums, bass, guitars, keyboards, backup singers, horns, etc. Go to You Tube and look up, Rickie Lee Jones 1979 Youngblood. That's what I was hoping for. No such luck.

Some people may enjoy these unplugged shows with changes to the song arrangements, and that's great. It's just not for me. Her DVD, ""Live at the Wiltern Theatre,"" if you can get a copy, is much better. I'll hang on to ""Live in Stockholm,"" but it may be awhile before I watch it again. Sorry, Rickie.",1403568000,,1203,4.337777777777778
8440835,3,B004TRKGNG,"Lush studio production really helped her back in the day. The songs on the albums were like paintings for the ears. But this live version of her stripped-down band, a three-piece, does not do justice to the songs. Her voice is pretty good and she can still hit the high notes, but the drummer just sits there much of the time and she actually gets pissed at him, pounding out a beat on the piano top for him to play and he looks stunned. To be fair, when they do get it right, she tells them so and those songs work pretty well. I was just expecting a bigger band and sound.",1378339200,2,574,4.133928571428571
8440836,5,B004TRKGNG,I have admired RLJ for many years but had never experienced her music in person.  This performance reconnected me to her wonderful sound.  She has a special voice that she uses like an instrument and gives her audience a truly heartfelt and spiritually poetic artistic gift.  She's one of a kind.  Thanks.,1358812800,,305,4.8076923076923075
8440837,5,B004TRKGNG,"The performance and technical quality here are both superlative.  Rickie Lee Jones excels in pop, jazz, blues, r&b--and she displays an unusual command of the stage.  Great selection of material and I think her two accompanists augment the music quite well, both instrumentally and vocally.  Particularly amusing is RL's comment on encores--""When I'm done, I'm done.""  One minor complaint:  the four extra songs under ""B Sides"" could and should have been integrated into the main show.  Otherwise, any fan of RLJ will thoroughly enjoy having this show.  It's good to know that she's still going strong at this time.",1324166400,5,615,5.151515151515151
8440838,5,B004TRKGNG,"I've been waiting for another Rickie Lee Jones live DVD for some time, I'm glad that someone decided to put it out. She's great! She does 15 songs on the DVD plus 4 B-sides. All of them are excellent, but my favorites were It must be love, Chuck E's in love, Danny's All Star Joint, We belong together, Weasel and the white boys cool and Young blood.",1320624000,3,350,4.2388059701492535
8440839,4,B004TRKGNG,"pleased I bought it, has some great moments and she is an astonishing musician. Low point is that drummer! Is he a drummer? DId he add anything?",1316908800,,144,4.37037037037037
