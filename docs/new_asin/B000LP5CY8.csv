2711529,1,B000LP5CY8,"I'm beside myself that after so many years, Sony has yet to give Stooges fans what they deserve. A fairly priced set, or sets, of ""ALL"" stooge shorts. Completey remastered, completely uncut and in chronological order. As the years go by, and we keep getting these horrible releases, I'm starting to think that it may never happen. This will be the fourth colorized set, and once again, some of the included shorts have already been released. And how in the world do they justify the $24.99 list price for 4 17 minute shorts? Now I know they were originally theatrical shorts, but since the late 50's, they have been mainly TV programs. The upcoming ""All In The Family, Season 6"" by Sony has a list price of $29.95. 24 episodes, 24 minutes each. Why won't they price Stooge discs acordingly? As a very large lifelong Stooge fan, I'm downright sick of this. Look at what Universal has done for Abbott And Costello fans with thier franchise sets. Sony needs to wisen up and and give Stooge fans what they deserve.",1168732800,17,1010,4.616666666666666
2711530,5,B000LP5CY8,"I don't care if people don't like the Color DVD version of the Stooges, but look at the great job they have done restoring the Black & White versions of the shorts. Compare the shorts that were released a few years ago on DVD to the newer releases of the Black & Whites versions on the new color DVD. What a difference. THey look much better. I'm a Stooge fan, and I don't mind spending the money for better quality, even if I do already own the shorts.",1166313600,6,453,4.159090909090909
2711531,1,B000LP5CY8,"""Hapless Half-Wits"" is clearly what Sony thinks of the people who would be interested in buying this atrocity... only four shorts, two of them on DVD already, and -- yes -- they're colorized. (I know you can ""turn off the color"", but that's a small consolation for being asked to pay $25 for only 2 shorts you don't already own on DVD.)

Sony is coming close to getting a ""Worst DVD Producer EVER"" award for these Stooges monstrosities.",1165795200,24,436,4.589743589743589
2711532,1,B000LP5CY8,"Two of the shorts on this disc....have already been released on OTHER Columbia/Sony DVD's. The only difference is that these shorts are colorized and the others are not. So...that justifies Sony's hefty price tag on the DVD's right? I don't think so.

First off..I don't mind the colorized shorts, in fact..I think that they look decent..and is a new way to enjoy your stooge shorts. BUT..us stooge fans have been waiting..for the other 100+ stooge episodes..that have not been released...not the same stuff that has been recycled for the past 5 years or so. The colorization is fine, but at least..give it to us with NEW Content...not the same old..stuff..that we already have on DVD.

Clearly, the people in control at Sony...dont know what they are doing, and furthermore they don't understand their market. They key is here: NEW SHORTS that have NOT been released on DVD already. The colorization is fine, but it is not..what makes me want to buy this DVD..it would be a nice accent..to NEW SHORTS...but..it is not the decisive factor for me, when buying a TS DVD. Even if Sony were to pick the sucky ones...AT least...it is new..DVD content..and not something we already have.

This DVD is a joke, and only a sap or a lamebrain would produce this..or buy it. Hopefully...they don't decide to garbagize their supposed upcoming ""Box sets"". I hope, that it is a chronological set of EVERY stooge short...but..I have a feeling..its going to be somewhat of a tragedy. But time will tell.

I only give this one star...because there is ONE new short on this DVD, ""I'll never heill again""..which is good, and a good choice. Too bad..it had to show up on this mess of a dvd as a debut.

DONT BUY..this overpriced messterpiece!!",1176422400,2,1723,4.8074324324324325
2711533,1,B000LP5CY8,"The Three Stooges made 190 short films.  Rather than putting care into complete, chronological sequenced box sets, Sony keeps dumping a random 4 shorts on overpriced discs.  Skip this.",1175644800,3,184,5.310344827586207
2711534,5,B000LP5CY8,"""purists"" moan and groan about coloring old movies. Don't they realize that you can watch this DVD in perfect black and white restorations AND/OR amazing colorized versions by simply clicking your remote. These people need to realize that these processes are quite expensive to carry out. A large new audience has been drawn in by the color versions which helps defray the restoration expense. The new colorizing process is a VAST IMPROVEMENT over the washed-out, vapid colors that were the rule in the old Turner process used in the 1970s and 1980s!!! I frankly beg my purist friends to watch the miracle with open minds. PLEASE !!! BRAVO SONY !!! ORDER THESE DUAL RESTORED VERSIONS TODAY.",1174867200,4,690,4.956896551724138
2711535,1,B000LP5CY8,"I don't know who's in charge of the stooge shorts but it is a scandal what they're doing, piece-mealing them out a few at a time and not even showing the whole show in its entirety. Why there is not a comprehensive, unedited, and remastered box set of these legends is beyond me. Be like me and boycott until they do it right. I actually like the coloring as an option, if it is able to be turned on or off.",1174089600,3,407,4.037037037037037
2711536,1,B000LP5CY8,"....to buy these things, folks. The so-called ""big draw"" here is the colorizing of these shorts. Personally, I hate this. How do the manufacturers know just what color of shirt Curly wears, the cars they drive, etc. You guys know what I mean. It's totally FAKE!!!
Sure, it would have been nice if these had been FILMED in color, but they weren't. And really, who cares? I love the Stooges in spite of all that.
And to beat it all, some of these shorts HAVE ALREADY BEEN RELEASED!!! This is a ripoff, folks! No one should buy these. I'd love to know whose bright idea this was to release these DVDs in this manner. They should have their heads examined.
And the PRICES! Simply outrageous. What TS fan is going to pay close to $20 or more just to double-dip on shorts they more than likely already have? Doubtfully anybody with even a tenth of Curly's brain power.
As far as content goes, the Three Stooges always get five stars from me. Even their worst is better than most. But these ""color"" releases just have to stop! Find a company who will give these shorts the love and care they deserve at a price we can all live with. And ditch the stupid ""colorizing"" garbage!
These guys deserve better than what they've ever gotten! And I for one would like to thank them for all the laughs and memories they've given all of us Three Stooges fans everywhere.",1172880000,8,1351,4.451612903225806
2711537,1,B000LP5CY8,"colorizing the stooges borders on like the perverse. i have not bought one of these ""collections"" in quite some time and really why would any true stooge fan waste his/her money on something he/she already has AND is colorized?  its as if the knuckle heads in charge of the stooge shorts hold us in contempt. give them less, charge them more, edit with a hacksaw and then DEmaster the whole mess. my recomendation is to boycott this shameful nonsense. hapless and halfwited indeed.",1172448000,9,481,4.795180722891566
2711538,5,B000LP5CY8,"Yes!!! Finally, Columbia has released more Colorized shorts from the vault. I have waited for these for a long time.

Yes, there is a repeat on here with Brideless Groom, but the previously released colorized versions (as it has been colorized twice before from two other companies) use a much more inferior print of the film to work with, while Columbia's print is pristine and looks wonderful.

Yes, I do agree that Columbia needs to put out more shorts that have not made it to dvd, and that 4 per dvd on these sets is not enough. However, I am happy with the quality, I love the fact that with the colorized versions, I am able to see details that i never previously picked out while watching the black and white versions, and I am happy that these are restored sound and picture quality, allowing me to even hear some things that I've never picked up on before. Hopefully with the next dvds, Columbia will issue some shorts that are not yet available on dvd at all.

This dvd was a long time coming as it is, and I hope the next batch does not take as long.",1171929600,5,1062,4.353535353535354
2711539,2,B000LP5CY8,"I don't mind the colorization because it looks great BUT how many versions of ""Brideless Groom"" do we need both in color or b&w? which leaves us with three shorts that haven't been colored yet,of curse which leaves us with only two shorts to not have released on dvd before,since two of these shorts have been released, so you're paying for two shorts...I like the idea of some shemp shorts but  for pete's sake release some of his shorts that haven't seen the light of day on dvd not ""Brideless Groom"" which has been released over a thousand times since it's public domain (yes even in color a few times)also when will we see some shorts with larry moe and JOE in them ,it's better than getting the same stuff over and over again since there isn't one dvd that has anything to do with Joe...............",1171843200,4,804,4.506849315068493
2711540,1,B000LP5CY8,I can get past the colorization but I will never get past the fact that there are only 4 shorts on the DVD and theY're the same old re-cycled ones. There are dozens of episodes sitting in the vaults waiting to see the light of day and we're still getting 'Brideless Groom'. Please do not spend your money on this rip-off. Send a message to SONY...WAKE UP SONY !!!!!!,1171843200,5,366,4.318840579710145
2711541,2,B000LP5CY8,"This is an absolutely ridiculous waste of a disc.  Besides the obvious issue of colorising black and white classics that generations have been enjoying without feeling they're missing much because they're not in color, there are only 4 shorts on this disc, and two of them have already been released (one of them many many times over).  If one counts the black and white and colorised versions as separate entities, there are actually 8 shorts on here.  I guess it makes too much sense to Columbia to have released a disc with 8 all new-to-DVD shorts, and then, if they had to, including optional colorised versions, as was done on the British Laurel and Hardy boxed set.  People who prefer the films the way they were originally released and the way they've been enjoyed for decades can watch them in the black and white, and the small minority of people who are heartily cheering on this artificial colorisation can choose to watch them in that incarnation.  Yes, you can choose which versions to watch, but there are still only 4 shorts on here, with only two new to DVD (and only one of those two worthwhile), and for a higher price than is merited for such a small amount of material!  (Who are these people who are gushing about how great color is anyway?  One would think that classic comedy is just about the only thing immune to modern-day whining about how it's inferior just because it's not in color.  It makes no sense for someone who was introduced to the shorts in their original black and white and who has loved and enjoyed them that way for years to now be singing the praises of watching them in this fake-looking Chroma Color.  It may look better than the colorisation of the Eighties, but it still doesn't look entirely natural, and actually seems jarring and even wrong for the Stooges to be in color, since they just exist in black and white for all time.)  And of course, as with the other three colorised discs, since there are only 4 shorts apiece, it's asking the consumer to pay a lot more for a lot less, and all while we're still waiting on the nice boxed sets that are supposed to be coming in the foreseeable future.

It seems as though the people putting this disc together just randomly drew titles from a hat.  'Brideless Groom' (1947) is a classic and seems to be most people's favorite Shemp short, but since it's one of the 4 public domain shorts, it's been released over and over again.  Sometimes overexposure can make even a great thing seem boring.  This also isn't the first time it's been colorised.  The other Shemp short included here, 'Dopey Dicks' (1950), was previously released on the (rather awful) 'Merry Mavericks' DVD.  This is a really good short, but again, why is it being released again when it's already available on another disc?  God forbid they select some Shemp shorts that are languishing away on out of print videos, like 'Goof on the Roof' and 'Fuelin' Around' instead of double-dipping with ones that are already available elsewhere.

'Beer Barrel Polecats' (1946) is easily one of the worst shorts of the Curly era, right down there with the likes of 'Back to the Woods' and 'Restless Knights.'  I just about went into shock the first time I saw it, since he looks, talks, and acts like a ghoul, a far cry from the way he had been just a few years previously.  It's so obvious he's a very sick man and was being worked practically to death during this period.  Harry Cohn was truly a scummy slavedriver.  To add insult to injury, most of the short is cobbled together from footage from the far superior 'So Long, Mr. Chumps' and 'In the Sweet Pie and Pie,' though it looks like these three shorts were edited together with a rusty axe.  There's no continuity or explanation of important plot points that suddenly make no sense when edited into the new short, like why they're looking for prisoner 41144 or why they're being sentenced to die for smuggling beer into prison.  Even the A/V quality in this one is atrocious.  The ending also makes no sense.  I can't believe this terrible offering is being released on DVD.  Probably the only reason I can see for anyone to be buying this DVD is because the classic 'I'll Never Heil Again' (1941) is *finally* making its debut on DVD.  It's too bad such a classic is making its debut on this of all things, instead of on a disc with a normal amount of shorts or a proper boxed set.

Once again Columbia/Sony is NOT giving the fans what they've been asking for for years.  Who thought this marketing strategy would be a good idea?  This really is an appropriate title, since this disc was created by hapless half-wits and is going to be bought by hapless half-wits.  The only reason I'm not giving it a one-star rating is because three of the four shorts included are great, even if two of them are repeats and all of them are included on a joke of a disc like this.",1168905600,34,4879,4.540571428571429

8162794,4,B000LP5CY8,"These are Great Timeless Slapstick Comedy Shorts from the 1940s and well worth the 14 dollars for the Colorized versions. The titles are---
  Beer Barrel Polecats (1945) (with Curly)
  I'll Never Heil Again (1941)  (with Curly)
  Dopey Dicks (1949)  (with Shemp)
  Brideless Groom (1947)  (with Shemp)
  These are a first for me to see the Shemp verions Colorized and they all look better being colorized. I know some extremists will be upset about the colorization, but they can view them in Black & white if they choose to.
  I really liked them all except for ""I'll Never Heil Again"" which I thought was a little boring. I'd like it if Columbia Pictures would colorize some more of these shorts in the future.",1271289600,,712,4.721311475409836

8162796,4,B000LP5CY8,"I just rented this DVD and I'm very impressed with the restoration and colorization.  I only noticed one place where the inside of shemp's mouth was a little purple.  Not bad.  In past colorizations, the inside of mouths were very noticibly purple.  But even then, I prefered colorization.

Colorization is great because it makes things clear and realistic.  B&W makes things unclear.  Expressions are harder to see.  Grey faces fade into the grey background.  We see color in real life, so a color movie is realistic and easier to immerse ourselves in and suspend disbelief, making it more enjoyable.

I have over 100 stooge shorts, but don't have two on this disk:  Beer Barrel Polecats and I'll Never Heil Again.  I plan on buying this because of those two, and also I want the colorized versions of the two I already have.",1191110400,,826,4.73943661971831
8162797,5,B000LP5CY8,"I agree it would be nice to see more shorts on one disc, but I must applaud the producers of this DVD for making raising the bar on quality.  Being a fan, I've seen these shorts at least a hundred times before, but the picture and sound was so remarkable, it felt like I was watching it for the first time.  I think the research and development of these shorts kind of justifies the price.  They don't just pick a color.  They actually look things up to see what color various clothing and props were at the time and make things as accurate as possible.  The color is amazing.",1179187200,2,576,4.247706422018348
8162798,5,B000LP5CY8,"As one of the biggest Three Stooges fans around, I'm puzzled as to why so many of the reviews for these ""colored"" series are so harsh.

When VHS tapes came out, we paid $30 for three shorts. Then the price dropped to $15 for three titles.

With these current DVD's, there are four titles with impecible restored quality for the same price as the latter VHS format. Each short on the new DVD comes to $5 per episode. No more low contrast, dust, lines, muffled sound. While I will always prefer the original black and white format to the color (which looks good with the exception of the skin tones), if all we had to choose from was the color version, I could see what all the fuss is about. These prints look like they were filmed this morning. The quality is amazing!

As most Three Stooges fans would want a comprehensive set that chronicles the shorts in order (and I'll include myself in this desire), I'd rather have four shorts that look and sound beautiful to earlier releases. Compare these restored shorts to the quality of the prints on earlier DVD releases like ""Curly Classics"". It's like night and day.

As for another ""Brideless Groom"" entry, it's really like seeing it for the first time. In all past releases (including its previous DVD premiere), the scene with Shemp shaving always had an abrupt blackout which has been corrected here.

It seems to me that people are reviewing these discs without actually viewing them ( or as Curly might say, ""I've got my eyes closed"".) You have the choice to view these episodes in restored black and white or with the computerized color.

Until there is a proper chronilogical ordered release, the current series should be getting higher praise. The care that has gone into restoring these 70+ year old shorts is nothing less than breathtaking.",1178150400,8,1800,4.680379746835443
