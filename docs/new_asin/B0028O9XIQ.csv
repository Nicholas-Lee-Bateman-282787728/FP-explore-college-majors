8356511,5,B0028O9XIQ,"This tale is not from Chaucer, but from Atwood. Natasha Richardson is Kate, a young fertile woman enslaved by a dystopian society where fertility is worth more than the life it produces. As creepy and disturbing as it is, particularly ""The Ceremony"" scene, it is still hopeful. Aidan Quinn, Robert Duvall, Elizabeth McGovern and Faye Dunaway all turn in magnificent performances.

This is Natasha Richardson's tour de force. She is radiant and heroic. Kate becomes Offred, but never loses herself.",1518307200,,497,5.2125
