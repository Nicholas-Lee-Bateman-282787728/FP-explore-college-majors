8354372,5,B0027AH73Y,"Everyone on the face of this planet should get to know Corrie ten Boom.  Yes, she has been gone from this earth for 26 years, but she is still ""here"" through her books and -- this -- an interview of her by Kathryn Kuhlman.  Kathryn is um... interesting shall we say, but it's easy to look past her and just focus on the faithful and courageous Corrie.

Corrie is one of the women who lived in a concentration camp (Ravensbruck) during the nazi occupation of Germany.  She and her sister, Betsy (who died there), gave hope and love to all of those very scared and hurting women they lived amongst.  I know many went to their deaths anyway, but they had the peace of knowing life-everlasting was waiting for them because Corrie & Betsie told them about the power of salvation through Christ Jesus.

You can read any one of her books and be blessed, but her first book, THE HIDING PLACE, is where to start.  She talks about those same experiences (from the book) during this interview.

You can watch the interview in pieces/sections on youtube, but of course I'd rather have it on DVD to watch anytime and anywhere.  I would also love to be able to buy many copies so that I can share it with as many people as possible.  Hopefully, somehow, it will become available again.  Anyone who knows how to get a copy of this PLEASE POST INFO in this review section so I can find it.",1247097600,3,1373,4.387351778656127
