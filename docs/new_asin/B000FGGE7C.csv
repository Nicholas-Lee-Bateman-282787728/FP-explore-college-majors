2564641,5,B000FGGE7C,Great movie!!,1517270400,,13,6.0
2564642,5,B000FGGE7C,Good movie but old enough it should be free on prime,1517097600,,52,3.8181818181818183
2564643,4,B000FGGE7C,"The first act alone is worth buying this movie: Violet making her escape after stealing ""The Weapon.""  It's a great extended chase across town on foot, motorcycle, and cars moving through, between, and across the buildings and streets of down town Shanghai (although in the movie it's an unnamed fictional town). The action scenes throughout the movie are artfully set against a great mix of techno and trance music that matches the ebbs and flows of the action. This, along with the fighting choreography being based on several forms of martial arts gives the whole experience a Matrix-like feel.

The second act runs a little slow (as they often do), explaining details of the backstory that weren't covered earlier and setting up conflicts that take place in the last third of the movie. Bear with it and it picks up again with more action, culminating in a satisfying ending.

I really can't decide if the CGI in this is terrible or exactly as was planned. Parts of it are not very realistic - in most of the long shots the vehicles look like they're made of plastic. But being that this movie is based on a comic, it may have been intentional for parts to have a semi-realistic look, because the graphics in the near and close-up shots are perfectly convincing, even for a movie over ten years old.

For fans of extra content, the behind-the-scenes chapters are about an hour, covering the making of all aspects of the film, interspersed with comments made by the cast and crew both on and off the set.",1516665600,,1507,4.675471698113207

2564646,1,B000FGGE7C,"Quite possibly the worst move I've ever seen. Perhaps someone really into anime or this comic would like it, maybe. It was 100% action, but when the character is basically invincible, immortal, and has godlike powers, it gets boring really fast.",1513555200,,245,5.0

2564649,3,B000FGGE7C,"I'm a fan of Mila but not the movie. I am not familiar with the comic book story, but found that the film lacked substance, meaning and plot. Most of all, I disliked the way the child was treated, with some scenes of child abuse (kid witnessing murders, being dragged around, shoved, shot at). Never enjoy movies where kids are mistreated or treated like items, weapons, soldiers, spies, killers, or anything that children should never be. The movie didn't leave a strong impression, although for someone who is into comic books and lots of fighting, this may be a decent flick.",1512777600,,578,4.732673267326732
2564650,1,B000FGGE7C,Worst acting ever by all the cast. It was embarrassing.  It felt like I was watching a high school film project. The camera angles and closeups were weird.

So bad...so very bad...,1512777600,,327,4.433333333333334
2564651,2,B000FGGE7C,"dialogue is 9th-grade writer quality, editing barely better. As for Milla, she may be beautiful, but her acting has only gotten worse in the last 25 years, which is to say that it started as amateurish and has progressed to laughably bad, not in the cute way.",1512777600,,259,4.531914893617022
2564652,5,B000FGGE7C,"This is a highly stylized graphic novel in movie form. Don't expect it to have a traditional story arc; it won't. What it does have is fabulous visuals, a strong female character kicking butt, and enough plot and character growth to make it a real story. It is more like a limited series of comic books that have a specific setting and story to tell. With comic books, it is more about the character than the story, and that is true of this movie as well. Ignore the plot holes and you will enjoy the visual story told in a series of style-over-substance vignettes. It truly is visually striking. In order to create the unique flow of the action sequences, not only are they highly choreographed, but they employed dancers instead of stunt men, which gives the action more of a flowing, stylistic, surreal feeling. These are very intense action sequences, but there is almost no blood; very true to the genre that spawned this movie. Taken in the right light, the movie is one of the best in its genre. Think of Trinity from the Matrix, on her own with a sword and two machine guns, ready to take out the bad guys and save the world.",1512345600,,1133,4.451923076923077

Even the sound quality is terrible and I can barely make out what the actors are saying, that might be a blessing in disguise because what I did hear was so lousy as to not be worth the effort. If all they had done is film Milla Jovovich strutting around in skin tight outfits it would have held greater interest.",1511568000,,462,4.383720930232558
2564664,1,B000FGGE7C,"Painful to watch. The comic book feel of some of the scenes was the only interesting part of the movie. The acting, terrible. Script, pretty empty, bordering on mind numbing. This movie might keep an 8 year old entertained. There are only so many badly done fight scenes with hoards of incompetent bad guys I could endure before I no longer cared whether the main characters escaped or not and just stopped watching. How this movie managed to get 4 stars is a mystery. Take Aeon Flux, add vampires then hope lots of CGI will make up for zero effort on plot or script.",1511568000,,567,4.461538461538462

The movie would have been better if the action was better. I am not an action expert but

looks like some fight scenes were lacking sophistication or were cut short? Not sure why-

Anyhow, an Ok movie to watch when you are bored-",1510358400,,394,4.328767123287672
2564680,5,B000FGGE7C,"Good Break From MainStream
If you watch the movie on it's tilt-side it should feel like it makes more sense, because the director bossly took mainstream and put it on its tilt.
People who don't like this movie obviously do not watch that many movies, vise versa i may feel the same way for low budget movies or (""Prom Night"" (2008) which i will be now talking about to describe why i was discontented by ""Prom Night"")) because of the annoying and abused, in the better sense it felt like they were abusing the thrill of the movie having too much screaming.....to the point where this high budget movie did not look at all sexy.......

Compared to the nice ass shots and North American/ (Is japan East Asian)Ori.......The movie is oriental in the respect to creating a fun videoscape that can be quite intricate in how the horizon can switch......watch the movie and if you're coming from the same movie background as me..... You'll enjoy the ride.

Mind you, the movie will have you in a dreamy state of mind and its hypnotic optimally. So, watch it before you go to bed, itll set you in a nice dreamy mood that will most likely lead to a nice thought provoking dream or maybe just a normal dream where its just nice or an adventure..... either way you will take something away from this dream......  and this movie.....

2564684,1,B000FGGE7C,"Wow, all I can assume is that the director and every actor working on this movie hated every second of it. Every single actor in it comes off as flat and lifeless, spitting their lines out while they try not to roll their eyes. The choreography might have worked with different camera angles, but the way they shot it makes it as blatant as possible that Milla's sword is three feet away from the bad-guys when they fall down. They don't bother to give good enough reasons why she can walk into a room of 50 guys with machine guns and mow them all down, because she's not actually doing anything special, she's just standing there while all the bad-guys incompetent themselves to death, which is pretty lazy writing and directing. I realize that the point is that she's supposed to be a mook-mowing bad-ass, but it doesn't come off that way, it just seems like she wins because everyone she encounters is a cartoonishly incompetent bumbling moron. Also the fuzzy-bright lighting makes it look like Milla has no nose.",1510099200,,1016,4.65

2564693,2,B000FGGE7C,"I think that Milla Jovovich makes a near perfect action star, but Ultraviolet just didn't work for me. I completely get what they were trying to do. The film was designed to look like a living graphic novel and or comic book as opposed to a movie based on a comic book. The problem for me was the color correction where they tried to make everyone look painted in a blown out kind of way was extremely distracting. Especially with the closeups. The digital effects were also poorly done from that standpoint as well. They wanted stylized, but it just looked shoddy. I appreciated the prologue at thew beginning but it wasn't enough to get me connect before diving right into the action and the script is pretty much a mess. The editing was also extremely choppy and all over the place.

she makes the most of it , with a decease that's slowly but surely killing her
and she has no way to fix it, she is a deadly female vampire assassin,
she kills whoever gets in her way, she ends up fighting the person that me the way she is
there is a lot fighting and acrobatics in this movie
buts it all worth it when you see why, it may get you to tears a few times, but just remember the words tears
because in the movie , tears has a lot to do with it!!
if you seen Electra or salt , you will love the female action in this movie",1501718400,,596,3.7007874015748032
2564730,5,B000FGGE7C,"You will either love or hate Ultraviolet there is no other movie that relates to this movie. The story and the vision of the movie reminds me of a comic book on steroids. The commentary on this DVD explained that the character V was created for Milla Jovovich specially by the director/writer. The setting of the movie is futuristic Asian animation type vision. V's is a courier who is on a job to pick up a package and delivery it to it's source with time restraints. The package is picked up, she is rushed by her superior to get the package, don't look inside and get the job done. Curiosity gets the best of her and she looks inside the package and her job as a courier is forgotten and now she protects the package containment's with her life. No longer does she intend to delivery the package to the owner, the owner is now her enemy who she wants to keep the package from.

During all of the drama, V is a tough cookie, a great fighter and her aesthetics with her hair changing color and futuristic weapons and never to forget her sword. The entire movie is in a ultraviolet glow and the story line is weird. Even though she is sick with a virus and will die she is action packed and good at what she does. Keep in mind this movie plays like a comic book/cartoon and not like the average action movie. The scenes are colorful and abstract so if you are looking for more reality scenes and concept look at another movie.",1501632000,,1426,4.32089552238806
2564733,4,B000FGGE7C,"I rewatched this for the first time in years and it is still a fun action film.  Milla Jovovich is Ultraviolet, a heroine infected with a vampire-like virus fighting against the 'Vice Cardinal' and his 'Arch Ministry' who wants to exterminate all vampires while protecting the young boy who may hold the cure.

The first 30 minutes or so are filled with the sort of stylish and stylized violence films from the 2000s loved in the wake of Crouching Tiger and the Matrix.  The use of color, perspective and twisting physics makes for a fantastic series (even if it doesn't make a lot of sense).  Some of the CGI is a bit dated (the helicopters in particular looked terrible) but overall it's a lot of fun.

The plot makes little to no sense if you think about it.  The bad guys' plots are especially incoherent, and their army's habit of standing in the open so they can be gunned down gets tiresome.  But in a cheesy summer movie way this is an enjoyable film.  And of course Jovovich is always fun to watch in an action movie.

There's apparently a few cuts of this film around, I have this version (the unrated extended) and it has the scenes with Ultraviolet's backstory and family.",1500336000,,1184,4.52112676056338
2564734,4,B000FGGE7C,"This dystopian sci-fi flick was not well received when it was first released in 2006.  On a budget of thirty million dollars, Ultraviolet made a grand total of thirty-one.one millionalmost a profit.

The story has something to do with super-human faux-vampires who haven't long to live, and the crazy Vice-Cardinal who took over the government with plans to wipe them out.  Violet (Milla Jovovich) is part of a resistance movement fighting to protect the almost-vampires.  She steals a weapon that isn't what anyone thinks it is but the government wants it back just the same.  There is a fight to the finish, literally.  Things don't really end well for anyone.

I didn't have high expectations so I rather liked it.  But the plot is very basic.  Theres plenty of action but its mostly the same type of action.  The villain is a run-of-the-mill loon.  The film looks very much like a cartoon or a video game; very stylized and stylish.  Theres no attempt to develop anyones character.  Its soulless and kinetic.  I liked it anyway.",1500076800,,1032,4.822857142857143

Dumb storyline, poor acting, worse screen play, confusing plot. stupid climax, terrible miniaturizations, and really weird special effects. The only thing I liked was Milla Jovoich, but due to poor directing her talents are wasted - she has done much better in other films. There are parts to this film that are just unbelievable. One scene shows Milla totally encircled by a couple dozen pistol wielding  gangsters who proceed to shoot each other down because of her ability to acobatically dodge bullets. Another scene has her defeating a 700 man para-military corporate army with a couple of inexhaustible pistols and a sword. This video requires the watcher to suspend all intellect and understanding of the laws of physics before watching.

I feel like I just bought a bootleg version of the movie! You're left wondering what the heck just happened in some scenes as it completely cuts parts out. I knew something was off when the first scene where she is describing the world she lives in didn't show the family with a kid dressed in all black and instead showed a guy with a red armband. I scoffed it off as an updated edited version that cut out a scene that might upset someone. However, I about shit bricks when I realized they cut out the scene where Violet evades the police by changing her hair color to purple and bumping into the Chinese chick in the mall with the same outfit and hair color. That whole scene is messed up and was turned into a nonsensical series of scenes where she runs up and down stairs. If you pay close attention, what Nevra says to her on the stairs doesn't make any sense because they cut the other scene where he first talked to her. There are a few more cuts and odd edits in the movie too, but those were the most obvious.  Wish I could get a refund for this.",1489536000,,1198,4.208695652173913

This movie feels like they are shoving an entire universe worth of books into two hours, which is what I assume actually happened. The plot is near incomprehensible until the villain actually explains what he's doing in a stereotypical ""villain's monologue"". Also, the introduction to the story that takes place at the beginning does NOT accomplish the task of actually making the audience sympathize with the heroine. I'm ten minutes in thinking, ""Wait. You're infected with something that reduces your life span to 12 years, but you want to kill humans to keep them from eliminating your plague desease?"" I'm sorry, but I'm already siding with the so-called villains if their goal is to eradicate a virus that could destroy humanity. Oh,  but wait! They aren't trying to save humanity. Of course, you don't know that until over an hour in after you've sat through yet another absurdly unrealistic battle scene and hair and clothes that change color for no discernible reason.

Like I said, I'm sure there is much more going on here that would be explained in comics, but movies aren't supposed to assume the audience knows the comic books.",1467158400,,1210,4.892682926829268

Strong female lead in Resident Evil and Fifth Element Milla Jovovich - CHECK!

Dope martial arts with cool special effects and visuals - CHECK!

Comic character - CHECK!

Intriguing futuristic timeline - CHECK!

Solid plot and story line - FAIL!!! It was horribly directed and confusing. Also corny lines.

*Spoiler* By the time you get to the scene that reveals a little boy is in the suitcase that she risked her life to get, the movie goes down hill from there. ONLY because the writers couldn't make up their mind what the boy's importance should be. First it's his blood will kill all hemophages (vampire virus infected people), but wait...no now his blood will kill all regular humans.

Then the main villain had these annoying ugly nose plugs and his motives for the boy were so unclear because of the plot back and forth. That killed the plot. Also the movie made Ultraviolet's character focus to be maternalistic, mommy wannabe that took away from her unique super power female role. I think the film writers/director wanted to make her relatable but she was supposed to be unique and unordinary comic super hero.

Another note: The movie X-Men: The Last Stand used the SAME boy actor in the SAME EXACT ""boy cure"" role in the SAME year (2006) ! TRIPLE FAIL for Ultraviolet! X-men used the boy's role better in the plot.",1438214400,,1373,4.739495798319328

Johnny Mnemonic Syndrome- A quality often found in cinema regarding a film's potential, often times an interesting premise containing details and a clear vision as given by the filmmakers, in which aforementioned film is poorly executed despite what potential it showed or may have had.

That's right, this movie is so disappointing that even the Oxford English Dictionary has grievances. Ouch.

Okay, 2006: if you had the choice between seeing this and seeing Casino Royale, never mind, i'm just gonna pretend like we all went and saw 007 like rational human beings. That's not to say that the people who went and saw, this, weren't exposed to a unique vision with some good action, cool gadgets, a fascinating plot line, and at least one awesome leading character. (Okay, did i just describe Casino Royale as well?)

Now, in terms of creative vision (per 2006) the only other movie that came out that year that rivaled this film in all the key check boxes (action, adventure, limited yet oddly involved plot) was 300, but with that said, neither of these films where on the level of A Scanner Darkly.

A Scanner Darkly was the stylized, intriguing, complex, and masterfully mind bending experience that was only rivaled by such other 2006 releases as Paprika, Pan's Labyrinth and The Prestige (Dang, it was a good year for the ""P's"" in Cinema)

And that's my review. The fact that i actually ended up talking about other movies (better movies) should tell you most of what you need to know about this film.

13%- Ultraviolet sports unique visuals, several well conceived action sequences, a fascinating universe and lore and an overall moderately original vision, look and feel, but suffers drastically from a lack of pacing, narrative coherence, even storytelling, or a sense of truly compelling weight

I do mean what i said though about all the cool stuff in the movie. I'd say at least go online and read about the movie; it's worth it.

2564843,5,B000FGGE7C,"Okay, I'm reviewing this movie featuring the phenomenal Miss Jovovich, because (besides the fact that I thought this was ANOTHER killer movie by MJ) but also because of the trivia I read that goes along with this one. I always knew that MJ was bad to the bone, but I had NO IDEA what she had accomplished by this point (and far earlier) in her career: This lady was modelling, acting, dancing, an established fashion designer, and IMMENSELY wealthy before she was even through her teens! And if that ISN'T so extraordinary in and of itself,  the fact that Milla --by the time most kids are thinking about starting Jr. High-- had a steel resolve fixed firmly in place that never wavered IS amazing. Throughout her early life, where most child prodigies crash and burn, tangled up within the pressures or vices that come with THAT much fame, she instead, had created an EMPIRE and drove forward to market herself into an astonishingly successful and extremely wealthy individual! Her workout regimen and uncompromising will power alone would have killed a lesser person. It made her a natural at movies like ULTRAVIOLET, and let's not forget the huge popularity that her physical and acting prowess gained her during the epic run of the Resident Evil franchise! By the time she began acting more or less full time, she could speak a dozen languages. Her I.Q. was off the charts. She had already amassed a HUGE fortune whilst most young adults were still struggling to ""find themselves"" as it were...This futuristic action movie is just one amongst many amazing films displaying her physical talents. BUT,  I also found this one interesting because of the maternal side her character shows towards the ""special chIld"" that's being pursued throughout the movie, proving that she can act as well as perform almost superhuman stunts. (Yes folks, she does most of her own stunts) Though Ultraviolet didn't quite do as well at the box office as some of her more popular classics like, The Fith Element, it was an amazing accomplishment nonetheless!..and the list keeps on growing..wow.",1430092800,,2077,4.914529914529915

2564852,4,B000FGGE7C,"I am a huge fan of Milla and although I liked this movie and own this edition on DVD, I wish we had the FULL edition. I have read one of the previous reviewers of this movie saying there were approximately 23 or so more minutes edited out of this ""unrated, extended"" edition. Well, that's the way it goes sometimes when moviemakers edit things they should have left alone in the first place, especially if it has to do with helping the plot/character development.
That aside, I love this edition! Stay away from the Blu-ray PG-13 crap they put out to try and make more $ from unwary fans of this movie. It probably won't look any better than this edition anyway. I found this to be clean and sound wonderful. The menu is great with music and easy selections. The movie itself is heavy CGI and as well as you know, most movies set in future are heavy CGI. Case in point, the movie ""Jupiter Ascending"" out now as of Feb., 2015. It's based on a comic book, so I don't take too much into whether the CGI is too real looking or not. I wasn't looking at the CGI to begin with! I had my eyes on Milla virtually the whole time. She looked good and she had some of the best fight scenes in a movie.

2564864,3,B000FGGE7C,"After trying and failing to watch an utter abomination unto sci-fi (*cough* ""Aeon Flux""), I feel compelled to write a review of a campy cyberpunk movie that I DID enjoy. No, ""Ultraviolet"" isn't that great of a movie; but it's good fun, and I did get invested in the story (goofy as it was).

The plot was pretty interesting. In the future, a fraction of the human race has been infected with a disease that turns them into vampires (or something), giving them super powers, but also....causing some terrible symptoms I'm sure. These people are targeted by the totalitarian government, and must defend themselves with all manner of creative weaponry and fight movies that make for a smashing action movie. Mixing vampires with cyberpunk is a weird choice, but I'll take it. I love genre mixing, and am generally open to anything new.

What really impressed me though was how the movie handled its heroine. With the plot stated above, the movie could easily have left Mila Jovovich's Violet as yet another ""sexy"" action girl, who's emotional side comes from a shallow love story with some hunk, and it would have been perfectly forgivable. But they didn't do that. Instead, she quickly becomes a protector and mentor to a little boy, and her motherly side is played up. I have a deep respect for any male writer/director who can recognize that women have important relationships outside of romance. Seeing a cussing, sword-weirding, sexy-outfit-wearing, badass action heroine trying to be a mom makes for many great moments, both in the drama and comedy departments. (The scene where she rides a merry-go-round with the kid, while still dressed in her ass-kicking gear, made me burst out laughing.)  And never once does the move make it seem like being an independent badass would conflict with being a mother.

The visuals are phony, but fun to look at. No, it doesn't create the heavy atmosphere that the sets of ""Blade Runner,"" ""Dark City"" and ""Total Recall"" did, but ""Ultraviolet"" takes advantage of its cheap CGI, creating a vibrant, bright world that could *only* be done with CGI. They don't try to fool you; the CGI here is for style, more than special effects.

Now I won't lie; this movie is at least 50% forgettable. Having watched it a few months ago, I truly can't tell you what most of the plot twists and turns were, what the bad guy wanted, and how everything worked out in the end. But I can say that as a cyberpunk junkie, this movie satisfied my need for a cyberpunk fix: as a feminist, I was impressed by the lead heroine and her conflicts; and as a rank sentimentalist, I really was rooting for Violet to save the kid and live happily ever after.",1417737600,,2665,4.72258064516129
2564865,5,B000FGGE7C,LOVE IT!!,1417651200,,9,4.0
2564866,5,B000FGGE7C,"Considered by some to be a sequel to Equilibrium, Ultraviolet is a ridiculous movie, and I love every ridiculous moment of it.

Its a comic book movie without a comic book, and is probably the best Japanese action film ever made, except it isn't Japanese. Seriously though, if you watched Casshern, Legend of Zu, etc, and loved the action and direction style but wished the story was more digestible (but not less non-nonsensical!) this movie is like a cinnamon roll with melted butter on top.

There is photo-shopping everywhere (my wife and I had a heated debate about whether Mila's mid-drift-baring-impossibly-sculpted abs are real). There is 1990's-looking CGI on everything. This is a PG-13 Milla Jovovich action film that looks like the love-child of The Matrix, Speed Racer, and every cool Japanese comic ever.

Did I mention the story is completely nonsensical (or at least feels that way)? The plot is silly. The dialog is silly. The action is beyond silly. One person can be surrounded by an army of guns and waif-fu their way through Hong Kong chop-socky style? Yes! And everything is bathed in gorgeous delicious sepia-tweaked color is Sky Captain the World of Tomorrow.

This movie is what a comic book would be if it were breathed into life. I like it when I saw it, but it gets better with each viewing. It's so good it's bad. It's so bad it's awesome. If you love a good action film in the Asian style but wished one starred action-girl Milla your time has come. Long live Gun Kata!",1417046400,,1499,4.731800766283525

In considering my ""Review"" of Ultraviolet, let me just say this: Ultraperfect.  That might as well be it.  What more needs to be said?  But wait, I shall say more.

This movie gestures greatness from all corners of it's being.  But how... Is it the fluid cinematography that sweeps across the screen under the guise of ultra-awareness, though never being so self-interested as to make a big show of it?  Or perhaps the unexpected delight of the character V's hair suddenly changing from black to a shockingly beautiful violet after performing what some might consider ""a badass move""?  Or maybe even Milla Jovovich's mind blowing audio commentary that should not be overlooked?

This is not for me to say.  It is for everyone to see.  For none should sleep tonight till the Ultraviolet light has descended upon them.  Whether in the den of their sunken living room in a generic private neighborhood with small trees that have just been planted and will not grow until the parents have divorced and the kids have begun failing school, or from your iPhone on a busy subway in a concrete jungle where all but a sliver of sunlight is left to forge through massive monolithic structures filled with business people trudging through life, or even may haps your laptop as you open the file from an illegal downloading program that the NSA has already catalogued you for, it is in your favor.

Director: Kurt Wimmer
Writer: Kurt Wimmer
Secondary character: William Fichtner

Plot summary:
In the future, an oppressive, militaristic, World-wide religious government uses chemicals/medicine
as part of its enforcement regime.  Rebels toting swords and infinite ammo pistols want to destroy
the government. Our hero decides to help the rebels. After killing many many assault-gun wielding,
black-faceplate-helmet wearing guards/police, the hero eventually faces the head of government and
kills him after an extended sword and pistol fight.

===Differences (between ""Equilibrium"" and ""Ultraviolet"") ===

Equilibrium (2002)
Christian bale is an enforcer (cleric) for the world government. After failing to self-inject himself
with a government mandated emotion-suppressing drug, he decides to join the rebels.

Ultraviolet (2006)
Milla Jovovich is harboring an infectious virus that turns the rebels into pseudo-vampires that the
government kills on sight to protect uninfected people.

=================

Neither of these movies have really great acting. What they do have is lots of fun special effects
and action. If you like either of these two futuristic over-the-top action flicks, you will
probably like the other. These movies are not great art, but they are fun. I prefer Ultraviolet for

This film has a different take on vampires. Sometime in the future, vampires became a result of infectious disease. As a result drastic measures were taken to rid the world of this plague. I am not a fan of vampire movies, but I liked the unique storyline that vampires were a result of infectious disease. With so many recent unusual diseases on the planet recently, vampires as a result of infectious disease made the possibility of vampires a much more plausible storyline.
One of the things that I loved about this movie is that it was very futuristic and visually stunning. The only other film that is on a similar level visually is Avatar. The sets and colors in this film were amazing. The costumes designed for the star Mila Jovovich  were also part of what made this film so visually stunning.

Those who are looking for some deep philosophical message in this film will be disappointed.  However, if you are seeking a simple story which supports the various action scenes, you may like this film.  There are many mixed reviews of this film but as a fan of the Resident Evil series and Milla Jovovich I wish she had made more of this series (Ultraviolet).  The action scenes are simply fantastic.

This film takes place in the future where there is a war between a dictatorial oppressive government (Sounds like some form of collectivist government system) and a group of diseased humans who they are trying to control and dominate.  For me it is refreshing to see a story about government being the enemy rather than some phony and silly large corporation.

In conclusion, if you like fast action films with great visuals this DVD is worth owning.

2564945,3,B000FGGE7C,"I picked this one up in the $5 bin at Best Buy.  I suppose it was a little better than some of the other movies in the bin, but it was not the ""diamond in the rough"" I was hoping for.

I wanted to like this movie, I really did.  I really enjoyed watching the ""making of"" features more than the actual movie.  A major thing I noticed right away, NO BLOOD.  I mean, there are scenes where it shows a cut on 'Violet's' hand, or something like that, but in all of the crazy fight scenes where people are getting shot up, stabbed, and slashed with knives and swords, there is absolutely no blood spray at all.  In my opinion, it's too bad because the fight scenes were pretty good yet the lack of any combat related bloodshed really took away from the realism of the ""fantasy world"" that a movie tries to create.  Also, since the movie is basically about contaminated blood (more or less) I think, just my opinion again, that combat related blood spray could have really enhanced the story line.

Some of the special effects (mostly CG related) could have been done better.  For example, the motorcycle chase scene backgrounds (the CG rendered ones) weren't very polished.  At the time this movie was made, the technology was definitely available to make higher quality CG.

Despite the fact that the ""Prologue"", for lack of a better word, said that the world was different from the world we know, it would have been nice if they took a few minutes to explain some of the extra-ordinary things, like how Violet can store weapons on her person seemingly virtually, or why the hell her hair, glasses, and outfit change colors every 3 minutes.  I mean, these are neat concepts that could have been explored more functionally, but mostly they were there for aesthetics as she only changed colors for camouflage purposes, like, one time.  The gravity manipulation stuff was a great idea, but it too was abandoned shortly after it was introduced.  So much more could have been done with these great ideas.

The fight scenes were great (except the no-blood thing).  The story had promise.  Most of the characters lacked any real depth (really more the fault of the writers than the actors).  It would have been nice if they would have made the movie about 30 minutes longer so they could explain some things, and give us, the viewing audience, a chance to bond with some of the characters so we might actually care what happens to them.  As it stands, I started losing interest pretty quickly and hung in there hoping things would get better.

We are getting the Blu-ray in a few days...just because we own a Blu-ray player and want to see how it looks.

This is a fine-tuned story. It certainly makes sense to us. It's on-going, fast-paced, exciting, colorful and filmed in a location we would love to see first-hand.

Mr. Wong said it all in his short, but to-the-point, review. He titled his review as Blah. Probably because he couldn't stand the bad reviews. If so, we can't blame him. What could there be not to like?

For 77 viewers to rate this movie as a 1 Star is the most outlandish thing we have ever seen. It's like rating a MarketPlace Seller with a 1 Star because you hated the story in the book.

This movie seems hell-bent on destroying any suspension of disbelief.  Whenever there's an impressive shot (and there are many), it's ruined by stiff cartoon backgrounds and characters who look cel-shaded.  I wouldn't dignify Ultraviolet by comparing it to a game, because that's an insult to games.

The nicest scenes are between Violet and the boy she's trying to protect.  You know, defrosting ice queen and her surrogate kid.  THE OLDEST TROPE KNOWN TO MAN.  The commentary track is informative.  It's just Milla and her puppies in the soundbooth, going ""This was the funnest scene to do."", and ""so kewl.""

You can't even praise the set design, because it's all shot in Shanghai office towers.  There aren't any fight sequences, because Violet kills everybody instantaneously.  Well, there is that final battle, which lasts about a minute.  In pitch blackness.  Thanks for nothing, Kurt Wimmer.

The bad guy, Vice Cardinal Daxus, is kind of amusing.  Why ""Vice"" Cardinal? Did they think it sounded cool? ...Except later, they call him Arch Minister?  What is this I don't even...

This is just a modeling gig for Milla Jovovich.  Say what you will about the Resident Evil movies, at least Alice had a degree of, you know, pathos.  Violet talks in catchphrases 100% of the time.  I still don't know why her clothes keep changing color.  ..Well, like I said, it's a commercial. This is not a movie.  This is an anti-movie.",1284508800,,1551,4.903474903474904
2564960,2,B000FGGE7C,"Did I miss the 10-second explanation buried inside this piece of braindead silliness somewhere about how ""Flatspace technology"" works?  See, that's how heroine Violet (Milla Jovovich, all bare-midriffed and tight-assed and leather-clad) can just suddenly have access to any number of guns or swords that she needs at any instant to kill the dozens or hundreds of similarly-armed bad guys that keep getting thrown at her in nearly every scene in this 87-minutes-too-long film.  Perhaps I also missed the explanation as to how Violet went from seemingly ordinary mother-to-be to unstoppable killing machine in a decade also?  How she fooled the extremely detailed scans of her actual DNA in the beginning of the film that should have kept her from entering a top-secret lab and taking the secret weapon in the humans' war against the hemophages - viral vampires of which she is the most perfect example.

Yep, I must have missed all of the backstory, character development, and all sense of what the narrative is supposed to add up to here; or maybe it's all in the extra 6 minutes or whatever in the ""Unrated Director's Cut"" which (fortunately or not) isn't the version I watched.  Somehow I doubt it.  Somehow I think the entire reason this film exists is to show Milla dressed in a variety of skintight outfits killing literally hundreds and hundreds of bad guys in one heavily CGI-d, lightning-edited, MATRIX-like sequence after another.  Narrative sense, backstory, characterizations - all disposable to director/writer Kurt Wimmer, the man behind the astonishingly highly-rated EQUILIBRIUM, which at least does have a guy who can act when necessary, and a sort of plot to fall back on when the action flags a bit.  That film I thought was a prime example of the poverty of imagination in most American genre filmmaking - and the poverty of expectations in audiences that will lap up the same 50-year-old ideas in film after film as long as there are enough bullets and flying kicks.  Strangely enough ULTRAVIOLET hasn't maintained any kind of reputation, though for my money it's only slightly more inane.

Oh, that's not to say that there isn't some slight pretense of a story here if you look hard for it; but most of it is lifted from John Cassavetes' 10 million times better GLORIA (1980) - a badass woman ends up taking care of a little boy who is the key to the bad guys' goals.  In that case, the son of the victims in a mob hit; in this case, a kid who is apparently the ""weapon"" that will be used against the hemophages (man, even the wordS Wimmer constructs are stupid).  But all that really does is lend a tiny, tiny bit of drama to the proceedings - Violet is so unstoppable that only having a kid to take care of could ever slow her down.  And that's really the problem in a nutshell, narrative-wise - where's the drama when you KNOW that the heroine simply cannot fail?

But it's not completely awful (hence the second star).  The film was shot on digital video and it shows, but not always in a bad way.  I rather liked the brightness of the colors and the softness of some scenes, it was at times hard to tell just how much was CGI in a given sequence and the oddness of the Shanghai and Hong Kong architecture, where the film was shot, adds to the visual quality.  And Milla DOES look spectacularly hot.  But overall this is no deeper or more interesting as a story than most videogames, and the aesthetic isn't much different.  If I liked it just a bit more than the similarly braindead MR. AND MRS. SMITH that I watched last week, I guess it's because my expectations were even lower, and the SF milieu is more inherently appealing to me; but really it's on about the same level of inanity.  I guess if that's your bag, and you like the MATRIX films, EQUILIBRIUM, and Michael Bay's style of nonstop action with only the barest of plots, you might like it more than I did.",1284336000,,3894,4.640465793304221
2564961,2,B000FGGE7C,"My favorite movie, hands down, is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Equilibrium/dp/B00005JLWN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Equilibrium</a>.  The spiritual successor to The Matrix, Equilibrium had the perfect mix of cinematography, pathos, and action that has rarely been equaled. And the first thing I thought when watching Ultraviolet was...""Wow, this is a terrible imitation of Equilibrium.""

Equilibrium used its special effects sparingly, cutting away when appropriate, zooming in when necessary, and always remaining focused on relationships despite the nihilistic setting. To my surprise, Kurt Wimmer, director of Equilibrium, also directed Ultraviolet.  Something clearly went horribly awry.

The parallels between the two films are striking.  The fabled Gun Kata - a martial art using pistols - is clearly in evidence in Ultraviolet. The same dystopian future plagues humanity, only instead of emotion the authorities suppress hemophages (a cute term for vampires). And just like in Equilibrium, the main character's relationship with children is at the crux of her redemption. And yet Equilibrium is superior to this film in every way.

Buried somewhere in Ultraviolet is a parable about fear, misplaced trust, and abuse of authority - all the same themes explored in Equilibrium. The special effects are generally above par, the combat scenes impeccable, and Mila Jovovich (as Violet) is as deadly sleek as ever. But when the CGI clearly doesn't hold up, the camera never looks away.  When combat scenes should be beautiful they become blurry jump-cuts of confusion.  When Violet gets mad, instead of a cold killing machine she comes off as a mumbling thug. Aeon Flux she ain't.

Ultraviolet has high ambitions for its comic book ""Japanimation"" aesthetic, but it fails by simply being all violence all the time. Equilibrium had a similar premise but it pulsed with love, sorrow, and rage.  Conversely, Ultraviolet has the emotion dial set to angry and keeps it there. It's not that the movie is terrible - it simply has no soul.",1282348800,,2077,5.64951768488746
2564962,1,B000FGGE7C,"NOTE: This review contains a few spoilers

I don't know where to begin, since there are so many things wrong in this movie. I'll start by saying what I DID like. There were some decent moments of music, and there were some nice-looking gadgets here and there. And.....that's it. The rest of Ultraviolet is pure trash from beginning to end. Here's why:

-The CGI effects in this movie is appallingly bad. During about 90% percent of the time I was watching this movie, I was annoyed at how unrealistic the chase sequences, the buildings (both inside and outside), and the flying bullets looked. You can really tell when and where they used green screens and.

-Every single character in this movie is never interesting and never intriguing. The kid character is a bore. The hemophage rebels are weak and completely forgettable. The main villain, a cardboard cutout at best, does not look dangerous in any way (one reason being a terrible casting choice). And finally, the hero named Violet is dull and unconvincing. Even when she feels conflicted, there is no real sense of dilemma that's conveyed onscreen. It seems more like a stupid excuse for plot progression.

-Nearly everybody in the film does a horrid job at acting, especially Milla Jovovich as Violet & Sebastien Andrieu as Nerva. The sole exception is William Fichtner as Garth, who looks like he at least put some effort in his performance.

-The dialogue is amazing, but in a very bad way. ""You are all gonna die."" I'm sorry, what?

-Why are the colors in this movie so bright and disjointed? I think I'm having Batman & Robin flashbacks!

-The fight sequences are some of the worst that I have ever seen. It's completely tedious, because the main character (Violet) doesn't get hit even once by a bullet nor a sword. She doesn't even get hurt when she crashes into a high-rise building with her motorcycle. There is no real sense of jeopardy, which really ruins any opportunity to create any suspense. In the end, once you've seen how she deals with literally dozens of soldiers, you'll know exactly how the end fight between the hero and the villain turns out.

-There are several plot twists in this film, and NONE of them are shocking. Why? Because by this time, there is absolutely nothing in the story that fascinates me in any way.

-One of the most overused and most notorious plot points is used in this movie. I just hate it when characters are brought back from the dead: it's getting old and useless.

In conclusion, this movie stinks. I couldn't really enjoy watching this mess. There are so many flaws in this movie that I lost count halfway through. It doesn't even pass as a guilty pleasure; that's how bad this movie is. Hard to believe that this cost about $30 Million to make. It should have been spent somewhere else.

The story tended to borderline between nonsensical and stupid.

The plot holes are plenty in this film, like why does the big baddie need the boy when he mentioned to have clones of the child or how Violet was rescued that one incident in the park when she's surrounded by enemies?  It was such a rush job, even the visual effects were tacky, especially the glossy backgrounds and that one shot when the entire city is made of blocks (not to mention the wall-riding scene that's straight out of ""Night Watch"").

I had somehow gotten it into my head that Ultraviolet was a stupid American remake of a brilliant British TV miniseries of the same name. After all, they both deal with a war between vampires and humans. The reality of the situation, however, is that had the filmmakers here tried to do a stupid American remake of a brilliant British TV miniseries, the end result, no matter how bad, would have been far better than this plotless mess. As far as I can tell, the script for this was cribbed together by someone who'd watched at least a thousand action movies and thought ""wouldn't it be cool to take all the best scenes from all these and put them together in one flick?"".  To be fair, they did a pretty good job of that. There are a lot of well-done action scenes to be found here. The problem is that the ""story"" holding them together is tissue-thin, with characters for whom ""cardboard"" would be a higher-rent district. And for some reason it bugs the hell out of me that Wimmer, along with all the other movies he's stolen scenes from here, also cannibalized his own work (more than one scene was lifted straight from Equilibrium).

*Spoilers*

Oh, I really wanted to like Ultraviolet. I wasn't expecting a whole lot, just some decent action and a nifty dystopia, something along the lines of Aeon Flux, Equilibrium, and (of course) The Matrix.

Ultraviolet starts off with a bang. Milla is a superb action heroine, as always, and she dazzles with a wonderful combination of high-tech gadgetry (she's got an anti-gravity device!), high-speed chases, and high-skill martial arts. Combo in an intriguing (if a bit long and draggy) voice-over involving vampires, and Milla's mysteriously changing hair color, and this should be a perfect mindless Friday night flick.

Unfortunately, the action slows to a crawl after the first twenty minutes (as do the cool hair color changes - it will remain disappointingly black for the rest of the movie, despite all the cool changes you saw in the previews), and you won't get to see too many more fancy moves until the final race to the finish. The filler dialogue is teeth-grindingly bad, with Milla having approximately eighteen earnest heart-to-hearts with the Capture/Rescue Kid. Some of these heart-to-hearts occur back to back and while enemy soldiers are closing in, and the resulting overexposure of Milla's tender side (which the savvy user grasped in the initial opening voice over, for crying out loud) feels like a hammer to the temples. She's a vampire! She's dying! She's saddened by the loss of her pregnancy! She's bonding with the child! Yeah, we got it.

Really, this would have been a much better film if the writers had trusted the audience to get it and just cut 90% of the filler dialogue and just left us 'silent scenes' instead of Milla dragging her reluctant charge around this world gone mad. Although I love mindless action films, I simply can't bear to sit through Ultraviolet again, so I'm selling my copy and hoping the next Milla film will have better writing that she deserves.

2564984,2,B000FGGE7C,"Now, I had not heard particularly favorable things about Ultraviolet, but I didn't care; I can appreciate B (and lower) movies just fine. I'm also a huge fan of Milla Jovovich, and writer/director Kurt Wimmer's previous film, Equilibrium.

My main problem with the movie is the story. Now maybe it was Sony's editing that is the cause of the problems, or maybe it just didn't translate well to the screen, but it is *all* over the place. I don't have an issue with gaps in logic and/or common sense in a story, if the wording is chosen right and things are glossed over. But here, no attempt is even made to cover the incredible leaps of logical thinking required to take the story seriously. Which is what the story is played as, as opposed to tongue-in-cheek or something. I won't go into detail here, but if you're like me, you'll be banging your head against the wall. That could help put you into a daze to better appreciate the movie's real draw, which is the action.

The action and fight scenes are very well done. There's a moment here or there which could have been easily improved with the proper editing (the flaming sword fight at the end comes to mind), but overall, they're good. This was the much anticipated (in some circles) second appearance of Gun Kata, which first made itself known in Equilibrium. Though you can see the same ideas and principles behind some of the movements at times, its appearance here is unfortunately lacking. The filmmakers would rather wave a hand and say ""It's super-science,"" or ""It's magic,"" by way of an explanation here. Quite unlike Equilibrium. Be that as it may, the action is still good.

Honestly, if Milla Jovovich wasn't in this movie, I doubt I'd be interested in it after viewing it once. But with Milla, I'll hold unto it, putting it next to my other comic movies.

I'd give this movie a 2, maybe 2 1/2 stars, and suggest it only to fans of Milla or Kurt Wimmer, and even then, waiting until you find it for under a dollar, used.",1238803200,,1990,4.550279329608938

2564987,1,B000FGGE7C,"I wanted SO much to like Ultraviolet,but it is plagued by poor editing and subplots that are either unfinished or that
simply go nowhere. It is all look but no substance. The movie starts with Ultra telling us""I was born into a world,you may not understand"".Truer words were never spoken.
The story concerns a research organization that alters a virus that has been around for centuries. The intention is to create stronger and faster soldiers;instead they create a contagion. We are told by a voice over by Ultra that she contracted the disease when her husband was killed(blood splattered on her),which in turn killed her unborn infant. As a result she fled underground and formed a resistance. A few scenes later we get our first plot contradiction,as she enters the research facility under the guise of being a courier to pick up a package. She gets the suitcase containing the ""weapon"" but her cover is blown when the real courier shows up. As she fights her way out security identifies her as one who has been confined to the facility in the past for EXPERIMENTATION and whose pregnancy was PURPOSEFULLY terminated(!?).She was human at one time but is now a hemophage like the rest of the resistance.
The movie continues as she heads back to resistance headquarters and at one point stops to look inside the white case she carries. She discovers the ""weapon"" is a young boy. Her priorities,for some reason we're not privy to,change and she suddenly becomes a protective mother;totally opposite to the character we've so far seen. She spirits the boy away from the resistance leaders and turns to a fellow hemophage by the name of Garth for help. For some reason which again we are not privy to,Ultra needs a blood transfusion and Garth,who has pointy teeth,says it's lucky she didn't ""convert"" with her light exposure(?).After testing the boy he tells Ultra he doesn't have ""vampiral anti-genetic blood""(??);in fact he is useless to them. So Garth is a ...vampire too?While there the boy writes some chemical symbols on a magazine and Garth files it away for future reference(as we shall see).At this point there seems to be some kind of feelings between Garth and Ultra but that sub plot is not furthered in any way. The boy apparently is dying and when Daxus,the head of the research facility,contacts Ultra to get the boy back she finally relents when Daxus reveals he is the father. She takes him to a mall to leave him there but she again cannot bring herself to go through with it but the boy runs away and is caught by her own resistance. She fights and succeeds in freeing him from their grasp. Daxus finally talks Ultra into bringing the boy directly to the research facility and she shows up;but unbeknownst to Daxus,as a hologram. Daxus reveals that the boy really contains an anti-human vuris. The hemophages are no longer a threat to him so he's created a new menace people will line up at his doors to get the antidote for. It doesn't take long for Daxus to realize Ultra is not real but by this time she is long gone with the boy. They end up in a playground where the boy in a short time finally dies. With a teary Ultra kneeling over him,she is killed by Daxus who has followed her via a tracking device in the boy. Next thing we see is Ultra waking up having been revived by Garth. We also now see for the first time that Ultra has vampire teeth!? Garth is also NOW suddenly convinced that the
writing the boy did on that mag cover he stashed away,is a cure for the hemophages!? Ultra is not moved as she thinks the boy is still alive. Of course the showdown has to happen between Daxus and Ultra and a battle royale it is. During it we learn that Daxus has hemophage blood also so the fight goes neck in neck until Ultra finally triumphs. She and the boy are united. The boy WAS alive because the hemophage cells in her tears helped to transform him also into a hemophage.
I have left alot out but I think you get the general idea. As the movie progresses the plot incongruities make things go from bad to worse as one can easily lose track of what is happening. Characters are doing things from motivations only known to them.
The resistance movement lives in a spiral tipped building. They own the first half while a chinese gang,Ultra battles,owns the top portion. And after the battle,how she gets from the rooftop to a street level area with the boy in hand is not explained. Things like this are thrown out at you continually.
Even the special effects have their lax moments. During a chase scene on a motorcycle Ultra is travelling first alongside an office building then straight up until she reaches the roof. While she is in midair her image gets shaky which effectively ruins the power of the moment and of the special effect itself.
I know nothing of the history or creation of this film but I am certain there was alot of footage that got cut out here and what an obvious hatchet job was done too. It is like a puzzle that not only got reassembled improperly but with pieces missing! Either studio pressure,budget constraints or both got this thing whittled down,but at the price of the integrity of the picture. What a disappointment to such a promising property.
For those interested the picture and sound quality are excellent here. The special features contained therein consist of the trailer,a 30 m ""UV Protection-The Making of UltraViolet"" short and optional commentary to the movie by star Milla Jovovich.
Give this one a definite pass.",1236643200,,5482,4.6467559217301755
2564988,1,B000FGGE7C,"Every now and then the critics get one right. Ultraviolet is not a movie, but merely an excuse for a lot of CGI effects. What plot there is is so convoluted when you unpack it you won't care because it's contrived and unoriginal. The acting is terrible. Then again, the only thing worse is the dialog the actors are forced to say. All fight scenes in movies are choreographed but the good ones are seamless so you can't tell. The fight scenes in Ultraviolet are a ballet with every move telegraphed so you never believe any of it for a second. I'm sure a lot of money was wasted making this film as was the money I spent to watch it.

2564989,5,B000FGGE7C,"I thought it interesting how the reviews of this movie are almost evenly split.  Loved it, hated it, . . . ehhh it was okay. Interesting to me how 2 butt kicking comic book characters were brought to life in film around the same time.  Aeon Flux and Ultra Violet.  I think that you have to be a fan of comic book reading and science fiction to really appreciate this film for what it is and it doesn't hurt to enjoy girl butt kicking movies, . . .all of which I do.  So of course ask me and I have to say that I found this movie very enjoyable.  Enjoyable enough to add it to my collection.  Mila is very convincing as the comic book character Violet.  She flips, kicks, and twists, . . punches and kills, . . a whole load of people.  The story line was a little all over the place.  I think that it was compromised a little to save time for all the fighting scenes but the fighting scenes, . .boy did I REALLY enjoy the fighting scenes. I thought that they were really well choreographed. I only wish that they showed more on the special features about the fighting scenes.  This movie is apropriately visually stunning and really takes you into the future.  The costumes are AMAZING.  Everything about this movie from costume, to the cars, weapons, architechture, . . exude an almost attainable realisim that we may just very well see in the near future.  Story line wise I would have to say that I liked Aeon Flux better, but visually this movie really rocks and is well worth a look into.

2564990,5,B000FGGE7C,I watched the movie many times and find it very engaging.  The action scenes are as expected (futuristic) and the theme is understandible and makes sense.  The touching part is the bond Ultraviolet develops with the child named 6.  The music is very complementary to the action.  The whole movie flows beautifully.,1233273600,,314,4.980769230769231
2564991,2,B000FGGE7C,"The Bottom Line:

Slightly redeemed only by the fact that the director's tongue is in his cheek for most of the movie (I hope), Ultraviolet is a thoroughly unimpressive sci-fi action movie with an uninteresting performance by Jovovich in the lead and no real story to speak of: look elsewhere.",1230940800,,293,4.86
2564992,5,B000FGGE7C,"I see that this movie is being compared with Aeon Flux - wrongly in my opinion, because ""Ultraviolet"" shows what can be done when you allow a real actress to do her work without interference, unlike the failed Aeon Flux where the producers seem to have subverted their entire movie to their anti technology message.  Ultraviolet is a movie with a real plot, set in a realistic projected future and with real characterizations, a movie with real music, real acting, a simple plot yet with many convolutions.

Visually the CGI of Ultraviolet somehow makes it more ""real"" than the staged and overly fussed unrealistic Aeon Flux stagings.  Mila Jovavich brings a focused, intense performance in which both rage and emotional sensitivity lurk just beneath the surface of her enhanced but time limited precarious existence.

The movie will need to be seen several times but the underlying theme of resistance against future political repression, in the form of a symbolized fantasy, and objectified and concretized from that abstraction by the forcefullness and precision of Jovavich's fine acting, all add up to a movie which has become an unexpected gem on a beach strewn with rubble like Flux.  Jovavich is the troubled heroine, transcending her own limitations to attain her goals, with or without the help of anyone, a heroine of the future in a world which, like that of today, is maintained by forces which seek to dehumanize us all as human ""resources"" and genetic types.

Movie looks cool but story is total crap. Movie Tanks.

2565000,1,B000FGGE7C,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I love Milla Jovovich, but this movie stank so bad, I can still smell it a year after after the fact.

First of all, the plot was mind-numbingly boring and the dialog was just plain crappy. Just because the movie is supposed to be based on a Japanese comic, doesn't mean the story has too be so cartoonish and one-dimensional.

Secondly, to say that there was an over use of CGI would be an understatement. I think every scene was comprised with some element of CGI. It made the movie seem cartoonish, and totally unrealistic. Does anyone remember TRON? In many scenes it looked liked they just didn't even bother to super-impose realistic looking exteriors or interiors (Furniture, Architecture, etc), over the ""virtual"" environment they had created.

Another fault of this movie was that they underused or misused a great character actor like William Fitchner (Invasion, Prison Break, Contact, Perfect Storm, etc.).

Last but not least, the most serious offense is the untapped potential of Milla's sexiness. I don't know if it was the unflattering costumes they put her in or what. They should have dressed her in something skin tight or revealing to really show off of that great body of hers. In fact, there is one scene in which she is propelled through a corridor in the process of changing her clothes. The director purposely shied away from showing any skin whatsover.

2565003,4,B000FGGE7C,"I honestly don't understand why so many of these reviews complain about this movie's plot. The plot was fantastic! However, it should be noted that it's one of those movies where about half of the plot is backstory, and is only revealed one part at a time as those parts become relevant to the here-and-now. I'll admit that it seems to have quite a lot in common with the somewhat superior V for Vendetta, but with the addition of the whole pathogen-induced-monster thing that has become quite the fashion these days (28 days later, Doom, Resident Evil, etc.), though at least this time it's vampires instead of zombies :)

But yeah, this is a movie that will continuously tickle your brain as small details from earlier in the movie end up having critical importance later. The bad guy turns out to be more than we are initially led to believe. Enough is revealed about Violet to get the audience to sympathize with her (at least as much as Aliens and Terminator got their audiences to sympathize with Ellen Ripley and Sarah Connor). The movie makes VERY good use of fictional technologies, especially dimensional compression or flat space or whatever it's called.

Speaking of which, FLAMING SWORDFIGHT IN THE DARK!!! Easily one of the most imaginative scenes in sci-fi history.

It is worth noting, however, that according to some sources, the ""rough cut"" of this film (which was screened in Feb '05) was a full half-hour longer, and most of that extra time was focused on fuller developments of the plot and/or Violet's character.

Even faking playing with swords and guns is dangerous work.

2565021,3,B000FGGE7C,"Being a big Milla Jovovich fan, I was seriously expecting something great from Kurt Wimmer's film ""Ultraviolet,"" especially since the two minute teaser trailer showed it had serious promise and potential to knock ""V For Vendetta"" out of the water (maybe). I was willing to watch the movie just for her. As I sat there, there were things to complain about before the movie even started. It being Friday, I had to sit in front of several giggling teenage boys laughing at everything (even when the movie started), and a lousy sound system surrounding me. I felt like I was WATCHING TV at home, only on a big screen! The best thing I saw was probably the ""Silent Hill"" trailer. Of course when the movie started it showed off with a little comic book montage via Spider-Man style (even the music was reminiscent of Danny Elfman), featuring the many designs of Ultraviolet in the eyes of many artists and then the film opens off with a VERY QUICK narrative of the world now -via Violet disembodied voice- and a ""Metriod Prime"" action scene. The narration continues and the movie shoves aside one too many things that would've made this movie more likable.

UV continues to movie at a pace that makes you think, ""Oh, this is gonna be good,"" especially with the entrance of Milla's character going through several check points to retrieve a TOP-PRIORITY package she was not to open (reminds me of the first ""Transporter""). From there the original currier of the package arrives and all hell breaks loose for Violet. She quickly proceeds into battle with soldiers that break like glass. Falling prey to curiosity, Violet opens the case and finds a . . . a kid in probably some of the worse CGI I've seen this side of the early 90s. The CGI throughout the film sometimes would show grace, but other times it looked very jerky, unrealistic, and cartoonish. One example being when Jovovich on the motorcycle driving sideways or vertically up the buildings or vehicles. This in theory is somewhat of a wild, yet interesting idea, but on film it doesn't look persuading enough to get a small clap of the hand. However, the constant change wardrobe, hair and their color was a nice touch. Milla running on the walls with the use of the gavity piece in her belt was cool too. The storyline from there is lost in the action scenes that at times made me smile, but fell short of a full playing deck. Jovovich along with the other actors in this film, felt as though they really didn't put their all into UV, no that I could blame them. The dialogue was horrible. I swear a thirteen-year-old could've done better than this, treated its audience like they had brains and minds to comprehend his story. But alas, Wimmer strews a horrible mixture of stories that never come together to make this film interesting in the least.

For instance, Violet loosing her baby, her marriage, her former life and even the better explanation of hemophagia and what it done to people with the disease would've merited as something good if the writer had taken it seriously enough to delve into. I laughed when Milla whooped the men in the graveyard scene in their hair (shameful), the lobby scene was remicenist of the first Matrix only there was no shoot out you could see. Then the relationship between herself and Garth is unexplained not to mention pointless. Another laughable scene is after the disappointing seven hundred plus men, Six and Violet are at the playground laughing like everything is peachy. I felt as though I were watching a promo for the MTV movie awards, it was that bad. I think they tired far too much to make us feel or force Violet's loss which was never properly shown and her would be maternal connection with ""Six."" Cameron Bright was a poor choice of child actor to use for this ""Six"" character anyway. The editing of the film is even worse, the fight scenes were visible but they always fell short of impressive; You never got see Violet chopping up the soldiers you just heard it. The movie itself moved too quickly and was far to short. But in this case it was probably a blessing in disguise; I seriously wanted to get up and walk away from this movie but remained steadfast in my shaken resolve and continued watching.

Ultraviolet is completely bloodless and if there was blood shown, it was only the hands and even then it wasn't satisfying. The swordplay seriously had be reconsidering what I said about ""King Arthur"" entirely. Compared to this movie, King Arthur is a four star gem in my book, at least they were trying! Jovovich looked as though every time she slashed at a man she was hitting him with the dull side of the prop sword. No blood whatsoever! And the villain Daxus was just unconvincing, far too underplayed in a parody sense to take him seriously, the clean freak. To my dismay, Ultraviolet was simply set up for action scenes, the best of them all shown in the trailer were at the beginning of the movie. It unveiled itself just like a comic book would, only while this could be forgiven in a comic book MOST of the time, this is a LIVE-ACTION film based on an unknown comic, not a moving pictures film that they sell on AMAZON.COM (I.E, Ultimate Avengers vol. 1 DVD). Unforgivable! All in all ""Ultraviolet"" is a sorely disappointing science fiction movie that key elements to make a great story but fell prey to its own sword and fell on it.

The other type of fan just likes to see her, regardless of the movie because she is one of the sexiest actresses to hit the wide screen in a long time. That kind of fan zeros in on her fabulous physique and doesn't notice the kinds of gaffes that plague this movie.

That first kind of fan will consider this movie to be a dud. The second kind will not be disappointed with this movie, which features Milla Jovovich repeatedly in gymnastic performances in fom-fitting outfits. The fight choreography is above average, and the movie has some other worthy technical merits. The plot could have been more believable and the characters should have been better developed.

2565030,1,B000FGGE7C,"""Ultraviolet"" is set in some near-future dystopia in which mankind is split between normal humans and ""hemophages"" - superhuman but short lived freaks created when an ancient virus was rediscovered and accidentally released.  With vampire-like teeth, HP's are easy to spot, and since they don't wear any gear to protect themselves from a virus they've already got, they're hard to miss even without being the most overstyled characters on screen.  Hunted down by ""Arch-Minister Daxus"", the HP's strike back - it's the ""Blood War"".  Violet is one of best HP's warriors, capable of mowing down Daxus's troops, breaking into his most secure facilities and possessing the flattest abs on Earth.  Violet has stolen a new weapon capable of exterminating the HP's, but she finds that the weapon is a young boy named Six (Cameron Bright).  It's not clear how he's a danger to the HP's, but the script wisely accepts that ambiguity, and soon everybody wants Six dead.  Obeying a deep maternal instinct, Violet turns against everybody else to protect Six.

THIS COULD HAVE BEEN A DECENT MOVIE IF: Reading my own synopsis, it's easy to see how UV could have rocked, which makes it at least as easy to list the sins (multitudinous here) that killed it.  In fact, ""Ultraviolet"" wastes little time before proving itself one of the single most preposterous movies ever made, a botch on every level - sci-fi actioner or even cautionary fable.

Wimmer was supposedly deposed by the studio which released a chopped-down version, but what's left in the mix - like an HP - looks too inherently wrong to have been cured by simply extra footage.  The amateurish script kicks off with embarrassingly expository dialog  (""As you know our campaign against the hemophages has been highly effective"") and garish set-design.  It's downhill from there.

UV is supposedly set in the 21st century.  I can accept widely varying visions of how this century will look by the time it's half-over, consistency requires that one society remain within a single vision.  In UV, however, we still have cars, helicopters and firearms even though mankind has created devices that manipulate gravity and otherwise bend relative dimensions in space (Violet can store scads of weaponry in some sort of personal hyperspace - allowing her to single-handedly stage her own rip-off of the famous ""lobby scene"" from the first ""Matrix"" movie without being weighed down by some big duffle bag or having to wear anything that might obscure her superhuman abs; the humans possess this technology as well, with ""Six"" being carried around in an attach case looking like a slightly outsized Macbook).  Any civilization advanced enough to re-write the laws of gravity and relative dimensions would have gotten past submachine pistols, rotary-wing aircraft or Buicks.  The world of ""Ultraviolet"" isn't so much advanced as ""futuristic"" - it looks very mod without actually being a plausible vision of an era set beyond our own.  Even the HP's amount to less of a plot element than a plothole.  The HP virus is extremely infectious - a point made well at the beginning of the flick when one of Daxus's men realizes that an unfortunate HP splattered him with its blood.  Unfortunately, this otherwise good scene is almost as fatally infected as the henchman, since it occurs inside the humans' blood bank.  Perhaps the HPs - who broke in without an exit strategy - intended a suicide mission to infect the blood.  The problem is that if the virus is that infectious, HP's wouldn't need to get to the humans' blood supply, they could just infect whole neighborhoods.  Humans wear all sorts of facial covers, but expose skin which proves sufficiently vulnerable to the HP virus.

UV fails as an actioner because it's astoundingly arbitrary.  Daxus's hordes fire hundreds of bullets at Violet without scoring a hit - even when she's directly in their line of fire - while they fall in human waves under Violet's guns.  In a similar scene, Daxus faces off three armed HPs by himself, and dispatches them with a miracle machine pistol that can fire a fatal shot to each of three men in a single three-short burst, even when they fire first.  (This is most obvious in sword fighting scenes where hordes of enemy swordsmen are clearly swinging AWAY from Violet.)  Because the script can scare up few characters to pit against Violet, it's forced to throw at her large numbers of faceless hordes at her from the beginning.  Costumes aside, all fight scenes pit Violet against large numbers of apparently well trained and armed troops who simply cannot kill her.  In the ultimate of the flick's idiot-scenes, Violet is encircled by hostile rival HPs who are too stylishly duked out to realize that in encircling Violet with their guns drawn, they're targeting each other.  The script offers no explanation for its unbalanced lethality, instead drawing it to our attention when Violet warns Six that their enemies ""will kill you without even thinking"".  Putting aside the obvious joke that UV could do with fewer thoughtless killers, despite the firepower expended at that point and the stakes involved, ""Ultraviolet"" was surprisingly short on death, as if the film was so eager to kill without a thought that that the script had simply forgotten to kill anybody.  Daxus flops as a villain because he doesn't do much in a flick that defines its heroes and villains more in terms of style than good or evil deeds.  True, the plot has Daxus's ministry paralleling the actions of the WWII genocide, but that happens in the flick's brief expository prolog.  The bulk of the movie only shows the ministry getting its desserts for that prolog, and not doing much to deserve that reception.  In other words, despite his sneers and army of minions (and despite none-too-subtle clues that identify Daxus with the religious-right), Daxus begins the movie as a victim, not the villain.

In short, ""Ultraviolet"" is a flick that's horrible and never stops reminding you of that fact.",1191888000,,5998,4.956043956043956

2565034,5,B000FGGE7C,"I actually really liked this movie, I had been wary about watching as it as it was panned by so many people but I thought it was great, amazing special effects, fabulous fight sequences, and a reasonably good plot that yet perhaps could do with a bit of tightening up but all in all it was worth watching.

Take a future city, filled with humans and Vampires, only they aren't called Vampires, they are known as hemophages, and they are faster, and stronger than your average human but they are also hated and feared by humans and have all but been hunted into extinction.  Add to this concoction a beautiful hemophage called Violet , Milla Jovovich in her scantily dressed best whose fighting skills are legendary, a megalomaniac leader with a deadly secret, a human child known as Six whose very body is a weapon and who brings out the maternal instinct in Violet and a gentle but scientifically gifted hemophage played by the delectable William Fichtner who loves Violet and will do anything to save her.

The movie is non stop action from beginning to end, and is quite amusing in parts too, like when one of the Vampires warn Violet that they are as fast and as strong as she is, but she points out that she is far more pissed off than they are, not only that but her maternal ire is up and she will do anything she can to save Six a child who is slowly dying from whatever has been added to his blood but with whom she shares a bond of loss, pain, sorrow and possible redemption.

Despite the critics and reviewers panning this movie I give it a quality five out of five based on a high enjoyment factor of the fight scenes, the scenery, the drop dead gorgeous costumes that Violet gets to wear, the state of the art special effects and the quirky dialogue.

2565037,2,B000FGGE7C,"Technology in video games is consistently making an effort to look more realistic to game players.  Ultraviolet is a motion picture that seemingly makes an effort to look more like a video game.  I'm sort of indifferent to that direction I suppose, but it's a point I still think is important to make.  Ultraviolet is visually unique and the pace of the film doesn't quit.  You can tell that director Kurt Wimmer (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Equilibrium/dp/B00005JLWN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Equilibrium</a>) doesn't really want us to believe any of this is real as he is striving to create a dystopian world that would exist otherwise only within a comic book or Japanese animation. Ultraviolet does indeed require a vast imagination, but for some of us that's not such a bad thing.

Ultraviolet is a chase movie about Violet (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Milla-Jovovich/dp/B0016WNSXW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Milla Jovovich</a>) who, among many others in her time (in the late 21st century), is infected with a virus that gives her super human powers.  Violet is part of an underground terrorist group that exists to fight against the resident dictatorship.  Soon enough, Violet steals a child (Cameron Bright) from the government and finds out he may be the cure to this disease that allows her to be invincible and be really good at driving a motorcycle.  The terrorist group she is in with decides the child must die and so Violet begins running from everyone with the child.  With some more twists and turns Ultraviolet leads up to a formulaic showdown and more dramatic and unrealistic fight scenes than you could possible imagine.

Ultraviolet is an excessive mess.  The fight scenes are perplexing and miserable to watch, not to mention completely unrealistic, which is something I can almost forgive.  Ultraviolet is the ultimate example of over-stylized filmmaking.  In the action genre, the viewer should probably never be aware that a fight scene is choreographed while viewing it, but if a fine line exists between dancing and fighting then Ultraviolet is balancing very carefully upon it and it is doing so right next to Joel Schumacher's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Batman-Robin/dp/0790732912/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Batman & Robin</a>.  The story also seemed jumbled and confusing.  I really wasn't sure what was happening until the very end and even then I had some questions that I wasn't even motivated to have answered.  The dialogue was delivered stoically and isn't very good to begin with.  The music was as distracting as the visuals.  Other than that it was a visually original film and I guess that is where it earns a star for me.  Well, that and Milla's bare bottom.",1185753600,,2833,5.592505854800937

2565039,1,B000FGGE7C,"I really wanted to like Ultraviolet. From the writer and director of Equilibrium, Kurt Wimmer creates an alternative future where an ancient virus from Eastern Europe turns ordinary humans into vampires. An Orwellian government, bent of destroying the vampires, creates a weapon that will destroy them all. Milla Jovovich plays the comic-book inspired heroine who was infected with the virus and held for the humans to conduct expirements on her through various tests. The testing nearly kills her, which kills the child in her womb. She is sent by the vampire faction to capture the weapon and destroy it. So this film pretty much failed at everything. The entire story was told in the opening naration, and the rest of it was a series of vivid battles with a variety of uniform enemies with no faces, and no cause for existence. There isn't any story development, and some elements come from nowhere and go nowhere. There are peripheral enemies that are not introduced or explained, and Milla just decimates them, and there is nary mention of them after; there is a love story that lasts all of two lines; there is not a lot more. The acting is terrible, of course they weren't given much dialog to work with either. It seems as if Wimmer took a bunch of different ideas (each of which are interesting) and threw them together into a vomitorium. Even the graphics were sub-par. Some scenes looked amazing, and would make a good Blu-ray Disc reference piece, but the rest of it looked two generations old. The city was a tiled texture, the vehicles were smooth and polygonal, and the fire, smoke and glass (especially in the last scene) didn't even look rendered. I didn't watch this one with expecting much considering its short life in theaters and the really bad review from critics, but I was still disappointed. If you want to watch something on your new high-def TV, this might make for a good view for friends, but otherwise you probably want to avoid it.",1181606400,,1963,4.7595307917888565

My only pet peeves are that some of the fight scenes seemed a bit unrealistic, with no explanation of how she suceeded, and the other thing is that soft focus is used on the faces sometimes.  It's annoying when the rest of the frame is sharp. but you can't see detail in the faces, especially annoying with such a beautiful woman in the picture.

The plot and script is not quite as good as Equilibrium, but I had fun watching it and it is enjoyable nonetheless.",1181347200,,679,4.408
2565041,2,B000FGGE7C,"If there is genius here, it must reside in the ultraviolet spectrum, for this fool's eyes can't see it.  Perhaps writer/director Kurt Wimmer (Equilibrium, Sphere) thought it was sufficient to wrap ideas from past successes around the scaffolding of this movie's comic-book foundation.  However, this structure will not last eons, and probably will crumble from the minds of most audience members the minute ""End"" is registered by their photoreceptors.

In the recent past, a bioweapons lab, seeking to modify the DNA of a known virus for military application, instead accidentally makes the pathogen infinitely more virulent than it was before.  Far from causing a few sniffles, this new bug escapes the facility via rapid transmission and replication, and speeds along Homo sapiens evolution by a couple of hundred millennia of so, facilitating the emergence of the Hemophages.  The government seeks to contain the ""plague,"" and collects those who are contagious, sending them to concentration-camp-like isolation zones.  When it is discovered that these collected persons are never heard from again, the Hemophages organize for their very survival.  Although they have superhuman powers of lightning speed and great strength, the Hemophages seem incapable in making inroads against their oppressors:  they require a secret weapon of their own.

Seemingly doomed to the role of fighting-vixen for all time, Milla Jovovich again dons the Lycra-impregnated jumpsuit to fiercely impart justice to any random redshirt who tumbles her way.  Violet (Milla) is the ultimate infiltrator of the Hemophages.  This group of pseudo-vampires has banded together to elude the hygiene-obsessed Daxus (Nick Chinlund).  In principle, this seems simple--unfortunately, Daxus acts as despot over an army of gasmask-wearing, Uzi-toting thugs who seems singularly incapable of doing any actual fighting.  The film opens with Violet piercing the security systems of Daxus' main laboratory.  She successfully poses as a courier, enduring bone, retinal, DNA, blood, and voice-scans before being allowed full access to the package she has been ""hired"" to deliver.  The real security-courier arrives seconds after the package has been delivered into Violet's gloved hand, triggering klaxons, low-level minion attacks, and an escape sequence which, quite literally, defies gravity.

Following countless action sequences--during which the viewer neither believes not cares that Violet's life is in any real danger--it is revealed that the ""weapon"" is really a young boy who acts as host for a virus capable of eradicating all Hemophages.  Trapped in an extra-dimensional space inside the package, Six (Cameron Bright) soon whisks away Violet's common sense with one or two pouty expressions, requiring her to also find refuges from her previous kin.

There are an abundance of new and borrowed science-fiction ideas secreted away in this mess of a movie--a pity because a better story may have implemented them more interestingly, and more cohesively.  The extra-dimensional storage space is capable of holding near-infinite quantities of weapons, ammunition, boys, etc.  The sanitation-themed society bears similarity to the real world of yesterday, in regards to the maniacal devotion to facial-handkerchief implementation seen in individuals who succumbed to fear of the SARS virus.  Super-powerful ninja-vampires suggest a ""Blade""-like influence.

However, no amount of special ideas could have saved this movie from being, at best, fluff.  The dialogue is atrocious, with endless pseudo-philosophical ruminations which remind us of the more easily-forgotten ""deep"" conversations we all thought we had in college.  The plot is intricate in a maddeningly unimportant way, as I simply didn't care to puzzle the whole thing out.  The action is absolutely unbelievable, horribly edited, and 100% bloodless--a bit of gore could have at least appeased the viewer's inner voyeur.  Inside, we get sterile, uninteresting, and repetitive ""gun-blade"" fighting (guns are used as projectile and melee weapons).  This movie is like ""Equilibrium"" under the influence of a fistful of diazepam, with a couple ounces of any given hallucinogen thrown in for good measure.

Chinlund is an excellent actor who steals every scene he's in--as the noseplug-wearing Daxus, he is suitably over-the-top and quite entertaining.  Jovovich is eye-candy for those favoring females of Kievan Rus extraction, and little more.  Bright is believable as a doomed boy-weapon thrown into a titanic struggle where he is only a pawn.  He is also less creepy than he was in previous roles, but only by a hair.

""Ultraviolet"" is recommended for those bed-bound, who are also fortunate enough to be accompanied by several good mates and a smattering of potent beverages.  To summarize, this is a perfect drinking-game movie.  Drink once for every ten vanquished enemies, twice for every five shots of Milla's exposed midriff, and thrice for every smile that cracks the face of Daxus.",1181347200,,5017,5.540682414698162

For the inconsequential price of admission, Ultraviolet launches us on a voyage through a visually and aurally exciting future fantasy world created very possibly to showcase the essence of an extremely lovely and vivacious young woman, Milla Natasha Jovovich. In this incarnation as Violet, a hemophage in the late 21st century, and placed upon a path of discovery and rebirth, she passes before our eyes and ears with the spectacular splendor of the full color spectrum. We are sometimes lulled and more often enlivened by the sensuous and sultry sound of her voice, mesmerized and transfixed by the resolute regard of her eyes, her mouth, and her face, and alerted and attracted to her youthful grace, lithe figure, and confident posture. All else, the amazing martial arts, the exceptional motorcycle stunts, the thoroughly surprising architectural elements of Shanghai, China, and the ever more alluring sequence of lush costumes and lavish sets, is backdrop, though beautifully choreographed, vibrantly hued, and fascinatingly textured. Whoa! It is reassuring to know such a creature as Milla inhabits our planet.",1173484800,,1285,5.398009950248756

Oh yeah, you also get to see the beautiful Milla fight hordes of enemies using many different fighting styles, and in many different outfits.

In the future, a blood disease creats a world of normals and hemophobes. I'm good with that part, and Mila Jovinovitch rocks as the comic book hero `Ultraviolet'. What doesn't rock is her ability to create weapons out of thin air. There is no explaination how, and the dumbass drones after her don't have the same ability. Personally, I wonder how a lowly rebel could have more at her disposal than a government funded ARMY of top notch killers!

The whole film is shot in CG touches a la Sky Captain and The World Of Tommorrow. This supposed to be about her being a rebel and rescuing a human child with a protein in his blood that can cure the world's `vampire' problem. In reality, it is simply an outlandish style of cinematography.

Normally, I would have given this a 1 star. Poor piece of film. Period. BUT, after the Resident Evil series, I felt MJ did a very nice job here. Thus the 2 stars.

You can tell the actors worked hard on their training, especially in terms of martial arts. The last battle scene is my favorite part of the film. The background music gives an ""old world"" feel in a futuristic world. All these fancy weapons eventually leads to swords.

2565060,1,B000FGGE7C,"The 2006 film ""Ultraviolet"", which was written and directed by Kurt Wimmer, portrays the story of a female vampire named Violet (Milla Jovovich, who may be best remembered for her portrayal of the character Leeloo in the 1997 sci-fi film ""The Fifth Element""), who, with other vampires (or as they are called in the film, hemophages), fight government & corporate agents who are determined to destroy them.  The surreal futuristic world of ""Ultraviolet"" is one in which many people have been infected by a disease that transforms them into hemophages.  Those that are not infected wear large amounts of protective rubber clothing and gas masks (especially soldiers, whose faces are never seen) to avoid being infected.  The point of this film?  Daxus (Nick Chinlund), a seemingly uninfected human in charge, creates clones of himself with which he hopes to destroy the hemophages.  One of the clones, a boy named Six (Cameron Bright), is captured by violet; but instead of destroying him as the other hemophages want her to do, Violet befriends & protects the boy.  Hence, most of this comic-book-like film involves unrealistic martial-arts fighting, lots of weapons, motorcycles, protective gear, an evil corporate boss, an innocent boy and a woman (Violet) who can't decide what hair color she wants as it periodically changes.

If you were looking for good acting, an interesting story, well-written dialog, engaging characters and an entertaining sci-fi film, chances are rather high that you won't find any of that in the film ""Ultraviolet"".  So (not surprisingly), the only rating that I can give to this uninspired & uninteresting film is 1 out of 5 stars.

Highly contageous, the disease spread quickly and people became phobic about any germs.  They became a version of Nazi Germany with ""sick"" people being the enemy, especially those with this new ""Vampirical"" virus.

The special effects were and are intended to be, at times, nothing more than a ""see what cool things we can do now"" show, but at times they seriously enhance the Fantasy SciFi effect of the show.

2565067,3,B000FGGE7C,"For its feat of nearly managing to balance out its hindrances with its strengths, ""Ultraviolet"" is a passable display of action that is worth a watch if nothing else is on-hand.

Milla Jovovich is back in her assigned element as an individual part of an outcasted, afflicted ""race"", fighting her own war in a future full of shiny buildings, katanas, and incredibly capable motorcycles.

The storyline, though it's often held back to make way for action sequences, alludes to (if not outright retelling) the persecution of Jews during WWII, in a version where an illness sees the afflictees mislabeled as ""vampires"", precluding as nationwide genocide. Summed up in the final moments of the film, a message of anti-discrimination is made clear...lest we fear the wrath of Violet's sword.

The action sequences, though obviously bootleggers of nifty ""Matrix"" moves, are nonetheless polished and hard-hitting, mixing swordplay with gunplay as violet battles superhuman storm troopers, before fleeing to lengthy chase-sequences on a building-scaling motorcycle.

While the contained enviroments in which most of the action takes place are fairly without my complaint, the graphics quickly lose power when Violet is tooling through the city on her chopper, as nearly every part of the environment is clearly part of the CGI - a ultra-bright jungle of glass and metal.

Once the action goes back indoors, however, it's almost flaming swords and shredding cyborgs in stylish fashion.

2565070,4,B000FGGE7C,"As an overdose of eye candy, Ultraviolet can be marginally recommended as the second-half of a double-feature with Aeon Flux. Both films are disposable adolescent fantasies featuring a butt-kicking babe (in this case, the svelte and sexy Milla Jovovich) in a dystopian future, and both specialize in the kind of barely-coherent, video-game storytelling that's constantly overwhelmed by an over-abundance of low-budget CGI. Director Kurt Wimmer fared much better with his earlier film Equilibrium, but he's trying for a lively comic-book vibe here (beginning with Hulk-like opening credits) with a digitally enhanced, Tron-like color palette. It largely suits this late-21st century story of a ""blood war"" between the ultra-violent Violet (Jovovich), member of a vampire-like group of resistance fighters infected with a man-made virus called the Hemophage, and the human Vice Cardinal Daxus (Nick Chinlund), who's determined to eliminate Violet's kind once and for all. Wimmer takes all of this way too seriously, crafting a plot involving Violet's rescue of a human clone boy (Cameron Bright) that's intended as an homage to John Cassevetes' 1980 drama Gloria, but Wimmer's good intentions are mostly lost in a repetitive series of chaotically choreographed fight scenes, mostly involving the tight-bodied Jovovich wiping out dozens of armor-clad enemies. It's all too numbingly hectic to qualify as a satisfying movie, but sci-fi buffs should give it a look anyway, if only to see how locations in Shanghai and Hong Kong contribute to the film's futuristic design.--Jeff Shannon",1167177600,,1580,5.560165975103734
2565071,2,B000FGGE7C,"Ultraviolet in many ways is like one of those dead-on-arrival films: you know the film's not going to get any box-office so it's best to make a low-budget movie and release and get enough business in those first couple weeks before people realize it sucks and abandons the movie. However, unlike most films that were terrible out of the gate, this movie ultimately does have at least a couple of neat ideas and some cool visuals but it's barely held together by a tiny thread, bad performances, dialogue, CG and a weak story.

It's the future and mankind has been partially wiped out by a new virus, turning people into Hemophages. Vampire-teethed with moves out of the Matrix but with a short life-span, they've been looking for the cure for a long time. Their existence is threatened though when a new weapon is revealed and Violet, a kick-butt kind of girl with a weird need to change the color of her hair and clothes frequently, intercepts it. Turns out the weapon is actually a boy with special blood that Violet has to protect while trying to kill those who stand in their way. If it sounds cliche and cheesy to read, it's because it was cheesy and cliche to say.

A lot of these movies are obviously geared towards the action junkie type with fast fight choreography which gets hampered by MTV-affected editing like the camera can't sit still for more than 2 seconds. It's a shame though since there's at least some cool ideas here. There's a gravity...thing that doesn't get rid of gravity so much as alter it, allowing Violet to fall through ceilings or walk along them and in one logic-stretching scene, ride a motorcycle across a building before switching gears and riding up it. It's a really cool visual idea(if a bit taken from Episode II and probably some other movie I never saw) where Violet has a sword fight in darkness with the only light coming from their swords that are on fire. Unfortunately the film is just marred by practically everything(except for William Fichtner, seen in films like Armageddon, Perfect Storm or Contact). I can't tell whether this is a double-dip film in the future or they knew the film wasn't going to be a hit so they just put minimal extras. We have a commentary by star Milla Jovovich rather than the director and we have a rather fluffy making-of you've seen everywhere.

Should you buy this? I'm going to have to say no. I mean there's enough interesting visuals or scenes to at least warrant a watch but most of the time the movie will just sit there on the shelf and one day you'll go ""oh yeah, I forgot I bought this thing...wonder if I can sell it somewhere?""",1166313600,,2619,4.5918803418803416
2565072,2,B000FGGE7C,"Well this ones a missed opportunity, a film that in some ways tries too hard and yet seems to lack faith in itself. The director has clearly tried for a visual style reminiscent of the graphic comics, but he hasn't taken it far enough and instead of a Sin City type look, it comes over as garish with CGI that looks cheap rather than having the desired stylised effect. It also has one of the worst most intrusive scores I can remember.

It starts at full blast with Violet infiltrating a government lab and stealing a package, when discovered the shooting starts and goes on and on and on ad-infinitum. The seemingly invulnerable Violet leaves a trail of devastation that would leave The Bride or Schwarzenegger in his prime green with envy. The chase scene also introduces some of the most idiotic high tech concepts ever committed to film, including internal body weapons stores and a device that supposedly changes the direction of gravity, allowing Violet to drive her motor bike up walls or stand on the ceiling, sounds dumb ? Believe me it is.

Back at base Violet discovers that the package she has recovered isn't a weapon as such, it's a child. When faced with her erstwhile associates determination to destroy the BoyBomb, she gets all maternal and decides to save him. As a result she ends up at odds with her friends and having to kill a load of others including the Blood Chinois, a group whose only function appears to be one scene as cannon fodder.

After all this the film almost seems to run out of breath and in the few moments it pauses the film almost starts to work, we get some glimpses into who the boy Six is, why Violet does what she does and what's going on. But then cast and crew get their second wind and the mad dash for the finish line is on.

There is a slight twist to the end, but it's not something you'll care about and the bit with Violet and Six starting their happy ever after life style ending, despite both having been killed in the movie is twee and after all the slaughter that lead to it just plain silly, I suspect the input of some asinine focus group.

Badly paced with a poor script and a director who seems to be trying to build on what he created in Equilibrium, but with remarkably little success. I really wanted to like this movie, despite the drubbing some other reviewers have given it, but I'm afraid I don't.

A government official is charged with eliminating her kind from the face of the Earth, and he is most successful.

There are extraordinary scenes in this movie, including the gravity-defying motorcycle chase, the internally stored weapons, and the use of exploding glass-like ""shields"" instead of blood to signify the destruction of a human guard/soldier.

I watched the ""Unrated, Extended Cut,"" and there was nothing I could see (not having seen the original) that would make me think that the rating was spooky (using the formula, ""unrated"" = more body parts or uncovered bodies).

Like in the film it is often compared to (Aeon Flux), the story line took a while to understand.  Understanding that science fiction allows for violations of physical laws, what I really didn't understand was why these Hemophages had technologies so far beyond the humans, and the humans didn't even seem to be interested in obtaining these technologies (for example, the gravity defying feats).

All in all, Ultraviolet was much more entertaining than I had expected from the poor reviews I had read in the newspaper.  You gotta love the genre...",1161993600,,1310,5.239234449760765
2565083,3,B000FGGE7C,"The Jeff Shannon review is spot on. The entertainment value here is in the visuals. They are very stylish, borrowing from TRON. The idea of having a tightly clad martial-arts babe as the heroin is cribbed from The Matrix. Milla even does an ""arm-breaker"" on a security guard in the very first fight sequence as did Trinity in The Matrix, so I guess we can call this an ""homage"". Ultraviolet has a rockin music soundtrack that is just so The Matrix that they might as well call it Matrix Re-Recorded. I loved it. It's actually a bit more electronic/techno than The Matrix. Great!

Some reviewers have complained about the stylized martial-arts sequences where Violet impossibly lays down a dozen foes at a time. But this is nothing more than an ""homage"" (again) to the Bruce Lee films. The choreagraphy is taken straight from those early days in which Bruce Lee was portrayed as a supernatural power. Think of each confrontation where a supremely confident bad-guy (or dozen) thinks he can take Bruce, but after the first exchange of blows the camera reveals the bad-guy's sudden doubt -- that look of ""holy mother of god, I'm in way over my head"" -- followed by the grim determination to fight on towards a possible lucky finish. Which never happened of course. Bruce would start to taunt them, the cat playing with its prey, and then Bruce always took out the garbage at the end of the sequence. Same with Violet. The same sense of humor that allows playing out the inevitable in one fight after another is captured in Ultraviolet.

It looks like Milla did a lot (certainly not all) of her own stunt work in Ultraviolet. Nice job.

By the way, the Hemophages have a couple of new technologies -- ""flat store"" which is a form of ""dimensional compression"". This allows the wonderful visual effect of storing weapons in impossibly small spaces. The humans have it too, obviously, as in the storage of ""the weapon"" at the beginning. And the Hemophages alone have some sort of gravity-modifying tech that enables the wild motercycle-on-the-walls and martial-arts-on-the-ceiling sequences (which are great). Those are not to be attributed to the Hemophage disease which does produce super reflexes and stamina.

I just happened to watch this film back-to-back with Aeon Flux as Jeff Shannon discusses. Though Aeon Flux has the more fully realized back-story, I think Ultraviolet is more fun to watch.

It's Milla after all. I think she needs to do a film with some major talent that she can react off of, instead of being the center. Pair her up with Sean Connery, or Bruce Willis (again), or Denzel Washington, but in a non-sci-fi action situation. A cop-drama or a CIA intrigue... She's a decent actress who could possibly grow more than people think. Her Joan of Arc portrayel had some good dramatic moments, particularly in the scenes with Dustin Hoffman. She's certainly ahead of the current crop of teeny-bopper brat-pack types.

For Milla's best action film so far, get the first Resident Evil installment available at Amazon. See my review here at Amazon.

Late addition to this review: I understand that a new Indian Jones movie is in the works, and that Harrison Ford is in, and probably Sean Connery as well. Add Milla as the girl that an aging Jones relies on in action sequences as well as in the romance department. Perfect!",1160524800,,3333,4.816433566433567

2565085,3,B000FGGE7C,"Nice visual, effects and fighting scenes, but the plot is quite weak.

Still worth watching it, since the heroine is gorgeous, but be warned and don't go in expecting an outstanding movie.",1159747200,,188,4.875
2565086,2,B000FGGE7C,"This is a pretty cool movie and all, but at some point you just have to pause and say, ""Huh?"" To borrow a phrase from the great and wise Ricky Ricardo, this movie has some 'splainin' to do. Heaven knows I love watching a young woman kick butt every which way from Sunday, and there's nothing sexier than the bare midriff look Milla Jovovich has going throughout this film, but -- and maybe I'm old-fashioned -- I sort of expect a movie to explain at least a few of its most unusual facets. For example, our heroine in this film can pull weapons out of thin air, make her hair and clothes change colors on a whim, and has no respect for the concept of gravity. All I know about her is that she was a normal human being who caught an engineered virus that turned her into a hemophage, died and was restored to life for further testing, and then escaped. I can buy into the whole heightened senses thing, but how this allows her to morph and avoid hails of bullets fired directly at her is quite beyond me. While I'm at it, let me also say that the central storyline has more cracks in it than, uh, something full of cracks. The ending is pure deus ex machina squared.

The movie starts off great, though. I really liked the comic book montage style of the opening credits, and the film itself wastes no time in throwing Violet (Milla Jovovich) up against hordes of bad guys trying to kill her. The point of her initial, solo raid is to steal a new weapon the humans have designed, a weapon supposedly capable of wiping out Violet and all of her fellow hemophages. Said weapon turns out to be unlike anything you would expect, and Violet's decision to protect it rather than destroy it sets the stage for the remainder of the film. Her hemophage allies want the weapon either brought to them or destroyed, Vice Cardinal Ferdinand Daxus (Nick Chinlund), the weapon's creator and all-around power-hungry tyrant, wants it back, and Violet has to forge her own path through all this mess.

Obviously, the filmmakers just wanted to show ninety minutes of Milla Jovovich doing what she does best, and the plot they threw together is really just a means to that end. The basic storyline is easy enough to follow, but far too many of its details go unexplained. As for the special effects and fight scenes, there's some really gnarly stuff on display here, but a lot of the CGI work is just overkill. Additionally, the cameramen are like kids with a new toy as they experiment with every angle known to man.

Despite its inherent weaknesses, though, I really enjoyed the first hour or so of this film -- and then the novelty of all the fast and furious action wore off, leaving me to wade through another half hour of a pretty slippery and generally unimpressive story. Even the action goes downhill as the climax approaches, as too many of Violet's fights prove to be laughably easy ' and accompanied by incredibly clich dialogue. The bottom line is this: Ultraviolet will definitely get your blood pumping, but it inevitably puts your brain cells on standby.",1158710400,,3049,4.54
2565087,2,B000FGGE7C,"""Hello. My name is Violet and I was born into a world you may not understand.""  That's the first line of dialog heard from the film Ultraviolet (2006)...after watching the movie last night, I think the following would have been more appropriate...""Hello. My name is Violet and I was born into a movie you may not understand (or even like).""  Written and directed by Kurt Wimmer (Sphere, Equilibrium), the film stars Milla Jovovich (Dazed and Confused, The Fifth Element, Resident Evil).  Also appearing is Cameron Bright (X-Men: The Last Stand), Nick Chinlund (Con Air, The Chronicles of Riddick), Sebastien Andrieu, and William Fichtner (Heat, The Perfect Storm).

As the movie, set in a messed up future (isn't that always the case?), begins we see some giant bowling balls dropped from the air into a building, and once inside the balls turn into deadly assassins...well, that's a pretty neat trick...anyway, some stuff happens, which leads into a lengthy flashback with voiceover by Jovovich.  Apparently, some time ago, a nasty virus was found in Eastern Europe, one which Western powers tried to modify in order to create super soldiers or some such thing, but all they really ended up doing was creating a nastier form of the virus, one which gives it's victims sharper eyesight, acute hearing, enhanced strength, superior healing abilities, and vampire fangs...so what's the downside?  Well I tell you...the victims are generally sensitive to light and have an extremely shortened lifespan.  Seems those affected, known as Hemophages, were then rounded up by the norms and put into camps for experimentation, and those still on the loose formed an underground resistance movement, of which Violet (Jovovich) is a member.  All right, as the flashback/background stuff comes to a close, we find out Vice Cardinal Ferdinand Daxus (Chinlund), the egomaniacal tyrant ruler of the norms has developed a new super weapon, one that supposedly will eliminate the Hemophage threat once and for all, but Violet nicks it through a lengthy and involved series of high-octane action sequences.  As it turns out, the weapon just happens to be an idiot child named Six (Bright), whose blood, while deadly to Hemophages, may also contain a cure.  Violet soon finds herself stuck in the middle as the leader of the Hemophages, some Euro trash named Nerva (Andrieu) wants the kid dead, while the Vice Cardinal wants back what's his...what follows are numerous dead end scenes between Violet and the kid, lots of running around, some fight sequences, some back door dealing, and ultimately a final showdown as Violet battles her way through an army into the belly of the beast (the Arch Ministry building) to face off against the Vice Cardinal himself, who has some serious secrets of his own...

By the end of this film I was somewhat aggravated...why?  A number of reasons, but the main one being it seemed like the story was a patchwork of ideas and concepts, none of them developed particularly well.  I did like all the action sequences up front, but once those passed, we were left with having to sit through a whole lot of rotten acting and goofy dialog, the latter being the weakest element of this film, for me, at least.  One example in particular happens after Violet liberates Six, and is on the run.  After a close encounter with armed authorities, Violet asks Six ""Are you damaged?""  Why not just ask ""Are you hurt?""...I'll tell you why...because it's the future and asking someone if they're `damaged' sounds a lot cooler than asking them if they're hurt, at least in Wimmer's mind, I think.  In my mind it just came off as idiotic...I've read the studio re-cut some of the film prior to its release, and even removed some sequences (I read the original film ran about a half hour longer).  Did this meddling hurt the movie, resulting in a less than desirable end product?  I don't think so, as the flaws seemed ingrained regardless of any tinkering (for a prime example of this go rent the theatrical and renegade DVD releases of the 1991 film Highlander II: The Quickening and tell me which is better).  I liked the exteriors, some of the special effects were pretty spiffy (some seemed ridiculously phony), and the fight sequences, for the most part, were fairly engaging, but the slower moments in the middle really caused the feature to drag out.  I found it rather annoying near the end when Violet, the one woman army, was invading the Arch Ministry building, and we'd see her come up against a whole mess of guards, only to cut to a scene with her coming through a door, and beyond the door we see the guards from the previous scene lying dead.  I did learn a lot from this film, including the following...

1. Milla Jovovich sure likes to show off her midriff (and I like to see it).

2. Body armor in the future is pretty ineffectual given it's tendency to shatter like glass when struck.

3. Germophobia runs wild in the future, to the extent of affecting fashions as people don designer air masks and surgical gowns.

4. In the future you'll be able to carry small to medium sized children around inside fancy, fashionable briefcases that double as backpacks.

5. Uzis fitted with blades that stick out from the bottom seems like overkill (and kinda dumb).

6. Extremely long hair can be detrimental to its owner during hand-to-hand combat.

7. The biohazard symbol seems an awkward and impractical design for a building.

8. In the future most all interiors will be designed to look like bad discothques.

9. Milla Jovovich's character seems the only one who actually knows how to fight.

10. Milla Jovovich's character can literally pull futuristic gizmos and weaponry out of her ash.

11. Sword usage returns to fashion in the future.

12. What's the only thing cooler than a sword fight sequence?  A flaming sword fight sequence!

All in al the film is very slick, stylish, and colorful, laden with a good deal of flashy action sequences (wire work galore) and special effects, but hamstrung by poor performances, terrible dialog, and not a lot of substance.  By the way, I've got the `Unrated, Extended' version, which runs about six minutes longer than the theatrical release, but I seriously doubt anyone who only saw the original release is missing much as I doubt those six minutes included anything critical or even worthwhile to the actual film.  More or less labeling this the `Unrated, Extended' version was just an attempt by the studio to breathe new life in the aftermarket into a film that died in the box office.

The picture, presented in anamorphic widescreen (1.85:1), looks very sharp and the Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround audio comes through fine.  Skimpy extras include an uninteresting commentary track with Milla Jovovich by herself (where the heck is Wimmer?), a featurette titled UV Protection: The Making of Ultraviolet, and English subtitles.  Also thrown in are previews for other Sony DVD release including Final Fantasy: Advent Children (2005), Mirrormask (2005), Marilyn Hotchkiss Ballroom Dancing & Charm School (2005), The Fog (2005), The Benchwarmers (2006), and Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby (2006).

--The haphazard and needless romantic dialogue. (I love romance movies mind you, but... well, you'll see)

--Horrible character development. I don't care about the kid... I don't care about her... I don't care about the romantic link... I want to kill the guy with the French accent... (Hey, that's a step above apathetic at least)

The jerky camera work and impossible stunts are not always very believable or likable.

2565092,2,B000FGGE7C,"Oh were to begin with this film?

Do we start with the hideous CGI that screams ""low budget"" it looks like all the dough in this film was spent on Milla and her costumes.  The buildings and other CGI effects would be ok back when Tron was made but now look like refugees from a Final Cut Pro workshop. Can you say fake? And since this chop-socky film needs good CGI to even make it somewhat believable the grade z computer work cripples this film right out of the box.

And make no mistake this is a pure chop-socky film, but unfortunately we only have Ms Milla to chop and kick, nary a Jet Lei or Jacky Chan or Gordon Lee to be found.  As a matter of fact every other actor here looks like D-list material here at best.

And Talking D-list lets talk about the choreography here. Chop socky films do have a certain flow to the fights at least the good ones do. Unfortunately the fight scenes here are all paint-by-numbers affairs. Not only that, they feel like the same fight scene.  And derivative  fight pieces are slow death for an action film like this one.

What is to like here? Well in better hands the Si Fi premise definitely has legs.  What would a society look like if we became obsessed with disease, an AIDS like disease that was not so limited and much more virulent?  Where would we draw the line on ""experimentation""?  What rights would we give up on to be ""safe?""  Unfortunately this film blows past this to get to the (often ridiculous) fight scenes.

And fans of High fashion won't be disappointed either as Milla is put in some absolutely smashing outfits.  But Milla would look smashing in a burlap sack. Also the few times the film actually slows down are also good.  Milla always put some passion to her roles and sometimes sweetness.  And in the few quiet moments she does shine through.  But then the film races on to fill the needs of the ADD hormone infused male teens that are it's core audience.

2565093,1,B000FGGE7C,"I have to admit having lowered expectations toward Ultraviolet. Initial reviews of the movie upon its release were...well...not good.  But lowered expectations aside, I rented Ultraviolet for two reasons: Milla! and I loved writer/director Kurt Wimmer's Equilibrium.  What we have with Ultraviolet is a video game come to life.  Only it's about as interesting or entertaining as watching someone else playing it.  What little backstory we get (and it ain't much) is ridiculously convoluted.  Something about scientists trying to engineer superior soldiers who instead create an airborne virus with vampire-like symptoms, hundreds are infected, they dissapear into concentration camps, an underground resistance springs up, so on.  The film takes place in the same kind of future world as Equilibrium, only with a bigger budget.  The action, which worked well in Equilibrium, Wimmer has taken way over the top here.  Violet (played by Jovovich) has a device on her belt buckle that enables her to go all wonky on gravity, walking on the ceiling and driving her motorcycle up the side of the buildings and her wristbands - a kind of technology called ""flat technology"" - enables her to carry an arsenal of weaponry up her sleeve, literally.  We get tons of Wimmer's patented ""Gun-kata,"" but it lacks anything close to resembling kinetic energy and is really just boring.  All the action sequences are boring!  And the whole movie is one extended, green screen, CGI action sequence.  What little meat the story has (and there ain't much) has gone rancid.  It's too bad for those of us who loved his first movie and looked forward to see what he'd do next.  This is unfortunetly it.  Ultraviolet isn't just bad.  It's wow bad.

2565094,2,B000FGGE7C,"Milla Jovovich appeared in one of my all-time favorite sci-fi action comedies (The Fifth Element), but she also holds the title of ""Most Overused Female Actress"" in some really shoddy flicks (Resident Evil, Dummy, and Return to the Blue Lagoon just to touch on a few). So I hesitate whenever I see her name attached to a title. Perhaps her agent needs to be a bit more selective when handing her manuscripts.

So it is with a heavy heart that I have to say her unfortunate role selections seem to have no end in sight with the addition of ULTRAVIOLET to her sagging film repertoire.

Vampires (aka Hemophages) have been done to death, but I don't mind that. If a story is interesting and contains vampires, hey, that's fine by me. But shoving Milla into a body-fitting, white leather outfit and having her kick [...] in almost every scene makes me think that much more could've been made out of this film rather than just a vampiric female ruffian who's deadly with a blade. Swinging swords and Matrix-like action sequences were all one gets to see here ...that and some really bad CGI (harkening back to the days of TRON).

The story of vampires and humans battling for supremacy is nothing new to film, too, and it would've been nice to see more character development surrounding Milla's Violet character and that of the main antagonist, Vicecardinum Ferdinand Daxus played by Nick Chinlund. But we just are led to believe that the two hate each other because they're on opposite sides of the human/vampire equation. Or are they? It seems the scriptwriters/filmmakers couldn't make up their minds about that either. What a mess.

The story tries to pull a sympathetic chord with the audience by explaining that Violet lost a child in-utero, so when she starts feeling empathy for Six (Cameron Blight), a young boy who carries a virus that can wipe out all vampires (or can he?), we (the audience) are supposed to support her decision not to kill the very child who could kill her. But the emotional impact is nil, again, since almost all of the film time is dedicated to swordplay, killing, and showing us how nice Milla looks in her leathers while decapitating a few hundred bad guys at a time.

There have been comparisons made between Ultraviolet and AEON FLUX. I've seen and rated both of these films and found the latter much more entertaining than the former. Although both films had deadly women as their prime protagonists, Aeon Flux actually had a story behind it with some intriguing concepts, while Ultraviolet simply put a futuristic bent on a worn-out theme.",1157241600,,2573,4.760089686098655

Then the disease got out into the population and a war began between the infected, who were disappeared, and normals.  Violet was one of the infected.  She died.  She was revived.  She is now an almost unstoppable killing machine.

Violet has been assigned to capture a new weapon that could wipe out all of the infected.  The weapon is not what it seems and Violet finds herself the protector of a young boy.  For the rest of the movie Violet kills huge numbers of people while trying to find out the truth about the boy.

I have not read the comics so I don't know how accurate the movie is.  But without reading the comics I found myself completely lost.  Almost nothing in the movie has any explanation.  As the movie says, this is a world unfamiliar to us.  Unfortunately by the end of the movie we are still unfamiliar with it.

2565099,3,B000FGGE7C,"Get used to it folks, this is the future of action adventure films. Basically a weird mix of ""Polar Express"" and ""Kill Bill 1""; with a plot that seems to have randomly selected script elements from every ""Matrix""-like film produced over the past ten years. When ""Polar Express was first released, many predicted that the substitution of animation for live action would take over the film industry. But they expected this to be driven from the animation side and not from the live action side. But ""Ultraviolet"" shows that this takeover is really being driven by the live action production companies. It is a cartoon with occasional cutaways to actors, interactions between actors and animation, and a voice-over narration.

Interestingly, not only is this not a new thing, it actually goes back to the days of silent films. In the early 1920's Max and Dave Fleischer introduced a cartoon series called ""Out of the Inkwell"" which superimposed animated figures on real film backgrounds (allowing a live actor to interact with a cartoon character). Walt Disney (in his pre-Mickey Mouse days ) borrowed the idea for his series of ""Alice"" cartoons (there were 56 cartoons in the series) and even reversed the idea and superimposed a live actress (Virginia Davis) on an animated background. Obviously these early examples are crude by the standards of ""Ultraviolet's"" digital effects but the concept itself is identical.

""Ultraviolent"" is not much of a story but it is decorated with many stunningly beautiful shots of Milla Jovovich as the title character. The story is weaker than the ""Underworld"" series but on a par with most of vampire-Matrix-post apocalyptic-CGI stuff the industry has been cranking out lately; including Milla's ""Resident Evil"" movies. The negative criticism of ""Ultraviolent"" relative to this other garbage is absurd; its all pretty awful but at least here there is an emphasis on the Milla visuals and her costumes are second only to Beckinsale's. They would be just as good if the costumer had realized that flat black presents major contrast problems.

Milla can act (see ""Dummy"") but not much is required in that department for ""Ultraviolet"".

""Ultraviolet"" is based on a comic book and the film features loads of lame hyper-edited martial arts scenes that don't require stunt work because they are just microsecond cuts edited together to simulate fighting.

""Ultraviolet's"" plot revolves around a young boy that Milla is trying to protect. They are caught between a government run by the medical establishment and a resistance movement of disease-enhanced humans. That might sound like ""Dark Angel"" but instead of a ""Bladerunner"" production design, think of 1980's ""Flash Gordon"".

All in all, ""Ultraviolent"" is as good as most of these futuristic exercises in excess and better than some.

2565105,4,B000FGGE7C,"This is a sad case of I don't know what. The movie as a whole is nothing to rave about. It feels like you're watching your little cousin play a video game. Watch it and you'll see what I mean.

BUT... I can't lie. I REALLY dig the action sequences in this film!!! These scenes are awesome! This chick downloads weapons into her freakin bloodstream or something and her entire arsenal comes out of her wrist.

The fight/action sequences are good enough for me to add this film to my collection. I'll just skip the story attempt everytime and just watch the fight scenes and the shootouts.

Yup, you saw that right. The action sequences in this film are worth the 4 stars to me.",1156118400,,676,4.392
2565106,3,B000FGGE7C,"You know, had this film had a better scriptwriter, who didn't simply repeat bad comic or game lines for the characters but created taut, snappy dialogue and more complex interplay, this could have been a superb film.

The look of it is extremely interesting. The use of Shanghai for the city of the future was marvellous, and I enjoyed the comic-ised  palette and the use of CGI to recreate the graphic novel/game appearance. The martial arts style was fascinating, and Milla Jovovich is certainly stunning.

But character depth, interplay and plot have been discarded as unimportant in this movie. None of the characters has anything interesting to say - it's all very much ""this is a computer game and no one expects Shakespeare""-style dialogue. The motivations of the characters are often inexplicable. The actual danger of this disease of the haemophages is never explained. How the boy (named Six - a clone of a cartoon-style villain) is supposed to be activated to act as a weapon is never explained. The motivation for the villain is frankly ludicrous. And the endless and inevitable and unstoppable killing routine of Violet herself is fun, but let's face it - ridiculous.

One has to suspend disbelief to enjoy the film. I did so willingly - but even so, the plot problems were gaping. I think it's time that directors of this style of movie stopped thinking viewers will not notice the plot problems and lack of depth in the characters. Yes, no doubt it's fun for a director to bring a comic book to life, but really, really, REALLY... directors and scriptwriters have got to get beyond the ""oh, isn't it fun - we're creating dialogue just like a comic book!"" stage. It isn't fun for the audience. There is a difference between comic books and films, and part of the difference is in the expectation of the dialogue and the richness of characters.

By all means, let the look of this style of film continue to utilise the stark and bright colours of the graphic novel/game. But the stereotypical characters are far too obvious when transported from comic book to screen. FAR too obvious. Detailed work needs to be done by a real scriptwriter who doesn't mind creating more realistic characters with deeper functionality than a mere imitation of their comic book counterpart.

The crew obviously enjoyed working on this film, particularly with all the special effects. They clearly did not think in terms of a great plot, but in terms of ""wow, we have a fantastic motorcycle sequence going along the SIDE of buildings!"" or ""wow, we have Violet fighting twenty armoured men!"" or ""wow, doesn't Milla look beautiful in these shots?"" and so on. Mm-hmm. Ho hum, I'm afraid. These sequences are simply UNIMPORTANT to making the film itself great. They don't do it. They cannot and never will take the place of a truly good plot.

So many things didn't make sense. Why was Six thought to be dead if he wasn't? Why did Violet's teardrop make him not dead? Why did she know this? Why did she risk her life for him when, for all she knew, merely touching the boy would result in instant annihilation of all her people? Why did she keep keep spouting appallingly bad lines about how dangerous and deadly a killer she is? (This struck such a jarring note...) Why was she able to fool all the tests when she was pretending to a courier? How did she slaughter all of the guards she confronted, even when overcome by completely overwhelming odds? (In true comic-book style, she was supposed to be invincible, but the scriptwriter and director were clearly trying to make Violet ""real""... They've forgotten ""real"" only works when overwhelming odds aren't included all the time in a completely unrealistic way.)

I do think the casting of Milla Jovovich was right for the role, and she's a good actress. She did the best she could with this role. The fault was in the writing.

In these terms, ""Ultraviolet"" was a disappointment. ""Equilibrium"", also a fantasy film with a super-hero type of character, was amazingly good, and featured not only a powerhouse performance from Christian Bale, but had a story that made sense. It had character dynamics that were superb. It also had an incredibly moving moment - that instant when Bale's character hears the music of Beethoven for the first time while no longer on his emotion-suppressing medication, and tears of astonishment and wonder at the beauty of it trickle from his eyes. Now THAT worked...

I hope the director of this film will tackle that sort of film again, and will choose a scriptwriter who can create emotionally powerful moments like that, as well as create characters that have real depth, not pseudo-depth as I'm afraid the character of Ultraviolet had.

Recommended with caveats, mainly for the look of it, and for those who enjoy the sight of an unstoppable but unrealistic woman defeating anyone who comes against her or stands in her way.

Blu-ray is awesome!  Well worth the extra cash.  Graphics are extremely tight.  Finally caught up with my PC.  The uncompressed sound is well worth mentioning too and it sounded great (my neighbors hate me!).  Nice, loud and extremely responsive.

I've never seen a movie that used color and music so effectively.  You could ""feel"" when things changed and when it was about to hit the fan.

Some of the scenes in the movie were implausible (very comic book like which makes some sense) though they were cool enough on their own that I'm glad they did it that way (most notibly the last 2 scenes in the Needle).  They could have tightened up the graphics on the motor cycle and transfer truck driving scenes.  Kinda like the ""Smith"" fight in Matrix 2.

With digital projectors, loud motorcycles, and the ability to manipulate gravity, scorned and vengeful Violet (Jovovich) is infiltrating the government's facilities to obtain a weapon that would be used to eliminate the Hemophages once and for all.

Sound interesting? It's not. The plot makes a cheap 180 with the introduction of a child named Six (Cameron Bright), allowing battle-hardened Violet to touch into her matronly roots - a brave stab at injecting emotion into a movie that no one expected, or wanted, to be anything more than ninety minutes of explosions and an angry hot chick. Plot threads all race to the screen at the same time, forming a scrum - oh, we gotta get a weapon, now we gotta rescue a kid, uh-oh, I'm dying, he's dying, OH WAIT, there's a cure to the virus, nope never mind, now I gotta go rescue the kid. And death, apparently, is nothing sacred to writer/director Kurt Wimmer, who mows them down and brings them back like an X-Men comic. And why do Violet's hair and clothes constantly change colors? It was never satisfactorily explained.

2565151,2,B000FGGE7C,"Early on in ""Ultraviolet"" there is a section of exposition that goes on and on, and I knew right then and there that this 2006 film written and directed by Kurt Wimmer (""Equilibrium""), was in big trouble. When you get to the point where you feel you need to be taking notes, it is just not a good sign. Not that the situation is all that confusing, to wit: in the future the human race is divided into normal humans and the Hemophages, who have a blood disease that makes them like vampires. Actually, it is more like they are called vampires, but if you are looking for this to matter in some significant way you will be disappointed. Incisors grow a bit longer and Violet Song ja Shariff (Milla Jovovich) comes back from the dead without exactly rising from the grave, and that is about it.

Violet is sent off by her side to destroy a secret weapon which is in a case that she is repeatedly and emphatically told not to open, thereby guaranteeing that she will open it, not destroy it, and put herself in the middle of everything so that everybody will want to see her dead. Vicecardinum Ferdinand Daxus (Nick Chinlund) is the main villain, which means that when he and Violet finally get around to fighting with flaming swords we are just about at the end of the film. In between she basically kills everybody who tries to stop her from whatever she happens to be doing. Most of the action is decidedly uninspiring, but there are a few quick bits that will shake you from you lethargy and give you a brief moment of hope that things are looking up for this film.

In terms of what category ""Ultraviolet"" ends up in, I would say that is definitely more of a comic book movie than a computer game movie. At first I thought it was obviously trying to be the latter, but there are just way too many shots and scenes that are clearly in keeping with the comic book approach to seeing the universe. Besides, the fight sequences with Violet usually tend to be quick and to the point, which is not the point of dispatching people in most computer games. If anything the violence is in keeping with Asian cinema. . The one thing I am sure of is that this film does not come close to taking from the best of any of these schools of influence. It has been a long time since I have been so easily bored by a science fiction film. Before Wimmer indulged in computer animated overkill, he should have come up with a much better plot to justify the time and the expense.",1152835200,,2459,4.355119825708061

It reminds of Underworld meets Resident Evil in a way.  Ultraviolet is ok for one viewing, so I'd recommend this movie to anyone who is into sci-fi and action to check out or if you are a fan of Milla Jovovich.

The graphics of the gravity manipulation device were top notch but brief. The story revovles around a vampire or ""Hemophage"" as they call them in the movie. The world is without all diseases save one; the hemophage virus. It is a virus that for some reason people don't want to catch, even though it gives the ""sick"" person super strength, speed and agility. I'll never understand some of the underlying character relationships and I don't think anyone will unless they read the comic or investigate the pre-movie story. The characters are likable but not well developed. The main character, Ultraviolet, is very likable and very hot played by Milla Jovovich. There is a new cure discovered and Ultraviolet tries to steal it before it can be used. I thought it was a good movie, border-line great even, but the characters aren't developed and the story seemed to take a back seat to the fighting/action sequences. All in all a good sci-fi flick.

Another thing is that the audience never really got to know each character. We never felt sorry when we thought someone was about to die because we just didn't know that character well enough.

Everything was so fake looking, too. I'm not saying that's bad, I just thought I'd mention it. I'm sure it looks much better on the big screen than on the small screen.

Also, I thought that the acting wasn't that great.

This type of thinking only shows just how far someone would stretch something just to make an argument. A ridiculous, unfounded argument that further fuels what so many people think of christianity today. That its nothing but a group of bored, lifeless people who need to pick apart anything and everything to give themselves some sort of voice or meaning, to give themselves something to defend when its clearly only one sided. Those people are what gives christianity a bad name. No, I don't think this film is anti-christian. The thought never even crossed my mind. (No pun intended) I highly doubt the writer/director was trying to offend christians as much as he was trying to bring a bit of the ""vampiric"" look and feel to the movie. Some people need to question their priorities and start fighting against more important things instead of a movie.

As for my review, I found the movie to be enjoyable, not nearly as horrible as I've heard. Yes, the plot is one of those, thin, straight to the point, you can pretty much guess what happens next, kind of plots. Even so, this was a beautifully done film with an original vision and graphics to make up for anyhing it may have been lacking. And Milla Jovovich never looked better.

2565163,3,B000FGGE7C,"I really wanted to like this more than I did, but the creators missed a lot of opportunities to make a memorable and long lasting film. Ultimately, it falls short of that and lands right in the run of the mill pile.

ULTRAVIOLET is NOT a waste of time. It has some phenominal technical moments. Not to mention, some very cool and memorable fight scenes and special effects. Milla Jovovich looks very believable wielding swords and battling hords of attackers. She's also very cool and gives a solid performance. In fact, the entire mood is engaging.

So, where does Ultraviolet fall short? There are many things, but I believe the most important thing is that the movie plays like a VIDEO GAME STORY.

You may say, ""It's supposed to. It's a video game movie."" But, turning a video game into a movie is a chance to give a different dimension to a video game character. Video game stories are usually very one dimensional. Find bad guy after fighting through hords and levels of his henchmen and eventually destroy him. That is exactly what you get... the movie plays like levels... and if you've ever heard the term ""Hack and Slash"". That is what the movie is.

Don't get me wrong. I love the action. I love the battle scenes. But, it just seems to be one after the other. One immense battle scene after the next, and when it's all said and done.... there wasn't much of a story to be told... just like a video game.

Another thing that bugged me was the beginning... the movie has to explain the world... the virus... the new species... the side effects... the war that is raging... and then I noticed... WE'RE ALREADY 10 minutes into the movie!!  Dear lord! Tighten this script up man! Movies should grab you in the first 5 minutes. And then, after the 10 minute explanation... you're thinking, ""Is this the second coming of DUNE? Is the movie gonna be that complicated?"" And as I've already said... it isn't.

This needed more side stories. More emotion. More character building. More essence, more dread and less Milla Jovovich taking on 30 bad guys at a time... 7 or 8 times... or maybe it was more than that. However many it was, it felt like watching SOMEBODY ELSE play a video game after the 2nd time.

Maybe it would have been more fun had you been able to control the action with a controller... but ultimately, ULTRAVIOLET sort of falls flat.

The lack of script leaves the actors with nothing to do when we aren't being dazzled by the vivid colors, futuristic weapons and vehicles. The fight scenes look like a John Woo acid trip.

Jovovich has done much better in the acting department and certainly we have come to expect more from Fichtner, but we can't blame them for the material they were given to work with.

I rented this movie hoping to find great action, special effects, and story line close to the excellence of the Matrix.  Well, I guess 1 out of three is bad, but the main problem I had besides the bad story line and weak action was the anti-Christian rhetoric.  Don't get me wrong. There were some very good special effects scenes in this movie, such as the guns and bullets that seemed to come out of UV's hands. And riding motorcycles along the sides of buildings is indeed wild.  But all of this cannot make up for a weak plot and some lackluster acting.

Besides the fact that we have Christian cross symbols practically all over the place within the ""oppressive"" and ""evil"" empire that UV tears down in her battles, comments are made in the movie which also show the anti-Christian bias of Wimmer.

And of course you can't forget that last scene where we pull towards (and back) from the control center of the ""evil"" empire and it just happens to look like the Christian crucifix!  I may be dense sometimes, but if Mr. Wimmer thinks Christians are so stupid that they can't see through that blatant yet thinly disguised attack, perhaps He needs some mental healing from Jesus.

And we can't forget the last lines from the movie during the big fight scene at the end and afterwards, where the ""evil"" ""Vice Cardinal"" (wow, wonder where that terminology came from) says to UV: ""Do you believe in God, Violet?  Do you hope He's merciful?  Do you think He'll welcome you into His Arms like the so very many you sent His way?""

And of course the anti-Christian ax Mr. Wimmer seems to be grinding in this movie would not be complete without a final stab at Christianity by UV herself: ""...And my body...will Garth be able to fix it the way another had cured my soul?  Maybe. Maybe not. But this I do know. All those still out there who spread oppression, injustice, and hatred...they better hope not.""  And of course we know the old lines from people who feel that Christianity has done nothing but spread oppression, injustice and hatred, ignoring multitudes of historical facts which dismiss such rhetoric.

Hey Mr. Wimmer, here's some advice. Next time try saving some money and time (especially ours) by creating an anti-Christian blog or something where you can overtly vent out your views like a man instead of making underhanded slaps using a movie.  I would have more respect for you if you did that instead of this sham, Matrix imitation that could have been a classic like the Matrix had the writer put away his ax and produced a thoughtful and original product without the anti-Christian agenda.

And of course there will always be those who, not understanding or knowing what Christianity is, will argue that the movie isn't anti-Christian despite the clear evidence of this througout the movie.

No continuity. Ever. she kills off a bunch of guys in a hallway. Another 20 or so bust in through the ceiling, and the other doors,

so she turns around (casually) and shoots through a glass wall, and walks into a mall. The Guys, of course are RUNNING

at her, but once she gets in the no-so-crowded mall, they can not find her.

She is on an open stairwell in that same mall, and a line of guys are coming up the stairs, and a line of guys are coming down the stairs, and 3 lines of guys are coming into the open area below. She stops and makes a phone call, and talks about the kid's sickness, then hangs up, and it cuts to her walking across the roof with the kid.

How the hell did she get out?

Even Neo in the Matrix gets hit once in a while. Not ONE person ever gets a hit on her. No bullet, no punch, no kick, not even a lucky swing with an electric baton.

The film is about Mutants. she is a mutant, and so is the main bad guy. All mutants have different powers, but all can see in the dark, to different degrees. They

set up the fact that the Main bad guy is a super mutant. He can see in Total Darkness, as if it were high Noon. He fights her, and then turns off the lights to

get an advantage. She Lights her metal sword on fire to see in the dark. They fight, and he disarms her. Now at this point the writers must have taken a

break, and forgot who had what power, because now the bad guy can no longer see in the dark. He needs to use the flaming sword to find her. She, of course,

finds a gun (in the total darkness), and sneaks up on this guy who can see in the dark.

I kept telling myself, that it HAD to get better.

Why did this movie crap out?  Too much eye candy and not enough substance.

  All the fight scenes were way too over the top, with confusing camera work and an over choreographed moves.  The Cgi used in this film was good in some areas and bloody cheesy in others.  Good Cgi was some of the city scapes, and some of the weaponry that form out of dimensional ports in Milas uniform. thats about it.  The other Cgi used was reminiscent of the CGI used in Stephen Kings the Lawnmower man....yeah crap!

Its all very tongue in cheek.  while protecting the boy Voilet is constantly chased by the Vice Cardinal, kind of a corporate bad guy. its almost one fight scene after another either with guns or swords, sometimes both.

Finally, whats the deal with the antigravity everything and the color shifting cloths, Is that in the comic book?  If it is, I appologize, but if it was a movie adaptation, it would have been nice to have a little explanation behind the mechanism of some of these devices, and that would have been solved by actually puting in some real dialog.

2565171,3,B000FGGE7C,"When Kurt Wimmer wrote and directed ""Equilibrium,"" he managed to make a wonderful, lower-budget sci-fi flick that had a great story, plenty of action, and solid performances from actors such as the wonderful Christian Bale, Sean Bean, Taye Diggs, and Emily Watson.  When Wimmer cranked out ""Ultraviolet,"" he was given a larger budget, an established action star in Milla Jovovich, and a really creepy kid who is perfect at playing a creepy kid (Cameron Bright).  So what does he do with these seemingly win-win elements?  He goes heavy, VERY heavy, on the action, heavy on the CGI, and tosses the actual acting performances to the wayside.

Jovovich, Bright, and underrated character actor William Fichtner (also of ""Equilibrium""), have absolutely nothing to work with in this story.  The reed-thin plot is based around Violet (Jovovich), a hemophage who's out to capture a weapon that can supposedly eliminate her kind on Earth.  It seems that every disease in the universe has been wiped out except for one that makes its victims look and act like vampires.  After capturing the weapon, however, Violet begins to question the motives of both her allies and her enemies and all of it sort of smashes along at breakneck speed until there is no one left to kill on the screen.

This film wreaks of echoes of ""Equilibrium.""  From the armed soldiers who explode into powdery shards to the clean white uniforms worn by Violet and others in the flick, it seems as if Wimmer took what he felt were the coolest parts of his cult hit and threw it into this film hoping to cash in on it once again.  Even the gun-kata is tossed in!

Visually, this is like a video game gone awry.  There's enough eye candy here to send you into fits.  Bright colors everywhere, chameleon-like outfit changes by Violet, and weapons that appear out of the air.  Wimmer unloaded his bag of visual tricks on this one.

There is plenty of action here.  If that's your bag, you'll be right at home with ""Ultraviolet.""  However, if you enjoy an actual storyline to go along with the explosions and swordplay, I'd suggest you buy ""Equilibrium"" and leave ""Ultraviolet"" as a rental only.

Whereas the fight scenes in Wimmer's other film, Equilibrium, were simply boring, Ultraviolet's are actually painful to watch.

Milla Jovovitch proves once again that she can't act worth a damn. She commits ever acting gaffe imaginable, from emotionlessness to chewing the scenery.

Kurt Wimmer cannot write. At all. He depends on enormous amounts of exposition to deliver the simplest plot points. The pacing is so awful that a full eighteenth of the movie is Violet walking through a corridor and getting poked and prodded by medical instruments. There are plot holes and inconsistencies galore, and  many of them are so awful they smack you in the face. Plot? Characterization? hah! What's that?

Bound and hanging over its mouth is his son, Daigoro (Akihiro Tomikawa).  The boy kicks off a sandal, sending it plummeting into the inky darkness below.  Ogami measures the seconds until he hears the gentle ""plop"" of the sandal meeting the deep water before beginning the obliteration of his foes.  Engaged in combat, the man who held Daigoro's rope allows the boy to fall.  Ogami slices his way through the group to grab the rope in time to save his son.

  A well in 1800s rural Japan makes sense.  A well in a church ""somewhere in the future"" doesn't.  Yet, that's par for the course with ULTRAVIOLET, a quasi-vampire action film from writer/director Kurt Wimmer.  The latest in the ""created in a computer"" movies (think SKY CAPTAIN AND THE WORLD OF TOMORROW or CASSHERN), Wimmer's tale is long on exposition, heavy in style, and thin on substance.

Along with LONE WOLF & CUB, ULTRAVIOLET borrows heavily from THE MATRIX, BLADE, AEON FLUX, and a host of video games and comic books.  Rather than being a clever amalgam, Wimmer's work is a messy hodgepodge that brims with tepid gunfights and excessive chase scenes.",1151971200,,1275,4.767123287671233
2565178,4,B000FGGE7C,"Ultraviolet is a movie that has gotten short shrift, almost certainly due to an overemphasis on the movie's cgi.  The other elements of Ultraviolet are all quite good, and deserve more credit.

First of all, Milla Jovovich gives one of her best performances in this movie.  She looks absolutely great, and her physicality is better than ever.  She is nuanced in showing both sides of her character:  a hardened killing machine, and a caring, loving (surrogate) mother.  Second, Ultraviolet's story is much better than average, engaging and unpredictable.

All that said, Ultraviolet fails in a core element, its pure cgi sequences.  Ultraviolet's world is reasonably interesting, and there are a number of good sets provided in the movie.  Most of the movie looks good to great.  But the director and producers tried something new with the cgi, and here they failed miserably.  This becomes particularly gruesome with pure cgi sequences.  A motorcycle chase sequence early in the movie, for example, just looks terrible (think minor update of Disney's terrible Tron).

2565183,4,B000FGGE7C,"There are many reasons why I liked Ultraviolet but first and foremost I liked it for the intense, graphic and innovative fight sequences that splattered my screen from the second I pressed play. In books I expect the story to stir up the images but in movies it's the visuals that rock my world, and the story follows closely behind.

 This movie surely had my eyes  and my mind captivated from start to finish. The story as far fetched as it was didn't throw me off, as I followed Violet, played by Milla Jovovich who in my mind was born to play quirky high combat characters, and her team of friends and foes as the so called, Blood Wars fed life cycles of modern Earth. She  is on a  mission which  I will not give away, but  that  mission makes her angry,  unstoppable and out for blood as she flew, drove , kicked, shot, sliced though and propelled herself again st laws of gravity towards her goal. The colors, liquid metallics, flying  scraps of matter,  bullets, heart stopping stunts and  her motorbike skills left me with my  mouth open and my brain entertained in a way that  is hard for most movies.  I have never seen the Ultraviolet comics but this movie was swimming in special effects so collaborative that all fantastic movies now have more to struggle against as this set new standards .

I know I  might have more unusual liking for movies than the majority, and as many people didn't seem to like it, I have to  say that this was wonderful and intense  beyond what I expected. The music by Klaus  Badelt was just as magnificent  and will have to go on top of my movie scores list. Great movie,  as long as seen with an open mind and total openness for some fantastic butt kicking as it blends  Kill Bill, The Matrix,  Aliens and  all my favorite super heroes into one.",1151798400,,1788,4.411042944785276
2565184,3,B000FGGE7C,"Milla Jovovich was superb, the poise, the grace, the presence, as always, incomparable.  The grace in the actions scenes was superior to what can be seen in world class ballet.

Oh yes, everything else...  The story was choppy, with elements that deserved greater development being dropped in like a snippet of another script.  This was most obvious with the 'Blood Chinois' gang.  Clearly there were relationships that had no connection to the rest of the story.  The head bad guy, Vice Cardinal Daxus was... well, a cartoon overstatement of a bad politician.  Understandable, given that this movie was derived from a comic book, but it would have taken so little effort to tone him down, making him twice as believible and three times as menacing.  The CGI and computer generated effects were spotty.  The aerial approach to the ministry looked like a last minute, slapped together change, but the motorcycle chase had bits that were pretty good.

OK, the action had some merit.  Milla was the merit, everything else had the texture of the second rate Hong Kong martial arts movies of thirty years ago.  The sword fight with flaming swords was pretty cool and even made sense in context, but other than that, there wasn't much that wasn't done better in ""Matrix"" (you knew the comparison was coming, didn't you?).

A special person note to the graphics guys;  We get it.  You have a thing for the biohazard logo, the radiation trifoil, and crosses.  We get it.  You were inserting symbolism as a dangle for the artsy crowd.  This stuff works much better when it is not bludgeoning the viewer.  For pete's sake, every muzzle blast from Violet's SMG was a biohazard logo, OK already! She's a carrier of a blood-borne pathogen, we get it!  Ummm, and you don't want to overdo the symbolism...

2565185,5,B000FGGE7C,"NOTE:  This review is for the Unrated, Extended Cut version)

I don't understand why there are such poor reviews of this movie.  I thought it was very inventive and unique.  I'm so sick of people bringing up past movies and comparing new movies to them.  How many more million times must people compare movies to The Matrix?!  Can't people remember farther back than that?  I mean come on people, get some perspective on movies.

Ultraviolet is an awesome movie in and of itself.  Great story, great execution.  Some of the CGI isn't up to the standards of a lot of the high budget movies today, but it doesn't take away from the movie at all.  The sets are very inventive and colorful.  Like Equilibrium before it, Ultraviolet gets an A+ for style and execution.  The fight scenes are very pleasing.  The gun kata scenes (see Equilibrium) are great.  I went into this movie expecting much worse.  By the end of the movie I must say I was very pleased with the experience and find many bad reviews unwarranted.  I think Ultraviolet is destined to become a cult classic along the same vein as Equilibrium has.

I think people need to seek more out of a movie on its own merits rather than comparing it to something else (*cough* Matrix *cough).  I think people have become spoiled and are easily disappointed if a movie doesn't up the bar another notch.  Movies are entertainment, not benchmarks.  Ultraviolet is a movie about a comic book character and world.  It immerses you into that world and makes you feel for the characters.  It has great special effects and more style than many movies could ever hope to have.  I believe this movie deserves way more than people are giving it.  So with that I'm giving it 5 stars to help counterbalance the posers.  And yes, I truly believe it deserves 5 stars.

You can agree to disagree, but I challenge you to watch the movie without trying to compare it to something else.  People today are spoiled rotten and it shows with some of these reviews.",1151798400,,1992,4.582386363636363

Kurt Wimmer is a great director and filmed this movie in china which explains why some people won't like the CGI effects(Who cares it's just a movie).Remember this won't be nominated for an Oscar, it's for die hard fans of this genre.

I'd call it low quality at best.  The CGI is blatant and in some scenes a disgrace.  The actual sets they do use are used over and over again, you get a feeling the city is three blocks by three blocks.

While the first fighting scenes were good, the same things just kept happening and happening.  Great, she walked into the middle of a circle of enemies.  Over and over and over.

That isn't even the real detractor, the acting sucked!  The enemy was awful, the kid was annoying, the tech sidekick was just scuzzy and distracting, and Milla couldn't act her way out of a  bag in this one.

I'd consider this more of a Spawn type action movie.  Do not buy.",1151798400,,859,4.327044025157233
2565188,4,B000FGGE7C,"I watched Ultraviolet in the movie theatre, and was totally jarred by gaps in the plot. Certain elements of the movie made no sense; Violet would be in a building, cornered, and then scene would cut to the next, and somehow she was out. Futhermore, the whole plot about the virus seemed absurb; there was so little context about the virus that it was silly that the movie expected the audience to understand what was going on. Something didn't seem right. So I was very curious to see what the extended version of the movie was like, particularly since I had heard that the studio did a lot of cutting for the theatre version.

It's hard to imagine that a few extra minutes in the ""extended cut"" can make much of a difference, but after watching this version of the DVD, the movie was much more enjoyable. Scenes were put into context, action scenes were extended, and a little more background went a long way. This version was superior in many ways than the theatre version.

The sound appears to still be lacking, however, with a lack of speech syncing or medicore background sounds at certain times.

2565189,2,B000FGGE7C,"First of all, let me state that I am not overly critical of movies. I have loved movies that were deemed terrible by critics and viewers. I loved Aeon Flux. So, I thought that I would give this film a try. It seemed like something that would be right up my alley... vampire, sci-fi, ect. I'm sure you get the point. But this film bored me. The characters seemed to me to be very unconvincing. This is especially true of Violet. I think they took the whole maternal thing a little too far. The story seemed to be a bit redundant. When you watch it, it feels like something you've seen before because it follows a pretty standard storyline. I'll admit, it does have some aspects that are used to try to differentiate it from other such films, but it just doesn't work. Even the action seems somewhat... I'm not sure what the word for it is exactly, but it's disappointing. I would have expected better. Some of the action scenes do redeem themselves though. I also didn't like the random bit of technology that kept changing Violet's costume. It seemed completely unnecessary and, honestly, annoyed the hell out of me. Another thing that they didn't do is explain things as fully as they could have. The movie isn't even an hour and a half. It wouldn't have killed them to explain more things in detail. They do cover some bases- the essential ones- but they leave viewers in the dark about many other things. If this film didn't manage to capture and keep my interest, I think more critical viewers would have a much more difficult time finding enjoyment in it.

First off, i think the director tried too hard to make the movie 'futuristic.' Every setting and prop looked straight from the Jetsons. Except for those unexplainable guns from our present time. Or those military trucks from 1995 or so.

And why did Milla have to change color like a chameleon?

Ultraviolet drops all those elements except for the creative actions scenes which never seem to end or really have much of a point.  (If you do like this film, check out Versus which is much the same way.)

Rumor has it that the director/writer lost final control over this film.  This can been seen in the fact that he contributes nothing to the DVD.  In the making of featurettes, Wimmer is refered to glowingly by the actors, producers, and various crew.  But Wimmer himself is only seen and not heard during the behind the scenes features.

The last surviving virus was human made and causes an early death within twelve years. It also causes an abnormal canine tooth growth causing the virus to be called the vampire virus. It's very contagious and puts the rest of the human population on high alert and forced segregation. Violet is part of an underground team that is fighting back.

The movie opens with her on her current mission. Breaking into the dictator's (played by the always exceptionally evil Nick Chinlund) fortress to steal a package. The package contains a child with an antigen and everyone wants to kill him except Violet. With 36 hours left to live she makes it her mission to protect the child.

The action scenes are a work of art to witness but more time should have been spent on the storyline development.

I don't know how many DVD's is considered ""Alot"" but I have quite a few and the 5.1 Surround Sound on this film is very lackluster. If you want a good futuristic movie with real acting and intensity get Kurt Wimmer's first movie ""Equilibrium"". If you have already seen it and are still curious about ""Ultraviolet"" go ahead and see for yourself.

It has a shaky story and the action is a little over the top - ok a lot over the top in some scenes. This makes it hard to believe what is going on...but if you play close enough attention, the unbelievable parts become a little more believable.

This is non stop action - extremely similar to Equilibrium...in fact, in the end, i thought I was watching Equilibrium - they are that similar. I'd say the fight scenes better than Equilibrium, but they are more over the top...so they kind of even out.

There are 2 fight scenes in particular that catch my eye...one in the library and one on the rooftop. The one on the rooftop is more of what you wished you saw in the matrix and the library is identical to Equilibrium in so many ways...but more beautiful :) If you don't like sci fi, I'd say you still need to see these two scenes.

The con and plus is milla jovovich's character. They make her character nigh invincible, one thing I hate seen done to hero characters (seems like female characters are particularily made this way in so many roles where they play the hero). This makes her hard to identify with, but, to her credit, she plays the role well and she is pleasing to watch.

The scenery and imagery is very nice. I liked the entire look of the film. There is alot of information thrown at you if you pay attention...i wish they had spent more time on story and character development...or made a prequel prior to this that would have built into this...it feels like they skipped a whole movie's worth of material.

2565204,3,B000FGGE7C,"The subject of very bad reviews, I was not particularly keen to see this film. Having actually seen the film, I agree that there are too many fight sequences, to the point that you could be in a PS2 game. These sequences are at times too drawn out and some become predictable and tedious....

Also the plot could have been better developed too.

So what is good about the film?

Set in the future, the world is in the midst of a war between humans and people infected with a vampire like virus which gives them superhuman skills.

Milla Jovovich is actually quite good in the ambiguous lead role. She has fled the laboratory that infected her with the Hemomphage virus which resulted in the death of her unborn child. Now embittered and angry with Humanity, she has become a lethal assassin for the Hemophage movement.

However, her stance is turned upside down when she encounters a laboratory bred, nine year old boy. Well played by Cameron Bright, he is a vessel for a virus that could threaten Hemophages or Humanity. Both sides want to get hold of him. In scenes reminiscent of John Cassavates 'Gloria', this boy's plight cuts through Ultraviolet's cynical exterior and awakens her maternal instincts, and she goes on the run with him, trying to protect him from her fellow Hemophages and the security forces of Humanity's dictator.

She and Bright develop a convincing and sympathetic relationship while on the run, and just like Gloria, this enhances and underscores the moments of danger and peril

The sets are superb and give the film real atmosphere at times, I believe that Shanghai was largely used as the location.

See the film for what it is - undemanding but entertaining Sci Fi.",1151366400,,1696,4.744897959183674

2565207,3,B000FGGE7C,"It's hard to write a review about this movie without mentioning Director Kurt Wimmer's previous film Equilibrium, a movie which is vastly superior to this one. Perhaps it's because fans of the movie feel like we owe it to Mr. Wimmer, as he delivered one of the most underappreciated action films of our time, and to bash this movie would be a great traversity against his abilities and potential as a great filmmaker. In its own right, Ultraviolet is not a ""bad"" movie per se, but it's not really a good one either. Wimmer draws not only on his own Equilibrium, but also on vampire movies and basically any generic sci-fi-esque thriller, and combines them all together with Milla Jovovich, who does a decent job at selling her character and looks pretty darned good too. Sadly, this film is missing much of the suspense and, perhaps more noteworthy, the INTELLIGENCE that made Equilibrium such a cult classic. Even so, Ultraviolet still dominates most (if not all) of the ""girl power"" action flicks of late, and is at least worth renting.",1151280000,,1038,4.772222222222222
2565208,3,B000FGGE7C,"After the reviews and lukewarm (at best) box office, I wasn't expecting much from Ultraviolet, but it wasn't bad as a ""popcorn"" action movie.  Somewhat confusing in parts, the movie has an interesting basic idea - a highly contagious virus set loose on the population - those infected become stronger, faster, get night vision (and light sensitivity), get longer ""vampirish"" teeth, but only live 12 years from infection.  The government rounds up those who are infected (called ""hemophages"") into internment centers and experiment on them.  Soon there is a resistance movement and ""Blood Wars"".  That's where we find Violet, a hemophage who is transporting a secret weapon stolen from the humans.

The action is over-the-top violence with excellent (and sometimes bizarrely unnecessary) special effects.  Violet consistently defeats hoardes of opponents, usually armed, with her variety of guns, swords, and fighting skills.

This movie was a fun watch for a rainy Sunday afternoon.  There's no sex and not much, if any swearing, but the violence would make it probably inappropriate for smaller kids. I won't be buying this one, it was worth a rent and if it's on TV I might watch it again.",1151280000,,1191,5.134715025906735
2565209,3,B000FGGE7C,"'Ultraviolet' is the most recent arrival from an evergrowing number of films with plots dealing with beautiful and deadly warrior women in sexy skin tight costumes fighting injustice. Milla Jovovich (Resident Evil) is back once again doing what she does best, terminate evil.

Set far into the future, after most of mankind has been wiped out by a devastating biological holocaust those that remain have been divided into two warring camps, humans and hemophages. The hemophages are comprised of humans who have been infected by a virius that bestows vampire-like physical attributes and physical abilities, but also accelerates the aging process. Ultraviolet is the most deadly hemophage assassin who has been sent on a mission that will change the balance of power forever if successful. That is if she decides to complete the assignment as originally planned.

Yes the storyline does lack substance but there is so much non-stop action in this film there really isn't much room between fight scenes to fit one in. The special effects are definitely not the best I've ever seen, but passable. As for Milla, she says it herself, ""I'm a Titan, a monolith. Nothing can stop me."" She's absolutely right!",1151193600,,1201,5.091370558375634
2565210,2,B000FGGE7C,"OK, two stars. Sorry about that if you like this film, but I cannot tell you a lie. Before you dislike my review, let me tell you that I really loved Kurt Wimmer's first film as directo `Equilibrium' and its gun-kata actions. ""Silly"" some say. Or ""Childish."" Yes, I know, but I also know that it's great fun. And Christian Bale's gun actions are sensational.

But I should be talking about 'Ultraviolet.' Well, `Ultraviolet' starts promisingly. Shot with Sony's high definition camera, the digital touch of the opening sequences perfectly matches the futuristic city and its apocalyptic story about the battle between the two kinds of humans. The first 20 minutes are very good with gadgets and fighting, Sure, many of them look rather ridiculous like gravity-defying motorcycle, but I like the idea precisely because it is ridiculous. And the opening title sequences with the clever use of comic book are brilliant.

Then after the secrets about the `secret weapon' are revealed, the film suddenly loses its power. Occasionally the film shows actions, but they at best are mildly interesting. The reason is simple: weakly written characters and inept editing that killed any momentum of the gun/martial actions. The action choreography needs more stylish touch, or at least some originality.

Now, let me give you advice. If you have not seen `Equilibrium,' go and get it. Then after watching it, compare it with `Ultraviolet.' You get similar dark, futuristic world, gun actions, and super-cool hero/heroine, but which is really cool? Which editing is superior? And most importantly, which action is more exciting to see? I give you a hint: Christian Bale.

Yes, 'Equilibrium' stars Christian Bale who as you know went on to become the Batman. Christopher Nolan's `Batman Begins' proves one thing and that is, to make a good action film, you need an actor who can act, or infuse life into the character s/he plays. `Ultraviolet' has Milla Jovovich who was terrific elsewhere (like Leeloo in `The Fifth Element'), but here she is far from her best. Her character in the Besson film was never boring a single moment while her Violet and her emoting sound completely hollow in `Ultraviolet.'

Kurt Wimmer's `Ultraviolet' is a huge disappointment after watching his much better work `Equilibrium.' Familiar phrase is `Rent before you buy it"" but in this case perhaps you should rent his debut film before this one. Not perfect fiasco, but still letdown.",1151107200,,2451,5.056930693069307

2565212,4,B000FGGE7C,"People have to understand that this movie seems to revolve around the concept of the ""Japanese Anime"" culture. In almost every anime-based show and movie, you see some (if not all) of the following:

1. Over-the-top, clitche bad buys who are in charge.

2. Sword fights and/or fist fights.

3. Tacky costumes worn by the main characters.

4. Verbose comments.

The anime concept is completely different than the hollywood concept because the hollywood concept is built for a dumb audience while the anime concept is built for an intelligent audience who have an understanding of Japanese culture. And because I have this understanding, I was able to enjoy the movie Ultraviolet. Besides, as a man with common sense, I just watch the movie as if it was any other movie and enjoy it. I don't tear a movie up like most Americans (who don't have a life and nothing better to do) do nowadays.

All in all, I love this movie because it seems to have that anime feel to it. If you don't like anime, then tough luck. Put up with it.

This movie reminded me very much of Equilibrium (Christian Bale and Taye Diggs). The dystopian society is an obvious corrilation. More than that though it was almost like they were directed by the same person. The imagery and sets and fighting style were so similar. UltraViolet was much more colour infused but on the whole I was having major dejavu through the movie.

So, if you like Equilibrium you will like this movie. If your expecting earth shattering, mind blowing commentaries on the nature of society and the human condition your expecting too much.

The CGI effects could have been done better, there are scenes with the motorcycle that simply look like an old moto gp game. That's the only part of the movie I hate.

2565220,1,B000FGGE7C,"A distinction:

There are many, many terrible movies.  A great number of those are student films, independent films made by amateurs, low-budget genre pictures, and Rob Schneider movies.  In other words: really, they never stood a chance of being good.

Then, there are medium- to large-budget films, such as ""Battlefield Earth,"" ""Batman and Robin,"" or ""Howard the Duck,"" films about which it can only be said, ""Shouldn't someone have been able to do better than this?""  These are monumentally awful movies made by people who, on a fundamental level, ought to have known better.

""Ultraviolet,"" as far as I'm concerned, is a new low amongst that latter category.  It is so bad that if I ever have a conversation with someone who honestly claims to have enjoyed it, I cannot envision failing to want to choke said person.  I'm civilized, so I won't do it; but I'll think about it.  A lot.

On every single level, this film is a pathetic failure.  Milla Jovovich is awful.  Cameron Bright is one of the worst child actors I've ever seen appear in numerous movies; he was similarly terrible in ""Running Scared,"" ""X-Men: The Last Stand,"" an episode of ""Stargate SG1,"" and the otherwise good ""Thank You For Smoking"" . . . and that was in 2006 alone!  William Fichtner is mediocre, whereas he is usually terrific.  Nick Chinlund, whom I remember fondly from an excellent ""X-Files"" episode (the title of which escapes me), is one of the lamest villains in history.

Lest you think this is sounding ""so bad it's good,"" no, stop, that ain't it.  It's just bad.  People ride motorcycles down the sides of buildings because they've flipped a switch inside their bodies to alter their gravity.  WHAT ABOUT THE BIKE'S GRAVITY?!?  LAME!

The action scenes, like the one I just ranted about, are laughable.  Not exciting, not well-conceived, not original; not even campy.  It's like watching stunt choreography done by someone who had never seen a movie before, but had been told about ""The Matrix"" and thought it sounded nifty.  Ridiculous . . . and I'm not usually grumpy about fight scenes, I don't care whether they're realistic or not.  These just suck.

There is a subplot about how some of the characters are ""hemophages,"" or vampires, but they don't do anything that vampires do; they don't suck blood, they don't burn in the sun, they . . . oh, they just don't make any sense.  Occasionally, it looks like they have fangs, but they disappear during most of the scenes with no explanation.

The color scheme is preposterous.  The entire movie -- and I'm not making this up or exaggerating in the tiniest degree -- looks like a Revlon ad.  Stylish?!?  No, sir.  Only if you're a chump, and a 13-year-old one at that.  Every single scene screams, LOOK . . . HOW . . . COOL . . . I . . . AM!  And yet, not one single cool thing ever happens.  NOT . . . ONE.

What more can I say?  If you liked this, I hate you.  I also hate your mother, your various uncles, your uncles' barbers, your elementary-school best friend, and the last person who sold you a taco.  And if you haven't seen ""Battlefield Earth,"" check it out, cause you will dig it the most.

If you buy this DVD, I hate you more, to the slender extent that that is possible.

I work at a movie theatre as a projectionist; I get paid to watch movies before they come out, and even on the clock, I felt like I was being ripped off while watching this tomfoolery.  I almost clocked out and left; this movie is seriously THAT bad.  But I didn't.  You want to know why I stayed and suffered?

I did it for you.

That's right, I did it so you don't have to.  I wept with rage; I shouted at the projector and begged it to break; I threw up in my mouth; I resolved to never talk down ""Big Momma's House 2"" again.  I did all of those things and more.  But I stayed.

2565223,1,B000FGGE7C,"Normally, when a movie has its colors dulled or placed in super sharp contrast, its done to indicate either flashbacks or sentimentality. In the 2006 flick Ultraviolet, these color tricks are used in every single sequence, indeed in each and every frame. Ultraviolet looks incredible, but ultimately it is just another flash and trash flick.

Ultraviolet is a painfully bad mixture of fantastic cinematography and awful acting and direction. The film is basically a bad Matrix ripoff. And the script is just plain bizarre.

In the future America depicted in Ultraviolet, there are two different kinds of people. The first group act just like characters from the Matrix movies, including the ability to dodge bullets and the like. They are also at heart vampires, although this aspect of the movie was poorly handled to the point that the vampire bit was confusing. The other group consists of normal everyday folks. Of course, the normal folks are at heart fascists and hate the Matrix types.

The level of acting in Ulatraviolet is horrible. You can tell that the actors are in this movie just for the pay checks. They just go through the motions, not even trying to act.

This is not the first movie directed by Kurt Wimmer that was basically a ripoff of The Matrix trilogy. He also made the hit Equilibrium. As a director, Wimmer specializes in lots of flashy action sequences. The end result is movies that look cool, but are ultimately empty.

The basic problem with Ultraviolet is that its all surface gloss. Ultraviolet has a clear similarity to a somewhat earlier movie, Aeon Flux in that its all flash and trash. Both flicks are basically nothing more than godawful messes of gosh wow and would be cool and wonderful stuff.

Incidently, the answer of course is the same--a life without love is not a life at all.  You are just waiting to die.  I thought that was really neat.

Anyway, this is no Oscar contender (nor was Equilibrium) but it is very slick and features some very interesting premises on the future.  The art direction is gorgeous and the use of white light really helps to convey the sterility of this future world.

The villain is interesting and entertainingly played by the actor.  I loved the showdown at the end.

Milla does such an amazing job.  We have seen her do physical stuff before so that is no stretch.  However, what makes her performance here so singular is the emotion she brings to the character and the fact that she is allowed to be beautiful and more feminine.  All the toughness and such are there as well, but this time her character is more balanced.

My question is, ""Is there a problem with this?""

Ultraviolet was a fun 'comic book movie' with a touch of Anime feel, a touch of 'Brave New World' and a very interesting blending of CGI that was (in my opinion) not ""low budge"" but quality controled to straddle the line between the comic book world and the 'live action world.

However, the rest of it is just plain awful, especially down to our nemesis.  At any moment, I expect one of his subordinates to hesitantly cut in, ""Sir...ahemmmm...excuse me, sir?  That's not how you wear a nasal strip, sir.  You still snore at night.""  Yes, I have a hard time not laughing at the bad guy, especially considering the amount of gratuitous olfactory close-ups that subject us to realizing that there is WIRE MESH on his ""nose plugs"" which supposedly keep him safe from harm.  Now that it's said, I need to tap the director on the shoulder in order for him to realize that he could still catch airborne illnesses through HIS MOUTH.  (rolls eyes and hammers desk triumphantly).

Perhaps it would have been funnier if our ""bad guy"" had more lines with the letter ""s"" in it.  ""Are you inthane?  How thupid are you?""

Admittedly, the action scenes are incredible, but after about 10 minutes, one gets the impression that Violet is so invulnerable that any action scene involving her lacks the suspense to carry the action forward.  Her role is simply to dance around in a circle in a dazzling array of gunfire that takes everyone out and leaves her unscathed.  Somehow, her concern for her well-being seems entirely misplaced given that taking out 20 guys gives her a good workout and a couple stray stands of hair for ""injuries.""

The whole scene involving Violet's ever-changing clothes and hair was downright exasperating and the part where the purple sparks dance from eyelid to eyelid almost made me inadvertently laugh--I'm sorry, was this Xanadu?!?  The over-saturated, candy-brilliant colors have been done before, as in ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow"", not to mention others.

The film starts off with Milla narrating:  ""I come from a world that you may not understand.""  The way she reads the line, one can almost hear it coming across apologetically.

Batman, Luke Skywalker, and GI Joe could really do some unbelievable things when backed with a child's imagination. So take that idea, create a hour-and-a-half movie out of it and call it Ultraviolet.

Ultraviolet is her own set of action figures, complete with color-change hair, color-change clothes, weapons that appear out of nowhere and an indestructible motorcycle that can drive up the sides of buildings.

You know you're in trouble when the plot and history of the movie is laid out for you in the first five minutes, then it's off to digital overkill. You become so bombarded with over-the-top digital effects, unbelievable stunts, and an incredibly lame plot that by the time you leave the theater you're not exactly sure how to feel.

Lets get a bigger budget, a female action star and comic book appeal (electra, Fantastic 4, Blade) mix them all up and have ourselves a hit. Well was it entertaining ,at times, Yes. But it missed the mark on everthing else. They even stole a scene directly from an old Lone Wolf and Cub movie when they dropped the boy down the well. The boy drops his shoe she counts how long it takes to hit bottom and then she vanhishes the emeny in time to rescue the boy before he hits bottom after being dropped by the bad guy.

2565234,1,B000FGGE7C,"Ultraviolet follows the exploits of Violet, played by Milla Jovovich, in a futuristic society in which many citizens are infected with a virus, and then are immediately ""disposed of"" by the government.  Those infected with the virus are called hemophages, or vampires.  In this movie, however, the hemophages don't literally suck the blood from people, they use other sources, such as blood banks or what not to retrieve their fuel.  Violet is a hemophage, who has decided not to take it anymore, and she joins up with a hemophage resistance group.  When the humans discover a ""weapon"" that will destroy all hemophages, the hemophages send in Violet to retrieve the weapon before the government can use it.  When Violet discovers that this weapon is really a young boy, she decides to betray everyone she's ever known for some random child that she knows nothing about.

First, let me start with the positives of the film.  Firstly, the film is visually stunning.  It looks very similar to Wimmer's previous film, Equilibrium, but Ultraviolet is a lot more colorful than the dark environment of Equilibrium.  Secondly, the action scenes in the film actually aren't all that bad.  The first 20 minutes of the film is straight up action, and after that point, I actually had my hopes up a little bit.  Yes, the effects look fake most of the time, but the film was obviously trying to look like a comic book, and it succeeds in that aspect.

Now, the negatives, which are fairly numerous, so I will try to be brief.  The first, and worst, negative of the film is the acting.  Simply put, it is horrendous.  Milla Jovovich has never been known for her acting ability, but that is why she is normally in films that really require no emotion from the leading lady.  Unfortunately, the writing in this film requires Violet to actually show emotion and caring for this boy that she is protecting.  It isn't just Jovovich's lack of acting ability, though, it is also the inept script that Kurt Wimmer put together.  One second, Violet is portrayed as an extremely lethal, uncaring vampire, who will kill anyone in her way.  The next moment, and for no reason, we are supposed to believe that Violet would betray everyone she's ever known just after seeing the boy,  not even talking to him or finding out exactly why he is considered a ""weapon.""  The ""Archcardinal,"" the villain, is also a horrible actor.  I don't even know this guy's name, and I never want to.  Portrayed as the classic movie villain, he has so many cheesy lines that just make you want to laugh, no matter how serious the film is trying to be.

It is also amazing how the film drags in the middle.  Even though the film runs a meager 85 minutes, it seemed like it was at least two hours long, and that is really unbelievable.  When there isn't action occurring onscreen, it is pointless dialogue about a plot that the viewer knows absolutely nothing about, except for a brief overview by Violet at the beginning of the film.  Ultimately, I just found myself sitting in the theater, just waiting for the film to finally come to the end, and when it did, I was overjoyed.

The really sad thing about the film is that the basic setup could actually be used to make an interesting, possibly good movie.  I think that Wimmer was trying to send a message through the film, as he did with Equilibrium, but he failed as a filmmaker on just about every level in this film.  Whatever message Wimmer was trying to send, it was completely lost in the grade-school acting, boring dialogue, and ridiculously overdone (but enjoyable) action scenes.  Her name is Violet, and she is in a movie that you definitely won't understand (or like).",1142726400,,3685,4.675465838509317

Violet's job is to find the doomsday weapon he has created, and destroy it.  The doomsday weapon is a child named Six (Bright), and when Violet is unable to kill him, her own people set out to find her too.

""Ultraviolet"" is a bad movie.  The acting is bad, the special effects are bad, the fight scenes are bad, the dialogue is bad, and even the story itself is less than stellar.

2565237,2,B000FGGE7C,"Kurt Wimmer first burst on to the scene with the stylish, dystopic Equilibrium. This little-seen film when it was first released in the theaters soon garnered a cult following once on DVD. What was not to like about Wimmer's directorial debut. It had stylish action, a plot seemningly taken out from an Orwellian playbook and a cast of good to great performances. This sophomore effort from Wimmer got my interest the moment I read about it in the trades. It seemed like a continuation of his take on future dystopia but with a medical twist. I expected alot, though not too much that I overhyped the film to even myself, but what I finally saw once the film hit the theater was something that was a total mess.

Ultraviolet takes place in another future dystopia where the world became ruled by a medical establishment that's become religiously fanatical in its quest to protect the world from a plague that genetically-resequenced humans into vampire-like beings called Hemophages. The main character Violet, as played by genre favorite Milla Jovovich, is such a being who is now a member of a dying and hunted species. Violet would've been a cool character if she was abit more fleshed out, so to speak. The character in the film was pretty much indestructible despite the growing odds she had to go up against. I understood from the intro sequence that Ultraviolet was playing on the comic-book style of storytelling and characterization, but Wimmer went overboard in making Violet too Ultra. The story itself doesn't even rise to the level of basic barebones. The ideas presented in the film were still interesting, but it seemed that the audience entered the film sometime during the middle part of the story. So many ideas were being forcefed to the audience through medical mumbo-jumbo that after awhile I just tuned it out. The story pretty much rushed from one talky scene to the next with techno-soundtracked action sequences filling out the gaps.

The action looks to have been rehashed from the gunkata of Equilibrium. As much as it would've looked cool in Ultraviolet, the PG-13 rating meant no blood and all the kills done so cleanly or offscreen that one almost thought they were watching something made-for-tv. Kurt Wimmer does know how to create action scenes. One in particular involves Violet on a motorcycle against several helicopter gunships. This was the only scene in the film where I actually enjoyed what I was watching. The soft, dreamlike look of the film even gave the sequence a very surrealistic feel to it. But in the end it wasn't enough to save the film. The rest of the action scenes look to be too choreographed and again the bloodless look to them didn't exactly make them better. Milla Jovovich did look good as Violet and earning a reputation as the premiere female action star, but she could've done and chosen a better project to showcase her talents.

Wimmer really regressed alot with this second film, but rumors abound that it might not be all his fault. I don't doubt that talks of the studio getting overly involved in the editing and writing process of the film could've led to the mess that was the fiished product. It's just hard to see how a talented, up-and-coming action director like Wimmer could go from Equilibrium to Ultraviolet in such a short time. Ultraviolet looked like a film that had great intentions when it first began but ended up looking lost and deflated by the time the credits rolled. Here's to hoping that Kurt Wimmer learns from this debacle and goes back to doing what made Equilibrium a cult-fave instead of the stuff he did that made Ultraviolet awful.",1142294400,,3629,4.8125

I found this movie much more fun than watching Rambo fire a machine gun for ten minutes straight.

Although the script and plot were only somewhat better than Matrix (talk about abysmal), Milla Jovovitch, her personal trainer, and her costume designer really get an A+ for style and appeal.

2565244,3,B000FGGE7C,"Hemo-prefix, blood

Phage-suffix, something that eats or destroys.  E.g. bacteriophage.

I can't help feel that 11 September has affected moviemaking in presenting commentary on the aftereffects of that tragedy.  In the case of Crash, it was ethnic relations.  Instead of the ""war on terrorism,"" there is a war against viruses and their carriers in Ultraviolet.  A mutated virus infects certain people who are called hemophages.  To maintain the health security of the people, special squads a scientific-oriented equivalent of Homeland Security under the leadership of the villainous Vice Cardinal Daxus, are sent to hunt down and exterminate the hemophages.  Daxus is a stereotypical smarmy cartoonish villain, who has a pair of plugs, or are those filters-through both nostrils.  And the presence of white plastic gloves and his unwrapping guns from sterilized packages make him the posterboy for bacteriophobia.  Interesting too is the shape of Daxus's headquarters, in a cross, like a cathedral, making germ-freedom into a kind of religion.

Yet, a small resistance group has formed.  Among them is Violet, or V, a warrior with long jet black hair, glossy midriffed fetish suits of varying colours, a brace of machine guns that look more like staple guns, and a sword with some runes all over the blade.  They're very lethal, yet with the exception of some opponents on a rooftop, many of her opponents die without any blood.  And even without weapons, she is quite the martial artist a la Crouching Tiger.  V, herself once human, until the virus infecting her caused the death of her husband and unborn child-she was pregnant at the time-now hates humans, given how marginalized and persecuted hemophages are.

Despite being called hemophages, the only thing remotely similar to vampires is the telltale fangs, which aren't for drinking Transylvanian tea.  Some characteristics of their mutations involve conjuring weapons from their bodies and a superior strength.

Assigned by the leader of the hemophage underground leader, Nerva, to steal a secret weapon that if used, would kill all hemophages, and which, if not delivered on time, will self-destruct, V passes herself off as a courier.  When her cover's blown, she takes on several masked and heavily uniformed black and white-suited guards using her weapons.  Yet, when she discovers that the ""weapon"" is a child named Six, for a reason that becomes clear later in the film, some maternal instincts take over and she flees from Nerva and the rebels, Six in tow.  She has to avoid the hoards of Daxus's armed men, and fortunately gets help from Garth, a fellow hemophage and scientist.

Despite the comic book style opening sequence, those into PS/2, XBOX style games, and not DC or Marvel Comics collectors, will probably be the biggest fans of this movie.  Watching the chase scene where V is pursued after leaving Daxus's headquarters, the peppered bulletholes, copters, shiny sides of skyscrapers all make Ultraviolet a video game on the big screen.  And there is a focus on aerial shots, where the however-many assailants surround V in a circle, only to be made digital mincemeat out of them, sometimes set to a pulsing techno score during the fighting or chase scenes, another dynamic of video games.  It's been mentioned along with Tron, itself an 80's movie that computerized its characters.  I'd also add the sci-fi/noir atmosphere of Bladerunner crossed with Minority Report as another comparing factor.

Milla Jovovich's action films have a sci-fi bent to them-e.g. The Fifth Element and Resident Evil.  Here, she's a sci-fi guardian of a child, and it's not the acting but her glossy appearance and moves that are the heart of the movie.  So, despite the widespread panning by critics, what's my assessment?  If one concentrates more on its stylistic merits and Jovovich, rather than plot, then it's worth a look.  Those who automatically dismiss it as being another Matrix clone will probably not enjoy it.",1141689600,,3981,5.135093167701863

For the past 40 years I have been hearing women complaining about movies being sexiest from the very first silent films in the 1920's to 1990.  By 1995 that fact seem to fade and this movie proves it.

Before 1965 these movies were being referred to as sexist because they would put women on display by having them wear certain type of clothes.  Ultraviolet seems to be exposing the same as those old sexist movies did but it no longer seems to matter.  Why?  Is it because she is slaughtering men?

Sexist?  When did the movie studios ever come out with a film with one man taking on a large group of women and he would kill every one of them?  Oh, that is sexist but ""Ultraviolet"" is only a movie.

Just like ""Kill Bill!""  The only time the star woman had to fight back is when she was attacking a woman.  She had no problem killing off 20 men all at once.  There was no competition.  Now that is Sexist!

You want to see something that is sexist watch a lot of action adventure films that have been made these past ten years.  What wrong?  Can't anyone enjoy seeing a man running a sword threw a woman?  I guess not.  Every time I bring this topic up I get the same reaction.  Oh, I must enjoy seeing women get killed!  Boy, I am sick!

Ultraviolet is supposed to be for entertainment and it is a fantasy yet it is sexist.  So, before you start thinking that I am making something out of nothing you better give this some serious thought.  Our kids are growing up on these fantasies not just in movies but also in comic books and video games.

Most movies that take place in the future looks like today's world. U are able to tell something is out of sync, somehow. But Kurt Wimmer had a vision, a true vison. Non of the buildings were recognizable all of the vehicles were prototypes. U had a bracelets for credit cards? Dispensible telephones that pop out of a machines? The set and architecture were all original. Even though they were CGI's at least there was time and thought put into it. The sets were very colorful and the costumes were cool. This was extremley well made as far as creativity was concerned.

 The fight sequences were bad ass ! Yes, there were a couple of fights that were too short. And the odds were just unbelievable ! But for the most part these were some of the best fight sequences I have seen since Kill bill ! Especially when she took out all those guards in that library and that orchestrated music was playing. At the end of the fight she held her gun up in the air, Kneeled down with sprinkles falling ! That was bad ass ! I almost wanted to get up and clap after that. I was high off of adrenaline the whole time I was in the theater. I hadn't felt like that since kill bill ! Milla was stunning throughout and very tough through the film. Her confidence and straight forwardness, made u really believe in what she was doing. Everyone's arguement was that she was no stronger than anyone she was fighting. Well ! have u ever been pissed off ? When someone is pissed they can do the impossible. And she was a very pissed and a angry young lady. Which the explained at the beginning of the movie Why? So in a since I can see that it is quite possible for her to take out some of the people she did. The movie opens up with 40 mins of none stop action ! This is before u get to any type of plot which  I felt was a new and interesting way to open ! I love the matrix as much as anyone else did ! But in all honesty after the first, reloaded offered very little more. At times the Matrix got to preachy and put me to sleep ! Equilibrum showed Kurt Wimmer's potiental as an amazing fight coordinator ! But was illustrated very little because of Equilibrium's long drawn out plot ! In this film he just showed out and gave us nothing but action. It seemed like he was trying too hard but it was effective ! I have never seen ANYTHING like this ! I can honestley say with a straight face! I am not a action move lover because they bore me ! But this was a visually stunning film, I don't care what anyone says ! This was much more appealing to me than Resident Evil: Apocalyse ! That  had wooden acting and not so great effects compared to this ! But Ultraviolet delivers something abit more ! If your looking for ""Brokeback mountain"" this movie isn't for you. This is a artistic piece for people that like visuals!

 The movie critics are horrible ! Noone can appreaciate a fun unusual unique movie anymore. Its a shame when movies like Underworld: Evolutions, Bloodrayne (Better than most), Equilibrium, May, High Tension, Mulholland Dr and Donnie Darko. Can't get any awards, recongnition or decent ratings ! But Sh*t like Brokeback Mountian and Memoirs of Geisa this is the Sh*t that people think it Great ? What is the world coming too ? And King Kong ? Something that has been made twice already ? Please David Lynch, Len Wisemen, Lucky Mckee and Kurt Wimmer don't give up in film making ! There are still people out there who can appreciate real art and not ""Tear jerkers !"" And how is it that ""Million dollar baby"" got voted out over Kill bill,last year at the Emmy's or Oscars ? Who knows ! See that is what I am talking about ! Even Hustle and Flow ? That was crap but that is what the world has come too ! Oh well ! I am interested in seeing how Basic Instinct 2 does ?

2565250,3,B000FGGE7C,"The first thing that struck me about ""Ultraviolet"" was just how stylized each frame of film was. This is due to more than just CGI; there's also a surreal quality to the characters, their skin a little too smooth and their complexions a little too vibrant to pass off as realistic. No question about it; it was fascinating to look at. And let's not forget the high tech shots of firearms and swords materializing from tiny devices worn on the assailants' wrists. That was fascinating to look at, as well. But as with a lot of big budget action flicks, this is a visually stunning piece that lags behind on story and dialogue, and for the general movie going population, it would only come off as a headache inducing music video.

But for the comic book buffs and action film junkies, these are qualities that just might make their day. Made in the tradition of adrenaline pumping sci-fi films like the ""Matrix"" Trilogy (and even more so like the ""Underworld"" films), ""Ultraviolet"" is a perfect example of a film adapted from original comic book material: it's overwhelmingly frenetic, filled to the brim with highly choreographed fight sequences and completely saturated with futuristic details (including architecture, weapons, and costumes; one building is shaped like the biohazard symbol). Its energetic pace is enhanced by means of Klaus Badelt's throbbing score, an opus inspired by the hypnotic beats of techno clubs. At times I wondered why they even bothered trying to come up with a story; the battle scenes were entertaining enough, as was seeing Milla Jovovich in yet another superhero-type role. (And we all know she's not too bad looking; why else would a few seconds be reserved to show her exposed behind?).

But if you're hoping to experience a meaningful story with a cleverly disguised hidden message, then this is the wrong movie for you. Set in some distant yet unspecified future year, the movie begins with the voiceover narration of Violet (Milla Jovovich), saying, ""I was born into a world you probably wouldn't understand."" She goes on to say that, in an attempt to eradicate a deadly viral infection, the government's scientists only managed to make it stronger. It then spread quickly, mutating countless numbers of civilians into a race of modernized vampires called Hemophanges, humanoids with superior skill and intelligence. Many of them are then taken away and exterminated (and this parallels history with disturbing accuracy). But a few survived, and they are the ones who fight back.

And it's a good thing, too. A militant government corporation led by the organized and seemingly germophobic Daxus (Nick Chinlund) has apparently developed a secret weapon meant to exterminate Hemophanges once and for all. Violet is sent to retrieve this weapon, and she painstakingly does so, going through scores of guards and security personnel with her lightening fast reflexes and razor sharp senses (along with a few well places slices of her machete-type blade).

The initially straightforward plan unravels when she takes a peek inside the weapon case and discovers a human child. His name is Six (Cameron Bright), a quiet, somewhat melodramatic character that has been genetically modified. How and for what purpose is one of the mysteries of the story, which wouldn't have been so bad had a fewer number of twists and revelations been used. Everything we suspect about him is disregarded at one point or another, and after a while, it becomes exhausting trying to invest in an unknowable character. (And has Bright ever played a normal child? All he seems to be able to play are brooding, disturbed children, like in ""Godsend,"" and ""Birth."") The only way to determine anything at all about him is to analyze his relationship with Violet. At first, she only sees him as a means to save her own life. But as the story progresses, she grows more and more attached to him. There is a specific reason for this, but telling you what it is would be giving too much away. Let's just say that her life experiences have left lasting impressions.

I think the biggest problem this film has is that certain things are just too unbelievable, even for a comic book. For one thing, Violet has the ability to defeat dozens of artillery and self-defense trained guards with minimal effort. You'd think this could be excused; remember that Hemophanges are physically superior to humans, and because of this, they should be able to take on any form of attack. Yet Daxus and his men are able to gun down Violet's comrades as easily as if they were swatting flies. Does this mean that somehow she's an even more superior being? I would have liked it if the film had answered this question, but since they didn't, all I can do is guess that it was for the sake of plot advancement.

Unfortunately, the plot has so many holes in it that any form of advancement would be incoherent. Such a large chunk of necessary information is left in the dark, most of which is detail regarding Violet and the government (in other words; all the main characters). None of this is helped much by the amateurish dialogue: a blending of first-draft-quality one liners and fragmented attempts at voiceover summations. Granted, a lot of comic books are written like that, and if you enjoy reading them, then you'll probably find that ""Ultraviolet"" succeeds in every way. I'm sure the violence will keep many people cheering and hollering (even though this is a virtually gore free film). And the special effects are top notch; who cares whether or not they harm an already weak story instead of help it? Some don't care, and for them, this film will be waiting. For everyone else, it's best to just avoid it altogether.",1141430400,,5708,4.8793814432989695
2565251,1,B000FGGE7C,"What happened? This is not the movie depicted in the previews.

I went into it expecting a special effects packed action flick with very little plot and a whole lot of crazy matrix style crap. In short, exactly what you would think after seeing the preview.

Instead, what I got barely even qualified as an action movie. In several scenes, Voilet simply twists around in a circle, and everyone around her dies, as if by magic. One or two action scenes were notable, specifically when she is dodging bullets in the middle of a large group of shooters, and when fighting with the gun/swords in a very equilibrium-esk fashion. But those two scenes were horribly overshadowed by the ""different-camera-angle-every-second"" footage of most of the action, and the just GODAWFUL dialog. I actually was having difficulty not laughing at the script, as it seemed to have been written in the style of ""twelve-year-olds writing love poetry to their gradeschool crush."" The cheesy lines were bad, but the stilted ""tender"" moments were so horribly bad that it made the Starwars Episode 2 dialog seem well written in comparison. And the script was made worse by the horribly timing, which was just as painful. This isn't the WORST movie i've ever seen, but its the most disappointing, especially after the badass previews. Im convinced that about halfway through this thing, they scrapped the script and started over ala Ewe Boll, just reusing the same footage in a different order, spliced together to form what seems to be the dumbest storyline EVER.",1141430400,,1536,4.949612403100775
2565252,4,B000FGGE7C,"Sometimes you just have to suspend disbelief. At first I thought this film was a bit hokey--particularly because the trailer looked so cool--but then I realized it is what it is. By that I mean, the film goes out of its way--especially in the opening title and credits--to make sure you know and understand what you are about to see is a live-action depiction of a comic book. Hence, the simple story of good vs. evil, and conflicted heroine straddling the gray area of existence (humans vs. vampire [if you will]), transcends disebelief with (sartorial) style. I can't say they weren't well-dressed and color coordinated! Yes it's a bit formulaic, ala ""The Matrix,"" ""Kill Bill,"" and even ""Highlander"" (the ending), but it holds its own as a comic book heroine coming to life for our entertainment. Just enjoy it for what it is!",1141430400,,828,4.7972027972027975
2565253,2,B000FGGE7C,"First off, the writer and director of this film, Kurt Wimmer, wrote and directed Equilibrium in 2002. Equilibrium had an amazing plot somewhat between The Matrix and Fahrenheit 451. The choreography was some of the best, with awesome Gun-Fu and sword scenes. With that said, Ultraviolet was nothing like Equilibrium.

The movie's biggest downfall was it's unrealistic fight scenes. Sure, it's setting is in the future, but have you ever seen 20 people die in one swipe of a sword? As of last night, I have. There are countless times where Violet is surrounded by upwards of 30 men (Yes, with fully automatic guns)and she kills them all in less than two minutes - without breaking a sweat.

With that put aside, the music was awesome, composed by Klaus Bedalt who also composed music for Pirates of the Carribbean. The visual effects were amazing aswell; everything has a futuristic look to it. Milla Jovovich is a great actress, and her badass attitude saves the movie from being a total dive.

Overall, it's movies like this that make me want to get into the Film Business.",1141430400,,1074,4.794594594594595
2565254,3,B000FGGE7C,"I really don't know what to make of this movie. It's kind of like a combination of an ultra-cool eye candy spectacle mixed with the world's worst acid trip. Not that I've ever done acid, but I think this is what it must be like.

Comparisons to ""Aeon Flux"" are inevitable, and the two movies do share a lot in common. Both rely on the sex appeal of the female leads. Both are set in a futuristic metropolis-like world where the heroine must battle all sorts of baddies. Both contain strange looking devices, gadgets and other items only found in this type of film. But I found ""Aeon Flux"" to be a little more cohesive in its script; ""Ultraviolet"" goes all over the place with little flow in the plot. And the mind-numbingly bad dialog doesn't help it.

But it does have its good points. This has to be one of the coolest-looking movies I've ever seen. Very short on substance, yes, but visually awesome. And what's not to like about Milla Jovovich? Cameron Bright turns in a fairly standard performance as a kid whose only name is Six. Come to think of it, his performance in this movie is pretty much a carbon-copy of his role in ""Birth,"" with that I-know-something-about-you blank stare of his that seems to be becoming his trademark acting style.

All in all, ""Ultraviolet"" isn't a bad movie, nor is it a particularly good one either. But its eye candy makes up for what it lacks in a plot and characters one can care about. Worth seeing on the big screen, but at a matinee price.",1141344000,,1483,4.464944649446495
2565255,5,B000FGGE7C,"To start things off, seeing Milla in Resident Evil and Resident Evil: Apocolypse impressed me to no end. She's like a modern day Sigourney Weaver, showing her tough as nails passion in action/sci fi flicks and Ultraviolet is all Jovovich.

Similar to Matrix/Elektra/Aeon Flux style, the story is about the battle between humans and a new race with genetic mutation. Pretty cliche, but when you see how it's pulled off you'll adore it. The action is pretty good, with lots of shoot outs and swordfighting, more realistic and awesome seeing Milla with a sword than let's say- Uma Thurman. Oh and when you see the way she carries all those weapons with her, you're gonna say ""that's freaking clever!"" The CGI cities and effects are pretty good, but there are scenes where it's overdone. Sure there's more action than story, but this type of Jovovich movie gets people ready for the next Resident Evil.

Since Resident Evil, Milla never let her crowd down. She's one of the best female action stars in history and hope she continues her beat down on the big screen in the near future. This chick has a future ahead of her.",1141344000,,1118,4.698979591836735
