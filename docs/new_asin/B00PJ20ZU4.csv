8688204,3,B00PJ20ZU4,"The ESPN 30 for 30 series can sometimes produce a mixed bag.  While there never has been a bad episode, there are some profoundly mediocre ones (Sean Pamphilon's ""Run Ricky Run"" being chief among them).  Obviously, there a high number of truly great episodes, as well... which is why the series is such a critical success.  Usually when it doesn't hit the ball out of the park (sports metaphor is intentional), it results in a 'just ok' episode.
  Those 'just ok' types are typically characterized by telling an interesting tale, but being largely uncertain of how they want to tell it.  You end up with lots of fascinating pieces of a story, but a very unfocused narrative.  ""Playing for the Mob"" falls squarely in that category.  The underlying tale is about the infamous Boston College men's basketball point-shaving scandal from the late 70's.  One of the mobsters made famous by the movie ""Goodfellas"", Henry Hill, played a significant role in arranging that con.  While this episode is long on many of the interesting details, it is short on what point it is trying to make.
  Are the producers trying to make the crux of the story being about BC player Rick Kuhn cajoling Jim Sweeney and Ernie Cobb to join in?  Is the point about mafia strong-arm tactics forcing these players' involvement (tactics that seem much less obvious as the interviews go on)?  Is it about the FBI really trying to get back mafia high-roller Jimmy Burke?  or, is it about Henry Hill selling out a bunch of people to get a good plea deal?  You can't really tell.
  In addition, there are other parts that are very fuzzy;  such as, what do they think Jim Sweeney's role in this really is?  On one hand they make him look like largely naive kid who knew what was happening, didn't participate and later realized he made bad decisions.  Then, they later make him seem to be conniving schemer who knew exactly what he was going and, when the authorities got close, threw everyone else under the bus.  Then there is the matter of them saying that, following an investigation of the game films, no evidence of point-shaving could be found.  So, they are trying to say this scandal that happened didn't happen?  (and what was the point of Henry Hill and Paul Mazzei meeting up at the end?)....
  There is so many interesting sides about this scandal, that it is pretty disappointing that 30 for 30 couldn't put together a better documentary on it.  Editing and reorganizing the narrative could have made this a sharper, more powerful show.",1481846400,,2515,4.695652173913044
8688205,1,B00PJ20ZU4,"I paid $15 for a brand new DVD and received a sealed case with a cheap burned DVD-R inside. There was a cheap label stuck to the top of it that was bubbling and warped. It looked like some knockoff you'd buy in a flea market in Taiwan. It would not even play in my computer or DVD player. Had to return it. If Amazon is going to charge premium prices for DVDs, I expect to get a legitimate, factory created disc, not some cheap ripoff I could have burned myself for about ten cents.",1473292800,,482,4.08421052631579
