821859,2,6304252145,"Jennifer Connelly must be desperate for work, becuase it's been ages since I've seen her in anyhting that showed off her considerable talents. This one is probably the worst. It's a ridiculous caper movie trying to masquerade as a serious film. It's starts out fairly decently with the Banderas character, then puts Connelly's in clear focus as the central character. Once it gets to the scene where they are investigating the cave as two professionals, then start doing it on the very uncomfortable cave floor, you know it's a stupid film, and it just goes downhill from there. It turns into maudlin sentimentality after that, with very overplayed scenes of him helping her after being shot down in the street.  It wasn't the acting that was bad, though, it was everything else.  I was hoping Banderas would just take her on his motorcycle and get Jennifer out of there, because they both deserve a writer/director better than Betty Kaplan.",963878400,15,941,4.911949685534591
821860,4,6304252145,"Lets face it lads, this one isn't in your collection for the storyline. Connelly looks sensational, and reveals all in various stages of the film. The plot disappears amongst wishes of if only!  Its a good film, don't get  me wrong, but the action concentrates very much on its female star. And  rightly so!",951350400,11,307,4.648148148148148
821861,3,6304252145,"This is a film that makes me want to go out and get the book because I felt as if I needed to know all of the story. I had the feeling that much of the performance was edited out in order to fit in a 104 minute format.  Sad! The story is of a young, sheltered woman who is awakened to the  reality of life in a military dictatorship. Along the way she also learns  ""about love between a man and a women, love of family"" love of  country. Her teacher, Francisco Leal, a man who ""works in the  shadows"" is played to perfection by Antonio Banderas. Jennifer  Connelly is wonderful as Irene. The downside to this film is the  heavy-handed editing.",929577600,27,643,4.178861788617886

Francisco Leal (Banderas) is an on-the-edge photographer whose work with a beautiful magazine reporter (Connelly) uncovers a government's nightmare: a secret so deadly, the military will stop at nothing to eliminate them! Now, as they are thrown together into danger ... and drawn closer by passion ... they must risk everything for a chance at freedom.

822346,4,6304252145,"Since there are lots of reviews here of the film, I'll limit my comments to this DVD. It's enhanced for widescreen TVs (some call this ""anamorphic widescreen"") and has Dolby Digital Surround Sound. It looks and sounds great.",1297814400,,224,4.921052631578948

822348,2,6304252145,"Jennifer  Connelly is a great actress but unfortunately she doesn't shine in this movie. Banderas had zero chemistry with Connelly and their love scenes lacked the passion that the  characters in the book had.  Banderas is handsome and charismatic but not enough to play Francisco Leal. This is the second character he plays from an Isabel Allende book and even though he had little screen time in HOTS his acting in this movie was more convincing, plus he had more chemistry with Ryder. I recommend the book Not the movie.",1261008000,,523,4.788888888888889
822349,3,6304252145,"Betty Kaplan's ""Of Love & Shadows"" may not be quite as provocative as the cover suggests, but it is an interesting adaptation of Isabel Allende's book about the fascist politics of Chile under General Pinochet.  This film was released in 1984.  Jennifer Connelly who stars would win her Best Supporting Actress Oscar in 2001 for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Beautiful-Mind-Widescreen-Awards-Edition/dp/B00005JKQZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Beautiful Mind (Widescreen Awards Edition)</a>.  As Irene becomes politically aware, we observe great changes.  She moves from a superficial life of privilege to a dedicated freedom fighter.  She is engaged to her cousin Gustavo played by Camillo Gallardo.  The film sends out one signal as Gustavo disrobes and ""presents arms"" to his cousin then shifts as we see Gustavo as a hard government soldier.  Meanwhile, Irene encounters Francisco played by Antonio Bandaras.  Bandaras' performance was so real that I had a hard time hearing & even understanding him throughout the film.  Mumbling aside, he's a serious worker ""in the shadows"" from the start and adds a layer of love as he falls for Irene.  Why a guy with Antonio's looks was single in the first place was never explained.  Diego Wallraff plays Jose, Francico's brother who is a priest and tries to get the Cardinal to help with releasing human rights information to the world.  I found the backstory of the revolution in Chile to be interesting and the scenery as Irene & Francisco flee was breathtaking.  While Betty Kaplan's direction seems to leave great holes in the story and sends out mixed signals between its romantic story & political intrigue, it is interesting for an evening's viewing.  Enjoy!",1220745600,9,1756,5.52808988764045
822350,4,6304252145,"I think this movie was very good movie and romantic.

You will have to see this movie to truly understand it.

822353,3,6304252145,"Chile and Argentina have gone through tragic years during the 70's, and this movie attempted to tackle what happened - everyday at the time, in Chile. Two good actors (Banderas and Connelly) seem lost in a poor script and directorship, although Allende knew the subject from the inside (I did not read her book yet).
Banderas could not concentrate and acted quite bad, and you can see that the way his eyes wander in several scenes with Jennifer. She makes a big effort in her role, but this is not one of her good movies.
In Jennifer's attempt to bring the South American political disaster to the screen, a much better (remarkable) film is Waking the Dead. A must see!
Note: their love scene in Of Love and Shadows could produce a tender moment in this play, but was grossly produced and the director missed the chance, unfortunately.",1057968000,32,836,4.655405405405405

7866320,5,6304252145,"As far as I am concerned, Antonio Banderas best role.  If you don't think of him as a serious actor, or think of him as a Hollywood creation without much depth, think again.  He is young here, in this story, in his prime of acting life.  This is an amazing, serious drama, with the quality of poetry and the film itself has the idealism of an activist.  A much underrated film.",1464739200,3,377,4.267605633802817
