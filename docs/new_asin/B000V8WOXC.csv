2933948,4,B000V8WOXC,I have done Winsor Pilates at the gym I go to for the last few years.  I decided to get my own set so that I could continue at home when I just can't get to the gym.  I am 56 and I love this particular set.  Don't be intimidated by the girls in the video.  Just remember any exercise at any age is better than nothing and pilates are not too hard on the body.,1311465600,,359,3.6842105263157894
2933949,3,B000V8WOXC,I do these routines on days when I want to do some exercise but not kill myself working out.  The series are okay in that they target the specific areas gently but pointedly.  However I didn't find them all that challenging.  But they are pleasant and easy to do and yet still feel like you are doing something to keep yourself toned.,1309996800,2,334,4.354838709677419
2933950,5,B000V8WOXC,"Great product and seller.  We had a little confusion as to the product that I ordered and the product that was shipped, but as soon as I told the seller they were prompt as getting me the original order!",1243814400,3,203,4.205128205128205
2933951,5,B000V8WOXC,"I was bored with my other Winsor Pilates DVDs, so despite the high cost of these three 20 minute DVDs, I purchased them anyways. The Ab workout really burned, and the Upper Body workout was tough.  But wow, the Lower Body video was killer! Three days later, my butt is still a little bit sore and my quads are really sore and just now recovering (aka I am starting to walk normally again). My quads have been extremely sore for the last two days. I have had difficulty walking, going up and down stairs, and supporting my weight on one leg. (I had to skip my usual yoga practice the day after I did the video.) Let me just repeat--the leg section is hard core.  I've been practing pilates for 5 1/2 years now and have never felt anything like this. I recommend these DVDs for anyone looking to spice up their regular mat pilates routine.",1228780800,14,837,4.358974358974359
