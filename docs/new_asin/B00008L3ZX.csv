1850354,5,B00008L3ZX,"this is a very important movie with great performances about a girl who was kept in isolation for the first 12 years of her life
by her insane parents.  most of the movie is about what happens
to her after she is discovered by the child authorties.  she is
sent from home to home as nobody knows quite how to deal with her
and the sientists also don't know know what to do with her.  i was abused as a child too and this is the best movie i have ever seen about this problem.  the girl is great and the woman who plays her main therapist is also great.  i like most the parts with the therapist and her boyfriend and when they are taking the girl out of the hospital and the butcher who sees the magic in the girl.  also I like the scene on the beach between the therapist and the spooky mother and the end where the mother finally tells why the girl was held prisoner for so many years.  anyone who cares about children should see this movie!!",1051142400,7,944,4.0978260869565215
1850355,4,B00008L3ZX,"First, let me say that the posted product description is terribly misleading.  This is a true story and the young woman referenced did not grow up to be a ""beautiful young woman.""  This is misleading at best.  This young woman was passed from foster care home to foster care home throughout her adolesence, and now remains in an adult foster care home at the age of 52.  I'd hardly call this the success story that the description leads you to believe.

Now, on to the movie.  Actually, I found it well done.  Good acting, realistic, and the plot threads well from segment to segment.  The plight of the young student follows an excellent sub plot.  Well acted, well directed.  I think it is well worth viewing.  However, if you don't have the stomach for horrible abuse of a child, do not watch this.  The opening scenes are shocking - at best.

Finally, for the topic.  All people are children of our God (however you define Him).  We have great worth and value.  Anyone who treats a child like this is a criminal in the worst way.  To top it off, our American system for handling these children is inadequate at best, staffed with generally low paid government officials.  This provides yet another example of how government cannot do the job necessary to ""take care of the people.""  There are other ways, but I will refrain from sharing those here.  I simply pray for all children like this little girl who find themselves in abusive homes.  May they find a way out and eventually become productive, happy members of society.",1285718400,2,1529,4.609665427509293
1850356,4,B00008L3ZX,"This movie brought back some very strong memories as I was going with Susie Curtiss at the time she began working with Genie.  No, the movie is not exactly the true version of events as they were, but the overall impression is correct.  For this reason, and because the subject is such an emotional one, I feel that it is definitely worth seeing.

One thing I do have to say is that Susie Curtiss is the one person who without a doubt was totally sincere in her feelings about Genie and her desire to help her. Susie worked with Genie as an aspiring linguist, but she always had Genie's interests at heart.

Genie's real name by the way is Suzie. In order to eliminate confusion for the young Suzie, Susie Curtiss simply used the name ""Curtiss"", which is how the young Suzie (Genie) referred to her. Simple and to the point, without any pretensions.",1244073600,7,849,4.4935064935064934
1850357,4,B00008L3ZX,"I have this movie on a homemade video tape and I don't know how long I have had it. I have watched my tape a few times over the past 10 years or so and frequently wonder why there was never a follow-up on how Katie (Genie) did after being separated from Ms. Curtis, the only person who seemed to be able to reach her. Katie's childhood was certainly not geared to raising a normal child, chained to a potty chair and fed by an abusive, mentally-ill father who barked at her and a mother going blind from cataracts who did nothing to stop the abuse. One poster called the mother ""spooky"" and I thought that fit her to a Tee. However much the movie's depiction of Katie's abuse and linguists' inability to teach her language, I still wish it had ended with a means viewers could use to find out in later years how Genie was able to survive in our world. I did search the 'net and came up with:

Date:  Tue, 11 Mar 2003 19:48:16 +0000. From:  Sandino L <delfin@garza.uatx.mx>
Subject:  Genie. Thanks to all those who replied to my query (Linguist 14.677) about Genie. I was offered interesting ideas, but most important, I received a mail from Susan Curtiss with up-to-date information about Genie: ""I understand you have asked Prof. Brunetti whether Genie is still alive. She is indeed still alive, lives in a good board-and-care home, and is, I hope, happy and thriving... And keep your fingers crossed. I'm trying to find a way to see her and have some hope that this could happen some time this year.  I've been dreaming of this for years, so if this should happen it would indeed be a dream (more accurately ""many dreams"") come true. Best, Susie Curtiss""

Since that was over five years ago it (if even truthful) does not answer the question Is Genie alive now? I can only hope that if she were to have died, it would have been made known to the public. I also taped the Nova episode on Wild Child and urge viewers of Mockingbird Don't Sing to purchase it as it covers several feral children in different countries and would give them a wider picture of how children came to be feral and to what extent they can be rehabilitated.

Update 3/28/2016: I searched for an update on Genie and Susan Curtis, but Curtis has lost contact with Genie and wiith no success in trying to find her in over a decade there seems to be no way to know of Genie's current situation. If only the two had not been torn apart as they evidently were, we would know. As it is, I doubt we ever will.",1215820800,8,2475,4.379084967320262
1850358,4,B00008L3ZX,"This is one of the most disturbing movies I have ever seen. It documents the abuse a young girl suffered at the hands of first her father and then of the welfare authorities {in this case California's} who are charged with protecting such children.

I think it is beside the point to get bogged down in whether this movie is successful as a artistic creation. And whether it is fully true. The movie's power comes from watching this helpless child being shuttled from one inadequate environment to another.

The young actress who played the child, Katie, was superb in a very difficult role.",1189036800,5,591,4.728155339805825

1850360,3,B00008L3ZX,"Mockingbird Don't Sing (Harry Bromley Davenport, 2001)

This film was, shall we say, something of a surprise. To date, the only other Harry Bromley Davenport film I've been able to track down has been his first, the brilliant, gruesome sci-fi shocker XTRO. Upon finding out he'd done a film about ""Genie,"" the famous feral girl discovered in California in 1970, I expected something quite different than what I got.

Genie (whose name in the film is Katie Standon) spent the first thirteen years of her life being brutally abused by her father, before her mother (played with chilling effectiveness by Better Off Dead's Kim Darby) left him, took her, and went to the social services office looking for welfare benefits. The woman at the desk took one look at the child, called the cops, and the rest is history. The film focuses mostly on what happened after the child was rescued from her initial environment; for a number of years she was in the care of a number of doctors and observers from Childrens Hospital, Los Angeles. The main protagonist in this film is Sandra Tannen, real name Susan Curtiss (played by singer Melissa Errico), a linguistics grad student from UCLA assigned to document Genie's ability to learn language despite having passed what is known in psychology as the critical period; screenwriter Daryl Haney (who, oddly, usually writes softcore movies) and Davenport based the movie around, according to the DVD's liner notes, Curtiss' version of the story.

Therein lies the movie's major failing. Even without reading the liner notes, it's obvious that Curtiss (or Sandra Tannen) is the hero of this piece, the one untarnished person in the child's life. This leads to the story feeling incredibly biased, as well as having the other characters sometimes act in rather bizarre fashion (for example, Darby's character goes from throwing her out of the house one second to launching into a lengthy explanation of her husband's mental state the next, then slips right back into evil-bitch mode once the explication is done). Thus, the very structure of the film itself should be leading the viewer to question the authenticity of the story which, despite being obviously docudrama, is marketed as a true story.

Definitely not Davenport's best work, but an interesting artifact in the world of film. ***",1102982400,7,2324,5.012953367875648
1850361,4,B00008L3ZX,"I am a college student in a introduction to sociology course.  We learned about Genie, who this movie is based on, and everyone in the class was extremely interested in it.  If you are interested in sociology, human development, feral children, or linguistics, this movie is a must see.  While it does come across as a ""made for TV"" movie, that aspect does not take away from its message.",1100044800,7,388,4.594202898550725
1850362,3,B00008L3ZX,"First, a couple technical details which are not included in Amazon's technical details info... the DVD is presented in full screen, although clearly the movie was filmed in widescreen. Surprisingly, although presented in full screen format, the audio is presented in true Dolby Digital 5.1. The audio quality is very good, although there is nothing particularly challenging in the soundtrack content to tax one's system.
That out of the way, I must mention that the overall acting calibre in this film was only a touch above what one would see in a ""made-for-TV"" movie. The story itself is interesting, but the half-hearted acting never let the story get completely off the ground and into your soul. The twenty minute Dr. Susan Curtis interview will completely bore you to tears unless you are an aspiring linguist. If you insist on watching it, at least keep your eyes closed because the doctor is, how to put it kindly... well, more than a bit freaky and weird in appearance and mannerism. I can't comment on the director's commentary, as I did not want to watch the movie a second time with the commentary. Considering the full screen presentation and lackluster acting in conjunction with the high asking price of the DVD, I would have to recommend against purchasing this DVD.",1070755200,12,1282,4.912442396313364

1850364,5,B00008L3ZX,"I was always intrigued about this story so was delighted to see it playing at the Orlando Film Festival.  The film was well written with what must have been a tremendous amount of research.  Despite the small budget and difficult nature of the subject matter, it was very tastefully realized.  The costumes really nailed the era.  It was especially fun to see Sean Young decked out in her period (70's) attire.  Michael Lerner is always a pleasure and the young actress Tara was amazing!

7985196,2,B00008L3ZX,"I was SO excited to find out about this movie so I could show it to my Sociology students, after having talked about Genie Wiley (whom the movie is based on) for a few days.  Boy was my bubble burst.  This was an absolutely horrible movie.  The acting wasn't that bad (although the Genie character was not great), and the story is intriguing, so it's really hard to say what made it so bad.  The only way I can describe it is that they dramatized a documentary.  Documentaries are not movies, I think we all know that.  Documentaries tell a story, as movies do, but they are more of a factual representation of a story, with little flair and no extemporaneous fluff.  Movies can tell the same story but WITH the flair and the fluff, which is what makes them interesting and fun.  This movie seemed to take NOVA's ""Secret of the Wild Child"" documentary and tried to make a movie out of it.  I saw information over and over and over that came straight from the NOVA documentary, so it didn't really play like a movie should, where you meet Genie and see her life progress.  This movie felt disjointed and flat.  It also included a LOT of information about Genie that I don't think was necessarily true (her accomplishments, abilities, etc).  Everything I have ever read about her said she barely could talk, but that's not what is portrayed in the movie. Bottom line... don't waste your time.  Watch the NOVA doc, read some articles, and that'll be enough, I promise.",1462924800,,1465,4.524714828897339

7985200,5,B00008L3ZX,"I must clarify why this review is 5 stars- the rating is mostly for the impact of the story, both as portrayed in the film and the actual events upon which it was derived, with special mention of the performance delivered by Tarra Steele. As several other reviewers have said, the overall quality of the film (to wit: the acting [other than Tarra Steele's], cinematography, and editing/ story construction) is on par with your average made-for-TV movie. Taken purely as an example of the filmmaker's art, this pedestrian effort merits, at best, 3 stars. To be perfectly honest, had I not already been aware of Genie Wiley's story or had this been an entirely fictional screenplay, I likely wouldn't have watched it at all.

That being said, I have watched this film 3 times already this past week, and likely will many more times in years to come. I had already seen the NOVA documentary and read quite a bit of biographical and non-fiction articles about Genie prior to seeing ""Mockingbird""; I found this material quite moving in its own right (Genie's story is near the top of my list of Worst Things I Have Ever Heard Of), but I find I prefer the experience of the 'story' format of this film as it allowed me to relate to Genie's story in a more strongly emotional way. This is probably most directly attributable to Tarra Steele's performance as Katie/ Genie.

Due to that, Katie is the most compelling character in this piece, as it should be. While Sandra Tannen is clearly the 'protagonist' of this film (being based, apparently, significantly on Susan Curtiss' account of the events portrayed), it is nonetheless Katie's story. The beginning of the film, which gives us a glimpse of the horrible isolation, neglect, and abuse Katie endured until she was 13  was very difficult to watch, such is the extent of the emotional distress Tarra conveys merely through facial expression and body language. Later on in the film, we see Katie reliving a memory as Sandra plays the piano for her; the depth of abject misery and utter boredom Tarra displays on her face just before the flashback cuts back to the present is incredible to behold. I was quite disappointed to find IMDB shows no further credits for her after this movie.

However, I must also add, Tarra's portrayal of Katie's difficulty with speaking is sometimes a bit inconsistent. In most scenes, she does an excellent job of delivering her dialogue in the manner one might expect of a 14-year old girl who is just learning to talk, but in a few places she delivers her lines just like (apart from the simplistic or improper sentence structure) the normal 10- or 11-year old she actually was during production. One might attribute this to the film trying to depict Katie as having gained more skill in speaking/ enunciating... except other lines in the same scene are delivered in the expected childlike manner. Perhaps this is a feature of the way movies are typically shot out of sequence. My guess would be the scenes in question were maybe shot earlier in production, before Tarra had fully gotten a handle on portraying her character.

If you are intending to acquire this film for viewing, I would urge you to purchase it through Amazon Instant, but it currently shows to be ""unavailable"" through Instant. What's up with that, Amazon? As it is, think carefully before spending the somewhat steep asking price of the DVD.",1374624000,2,3391,4.779863481228669

7985202,2,B00008L3ZX,"This movie sounded interesting, so I decided to watch. First off, Amazon says this movie was released in 2007--- it looks more like 1977.

It pulls you in and the entire movie you are waiting for that happy ending, or at least a resolution of some kind. Well, no. That is not what this movie gives you.
