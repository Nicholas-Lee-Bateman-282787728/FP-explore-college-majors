5119292,5,B0081STCMA,"Figurative Watercolours DVD. Charles Reid only does 3 portraits, but he is a wonderful teacher. Now I want more of his Watercolours portraits for his next DVD.",1388793600,,159,4.925925925925926
5119293,3,B0081STCMA,"Charles Reid shows you a nice instruction on watercolor. I wish production showed a split screen of the model and Mr. Reid painting once in a while. The thing that ruined the video was that, EVERY TIME Mr. Reid stopped talking, he had a habit of doing a partial whistle. This was distracting and annoying!",1378857600,,305,4.5636363636363635
5119294,5,B0081STCMA,"I love this DVD because it is packed with wonderful information on tech., equipment, and insight.
There is nothing not to like about this DVD.
I would recommend it to anyone wanting to grow in their skill in watercolor.",1370390400,6,219,4.641025641025641
5119295,5,B0081STCMA,"I'm a big fan of Charles Reid - his work and his instruction.  I own several of his dvds and most of his books.  I love this dvd because it shows his brushwork extensively, great filming technique, and Charles reflects on his career, giving us a personal glimpse into his past.  I am buying a second copy for a friend.  She will love it too!",1362614400,3,341,4.2
5119296,5,B0081STCMA,If you like to learn about painting there is no one better to watch than this guy.  He explains why he does things and he is also clear about what you shouldn't do which I found refreshing.  I highly recommend this wonderful DVD.  It is a high quality professional product for serious painters. But for a beginner who wants to paint portraits  it asks a lot of you.  In my way of thinking you never get better if you don't stretch and reach higher than you think you can.  I say GO FOR IT!!,1359849600,4,490,4.159574468085107
5119297,5,B0081STCMA,"I liked the approach to his creation of the watercolor figures, color mixing choices and the selection of colors for the composition",1357862400,3,132,5.045454545454546
5119298,5,B0081STCMA,"This DVD is awesome. Charles shows us how to paint like a master in this DVD, great instruction. He takes you through his process from beginning to end. His contour drawing capabilities are fantastic but his use of color as value is inspiring. Not to mention his use of fresh color. How he uses the paint he applies is so important as well as his brush work. If you like Charles's style of painting portraits I would highly recommend this DVD. This is great instruction from a master painter indeed.",1352246400,8,499,4.555555555555555

8524139,5,B0081STCMA,The portrait painting in watercolor teacher who I follow seem to all have Charles Reid in their background.  This is a good video to watch if you are trying to loosen up on painting faces.,1428278400,,188,4.371428571428571
8524140,5,B0081STCMA,One of my favorite DVDS of this artist.,1425340800,,39,4.0
8524141,5,B0081STCMA,"I own several Charles Reid watercolor videos and books. I believe this video and the Watercolor Secrets video are the best for portraits and figures, respectively. In each case, I find myself going back to watch again and again. Charles Reid provides excellent instruction. The more you watch, the more subtleties you will notice in his actions. In this video, he demonstrates three portraits ( a girl and a man with a beard) which begin with his contour drawing of each. Reid talks about his palette and demonstrates mixing skin tones which he accomplishes partially on palette or on paper. In this video he uses negative shapes, builds contrast and employs small glazes for subtle tone changes.",1416096000,3,696,4.957264957264957
8524142,5,B0081STCMA,"Another excellent Charles Reid DVD.  If you like his work, this will be a great addition to your DVD library.",1413676800,,109,4.45
8524143,5,B0081STCMA,The method he uses to paint portraits is a tad different that his still life and landscape.  Remarkable!  I will watch this many times.,1400889600,2,135,4.583333333333333
