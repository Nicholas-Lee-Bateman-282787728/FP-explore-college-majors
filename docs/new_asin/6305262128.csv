Not a hit movie for some reason & not the best film ever made, but it is funny, Robin Williams doing his thing.  Just ordered the DVD.  I can finally watch it wide screen at home.",1061942400,6,263,4.0

1004330,4,6305262128,"When a 35 Year Old Business Man (Robin Williams) wonders if his life could change, if he catch the Football in his high-school years with His Best Friend (Kurt Russell). He Proves to his Father in Law (Donald Moffat), that he could Shape Up, the old High-School and the Another High-School Team to Replay the game, one more time to Prove, who are the Best Team for the Best of Times.
Directed by Roger Spottiswoode (Stop! or my Mom will Shoot) made a fine comedy about Rediscoving and thier Second-Coming of Age to be a True Adult. Likeable Performances by Williams and Russell high-light this one. Written by Ron Shelton (Bull Durham, Cobb). Grade:B+.",1015113600,4,652,4.728070175438597
1004331,5,6305262128,"I guess I first caught this movie on Cinemax or some other cable channel back in '87 or '88(?) while still in High School.  I've watched it at least once a year (around September usually) ever since.  A ""Sleeper"" I suppose, but a sleeper at it's finest.  In my opinion one of Williams' best, up there with ""World according to Garp"" and ""Moscow on the Hudson"".  Kurt is perfectly cast as a former high school GOD turned beerbellied, blown out kneed ""Van Specialist"" desperately trying not to bathe in past glory.  It has that ""quirky and delightful"" feel, not unlike Bill Forsyth's films like ""Local Hero"" and ""Gregory's Girl"".  Now that I think of it, ""Mystery Alaska"" wouldn't be a bad comparison either.  It goes way beyond simply a football/sports movie (my Wife likes it too but probably just because of Kurt Russell) but hey, I love football anyway so it it works for me on multiple levels.  Of course, the idea of going back and correcting one's biggest screw up/regret would appeal to anyone.  I always feel good after I watch this one, it hasn't let me down yet.",996192000,37,1070,4.589473684210526
1004332,5,6305262128,This is a great movie for anyone who has botched something and never had the chance for redemption.  Jack drops what would have been a winning touchdown pass against his arch-rival and takes it upon himself to rewrite history.  Robin Williams and Kurt Russell are great as best friends whose fortunes have changed since their high school football days.  There is even a small role by a very young Kirk Cameron.,980467200,3,410,4.746478873239437

1004668,4,6305262128,"This review is an excerpt from my book ""Killer B's: The 237 Best Movies On Video You've (Probably) Never Seen,"" which is available as an ebook on Amazon. If you enjoy this review, there are 236 more like it in the book (plus a whole lot more). Check it out!

THE BEST OF TIMES: It's not about football, really. It's about the war--or the game--between men and women. No screenwriter alive understands the jock mentality better than Shelton, and few understand women as well either. Does Jack catch the ball? Let me say this: It just doesn't matter. The game, the play, even the original fumble, are merely focal points: catalysts for the change these lovable lethargics desperately need. And that outcome could occur in either case.

This sprightly, insightful and ultimately uplifting fable about how one neurotic's obsession can become a dream that inspires an entire town uses football as a metaphor for love, life, and spiritual redemption. Whether Jack grabs that ball or not, he grabs his own life by the balls--and by pursuing his own wacky dream, he changes the lives of everyone in Taft. And as a bonus, in the women's dressing room scene, we get an honest answer to the question, ""What do men want?""",1421798400,,1209,4.752380952380952

1004749,4,6305262128,"This is a good film that makes for a good night's viewing. It is especially enjoyable if you like tales about small towns and their football teams. The same people have stayed in the small town where they went to high school. The town is in the doldrums and so are our characters as they have never recovered from a losing football game so many years ago. One of these guys is married to the homecoming queen and the other to the richest man in town's daughter.  Both wives are exasperated by their husbands.

The solution? Replay the football game. So that is what the rest of the movie is about. It is very sweet, nostalgic and heartfelt. Although Williams has comedic moments that is not his main role here. He has little comedic skits but the focus of the movie is on Russell and him redoing that football game. If you are a football fan, this may be five stars for you. I am not so it is four stars for me.

1004809,3,6305262128,"Who doesn't have something in their past they wish they could go back and do over? In THE BEST OF TIMES, Jack Dundee (Robin Williams) has been known in Taft as the ""guy who dropped the ball"" in a high school football game 13 years ago. But honestly, he isn't the only one in that small town who longs for the glory days. With him is Reno Hightower (Kurt Russell), the town's star quarterback who now runs a car repair shop. And to complicate things further, both of them are having marital issues, some of which stem from Jack's insistence at not letting go of the past. The whole story is quite a mess, with some scenes leading nowhere, and others being cringe-inducing in their reliance on cliche. Still, there are a couple of scenes which stood out as being particularly good. First, there is a dinner scene between Jack, Reno, and their wives which reminded me of a similar scene in Mrs. Doubtfire. Also, the climactic game was well-done, even if the way it ends is a foregone conclusion before the film really even starts. Full disclosure: I'm not much of a football fan (or sports, for that matter). However, I can appreciate a good sports movie when I see one. This isn't one of those movies. As a comedy, it's adequate and Robin Williams does give a good comic performance as a put-upon man with some unresolved personal issues regarding his past. Kurt Russell also does a nice job as the straight man, but the chemistry between him and Williams isn't as good as one would expect. Still, both of them do the best with the material they were given. Ultimately, I like to think of this movie as not really being about high school football. It works better as a feel-good comedy about wish-fulfillment and fixing past mistakes. On that level, I think the film can be enjoyed. Overall, this isn't particularly essential viewing but should prove a decent diversion for Robin Williams or sports fans.",1410048000,3,1902,4.613569321533923

The Best of Times is a fun movie for football fans or anyone who has grown up with a friendly sports rivalry with a neighboring school.

1004881,5,6305262128,"This is Robin Williams' best movie, at least in my book.  It's also my favorite football movie. ""I bet they're drawing up plays in the dirt.""  Yeah I remember doing that.  Yet the scene that tugs permanently at my heart is the reunion dance the night before the big game, when Robin Williams' character convinces his wife, who is still mad at him for sneaking away from a long-awaited date night to watch a meaningless Monday night football game on tv when he had promised not to, to dance with him in the ladies' restroom at their old high school, to Roberta Flack's ""The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face.""  Tomorrow, he says, we may get our asses kicked to kingdom come; but tonight, it would be really nice, if you would dance with me.  If you can watch that scene and not break down, or ever hear that song and not think of that scene, you're a stronger man than me.  I am writing this today, so sad, and disappointed the Times didn't even mention this flick in its obit.  It's a movie about football the way Bull Durham is about baseball.  It's about love and redemption and second chances.  It's one of the few movies I cannot turn off whenever the remote control finds it.  And has Kurt Russell ever been better than as Reno Hightower?  I hope that somewhere in heaven, Robin Williams is getting the second chance his character Jack Dundee was given in this movie.  He's due.",1407715200,7,1381,4.41501976284585

I was surrounded by incredibly overweight and out of shape middle-aged men who were all chanting at me as I lay on a stage in a Tiger outfit. I ran off the stage and asked someone what the hell was going on and they explained I'd managed to gather the entire 1986 Taft HS football team together in a single night, but the guy couldn't explain how I'd done it. I look behind me and there's this Ambien mascot waving his hands down like ""shhh, calm down"". He kept doing it until I got sleepier and sleepier, and finally laid back down. I woke up in my room.

Robin Williams is very good as the failure obsessed with making his life turn out the way it should have, could have, and would have if only he had not dropped the football, but caught it.  Kurt Russell, my favorite living actor, never gave any less than a good performance and this is one of his smartest and most inspiring roles.  I love his compassion and caring in dealing with Williams' dumb ideas and nonsense.  When he decides in the final huddle to throw the last pass of the game to his buddy, you can see that Russell really loves his friend and hopes the hopeless, that this time, Williams will snatch this second chance to prove himself.

1005040,5,6305262128,"""Best of Times"" is really less about football, and more about the theme of redemption.  Robin Williams plays a manic bank manager traumatized by a dropped pass 13 years previous.  He is haunted by this failure, and is made to feel defined by it through himself, his father-in-law, and even the small-town populace who still remark on the 13 year-old loss.  After having one of his panic attacks related to ""the Game"" (as he terms it), a helpful prostitute (yes, that's right) suggested he replay the game.  An epiphany, Williams' character, Jack Dundee, sets about a quest; but not to merely replay the game.  Rather, his goal is purely to redeem himself as a failure.  Unfortunately for Dundee, the high school quarterback phenomenon from that team, Reno Hightower (Russell) is less enthusiastic about replaying the game.  Unlike Jack, Reno absolves his dead-end ""van specialist"" job with the ever-escalating stories about his greatness:  ""Hell, I'm afraid to throw a beer can in a trash can, because someone will say ""hey, Reno, losin' your touch?'""  As much as Jack is haunted by this past, Reno subsists on it.  In both cases, of course, neither is being served by it.  For entirely opposite reasons, both characters must somehow get the game behind them before they can move on.  Fortunately, the film subtly exposes the fact that it is only Dundee who is openly aware of it. Jack eventually blackmails Reno into throwing in his support, and convinces both towns to replay the 13 year old game.  But, it isn't only Reno who doesn't want the game replayed.  Hightower's wife is frustrated by her own efforts to reclaim her youthful greatness in high school and transfer it to a contemporary performance stage, and Jack's wife was mortified at the prospect of having to pick up the pieces from her already tortured husband's psyche if he drops the ball again.  A little more examination of both these women's characters would have been interesting - but with four major protagonists and an inherent screen time limit, some trimming was inevitable.  Still, the script, directing and acting effectively conveyed these women's internal conflicts.  An important subplot involved another Taft, California athletic failure who Jack nor anyone else in the town seems to know about.  I won't spoil this small but important plot element, but suffice it to say that you should really pay attention to the seemingly non-sequitor introduction prefatory and the subtle focus given to an old man at the end of the film.  This film is extraordinary in its examination of redemption.  Each character was in need of making up for something - however, it was only the neurotic Jack Dundee who seemed to be self-conscious about it.  Reno Hightower needed to break away from his dramatic, but long-passed legendary gridiron exploits in order to grow as a person in real life.  The same could be said for his wife, albeit in a different venue.  Even Jack Dundee's wife needed to let go of her husband's self-flagellating retrospective behavior - something she could not do without Jack proving to himself he could accomplish it.  Even the town of Taft, California reinvigorated itself from the quiet desperation of a remote industrial town.  The setting is sports, but the theme is entirely centered on the human condition of redemption.  This is a comedy, and an effective one at that.  But, it is really its message that is more memorable.  I was inspired by the movie's climatic football game.  But, it wasn't the operation of the football spectacle that I found moving.  Rather, it was the way the scene nicely tied up a clever commentary on perceived flaws versus the actual state of the human condition.",1245024000,6,3691,4.925566343042071

1005046,4,6305262128,"THE BEST OF TIMES is a typical football story, where the underdog wins the game. In THE BEST OF TIMES, the underdog is a collection of out-of-shape, out-of-practice middle-aged men who prepare for a re-match, a football game against their better-prepared counterparts from across the highway. In this film, the underdogs are from Taft, California, a real town that still has a functioning oil well industry.  The better prepared team is from Bakersfield, a major city in California.

During the re-match of the football game, the underdogs begin by playing poorly. But the team's abilities improve after a sudden thunderstorm douses the field and changes it to mud. The change appears due to the fact that their star player, Reno Hightower, joins the team.

Most of the time spent in THE BEST OF TIMES is devoted to Robin Williams' efforts in convincing the people of Taft that a high school football game, from some 15 years back, should be re-played with the original players, most of them tubby in their middle age. In order to convince the townsfolk to agree for a re-match of the football game, Robin Williams secretly paints inflammatory graffiti in an effort to stir up the emotions of the townsfolk of Taft.

This film contains excellent images from Taft, California. The film begins with an excellent narrative of the early history of Taft. Recently (April 2006), I discovered Taft, and visited the Oil Museum, and generally enjoyed the intriguing aesthetics of the hundreds of bobbing oil wells found in the area. The Oil Museum has a tiny gift shop, with mugs, featuring a black drawing of a wooden oil well structure. The film lovingly features the bobbing oil wells as a backdrop for much of the acting.

LOCAL COLOR.  THE BEST OF TIMES dwells lovingly on the local color of the town, for example, on employees in an auto repair shop, members of a men's club (Caribou Club) busy with one of their meetings, amateur female singers in a lounge, and a high school dance.  All of these local color scenes are convincing and are a genuine representation of activities that occur occur thousands of times each day, in the United States of America.

COMEDY.  A fair number of clever sight gags enliven the plot. For example, Robin Williams plays a bank worker. But the bank president teases him for making his high school team lose an important game, years earlier. The bank president teases him by taking off his cowboy hat, tossing it around and fumbling with it, as though it was the football that Robin Williams had dropped. Another sight gag consists of Robin Williams driving a broken-down loaner automobile. While coming to a halt, he crashes it into a low brick wall, making the bricks scatter about. (Nothing else is made of this accident. It is just a quick sight gag that comes and goes.) Another amusing part occurs during the football game, where a member of the opposing team is a former convict who calls himself, ""DOCTOR DEATH.""

CRITIQUE.  The film suffers from its periodic bad language. Once might be enough. But the bad language in this film continues, again and again and again and again and again. Isn't there a bowdlerized version of this movie that can be shown to kids? Also, I really didn't like the bedroom scene with Robin Williams and his wife getting undressed together. These scenes make the movie inappropriate for kids. Also, Robin Williams is too hairy.  The film did very poorly at the box office, despite having two of the highest profile A-list male actors in America, and despite being a sports movie. While I am not much of a movie-goer, here is my layperson's opinion. The dinner scene was not very good. The script for this particular part of the movie was terrible. The script for the dinner scene, where two couples are attempting to reconcile, should have been tossed out and re-written. The script was intended to show two married couples, who are not comfortable with each other. Woody Allen has done better writing for this type of situation.  Another problem was the bedroom scene with Holly Palance. The bedroom scene was not convincing. One problem here was that Holly Palance is completely lacking in ta-tas. To repeat, if a movie is going to include a bedroom scene where the female love interest is wearing a thin negligee, the director should take care to avoid using an actress totally lacking in you-know-what. The fact that Holly Palance totally lacks any you-know-what caused this particular love scene to be a bit weird. A better tactic might have been to leave out this particular love scene. This scene did not click.

CONCLUSION.  This film is a must for fans of California history. Taft played an important role in California's oil industry. The film is yet another great example of a sports movie where the underdogs prevail at the end. But for those interested in sports movies about underdogs, there are some better choices, for example, RUDY (football), MIRACLE (ice hockey also featuring Kurt Russell), THE ROOKIE (baseball), and HOOSIERS (basketball).  If you find yourself traveling along the vast wasteland of a journey, along Route 5, from Los Angeles,CA to Sacramento, CA, I would emphatically recommend stopping to see the oil well museum in Taft, CA, and then picking up a copy of THE BEST OF TIMES, in order to view your vacation spot.",1147132800,,5317,4.8392070484581495

I have never liked Robin or Kurt that much, but I liked this film because it is likeable, minus all the profanity and other tactless nonsense included in this film. The storyline was the most acceptable part. I purchased this DVD about a year ago, and as soon as I finished watching this film, two things occurred to me. A) This film does present itself in an oddly, almost irreverently comedic tone and B)The Best of Times, though certainly interesting, should not have recieved the acclaim that many people gave it. It was never a critics choice, however, and rightly not, because it is at best a B- kind of thing. It is, however, worth checking out because it's a Sunday night classic.

Reno Hightower (played by Kurt Russel) was the quaterback, the only good quaterback the town ever had, who threw him that pass.

7886786,5,6305262128,"Generally, I don't like to watch a video more than once.  But, I have watched this movie multiple times and own copies in DVD and digital.  There's sports, romance, comedy, and drama.  So, this movie strikes a great general cord for the young, old, male, female, football, or band.  To make it short, a high school third string receiver drops a critical pass producing a tie game which comes to define his life.  Years later, he seeks to redeem himself by convincing both towns to replay the game with the original players. The towns agree but not everyone is onboard affecting relationships far and wide.  Eventually, it comes down to some exciting underdog football scenes.  There's some swearing, but otherwise nothing much beyond PG.  This is not the best movie you'll ever see by any means, but it is a fun, entertaining romp with wide appeal.",1508630400,,848,4.760273972602739
