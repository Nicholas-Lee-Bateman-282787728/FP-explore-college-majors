Edmond O'Brien is on the beat as a ""prowl car cop"" with his partner.  It starts out good then delves into personal relationships and avoids anymore gritty noir.  There's a decent car chase scene, some bad script continuity like the cops finding the car that shot up one of the main cop protagonists with ease and no stand out villains (think Lee Van Cleef in Kansas City Confidential (1952), Neville Brand in D.O.A. (1950) or The Mob (1951), William Conrad in The Killers (1946) and Richard Widmark in Kiss of Death (1947).)

The ending is ridiculous as well, since one lousy main bad guy (Donald Buka) takes a young girl hostage and one hundred cops show up with searchlights.

Edmond O'Brien is his usual big-mouthed self, annoying us plenty; he's better as a villain.

Still, worth a look for the old city view (Pacific Electric Building, Los Angeles, California (1905)) and lovely Black and White Film.

City That Never Sleeps (1953), a Republic Pictures noir with Gig Young as a prowl car cop on the beat, is a lot better.

8665161,2,B00LC9AB0W,"Between Midnight and Dawn is a 1950 crime drama that centers on two LA policemen (Mark Stevens, Edmond OBrien) and their quest to capture a gangster (Donald Buka). Police dramas were particularly popular in the early 50s and often involved film noir elements, though this one doesnt.

Edmond OBrien (1915-85) does his usual good job as a tough (and sometimes brutal) LA policeman, but its not up to his excellent performances as the passionate insurance investigator  in film noir classic The Killers (1946), the grizzled Freddy Sykes in The Wild Bunch (1969), Oscar Muldoon in The Barefoot Contessa (1954), the fiery Senator in Seven Days in May (1962), and the newspaper publisher in The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance (1962). He won the Oscar and the Golden Globe for Barefoot Contessa and was nominated for Seven Days in May.

Mark Stevens (1916-94) gave many excellent supporting performances in films like God is my Co-Pilot (1945), The Snake Pit (1948) and starred in several B thrillers like The Street with No Name (1948) and Cry Vengeance (1954).

Donald Buka (1920-2009) made a few films in the 40s and 50s and then transitioned to TV. Hes not very convincing as a hoodlum.

Gale Storm (1922-2009) is the woman that OBrien and Stevens go after. Shes best known for My Little Margie (1952-55) and The Gale Storm Show (1956-60). She does an adequate job here, but her strength was in comedy.

Look for James Brown (1920-92) as a policeman. Brown went on to fame as the co-star of TVs Rin Tin Tin (1954-59) and later Dallas (1979-88) as Detective Harry McSween.

The films director, Gordon Douglas (1907-93) started his career with comedies (Laurel and Hardy, Our Gang) but transitioned to crime (Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye, I was a Communist for the FBI, The Detective) and westerns (The Great Missouri Raid, The Iron Mistress)when he moved to Warner Brothers. Hes probably best known for the 1954 sci fi classic Them. He keeps the action flowing pretty well, although the story itself is a little too predictable.

1950 was a good year for films with Oscars for All About Eve (Picture, Director, Supporting Actor), Cyrano (Actor) and Born yesterday (Actress).  The top grossers included Cinderella, King Solomons Mines, Annie Get Your Gun and Sunset Boulevard. Other notable films released in 1950 were  The Asphalt Jungle, Cheaper by the Dozen, The Glass Menagerie, Rashomon, The Third Man, and Twelve Oclock High.

Some of the better police dramas from the 50s include Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye (1950), Where the Sidewalk Ends (1950), Detective Story (1951), The Big Heat (1953), The Big Combo (1955), The Phenix City Story (1955), and Touch of Evil (1958).

Bottom line  a forgettable film from the 50s.",1440201600,2,2705,4.957964601769912
