2378535,5,B000A7Q26Y,"Oswald is such a breath of fresh air. I adore the quirkiness of Oswald's world, all the characters have character(hee, hee), and the plots relate to situations that young ones encounter in life. And the price- trust me, it's great- I had to stop myself from doing a cartwheel in a cluttered living room. Thanks!",1143504000,3,311,4.672727272727273
2378536,5,B000A7Q26Y,This ws exactly what we had been looking for.  Not only was it  great deal but both dvd's worked correctly and we received the item before it was due to arrive.  I was very pleased and will order other things in the future.,1142294400,,223,4.1395348837209305

2378549,5,B000A7Q26Y,"I purchased this for my granddaughter (oldest) as her younger sister is going to turn one and will get all of the attention and presents. which were previosly all my older granddaughters.  Maybe Oswald will make it up just a little, because she is only four years old! Thank you Amazon!!!!!!!",1341446400,,292,4.7254901960784315
2378550,5,B000A7Q26Y,My son loves the show very hard to find in stores. Its very educational. I would definitely buy more movies for my son,1339459200,,118,4.173913043478261

2378552,4,B000A7Q26Y,"My whole family have enjoyed Oswald for a long time, now. Unfortunately it doesn't appear anywhere on Nickelodeon anymore, as far as we can tell.

Now that we've come to this point, we only have these DVDs to pull out on a rainy day. They have some of our most favorite stories. The only disappointment is that, as is all too common with cartoon shows, this is an incomplete set. We would love to have the whole series, but have to settle for only one scoop of Swizzleberry Swirl. Still a must for fans, though.",1334793600,,511,4.378947368421053
2378553,5,B000A7Q26Y,Received movies in no time.  My child is soo happy.  What a great wholesome wonderful show for small ones.  Thanks!,1331596800,,115,4.65
2378554,5,B000A7Q26Y,"Oswald is very polite even when his friends aren't. I would still give this five stars even though his friends Henry and Daisy don't truly take the blame for their part in things that go wrong. That can be the part the parents point out. Also the parents can point out the fact that penguins don't come from the ""Frozen North"". Oswald is very lovable looking and pleases my 1-year-old baby. She smiles as if seeing an old friend when I put this on.",1307404800,,448,4.345238095238095
2378555,5,B000A7Q26Y,"Me and my 3yr old son love this show! They always cancel the good ones. Its such a soothing mellow show with no annoying characters or obnoxious music.  Fred Savage does the main character and really does well.  Buy it for your 3 year old or any child under 10 i would say.

DVD works great. Thanks.",1307145600,,299,4.2105263157894735
2378556,5,B000A7Q26Y,"Oswald is the most gentle, thoughtful,smart, polite, peaceful and full of wisdom character invented. Oswald with his dog and friends make a team that demonstrates to children and adults how to be right minded in a variety of complex situations. I highly recommend Oswald to anyone.",1295481600,,281,5.130434782608695
2378557,5,B000A7Q26Y,"My daughter loves Oswald. Because he has been around for several years, it is very difficult to find items related to him. These dvd's have been a lifesaver!",1293148800,,157,4.642857142857143
2378575,5,B000A7Q26Y,My son loves Oswald and the DVD set has all of his favorities. He enjoys watching Oswald in the mornings and This seems to be a nice transition for the rest of the day.,1280793600,,168,3.9705882352941178

Thanks for the great price though!",1254528000,,160,4.333333333333333
2378579,5,B000A7Q26Y,"My Son loved Oswald on Noggin so much that everything stopped at 11am to watch this show.  When Noggin stop showing the show except on weekends we had to do something.  Now we still let him have his favorite Octopus, penguin and flower every day.

I would suggest this for anyone who hates the loud, frantic preschool cartoons like Dora.  This is a gentle, kind, soft spoken cartoon that teaches children to be good to each other.",1249689600,,430,4.545454545454546
2378580,5,B000A7Q26Y,These were a wonderful gift for my daughter's 3rd birthday. She has already watched them both and loves them!,1238544000,,109,4.7894736842105265
2378581,5,B000A7Q26Y,My 2 1/2 year old son loves Oswald. It's a very calm cartoon. We can watch it right before he goes to bed and it will calm him down from being excited and running around.,1233532800,,170,3.8857142857142857

2378583,5,B000A7Q26Y,My little kids just love Oswald (ages 2 & 4).  My 2 year old can't get enough of him.  They got the DVDs for Xmas so we had them for our long 8 hour drive to their Grandparent's house.  Oswald is very relaxing and the characters are all very interesting.  Fun!  I'm glad this was sold in a 2 pack.  More for your money.,1231200000,,319,3.90625
2378584,5,B000A7Q26Y,"the picture and colour is great. not quick animations. just what little kids need. a cute world, cute positiv stories. If you have little kids, I can only encourage you to get those dvds",1226966400,,186,4.5
2378595,5,B000A7Q26Y,My daughter loves Oswald. It is so hard to find on DVD. So it's nice to know that she can enjoy it.,1226966400,,99,3.5454545454545454
2378596,5,B000A7Q26Y,"My girls LOVE Oswald, so this was great for us.  And as always Amazon shipped it out and we got within days of ordering it.",1222214400,,123,3.92
2378597,5,B000A7Q26Y,"Oswald the world's favourite octopus! I have all the Oswald dvds, which are two region 1 dvds, and two region 2 dvds. I watched the region 2 first (living in the UK) and then purchased the two region 1 dvds and was very surprised to find that they have used American accents on the region 1, and then I realised it's because they were made that way to begin with and for the region 2 releases they have used British accents. Henry the Penguin sounds slightly more refined with his British accent and a little gangsterish with the American one, but it is not at all off-putting and one soon gets used to it. I don't know why they put out different stories for different countries and with different voices, - though oddly enough, the egg twins sound the same on both regions. Presumably all Oswald's stories where originally made with American voices so it seems odd that only some stories are available on region 1 and others only on region 2 with British voices dubbed over the originals. I wonder why they did that? It's quirky to be able to compare both. It looks as though the stories on the region 1 dvds and the stories on the region 2 dvds are not available in the other region, that is, if you want to see the story where Oswald makes the birthday cake, or the one where his tap springs a leak, you only have the option to see them on the region 2 discs, and if you want to see the hilarious story where Henry's cousin comes to stay, or where Oswald tries to watch tv with Henry and at the same time use the swimpool in the garden with Daisy, you will only be able to see those stories on the region 1 dvds, so you will need a multi region player to watch them all on, (Who hasn't got one?! LOL). Maybe they will eventually put out all the stories with a choice of the British or American voices. I would get them all, even though I already have them, as it would be interesting to see the same stories done with the different voices and compare them.
Oswald is a gem. Such nice gentle stories, the colours in pastel shades, gentle music, nothing harsh or loud and noisy or jarring. Just wonderful really! Why aren't they making more episodes? Someone please!",1211846400,4,2167,4.3399014778325125
2378598,5,B000A7Q26Y,"I try not to let my kids (2 & 4) watch much TV, but when we do, it's Sesame Street, Mr. Rogers, or Oswald.  This is a wonderful little show, very, very well done.  It's a sweet, slow pace, not frantic like some other cartoons, and the moral themes of the show (it's more fun if we all share, help your friends and they will help you, sometimes things get broken but you can say your sorry) never feel forced.  The voice talent is excellent, and I love that there is a recognizable diversity in the voices.  Johnny Snowman sounds like an African American man, without this being pointed out or made a token of in any way.  It's just the way it is in Oswald's world, as is every inhabitant being a different species.  The characters reflect the moods we all have on different days, and kids especially struggle with (sweetly but overly-exuberant Daisy, borderline obsessive-compulsive Henry, shy Pongo).  The music is especially wonderful, again in contrast to many  animated series.  It is real, orchestral instruments, playing simple yet musical melodies, and Oswald sings along about whatever he is dealing with in that episode, showing how kids can incorporate music into their own daily lives.  There is just enough humor for older kids and parents to keep it lively, but never interfereing with the sincerity of the show.  (The ""white elephant"" joke cracks me up every time.)  Also, there is no merchandising onslaught, which is so rare.
Beautiful, beautiful show.  We'd love to see all episodes released on DVD.  We love these, but our favorites, like the Pet Show and Going Fishing, are not on these.",1208476800,8,1606,4.750902527075812
2378599,5,B000A7Q26Y,"Back when Oswald was being aired my son didn't care for the show, though I thought it was a cuter and less annoying kids show. Now, he loves the show!

I bought him this double pack and it is really worth the money. I was afraid, when I got it, that they'd be some condensed versions of the dvds but no, they are the same dvds that are also sold separately. If your kid loves Oswald, this is the set to get.

I have to order new copies though. My son got a hold of them and they are no longer usable.",1206489600,,500,3.892156862745098
2378600,5,B000A7Q26Y,My daughter LOVES Oswald!!!  The characters are so unique and the stories are very calming and they send positive messages.  I wish they were still making this cartoon.,1204588800,,168,4.964285714285714
2378601,5,B000A7Q26Y,"I love all the Oswalds and so do all of my children, ages from 4 through 9. My younger ones love the idioms all the characters blurt out through the story lines and my older children grasp the wonderful idiosyncracies of the different personalities of the Oswald world. You can't help but think of all the same silly quirks that friends that are both annoying and endearing at the same time. It's fun to see which one of those personalities you might actually be closest to in the Oswald show. Sometimes I'll overhear the show while I'm getting my coffee (well, okay, I've actually watched most of it several times and get entranced by the great little ditties that Oswald sing-songs at least once per episode. The words are always very contemplative. Even though the younger children seem indifferent about the ditties, I think that's the best part of Oswald. I wonder who actually wrote those?",1190160000,,895,4.743589743589744

2378603,5,B000A7Q26Y,The Oswald On the Go and the Oswald Welcome to Big City videos are calming and full of good character messages.

 It's a little slower paced so it doesn't have all the fast movements of a lot of the cartoons today.  Plus for us adults, it's Fred Savage that does the voice of Oswald. ;)",1462924800,,321,3.984375
