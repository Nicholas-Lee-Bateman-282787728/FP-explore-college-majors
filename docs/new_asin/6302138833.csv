7821615,3,6302138833,"The best James Taylor Concert Video to date. However, it is missing some songs from the originally aired PBS showing.

This one has all the real warmth of J.T.

Can we get to see the unedited version on DVD 5.1 Surround ?",1101254400,2,221,4.238095238095238
7821616,4,6302138833,"This is his greatest concert (IMHO)!  The only problem is...it's missing some key songs that appeared on the PBS version.  The continuity has been hacked by the way this one has been edited.  It just doesn't flow like the original.
CAN WE PLEASE GET AN UN-EDITED DVD VERSION???
Here's a concert you could automatically re-sale to all the James Taylor fans that want the entire concert!!!",1088812800,3,387,4.833333333333333
7821617,3,6302138833,"when i first saw this concert on PBS13, i enjoyed it much more then the pre-recorded video i purchased. it's missing many songs like, ""Sweet potato pie"", ""Mexico"", & many others from the  ""Never die young"" album. they should launch the original concert  on DVD for us to see all the songs without interruption.",939945600,13,310,4.722222222222222
7821618,4,6302138833,"I have a copy of this concert I taped from PBS years ago. My VCR was not a HI FI unit when I made the recording. So I purchased this concert video that was recorded in Boston. It sounds great in HI FI stereo. It is the  same concert but this video tape is missing most all the songs from the  ""Never Die Young"" album. My copy from PBS has many more songs on  it. Why the difference?

7821619,4,6302138833,"It's great except for one thing;  It's not in 1979 it's 1988.  Any JT fan or anybody who can use logic will tell you that in 1979 JT had a mustache, he had more hair, and the albums 'that's why I'm here' and 'Never die  young' weren't out yet. On top of that in 79 he was filmed in the Blossom  Music Center in Ohio, not Boston.",929318400,9,328,3.8507462686567164
