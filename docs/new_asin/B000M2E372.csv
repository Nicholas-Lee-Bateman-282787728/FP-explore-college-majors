2718065,4,B000M2E372,"Luke has a problem.  He met a beautiful girl, who seems to be very

much interested in him as well.  But when starts to get sexually

aroused by her, he starts to turn into a woman.  (Say, what?)

You see, Luke is a victim of ""Zerophilia"" (2005), a genetic

abnormality that causes one to switch genders when they have an

orgasm. Of course, they can turn back just by having another orgasm,

but that may not be so easy, since a male ""zero"" who just changed

into a woman may not be attuned to how to sexually excite his female

self to orgasm.  Then there is the matter of having to maintain two

complete wardrobes ...

Firmly tongue in cheek, this hillariously offbeat indie comedy from

writer-director Martin Curland features witty dialogue delivered by

a talented, likeable young cast, headed by Taylor Handley (whom some

may remember as Oliver on ""The O.C."") as Luke.  Not a gay film, but

of special interest to anyone who likes to explore the mystery of

traditional gender roles and attitudes.  DVD includes a phony plug

for a supposed ""support group"" for zerophiliacs, deleted scenes and

a short ""making of"" feature.  I give it four stars out of five.",1173312000,22,1167,4.607843137254902

2718080,4,B000M2E372,"Most other reviews outline the general plot, basically about a fictional ""disease"" which makes its ""victims"" switch physical biological gender with each orgasm. Production standards are just adequate to make this concept work. The script and directing are also good enough. Most importantly this movie offers some deep questions about what is gender and is highly relevant to our times. I think more can be done with this concept and we might wish to see a sequel. For instance, how might we expect society to evolve if the entire world is ""afflicted""? One imagines gender discrimination would disappear. How are children born and raised? What happens to a super macho misogynistic male who is afflicted? What happens to an anti-LGBTQ individual? There are many angles which could be explored in a series of movies. Alternatively, this might make a good streaming series for NEXTFLIX??",1469232000,2,885,5.152777777777778

2718145,5,B000M2E372,"Suppose some people could switch from male to female and back, more or less at will? If you thought puberty was confusing, you ain't seen nothing yet. Simply adapting to one adult kind of sexuality is hard enough. Having to get used to the other, too, adds a whole new dimension of ambiguity. Suppose a man becomes female, at least for a while, and finds himself attracted to other women? Or to other men? It rather neatly blurs distinctions of straight and gay. Having done that for the sex-changers, do the terms still have meaning to monosexuals?

Although phrased as a teen flick and filled with traditional problems around dating and more modern questions of orientation, this has a bit more depth than you might expect. It's not for the body-shy, but overt sexuality is mostly a matter hints, shadows, and what's just off-screen. Despite a few predictable elements, I recommend this one highly.

Amazing transformation scenes, besides the back alley scene.  This is an independent film, so the bad cosmetics can be forgiven.

And some unknown actors that really get into their roles.

2718158,5,B000M2E372,"Both my spouse and I found this movie to be totally cool.  On a scale from 1 to 10, it was a 13.  This movie is all over the queerness map, which is difficult but awesome to find in a movie.  The movie has an intersex-like premise, dealing with a fictional abnormal chromosomal condition that transforms the affected person to the opposite sex after having the big O.  Then it hits on a number of the issues transgender people deal with.  It also goes in a little bit to dealing with gay/lesbian issues.  Note that only few of these words (gay, lesbian, transgender, intersex) are actually used in the movie.  Supporting characters are heterosexual, and you see things from their perspective as well.  Even better, the heterosexual couple were supportive of their zerophiliac friend.  This movie has periods of humor, introspective soul-searching, and social dynamics between genders.  I would recommend this movie for its entertainment purposes to any person who would like to escape into a gendermorphic fantasyland for about 90 minutes.  This has to be the most unique movie of the queer genre.

2718161,4,B000M2E372,"This film was really fun. I bought it after seeing it on cable and realizing I would want to watch it many more times. The tone is light, and the romance is strong. The film is built around young people who slowly need to learn to accept unexpected things about themselves. While it's a gender bending theme, its appeal is broad. It's the funny film, with depth, and characters that are engaging and likable. Shot in Oregon the scenery is a pleasant part of the film.",1265414400,4,467,4.441860465116279
2718162,5,B000M2E372,"This film has a special place in my heart, and I can't rate it highly enough.  Not only is the plot quirky, funny, and complex, but the film touches on some elements of human nature that have been swept under the rug for far too long.  Beneath the humor--and there is plenty of it--there is the messy truth of our lives, served up in the Oregon rain.  Watch this flick, then watch it again and again, as I have.  BTW the soundtrack is great, and I read on a blog somewhere that it took years to put together the musical score.  Awesome.",1256601600,2,536,4.215686274509804

The premise of the movie is what I found to be the most interesting in comparison to many movies I come across.  What if you had to ability to be male or female.  Since this subject isn't brought up much at all in the movie industry I really went out of my way to find it.  What this movie gave me was interesting, inventive and unique.  As long as you don't mine the premise.  I enjoyed the acting, they were pretty believable and the dialogue was very real in my book.  If you're looking for a different kind of movie, don't mind the premise or some slight female nudity, I highly recommend.

For those who haven't yet seen it, then do so ASAP - for those who have, you know what I'm talking about.

It was cute and funny. Okay not over the top like some Hollywood productions, but it had that uniqueness of an ""Indy"" (independent film) feel to it.

I found myself chuckling and L-ing OL (Laughing out Loud) at some parts, and feeling the main character's (Luke's) frustration on the whole gender switching ordeal.

And of course, I found myself asking the question(s), what would it be like to be able to gender switch on a whim? (although in the film there was more ""manipulation"" required ;) than just a whim).

And then, what gender would I ultimately choose to be?

And of course, Kyle Schmid (as Max) and the great ""reveal"" in the shower scene! <-- That really got me! I literally said out loud (but to myself): ""Wow, I didn't see that coming!"" And then things just fell into place.

I'm so glad I discovered this film (and of course if not having become a fan of Kyle since seeing him in ""Blood Ties"", I may have NEVER known about it.)

Zerophilia is a definite must see!! ;)",1248134400,,1206,4.352678571428571
2718176,5,B000M2E372,"This offering from Martin Curland extrapolates the social consequences of an interesting natural phenomenon:  some species of animals possess no Y chromosome, instead defining gender post-conceptually by an unknown mechanism (the mole vole is such a mammal).  Still others (some species of frogs, moths, and fish) are actually able to alter their gender to better survive differing environmental conditions.  So what if evolution dealt such a hand to homo sapiens?
  Okay, you're going to have to suspend a good bit of disbelief (like the fact that the protagonists don't explode when losing 20 kilos or so of body mass) and view this as more a fantasy flick.  Anyway, this movie isn't about science, it's about people.  The question being examined is the nature of attraction, identity, and love.  The acting and scripting gags can be a bit uneven but it is very well made for an indie flick and has a very unique premise.  Highly recommended.",1236816000,4,944,5.0

Some of the following may be cryptic because I don't want to give the story away.  The movie is coated in allegory for the obviously 'straight' audience that it is aimed for.  It is only after you have watched it that you realize the nuances behind the attractions and what happened why and when.  For example, the emergence of the sister at the car shop immediately after the introduction of the mechanic to the truck owner is obviously an indication of same sex attraction but that attraction is never stated publically (and it is only after you watch the movie that you understand what was behind it).  In the sense that the message of 'know your true self' is stated throughout, and especially in the EXTRAS this is a highly recommended movie.  That they did not want to explore the Male/Male Mechanic/Zerophilliac relationship (always showing them fighting, or at a comfortable distance despite the obvious attraction) is possible hollywood selling strategy.",1185580800,3,1069,4.878453038674033

2718182,5,B000M2E372,"I have to say that I had never heard anything about this movie when I rented it. My initial interest fell mainly in the fact that it's leading actors were Taylor Handley and Kyle Schmid (both whom I love and are gorgeous). So I rented it. Five minutes into it, I was hooked. I was actually multitasking when I put it in and stopped everything to watch it. This is one of the cleverest movies I have ever seen. Not only did I love the underlying message, which is a bit cheesy but I feel is important, (Love is out of your control, that you can't help whom you fall in love with). And I also felt it broke away the line between gay and straight, because I don't feel that when it comes to orientation things are black and white, there is a grey area. The writers show this when the main character Luke goes above and beyond to try to proove to his friend that he is straight, (Luke is a zerophiliac and not unlike a frog he can change his sex) because of the fact that once he turns into a woman he becomes sexually attracted to another guy his friend starts to wonder about Lukes sexuality even though when Luke is a man he likes a girl named Michelle. A little confused? So is Luke. But he soon realizes that accepting who you are is what's important not putting labels on everything, which I felt is the best message. Although the idea of humans being able to change their sex as a frog is able to is a bit far fecthed I thought it was important to the message that writer was sending and the storyling was so great it was easy to forget that it would never really happen. I also would like to say to you skeptics out there thinking this might be just another gay love story I would like to point out that it isn't, there is no girl on girl kissing or guy on guy kissing, Luke turns into a woman and likes another guy and when he turns back into a man he likes a girl named Michelle, he is straight as both sexes. Overall I thought the acting was great, the writing was amazing and this movie has become one of my favorites. I love giving credit to the underappreciated or unrecognized indie films these days (I am so tired of everyone in hollywood trying to make a box office hit, the usual standard special effects with a shaky story line) and this movie deffinately stands out above the rest. I reccommend giving this movie a chance and before long I think it could hold its own as a cult classic such as Boondock Saints or Rocky Horror Picture Show.

2718183,5,B000M2E372,Well done and entertaining movie. Usually these type of movies suffer from poor writing or poor acting or both. A pleasent surprise.,1176163200,,132,5.045454545454546
2718184,4,B000M2E372,The premise of the film is a little far-fetched but once you get over that it is an interesting idea that is cleverly spun out. It helps that the two leading protagonists are immensely attractive (I would imagine to both males and females) and so the idea of changing genders is enticing!!,1175558400,12,289,4.576923076923077
2718185,3,B000M2E372,"This is not your average sci-fi romantic comedy plot: boy meets girl, girl meets boy, boy falls for girl... but that last bit becomes a problem, because when Luke feels the stirrings of lust for Michelle, boy starts to TURN INTO a girl.  This is because he has ""zerophilia,"" a rare genetic disorder that causes those afflicted to spontaneously change gender whenever they orgasm.  To compound matters, Luke's newfound female alter ego ""Luca"" feels quite attracted to Michelle's brother Max.

The genre is that of a teen sex comedy, and the film's subject matter makes the perfect fodder for a host of sex and gender-related jokes.  However, this indie film goes beyond the formulaic pablum Hollywood seems to crank out too much of these days. On another level, it does have more to say about gender roles, relationships and acceptance of oneself.

Writer/director Martin Curland's debut production features a clever script.  There are excellent performances from the entire cast, particularly Taylor Handley (Luke) and Rebecca Mozo (Michelle). Dustin Seavey and Alison Folland are definite standouts in their roles as Luke's friends Keenan and Janine, and Marieh Delfino also deserves mention as the emotionally-confused ""Luca.""

The special effects and makeup were pretty decent given the movie's presumably limited budget. On another note, while the filmmakers could have shot this script virtually anywhere, they made quite good use of locations in and around Eugene, Oregon.

The DVD extras don't add a lot to the film.  However, there is a pretty humorous interview with actress Kelly LeBrock (The Woman in Red) where she talks of zerophilia as though it were a real disease.",1173484800,23,1680,5.192592592592592
