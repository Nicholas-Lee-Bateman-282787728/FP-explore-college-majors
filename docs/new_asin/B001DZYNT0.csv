3544670,5,B001DZYNT0,"I have this dvd and would recommend it to anyone of any age with virtually any medical issues. As a nurse who suffers from many medical issues, including fibromyalgia and Chronic Fatigue, I can honestly say that the regular practice of Gigong has significantly decreased my stress, and my pain and has aided in relaxation and sleep. I am able to bend and touch the floor with my knuckles!! That's right. I could NEVER do that before. You will fall in love with Debi's soothing voice and will appreciate the simplicity of the moves and instructions. The meditation will just take you away. My 7 yr.old granddaughter loves to do the DVD with me and especially loves the Bear and Crane moves. Great to help her relax on a hectic day or get in some exercise on a rainy day. You will not be disappointed. Viewing the location where the dvd was filmed is more than worth the price of the dvd, but the instruction is truly priceless. This is a must buy!",1218585600,9,946,4.473988439306359
3544671,5,B001DZYNT0,"I own a copy of this dvd and it is FABULOUS! I'm in my late 40's, an avid cyclist and find this dvd to be just the right element for my daily workout routine. With its slow continuous movements and postures, my breathing is slowed to an almost healing/meditative pace, my balance is increased, and my overall well-being is infused to a positive energy level that increases productivity throughout the day. I especially benefit from the tai-chi, slow moving, meditative ""exercises"" again at the end of the day to eliminate stress in preparation for a good night's sleep. This is a must-have dvd for anyone who is proactive in their overall health and well-being!",1218585600,4,661,4.807017543859649

8295714,5,B001DZYNT0,"I have been in a Tai Chi class for several months and we do some Qigong to warm up and relax. It occured to me that this would be a great exercise for my parents. You probably have parents like mine who constantly complain about their aches and pains and do nothing about it.  This DVD is for them. This DVD succeeds where the other 10 Qigong Dvds I looked at from Gaiam and Lee Holden, among others, failed.  First of all there is not a lot of eastern medicine mumbo jumbo from a Chinese guy in silk pajamas. Nothing turns off a couple of elderly Midwestern Lutherans faster than some guy they can barely understand describing how this twist will cure what ails their gall bladder.  Debi does explain chi in one chapter but it is not part of the primary practice. Secondly Debi does the exercise without any talking. You can do it with the tutorial but she also includes a 25 minute workout with only soft music. The scenery is beautiful and tranquil. There has been some criticism that Debi moves too quickly through the movements but I think it is a good pace as an exercise for my parents. Nothing is overdone and there are short pauses between several of the movements. I have looked at literally hundreds of workout videos and it is such a joy to find one that is beautifully produced,  not annoying, does exactly what you want it to.",1314748800,3,1340,4.412955465587045
8295715,5,B001DZYNT0,"Debi is a local qigong practitioner, which is one reason why I purchased her DVDs.  Excellent, easy to follow.",1299715200,,110,4.7894736842105265
8295716,3,B001DZYNT0,I am a truck driver and sit for long periods of time I needed something that I could incorporate in my daily routine...and this product fits what I need not to difficult I have been looking for quite a while,1297641600,,207,4.2
8295717,5,B001DZYNT0,"I am one of the producers of this DVD. I was fortunate enough to have Debi Dunn as a teacher. She introduced me to qigong to help me relieve the stress I was experiencing from my husband's car accident. In addition to helping with stress, my practice of qigong has helped regulate my blood pressure and improved my flexibility and balance---all these things are important---for people of all ages. In this DVD, Debi presents simple qigong routines that cover everything from breathing, balance, core strength, self-massage, meditation and even qiflow dancing. You can mix and match and select what you feel like doing each day and the great thing about how the DVD works, is what you choose plays straight through without you having to go back to the main menu to click on the next routine. Also, Debi combines a little yoga and Pilates and t'ai chi in the DVD.",1296345600,3,861,4.708609271523179
8295718,3,B001DZYNT0,"This is not a bad qigong workout DVD, but I think with a little tweaking it could be much better. It offers a wide variety of qigong movements, but most are done much to quickly! Qigong movements are done slowly and deliberately. Granted, you'll find a range in movement speed among qigong instructors who have DVDs out, but this one is especially disappointing because the rapid succession of movements here seem not to have any meditative intention behind them.

The other problem with this DVD is the overly long camera angles when a new pose is introduced. In a couple of the more involved movements, they're first shown in far away from the instructor doing them, and a close up comes later on. It would be better to see all the movements parts first close-up

I like the idea of showing the poses done seated but there are too few examples. What's weird about this extra feature is the distracting beige screen over the in-screen circle that eventually dissolves to show the sitting variation.

The meditation section is thin, but the sections featuring the animal poses (bear, dragon, crane) are introduced nicely, giving the viewer time to shift gears.

Like most exercise DVDs, there too little information on the cover about what exactly is on the DVD.

If you're looking for variety to your qigong practice,this brief (25-26 minute) qigong routine taught by a Western instructor offers a decent workout with a wide variety of individual movements (but doing them at a slower speed would be better for circulating and building qi.)",1259107200,3,1541,4.866412213740458
8295719,5,B001DZYNT0,"Debi has been my qigong teacher for 3 years. Her extraordinary teaching skills, patience and kindness have helped me learn many  beautiful qigong movements which have improved my balance, flexibility and strength and reduced my stress.  My positive experience with Debi motivated me to help her produce this dvd because I knew she could take the mystery out of learning basic qigong movements for everyone interested in learning and practicing this ancient Chinese form of exercise. We viewed numerous dvds already in the marketplace and found many of them to be quite confusing and complex. Plus, it bothered us that once you finally learned the movements, you had to listen to the instructions each time you practiced with the dvds. We worked hard to make Debi's dvd very user friendly---the movements are easy to master. Debi gives clear instructions and demonstrates every move and once you master the routine, you get to follow along with Debi with just music and no instruction. The meditation at the end of the dvd is relaxing. Debi's voice is calming. The dvd is beautiful to watch.",1258243200,,1090,4.983516483516484
8295720,5,B001DZYNT0,"I was a skeptic about this DVD and Qigong in general. Yet both the DVD/practicing Qigong have been amazing for me. I am grateful, Debi is a WONDERFUL teacher.
Since using this DVD my blood pressure has lowered substantially since practicing Qigong. My blood pressure was quite high when I started, I was borderline for being a candidate for high blood pressure medication. I also was planning a wedding for my daughter out of state. Needless to say, I was feeling quite stressed. Watching this DVD helped me stay calm/balanced while getting things in place for my daughter's big event.
Four hours before my daughter's wedding I received news that my mentor had died. It threw me for a loop. I went out into the field and practiced ""standing"" the way Debi had shown me.... I finished doing my Qigong and walked away feeling very peaceful. I was very present for my daughter and my family through out the rest of the day, mercifully.
This DVD/practicing Qigong has the potential of turning life around for you. I highly recommend this video!!!
Thanks Debi for all of your work making this available to those of us who need to get back on track/regaining our balance figuratively and literally!!",1225670400,7,1192,4.763285024154589
8295721,5,B001DZYNT0,This video is accessible for all levels. Dunn is an excellent and earnest practitioner of the healing art of qigong. In addition to safe and healthful exercises this professional production displays a beautiful setting and music that is extremely conducive to practice. As a professional taijiquan instructor and Debi's  teacher I would recommend this video for all beginning students of qigong.,1219190400,4,395,5.475409836065574
8295722,5,B001DZYNT0,"When I was first introduced to Qigong for Everyone, I was skeptical about the claims as to how wonderful I'd feel afterwards. As I started the routine, within 5 minutes I noticed my flexibility increasing and my body relaxing as I was going through the movements. About halfway through, I was convinced that Qigong truly is for everyone. I work in a high stress job and when it's been one of those days, I put the DVD in and 25 minutes later, the knot between my shoulder blades that had been developing all day eases up and I can relax. My wife is a flight attendant and the workout really helps her recover from all the lifting and being on her feet all day. Whenever possible, we go through the workout before going to work so we arrive at work relaxed and feeling like we can handle whatever the day throws our way. It's a wonderful, easy to learn workout that we enjoy doing together. I encourage everyone to buy this DVD and begin experiencing the benefits of Qigong for themselves.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Qigong-for-Everyone-with-Debi-Dunn/dp/B001DZYNT0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Qigong for Everyone with Debi Dunn</a>",1218931200,8,1172,5.2063492063492065
