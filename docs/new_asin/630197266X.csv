8691850,1,630197266X,"The back cover of this DVD makes this movie sound great. Don't be fooled. It is not a movie about redemption. It is not a family movie. The sex scenes are gratuitous. There is nudity in the movie. Parents beware.

This western is a movie about an outlaw who makes Christians look foolish. The town's Christians illogically believe a rough, ill-mannered, foul-mouthed, Biblically ignorant outlaw is the preacher they have invited to set up a church in their town. This preacher/outlaw takes a liking to the supposedly Christian daughter of a leading family of the town. These parents take a trip and leave their daughter with the preacher/outlaw for safe-keeping. As soon as the parents are out of town, the preacher/outlaw and the daughter are in bed. There are numerous sex scenes in the film involving this preacher/outlaw. There is a ridiculous baptism scene for the purpose of showing us the ""Christian"" daughter in a clinging, wet, see-through gown.

Don't waste your money on this movie. The DVD is extremely grainy. The story is not believable.

If you want a good movie about redemption, get ""Purgatory.""",1171324800,5,1112,4.967741935483871
