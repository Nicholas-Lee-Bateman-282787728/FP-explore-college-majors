8558995,5,B001D0J4DA,"Awesome dvd for kids that will keep them entertained. I haven't seen anything remotely like this since Sesame Street. Short fun segments that are both fun and educational. Poetry, Trolls, Frankenstein, fairies, gnomes, puppets and more. Teaching segments include abcs, 123s, ROYGBIV colors, the importance of reading and exercise. The fairy tales are really cute and teach acceptance, healthy self esteem and having a positive outlook on life even when things seem bad. This DVD was really fun and teaches valuable lessons to kids. Great for boys and girls. highly recommended and the book is equally great if not better.

I LOVE LOVE LOVE clay animation and I saw Skye The Rejected Little Troll at the Coachella music and arts Festival and couldn't wait to get my hands on this one! I had to have it for my twins. I am not sure who enjoyed it more me or them. It is about time someone brought back the ingenious old school style that we all grew up with. Not since Seasame Street have I been so enchanted in fact, it's way better! Frankenstein Goes To Camp was also great fun and like nothing I have ever seen. I loved the traditional educational segments. Buy this one trust me! I sit my kids down and have 60 minutes to get my house clean!!!",1216684800,2,810,5.090225563909774
