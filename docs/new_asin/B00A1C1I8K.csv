5375007,5,B00A1C1I8K,Watched on YouTube and found to be an excellent movie.  Recently found  Martin Clunes and found him to be a very versatile actor.  Although most of his work is comedy he is as a good an actor in dramatic roles.,1447027200,5,210,4.2

5375012,2,B00A1C1I8K,"I knew within the first few minutes ""who did it"".... who else could it have been....really lame movie!  It just took the whole movie to tell us we were right!  Acting just so-so!  Getting quite tired of British made for Prime movies.  I find them usually very thin on the plot side and sometimes difficult to understand the accents!  Let's try some American actors for a change!",1522368000,,378,4.582089552238806

5375015,5,B00A1C1I8K,"Wow! A tale of two blended families, their combined  children, and how they cope and solve problems. Hermione Norris playsxRosie, a well adjusted woman, newly married to her second husband, played by Martin Clunes. Each bring a son and a daughter to this new family.

All seems well enough,each child trying to adjust to the new situation. Enough money for a large house with a room for everyone. Some difficulties with Rosies ex husband, but there is love to go around. And, then, a local girl is found murdered. Rosie finds a pair of bloodied trainers under her sons bed, and she starts to wonder. The film revolves around the hunt for the murderer, and the family facing its own difficulties. Terrific acting by all.

5375016,5,B00A1C1I8K,Very sad but heartfelt ending; you hope the son will get the care he needs to get clarity on why he did a terrible thing and learn to live with the guilt and the dark outlook on life.,1521763200,2,183,3.8421052631578947

5375029,3,B00A1C1I8K,"After seeing the animosity between the two sons, I was convinced it would turn out to be the stepbrother, Rob, framing the other son, Jamie.  Have to say I was quite disappointed when the story didn't go in that direction.  Would have been fun to see that pompous dad Ben brought down a notch.",1520899200,2,293,4.407407407407407

5375033,5,B00A1C1I8K,Beautiful film of the trials that families face. The strength of this mother's love is tested to a maximum boundary. A true act of love in its rawest form. The acting by all cast was simply bang on!,1520380800,5,198,4.2368421052631575

5375037,5,B00A1C1I8K,"A beautiful young girl fails to return home, we saw her die at the start of the episode bleeding out from a stab wound in the long grass of a marsh somewhere.  We know shes not coming home.  On  that same night the girl went missing a mother in a Brady Bunch type new marriage scenario comes home to find a load of washing finishing its cycle.  The next morning her son tells her someone stole his new expensive  joggers (shoes) and is adamant he didn't loose them, but upon putting away the very washing that she has no idea who in her household put on, she finds them hidden under his bed in a plastic bag, covered in blood, moss, and mud.  She brings them downstairs to where her family is watching the news to ask her son what the f, but notices the report is about the missing girls body being found in the marsh.  She backs out of the room with the shoes and rehides them under the bed.  The two episodes of this mini series revolve around the mother one being able to admit to herself that her son might have been involved, and if that is the case, what should she do about it? Especially since her new family includes a step daughter the same age as the victim who has accused her son of perving on her in the shower which she naturally took his side when he claimed he didnt.

A Mothers Son goes for around 90 minutes so around the same length as a movie, it does play the credits of the first episode about half way through and a summary of that episode at the start of the second.  You can watch them separately or together but it does keep the credits and that rehash in the play all format, which would have been better if theyd edited it out or added the actors in the first one and other behind the scenes staff not in the second to the credits at the end.",1447804800,3,1771,4.137026239067056
8546049,2,B00A1C1I8K,"Pretty surprised that, with this cast, it was so poorly done. Bad writing? Low budget? Not enough screen time for Nicola Walker?",1526688000,,128,4.863636363636363
8546050,5,B00A1C1I8K,"A thoughtful study of a family (2nd marriage for the parents, step-kids, previous husband) after the murder of a local girl. Excellent acting by everyone in it. Brooding scenes of a marsh near the sea. Good movie. Comes to a satisfying conclusion.",1526601600,,247,4.904761904761905
8546051,4,B00A1C1I8K,Good acting.  Good story line.  Well worth my viewing time.,1526515200,,59,4.8
8546052,5,B00A1C1I8K,"My two bothers, one in grade school and one in middle school, were supposed to be spending the night with friends camping out (in the early 60;s). They did set up camp but decided that they wanted to climb the fence into a nearby gravel pit and have a swim. So they did. Things got carried away and they turned on a power hose, accidentally broke a storage shed window and then had some soda that was stored in the shed. Around 11pm our parents were awakened by a knock on our door. Local sheriff had my brothers in tow. The gravel pit owners pressed charges for damages and off to court they went. The judge levied a fine and gave the parents a choice to pay the fine (split between 4 families) or have the boys work off the fine doing community service.  2 families paid the fine and 2 families spent the next two months driving their sons to a nearby city to do grounds keeping work at a hospital.  My brothers raked, shoveled, weeded and swept.

Their crime certainly does not compare with a murder, but it raises the question; what would you do if you suspect your child of a crime?  Deny? Investigate? Question the kid? Go to the police?  What a difficult choice these parents had.  And like many family situations, the answer to these questions did not come easily.

In the end, I'm glad the murderer did not turn out to be a psychopath. He's a regular kid with regular, teen feelings and emotions. I don't like to guess ahead of time about who ""dun it"" so I enjoyed the plot twists and changing circumstances. All of the acting was just fine. The story kept me interested all the way thru.  As a parent, I'm glad I never had to face this situation and I hope I would do the right thing given these circumstances.",1523750400,,1720,4.336448598130841
8546053,5,B00A1C1I8K,Good movie.  A lot of twists and turns and realistic dialog.  Not the over the top junk Hollywood is known for.,1523750400,,111,4.238095238095238
8546054,5,B00A1C1I8K,An amazing movie as realistic as they come. The few negative reviews demonstrate a complete lack of human empathy and compassion.,1523577600,2,129,5.190476190476191

8546056,2,B00A1C1I8K,"***SPOILERS*** The story centers around a mother's suspicion of her son. It is not really a spoiler to say that very close to the beginning of the movie the mother finds her son's trainers (sneakers), which he says were stolen from his gym locker, and sees that one of them has something that appears to be blood on it. There is an interminable scene where she paces and delays testing the substance with hydrogen peroxide for so long the children end up coming home from school before she has the courage to put a few drops on the shoe to ascertain whether there is blood on them or not. And that pretty much sums up the story - the mother absolutely refuses to believe that her son could have done anything wrong, despite the mounting evidence against him. He lies again and again and she knows he is lying but still she is blind to the truth, to the point where her new husband, who she's only been married to for a couple of months, takes his children and leaves the house. I am the mother of a son, but I am also a hard-headed realist. If my son did something wrong and I had the means to find out, I would. And if the signs pointed toward his guilt, I would try to convince him to turn himself in. This movie dragged on and on and ON while the mother dithers around, alienating everyone and agonizing over what to do. I felt like it was pretty much a waste of time. I didn't have much sympathy for any of the characters.",1523491200,,1426,4.2463235294117645
8546057,5,B00A1C1I8K,I suspected but didn't really know until the end.,1523059200,,49,4.555555555555555
8546058,3,B00A1C1I8K,"A little bit long for what it is, and started to drag halfway through.  Clunes is not one of my fave actors, but I've seen several of the actors in other films and I enjoy them.  This film tried to be clever with the ending, but it wasn't.  Not the worst I've seen lately, but far from good.",1522713600,,291,3.9827586206896552
