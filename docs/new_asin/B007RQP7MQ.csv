I am a fan of 50's sci-fi and horror among other genres. I'm looking for a good crisp clear copy, that is why I decided to finally buy Crterian.  This movie was one I first watched on the late late show when I was a lot younger. I confused it with ""Island of Terror"" , which I have been trying to find in DVD format also, but remembered the ""monsters"" didn't become visible until later in the movie and the scene with the constable being turned into a idiot by them wasn't in the Island movie. Anyway, for people who love the old sci-fi and horror from the 50's, this movie is a must have. It's great to just sit back, relax, and watch these older movies. They might have some social commentary hidden within them but to a kid or those of us in our second childhood, who cares.",1339545600,,899,4.226744186046512

Since then, I never forgot it and it stuck with me all these years. When I remembered the title, I quickly went into Amazon's site and ordered it. Oh boy did it bring back memories of my father and I watching the old classic horror movies!! It played beautifully in the DVD player and was just as clear as if it came out in todays time!! Invisible brains killing people!! I hope more people buy this movie. It's a great dvd to enjoy!!",1338940800,,551,4.3076923076923075

When I went to play the movie this came on the screen: DISC ERROR -please eject the disc- playback feature may not be available on this disc.  So i ordered another disc from the same place thru amazon. com The same thing happened again. I called amazon.com and said, they refund my money, thanks to the people at amazon! But i still would like to own a copy. I have several dvd players and tried these 2 copies on them and the same thing happened again. Would someone please tell me which disc supplier via amazon should i buy from? thanks.",1338854400,,612,4.415929203539823
