To remind those of you who forgot and enlighten those of you who never knew Japanese blu rays have the same region code as all north American blu rays. Region A1. So if an American distributer isn't releasing something on blu ray check japan! I got David lynch's lost highway on blu ray from japan in a beautiful blu ray case and slip cover.(be sure to note that there is English audio if that is a concern, luckily david lynch's works are unadulterated and doesn't feature overdubs.) So Those of you who wonder why your paying a few hundred dollars for a Japanese import its because of the demand, shipping and sometime the overall quality of the product. This set is a Japanese exclusive. Enjoy!!",1376956800,3,848,4.622516556291391
