8707897,2,B00UQW2C94,"I will start by repeating the official synopsis from the IMDB `At a Greek hotel in the off-season, a chambermaid, a man obsessed with BMW cars, and a photo-store clerk attempt to film and photograph various badly re-enacted struggles between a man and a woman.'

Now if that sounds a bit uninspiring then you truly lack imagination. This then consists of a mainly dialogue free 94 minutes of arty camera shots and the same three people doing other things like eating, running (no idea where to or indeed why), play fighting, random nudity, bored housewife type sex, cleaning of rooms and more eating.

I think it might be the tedium as expressed as existentialism and it made me think how a Smurf feels knowing they are all going to die out unless Smurfette finally puts out. Oh there is a ropey fashion show too if you are still awake at that point.

This is one of those films that I just wanted to end and you can watch it on fast forward and then it looks like an updated Benny Hill show, but without any humour sexist or otherwise. I have no idea what this was trying to say, do or explain and as such think this is essentially cack as arthouse.",1427500800,,1150,4.415094339622642
