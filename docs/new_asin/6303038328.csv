7834709,1,6303038328,"ok, here goes...
to describe this work as a documentary is flat out & straight up an over indulgent compliment.  bad filming, bad lighting & bad sound does not automically equal an indie-great; not to mention excuses (on every level) & a condescending step-mother's embarrassing input.  so, my sincere advise is:  move on folks, there's nothing to see here.",1455321600,,357,5.016949152542373

7834712,3,6303038328,"I suppose it's deep and thought provoking to folks who haven't already had their fill of overly analytical, semi-neurotic, self-centric navel gazing (or is it shoe-gazing nowadays?).  Gets a bit tedious, like someone gushing (albeit in this case, quietly and gently) on Ecstasy. Yes, we get it---everything is beautiful and profound and amazing and deep and we and our experiences are all incredible and mundane at the same time. Yawn. Then again, at least it's not formulaic pablum, so it's got that going for it. Moving and epiphanous in the same way that a weekend teen retreat is---it's only ""heavy"" the first time around. Once you see it for what it is, not so impressive...and when it's some guy who should have checked off those developmental milestones a long time ago using a camera to buffer himself from the world without thinking that anyone knows what he's doing and why he's doing it, well then it flips back to being mildly annoying .",1451952000,,949,4.822085889570552

7834715,5,6303038328,"A perfect, humble, and delightful documentary. Few other films could equal it. Sure, this review doesn't tell you much about the actual film, but so what? I just really like this film. Saw it in my second semester in film school. I'll never forget it.",1051488000,4,251,4.6
7834716,5,6303038328,"This is a real masterwork.  It's a subtle, painful film and takes some time to develop, but the themes it considers are profound.  McElwee is a charming man, and his omnipresence never grates.  Indeed, the viewer is often aware of the camera only as a surrogate self.  When watching this movie one feels honored to be observing firsthand the life of another person and community, and ain't that why we go to the movies?",1050883200,5,419,4.621621621621622
7834717,5,6303038328,"I just couldn't disagree more vigorously with ""Chewbacca.""  SHERMAN'S MARCH was wondrous, but many were tempted to compare its wit with regard to romance with Woody Allen's take on that subject.  Though SM  touched on nuclear war, etc, it was still about a young guy looking for  love.  TIME INDEFINITE is a much weightier investigation of death and love  and family, but the wit and gentle affection is still there.  It's much  more Kafka or Camus than Woody Allen.  And, if anything, McElwee's ability  to collage the small incidents of his life into something profound has only  increased.",953164800,8,592,4.938775510204081
