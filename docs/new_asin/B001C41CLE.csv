8285796,4,B001C41CLE,"This video was a surprise to me as it was very meaningful about Heidi finding herself through her work with the beautiful parrots introduced to her by her elderly neighbor. I too have parrots and volunteer with a Parrot Rescue and Adoption Agency so this video was very much enjoyed by me and my friends. It is wonderful when someone who is lost inside finds themselves through something they love, whatever that may be. I would definitely recommend this video.",1219622400,2,461,4.775
8285797,2,B001C41CLE,"Heidi Fleiss first gained fame as the Hollywood madam to the stars. But was busted for tax evasion and served several years in prison. This documentary focues on the post-jail Heidi's attempt to open a legal Nevada brothel, called the ""Stud Farm"", which would provide male prostitutes for female customers.

Prior to her becoming incarcerated, I saw Heidi appear on Bill Maher's ""Politically Incorrect"" and she seemed to be a reasonably intelligent and lucid woman. But the Heidi featured in this doc comes across as a drug addled lunatic. She admits to be addicted to crystal meth and seems to be suffering from some sort of mental illness, perhaps bi-polar.

Meanwhile, local opposition and political regulations prevent her from opening up the ""Stud Farm"". But, by the end, I began to wonder if this was a serious business proposal on her part or just a desperate cry for public attention. The laughable product description says this is ""one woman's struggle to keep her dream alive"". But Heidi's ""dream"" is clearly just a delusion and she comes across as sad and pathetic rather than heroic. The doc might maintain some viewers's interest in the same way that people stop to watch a car wreck. But really there is not much worth seeing here.",1216771200,4,1245,4.867924528301887
