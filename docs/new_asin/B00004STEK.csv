8174899,3,B00004STEK,"This video is listed under the wrong dance. It should be with the flamenco dances not Tango.  This video is a mix of Gypsy dances, flamenco dancers, flamenco songs with segments that remind me too much of ""Riverdance"".  Solo steps in single, couple, group routines. The music is great at times but it overshadows the dance steps.  I have mixed feelings about this video. Some of the dance routines I loved, others I disliked. It did not help when I did not like the principal male dancer. He is good, just not great. Traditional dance steps up to the modern.  The camera work at times annoyed me.  I will have to view this video several times before I like it. 55 minutes.",985737600,,672,4.475409836065574
