6928991,4,B00RDZMVOS,"After shopping around I found this great DVD with four Pokemon movies.  I can't sit through a Pokemon show but my kids watched all movies pretty quickly, would buy again",1429228800,,169,4.633333333333334
6928992,4,B00RDZMVOS,"It has all four movies on one DVD, so there is some compression, as is the norm for these types of releases. One sore point is this is bare bones with no special features, so none of the Pikachu shorts on the original individual releases are here. On the plus side, this has the widescreen versions of all of these, which I believe was missing from some versions the 4ever and Heroes DVDs.",1426550400,23,389,4.342465753424658

6928994,5,B00RDZMVOS,"haven't bought it but damn this is cheap! The other two movies are lame but Pokemon Heroes and Pokemon 4ever are gold. If this really was a collector's set then it would've been Pokmon: Spell Of The Unknown and Pokmon: The First Movie. For under $4 dollars, this would be an automatic buy for any pokemon fan.",1519084800,,309,4.43859649122807

6928997,4,B00RDZMVOS,"Considering you're getting four solid Pok&eacute;mon movies for $5, this is a solid DVD. But please know what you're getting before you buy.

If you're getting this set to have a high quality home video release of Pok&eacute;mon movies 4-7, you're not gonna get that here. This is a single dual-layer disc housing four films of varying length (Example: Heroes is only 71 minutes, while Deoxys is close to 100 minutes) with stereo audio (these films were originally mastered in surround). As you can imagine, this hasn't exactly done wonders for the image quality. While not the worst looking DVD I've seen or owned, it's certainly below average, though the overall quality of each film's encode differs. 4Ever gets the worst of things, with a rather pixelated image and a heavy helping of compression artifacts, almost like it's running at 360 on old YouTube. Heroes and Jirachi fare about the same as each other: definitely sharper and less noticeably compromised than 4Ever, though still noticeably crunched down, and Heroes continues to exhibit a strange blue tint and darker image that's been present since the movie's original English release in the early 2000s. Deoxys fares the best of the four, having the sharpest overall image and less noticeable artifacts, though all four movies are plagued by equal shares of color bleeding, ghosting and frame interlacing.

But that said... you're still getting four solid films in a long running series in one place, and all four movies are presented in their original widescreen ratios. For that, I'd say $5 is still a fair deal even with all the technical compromises. But if you're looking for really high quality releases of these films, you're not gonna get that here.",1514937600,4,1721,5.013986013986014
6928998,5,B00RDZMVOS,"I don't want to meet the person that doesn't rate this 5 stars. Pokemon now, Pokemon forever! And if the first movie doesn't pull on your heartstrings, we can't be friends.",1510272000,,172,4.580645161290323

6929012,1,B00RDZMVOS,"...cause this set SUCKS!!! I may be glad to finally get all four of those movies in Widescreen format, but THE one disc is OVERCOMPRESSED as hell! It looks like whoever manufactured this disc didn't really give a crap! No special features (then again, many compilations like this don't have special features at all), no subtitles (even for the deaf and hearing impaired), and ONLY English 2.0. There's also no scene selection (the chapters are like 10 minutes each, which is a lazy choice, and then again, why should you care?). ALL OF THIS COUNTS FOR ALL THE MOVIES IN THE SET, and the movies aren't ordered correctly either (that's those compilations for you). Audio quality may be okay, but the video quality SUCKS! God, why did it have to be a MAJOR distributor to bring this to stores as THE compilation for those Pokmon movies? They would NEVER take care of these movies right. If TPCi gets the license to these movies, I will check how they would do with these movies, and possibly sell this piece of crap.

EDIT: Did I forget to mention that THE menu looks freaking horrible!?

EDIT 2: For anybody saying that I didn't purchased it from Amazon, I actually purchased it from Wal-Mart instead.

EDIT 3: I'm finishing up on the set, and from the looks of it, only 4Ever looks like crap. The rest, somehow, look decent, except for the frame-rate issues on Destiny Deoxys. I'm still keeping it one star, because I'm still an audio- and video-phile.",1500336000,,1451,4.66015625

I'd give the movies 1 star aside from maybe the Deoxys vs. Rayquaza scenes in Destiny Deoxys but I shouldn't expect much from any pokemon movie after the first three. 4ever and Jirachi were horrible. Whatever that dark celebi cocoon giant cgi crapfest was, it destroyed the movie the moment it splashed on screen. Jirachi was just boring and lacked any sort of inspiration. Deoxys was mostly them hiding from Deoxys clones out on the prowl. Heroes was a Johto movie about 2 Hoenn legends and another team rocket-centric plot.

6929155,5,B00RDZMVOS,"Well, everybody else has listed the important info about this release: no special features, no Pikachu shorts, not-fantastic picture quality. If you're a kid who's never seen the shorts and just wants to watch hours of Pokemon action (or buying this movie for one of those kids), this DVD is perfect. This set contains Pokemon movies 4 - 7, albeit not in order. It doesn't really matter though because each is a stand-alone adventure that begins with a voiceover introduction about the world of Pokemon, so even the non-Pokemon initiated will get the gist of the movie's setting.

In case you don't want to read my reviews, I'll say that I'd buy copies of this DVD as gifts for kids that like Pokemon with no hesitation. All of the movies stay within the G-rated range, and while some are thin on plot, they all have positive messages about friendship and teamwork.

I'm an adult Pokemon fan who only saw these movies recently, and found some of them boring, but loved the others. Take my opinions with a grain of salt, since an 8 year-old will probably eat all of them up. Here's my take on each movie. *SOME SPOILERS*

Pokemon Heroes: Latios & Latias
One of the reasons I got the disc. The gang meets two friendly dragon Pokemon, the brother and sister Latios and Latias, who guard the Soul Dew, a treasure that protects the Venice-inspired city of Alto Mare. When a couple of thieves steal it, it's up to the city's protectors and Ash and the gang to be heroes and save the city from a huge tidal wave. This is the one movie on the disc where not all of the heroes get to go home. Latios and Latias are adorable and truly are heroes. It's a movie about how heroes sometimes have to make sacrifices to save those they love.

Pokemon 4Ever
Honestly, I found this one kind of boring. This is a perfect example of the stereotypical Pokemon movie: Powerful legendary Pokemon shows up, someone with a dumb hairstyle tries to use its energy/make it evil, a forest is destroyed, Ash saves the Pokemon, someone dies or almost dies, another Pokemon shows up and magically fixes the forest and brings whoever died back to life. And Team Rocket are bystanders sucked into the adventure. This time, the legendary Pokemon are Celebi, a cute time-traveling Pokemon, and Suicune, one of the legendary beasts of Johto.

Pokemon: Destiny Deoxys
Had basically no plot, but a LOT of action. Deoxys, a Pokemon that crash-landed on Earth on an asteroid, has motives which are unknown but turn out to be not evil. The dragon Pokemon Rayquaza takes exception to Deoxys trespassing on its territory, and starts a fight. Lots of buildings get trashed, but it didn't really have a lot of Pokemon getting hurt that some of the movies have. Subplot involves a boy named Tory who is terrified of Pokemon, but eventually gets over his fears and helps to save the day. My favorite part of the movie: Munchlax.

Pokemon: Jirachi, Wish Maker
This might be my favorite one. Has a plot very similar to 4Ever, but I liked the supporting storyline with Butler and Diane, who get a bit of character development. Butler does evil things, but helps make it right when he realizes what really matters in life. Not to mention that Jirachi might be the cutest Pokemon I've ever seen, who behaves sort of like a mischievous 4 year-old. The movie ends happily, but with a sad goodbye. This movie is all about friendship, and how friends can stay friends forever even when they're apart. And some really cool dragon Pokemon show up too (including my favorite, Flygon), so that's a plus.

And at about $1 - $2 per movie, you can't really go wrong with these 4 movies suitable for the whole family.",1462147200,12,3652,4.617873651771957

6929174,4,B00RDZMVOS,"This was purchased as a prize for our arcade, and Pokemon is definitely huge here!  Having watched through all 4 videos, I definitely have every confidence we can show these in our media room.  The plot is never really that strong, but then again the Pokemon anime isn't particularly known for that.  Your standard tropes exist well enough.  Some bullet points I managed to get out of these videos:
* I loved the interactions between Latios & Latias.  It's absolutely the cutest display I've seen from anything involving Pokemon.  That includes Pikachu.
* Pokemon 4 Ever might be a little bit traumatic.  It's a big spoiler if I were to say what it is, but it deals with something usually not discussed seriously in children's entertainment.  If you prefer to expose your children to the more unpleasant things in life, this will probably be very constructive.  If your child is young, fussy, & very sheltered, especially if they haven't learned the difference between real & make-believe, you might want to pass on it.
* Jirachi Wish Maker probably has the most exposure to humans and the least pokemon of the bunch.  If anything, this has the deepest plot, because the humans have to sell the story more than the pokemon do.  There's definitely stronger relationships here than normal.
* Destiny Deoxys is much more action-oriented.  There isn't a whole lot of story other than ""stuff happened, deal with it.""  I did take great issue to the idea that, in a power outage, pokeballs don't work, in which case some other explaining needs to be done regarding using them out in the wilderness.
Altogether, this is definitely an amazing set of movies for the price.  We got it for about $6, and you can't really complain about getting 4 decent movies for that price.  They will certainly be watched often by Pokemon fans.",1457308800,19,1818,4.782051282051282

Cons:
-480p is the highest resolution
-Unnecessarily grainy in some spots and blurry in others
-Double lines in the character outlines
-Lack of the Pikachu short movies and other special features

Pros:
-4 movies on 1 disc
-Perfect dialogue for the children, as well as decent voice acting

The other pros would be that it has an abundance of great Pokemon battles, but you shouldn't expect anything less from a movie based on this franchise.

I do say it's worth the price you pay, but if you're looking for picture quality and other features there are better means of getting these films, however to my knowledge this is the only bundle package I am aware of.",1445040000,42,818,4.73943661971831
