Very disappointed
Also tried on another dvd player with the same results",1442188800,,212,4.756756756756757
8201891,3,B000RO9PX2,"I CAN ONLY REVIEW THE SERVICE I RECEIVED AS I HAVEN'T WATCHED THE MOVIE YET. HAVE BEEN STUDYING AND LOOKING AFTER MY FAMILY SO NO TIME. I ALWAYS RECEIVE GREAT SERVICE FROM AMAZON THAT'S WHY I RETURN TO THE SIGHT. I LOVE TOM LONG SO THE MOVIE SHOULD BE AWESOME.

THE ONLY THING I HAVE TO SAY IS THAT CONSIDERING THIS MOVIE IS AUSTRALIAN IT'S A BIT SAD THAT I HAD TO HAVE IT IMPORTED TO AUSTRALIA. I COULDN'T GET IT HERE!",1196812800,,419,4.109756097560975
