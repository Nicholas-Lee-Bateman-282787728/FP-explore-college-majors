1011454,5,6305347956,"This disc is a documentary that originally appeared on PBS. It is about four men who were great thinkers in their day and became known as the core members of the New York intellectual set. The documentary goes into their early years and the forces that shaped their thinking and how all four of them came to believe in America after early lives as anti-Stalinist leftists.

The greatest of them, Irving Kristol, became known as the Godfather of Neo Conservatism. He book, ""Neo-Conservatism, Autobiography of an Idea"" explains his journey from Trotskyism better than can be done here and what he says in the documentary herein is a summary of that Journey. Daniel Bell evolved into a well known economic and sociological thinker, Nathan Glazer has done excellent work on ethnic identity and how it shaped Americans and Irving Kristol, who maintained his early leftism, wrote an epic study of the Lower East Side at the turn of the last century, World of Our Fathers,"" which, for all its shortcomings, is well worth reading today.

By watching this documentary the viewer becomes aware of societal forces that gave rise to first bad ideas and their counteraction by good ideas that shape today's debates on public policy. It is worth buying and viewing!",1360108800,,1251,4.89622641509434

1011456,5,6305347956,"This is a wonderful film, entertaining and intelligent, about a generation of intellectuals who met at City College in the nineteen-thirties, immediately began arguing, and never stopped.  They became the dominant intellectuals in New York City for more than thirty years, spawning not only the New Left but also the original neo-conservatives.  If you're at all interested in where the arguments that now dominate American politics came from, this is an invaluable film.  And even if you're not, it's an entertaining collection of personalities for whom the quest to understand the world was always a vigorous wrestling match.",1175299200,5,627,5.377551020408164
1011457,5,6305347956,"I know of no other filmmaker who, like Joseph Dorman, so thoroughly captured the people, history, and ideas of an era as to go on to publish a book on the same subject through a major university (University of Chicago Press).  This documentary is matchless.  It was funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities.  The film covers both the lives of these four New York Intellectuals but also the socio-political thought of America in the twentieth-century.

Early in the feature, political philosopher Michael Walzer says, ""If I try to think about the New York intellectual and specifically about these four New York Intellectuals, one of the most striking things about them....is, in a way, of thinking about the world. You can't being to analyze, say, the recent strikes in Detroit without starting with the division of labor in ancient Babylonia and working your way up: that's the context, the context is world history, and the questions you bring to your analysis are the largest questions, where are you going, where have you been.""

In 1932, socialist candidate Norman Thomas, air to the party's Eugene V. Debs, won nearly a million votes in the presidential election, many of his supporters where from the new urban class of Jews.  The socialist idea that inspired Daniel Bell and Irving Howe appeared first 100 years earlier by Karl Marx.  Nathan Glazer's father read ""The Forward,"" a socialist paper, and voted for Norman Thomas, Irving Kristol learned about radical politics from his sister who took him to the protest plays of Clifford Odets.  Daniel Bell said, ""When I joined the Epsilons in 1932, this is when Norman Thomas is running for president and a group of us would go from corner to corner with a step ladder to give talks...you don't know very much when you're 13 years old and you've got to speak for 10 minutes so I pretty much memorized the last section of ""The Jungle"" which is Eugene Victor Debs' speech and people would say oh how eloquent he is.""

New York City College in Harlem was a school for the brightest of the city's poor, swelling applications during the Great Depression made its all male student body nearly the equal of Harvard yet more radical.  Columbia, the city's more prestigious college, trained the protestant elite, and the few Jews it accepted were usually wealthy German Jews.  Daniel Bell, class of 1939 said, ""Columbia was for the genteel...Harvard was even much further out, totally abstract.""  He adds, ""Most of the teachers [at NY City College] were all dodos so we educated ourselves.""  Kristol and Howe supported Trotsky at Alcove One where Nathan Glazer joined later.  They debated, mostly, Alcove Two who were Stalinists.  Alcove One watched with growing concern as fascism grew in Europe.  ""Partisan Review"" was anti-Stalinist publication that combined literary modernism with Marxist politics, its first issues included pieces by T.S. Eliot, Wallace Stevens, Edmund Wilson, and Leon Trotsky.  Alcove One was inspired by ""Partisan Review.""  Leon Trotsky was, for many, the paradigm.

In August 1939, the era of the Popular Front came to a sudden end when Stalin signed a nonaggressive pact with Hitler.  American communists quickly abandoned their alliance with Roosevelt; a week later, Germany invaded Poland to begin WWII.  In 2 years time, Hitler attacked the Soviet Union and Communists proclaimed the Popular Front again.  Kristol spent the war as a soldier in Southern France; Howe spent it in Alaska; the ""New Leader' hired Daniel Bell as its editor; while Nathan Glazer finished college.

In 1945, Glazer became an assistant editor on ""Commentary"" a new magazine on politics and culture funded by a leading Jewish organization, the magazine included many from ""Partisan Review"" as its writers.  He met Kristol the following year when he joined is editorial staff.  Kristol became the editor of religious topics at ""Commentary.""  Kristol said, ""My major memory of a dinner party was...I got a plate full of food and there was a couch and so I walked over and sat down in the middle of the couch....Mayor McCarthy sat down on one side of me, Hannah Arendt sat down on the other side of me, and Diana Trilling pulled up a chair and sat facing me and I was a prisoner I couldn't get out and they then had a long hour and half disagreement on Freud and they disagreed and I don't know what they disagreed about all I know was that I sat there terror-stricken.""  Bell said, ""Reading Weber, reading Dostoyevsky's `The Possessed' made clear that the radical apathists position was not only self-defeating but could lead the some horrifying results.""

The American Communist Party...hidden from view, they largely controlled the 1948 presidential campaign of anti-Cold War candidate Henry Wallace.  The following year, a Communist organized peace conference attracted a large number of liberal intellectuals and celebrities.  Alarmed at communist influence in the liberal community, Kristol, Bell, and Glazer joined the ""American Committee for Cultural Freedom,"" which had been created to organize intellectuals against the party.

Espionage fears rose as the Rosenberg couple were found guilty, and executed for giving atomic secrets to the Soviet Union.  Kristol and Sidney Hook wrote a letter to the NY Times asking McCarthy to resign from public life, but Kristol and Bell were also becoming increasingly anti-communistic.  ""Irving Howe thought that a lot of the Cold War intellectuals, including former friends from Alcove One, by virtue of being opponents of communism they were joining in a great celebration of America, and it seemed to Irving Howe as an unwarned celebration.""  Howe published in 1954 ""This Age of Conformity,"" which scandalized the left for losing intellectual and radical features.  In 1953, Howe helped found ""Dissent,"" a magazine of socialist thought, but not affiliated with any organization.  Walzer, Co-editor of ""Dissent,"" said, ""you know Irving's line, `when intellectuals have nothing else to do they start a magazine.'""  Glazer says, that the magazine criticized people who had ""already abandoned socialism"" and ""fell into easy marxist modes of denunciation, sell-outs,...we were all becoming professors so I don't couldn't see the point in one group of professors attacking another group.""  Kristol began to co-edit a new culture magazine, ""Encounter.""  Howe published, ""Politics and the Novel,"" and was influential in the revival of Yiddish literature.  Glazer's interests in sociology lead to writing, ""The Lonely Crowd,"" and, ""Beyond the Melting Pot.""  Bell's essay on labor and politics culminated in ""Work and Its Discontents: the Cult of Efficiency in America,"" and, ""The End of Ideology: on the exhaustion of political ideas in the fifties.""

After WWII universities rapidly expanded and were now hiring Jews.  Neither Bell, Howe, nor Glazer had received graduate degrees but they all found jobs.  Tom Hayden, former president of Students for a Democratic Society met Daniel Bell after graduating from the University of Michigan. Bell said, ""...what struck me most about Hayden, apart from the personality of the man which I never liked, somebody once called him the Richard Nixon of the left which I think is a nice apologia for Hayden, that these were people who had lost a sense of historical memory.  The 30s were sort of lost in the fog, the 50s were confused for them and they thought they were coming out of themselves.""  How and ""Dissent"" reached out to SDS; but Hayden appeared to Howe as having a ""czarist streak"" that made him and his ""Dissent"" group uncomfortable with the absolutist position of non-violence that Hayden had.

Glazer, who went to UC at Berkley, eventually became one of the university's most vocal opponents of the free speech movement.  Meanwhile, Bell was at Columbia with Lionel Trilling where another group of student protests occurred.  Kristol took a skeptical view with Daniel Bell towards socialistic policies in a magazine they founded titled ""The Public Interest.""

George McGovern and the new democratic party was becoming increasingly leftist.  Bell was critical of McGovern but voted for him, this vote lead him eventually to leave ""The Public Interest.""  Though Glazer did not support Nixon he replaced Bell as co editor on the magazine.  Neoconservatives like William F. Buckley of the ""National Review"" thought that their movement can be traced back to writings like ""The Public Interest"" and Walzer adds, ""Increasingly the neoconservatives were in the grip of an ideology....of the free market, and they seemed to me to be Bolsheviks in the way they adopted, defended, and promoted this ideology.""  Howe prophesies, ""In the coming decade or so, the political struggles will not be any longer between democratic capitalism and communist totalitarianism but will now be a struggle between conservatism, Thatcherite conservatism, or Reaganite, or Kristolite conservatism on the one hand, and social democracy on the other.  Glazer does not think he is as conservative as Kristol.  Bell calls himself a ""socialist in economics, a liberal in politics, and a conservative in culture.""

Howe helped found the Democratic Socialists of America.  In the 70s and 80s Kristol wrote a series of papers to help channel the neoconservative movement, especially the religious right.  Kristol says that religion has a ""role to play in redeeming the country and liberalism is not prepared to give religion a role, conservatism is but it doesn't know how to do it.""  Bell says that for Kristol, ""it has become a crusade for him.""  Howe said that he looks upon Kristol as ""a political opponent and the fact that we were together 50 years ago doesn't stir the faintest touch of sentiment in me, I wish him well personally I wish him a long life with many political failures I hope."" Howe died in 1997, the year production stopped for Joseph Dorman.",1172448000,12,9883,5.108830845771144
1011458,5,6305347956,"This excellent documentary traces the careers and political evolutions of four ""New York intellectuals"": Daniel Bell, Nathan Glazer, Irving Howe and Irving Kristol.  They all started as anti-Stalinist leftists at City College of NY in the Thirties; wrote for ""Partisan Review,"" ""Dissent,"" ""Commentary"" and other left-wing and liberal publications; published erudite books, and received teaching positions at prestige universities.  And, except for Howe, they all moved well to the right as they got older.

All of this is fascinating, especially the transition to the right, and their collision with the New Left in the Sixties.  By that time, they'd all gotten recognition and prestigious university appointments--in Bob Dylan's words, they now ""had something to protect.""  They're uniformly critical of the student radicals who sought them out in the early days of the New Left.  Glazer, author of ""Beyond the Melting Pot,"" refused to support the ""Free Speech Movement"" at UC Berkeley, while Bell and Howe have special disdain for Tom Hayden of SDS (Howe says ""he had something of the Commissar about him,"" while Bell calls him ""the Richard Nixon of the Left"").  The (aging) New Leftists interviewed have equal scorn for them--Hayden says that they were spouting off while ""I was going to jail for my beliefs"" and dismisses Howe pithily: ""I wasn't raised in a household where everyone shouted at each other."" A former Berkeley student says, ""Their idea of protest was to write a letter to the editor."" Only Howe (who translated Yiddish poetry and wrote a highly regarded history of Jews in NYC) remained faithful to Socialism.  Glazer and Bell moved to the right of the middle, while Kristol became a friend and adviser to Reagan and the darling of the Neoconservative movement, and gets plaudits on this film from William F. Buckley Jr. and Jeanne Kirkpatrick.

I found this documentary highly satisfying.  Even though all of them are or were old enough to be my father, I strongly identified with their poor and working-class NYC upbringings, and admired their dedication to intellectual life.  The film does a great job of evoking the intellectual/literary NYC salons of the Forties and Fifties.  It's also not without humor.",1114646400,14,2230,5.163888888888889

7887894,1,6305347956,"Ohhhh, we are all so brilliant.  We tell ourselves we are so brilliant.  Yes, yes, so brilliant.  And the time we went to City College, oh, they, those people, were not so brilliant but WE, ourselves are so brilliant.

And we were Trotskyiets.  Why?  Well, it was fashionable.  (No argument is really presented.)

And then we decided we were not, or sort of because of the inherent flaw. (Again no argument is presented.  Dostoevsky's ""The Possessed"" is cited.)

And then we supported McCarthy, and accused others of being what we once were because, well, it was fashionable; there was this feeling; and all that stupid First Amendment, unique to America, core of American values, all that must be killed because of the ideas, the ideas, we cannot even discuss that idea.  (Yes, Lenin and Stalin and Mao are horrific!)  But so is the capitalism that Zola wrote about.  The socialism of Western Europe currently tops best of health care, standard of living, education,  umm, could you talk about that?

These paragons of American freedom, say, yeah, well, later we thought McCarthy was a thug and , well, gosh, at one point, one day, I wrote a letter to the editor saying, ""McCarthy bad.""  There, what more could you ask?

All join in making even the discussion of the idea of socialism or communism illegal.  After thousands of people's lives were destroyed and American socialism was killed.  Let's have a Martini and ignore the women.

And that's where I turned the damn video off.

These people do have ideas. You just don't see the ideas argued in the flick.  Sometimes a conclusion is stated but never really an argument.

If you want to see how these folk became NeoCons and have gifted us with the type of sociopath capitalism that we have today, i.e.companies are allowed to ONLY think of profit, screw the damn people, or the environment or your children or your house, when there is money to be made, well... watch.  This could be subtitled, ""How we were all socialists but when the war came we persecuted our one-time brothers and made a pretty good living.""

I'd rather spend my time listening to Robert Reich, Han Joon Chen, Naomi Klein, even read John Kenneth Galbraith (the war time price tsar in the US, and for years the dean of Keynesianism in the US) and read about the FDR programs that created the boom in the middle class after world war two, so, maybe, just maybe, we can have a widening middle class again.  By the by, none of the folk in this paragraph are , or ever have been, socialists.

There is no discussion of our most peculiar socialists:  Presidents W Bush and B Obama.  Both practice socialism for the rich and only the rich - TARP and Quantitative Easing started under Bush and went went into trillions under Obama.  In Freedom's Land, when the  rich screw up, their losses must be given to the people. Democrats and Republican both agreed.  But when they make money, oh, we must let them prey on the people, and avoid all the tax they can!  Banker contracts = ""sacred""  UAW contracts, government employee retirements = shredder.  (By the by, there are still trillions of toxic Big Bank waste in almost every worker retirement account.)  Brutal capitalism for the middle class and poor.  The best Obama can do is raise the federal government minimum wage to $10 something an hour.  Do you know anyone who can feed even one child and rent a shoebox for 10 bucks an hour?

So much of the film supposedly talks about socialism but no one ever says what it is.  Can we please have a German, or French, or Fin, or Swede or Norwegian or Dane, Indian, Argentine, Mexican, Brazilian, .. socialist come and tell us how well these ideas are doing in Europe or Latin America or Asia?  There really is a lot going on right now that has raised the living standards for most of the world.  And yet our leaders, well, we keep falling and they keep yelling Boo, Boo, Scary Socialism.  Look anywhere but at the possible solutions that are working all over the world.  Most of the world has embraced socialist democracy.  And it doesn't look anything like Mao, or Stalin.

If this was suppose to be a movie about the value of debate and intellectualism it is a failure.  Please, some filmmaker be good enough to get some intellectuals in a room and let really debate the value of being anti-intellectual.  Only in this country do the politicians celebrate sports, arts, money, hair, fashion, cooking, socks, sex, skin, spying at the NSA, but sneer at the ""intellectual elite.""  And the most hypocritical part is almost every politician sneers about the elite, graduated from college with a degree, something that only 6.7 % of the entire world has the privileged to do.  I'd love to see that debate.  John Steward could moderate.",1392336000,,4747,4.659036144578313
