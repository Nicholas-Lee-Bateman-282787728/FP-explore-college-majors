7906283,5,B00000F10X,"I really enjoyed Creatures Fantastic: Spirits of the forest. This continues the excellent British series which features tales from various cultures about the Forest. There is a beautifully filmed piece about Gawain and the Green Knight, and an excellent feature about the Witch Babayaba.
I recommend this video for students of myth, and myth enthusiasts which would like to take a closer look at myths and cultural beliefs about the forest and its mythic denizens.
Because of scenes of violence and death, I would recommend this video for teenagers and adults.",1058400000,,560,5.164835164835165
