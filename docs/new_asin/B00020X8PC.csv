This is more of a slow moving drama which explores the psychological aspects of grief. I do not mean it is explores the grief from a clinical standpoint, in fact while the idea of seeing a therapist is included in the movie it is not a main topic. It explores the grief of the two boys by observing them.

The parents in the movie die less than seven minutes after the movie begins and from there the movie deals with the aftermath of the death of the parents. Both nineteen-year-old Vincent and his younger brother Lucien (who is about eleven or twelve) must deal with the grief of suddenly and unexpectedly losing both parents in one night. They deal with their grief in very different ways which brings both interdependence and conflict to their household as well as their relationships with others.

Vincent is determined to retain custody of Lucien despite the fact that he is still attending school himself and his belief that the social worker is determined to have Lucien taken away. His worries about finances, custody and generally how to be a guardian to Lucien lead to depression, which leads to other problems including acting out sexually and a noticeable weight loss. The weight loss is noticeable to other characters in the movie who mention it, I did not notice that the production of the movie made any real effort to make him look thinner in the movie.

Lucien on the other hand handles his grief with denial, he has a fantasy life in which his parents are in Italy. This denial leads to lying to everybody who does not know that his parents are dead, which somehow includes everybody at school including his best friends, teachers and the headmaster. This lack of knowledge of the accident by so many people seems a little beyond belief to me, but makes for an interesting double life in the movie. His acting out also expands to petty theft. Some of his thoughts of his parents include the idea of joining them. These thoughts are sometimes expressed in letters he writes to his parents.

Overall I did enjoy the movie, while slow moving the plot did hold my interest.",1414108800,,2259,4.654135338345864
8020150,4,B00020X8PC,"LIFE AFTER ALL is not one of those films that I missed in the theatre and could not wait to see or one I saw and had to own. I'm not sure how I even became interested in the film. It's just one I stumbled upon either by reading the jacket in a video store or by viewing the trailer of another film.

Now if I were renting this film, I'd probably give it four stars (of five). It is a good evening's entertainment. It tells the story of two brothers, Vincent who is the oldest and Lucien who loose their parents in a car accident and the ways the two cope with the loss. The film is original. The opening scene depicts the family fighting and when Vincent confronts his father, we are certain we're meeting a spoiled brat who probably has a list of troubles. We soon realize that Vincent is not a troubled teen, the family is emotional, and the fighting may not mean all that much. This is not to say that Vincent does not feel guilty that his last words to his father were unkind, but he soon realizes he's a member of a high strung family. The film could easily be a troubled teen changes his ways after the death of his parents and realizes he has responsibilities, but it does not go in that direction. Instead Vincent is a typical teen who is a good student and has a promising future. He wants to do what is right but is overwhelmed by the changes in his younger brother. For an evening's rental it's a good take.

Now if you're planning on purchasing this film, keep in mind it's not a masterpiece of French cinema. If I judged it after purchasing it, I might be disappointed and would only give it three stars. I guess I'm pickier when more money is involved. The story has some weaknesses. The parents die in an accident and the father's drinking may be the cause. Yet Lucien is able to keep the whole matter a secret from his school. With a social worker involved, as well as the publicity that such a death would cause, is it realistic that no one at school or none of his friends' parents would not know about the death? Vincent has two intense relationships: one with his girlfriend and the other with a next door neighbor who is his late mother's best friend. The first is believable. A young man who is hormonally charged eager to enjoy the pleasures of adulthood no longer has parents who might restrict his behavior. He could have such an intense relationship with the girlfriend, but the neighbor is far fetched and with the background music that accompanies the times they're together, it's hard to tell if it's serious or a joke. The film also has an ending that seems to easy for me, especially in a French film, but of rearranged a bit would add a tension that could make this a better film.",1147132800,4,2712,4.336614173228346
8020151,4,B00020X8PC,"La vie quand mme (LIFE AFTER ALL) is another film in a series collectively called 'Tales from the Orphanage'.  The story is simple on the surface (children coping with the sudden loss of parents), but in the hands of writer Sophie Tasma and director Olivier P&eacute;ray this storyline unfolds a tale of brotherly love that is well worth watching.

The film opens with a family argument between father (Laurent Olm&eacute;do) and mother (Franoise Michaud), a scene that is apparently routine in this disturbed household.  But this time the couple's two children 18-year-old Vincent (Mathieu Tribes) and 11-year-old Lucien (Maxime Monsimier) not only overhear the fight but Vincent defies his father in a stringent manner.  The mother attempts to assuage the situation as the parents are leaving on a trip.  But once the parents leave they are killed in an accident and the two boys are informed of the abrupt loss.  Vincent loves Lucien and vows to remain his legal guardian so that Lucien will not be placed in a foster home or orphanage.

The two boys react differently to their new life without parents: 1) Vincent begins to sleep with his girlfriend Jessica (Cl&eacute;mence Po&eacute;sy) and at the same time tries to lose his thoughts in a consignation with longtime neighbor Marion (Marianne Basler), all the while dealing with social workers, convincing them he is a fit guardian for Lucien. and 2) Lucien begins to act out his pain in antisocial behavior, following a delusional path that his parents are not only still alive but are still at home with Lucien and Vincent.

How each brother works through the guilt (Vincent) and broken spirit (Lucien) of the loss of their parents forms the line of the conclusion of the film.  The power of brotherly love is palpable and manages to provide avenues of coping with tragic loss.

The film's weakness is in the pacing of the story with too much time being devoted to Vincent's escapades and insufficient development of Lucien's character and transformation.  Despite these flaws this is a touching film of significant situational reactions played in a realistic manner. In French with English subtitles.
