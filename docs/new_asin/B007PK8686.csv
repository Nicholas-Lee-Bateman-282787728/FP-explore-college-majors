5103084,5,B007PK8686,"Absolutely love this sitcom. Every Becker episode should be memorialised on DVD. Incredibly funny. The upper echelons of clever comedy. Real NY style humour, raw and clever.",1342310400,4,173,5.444444444444445
5103085,2,B007PK8686,"I really like Becker so I will keep this release as there may not be another but, I am very disappointed in the technical release of this set. The stupid black rectangle box appears in the Ex-Files episode. I already had that with the copy I made from a tv showing. And no controls on the dvd to change Viewing rating. Becker the show, 10 stars out of 5. Who ever put this dvd release together 1 star. Personal note: if Becker was a real doctor and lived near me, I would search him out to be my doctor. I did love the Sizzle reel, the cast interviews, the audience warm up reel, and the gag reel. Sure I could have said extras or special features but this gives more information, Those I give 5 stars. I have not watched all the set yet but if it is as good as what I have watched it will not be a downer for me, except the black rectangular box. For the record ""The Pilot"" and ""Subway Story"" are my two favorites of the series, but I liked them all.",1341532800,2,951,4.0638297872340425

5103087,3,B007PK8686,"I'm so glad to see this release!  Been waitin' quite awhile for this season to finally show up.  But the fact that they're MOD discs is worrying me.  The description says MOD may not play on ur computer's drive or DVD recorder.

Does anyone have any experience with MOD discs??  Any feedback would be greatly appreciated!!",1340841600,3,322,4.678571428571429

a great season of a superb show; the final episodes make me sad though at the loss of Reggie",1338681600,3,161,3.909090909090909
5103089,4,B007PK8686,"Like my review title says, it is just that. I bought S3 2 years or so ago, and the only way I watched Becker episodes I didn't have were S6 episodes. I am one of the biggest fans of this show, so after S4 comes out, hopefully S5-6 will soon follow.",1337040000,,248,3.8823529411764706

5103091,5,B007PK8686,"Finally!!! I was worried this was never going to be released. Season 4 carries on where the very stong first 3 seasons left off. Can't wait to get this in my hands. Glad to see Bob as part of the main cast on the cover shot. A shame this is the last season with Reggie....Dave Hackel, what on earth were you thinking??!!

Can't wait for a release date to be set.",1336003200,4,362,4.098591549295775
5103092,4,B007PK8686,"I've been wondering about the release of these shows myself. I almost went and bought bootleg copies and that would have been a disaster...
This is a great show and I'm surprised at the long wait we have to endure. But I have bought thru amazon movies manufactured on demand discs and the quality was fine.
I guess we'll see how well they do here...",1335916800,4,349,4.384615384615385
5103093,5,B007PK8686,"This is one of my favorite seasons!  Yahoo!!  I hope season five will be released soon after.  The cast is hitting on all cylinders in this season.  Though I've read some unflattering things about manufactured on demand items, I'm hoping to have a good experience with this release.  I'll probably try to find a way to make a back-up just in case these don't ""weather"" well.",1335830400,4,374,4.606060606060606

The only bad thing about season 4 is it is pricey and it doesn't have an auto play feature to watch the entire disk. You have to select each show to play.
There hasn't been a show on TV this funny since it went off the air!",1457568000,,241,3.7450980392156863

5103124,3,B007PK8686,"$32 for a DVD-R that doesn't have the ""Play All"" option of the first 3 seasons.  I knew it was DVD-R going in, so that, I just have to accept.  Unfortunately, this seems to be the only way other than pirating, to get this season and the two that follow.  I guess CBS just didn't see the point in continuing with the releases of the last 3 seasons of this series.  No ""Play All"" feature is an oversight that is aggravating and could have been added with minimal effort.  Also, the first three seasons have the episode chapters synched so that you can skip to the end of the opening intro and go right to the start of the episode.  This has ventured away from that.  Overall I'm happy to have this set because I like this show.  I'm not thrilled to have to pay premium prices for a product that has cut corners, rather than kept up with the standards set by its predecessors.",1453248000,2,873,4.248484848484848

5103144,5,B007PK8686,This sitcom/series ROCKED. Ted Danson finally found his niche. Up until Regi and Bob were replaced it was a great comedy. The replacements for Regi and Bob sucked. I loved it when Bob would speak of himself as the 3rd person. It was just too funny. That fat dude who replaced Bob just was not funny. Regi was great too. Her replacement just didn't cut it. And that's when the show started to slip when Regi and Bob departed. Most of been contract issues with the producers of the show why Regi and Bob were replaced. Bad decisions on their part replacing no matter what the money issues were. It's always about money. That series could of gone on forever had they kept Regi and Bob. And Regi was better looking too than her replacement.,1440633600,,736,4.45925925925926

5103183,5,B007PK8686,"Becker series makes me smile and feel warm and fuzzy.  The thing I find the most interesting is the person who chose the people for the parts is an absolute genius.  This series falls in line with Soap, Taxi, Cheers, Seinfeld and all the other exceptional comedies in the past.  There is CERTAINLY nothing like it on TV today, such a shame.  The humorous programs today are stupid and that's why I watch Becker OVER AND OVER AND OVER.  I never, ever get tired of watching Becker and I  watch it before I go to sleep and have a big smile on my face.  I know I must feel better in the morning after watching Becker.  This is a genius series.  Also, to be able to watch from the beginning to the end without commercials is just too good to be true.  Enjoy.",1417910400,,753,4.2027972027972025

5103226,4,B007PK8686,"More of the same until towards the end of this series when a new soon to be regular character, Chris, played by Nancy Travis is introduced.  I can't add anymore than what others say, other than, if you liked the first 3 series, you'll like this as well.  The ensemble cast is what makes the show work, as with most successful TV series and again, they are strong and vital members of the show.  Recommended.",1387324800,,407,4.4
5103227,5,B007PK8686,Its Becker. What else? A guy with a heart and a louder bark than bite with a great supporting cast playing his unique friends.

I've gone through two different Disc Sets for Season's 4 and 5 and in each set there are at least two of the three Disc that have damaged episodes. The damage is so back that nearly half to three quarters of two to three  episodes can't be viewed. Circular scratches are clearly visible and cover a long circular recorded area. Though Amazon is great about their return policy, having to go through the ordering and returning in attempts to get a good quality product is ridiculous. I have other CBS DVD recordings that are great, so don't know why these particular Becker Sets are so poor in quality.",1384646400,,639,4.508620689655173

It only plays on an old standalone DVD player which limits me to watching it in one place. Not at all what I expected and if it wasn't for the fact that I really like Becker, I would have returned it.

The Missteak episode is hilarious and one of the best of the series since it's not a typical episode and shows the characters interacting in a different way over a series of games put on by the newest addition to the cast, Chris.  And of course, it has the best, most cliff-hanging ending of any of the seasons in the series.  If you are a fan, you do not want to miss this season!",1370649600,,439,4.2023809523809526

So much so that you can put it in the collection and not think twice about it.  Others claim that it does not play or that one dvd did not work, I had No issues at all. I have a off the shelf dvd player with no bells and whistles and the discs played Flawless.  Yes it does not have a ""play all"" feature but so what! You get to have 4th season that you cannot get any place else.  Picture quality and sound are crisp and clean, and do not look like copied off of tv.

5103273,4,B007PK8686,"GREAT DVD, continuing in the tradition of the earlier releases
John Becker is impatient as ever, Bob is slimy as usual
Plots are original - the one of Becker crashing pancake day was great, and typically John, but as with most eps, the writers go one step further, so there is a surprise
Only regret is the series stopped and the DVDs take forever to be released.",1361836800,,363,4.432835820895522

I have the first three seasons of Becker, which are of excellent product quality

I had to return the fourth season because its quality is that bad that it even does not has closed caption.

The quality of picture and sound are as bad as a pirate copy, and for the price, I really prefer to wait until they bring something better. I sent it back.

Would I recommend this product? Definitively NOT !",1361664000,6,592,4.212389380530974

5103288,4,B007PK8686,"Although I love this show & will get season 5 when it comes out, season 4 is a bit weaker than the first 3 seasons. Moreover, the lack of a play all episodes feature in the menu was really disappointing & inconvenient.",1359072000,,218,4.214285714285714

It looks very professional, it has CBS logos on it and everything. I also love the special features.

I cannot wait for Season 5 and Season 6 dvd releases. I hope they are made soon!!!",1357776000,,345,3.971014492753623

5103294,5,B007PK8686,"I bought the ""Becker: Season 4"" set awhile back and I was thrilled that it finally saw the light of day on DVD!!!  I was worried b/c it is a Manufactured On Demand(MOD)product and I was afraid that these discs wouldn't play in either of my DVD players.  However, they played flawlessly in both of my DVD players.  Paramount DID NOT release these discs; they were released through Amazon's CreateSpace on DVD-R discs, which have the episodes, purple background, and ""Becker"" logo printed on top of the discs.  Amazon is THE ONLY PLACE you can purchase ""Becker: Season 4"" also, since I saw that a previous reviewer wasn't sure if Amazon was the only place to buy it.  Also, to answer another question in a previous review, these discs only include a list of episodes on the main menu.  If you have a DVD player that has the feature ""Play All"" on it, select it and you will be able to watch all episodes without having to select every single episode after they have ended from the main menu.  My el cheapo Coby DVD player has this ability and it worked like a charm.  Anyhow, Season 4 is one of the funniest seasons of ""Becker"", which include two of my favorite episodes, ""Breakfast of Chumpions"" and ""Missteaks"".  Unfortunately, this was the final season for Terry Farrell and her character Reggie, who was replaced by the ultra-annoying Nancy Travis as Chris.  Even though I don't care for Travis, I do want to see the rest of the series released, especially Season 5, which includes the episode ""Once Upon A Time"" where Margaret recalls her first days of working with Becker.  Anyhow, Season 5, which found ""Becker"" moving to the dreadful Sunday night at 8PM slot before the short-lived sitcom ""Bram and Alice"", contains 22 episodes, which would most likely be another 3 disc set due to the fact that it ran for an entire season.  In Season 6, Becker returned briefly on Wednesday nights at 9:30 following ""The King of Queens"" and only ran 13 episodes, which would likely only be a 2-disc set.  The series had originally been cancelled due to low ratings after Season 5, but was brought back at the last minute by CBS executives.  Had the series gone on with Terry Farrell, it would've ran much longer IMHO.  Once Farrell left, the show fell apart and lost steam quickly, due to Nancy Travis and her lack of chemistry with the rest of the cast.  Anyhow, I highly recommend purchasing ""Becker: Season 4"".  I promise you, you won't be disappointed and you'll laugh so hard you'll be in tears!!!",1357171200,2,2492,4.6145124716553285

5103297,5,B007PK8686,"A very interesting season with cameos by guests from ""Cheers"" and ""Three Men & A Little Lady"".  John Becker is full of contradictions, but that's what makes him so great and so typical NYC.  More Becker!!",1355961600,,204,4.638888888888889

5103300,4,B007PK8686,"Wicked happy season 4 was finally released and it was magnificent up to the point that Reggie leaves the show and the ultra bland Nancy Travis replaces her. She is horrible and kind of killed the formerly awesome chemistry the cast seemed to have. Hopefully, the on demand process can continue with other great comedies that have yet to appear in DVD format such as Still Standing, Yes, Dear and the remaining episodes of King of the Hill. I too had play ""issues"" at first that others have noted but a simple firmware update of my player immediately solved all of the problems and all 3 discs run flawlessly now...well, except for the Travis thing.",1355356800,2,648,4.643478260869565

I played Seasons 1-3 (sold separately as a set) without a problem.  I bought the 4th season separately.  Season 4 is packaged differently and the on-screen menu looks different which may indicate a different manufacturer.  Seasons 1-3 have the Paramount logo on the spine of the DVD case.  Season 4 does not.  I would suggest searching for a different manufacturer, if possible.  I have not done that yet.",1351728000,7,576,4.623762376237623

But now watching Season 4 again on DVD, I remember why our love for the show faded.

Something was lost in the magic when Nancy Travis joined the show.
THEN when both Regie and Bob were lost, that was the end.

I don't know what it is, but we really hated the Nancy Travis character on this show and feel the chemistry of the cast fell apart after she joined.

The DVD on demand plays fine although the main menu does not advance to the next show automatically , there is no PLAY ALL option and the discs sound a little louder than normal DVDs when spinning in the player",1346025600,2,670,4.2109375
