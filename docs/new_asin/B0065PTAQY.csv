4961340,4,B0065PTAQY,"This is a tough workout, really gets the blood pumping. I gave it only 4 stars because the video is a bit repititous, especially after you watch it several times; I wish there had been more trivia regarding the area, that made the video enjoyable, and took your mind off the pain! Great workout, but gets a little monotonous.",1401753600,,325,4.52542372881356
4961341,5,B0065PTAQY,"Excellent coaching, music, scenery, best overall of the spin DVD series. The I hour trek elapses amazingly fast due to the music insightful historical footnotes, and the coaching.",1399939200,2,179,5.428571428571429
4961342,3,B0065PTAQY,"ok - I'm new to indoor training - would rather have the wind in my face but dvd's seem to take a little boredom out of it. This DVD has a fatal flaw or two in my opinion - first the narrators work out should match the ride being filmed - otherwise whats the point. The other flaw is most all shots are looking backwards rather than from a helmet cam which would make you feel more like part of the pack and make you feel more like your ""out there""; still it's better than nothing and definitely better than watching a bunch of girls in leotards jumping up and down in  spin class with fake smiles. I would recommend this DVD as an intro to the indoor cycling world until your able to imagine your own hills while sitting on an indoor trainer.",1399507200,,742,4.152777777777778
4961343,1,B0065PTAQY,"Pretty boring video, good quality though but I was looking for something a little more fast paced with an instructor who is more energetic.",1397088000,2,139,4.833333333333333
4961344,5,B0065PTAQY,"When cold or rain forces you inside on the trainer, you can't beat NC scenery to motivate you to exercise.",1393372800,,106,4.35
4961345,4,B0065PTAQY,"So far really like this spinning DVD.  I think the tourism of N. Carolina though teamed up with the makers of this DVD as in the spinning DVD you will see many ""pop up"" facts about N. Carolina's history, not a negative just interesting..  So the DVD has a instructor option and one without.  I like this DVD because of the camera footage and an occasional head cam feed as well as the motivation instruction with music.  On the screen you are given the time of the ride as well at the bottom the RPE, Speed, MHR and time in the current interval.  Ride is an hour long and it gives a periodic completion map.  The instructor is good and gives good motivational as well as cycling tips throughout the hour in a soft woman's voice.  You don't hear the riders as that is dubbed out but just the trainer.  The first 20 minutes are a warmup along with the rest of the 40 minutes of different intervals to include seated uphills, standing uphill and other intervals for a good sustained workout.  Again highly recommended and is a well done video..  Much better in my opinion than the ""Spinervals"" (don't waste your time on that line),",1392940800,10,1128,4.432038834951456
4961346,5,B0065PTAQY,This was a great ride.  Loved being in the pack of the riders.  Loved how the screen displays how long intervals are and having the clock tic away the time.  It is very motivating and challenges one who is building endurance...,1389744000,7,227,4.487804878048781
4961347,5,B0065PTAQY,This is one of the top Spinning videos out there. Great coaching  and information to follow on the screen. Music in the back ground is upbeat. Did not like the Las Vegas Video,1386288000,,175,4.303030303030303
4961358,5,B0065PTAQY,I like this video. It makes spinning on my bike much more entertaining.  Good workout for me.,1417910400,,93,4.470588235294118
4961359,5,B0065PTAQY,"What an awesome spin DVD! I'm new to indoor riding so after purchasing my Sunny indoor cycle and getting accustomed to it I decided it was time to try out some spin DVDs. I purchased this one and ""Short & Sweet"" by Mindy Mylrea. Both are completely different but great in different ways. This North Carolina DVD replicates riding outside in a group ride and the other is more for a succession of 20 minute workouts on a spin bike. While I appreciate the simplicity of the Short & Sweet DVD, this N.C. one really makes me feel like I'm on the ride with the cyclists in the video, which pushed me that much more to complete the 1 hour ride. It's very well shot, excellently narrated by a knowledgeable woman guiding you through the ride and how you should be feeling during the various segments. The bonus fun facts and quotes in the video make a nice distraction during those longer segments. It's a great feeling at the end of the workout when you think you've actually done a group ride through the countryside. The bonus for me too is that the area in the video looks a lot like the roads I ride on here in Sumner Co, TN so it made it that much more comfortable. I highly recommend this DVD to any cyclist that chooses to ride indoors in the colder months!",1417651200,,1258,4.334745762711864
4961360,5,B0065PTAQY,"I love the guided workout and the sense of travelling in a formatted pack.  I would recommend this workout for anyone who's a novice or professional spinner.  The route was well laid out and verbal direction very helpful.  It rates on my scale along with ""The Rockies"" and ""The Southern California"" DVDs.",1414368000,,304,4.8076923076923075
4961361,4,B0065PTAQY,"I had been out of spinning for about a year and a half. I like the scenery and it made it easy to get my out of shape body back into it. I turned off the commentary as I like to get into a zone and it's terribly distracting for me. The ""trivia"" and ""quotes"" that appear I could do without.",1412640000,,289,3.7540983606557377
4961362,2,B0065PTAQY,The resolution isn't great and it appears pretty dated. It's better to use old Tour de France recordings when looking for something to watch when spinning. Just DVR the Tour de France episodes and watch an hour at a time when riding. This is free.,1411344000,8,247,4.511111111111111
4961363,5,B0065PTAQY,Love this DVD!  Gets the heart rate going and an awesome hour workout!,1408924800,,70,4.384615384615385

4961366,5,B0065PTAQY,"My at home spinning workouts so far consist of seven dvd workouts, all by Mad Dogg.  This has quickly become my favorite workout for many reasons.  I love the format.  You are riding with a group of about six riders on real North Carolina roads.  The views are taken from fore and aft helmet cams, and you are riding the exact same terrain as the riders, which is nice.  On the left will occasionally be a map of the full 25 mile circuit, colored in red as you complete the distance.  On the bottom right is a countdown for each and every interval you are riding, which is an awesome way to break up the hour.  That interval timing is probably my favorite feature, and makes the ride seem to go by very fast, as opposed to the Rides:Ireland video, which has a single countdown for the entire ride continually visible, and makes the ride seemingly last forever.  Highly recommended.",1406246400,9,881,4.4625

8493519,5,B0065PTAQY,"I really like this kind of spinning DVD.  It has some goofy facts about NC that I appear to memorize, but I like how it gives you a narrator and on the bottom of the screen it gives you the countdown of the type of pedaling - standing climb, seated flat, etc.",1448582400,,259,3.980769230769231
8493520,5,B0065PTAQY,"Excellent training video for spin bike. Trainer has a pleasant voice and the scenery in the video is great. Good work-out. Not really suited to indoor trainers, specific to spin bike.",1433376000,,183,4.935483870967742

8493523,3,B0065PTAQY,"I ordered this based on reviews of this video vs. reviews of other videos. Not worth the money. First, the video is too often from in front of the group looking back at them, and sometimes behind the group looking ahead at the group. Honestly, the entire video should've been shot from a camera on the handlebars of one of the riders. That would've made this video awesome! I like the ones on youtube that are shot with a GoPro from the handlebars of one of the riders. Make a video like that, and with a huge flat screen TV and my spinner, well that would be awesome!",1424649600,4,568,4.268518518518518
8493524,4,B0065PTAQY,It's way better than the annoying spin class videos with the techno pop music in the background,1423180800,,95,4.647058823529412
8493525,3,B0065PTAQY,The views are not as stunning as originally thought.  I would have liked to see more countryside instead of the other riders.,1422835200,,125,4.681818181818182
8493526,2,B0065PTAQY,"You ride in the pack, behind the pack, then you are in the front looking back at the pack most of the time. Your on a bike and should be looking at the road ahead and looking around.",1418947200,,182,3.8157894736842106
