8273272,2,B0019BERJE,"This is the full address given by President John F. Kennedy at Rice University in September, 1962, and it is one of his best and yet most overlooked speeches of his presidency. In it, he justifies our need as a nation to lead the exploration of space, and also gives a fascinating ""history lesson"" in the process. Apparently, this is a rare video to get, but I was disappointed in the relatively poor video quality nonetheless. Not horrible, just not as good as it should be, for certain. But the complete speech is here, and it is worth having for JFK fans and those who study the history of the early 1960s. Had I known that the video quality would be this ""shaky"", I might have just opted to have the Audio version, which I believe is available on the JFK Library website.",1282953600,,775,4.426573426573427
