280294,2,6300251330,"Kirk Douglas, Harvey Keitel, and Farrah Fawcett are ""lost in space"" in a horrible film about two astronauts terrorized by a robot with a human personality. Think ""The Brain that Wouldn't Die"" transplanted into one of the Terminator skeletal frames robots and you get the picture.
I'll let you figure out which of the two male actors is 1/2 of the romantic couple and which one is the ""mind"" behind the malevolent machine.
It gets two stars because Douglas and Fawcett compliment each other.",1046908800,2,490,4.845238095238095
280295,3,6300251330,"This is a bit of a misunderstood sci-fi flick ' not flawless, but worth a second look.
In a floating space station near Saturn, we meet Harvey Keitel's character, Benson, or 'The Captain'. Or is he really somebody else? In the first few minutes, he murders a pilot preparing to leave for a remote colony on Saturn's third moon. Taking the dead pilot's place, mission and cargo, Benson braves the rings of Saturn and arrives on Saturn 3, where Major Adam (Kirk Douglas) and the fetching Alex (Farrah Fawcett) are developing hydroponics-grown food for a struggling Earth. It's not just work for Adam and Alex, and Benson's arrival disrupts the family unit that the two have made for each other. Adam came to space to escape Earth (which we're supposed to assume is made unpleasant perhaps by pollution, war or simply the vast numbers that must be crowding it up by then). Alex has never known Earth, which only highlights their apparent generation gap. Benson begins desiring Alex well before he actually gets around to his purported mission, and he figures that Adam's age gives him the edge (monogomay is frowned upon back on Earth, he tells her). It turns out that Benson has come to construct a robot to replace the team's now obsolescent half - Adam, and in this, he throws himself full steam. Benson is so obsessed to complete the menacing robot which will replace Adam, that you begin to wonder which of his loves really rules his dark soul: Alex or the robot. When completed, the vaguely humanoid machine stands about 8 feet high, moves convincingly and menacingly robot-like and is topped with an incongruous thing that looks like a desk lamp. Called Hector, the robot's CPU is a large clear can containing what looks like human brain matter. Not talkative at the outset, the machine (a model ominously called a 'demigod') picks up fast when linked into Keitel's brain through a remote sensor Keitel implants into the base of his own spine (a striking precursor to the decades-newer ""Matrix""). Unfortunately, the neural link also gets the 'bot past the firewall guarding Benson's soul, and we learn through the robot a dark thing or two about Benson - notably that he failed a probably important course, likely one meant to ensure that artificial intelligence would never be tainted by interface with a natural-born psychotic. Unsurprisingly, the machine not only becomes psychotic as well, but decides that Benson is an obstacle to be replaced much as Benson had planned for Adam. Soon, Adam and Alex are on the run from Hector, learning to quickly duck in and out of hydraulic doors and weave through cramped ventilator shafts.
This was a pretty slim flick which gets more mileage than it should out of Farrah Fawcett. Her character is vulnerable and compulsively dependent throughout the movie, never displaying the resourcefulness that Sigourney Weaver had established for a new generation of sci-fi heroines in 'Alien' (which came out the year before). Alex has to be the last female character to faint out of fear in a sci-fi film.  We never get an insight into Keitel's character either - obsessed with both Hector and Fawcett. The two can't both be paramount in his mind. You get the idea that to Benson, the robot is just a means to get Alex; but there are scenes when Keitel tries to get into the robot's head, making it a more substantial part of his own psyche. It's incredible to think that Martin Amis had anything to do with this story which, among other things, is strikingly unsurprising. (Case in point: when first demonstrated, Hector crushes a can Benson had ordered the robot to give Adam. There isn't a person on the planet who couldn't guess Kirk Douglas's response: 'I'm glad you didn't tell him to shake my hand.')
On the plus side, the visuals are nice. The sets were obviously influenced by Alien at the time, but today look more like a cross between the drab utilitarian interiors of that film and the way-out futurism of visionary artist Chesley Bonestell (the space station, ships and starscapes recall the famous artist's vision) and the thin story will keep you watching - just not that much.  But above all, the real attraction is Harvey Keitel - who speaks in a very precise accent.  It's Keitel as you've never seen him before (with a cool euro-looking ponytail).  You know that the robot will go for him first, and his loss is what kills this film as much as his presence gives it a life that (like the robot) it doesn't really deserve.",1042588800,4,4479,4.775483870967742
280296,4,6300251330,"John Barry and Stanley Donen's misunderstood sci-fi brainchild was panned on initial release, but happily is coming under re-evaluation in a later age.
Kirk Douglas and Farrah Fawcett run a hydroponics lab on Saturn's third moon, Titan, which helps feed an overcrowded and progressively more sociopathic Earth.  Douglas and Fawcett are ""paired,"" though not actually married (or at least it is never understood that they are), she being an innocent naif who has never seen Earth and lived virtually her entire life with him, and he a disillusioned older man who never desires to see Earth again  -  though he encourages her to visit their home planet one day, if for no other reason than to further Fawcett's natural development.
Earth has decided that Douglas will soon be ""obsolete,"" and sends captain Harvey Keitel to assemble a robot to eventually run Saturn 3.  Keitel, however, is actually an impostor  -  he was washed out of the robot programming division because he was ""potentially unstable,"" and, proving the point, murdered the man given the assignment in order to take his place.  The reason is never stated, but the implication is strongly present  -  given his immediate fascination with Fawcett  -  that he wanted the assignment in order to be closer to her.
The robot  -  ""Adam""  -  has a human brain, directly programmed by Keitel.  Since Keitel is a homicidal psychopath...well, you get the picture.  It isn't long before Saturn 3 becomes a battleground for supremacy with a mad metal titan.
This is really a great movie, if flawed.  The ending is too abrupt.  Douglas sometimes seems uncomfortable in his role, or acts as if he is in a different movie than Keitel and Fawcett.  The special effects are uneven, though generally pretty impressive.
But the script is solid and the suspense never lets up.  The action is pretty gripping, shooting out of a gun from the first scene, when Keitel coldly murders the astronaut whose place he is taking by flushing him out into space.  The production is gorgeous, and unified.  The sets are beautiful, and incredibly colorful.  The matte shots for space and Saturn hearken back to 1950's pulp magazine covers.  The costuming is futuristic, but functional.  And the robot, Adam, is a nightmare out of Leonardo da Vinci's sketchbooks of human anatomy.  The terrific music score, by Elmer Bernstein, is mechanistically haunting.
A great movie it isn't, but it is very good.  There is a nice undercurrent of human feeling to this film, which is emphasized by the contrast of the warm and loving relationship between Douglas and Fawcett with the predatory intrusion of the coldly sociopathic Keitel.
This is wonderful sci-fi pulp, and if that's what you're in the mood for, you won't be disappointed.",1023062400,37,2755,4.956331877729258
280297,4,6300251330,"This is probably one of the most neglected ScFi flicks ever made. Despite a stellar cast, it was largely ignored when it was released in 1980. What interests me now is that the film seems to have influenced James Cameron on both Terminator and Aliens. In fact several scenes are very similar. The destruction of the Psychotic robot Hector and the scene where the soldier from the future blows up the Terminator are very similar. In Saturn 3 the robot chases the two main characters around trying to catch them through the floor grate. That seems very similar to several scenes in Aliens. I've never seen any comment by Cameron that this film influenced him, but it seems hard to miss.
Even if you are not interested in the connection to Terminator or Aliens, this is worth getting. The reproduction to this DVD is excellent. The only thing that keeps me from giving it 5 stars is that it is a bit slow at times and, other than Harvey Keitel, the acting is a bit. . .well, not up to either the standards of Kirk Douglas or Farrah Fawcett. I'm not being snide either, I consider both excellent actors.",1014422400,47,1099,4.527638190954774
280298,5,6300251330,"Despite what critics have said about Saturn 3, I think it is a very good science fiction film. Another good meshing of science fiction and gothic horror. It may seem like a futuristic version of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, however, it is still a very good film. One of the many best that ITC Entertainment has ever produced. It goes to show you that the British are one of the best film industries in the world.
This was the first R-rated film I ever saw, and I was amazed at how the film looked as well as the storyline, and special effects. Most of all, the acting, costumes, sets, the works. The film tells the story about a couple who work on one of Saturn's moons, developing a new hydroponics system for a starving Earth. The old man(played wonderfully by Kirk Douglas)is someone who has rejected Earth and its way of life. The young woman(played really well by Farrah Fawcett)is someone who was born on a colony and has never seen or been to Earth. Along comes a terrorist(played by the ever great Harvey Keitel), who has originally murdered the original pilot who has come to Saturn 3, to help the two scientists get back on schedule. As part of that help, he builds a robot, the first in its series, named Hector. Unfortunately, due to the pilot's instability, the robot becomes a threat and starts a rampage, which forces the two scientists to sacrifice everything they have in order to survive and overcome the odds. Plus the old man making the ultimate sacrifice.
It may be a bit like Ridley Scott's masterpiece, ALIEN, however, Saturn 3 is still a very good and entertaining film. Not only with a wonderful soundtrack by The Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, but with its solid storyline and plot. If you enjoy science fiction, be sure to check this film out. It's certainly better than Star Trek and its spinoffs, let alone the film Supernova. It even has a nude scene with Farrah Fawcett that's pretty good too.",971827200,42,1923,4.642228739002933

Their idyllic little existence is shattered  when Harvey Keitel stops by with his big, badass robot-in-a-box, Hector, in  tow. Between salivating over Farrah and plotting how to get into her pants,  Harvey assembles Hector, and the two share minds for a while, effectively  indoctrinating Hector to the wild woolly world of Harvey's bad manners,  general evil, and a supreme desire to knock boots with Farrah.",967939200,15,657,5.1415094339622645

280388,3,6300251330,"Knowing that this came after Ridley Scott's Alien masterpiece, it's understandable that studios then would want to cash in on the outer space horror theme. This is definitely a knock-off. Honestly, the plot is barely worth explaining. SPOILER: An military reject tricks his way into visiting a food development station on a deserted moon (I think). Kirk Douglas is the older man in charge of the station, along with his girlfriend, Farrah Fawcett. The reject is played by Harvey Keitel, and he brings a surprise helper -- a tall, metallic, humanoid robot with glowing pointy things for eyes. Kooky Keitel is lacking in all manner of social graces and emotions, and he has a connection port in the back of his neck -- very much like The Matrix (hmmm). So, guess what happens when kooky reject's brain connects to the robot.... There's only 3 people in the plot, and the violence has a little bit of gore that is not convincing, but is otherwise gross for kids, I would think. Farrah looks pretty, but doesn't do much other than serve as the damsel in distress. Douglas puts in some physical stunts and shows off his middle-aged but still decent-looking body. It was interesting to see him him again since he was just on Golden Globes and looked unable to be mobile on his own, and his speech is affected by a stroke, or so I'm told. There's a deleted scene on YouTube where Farrah puts on a ridiculous disco-sex-kitten outfit and the two of them get high off of pills. It's very unlike the rest of the film, so probably good that they took it out. Sexual attraction is the real monster at the end of the day, according to this film. The robot is the star of the movie, and as a autonomous character, it is mostly believable the way it was filmed, other than it's plodding movements. At some point, it dawned on me that the robot is so tall because there's a person inside there. I'm so accustomed to seeing unconvincing computer graphics being used in movies at this point, that an actor inside a monster suit doesn't even register anymore. Again, there's no point to this movie other than to have a lot of sets with Farrah and some violence, and a smidge of science fiction.",1515888000,,2174,4.576923076923077

This movie is one of few masterpieces that is able to be funny with no intention of being funny or making fun of itself. Yes I said masterpiece. This movie is able to incorporate nearly every cliche of the time: extremely overt sexuality is always good, introduce tech in the story and explain it to the idiot audience, evil robot, advanced culture = drugs to fix everything, etc. And it was all done in good faith.

Plot holes and bad dialog/acting fill this movie completely to the point of laughable. Watching Farrah Fawcett act is pretty painful as always though watching her strut around in revealing garb is nice.
Kurt Douglass comes off as a creepy old man who seems to have FF on this base for nothing more then being a sex slave.
One of the biggest problem is the plot and how the movie is set up in the beginning.  They never answer the question on why Captain Benson kills Captain James to take his place in delivering and setting up this robot on Saturn 3. This is how the movie starts out and yet through the rest of the film, nothing comes of it as though it never happened. No one seems to notice that the original captain was murdered and this guy took his place for like weeks on Saturn 3. Really ridiculous.
And lets talk about that robot. This thing is a hulking mass of metal and moves as slow as a sloth. Its comedic to watch them run around in terror and fear when its painfully obvious there are many ways to run circles around it and disable it.

Fortunately for the revered star, he isn't alone. In fact, Douglas' name is listed after Farrah Fawcett. Yes the blonde-maned tv p.i. of Aaron Spelling's ""Charlie's Angels"" and spouse of small screen cybernetic spy Lee Majors. She is gorgeous but her acting in this film is limp and lifeless--not that her efforts on the small screen have ever been worthy of an Emmy.
  Fawcett and Douglas star as Alex and Adam--calling her Eve would no doubt have prompted more than a few eyes to roll among those who were involved in the production--who reside on a quiet and cozy Eden-like laboratory called Saturn 3. They are scientists who live alone, save for a cute Toto-like dog and a few robots that appear to have been pieced together from Erector sets, on the ringed planet. In the lab they work on ways to solve the food problems plaguing Earth. Benson (Harvey Keitel, whose New York tough voice has been replaced with that of someone else}, arrives at the lab just after murdering the pilot chosen for the mission. He brings a robot along to make operations more efficient just as communications to and from the Saturnian outpost cease for a few weeks due to a cosmic phenomenon.
  Benson is quite taken with Alex, which greatly angers Adam. Benson constructs the robot, an impressive-looking cyborg inspired by Leonardo DaVinci's anatomical artwork, named Hector. Hector too becomes infatuated with Alex. Though the robot can't speak--if it had any intelligence, it would want out of this movie; or at least demand a salary equal to the three stars for time and effort. Hector would seem to be the star as its likeness has been on the posters for the film. The film has it all: voyeurism, death, sex, drug use, and animal cruelty. One should also add bad acting to the many transgressions depicted in this travesty produced by Sir Lord Lew Grade, has previously brought us such small screen fare as ""The Saint"" and ""The Muppet Show."" Stanley Donen's low-Grade effort is proof that though Skylab crashed to earth some months ago, there is even bigger space junk out there. Barry never got a chance to witness the nightmare his vision would become. Sadly the same can't be said for those who will see Saturn 3, Stanley Donen's sonambulistic sci-fi effort makes such recent cosmic clunkers as Star Trek: The Motion Picture and Disney's update of 20,000 Leagues under the Sea, The Black Hole, look better.",1472774400,,2853,4.816326530612245

280554,2,6300251330,"I wanted to give this movie at least three stars. I watched the movie last night and although I would not want Hector to greet me at the top of the stairs, that's where the fun and goosebumps ended for me. I saw this movie on the late late show years ago and wondered this time if some scenes were cut from last night's version. Clearly the brief nudity in a shower scene was cut. But why was the captain on Saturn 3? He stated it was to build Hector to get the alternative food source program back on track. I suppose once the captain got a look at tanned and toned Alex, he thought he'd help himself to a little something too. The dialogue was a bit silly at times, the sequences were disjointed, and no one cared what happened to the dog, really. I love Kirk Douglas and he gave it his all in characterization and physical strength and agility. Farrah Fawcett's acting was straight out of Charlie's Angels. It was hard to believe at this point she would garner raves for The Burning Bed and Extremities later. She pranced around either semi-nude, in jogging suits or a flowing white see-through sheet. The special effects were quite good for 1980. The set of Saturn 3 was extensive, filled with assorted mechanical gadgets, and lots of robotics. When we see the research Adam and Alex were attempting, when not in bed together, it is easy to see why Hector was necessary. I cannot say the ending was predictable. There is mild violence and some blood. No real sex scenes either, which I appreciate. I recommend seeing this movie. Why not? There are worse films out there. Definitely not on par with Star Wars but what the heck. And who can forget ""wheal and peditate?""",1457827200,2,1671,4.481967213114754

280571,3,6300251330,"THE STORY (contains spoilers): A mentally unbalanced astronaut (Harvey Keitel), kills a space pilot and impersonates him in order to gain access to the remote food research facility of Saturn 3. Once there, he meets innocently beautiful scientist Farrah Fawcett and her work & life partner, the aging but still rugged Kirk Douglas. Harvey gets the hots for Farrah (who wouldn't?!?) and blatantly asks for a little nookie. (Apparently on Earth you can have sex with anyone you want no questions asked, so naturally ol' Harvey thinks he's got it made.) Farrah has no desire to boink this guy and she shuts him down cold. The twitchy sexaholic doesn't take this rejection too well, however, and sets about assembling ""Hector,"" a prototype humanoid robot to act as his electronic enforcer. To make matters worse, Hector gets his programming directly from Harvey's brain via a physical interface coupling at the base of Harvey's skull. In essence, Hector soon has all of horny Harvey's unbalanced thoughts & carnal desires, so you can guess where that's gonna lead. Understandably, neither Farrah nor Kirk are too thrilled to have robo-lunk Hector shambling about the complex and they want both the man and his machine gone. And things just get uglier from there.

THOUGHTS: The best thing about this British production, regrettably, are the innovative set designs. The Saturn 3 complex is really cool-looking, featuring several non-traditional designs for doors, portals and living and working quarters. The space craft designs are also unusual; bubble-shaped and insectoid-like, rather than the traditional flying discs or pointy space needles we're used to seeing. The cinematography is very shadowy & dark, with nice, color-saturated faces and extreme cross-lighting to help make everything look more menacing and creepy. Robot villain Hector is a visual feast for the eyes. His human-yet-alien design is extremely busy and engaging. The unsettling eye stalk pod atop the huge ""muscular""-looking body is very scary and threatening. Hector makes a thoroughly convincing mechanical menace, and can proudly take his place alongside the likes of HAL-1000 and The Terminator in the robotic sci-fi gallery of evil automatons. SATURN 3's story, however, is a dissatisfyingly disjointed affair, and because of it you are never quite as involved in the film as you ought to be. Still in all, the threat posed by Harvey & Hector feel real enough. The film would have almost no draw at all were it not for the strong performances from the three human leads. The tension escalates as the film moves along and it keeps you guessing to the very end, so I liked this film more than I didn't - if that makes any sense. LOL.

THE BLU-RAY: This Blu-ray / DVD combo release from Shout! Factory is a nice one. The picture is solid, with little or no pixelation or artifacting and not much in the way of video noise nor dirt & grit from the original film elements. The soundmix is strong and consistent. There are a few decent extras to be found, including an brief interview with Roy Dotrice (probably best-known as 'Father' from TV's ""Beauty & The Beast""), who was brought in after principal shooting to do a complete overdub of Harvey Keitel's voice, in order to make Harvey sound more British. Huh??? Very strange, but that was director Stanley Donen's idea. Weird and totally unnecessary, but it is what it is. There's also an interview with special effects director Colin Chilvers that has some interesting tidbits for fans of behind-the-scenes trivia. Additional footage edited into the broadcast TV airing is included separately, along with an extended version of the ""Ecstasy"" scene. The film's theatrical trailer, some TV ads and a still gallery are thrown in as well. I don't feel I missed much by not catching this first run or afterwards on cable TV, but it's nice to have finally seen this movie, and I'm glad to have it in my collection. I suspect it will be worth a re-watch every now & then. Overall... SATURN 3 was just okay, so I can only give the moody, space-horror film a modest 3 STARS.",1435968000,9,4087,4.956268221574344

As Saturn goes into eclipse they are cut off from the rest of the universe, and are menaced by Captain James and his homicidal robot Hector. When James is torn apart trying to disassemble it, the scientists are forced to battle it out for themselves and attempt to destroy it.

280575,3,6300251330,"S3 is a real curiosity. The three megastars would probably rather omit this from their screen credits. The viewer will either be mesmerized by the incredibly bad acting or hang in there thinking it will eventually get better. Let's examine why this doesn't work first.

The first problem that becomes evident is Harvey Keitel's voice... it's not his! HK obiously didn't stick around long after completion. The dubbing at least matches but Harvey's voice is so recognizable and integral to his acting style it's nearly impossible to comment on his performance.

Problem two is Farrah. I think it's been established that FF could turn out a convincing emotionally charged performance. She surprised her critics during the mid eighties showing a gift for playing vulnerable abused women pushed to their limit in Burning Bed and later in Extremities. She also revealed another level of her ability with the complex characterization in Small Sacrifices. Farrah quickly gained a new level of respect and became much more than eye candy... which is why S3 will be a step down for anyone acquainted with that aspect of her career. Here she's still on a level with her acting in Charlies Angels. It would be another couple of years before she would show what she was capable of.

Which brings us to problem three - Kirk Douglas. This is neither an underplayed or emotionally wrought Douglas. This is Douglas in limbo. It's hard to find words for his performance and it seems Douglas was having trouble as well. He spends the entire film trying to decide how to approach the character. Perhaps on the surface this looked liked perfect casting. Douglas' Adam is a sensitive yet virile older man who suddenly feels threatened by the arrival of another (younger) male to his environment and love interest. Unfortunately a situation ripe for emotional Douglas never sparks him to the occasion.

S3 does have several interesting concepts and themes underlying its glossy facade. The situation for one. You have a ""Knife in the Water"" type  scenario with abundant possibilities. As stated by another reviewer, you have several visuals that seem to inspire and undeniably make S3 an important rung on the ladder to modern action science fiction cinema but these engaging elements are mostly overshadowed by the strange (and at times embarrassingly bad) acting throughout.",1433635200,,2354,5.056701030927835

The sets are great and the actors are perfect and the visual effects are quite good for the time but  Hector is never as scary as he should be and the sense of isolation is never really obtained since Adam and Alex live an isolated existence anyway and love it. Being cut off from the earth for 22 days is no problem. Plus there is sexual tension between all the characters that never seems to go anywhere.. For an R-rated move, there is not much if anything to be shocked or titillated by. Just briefly in the third act is there a bit of real tension created and it speeds the movie to its conclusion. Also the final scene showing Alex heading to earth ratchets up the tension with an ominous musical cue...but we are given no clue why.

That said watching it I was reminded of better films from that period in the genre like ""Alien"", ""Silent Running"" and ""Demon Seed"". The film is prescient in its concepts of robotics and computer technology but these ideas were covered in more depth in other films.  High point would be the performance of Harvey Keitel as the maniacal Captain James/Hector.  Kirk Douglas as Adam(Get it?!) is appropriately robust and dashing.

""When the film was broadcast on NBC in mid-1984 certain scenes that had been edited from the original print had been restored: Adam offering to take Alex to Earth, Alex was voicing her concern to Adam about taking Hector outside of the complex, Adam taking Hector outside in the moonbuggy, Benson asking how Alex's eye was after her accident, Adam leaving Hector near the shuttle probe, Hector re-entering the colony and sabotaging the outer airlock mechanism to prevent Adam from coming back inside, an extended scene of Benson walking down a corridor, Adam trying to re-enter Saturn 3 and blowing the outer airlock door off with an explosive adhesive, an extended scene of Adam in the decontamination chamber, Alex voicing her worry that Hector might have killed Adam, Alex being dragged away by Benson and yelling at him, Adam embracing Alex and watching Hector drag away Benson's dead body, Adam holding a towel to his head after Benson had hit him with a pipe and claiming that ""Hector is no humpty-dumpty"", both Adam and Alex wondering how Hector managed to reassemble itself, and finally both Adam and Alex sharing a laugh over a humorous incident while hiding in the communications room. Additional music cues were also added to scenes involving the opening credits and Benson's death.""

For Adam and Alex, their only hope is to flee, but the homicidal robot stands in their way. Produced and directed by legendary filmmaker Stanley Donen (Singin In The Rain, Charade and Seven Brides For Seven Brothers), Saturn 3 is a pulse-pounding study in sci-fi suspense! Feel that pulse pound!

280748,5,6300251330,"It's hard to imagine a more peculiar choice of director for this sci-fi thriller than Stanley Donen. Donen made some great films in the 50s and 60s (Singin' In The Rain, Seven Brides For Seven Brothers, Charade), but here he's in disappointing form. Partly that may be due to the fact that the project was originally to be directed by John Barry, but Donen ""inherited"" the responsibility when Barry quit due to ill health. However, Donen should not be made to shoulder all the blame. The script by Martin Amis leaves the actors to contend with some bad lines and situations. Elmer Bernstein contributes a forgettable music score which is well below his usual standard. And even the actors - all of them talented - seem indifferent to the project. Kirk Douglas, for example, seems to have accepted the role simply to enjoy some saucy nude scenes with sexy co-star Farrah Fawcett.

Essentially, the story is a three-handed thriller (or, four-handed, if you count Hector the droid). Saturn 3 is Titan, the third moon of Saturn (hence the name), and it is here that scientists Adam and Alex (Douglas and Fawcett) live in blissful isolation, developing food supplies for people on Earth. Adam and Alex not only work together - they sleep and shower together too, which is a pretty enviable arrangement for Adam (who is about 30 years older than his sexy assistant). Into this perfect space oasis comes psychopathic Benson (Harvey Keitel), another scientist who has recently murdered a shuttle captain. Benson has brought with him a droid named Hector, supposedly to speed up the workload. However, Hector turns out to be a particularly unstable droid, particularly when the randy robot develops a liking toward Alex. Eventually it becomes clear that neither Adam nor Benson can control the droid, and with Hector determined to kill anyone who stands in the way of himself and Alex, that becomes something of a problem.......

If Saturn 3 is a story of jealousy and desire, then it needs more than a sex-starved droid to generate credibility. If it is a sci-fi actioner, then it needs more action. If it was conceived as a sci-fi thriller then it most assuredly needs more thrills. The film emerges as a rather muddled and unappealing mess, with flashes of eroticism and very sporadic flashes of action. It marks a low point in Donen's directorial career, and is too forgettable to be remembered as a significant sci-fi work. Most of the folks associated with this one probably don't give it pride of place on their CVs.",1390089600,,2514,4.857808857808858

The plot, or more-so, the arrangment of Kirk Douglas in a ridiculous role, takes place on Sheba, a moon of Saturn where there is a really old horny guy (Douglas), over the top as ever and his young sex slave (Facett), who does numerous nude scenes. This is so painful to watch because there is absolutely no chemistry between the two. Add a lousy Kietal in the ""mad scientist"" role and this goes even further into the stink pit.

You can really tell they built a huge sound stage to film the indoor scenes in.

Regarding the image quality of the blu ray itself, I can honestly say I was totally blown away!  I had read some glowing reviews of this blu ray before it was released and they were right...the movie looks fantastic.  I have no idea how this low budget, forgotten B-movie was adapted to look so stunning in HD to be honest (while big money makers like Top Gun and Predator look really bad on blu ray).

280775,4,6300251330,"After making do with a region 2 dvd (cropped image; no extras), I was surprised and relieved to see Saturn 3 finally getting a release 33 years after its theatrical run. Shout! Factory has come out with what is certainly the best release of Saturn 3 ever. This set includes two discs- one blu ray, one dvd. The blu ray image is excellent and sharp (Farrah and Hector look great; beautiful, eerie quasi-futuristic corridors of the moonbase), in widescreen with excellent sound, nicely balancing Hector's creepy sounds and Elmer Bernstein's odd, electronic/symphonic score. The blu ray extras are generous, including an interview with the English actor who dubbed Harvey Kietel's part in the film, an extended `blue dreamers' scene, and added scenes/bits from the network televised version of the film (though they're not of high quality). The commentary, though from fans of the film (Greg Moss of the Saturn 4 Fan Page; film critic David Bradley) as opposed to cast/crew directly involved with the film production, is informative (they certainly did their homework) and answers some questions I had about this troubled production (which Kirk Douglas made no mention of in his autobiography). There's also an interview with Colin Chilvers (who should have been on the commentary) concerning special effects and other matters(great robotic FX, admittedly so-so spaceship sequences; cast tensions).

Granted, some of the effects and dialogue may make more contemporary/CGI-savvy audiences cringe and scoff, but this may be a cult film for certain generations who watched it (or wanted to) back in 1980. Nothing seems to be missing here (compared to my old region 2 disc). All those hokey moments- three characters arguing over 'shared sex' ideas from terrible old Earth, spaceships flying through meteor-showered rings of Saturn (picture 'bread balls underwater'), all kinds of creepy and nasty things occur with the big, clumsy, tube-tied android Hector at its center, are on display, looking better than ever. Kirk Douglas is great as usual, Farrah is lovely but seemingly ditzy, and Harvey Keitel is creepy but not quite himself due to a robotic performance and dubbing. But...DO get hold of this sadly, nearly-forgotten semi-sexy sci-fi/horror flick and appreciate something you may have been too young to see at the time (as I had been). Loosen up and enjoy it- don't take it seriously!",1386201600,16,2388,5.21875
280776,3,6300251330,"Scream Factory brings 1980's sci-fi schlock-fest ""Saturn 3"" to Blu-ray for the first time. From its first shot of the underside of a space cruiser flying into the frame towards a planet, you feel the influences of ""Alien,"" ""Star Wars,"" and every other genre film of its type put out in the 1970s. The only difference is in the lower budget the studio had to spend on models, props, and other special effects.

Scientist Adam (Kirk Douglas) and his colleague/lover Alex are stationed on an experimental hydroponics research station on one of the moons of Saturn. Their peaceful existence is interrupted by the arrival of Captain Benson (Harvey Keitel). He's been sent to assemble a robot named Hector who will likely replace Adam in the hopes of making the station run more efficiently. It slowly becomes obvious the robot has a mind of its own. It will stop at nothing to take over the station and liberate itself from the control of any humans.

The high-definition audio and video transfers for ""Saturn 3"" help and hinder it in different ways. The picture is clean but doesn't lose its 1980's ""real film"" feel. However, the clarity doesn't necessarily help when it brings the budgetary limitations further into the light in regards to the outer space sequences and other visual effects. The audio is presented in 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio. There are all sorts of bizarre sounds and gadgets to take in, not to mention Elmer Bernstein's eclectic musical score.

""Saturn 3"" is rated R for violence, language, adult situations, drug use, and brief nudity. The brief nudity is basically a flash of Farah Fawcett's breasts and the butt of Kirk Douglas. Both are unnecessary and add nothing to the story. Harvey Keitel and Hector both lust over the scantily-clad Fawcett. Keitel tells her that on Earth, everyone is promiscuous in the future. They've come to all just enjoy each other sexually with no inhibitions.

Scream Factory puts together an impressive batch of special features for ""Saturn 3."" Audio commentary is provided by Greg Moss of the ""Saturn 3"" Fan Page and film critic David Bradley. There are interviews and featurettes which include Special Effects Artist Colin Chilvers and actor Roy Dotrice, who overdubbed the voice for Harvey Keitel's character. Deleted scenes and a theatrical trailer round out the bonus material.

""Saturn 3"" is a must-have for sci-fi fans that collect any and every movie made within the genre. To common everyday movie audiences, it'll come across as just another misstep for any of the actors and filmmakers involved. Cult classic enthusiasts will understand it for what it is. It's an overlooked and slightly damaged gemstone worthy of its place in their home entertainment library next to ""Meteor,"" ""Outland,"" ""Lifeforce"" and other forgotten treasures of the era.",1385424000,3,2803,5.019354838709678

The special effects hold up fairly well, also. Sadly, the biggest disappointment is not the storyline, but the completely flat performances put forth by the main actors-- Kirk Douglas and Farrah Fawcett-- who are paired as couple, which considering their age difference comes off as creepy-awkward.

280816,4,6300251330,"In the wake of the colossal success of ""Star Wars"" in the late '70s, by the early 1980s sci-fi, which had experienced a dry period throughout the early to mid '70s, was again a big business, with such films as ""Battle Beyond the Stars,"" ""Outland,"" and ""Horror Planet"" all surfacing at the time.  Continuing this tradition is Stanley Donen's ""Saturn 3"" (1980), which was a British production filmed in Shepperton, England, but with an American director, producer and cast.

On a remote research station on one of Saturn's uninhabited moons, the sole crew members, Kirk Douglas and Farah Fawcett, experience unseen difficulty in accomplishing their project and worse, are shadow-locked for three days during a particularly bad eclipse.  Another scientist (played by Harvey Keitel), who just happens to also be a real nutcase behind the unassuming exterior, brings in his deceptively cute robot Hector, to help with the mission.  Only Hector's brain is linked with Keitel's, and they both have the hots for crew member Alex (Fawcett).  It isn't long before both Keitel and the robot propose a real threat, in Keitel's mad plan to seize control of the station, not to mention the affections of Alex.

I want to start by saying that I love vintage sci-fi movies from this period, including all the ones mentioned above.  ""Saturn 3"" does have a lot going for it.  Both the special effects and set design are fabulous, as is the spellbinding score composed by Elmer Bernstein.  There is even a seconds-long shot of a bare-breasted Fawcett, not to mention some requisite gore (this was an R-rated film after all) including a body torn apart in a shredder, not to mention a hand severed from its limb.  But on the other hand, there are also some more dreary, dull stretches to be found, and a principle cast of only three presents challenges, meaning there is not a whole lot of variation in tone throughout.

This movie does bear nostalgic value to me though.  It was one of the very first titles, along with others like ""Phantasm,"" ""the Onion Field,"" and ""North Dallas Forty,"" that I remember seeing on the shelves of the very first mom and pop video store to open in our area in 1981-82 when I was 6 or 7.  I did not get to see the actual movie though until much later on in the '90s in snatches on cable, and in its entirety for the first time only on DVD.  Speaking of the DVD itself, my main complaint with it is that they didn't use the far superior original movie poster (see Wikipedia page) for the cover.  A small qualm though, I suppose, to get to see such a rare film from my childhood.

All in all, I'm settling on a solid 3 1/2 stars for ""Saturn 3"" because its rewatch value is not quite as high as some of its fellow brethren in the genre, but hardcore adult sci-fi addicts should be satisfied.  Not a masterpiece by any means, but a lot better than most movies coming out today, and retains a vintage sci-fi feel throughout.",1365292800,4,2931,4.616570327552987

I remember sneaking into the theater to watch this movie when I was about 6 years old!

This was the movie that got me hooked on the Sci-fi genre, and later on the Alien - Predator saga.
The moment I saw this old cheese ball had gone DVD, I just had to buy it for memories sake! I hadn't seen this movie for about 23 years!, yet I still remembered much of it!

If you're a fan of Sci-Fi, the Aliens, Terminator and Predator Mythos, you should definitely check out this classic!

Just be sure to watch it with a light heart, and don't be too demanding and I'm sure you'll enjoy it!",1199750400,4,585,4.114035087719298

280863,3,6300251330,"Saturn 3, while certainly not the best of films, does not deserve all of the bashing it gets. This film is sort of a ""Fatal Attraction"" meets the ""Terminator"" even though Saturn 3 was released years prior.
I really enjoyed this film. The ""atmosphere"" of the movie was very convincing and almost literally transports the viewer to the third moon of Saturn.
Yes, the movie has it's flaws. Farrah Fawcett is a terrible actress. She always was. But, then again, this '70s icon was never chosen for roles because of her acting ability, which, unfortunately, seems to be so commonplace in Hollywood.
Harvey Keitel, one of my favorite actors, does seem to give a very wooden performance, but that is probably due to the fact that the director did not like his Brooklyn accent and had all of his lines dubbed in by a British actor. Also, I think his character was meant to be dead-pan and wooden to reflect the current socialogical aspects of Earth's society (apparently, Earth is an overcrowded and socially bankrupt planet, much like it is today!).
The special effects are subpar when compared to similar sci-fi flicks of that time, but that is part of its charm. The effects, while slightly substandard, are still very eye-catching.
The story itself if very original. The idea of a robot becoming sexually obsessed with a woman just like his master and unable to fulfill his unnatural desires is executed in a logical and suspenseful way. The set design and costumes are also well done. The robot Hector, though, does seem to be designed rather oddly. That is probably due to the fact that a suit had to be built that could house a rather large-framed actor inside of it.
All in all, Saturn 3 is worth a look. Fans of sci-fi and thrillers should find this to be an excellent escape. I, for one, am glad to see that this movie is still around and available for purchase.",1170374400,8,1864,4.651515151515151

What a dissapointment this is... filmed at the height of the Sci Fi craze; Star Wars, Alien which it resembles at times but without the tension and fear...the story is slow and pedantic. The premise is not bad (two scientists working on a remote planet to save the world's food shortage peaceful existance is shattered by the arrival of a killer and his pyschotic robot) but there is no build up or character development at all. Harvey Keitel and Kirk Douglas are capable actors but one wouldnt say so from this drivel (Keitels voice is dubbed to add insult to injury) and Farrah...well...there is no hint here of the excellent character actress she would later become...but to be fair maybe she was only as good as the material she was given.",1161043200,2,893,4.622641509433962
280865,2,6300251330,"I remember thumbing through OMNI Magazine (remember it?) circa 1979 and looking at cool sci-fi stills from SATURN 3 - but alas, since it was Rated R at the time, I couldn't go - but now, thanks to the miracle of DVD, I can finally sit down and watch it in all its..er..um...glory.  This is simply awful. Dreadful. Abysmal. I mean, really, you watch the screen in disbelief and think: STANLEY DONEN directed this?  Famed UK novelist MARTIN AMIS wrote this?  Legendary composer ELMER BERNSTEIN scored this?  KIRK DOUGLAS and HARVEY KEITEL appear in this?  The mind boggles.  FARRAH is, well, Farrah - certainly no worse than SOMEBODY KILLED HER HUSBAND, but not as good as her cameo in LOGAN'S RUN, a much, much better sci-fi flick.  I give this DVD two stars only for the rather innovative production design (other reviewers have pointed out how THE MATRIX ripped-off the ""port"" concept, and JAMES CAMERON obviously stole whole sequences for this later sci-fi actioners), but the film as a whole is trite, dull, flat, and finally, ridiculous. And don't get me started on the amateurish, shoddy SPX - hard to believe this movie came out two years AFTER ""Star Wars"" - and a year after ""Alien""?!  Hello?! Utterly fake, the effects look more like shoestring SFX from '50s/'60s industrial films. Not scary at all, it's more kitsch and campy, so worth a peek or a rental at the very least.  And tossing in the original trailer is fun to watch all over again.",1123632000,6,1451,4.703557312252965
280866,2,6300251330,"With hysterical dialogue like that, is it any wonder why this movie failed? Yet it has some redeeming values.

Those of you coming of age in the late 70's, early 80's like myself may remember this flick as one of many sci-fi thrillers emerging from the shadows of STAR WARS. I couldn't see SATURN 3 at the time because it was rated ""R,"" but I remained intrigued.

After finally watching it, I will agree SATURN 3 belongs in the ""Cult Cheesy Sci-Fi"" drawer. I could easily see this as late night viewing when nothing else is on the other 800 satellite channels. This is a movie that does not challenge the mind but instead puts it in suspended animation. With enough plot holes to fly fake spaceships through, it is best to sink into your favorite easy chair, pop open the Doritos and turn your brain off when watching SATURN 3.

The incredible aspect of SATURN 3 is not the ""amazing"" special effects (of which there are none), but the talented filmmakers and actors associated with its production, all of which could not save this movie from being as bad as it is.

***MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS***

No less than the venerable Stanley Donan (SINGIN' IN THE RAIN, CHARADE) is credited as director, and his direction here looks likes he's terribly out of his element. Elmer Bernstein's soundtrack is atrocious: cartoonish and more suited for a carnival funhouse. The screenplay by noted writer Martin Amis comes across like a college freshman thesis project. Why does Harvey Keitel want to go to Saturn 3 so badly, and what is his purpose in manufacturing this eight foot homicidal robot? Don't think too hard; these and many more questions will drive you mad if pondered.

Kirk Douglas is not bad as the aging scientist who gets to lay pipe with a nubile Farrah Fawcett (although I did not need to see his old flabby ass in one particular scene. Farrah's would have been much better). He spouts ridiculous dialogue created by the aforementioned Mr. Amis through clenched teeth, yet makes it all seem somewhat believeable.

Harvey Keitel at first seems wooden, robotic, in his delivery and acting, and it becomes clear that it is exactly how his character is: cold, efficient, bureaucratic. Although he speaks his lines in a steady monotone and an unblinking glare, this is a foreshadowing of him later literally becoming a machine.

Alas, Farrah Fawcett is by far one of the worst actors I've seen. She comes across as a life-size Betty Boop doll, clearly chosen as eye candy, her helium-filled delivery distracting and comical. Her much vaunted nude scenes are seconds long and unfulfilling, and as I've pointed out earlier, we see more of Kirk Douglas' craggy butt than hers.

The robot, Hector, is actually very interesting. I like how his body is composed of tubes of liquid, much like blood vessels. His body is monstrous and tank-like. His puny head atop this huge structure ruins the look and reminded me of the shrunken-headed guy in the Limbo waiting room from BEETLEJUICE.

I remember reading an article about SATURN 3 in FANGORIA magazine when I was a kid, and I recall stills from this movie which depicted some gory scenes. In actuality, there is very little gore or blood, except for a guy at the beginning splattering like a watermelon, and Harvey Keitel having his very fake looking hand dismembered by Hector. Perhaps the gory scenes were edited out. Since the rest of the movie is so terribly edited, these scenes should have remained, and at least we would have had some good gross-outs to compensate for the rest of the dreadful film.

I did like the production design, which at least tried to make the sets look futuristic, despite the late 70's kitsch. The not-so-special effects are antiquated and cheesy by today's standards (and probably by late 70's standards), with lots of smoke and dry ice to simulate rocket propulsion and cardboard cut-out spaceships against a star-filled black screen.

One nifty feature (and since stolen by THE MATRIX) is the rear ""port"" in the back of Keitel's head from which he can ""download"" information and insert into Hector. Even the design of the ""port"" itself seems to have been lifted directly from this movie by the Wachowski Brothers.

Overall, an interesting but failed vintage sci-fi thriller that can be watched on a lazy Sunday afternoon or late at night when the brain waves are less active. Worth at least a rental. The DVD transfer is actually pretty decent, but it has no features other than a scene selection menu.",1121558400,7,4479,4.793774319066148
280867,1,6300251330,"The 1970's saw a degradation of the sci-fi medium, with notable stinkers such as ""Silent Running"" (tree hugging hippies in outer space), ""Logan's Run"" (youth drug culture at its worst) and this canon fodder which merged the absurd with the contemptible. The plot, or more-so, the arrangment of Kirk Douglas in a ridiculous role, takes place on Sheba, a moon of Saturn where there is a really old horny guy (Douglas), over the top as ever and his young sex slave (Facett), who does numerous nude scenes. This is so painful to watch because there is absolutely no chemistry between the two. Add a lousy Kietal in the ""mad scientist"" role and this goes even further into the stink pit. The special effects are lousy as is the dialogue. Not for the intelligent.",1102896000,3,757,4.6992481203007515

The plot is about a planet called Saturn 3 where two scientists live to conduct research.  Their research is a little behind schedule so another scientist gets sent down to help out a little with some new technology.  Unfortunatley, the scientist that is supposed to go down gets ambushed and replaced by a crazy guy with some devious plans in mind.  He takes down a robot that learns by a wireless link between itself and an actual human brain.  Since it is hooked up to and is learning from the mad scientist it goes a little haywire.  It gains the obsession of the female scientist that it's teacher has as well.  See the robot go crazy and watch the scientists run for their lives and try and escape from the desolate Saturn 3!
I love this movie! I give it 4 star because it loses one star for going at a slow pace.  Yes, this movie does move slow; but it is fun to watch and has a totally cool story.  B-Movie Classic!!",1087430400,6,1128,4.328571428571428
280869,2,6300251330,"To say the least, I was expecting far more from this film than what I got. For one thing, the actual concept is interesting and original. A robot going biserk while stationed in a science facility is a great idea to make a suspensful sci/fi epic. But somehow this film doesn't pull it off. The one thing that got to me is how dated this film is. It's not too terribly old; it was released in 1979, but the special effects look like they are out of a 1960's film. Alien came out the same year and this film but this looks like it came out 10 years before it. I also was not big on the acting itself. Harvey Keitel gives a wooden performance, Kurt Douglas is unconvincing as a scientist, and Farrah Faucet just seems be thown in as some Eye Candy. What a shame because I usually like these actors. When the robot finally goes biserk, it's not all that scary and it doesn't last all that long. When its all said and done, this film emerges as a failure, which is a shame because it had so much going for it.",1076716800,8,1004,4.153846153846154
280870,3,6300251330,"This is a bit of a misunderstood sci-fi flick ' not flawless, but worth a second look.
In a floating space station near Saturn, we meet Harvey Keitel's character, Benson, or 'The Captain'. Or is he really somebody else? In the first few minutes, he murders a pilot preparing to transport special cargo for a remote colony on Saturn's third moon. Taking the dead pilot's place ""Benson"" braves the rings of Saturn and arrives on Saturn 3, where Major Adam (Kirk Douglas) and the fetching Alex (Farrah Fawcett) are developing hydroponics-grown food for a struggling Earth. It's not just work for Adam and Alex, and Benson's arrival disrupts the family unit that the two have made for each other. Adam came to space to escape Earth (which we're supposed to assume is made unpleasant perhaps by pollution, war, over-population or some other contemporary problem unchecked in his distant future). Alex has never known Earth, which only highlights the apparent generation gap between her and Adam. Benson begins desiring Alex well before he actually gets around to his purported mission, and he figures that Adam's age gives him the edge (monogamy is frowned upon back on Earth, he tells her). It turns out that Benson has come to construct a robot to replace the team's now obsolescent half - Adam, and into that job, he throws himself full steam. Benson is so obsessed to complete the menacing robot which will replace Adam that you begin to wonder which of the trwo obsessions really rules his dark soul: Alex or the robot. When completed, the vaguely humanoid machine stands about 8 feet high, moves convincingly and menacingly robot-like and is topped with an incongruous thing that looks like a desk lamp. Called Hector, the robot's CPU is a large clear can containing what looks like human brain matter. Not talkative at the outset, the machine (a model ominously called a 'demigod') picks up fast when linked into Keitel's brain through a remote sensor Keitel implants into the base of his own spine (a striking precursor to the decades-newer ""Matrix""). Unfortunately, the neural link also gets the 'bot past the firewall of Benson's soul, and we learn through the robot a dark thing or two about Benson - notably that he failed a probably important course, likely one meant to protect a burgeoning artificial intelligence from the mind of a  natural-born psychotic. Unsurprisingly, the machine not only becomes psychotic as well, but decides that Benson is an obstacle to be replaced much as Benson had planned for Adam. Soon, Adam and Alex are on the run from Hector, learning to quickly duck in and out of hydraulic doors and weave through cramped ventilator shafts.
This was a pretty slim flick which gets more mileage than it should out of Farrah Fawcett. Her character is vulnerable and compulsively dependent throughout the movie, never displaying the resourcefulness that Sigourney Weaver had established for a new generation of sci-fi heroines in 'Alien' (which came out the year before). Alex has to be the last female character to faint out of fear in a sci-fi film. We never get an insight into Keitel's character either - obsessed with both Hector and Fawcett. The two can't both be paramount in his mind. You get the idea that to Benson, the robot is just a means to get Alex; but there are scenes when Keitel tries to get into the robot's head, making it a more substantial part of his own psyche. It's incredible to think that Martin Amis had anything to do with this story which, among other things, is strikingly unsurprising. (Case in point: when first demonstrated, Hector crushes a can Benson had ordered the robot to give Adam. There isn't a person on the planet who couldn't guess Kirk Douglas's response: 'I'm glad you didn't tell him to shake my hand.')
On the plus side, the visuals are nice. The sets were obviously influenced by Alien at the time, but today look more like a cross between the drab utilitarian interiors of that film and the older way-out futurism of visionary artist Chesley Bonestell (the space station, ships and star-scapes recall the famous artist's vision) and the thin story will keep you watching - just not that much. But above all, the real attraction is Harvey Keitel - who speaks in a very precise accent. It's Keitel as you've never seen (with a cool euro-looking ponytail) or heard (his voice was dubbed) him before.  Even if Keitel's character is too vague to drive the story, he's still fun to watch (and hear).  You know that the robot will go for him first, and his loss is what kills this film as much as his presence gives it a life that (like the robot) it doesn't really deserve.",1072656000,2,4646,4.797752808988764

The high point in the film was the actual construction of the robot, everything before and after was a total waste of money and time. What were Kirk Douglas and Farrah Fawcett getting paid to do other than taking showers and rolling around naked with each other? Surely they were there for a reason but what, they never did any work at all and as far as the special effects I've seen better shadow puppets for an eclipse than the one in this film. Harvey Keitel was a very convincing horn ball that's about it; I think his mission was to get laid by Farrah. The absolute worst was Hector falling into the acid and coming out with what looked like dried Crisco stalactites shouldn't all of his plastic tubing have instantly melted?

The acting isn't horrible, but the script is awful.  The real problem is that the central villain is the robot who is supposed to be a scary metal monster, but ends up being just ridiculous.  So that pretty much ruins the movie.  Terminator it ain't.
