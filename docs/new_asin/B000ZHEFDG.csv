8235455,5,B000ZHEFDG,"I was a patient being treated at Brand New Day a mental health facility at Garden Grove, CA. I had been labeled
Bi-Polar, and was being prescribed various psychiatric medicines. I had grown weary of their lack of remedying my
condition. One day I looked on the board of scheduled activities, and saw a class was being offered for laughing
yoga with yogi  pandam ramesh! i began attending the class and enjoyed it. The class helped me feel better. I was
given the DVD by yogi at christmas time. I have used the DVD and can attest that the exercises will help anyone
who has clinical disorder of depression, anxiety, or similar type of health issues. As yogi says, less oxygen body
cries, more oxygen body flies, no oxygen body dies. The deep yogic breathing exercises on the DVD are therapeutic
and will help anyone feel better, calmer and more at peace with themselves. The laughing exercises will release
feel good  endorphins without having to jog around the track for 5 miles! It of course works best in a class or
group setting. I give it a two thumbs up. I no longer take psych meds any more. I love you, love you, love you!
P.S. He's not crazy, he's yogi.",1349136000,6,1161,4.497630331753554
