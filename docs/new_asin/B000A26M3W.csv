Here's a short synopsis... One amazingly annoying couple go to Egypt on their third year wedding anniversary, and decide to make a slide show to ram down the throats of others, and have the nerve to sell it.

In short; the shooting and editing sucks, we don't care about their pedestrian opinions, they look clueless, and there is no story other than their verbal onanism.

I so desperately want my money back!",1197849600,4,442,4.641025641025641
8072361,2,B000A26M3W,this looked and felt like someone's home video of there trip to Egypt. not worth the money at all,1179619200,2,97,4.157894736842105
8072362,4,B000A26M3W,"I viewed T&T's dvd of Anarctica and this dvd of Egypt is much the same quality. Of course, knowing what these two individuals are capabile of presenting I took the chance on the Egypt dvd and I was not disappointed. T&T are amature dvd makers to be sure, but the overall presentation inspite of their rookie talents is VERY good!  They seem to be seasoned travelers. They present travel in Egypt in a way that would give any potential Egypt visitor a very good insight of what to expect once there.  They are a pair on a limited budget, and do things while there more or less the way one would do if you had to ""do it yourself"". They did not go on an organized tour, but created their own. When Ms T speaks however, most the time she would better serve the viewer by using a remote microphone, as often it is VERY difficult to make out what she is saying.  Not so of Mr T, as he is the one usually holding the camera and therefore very close to the cameras built-in microphone. Only in a few select locations within the Valley of the Kings did Ms T's voice come in clearly. Their trip took place in April, 2003, and I'd venture to say that virtually everything you will see on this dvd is still applicable today (May, 2007).",1179187200,3,1224,4.267241379310345
8072363,5,B000A26M3W,"I have some of their other DVD's, & this is just as good. They show pyramids, the nile, mummies, temples, wow, so much huge amazing relics! What makes it really unique is they show the bad stuff too like people always trying to sell them stuff & how hot it gets. If you want to go to Egypt, you should learn these things first. It has cool music too, all moody & mystical, totally fits w/the temples & desert.",1138060800,6,409,4.189873417721519
8072364,5,B000A26M3W,"I have purchased two of the videos from T&T and I will admit that it is like one you would see when you go to visit friends, but that's it charm. I can see PBS and the History channel all the time, but to see it like I would see it makes it real to me. I would love to know this couple and I admire their joy of travel. I too love to travel, but do it with tours as I travel alone. I envy their shared love of travel. These are young people that I would like to have as friends. They are adventuresome and see sites not on the regular tour. I thank them for allowing me to relive my own travels and to share theirs with me.",1137542400,6,623,3.763358778625954
8072365,5,B000A26M3W,What sets this video apart is feeling like you're along on the journey.  It's not just a series of stand-up shots in front of the sites you've seen hundreds of times before.  A lot of travel documentaries show you the typical tourist experience in Egypt.  T&T's Real Travels in Egypt prepare you for the cultural experience.,1130544000,9,324,4.75
