8378143,5,B002QXLF1C,"Another great flick from the folks at Sideshow Cinema. This time with the giallo genre firm in their sights we get the bizarre tale of the bow tie killer. Yes, he kills people with a bow tie, that's how absurdity works! With a cast of charcaters that range from a man who has pretty much everyone he meets fall in love with him to a doctor who can rescusitate a fly.
Director Legge's latest project shows his razor sharp wit in fine form. MY MOUTH LIES SCREAMING is definitely a great flick for anyone with a sense of humor.",1261872000,2,524,4.303030303030303
