8233911,1,B000YQUXL6,"This is done in the vein of ""Dukes of Hazzard"" with cops chasing drug runners. It is at best, hokey fun, at worst, unwatchable. The Watson brothers meet an airplane carrying marijuana and a little cocaine and the cops are always waiting for them. Not much in the way of script or acting.

8233917,1,B000YQUXL6,"""In Hot Pursuit,"" originally released as ""Polk County Pot Plane"" is one of the worst excuses for a movie ever to emerge from the fetid cinematic decade of the seventies. Starring Don Watson and Bobby Watson as Oosh and Doosh respectively, the film essentially exists as a vehicle for chase scenes.

Oosh and Doosh work picking up pot from a DC-4 cargo plane near Atlanta. The cast, overrun with rednecks, constantly finds themselves in car chases with the police: a large number of vehicles were pointlessly sacrificed for this film. Some of the chases boggle the mind (mostly because of their interminable length), and involve such things as campers, bulldozers, tractor trailers, and of course a variety of cars. Of all the chase scenes I think the best involves driving a tractor trailer through a mobile home.

Oosh and Doosh aren't the smartest characters, and as soon as they are broken out of jail following the camper fiasco in a totally implausible subplot involving a helicopter, they are back to smuggling. It's hard to believe but the drug lord turns out to be unscrupulous, making Oosh and Doosh rob an armored car in yet another excuse to drive vehicles inappropriately. Lovers of subtle humor take note: the ""new car"" gag is so hilarious that it ends up with both a woman fainting and a man wearing a babushka! Oh, my ribs!

Of special note are the music and the acting. The music ranks among the least appropriate in film history. The score relies heavily on a Spike Jones theme, complete with slide whistle, while the acting relies heavily on a high school drama club theme, in that every single performance in the film is utterly wretched. This film has no redeeming qualities that I could discover, save an excellent credit line which reads ""Big Bird Played by N8703B (DC-4)."" You be the judge of whether that's enough to satisfy you.",1220054400,,1853,4.784375
