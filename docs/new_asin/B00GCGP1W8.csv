8622172,5,B00GCGP1W8,"I saw this movie in  the late 70's on HBO when they showed good films. I love David Janssen movies and this is no exception, the plot is good the clothes and cars are pure 70's era.  Some nudity but it is tasteful.  Janssen plays a retired spy /author and he is writing again and the CIA is ticked off and tries hard to stop him up to and including murder and torture.  If you like 70 's spy thrillers this is a good one.",1423440000,3,421,3.9176470588235293
