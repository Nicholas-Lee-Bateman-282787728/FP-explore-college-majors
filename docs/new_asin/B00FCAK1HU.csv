5975262,5,B00FCAK1HU,I have fond memories of these shows and found this DVD set to be comprehensive of both the music and the message.,1386720000,3,113,4.181818181818182
5975263,5,B00FCAK1HU,"I had an old VHS recording of the 1988 shows that I loved revisiting every once in a while.  I was quite sad when it gave up the ghost, and was thrilled to be able to have a dvd copy of that one show.  I am looking forward to seeing the rest as well.",1386115200,4,250,3.611111111111111
5975264,5,B00FCAK1HU,Many great memories and performances and yes the DVDs are wonderful. Great transfer. U2 is wonderful and Bono gives a great performance as usual.,1383955200,8,145,5.083333333333333
5975265,5,B00FCAK1HU,"This is the perfect christmas gift to anyone into helping good causes. Plus all the good music by U2, bruce springsteen and many others. Buy one for a gift and one for yourself. Wished they would have included little stevens ""sanctuary"" from his set.",1383868800,9,250,4.704545454545454
5975266,4,B00FCAK1HU,"Intersesting footage. Alot of things I have never seen before and many of the performances were great. I would recomend this to any
one who supports Amnesty International and who loves great music.",1391990400,,197,5.0
5975267,4,B00FCAK1HU,"Great quality and a good mix of interviews and performances, the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is I was hoping for more Bruce but you can never get enough Bruce!",1390867200,,168,4.121212121212121
5975268,5,B00FCAK1HU,"Great concert. Great DVD! This is full of musical memories. A great addition to any musical library. If you live music, you will love this!",1390176000,2,139,4.6
5975269,5,B00FCAK1HU,Great Christmas gift for my husband.  Good music and footage.  Spent the holiday break watching a lot of it.  Would recommend it.,1390003200,,129,4.7727272727272725
5975270,3,B00FCAK1HU,"This would have been a much better three DVD set to celebrate the 35th anniversary of the ""Human Rights Now"" concerts. The first two DVDs here are from the NYC concert and feature full sets from Police, Peter Gabriel, Tracy Chapman, etc.  The second disk is the theater documentary in it's full 3 hour format and adds Bruce Springsteen and U2 to the mix.  The other sets quite frankly I haven't bothered with yet.  But they do feature some sets down the years up to and including Mumford & Sons at the 2012 show.  It's a lot to take in.",1389484800,4,536,4.33
5975271,5,B00FCAK1HU,"These shows had a huge impact of spreading Amnesty's message, as does the release of these videos. keep the faith",1389052800,,113,4.7
5975272,2,B00FCAK1HU,This was a waste of money. Mostly filled with interviews and talks about the issues which are very important but I bought this for the entertainment value not for the lectures.,1388534400,4,176,4.709677419354839
5975273,5,B00FCAK1HU,"Received as a Christmas gift.

A high point of my lifetime of attending concerts was the Amnesty Concert in Philadelphia. Re-watching these concerts brings back great memories. The video quality is very VHS, but it seems to increase the awesome. At one point Martha Quinn audio interrupts Peter Gabriel's performance.

A memory I have is Tracy Chapman singing ""Don't Give Up"" with Peter Gabriel, but I haven't found it on this set. Too bad, as it was an epic point for me.  Included, though, is the equally excellent ""The River"" with Sting and Springsteen.",1388275200,5,556,4.8936170212765955
5975274,4,B00FCAK1HU,Now you can attend some great concerts any time that you want and protect human rights. A great deal for a great cause.,1388016000,2,119,4.217391304347826
5975275,5,B00FCAK1HU,"I never got rid of my VHS tape of the 1988 concert as aired on HBO, but here it is, finally, on DVD, along with much more.  There is a ton of material here, including great music for an excellent cause, and some truly hilarious '80's haircuts (I'm looking at you, Kevin Bacon!)  Don't miss the ""Peach Jam"" segment on Context on the Human Rights Concerts -- Part One.  I promise you've never seen anything quite like it.",1387497600,8,419,4.346153846153846
8614394,1,B00FCAK1HU,Amazon's product control systems failed miserably.  There was no indication when I purchased the set that this was not for use in Europe.  Waste of time and effort.  Only good thing was that Amazon have said that they will credit the purchase now that I sent the box set back.,1517788800,,276,4.48
8614395,4,B00FCAK1HU,"Many many hours of previously unreleased Amnesty International concerts. Lots of Peter Gabriel, Sting, Bruce Springsteen, and Tracey Chapman, as well as lots of others. Many world music acts from Africa and Europe. Sound and video quality are great. The price is reasonable and profits go to Amnesty International. Didn't give it 5 stars only because some of the acts were boring, and there's lots of Amnesty International PR that you won't want to sit through more than once.",1511481600,,476,5.037974683544304
8614396,5,B00FCAK1HU,"I always wondered why they didn't RELEASE this concerts, and then I found them almost by accident. My favorite one is Conspiracy of Hope, just that concert alone is worth the price, and the other concerts are very good also. Because of the Conspiracy of Hope concert I started to listen to Peter Gabriel as a solo artist, what a show!!! U2 and The Police are great also in this concert.",1437436800,2,386,4.450704225352113

8614401,2,B00FCAK1HU,"Glad this was a gift. Poor video quality - before the days of HD.

While there were some very good performances, this package seemed like an overpriced miss to me.",1404777600,,163,4.433333333333334
8614402,2,B00FCAK1HU,"Good for us, of course, particulary in the Chilean case (the edition include an abstract of that two wonderfull days in 1990). But is really incredible that the edition not includes any spanish subtitles at all",1392595200,,210,4.861111111111111
