8356039,3,B0028AQE50,"This video is based on Lightfoot's book How We Got the Bible.  The book is jammed packed with information that every informed Christian should know in an easy to read format. This video is 40 minutes long. Basically it is only NARATIVE explaining aspects of the material with pictures quite like a person would use slides. There is little if ANY animation and there is no deep materials covered. If you have middle school kids who you want to educate about this topic, the video can possibly  be used for them with some additional information. One should certainly not get the misimpression that the video is a substitute for the book. If a person is not already knowledgeable about the information, he will not go away with much more than what he already had because the information is EXTREMELY BRIEF and fast-paced as it says on the cover.  For $18, keep your money and buy a good book. Lightfoots book is a good start!",1283558400,3,922,4.609756097560975
8356040,5,B0028AQE50,"This DVD is based on Neil Lightfoot's outstanding text of the same title.  One of its strengths is the wealth of photographs of original manuscript copies and writing materials.  These help modern readers see exactly what believers of centuries ago read and copied.

The text itself makes the Scriptures even more precious as Lightfoot shares the process through which the Bible came down to us.",1243987200,4,395,5.046153846153846
