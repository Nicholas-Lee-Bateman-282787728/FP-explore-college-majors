1059301,5,6305596344,"Ok, I read a review awhile back and it had a mistake in it that I would like to correct so that no one gets confused. Anime No Miko said that she had read all 18 manga volumes, which is the truth... there are 18 volumes  of the manga. However, she also said that she had seen all 26 episodes. I  am assuming that she mean that she had seen all 26 that are in this DVD  collection, because there are a total of 52 eps and 2 ovas for FY. Anyway,  just hoping to clear up any confusion! BUY FY! YOU WON'T REGRET IT! It's my  favorite anime and it is just absolutely gorgeous. I have seen a ton of  anime and this one is still my favorite series.

1059302,5,6305596344,"Fushigi Yuugi(a Mysterious Play), is surely one of the best anime titles out on the market to date.  It is an intricately woven story of love and friendship.  Of course, a love story can never be without a love triangle.  The story brings together elements of laughter, sorrow, hatred, and pity.  Even though the story seems aimed for more of a Shojo or young girls  audience(15+), it touches each and everyone of us.  This title is a  definate buy.  Yuu Watase has given us one of her best, and we shall always  cherish it as one of the best.",945216000,2,543,4.404040404040404

In Fushigi Yugi a girl was tranported into a  different world to become a priestess of suzaku and be granted all of  suzaku's powers and grant her wishes in order to that she must find 7  celestial warriors to make her wishes come true  All in all this is a must  for any ANIME fan just like me.

1059304,5,6305596344,"""FY"" is one of the most beautiful anime I've ever seen and its story was dramatic because it embraced more mature topics. But because of this, the ratings on it should be upped to PG-16. This series was intended  for more mature audiences, this is my caution to parents. I would NOT  recommend this as a present to a 12 year old or a 13 year old for that  matter. Even 15 is pushing it. Unless the person is very mature, some  scenes can be disturbing. I've seen all 26 episodes and read all 18 mangas,  so I know the full story. Briefly, this is a fantasy/romance story  featuring love, betrayal, good vs evil, and it includes scenes depicting  rape, attempted rape, brainwashing, murder, self-sacrifice, gory death  scenes, and the whole kit and kaboodle. There are also 2 characters that  are gay and one of them tries to seduce another guy. So if U don't want UR  child to see this, or if U don't, then do NOT buy it you must be very open  minded and not very impressionable.",945043200,11,979,4.383333333333334

The whole world (no pun intended ^.^) is very well planned, each character is distinctive and lovable (even one or two of the  bad guys!  eep! ::covers mouth:: ) FY, however, isn't for younger veiwers,  it deals with some issues that are for mature people (i.e. one of the  people think they have been raped). Despite that, it's a great series, and  my favorite (even better in the subed form than the English). Jist of the  series?

1059349,4,6305596344,"What is it that draws people to anime? For many it's the amazing fight sequences that can not take place except in the most expensive of Hollywood sets. For others it's giant robots and overly endowed women. For other still it's sweet girlish romance that portrays the essence of love without being caught up in ""fan service."" I, however, was drawn to anime for a very different reason. Anime can be extremely well written. Unlike Hollywood movies, anime can create powerful characters, rich settings, wonderful dialogue, and natural character interaction. There are very many such classy anime, epitomized by Fruits Basket, Full Metal Alchemist, His and Her Circumstances, and Twelve Kingdoms. A lot of this may have to do with the fact that much of anime comes from novels, while others come from manga (Japanese comics that seem to have a lot of literary elements). Fushigi Yugi, an anime adaption of a manga of the same name, is one such show.

The story of Fushigi Yugi excels in many things. It is very, very unpredictable. At times, it seems that the main character does exactly the opposite of what you're convinced she'll do. For the first twenty episodes it's fairly good, turning and twisting here and there. After that, however, it becomes excellent. Fushigi Yugi turns into a very dark, very mysterious show, one that at times leaves Miaka wishing she could just go back home and forget this ever happened. Needless to say, it's very enjoyable, and though many twists seem unnecessary and overplayed (like the many ""fights"" between Miaka and Tamahome), once the show is seen as an interaction between humans with personalities and not the narrator's magic hand guiding puppets to a conclusion, many of them make sense and actually add a lot to the characters.

Although the storyline really is excellent, the characters is really where Fushigi Yugi excels. The four main characters from the Suzaku side, Miaka, Tamahome, Hotohori, and Nuriko, are all very well explored. They have personalities that stem from their pasts, and not vice versa. Especially well developed are Miaka and Tamahome, whose inner lives and personalities we know like the back of our hands by the end of the show. Not too far behind is Hotohori. What really intrigued me is that, in the beginning, each character seemed like an archetype. The strong and noble leader, the money obsessed wandering fighter, the cute and ditsy main female lead. However, after the first few episodes, the archetypes turn into original characters shaped in reaction to their individual circumstances. Every character has a motive for every action. From Yui and Miaka (the main female roles) to Nakago (the main evil dude), each character is extremely well played out. Even Nakago, whom I would have been content had he been left an evil, evil character, was given a past and a present, as well as motivations that reacted with his past to create a very dark future. His last scene was one of the most touching scenes I have ever seen with an evil bad guy. The characters are absolutely amazing. I would definitely pick up a show with just these characters goofing around.

Another area of expertise for Fushigi Yugi is the humor of the show. It serves very many purposes. For the first twenty episodes it allows the creators of the anime to build up the world as meticulously as possible without the viewers loosing interest. By the time the first twenty episodes are completed, the characters haven't done much, but the world is fully set up and the real adventure is ready to begin. This wouldn't have been possible without the humor of the series- it would just be too slow to actually follow. After that, however, the humor is a welcome change from the sheer darkness of the series. The final twenty episodes have it all: rape, murder, massacre, lust, unfulfilled love. The characters you have grown to really love are thrown through so much pain, without the humor it would be fairly unbearable. In the beginning, the humor is what makes you come back for more, and then later on it's just what makes sure you can survive the intensity of the show.

The animation is called lacking, but I find it fairly perfect for the show. The show is centered around the characters, and the deformed, pint sized and funny looking version of the characters around which the humor is centered wouldn't fit in a beautifully animated, realistic world. Sure, the fights could have been nicer, but they're still intense and very suspenseful. But really, after watching three episodes, you'll forget that the detail of the show isn't all that great. It's all about character and plot; animation only matters when it's supposed to be funny, and it pulls that off brilliantly.

The only main aspect of the show that's lacking is the music. This is not Rurouni Kenshin. This is not Full Metal Alchemist. Don't even mistake this for Fruits Basket. The music outright sucks. Badly. There's only one song worth listening to, but that song is done extremely well (it's near the end and comes with a major spoiler, so I'll say no more). It really is the only thing that keeps it from a five star rating- yes, it's that bad.",1168128000,2,5167,4.827313769751693
1059350,4,6305596344,"The schoolgirl Miaka and her best friend Yui fall into a storybook; Yui gets back somehow, and Miaka gets attached to Tamahome, who saves the two from bandits the minute they enter the story. Yui reads the story, finding out what's happening to Miaka along the way, while Miaka finds out she's the Priestess of Suzaku and must find the seven Seishi in order to save everyone... you get the drift.

The characters are very well done, and made better by an amazing cast of voice actors. Well, the Japanese voice actors, I don't know about the English voice actors.

The voice for the king, Hotohori, is Koyasu Takehito, who you may have encountered if you watched (in Japanese) Knight Hunters, Detective Loki Ragnarok, Twelve Kingdoms, other things, or listened to the band Weiss Kreuz. He's got a great deep voice that really fits the character of Hotohori.

Another member of Weiss Kreuz who also is a voice in Knight Hunters is Tomokazu Seki, who is in Fruits Basket, Chobits, Full Metal Panic, and actually just about anything you can think of... well, I guess that's extreme, but he's an extremely talented seiyuu (voice actor). He plays the role of Chichiri, the funny monk character, who has a rather squeaky voice and always says 'no da' at the end of his sentences.

Another good voice is the voice of Chiriko, who was the main character in Hikaru no Go. He doesn't appear until near the end of the set, however.

At any rate, the casting is marvelous, which is why, if you like Japanese music, you must look at 'Memories: Character's Vocal' and 'Fushigi Yuugi Best Vocal Collection'. The series music is also good, and the CD for that is 'Fushigi Yuugi Super Best Collection'.

In short, the Suzaku set boasts a good plot, great characters, fantastic music, and pretty art. While the romance may get a little old, overall I enjoyed the Suzaku set very much.

Just an overhead warning, however. If you don't plan on watching the second set, Seiryu, for various reasons (ok, bluntly, it's sad and not satisfying), you should probably not watch the last episode in the Suzaku set.

But if you haven't seen Fushigi Yuugi yet, it's a good idea to start here. Enjoy the storybook world that is similar to ancient China, with its four gods; mainly Suzaku, the phoenix, and Seiryu, the dragon: Fushigi Yuugi, the Mysterious Play.",1163548800,,2329,4.719211822660099
1059351,5,6305596344,"I will try to write a review of the entire Fushigi Yugi series so that you can have a complete (and overall) picture of this wonderful anime. Therefore, if you don't want to know what happens next then please stop reading the specific section because spoilers will be included all over in the review that is to follow.

Apart from it, I will try to maintain an overall review so that to inform the reader as much as possible without giving too much away.

Fushigi Yugi - The Mysterious Play - (Boxed Set 1, Suzaku)

Two fiends, Miaka and Yui - the typical Japanese high school girls- will come across a book called the `Universe of the four Gods' and will be drawn into it (SPOILER! The book basically presents itself to be something like a gate to a parallel universe with the difference that the gods of this parallel universe are the ones who `choose' whom to allow to enter and why, something that will be implied latter on, in the second box set).

There, the two girls will be confronted with a world that is divided into four kingdoms and resembles Ancient China, but each of the girls will end up in a different kingdom as a priestess of the kingdom's god; and their goal will be to gather the seven `holy' warriors in order to summon the god. The catch: the girls will be enemies. On top of that, Miaka will deeply fall in love with one of her warriors, Tamahome, who will love her deeply as well but: Yui will want him two; the emperor will love Miaka etc.

The first arc, deals more with the story and character development, the viewer learns a lot about the world/kingdoms, the citizens agony etc. Of course all this will be accompanied with a lot of action as well.

Fushigi Yugi - The Mysterious Play - (Boxed Set 2, Seiryu)

This is the continuation of the first arc. Now that the viewer has gotten into the anime, the story takes off. After failing to summon Suzaku, the warriors will have to find two holy ornaments in order to achieve it. The story starts to get darker and darker, very emotional and the actual conflict between the two parties of holy warriors takes place, and the true feelings of the love triangle (Tamahome-Miaka-Emperor) will be tested; is their love destined to fail? Additionally, characters that you will learn to love, from the first arc already, will die (be it children, men, women, warriors, emperors or whatsoever)... Last but not least, the final battles will also occur not only in the Four Gods Kingdoms but also in our world as well, because the universes will start to collide (may sound confusing but once you watch the anime it is easy to understand, it is just if I will start to explain it I will give the story and twists away, sorry guys). What will be the end?

Fushigi Yugi :The Mysterious Play OVA Boxed Set

Tamahome is now Taka (well, re-incarnated) and lives together with Miaka in our world. However, trouble occurs once a very powerful and dark force tries to escape from the world of the four kingdoms and wants to come and to destroy our world. Now again, the couple will be drawn back into the book, travel forth and back into the universes, the Suzaku Seven are gathered again and hell brakes loose; because the love of Miaka and Tamahome is in serious danger (not to mention the worlds as well).

Fushigi Yugi - The Mysterious Play - Eikoden

This is, for the time being, the last of Fushigi Yugi that is out there. In these OVAs, Tamahome and Miaka are married and she is pregnant. However, a girl named Mayo will enter the book of the four gods as a new priestess of Suzaku and will try to: steal Tamahome from Miaka, who will fall into a coma, kill the Suzaku Seven, take the child of Tamahome and Miaka as her own etc. Tamahome will enter the book but the world he once knew is starting to fall apart...

Overall opinion about the series:

Personaly, I believe that this anime alongside with Escaflowne, tops every other anime in the Fantasy genre. It is very emotional, has strong character development, solid and very interesting story with way too many twists and will keep you hooked up till the end (that is something that will happen for sure hehehe)

As for the animation:

The first arc has a fair animation but still a good one (in order to get a picture, the animation is something like crave of the fireflies). The second one is updated (something like Trigun). In the first OVAs the animation is definitely updated (something like FMP). Last but not least, in the last OVAs the animation remains in the same level as the previous OVAs but the creatures' animation is something like the ones you see in Digimon (well, personally I preferred the way they used to be in the previous OVAs).

Music:

The music, no matter arcs or OVAs, opening or ending, is very - very good and emotional. You will love the music in it.

Worth buying or not?

I will be honest. Personally I love these series and bought all of them. However, the price may present itself to be an obstacle (took me two years to buy the complete show). Therefore, if you can afford it than buy it for sure and you will not regret it; if not, than try to rent it if possible because these shows are definitely worth watching. Not to mention the fact that the series all together are very long (something that I liked).

1059352,5,6305596344,"This is the best shojou anime ever. I continuously say that because it's true. This isn't an anime for boys, really. There are fight scenes but there's too much romance in here. Go back to watching your dumb Chobits or Tenchi Muyo's. Anyway, this anime will make you laugh, it will make you cry, and you will definitely love the romance and the love triangles in this anime. There's also a slight slice of life in there between Miaka and Yui, it's a common thing, happens all the time. I recommend this to anybody who's in love with love and triangles, and adventure. What doesn't this anime have? People don't like the fact that Miaka eats and eats and doesn't gain weight, I think it's to do with what girls want. Girls want to eat sweets and not gain weight, girls want fantasy and adventure and to be surrounded by bishounen. I definitely recommend this, a major soap opera anime!",1145664000,,884,4.53125

Although you do have to put up with the gushy love, there is trauma and tragedy the negate this, not to mention the added comedy bonuses through out the series. There are characters that impress; Tamahome, Nuriko, Hotohori, Tasuki and Chichiri and villians that make you wish they get theirs. It's a classic story of good vs evil, betrayal, and of course love.

1059356,5,6305596344,"I wish I'd have gotten the DVD, but I finished up this series long ago (like 4 years).  Indeed, I did spend about $30 for every single VHS out there.  And believe me, it was worth it.  It's hard to believe that we saw the first tape at Blockbuster (long before people stopped going because of late fees)!

In the first half of this series, we get to meet Miaka Yuki and Yui Hongo, junior high students in Japan (they're preparing for high school exams).  During a visit to the library, they get sucked into a magical book called the The Universe of the Four Gods.  I'm not gonna give the rest of the plot away, because if you've never seen it, it's that good!  The mood for this half of the series is light and funny, so be prepared to laugh!

I found out that this kind of anime is called ""shojo anime"", meaning it's for girls/women.  I am a woman, but my brother loved this series too, among other guys (that actually did sit down to watch the series).  He watched this series from beginning to end, and although he said that he'd never watch it again (""it's too mushy!""), he liked it anyway, because it was definitely our money's worth.

This anime is for people over 12-13 because of some mature content, but I recommend this series to anyone that wants to appreciate some fine Japanese artistry and a good story.",1119744000,6,1317,4.35655737704918
1059357,3,6305596344,"Over all, I think this show is very good, but I found the beginning of this boxed set a little weak in the first quarter.

The personality of the characters are great. They act realistic for their roles, and the voice overs are superb. I think this is one of the show's greatest strengths is the interactions between the characters. There is a little lack of balance in personality  at the beginning, which is nothing unusual. The gap of the fun wild guy is eventually filled, though.

The show also does a good job with building up tension in the plot. There is a little lack of action in the first half of this boxed set, but it was all made up in the second half.

Time for the bad. I found the beginning to be extremely emotional, too much for my taste. I quickly got bored with the constant love chitter chatter with Tamahome. It really slowed down the story, Miaka's constant thoughts about how she is madly in love with the man. It isn't until the relationship between Tamahome and Miaka run into some deep trouble that I was able to adjust to the huge amount of romance (I'm suprised I'm saying this since I'm a girl). I didn't watch the show for weeks because of this overwhelming flood of emotion.

By the end of this boxset, though, I began to enjoy the show. I'm not sure if I just adapted to the romance or the dark plots twists that happen later on balance it out. I found the rest of the show a real treat, very traumatic.

If you are more into action, and not fond of psychological stuff, then you should probably avoid this anime. But if you are a soap opera fan, than you should love this show.",1109808000,,1612,4.303630363036303

Fushigi Yugi in my opinion is a comedy. Even though it has drama, lots of mushy mushy love, and action it falls more into comedy. It falls into comedy because when stupid stuff happens the animation changes and the characters look funny (they look like little people with fat heads).

The only thing I dislike was when Yui, the preistest of seiyu, for about half the series is fighting Miaka, the preistest of Suzaku, because she felt that Miaka abandoned her for a boy Tomahome, who is part of the Suzaku Seven, who she liked also, but overall this anime is awsome and worth watching.",1093651200,2,689,4.59349593495935
1059391,4,6305596344,"Over the top shoujo (girls) romantic content, an annoying centric character, incredibly likable secondary characters, and a couple anime firsts for me. Yes, this is the ""Mysterious Play"" I've heard so much about.
Fushigi Yuugi is, at first glance, a typical shoujo anime. Two high school exam candidates, Miaka Yuki and Yui Hongo, are in the library reseaching, when they come across a book titled 'Universe of the Four Gods.' No sooner do they pick it up, then they are drawn into this book, and straight into ancient China! Miaka and Yui become separated, and Miaka finds herself in the Konan Empire, being hailed as the Priestess of the phoenix god Suzaku. She has to find the Seven Seishi (warriors) bearing the ""mark of Suzaku"" (think of it as a tattoo that shows up when they're fighting), and summon the god to have all her wishes fulfilled.
She finds her seven warriors: Tamahome, her money-obsessed love interest devoted to his family. Hotohori, the narcissistic Emperor of Konan, also in love with Miaka (of course...) Nuriko, my personal favorite, a sassy crossdresser in love with Hotohori (and a guy, in case you're wondering). Chichiri, the chipper sorcerer in training. Tasuki, the brash, energetic mountain bandit. Mitsukake, the stoic healer. And Chiriko, the 13-year-old genius. After enlisting the help of the sorceress Taiitsikun, she begins.
But she soon finds out that Yui has been chosen by the Kotou Empire to summon rival god, Seiryu. Life in the book has not been easy for Yui, and after finding out that Miaka is in a relationship with Tamahome, whom she loves, she begins to jealously resent Miaka, and works against her with the cruel Nakago to summon her own god first.
Yes, I like this anime a lot. Although the romance can be tough to take at times (""MIAAAKKKAAAAA!"" ""TAMAHOMEEEEEEE!"") and I like neither Miaka NOR Tamahome very much, it's not a big deal, there are other aspects that I love. Like, for example, the wonderful Nuriko. He is my favorite character, and one of the most entertaining to watch, in my humble opinion. Most of the secondary characters have a little something to love, particularly Chichiri and Tasuki, who not only provide great comic relief, but who's partnership in the later episodes seems so genuine that it might as well be real life. The dynamics between the seishi is really what makes the show; not all the business about Suzaku and gods. There wasn't anything really special between the Seiryu seven, so their scenes were not nearly as interesting to watch.
The animation is nothing special. It gets a little sloppy at times, and sometimes the characters' motions are a bit jerky. There are some lovely colors used, however. I know that sounds incredibly lame, but Suzaku's vibrant reds and golds just make it come to life for you. However, Yu Watase, who did the original manga story and artwork, had much more vivid character designs, and compared to hers, they look a bit squashed.
The music could be very nice at times (the opening comes to mind, with it's Ancient China meets peppy J-Pop approach) but some of the other music was a bit over the top (Miaka and Tamahome's theme was quite overplayed... I got pretty sick of it). The voice acting I had no problem with, generally. Nuriko redefined the ""bishounen with a girly voice"" stereotype, Chichiri was the same genius behind Escaflowne's Van and Fruits Basket's Kyo, Hotohori's made every fan girl's dream come true, and Miaka's was just plain annoying.
Fushigi Yuugi, despite it's failings, is a favorite of mine. This isn't necessarily because of a thrills-a-minute plot, or a fantastic, deep meaning, or splendid animation. I love it because it creates characters you can fall in love with, and get extremely attached to, which, as this anime proves, can be hazardous. Keep a box of tissues handy. You'll need it.

I watched a few episodes of the English dub and decided that I didn't really care so much for the animation (not nearly up to par with Yu Watase's artwork in the manga), I wasn't so crazy about the voice of Miaka, and I thought that maybe I should just stick with the manga.
But then, the more watched, the more I realized that this was a great series, with deeper messages about friendship, true love and the attrocities of war.  I began to see why Gilles Poitras, author of Anime Essentials: Everything a fan needs to know, placed Fushigi Yugi in his list of 41 recommended titles.  I have to admit that the first half of the series pales in comparison to the second half, but you have to get through part one to get to part two, so give this series a chance.  It's worth it in the end.",1082419200,2,972,4.232432432432432

I know what you're thinking ""just another shoujo anime"", but you're  COMPLETELY WRONG. The basic story is of a girl named Miaka, and her friend Yui who get transported to another world through a book. Once there, they meet Tamahome( one of the hottest and money-grubbiest anime characters ever).Tamahome is money- grubby for a reason, and is a wonderful, sweet, and kind character. Yui is then sent back to our world leaving Miaka all alone in a strange world ( Tamahome left them after saving them from slave traders). Miaka is convinced Tamahome took Yui and starts looking for him. I don't want to spoil the plot, but there is a mission Miaka and Tamahome are sent on, to make all of Miaka's dreams come true (I won't tell you what it was). She meets all kinds of colorful charcters. She falls deaspearately in love with Tamahome (he loves her too), and their love is tested countless times, with all kinds of different adventures. But don't get me wrong it isn't all lovey doovey, there is sooooooo much plot I can't even describe it to you.",1080086400,2,1158,4.732673267326732

The first 1/3 of the series was EXCELLENT. The storyline was unique and fascinating, the characters loveable and interesting, but I got to the middle of the series, and all this weird crap about virginity, losing virginity and sex done in such distasteful manner was very very displeasing. There was a particular episode i cringed through where miaka ends up being in her bra and panties half the time. ECH. All the angst and strange circumstances miaka and tamahome and hotohori put themselves into got more and more annoying, til i wanted to bash them all over the heads and scream. The story picks up again near the end, and I'd have to say the last episode was very good. The animations was not done very well, since so many of the scenes were still cells on stupid sparkly backgrounds. ALL, and i mean ALL of the fighting scenes consisted of still cells slowly scrolling in one direction. Talk about cheap animation. Anyways, what shines in FY is the unique storyline (the first half, anyways), the endearing side characters, and some cool character design. What really sucks is animation, music, some very stupid character/plot developments in the middle, tamahome and miaka.",1077753600,3,1349,4.720338983050848

Anyway, any true Fushigi Yugi fan would love this. It's truly amazing. Of course, its better to start of with the manga. There is a reason this might be better and the manga might be better. A flaw is that if you read the manga, you kinda develop a voice for each character in your head, and the actually seiyuu may very well disapoint you. And whether you are a sub or dub fan, sub is better on this. The english voices are very random, and none of them are very good for the characters. For example Chichiri's annoying girlish voice in English, and Hotohori's overly formal one. As well as Miaka's highly mature one. I think that the casting people jkust randomly picked people.
THis contains wepisode 1-26. It's trully amazing. But keep some tissues at hand. Even if you're not a very emotional person(like unemotional me), you'll probably cry. I know I did. It's very sad. People do die, and people are seperated, and many depressing things happen. So this is a show for those wh o can handle such things.

That aside, this story rocks!  And if you don't believe me, watch it anyway - let it prove to you!  You already know the premise, Two modern day Japanese school girls stuck in modern China.  What you don't know is about the wide array of characters.  Do you like ditzy cute girls? Miaka's your woman! Like evil, murdering men? Nakago!  Cross dressers? Monks? Transvestites?

It was my first anime series that I was introduced to, and nothing has come close to how much I love it.  I have seen this entire series 8 times, and certain episodes 20-30 times, no joke!  The story is pretty general, but the characters are simply amazing and compelling.  The characters have so much depth, you often forget you are watching a ""cartoon.""  Miaka is a character that develops so much through the course of the series, it's so hard to imagine when you first meet her.  But, the Suzaku Seven characters are what make the entire series.  They have such human depth its amazing.  They are supportive, protective, complex and imaginative, as humans generally are. Through out the journey of the series, they're mission becomes more than just granting three wishes. They learn to trust one another, learn to love and accept each person for who they are.  For anime lovers, it has everything!  Drama, comedy, fantasy, love, magic (in many forms) and martial arts/ action.  Not to mention, that the Suzaku Seven are up against one of the all time best villians in history!  Nakago, the General and leader of the Seriu Seven is simply down right great.  He is complex, minipulative, desructive and a worthy advesary.  You love to hate him.  I can go on and on about this series.  And for those anime fans whom hate English dubs, this one has a FANTASTIC dub!  It is accurate and performed beautifully.  I'm probably biased, because it is the first anime I was introduced to, but I've seen plenty more, and no other anime/ movie has ever struck a chord in me like this has.  It's made me cry, laugh histarically, and make me cheer on these complex characters.  I reccomend it to everyone, especially anime lovers.

1059446,4,6305596344,"These DVDs have their ups and downs. I'll start with the good things for the fanatics. The animation is beautiful. And when it's not, it's cute. The story is great and original. It has good action, more than enough flirting/romantic scenes, and Tamahome is good looking for an anime character, I'll sadly admit. I'm so ashamed of myself. So yah, good looking guys and pretty women.
Downs are, first of all, Miaka was ANNOYING. It took me a while to get used to her voice. Ruby's voice (I only listen to dubs first, sorry!) it's pretty I'll admit, but it'd be best if she were a secondary character. And the way she rolls her tongue every time she names a Japanese name (if you guys notice at all) just gets on my nerves. Hey, at least she's into it. Anyway, I've finally figured out when to turn the sound up and down with her. Second of all, the charisma is too...Shakespeare-ish. ""Will you come back to me, my love?"" Pathetic. Whoever wrote 'My Love' on the script has to be a chick. (Oops...stereotypical statement, eh? We all do it.) Third, if it's gonna be 13 and up, it has to be more clean. Some of it is ridiculous. You'll see what I mean. Fourth, relating to one, Miaka is too focused on herself. Yes, she thinks about Tamahome and Hotohori (sp?) a lot, but there's way too much, ""Goodbye...FOREVER! *sob sob sob* I had to say goodbye to him!"" (making it harder than it is) and the next day ""I have to go find him/her!"" and then the next day, it's the same as the first day. You get it, right?
My point is, it's good for the emotional girls who like chick movies. I'm not saying it's bad. It's actually really good, and sad at some parts (but you won't cry unless you're an emotional girl who likes chick movies.) It's up there with my favorites, but it will never sum up to Bubblegum Crisis Tokyo 2040, Princess Nine, Ranma Half, and Steel Angel Kurumi, my ultimate favorites.

Meanwhile Miaka's best friend, Yui, is tricked into hating Miaka and becoming the Priestess of Seriyu for a rival Empire. Miaka also falls in love with Tamahome, but he's only a character in a book!
My thoughts: Tied for my favorite anime. Has it all, comedy, action, adventure, romance, hot guys..... There is a rather large amount of SD used, which some people don't like, but I think it adds to the show. It's a long show, with this boxed set and another one, but a lot happens and it never seemed to drag (to me). Miaka's voice is a little annoying at first, but I got used to it, and Hotohori's voice more than makes up for Miaka's.
My personal opinion is that if you could melt the Suzaku seven into one you'd have the perfect man. Tamahome's devotion, Hotohori's gentleness, Nuriko's strength, Chichiri's humor, Tasuki's passion, Mitsukake's caring, and Chiriko's wisdom all in one... perfect. :-)

1059449,5,6305596344,"I first heard about this anime from seeing it online and asking my friend about it. She is a huge anime source for me, so I always go to her when I'm interested in anime I've seen around the web. It was Christmas time, and I decided to get the box set of it. I took a really big risk of getting it at a store with no returns, and it being horrible, but it turned out that it was one of the best I've ever seen. My all time favorite anime is Escaflowne, but Fushigi Yugi is giving Escaflowne a run for its money. Aside from Escaflowne's intensidy (and the super hot Van), Fushigi Yugi has seriousness, but laugher the whole way through the first box set. It also has romance, and strong friendships. One downside is that is rushes through the action, but enough so you can see what happens, and how intense it's supposed to be.
  It's basically about a girl named Miaka going to a library with her friend Yui and getting trapped in a book. They are saved by one of the Suzaku seven members just before they got sold off from some slave traders. Tamahome asks for money, which they don't have. He walks off, as Yui runs after him, very upset. Miaka is distracted trying to find some money, as Yui gets taken back to their world. Miaka assumes that Tamahome took Yui, so she wonders around looking for him. Tamahome saves Miaka from many life or death situations before she decides that she is the Priestess of Suzaku. Long story short, it turns out into a huge romance and betral story, with twists and turns throughout the whole series.
  I don't think the romance was overrated, because it shows the intensity of Miaka's and Tamahome's relationhip, and how far they would go for each other. They only downside, is that there is a cliffhanger at the end of every episode. Than once you find one without a cliffhanger, you'll be left thinking ""Thats it? Wheres the cliffhanger?"" I recommend getting both of the box sets, because the end of the Suzaku series has a HUGE cliffhanger.
  Lucky for me, I'll hopefully be getting the other box set around Christmas again. All I have left to say is not to be discouraged by reviews of bad taste. Take a chance like I did, and discover a 52 series anime that you've been missing out on.",1037404800,2,2226,4.390776699029126
1059450,5,6305596344,"I started out watching anime with Sailor Moon. Then I was into other things, like Pokemon and Dragon Ball Z. But this by far takes the cake!
This is a series for just about anybody. It has romance, action, drama, tragedy, miracles, and no one can forget comedy! That's what hooked me first. I started out reading the manga's, and after the first one I WAS HOOKED!!
It's about a fifteen year old girl, Miaka. She's a normal student preparing for her high school entrance exams. One day at the library, she and her friend Yui find a book and literally get sucked into it. Inside it, Miaka and Yui find themselves in Ancient China. They are rescued by none other than the hot Tamahome!! *grin* One thing leads to another, and Miaka finds herself as the Priestess of Suzaku. Miaka must find the seven Suzaku Warriors in order to summon Suzaku. She definitally matures, finding true love (Tamahome) learning of pain, betrayal (Yui), hope, faith, etc. Many things happen, and Miaka finds herself against her best friend Yui. They become sworn enemies when Yui becomes the Priestess of Seiryu. This ends at a cliffhanger,you learn of the impersonation of one of her Suzaku warriors, and that Miaka must find a new way to summon Suzaku.
 Suprisingly, unlike a lot of other anime's that stray from the original manga's, this one sticks pretty close to the manga. There are only minor changes,like the reason they go into the room and learn of the book, Miaka's link with her brother, and when Tamahome's braid gets chopped off. Trust me, if your looking for something to keep you interested to the very last second, this is it! And you can't forget the hotness! Weather your a guy or girl...! SO MANY PRETTY PEOPLE TO CHOOSE SOME! Tamahome is always someone's favorite, but I LOVE CHICHIRI AND TASUKI! And Nuriko. They are the most hysterical characters.

In addition, Miaka, the main character, is horribly dumb, and it doesn't make sense that such a bucko would lead the gang.  There's bad mixture between humor and tragedy there, and the music repeats itself too - you'll get sick of it very soon.

1059499,4,6305596344,"Every once in awhile some anime comes along that has otakus saying ""DUDE!!  DUDE!!  YOU GOTTA SEE THIS!!!  THIS IS THE GREATEST ANIME EVER!!!""  And it turns out that the anime in question turns out to be so hyped up that it ends up dissapointing.  Well, ""Fushigi Yugi"" is no exception.  However, even though ""Fushigi Yugi"" may not be the greatest, it is certainly light years ahead from mediocre.  And is definitely worth watching...many times over.
By now, you probably have read the plot either from some other otaku or from someone else's review.  Basically, two girls find a book that sends them to a mythical universe, the Universe of the Four Gods to be correct.  There they meet a vast array of heroes and villains, face the trials of love and hate, and are even pitted against one another.  There's more but I'll let you all figure it out for yourselves.  Behind it all is a remarkable (if not cliched) love story.
The show is based on Yu Watase's popular shoujo (basically meaning ""for girls"" ) manga.  Now the instant I say ""shoujo"" I end up turning off the attention of the male otakus.  However, they must know that ""Gundam Wing' was meant for a shoujo audience as well.  So , if you've watched ""Gundam Wing"" and liked it, you will like/love this.
Much like ""Gundam Wing"" the series has plenty of love story for the girls, and lots of action for the guys.  The story is unrelenting in its pacing (this is after all 52 episodes worth of story, not counting the OVAs).  One minute the characters are caught in a wind of romance, next minute they're being tossed through the chaos of war, then they're faced with a new problem.  Sort of an emotional rollercoaster that gives it a rather European feeling to it, and never lets go of the viewers attention.
However, the plot is uneven at times.  Granted, this is a shoujo, so it is heavy on love.  So heavy that at times it feels unusual when the two lovers start saying each others names...over...and over...and over again.  There is almost a smothering feeling with the continuous ""I love you but I can't"" theme.  At times it can be sweet, at other times it can drive a person to drive pins into their ears and eyes.
But, if there is one thing I can say about the love story aspect of ""Fushigi Yugi,"" unlike most anime that feature this kind of story, the emotions the characters feel towards each other are real.  So real that I couldn't believe that they were scripted.
Now, if there is one thing I could write accolades about; wonderful cast.  The characters seemed as if they were created with personalities first, THEN molded into the bodies you see.  The characters are so well made that viewers will feel the happiness, the pain, the sorrow, and the hope that the characters go through.  You'd be hard-pressed not to like this wonderful crew of beguiled heroes and villains.
The animation is crisp and clear, almost on par with anime like ""Trigun"" and ""Gundam X.""  There are only a few uses of stock-footage in battle scenes but that's forgivable.
The art is good but could have been a little better.  This kind of artwork nearly reminded me of the plain art of ""Berserk"" or ""Slayers.""  But like the stock footage, this can be overlooked.
Good music.  Another plus.  Nothing more to say on that.
Now, my MAJOR FLAW with the series is purely of an anime nature.  Too many people like this anime.  If you mention ""Fushigi Yugi"" in front of any otaku, they will go crazy.  But that isn't the main problem; many of them don't even know why.  Their reasons fall on the same plane; ""Dude, it had a good plot"" or ""It was so cute!!  WAI WAI WAI!!!""  As one who has basically grown up with anime, it almost deters everything that anime stood for.  If one wants to truly appreciate anime, you cannot do it by picking out the anime EVERYONE and their iguana know and love.  There are few otaku who see beyond the ""new stuff"" and look at the classics that made anime what it is.  Granted, this IS A GOOD ANIME (I said it, now don't lynch me) but there are others to.
In the end, ""Fushigi Yugi"" is like an old working golden watch you find in a treasure chest.  Though it may be an old concept and has a couple of scratches, you can't help but look beyond the flaws and see it for it's real beauty and that it still gets its job done.  ""Fushigi Yugi"" is a must watch for all anime fans.

The only bad thing is is that the romance will start to get sappy and old soon, VERY SOON! All the characters have well thought out personalities and background info, so you will only be confused about what is happening some of the time, but it is usually explained.  If you get this, you will definetly need to get the Seiryu box and Oni box also.  By the end of this you will be DYING to know what happens next!

I'm sure everyone else has written about the story, about how Miaka gets pulled into the book ""The Universe of the Four Gods"" and ends up making her dreams come true.  But did you know that she also manages to cry, laugh, fight, die (almost), and still keep on fighting for those she loves?

Miaka and Yui go into the room, where they discover an ancient Chinese book called ""The Universe of the Four Gods"". Yui, who could read the language, opens the book with Miaka and begins to read..

I bought the fifth novel in the manga series and read it very quickly.  It was soo hard to put down that I simply couldn't, and I read straight through it.  Little had I realized that I had fallen in love with the series.  I soon bought the rest of the manga, and finally received both Suzaku and Seiryu dvd sets for Christmas (all in one month!).  Thats how fast you can become attached to the series.  The Suzaku dvd is wonderful.  The series really doesn't take a lot of time setting up the plot, which is great, compared to some animes.  It does become a little tedious though when the volley of names continue for half an hour. The animation isn't anything exciting but is simple, and gets the point across.  Also, there are a few differences between the manga and the anime, which tend to become annoying (i.e. Chichiri says 'you know' at the end of sentences instead of 'no da'.  You get used to them fairly quickly though. FY is a well-rounded anime, with its moments of both happiness and sorrow.  Its a good combination though.  All of the characters have their unique traits that make the story interesting, and the plot it unpredictable, always leaving you on the edge of your seat. In fact, even at the end of the dvd set, you keep hoping there's another episode to resolve the situation, even though you know there isn't one.

1059532,4,6305596344,"I recently revived my interest in Fushigi Yuugi after seeing an episode at my friend's house.  I realized how much I enjoyed the series, and bought the first boxed set (Suzaku).  It arrived quickly, and after watching the videos once again, I remember why I liked it so much...and found some things that bugged me.
To start with, the series has marvelous characterization.  Each character is well-rounded with their own individual skills, flaws, and quirks. Hotohori, gallant emperor and at times submissive to narcissism can at times feel inferior.  Always-smiling Nuriko, never hesitating to encourage others, possesses a secret sadness of his own.  Even the comedic Chichiri has a story behind the mask. The only flaw in characterization would have to be the main character, Miaka.  She's peppy and cute in the first few episodes, but as time goes on she really begins to grate on one's nerves.  She is placed on a pedestal and is truly unworthy of all the affection she receives.  You will be letting out your share of winded sighs as yet again, another character confesses his love for Miaka.  However, she's only one character, and the rest of the cast definitely compensates.
The plot is also very entertaining.  It's hard not to get into the story, it pulls you along and won't let go.  It always succeeds in pleasantly surprising you (well, except for volume ten...but that's not in this box set ^_^) and keeps you entertained. It can become repetitive at times, and you might want to scream, ""WE KNOW YOUR NAMES ALREADY!"" after another volley of ""Miaka!"" ""Tamahome!"" ""Miaka!"" ""Tamahome!"", but such occasions are rare.
The soundtrack is nothing special, there are a few great tracks yet some you don't really care for, but you have to admit that the ending song is awesome. XD The original character songs are great as well, yet you'll have to buy the OSTs or download them to get to experience the joy. ^_^
On the topic of sound, I have to say that the voice actors are all incredible (in the subtitled, the dub is...uh...not so incredible).  The casting is exquisite.  The voices match each character to a T, but the real jewels are Nuriko's voice, Tamahome's voice, and Tasuki's voice.  You can tell the actors really enjoy what they are doing and are giving each performance their all.  I lurv the voices muchly.
Lastly, the art. The animation is not the best, but compared to Sailor Moon, any anime art looks better.  You can tell that the different sets of animators have very different styles.  One episode might wow you with its aesthetics, the next might disappoint.  The animation is never truly awful, but it leaves something to be desired.  Nonetheless, it's a pleasant watch.
Overall, I love Fushigi Yuugi.  It's an incredibly fun, incredibly addictive romp that you'll grow to love.  Yes, it has its flaws, but really, nothing's perfect.  I enjoyed it thoroughly, and hopefully, you will as well.",1004745600,2,2919,4.842741935483871

They meet the gorgeous Suzaku seishi warriors, Tamahome, Hotohori, Tasuki, ChiChiri, Nuriko (>.<), Mitsukake, and Chiriko (the real one).  When they meet the opposing Seiryu seishi, you get another three gorgeous guys!  I love the way that the opposition isn't totally evil, they just want revenge on Miaka who seems to be the source of their suffering.  (Poor Miaka, no wait, I don't feel sorry for her!).
As to the animation, it could be better, and it took a while to not scowl every time someone went super-deformed (Catch that fake miniature deformed general!) or chibi, but it's kinda cute.  The dubs aren't half bad, and the original Japanese tracks are great.

Within the story you meet a lot of interesting characters, one if which you'll probably grow found of (Tasuki's my man ^_^) The style is a blend of romance, comedy with an adventure/fantasy touch to it.

1059587,5,6305596344,"Fushigi Yuugi is a 52-episode Anime series slightly similar to Sailor Moon...only multi-times better and much less repetitive. Yuu Watase does a great job in making it clear which scenes she means to be funny/kawaii, and which ones she means to be serious/sad. The SD scenes are beyond hilarious, the serious scenes are deep and moving, the death scenes will have you soak up a tissue box *eyes get quivery just at the thought of that particular part in episode 33*.
The characters is definately one of Fushigi Yuugi's strongest points. Hey, when you get a group of guys that are almost too bishounen to be bishounen, what's not to like? No really, Yuu Watase has created some of the most lovable characters in Anime (*cough* Nuriko *coughcough*), anyone will tell you that. A narcistic emperor, a purple-haired drag (Nuri-chan! ^^;), a wondering monk, a hot-headed bandit whose afraid of the water, a thirteen-year-old genius (who looks like he's six--very kawaii), a brush-haired doctor, and 'little ghost' are a few examples.

1059589,5,6305596344,"At first glance, Fushigi Yuugi appears to be a mediocre series, based on the exploits of a shallow girl that every man seems to fall in love with, and no one knows why.
However, upon a second glance, the story opens to reveal characters that are much more complex than they first appear. Miaka, for instance, appears to be a flightly girl, with nothing more serious on her mind than food. However, as the series progresses, it is revealed that her capactiy for selflessness and sacrifice knows no bounds. She would willingly die to save others, and it is this incredibly generous nature of hers that redeems her as a heroine.
Fushigi Yuugi is a highly complex story that must be seen in its entirety. There is no repetition, unlike Sailor Moon and Utena where they often use stock footage to fill in the animation time. Fushigi Yuugi is an orginal story with a beginning, a middle and an end, even though it also has the potential to move on in new directions.
A highly engaging DVD that is worth the price, if only to be able to switch back and forth between the Japanese and English actors. ^.^",977443200,2,1096,4.5125628140703515

Let me emphasize this- amazingly attractive. If you're a woman between 13 and 30 you cannot miss these tapes- and you might as well buy the box set, because once you see one you'll need to see the rest. It's what we wish Sailor Moon had been. As charming as Disney but with a depth perfect for adults. Black and white become gray- it confronts us with reality while showing us the escape we always dream of. I think we can all see ourselves in these characters. It's a rollercoaster ride of laughter, tears, and awe. A powerful story glittered with humor and charm.

1059609,5,6305596344,"Fushigi Yuugi is the story of two Japanese girls who get sucked into a fictional version of ancient China through an old Chinese book called the ""Universe of the Four Gods.""
The main character is one of the two girls, Miaka Yuki, a sometimes ditzy / always hungry junior high school student.  In order to get back to the real world, she has agreed to fulfill a legend in the book's world by becoming the Priestess of Suzaku.  She has to gather her 7 celestial warriors in order to summon Suzaku and have her wishes granted.
The character development is excellent.  Through a mixture of comedy and drama, you can't help but get attached to each of the characters.
I highly recommend this anime to everyone - 16 or older.  As other reviewers have said, FY does tackle some pretty serious issues now, and gets very serious in the second season - see the Seryiu box set.
It's a lot of money, but it's worth it.  This small package contains 8 VHS tapes worth of anime!  It has one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard, lovable characters, and an awesome story that's filled with emotion.  It's just great.  Without a doubt, this is my favorite anime.

But then a lot people told me that I would love it. All I can say is THANK YOU to those people who told me to buy it. Of course I'm still cringing when I think of how much money I spent on it and of how much money the second half is going to cost me but it was really worth it!
The storyline is wonderfully set up, the manga is a bit different but they mostly implement each other very well. Although it is a lot of shonen (girl), there is plenty to see if you like action. Some of the fight scenes got really bloody as well. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone under 13.
And this is not for someone who doesn't like sad movies/anime... it made me cry at least 5 or 6 times and I don't usually cry in movies. Yu Watase apparently did this so that the characters would seem more real and empathetic. It was rather well done, however, with the humorous experiences set in between sad moments which made the emotional impact a bit smaller. It is plenty sad though and I think this is mostly due to the fact that the eyes are drawn with so much care in this anime that you can almost feel the character's pain just by looking in his/her eyes.

If you like romance stories you'll absolutely LOVE Fushigi Yuugi.  Whether you're a guy or girl you'll fall in love with the characters.

1059668,4,6305596344,"If you haven't heard of (or watched) this series, there are only two things you really need to know. 1) It's a shoujo drama, and 2) it's incredibly melodramatic.
Well, now that I've scared away all the DBZ  fans, onto the review.
Yes, Fushigi Yuugi is a melodramatic shoujo drama  (soap opera might be a better term), complete with quite a few cliches of  the genre. Anyone with an aversion for romance, melodrama, and the like,  may want to think twice before considering this series. But you know what?  I simply loved it.
Fushigi Yuugi's overall plot can probably best be  described as The Neverending Story meets El-Hazard. The story itself occurs  in a book entitled ""The Universe of the Four Gods"", and as one  reads the book, the adventure becomes real. As for the El-Hazard  comparison, both series feature teenaged students getting transported to a  strange new world, where they partake in a series of adventures, and  incidentally, end up wearing their school uniforms most of the time. Of  course, the differences are quite obvious. El-Hazard tends to be a bit more  comedic and less serious, while Fushigi Yuugi is fairly relationship  oriented, and much more dramatic at times.
Mind you, while there  certainly is no shortage of romance, and quite a few dramatic moments as  well, this series also has a decent mix of fantasy, comedy, and action.  Fantasy, because of the mystical nature of the series, comedy thanks to  liberal use of super-deforming, and action because whenever the Seishi  clash, there's always more than a few scuffles.
Being a shoujo anime,  character development is paramount. Miaka is your typical junior high  school student putting off studying for the high school entrance exams.  Actually, ""typical"" isn't entirely true. She does have a few  distinguishing quirks, most notably her fervent appetite, that makes her  somewhat of an oddball. Of course, the fact that she and her best friend,  Yui (who is level-headed and studious, unlike Miaka) travel to another  world makes them stand out even more. It is in this world that Miaka  becomes the priestess of Suzaku (one of four animal gods) and undergoes a  quest to find the seven Suzaku Seishi and return home. Of the seven Seishi,  she meets Tamahome first, falls in love, and hence, begins a long, arduous  relationship with him which is the driving point of the whole series. The  second Seishi, Hotohori, the emperor of Konan, also falls in love with  Miaka, and so emerges a love triangle. One of my favorite Seishi, Noriko,  shows up soon after. At first, I absolutely despised her, but later she  became quite likable, especially once a certain secret gets revealed. My  overall favorite Seishi was Tasuki, who was played for laughs most of the  time, but was just so damned cool. ^_^ Chichiri, another comedic Seishi was  also quite funny and charming, especially the way he ended every sentence  in ""no da"" (which has no English equivalent). Of the two  remaining Seishi, Mitsukake and Chiriko, not a lot of time was spent  developing them. This was unfortunate, because they ended up serving as  minor characters, and during a few scenes which otherwise could have been  quite dramatic, ended up somewhat shallow because there wasn't much emotion  attached to them. There are plenty more characters, including Miaka's  brother, and most of them are developed nicely.
On the other side of the  coin, there are also a handful of villains who make life rather unpleasant  for Miaka and her cohorts. The number one baddie is none other than Nakago,  who embodies everything that a true villain should. His malicious behavior,  deadpan calmness, and wry half-smiles truly make him someone worth hating.  He also has a handful of underlings, but of which only a couple are  properly developed, namely Amiboshi and Suboshi, twin brothers. The rest,  though, weren't focused on quite enough, and ended up not being all that  interesting.
The storyline, though, is both one of the series' greatest  strengths and greatest weakness. It takes a full 52 episodes to tell  Miaka's quest, and for people that enjoy the series, this is quite a  blessing. However, at the same, the length is also a detriment. Some parts  of the series really begin to drag, and the same plot devices are used over  and over to the point of tedium. Miaka and Tamahome's relationship is the  best example of this. One minute they're a happy couple, and the next  they're splitting up. Then they're back again, only to break up again. This  of course, is accompanied by melodramatic cries of ""Miaka!""  ""Tamahome!"" ""Miaka!"" ""Tamahome!""  ""Miaaaaaaakaaaa!"" ""Tamahoooomeeee!"". I honestly  couldn't count the number of times this went on. It was a bit excessive, to  say the least.
Fushigi Yuugi's presentation is also a mixed bag. The  artwork itself is pretty functional, and the characters had good visual  designs. The animation, on the other hand, wasn't terribly spectacular. I  even noticed some reused animation here and there (and I'm betting there  was more that I wasn't aware off). The music, though, was pretty good. So  good in fact, that I even bought the OST. I really liked some of the themes  in the series, and the opening and closing songs were quite nice.
The  bottom line is, if you enjoy shoujo dramas, fantasy, or comedy, then you'll  probably love this series. But for anyone who prefers more shonan-oriented  anime, or for that matter, may not have time to watch the whole thing,  might be better off leaving Fushigi Yuugi alone.",957052800,14,5519,4.9195652173913045

The DVD feature  were also good, but considering this was my first DVD-anime I had no idea  what to expect, so don't take the features into consideration from my  review. I didn't use them much even though I saw the button.

Oh, the dialouge.  Personally I watched it all the way through with the Japanese and  subtitles. For some reason I hated the english voices.

Another thing is, that the  intermission breaks are very annoying. You will be at a very serious part  and then this annoying music and chibi characters come out. If it was made  more seriously, and had a little more depth it would be the ultimate, but  right now it's just a great movie that grates on your nerves a little bit.

Watching Fushigi Yugi  in DVD really brings out the true value of animation originally intended to  be seen by the producers. That is why I switched from buying and collecting  animes in VHS format to DVD format since VHS will wear out in 8 years.  It  is killing me that I have to wait for Pioneer to come out with the rest of  the second season (episode 27-52) of FY in DVD format [since I have been so  moved and attached to the story line] ^_^.
My recommendation is that :  GET THIS FUSHIGI YUGI : DVD SUZAKU BOX SET as soon as possible !  ^_^ Oh  yeah...as I always recommend to everyone...watch the series in Original  Japanese language (of course w/ English sub)!  Trust me. ^_^ SJ.",947203200,,1541,4.467625899280575

FUSHIGI YUGI is one of the  best ""love story"" anime around. It is well balanced with love  story, romance, action, humor, excellent music, awesome graphic, and an  intriguing story line. If you like true anime love story, then this is a  must buy. This DVD edition is very much worth it.

1059743,5,6305596344,"This is an excellent anime, yes, but it also isn't for everyone.  The plot is fairly involved, and really only gets going about episode 16 or so.  The first ten episodes will make you think this is going to be one melodramtic  soap opera, but HANG IN THERE, it does get better.  There is a good bit of  action in this series, but this is not Escaflowne or Rurouni  Kenshin.
Also, keep in mind that FY is 52 episodes long, and if you've  never seen it, DO NOT watch the last half of episode 26, of you will be on  HUGE cliffhanger.  Pioneer hasn't made a commitment to release the  second-half on DVD until they see how well the first half does.
Couple of  things about the DVD, itself... The chapters are not laid out well.  Every  single episode is broken this way:
(1) Intro (yes, they included the  opening in front of EVERY SINGLE episode...)  (2) Episode review/recap and  Part I (before the commerical break/halfway point)  (3) Part II  (Post-halfway-point) (4) Ending (they also included the ending with every  single episode, which is nice, because they are a little different) (5)  Preview of next episode...
If you are watching this more than one episode  at a time, this is a little annoying.  Although the opening and ending are  good, seeing it 20+ times is a little much.  However, if's a simple matter  of skipping ahead to the next chapter, so it's a minor annoyance at worst.  However, you will need to MANUALLY fast forward through the episode recap  if you want to skip it... why Pioneer didn't include the review in the same  chapter as the opening is beyond me.  This is aggravating.
To make up for  it, however, the packaging is top-notch.  A Plastic Slip cover keeps the  four DVD holder together, and very clean.  Also, Pioneer decided to  dual-layer the DVDs instead of dual-siding them, which is extremely nice  (means you don't have to worry about fingerprints on one side).  If you are  into subtitling (which I recommend because the English voice actors, while  competent, are not that good), the subtitles are very clean, and well done.  There were only a couple of places that the translation wasn't as good as  the fan-subs I first watched this series on.
All in all, this is a good  deal, especially if you don't own the series already.",946857600,59,2269,4.600502512562814

7892932,2,6305596344,"Sometimes when Manga go into a TV Series its not always a good idea. This had potential of being good but it failed in too many areas. The goofiness was too much, and the english voice casting is really awful. There were parts that were so cheesy that i had to fast forward it, and not to mention the fighting scenes aren't that great.  I do love the art work of Yuii Watase and plenty of the episodes character design is pretty much like the Manga but it just didn't do it for me. This was poorly produced in my opinion.

7892935,4,6305596344,"Before my ex and I separated, this was one of the first animes we watched together.  One of the ones that truly brought us together in the beginning.  Full of romance and mysticism, heroes and villains, magic and gods.  Wishes and dreams.

You'll become well acquainted with the cast of characters -- annoyed with the same things they're annoyed about in each other's personalities, and if you fall far enough into the story you may even shed a tear or two.  All in all a good experience, particularly if you let it carry you away with it.

7892937,3,6305596344,"Overall, I was pleased with this purchase. However, this is the first series where I actively wished bodily harm/death on the main character. LOL Miaka is possibly the most annoying heroine I've seen in anime. The lightning speed in which she falls in love with Tomahome is a major glitch in the storyline. I found myself rooting for Hotohori to win Miaka's affection over Tomahome the entire story. Hotohori was handsome, charming, vain, and honorable and oh yeah, the King. His vanity was hilarious. For some reason, he also fell in love with the whiny, average-looking, Miaka, who happen to already be in love with someone else. He should have had more on-screen time. Chichiri was engaging and funny. Nuriko was the most entertaining character, by far. Her/His humor helped the story along, even during highly irritable Miaka/Tomahoma love/yell fests. I watched the first and second box sets back to back, so I have the overall picture. The story itself could use some vast rewriting, but one cannot dispute the overall entertainment factor of Fushigi Yugi. I give this 3 1/2 stars only due to the ridiculousness of Miaka's and Tomahome's 'love'. Besides that, the story was actually pretty good.",1217203200,,1200,5.005

Fushigi Yuugi is romantic, action packed, emotional, exciting, and deep. The first time I watched it, I didn't take a single break through the entire anime series. The OVA's were kind of a let-down, but the series...fantastic!",1176940800,2,363,4.967213114754099
