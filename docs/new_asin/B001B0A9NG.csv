8367666,1,B001B0A9NG,"What a shocker! During the CHERRY PINK AND APPLE BLOSSOM WHITE track, the lead player went into an uncontrolable coughing fit. The performance should have been deleted and replaced with a faultless one even if it had to be recorded after the audience had left.
Unthoughtful, disgraceful, unprofessional!
Don't buy it! Even if it had been faultless, you really cannot watch the dvd more than twice. I wonder if the coughing occurs on the cd version as well!",1329523200,,456,4.858974358974359
8367667,5,B001B0A9NG,"If you are a fan of great musical performance then buy this DVD! Jerry Murad's performance and virtuosity is second to none.
This is a must have DVD for fans of all music genres, whether a fan or student of the harmonica, this live concert will open the door to a style and technique of playing that is as relevant today as it was back in the day!

I purchased ""One Night In San Francisco"" when it was first released and have since purchased a few as gifts which always elicits a ""where did you get it, it's incredible"" response from the recipient.
This is a well produced video with superb sound quality that begs to be played through a full on audio system. Treat yourself to this DVD, you won't be disappointed!",1265932800,3,714,4.368421052631579
