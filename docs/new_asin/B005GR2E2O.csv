8472206,5,B005GR2E2O,Wonderful bluray. Better with a nice sound system.,1414022400,,50,5.375
8472207,5,B005GR2E2O,Can't stop watching.,1405987200,,20,6.0
8472208,5,B005GR2E2O,I bought this Blu Ray after watch the Isle of Man on tv. The DVD shows the full races and many different angles. The sound quality is amazing and the picture is crystal clear. It's mind boggling when you watch the bikes making curves at 150+ mph and going air borne when the top hills in the road.,1373155200,,297,4.137931034482759
8472209,5,B005GR2E2O,I love sport bikes and scenic pictures. So the TT Isle of Man race is the ultimate combo. I love the slo-mo and arial shots.,1372636800,,124,4.0
8472210,5,B005GR2E2O,"A more polished review than the 2010 Blu ray. Covers all the important stuff - once again the crahes aren't covered though.
Recommended",1367539200,,135,4.913043478260869
8472211,4,B005GR2E2O,awesome viewing if you're a moto race fan.  the shots consist of a lot of on-board dash cam and helicopter camera.  only gripe would be that it does not have enough actually race scenes and too much non action scenes.,1358467200,,217,4.4
8472212,4,B005GR2E2O,"If you don't own an Isle of Man TT blu-ray set, it is definitely worth the money. Especially if you ride ;) I watched this on our 55"" LED and you really get a feel for how nuts these guys are and how dangerous this really is. The sound is great, commentary is great, and makes me want to attend one of these events.

I used to own an R1 and I did some crazy things on that bike, but these guys are the studs. Great extra features too.",1348790400,,434,3.8764044943820224
8472213,5,B005GR2E2O,I LOVE the Isle of Man TT races & hope to be able to attend one someday but until then these DVD's are a great substitute!  You get to see hours & hours of great footage from the race!  Plan on buying the 2012 one ASAP!,1347926400,,219,3.739130434782609
8472214,5,B005GR2E2O,"It's in human nature to be a collector; we start from marbels, stamps, toys etc. If you are a devoted motorcyclist this is not the exeption.. This oustanding DVD has it all; full coverage of the 37.4 miles of Isle of Man, in board, aerial, infrared. It will put you on the rider sit at 200 mi/hr laps. Different winners in different classes. Remember if it's in you, you can never get enough.. you'll be coming back for more!!",1344988800,,426,4.405063291139241
8472215,5,B005GR2E2O,"For any motorcycle enthusiast young are old! The action is fast and furious,I'm ready to go next year and witness it for myself.",1317168000,3,128,4.608695652173913
