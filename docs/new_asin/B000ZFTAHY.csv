8235413,3,B000ZFTAHY,"I wanted to keep this original movie from my favorite Spanish novel, Dona Barbara from Romulo Gallegos.  There is a small section that is distorted but the rest of the movie is ok.",1389139200,,180,4.454545454545454
8235414,4,B000ZFTAHY,"This is a bit of an epic, a long term squabble between good and bad, city life and rural, etc.  It is a bit like the Casa de Los Epiritus, with less magical realism.  It has been made into movies (Maria Felix is miscast)
as well as soap operas.

When visiting or living in a foreign country I always try to find one novel that might give me a good understanding of that country.  I am pretty certain this is the book for people visiting Venezuela, or those with a interest in Latin American culture.  Because the book was written in 1929 I do not recommend reading the Spanish edition unless Spanish is your native tongue.  Even then keep an extensive dictionary handy.

Our Spanish speaking book club, Sociedad Hispana Doylestown, had this as the book of the month, led by a Venezuelan. It is a perfect book for that purpose, as it generates ample discussion.",1382832000,,860,4.4743589743589745
8235415,5,B000ZFTAHY,"Having lived in Venezuela for a few years in the 80's, I always wanted to read about their culture before it became so modern.  The novel represents Venezuela, like  a South American countries which have all come from a barbarous past to the present, which still shows segments of ""barbiere"".  Maria Felix is Dona Barbara.",1314144000,,322,4.818181818181818
8235416,5,B000ZFTAHY,Very cool movie and simple to get whether or not you read the book and it's so much better than the tv show,1292457600,3,107,3.6956521739130435
8235417,5,B000ZFTAHY,"The movie is based on the novel by the famous Romulo Gallegos, who also wrote the script. It shows the life as used to be (or is?) in the Venezuelan plains. I think Maria Felix was born to play to main role and I can't imagine another Doa Barbara than her.",1237766400,6,256,4.03921568627451
