159791,5,0793927536,"Are You Being Served is a smart 1970s 1980s UK BBC comedy.  For the few who might read this knowing nothing about the series it is set in a ficticious department store in England.

The humor is typical bawdy British humor with running jokes and comments about the various staff members complete with sour old bitty, flamboyant gay guy, cute young lady, wolf/womanizer, militant floor manager and store manager without a clue who always seems to have some very nice looking secretaries.",1404172800,,485,4.902439024390244
159792,5,0793927536,"I find these shows especially amusing, as I currently work in a retail department store and can still see most of the people shown herein  (on both sides of the counter). That being the case, I prefer not to mention my store's name so as to protect my employment and health, but you all know who you are, don't you Captain Peacock?",1401408000,,331,4.338709677419355
159793,5,0793927536,"Great DVD, we enjoyed each episode. The characters each are endearing in their own way. I espechially like John Inman as Mr. Humphries.",1397433600,,135,4.913043478260869
159794,5,0793927536,"One of THE best shows ever, hands down. They make excellent gifts as well as being an alternative to the schmutz that's being broadcast today in the US.  I keep one of these in my DVD player at the ready and when NBC & CBS start with their propaganda I turn on one of these....",1386288000,2,277,4.036363636363636
159795,5,0793927536,ARe You Being Served? Is one of the best British comedies I've ever enjoyed. I've loved it for years and love have a collection of all the different volumes available. I would highly recommend this to anyone who loves British comedy.,1382486400,,233,4.7073170731707314
159796,5,0793927536,My husband enjoys this show.  I recently added to his collection with Vol 5 & 6. He's looking forward to more DVDs.,1381276800,,115,4.2272727272727275
159797,4,0793927536,All I can say is if you have series 1 through 5 this one won't disappoint. Everybody at the top of their game. If you are new to this series Vol. 6 is in some ways a good introduction of what the show was like. Not a bad episode in this volume though there are even more better ones in some of the others.,1375401600,2,305,3.78125

159812,5,0793927536,"As I have already stated I have volumes 1-4 on DVD. The reason I started getting Are You Being Served on DVD is because my PBS station was sold, and they hadn't bought the rights to the British sitcoms. I was so upset, but when I found that Amazon and this seller had them in stock, I was so happy! I have to admit Mr. Humphries is my favorite character! Boy he does make me laugh! From Mrs. Slocum to Mr. Lucas ""Are You Being Served"" is my favorite British sitcom! Thank you very much Amazon!",1315094400,3,493,4.145833333333333
159813,5,0793927536,British comedies are absolutely fabulous.  Are you being served is one of my all time favorites.  The combination of characters and situations they get themselves into is hilarious.  I would suggest this series to anyone needing some good laughs and a night of fun.,1313366400,,265,4.9772727272727275
159814,4,0793927536,"I enjoy the pretentiousness of the supervisors in this series. This DVD brings 'Founder's Day' for young Mr. Grace, a temporary relaxation of stuffiness, the defeat of a takeover attempt, and an effort to push Mr. Grainger out. Fortunately, the latter fails.",1290902400,,258,5.166666666666667
159815,4,0793927536,"This group of episodes are the last starring Arthur Brough as Mr. Grainger and the last set of episodes in the season 1-5 boxed set (volume 7 in the set is a bonus disc of interviews).  These shows are not as solid as the earlier episodes in this long running series, but are still very good.  In Founder's Day, the staff puts on a ""This Is Your Life"" presentation for Young Mr. Grace's 80th birthday with mildly amusing stories and even a guest appearance by Mother Humphries.  The Old Order Changes has the staff trying out a new casual approach Young Mr. Grace observed while visiting the United States.  Things get very 1970s at Grace Brothers.  Mr. Lucas' first name also changes from ""James"" to ""Dick"" ostensibly to accommodate one joke.  Mr. Harmon gets a bigger role in Takeover, impersonating a shareholder to help Young Mr. Grace keep control of the company. For once, Capt. Peacock is not in charge and is relegated to the kitchen.
The best episode of this collection is Goodbye, Mr. Grainger, where the senior salesman is in a foul mood and the rest of the staff want him out.  Mr. Harmon informs Grainger of his colleagues' comments and encourages him to write his letter of resignation.  A misunderstanding about a lottery ticket cause a change of heart from the staff, and efforts are made to retrieve the letter from Young Mr. Grace's desk.  Wait until they hear what Grainger wrote in the letter!  In It Pays to Advertise, the staff act in a commercial for Grace Brothers.  The funniest part of this episode is at the end when Young Mr. Grace says his lines while trying to pour champagne into a glass. Like all the AYBS? DVDs, this one has very creative menu pages.  A lift conductor's voice takes you to each episode and there are rotating photos of the Employee of the Month (in this case, Mr. Lucas-it must have been a very slow month).  I highly recommend both boxed sets of this series",1073520000,11,1908,4.576470588235294
159816,5,0793927536,"When I purchased the boxed set of the first 5 series of ""Are You Being Served?"" Amazon.com suggested this DVD as well. It seemed only natural, since it's labeled ""Volume 6"" -- but note that this is a duplicate of the Volume 6 disc in the 7-DVD boxed set!
So despite Amazon.com's suggestion, don't buy this if you're also buying the boxed set. :^>
(I didn't intend to review the disc itself, only to make this information available ... but this DVD is one of the best, and it includes a somewhat rare episode that isn't often shown in on U.S. PBS stations: ""Founder's Day,"" in which the staff put on a ""This Is Your Life""-type presentation for Mr. Grace.)",1041984000,49,654,4.458333333333333

It played all series except the last two which does not play without the pixels and scratchy talking.  I thought these dvds were new.  Very disappointed.,1489449600,,311,4.293103448275862

I have the complete set of ""Are You Being Served""  and love all of them.  Volume 6 spotlights Mr. Grainger as well as Old and young Mr. Grace.  Some of today's English comedy series have gotten more risqu, but I never tire of the clever double entendre humor of Grace Brother's wonderful characters.",1436572800,,475,4.476744186046512
