4398679,5,B004KWVDGY,great foursome (And I started off with just wanting one and here I am with 4!),1409961600,,78,3.9375
4398680,5,B004KWVDGY,Was looking for Hackers and saw this. Was so excited to get all four for the price of one.  Plus I have never seen the second War Games so that was a bonus.  Please with the quality of the DVDs as well.,1377648000,2,202,3.7857142857142856
4398681,5,B004KWVDGY,"""Wargames"" - I had seen before and enjoyed, but ""War Games - The Dead Code"" -- I hadn't. This one ran along the same lines as the first but was/is intriguing to the point that I will watch it again several times. ""Solarbabies"" was different enough to be interesting as what one might expect in the so-called 'After times' of a world destroyed as we now know it. ""Hackers"" -- I found interesting too because of all of the hype in the media about Internet hackers in the news these days, although I still don't understand 'how it works or why bother to get into trouble(?)'

The 4-movies are of Good quality on these 2 back-to-back discs and are worth the money for the set.",1371168000,3,672,4.376

8433558,4,B004KWVDGY,I saw Solar Babies when I was six years old and never forgot it. Saw Hackers just recently and it was rather a delight. Just wish they'd put the movies together logically - they are two-sided disks and they mixed up the War Games 1 and 2 with Solar Babies and Hackers. Makes NO sense unless some bureaucratic dunce thought that people would get rid of the Wargames DVDs.,1466035200,,370,4.3768115942028984

8433561,4,B004KWVDGY,WarGames and Hackers were very good and my reason to purchase. The other two were ok. Good deal for the money.,1443916800,,110,4.285714285714286
8433562,5,B004KWVDGY,The movies were delivered quickly and arrived undamaged.,1439856000,,56,6.125
8433563,4,B004KWVDGY,"War Games was just as good as when I first saw it many years ago. It has held up well. still a winner. War Games 2 was an interesting follow-up albeit much newer it wasn't quite as good as the first one. Love Hackers; the characters are so much fun to watch. Solarbabies was one I'd never even heard of but it was okay, just a bit slow. Guess I'm jaded by all the high-tech, special effects movies I watch now.",1439769600,,410,4.074074074074074
8433564,5,B004KWVDGY,All good except for Solarbabies,1438646400,,31,5.4
