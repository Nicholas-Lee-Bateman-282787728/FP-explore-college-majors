4134074,5,B003KUSUE0,"This show is excellent to say the least.  They make it look so easy.

The only drawback to this is that it is incomplete.  If you purchased the CD years ago and match it with this DVD you find that the DVD has songs that the CD does not and vice-versa. Many have suggested to buy the combo pack to get it all, but that is not the answer; it should be in one place.  Why do they do this?  To think that someone makes a conscious effort to do this is mind-boggling.  Even if you buy both of them how do we know that there wasn't more?  I will never understand these decisions as they happen over and over again. Regardless it's still worth it to view these greats!!!",1289952000,2,664,4.061538461538461
4134075,5,B003KUSUE0,"This was filmed in December, 1983 for an Ontario, Canada, TV station program. It's finally been released on DVD. The visual & sound quality is great. I'm not sure of the total running time, but it is a fairly, lengthly, session, concentrating on a young 29 year old Stevie Ray, with his Fender Stratocaster, Electric Guitar, Number 1, however during the session SRV rotates to playing one or two of his other guitars. The other ""Session Player"" is a mature 60 year old, experienced, professional blues guitarist & singer, Albert King, with his Gibson ""Flying V"", electric guitar (named ""Lucy""). Stevie Ray does switch guitars a couple of times during the session. Stevie had a reputation about being rough on his guitars, kinda like Jerry Lee Lewis was with pianos. Stevie Ray is a right handed guitarist, Albert is a left handed guitarist. This is a great close up, and personal jam session, with the backing band, barely in sight. The main focus is on Stevie Ray & Albert King. Stevie was a young Texas Blues guitarist & singer. Albert was an original, Mississippi Delta Blues guitarist & singer. This session is like a tutorial session, where the older & wiser Albert, jams with Stevie, and gives him advice. The 2 blues guitarists are relaxed and ""laid back"", and Stevie shows great respect for his ""tutor"". Also, Albert shows great respect for Stevie Ray. There is no live audience. The music is fantastic!!!

The musicians are as follows:
Albert King - Electric guitar, vocals
Stevie Ray Vaughan -Elecric guitar, vocals on ""Texas Flood""/""Pride & Joy""
Tony LLoren - piano, organ
Gus Thorton - electric Bass
Michael Lloren - drums

The set list is as follows:
Introduction
""Born Under a Bad Sign"" (An Albert King Classic) this is one of the best performances of the song, I've seen on a dvd. This includes vocals by Albert.

""Texas Flood"" (a Stevie Ray Classic), this is mostly jam music, with some vocals from Stevie Ray, its great electric blues guitar play.

""Call it Stormy Monday"" (an Albert Classic) includes Albert on vocals

""Old Times"" - this is a conversation between Albert and Stevie, recalling how Stevie Ray met Albert King back in 1973 in Austin, Texas, at Austin's Coliseum Club. Stevie was just 18 years old, and he was fasinated by Albert. Also, 2 years later Stevie Ray got to sit in on a session with Albert at Antone's in Austin.

""Match Box Blues"" - (An Albert Classic) with great electric guitar blues, including vocals by Albert.

""Pep Talk"" - Albert King gives Stevie Ray some advice & encouragement.

""Don't Lie to Me"" (Another Albert Classic) with great electric guitar blues & Albert on vocals.

""Who is Stevie"" - Another conversation between Albert as ""tutor"", and Stevie Ray as ""student"".

""Pride and Joy"" (A Stevie Ray Classic) more great electric, blues guitar play, with Stevie Ray on vocals.

"" I'm Gonna Move to the Outskirts of Town"" - (Another Albert Classic), with more great electric, blues guitar play & Albert on vocals.

""Outro"" - Credits, etc.

This is certainly a great dvd to have for any blues, &/or blues rock lover. It was sad, that Stevie died in a helecopter crash in 1990, and then Albert died 2 years later in 1992. However, this dvd speaks volumes about the two legendary blues musicians.

Also, with the dvd, you get some excellent liner notes giving the details of this event and some history on both blues artists. I highly recommend this for any blues, or blues rock fan. Thanks!!!

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION NOT DIRECTLY RELATED TO MY REVIEW: This information is primarily for those who have left comments about my review.
P.S. Stevie Ray's Guitar Number 1 was a.k.a. ""First Wife"" based on page 85 of the Craig Hopkins book ""Stevie Ray Vaughan, Day By Day, Night After Night, His Early Years"". Some people believe that SRV's Number 1 Guitar picked up the nickmane ""First Wife"", based upon a joke that SRV supposively made. That was supposively based on a jokeingly statement that SRV made that ""Number 1"" was his first wife and ""Lenny"" was his second wife. However, I have not been able to establish this as a fact, based on authoritative sources, but it is very possible.

The ""official"", ""Lenny"", also a Fender Stratocaster, had been re-worked, with a new brown body, with a white plastic shield, and a solid maple neck, which is light colored wood on all sides of the neck. SRV only played this guitar, when he recorded & performed the song ""Lenny"" & ""Riviera Paradise"", both very gentle songs. SRV was always very gentle when he would play the Guitar ""officially"" named ""Lenny"" as opposed to his otherwise ""aggressive"" style of guitar playing, when he play ""Number 1"". If you'd like to see the ""original Lenny"", Stevie plays it in the dvd ""Live at the El Mocambo"", when he performs the song ""Lenny"".

My Sources: Books: ""Stevie Ray Vaughan, Day By Day, Night After Night, His Early Years, 1954 - 1982"", especially on Page 85. This book was written by SRV expert Craig Hopkins. Also, another reference book I used was the 2nd book written by Craig Hopkins ""Stevie Ray Vaughan, Day by Day, Night After Night, His Final Years"", especially on page 324. Also my other sources include the Book by Joe Nick Patoski & Bill Crawford, entited ""Steive Ray Vaughan, Caught In The Crossfire"". Another book is ""Guitar World Presents Stevie Ray Vaughan In His Own Words"", this book was based on interviews made by ""Guitar World"" directly with SRV, it was copyrighted in 1997. Plus, I've read many, many magazine articles regarding SRV's guitars.",1289692800,23,5493,4.777426160337553
4134076,3,B003KUSUE0,"Here is another stab in the heart of the real music fan where the producers assume all of us are idiots and take out the best song on this session: Blues at sunrise!!! any real blues or SRV fan will appreciate the guitar solos in blues at sunrise but again they assume it is too long and no one is interested in real good music anymore because of the web and digital and online music. so just like they cut off the solo at the end of Sultans of Swing by Dire Straits in the newer releases of those CDs they take out the best song and publish another commercial peice of rubbish and insult our love for great music.
it is time to separate music fans into 2 simple categories: the casual music fan who uses music for background or dancing or just entertainment which is perfectly fine and the real discerning music fan who needs good recordings and appreciate sophisticated music by talented artists who stand the test of time rather than one hit wonders or 2 chord songs!
There is still a market for well done music and recordings and there are still people that will buy a well made cd rather than buy music online due to the difference in quality so please indulge us!!",1289433600,5,1170,4.34703196347032
4134077,3,B003KUSUE0,This is a mixed blessing. Finally a LEGIT DVD release. Pristine picture and sound. BUT it is missing BLUES at SUNRISE and DONT ASK ME NO QUESTIONS and OVERALL JUNCTION. I know for a fact this footage exists and why it is absent I can only guess; they did not want to pay royalties for them. So killer footage but sadly INCOMPLETE. A missed opportunity for the definitive edition. Too bad.,1289260800,12,388,4.47887323943662

4134079,5,B003KUSUE0,I've had this TV show on a grainy VHS tape for years and have always wondered why it was never released on DVD. Now the wait is over. This is a great show with Albert and Stevie. Stevie is all smiles as he listens to everything Albert has to say. The great vibe comes out in both Albert and Stevie's playing. A must have for any Albert or SRV fan.

4134087,4,B003KUSUE0,"I had seen some of this before and was looking forward to seeing the entire session. It was recorded just after SRV's name was beginning to register in the public eye. I know that the Vaughan brothers held Albert King in high regard and you can see the admiration that SRV shows to King. He lets Mr. King initiate most of the dialogue and Mr. King is prescient when he tells SRV that he has barely scratched the surface of how great he will become. It's not a thrilling show, by any means. It would be enjoyed most by blues fans who enjoy seeing 2 legends together.",1441843200,2,565,4.289719626168225

4134110,5,B003KUSUE0,Well worth watching.,1406937600,,20,6.0
4134111,3,B003KUSUE0,"My only gripe is SRV plays way too many note for note Albert licks. Would have been wiser and better if SRV played any SRV licks if there is such a thing. I saw both guys many times but never together. Saw Albert tear down the Lone Star in NYC and also saw a horrible show at the Stanhope House in NJ where he was way out of tune and yelling at his band the whole time. Left half way thru and couldn't get a refund. Albert on an ""on"" night was unreal. On an ""off"" night was bad.

Saw SRV at the Stanhope House before he broke out. We really weren't sure who or what we going to see. We went to see ""Jimmie Vaughn's younger brother"".  He blew the place apart!  As all the audience was leaving, he was packing up his own stuff and got to speak with him. Shortly after had to see him in larger places like the Capital and Beacon Theater and such.

The DVD is great to see them together but could have been way better if SRV played less Albert licks.  Wonder what Albert was thinking when this kid was playing Albert licks over and over again. Oddly, at times, SRV seems to play Albert stuff better than Albert if that makes sense....... A better contrast would have been better than mirror image interchange.",1402099200,,1205,4.176724137931035

4134117,4,B003KUSUE0,"Considering the huge impact that both these blues legends have had, this is not a particularly incendiary performance. It's more interesting as a document of their meeting, and kind of self-conscious handing of the torch from Albert to SRV. In fairness, it's probably earlier in the morning than either man would like, and the sterile studio conditions don't lend themselves to a burning performance. Still, it IS Albert King and Stevie Ray Vaughan, and they both sound great!! This may be of more interest to their fans than the casual music enthusiast.",1390262400,,554,5.032608695652174

He has cried just talking about how good it is. The way SRV essentially holds back for the majority of the disc in total respect for his mentor. And the respect that is given back to SRV from the blues juggernaut. So now, after 10 years, I stumbled across the DVD version and it is going to be one of dad's Christmas presents this year.

4134146,5,B003KUSUE0,"Thoroughly enjoyed ! What a wonderful addition to my Stevie Ray Vaughn collection. Upon receipt, carefully unwrap to open, I cut the inner layer plastic by mistake. The sessions are wonderfully soulful, Stevie Ray had met Albert King previously so there is a familiarity between them. You will see how Stevie Ray ""blossoms"" into his own. They are both seated, but when it the session heats up, they begin to stand.. that is where it really gets interesting. Well worth the price..~~~!",1333929600,,484,4.914634146341464
4134147,3,B003KUSUE0,"The DVD starts with King giving advice/father's talk/lecture to SRV. From the beginning this shows the status of the 2 players: the master and the master-to-be. SRV brought 2 of his Strats and King his V, or a swallow-tail. It is thrilling at the start to see one solo after another from each player. One tone is sharper than the other, one bends the string up and the other one down. While King ...is in control of the set, like commanding for a change in key to Ab from don't know what in the middle of a song (kudos to the backup band), SRV being a new kid on the block for sure is humble and looks respectful and eager to learn.

But as the songs go by, one could not start to feel something amiss. SRV's solos seem to be running out of licks and becoming predictable. He is more at ease with his own creation but when it comes to King's piece, he lacks some kind of phrasing. The solo always starts with a bent note and excessive of it. One starts his solo dutifully after another and not much of interaction i would say. If you are looking for sparring between the 2, like what Gary and Collins did in Live at Montreux, you may be disappointed. To some extent it reminds you of Clark Quay's Crazy Elephant.

However if u r a blues fan this is still a must-have DVD, not to mention SRV's Austin and Mocambo DVDs.",1329782400,,1317,4.222222222222222

4134151,5,B003KUSUE0,"Albert King/Stevie Ray Vaughan: In Session(2010).  American blues star Albert King and Stevie Ray Vaughan, create blues jam-session magic during this historic 1983 recording. The show, which was taped live in a club in Austin, Texas on December 5, 1983, was filmed for the Canadian live music TV series ""In Session."" As both popular singer-songwriters are now, unfortunately, gone from the scene, relatively young, and this was the only time they were recorded playing together, this classic rock footage is a must-see for blues fans. The musicians play off each other beautifully: it's hard to credit that they hadn't rehearsed together for months, but, in fact, sources say that King, already an established star, was unwilling to play with Vaughan, until the older musician realized that he had already played with the native Texan before, under the moniker of ""little Stevie.""

The set includes King's signature song, penned in 1967 by Booker T. Jones, of Stax Records' Booker T. and the MG's, and William Bell.  ""Born Under a Bad Sign:"" ""if it wasn't for bad luck, I wouldn't have no luck at all.""  Needless to say, this particular song has been covered many, many times, by outstanding artists such as Cream and Eric Clapton.  The DVD also gives us T-Bone Walker's classic ""Call It Stormy Monday,"" ""Matchbox Blues,"" and Tampa Red's ""Don't Lie to Me."" We also get Vaughan's ""Texas Flood,"" and ""Pride and Joy.""  In fact, the DVD contains three hit songs not on the CD of the same concert: ""Born Under a Bad Sign,"" ""Texas Flood,"" and ""I'm Gonna Move to the Outskirts of Town,"" a hit for Louis Jordan, and Ray Charles.

King was born in Indianola, Mississippi, on April 25, 1923, as, coincidentally, was B.B. King - no relation, nor is the third blues King, Freddie King.  However, Albert did, perhaps, like to fudge things a little: he called his favorite Gibson Flying V guitar Lucy, as B.B. King calls his guitar Lucille.  At any rate, B.B. is still with us, but Albert passed of a heart attack on December 21, 1992.  His career was made when he was signed by the Memphis-based Stax, in 1967: his first album for them was, in fact, ""Born Under a Bad Sign.""  The Texas born Vaughan, who was born on October 3, 1954, was killed in a foggy-day helicopter crash on August 27, 1990.

I actually was, at one time, acquainted with Albert King: I followed him on his first trip to Great Britain. I was writing an article on it for ""Cavalier"" magazine.  King was performing in a ""Gospel and Blues"" tour: the entire group of performers stayed, I believe, at the White House Hotel, or was it the Albany?  (It was a long time ago, and memory does dim.)

The days were not particularly memorable: every day, it was into the bus by 10 A.M., then onto that night's one-night stand, where each performer did exactly the same program in two exactly the same shows.  Then it was back to the hotel and start again.  There were a couple of memorable moments though.  Initially, Albert complained to the show's producer about being paid in English pounds, which then stood at about $1.60, I believe.  Albert had, he said, worked in Canada, where he was paid one Canadian dollar for every American dollar he usually made, and why, he wanted to know, was he not being paid one English dollar for every American dollar?  And he didn't want to hear any complicated reasons why not.  So the impresario said he'd be happy to change English pounds to American dollars for Albert, and pay him in American dollars.  But he would charge for changing the money, of course.  Problem solved.  Another time, a lovely young girl actually asked for my autograph, on the grounds that I too was exiting that night's theater by the stage door, and I had, at that time, a sharp coat.  She didn't want to hear any explanations either, so, as I had to get into the bus, I signed her autograph book.  Well, we know what my signature was worth, then as now.  Albert King's should be worth much more.",1300406400,4,3959,4.650862068965517

The CD and DVD both contain the same content, aside from video, and both are outstanding, especially for being so old.

Watching Stevie playing with Albert with that sense of awe threw me back a little but then I realized, ""Hey, he's got his idols too right?""

4134157,5,B003KUSUE0,"Albert King conducts a master class for Stevie Ray Vaughan, and you are there. It's an enthralling, intimate 88-minute set with classic songs, awesome licks, and delightful banter from the celebrated master and his young pupil, who shows great respect and an eagerness to learn. Despite the high caliber of the playing, this is the opposite of a cutting session. Each man takes his turn to shine while his partner plays with perfect sympathy and utter admiration.

There is an extended jam of more than 20 minutes on both ""Texas Flood"" (with Stevie on vocals) and ""I'm Gonna Move to the Outskirts of Town"" (with Albert taking the lead). The legendary musicians recall their first meeting ten years before and the elder statesman admonishes the up-and-coming prodigy to never stop honing his craft.

I've played this DVD again and again, yet it never gets old or loses its magic. The rapport Albert and Stevie Ray has with each other and the deep feeling they had for the music were truly special.

But don't buy this version of the disc! It's now available in a more compact CD/DVD set (which may be even cheaper depending on price fluctuations). The CD contains several tracks and conversation not included in the video program, including the wonderful 15-minute jam ""Blues at Sunrise.""

4134159,5,B003KUSUE0,"This long awaited and overdue gem is just fantastic. This set filmed in Ontario, Canada in 1983 has been a Holy Grail of King and SRV fans for years and years. It was filmed for a regional audience (like Austin City Limits) and we are so lucky to have it. I have had a Japanese version from the VHS tape for a long time and it is the show as taped off the air- but it does also have King at Montreux in 1973 which is also rare. The picture and sound are both ok.

Well regarding the show and the controversial ""set list"", the first two songs are almost a half hour long, that should say everything. The band is Albert's San Francisco based Fantasy Records outfit which he used and toured with during this time, the Llorens' brothers and Gus Thornton. Albert also toured Europe about this time with Little Milton's dancing horn players and the great Johnnie Johnson on keyboards, and Gus Thornton was also with him too, that show is also great.

The sound quality on this DVD is very good. The performances last for an hour and 27 minutes and it's straight music, no shots of the control room dancing as in the show. This is no nonsense Blues music which you will enjoy. To me the only drawback is that this happened during the time of King's phaser pedal period (about mid 1970s until the mid 1980s- a good example is the LP ""New Orleans Heat""). This does impact on the sound but his style is still the same. He also goes out of tune a bit in the second half especially in ""Don't Lie To Me"" and ""Pride and Joy"" but that's ok, we love anything we can get on Albert, read my reviews since 2003. I am saying this because in the other DVDs available, with poorer sound, you really can't hear it that much, this remastering is great and so is the CD (I bought BOTH the regular and deluxe editions- what a bargain!). The picture quality is amazing, to me anyway. Parts of the session look like they're filmed in HD. So how can you go wrong, complete tunes (not as in the original show), better sound and clear (for its age) picture. It also contains all the chat between these two men, more than  on the CD. My favorite is Albert (the thumb player) asking Stevie to ""teach me how to use a pick"", that is priceless.

 This is the release of the decade for Albert King fans. What next, his Fillmore concerts, Japan Blues Festivals TV which was filmed, the Ann Arbor Blues Festival in about 1968, the Europe tour in Germany, his performance with the Memphis Symphony Orchestra (""Personal Manager"") and likewise in Japan of the same tune, I am sure there is more out there. The rare ""Final Concert"" in Baden-Baden once available through Japan of Albert six months before he died is filmed in HD and shows a frail old 69 year old playing his final Pink Lucy (now at the Stax Museum in Memphis).

I had the pleasure, as a life long fan of Albert, to travel to Memphis in April this year. I drove across to Arkansas and visited Albert's grave site. It was lonely, Albert is buried slightly away from the rest at the northeast corner of the cemetary. I remembered meeting him twice, once in New York as a boy and in 1990 when he came to Australia, I remember him as a kind, interesting person who smiled a lot. This is the man I see in this DVD. Albert's grave was lonely, some of the bricks on its border were broken and had turned over. It was quite sad. Perhaps this is the DVD to get Albert King and SRV some of the recognition they, and the most American of all music, the Blues, deserves.",1290556800,37,3480,4.305343511450381

It will make you miss the days when musicians didn't rely on spectacle, lighting or staging. There's none of that, just two talented guys jamming and having fun. Imagine Albert King saying to SRV, ""You're gonna have to teach me that lick.""
My one criticism is that it's a lot of the same style. I could almost believe it was one song an hour long.
