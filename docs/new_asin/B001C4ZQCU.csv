3505803,5,B001C4ZQCU,I haven't seen it restored yet but I remember it when it was on Cartoonnetwork. This is by far the best season of the Dragon Ball Series. Frieza was good Buu was okay but Cell in my opinion is the ultimate villain. The fight scene are the best in the entire series and it has a story that blows out all the rest.,1219017600,,312,3.9682539682539684
3505804,1,B001C4ZQCU,"Believe it or not, there are some people who have not seen this yet. If you're one of them, don't read any other reviews. I gave it a one-star, only to get the attention of the those who've not seen this yet.",1218326400,22,208,3.9761904761904763
3505805,5,B001C4ZQCU,"Is anyone else as pissed as I am that a picture of Son Goku (from the Frieza Saga no less) is on the box cover instead of SSJ2 Son Gohan?  Son Gohan is the true hero of this saga (though Son Goku does play his part as always) and should of been given the honor of adorning this box set with his likeness.  The Cell Games Saga is my favorite of the series so I'm definitely gonna get this box set, but it still woulda been nice to have a fully pumped up SSJ2 Son Gohan on the cover.",1217721600,6,481,3.8484848484848486
3505806,5,B001C4ZQCU,"When it comes to Dragon Ball Z the first season that comes to mind is probably the Namek/Frieza saga since it basically is the main plot of Dragon Ball, however when it comes to action most fans would have to agree the BEST saga was the Cell Saga.  The episodes contained in Season Five and Season Six.  From the arrival of Cell to the final Kamehameha blow in the Cell games.

For any DBZ fan, this season and the previous seasons are MUST BUYS.",1217635200,,446,4.285714285714286
3505807,5,B001C4ZQCU,I have been waiting a few months for this season to come out I started about five months ago collecting the series and it brings back alot of memories dragon ball z is the best of the series of all dragon ball it is also the most popular of all the series this season is one of my favorites if you never watch any of the series don't start with this one go back purchase all the other ones first then come bak to this one and you will agree with me that this one is one of the best of the series,1216857600,,495,3.8155339805825244
3505808,5,B001C4ZQCU,"Finally! The season we've all been waiting for. The Cell Games are about to begin and Gohan is about to kick Cell's high and mighty butt! Memories will be shared, boundaries will be breached,...and a much-loved hero will destroy King Kai's planet in order to save the Earth. :) I can't wait until September!!!!

If you're new to DBZ, I highly suggest you pick it up! It was first aired back in 1989, and is still considered one of the most amazing and best anime series out there. Each season is literally better than the last, but, as a whole, DBZ is the most unforgettable anime to date. The story line is awesome, the characters are unforgettable, and the fighting sequences are to die for!!!

I've been in love with the whole DBZ series since I was 10 years old. The first episodes I ever saw were of the fight between Goku and Captain Ginyu. I couldn't believe it when they said they were releasing the seasons in box sets and have been in anticipation for the following set ever since I bought Season 1 and Season 6 is NOT the exception. I can't wait to see Gohan go SS2 in Hi-Def, remastered and uncut! The seasons only get better from here!

If anything, give it a try. I guarantee you'll never see another anime like it. Well with the exception of Dragon Ball (the prequel to DBZ...but it doesn't have to be seen to understand DBZ) and Dragon Ball GT (the sequel to DBZ. It's a good continuation of the characters' lives... but nowhere near as good as DBZ).

Trust me: DBZ is a classic must-see anime! Mandatory to anyone who likes/loves/is remotely interested in anime!",1215907200,4,1579,4.491289198606272
3505809,5,B001C4ZQCU,"this is by far my favorite saga of dragon ball z.
the emotional piece. gohan gets revenge. one handed kamehameha with the spirit of goku for a topping. LOL!
yeah! a long wait is coming to a close.
3 more seasons to come then my collection is complete.
i already preordered it yesterday.
can't wait to get it.",1215734400,6,308,4.327586206896552

3505815,5,B001C4ZQCU,"One of the best sagas in Dragon Ball Z, especially if you like Gohan.

That's a major thing to me I'm sorry it doesn't give me the same feeling when watching like when I was a kid. That music is what gives the suspense.,1478044800,,251,4.456521739130435

3505865,4,B001C4ZQCU,"I was actually hoping for Dragon Ball Z Kai which I started watching on Vortexx. I liked that slimmed-down, somewhat ""Americanized"" version, but I couldn't find it at Amazon so I got the 6th season of Dragon Ball Z. The picture quality is much better than what I was seeing on TV, but there are things to the original I have something of a hard time with-- particularly seeing Goku and Gohan with tails, and seeing them at the start of where the commercial breaks would be. The ending is not the same as in Dragon Ball Z Kai, and I don't like the Japanese singing. This is very good quality animation, but for a fan of Z Kai, it can be a bit disturbing. Still, I have most of the whole Cell saga, even with some episodes and things not shown in Z Kai. So I got my money's worth, and I am happy-- mostly, anyway.",1475971200,,811,4.171974522292993

3505898,3,B001C4ZQCU,"Overall, this is a great release. I'm not gonna go into the cropping controversy or anything. The picture quality is great.
What I will mention is how they altered the music for the American Broadcast score. For anyone who's a fan of the Bruce Faulconer score, you'll be disappointed to know they rescored several parts throughout this release for some reason. Most notably Episode 192 ""Goku's Decision"", one of the most emotional episodes of DBZ, was almost entirely rescored. Where comedic music used to play now plays mysterious, villainous music. Where sad, hopeful, emotional music used to play now has serious flashback music overlayed. It's truly awful.
At the very least, all the dead air moments where no music played at all in the Orange Brick release have been fixed.
So it's a mixed bag. If you're a fan of the Faulconer score, no perfect Season 6 release exists, save for buying the old DVDs.",1463788800,2,905,4.84516129032258

3505907,5,B001C4ZQCU,I bought these dvds to soley rewatch the cell saga. I find it to be the climax of the the whole show. Dont get me wrong i love the buu and freiza saga.  I just find that this is the moment when gohan changes and surpasses his father. The show is really centered on gohan and how he grows up and this is thhe shining moment of him im dbz.,1459296000,,337,3.8142857142857145
3505908,5,B001C4ZQCU,"Reading up on forums and online reviews, purists complain that the aspect ratio was changed cutting out minor details, or that color remastering is the devil, but honestly I like how it was all packaged, and that I had the option to pick between Japanese or American music arrangements.

Also has a marathon mode, so you can just plow through every episode on a disk.

If you loved the show growing up, and can afford to invest in this full set, go ahead and do it.  Pick your favorite season to try it out, and you'll probably buy all the rest. That's what I did.",1459123200,,564,4.352380952380952

I felt the background music always added intensity and drama to some scenes. But they brutalized the music of this whole series. its either silence or some variation of the same track and its terrible. I am very disappointed at the rerelease because of this.,1426464000,,382,4.632352941176471

3506002,4,B001C4ZQCU,"This is one of my favorite seasons in the whole series because of the character development of Gohan. This is where he starts to realize that he needs to be brave(r) enable to save his friends from death. I also like how there are almost as many super saiyans as there are non super saiyans. One thing I don't like is the way Goku dies. Even though it was heroic, it was too sudden. I felt like when Gohan was in his super saiyan 2 form, he should of finished off Cell right then and there, but he got naive and wanted Cell to suffer first before he killed him. When this happened, Cell became desperate and started to try and blow himself and the earth up, which caused Goku to get the idea to transport Cell and him off the earth enable to save it from blowing up and killing everyone. When Goku did this, King Kai, Bubbles, Gregory, and Goku obviously die in the explosion, but Cell regenerates himself and goes back to earth even stronger than he was before. This turns out to be the biggest undoing of Gohan's young life.",1423958400,,1026,4.293814432989691

I was so bummed out!

But that doesn't take away from the great show it is, with Season 6 being one of my favorites.

 English Dolby True HD 2.0

This particular set has the Cell Games episodes

Season 1, 2, 3 : Saiyan and Frieza Saga
Season 4, 5, 6 : Android and Cell Saga
Season 7, 8, 9 : Buu Saga

Fun Fact: Season 1, 2, 3 make a picture when placed together horizontally and so do 4, 5, 6. Hopefully 7, 8, 9 will make a similar kind of picture and if we put them all together we might get a big picture ( though when we put seasons 4, 5, 6 below 1, 2, 3 we don't get a connective picture)

Fun fact 2: Funimation is releasing 1 season per month so we might have all 9 seasons by November",1403568000,10,917,4.176136363636363

And the special features are decent also. I have been waiting for this season to come out for a long time and its not to far off. Ill quote Tom from TOONAMI ""The saga that changed it all"" 100% correct he is.  Dont listen to the nay sayers about this whole widescreen crap.  They are just mad they lost on an OPEN survey on Funimations website.  Goes to show that no one gives a s*** about the original 4:3, maybe if it was 1998 on a 20' tube tv.

I Give This Series 5/5. The 2nd Best Season of All Time.",1381276800,,1229,4.902912621359223
3506171,5,B001C4ZQCU,It was great to see these episodes. I really enjoyed Dragonball a lot more when I was younger and I missed this season so I never knew what happened. It was great to finally get the details.,1379980800,,190,4.162162162162162
3506172,5,B001C4ZQCU,"Season six the end of the perfect cell android saga. This is must buy for any adult anime watcher/collector.

This is the UN-CUT/ Unrated version of the anime. if your looking to buy this for your kid don't. search dragonball z KAI those are the kid friendly versions of the series. but if your and adult anime collector this is the series for you.",1378857600,,348,4.4375
3506173,5,B001C4ZQCU,"Dragon Ball Z Season Six has everything in this season: the action-packed fights, the suspense, the characters that we love/hate, comedy, tragedy, all into one season!!!! For DBZ lovers, I highly recommend watching this season. You won't be disappointed.",1378598400,,254,5.538461538461538
3506174,4,B001C4ZQCU,It's always fun to watch Cell get thumped over and over. It's the most enjoyable part of the set.  I'm watching it now.,1378425600,,119,4.173913043478261
3506179,5,B001C4ZQCU,"I absolutely love this season. I like that it comes with the original japense version as well as two different dubbed versions (one of them being the one I grew up with, yay!). Love this DVD!",1377993600,,191,4.333333333333333
3506180,5,B001C4ZQCU,"I grew up watching the Funimation dub of Dragon Ball Z on Toonami. I was obsessed with this show as a kid because of the action, interesting characters, and the story arcs. Until the 'Orange Bricks', owning episodes of DBZ would cost a pretty penny. Now, a fan searching for some nostalgia (such as myself) can easily afford the entire series. That said, these season packs are not for the 'hardcore' DBZ fans as they would find the lack of the full picture disturbing. See, Dragon Ball Z originally aired back in the 90's on 'box' TVs. In order for the wide screen affect, Funimation cropped the top and bottom of the screen and zoomed in. This means lesser quality and missing artwork. It's not noticeable most of the time, but if it's something that would bother you, look elsewhere and pay upwards of $500.

The value of these DVD seasons is incredible. Most seasons cost around $18 here on Amazon and contain about 30 episodes each, spanning 9 season in total. The sets come with 6 DVDs with special features and the ability to choose the audio of the original Japanese dub or the Funimation dub. It's worth noting that the background music can be set to the Japanese version while listening to the Funimation dub. You also have the option of subtitles. Lastly, this is the uncut version of the series that was never shown on TV so if you are against blood and gore and brief nudity, you might want to avoid.

Season Six is about the Cell Games where Cell challenges the Z Warriors in a televised tournament to test his strength. It's cheesy, fun, well-done, and honestly everything you can remember about one of the most popular anime shows ever. I enjoyed it and can't wait to see Goku and company take on Buu in the following seasons.",1377820800,2,1742,4.562300319488818

3506210,5,B001C4ZQCU,This is personally my favorite season. Gohan walking through the father-son kamehameha with that epic music in the background while Cell gets obliterated is just absolutely riveting. I would recommend this to any dbz fan.,1355616000,,221,5.3428571428571425
3506211,5,B001C4ZQCU,"The dragon ball series is One of the best seriesin anime, unlike most of the new ones which arnt too good.",1355270400,,106,4.095238095238095
3506212,5,B001C4ZQCU,"I love the Dragon Ball series. One day I hope to have the entire collection, Ball, Z, and GT. Shipping was great, product looks great.",1354492800,,134,4.4
3506213,5,B001C4ZQCU,great product and great quality. the only drawback is the episode guide for season 6 was missing from the box,1353974400,,109,4.5
3506214,5,B001C4ZQCU,My favorite DBZ saga. Ever. The only thing that got annoying with this series are the several second long shorts that play half way through each episode.,1353715200,,153,4.703703703703703
3506215,5,B001C4ZQCU,This set contains all 29 episodes of the Cell Games saga on 6 discs. This is one of the greatest battles in th eDBZ series. Every DBZ fan needs this collection. My favorite feature of this box set is the marathon feature option. This allows you to watch all the episodes on each disc w/o any previews or opening/closing songs. It makes everything flow so much smoother. The video and audio quality is also very good in this collection. It is presented in 5.1 dolby digital. The dialogue has also been revised. It's a great addition to any DBZ fans collection.,1351123200,3,559,4.544554455445544
3506216,5,B001C4ZQCU,"I love DragonBall Z since I was little. To have this collection in my procession is amazing to me because for a long time I couldn't find the shows for DBZ. Now that technology has changed since the 90s, a lot of remakes are being made. This version is from the original Japanese intro and outros. I grew up on the 90s version of the intro and outros(definitely not the same and the 90s version was in English) so for this one I was a bit surprised but the picture is clear as it can be. Also, it is NOT like the Toonami version that the US was given. It is the original Japanese version of the show. The shows are in English, clear, precise, no commercials, just a small 10 second cut away, in each episode. I can sit an watched these all day because as you know back on TV the commercials was so annoying so to have no commercials and you transition well between shows, it is a TREAT. Go get your popcorn, and relax cause you will be officially apart of the show.
Its a WONDERFUL collection. I just love it. If you are a DBZ fan, you must get it!!!!!",1332633600,,1052,4.136585365853659

After two days they were in my mailbox on standard delivery and when i opened and looked at the dvds they were in perfect condition.  They are a MUST BUY!!!!!!,1288137600,,256,4.204081632653061
3506237,5,B001C4ZQCU,"This was the best season of Dragon Ball Z. Cell won the ""best villain"" vote from me.",1287532800,,84,4.0
3506248,3,B001C4ZQCU,"The Dragon Ball Z Season Six DVD box set includes six DVDs that contain twenty-nine episodes.  The first three discs contain six episodes, the fourth disc contains five episodes, the fifth disc contains three episodes, and the sixth disc contains three episodes and the DVD extras.  The focus of the episodes on this set is the Cell Games saga.

One of the best features of the Dragon Ball Z sets is the marathon feature; this allows you to watch all of the episodes back-to-back.  However, with the marathon feature, you only see the opening credits once, and the ending credits are not shown.  This feature is very helpful when you're trying to watch all of the episodes on a disc in a single sitting.

The menu on the sixth DVD adds in a link for the special features.  However, the features aren't very special.  All you get are the textless versions of the opening and ending credits (which is a feature that was included on the previous five DVD box sets), and trailers.  The trailers included on this set are for One Piece, xxxHOLIC, Hana, Case Closed, Jyu-Oh-Sei, Love and Honor, Vexille, and Dragon Ball Z.

I also have issues with the audio mastering levels on this set.  FUNimation's splash screen at the beginning of the discs, the trailer at the start of the disc, and the menu are mastered at a high audio level.  However, the actual episodes themselves were mastered at a very soft audio level.  And on this set, a couple of the episodes were mastered even lower than usual, so the sound was rather muddy and very hard to hear.

While I was disappointed with the audio levels and the lack of special features, this set is still a ""must get"" for any Dragon Ball Z fan that wants all the episodes on DVD.

In order to write this review, I checked out a copy of this DVD box set through the King County Library System.",1282003200,2,1830,4.503030303030303
3506249,5,B001C4ZQCU,"This is exactly what i wanted it comes with the u.s. broadcast versions from when i was a kid but also comes with the original Japanese audio which is great from people who really want to see what the characters are saying.

Overall Very Satisfied.",1281225600,,248,4.511111111111111
3506250,4,B001C4ZQCU,"If you've read a single review about any of the box sets so far in this series, then you already know the lowdown. There's no point in repeating the same things over and over, so I'll focus on what's new, the story.

This box set contains one saga, the Cell Games. This makes this set easily the shortest thus far as the Cell Games are shorter then the battle with Freiza or the Fusion Saga, as such it's a rather paltry set in the series. Still it represents a major story arc in the series and has irrevocable changes for all the characters involved.

Cell, now in his perfect form, announces that he's going to hold his own tournament along the lines of the old World Martial Arts tournaments that the series used to be based around. The tournament is to take place in nine days and yes, there are nine filler episodes to choke down before the action starts. Strange how not long ago we traversed three years in only three episodes but now it takes nine episodes to travel nine days.

In honesty not all the filler build up is bad. While the episodes revolving around Mercenary Tao (yeah, he's still around) are rather dull, the episode about Gohan's birthday is actually a very charming little episode to add. Also these filler episodes introduce the rather irritating Mr. Satan. The idea is that the World Martial Arts Tournaments did eventually resume after the epic finale between Piccolo and Goku years ago, and that the new champion was a man named Mister Satan. With no Z-Fighters participating in recent tournaments, Satan is naturally much weaker then the superhuman characters fans have become used to, but he's completely unaware of it. As such the character treads a rather thin line between comical support and flat out annoying. It does feel rather refreshing to be reminded just how powerful the Z-Fighters are and to have someone around that makes everyone else, even the irrelevant fighters like Tien and Yamcha, still seem strong. On the downside, Mister Satan gets a lot of screen time and his ignorance can be very irritating. Having watched these episodes when they original aired in the US back when I was in High School, I can tell you everybody hated Satan and the time he took up. When you've got to wait a whole week for a new episode, you don't want to finally see one just to have to watch a guy that has no importance whatsoever to the story punch holes in busses and break bricks.

When the tournament finally begins, it's a really slow start. Mister Satan and his students get an entire episode to themselves as they all predict easy success and all fail miserably. After wasting so much time, we finally get to see the real fight begin as Goku steps up to challenge Cell. The fight that ensues is actually pretty good. The Super Saiyan and the Android exchange blows and special moves at an impressive rate. However it should be noted how Cell relies so heavily on borrowed techniques. He uses everything from Tien's multiform to Piccolo's Special Beam Cannon and even Freiza's energy disks. Goku surprises Cell by utilizing his Instant Transmission with a full power Kamehameha which incinerates the upper portion of Cell's body, including his head. At this point even the Namekian regeneration shouldn't save him and the fight should be over, but once again Cell manages to regenerate anyways, and manages to outlast Goku.

With nobody seemingly as powerful as Goku to step up and face Cell, it all falls to Gohan. While the fight between Gohan and Cell has a very promising start, it quickly gets dull. Gohan flat out refuses to fight back because he's afraid of losing control and he suddenly decides he hates fighting. So Cell spends a couple of episodes trying to force Gohan to lose his temper. When beating the tar out of the young Super Saiyan doesn't work, Cell steals the sensu beans and creates seven miniature clones of himself that go on a rampage attacking the rest of the Z-Fighters. The Cell Juniors prove too powerful for the Z-fighters, but Gohan still refuses to fight. Finally, Mister Satan fulfills his one and only purpose in this entire story arc by tossing the decapitated head of Android 16 towards Gohan. After a speech from the fellow pacifist, who is promptly silenced by Cell, Gohan finally gives in and lets his rage consume him. Gohan then transforms into a super saiyan to the second power, and dominates Cell.

After killing all the Cell Jrs and a quick one-sided battle with Cell, Gohan's arrogance (when he developed an ego, I'm not sure) gets the better of him. He hits Cell so hard that he spits out android 18 and reverts to his second form. In desperation Cell activates his self destruct to destroy the entire planet. Goku decides to use his instant transmission to save the planet from the explosion and sacrifices himself. However, by achieving new levels of cheapness, Cell regenerates even from self destructing. He returns in his perfect form, even without android 18, and because of his Saiyan Cells he gains an instant power boost. Cell returns to the battle, promptly kills Trunks (conveniently, the only character left who hasn't died before besides Gohan) and thumps and enraged Vegeta. At this point it would appear that the saiyan prince has officially degenerated into nothing more then a rapid fire laser gun, as all he does is pummel Cell with weak energy blasts. Gohan takes a blast for Vegeta to save his life but is hurt in the process. The finale of the battle is a dramatic beam struggle between Cell's Kamehameha and Gohan's Kamehameha. Each of the Z-Fighters attacks Cell from behind to distract him but it all fails until Vegeta steps in himself. Finally with Cell distracted, Gohan turns up the juice and ends the fight.

With Cell completely disintegrated, the last few episodes wrap up the story arc nicely. Trunks is wished back to life, but Goku choses to remain dead as both Freiza, the androids, and even the saiyans only threatened Earth to get at him. As such Goku deems it safer for the planet if he stays dead this time. Finally Trunks returns to the future where he defeats both androids and Cell, finally winning peace for his own world.

This story arc is probably better though of as the climax of the previous two sagas in one fight. While Tien, Yamcha, Krillin, Piccolo, Vegeta, Trunks, and Android 16 all show up to fight Cell at the games, only Gohan and Goku actually get turns. While I don't think Cell is nearly as impressive as a villain as Piccolo, Vegeta, or Frieza had been , the final battle is still very epic. With all that takes place, this saga finally concludes a lot of loose ends that have been hanging around since the series began. And the fight between Goku and Cell alone is pretty well worth the price of the set.",1272931200,,6751,4.6767676767676765

If They couldn't get the copyrights to the Original songs Why didn't they put on their DVD Sets Original Japanese artists songs were not added. This was A real disappointment When Cell Crushed android 16s Head and Gohan powered up this scene seemed really strange with song at all. Maybe Funimation were too Cheap to give royalties to these artists Unlike ADV. I know Saint Seiya wasn't complete but the episodes contained the original artists in stereo.

3506256,5,B001C4ZQCU,"I've been a diehard 'DragonBall Z"", ""DragonBall GT"", and ""DragonBall"" fan ever since I was six years old and I love this DVD boxset! Continuing from where the Imperfect Cell and Perfect Cell Sagas (Season Five) left off, the good guys fight against Perfect Cell (after the first few episodes, where Cell is training and the good guys are training and relaxing) in his Cell Games Tournament and, at the very end of the saga, they eventually kill him and they kill his form in the alternate timeline that Trunks has, too. There's also a new ""good guy"", Hercule/Mr. Satan, the annoying, obnoxious, yet comic relief character, who watches the Cell Games Tournament and says that the Z-Fighters/good guys' energy attacks and flying ability are ""smoke and mirrors"". You get all of the episodes from Season Six (The entire Cell Games saga), such as the eleven or so episodes when the characters are all training or relaxing and Cell is training, and the ones where the good guys are fighting against Cell in his Cell Games Tournament, to the ones where Gohan kills Cell and then Trunks goes to his alternate timeline and kills Imperfect Cell from that timeline. The only things that I miss from this boxset are that there's no scene selection feature and that the American music Bruce Faulconer made isn't there, but the show is still amazing! I love this boxset and I can't wait to get this and the rest of the ""DragonBall Z"", ""DragonBall GT"", and ""DragonBall"" boxsets that I don't have yet!",1247616000,,1485,4.737451737451737
3506257,5,B001C4ZQCU,"Pretty good buy.. good quality, intense action, and comedy. Well what else do you expect out of the best Anime action cartoon every created? in my opinion, this box set covers the beginning of the Cell games and the end of the cell saga. And of course this being one of my favorite sagas of DBZ because of the action and the story behind.. overall a good dvd set for any DBZ fan!! i loved it... the battle between SS2 Gohan and Cell was just pure Epic!!",1243036800,,453,4.218390804597701
3506258,4,B001C4ZQCU,"I've been a hardcore Dragon Ball Z fan since I first discovered the show in middle school, especially when the spotlight has been on Gohan. To me, he's the easiest character to relate to and I've always admired him for it. He not only copes with major self doubts, but learns to overcome them as his father helps him to believe in himself as his epic battle against Cell takes place.

I've watched this part of the series at least two dozen times and still get goose bumps with the way it ends. I can't think of a more inspirational cartoon moment than when a banged up Gohan manages to take down the super-freakishly powerful Cell through the help of his friends and father. If you haven't yet seen it, then I highly recommend that you see how this magnificent story goes down.

Cell is also my favorite DBZ villain as well. Not only is he the most tricky villain to defeat, but he's the only one who ever successfully managed to kill Goku. He seemed like an indestructible superhero to me before that and it takes quite the bad guy to defeat him.

So with all these flowery words I've said about this box set, do you wonder why I only give it FOUR stars? Well there's two reasons for it. Not only am I still annoyed with the widescreen format that they put this into, but HOW COULD YOU PUT GOKU ON THE COVER INSTEAD OF GOHAN!?! THIS IS HIS TIME TO SHINE IN THE SERIES, PLUS GOKU IS ALREADY ON THE SEASON 2 COVER!! (Sigh)

3506263,5,B001C4ZQCU,"I have to say that the fight between Gohan and Cell rocked big time! It was more intense and dramatic than the entire fight with Frieza which had about 30 episodes of fighting and the Gohan vs Cell fight only had 11 episodes.
It was like you were right there at the Cell Games. You would feel what the characters were feeling. One difference between this battle and the other ones with involving Freiza and Majin Buu, this battle isn't an epic battle but one thing is has is the ability the convey emotion and feelings which the viewer will feel.
I also found out that Cell has appeared in less episodes (while alive) than Frieza and the many forms of Majin Buu.

Frieza: 58 episodes (Seasons 2,3 & 4 plus TV Special 'Bardock The Father Of Goku)
Majin Buu,Super Buu & Kid Buu: 55 episodes (Seasons 8 & 9)
Cell: 52 episodes (Seasons 5 & 6)
Of course Cell is over 100 times more powerful than Frieza and not yet quite as powerful than Majin Buu.

I don't know the real reason for having Goku on the front cover but if I had to choose it would be SS2 Gohan because he was the one who defeated Cell. Even though Goku did save the planet from the self destructing Cell.
Have you noticed that Goku and Vegeta (the only 2 pure blooded Saiyans alive) have died only twice throughout the entire series and they have died about 5 seasons apart and Goku is usually dead for a long period of time and Vegeta is dead for a short period of time.
Vegeta changes alot during the fight. He says sorry to Gohan for being useless on the battle field and when Cell kills Trunks he goes into a moment of reflection and then flies into a rage and attacks Cell head on.
I love the battle between the Z fighters and the Cell Juniors. It was an all out war! I liked it when Gohan hunted down the seven Cell Juniors and picked them off one by one.

I like the 10 filler episodes before the fight and it is good to see an old enemy like General Tao come back. I love the end of the fight where Cell & Gohan use their powers to form a big Kamehameha ball and the Z fighters still help even if their efforts are for nothing. They still try anyway. Goku giving some helpful encouragement and advice still added the suspense it needed. This is truly a great work of art!",1233878400,,2239,4.202325581395349

I am hardly ever wrong about anything but this time it looks like i messed up. ya see i told you guys that the picture wasn't cropped becasue alot of people were crying about the widescreen thing. well at the time i only had an old GE tv. a few days ago a bought a Vizeo flatscreent tv 26 inch and weeeeeell ya the picture is cropped BUT that still shouldn't be a problem ok so lets get on on the rest of the review

story. ya it goes trhough the entire cell games and some filler episodes it starts off after cell beat the hell ouf of trunks and it ends when Goku is like ""hey King Kai lets like go on a roadtrip or whatever"" so ya you get the whole thing and sume filler eposides as well.

I am still not liking the whole changed dialog thing i mean it's totaly ridiculus how they change some of the characters dialoge

the fight scenes are pretty good well to tell the truth the only cools fight scenes is when Gohan fights cell casue i mean when i saw Goku fight him I'm like ""the hell man why don't you get really ruff and tuff like you did with Frieza"" I man it looked like he was pulling his punches man.

the one thing that is super cools about this is that it ""along with all the over seesions"" is in HD. now i just realized that when i played it throught my new HD tv and i was like woh this picture is super clear so go out and buy this if your a hard core DBZ fan as for me i'm getting pumped up for the release of Dragon Ball GT",1227916800,,1522,3.9

But since Amazon replaced them for no charge I'm glad to be their customer.

The set itself is great. There is one scene in the 5.1 track that is quite a let down, apparently Toei didn't allow Funimation to use ""Spirit vs. Spirit"" song while Gohan goes SSJ2 with the English voices, no clue why, instead it is replaced with random cymbal crashes O_o; Well Stephanie's voice is cool so it's alright ^_^ (you can find the version with Spirit vs Spirit edited in on youtube)",1225584000,,698,4.496062992125984

The rest of the season starts out somewhat slowly but by the last 8 episodes or so you won't be able to stop watching. My only issue was with DBZ's usual tactic of stretching out exciting episodes with annoying segues into certain minor and completely oblivious characters, who are funny at first but just give you a headache after a while.

Without revealing too many spoilers in regards to this season, not only is it full of action, the series had a great build up of how evil Cell was, his goal to achieve his complete stage but also to showcase the additional characters much stronger than before and trying to take Cell down.

Whereas the Friezer battles were long but I felt a bit drawn out for the sake of having many episodes, with the ""Cell"" storyline, I just felt that everything came together quite well and didn't take forever to get towards the conclusion.

I really enjoyed the camaraderie of Goku and his friends and most of all to see Vegita and his acknowledgment that he has things about himself that he really needs to work on.

And you also get the introduction of Mr. Satan, world's greatest champion which will be interesting on how he and his family become important to the series probably in the next upcoming season.  So, definitely stay tuned for that!

But overall, this is another wonderful box set for an awesome animated TV series.  Definitely for those who love action and can't get enough of it.

As for my problems with the last season box set which disc 4-6 only featured three episodes, season 6 fortunately features a full disc 4 but season 5 and 6 has only three episodes each.  But I kind of understand as they transition to the next season which will take place several years into the future and these DVD box sets are created to have six discs and not five.

And again, for $29.99, for all these episodes, about the same price or less than buying an American television series box set and Funimation has definitely set the standard which I hope many of the anime industry will follow.  You get the bang for your buck for these season box sets!

VIDEO:

The video looks great on DVD and for those of us who have multi-generation fansubs or fading VHS tapes, just having these episodes on DVD and everything looking great. I know some people have a problem with the show receiving some cropping but for me it's quite miniscule.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

Special features include trailers and open and ending themes. If there was one thing lacking, it's the fact that there are really nothing in terms of special features.

Season 6 was another action-packed season that I could have probably watched in a full sitting.  I found myself really attached to each episode and not wanting to stop because there was so much action and this time around, each character has its importance.  From Kirilin having feelings for Android 18, Android 16 showing his love for nature and wanting to help the team, Goku showing his newfound power but noticing that his son has an even impressive power, Vegita and Trunks together trying to develop their relationship as father and son which never happened in the future Trunks lived in.  And so much more!

This was among my favorite seasons of ""Dragon Ball Z"" when I first watched it air in Japan but knowing what's coming soon next season with the Super Saiyaman series and especially the Buu series and more characters and development, I can't help but be excited with what is coming next from Funimation.

Again, more bang for your buck with these box sets and for ""Dragon Ball Z"" fans, you don't want to miss any of them.  Check it out!",1224460800,,3477,4.590614886731392

This DVD box set covers the climax of the Android/Cell sagas and the last episodes before the ""skip"" to the Majin Buu saga.  The remastered video quality is good, the Japanese audio is mono but sounds fine, however the opening song audio is kind of weak.  Also the DVD does not include the teasers at the end of each episode, perhaps to save time, but I would rather see them.

It begins, of course, right after the trunks, imperfect and perfect cell saga's, which have built up to the cell games saga.

Honestly, my advice is get the season, if you are a die-hard fan or a beginner in the series. You will appreciate the original Japanese colors, intro/outro's, and the 'marathon' feature which allows you to watch all of the episodes without interruption.

I've been buying the new DBZ seasons on DVD since the first ones became available. The picture quality is simply amazing, especially after viewing VHS versions. Funimation is digitally renewing the quality of the entire series, one season at a time, and they're doing an excellent job. Another notable feature is the 3 different audio options available, Japanese dialogue with Japanese music, English dialogue with Japanese music, and English dialogue with the US broadcast music. Earlier VHS tapes only let you watch with English dialogue and Japanese music. I like watching DBZ with the US broadcast music, which is available on these DVDs. Also another cool feature, marathon play. This play option plays the title theme once at the beginning, and from then on cuts the title theme, recap, and ending credits out from between episodes, shortening view time and ending the ever irritating task of skipping forward with the remote. All these features, along with a shiney box and informative insert, make the $30 paid for the season more than worth it.

The climax of episode 184 is unforgettable.",1220918400,4,505,4.8604651162790695

3506296,5,B001C4ZQCU,"Some people are wondering why Goku is utilized on the cover and not Gohan.  Well, you could say because it is a spoiler for those who have yet to see this season of DBZ.  And sure, there are a few of them.  Showing the art of the SSJ2 Gohan would have been the best move though, since it is so intense and awesome to see the little kid in pure kick*** form.  You could even show the frame on the cover where the bird is flying through the eyes of Gohan as he realizes what is happening after Cell squishes #18's head just for the heck of it.  That is a pretty powerful piece of art if you ask me.

But it is Goku who makes Gohan SSJ in the first place.  Who discovers that both Gohan and himself need to learn to live life in SSJ form to conserve the necessary energy to even make the bigger jump needed for SSJ2.  Etc. Etc.  Gohan is the hero indeed, but Goku once again is the key to the hero having the ability to become the hero.",1219536000,,933,3.9731182795698925
3506297,5,B001C4ZQCU,"season 6! about darn time! everyone on the anime watching planet wants this right now! the best anime to date. however, has anyone else noticed how funimation is boinking us (lol)! I mean these box sets are a catch 22 of sorts don't you think. look back to the first single dvd boxes. see the difference. yes with these you get the better voice overs and all the remastered stuff but where are the special features! when you put out a ""better"" virson"" of somthing the entire somthing had best be 2x as good because after all we are paying an arm and a leg for it even after we paid an arm and a leg for the last virson. WTF funimation! GET WITH THE PORGRAM and fast!",1219536000,,666,4.2109375

8286047,1,B001C4ZQCU,"Why are the customer reviews for DVD/Blu-Ray landing in with the streaming product? Bought the whole season 4, 5 and 6, thinking there will be both audio tracks (after the US/faulconer version). But no, the streaming one only has the Jap version.

Quite disappointed, especially since I cannot return the season 4 and 6, as I had checked episodes for tracks.",1524268800,,358,4.868852459016393
