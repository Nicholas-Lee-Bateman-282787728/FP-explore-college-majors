8061024,3,B0009I2OQQ,"Don't expecting this to be a full length direct-to-video movie either original or creative, it's just the first 5 episodes from the show edited into a movie. The episodes are as followed:

Ep. 1: The Treasure of Grundo
Ep. 2: Beware of the Mudblups (the cross are fingers scene at the beginning is cut out, and the scene when Grubby tries to feed his friends root stew but then they drop them onto Tweeg is edited out)
Ep. 3: Guests of the Grunges
Ep. 4: In the Fortress of the Wizard (the dialog at the beginning of the episode,Grubby's line ""Hey look, popcorn"", and the Wizzard mentioning the Gutangs are out of sync)
Ep. 5: Escape from the Treacherous Mountain

To me it's laziness, but at least it's for those who don't have or can't afford paying so much money for the complete sets on DVD. But if you do own them don't buy this. I only recommend this for kids and families for the most parts.",1372464000,2,898,4.37125748502994
