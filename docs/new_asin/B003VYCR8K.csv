8407208,5,B003VYCR8K,"The maestra in La Maestra in the House is Mar Louise Nanna
first violinist for the Buffalo Philharmonic and musical director/ conductor of Ars Nova--a community orchestra established by Mar Louise in 1978 and still going strong 32 years later--or stronger

Buffalo is a city well known for the music and musicians
who have always thrived there .  It's a musical town and
it's the Ars Nova group and the involvement with it by MaryLouise Nanna that energizes the film and provides a
closeup of the effect such a project has on the people and
cultural vibes of a city.

I should mention that I know MaryLouise Nanna, also Julia D'Amico who produced and directed the film, indeed they are friends so anything I say in this review could never be considered objective but I will do my best.

Buffalo is a city of neighborhoods, in Mary Louise's case it was East Lovejoy--a mix of blue collar immigrant types--German, Polish, Italian.  It was a family of musicians beginning with the grandfather--Papa Louie--a guitarist. Mary Louise's father--Pete the Barber--played mandolin with the mother on piano. There were 4 uncles--two clarinet players, a saxophonist and a drummer.

Sunday was the day for a family gathering and following the food off came the apron of Mary Louises Mother and down she sat at the piano to hammer out some rousing blues or honky tonk with the rest of the family joining in.  But even among these highly accomplished performers Mary Louise stood out as an extraordinary talent--a prodigy

Musicans have a problem--a problem they share with actors which is: the requirement of an audience. Writers can write and painters paint and even if the work is never published or on display in a gallery its too bad but it isn't fatal. The work remains valid.

Music is different. A musician alone in his or her room
practicing away  does so in a vacuum and the notes, no matter how inspired or exquisitely played, fall on non existent ears and it is only in the presence of an audience that musicians can take real satisfaction in the practice of their art--or profession.  Its like a surgeon without a body to cut upon.
Thats the musicians problem and for the conductor its the same.  The musician needs an audience and the conductor needs an orchestra.

Back to MaryLouise.  MaryLouise wanted to conduct.  Why? Because there is a conductor type and she is the type--something about being up there on the conductors podium hacking furiously with the baton to whip the musicians into an inspired state.  Also the conductor is a total musician who must assimilate knowledge of all the instruments and how they integrate within the score to provide the desired
effect--the MaryLouise Nanna effect.

That was the beginning of Ars Nova--the church Concerts. Buffalo is a city of churches and a natural venue for these concerts that feature a core repertoire of the great 17th and 18th century baroque composers: Bach, Vivaldi, Scarlatti, etc.  I won't describe any of these event but leave it for you to enjoy them as you watch the film.

What is less apparent is the other hat she wears--the
administrative hat--the paperwork, the phone calls, the
running of errands, the shopping for this that and the
other and all the rest of it--the grunt work--that is indispensable to the smooth running of any community
project.

It is a tribute both to the enterprising spirit and sheer
physical stamina of this woman and the terrific enthusiasm
of the city in its response to her achievement--Ars Nova

She is amazing and a perfect fit for an extraordinary city.",1297555200,,3560,4.831960461285008
8407209,4,B003VYCR8K,"I was spurred to rewatch this wonderful documentary after the recent passing of Milton Rogovin, who chronicled Buffalo, NY with his camera. In 1958 Rogovin began a collaboration with William H. Tallmadge, a professor of music at the State University College at Buffalo. Rogovin took photographs of storefront churches and the music makers, preachers and parishioners within and Talmadge made audio recordings.

Please consider watching ""La Maestra in the House"" for another ""audio / visual"" look into Buffalo's church music scene from another angle.

The documentary starts off very casually and humorously at a garage sale and you are quickly brought into the Buffalo classical music scene. Baroque music is heard at a local church and burly workman's boots and black heels alike tap along to the music. We learn about the life of conductor and violinist Marylouise Nanna and her Ars Nova chamber orchestra, along side a glimpse of Buffalo over the years. We witness rehearsals and performances. The musicians greet their fans and clean up after shows, putting away cables and chairs; a DIY attitude that is not normally associated with classical music!",1296345600,,1154,5.232432432432432
8407210,5,B003VYCR8K,"La Maestra in the House is a genuine portrayal of a real musician in the most idyllic sense of the word.  Marylouise Nanna has brought her music to the people of Buffalo in a very special way.  The Viva Vivaldi series, started by her over 30 years ago, is a mainstay of the arts community.  November Sundays have taken on a special meaning for the standing room only audiences that vie for a seat at these concerts.

This documentary captures the very essence of her enthusiasm and how she conveys this warmth to the audience.  The portrayal of her family is heartwarming and reminds us of the great influence a close and caring family can have on our lives.

La maestra in the House is a documentary that can be enjoyed by musicians and non-musicians alike.

8407211,5,B003VYCR8K,"""La Maestra in the House"" is a beautiful and multi-faceted DVD.  On one level it provides a glimpse into the Buffalo music scene which, in itself, is impressive.  On a deeper level, however, it shows how women invaded the music world as performers and, in rare cases, as conductors.

The DVD's protagonist is Marylouise Nanna, a native of Buffalo, who grew up in a modest middle-class family in which music occupied a special place.  Encouraged by her parents, she soon displayed considerable talent as a violinist and ultimately joined the Buffalo Philharmonic.

Some years ago she had a tremendous vision:  She assembled a group of talented musicians, and each November offers to the public ""Viva Vivaldi"", a series of four first-rate concerts.  An ingenious touch is the choice of venues for the occasions.  Buffalo has some magnificent older churches and temples and a different one is chosen for each concert, keeping the admission cost well within the reach of virtually everyone - and this is certainly reflected in the large and diverse audiences.

A female conductor is still a rare sight that can surprise when encountered for the first time.  Watching Maestra Marylouise in action, however, soon turns the surprise into astonishment.  Her energetic performances display passion and impressive precision, and after a concert, or two, a female conductor becomes an established and accepted reality.  This transformation of perceptions is certainly one of her significant gifts to the world of music.

A community is often blessed with many talented individuals whose gifts are not widely recognized for want of exposure to the public.  Maestra Nanna's concerts often feature such rare gems, usually a thrilling treat.  She also encourages youngsters to strive for excellence, and this is reflected in frequent appearances of the Suzuki Strings.

Marylouise Nanna is a person of great warmth and openness and this emerges prominently in this beautiful video.  Her talents and her commitment add luster and class to her native Buffalo.  Viva la Maestra!
