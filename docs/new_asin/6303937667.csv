7856068,3,6303937667,"This movie is very well titled. This is by no means a complete portrait of Francois Truffaut. It is only a few ""Stolen Portraits"" strung  together.
Much of the footage here is quite interesting and informative.  What is most noticeable about the film, however, is not what is included  but what is missing. A previous reviewer remarked on the notable absence of  Jean-Pierre Leaud. To that I would also ask, since Truffaut was so noted  for his work with children, why no interview with the grown-up Jean-Pierre  Cargol from the ""Wild Child""? Or with any of the kids from  ""Small Change?"" And what I wouldn't have given for an interview  with Isabelle Adjani!
There is one brief scene where Truffaut and Cargol  are seen talking between takes of ""The Wild Child."" It is the  only scene in this movie where we see Truffaut being Truffaut, and it  leaves you wanting much, much more.
Still, I give the movie three stars  because it is a valuable reference for anyone who considers themself a  major Truffaut fan. However, the movie should really come with the warning  ""For Truffaut fans only"" because if you are asking yourself  ""Who is Francois Truffaut?""...this movie is not a good  introduction. Go watch ""The 400 Blows"" instead.",967334400,5,1231,4.79047619047619
