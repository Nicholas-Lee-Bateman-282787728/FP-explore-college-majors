7932242,5,B000056MNQ,"My four-year-old daughter had never seen Hello Kitty before, but we love comparing versions of fairy tales, so this seemed right up our alley.  And she loved it.  And who am I kidding, so did I.  In addition to the usual really cute characters and simple messages like ""be a good friend"" or ""be careful what you ask for"", it has those sly adult humor asides that Disney sometimes uses to great effect (and I don't mean adult as in naughty, but adult as in sophisticated).  I can still stand to watch it the thousandth time.",1006992000,33,523,4.416666666666667
