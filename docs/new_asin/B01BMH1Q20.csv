7664276,2,B01BMH1Q20,"It's a decent collection of banned cartoons, however the quality of the prints is terrible: out of focus, too light/too dark in places. Also missing some really key banned cartoons. Worth it if you haven't seen them, but quality is not good.",1516579200,4,241,4.761904761904762
7664277,3,B01BMH1Q20,"I have not actually seen this collection; however, /Kartoon Klassics Vols. 1 -- 10/ I did buy and watch, and so have seen at least two of them:
""SCRUB ME MAMA WITH A BOOGIE BEAT"", which didn't look that bad to me (I defer to the NAACP on this point, however) -- but did look as if some parts had been covered up, so the original may have been quite offensive; and
""INKI AND THE MINAH BIRD"", which I frankly didn't find bad at all. Of course, I /remember/ the Minah bird (and its musical theme) from my childhood -- but that may have been a different cartoon. The /name/ Inki is clearly a referense to skin color (""inky black""), and I suppose that is enough.
I also saw a version of ""Little Black Sambo"", which does have a tradition of racist opprobrium.
Which I always found odd, since I had a children's book which ended with the hero reducing a tiger to butter and using the butter on pancakes.
The cartoon I saw also featured a tiger. Which our hero defeats, defending his mother (and sister?).
And, of course, tigers are found in proximity to darker-skinned humans in India, not Africa. Still, I see that it might be offensive.",1516579200,,1131,4.390476190476191

7664279,3,B01BMH1Q20,"These cartoons are a mixed bag in terms of video and audio quality as one might expect from a collection of very old public domain cartoons. As historical artifacts of a bygone era, they are interesting to look at.  This is particularly true of the two entries from Warner Brothers' ""Censored Eleven"" and Walter Lantz, which demonstrate the same artistry as their more mainstream work but do so with images objectionable to modern sensibilities.",1515888000,,445,5.013513513513513

7664285,3,B01BMH1Q20,"Alpha Video/Oldies.com, the maker of this dvd is never known to produce high quality transfers.  However, absent availability from other more capable and better sources, this will do. It's quality you can live if you don't mind transfers that are way under the threshold of being a decent transfer. The cartoons themselves are fun to watch and would have been nice to keep for archival purposes if they were cleaned up to high grade quality. 3 stars, I think is generous.",1509235200,,471,4.814814814814815

7664302,1,B01BMH1Q20,"I haven't dealt with this level of poor-looking public domain cartoons since the VHS days. All 16 mm prints transferred at levels that YouTube would reject. It looks appalling. Most of the cartoons are pretty awful, too. Not good rubber hose animation nor of the quality we got used to in mid-century, though the last three would be great if the transfers were watchable.

I have no problem with the politically incorrect content. I bought it to look into racial mores of the early 20th century. Sadly, a lot hasn't changed.",1498003200,11,524,4.758241758241758

7664304,5,B01BMH1Q20,"These are vintage cartoons, so it is a wonder to have a copy of something this old.  Consequently, the picture and sound quality is not going to be high definition, and to expect such would be so out of context as to be foolish.  A great insight into the culture of the day, as most cartoons are written by and FOR adults who would understand all the innuendos and references.  As usual, excellent delivery service with Amazon.  Many of the cartoons you would have to think about why it would be ""banned"", usually over racial or 'politically correct' issues ... but such standards are highly inflated in our modern etiquette while so may other good principles are slandered.",1497139200,4,674,4.686440677966102

Most of all, they were funny.  While I agree they showed African Americans and Native Americans in something less than a favorable light so did most of the movies at the time.  If you are easily offended or are one of those who chooses to believe that this kind of thing was not common then, by all means, skip this collection.  If you have an open mind or are a history buff this is an eye-opening experience.  Have we come a long way since these were made?
