8105457,5,B000E3L79G,"This is a terrific video for people who have alzheimer's disease and like to see flowers, watch butterflies. It is videos of hundreds of different flower types in a natural garden setting with butterflies often in the video also. You can choose ""with"" or ""without"" the flower ID info on the screen (turn on only if person is mild cognitive impairment or early stage alzheimer's and they really like to read those IDs, turn off for everyone else with dementia). Then you choose from four different background audio: natural sounds, relaxing guitar music, Vivaldi music, and Classical selections - all are calm and relaxing.  This video will run 2 hours if you choose play all, terrific for background or watching by person with alzheimer's who is facscinated with gardens, flower, moving insects.....very nice.",1351900800,,809,5.082706766917293
