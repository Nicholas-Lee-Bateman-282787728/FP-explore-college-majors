Not a fan of the movie though!",1525478400,,57,4.2727272727272725
7893329,5,6305717095,"Who is Jeff really? This movie is far too smart for most stupid sheeple morons to even grasp. Maybe I am the crazy one, but I lived most of the lives featured in this film and so I got it, fully.",1485820800,,195,3.7804878048780486

7893332,3,6305717095,"This is a movie you want to hate, but it exercises its own fascination.
This film despite its 1998 vintage feels very much in the 80's spirit. It could almost be called a ""The Grown-up Ferris Bueller's Night Off.""
Every actor and director has to have one of these ""you-wouldn't-believe- what-happened-to-me-last-night"" Kafka-esque genre. They tend by their very nature to be surreal and have their exasperating appeal because of their very surreal, dark-side aspects. The sky is the limit as to how the writer imagines life ""must continue"" while the rest of the city sleeps. This genre cross-pollinates with other genres from horror to black humor to noir, etc.
""After Hours,"" ""Into the Night,"" ""The Blob,"" ""DOA,"" ""Miracle Mile"" and a few I forget at the moment come to mind. Even an Oswald the Rabbit cartoon is legendary about Oswald's adventure as a street gas-lamp lighter who finally escapes his predicament as the sun rises.
Initially, the main character starts by minding his own business and wants to deal with a personal problem by staying up at night, but an incident or character that emerges from the night ends up taking him into an odyssey of discovery and into situations that the character would ordinarily never enter in broad daylight and meets with some unsavory stereotypes he would never cross.  At some point all the main character wants is a return to the normalcy of daytime, but his voyage has just begun. Just as the main character believes he has turned a corner, his predicament escalates. And this crisis makes him able to cope the daytime problems he yearned to escape.
If done poorly, these movies will be hated, yet will still appeal to a certain demographic. They tend to lack the unities and nothing seems ""to happen."" It's the situations concocted by the screenwriter and the _character's reactions_ to the situations that provide the entertainment. They are seldom linear and can be exasperating. Think of them as ""hip"" Laurel and Hardy movies, sans obvious slapstick (although one of these scenes is obligatory). They are movies you love to hate but can't seem to stop watching. And later ask yourself, ""how could I sit through it?""
There: ""Night-time film"" genre 101...",1230595200,,2207,4.948787061994609
7893333,2,6305717095,I like alot of movies estevez is in and I also Like Steven Weber(especially from wings). On paper this looks like a solid pairing and youd think a movie about going out on the town to party would be pretty good. I was very dissapointed. This movie was made in 1998 and I just watched it Yesterday and now I know why? I am being generous with 2 stars.,1208131200,,350,4.086956521739131
7893334,2,6305717095,"Steven Weber is one of my favorite funny man and if you ever seen him in Wings, you know his persona. He tries to cheer his buddy Dan (played by Emilio Estevez) up after his wife left him. They go into this night club and that is where the fun begins. He bring these two bar girls back to his room and they dance to the music by Blondie on top of the coffee table before falling off is very sexy and funny at the same time. All hell breaks loose after that and Dan tries to mend with his wife after a night of woo hooo fun.

Not a very good movie and probably shouldn't be watch if your have a break up either.",1123286400,,610,3.88
7893335,5,6305717095,"It depends on you; it depends on your experiences.
This movie might be good for you; you can find something very similar to you...
If you have ever been one of this guy, or if you have ever spent a night like this.
I like it very much.",1010620800,2,235,3.9166666666666665
7893336,4,6305717095,"Yet the beginning of this movie does seem to sort of remind you of  Swingers, the movie turns itself around.  It turns out to be a great movie  in total.  I do have to say that if you like this movie, then you will also  like Swingers.  This movie really deserved more credit.",965347200,,276,4.113207547169812
7893337,3,6305717095,"For a straight to video comedy with a box that spoofs Swingers,this movie was pretty funny...  this movie had me laughing all the waythrough... even though the plot was thin, and the outcome pretty obvious...  The movie had a lot of good drinking and party scenes, and it's heavy on drugs humor--so if that's not your thing, maybe you should pass it up.  Fortunately for me, I like that kind of stuff. Nothing new, but not unbearable.",962841600,2,434,4.6103896103896105
