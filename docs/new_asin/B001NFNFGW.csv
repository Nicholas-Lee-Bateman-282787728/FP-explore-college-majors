8326673,2,B001NFNFGW,"The film moves along as if it is a poorly done version of ""No Exit."" A man and a woman are in a prison. They don't know how they got there. There are strange things going on as well as annoying flashbacks. There is also a subplot of a model being interrogated for murder. She attempts to act sexy and cool during the questioning aka Sharon Stone. We also see dead bodies (no faces).

As a ""No Exit"" type movie, it was cleverly, but poorly done. I know that is hard to do. It was a good idea, but poorly executed. The acting and dialouge had the poor quality of a soft core film. There were no tense or scary scenes as the scenes change too often with annoying flashbacks to allow it.

Now if you thought I gave you a plot spoiler, I didn't as this wasn't a ""No Exit"" film. While the ending tied the movie together, I just shook my head and said, ""You got to be kidding."" The shorter German version was far better. No sex or nudity. Not worth the view.",1302912000,2,951,4.10752688172043
8326674,2,B001NFNFGW,"Well, it doesn't give me any pleasure to post a negative review - but since no-one has written one yet, maybe I can warn some people off.

Dark Reprieve doesn't have an original premise, but I'll let that slide.  However, there are plenty of other things to complain about.

This is low budget stuff, and it shows.  It appears they found a good location and seemed dead set on doing something with it.  Things go wrong right from the start - with the script.  Basically two people wake up in a prison block, and don't know how they got there.  This severely limits the locations we're going to get.  So the two central characters sit and talk.  And talk.  And talk.  And talk.  At one point they even say:  ""We've tried every way to get out of here!""  Well, you could have fooled me, because they hardly move!  They sit and talk.  And talk.  The script was clearly at fault for this.

The acting hovers - probably - just on the right side of professional, although there are dips in form when this goes to being Z-grade.  The camera work is boring - but when hardly anything is happening I don't know whose fault this is.

Now, interspersed with all this are some monsters.  Real monsters.  And that's enough about them because................

The film is intercut with some apparently unrelated footage of a beautiful woman (not the captive woman) being questioned about five murders.  It's all a bit of a mystery until.............

The most ridiculous and stupid twist at the end....  extremely childish and dumb I was insulted (and that was after 90 or so minutes of taking insult after insult from the script).

So all in all - only watch this is you've truly nothing better to do.  I like to support new horror, new directors, and new actors..... but all can, and hopefully will, do better than this.  Because this one is really really poor.

Sorry.",1238803200,5,1856,4.570121951219512
