4593972,5,B00576U9AS,"I hadn't watched Yu Yu Hakusho in several years until I came across Funimation's release of the seasons on blu ray.  I remember the series as a fun ride, though I didn't recall many specifics of the plot.  I ended up purchasing the first 3 sets on blu ray.  There was a pleasant sense of familiarity as I watched the sets.  I can say with definite certainty that I will also purchase the last set as well.

  As for this specific set, I believe it is my favorite of the 3 thus far.  The action is intense from the very beginning as the set starts off in the beginning of the final round of the Dark Tournament.  The fights are very exciting/over the top and take up the whole first disc of the set.  The only negative I have is that I feel the final fight with Toguro draggs out a bit too long, but it is still epic an battle nonetheless.  The disc wraps up with a fitting end to the arc.  As for the rest of the episodes, they center around the Black Saga arc.  Going into these episodes I didn't really know what to expect, for I had stopped watching the series before the final fight with Toguro for one reason or another.  I found myself pleasantly surprised to see that this new arc was as good, if not better, than the last.  There are less fights in this arc, yet the tone gets geared to an even darker shade as things begin to take the worst possible turn.  Some new characters are introduced and they're all rather interesting; especially the new main antagonist.  That's all I'm going to speak of the plot in this set, but needless to say, it was a joy to be immersed in.

  I find myself excited to see what happens in the final set.  As for the blu ray upscale, I find the animations to appear very nice.  For the time it was released, and to see it look this sharp, I'm very pleased.  I believe it actually looks better than the first season, for the animations in general seemed to have gotten better and more established by this point.  I never owned the DVD sets, so I can't compare them.  I imagine these are noticeably better, especially if you're viewing this on a larger HD TV like I am.  The set also sounds very crisp at high volumes.  I always did enjoy the soundtrack as well.  All in all, 28 episodes for just over $20 (off of Amazon, at least) is a steal in my eyes.  If you have any interest at all in this, (or any of the other sets for that matter) then go for it.  You won't be displeased.

  5/5 stars.",1320019200,12,2433,4.174568965517241
4593973,3,B00576U9AS,"I had read on bluray.com that the video quality on the YYH blurays was outstanding, but I found that when played on my Samsung upconverting bluray player, the dvds I already owned look just as good. Funimation put too many episodes on each bluray (8-9 in most cases), so the bitrate is not as high as it could have been, compared to the Region A Japan release, of which I've seen screenshots.

Also, Funimation did its usual abysmal job with the subtitles, making lots of spelling and punctuation errors, using the wrong word, duplicate words, missing words, iffy translations...the bluray subs are actually a little worse than the dvd subs. Funimation should have taken the dvd subs and used a simple spell-checker. That would have caught perhaps 50% of their spelling errors, and would have made the release better at the cost of only a little time.

The audio is the only feature with which I have no complaints. I used a Sony Dolby 7.1 receiver with some good speakers and a subwoofer, and the series sounded great in both English and Japanese.

The space saving is nice - on the first two sets, 6 blurays in 2 cases for 56 eps (1/2 the series) could have replaced my old Dark Tournament set, original volume 8, and sets 3 and 4 of the 2-disc dvd release. However, with no significant video improvement and worse subs, I will stay with my dvds even though they do take up more than 3 times the space.",1316217600,2,1404,4.541501976284585

4594016,5,B00576U9AS,"OMG, I am thrilled to have purchased this DVD.  Growing up watching the series as a child, this brings back so many memories.  Yu Yu Hakusho is easily one of my favorite anime's of all time.

The package comes with 3 discs, roughly 9-11 episodes per CD. As far as quality, I am impressed.  The fact that it was remastered frame by frame in HD quality is amazing and it shows. I'll admit, watching Yu Yu Hakusho in its original quality gives you a feeling of nostalgia, but this version is excellent and I can't say anything bad about these.

It seems like each saga gets better and better. Each saga is great in its own way, but this saga deals with some strong dark serious issues and not only that, but it leaves you wondering what will happen next and will Yu Yu Hakusho be able to save his world in time. All the characters are great and still going strong in this saga, and the new villian is not bad his self. Plus, I love that these are uncut episodes, and not the edited ones that use to come on Cartoon Network.

It is! I'm really picky about video quality, and I was expecting a low-effort upscale job, but it turned out to be better than I could have hoped for such an old series. The colors and lines are vibrant and clear, and the artifacts that bothered me so much on the old DVDs have been smoothed away. They even relaid the text on the titles so it would be legible at 1080p. YYH was my first ""real"" anime, and it warms my withered, jaded heart to see it get such a loving remaster.

It really is worth the extra money if you are looking for clearer sound and a crisper picture. Plus there are a few extra perks to owning the bluray--such as added comentay (if that's your thing), and bloopers/outakes...which are actually hilarious. The ONLY thing that is disappointing about my bluray is that the brackets were broken when I received it. So now when I go to open the case the middle section falls out, if you can picture that. At least the bluray itself wasn't damaged. If you choose to purchase this product used, then either buy from someone you have bought from before or do some research on the quality of their products first...like reading reviews for example.

*IMPORTANT TO KNOW*
I'm reviewing this after having viewed the DVD version, and having just bought a 46"" Samsung LED TV.

I must say....that I'm rather disappointed in this blu-ray ""remastering.""

The Positive:
-The iconic, classic soundtrack sounds AMAZING
-The colors have been restored and are FANTASTIC
-4:3 ratio has been kept, so you see the anime as it was CREATED
-Very crisp, clean detail in image

The Negative (and in my eyes, a HUGE negative)
-This is not really a frame-by-frame ""back to analog"" remastering (or in my eyes is not). What bugs me the most (maybe because I expected it) is that there is a TON of dirt on the analog that they didn't clean. Therefore, you are PLAGUED by glittering white spots, and even occasional tears or hair. This also gets WORSE throughout the series, particularly during the Dark Tournament! The colors are great, so ""Black shadows"" are truly black, but there is so much dirt that they left behind that the blackness shimmers with white specks!

Now please, don't get me wrong. This is a great series that is being sold at a great price and, in my mind, is worth buying. However, TRUST ME in saying that this isn't a true remastering such as seen by Disney (such as the Lion King) or the brilliant remasterings of the James Bond films. I UNDERSTAND that it would take forever to digitally remove all the dirt, but they could have AT LEAST gone back to the analog, cleaned it, then ran it through the converter.

I must give this product a 3 out of 5. In all honesty, I give it a 1 out of 5 for the ""Remastering,"" but I give this series, plus the appealing price, plus the great color and sound a 5 out of 5. I recommend this series, but if you are like me, you will be annoyed by all the ""dirt"" on the footage.

(BTW, these dirt spots are apparent throughout the DVD version. The quality is much better on the Blu-ray overall, but the dirt was not removed)

I hope this review helps. I feel like all the ""most helpful reviews"" on this product are very poor reviews or are too biased to mention this.
