8069585,4,B000062XFT,"During the height of the ""Babes and bullets"" Hong Kong actioners of the 1990's Jade Leung was in the running with her perhaps more prolific rivals, eg Moon Lee, Cynthia Khan etc. She was equally acrobatic and interestingly here plays the female equivalent of Mel Gibson's Lethal Weapon cop, at once both suicidal and gung-ho.
Girls-in-action movies usually get a lukewarm response. I enjoy them myself and can't resist watching a cutie bundle taking down bad guys with good old Chinese chop-sockee or, if that's not enough, blasting them in traditional Clintwood fashion with lead. These dames are tougher than they look. They sure don't mess around.
This is a typical over-the-top example that is fast-paced and snappily directed. I found it good entertainment for all those reasons. Our zero-tolerant heroine thinks back to when her husband was murdered as he shielded her. Since then she has embarked on a rabid do-or-die quest to clean the Hong Kong streets by any means possible, regardless of any constraint by procedure.
She tries to get a stooge to talk by beating and tying him to a very English-looking old style red pillar box and lobbing a live grenade inside. Those cast-iron edifices for the mail are built like armored tanks. I felt sorrier for the contents than the strapped on guy!
I could almost hear her superior's thoughts about this literal loose cannon in the ranks:- ""Her again! Perhaps a sideways move is called for. London? Sydney? Tokyo? Ah well, I guess it will have to be Shanghai. ANYWHERE but here!""
It seems that Shanghai is more 'PC' than HK, rather like Boston used to be as opposed to NYC. This of course doesn't suit the Leung character one bit, or so she thinks. It's not long before the action cranks up again in tandem with a deceptively timid-seeming female partner, she saddled with a geeky wimp of a boyfriend. Leung finds love again encountering the arch-crook's lawyer (Russell Wong, quite dishy to the girls in those days) but that naturally has complications.
WHY is it whenever something raunchy comes up film composers, up to recent times anyway, constantly fall back on a hoary bloody wailing saxophone? That was my only gripe. One way or the other men foul up the women's lives it seems.
Happily action storms back, this time in Indonesia for a change. It all suitably ends with one of those classic fights on a peak against a guy with a steel arm and one of those hair-raising clinging-to-a-helicopter sequences. Naturally a fantastic double is used in places but Leung's contribution to the stunts is not negligible when you can see that it is her in shot. Rest your brains, sit back and enjoy.",1379980800,,2645,4.815384615384615
