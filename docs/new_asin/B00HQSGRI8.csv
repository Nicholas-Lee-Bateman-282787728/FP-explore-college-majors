8634458,3,B00HQSGRI8,"Piranha, Piranha is a real non-starter. After sitting through two great exploitation movies with The Female Bunch and Tarzana to settle with it's boring, PG nothingness is rather sad. Tarzana and Bunch are badly beaten up though in their prints, the best I guess Code Red can afford. Both movies are missing footage, more damaging is Tarzana's missing footage which included a brief ass shot of Antonietta Fiorito/ Judy getting out of the bath during part of the movie which while not essential does kind of get rid of some of the T&A that is the life blood of this movie, other tiny snippets are missing from this version too due to print damages or jumps including some of the beginning, this compared to a version I watched on Youtube that had a Something Weird Video stamp on it.

As it is, according to sources this movie is suppose to run 87 minutes, but runs 82 instead, could be some edits but I can't really tell besides the obvious ones. There's still plenty of T&A in the flick with the beautiful Femi Benussi parading around naked nearly throughout.

The Female Bunch I read is also missing footage but I haven't watched it yet to tell if it effects it. And from most sources it really doesn't matter at this point considering this is apparently the best print these people can get for this movie.

Now I have to say there really is no excuse for Tarzana's brief edits because frankly they could have asked Something Weird Video or Image or whoever is running it now that the guy running it has passed to the great beyond to provide a better print of the movie. But I guess not.",1460419200,5,1590,4.513888888888889
