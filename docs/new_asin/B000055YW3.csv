7931313,5,B000055YW3,"My daughter was born with birth defects and uses prosthetic legs.  This tape, specifially the story featuring KC has helped her friends learn how to treat her.  We love Clifford",1063670400,3,177,4.866666666666666
7931314,5,B000055YW3,"This is one of the 4 clifford videos that we have.  Both my 2 year old AND my 4.5 year old are Clifford lovers.  Clifford is one video that they both want to watch.  As a parent I like the gentle nature of the show, the morals, and its overall kid appeal and fun!  I also like it because it is not too long that the kids become a couch potato, its a good length.  This video (like all the others) is basically some of the same stories that are played on PBS.  This particular Clifford video ""Best Friends"" is one of the most requested, and I even find myself interested in Clifford and his friends...especially the ""whiffy the skunk ghost with its stinky stink"" story, that is so cute!  We love Clifford, and could own ALL the videos! I can bet that most kids would like this series, but if you have to choose just one...this one is a good choice!",1046390400,3,847,4.191358024691358
7931315,5,B000055YW3,"I bought this for my 2.5 year old son, because he just can't get enough of ""big red dog"", but I'm amazed that my 6 year old likes to watch it too!  It runs usually 4-5 times a day and at least one of my kids watches it every time!  It teaches great lessons about friendship and how to treat others.  I've even found myself getting drawn into it at times.  It brings back great memories of when I was a child myself!  This is a must have for any parent of small children!!",994550400,4,471,3.9680851063829787
7931316,5,B000055YW3,"My daughter absolutley loves the antics of Clifford and his friends.  The message the video sends about real friends and acceptance of others are wonderful, yet they are stated in terms that even a two year old can grasp.  I enjoy watching Clifford with her, because it is not a syrupy and sappy as some of the other children's shows out there.  I am sure that other children will love the big red dog as much as mine does!",982972800,3,423,4.329113924050633
