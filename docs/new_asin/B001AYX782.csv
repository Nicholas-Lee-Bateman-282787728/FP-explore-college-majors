8280386,5,B001AYX782,"I thoroughly enjoyed this dvd, it was one that you don't want to walk away from during viewing! Each moment seems to be a white knuckle-er
It depicts some very harrowing actual hostage accounts of the past, where time is of the essence and the most intellegint minds are pushed to the limits to beat the clock to figure out what they have going on, who they are dealing with, and where and when the best vantage point is to take out the combatants to save multiple innocent lives. There is an elementary school takeover, a passenger train takeover, and the infamous Luftansa plane takeover. This is a video that is great to watch again and again, and a great video for entertaing guests too.",1266796800,4,691,4.536
