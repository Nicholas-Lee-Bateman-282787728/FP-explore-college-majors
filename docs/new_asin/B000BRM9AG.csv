It's really that bad.  I think these people just took a home video camera along to Italy and filmed themselves talking in front of monuments.  It seems totally unscripted, in a bad way.  I rarely take the time to write reviews, but at $3.99 I feel like I should warn others.  I'm an avid traveler (about 30 countries so far at age 28) and I love documentary films, especially about other places.  This is just bad.",1351209600,2,578,4.447619047619048
8091487,1,B000BRM9AG,"This is the worst video that I've experienced. It's what happens when video making becomes democratic. She lingers on a rat, yes a rat, in Venice. We watch her wash her cloths. They visit an Etruscan burial site, and act like teenagers at a horror movie for several long minutes. It's just really long with very little useful information. I want my money back.",1284681600,2,360,4.640625
8091488,1,B000BRM9AG,"This is amateur video at it's worst. Highlights of the guides trip through New Zealand included actual footage of clouds that blocked the view of Mt. Cook. I would expect a real video montage of New Zealand would at least require the videographer to go back on a Sunny day so that they could splice in footage of the mountain.

Our guides were also more focused on the cheap side of New Zealand. While I prefer to spend my money wisely and don't stay at high end establishments, I will say if I'm traveling to the other side of the world I'm not going to skip an attraction because there is a fee involved.

Instead of spending your money on this video, just take some time to review other travelers logs of trips to New Zealand. You'll learn more and also get an idea of things you want to try and things you want to avoid. This video did none of that. If I had the time, I could have created a more meaningful video diary of my 3 week New Zealand trek.",1213833600,,954,4.2076502732240435
8091489,2,B000BRM9AG,"This video hit some locations in New Zealand that were off the beaten path.  But be aware, this is not a top notch professional grade tour video of New Zealand.  For example, Milford Sound was not covered in any way.  Neither were any of the glaciers covered.

It did however show us typical weather (like the rainy days as well as the good ones) and made us realize we need to bring our rain jackets and warm clotes to New Zealand, even in the late spring.  And the hostess was warm throughout.

In summary, it was a bit slow, and I was expecting a much larger overview of New Zealand from this product.",1175472000,4,604,4.300884955752212
8091490,5,B000BRM9AG,"I was impressed by this DVD because it has helpful information while also being entertaining. The hosts are enthusiastic, not taking themselves too seriously, and they've picked fascinating places to visit in Sydney. Most importantly, they show accommodations and restaurants that are not bottom-of-the-barrel cheap. Many travel guides cater only to backpackers, but I want something better without being overly expensive. I'm planning a trip there myself, so I'm sure this DVD will be useful.",1138492800,2,493,5.586666666666667
8091491,5,B000BRM9AG,"This DVD really brought back memories! I was in Sydney a couple years ago and I too enjoyed the zoo and aquarium. I saw the opera house and climbed the bridge. Didn't know about the botanical garden. The hosts give lots of handy tips for what to see, where to stay and getting around town. If your planning to go Down Under this will be helpful. I want to go back after watching this show!",1138060800,4,389,4.2
