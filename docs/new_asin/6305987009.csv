1103655,1,6305987009,"Whoever wrote the initial review was not watching this serial. The sound is muffled, the video is murky,
  and the story is enough to put you to sleep within 10 minutes. You will probably not get to read this
  because my low rating will be interpreted as a sales killer by Amazon. So, I will say, ""Buy this video, if
  you do not like a quality serial, you will love this one!!"" I looked forward to showing on Saturday to
  ""The Loony Goons,"" but I'll stick with SPY SMASHER, CAPTAIN MARVEL, or SUPERMAN. There is one saving grace:
  At the beginning, some couples are shown dancing in Chapter 1, so if you were interested in the dance steps
  of the era, you have them to see. Also, the atmosphere is claustrophobic and maze-like - as though the dancers
  could not possibly miss the action involving Lugosi, but they did.  If I was sure of how to spell abysmal,
  that is what I would call, ""Chandru the Magician:"" Absymal",1332979200,,925,4.410714285714286
1103656,2,6305987009,"Serials date back to the silent era and were a popular ticket well into the 1950s, but while we remember Pearl White and Flash Gordon fondly, the genre did not really blossom until Republic Studios began to generate a series of high quality serials in the 1940s.  Serials are an acquired taste, but titles such as SPY SMASHER, THE ADVENTURES OF CAPT. MARVEL, and the Columbia-made THE PHANTOM set such high standards that they remain extremely entertaining to this day.  Unfortunately, that makes earlier serials, especially ones made by lesser studios, seem positively creaky, and such is sadly the case with Bela Lugosi's serial work.

In the 1930s Lugosi would appear in five serials: THE WHISPERING SHADOW and THE RETURN OF CHANDU, both from 1934; SHADOW OF CHINATOWN, 1936; SOS COAST GUARD, 1937; and THE PHANTOM CREEPS, 1939.  While these were occasionally imaginative in concept, they were also produced by low-rent studios that were more concerned about budget than quality, and as a result all four are pretty ho-hum.  And such is the case with THE RETURN OF CHANDU, which was based on the 1932 film CHANDU THE MAGICIAN (in which, ironically, Lugosi played the villian), and which was itself based on a radio series of the same name, which played in various incarnations and with occasional breaks all the way from 1932 to 1950.

The Lugosi series, which is in twelve chapters, presents Lugosi in a very rare heroic role: Chandu, raised in the orient, and master of white magic.  When an Egyptian princess is threated with kidnapping and human sacrifice, Chandu rushes to her aid--and the result is very much what one might expect of a 1934 cliffhanger.  Poisonous darts are fired.  Cars wreck.  The princess is kidnapped!  The princess is placed under a black magic spell!  And so on.  The trouble with it is that THE RETURN OF CHANDU actually looks a bit like one of the movies Lugosi made with the notorious director ED Wood some twenty-something years later.  Everything is incredibly cheap, everything looks like it was done in a single shot with no retakes, the script is weak, the plot is weak, and the special effects are just as unspecial as they can be.

There are several versions of the serial.  There is, of course, the original serial itself, which ran about three and a half hours in all twelve chapters.  Somewhat later, the serial was edited into at movie 1935 movie version titled CHANDU ON THE MAGIC ISLAND, used the second half of the serial, and ran about sixty minutes.  It also appears that somewhat later the entire series was edited into a feature-length film of about an hour and a half to two hours and again titled THE RETURN OF CHANDU.  Given that the film seems to be in public domain, there are also an abundance of DVD versions, some the serial, some the feature-length version.  Unfortunately, and again given that the film seems to be in public domain, the print seems pretty bad regardless of distributor.  The picture is at best grainy, and it is often cluttered with streaks, scratches, and artifacts, and the sound tends to come and go.

Bela Lugosi was a memorable performer, but although he was popular in serials during the 1930s, these do not really show him at his best, and unless you are a diehard Lugosi fan you might want to pass on his serials in favor of the more obvious--and superior--feature films like DRACULA, THE BLACK CAT, and so on.

1103657,1,6305987009,The print on the VCI edition is just as bad on other cheaper or 2 part editions - awful. I don't know who this Lovin's guy from MO is but he sounds like somebody from VCI and I'm surprised amazon let him post such biased reviews over and over again. The sound and picture on some chapters is as bad as it gets on DVD..not the way most people like 'em Mr. Jim.,1292198400,,359,3.9315068493150687

1103659,5,6305987009,"I own this same 1934 serial which was first available by purchasing these two SEPARATELY-PACKAGED DVDs from ALPHA VIDEO:

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Return-of-Chandu-the-Magician-Vol-1/dp/B00006SFJ0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Return of Chandu the Magician, Vol. 1</a>
(Volume One, Chapters 1-6)

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Return-of-Chandu-the-Magician-Vol-2/dp/B00006SFJ1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Return of Chandu the Magician, Vol. 2</a>
(Volume Two, Chapters 7-12)

By buying EITHER the newer singly-packaged version by VCI, OR, the separately-packaged version (by ALPHA VIDEO, as I have listed above), you will get the COMPLETE 1934 SERIAL, shown in its entirety, in 12 chapters. Now, there has been some discussion on reviews here that the VCI print is better than the ALPHA VIDEO print -- that's probably true but I have to say that I'm very pleased with the picture and sound quality of the latter. Thus, if budget is your priority, I think that you'll be plenty happy with ALPHA VIDEO's 2-volume version. If you're a stickler for quality, then you'll of course want the single-package VCI version.

I compared the total times and, whichever way you buy it, the VCI and ALPHA VIDEO versions are within four minutes of one another, based upon what the packaging descriptions state (the single VCI DVD totals 208 minutes and the two ALPHA VIDEO DVDs total 212 minutes), so I'm sure that they're very close in terms of scenes. I just wanted to let potential buyers know all this information in case they preferred to go with the two separate DVD option.

Also, this terrific Lugosi serial was later edited (cut) into the following 1935 film:

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Chandu-on-the-Magic-Island-Feature/dp/B0007OP1EY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Chandu on the Magic Island:Feature</a>

If you want this cut-down ""Movie Feature Version"" of the original serial, go with the above packaging and NOT this one:

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/AMC-Monsterfest-Chandu-on-the-Magic-Island-Ghosts-of-Hanley-House/dp/B000A7DVU4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">AMC Monsterfest: Chandu on the Magic Island/ Ghosts of Hanley House</a>

""Ghosts of Hanley House"" (which I own on a separate DVD of its own) is a really, cheesey, poorly made movie of a completely different genre so you're not getting a bargain by acquiring the two films on a single DVD!

""The Return of Chandu the Magician"" (serial) is just superb with Lugosi playing Frank Chandler, aka Chandu the Magician, as he battles on with the evil High Priest Vindhyan on the South Seas Island of Lemuria.

It is on this island where Chandu's fiance, the Egyptian Princess Nadji (played by the lovely Maria Alba) is being held captive until Chandu can rescue her. You'll love seeing the special effects as Chandu ""vanishes"" into thin air -- it really freaks out his adversaries too!

This serial entry is, of course, shot in black-and-white and the aspect is full-screen. As I previously mentioned, the total running time for the two-DVD option DVDs is 3 hours and 32 minutes <212 minutes>. (The running time for the 1935 feature film,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Chandu-on-the-Magic-Island-Feature/dp/B0007OP1EY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Chandu on the Magic Island:Feature</a>&nbsp;is only 65 minutes!)

1103663,2,6305987009,"Bela Lugosi is not typecast in this fantastic twelve-part adventure serial, playing the lead as Frank Chandler/Chandu the Magician, enjoying his role as a representative of the forces of White Magic pushed against those of Black, while displaying vigourous fighting skill, successfully wooing a young Egyptian princess, and cutting a lean and dashing figure in yachting gear, complete with nautical cap. The somewhat lumpy plot engages Chandler/Chandu in an ongoing series of escapades pointed at achieving the rescue of his fiancee, Princess Nadji(Maria Alba) and others from the clutches of the idol-worshipping sect of Ubasti, which covets Nadji's blood in order to revivify an ancient mummified princess entombed upon the mysterious island of Lemuria. Director Ray Taylor, an old hand at such entertainments keeps events moving briskly, but repeated scenes and footage, a good deal of which is to be found in the previous year's Skull Island setting from KING KONG, and the port locale from SON OF KONG, reduces original action to less than 60 minutes from the serial's running length of over two and one-half hours and, if viewed at one sitting, becomes lacking in effect to most viewers, unless insomniac.",1156550400,,1211,5.27979274611399

But they did manage to cleverly take advantage of his intimidating stare as he messes with the heads of the evil practitioners of black magic with his own magic, which comes to him from his teacher Yogi (a la Luke Skywalker's messages from Obi Wan Kenobi 43 years later).

But Lugosi as a hero is about the only interesting thing in this serial, and it doesn't save the film.  It's extremely slow-moving and tedious.  Poor script, poor direction, poor musical background.  It's probably the least exciting serial you'll ever see.  Many of the chapter endings don't even have legitimate cliffhangers.

Bela Lugosi (1882-1956) was a larger-than-life character with a terribly sad ending.  He was born Be'la Ferenc Dezso Blasko in the town of Lugos (hence the adopted surname), Hungary.  He was a distinguished Shakespearian actor in Hungary, but ended up a drug-addicted pauper in Hollywood.  His reputation went rapidly downhill after ""Dracula,"" largely because he accepted any film roles from the ""poverty row"" studios for any amount of money.  When he died of a heart attack in 1956 he was buried in his full Dracula costume, including a cape.  He was so broke that Frank Sinatra quietly paid for his funeral.

By the way, recognize the Great Gate of Lemuria?  It's the same set used for ""King King"" the year before.

It's a serial complete with pearl draped turbans, a magic ring  which can make one invisible, and a mummy case. If you like Lugosi and  campy fun.

7898906,4,6305987009,"""Return of Chandu, The Magician"" is a 12 chapter serial released in 1934 by Principal Pictures.  A rare example of Bela Lugosi playing the romantic lead, it seems to have aimed higher than its budget allowed, though not without some success.  It was directed by Ray Taylor, with screenplay by Barry Barringer, adapted from the radio program written by Harry A. Earnshaw, Vera M. Oldham and R. R. Morgan.

Those expecting a lot of fist fights, gun battles and car wrecks may be disappointed with this serial, which puts the emphasis on mysterious elements, though there are some traditional cliffhanger perils.  The plot has Egyptian Princess Nadji (Maria Alba) beset with mysterious enemies trying to abduct her.  Her friend, Frank Chandler (Bela Lugosi), known in the Orient as Chandu, the Magician, discovers that these enemies are of the Cult of Ubasti, cat worshipers and followers of black magic on the island of Lemuria.  The cult has recovered the mumified body of their high priestess, Ossana, and believe she can be brought back to life through the sacrifice of an Egyptian Princess.  They have but one candidate for the honour.

Chandu must first deal with a High Priest of Ubasti, Vindhyan (Lucien Prival) who has followed Nadji to California.  Eventually Nadji is spirited away to the Island of Lemuria, ruled by the Voice of Ubasti (Murdock McQuarrie).  Two features running about 60 minutes each were made from the serial, the first four chapters compiled under the same ""Return of Chandu"" title, the rest as ""Chandu on the Magic Island.""  As this suggests, the last eight chapters have a lot more ""filler"" with a ""retrospective"" chapter, stock footage and recycled sets, including the doors placed in the wall dividing Skull Island that proved the weak point in keeping King Kong contained.  The settings and some of the costumes provide interest; I especially like the cat robes worn by some of the cult members.  Chandu not only has to rescue Nadji, but also his sister, Dorothy Regent (Clara Kimball Young) and her two annoying teenage children, Betty and Bob (Phyllis Ludwig and Dean Benton) who have been captured by the native cannibals.  Chandu's powers of magic are limited on Lemuria, though he is helped by a White Magician, Tyba (Josef Swickard).  There are enough holes in the plot for ten serials, but Lugosi helps hold it together, and the film gives an idea of what might have been.

Prints of this serial have not survived in anything like pristine condition, and each of the available video editions has faults.

VCI's # 8386, on a double-layer disc, has the best image quality of the available DVD's, fairly sharp, well-framed and with decent gray scale, but in addtion to the print having a lot of scratches and related defects, there are many small pieces missing, often disrupting the dialogue, and a few larger breaks.  A couple chapters run about a minute shorter than they should, and there is no title on Chapter One.  In addition to the faults of the print, the opening credits have been ""enhanced"" by freezing the images after the puff of smoke used as a transition between sets of credits; the stopping and starting of the film is both obvious and annoying.  VCI has better sound than the others, with fairly good high-frequency response, but a number of clicks and ""pops"" are heard, some quite loud, that could have been avoided.  A couple chapters have the header with the MPPDA certificate numbers, entertainingly low in the 200's.  Unfortunately one of these was attatched to the wrong chapter.  The ""next week"" titles are present, but again with a freeze-frame image.  VCI includes some ""extra"" features, with ""Bios"" of Bela Lugosi, Ray Taylor and rather meager information on Maria Alba.  There are trailers for ""Undersea Kingdom,"" ""Tex Granger"" and ""Congo Bill"" plus the ""VCI Cliffhanger Promo"" having short clips from several trailers of serials available from VCI.  But at the end of the ""Undersea Kingdom"" trailer, the player goes into ""stop"" mode instead of returning to the menu, and it has to be restarted from the beginning of the disc, including the FBI warning and VCI's introduction.

Alpha's edition is on two single-layer DVD's, catalog numbers ALP 4062D and 4063D, or shrink-wrapped as 9544D.  It was first released in 2002, and is free from the logo that Alpha puts in the titles of their more recent releases.  Sharpness and gray scale are adequate, if worse than VCI's, but there are fewer scratches and no still-frame ""enhancement"" of the titles.  Total running time is a little over 210 minutes and the dialogue has only a few interruptions due to splices.  The sound is muffled, to the point where boosting the treble can't bring back the high frequencies, and while this makes the distortion and noise less obvious, it often makes the dialogue hard to understand.  Chapter 3 has a considerable amount of low-frequency noise, a crackle loud enough to be annoying, and a couple spots where the sound almost goes away.  Close to one of these points there is a short repeated section of the film as the evil high priest Vindhyan attempts to abduct Nadji.  Framing of the image isn't as good as VCI's, and a couple chapters are missing the ""next week"" titles, but most of the introductory text and credits can be read.  For those tolerant of mediocre image quality it is in some ways easier-to-watch than VCI's edition.

The DVD-R edition from Grapevine is from the same video source as the old VHS tape from Rhino, # RHVD 2416.  It has fewer missing pieces than either the VCI or Alpha DVD's, running 212 minutes, about 35 seconds of which are the MPPDA headers, present on six of the chapters and all but one of the ""next week"" titles are present.  But while Grapevine's website claims it is from ""the 35mm print,"" it might give 35mm a bad reputation.  Neither sharpness nor gray scale is as good as the Alpha edition, there are some scenes where the highlights burn out, and a periodic fading in some chapters.  The sound wasn't too clear in Rhino's version, though less muffled than Alpha's.  Grapevine makes it a little worse by what might be ""noise reduction"" which mostly adds some metallic-sounding racket noticed especially in the quiet parts.  It's still a ""watchable"" edition for those with tolerance for the defects, the most complete of these three, and it is fairly inexpensive.

This serial will be of interest primarily to fans of early sound serials, and to those curious as to what Bela Lugosi did other than Dracula or Mad Scientist roles.  The choice of video edtion depends on which faults can best be tolerated, but as with most serials the chapters should be watched with some time between them, especially the last eight where there is more repetition of earlier footage.",1363219200,,6760,4.861256544502618

And I agree, it may not be one of the best (or even better) serials to come out of the 1930's-40's, but it really has me hooked! Why?, I really can't explain it. Perhaps it's because I finally enjoyed seeing ""poor Bela"" starring as the action hero, or maybe it's even the Oriental mysticism that was so popular during this era. Or was it just the slow-moving, murky cinematic images that grace the screen. The musical score is one of the best ever for a serial, almost grand in conception, evoking the allure of Oriental mysticism while providing both tension and excitement.

The VCI release is the best out there. A couple of early chapters look a little shoddy, most likely due to source material, grainy, with lines, etc. But, overall, the print is quite clear and rather impressive with sharp contrast and good audio. It's probably never going to get any better than this any time soon. This IS THE dvd to buy if you want to see Chandu battle the infamous Ubasto Cult and ultimately save Princess Nadji from certain ""sacrificial"" death.

As mentioned above, this is one of my favorite serials. I love the slow pacing. It enhances the mood and plot development. The serial moves along more like a feature film than a cliffhanger. And Bela is just in SUPER BELA mode, a series should have been born from out of this!

Orientalism! Mysticism! And a primer for INDIANA JONES!
This is must-see pulp fiction at it's best. I'm surprised they didn't hand this one to Fritz Lang...only dreaming there.",1337990400,,1537,4.660516605166052
