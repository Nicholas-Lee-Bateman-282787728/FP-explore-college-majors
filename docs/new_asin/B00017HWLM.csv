1975742,4,B00017HWLM,"A very good biography of his great American pianist. It is good not because of what other people, musician or otherwise, say of him in this DVD as they are not very much to the point anyway. Instead, we are explained how a legend came into birth.

First of all, his musical background.  Even though it is true that the finishing touch came from Mrs Lhevinne in the Julliard, it was his mother who taught him to play the piano until he was 17.  His mother was not just any accomplished pianist: she was a pupil of Friedheim, himself a pupil of Lizst. There is a clip of Van sitting and listening intently to his mother at the piano: her playing was superb and the way he got spellbound was equally telling.

Furthermore, his rise came in the nick of time: he was the first American to win the International Tsaichovsky Competition ever. Moreover, the prize was won right in the midst of the Cold War. And yet the Russian audience were so spellbound by him, chasing after him bestowing on him all sort of presents in a way the far exceeded the warm reception Kissin experienced in London before or after his Albert Hall recital...

Here we have a glimpse of how he played, and also how passionately the audience applauded him and of how he responded to them on stage. From these clips we can see how spellbinding his playing was, and yet at the same time how witty he was and above all, what sort of personal charm this young artist possessed. His wit was highlighted by the short speech he made on arriving the US airport after snatching the much coveted prize.

Thereafter, he publicized a great deal, mainly by promoting classical music among the younger generation, impressing upon them that classical music is not something illusive and on the other hand, he concertized all over the country so that people in the street would say, ""in Rock & Roll we have Elvis and in piano we have Van Cliburn..."". Moreover,  being the only US Tsaichovsky winner then, he had been playing for all the American Presidents in the White House since then. And the culmination came when he played for President Reagan's national Guest of Honour Mr and Mrs Gorbachev, helping the world to break the ice between the West and the Russians. It obviously worked, for soon afterwards the Berlin Wall was knocked down...

This DVD may be short, as clips of Van Cliburn are rare anyway. But it is quality instead of quantity that matters after all. Without a doubt, this is a very good portrayal of this very talented pianist, both of his legend and of his art.",1110758400,29,2536,4.546052631578948
1975743,4,B00017HWLM,"What you'll get here: 45 minutes of brief statements from people who

know him, a lot of clips of him in various locations, and 15 minutes of clips

from concerts.  There are no complete

performances and there are no complete interviews.

It's well known that Van hated making recordings, hated forever carving

in stone the way he did something.  For all the microphones and cameras

that surround him on this DVD, he's allowed virtually none of it to get

released.  That makes this footage all the more precious.

Nowhere else in the world are you going to see as much of the living

breathing Van Cliburn in your TV.  Nowhere else is there more footage

of his Tchaikovsky competition gala and nowhere else can you glimpse

more of him in solo recitals.  You can rest assured this is the

absolute most footage of him you'll ever see.

The performance clips are from 2 concerts he gave in the late 50's in

Russia.  Although the video is blurry, the sound is incredibly sharp,

undoubtedly recorded on separate equipment for an album which he never

cleared.

The few minutes of concert footage here reveal a much more vibrant,

spontaneous Cliburn than any of his studio recordings.  It confirms his

belief in recordings as pristene references, live performances being

the only suitable time for spontaneity.

It's no secret that Van's early recordings are extremely rigid and

straightforward.  Here for the first time we see what he was doing in

live performance during that same time period, and it's like a different pianist.

You see enough of his hands to discover he played with flat fingers

like Horowitz, stayed very close to the keyboard, and played everything

from the shoulder down.  That technique resulted in the distinct,

brassy sound of his 1972 recordings but here we see it in 1960.  It

took 10 years for him to transfer that tone quality to the studio.

Now there's nothing of the concerts after 1970.  The accompanying CD

does not contain the performances that you see on the DVD although it

does contain the same songs.  The CD is a reprint of the same studio

recordings you've known for the last 40 years.  What those live

performances, especially the Chopin Scherzo, must have sounded like is

entirely up to your imagination.",1094601600,57,2266,4.78125
8007507,5,B00017HWLM,"Youll see Ive labeled Van Cliburn a cultural icon. Of COURSE he was a gifted pianist, but there are many of those. What set Van Cliburn apart was the role he played in the musical (and political) events of his time. His stature is considerably taller than his mere music making (or his lanky 6 4 height).

Thus, I really enjoyed this set. It arrived while I was reading the recent biography of Cliburn, Moscow Nights. (Which I also recommend enthusiastically.)

The package is a real treat: a 50-minute documentary of Cliburns early and performing life lovingly narrated by fellow Texan Dan Rather; in addition, a 50+ CD of some of Cliburns solo piano recordings from the RCA catalogue.

Sigh. Those were the days. Since the legend of Cliburn at the 1958 Tchaikovsky competition was a favorite of my mothers (who, like Cliburns own mother, Rildia Bee, Laos the foundation for my love of music), I have always kept a special place in my collection for Cliburn playing the famous Russian warhorses. He was terrific. In the past 10 years, the label Testament has released the recording of the actual competition performances from April, 1958.

The highlights of the DVD for me were those snippets of Van Cliburn speaking about his life and music. Plus, the extended ending segment on his 1994 performance in Chicagos Grant Park Festival was very emotional for those of us Chicagoans.

The Accompanying CD also is a standout. If you grew up on the legend of the Tchaikovsky competition, you knew Van Cliburn mainly through his concerto performances. But this 52 minute CD of solo piano music is just exquisite.

A great package. Highly recommended",1518480000,,1643,4.85

8007509,5,B00017HWLM,"I was 16 when Van Cliburn first came on the music scene. My parents gave me his wonderful album from the Tchaikovsky competition, and before it came out on CD, I had worn through 8 record albums. No one plays Tchaikovsky or Rachmaninoff like Van Cliburn. In fact, no one plays anything like Mr. Cliburn. For me, he is the greatest concert pianist that ever lived. This was a wonderful DVD and I am so glad I purchased it.",1458086400,,421,4.341772151898734
8007510,5,B00017HWLM,"After viewing this DVD, we all agreed on one thing:  ""Thank Heaven for Van Cliburn.""  He is not only an outstanding virtuoso, but also an
extremely beautiful person.  The black and white DVD presents clear images, and the sound quality is superb, considering the fact that
this was made in the 1960's.  It is an amazing product.  Dan Rather's narration is clear and to the point.  Very well done.  We all feel
grateful that such a wonderful product exists.  We will be watching it again for the fourth time.",1451606400,,507,4.617977528089888
8007511,5,B00017HWLM,"Van Cliburn was very warm, friendly, and nice. Even despite his great fame and stardom, he also seemed pretty humble and normal. This comes across strongly in the DVD.

He had an incredible musicianship. The segments showing his playing are very good. I was really surprised how beautifully Van Cliburn played. Obviously, I knew he was very good, but this was the first time I got to see him play. He had very good tone and expression, was not just a bunch of notes.

There are extended interviews with Van Cliburn, and a lot of information about his life, including his close relationship with his mom, who was his first teacher, his teacher for many years, and stayed close to him until her death.

The DVD says nothing about the Van Cliburn piano competition, which initially surprised me. But it turns out it was apparently just named for Van Cliburn, he did not set it up, so it's no big deal.

He had a strong affinity for Russia, based on his great success in the 1958 International Tchaikovsky Competition, and that his teacher at Juilliard (Rosina Lhevinne) was from Russia. He helped bridge the gap between the US and USSR, showing at least a common appreciation for great art.

Oddly, the release date for the DVD was Feb 12, 2013, just a few days before Van Cliburn died of bone cancer.",1393027200,5,1298,4.6017316017316015

8007514,5,B00017HWLM,"The first disc presents an hour long documentary on Van Cliburn, while the second is a 52 minute recital of breath taking expressive and technical scope. The documentary is riveting from beginning to end, including many clips of Cliburn, plus a fair amount of big names revealing their feelings about him. Leontyne Price, Marilyn Horne and pianist Alexander Toradze to name just a few. It is the clips of Van Cliburn the pianist that make this DVD special, though. As one watches him create a marvelously singing tone in Liszt's first Mephisto Waltz, one is simultaneously mesmerized by his hands. This is one of several extended excerpts that further add to the documentary value of this release. The importance of Cliburn as a cultural diplomat who showed that the power of music is much stronger then over politics in the wake of his Moscow triumph of 1958 is also shown.  Cliburn played for every President of the United States in his lifetime since Eisenhower, a measure of the recognition accorded to his art. His nine year absence from the concert stage is mentioned, as is his eighteen city tour of the United States late in his life. The documentary is always gripping and one feels, at the end, deeply moved.

The complete works on disc 2 are:

1) Schumann-Liszt Widmung
2) Chopin Etude Op. 10 No. 3
3) Rachmaninoff Etude Tableau Op. 39 No. 5
4) Debussy L' lsle joyeuse
5) Brahms Intermezzo Op. 118 No. 2
6) Chopin Scherzo No. 3 Op. 39
7) Rachmaninoff Prelude in C Sharp Minor Op. 3 No. 2
8) Brahms Waltz Op. 39 No. 15
9) Liszt Mephisto Waltz

The second disc confirms the impressions we get of Van Cliburn after watching the documentary. Every single piece generates its own superlative, from the loving flow of Brahms' Op. 118 No. 2 to the impossibly beautiful Chopin Etude Op. 10 No. 3. Cliburn's huge tone is fully in evidence in the Rachmaninov Etude Tableau and contrasts superbly with his L lsle joyeuse. This Debussy is a marvelous invocation, and listening to Van Cliburn is like following a compellingly read story, so strong is his sense of narrative. This is a fascinating, riveting documentary complemented perfectly by a CD of the most magical piano playing.",1196899200,12,2182,4.734210526315789
8007515,4,B00017HWLM,"I remember Van Cliburn's Moscow triumph in 1958, and this modest and thoughtful documentary tribute to Cliburn strikes a harmonious note. The performance footage is super. Typical period Russian black and white film and some odd angles, but the playing is unforgettable, at times even moving. There are two long performance clips, not the whole pieces, but very generous cuts of Liszt's Mephisto Waltz and Chopin's Scherzo #3. There's a good deal of performance footage included. I had forgotten Cliburn's touch, and found myself reminded of Stephen Hough - a vivid roundness and intelligence, and playing that, if not profound, exhudes a surfeit of noble restraint that eluded many other pianists of Cliburn's generation. It's odd that the film never mentions the Van Cliburn International Piano Competition, celebrated as it is. Get this film to hear again Cliburn playing live, it's something special. Sound is superb, the footage mix is excellent throughout: interviews with musicians and friends (a nice bit from Leontyne Price who was at Julliard with Cliburn), performances, family interviews and footage. A quiet film, much like its legendary subject.",1182124800,15,1159,5.373626373626373
8007516,4,B00017HWLM,"The other reviewers says it all. This is a very good documentary of one of the greatest pianist in the world. It gives you detailed pictures of Van Cliburn's life since his childhood till he won the Tchaikovsky Competition and the years shortly after that, which is until about 1960s. Then it jumps about 25 years, to the late 1980s, and tells nothing about what he was doing in most of the 1960s, 70s, and 80s. Not much word about the famous Van Cliburn Competition either.

This is a great documentary, but not very satisfying as most unknown part of his life wasn't explained.",1149120000,6,579,4.5673076923076925
