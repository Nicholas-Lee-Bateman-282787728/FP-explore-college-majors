Yet, he was able to complete a massive canal that improved Moscow's water supply, as well as Moscow's impressive subway system. Viewers also see where the Communist elite lived - ironically, also the scene of terror under Stalin's bouts of paranoia.",1390608000,,372,5.016129032258065
8475374,5,B005J4N5TA,"Why is it that cruel 20th Century dictators share a deep-seated needed to pour concrete? From the start, Hitler and Stalin had future oriented --and monumentally ugly--  big city blue prints. And as I read history, this led to the Battle of Stalingrad. A battle fought not on a field but inside a big city, executed house to house, block by block and apartment floor to apartment floor.

Irony? The war of all against all destroys what you create..

This film is about the hopeful blue prints and Stalin's interest in making his plans concrete at all cost: reality be damned. Art and Dictation collide here. If Saint Petersburg was for the czar and Lenin, then Moscow in his image Stalin desired. This film examines that and why it failed.",1364860800,,739,4.6692307692307695
