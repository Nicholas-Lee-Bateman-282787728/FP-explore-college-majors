2796193,5,B000OI1G24,Fantastic drama. Good price and quick delivery.,1435017600,,47,5.857142857142857
2796194,5,B000OI1G24,"Excellent acting and extraordinarily good writing. First broadcast in the tense 1970s, when the UK was experiencing many of the same economic and ideological strains of post-WWI years, yet not a heavy-handed attack on capitalism of the sort common in pre-Thatcher Britain. Plenty of characters to admire or despise among workers and bosses both. Painfully grim episodes nevertheless have many flashes of humor. Character is the real star of the show, as in a Greek tragedy, though many of the players are superb, most notably James Bolam.

This series is intelligent and fair enough that a history course could built around it, yet emotionally engaging. Pity that it is so hard to find.",1425686400,6,686,5.070796460176991
2796195,5,B000OI1G24,"Loved this program since I first saw it when living in the north of England in the mid-seventies.  So excited now available on DVD with multi-region player....You can also catch James Bolam and Susan Jameson in the series, New Tricks.",1422748800,3,234,4.85
2796196,5,B000OI1G24,"This may be my favorite TV show of all time.  Great writing by James Mitchell, terrific acting by almost all, funny, gritty, realistic and most of all wonderful story-telling, set after 1919 with the ending of World War I, when soldiers came home to unemployment, starvation to the Tyneside of northern England, ""A land fit for heroes and idiots"" as the wags coined it.  James Bolam in his younger days had charisma to burn.  You won't believe how good this is!",1417132800,6,461,4.666666666666667

8185073,5,B000OI1G24,"Maybe the BBC' best drama series ever, certainly on a par with greats like I Claudius and Elizabeth R. Jack Ford returns the ship building and coal mining area of North East England following the end of World War One. Jack is out to make his fortune but how to do that in the class bound world of 1920's England. Jack can be ruthless but he has a soft spot for certain people including the Seatons a coal mining  family who take him in. One thing is sure however no matter who is in the room Jack is the cleverest person there. This series could also be shown to school children to show them what working class life was like in Britain between the wars.",1511568000,,653,4.224
8185074,5,B000OI1G24,"I was stationed in the UK when this series was running, one episode a week. Our whole family never missed an episode. Left the UK before the series ended. We all wished we could get copies of it in the USA. Will be buying the entire series. Other British series to watch is: Aufwiedershen Pet. Outstanding",1509753600,,305,4.464285714285714

8185081,5,B000OI1G24,"This is a great BBC series from the mid 1970s. I wish there were more seasons of it. It is realistic without being disturbing like ""Peaky Blinders."" It shows the poverty and hopelessness of growing up in a mining town in the north of England in the early part of the 20th century where one's prospects outside of going down the pit were virtually nil and the upper crusties just didn't give a tinker's dam. The hopelessness is tempered, however, with the depiction of a close and loving family life in spite of all the hardship.
I don't think people under 35 or 40 would be able to appreciate this series because it's not overly sexual or violent and it requires a sensibility that can enjoy subtleties and nuance and doesn't need to be hit over the head with its entertainment. It is not for the generation who grew up playing video games or watching movies with fast cutting every second or so. Also most people under the aforementioned age bracket would absolutely hate the opening/closing song that runs over the credits, which I absolutely love!",1439251200,10,1050,4.650537634408602
