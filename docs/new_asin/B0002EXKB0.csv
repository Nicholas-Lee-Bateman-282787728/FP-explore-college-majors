8027371,4,B0002EXKB0,"Lara and Georgi meet in a coffee shop. She is a beautiful stewardess, he is a reporter. They spend the night of passion followed by jealousy, suspicion and lust. They rarely meet because of their strange working hours and locations. He offends her with his distrust, so she makes up a story about her romance with a pilot. Georgi believes her lie and Lara is mortified that he would ever believe that she betrayed his love, even if she said so. They play games as if they have an eternity. But then Georgi finds out that her plane had an emergency landing...
This film is a remake of 1960's ""Eshe Raz Pro Lubov"" (Once More About Love). I still haven't made up my mind which film I like better. They both are great in their own ways. Renata Litvinova, who plays Lara, gives the film the beauty of her peculiar acting - it is probably the highlight of the movie. The way she talks and holds herself is so unique and attractive that you get glued to the screen. Most of the dialogue was kept from the original screenplay although it has been adapted to the new days & ways. It is a sad, perhaps a bit melodramatic, movie, but it is not a cheap make-me-cry chick flick.
It is one of the better films of the modern Russian cinematography. I would definitely recommend it.",1138060800,2,1266,4.391489361702128
