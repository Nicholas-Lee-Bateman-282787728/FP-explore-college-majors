2640458,1,B000HT37FY,good visual quality dvd but its a movie made by youngadults playin around w/ monsta filmmaking-even so theres not enough or good monsta action. its silly cuz its not a monstermovie; to bad they don't make it seem real or like a legend like the rest. the monsters head top is too flat and appears much later in the film. its a ridiculous waste that didn't have to be and again on such good film too. usually yull find a good movie on bad film quality. because of the above i didn't bother so far w/ any other details of the movie cuz im disappointed. i guess its a good price for .01$ .,1223424000,3,585,4.140350877192983

2640461,5,B000HT37FY,"This movie looks like a tribute to the early horror and sci-fi B-movies of Roger Corman, and it's just as much fun.  I love all of Chistopher Mihm's movies (including this one), and I especially like how all of his movies seem to be tied into each other to some extent or another, creating what fans call the ""Mihmniverse"".  If you like the cheesy old black-and-white horror/sci-fi movies of the past, then you will love this movie also.  (And all of Mihm's films.)",1514592000,,465,4.578313253012048

2640466,5,B000HT37FY,... but I say phooey on them! The Monster of Phantom Lake does far more than the films of Michael Moore and Morgan Spurlock to expose the dark underbelly of American society and the dangers posed by both the unregulated dumping of toxic waste and a lack of proper healthcare for our traumatized veterans. Remember this Paul Ryan and Scott Walker - the social programs you spare today will prevent the atomic sludge monsters of tomorrow!,1487462400,,436,4.75

2640469,5,B000HT37FY,"What a blast!  This was a great throwback to those good/bad monster movies from the 50's I loved to watch on my local UHF stations back in the 70's and 80's.  It harkens back to all those things I enjoy about those movies- silly monster, questionable science, and stock characters.  All those things are done to perfection in this movie.  It's never quite done with an obvious wink at the camera, but there are a number of moments throughout that let you know the cast and crew knows what their up to- no other 50's movie has a Ghostbusters reference in it.  It maybe could have done with a little bit of scene trimming, but it stands out as a wonderful homage to movies from a different time.  I'm looking forward to more movies from this crew.",1470700800,,745,4.401459854014599
2640470,4,B000HT37FY,It was a real gasss.  I enjoyed it.,1470355200,,35,3.375
2640471,2,B000HT37FY,This homage to 50s and 60s drive-in monsters is pretty lame. If it's trying to be funny then it fails.,1468713600,2,102,4.15
2640472,2,B000HT37FY,"Good intentioned but tedious homage to 1950's sci-fi films has too low of a budget to realistically recreate the look of those cheap B films--The Monster of Phantom Lake was obviously shot on video instead of film, which immediately destroys the illusion the filmmakers are trying to create.  There's also not much of an attempt to give the characters plausible 1950's style clothing and hairstyles.

None of this would matter as much if the movie was actually funny, but over the course of a very long 97 minutes there are only a few laughs.  You would be better off watching the hilarious (and far more authentic) The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra instead.",1466294400,,653,4.8125
2640473,5,B000HT37FY,"The first Mihm film.  Since the subsequent films have several ""running jokes"" and recurring characters, you don't want to miss this one.",1464393600,,136,5.181818181818182
2640474,4,B000HT37FY,"I bought this DVD after watching Chritopher Mihm's 'The Giant Spider,' which I thought was terrific. For whatever reason there were some negative reviews for that one and I've read that this movie was the one to get first.

I did enjoy 'The Monster of Phantom Lake' but being Christopher Mihm's first effort, I'm sure it didn't have the budget or the detail of his later episodes.

The movie begins with a couple of workers dumping toxic chemicals into a lake. There is a group of kids out in the woods near a lake who are having a late night party. There are 5 of them. One of the girls plays the 'fifth wheel.' Of course, she is the annoying one who just wants to go home. There is a scientist and his assistant also out on this very same evening. While at the campfire and telling stories we learn of a former soldier who killed his wife and was later released. This particular soldier enters the lake and becomes the 'monster of phantom lake.' The monster starts picking people off and it's up to our intrepid scientist and his assistant to figure out how to stop the monster.

Obviously this is all in fun as the purpose of this movie is to parody movies of similar plots form the 1950's. It does an admirable job and if you are a fan of 1950's sci-fi then you should enjoy this movie. If you have seen the movies that it is making fun of then you will enjoy the movie quite a bit more than if you haven't seen them.

The blooper reel was appreciated but you see a lot of the same stuff over and over again. There are two...each approximately 15 minutes long. One has 'foul' language the other does not.

I will be moving on to watch the remainder of Chritopher Mihm's movies in the order in which they were made.

This is recommended for all fans of 1950's sci-fi and fans of movie parodies in general.",1462147200,3,1808,4.31858407079646

2640476,5,B000HT37FY,"Love this movie! To the people giving one star reviews, what did you think you were gonna be watching after seeing the cover? Of course it's cheesy with poor acting and a Sesame Street looking monster, but that's the charm of it! Sit back and enjoy a good throwback movie!",1458000000,,272,4.46
2640477,3,B000HT37FY,Friend made it sound more entertaining than it was. Not my type of b movie. Campy and just hard to care about any of the characters.,1456704000,,132,4.115384615384615
2640478,3,B000HT37FY,"This film is enjoyable. It's obvious that this film took some inspiration from ""The Lost Skeketon of Cadavra."" That said, it's still worth watching.",1437523200,2,148,5.208333333333333
2640479,5,B000HT37FY,"Christopher R. Mihm's first feature film, made as a tribute to his dad who loved these films, ""The Monster of Phantom Lake"" succeeds as an homage to the sci-fi genre of the 1950s (and it's a monster musical, too, which would have made the late, great filmmaker Ray Dennis Steckler proud!) The film opens with very light 55-gallon drums of toxic waste being dumped in Phantom Lake: I have handled 55-gallon drums, and in reality they require a forklift to move, but hey, the suspension of disbelief has to start somewhere! The film captures the essence of old science fiction very well on a way lower budget than Larry Blamire. I particularly loved the science babble about algae and eight-legged frogs (which are clearly plastic.) I laughed out loud at the stock footage of the deer which reminded me of the ornamental quail footage in ""Invasion of the Space Preachers,"" but that paled in comparison to my reaction to seeing the scaly bucket-headed titular monster the first time. Mihm created an absolutely great creature for his initial outing.

There are a lot of extras on the DVD, including a commentary of variable quality (some is interesting, some is boring, but I'm sure that commenting on your own work is an acquired skill,) a painful introduction from Dr. Ivan Cryptosis (a running feature in the later Mihmverse films, which I now routinely skip,) and a blooper reel that needs to be severely edited down as it becomes tedious very quickly. Despite the drawbacks in the extras department, the film is a very good first effort that is quite faithful to the original spirit of the genre. Any lover of 1950s B-movies should enjoy this film, and I am grateful Mihm has continued to make these little independent gems.",1424822400,7,1726,4.811447811447811
2640480,5,B000HT37FY,"Love this movie.  I can picture myself as one of these teenagers, camping out on a summer night telling scary stories.  Love the fifties clothing and the music.  The attraction between Prof. Jackson and luscious Stephanie made a good story line.  The corny
acting was funny and the huge googly eyes of the monster were ridiculous, yet laughable.  One of my favorites.",1402272000,,367,4.854838709677419
2640481,3,B000HT37FY,"The real thing, of course, would be an early '50s Roger Corman stinker. Young actors today, especially the women, just do not seem to ""get"" the '50s personae down correctly. They should study the ""work"" of Faith Domergue, Barbara Rush, Ann Robinson, Marie Windsor and other similar queens of the larger studios' '50s science fiction and horror schlock. You have to be deadly sincere and deadly serious; no hint that you know it's all low camp! Today's men are little better -- but this flick comes closer than most to looking like a seriously bad movie.",1397347200,4,553,4.770833333333333
2640482,2,B000HT37FY,This has some of the worse acting I have ever seen or heard. At least the picture and sound is good not that it helps in watching the movie.,1367971200,2,140,3.8620689655172415

2640485,5,B000HT37FY,I first saw this movie in the privacy of my own home and thought it was amazing.  Loving b-movies of the 1950's and 1960's I felt that this was a fun homage to the movies of that era.  I do have to say though that I went to see a showing of this movie in a theater full of people and the energy was through the roof.  I do recommend you get some friends together that get these movies and just enjoy the cheese factor.  It is not made to be a comedy but none of the horror movies of that era were.  That doesn't mean that they aren't a hoot now.  You will enjoy this one.  It is so bad it is good.,1328140800,,597,3.7661290322580645

2640487,5,B000HT37FY,"If you enjoy cheesy 1950's ""B"" creature features, then this film is for you.
This movie is a lot of fun, though it would have been even more fun if it had actually been
filmed in Mukwonago WI at the real Phantom Lake.  Other than that minor detail
I can't really fault this movie.  The dialog is funny with great silly names for scientific equipment.
Strongly recommended for all. The audio and video quality is very good. Although, I had to use my
back up player to play it. The disk had some problems of the type where everything freezes up
and then goes back to the beginning of the disk and starts over.",1269648000,7,607,4.315789473684211
2640488,5,B000HT37FY,"This is one of my most favorite movies ever.  It is both a parody and homage at the same time, something few ""comedy"" type movies can say.

It is a spoof of science fiction and horror movies of the 1950s, shot in a way that directly recalls those classic films of the bygone era.

After atomic waste is dumped into the serene waters of the lake, two groups come together: a group of recently-graduated teenagers looking for fun in the woods, and a science professor and his assistant, who are in the area to perform ... science.

When a wayward soul stumbles upon the atomic waste-filled waters and is transformed into the monster, it is up to Professor Jackson to save the day.  But can he? Does he possess the scientific knowledge that will allow the teenagers to escape, or are they doomed to be hugged to death?

And just what are two supposed police officers doing while they patrol the lake? Are they officers of the law, or something more sinister?

Find out the answers to these questions and more in Monster of Phantom Lake!

And when you're done, look for the sequels. As of this writing, there are three more in the series: It Came From Another World, Cave Women on Mars (set in the far off futuristic world of 1980), and Terror From Beneath the Earth.

And if you're wondering, Cave Women is my favorite so far.

Each of the films is sprinkled with references to other sci fi movies, tv shows, and books. Some of the references may be too subtle for the average viewer upon first watching, but see just how many references you can spot.",1235865600,6,1548,4.476868327402135

The repetitious hammering home of the memes for comic effect just made it drag sometimes, but not for long. If you like this type of film, and you know what you're getting yourself into in advance if you do, then you won't be disappointed.
