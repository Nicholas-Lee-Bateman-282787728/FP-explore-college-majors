5037510,5,B006YTGL8Q,"My 3 year old is in an Angelina Ballerina ballet class and they dance to the ""Be A Star"" song found in this dvd/cd combo. I initially bought this combo set because of this 30 second song (yes it is only 30 seconds!) but I knew she'd get a kick out of it. She absolutely loves the CD and requests we play the music when we're in the car. The videos are wonderful as well, complementing each other on the whole ""star"" theme. You can't beat the price for 3 dvds and an audio cd. Just an FYI, the audio cd has a little over 3 minutes of music total (4 songs, 2 are about a minute long and 2 are about 30 seconds).",1351987200,2,609,3.9193548387096775
5037511,4,B006YTGL8Q,"This is a great collection of three Angelina Ballerina DVDs with great bonus content and music CD.  While we have seen all the DVDs and their episodes separately this would be a nice set for a someone just getting into Angelina.  Wholesome lessons and fun characters.  Also, if you buy this as a gift for someone it is possible they may have one of the DVDs so you may want to check.",1338768000,,383,4.291666666666667
5037512,5,B006YTGL8Q,"This is the ultimate Angelina Ballerina Collection! If you have enjoyed the DVD's in the past or if you have just enjoyed the Angelina Ballerina stories, you and your children will love these DVD's. The collection of great episodes will make your kids come back for more Angelina over and over (at least it did for my own girls). My daughters also loved the bonus features that were on these DVD's, especially the Taken Show Trivia Game. I can now say that I am feeling like an Angelina Ballerina Expert in regards to the trivia now that we have played this over and over! I highly recommend this set for one and all, you will not be disappointed in the quality or the collection!",1333238400,,680,4.491935483870968
5037513,5,B006YTGL8Q,This is sure a Great and Amazing Dvd set with 3 Dvds that have Great and Amazing Stories! 1 is The very first Dvd Movie of Angelina based on the Awesome New Series where she helps her Friends discover their Special Talents for The Big Talent show. The 2nd is Pop Star Girls Featuring Amazing Stories of Angelina with Great Music and Dancing on Ice which also has Great Stories as well. This Dvd Collection is Highly Recommended!!,1332892800,5,429,4.512820512820513

5037516,5,B006YTGL8Q,Angelina is the only show that our 16 month old grandchild will sit still to watch. I sat her down in front of the cat in the hat recently and she would have no part of it! Now she watches when she tired and when she gets her second wind she's up dancing and twirling.,1398211200,,268,3.890909090909091
5037517,5,B006YTGL8Q,"in watching other videos, some would have a preview of an Angelina Ballerina video and since my granddaughter is taking dance she would be glued when they came on. ""i like"" she would tell me. so i got on amazon and sifted through the videos they had and this one got such good reviews and 3 for the price was terrific. indeed my granddaughter loves watching and acting out the dances. couldn't be happier",1394323200,2,404,4.472972972972973
5037518,5,B006YTGL8Q,"Good set of DVD's as a gift or simply to add to your Angelina collection. Be forewarned, the DVD's are held on one spindle inside the case so you will need to remove the first two in order to get to the third one on the bottom.
