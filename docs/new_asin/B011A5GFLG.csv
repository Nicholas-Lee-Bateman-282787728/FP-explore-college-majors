8723945,2,B011A5GFLG,"Rameau's Indes Galantes [The amorious Indies] is a ballet-opera, where the dancing is more important then the singing. My wife, a ballet dancer and teacher, who is familiar with the name and good reputation of Laura Scozzi as choreographer of other Rameau and Offenbach works, expected similarly excellent job from Scozzi, who was for this work the director & choreographer. Also, Roger Pines, a known reviewer at Opera News and at Lyric Opera News wrote about the DVD as ""staging serves the piece with considerable imagination and charm"". Well, the DVD produced in Bordeaux was a total failure as far as ""charm"" and ""imagination"" and even choreography concerned.

Having her first ""stage directorship"", Ms. Scozzi converted the work with her views of contemporary political problems: immigration and drug smuggling. For the Prologue, when Rameau  has the gods of love and of war discuss their disagreement,  loosely organized people ran around the stage, rolled on the floor and over each others for 15 long minutes, not dancing just displaying their private parts [front and rear] toward the audience. There was nothing ""charming"" or even sexy in this, rather showing the ugliness of some human bodies. Perhaps a better selection for the displayed people would have improve the situation, but who knows what's available in Bordeaux.

In the first two Tableaus, instead of filling up the musics of Rameau with dances, Ms. Scozzi used three unpleasant and unkept characters, supposedly Cupids, jumping and running around in the foreground, totally unconnected from anything else on the stage.  The nice dance musics were not used for dancing as Rameau composed the piece, which is a shame. The First Tableau was placed, instead of Osman Pascha's court, where dancing was to be performed, onto the shore of Turkey where a smuggler operated bringing in immigrants. Somehow even the beautiful singing was not in the right surroundings. The Second Tableau was even worst. It was played in Peru, at an outpost of a drug smuggler, who unwashed and dirty, practically raped a woman on stage, until finally a helicopter brought in soldiers to save her. Quite unpleasant to see this, while listening to the beauty of Baroque music. The last two Tableaus I cannot describes, because I just turned off the TV - we had enough.

So consider the aboves and if you think this is interesting, do go and buy the DVD. Chaque-on a son gout!",1452643200,18,2421,5.024937655860349
8723946,5,B011A5GFLG,"In one of my favourite scenes in the 1942 film Holiday Inn Bing Crosby conducts a small orchestra to accompany Fred Astaire and Marjorie Reynolds, each in elaborate 18th century attire, as they start a dance from some imagined version of Versailles. Bing sabotages the show by having his musicians break into jazzy riffs just when the dancers are getting in to the period feel. The two styles juxtaposed are much more interesting than either on its own. The results, besides being very funny, are surprisingly musical.

Until fairly recently we were well in to a period of graceless, static, un-musical stagings of works by the great 17th and 18th century masters, as academics brought complex historically-informed performance practices to bear on the opera and ballet stage. Now, as people let their hair down a bit, we can all loosen up, let the musicians swing, and have some fun. This is obviously happening with everyone involved in this production of one of the great works of the French Baroque, Rameaus Les Indes Galantes. This remix, whose primary author is Director and Choreographer Laura Scozzi, is anything but subtle. This becomes clear in the Prologue, where nudity plays the same role it did in the 1968 musical Hair: to represent the natural world, honesty and freedom. This is great, dumb, fun. After this good-natured romp, the very attractive principals (who are luckily all excellent singers, and, mainly, fine actors) present four separate tableaux set in various parts of the world. This pastiche of 18th and 21st century world views takes on darker hues as Scozzi teases out surprisingly poignant themes related to the various plights of refugees, the natural world, women and aboriginal peoples, without doing any real damage to Rameaus, and his librettists, original ideas.

Both the anarchic fun and the serious undercurrents are mirrored, and enhanced, by the superb orchestral and choral forces of Les Talens Lyriques marshalled by Christophe Rousset. The music itself brings as much joy and powerful emotions as the funny stage business and ripped-from-the-headlines drama. Bravo Maestros Rousset and Scozzi, and especially Maestro Rameau!",1443830400,9,2170,5.214899713467049
8723947,4,B011A5GFLG,"Jean-Phillippe Rameau (1683 -- 1764) remains perhaps the most under-appreciated of the great composers even though his music and the music of the French Baroque have surged in popularity in recent years.  Rameau composed his opera-ballet ""Les Indes Gallantes"" in 1735 and revised the work several times thereafter to fit his own conception of the piece and the needs of his audience. The version presented in this DVD uses a score Rameau prepared for presentation in Toulouse in 1750.  The work fell into obscurity upon Rameau's death and was not revived until the 20th century. There are several recorded performances this work now available together with performances of Rameau's other music.

The performance on this DVD dates from February, 2014 with French Baroque specialist Christophe Rousett conducting Les Talens Lyriques in a period musical performance with a large cast of soloists, singers, and dancers, including the chorus of the National Opera of Bordeaux. The theme of the work is the nature and universality of love. The work's title translates as ""The Amorous Indies"" with the ""Indies"" referring to exotic places far from Europe. The work is in five sections.  It opens with a Prologue in which, after a contest between War and Love, amourous Euiropeans travel abroad to find their own lives.  The remaining sections are set in Turkey, Peru, Persia, and North America. Each section shows the foibles of the heart, jealousy, and the search for love.  There is a little story told in song and surrounded by lavish orchestral writing and dancing.  The tone throughout the work is one of lightness and of a seeming frivolity which is serious in its celebration of passion.

Rameau's music in this DVD is beautifully served and  performed.  The orchestra and Rousset have this music in their hearts and the singing is lovely.  The various settings are appropriately lavish and exotic and a pleasure to see. As a musical experience, this is a lovely production of Rameau.

Rameau freely changed the setting of this work to meet his performance needs, and it is meaningless to look for an ""authentic"" means of staging the opera-ballet.  Director Laura Scozzi has chosen to combine some highly contemporary elements with the exotic elements of the setting. Thus in her setting, there are modern, vulgar tourists travelling through the scenes, contemporary advertisements, and 21st century social themes, including feminism, drug use, smuggling, and environmentalism. Most of the characters are dressed in modern garb, and in the Prelude and conclusion, the characters are not dressed at all but are fully nude.

The setting is a mixed success.  I liked the nudity and thought it appropriate to the work. And much of the scenery and settings add interest to the ongoing slightness of the story. However, the settings, as explained in Scozzi's interview included in the liner notes, have a didactic, political tone. They tend to present modern issues or, rather, Scozzi's view of these issues. In so doing, the presentation distracts from Rameau's music and dance and from Rameau's own focus on entertaining and on showing the universality of love and its foibles. The problem is not in the modernistic dress but in the politicization which, in my opinion, often is contrary to the spirit of the work. Some of those present at the live performance apparently agreed as an undertone of boos is detectable during the curtain calls.

It would be unfair to reject this performance given the beautiful music, orchestral playing, singing, and some of the staging. But the political themes added to the presentation took away from the production. Some viewers will find the direction of the production more out of place than will others. I loved the music and performance, but music lovers with an understandable aversion to anachronism and to political correctness should know what they are getting into in this DVD.  The production is sung in French with subtitles in English, German, or French. The DVD is a product of Alpha Classics and distributed by Naxos.  Naxos kindly sent me a review copy.

8723948,2,B011A5GFLG,"Musically, this DVD of Rameaus famous opera is quite good. Maestro Rousset and his top notch ensemble, Les Talens Lyriques, successfully elucidate and invigorate the various elements that make up this marvelous work. The playing is exuberant and stylish. Incidentally, in his accompanying essay, Maestro Roussett lays out a compelling case as to why he opted for the somewhat altered Toulouse edition of 1750. The phantasmagorical libretto is of no real consequence. Rameaus inspired and masterful writing is the sole reason that this work has endured for centuries. The contribution of the soloists and chorus is likewise of a very high order. Which leaves the conception/direction. The adoption of contemporary dress/mores or the complete absence of it in some instances, is ill advised. It comes across as sophomoric and self-indulgent. Its employment adds nothing to Rameaus grand vision. So the choices come down to Christie and Les Arts Florissants on Opus Arte or any of several superb audio only renditions on Harmonia Mundi, Erato, etc.",1443139200,11,1045,5.33939393939394
