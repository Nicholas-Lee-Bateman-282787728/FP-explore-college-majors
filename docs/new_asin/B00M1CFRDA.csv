6546262,5,B00M1CFRDA,Falcon Rising starring Michael Jai White was very well done.  It never goes over the top with special effects and stays rooted on the development of the main character's (Falcon's) presence and story. This aspect added tons of depth and pushes the movie beyond merely being just a simple action title. Michael Jai White knows a vast array of Martial Arts disciplines and he translates them to the movie screen with much finesse and flair.  Performing his own stunts makes the fight scenes extremely fluid and convincing.  This was most important during the multi-adversary fights.  The plot never falls dull and it's implemented so well that you're only wishing they would delve even deeper.  Near the end of the movie I began to realize that they took this direction in story to prop Falcon Rising up as a series of movies.  I look forward to the following movies in this series.  Definitely check this movie out.  Another hit by MJW!,1409961600,18,935,4.8

6546291,4,B00M1CFRDA,"This is a great little action movie that popped up out of nowhere, starring the brilliant Michael Jai White who is a very talented man when it comes to kicking butt, his martial art skills are pretty sensational and are second to none in this movie, He plays an ex-soldier suffering from post traumatic stress disorder, living on the edge he is close to suicide, when his sister is brutally attacked while on assignment in Brazil he flies into Sao Paulo to track down her assailants, quickly entering the city's seedy underbelly and discovering a world of drugs, the sex trade, corrupt cops, and organized crime syndicates battling for control. The action scenes are great in this movie, it starts a tad slow with the story building up, we get some cool shoot-outs etc and towards the end the real action kicks in and we have some spectacular fight scenes and a brilliant martial arts performance from White, for a small budget movie it goes along way with a great cast all round, nice locations and quality choreography on the fights. I think White's character has good potential to return for a sequel, lets hope to see the Falcon again soon!

6546296,5,B00M1CFRDA,"Falcon Rising is an action adventure film featuring Michael J. White (John Falcon Chapman), Neil McDonough, and Laila Ali.

It tells a story of a former U.S. marine with PTSD who travels to Rio De Janeiro, Brazil to care for his sister who had been attacked while working to help the poor in the favelas.

In the process, he discovers an elaborate criminal scheme involving Japanese criminal gangs and corrupt local authorities. ... Katarina Nolte",1428796800,,447,4.946666666666666
6546297,3,B00M1CFRDA,It's a shame Hollywood hasn't taken noticed to a fabulous Martial Artist like Micheal Jai White.  There are plenty of rolls he could have played when they need a REAL BAD ASS BROTHA!!! I though he would be perfect as Tony Starks/IRON-MAN right hand man Brody/WAR-MACHINE.  This guy has a real deal Martial Arts background and boy oh boy does he stay fit. Unlike some Hollywood action stars this cat can really throw down.  And he's got tournament trophies to prove it.  Anyway the movie was ok. Action was decent and acting was ok? Maybe a bit off at times.  Blood and Bone was much better.  Still this is a B movie with B movie acting and directing.,1428796800,,650,4.466101694915254

6546300,4,B00M1CFRDA,"Corrupt cops?  In Rio?  Say it ain't SO!  Falcon Rising gives Michael Jai White a great vehicle to strut his stuff.  White, as John Chapman is in Rio investigating the near death of his sister Cindy (Laila Ali).

Aided by his wartime Marine buddy Vice Consul, Manny Ridley (Neal McDonough), Chapman roots through the 'favelo' of Rio to learn the secrets as to why his sister's life was at risk.  If we are to believe the movie, Rio has the largest group of Japanese outside Japan.  Given that and the less than savory side if the city including  human trafficking, organized crime can't be far away.  In this case it's the Yakuza.

For a movie supposedly set in Rio there sure was a lot of English spoken between the Brazilians.  But what the heck.  There was a lot of good old fashioned butt kicking.",1427846400,,801,4.486111111111111

6546313,4,B00M1CFRDA,"I believe that a good-sized fraction of Michael Jai White's fan base wouldn't mind if he dropped his work in drama and television and became purely an action movie actor. I'm among this crowd, but then again, it's probably for the best, because when Mike gets the chance to pick his vehicles carefully and recharge his batteries at intervals, the results tend to be good. ""Falcon Rising"" carries a lot of expectations as an action spectacle and manages to be soundly good, sans a couple disappointments, though none so great that they should keep you from checking it out.

The story: an ex-marine (White,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Undisputed-II/dp/B000K7UC2Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Undisputed II</a>) travels to Brazil to investigate the attempted murder of his sister (Laila Ali, host of ""American Gladiators"") in Rio de Janeiro's drug- and slavery-ridden underbelly.

Director Ernie Barbarash has always been a good filmmaker, with an eye for nice screenplays and the apparent ability to make the most out of direct-to-video resources. These talents are well-represented here, because not only is the plot intelligible, the movie's also fun to look at. San Juan substitutes for Rio, but the setting's fully brought to life via excellent production design and cinematography. Save for a few unwelcome (albeit justified) flashback insertions, Barbarash surpasses the DTV style and makes this one look as good as any blockbuster. Story-wise, the picture excels by keeping its narrative simple but the characters relatively complex: I was a particular fan of Jimmy Navarro (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Kiss-You-Gave-Me/dp/B00005RY9Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Kiss You Gave Me</a>) as the frontline villain, who - like many players here - is written with enough moral ambiguity that his actions managed to surprise me more than once throughout the movie. Neal McDonough (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Minority-Report/dp/B0035WTJFW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Minority Report</a>) has a pretty big role as White's onscreen comrade but doesn't get in on any of the action.

The one field wherein director Ernie hadn't impressed me before now was concerning action; I wasn't very pleased by his previous work with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jean-Claude-Van-Damme/dp/B00596WEVI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jean-Claude Van Damme</a>&nbsp;in that regard. However, whether he's learned from his mistakes or simply benefits from having a new action hero in the lead, ""Falcon Rising"" breaks the mold. One of the current ""it"" guys in karate cinema, Michael White meets high expectations bravely, and his two fights against groups of thugs stand out in particular for his athleticism and the exciting choreography of Larnell Stovall. However, the brawls fall short of at least some prospects, given that they incorporate the talents of not only White and Stovall, but also capoeira exponent Lateef Crowder. For those who don't know, Stovall and Crowder were integral factors of the benchmark feature&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Undisputed-III-Redemption/dp/B003FXXNH6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Undisputed III: Redemption</a>, and the thought of them joining forces again for a film that promised the inevitable Michael vs. Lateef showdown had me salivating. Well, the showdown does happen -as part of a larger randori that involves Jimmy Navarro and Yakuza lord Masashi Odate (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Last-Samurai/dp/B000JUB7LW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Last Samurai</a>) - and while decent, it's not the showstopper that I wanted it to be. Had it been, this one would've been afforded a perfect rating.

But even as it is, the movie's way above average and deserves to be seen by White's fans and general action junkies alike. From a social perspective, I'm disappointed that a film addressing sexual slavery as a central theme doesn't present any applicable means of intervening in these crimes (on a side note, I encourage all readers to take some part in protecting international human rights), but as pure entertainment, this was one of the better lower-budget efforts of 2014. Consider it a rental at the very least, but established fans of anybody involved should feel safe in purchasing it right away.",1422316800,2,4489,6.235483870967742
6546314,3,B00M1CFRDA,"This is a guilty pleasure movie. Michael Jai White is kind of like another JCVD and this series is going to be his thing. When the movie started with MJW drinking a shot with bullets in it and then playing Russian Roulette with himself, I knew this was going to be some crazy stuff. High quality? Nope, but entertaining all the same. MJW is a former soldier who has seen All The Bad Things and now he has bad PTSD. His sister who is a volunteer in Brazil's worst neighborhood, The Flavela, is attacked. MJW heads to Brazil to see who's done it and get justice. From there, it's a somewhat violent romp through Brazil with Capoiera, guns, bad guys, good guys, and corruption.

MJW is a jacked up and entertaining actor. He plays tortured really well and dramatically. I'm completely looking forward to the next installment in this movie. Really, this first film was a setup for the series. Sort of a ""how Falcon got into this shadowy government gig"". So, watch it if you're an MJW fan and think you'll be into the series. It's worth 98 or 100 minutes or whatever.",1421280000,3,1062,4.474226804123711

Not much in the way of meaningful dialog, plot, etc. which killed the entertainment value. There's no build-up to the fight scenes. After a while we just find ourselves waiting for the next (almost predictable) fight.

6546355,4,B00M1CFRDA,"****CONTAINS GENERIC PLOT SPOILERS****

Johnny Chapman (Michael Jai White) is a PTSD vet who is off his meds. He is suicidal, but works out just in case. He lives in NYC and is visited by his sister Cindy (Laila Ali) who pops in from Brazil so they can go to dinner together, and then back she goes.

Cindy is a volunteer worker who gets bludgeoned in Brazil. Chapman (aka Falcon) now has a reason to live as he goes after the bad guys in Rio, a city that has great stock footage scenery, but has most of the action take place in a small section of the slums. In spite of that, it was a welcomed change from the Mideast and Bulgaria. At this point the film goes super formula as we add elements of Patrick Swayze, Charles Bronson, child prostitution ring (hasn't been done enough yet) crooked cops, and yes the Yakuza who sneak up on armed people, brandishing a sword and while yelling. Won't tell you how that works out.

My biggest shock was that Neal McDonough as an actual good guy and not the Chechen ""Albino Assassin."" How did they miss that? Maybe in the next one as this appears to be the first in a series of films...depending on profits. Good formula writing for those who like the vigilante thing.

Parental Guidance: No sex or nudity. No F-bombs that I recall. Some adult themes and  language (punta) most of which was in Portuguese.",1411084800,3,1345,4.42914979757085

6546360,2,B00M1CFRDA,I love Michael Jai White and his movies but this was one of his weakest movies. The story line was weak and the fighting scenes sucked. I thought the fight between him and Lateef Crowder would have been a great fight scene. Instead it was straight one sided and boring. Lateef did nothing!! The reviews for this movie got me hyped up for nothing. Oh and what was Laila Ali casted for ???? Smh,1410566400,,392,4.3108108108108105

6546379,5,B00M1CFRDA,"Falcon Rising is an 80's style action movie with modern production esthetics and breath taking fight choreography. Michael Jai White stars as a self destructive ex-military operative whose only reason to live is to find those responsible for the viscious assault on his sister. White is a living CGI reel, performing some of the most eye popping stunts imaginable. You don't have to worry about shaky cams or other cinematic tricks to hide the actor's flaws. Lateef Crowder leads the supporting cast of experts who don't don't need it. The gorgeous Laila Ali and veteran actor Neal McDonough round things out.
