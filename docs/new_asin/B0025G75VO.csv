Film = three (3) stars; restoration/preservation = three (3) stars; cinematography/lighting = three (3) stars; score = three (3) stars.  Director Mikio Naruse's initial examination (he would repeat this in later films) of the exploitation of women through marriage.  The plotline concerns a young women who relocates from Tokyo to a less-than-desirable Osaka suburb seeking post-war economic security by marrying a salary man who seems incapable of differentiating his wife from a servant.  Finally, the wife flees back to her well-off family (in Tokyo), but eventually returns to her domestic drudgery.  In the midst of this mundane circular soap opera, Naruse throws in scenes showing women working in various professions.  The Director seems to be making the point that housewife exploitation can be mitigated/avoided, since these women are finding at least some economic security outside of marriage even in the (then) current economic climate.  Naruse also uses voice-over narrative at the start and end of film to underline the situation for audience members who may be slow on the uptake!  A number of veteran actresses and actors appear in the film including Setsuko Hara (playing the wife) and Haruko Sugimura (in the role of her mother).  The mostly seasoned cast is well directed.  Cinematography (narrow-screen, black and white) includes a fair number of tracking shots.  Lighting is a bit inconsistent with many scenes starting off poorly lit.  Score is good with music smoothly and effectively deployed through the movie.  Restoration missed many/most artifacts stemming from poor splicing between the original reels.  Subtitles are close enough.  Mildly entertaining, innocuous Toho programmer.  WILLIAM FLANIGAN PhD.",1512345600,,1868,5.530035335689046
8351038,5,B0025G75VO,"Naruse, Mikio:  One of the neglected masters of Japanese motion pictures.  Unfortunately, the powers that be have seen fit to make only one or two of his films available in DVD in this country.  THESE ARE NOT PLAYABLE ON ALMOST ALL USA DVD'S.  Be forwarned.

Repast, is the weakest.  Verging on melodrama.  And I love, Hara, Setsuko.

Sound From the Mountain (known various other titles) Is a masterpiece.  Setsuko Hara, Ken again and his father, whom Setsuko's character forms a non-erotic loving relationship with when her husband, is unfaithful.  (I don't see why.)  The ending has some similarities to that of ""The Third Man.""

Flowing is another masterpiece, but one of ensemble acting.  Tanaka is the observing presence: as a geisha house, and the traditions that support it, fade and fall away.  Subtle without melodrama and tear-jearking.  But you may cry anyway.

When will the powers that be realize that there is a US market for DVD films of Mikio Naruse?",1242259200,9,966,4.906832298136646
