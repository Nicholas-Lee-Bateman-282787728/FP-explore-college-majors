2347557,5,B000A0GYC8,"It wasn't just that I adored Pippi as a child - I wanted to BE Pippi. These movies were my absolute favorites. I have the pretty-bad-quality VHS versions, and was secretly hoping that DVDs would one day be available. Thank goodness they now are.

The Adventures of Pippi Longstocking define my idea of what childhood should be like - carefree, adventurous and bit mischievious. The movies do a great job of capturing the essence of the books and really bring Pippi and her adventures to glorious life.",1161820800,11,501,4.758620689655173
2347558,5,B000A0GYC8,"OH MY GOODNESS!!!! this is the 4 box DVD set that I have been looking for!!!!! THANK YOU!!!!

 I was swayed a little and confused by the reviews that people left here about the 4 DVD Pipi Collection vs the TV Series DVD so I bought both the 4 DVD set & the TV series DVD to be sure that I was getting what I was looking for and to hopefully leave a more clearer review. When looking for this I also discovered that many people have there own generation of the Pippi that was theirs.

 I was looking for the one from when I was a little youth born in 1975 and grew up on Vancouver Island and enjoyed Pipi most of my life. I wanted to bring back those ""oh so dear to my heart"" childhood memories of Pipi... and this is IT!!!! This is the boxed set you are looking for if your memories are from around the dates of my childhood neck of the woods.

 The ""TV Series DVD"" to me was disappointing. They did change Annika to Anna and the children were not as joyful in the dubbing and the dialogue is certainly different. You are watching the same images but, you do get another storyline perspective of Pipi. As well, the images are pieced together differently to produce a different story that way too.

One Example:

4 DVD Box set

 When Tommy and Annika come to give Pippi the candy box she gives them gifts too. A Harmonica and a ball.

TV Series DVD

Pipi is looking for her bag of gold gives Tommy a pocket knife (which kinda shocked me) and Annika a hair comb, I think it was.

 You do learn different things about Pippi that you would not have otherwise known from the TV Series DVD as opposed to the  box set, but it's nothing necessary to know, it is not money needed to be spent...unless you have it to spend and would like to give it a try. But honestly, the TV series DVD has been viewed once and is collecting dust on my shelf and does not have the same joy to me as the one I grew up with.

 The 4 DVD Boxed set is definately the English dubbed Pipi I remember in all it's Glory!!! Right down to the infectious roarous children's' laughter of Annika and Tommy with Pippi and Pipi's lovable, ""flirt with danger"" ""bold, sly, cheeky, happy voice of ""who me? innoncence"" to the nostalgic soundtrack scratch (that I guess is what could be what is being misinterpreted as smoking voices) *shrug*  I do think though that Pipi's big burley papa could have sounded this way, I guess...but, I just thought that it was cuz he was her big strong "" Captain of the South Seas"" papa *GRIN*

This Pippi was definately the Pippi that every child in my time wanted to be with or even BE! Hope this helps! And if you have any questions don't hesitate to ask I will help you if I can. Joy to you and YOUR Pipi memories *smile*",1153526400,97,2714,4.184615384615385
2347559,5,B000A0GYC8,I loved Pipi and her big adventures with her friends but it seems many people say the voices on these dvds aren't the same as when they showed them on tv.  To me that is too bad cause I can disticntly remember there voices.  I think the big reason for that is that there weren't any big hollywood special effects just high adventure and lot's of fun.  I know my kids will enjoy them for years to come. I just hope they sound like kids having fun and not like a cigarette smoking granny.,1144713600,2,486,4.148936170212766
2347560,5,B000A0GYC8,"Because that's the way they do it in Egypt, you know!

I love these movies so much!  I had all four taped from television a long time ago, but they were horrible quality.  So, to have them all on DVD is really great.  I don't know what people are talking about when they say the voices are wrong or sound like they were done by ""smoking adults"", they're exactly as I remember them.  It might have been nice to see these in the original Swedish, but as I've never seen them in Swedish, I don't miss it.

If you've been looking for the Pippi Longstocking movies in all their wonderful English dubbed glory, this box set is a definite must have.",1142640000,11,642,4.264462809917355
2347561,4,B000A0GYC8,"There seems to be some confusion about the Pippi movies.

The swedish 13 episodes TV-series was made in 1969. In the following years there were two theatrical movies made:
""Pippi Lngstrump p de sju haven"" (P L on the seven seas, my transl.) and "" P rymmen med Pippi Lngstrump"" (On the run with P L, my transl.)

That is all that was made with the same cast.

In the mid '70s, some scenes from TV was patched together for a third theatrical movie for Sweden.

According to IMDB, the two movies where chopped into another 8 tv episodes for Germany, thus a total of 21. To my knowledge, this was never shown on swedish TV.

The four ""American"" movies included in this set are certainly  the two original theatrical movies (If there are any difference, it is not likely to me that it would be more than some editing), most likely the patch-movie (some editing?). The 4th movie in this set (Goes on board) has never been shown in Sweden to my knowledge, but it cant be anything but more scenes from tv. The name of the last TV episode was ""goes on board"", so that or parts of that one are obviously included.

The first Pippi movie was made in 1949. It was called ""Pippi Lngstrump"" (her name in swedish) I have not seen it, nobody liked it when it was new, and it seems to have vanished since then. They messed it up, the girl playing Pippi was 26, and they added things they thought would bring an older audience.

Then there is the american movie from the '80s and the animated '90s version.

The original TV series and the two movies are available here in sweden on region 2 PAL dvd's

This was just my attempt to set things straight, hope it was helpful to you. I have not seen the dvd set you Yanks have, so I cant say anything about that.",1133308800,15,1739,4.290519877675841
2347562,5,B000A0GYC8,"Ive read all the reviews, and I still do not understand why people do not enjoy the real essence about seeing Pippi again. Forget the voices, the dubbing, just go back to those days full of Pippi's adventures.

  I just bought these, and I haven't stopped watching them. I highly recommend this collection to those who still are kids in their hearts.",1129680000,14,350,4.612903225806452
2347563,5,B000A0GYC8,"On those lonely Saturdays when it was raining outside in Southern California what was a girl to look forward too, during the 1970's, before Flash Dance and Fame? We had no Internet, or cable! What was better than all of that? A Saturday of the Family Film Festival and Pippi! What a treat to finally be able to own this DVD! I disagree with the dubbing of the voices. I have watched it dubbed and still, I love it! Furthermore, it is not scary, it is unique, and as an adult who watch all foreign movies with subtitles this hits home to the heart, it makes it all that much more special. What was different and a bit scary was actually hearing Pippi, Tommy, and Annika real voices! True to form the antics of Pippi has proven to be a lasting one and I encourage anyone who has children to watch Pippi and her Friends with their family. My 14-year-old daughter loves Pippi and what gratification to be able to experience the joy that you are so found of remembering with your own child? And if you have not experienced this joy as a child, it is not to late!",1129075200,48,1057,4.29
2347564,3,B000A0GYC8,"I've actually seen the last two of these movies with the original Swedish soundtrack, and so to say that the original soundtracks don't exist is a lie, and cheat, to deny everyone who does love these movies from the simple pleasure of actually getting to hear the original voices of those children we've all known and enjoyed for so long. The original American dubs of smoking adult voices coming out of innocent children's bodies are grotesque and scary, even without comparison. Think about it, how long you've known these characters, and have loved Inger Nilsson's perfect portrayal of childhood and all it's freedoms and extremes, and yet most of you have never even heard her voice-not once. Pippi herself wouldn't have put up with this for an instant; she'd have stockings pulled high fast and an instant plan to walk straight to Sweden-over the ocean no less. Americans like freedom of choice, and not having a Swedish sound track is definitely un-American, and it's not un-pippi. Hens Tooth should fire its marketing department, its American expert, and its president for ever even hiring any of them in the first place. What a sad event it is to have these great films in the wrong hands and treated with so carelessly. In the end I would only hope that at least the original actors might still get some portion of the profits for their original hard work. I would say that should be the final deciding factor for whether or not you should buy these DVD's. Does anyone know if they do get something from this release?",1126224000,28,1526,4.7406015037593985
2347565,5,B000A0GYC8,"I'm so happy to read the review above. I grew up watching these movies and loving them. I didn't buy the tv series because of the new voice over track the voices from the 70's fit the actors so well I thought. I'm really excited about Pippi Goes on Board because I've never seen that one. Praise to Buddah that they're finally releasing these movies I've been searching for them for years. These are great movies for the kid in all of us or for the kids who are kids, once you get past the mouths not matching the words that is. I can't wait to get these.",1125619200,3,555,4.148148148148148
2347566,5,B000A0GYC8,"I'm just about to turn 34 and finally the four original theatrical Pippi Longstocking releases are arriving on DVD.  I still get a kick out of Pippi and her friends.  These 4 discs are all new sharp, digital transfers and It will knock your socks off.  For those wondering about the audio tracks, the original 1970s voice over track we all remembered so well was also kept.  There isn't any new updated voice over which I'm excited about, this was only done on the TV DVD series of Pippi released last year since there was no English dub for the TV series.  The four Pippi films were mostly shown in the US with a wonderful (Godizilla like) voice over audio track in English.  There is no Swedish audio track, again because these films were actually taken from the TV series in Sweden and edited together to make a full length films for the US in the 1970s.  There is a Spanish track, however.

All this info was confirmed by Steven Newmark the President of Hen's Tooth.  He sent me a wonderful promo add which I would love to share but unfortunately Amazon doesn't allow links to be posted.  I will contact them and see if they can load the add on the web site.

2347648,5,B000A0GYC8,"This set of movies was a refreshing walk down memory lane. I know the dubbing is weird, but in my opinion, it adds extra charm. My sisters and I use to watch these when we were kids, and try to figure out how Pippi and her friends moved their mouths the way they did and still managed to sound somewhat normal. We thought the voice overs were funny, and finding out that the actors were originally speaking Swedish made it feel unique. I watched these with my 3 year old niece the other day, and was happy to see that they are still as funny and charming as a remembered them. My niece LOVED them! She was mesmerized. If your kids are fans of the Pippi books, and you want to watch a movie version that will be fun for kids AND adults this is it. The book's author had quite a bit of input in picking this cast, and it shows. Inger Nilsson is THE Pippi Longstocking! She was the perfect personification of a female Peter Pan. She brings a special something to this roll that no other actress has managed to do. I can't quite put my finger on exactly what it is. I saw other versions of Pippi Longstocking when I was a child, but none of them stuck with me like this one did. I'm so happy that I can share these cherished memory with my nieces!",1455408000,5,1243,4.161825726141079

Annika sounds like a 40 year old hooker from the Bronx! (im not kidding) Its such a huge flaw b/c as we ALL KNOW, Annika was a little mousy-sounding. NOT like this version where she (looks so cute) but sounds like an inmate. Its just a shame. Otherwise...its Pippi and fun. I also heard that there were scenes cut out. I haven't watched all DVDs yet, so i cant comment on that. It would be a shame (like the time they ate the shoe polish) ;) To be honest I would rather have had the option to have the original Swedish With subtitles.

2347734,3,B000A0GYC8,"These are the cute, charming, vintage Pippi films you'll remember seeing on TV in the 80s. Classic Swedish films dubbed in English.

(If you're not familiar with dubbing, it's basically a voice over so the actor on screen was filmed speaking one language while the voice coming out of your television is speaking another. Dubbing is an alternative to using subtitles and I assume was used here as children are less likely to read subtitles. This is why so many reviewers complained about the timing of voices being off - they don't know what dubbing is or don't realize these films are dubbed / didn't look at the product details before purchase.)

The reason why I didn't give this DVD set a higher rating is that the conversion of the old films to digital was not done very well. There are many places where the film skips/jumps, has tracking issues, etc. With technology these days there should be a much smoother conversion and playback. This was obviously a ""quick and cheap"" conversion job. The DVDs are no-frills, no extras - just the films. They are in full-size (not skinny or fold-out) cases. No added inserts or anything.

So, as I said - these are the great films you'll remember seeing on American TV in the 80s dubbed in English, but the digital conversion is poor. I would not pay the full list price. Wait for an Amazon seller to offer much lower as I did if you really want them.",1426982400,9,1396,4.576

2347753,4,B000A0GYC8,I used to love these movies as a kid and wanted to introduce them to my kids.  This DVD pack was just the one I was looking for. I was originally confused as to whether I should buy this or the show series and I went with this one.  The kids like watching it and I have enjoyed reminiscing.,1423440000,,290,3.8983050847457625
2347754,5,B000A0GYC8,"Totally memorable.  As a child, my 40 yr old son watched the Scandenavian Pippi on TV.  He was so excited to receive this set.  We all love it!!!",1422403200,,145,4.107142857142857
2347755,3,B000A0GYC8,I had no idea the movie is dubbed in english... Kinda drives me crazy listening to it in english but watching their mouths do something completely different. Whatever tho. It is what it is.,1421712000,,189,4.588235294117647
2347773,5,B000A0GYC8,I grew up loving these films & now my niece is loving them. I really like how these are made about kids in simple kid logic.,1420848000,,124,3.8076923076923075
2347774,4,B000A0GYC8,"Yes I think this DVD should be 5 stars, its so fantastic if you area fan of the original old Pippi.  This is the one to get over all others.  BUT there is just one problem that will bother some folks like it bothers me - they edited out the parts that might today seem too outrageous for children.  Somehow our modern sensibilities have become to soft to handle normal life.  A few examples are, Pippi no longer takes a Crumbulous pill in which she gets into an altered state; Pippi no linger shoots a tree down with her gun, Pippi no longer jumps off the cliff (which as you know in the original she lands safely on the ground without incident).  It seems that liberals got hold of this and fit it into their current world view in which no one should ever see anything that is potentially dangerous.  But otherwise than those few PC'isms this is AWESOME and AMAZING and WONDERFUL",1420761600,2,880,4.368098159509202

2347779,2,B000A0GYC8,I loved these films as a kid and wanted to share them with my grandkids.  The problem with the movies is the voice is about 3-4 seconds behind the way the actor's mouths work.  It kind of makes me crazy.  My grandkids love them though and I was happy to find them.  Not sure I'd buy them again  however just because the audio is so slow.,1416009600,,337,4.045454545454546

2347781,4,B000A0GYC8,"The English dubbing in the first movie is abysmal. The voices of the adults are plain idiotic. The second is better and by the third and forth movie, you are used to it (they actually are much better by that time - apparently learning to dub movies takes a while).

If you grew up knowing the original or properly dubbed Swedish/German versions, it'll take some getting used to... Having said that - your child will not care. My 7-year old was in stitches the whole time and the Pirate movie is favorite. These are great movies. Inger Nilsson is the true and original Pippi, with Tommy and Annika giving a great support cast. Yes, they do things that are going to freak out an American parent, and obviously the times have changed, but I doubt a child will watch these movies and will try to eat a plate of shoe polish, so stop worrying and enjoy.",1415577600,3,847,4.42948717948718

I first checked-out a copy of this box set from the public library for my 4 year old daughter to watch but I loved them from the first viewing. So I bought the box set for my daughter's birthday and we watch them all the time. Inger Nilsson not only looks the part of Pippi perfectly, she plays the role with exactly the right amount of mischievous charm. I probably scorned these movies as a kid because I was male but my guess is that boys would have as much fun with these films as my daughter does.
A note of caution: this footage was filmed around 1968 and the expectations for risky fantasy child behavior were more lax, I suppose. In one scene Pippi fires a musket into the ceiling and in another she goes over a high falls in a barrel, etc. So I just have to keep reminding my daughter that Pippi is a special ""superhero"" who can safely do such things but that no one else ever should.
But don't let that deter you unless you're really concerned. These movies are magical, impish fun for the young and young at heart.",1355443200,7,1094,4.165094339622642

2347984,5,B000A0GYC8,"I have boy-girl twins (5 years, almost 6) and pay a lot of attention to what and how much they watch. We had read many Pippi Longstocking stories, then moved on to book CD's to listen to.  After a few discussions with my German husband, who grew up watching the series in Germany, I finally gave in and got the kids this DVD collection to watch in English.  My husband and I both watched them with the children in the beginning, as our daughter is somewhat fearful.

I would definitely say that 5 years old is the youngest age a child should be to enjoy this great Swedish classic television series. I think it is wonderful that the main character in the series is a little girl who is very independent and self-confident, has so much fun, and places much value on friendships. I tell my children that girls can do and be anything that boys can do and be, and Pippi's antics reinforce that idea.  My son pretends that he is a pirate on the ship with Pippi as the captain.

Not to psychoanalyze, but in today's world where divorce rates are high (in the story her mother has passed away), the series strikes a nerve showing that Pippi's father loves her even though he isn't always there.  When he is there, he is loving and provides for her, but he always goes away again.",1282953600,,1272,4.36864406779661
2347985,4,B000A0GYC8,"I remembered watching this same movie as a child and fell in love w/ Pippi - she was magical for me as I imagined being Pippi myself. Now with three children of my own, I wanted to introduce classics to them - again, they love it! Also purchased the book series (not from Amazon I'm afraid but from a local book store) so it was great to hear my older daughter (8 yrs old) tell me a comparison and what SHE imagined Pippi looked like from her mind versus the movie version, et cetera. I have to admit, watching the movie as a child and now as an adult does not invoke the same feelings for me. As a kid, I didn't even realize the voice dubbing and the whole movie seemed more magical and incredible. As an adult, I can see the voice dubbing, the picture quality (now with all the new tech, blue ray, 2- and 3-D TVs), it doesn't do the same for me. But Pippi is a great story and I am happy that they make it available so I have it for my children-no matter what the quality. Maybe that's a good thing - for kids to compare even technically b/c I'm sure that's how my parents or grandparents felt when TV wasn't even around and they see what's available now. My final comment is, I think Amazon is great-always liked their service and reliability. But this Pippi DVD package is a bit expensive. Maybe if they threw in a book or something about the history of Pippi, a commentary or about the author or makings of Pippi, it would kinda even things out. But I loved Pippi so much as a child, am able to afford it so I got it for my own. Otherwise, I'd probably go to the library to borrow.",1281744000,3,1586,4.135922330097087

My kids loved them!  Now... On virtually every technical level (acting, narrative, photography) these movies leave much to be desired.  They were made in the 1970's in Sweden.  The English dubbing is pretty bad.  However, every child that I've ever known to watch these films was enamored with them.  Re-watchability is high, and the four-pack is a good deal.

Who is Pippi?  She's a super-strong red-headed girl with pig tails that stick straight to the side about a foot.  She is around 8 years old.  She lives in a big house with a horse and a monkey.  She has no parents or siblings, and spends her days inventing silly games and doing household chores in a fun ways.
