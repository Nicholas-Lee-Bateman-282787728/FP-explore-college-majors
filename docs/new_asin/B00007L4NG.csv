1819096,4,B00007L4NG,"This is a sexy sensual movie. The Leading man: Khalil Kain is Sexy.
If you don't find either of the Leading characters attractive this is not the movie for you, because the acting is mediocre, the plot and story line are not enticing.

So basically for me this was a sexy movie with an attractive leading man to drool over, nothing to take seriously as far the acting or actual story.

I gave it 4 stars because it does satisfy my needs, which is to watch the sexy Khalil Kain in a romantic leading man role.",1340150400,,508,4.28125
1819097,2,B00007L4NG,I wanted to add to my BET movies on DVD collection. Waste of my money. Monica Calhoun and Khalil Kain just didn't have any chemistry with weak acting.,1332288000,,150,4.392857142857143
1819098,3,B00007L4NG,"But got ok. The film is not too too bad--I like BET films, but I thought the film would be better. I'll keep it in the collection and watch it on those boring Saturday afternoons.",1281225600,,179,4.142857142857143

1819100,1,B00007L4NG,Save yourself some money and buy the book. The movie was no good. Once again I say BET should stick to publishing the books and STOP destroying these authors works by trying  and failing to make movies that are not worth the film they are printed on. Buy the book and wait for the movie to be shown again on tv. You'll be glad you did.,1050537600,8,335,4.075757575757576
