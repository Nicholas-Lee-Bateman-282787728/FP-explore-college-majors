8688337,3,B00PK4LLLS,"So it's the early autumn of 1924 and Rose's father-in-law Lord Sinderby has rented Brancaster Castle (really Alnwick Castle) in Northumberland and invited the Crawleys to a grouse-shooting party.
And again it's just so beautiful to look at.
The interiors are truly magnificent, if a little overwhelming, even compared to Highclere (Downton Abbey).....the costumes all wonderful, (everybody of course in the de-regueur tweeds for the moor, and then in some exciting beaded 1920's fashions); the cars a vintage automotive fanciers dream;...and the set dressings truly lavish.

So given all this luxurious icing, what does Fellowes do with it all for two whole hours?
Well not very much it must be said.

The Moorland Holiday of the title takes up the first part, and apart from some more hints that Lady Rigor-Mortis Mary may, or may not be interested in yet another tall dark and disinterested swain who drives a fast car, (the other two suitors are somehow forgotten here), and a rather ridiculous plot by her, Thomas and now fellow-compatriot in crime Baxter to take down a very snobbish butler who refuses to serve Branson.

No shooting accidents, no bodies, not even a single grouse is seen to be hit, despite this being a grouse shooting party and there are plenty of shotguns blasting away.
Is this coyness to protect American viewer's sensibilities I wonder?
Even members of the British Royal Family are not at all adverse to massacring a few thousand birds or so in one shoot!
But apparently ""no animals were harmed etc. etc.""

The rest of the two hours is filled with little inconsequential events that do not advance the narrative, merely provide a series of pretty, (often petty) diversions.
The whole idiotic Russian business is just allowed to fizzle out to a meaningless end after one quite bizarre scene, (mercifully!), and we get little matters like Lord Grantham maybe has a heart condition, ...it's only an ulcer; Isobel and Lord Merton might marry? No she won't because his kids resent her;...Carson and Mrs Hughes might invest together in a B&B? Well no, because.....and on it goes, vacillating between what might be, and the same old state.
However the single most annoying and disappointing aspect to me was the now incredibly over-drawn lengths to which the Anna/Bates ""mystery"" is yet again extended. Talk about wringing out the last vestiges of a one-line story!
It's Bates; it's Anna; it's Bates; it's neither; the witness is sure; the witness has doubts; there's a prior history; there's not; there's a confession; it's not; ...one's in gaol, one's out; will the other one go back in now that the other one's out?......irritating beyond belief!
Finish the damn thing and let's all move on!
It was never that great a storyline anyway.

This is of course the ""Christmas Special"" and it just would NOT be the same without a whole lot of very schmaltzy Hallmark Greeting Card scenes in the great Hall at Downton with the aristos all in their finery making soppy professions of love to each other and barely ignoring the stench of the great unwashed peasantry they have deigned to invite to enter the family sanctum in such an egalitarian spirit.

Carols? Of course, one even sung by Lady Rigor-Mortis with about as much feeling as one might manage under a massive dose of chloroform.
The ever irritating Rose gushes at everybody through her protruding teeth as is her usual style and her Jewish husband professes he's never seen a Christmas, ...despite living in England?
Anyway, ....everybody says how much they love everybody else, ..even dear departed Sibyl in a little ""sance"" moment, and sentiment abounds, even amongst the staff.

There is one slightly new ""development"" downstairs that you too will see coming a mile off...but hey, predictability is a feature Fellowes has raised to an art form now.
And yes, Branson is STILL threatening/promising to depart for America, and he does seem set to really go this time, but we still do not actually see him finally depart.
So in effect, even at the end of this Series Five ""clincher"", the viewer is left pretty much in the same position as before. The status quo has been effectively maintained.

If you were maybe expecting some end of season cliff-hanger, or revelation, you will be very much disappointed.
If you feared there might be a shock death a la Matthew, then you will be very much relieved.
If however, you can sit back and enjoy a series of VERY pretty pictures you will no doubt be fully satiated after watching this.",1424044800,4,4506,4.904199475065616
