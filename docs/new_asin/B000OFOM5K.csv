8184859,2,B000OFOM5K,I read the description with great interest -- but I am not familiar with conversion software.  I decided not to buy because I do not know whether my PC has any DVD capability.  Does this DVD play on a PC?,1359417600,,204,4.075
8184860,1,B000OFOM5K,"I am looking for software that can be used to convert analog audio to a file format that is compatible with car CD music players,i.e., software that produces multiple tracks on a CD that can be read by older car CD audio players. Does this instructional CD identify such software? I can't tell from the description. Please, someone, write a concise explanation of what is and is not included in this instructional DVD!",1293148800,2,418,4.739726027397261
8184861,5,B000OFOM5K,"I apologize for not having a description of our video ""Your Music to CD"". We submitted the ad copy to our distributor but they apparently did not put it in this ad. We are now looking into it.

As to what the product is, it is a DVD on how to transfer music from a turntable, audio cassette player or other sources onto a CD. Rather than try to explain it in detal, i copied and pasted the complete text from the back of the cover for you to read. I hope this helps, and again I am sorry for the lack of information in this ad.
