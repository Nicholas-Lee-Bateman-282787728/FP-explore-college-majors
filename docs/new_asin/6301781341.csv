7815425,5,6301781341,"OMG.. My sister and I LOVED this tape. We had it since we were very very young, I want to guess around 4. We watched it for years, just for fun (it brought back memories). I think I last watched it at 17 or 18 haha, but then the VCR ruined the tape. LOVED THIS FILM, I will probably buy it again, since I see it still exists.",1271808000,2,325,3.7941176470588234
7815426,4,6301781341,"I remember every time I went to visit my grandmother, I insisted on watching this show. I loved it very much. In fact, I loved it so much, my grandmother ended up giving it to me when I was in high school. I began working at a daycare and brought the vhs with me. The children loved it, especially the kindergarteners. The cover became lost quickly. The vhs disappeared a few years later. I am hoping to find a good copy here now that I have my first child. I would like my children to enjoy the music and fun Captain E. Magination brings as I did when I was young.
