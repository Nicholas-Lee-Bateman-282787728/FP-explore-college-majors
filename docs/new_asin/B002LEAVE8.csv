This experience is great for deep relaxation, for learning, and simply for pure enjoyment.

Because every image floats on top of the musical foreground, the eyes don't even know they are not in the lead.  This means that the ears, which process sound at a speed unfathomably slower than the speed of light (which assaults our eyes every nanosecond they are open), are in full control.  For classical music listening, so often the nuances become mere victims of inevitably stressful incursions from an overactive mind filled with lingering ""to do"" lists.  :-)

In a word, this is a FANTASTIC visceral experience!!!",1301097600,,855,4.937062937062937
