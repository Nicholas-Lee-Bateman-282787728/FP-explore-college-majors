Before I bought this, I just watched the complete content of disc 1 on youtube. On disc 2, there're ~40 min CL review, ~25 min fa cup/carling cup review, ~40 min manager review (never watched anywhere before!), ~10 min Terry & Lampard review, ~5+5 min victory parade & Bolton celebration.
Anyway, this item is absolutely a must-have of every CFC supporter!
(Simply hope our future season reviews could be as good as this one or even better!)
Jose, simply the best & welcome home!",1370649600,,567,4.68

8325028,5,B000CPYXJC,"This is probably the best season reveiw made of any soccer team. There's over 4 hours of footage, every goal in every competition, extended footage of the big games with Man Utd, Arsenal, Barcelona and exclusive interviews with Jose, John Terry and Frank Lampard that give you real insight into what the manager and players went through during the season.

Highly recommended for obviously all Chelsea supporters and fans of soccer in general. This DVD sets a new standard that hopefully all soccer clubs will follow.",1134432000,3,517,5.011627906976744
