2509467,4,B000E8N8OS,I am a long time fan of Catherine Cookson and have probably read most of her books. The film adaptations have been pretty faithful to the books and the production values have been top notch.  It looks like a whole studio has been created just for her books! Any Cookson fan would be pleased with the transiton of her books to film.,1184198400,5,331,4.338709677419355
2509468,5,B000E8N8OS,I purchased this DVD set for mymother-in-law.  She was overjoyed with it and has raved about it.  She is a huge fan of Catherine Cookson and really enjoys anything she has produced.,1151280000,6,181,4.625
2509469,4,B000E8N8OS,"I am glad to welcome the Catherine Cookson Collection-Set 1 into my period film library, and while I have not read any of Ms. Cookson's books, the films are vastly entertaining and will hopefully open up a new legion of fans. The boxed set contains four films: The Wingless Bird, The Moth, The Rag Nymph, and the Fifteen Streets.

The films, produced by Granada television, are well done overall, however they are not quite as sumptuous as many of the BBC productions everyone loves so much; they also tend to be a little bit darker. Despite this, I believe the Catherine Cookson films educate viewers on the behaviors and conditions of England's lower and middle classes and are for the most part highly realistic. They also boast many fine actors:  Juliet Aubrey, Sean Bean, Justine Waddell, Honeysuckle Weeks, Jack Davenport, and Crispin Bonham-Carter, to name a few.

My favorite movie out of the collection was The Rag Nymph, the story of a prostitute's young daughter being taken in by a rag and bones lady. Afterwards, The Moth followed by the The Wingless Bird, and finally, The Fifteen Streets.",1149033600,15,1103,4.8563829787234045
2509470,3,B000E8N8OS,"OMG, it sure took them long enough to finally start putting her other films on DVD! I don't like all of her stories, but i do like many of them. Not that i read a lot, i don't, but i love watcbing films...esp. period films. Am just glad that now we'll get the chance to have them in a better format...and, in boxed sets no less!

 BTW, am giving this set 3 stars because, even though i have not seen it yet, am hoping they did a good job in video transfer. But i gave it 3 stars just based on how much i like her stories.",1139443200,4,521,3.8598130841121496
2509471,5,B000E8N8OS,"I am an all time Catherine Cookson Fan and these 4 dvd's of these  stories are done very well,any Cookson fan will really appreciate these,I'm glad to have them in my Library.",1343692800,,175,4.46875
2509472,5,B000E8N8OS,"This boxed set is truly a value for your money. The films are hardly high-drama Oscar contenders, but they are most enjoyable to watch.  They are well-produced, faithful to the text, and utilize many excellent English actors familiar to those of us who love British period films. Although Cookson's tales are entertaining, I've never thought she was a great writer.  This may explain why I actually prefer the film version of her works to the printed ones.  And to their credit, these films follow the books' plot and dialogue very closely--often a verbatim transcript of the original text.  My favorite by far is ""The Moth"" but my judgment may be colored by the winsome, charming actor Jack Davenport who plays the lead male role in the film. All the films in this collection, however, are worth viewing--especially for Cookson fans. Go ahead...treat yourself to some lovely romance!",1329955200,,884,4.993197278911564
2509473,4,B000E8N8OS,"I watched all except The fifteen streets, these period pieces are charming yet gritty and thouroughly entertaining. They had me drawn in especially The Rag Nymph and I must admit i did shed a tear or two. I love movies that keep you engaged without explosives,special effects or nudity.",1324944000,,286,4.857142857142857
2509474,5,B000E8N8OS,"I don't understand why Catherine Cookson is not well known and appreciated in the US. Her novels are fine, gritty social commentary. Her characters are strong and often face difficult moral dilemmas. She is similar to Charles Dickens in her ability to bring characters to life and provide social criticism only with more realism and less sentimentality. Cookson is not for the weak of stomach. The fact that her characters tend to come out on top in the end makes them watchable.

The Wingless Bird is set just before and during WWI. A strong female character of ordinary birth wins the hearts of two successive upper class brothers.

The Moth follows the story of a dock worker who becomes a carpenter then a laborer at an estate. He wins the hearts two upper class sisters on the estate. Jack Davenport is wonderful in this role.

The Rag Nymph follows the life of Millie, a girl with an upper class upbringing as her mother falls into prostitution after the imprisonment of her father. She is taken in by grumpy ""Raggie Aggie"" the rag seller. Aggie is also raising the cheeky Ben Smith, Jones, or Robinson, a deformed street child of unknown parentage. Aggie and Ben seek to protect Millie from the local Pimp, Boswell, who feels the suicide of Millie's mother has robbed him of his due. Boswell wants to place Millie as a child prostitute serving upper class customers. Aggie uses her savings to place Millie in a convent for her protection. Millie then gains employment on an estate as a nanny. This exposes her to upper class men who seek first to rape then to make her into a mistress. She flees this situation only to fall into the hands of Boswell. Only the efforts of Ben can save her now...

The Fifteen Streets is classic Cookson, set in Tyne Dock, Cookson's home country. The role Sean Bean plays as the promiscuous and jealous brother was the start of his acting career.",1277856000,7,1884,4.648648648648648
2509475,4,B000E8N8OS,"If anyone has this set and could check, we need CC or subtitles - we cannot hear the dialog.

Please check if you would be so kind - this looks like one we don't want to miss if...

Thank you.",1252713600,,192,3.775
2509476,4,B000E8N8OS,"Excellent period pieces, that takes one back in time.  The story lines are excellent though somewhat gritty whoch could have been left out, the locations, music, costumes and actors are really excellent.",1245628800,,203,5.34375
2509477,5,B000E8N8OS,"After watching the semi-porn, violence infested, vulgarly spoken American trash, it was wonderful to watch adult stories presented tastefully.",1224547200,3,142,6.526315789473684
2509478,4,B000E8N8OS,"I've only just discovered Catherine Cookson's films recently. Being in the US, I never realized just how popular they are and luckily for me, they've adapted many of them to film. Of the 4 films in this 1st box set, I've only seen The Moth and The Wingless Bird. But those 2 have been such great productions, I can't wait to finish the rest. The production quality and actors are surprisingly first rate. Though not as grand as typical BBC productions, these films still capture that authentic feel for these periods. What I like most is that these stories and characters offer more than the typical romances. They always manage to also capture real issues of the day. I'm definitely going to look up the 2nd box as well.",1209513600,5,721,4.596899224806202
2509479,4,B000E8N8OS,"I bought this set for my mother and she loved it, so much so that I bought the next set. If you enjoy period drama then you can't really go wrong with this collection",1207526400,2,166,3.911764705882353
2509480,5,B000E8N8OS,"These movies are wonderful and done in the most realistic fashion as only the BBC can do.  They stick very close to Ms. Cookson's books and I will look at them over and over.  This set is very nice and in some of them the ending is happy and some not so happy....but that is the way life really is.  Also it was even harder in the UK in the past centuries for the poor.  They knew their ""place"" and did not expect much. Just buy these if you like romance and history and you will not be disappointed.",1185408000,3,500,4.02020202020202
8107133,5,B000E8N8OS,"The Moth, included in the set, is a hidden gem. A terrific, romantic movie with great casting/acting, and an interesting story. It has one of the best, romantic endings you will ever find in a movie.",1485820800,,199,4.555555555555555

8107135,5,B000E8N8OS,I'm a Catherine Cookson and this set was terrific.,1446076800,,50,4.666666666666667
8107136,2,B000E8N8OS,"Catherine Cookson movies are excellent, always contrasting the have's with the have not's. While I was very pleased with all the movies in Set 2 where Catherine's story lines improved or the movie productions did, I was disappointed with this Set 1. I enjoy drama with well developed stories and characters. However, I prefer entertainment that requires no censorship. These stories were okay, but I only found The Wingless Bird and The Moth worthwhile. While I understand that life is colorful but not always rosy, I don't care for stories laced with prostitutes or people with strange out of body experiences. Keep me on the edge of my seat with mystery, intrigue or suspense, not with an uneasy expectation of yet another sordid activity or image.",1407542400,2,750,4.9603174603174605
8107137,3,B000E8N8OS,"Am a Catherine Cookson fan and would have enjoyed these, if they hadn't been damaged upon arrival.  Had to return them, since they were not viewable.",1407110400,,149,4.730769230769231
8107138,5,B000E8N8OS,Catherine Cookson stories are the best. I watch them over and over again. More of her stories should be made into movies.,1390262400,,121,4.545454545454546
8107139,5,B000E8N8OS,Love catherine cookson!  Just need more:) I love British television and all that it has to offer to me! Yay,1379721600,,107,4.35
8107140,5,B000E8N8OS,"Very well done,  great quality storylines, top notch acting and great filming.  Action, romance, intrigue, treachery, loyalty....these films have it all.  My wife loves these, but they are by no means chick flicks.  One seems to be as good as the other.  As in most dvd sets, there are 1 or 2 good ones and the others are mediocre or poor, but not in this case.  We got hooked on them.  I would recommend this collection or any of the other Catherine Cooksons.",1374451200,,460,4.469879518072289
8107141,2,B000E8N8OS,I love the stories and I had some on vhs but this is a very poor quality and you cannot enjoy it the ou should. Also no close caption,1359849600,,133,3.6206896551724137
8107142,5,B000E8N8OS,"Excellent!!! I have only seen ""The Wingless Bird""-beautiful story, and I have seen the first part of ""The rag Nymph"", also a nice story. The only problem I found is that it doesn't have closed caption, and because of the brittsh accent it's hard to understand the conversations sometimes.  Other than that i have no complaints.",1351123200,,327,4.839285714285714
