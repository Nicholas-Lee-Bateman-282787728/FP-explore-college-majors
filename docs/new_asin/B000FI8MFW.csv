The plot does revolve around a young couple that are thinking about divorcing in East Germany in the mid 1960's.  Alfred, the husband is a bit of a rebel, he is mechanic by trade, but he and his friends ride motorcycles (and wear blue jeans and leather jackets).  Lisa, the wife is a maternity nurse.  The movie revolves around the couple and their friends and co-workers who are concerned about their impending divorce.

I liked this movie, not only for the plot but for the view you see of East Germany at the height of the Cold War.  No you don't see any pictures of the wall or military units, but you do see the stark living conditions of most East Germans, the present and future conforming apartment blocks and some of the rebelliousness of some of the younger people.",1443398400,,867,4.519230769230769

 The description is rather misleading, first off there is nothing 'sexually frank' about this movie and I also doubt it was banned by DGR sensors, as I saw nothing that could be considered an insult to the government.  This is a VERY tame, slow moving film which no doubt was not released due to it's blandness.

There really is nothing even remotely sexual about it; I don't even remember any kissing.  The story-line is pretty lame, a couple in a small apartment are upset with each other, but we never really find out what the issue is and it ends with only the hint they will get back together.  The acting and lighting were good and it was interesting  to see the street scenes of '60s East Berlin.  Otherwise, there's not a lot to take away from this film.

If you're interested in East German cinema there are far better choices from the DEFA libaries, like: I was nineteen, Carbide & Sorel, Council of the Gods, The Gleiwitz Case, the murders are among us, and the Sun seekers.",1389398400,,1109,4.4504950495049505
