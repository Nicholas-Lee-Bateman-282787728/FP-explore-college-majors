1959085,4,B0000YEF0W,"Like it or not the computer has changed our lives in ways far beyond business, data storage, ease of trafficking information, etc.  The concept of Internet dating may not be new but it has rarely been so successfully investigated as well as Jed Weintrob's ON_LINE.  And whether or not the viewer has ever participated in streaming video chat rooms or utilized the many internet on line sex spots, this small, low budget film will be an eye opener.

Recently dumped John Roth (Josh Hamilton) and his roommate Moe Curley (Harold Perrineau) out of frustration have started an internet dating/chat site/erotic exchange business.  John rarely leaves his apartment/business, electing to spend his entire day and night online watching the beautiful Angel (Liz Owens) going about her daily duties of grooming, dressing and undressing and sleeping.  John has an online buddy Moira (Isabel Gillies) who acts somewhat as a mentor for lonely people like young Ohio gay lad Ed Simone (Eric Millegan) who dials up another online sex provider, older Al Fleming (John Fleck), in an attempt to have some semblance of a non-closeted life.  Moe attempts to get John out into the real dating world and arranges a meeting with the beautiful but sexually frustrated Jordan Nash (Vanessa Ferlito) but the two find relating easier on the internet than in real life.  These people all interact both online and in life in a way that begins to blur what is reality.  The concept is one of the dichotomies of fantasy and reality, desire/need and acting out, isolated loneliness versus stepping into the physical world and joining the dance of courtship.

The beauty of the film is in the production, and if awards were bestowed on creativity this little movie with its split screens, streaming videos, computer video cameras, and the station they all are relegated to in the space of a room, would be at the top of the list. The actors are all very fine, creating believable characters out of very little face-to-face interaction.  ON_LINE has a lot to say about our current state of human relationships and interacting and it says it without being dark and cruel but instead with a lot of light comedy that serves to make the story relatedly credible.  For the subject about of sex acts, it remains suggestive with being graphic: it walks a thin line very successfully.  Grady Harp, February 06",1140393600,8,2367,4.919597989949748
1959086,5,B0000YEF0W,"I just finished watching this film thanks to Encore.  I agree that this film truly captures the hearts of cyber ppl in that we can all relate to at least one of the character's personality and hopefullness.  With shots of New York pre 9/11 and the great cinematography throughout the film, I think anyone who watches this film would agree, the director/writer hits home with a message that if not already found, we are all just looking for someone to love.",1133308800,3,456,4.617283950617284
1959087,5,B0000YEF0W,"I initially thought the movie would be shallow in content, but in the end I find it quite deep in that it well describes today's people especially with interactions in internet.

Over all I think the movie is well made with good acting and story telling. A lot of uninhibited sexual content were shown without actually appearing dirty.

I agree with the view of the movie in that cyber space has real people, but there is something unreal about it. People take risks because cyber space gives us unreal feeling about the situation, but it is as real as reality. It sounds contradictory, but that's the scary part of all.",1123372800,8,620,4.627272727272727
1959088,5,B0000YEF0W,"Jed Weintrob's witty, tongue-in-cheek sojourn into the world of webcams exudes both sexiness and substance.  With striking, smoothly-technical visuals and noteworthy performances by Hamilton, Perrineau and Gillies, ""On_Line"" is a must-have for technophiles and indie film buffs, and a stylistic joyride for anyone.",1078358400,4,314,6.3023255813953485

8004545,2,B0000YEF0W,"Glad I saw it as I like Linda Hamilton as an actress, but this was painful to watch. Not because of Linda's acting, but because oif the writing. Isn't it always the way of TV movies though? The writing is predictable, and subpar.",1383868800,,229,4.348837209302325
8004546,3,B0000YEF0W,"On-line, right. Poor casting of characters, didn't quite feel very intriguing. The camera shooting style was not the best for the type of film. I didn't feel much of the plot line present in this movie.",1380240000,,202,4.638888888888889
