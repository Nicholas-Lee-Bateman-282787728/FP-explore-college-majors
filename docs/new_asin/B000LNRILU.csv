8162421,3,B000LNRILU,I'm also disappointed a little. It's just a 23 minute long video... It's too short. And why it states on the disc and on the case it's 1h 30 min. long? :(,1175731200,4,154,3.84375
8162422,3,B000LNRILU,"I purchased this video in Feb 2007 with the intention of using it to help plan my trip to PEI in 2008.  While the DVD case and the DVD both clearly say ""Running time: 1hr, 30min"", the video is actually only about 23 minutes long.  The info is good, but not very detailed at all!  I was very disappointed.  I paid $12.99 for the DVD, but I think that's way too high for only 23 minutes of information.  In my opinion, anyone would be better off spending their time looking up information on the internet or investing in a good book on PEI.",1171843200,12,538,4.184466019417476
