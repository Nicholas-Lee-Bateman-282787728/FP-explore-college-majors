I like the fact he has also trained outside wing chun, this gives him a much better and balanced view / perspective on wing chun.",1448928000,,276,4.8936170212765955
8319793,4,B001LTZ5OU,"Clear instructions of the form, also nice examples of how the two-person drills work. Production looks a little dated, but very pleased with purchase.",1385251200,,150,5.291666666666667
8319794,2,B001LTZ5OU,"I currently have Benny meng trapping hands and sil lim tao video which I love, and I thought this would be the same. What I wanted to see was more information on bridging the gap, and the applications as well as drills [like the sil lim tao video was] instead this is simply a video designed to teach you the form, not more then that. The applications were mostly left out and no new drills were presented.

this video would be good if you are trying to learn this particular style of chum kiu. and since I already practice a different style of forms this video was basically useless to me.

*UPDATE* Because someone left me a comment I feel I should update this review and explain why I said what I did. First off I added an extra star to the product because its a little better then what I remembered, and changed some wording around to make it more clear. The commenter was right that this DVD DOES in fact cover chi sao, he goes over the basic roll and explains in great detail why we do Luk Sau [rolling arms] and goes over pushing-pulling and running and catching hands. There is also a section where he demonstrates punching and that was ok.

As far as new information though there was nothing that I had not heard before and just about EVERY single wing chun DVD covers the same Chi Sau stuff, so at this point for me its all repeat. I stand behind my review though when I said The applications were mostly left out and What I wanted to see was more information on bridging the gap. Also when I said no new drills were presented. I meant like what was demonstrated in the first few DVDS other then Chi sau. The information on this DVD was just too basic and would maybe be ok if you were doing wing chun for 4 months but after that you should already know what's on this DVD other then the form itself.",1356134400,2,1810,4.255813953488372
8319795,5,B001LTZ5OU,"I hold a black belt in Goju Ryu and have studied martial arts for a few decades now. I own a great number of instructional DVDs about various martial arts. This DVD on Chum Kiu by Benny Meng is one of the best I've come across (as are the first and third in the series covering two other forms in the Wing Chun system)!

It has the essentials, good clear filming of the form, well lit, and professionally done. Benny Meng obviously has the physical skills to do what he's doing.

But what makes this video stand out from many others is the quality of the verbal instruction that accompanies the demonstration of the form and the techniques that are shown. Benny Meng spends a lot of time explaining exactly what the point of each movement of the form is and its relevance within the philosophy of the Wing Chun system.

Many other instructional DVDs on martial arts will just show you the form or some techniques, and leave you to figure out what it means or how it fits within the system, or at best they will give you a very superficial explanation. But this DVD by Benny Meng is a step above many others because of the quality and thoroughness of the accompanying verbal instruction.

Excellent!",1262649600,2,1198,4.481651376146789
