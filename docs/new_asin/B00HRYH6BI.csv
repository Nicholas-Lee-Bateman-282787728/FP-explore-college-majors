8635262,5,B00HRYH6BI,"I first saw this Western on a Saturday afternoon in Philadelphia at the Tower theatre when I was fourteen years old, and loved it.  I was hesitant to see it again, thinking that maybe now that I am an adult--actually, a senior citizen--the movie would just be something awful.  Boy, was I wrong.  It held up after all these years.  I vehemently disagree with the reviewer who called this film ""a dog.""  OK, SHANE or HIGH NOON it isn't--let's admit that.  But it never passed itself off as a Western of that caliber.  What it really is is a modest, unassuming but very enjoyable and nicely acted B-Western.  I would watch it again--and I won't wait 54 years to do so.",1427068800,3,666,4.446280991735537

8635264,3,B00HRYH6BI,"I'm being really generous with 3 stars, really generous. Definitely a spaghetti western and all about revenge. Predictable and sometimes inane but also sometimes fun. the star, Richard Harrison, and how this guy ever got into movies is beyond me....emotions seem to be distant to him,. same expression all the time. This is just an exercise in gun play and tough talk, the jail shootout takes forever as does the final scene. Toooooooo long, I guess they needed to fill time. But I got booored.  I would say don't bother or else do a lot of fast forwarding. they seem to have tried to do some kind of ""hang 'em High"" and it didn't ever work.",1404604800,,641,4.525862068965517
8635265,3,B00HRYH6BI,"This little known B-Western (in Scope and Black & White) adds to a classic plot a very dramatic edge. The false town tamer (James Craig who had killed the real one and takes his place) has to wipe out the town from a crippled saloon owner who seems to hire any gunslinger in the whereabouts. Usual western script... where we see Craig killing one by one all those supposed to kill him. Until the last one who happens to be his one kid brother (Brett Halsey)! Of course William Hope whoever he is ain't  Anthony Mann who would certainly had made a masterpiece out of this script and this small budget western. But this is anyway a strong enough little western that should be seen by hardcore western fans. Sound and image are average. For foreigners, note that this series are zone free and with english subtitles.",1401235200,4,813,4.530612244897959
8635266,1,B00HRYH6BI,"I was eleven when I first saw this dog.  At the time, I ate up everything western, but even at that age I realized what a bad movie this was.  The actors were all over the hill, at best, Brett Halsey was the youngest, having outgrown his spoiled son of long suffering parents role.  And the saddest part was the final gunfight where Craig wipes a tear from his eye and then beats his brother to the draw and kills him.  Martha Vickers role was bad to say the least, and she was the best actor in the bunch.",1398643200,7,506,4.08080808080808
