8237586,4,B0010B1W46,"I first watched this great game through the links on the unofficial site for Logan Tom (logantom.info). The game was recorded by a VCR and then transferred to the avi format by a fan to post it on the internet. I have bought this DVD hoping that it would basically give me the same coverage of the game when it was first aired (the VCR version) but with a better quality in the picture. Yes, it is that great of a game that I wanted to see it all. But I was sorely disappointed. The DVD has NO extras. Nothin', nadda, zip, zilch. It didn't even have the winner celebration at the end. They edited out everything except for the points -- very dry. No coach interviews, no extra funny comments that mark the time period as in the original airing. Not even the introduction of the commentators -- how rude. The beginning of the DVD is the first point played. And the DVD ends at the last point of the game, there isn't even a replay on the championship point. Very disappointing. I've also bought the semi-finals between the Stanford Cardinals and Nebraska, also the same disappointing cutting style. Obviously whoever is responsible for the editing of these DVDs doesn't love the game.

And that is very unfortunate because I just love watching this game. I think I might have seen this game (the VCR version) for more than 5 times now from start to finish. I absolutely love Logan Tom -- she did everything!

So, if you want the clearer version for the play by play, then get this DVD. For more enjoyable entertainment, I think it is better to head over to logantom.info and download the VCR version for free.",1223164800,,1608,4.484641638225256
