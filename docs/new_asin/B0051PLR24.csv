4525642,5,B0051PLR24,"Every review will warn you about the graphic and original violence in this movie. Getting that out of the way this movie does have an interesting plot
told in flashback along with excellent acting for what some would call a horror movie. A young lady wants a specific flat and finds means and method
to get it. Why she wants this flat is told in the flashbacks.

As violent as this movie is if you were to take Macbeth and portray it on film as written you would have an equal to this movie.
Roman Polanski came close to this in his version of Macbeth on film.

Once again as in every review of this movie very vivid and shocking violence is on screen,but it does add into the movie and suspense.",1326585600,2,696,4.265151515151516
4525643,5,B0051PLR24,"Dream Home was made in Hong Kong with English subtitles but I had no problem following the story.
A young woman is so obsessed with owning an apartment with an ocean view that she will literally kill to get it.
It has lot's of flash backs that show us why she is so desperate to have this home and why it has to be on the water.

The lead actress does an amazing job of being vicious and sweet all at the same time.
It has the best gore effects I have seen since 'Laid to Rest'.There are so many creative and atmospheric kills that you don't have a chance to catch your breath in between although not overly done as to make it troma-esque.

There is also some heart involved in this film and at times you almost sympathize with the murderess.
The most brutal and horrific kill scene is the pregnant woman. I am a great lover of gore and slasher films but this kill made me uncomfortable and left me feeling violated myself.
All in all a very clever storyline with good acting and brutal,creative kills.",1319846400,6,1002,4.296296296296297
4525644,3,B0051PLR24,"This movie is so graphic even diehard Saw fans would cringe and look away. I did. The question is what disturb state of mine would create for profit or watch for pleasure such graphic mayhem. It's almost like admiring the skill of Holocaust torturers or drug cartel and state supported torturers for their effective  outcomes. On the other hand I wouldn't address that question if it wasn't for the effectiveness of the writer and director in showcasing the same skill. Fortunately it got so over-the-top one could put it down as just dark humor.

What's the story? Girl grows up a bit disturb by her poverty, a bit of abuse while at the same time getting a bit envious and greedy for what others may have. So, she goes on a killing spree to get the home of her dreams. And, gets away with it.",1319760000,3,793,4.462068965517242
4525645,5,B0051PLR24,"Saw this one last night and...I LOVED IT!!! Available on Netflix streaming. The social commentary storyline may appear hokey at times but stick with it, the directing and cinematography is beautifully done which only makes the brutal and intense moments that much more spectacular. A dose of dark humor and awesome gore scenes makes this one of Hong Kongs best.",1315440000,2,361,5.033333333333333
4525656,3,B0051PLR24,"It sends an incredible message in a very gross but accurate way.  The hybrid kills a bunch of Chinese people with very nice bodies and a Filipina because she covets a harbor view (but she's a native HKer so how does she not remember that the harbor is always shrinking with reclaimed land so that no one gets to keep their harbor view forever?)

How can the casting be an accident when the home invasions are so awful and reminiscent of the Japanese home invasions upon the Chinese?

Very brutal a la Wrong Turn.  The message is what is compelling not that this is a horror film about someone (not the actress) with a really bad personality.",1384387200,,641,4.452991452991453

4525658,2,B0051PLR24,"The stars are only for the make-up and extremely well-done violence. But the story lacked believability, unless the protagonist was genetically psychotic or bipolar. The message was strong and many in America will identify with the housing crisis, and so will many in developing countries.
If you like hardcore violent scenes--that may make you throw up, you will find quite a few of them here.
But if you like good movie with a story, I say move on.",1362700800,,450,4.782051282051282
4525659,5,B0051PLR24,"This brutal Chinese import is NOT to be confused with the dreadful Daniel Craig snoozer DREAM HOUSE.

This grueling shocker about the Hong Kong real estate market (?!?) not only raised the stakes on over-the-top practical gore effects,  but showed how even much more affecting gore can be when coupled with an emotionally charged story line.

Josie Ho's performance as one of the most gruesome movie monsters of recent date is magnified by how much we actually care and about this woman and kinda-sorta understand the savage lengths to which she's driven.

4525660,5,B0051PLR24,"This is a super gory slasher.  It's a slasher movie in which I fee sympathy for the killer.  I feel bad for her, and can relate to some of her pain and disappointment.  I don't agree with the killings ( I feel bad for the victims too), but I understood why she was frustrated, at least.  Its almost two different movies in one.  Its part made for tv drama, and part brutal slasher.  It definitely works as two separate movies, but the two parts don't fit well as a cohesive unit.  In spite of its flaws, I still love this movie.  If you like brutal violence and gore in your movies, then you'll like this one.",1353715200,2,609,4.189655172413793
4525661,5,B0051PLR24,"This may be one of the best films I've ever seen. Its so brutal and it doesn't apologize for it. The storytelling is really impressive. I'm usually not a fan of non-linear storytelling because I feel like it messes with story progression, this is a pleasant example of how non-linear storytelling can make a film more compelling. If you're squeamish do not watch this movie. Also, the bonus features are great.",1351468800,,410,4.788732394366197
4525662,4,B0051PLR24,"I was recently browsing the foreign movie section at my local library and fell upon this. Didn't know much about it but read the jacket description and decided to take a flyer on it. Good decision!

""dream Home"" (2010 release from Hong Kong; 96 min.) brings the story, set in 2007 and supposedly based on true events, of a Hong Kong woman Ms. Cheng (played by Josie Ho, who also co-produced the movie) who desparately wants to buy a condo ""with a sea view"", but the crazy Hong Kong real estate market being what it was in those days, it's seemingly an impossible dream. Cheng gets driven to a murderous rampage when she thought she had a deal on her dream condo, only for the owners to renig at the last minute. Much has been made about the violence in this movie, and to be clear, this isn't for the faint of heart. I had to look away on a number of occasions, to be honest. But it is done in such a stylish way! Beauty in the orchestrated (and of course fake) violence.

Hong Kong the city plays a huge role in the movie and really is the other ""star"" beside Josie Ho. I've visited Hong Kong, and what an incredibly beautiful place it is. But when you go away from the ""touristy"" part of the city (the harbor) and see how people live there (as I did by taking a local bus just going around the city's layers away from the haror), it just blows the mind how crammed everyone lives. That aside, I really enjoyed this movie. Stick around for the great extras on the DVD, with plenty of behind the scenes interviews with the director, the producers and the actors, as well as how they staged the bloody murder scenes. If you are up for a foreign movie that isn't for the faint of heart, then ""dream Home"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1335484800,,1725,4.304615384615385
4525663,3,B0051PLR24,"<strong>Wai dor lei ah yut ho</strong> (Ho-cheung Pang, 2010)

I wanted to like this movie (English title: <em>Dream Home</em>) quite a bit more than I actually did, but it suffers from a few too many flaws for that. Still, for someone with just the right sense of humor, this would probably be right up your alley, and enough glimmers of what could have been come through that the average filmgoer (at least, the average filmgoer who can stand movie screens awash in gore) will at least not think it sucks.

Plot: As we open, Lai-sheung Cheng (<em>Contagion</em>'s Josie Ho) is sneaking into a building's security room and offing the guard. After which we jump back to her at her desk, working a phone bank, trying to sell stuff. (This time shuffle is likely to confuse you for well over half the film unless you read something that tells you what the filmmaker is doing. It's not handled well at all, and this is the movie's main flaw.) Lai-sheung has craved an apartment in Victoria Harbor, an ultra-swank Hong Kong waterfront apartment building. She works two jobs, spends just enough to keep herself alive, and is deeply in debt, trying to save up the $800,000 she'll need for an efficiency. When one comes open, she jumps at the chance--but thanks to an act-of-god style timing mishap, she misses an appointment with the sellers and they tell her agent they're thinking of offering the apartment to someone else. This would be a spoiler if every major review, the movie's press packet, etc. hadn't all spelled it out before me: Lai-sheung snaps, breaks into the building, and starts killing people in order to get her hands on that apartment. The real estate game in Hong Kong really <em>is</em> that deadly.

The movie, the first for Ho's production company 852 Films, came out to mixed reviews that all said basically the same thing I was thinking while I watched it: there are two halves to this movie, the gore film and the satire on Hong Kong real estate, and the two don't mesh all that well. I think a lot of this has to do the the confusing time-shifting I mentioned in the plot synopsis; had that been handled a little better, this probably would have been a stronger movie than it is. Once you understand what's going on there, things come together and the movie picks up; maybe by telling you what's going on from the outset I'll have made it so you will get more out of the first half-hour-ish of this movie than you otherwise would. ***",1332979200,,2455,4.626146788990826
4525664,4,B0051PLR24,"This is supposedly based on a real case but it seems the producers took the basic story and turned it into a gore fest.

Here's the scoop. Real estate in Honk Kong is outrageously expensive. Cheng Lai is working 3 jobs to buy a place that is way above what she can afford so she adopts a peculiar scheme to bring the price of the unit down.

This may be a true crime type thriller but a lot of time is spent on the details of some horribly brutal killings. Watching this film will give you a good idea of how gruesome, and protracted, death by suffocation really is. And you'll be surprised at how long someone can live with his guts sitting in his lap. And I was truly surprised at how a bed slat can be inserted in someone's mouth and still not kill them. Wonders abound here believe me.

This populates (I suppose) the WTF school of film making. I watched this and couldn't quite believe what I was seeing. It was a good story idea and it was put together well in the sense of writing, directing, effects etc. but I couldn't help but wonder what it would have been like had those involved taken a higher road. Did I really need to see this stuff?!

This is for gore hounds. Though it ends on an odd, but real, socio-economic note, don't think you're getting anything deep here. You're in it for the blood and there's plenty to go around. I can't fault it for it's execution. It does what it does with aplomb. Just know, up front, what you're in for.",1329350400,3,1452,4.25
4525665,5,B0051PLR24,"I love a great, gory movie, and this one is a true bloodbath. Our slasher, Cheng, is bound and determined to obtain a flat in Hong Kong's ridiculously overpriced real estate market, with her preferred view of Victoria Harbor. Her story is not told in sequential order, but you'll come to learn Cheng does find her ideal flat, only to be horribly devastated when the stock market fluctuates, and the sellers raise the price far out of her financial means, and thus compelling her into a murderous rampage. Her methods are calculated, extremely explicit and even misogynistic. The scene with the pregnant woman in particular is as brutal as it is tragic. It becomes obvious that no sacrifice is too great to accomplish her ultimate goal. This is absolutely not a movie for those with weak stomachs, as the scenes in the ""party"" apartment are by far the most vicious and savage I've ever seen - and I'm a HUGE slasher movie fan, so I'm not too easily shocked. I'll leave you with two words: PENILE AMPUTATION",1328054400,2,1005,4.68361581920904
