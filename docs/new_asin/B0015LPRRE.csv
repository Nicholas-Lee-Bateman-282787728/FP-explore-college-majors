8259005,2,B0015LPRRE,"Guess I didn't read the description very good, this is not the nine part series, just paid $50.00 for a 116 min movie. And this was a used movie, once again I got ripped off from the cancer industry.",1493164800,5,199,4.128205128205129
8259006,1,B0015LPRRE,"AFTER FOUR HOURS - WHEW!  An overemphasis on being a victim.  Very little on life style comparisons on which populations are most likely OR unlikely o get cancer.  Minuscule discussions of the role of optimum nutrition in preventing cancer. No mention of The China Study by Dr. Campbell. How useful are ""Run for the Cure"" events promoted by Susan G. Konen. DUH.",1409788800,10,361,4.790322580645161
8259007,1,B0015LPRRE,"Don't waste your time or money purchasing this.  The info is so far from the Truth.  The truth about cancer is that it can be beat without using surgery, chemo or radiation.  I thought this might shed some light on new and upcoming alternative treatments - couldn't have been more outdated and traditional.......more slash, burn and poison!",1409788800,16,340,4.9298245614035086
8259008,5,B0015LPRRE,"Excellent.  PBS, as always, did a great job following families in various stages of treatment.  Helpful in understanding cancer from the patient's (and family) point of view.",1269388800,4,174,5.407407407407407
8259009,5,B0015LPRRE,"This is a very intimate portrait of people living with, fighting and eventually dying of cancer.  There is such fear associated with the word cancer and a stigma associated with the many diseases of mutations in our cells we label cancer. Although strides have been made through early detection and early treatment of some types of cancers and researchers have developed various drugs and treatments to extend the life expectancy of persons with cancer, we are still in the earliest stages of understanding what and why our cells begin and keep multiplying uncontrollably and then spread to other parts of the body. The realistic hope is that someday if not a cure, we may be able to treat cancer as just a chronic disease that is managed and controlled the same as other conditions. A panel of cancer survivors who are physicians are interviewed by Linda Ellerbee who is also a cancer survivor. This would be a wonderful documentary for all health care professionals who work with people with cancer to see.  It is presented from the perspective of the person and family of those with cancer and follows four patients over time.  As was pointed out at the end of the program, if you are under the age of 80 right now, the chances are good that you will have cancer in your lifetime.  It is thought-provoking and a very good documentary from the perspective of the person with the disease.",1246838400,12,1389,4.7272727272727275
8259010,4,B0015LPRRE,"I believe strongly that educating yourself about cancer is one of the best ways to prevent it, treat it, and make it less scary.  This video taught me a lot.  First, it reminded me that we aren't out of the woods yet.  Cancer is still deadly, though many people are surviving (myself included).  The video talks a great deal about fears of death and the attitude one must take about cancer.  Can you be fighting cancer and still be well?  I believe you can.  I will be adding this video to my library and plan to share it with the college students I teach.",1241049600,10,556,4.288461538461538
