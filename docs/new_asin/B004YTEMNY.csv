4503378,4,B004YTEMNY,"Bought this release not expecting much but it was cheap if it was watchable. To my supprise it was not to bad concidering that it was made in 1958 spreading into 1959 this set of non restored gathered from tv were not to bad. This is in fact my second try at posting a review. For anyone intrested its packaged well even has an fbi warning at the start all episodes have no titles just Yancey Dirrenger the adds have all been removed from disc one save for a Johnsons add and the vouce over with the closing credits having said all this I can hardly wait to get the rest of the series up till now I have a box oif unwatchable copies this at least you can watch and enjoy go ahead and get it.

4503389,5,B004YTEMNY,"This 17 episode DVD is very good.  There are some quality issues with a few of the episodes but most play very well.  I remember this show from childhood and wanted to watch it as an adult.  It exceded my expectations.

I believe, if I remember correctly from IMDb, the episodes are not in chronological order, but that doesn't matter.  The main characters are involved in most episodes and there is not much change in the development of the characters over the span of the series.

I can't wait on the remaining 17 episodes to come out.",1332547200,,537,4.484536082474227
4503390,5,B004YTEMNY,"When I first watched this series years ago I couldn't decide on whom I had the biggest crush -- Yancy Derringer or his Pawnee blood brother, Pahoo.  It's hard to choose between a man who sports a cane and a derringer up his sleeve and one who has a sawed-off shotgun hidden under a shoulder blanket.  So when this new two-disc set came out I was delighted to renew my aquaintance with these two men and the post-Civil War New Orleans they inhabit.  These are fun stories to watch.  Good prevails over evil and there is just enough larceny in Yancy to keep the episodes from becoming saccarine sweet.  Hopefully more episodes will be released in the future.",1331769600,,656,4.52542372881356
4503391,5,B004YTEMNY,"I recall liking this series as a kid and looking at these episodes confirms my long held opinion. The series didn't last long but is was different from the standard western fare at the time, taking palce in New Orleans after the civil war. More sophisticated I'd say, with a bit of wit. Our hero was a dashing young gentleman with a bit of larceny in his sole. The presentation leaves something to be desired, however. I'd rate the picture and sound watchable, but just barely. An awful lot of the stories take place after dark and picture doesn't offer much in gradation from black to white. Jock Mohoney was great as the civil war vet and his silent indian companion added further interest. So recommend the content - highly, but image on the screen is just not that good. Now if someone could get ahold of the entire series and remaster them for todays TV's, I'd be a buyer willing to pay a premium.",1331683200,4,902,4.472727272727273

4503393,4,B004YTEMNY,"I was extreamly happy to locate this old TV classic from my childhood.  If I could change anything, that would be to have this copy re-mastered.  Considering the age of the series, I am glad to have it as is.  EPW",1324598400,,213,4.146341463414634
4503394,5,B004YTEMNY,"There it is, ""Yancy Derringer"", my favorite TV series of all times. Since I was a child growing up in German and watching ""Yancy Derringer"" in 1967, I was dreaming of going to New Orleans.
I'm lucky that I was able to get all 34 episodes from ioffer dot com 3 years ago, but would love to replace my bootleg version by a commercial DVD set with the entire series.
I wonder how much longer it will take?

I also enjoyed ""Checkmate"", although I liked ""Honey West"" and ""Bourbon Street"" even more. Then there was ""M Squad"" which was almost as good as ""The Detectives"" (Robert Taylor) and I never missed an episode. At school everybody talked about ""M Squad"" and ""The Detectives"" on the next day. I think there is a large Baby Boomer potential for selling/releasing more of these classic TV series.

Many of those who loved the ""Lassie"", ""Flipper"", ""Fury"" and ""Gentle Ben"" TV series in their childhood also liked ""Kentucky Jones"" (Dennis Weaver) and ""The Farmer's Daughter"" (Inger Stevens). I wish these two wonderful old TV series and many others like ""A Man called Shenandoah"" (Robert Horton), ""Hank"" (Dick Kallman), ""He and She"" (Paula Prentiss), ""The Magic Boomerang"", ""The Greatest Show on Earth"" (Jack Palance) would finally be released on DVD.",1323820800,4,1245,4.786046511627907

4503398,5,B004YTEMNY,"Years back I looked into finding a Yancy Derringer episode. The only information I got at that time was that the quality of the film was too poor to copy. Recently, I did another search and found this set. I was thrilled. I ordered it immediately and played it the moment I received it. It was everything I hoped for. The picture quality was better than I thought it would be. I was a very happy camper.",1316563200,12,403,4.246753246753247
8448834,5,B004YTEMNY,"Enjoyed watching this show as first-run when I was 4 or 5 years old.  I liked that Yancy had a derringer and was suave.  After years of pinging the internet, my patience and diligence was rewarded and reinforced memories from so long ago.",1379203200,,238,4.511627906976744

It's a B&W show and the acting is not up to par with today's acting but that was the 50's. Anyone who was a teen in the 50's will love memories of the hidden derringer's and his sidekick with the big knife and shotgun.",1360022400,,327,3.823529411764706

8448838,4,B004YTEMNY,"I watched this show on television with my dad when I was a little boy in the late '50s.  It's a thrill for me to watch it again and it's like watching a new show now since I haven't seen this show in over 50 years.  For those of us who were raised in the '50s, '60s & '70s when TV westerns were all the rage this is a wonderful blast from our past.  It was a very inovative show and is still a good watch.  I would highly recommend this to anybody who misses the golden age of western television.",1350345600,,496,3.881188118811881

8448843,5,B004YTEMNY,"I remember watching this as a boy when it was first broadcast on TV -- and that goes back a ways. More importantly I remember how much I enjoyed the series. I've tried to find it for several years. It's been hard to locate except for very poor copies of 3 VHS tapes -- that is until now. I wasn't sure if I'd be as thrilled to have it once I got it but the jury is in and I can declare this series is still a hit with me.
  Why? First off, it's a different setting for a ""western"". It takes place in New Orleans, just after the Civil War. Then there's the main character, Yancy Derringer. Great name and the character is well played by Jock Mahoney, former stunt man turned TV star.
  Yancy is the kind of hero who doesn't play by the rules of typical heroes in westerns -- certainly not of that day. He more closely resembles Paladin in Have Gun, Will Travel. Both series have an edginess to them that I really enjoy. The stories themselves still hold up very well as good scripts with some nice twists in them -- not always so predictable. Adding to this is the more adult approach to the the world Yancy lives in -- He's a gambler, a ladies man, a bit of rougue if he needs to be. Plus with all that he has a great partner and friend -- an Indian who doesn't speak but is Yancy's life long friend,a guy who literally has his back and saves his bacon more than once. The Character he plays -- and it's a long name, not easy for me to remember, has a strength and a prescence that is a tribute to the actor who played him, X Brands. Yep, you read that right. In the TV credits that how his name is listed. Without him the series would be lacking a great element-and a very significant one.
  To sum it up, this DVD collection, though far from being pristeen in quality due to the transfer, is worth every bit of the money I paid for it. If you enjoy Have Gun, Will Travel then you'll enjoy this series, I'm almost certain of that.",1333324800,,1931,4.108753315649867
