Dust and Drouth Sweep Southwest is the headline on The Sageville Banner. Rancher ask for US aid. Cattlemen fight for water. The water company calls the Sheriff for support. Roy stops two riders. Can they open a valve to release water? Yes. Can the Sheriff stop them? No. Roy is arrested. There is a song. They ride into town. The Mayor greets Roy, then fines him for trespassing. There is a political meeting. Who is the peoples friend? They vote to send Roy Rogers to Congress, he is a hero to the people. The water used to be free before the Water Company grabbed it. [No history here.] Roy sings a sentimental song. But he cant campaign without money for advertising. Or can he? Roy wants the water rates cut by 75%.

Rogers will get Federal aid for the ranchers and farmers. Mr. Fairbanks offers Roy a deal if he drops out of the race. Congressman Scully will change his dress to appeal to the voters. A ringing bell causes Scullys horse to bolt! Rogers is elected. He will need Congressman Marlowes help to pass his bill. Marlowe will be at a fox hunt Saturday. Roy and Frog show up. Roy is told how things work in Washington; he throws a party. Roy tells of the effects of the drought. Two children died for dust pneumonia; others lost all and moved away. A song tells about the conditions from a lack of rain. Rogers gets the support he asked for - if conditions are that bad. Fairbanks is opposed. But Rogers admits the photos were from another state. A telegram revealed this to the Congressman!

Their personal tour is interrupted, but the Congressman sees the dry conditions. Water is scarce. The wind creates a dust storm! They seek shelter. Then they learn how Roy planned these events (except the dust storm). The Water Bill will be approved. But ranchers are riding to blow up the dam. This will lose government support. Roy must stop them. A telephone call warns the water company; their guards fire on the approaching riders. The riders release a dynamite wagon, but Rogers halts this danger. A bell sends Frogs horse running away.

This combines conflicts over water rights with singing (like some operas). Roy Rogers as Congressman knows how to tell the people what they need to know (his father was a Congressman). It reminds you that the Governments job is to protect the people from adverse conditions, whether from nature, big corporations, or other enemies of the people. The Southwest is a dry semi-desert. Drought is a recurring problem in this area. The singing and comedy do not mask its serious subject.",1468195200,,2564,4.653421633554084

Our story line and plot, In his starring debut Roy (Roy Rogers) gets elected to congress in order to bring water to the ranchers in his district --- In Washington he learns he needs the backing of a key congressman and gets that man to go west for an inspection trip --- When the Congressman is initially unimpressed, Roy gets the inspection party stranded without water to show the true conditions --- Songs include ""Dust,"" ""Send My Mail To The County Jail,"" ""Back In The Backwoods,"" ""Rogers For Congressman,"" and ""When A Cowboy Sings A Song."" --- This was Roy Rogers' first starring vehicle for Republic Pictures, and it made him an instant hit, billed ever after as ""King of the Cowboys"" --- This picture even got an Oscar nomination, for the song Dust for Best Song of 1938. The rather more well known Thanks for the Memory was the winner that year. But Dust is a highly dramatic item, sung by Roy as he's narrating a newsreel he put together about the dust bowl conditions in the west.
