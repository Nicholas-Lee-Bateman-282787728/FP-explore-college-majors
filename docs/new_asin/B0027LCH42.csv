8354870,3,B0027LCH42,"[DEATH CARRIES A CANE - Directed by Maurizio Pradeaux - Fullscreen Presentation]  A decent but fairly pedestrian giallo film rendered flaccid by bad English dubbing and a German film print that's washed out in spots and lacks contrast. Unfortunately, it's the only NTSC version available, so we'll have to make do. It's nowhere near as good as Luciano Ercoli's 'Death Walks at Midnight' or 'Death Walks in High Heels', which also star the attractive Susan Scott AKA Nieves Navarro.

Kitty (Susan Scott) is a photographer living in Rome, and earns extra cash snapping pics of tourists, and one day accidentally witnesses the murder of a young woman at the hands of a razor-wielding black-gloved killer, the hallmark of all gialli. Kitty and her fianc (Robert Hoffmann) report this incident to the police only to learn that two other witnesses have also been victimized by the slasher. Kitty knows that she will become the next victim unless she finds and discloses the killer first. The only real clue she has is that the madman walks with a limp and requires a cane. Unfortunately, her ballerina friend Magda next falls prey to the elusive murderer as he closes in on Kitty as time ticks louder and louder, the killer getting nearer and nearer...

Susan Scott lends credibility and a fair share of nudity to keep things chugging along, but this film would benefit greatly from a decent Italian print with English subtitles. There are no extended credits, so I couldn't even tell  who the director was or what the year of production was - I know, I know, that's why we have access to the IMDB, but is it too much to ask to have a proper credit sequence? The ending isn't a huge surprise, anyone can feign a limp and use a cane, but if you are a fan of giallo films, you'll eventually want to see this one too - we're gluttons for entertainment, and punishment as well. 3  stars for the flick, reduced to 3 stars for the print.",1314748800,,1925,4.65
