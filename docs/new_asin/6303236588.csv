7841670,3,6303236588,"Plot is a good thing with this movie. It's entertaining and worth the price of the video/DVD. It's about a couple working together to legally rob his friend. And it's a good idea with a little twist on the ending that's pretty clever. 'The friend' comes out ahead and clean. The Spader Sex is good and it's filmed well with colors that seem dark. The bad thing about this movie is it's dream sequences: they are 100% dumb;  I cannot figure out a reason for them. Viewers understand 'the friend' - Spader - the Dream Lover is living a dream...and we can SEE that it's becoming a nightmare, we don't need foolish clowns cut-ins to bop us on the heads and say, ""DREAM!"" I personaly find it a tad bit unbeliveable that a hot, sweet Sexy Spader would not be the 'dream' of any woman. The female lead in this movie is beautiful. Watch it.",1130716800,2,832,4.367741935483871
7841671,5,6303236588,"Here is a quietly intriguing obscurity starring James Spader as lonely divorcee Ray Reardon, an architect looking to build a relationship.

 A little too conveniently, Ray meets Lena Mathers, played by a convincingly mysterious Maedchen Amick (more recently seen in ""The List"").  Lena not so accidently bumps into Ray at a party, where he's been set up with a desperately shrill loser he is trying to politely ditch.  After a hostile first meet due to a spilled drink, Ray sees Lena again at the local market, and there begins the end of a uneventful lonely life for Ray Reardon.

 After a few dates, and some artful and acrobatic lovemaking scenes worthy of a ""Kamma Sutra"" addendum, the couple marries in a passionate whirlwind.  (Incidently, I read that James Spader worked out heavily for the explicit nude scenes, and I must say, it was worth it to watch the film for that alone).  After Ray makes Lena Mrs. Reardon, she soon has his baby, after which, some suspicions arise.  It seems that the ""Dream Lover"" of the title, is not the same inside, as the ""petite dark and beautiful"" facade Ray assumed to be genuine through and through.  Things aren't adding up, and soon Spader's Ray becomes insecure, anxious and riddled with jealousy.  He sets out on a mission to clarify the facts, and alleviate the doubts.  Does Ray accomplish this daunting task?  You'll have to see for yourself.

 As always, the softly handsome Spader, a personal favorite, makes a terrific victim for the stronger,  more devious personality, much like in Curtis Hansons ""Bad Influence""(see my review), or against rival John Cusack in ""True Colors"".  We find ourselves rooting for Ray, even when he does things he shouldn't, because we are sympathetic to how he's been duped.  Maedchen Amick is worthy of Hitchcockian ice-princess status as Lena Mathers, (although Hitchcocks were invariably blondes).  She is darkly forboding, and deliciously sexy in her ingenious seduction of Ray.  She hooks him with seemingly well practiced expertise, only to turn into an evil witch, thus ruining any ""Ray"" of hope for the fairy tale meeting and marriage.

 As far as the subject of endings go, this one left me a bit puzzled.  I'm not sure I buy it, but that's only my opinion.  Let's face it, the story plot is not terribly original, yet somehow, it comes off that way regardless.

  One thing is certain, ""Dream Lover"" is a very interesting character study, and a quietly sexy noir thriller that will not disappoint, particularly for those who enjoy the sympathetic character performances of James Spader.",1021852800,83,2576,4.916473317865429
7841672,5,6303236588,"Anyone with an eclectic, imaginative mind should see this movie. James Spader convincingly portrays a lovelorn architect, Ray Reardon, in search of his ultimate soulmate, his ""dream lover"". Suddenly she appears and she's everything she first appears to be - until he starts to 'peel the onion to find layers, and more layers.'
Madchen Amick also does a splendid job portraying Lena Mathers Reardon. The object of Spader's attraction and ideal dream lover.
I won't say more because I don't want to give away the plot, but it is definitely a well written movie.",993600000,8,559,4.957446808510638
7841673,5,6303236588,"this movie is awesome.  not the typical ""he loves her, but she doesn't love him; he does something that touches her heart; she loves him now, and the end"" kind of movie.  you should love this movie if you love movies that are original and creative.  the movie is about James Spader looking for his dream lover, and that's all that i am going to tell you.",988502400,,354,4.253731343283582
