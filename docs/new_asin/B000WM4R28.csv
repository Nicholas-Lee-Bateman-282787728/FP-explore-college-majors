8223661,3,B000WM4R28,"Quick side note - my copy DID have subtitles, so not sure why some
seem to not...

A sweet, interesting mix of gritty, hand-held street style film-making,
with a much more Hollywood story - a melodrama about girl singing group
trying to make it, and get out of the ghetto

Ultimately a little thin on the character and emotional level for me,
although I'll take it over a Hollywood bio-pic any day. But clich's
are clich's, even if they're handled with more energy and panache than
usual. You can see a lot of twists and conflicts coming a mile off.

Also, some of the acting is pretty stiff - it feels like weak
improvisation. Per several articles on the film, the women were picked
for singing ability (which is very high, great voices!) first, and
acting second.

Most of the songs are terrific, a few are a little lame.

Bottom line, while not a great film,
if you're interested in the subject, it's worth seeing.",1283558400,,917,4.533333333333333

Free or not, it is a HUGE waste of my time trying to watch this movie.  This was a Bonehead ""special"" offer.",1259625600,3,255,4.270833333333333
