8590238,3,B0000C52EH,"Bar to Bar 2002 was pretty lack-luster.  I'm a pretty hard-core fan, but the only reason I keep the discs around is to have a documentary of the season.  There are parts to the 2 disc set that are absolutely and utterly stupid i.e. slide show with music.
Redemption...? Clear Channel stepped it up with Bar to Bar 2003.  I would give it four stars.  The press conference coverage makes the difference! Seeing the SLC press conference made Bar to Bar 2003 worth every penny.",1073606400,,473,4.529411764705882
