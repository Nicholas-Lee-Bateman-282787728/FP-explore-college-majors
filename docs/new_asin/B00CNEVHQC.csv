8583774,5,B00CNEVHQC,"This Movie To Me Was More Like A Recap And At The Beginning of the film they just talked about The previas people and what had happened to them since the last film. I thought that is was a sad thing to hear the out comes to many of are black youths ending up dead or in jail for life its not even funny this is a tragedy. then later on in the film I thought that they would talk about something else and it was more of the same, then out of no were comes the end and an advertisement for hood to hood 4 coming soon. still think is was a great film just wish there was a positive side to all of the madness that's all. recommend to all who like the first 2 films.",1375142400,,662,3.8043478260869565
8583775,2,B00CNEVHQC,"My mistake....I ordered this not fully knowing what it was. I thought it was like the show ""Gangland"", or a similar type of crime documentary. Its not even close, its a man with a camera going from city to city asking anyone on a street corner ""what grimey stuff happens out here"". It goes on ,and on, ....and on. I see no point to purpose to what the filmmakers actually doing here. Local thugs will tell you about how they make money, get women, deal dope,go to prison etc. Most segments have a follow up of r.i.p , or currently serving time in prison. I only got about an hour deep into this dvd until I reached complete boredom. The city/neighborhood I grew up in is on here. I know this part of society exists, but like I said I fail to see what the filmmakers purpose of making this is. I doubt the people in the flick even see a dime for there involvement. If you're from the suburbs or are living out your ""I wanna be a gangster"" life this is probably for you.... if not, pass on this one.",1374278400,5,997,4.197916666666667
