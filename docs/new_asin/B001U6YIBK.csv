3796782,5,B001U6YIBK,Great selection of WWII movies. Very good quality. Some well know movies and some less well known. Excellent to add to your collection. Lots of extras included.,1342483200,,160,4.962962962962963
3796783,5,B001U6YIBK,"This is a very nice package and is worth the price.  There are 20 discs -- each movie has a bonus disc -- some of the bonus discs have extensive extra material, others do not -- just trailers and such. I am giving it 5 stars for the content.

Unfortunately, 3 of the discs were bad and would not play all the way through.

The Sand Pebbles has a double-sided bonus disc. I could not play the side which has the ""extended roadshow version.""

The Great Escape movie disc and the Platoon bonus disc had flaws which made the content freeze part-way through.  I tried each of the defective discs on a Sony, Pioneer and Toshiba DVD player -- and then on the computer.  Same result each time.

Amazon is good about returns.  Just a warning -- be sure to play all of these discs through within your return period.  Hopefully, I just got some bad discs and it's not a problem for most or all sets.",1339804800,3,888,4.269461077844311
3796784,5,B001U6YIBK,"This item is perfect for a gift for any person interested in a very well presented ""Anthology of War on Film Collection"" which includes some of the greatest War films ever made.
The item is spread across a total of 20 Discs, 10 Movies in total, each movie is region locked to Region 1, so if you're an international buyer make sure you have a Region Free DVD Player.

The collection of 10 Movies contains a mixture of Special Editions, Collectors Editions or your Standard movie, however all movies are 2 Disc's each.
The majority of the Special and Collector Edition movies come with some form of Bonus / Extra content, some more than others, it really depends on whether it's a Standard Edition or a Special / Collectors Edition, however you are guaranteed to find some interesting content that you would normally find on a DVD in that category, the only exception is ""Patton"" which is the only Standard Edition movie in the Anthology collection.

With the intention to provide potential buyers a brief glimpse of how well some of these movies were received by critics and information regarding the films I will break down the movies that this Anthology contains, separating them into the contained various editions and providing the IMDB (Internet Movie Database) rating in the hope that people can get a sense of how highly rated certain films in this collection stand, I'll also include the IMDB link which will give you more information regarding each film, reviews and a brief synopsis. The list is as follows.

Overall ""Anthology of War on Film Collection"" contains classic films that you will enjoy, especially if you love older movies based on War.
My only gripe was the price, you can find most of these DVD's at the $5 to $10 price range so don't overpay for this collection, however as of writing this Amazon is currently providing a lightning deal on this Collection and I'm purchasing another as a gift.",1339459200,17,2641,4.8061674008810575
3796785,5,B001U6YIBK,"This is a great collection of some of the best war films ever made and 130 bucks for 10 movies is a great deal. My only complaint is that ""All quiet on the western front"" is not included",1295568000,9,186,3.9210526315789473

3796787,5,B001U6YIBK,I've only watched two of the ten films and they were both great.  I was surprised and pleased at how well the films were packaged in a nice solid book with pictures and extra discs showing additional features for each of the films in the anthology.  Really a professional job.  Thank you.,1458691200,,288,4.5
3796788,5,B001U6YIBK,So far I have only watched the Battle of Britain and I have seen all the including films before.  It's just a good deal and the packaging is interesting.,1456963200,,153,4.275862068965517
3796789,5,B001U6YIBK,Great collection of film.  Gave one set to my brother and husband; both of whom love it.  War II story films.  Great productions based on what is produced typically today in front of green screens and computer enhancements.,1456617600,,223,4.815789473684211

Even though all have probably been seen on TV a lot, it is well worth it to me to have a nice picture and ""no"" commercials..If you find a set for less than a $20 total grab it while you can. The best collection I have ever seen.",1375142400,5,333,3.8405797101449277
3796796,4,B001U6YIBK,I purchased this collection for my father and he was a fan of many of the films included in the collection. There's nothing bad about what's in the collection but when I read the description I did originally believe it included 20 different films. Thank you for the posts assisting with that clarification and I took the 1 star off for that confusing advertisement.,1349049600,3,365,4.71875
8342967,5,B001U6YIBK,I loved the background analyses and I love the movies.  The only problem I had was with the dvd of the movie 12 o'clock high itself.  It ame out pf the package scratched and i had to skip some of the scenes to see most of the movie.  All the others were fine.  I m going to let customer service know about this.,1500681600,,311,3.888888888888889
8342968,1,B001U6YIBK,"Cool looking set. Waited eagerly to receive it. When it arrived, as I took it from the box, I noticed many little scratches on the first disc but I put it into the player and started watching Twelve O'Clock High...at chapter 16, the disc froze. I tried 3 different players but still freezing at the same point so I tried the next movie The Longest Day. There were no scratches on the disc but that played until chapter 18 and froze so I tried next movie The Great Escape. It played awesomely but the next movie was Von Ryan's Express and it froze up at chapter 16. Sand Pebbles froze up at chapter 20 and that's when I finally stopped trying to watch a complete movie. I returned the set. If you order, check all discs immediately for problems. I tried 3 different players on all discs and they froze on all of them. A production problem is the likely culprit that turned my viewing experience into a frozen wasteland.",1490054400,,918,4.405882352941177
