8569961,5,B00BKE4N08,"If you were a kid growing up in the Midwest during the 1960s, you probably remember the television set (your family probably had only one) was off-limits between noon and 1:30 every weekday, because your mother faithfully tuned-in to Ruth Lyons.  The Ruth Lyons Show (AKA the 50-50 Club) was on channel 2 in Dayton, channel 4, Columbus---13 was the channel in Indianapolis - - - and the whole thing originated live on channel 5, Cincinnati (O-hi-o).  Ruth Lyons dominated mid-day television in middle America  via the regional AVCO network, and Ruth was a household name.  The Lyons' show was so ubiquitous that you probably recalled most of her personally-pitched sponsors.  And, if your mother was like most, she probably trusted Ruth enough to give that product a try, at least one time.  Ruth was a sales powerhouse, such that sponsors gladly joined the waiting list, just to have the opportunity to get air-time on her show.

This first-rate documentary is an excellent biography of the broadcast life of Ruth Lyons.  The DVD documentary features a well-structured narrative with top notch video-audio production.  After just one viewing (and it is worth watching more than once),  it will be easy for you to understand how the audience of a Cincinnati theater erupted into a standing ovation at the conclusion of the documentary's  premiere.

If you grew up in the Ohio-Kentucky-Indiana region during the 60s this is an essential document of local history.  I would be willing to bet you will find more than one or two things you had forgotten, and you will probably learn a lot about Ruth and her show.  This is a piece of local history that belongs in the library of anyone interested in Cincinnati and its environs in the early-to-mid 1960s.",1387929600,5,1750,4.888135593220339
