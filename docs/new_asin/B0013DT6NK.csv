8250374,5,B0013DT6NK,"This is one of those sleeper episodes where you think, ""Wow, this is going to be boring.""  However, when you learn about the oddities of water compared to other compounds in the universe, it's really a cool topic.  Every kid in high school should be able to see this and get a better handle of how water is involved with everything on the earth.",1435708800,,345,4.375

8250376,3,B0013DT6NK,"Humans are 70% water, as is 70% of the earth's surface.  However, only 2.5% of the earth's water is fresh, and only about 1% of that is available (eg. not tied up in ice caps).

Bottled water was a big U.S. industry in the year 1900 - however, it nearly was driven out of business by a process developed in 1913 for chlorinating tap water and making it safe to drink.  The industry made a recovery beginning in the 1970s, though today about 25% of bottled water (including those made by Coca-Cola and Pepsi) comes from further filtering and sanitizing tap water.

Venice created the first sand filtration system for water, but its lead was not followed throughout Europe.  Instead, most Europeans drank low-alcohol beer - just enough to kill organisms.

Water's high surface tension allows bugs and paperclips to float/walk on water.

One out of every 6,600 water atoms has a neutron included in the Hydrogen atom (heavy water).  Thus, 2,000 tons of water can produce 2 oz. of deuterium.  Deuterium is valuable because it slows neutrons (rather than absorbing them) and allows nuclear fission power generation with unenriched uranium.

The speed of sound is 5X faster in water - allowing whales to communicate over hundreds of miles.

U.S. farmers irrigate 50 million acres, using 405 of our available fresh water.  A 130-acre pivot-point irrigation system typically revolves once every three days; sensors align each segment.  Gravity irrigation is used for 60% of irrigation, though it is requires more water than a center-point system.  Some believe only 20% of our underground water will remain by 2020.

An acre of corn transpires 4,000 gallons of water/day.

""Water"" then provides background explaining the artistic fountains at the Bellagio Hotel in Las Vegas.

Finally, ""Water"" tells us that one of Saturn's moons shoots water up some 250 miles, presumably due to underground volcanic heat.",1223769600,3,1898,5.032051282051282
