1784310,5,B00006LA87,"Martin Buber taught that we should never treat anyone in an abstract and distant I-It manner. The great philosopher instead advocated I-Thou relationships between ourselves and those who interact with us even in minor ways.  Nonetheless, Buber might have changed his mind had he ever met Sy Parrish (Robin Williams).  The one hour photo technician desires far more intimacy with his customers than is psychologically healthy and normally desirable.  Sy is a loser who bewilderingly is content earning a mediocre income as a store clerk/film developer for a large discount chain store.  He looks upon this pathetic job as a serious vocation instead of one barely paying a few cents above minimum wage.  The only fault I could find in this great five star film is the portrayal of Sy as somebody able to afford a nice car, live in a fairly large apartment, and eat out on a regular basis.  This is totally absurd.  In the real world a Sy would barely be able to pay for a cramped efficiency apartment and a beat up older automobile.
Sy focuses his unwanted attention onto the affluent and outwardly happy Yorkin family.  The young couple and their nine year old son have no idea that Sy's world revolves around their own lives.  We are sometimes tempted to turn our heads away from the screen while observing Sy embarrassingly making a fool of himself.  Robin Williams is uncannily brilliant as a warped human being with nothing going for himself.  And yes, Williams will almost certainly garner an Academy Award nomination for his brilliant interpretation of Sy.  Williams' recent work in Insomnia as similarly a creepy weirdo may also earn him a supporting role nomination.  Is it possible that Williams' earlier comedic roles will soon be forgotten?  Will Sy Parrish be to Williams as Norman Bates was to Tony Perkins?  Has Williams crossed a line in his career where there is no going back?",1030924800,3,1892,4.850467289719626
1784311,5,B00006LA87,"If you still had a doubt that Robin Williams could play a role of a psychopath, this movie will change all of that for you.  After seeing ""Insomnia,"" I was able to witness Williams break away from his traditional ""nice-guy/funny-guy"" roles and do some more serious and challenging roles.  So, when I heard about this movie, in where Williams once again takes on a challenging role of a frightening psychopath, I had no doubts or worries about him not being convincing.  ""One Hour Photo"" is a clever, unsettling, and unforgettable psychological thriller that is so brilliantly structured and layered that every little thing in the movie works.
Robin Williams gives a chilling performance as Sy Parrish, a lonely one hour photo worker who has become obsessed with a particular family over the years.  He has kept copies of their pictures for himself and fantasizes what it would be like to be a part of that family.  And when he gets the feeling that the husband is taking all of his good fortune for granted, Sy starts to feel nothing but hatred for the man and is willing to open his eyes.....by any means necessary.
The film was brilliantly written and directed.  The cinematography was outstanding, giving us a sense of emptiness and loneliness that Sy feels.  The acting is also something to see.  Boy, if you ever had doubts that Williams can play a frightening psychopath, this movie will easily change your mind.
What I admired most about the movie was the pace.  It wasn't fast, but very slow and subtle.  Now, this may be a major problem for some people, but the reason why the pace is so good and perfect is that as slow as it is, it's more frightening.  You slowly see Sy break away from reality and being capable of doing harm to others that pose a threat to him.  And this works because it is believable.  The movie would not be as convincing if it were transformed into a mindless slasher flick where Sy kills everyone in sight.  It's the subtle approach that really scares the hell out of us and makes us think, ""This could really happen.  There really are people like this.""
A great movie to compare this to is ""Taxi Driver,"" as many people have said.  That was a movie where De Niro's character didn't just break away from reality all at once.  It was a slow and subtle process.  And that's what made it that more disturbing and freaky.  If you enjoy that movie, than chances are you will like this one as well.
I really did enjoy this movie, as chilling and disturbing as it was.  ""One Hour Photo"" is a clever psychological thriller with all of the right elements.  I hope that Williams gets nominated for his role in this movie, if not for ""Insomnia.""  In fact, his ability to play a disturbed psycho really shines more in this particular movie than in ""Insomnia.""  Again, if pace is a problem for you, then you might as well just skip it, or just wait for it to come out to rent on DVD or video.  ""One Hour Photo"" definitely gets added to my list of ""Best Movies of 2002.""  It's suspenseful, chilling, frightening, and believable.  Like one of the earlier Amazon reviewers said, after seeing this movie, you might want to switch to digital film.  Who knows, there just might be another Sy Parrish handing you back your photos with an odd look on his face as he waves goodbye to you and says, ""Hope to see you again soon.""",1030924800,4,3340,4.523333333333333
1784312,5,B00006LA87,"Williams plays Sy Parrish, a colorless middle-aged bachelor employed by the Savmart discount  chain as a film processor in one of its store's ONE HOUR PHOTO department.  Sy has no life outside work, but lives vicariously through the pictures he develops for a steady customer, the Yorkin family.  Sy is particularly attracted to the family's young son, Jake (Dylan Smith), and the boy's mother, Nina (Connie Nielsen). Parrish's obsession is such that one wall of his apartment is completely covered with prints of the Yorkins snapped over the years. Sy fantasizes being part of the family - a favorite uncle, perhaps. This is all supremely creepy, but relatively harmless, until Sy discovers that the Man of the House, Will (Michael Vartan), is cheating on Nina. Things turn nasty. And what is Parrish going to do with that very large and very sharp hunting knife? (Russell Crowe's sword in GLADIATOR was only slightly larger.)
The performance by Williams deserves an Oscar nomination. His role in this film, and that of the killer in the recent INSOMNIA, proves Robin's ability as a dramatic actor (if anyone had any doubts). The creators of ONE HOUR PHOTO were particular clever in contrasting Sy's sterile, lonely life with that ""normal"" existence lived by the Yorkins. While the latter's residence is stocked with the usual Stuff, both Parrish's downtown apartment and his workspace are compulsively neat, impersonal and soulless under harsh florescent lighting. (You can almost hear the bulbs hum.) Even the general merchandise aisles of the Savmart are curiously unpopulated, and the goods on the perfectly arranged shelves look untouched by human hands. The pressures building in Sy's psyche can only be guessed at, and there's one dream sequence that has him suffering a serious mishap in one of the Savmart's aisles that left the audience gasping.
My only suggestion to improve ONE HOUR PHOTO would have been to totally eliminate the last scene in the police interview room. It seemed to me an unnecessary sop to the bleeding-heart philosophy that sometimes attempts to assign blame for one's actions on someone other than the doer. The film should have perhaps ended after the final scene in the Yorkin house.
See this movie, and seriously consider converting to digital photography. Come to think of it, the photo guy at our local discount outlet has been awfully twitchy lately. And he's been staring at me rather strangely while holding a box cutter.",1030838400,13,2463,5.076543209876543
1784313,4,B00006LA87,"Robin Williams carries this suspense film on his shoulders, playing an eerie role that may earn him an Oscar nomination.
Williams plays Sy ""The photo guy,"" a lonely man operating a one-hour photo lab who is obsessed with the seemingly perfect life of one particular family. Earning their trust, Sy secretly makes extra copies of all their photos for himself and begins to stalks them. At times, Sy's actions are so uncomfortable to watch you can't help but squirm in your seat. You don't want to watch anymore, yet can't tear your eyes from the screen. Williams nails this performance, even surpassing his role in Good Will Hunting, which earned him an Oscar.
Although the end of the film degrades a bit by replacing much of the suspense with routine action and over explaining things in the resolution, it still maintains an edge over many other suspense films. Mostly thanks to William's chilling character.
In another plus, One Hour Photo realistically portrays the photo lab, Williams narrates the chemical processes, creating metaphors for his obsession with the family life. As an amateur photographer, I appreciate the accuracy this film exhibits, as many films don't realistically portray dark rooms and photo labs.
This is a great thriller you probably don't want to watch alone. And may make you think twice about getting your photos developed at your neighborhood one hour photo.",1030752000,,1390,5.047826086956522
1784314,5,B00006LA87,"After viewing this particular film, it made me think of the person behind the counter of the one hour photo. Perhaps he or she is learing into to my life or perhaps into my soul. The superb acting of Robin Williams in this film probably made others who have seen this movie ponder the same idea. If you're looking to be ""creeped out"" in a more subtle way than is offered in today's stereotypical horror movies, try and see this movie, it'll be one you won't soon forget.
Peace!",1030406400,5,477,4.370786516853933
1784315,5,B00006LA87,"Much of the attention this film receives will likely focus on Robin William's performance as Sy, a lonely, middle-aged man who works at the photo booth of a chain department store in what looks like California.  Williams has turned in a melange of performances in twenty years: some gripping, and some cliche.  He's good at extroverted bursts of energy; he can also soften his eyes and wrap himself around your heart.  This, however, is his finest hour.  He completely departs from his previous characters and creates a character that is fully realized, multi-dimensional, and psychologically on-target.  It his breakthrough performance as a serious actor.
It would be a shame, however, not to notice that this is also a very well-made film.  A very sad but all-too-familiar story about loneliness and social isolation unfolds at a compelling pace, with a script that resists patronizing its subject or sensationalizing it.  We have no choice but to notice the use of color to distinguish worlds; the flat, washed-out landscape in which Sy is imprisoned, and the lush, brilliant hues of the family life he aches for.
As events unfold, we stick to Sy's personal tragedy and his rage rather than follow standard horror-movie cliches, making the suspense and the horror genuine and harrowing.  Do not less this one pass by.",1030233600,89,1320,5.050691244239632
1784316,5,B00006LA87,One Hour Photo...a masterpiece film. Robin Williams performance is amazing. It would be a crime if he is not nominated for best actor. Williams is by far one of the best actors for this type of movie. Mark Romanek creates a visual work of art out of this lonely person turned psycho film. Greatest movie of all time.,1029974400,,316,4.4655172413793105
1784317,4,B00006LA87,"Robin Williams expands his repertoire further in ""One Hour Photo"", this time playing an outwardly pleasant, inwardly strange  and lonely photo technician who takes quite an interest in the lives of his customers.  Over the years he comes to know them, their houses and pursuits.  He sees their children growing from the many rolls taken during infancy, through childhood birthdays and outings.
  He takes a special interest in the Yorkin family, and when he makes a discovery that stabs at his heart, he becomes so upset and distracted that he loses his job.  In the ensuing action, more secrets are revealed.

This first half of this film is extremely well done, building your interest in the characters through vignettes of ordinary life.  The second half rather deteriorates into an ""action movie"", but the suspense carries you along until the final frame. Williams is superb in ""One Hour Photo"".  Recommended as blend of chick-flick and action.",1028764800,4,948,5.064516129032258
1784318,5,B00006LA87,"WOW, I WISH ROBIN WILLIAMS WOULD TAKE MORE CHALLENGING ROLES LIKE THIS ONE. COMPARISONS TO HIS LOW KEY PERFORMANCE IN ""WORLD ACCORDING TO GARP"" ARE NOT OUT OF PLACE. WILLIAMS DOES NOT PLAY A PATHETIC ""HOLLYWOOD"" PSYCHO IN THIS FILM, BUT RATHER A VERY REALISTIC AND FRIGHTENING CHARACTER. EVEN THE NARRATION IS INCREDIBLE - SOME REALLY INTERESTING COMMENTS ON PHOTOGRAPHY AND ITS CONNECTION TO OUR DEEPEST INNER STRUCTURE. SUBVERSIVE AND DARK, THIS IS LIKELY TO BE A ""SMALLER"" KIND OF FILM, BUT ALSO A TIMELESS CLASSIC. IF I HAD TO COMPARE THIS TO ANOTHER FILM, I WOULD SAY IT'S IN THE SAME VEIN OF ""TAXI DRIVER"" AND FILMS THAT CENTER AROUND A TOTALLY SELF DESTRUCTIVE CHARACTER.

1784326,5,B00006LA87,"Always a great flick to watch when you want to see the dimensions of Williams' acting chops. In my opinion this is an underrated film in Williams' later career. It is an unnerving and terrifying slow build type of movie for those that enjoy the nuances of a psychological film. Perhaps in our time it can be seen as dated with the use of film in our digital age, but I choose to not be convinced as with cameras on our phones and apps such as instagram, I still see it to be a fitting social commentary in life through film. Williams' look and demeanor during the film are such a departure from his funnier, lighter roles in a kind of silly-reality, yet it does not arrive overdone. It is a movie that slowly works its way into your personal bubble and unsettles you with its disregard for social norm much like Williams' character seems to convey in his lonely and envious portrayal. Williams is creepy, smart, naive, and sad in what I believe to be one of his best works. It's always a Blu that I enjoy showing to friends who enjoyed Robin Williams more mainstream work. The daydream and dream sequences in the film are chilling, purposely uncomfortable, and memorable.",1488758400,3,1171,4.528301886792453

1784357,5,B00006LA87,"This 2002 thriller, written and directed by Mark Romanek, reveals  what happens when the initially benign encounters between a retail store photo developer and a family of routine customers takes a turn for the psychologically obsessive.
  We are introduced to Seymour ""Sy"" Parrish, the photo developer in question after he enters police custody.
  The balding, short-cropped blond, begoggled  middle-aged man resembles a male Mrs. Beasley doll, complete with large blue eyes  that matched the vest he wore as an employee of SavMart. As Sy the Photo Guy, Robin Williams  gave an initially eerily restrained performance that gradually changed, showing no signs of his usual comic schtick.
  His narration of the ""reel story""(pun intended)  begins as FBI agent James Van Der Zee(Eriq La Salle, ironically bearing the name of a photographer who captured the Harlem Renaissance) asks what the father of the family did to upset him. With a calm demeanor, Sy recounts the details of his job,  and the specifics about customers  who require his services for professional reasons, and those who don't
 Among the regulars are Nina Yorkin(an intelligent, flawless-complexioned Connie Nielsen, whose short, black hair contrasts sharply with the golden brown tendrils she had as Lucilla in ""Gladiator""), who frequently brings  family photos, particularly  shots of her son, Jake(Dylan Smith), but also of her husband, William(Michael Vartan), and herself for Sy and his young assistant, Yoshi(Paul Hansen Kim) to develop.
 In a brief discussion, Nina mentions that her husband wants her to make digital photos instead, which Sy discourages because he would be out of a job. In due time, we see the perverse reasons why Mr. Yorkin wants Nina to go digital.
  Slowly, amid a tempestuous relationship with his boss(Gary Cole), Sy uncovers the truth about the seemingly perfect family to whom he's catered for years, and in  a manner that becomes more and more sociopathic, begins to stalk them, even showing up at Jake's soccer games, and offering to speak with the boy's coach(Jimmy Shubert) when the coach rebukes Jake for his performance on the field.
 Having paused outside the Yorkin's home and fantasized about being part of their family sometime before this, Sy's situation shows him to be the loner young Jake perceives him to be . We see him in his apartment tending to his pet hamster , dining at a table  face-to-face with a small TV set, and with a curious collection of the Yorkin family photos taken over many years. Even the chain of his car keys pays homage to his most frequent customers in a manner that is unhealthy.
 Another intriguing moments is of Sy  in a diner where  a 1930s rendering of the very-appropriate song, ""Reverie""  plays over the loudspeaker.
  During one of their visits to the store, Sy complimented William on having such a fine  family, and takes an interest in the action figure Jake wanted to purchase, which carries a sword. But problems at work mount, amid the arrival of an uneasy looking  new customer named Maya Burson(Erin Daniels) that Sy feels he has seen before.
  By now, we are aware of the tension in the Yorkin's home life, which  both contrast and coincide with Sy's tensions at work.
  When the manager notices a discrepancy in the photo count that can be traced to Sy, he fires the longtime photo guy, who pauses to steal a large knife-- similar to the sword of Jake's desired action figure--from a case, and leaves a surprise among the latest packet of developed photos for the Yorkins, which may alter the trajectory of their lives.
  Sy discreetly waits outside the store in his car for Nina to pick up the last set of photos he processed for them. A riderless mechanical  horse, perhaps symbolic of  lost childhood innocence, bounces alongside the waiting voyeur, who follows Nina and her son up the road as they drive off, taking photos of the very moment when the mother and son discover William's infidelity, which so shocks Nina to the point of her  having to pull over to the side of the road. Sy follows her lead.
  A disgusted Sy observes the Yorkins through their front window having dinner as if nothing happened  a short time later. In the meantime, his former boss is handed telling photos of his young daughter playing on the front lawn, which Sy went to reproduce  at the store earlier, resulting in a concerned father notifying the authorities.
  Sy's mental instability grows as he stakes out  Williams and Maya  checking  into a hotel and bluffs his way into their room for a terrifying but very revealing confrontation.
  The Yorkin's home will be under guard  until the whereabouts  of William and Sy are established. There  will be an unraveling (no pun intended) of the truth about Sy's own history that puts his character into perspective, and what can only be described as a hauntingly unsettling photo finish to this tale.",1463529600,,4892,4.9156479217603914

1784373,5,B00006LA87,"I started watching this movie not exactly sure if what it appeared to be was something I would want to watch. To put it bluntly, I have never cared for creepy or unsettling movies. If I want to get depressed I can always read the news for free.
Robin Williams supposedly playing that kind of roll was also a little uncomfortable.

However, this film is not what you think it is as you are watching and it never tips its hand regarding what is really going on until the end.
This movie does have a hard edge and children should NOT be let anywhere near it but once you understand what is going on it will break your heart.

In fact, it took until the following afternoon for me to fully understand the significance of the last fifteen minutes and it almost brought tears to my eyes.

Robin Williams was a terrific actor and he really shines in this movie.  He plays the role perfectly and once you fully comprehend the significance of the last part of the movie his performance will be even better than you thought as you were watching it.

This is not a scary or a creepy movie in spite of it giving that impression. It is in fact a portrait of a very sad and lonely man who has been hurt far worse than most of us could ever comprehend.",1452124800,,1237,4.246808510638298

1784388,5,B00006LA87,"""One Hour Photo"" is a psychology lover's dream come true.  It has everything...obsession, compulsion, stalking, treachery, betrayal...you name it.  Robin Williams (may he rest in peace) plays such a great role.  He truly was a gifted actor, a chameleon of the highest order.

Without giving too much of the film away, I really sympathized with Robin's character in this movie.  He's a person who reacts strongly to infidelity in other people, and I'm the same exact way.  I don't know what it is, but whenever I hear or see people cheating on their significant others, I well up with anger inside.  I would definitely seek to expose the cheaters any way I can.  The truth MUST come out so that these people learn their lesson.  I pray that the worst karma befalls them, hopefully ending in divorce with subsequent depression and suicide to follow.  There's a reason that Dante Alighieri in his ""Inferno"" relegated the 9th circle of Hell (the deepest one) to traitors.  Remember that, folks!

So to any of you reading my review right now....if you've cheated on people in your past, or if you're currently having an affair, watch out!  It's highly possible that someone can expose you in the same way Robin Williams did in this film.  And if that doesn't happen to you, I'll personally see to it that it does.  :)

eccentrically proud of his expertise at developing film, but painfully  lonely and sad;.  Even his apartment is colorless and sterile.  The film takes its time to set the stage and builds relentlessly.  The climax is powerful and the change that comes over Williams' character is shocking.  I don't want to spoil the end for anyone.....it's a jaw-dropper.  I was profoundly moved and exhausted by the time the film ended.

Giving it a second viewing I was able to pay more attention to brilliant film shots and other aspects of the film. The seen of Sy scratching out the face of the husband in the photos shot from below as slowly the flakes of the paper fall to the floor is amazing. The of use of color to set mood and enhance the emotional world the different characters live in is also very well done. I feel this is one of the best performances Robin Williams has done. The first time watching it the creepy factor was much grater. The second time around I just felt so much for Sy and his longing so great to be loved in context of having a family, even just as the loved uncle, hurt my heart. It makes me think of all the millions of people, just in the US, that are so isolated, lonely and not respected in their workplace. Just another cog in the corporate machine, where profit margins are all and someone like Sy who is passionate about his work doesn't have a place. Some people seem confused by his actions in the hotel. I feel he did what he did to SHAME them for taking for granted what he wants more than anything. The isolation, loneliness and (it is hinted at the end of the film that he was abuse as child) never having that kind of interaction still does not make his intrusion and stalking okay. The man is ill. Back to William's portrayal of Sy the look in his eyes in the closing shot of such utter sadness and hopelessness is amazing. I think it takes an actor to know that feeling to be able to bring that look to the eye so convincingly.",1424649600,8,1609,4.176848874598071

""Family photos depict smiling faces.  Births, weddings, holidays, children's birthday parties.  People take pictures of the happy moments in their lives.  Someone looking through our photo album would conclude that we had lead a joyous, leisurely existence, free of tragedy.  No one ever takes a photograph of something they want to forget.""

The above comes from this absorbing psychological thriller.

Seymour ""Sy"" Parrish (Robin Williams, 1949-2014) has developed photographs for the Yorkin family since their son was born.  But as their lives become fuller, Sy only seems lonelier, until ""Uncle"" Sy believes he's an actual part of their family.

When his picture-perfect fantasy collides with an ugly dose of reality, what happens next is--shocking.

Funny man Robin Williams as Sy gives an exquisitely memorable and haunting performance.  It's so good that you probably won't believe it is Robin Williams!!

In fact, in 2003 Williams won a Saturn Award (best actor) for his performance.

Photography buffs will probably notice that many of the characters in this movie take their names from noted photographers.  Even the hotel at the end of the movie is named after a photographer.

I found that the background music added to each scene.

Finally, the DVD (the one released in 2002) has seven extras.  All of them are good.  One of these shows Robin Williams as his comic-genius self.

In conclusion, this is a memorable movie with Robin Williams perhaps in his finest hour!!!

1784472,5,B00006LA87,"Creepy and disturbing, this is one of the late Robin Williams' finest, yet understated roles.  His portrayal of a loner / foto-mat employee / day dreamer / stalker is one that will both jar you and stay with you long after the final credits role.  Williams plays Sy Parrish, a long time employee of a local big box retailer, who develops photos day in and day out with precision and dedication unlike most other employees.  He has an affinity for the members of the Yorkin family, especially the young son, but over time, the attachment becomes an obsession and layers of Sy's demons become undone.  What happens by the end is both shocking, sad and sobering.  A must-see for any fan of psychological thrillers and/or of the great Mr. Williams.",1413331200,3,744,4.6923076923076925

However, i had been looking forward to seeing this so much that i downloaded it from itunes. I liked the first half very much but after that it didn't make sense to me. It lost me. A second viewing will no doubt reveal many subtleties missed the first time.

Update after second viewing: My feeling about the film remains the same--that the screenplay itself is fundamentally flawed and emotionally unsatisfying. Very disappointing. The big drama--the so-called ""confrontation""--seemed pointless except to turn the film into sort of an action thriller and get some sex into it. But it wasn't the right confrontation, the one that would have made sense psychologically. The motivations for most things in second half are opaque. I hate deliberate obfuscation and that's what this seems to me. No deeper insight and no resolution. However, Robin Williams delivers a masterful performance.",1412380800,,1000,5.134969325153374

1784516,4,B00006LA87,"Pay no attention to that 6.8 rating at IMDb; this is a psychological drama which demands more than one viewing. It's hard to even imagine anyone other than Robin Williams being considered for the lead role of Sy Parrish, the guy who prints your photos while you shop at the gargantuan SavMart. That he is the most developed -- pun intended, I guess -- character in the movie is a frustration, but not a fatal flaw. The store, his apartment, his car and his uniform may be blindingly white, but Sy's is a dark, obsessive soul. Nina Yorkin (Connie Nielsen) and her young son, Jake (Dylan Smith) are regulars at the photo counter, and it doesn't take too long to realize that Sy knows far more about them than he should. There are a couple of very effective voiceovers in the movie, and in one of them Sy explains why we take pictures: ""Someone looking through our photo album would conclude that we had led a joyous, leisurely existence free of tragedy. No one ever takes a photograph of something they want to forget."" It sounds pat and trite, but as Sy says about operating his photo processing machine, there's more to it than meets the eye.

The life the Yorkins seem to lead, with all of its colors and smiles, is the one they capture on film, naturally. Sy wants to believe their entire lives are like this, and that he is actually a member of the family. He carries around the copies he has made for himself of the latest photos of the Yorkins as if they depict his own family. In his mind they do. The depth of his obsession is almost revealed in the trailer. Thankfully it isn't, for it shows that if Sy hasn't been unhinged before, he's getting there fast.

Jake Yorkin is only nine, but senses that Sy is sad and lonely behind the wan smile. Very perceptive kid. Several sequences unfold that make it clear Sy is not just lonely and overly friendly, but is becoming manipulative, vindictive and malicious. None of this felt manipulative to me as a viewer, nor did it feel forced, until the finale. This was Mark Romanek's first feature film as a director, and he worked from his own script. His story is well-paced, and he builds the suspense in an almost Hitchcockian fashion. He throws a number of curves, and most of them are fair, not cheats. In a movie that is effective at almost every technical level, the spare, eerie score by Reinhold Heil and Johnny Klimek is a standout.

Because Sy has studied the Yorkins for years, he knows when there is trouble in paradise, and he soon has photographic evidence of his suspicions. What he does with this information initially is hurtful, but Sy isn't through with his manipulations yet. When they come, they are in the form of a violent confrontation, which is, unfortunately, awkward, uncomfortable and forced. ""One Hour Photo"" ends as it began, with Sy dressed in white, in a bright white police interrogation room. He has been arrested with two rolls of film, one of which indicates that he is capable of the rage that is the end product of seething. Sy has mastered the art of concealing that anger, but it had to find an outlet eventually. Sy is far more interested in the only set of photos the police will let him see, those depicting the mundane, the ordinary, the everyday -- qualities Sy wants others to believe he embodies. Evidently, Francis Ford Coppola recommended to director Romanek that the movie open with the first part of the interrogation, but I think that choice robs the story of some suspense. Romanek's original cut may one day be made available. It is allegedly quite different than the theatrical version, but with the movie's growing cult status, there is certainly an audience for it.

""One Hour Photo"" provides Robin Williams with a tailor-made role, and it's one of his best dramatic performances. Williams rarely acted as though he were seeking the audience's approval in dramatic roles, but that did happen in his comedic and unscripted appearances. The more restrained the character, the more honest his acting became. He sank himself into serious roles, yet you're always aware you're watching Robin Williams. The chance to do that again for the first time is lost, but at least ""One Hour Photo,"" his many other good movies, stand-up performances, and a thousand YouTube clips are here to enjoy over and over. They're all we have and will have to do.",1409011200,3,4343,4.651041666666667
1784517,2,B00006LA87,"This will not go down as one of Robin Williams' better performances, that's for sure.  He apparently went to great pains to make himself appear inconspicuous, but the end result is a shell of a man that we find very little about until the very end.  Mark Romanek doesn't take the narrative beyond a simple short story, often losing site of the first-person perspective in which he framed the story.  We see the Yorkin family through the eyes of Sy the Photo Guy, yet there are many scenes that Sy wouldn't have been privy to other than in his imagination.  I think Romanek could have taken this story much further by weaving fantasy and reality together like he did in the scene where Sy imagined himself going into the Yorkin house.  Instead, we get a rather banal tale where Sy decides to take matters into his own hands when he discovers through photographs that Will has been cheating on his wife, spoiling his image of a perfect family.  There could have been some interesting twists and turns after this discovery, but instead all we get is a little diversion where Sy gets back at his boss (the ever nasty Gary Cole) while he plots his revenge on Will and his girlfriend.  In the end, you ask yourself what was the point of this little film other than for Robin to mask his comic personality and make himself anonymous.",1408752000,,1326,4.546218487394958

But that's okay.  This film is just fine on it's own.  It brings us the lonely life of a photoprint shop employee (before those digital cameras took over almost completely) and stalker portrayed by Robin Williams.  While a number of Mr. Williams's films have been criticized for going over the top with his humor and improvs, but this film isn't one of them.  Oh, I'm sure that there are improvs in there (it's, after all, Robin Williams), but whereever they are, they blend in and work.  It was also nice to see someone take pride in his work, even if you find him creepy.  Michael Vartan, Connie Nielsen, and Dylan Smith did a great job in their roles as a Norman Rockwell-like family that is hiding plenty of problems and issues underneath...I did find it weird that the mother was so ready to pray for the photo guy...I don't know my photo guy that well.  I also liked Gary Cole as the store manager, especially in any scenes where he laid down the law...shut up, Mr. Cole!  Can't you see that Robin Williams is busy stalking people?  He doesn't have time to do things the way you want them done!  But Gary Cole doesn't let up, and I like him even more for it.  Now, if only I could have seen more of Paul H. Kim as Robin Williams's co-worker/""apprentice"".  Here is both a character and an actor who have obvious potiencial but are not being turned loose.

1784550,4,B00006LA87,"One Hour Photo is an interesting film starring Robin Williams (Good Will Hunting), Michael Vartan (ABC's Alias), and Eriq la Salle (NBC's ER). It features Williams as Sy ""the photo guy"" at Sav-Mart and Sy's obsession with the Yorkin family. It's rather creepy to see Robin Williams playing such a creepy character, but surprisingly, he does an excellent job with the wackiness.

I thought the coloring of each scene was interesting. The majority of the movie is done is white and ""cold"" colors. They definitely invoke a sociopathic feeling. Of course, at the Yorkin house (the one place that Sy really wants to be) there is a warm yellow-ish tone. It definitely sets the mood.

The movie is not as suspenseful as it is promoted to be. It's got a good premise, but the writing is lacking. I think that it would've been better with a little more development of certain parts.

Luckily, the talented cast makes up for what is lacking, and that's why I give it 4 stars.",1379548800,,965,4.6647058823529415
1784551,4,B00006LA87,"Please be aware this review is on the movie itself so much as the transfer. To be completely blunt the transfer is lackluster which is the reason this isn't a 5 star release for this 5 star movie.

Alot of people are surprised when they ask my favorite movie and I bring up a little gem called ""One hour Photo"". Half the people I speak to haven't a clue what the movie is while the other half simply say the movie was ""good"". I don't know what it was about this movie that had me ever since my first viewing (Im at about 4th now). There is no big twist ending, no explosions, no romantic love plots, no seeing dead people. The movie is rather simple at first glance. A enjoyable suspenseful thriller. It wasn't until subsequent viewings that I treated this movie like an onion (not in a bad way!) with numerous layers and noticing things I didn't notice any other times. Even my most recent time watching it I noticed more little things that helped me understand Sy more and it was because of these things it has made me grow to love and appreciate this movie.

The plot is simple for anyone who hasn't heard of the movies before. Robin Williams portrays ""Sy the photo guy"". A lonely man whos only family is one who he has only gotten to know through the pictures he develops for them, keeping a set for himself in the process. When the husband is caught by Williams committing adultery, Sy is heartbroken that this man could ruin his perfect fantasy life and take that image away from him. The movie just gets better at this point on.

I would recommend subsequent viewings in order to pick up on more little things that could possibly be missed during the first showing.

Thank you for reading this review I hope you enjoyed!",1379116800,5,1727,4.4043887147335425
1784552,5,B00006LA87,"Seymour ""Sy"" Parish (Robin Willians) develops pictures for a local SavMart. Day after day he stands behind the one-hour photo counter in its sterile atmosphere. After work he goes home. He lives alone and, as far as we can tell, has no social life. He is a thoroughly lonely man. As a photo developer he has access to the pictures of countless people, including the Yorkins. Nina and her son Jake frequently bring their family photos to be developed, which gives Sy a glimpse into the life of this apparently happy family consisting of father (Will), mother, and one son. Jake takes to calling Sy, ""Sy the Photo Guy.""

Over time, what is at first a mild interest in the Yorkins becomes an obsession, driven by a desire to be part of the family. Sy begins making duplicates of all the Yorkins' prints. He then takes them home and tacks them up on a wall in his house. Soon the wall is covered with these prints. It doesn't stop there. At one point we see Sy parked in his car outside the upscale Yorkin house, fantasizing about what it would be like to be included in the day-to-day activities of the family. He begins to think of himself as Uncle Sy.

Then Will, the father, has an affair. It happens that the woman he's seeing comes in to have photos developed that include pictures of her and Will. Sy immediately realizes what's going on. Indignant that Will would do something like this to destroy this apparently perfect family, Sy takes matters into his own hands.

""One Hour Photo"" is an extremely well-directed, fast-moving film with no unnecessary filler. Moreover, it's totally compelling as a study of how obsessions develop and get out of hand. Robin Williams gives a thoroughly believable performance in his role as Sy the Photo Guy.",1378684800,4,1746,4.644012944983818

It's the worst case of frame jiggle I've seen on a bluray (Sex, Lies and Videotape and Secretary have some wobble but not as bad as this.) Also the color is over saturated in some scenes especially with blues and in other scenes the color is not quite right. To add fuel to the fire there are quite a few black specs on the film. Damn, it could have at least been cleaned up. I've got 50 year old movies that look better than this one.
The audio (DTS lossless 5.1) is hands down an improvement over the dvd, the score comes through much better along with dialogue being clean. No audio issues at all.

Those of you who know him as Mork, Mrs. Doubtfire and Patch Adams will be pleasantly surprised by his ability to play the role of a lonely, creepy stalker in One Hour Photo.  There are many creative elements worth seeing, too.  The set design and the music both contribute to the isolation felt by the main character and felt also by Nina, her son and her husband.  The reason I give the movie only four stars is that I think there is lack of character development with Sy.  We don't get much information about his past until the end.  His character would be more sympathetic if we were given some insight into how he became such a loner and an oddball earlier on in the story.  This could have been accomplished easily via flashbacks.  This would've taken up a few mere minutes of film, so I don't know why it wasn't done.  Still, this movie is well-worth seeing.  As an added note, I am writing this review in 2011.  The movie came out before the film camera had gone the way of the dodo.

1784575,3,B00006LA87,"`One Hour Photo' is not a film you will soon forget.  That isn't to say that the film itself is a masterpiece by any means, for I think that it may be a little too aware of itself to be that impressionable, but at the end of the day this is certainly a film you will remember; quite vividly even.  In fact, years after the fact there is a crisp whiteness that I don't think I'll ever forget (the cinematography itself is rather remarkable; the camera catching so much with so little).

Robin Williams takes his usual persona and tosses it on its head rather abruptly with his astonishing turn as Seymour Parrish, a lonely and isolated one-hour photo technician who becomes disturbingly obsessed with a young couple who frequent the photo department.  His obsession helps ease his loneliness, as he mentally adopts this family as his own.  That said obsession starts to deteriorate his sanity though, and soon it drives him to acts of unwarranted insanity as he begins to interfere with their lives in ways that are not his right.

Williams is certainly in a different zone than usual.  He is effectively creepy and really grounds this film in areas that are a little shaky.  He is wholly convincing and crawls beneath your skin, but not in a way that makes him ultimately repulsive.  In fact, despite his maniacal eventualities, there is something endearing about this crazy man.  You want him to find solace because it is apparent that his overreactions are syphoned from his desperation and internal torment.  He just wants to love, and he thought he found a purity in this young couple he took into his heart, and when realities come to his attention he feels genuinely heartbroken.  Robin Williams conveys that magnificently, and it is his performance that you will remember more than any other aspect of this film (that, and the white).

As a whole though, `One Hour Photo' doesn't always find its footing.  I mentioned earlier that the film was a little too aware of itself, and that problem rears its head in areas that defeat the integral purpose of the film.  While Williams maintains his characters depth, the details that permeate each scene can overtake things a bit.  As I said in my review title, it's that coldness that is a double edged sword here.  It is effectively chilling, and that is necessary with this breed of film, but it is that same coldness that can make it difficult to wholly connect with the film.  It is a chilling atmosphere, but it needed a few more shades (maybe a little warmth) to feel complete.  Instead, it becomes overwhelming and comes across almost overtly serious.  It takes itself too seriously, which isn't to say that the film shouldn't feel serious (especially considering the subject matter) but it needed more emotional complexities to feel truly grounded and whole.

Robin Williams is outstanding, but the film lacks the shading needed to truly anchor this in greatness.",1316044800,,2921,4.778884462151394
1784576,5,B00006LA87,"It's rare to see a family in a photograph that is full of sorrow and despair. Most of the time, it's a requirement to have smiling faces in a family picture. Nobody wants to see any sort of sad expression on a face, because that's not what people would want to remember when it's revisited. It's the exact opposite of the news: we want FOND memories of life. And sometimes when we look at a smiling family in a Kodak picture, we wish we had that sort of happiness in the past (and in the present). It may seem odd to some people, but never to the main character of ""One Hour Photo"": Sy Parrish.

In the film, Sy (played by Robin Williams) is one of those people that we never really notice everyday. He works at a clinic in a department store, and he seems to be nothing but air. Very few people care about him (mainly his customers).  He's neither a celebrity nor a messiah. People would pass him by and would always be oblivious of his presence, and it's only because they've got other things in mind. As a matter of fact, he would actually blend in the white and gray walls due to the dull colors of his clothing. Sy doesn't look like he acknowledges his mediocre existence, but it's clear that he cares about his work. He is fully dedicated to creating photos, but it's unfortunate that his line of work offers him nothing in return. He is not married, and he has very little friends (probably none). Whenever he heads home from work, all he does is feed his pet hamster and watch television. His life is devastatingly empty, and he just wants the world to see that he existed. Something does give him happiness, though. There is a customer named Nina Yorkin (played by Connie Nielsen) who brings in family photos, and Sy happily process them. She is his favorite customer, and therefore, her photos are the ones that he admires the most. In fact, he loves them so much that they have actually become a part of his life. The smiles and the various colorful images on these photos make him happy, because this looks like the one thing that was missing his entire life: a perfect family. He has the desire to become a part of the ""supposed"" picture-perfect family that's embedded on hand-sized pieces of paper, and he'll do anything to make sure that it this happiness stays within, even if it results in severe consequences.

Director Mark Romanek has done a splendid job with ""One Hour Photo."" He and Jeff Cronenweth, the cinematographer, have made the correct look of the film: the contrasts of light and color between Sy's apartment, the department store, and the Yorkins' home are very well-done. Romanek has also formed the appropriate pacing for this movie: nothing is ever too slow or too rushed. Credit should also go to Reinhold Heil & Johnny Klimek for the chilling yet beautiful music score. Actually, credit should go to everyone who was involved with this film.

Robin Williams is mostly known for his comedic work. I don't admire a majority of the films that he appeared in, but I admire him for his abstract comic timings and improvisations. His dramatic work, however, has surprised millions of people because this is the exact opposite of what he has been associated with. I'm not particularly shocked by this change of pace, but I was deeply fascinated by not only his character, but also his performance in the film. Robin has that quiet, awkward personality down perfectly for his character, and his complete absorption of Sy Parrish's mannerisms and dialogue is really a mesmerizing sight to see. The supporting cast does a very good job as well. Nielsen, Michael Vartan, and Dylan Smith were very appropriate as the Yorkins, while Gary Cole plays Bill Owens, the store manager, with very few flaws.

""One Hour Photo"" is not a feel-good film, nor is it trying to be one. It succeeds at being a psychological thriller/drama that delves into solemn real-world issues. It's depressing, but it's also powerful. It's not exactly perfect, but it's still an effective film, and it remains on my list of all-time favorites.

1784577,5,B00006LA87,"""One Hour Photo"" is a very strange kind of film. While casting this film, director Mark Romanek wanted to give the role to Jack Nicholson but he turned it down. With all respect to Jack Nicholson, this was the best news the project could have heard. I say this because Robin Williams is the only actor that could really do a great job playing the character of Sy Parish.

""One Hour Photo"" is about photo technician Sy Parish (Williams). Sy is very passionate at his job. He puts his full effort into every photo he develops. He has developed photos for the Yorkin family ever since there son was born. He becomes obsessed with their family and imagines himself as ""Uncle Sy"". Once Sy finds out that Mr. Yorkin is into some shady things, he goes to great lengths to make things right.

Robin Williams did a wonderful job in this film!!

1784579,4,B00006LA87,"I've been a bit hesitant about comedians taking on serious roles (Jim Carrey for one) that don't really hit it off for me.  However, Robin Williams got his character down cold as one Sy Parrish.  Sy has been working at SavMart for 14 years developing film for his customers, admiring their photos, getting into their lives -- and even making copies for himself to place on his wall!

I like stories that start at the end and work through to the end again.  We have Sy in the county slammer, looks so white and antiseptic.  All white, but for a red chair.  He explains to the detective the whys and hows of what he's done.

Director Mark Robenek does a fascinating job with photography -- the little, lonely man is so bland and chameleon, that he blends in to every scene he plays.  The blue & white uniform blends in with the store hallways; the beige jacket blends with the cars and the walls.

We first get a hint that the lonely man has a volcano burning inside when he gets a crack in his car's windshield: ""Great, now what?""

Several themes for this film struck me:  the photos we take are of the happy times; we rarely shoot the sad times.  The photo is a fraction of a second, frozen in time.  As the film says, it's our urge to stop time.

Sy Parrish though lonely and afraid of reality, knows he could never accomplish what the Yorkin family has and starts stalking them.  He imagines he is one of the family, walking around in their house, admiring their TVs and large house.  He even meets their nine year old son and promises to talk to his coach for treating him roughly.

But when he ""just happens"" to leave photos of infidelity into Mrs. Yorkin's photo stack, things really start coming apart for Sy.

My only criticism of the film is that it starts off slow and stays in neutral mode for quite some time, spends too much time in exposition and not enough in action.  But it's a thriller, a mental game if you will, so the viewer may appreciate this type of film at face value.

I'll be looking for more Robin Williams' serious side.  Recommended.

1784581,5,B00006LA87,"I'll begin my review by stating that I've never been a big Robin Williams fan, or rather, I've never liked many of his roles.  The choices he's made to a great degree tend to be on the schmaltzy side.  Giving the devil his due I will say that his work in ""One Hour Photo"" is the best I've ever seen him.  Many of the reviewers tend to label this film as a thriller.  I found it to be more of a psychological profile of an extremely lonely man who's teetering on the brink of madness.  Sy Parrish(Williams) is a man whose loneliness pushes him to pursue perfection in his chosen occupation as a photo lab technician at a mega-store.  Sy, however, has a dangerous obsession with the family of one of his customer's in that he attaches himself to them whether it be taking home extra exposures of their photographs or daydreaming about living at their home.  When Sy's misguided fantasies about this family who may be borderline dysfunctional are shattered he experiences a personal meltdown.  As I've previously stated I didn't view this film as a conventional thriller because Williams injects a degree of empathy in Sy for the audience.  You feel pathos for Sy without viewing him as pathetic.  This is a very interesting tightrope that Williams is walking here and it's a performance that demands to be seen.  Interesting enough it came on the heels of another great performance playing a killer opposite Al Pacino's tainted cop in ""Insomnia"".  ""One Hour Photo"" will unhinge you but it offers a lot of food for thought.",1272758400,,1520,4.651685393258427

1784583,4,B00006LA87,"One Hour Photo shows Robin Williams as Sy Parrish.  The movie has Robin playing opposite his usual crazy character type and he pulls it off magnificently.

Sy Parrish worked 11 years at a One Hour Photo located in a Super Store that looks like a Wal-Mart.  He lives a stark, lonely life working under fluorescent lights in a bright white and blue store with aisles and aisles of bargains, then he drives his small car home to a sterile apartment.  Sy narrates the story that through our photographs we seem to live a happy, no-problem existence.  No one takes photos of the things you don't want to remember.  Time is held still in photos.

Sy has customers he describes and types of photos they take.  It is a funny and wry way he observes what they deem important in life.  Sy has lived a lonely life, no wife or sweetheart, but has lived vicariously through the young family of Nancy Yorkin (Connie Nelson) and her family.  Sy has made a pretend life of being the loving Uncle to Jake Yorkin (Dylan Smith). Their home and family is beautiful, warm and welcoming as their many photos over the years have shown to Sy.  Sy escapes his dreary life through their photos and his imagination.  Sy makes extra copies of all the Yorkins' photographs over the years and has a wall showing the family growing from two to three with little Jake.  Sy makes you feel somewhat uncomfortable as he strives to actually be part of the Yorkin's lives.

Because his judgement has been impaired and he has become unstable the boss at the store has to fire him.  He is devastated, but realized from other photos that Mr. Yorkin, Jake's father, is having an affair and will cause sadness and disruption to the beautiful family he has.  He develops a strange and disturbing plan to keep the family together and teach a moral lesson.  He becomes cold and calculating, angry and determined to change the direction the family is headed.

The movie is excellent and Director Mike Romanek has created a masterful thriller featuring this sad, lonely photo developer yearning for his imaginary Uncle role to this beautiful happy family.",1266710400,,2108,4.666666666666667
1784584,5,B00006LA87,"Indeed one of the very rare films of Robin Williams you will ever come across. Mr Williams totally and entirely different from the humorous and funny man we always knew or witnessed in certain films. To be honest, the film shaked me, shocked me by throwing light on some of the dark sides of human nature. Robin Williams is extremely brilliant, very impeccable in his role. Connie Nelson does an excellent work as well, the whole cast performence is pure perfection. A very rare film you will witness on screen, a film you will never easily forget infact its likely to make you think again and again. Worth a watch.",1266537600,3,615,4.6
1784585,4,B00006LA87,"Violent crime got so out of control from the 1970s into the mid 1990s, people did not care  ""why"" anymore. All that attempted understanding and ""rehibilitation"" went out the window.

When you deal with a Manson or a Bin Ladin or just your garden veriaty sexual perditor, there is a lot of merit in this. These people are evil. You can't teach them  empathy.

But Sy is not evil. He is just a sad, isolated man, one of those marginalized people who are so at a loss as to how to act, no one talks, or more importantly, listens to them. It is scary  how many people there are like Sy, and how callously we dismiss them. What if someone had taken the time to be really nice to this guy?

Sy has had really awful things happen to him. He idealizes a family who's photos he develops, and wants to be part of this family. He is not even crazy, just very disturbed. He is like a child, and he sees this family as his embracing fantasy--fills in the blanks with his own yearnings. He does not want to harm, steal, violate or kill. His problem is he is completely incapable of conceiving of other people as intigrated and complex, becuase he is not.

Sy may not be a bad man, but does a very bad thing. He finds out the father in the family is having an affair, and terrorizes the couple.\
It is a good thing that Sy is caught: he is now off the street, where he can't escelate and really harm another.

One Hour Photo is unique among films of our era in that it makes you feel geniune pity for the perportrator. The movie does not excuse what he did, and again, we want guys like Sy in a place seperate from the rest of us--he did the crime and needs to deal with the consequences.

But Sy is also a product of consequences. No one talked to this man, threw him a rope, saw that he was going deep under and tried to do something. Had someone put an arm around him, took him for a coffee, would he have listened? I don't know, One Hour Photo shows how some people, left alone, can go from being strange to very, very sick--because no one payed attention when there was still time.

That is the real creepiness of One Hour Photo.",1258761600,,2119,4.184275184275184
1784586,5,B00006LA87,"Robin Williams once again proves how good comedians can be at serious drama roles. Williams is especially adept at playing creepy characters, as he has done several times in the last 15 years.

Here, he plays ""Sy, the photo guy,"" a lonely employee in the photo department of a suburban Target/Walt-Mart/K-Mart-whatever who lives vicariously through a nice family.  Thepictures he has developed and printed for years makes him feel part of the family unit. So, when Sy discovers the husband of that family is cheating, he takes it personally....and gets involved.

This was a fascinating portrait of a deranged man and a wonderfully photographed movie. The colors in here are astounding at times and the camera-work innovative with some neat angles. The suspense of the story builds and builds one gets that old film-noir feeling of impending doom.

This has a different ending, though, than most old film noirs, not exactly what the viewer might think will happen.

This is a film that, as far I know, never got much publicity, but it's a gem. Williams is outstanding in his role and the hour-and-a-half you invest in this movie flies by.  I'd love to see it on a sharp Blu-Ray transfer.",1238457600,3,1187,4.880597014925373

1784589,3,B00006LA87,"One Hour Photo is a movie where Robin Williams goes from being a funny guy in his other movies to being a creep. He plays a very lonely guy, and you would almost feel sorry for him--if he weren't so unhinged and potentially dangerous. The robot in 'Lost in Space' is waving his robot arms and screaming ""Danger, Will Robinson.""

Let's take a brief retrospective of Robin's career:

He is a stand up comedian in San Francisco, and in 1977 that leads to a couple of spots on ""The Richard Pryor Show,"" an appearance on ""Laugh-In,"" and ""Eight is Enough."" Next year he gets on ""America-2-Night"" and then a couple of episodes of ""Happy Days"" as Mork, a character that is so popular that it spins off into ""Mork and Mindy"" and a star is born. ""Mork and Mindy"" runs for 94 episodes. By 1980 he plays Popeye in 'Popeye' for Robert Altman, with Shelly Duvall as Olive Oyl (brilliant casting, by the way). ""Mork"" continues until 1982.

It seems that Mr. Williams was very successful playing either likable, funny or funny AND likeable characters, but at some point, he wanted to explore his dark side. Thus we have 'One Hour Photo.' Also, 'Death to Smoochy,' 'License to Wed' and an episode of ""Law & Order: Special Victims Unit"" where he plays an enigmatic criminal named Merritt Rook.

His character: Seymour 'Sy' Parrish, though is probably his bleakest. There are few laughs (at least intentional ones) in 'One Hour Photo.' Robin Williams, who  spews words in his stand up act, and in such tour de forces of improvisational  'genius' as the Genie in 'Aladdin,' is very subdued and understated in 'One Hour Photo.'

Just a few observations, mostly about the look of One Hour Photo, the art direction, symbols, metaphors, and so forth: Everything is bland in shopping mall land. Beige, beige, beige, as far as the eye can see. Also Seymour's apartment has a bland and antiseptic quality. Seymour is a good name for a stalker and voyeur, because he always wants to ""see more."" The shortened form of his moniker, ""Sy,"" is even better, because it brings to mind the Cyclops: One Giant Eye looking right at you, like the lens of a camera. There are a lot of visual metaphors for pictures and photography. Sometimes windows and the framing of shots all conspire to bring to mind cameras and photography. The names of the characters are often names of famous photographers, an inside joke (just as one example, his associate is named Araki just like a famous Japanese photographer).

'One Hour Photo' is a very interesting film for its design ideas and its comments on loneliness and alienation in the modern world (or at least as modern as 2002) but it has a few holes in the plot and other flaws that prevent it from being more than an exercise to impress film school professors. For instance, would a couple who have just been humiliated and threatened with a knife just remain in stunned silence once their assailant had left them? Wouldn't they be on the phone in the blink of an eye, calling 911 about the maniac?

If you can suspend disbelief just a little bit, you might enjoy this film for its clever design, thrills and suspense, and a performance from Robin Williams that is very different from anything he's done up to this point.

1784590,4,B00006LA87,"This film shows Robin Williams in a shocking and effective departure from his frequent comedic roles.  As Sy the Photo Guy, he obsesses unhealthily about one family whose photos he has developed for ten years, keeping a set of prints for himself and his collection every time.  He intrudes further into their lives, until things start to unravel as he discovers a secret about them and also loses his job.
In the last half hour, he tries to teach one of them a lesson, then ends up with a rather contrived scene which implies some shocking things about his own childhood and how he ended up so mentally unbalanced.

You really can't argue about his performances in 'Good Morning Vietnam' or 'The Fisher King'. However I'll concede he has made some some turkeys in his time!

'One Hour Photo' is something completely different. Williams plays Sy, a photo technician in a large store. He's a loner who leads a pretty sad life and who gradully becomes obessed with a family who he regularly develops photos for.

The film develops quickly and there isn't really a wasted minute. Its well scripted, and directed with some style by Mark Romanek. This is a great example to many Hollywood filmmakers of what can be acheived through character development, rather than the unneccessary use of CGI special effects.

At only 91 minutes in length this is film that in many ways stands up to comparison with Alfred Hitchcocks work. OK its not as good as his very best, but its not far off that standard.",1195171200,,1052,4.675675675675675

1784595,4,B00006LA87,"One Hour Photo is a film about a lonely man who develops film at ""SavMart"".  His name is Sy Parrish (Robin Williams) and his job is really all he has.  There are social ingredients missing in Sy's mind, and as we get to closer to him we begin to put the pieces together.  He has nothing to live for outside of his job and the family that are his favorite customers.  The Yorkins; Nina (Connie Nielsen), Will (Michael Vartan), and their only child Jake are the customers Sy most enjoys producing prints for.  He sees them as the ideal family and he loves them so much that he creates copies of their prints for himself and he calls himself ""uncle"" Sy.  Unfortunately for Sy, the Yorkins are not aware of any of this.  Sy is awkward and socially inept.  He walks through life without the ability to relate appropriately with others and it begins to weigh in on him.  So what happens if Will Yorkin's friend Maya shows up with a roll of film of her own, and the pictures show her being intimate with Will?  What will Uncle Sy do?

There is a genuine creepiness to Director Mark Romanek's One Hour Photo.  Romanek's ability to organize images to appropriately translate in the music video medium is evidently a solid carryover to his work as a feature filmmaker.  This movie has a remarkably unique feel to it and where most films of this genre would focus on the Yorkins as the protagonists, One Hour Photo has us staring directly at the empty and profoundly sad Sy Parrish.  Jeff Cronenweth, the film's cinematographer, also deserves immense praise for his blinding white SavMart shots and overall crisp photography.  The setting becomes Sy's element effortlessly, which is convenient because SavMart is Sy.  He has nothing to go home to.  The most praise though should land squarely upon Robin Williams.  His role is a completely unrecognizable transformation and even though he received praise and a Saturn Award, he may have received more if this performance was in a different genre.

There is something about the way One Hour Photo unfolds that is appropriate but invariably predictable.  The ending doesn't hit as hard as the effective (and credit-less) opening scenes.  It's hard to say whether that is a criticism of the second half of One Hour Photo or a gigantic compliment to the first half.  I can't imagine a better ending that wouldn't come off as overly contrived or too psychological but all of this is very much just nitpicking.

This movie is basically about a photo obsessed freak who is lonely and shares his time constrcuting a collage of a frequent customer's family at the photo place he works at.

Also, when the hotel scene comes up, be prepared because it is one of the most disturbing scenes in the whole movie.

I highly recommend the film if you want to watch Robin Willams peform a serious role outstandingly.",1158019200,,617,4.660550458715596

*** 3/4

Many people have covered the film's plot. I won't bore you with restating what many have already covered well.

My take on this film is a little different. A persual of the reviews below I don't see this angle discussed. Its regarding Sy's damage.

The film's ending makes the most powerful statement. That statement is damage of children by their parents. Sy's whole rationale for his frightening acts in the hotel were simple: Mr. Yorkin wasn't a good husband and father. The emotional outburst about photos of children and things they shouldn't have to do said it all. Sy wasn't monster, but a person who is really scarred. The expierences of his childhood made him a mess and unable to interact normally with people.

At the end of the film I really felt for him. He became a wounded and damaged individual who had a normal life stripped away young. His obsession with the Yorkin's was based on the desire for a life he could never have.

The film and narrative are well done and paced. It feels sort of like a documentary. The creepy Mr. Rogers tone plays well.

There are the people who will see Sy's actions and place emphasis on them. Lost in those views is what the writers were really saying about one man. Specifically this one man. A man who is a abuse survivor and carries that deep damage.

I didn't much care for the final scenes. Instead of the Yorkin's home safely as the closer. Adding Sy being helped as the final scene would've been much more effective. Speaking for myself, I wanted to see Sy get some help. Then pay for his crimes.",1146268800,3,1579,4.515789473684211

1784610,4,B00006LA87,"""One Hour Photo"" is one of those rare gems of a thriller that is driven mostly by character development instead of plot.  Robin Williams gives one of his finest performances as a lonely photo finisher whose obsession with a family eventually drives him over the edge.

Some reviewers compare this film with ""Taxi Driver,"" but I don't think it's much like it at all.  While Taxi Driver's third act turns into an over-the-top gore fest of violence and insanity, One Hour Photo lets its protagonist gradually slip into a mental state of rage, and without a tacked-on happy ending like we saw in Taxi Driver.

One Hour Photo is kind of slow in spots, but it's also a very compelling, dark, and harrowing chiller.  And Robin Williams's character is more frightening to watch than any violent blood-and-guts slasher flick because we don't know when this lonely, quiet guy is going to snap.",1131408000,,883,4.782894736842105
1784611,5,B00006LA87,"It has been a while since I have seen a movie that made me feel uncomfortable while watching it. Having just watched One Hour Photo I can no longer make such a claim. Director/Writer Mark Romanek has brought out the very best in Robin Williams who, in my estimation, delivers his most significant performance to date. Williams subtley brings a creepiness to the screen in a character the likes of which one would not have though him capable of playing. The film keeps viewers on edge for its entire running time and manages to deliver a few honestly funny moments. I would recommend this film to anyone in the mood for darker than normal fare.",1124668800,4,643,4.6
1784612,3,B00006LA87,"The plot line is rather linear in its development with only a 'half' twist at the end. I was surprised how little introductory scene-setting occurred with the ""this is a creepy guy"" feeling being thrust on the audience immediately. His over familiarity with the child was unrealistic with mothers in today's world probably be immediately wary. (Certainly my wife would be).

The film is structured very much like ""Taxi Driver"" with it just pottering along at a steady pace with not much driving it. But whereas Taxi Driver just suddenly explodes, knocking you off your seat; One Hour Photo by comparison just makes you get up and go to the fridge. One Hour Photo even has a pseudo-Bernard Hermann sound track of Taxi Driver.

There is a sterility of the surroundings that connects all the locations. Be it the photoshop, the shopping centre, the home (both of them), the police interview room or the hotel room. They are all bare, sterile uninviting places. The trophy wall is the only bit of visual interest in the film.

So it was all a bit too contrived, stylized and desperately linear to be very engaging. Once you get the ""photo shop guy as voyeur"" image, there is not much else to it. That is a shame as you think it could have been made much creeper and suspenseful. (Think of Psycho and its development of a manager of a sleepy motel...) Robyn Williams is fine in the role but he didn't have  a lot to work with.

It was OK, but I don't think it was as good as many think and few will remember it in 5 years time. If you want a suspenseful creepy film with a real blast watch Taxi Driver.",1122336000,,1597,4.474226804123711
1784613,5,B00006LA87,"I recently viewed ""One Hour Photo"" quite by accident, and was stunned to discover that it's a very different and far better movie than I expected. (When it was first released several years ago, the title alone was enough to make me dismiss it as probable sleaze.)

I have always respected Robin Williams' talent as a dramatic actor, as opposed to his comic/manic persona, which has never done anything but irritate me. Judging by other Amazon reviews, however, many people feel the opposite; hence, they too were misled by ""One Hour Photo"", but in a different way. I'm afraid this contributed to the less-than-sterling box office returns, and I sincerely hope that writer/director Mark Romanek is not discouraged by this as his full-length feature debut. The movie is not flawless (is anything?), but I am greatly impressed by the quality of it, and Mr. Romanek's demeanor and discussions featured as extras on the DVD confirm an intelligence, maturity, and professionalism far surpassing many other young directors. I do wish, however, that Mr. Williams had refrained from so much mania on the ""Charlie Rose"" segment, because it was too distracting and diminished Mr. Romanek's opportunity to shine. Fortunately though, throughout the ""Commentary"" portion of the DVD, Williams exercises the proper restraint and allows Mr. Romanek to lead the way.

Not to mention Robin Williams' stellar performance throughout the movie itself. Here he plays the role of Sy Parrish, a withdrawn and introverted photo clerk in a Walmart-type store. Over the years he has come to feel as though he's a part of the Yorkin family, since he has been conscientiously developing their family photos meanwhile. He has fueled this fantasy as ""Uncle Sy"" by keeping an extra copy of the Yorkin prints for himself and displaying them on one wall of his apartment. However, the boss's detection of missing prints leads to Sy's dismissal, and this combined with Sy's discovery that the Yorkin family do not live up to his ideals is enough to push his fragile psyche over the edge.

Don't expect me to provide any spoilers; what I will say is that ""One Hour Photo"" is something of a subjective experience which can lead to many interpretations and thought-provoking discussions. If you don't believe me, just read the review preceeding mine!",1121558400,4,2311,5.044502617801047
1784614,5,B00006LA87,"Well over a year after having first watched this movie, I am still perplexed by it. The story is clearly an indictment of our pathological society, values and alienation, in which Sy Parrish is a hero of considerable stature - as well as a victim of the pathologies of others (and of society). That's the story. A classic Henrick Ibsen-style indictment of society, along the lines of A Doll's House or The Master Builder. But the treatment is something else entirely: it is an intentional villanization of this simple moral hero, in some perverse attempt to vindicate the insanity of our commericalized culture. And because of this treatment, most people don't even see the story. Some do, although Victoria Alexander, at [...], was the only reviewer I found who had the insight to understand that the villain of the piece was not Sy Parrish, but the cultural environment in which he lived (in which we all live). Most people are too much a part of that environment to see themselves.

It is so clear to me that Sy is a hero, that I wonder about writer/director Mark Romanek and actor Robin William's unstated motives in making it as they did. The backstory features on the dvd indicate that they were clearly making it as a horror picture in which Sy was the villain ... yet it is so masterfully done, I wonder if they were, perhaps, intentionally duplicitous - in order to get produced, distributed, and gain market share (and good reviews) by an entire society of producers, revieweres and consumers who are simply too witless to grasp that the joke's on them - and that their ability to be thus hoodwinked proves the thesis of the movie. If that's the case, it's likely we'll never know.

Sy Parrish is patently the odd-man-out, as would any sane person be, in what passes for human values in the uSA. There are, hopefully, many such sane people still in this country ... characters who would be right at home - and respected - in some such period as the Canadian tv series ""Avalon"" ... or, in general, society of 100 years past (or in the third world), yet who are too moral, too sane, and too internally healthy, to be able to cope very well in a SavMart spaceship/society, especially inasmuch as the majority of the inhabitants are seemly adjusted to their alienation, and think they possess and practice human values, rather than artificially contrived ones - leaving the hero alone and grasping at straws for ""human"" companionship, if only as fantasies.

Many of the Amazon.com reviewers say that they found the scenes with Sy and the young boy creepy and unsettling, and I can appreciate that any disruption of their artificial universe might be threatened by someone like Sy ... or someone from the third world for whom the commercial conventionalities of our world were seen-through, or seen as pathological. Of course, the other point is that, in regard to the technical devices of filmmaking, the makers of the film were intentionally manipulating these scenes to appear creepy to the average movie-goer by pushing all the stock Hitchcockian buttons - and doing it smoothly. Yet, if you know anything about filmmaking, you know that ""creepiness"" can be invoked by the camera without anything being amiss in the actual situation/dialogue/scene. And that's what is so amazing about this film - it is all a matter of perspective (except the basic story itself, which is, as mentioned, classic Ibsen, and, as such, reveals a whole different ""backstory"").

Sy, in doing the moral thing, after much gut-wrenching soul-searching - at the cost of his job and his freedom - is clearly a hero of rare dimensions in the modern world. So much so as to be unrecognizable by those who are used to more relativistic and amoral entertainment. True, his martyrdom was not a major thing to him - as living in our society was a form of ongoing dehumanizing martyrdom anyway for this ""brother from another planet."" One Hour Photo is possibly one of the greatest films of the past century, whether it was intended as such or not. And - whichever way you are able to view it - it is certainly one of the most disturbing!",1121299200,6,4112,4.746853146853147
1784615,4,B00006LA87,"It is said that an image is worth more than a thousand words. But in One Hour Photo, pictures are worth more than life to Sy Parrish.

He works in the photo-laboratory of a local supermarket. He develops the images of the people who captures with their cameras the happiest and most special moments of their lives. Sy takes his job very seriously and makes every effort to make the pictures look perfect.

The problem is that Seymour Parrish has seen already too many photos of a particular family, the Yorkins. He becomes obsessed with Nina, Will and his son Jacob, until he considers himself a member of the family. So when something good happens, he is happy for them. But if something is bad, Sy is capable of doing whatever it takes to make things right.

And that's how Sy crosses the thin line between sanity and craziness.

One Hour Photo offers a darker side of Robin Williams. The comedian and sentimental hero of films like Dead Poets Society or Mrs. Doubtfire leaves behind his do-always-good image and opts for a more aggressive role.

Mark Romanek, the director, focus the store completely in Sy; with off narrations, he describes slowly the nature of Sy's personality.

1784619,4,B00006LA87,"Indeed the name ""Robin Williams"" connected with this film should not lead one to expect any laughs.  This is as tense a film as I've seen in some time.  The director, previously best known for rock videos, creates a sensational looking world that includes a megastore that looks very much like a ""Super Target"" store, a fabulous home for a financially successful young family, and the home of our main character, Sy Parrish, played by the Julliard-trained Mr. Williams.

For almost 30 years I've felt that Williams is the funniest man alive, and that his few dramatic roles have been effective.  In this film, however, even though his presence looms large in almost every scene, he has taken it up a notch, totally and believably submerging any hint of humor.  We find Sy as an unstable control freak with no real life of his own, his entire world consisting of his TV, his subcompact car, and his job as a photo tech.  Consequently he infuses every detail of his pathetic world with a tremendous amount of importance, sweating the small stuff with such vigor that he reeks of the need to psychically rehydrate.

One can see the moment coming when he snaps, and woe to the family in his way.

This is not a violent film, but is phenomenally suspenseful in a Hitchcockian way.  There are two or three problems of logic with the plotting, unfortunately; one must believe, for example, that an unfaithful husband would allow his girlfriend to take a full roll of photos of them together kissing various parts of one another's upper anatomy (OK, so maybe he's just an idiot as well as a loser).  It's also a one-note film, focused in with tunnelvision on Sy and his unraveling.

In any event, Williams carries off his role so well that ultimately the film works well, is very memorable and effective, and is certainly worth a rental at least.

Easy, he did a superb job, and I was surprised and disappointed that he did not get more recogniton for his work in this movie.

""Sy"" is the knowledgeable and skilled photo finisher at the local ""Sav-Mart"", which we all know of course, is Wal-Mart. Sy, a chronic loner, is enthralled with a young, and successful local couple and their bright and happy boy. Sy seems to know every intricate detail of their lives as a result of processing their photos for a number of years, which eventually evolves into a sick, morbid obsession. Sy even forms the ability to  become a part of their lives in absentia, thus compensating for his own loneliness. The two party's lives are indeed at opposite ends of the spectrum.

1784624,5,B00006LA87,"This is a superlative psychological thriller and one of the best in the genre,  with a bravura performance by Robin Williams as a somewhat unhinged photo technician. Deftly directed by Mark Romanek, who has an eye for detail and an understanding that less is sometimes more, it is simply one of the best films released in 2002.

The plot line seems simple. Sy Parrish (Robin Williams) is an exacting  photo technician in a large, squeaky clean and bright, well stocked,  discount mall type store. A lonely, middle-aged man, he seems to fade into the background. He is the type of person of whom others are apt to take little notice. Polite and pleasant, he is seemingly inoffensive, yet, always a beat off. He also has one little foible. He has become obsessed with the Yorkin family.

The Yorkins are customers of his for whom he develops photographs. He has been developing their photos for years and has seen most of their cherished moments, participating in them vicariously. It is as if Nina, Will, and  their young son, Jake,  have become his family, only the Yorkins haven't a clue about Sy's secret obsession. When Sy becomes aware that the sanctity of  his secret, picture perfect family is endangered, he becomes the avenging angel, setting into motion a series of events that reveal his own deepest, darkest secret.

Robin Williams is absolutely sensational as Sy, the photo guy. He transforms himself, as if he were a chameleon. His performance is brilliant and well nuanced. As strange as Sy may seem at times, the viewer cannot help but like and pity him, even when he is at his weirdest. Sy's palpable longing to be a part of the Yorkin family is heartbreaking. Though most of his interaction is with Connie and Jake, as they are the ones who bring in the family photos to be developed, when Will comes to the store one day, Sy immediately recognizes him from the photos. Sy introduces himself to the surprised Will,  asking after his family and complimenting Will on his home, a place in which Sy has never been a guest. It is all slightly creepy, adding to the mounting tension in the film. Robin Williams plays the role of Sy to great effect, making the most of each and every moment that he is on screen. He is the quintessential lonely man, so isolated and alienated from those around him that any of his attempts at interaction with others is always a beat off.

Connie Nielsen is luminous as Nina Yorkin, a woman who is always pleasant to Sy and brightens his day every time she and Jake walk in the store to have photos developed. She is a woman whose beaming countenance belies the knowledge that there is something wrong with her marriage. There is a canker taking hold of her suburban home, eating away at the core of her family, only she cannot get Will to discuss it rationally with her.  She does not know what is wrong, only that there is definitely something amiss, although all will, ultimately, be made clear to her.

Michael Vartan is excellent as Will Yorkin, the good looking, though slightly unlikable, husband. Dylan Smith gives a sweet performance as Jake Yorkin. Erin Daniels is perfectly cast as Maya, a woman for whom Sy also develops photos. Eriq La Salle is very good as the sensitive Detective Van Der Zee. Gary Cole is terrific as the high energy store manager who gets on Sy's case about a number of issues that are coming to light in connection with the seemingly placid Sy. This is a solid cast that contributes to the overall success of this interesting and quirky film.

The sets are also used most effectively. The bright, almost bleached, starkness of the huge store set is a perfect setting for Sy, as he almost melds into the background, at times, as if he were disappearing. Only his bright blue store vest saves him from total obscurity. This is fraught with meaning, as it is his job that helps to keep Sy grounded.  The Yorkin home is filled with earth tones, giving a homey, cozy glow, enshrouding the family in a haze of warmth. Sy's own apartment is a sterile, ugly environment. There is nothing cozy about it. The only real sign that someone may actually live there are the photographs of the Yorkins that are displayed for all the world to see.

Moreover, just when one thinks one has it all figured out, there are more surprises to come. This is simply a brilliant film on many fronts. The direction, Robin Williams' performance, the sets, the restrained, low key, tension building approach, and the twist in the ending, all contribute to making this a film to add to one's collection.

At the same time, you find yourself sinking into a depressed state.  This is one of the darkest films I've ever seen and takes the viewer into the lowest regions of a mentally ill man's soul.  Unfortunately, it is one of the most depressing films I've ever seen as a result.  And I have to give credit to the creators of the film for pulling off such an endeavor.  Not many films can have that kind of emotional impact on a viewer.  But when I see a movie, I like to be entertained, uplifted, or inspired in some way.  This film will only bring you down.",1104451200,3,1105,4.45273631840796

But there was no way to suspend as much reality as this film asks you to.  The idea that the police would expend all of the manpower and energy on what was (at the time they were first called in) not even a crime, is almost funny.  Well, it would have been funny if it wouldn't have just gotten worse and worse.  To even mention the film ""Taxi Driver"" in the same review as this movie is an insult.

The film really gets you thinking about that percentage of people out there who have experianced some serious trauma in there life, and could go off the deep end at any time. It might be your friend, it might be a neighbor and sure, why not the one hour photo guy.

Robin Williams shocked me with his superb preformance as a friendly mild mannered man who is harboring something dark and horriable inside. You watch Williams as his sanity gradually goes south and he can't keep his past from influencing his actions. The cinematography in the film is very artfully done, remanicent of Stanely Kubrick's style. One Hour Photo gives Scorsese's Taxi Driver a run for it's money. I recommend it.",1095638400,3,753,4.748091603053435
1784629,5,B00006LA87,"Robin Williams gives an Oscar-worthy performance as the lonely, somewhat creepy, but wholly sympathetic Sy Parrish in this haunting, compelling directorial debut by Mark Romanek.  Some have called this a scary movie, but One Hour Photo works on emotional levels much deeper than fear and disquiet.  This is an intellectual thriller that at times borders on a work of art, a carefully constructed exploration of the depths to which loneliness and bland ordinariness can drive a man.  Everyone reacts to this movie differently; by design, a sense of moral ambiguity pervades the story and its presentation.  Many may see Sy Parrish as a bad guy (though certainly not a stereotypical one); those lucky enough to never know the hopelessness and loneliness this man endures or to experience the devastation of seeing your whole world pulled out from under your feet may look down their noses at him with denigration, not truly understanding his afflictions.  Most of us, though, know what utter loneliness feels like to some degree, and I can't help but believe that most viewers will feel a connection to Sy Parrish that differs markedly from what they might anticipate going in.  If you ask me, there is a bad guy in this film, but it is not Sy Parrish.

Sy Parrish's job means everything to him; as a photo developer at a large retail store, he develops customers' pictures with great care and professionalism.  Outside of his photo development domain, he is bland and invisible, a man truly alone.  His life could not be more different from the lives he sees day by day in the pictures he develops - in the pictures of happy families, he sees everything he wants but cannot have.  Thus, it almost seems natural that he would begin to fantasize about being a part of such a life, to have a family of his own.  His favorite family is the Yorkins, a seemingly perfect young couple with one son.  Nina Yorkin (Connie Nielsen) is one of Sy's best customers; she's always bringing in pictures to be developed.  Having watched the Yorkin family evolve over a number of years, Sy has adopted them as his own, making his own copies of all their pictures.  He knows Nina, her husband Will (Michael Vartan), and son Jake (Dylan Smith) intimately through their photos; he knows where they live, what their house is like, and all sorts of additional personal details about them.  In his own mind, he is Uncle Sy to Jake, and he tries to insinuate himself into the Yorkins' lives at just the time his own real life is beginning to fragment.  His job is no longer secure, and it is during this troubled time that he discovers that the Yorkins are not the ideal family after all.  That discovery is just more than he can take.

This is not the kind of role you associate with Robin Williams, but there can be no doubt that this man is among the most accomplished of actors.  All of the natural energy Williams suppresses in his transformation to the externally calm, quiet, rather forgettable Sy Parrish lends his performance a power that few other actors could bring to such a role.  Writer and director Mark Romanek gave Williams a completely different look, and the set design and cinematography reinforces that directorial vision to lend the movie a sense of hyperreality that proves as unsettling as Sy's descent into mental disconnection.  The acting is superb all the way around, but Williams clearly steals the show with one of the most impressive performances I've seen in a long time.

Topped off by a writer/director/actor commentary, a really well-made behind-the-scenes featurette, an ""Anatomy of a Scene"" Sundance Channel Featurette, and an extensive interview with Robin Williams and Mark Romanek on The Charlie Rose Show, One Hour Photo easily qualifies as a must-own DVD.",1093651200,14,3771,4.8229813664596275

For the most part, director Romanek eschews predictability and takes us on an ambiguous journey that challenges us and involves us on every level rather than presenting an easy, black-and-white universe that cues us to gasp or scream in the appropriate places. This is a tale told with a great stylistic flair that fleshes out rather than detracts from the thematic material. Certainly this will come to be regarded as something of a minor classic in years to come.",1092528000,4,699,4.825

""not well"" was the overwhelming answer I got. It is hard to watch this movie and not imagine this crazy stalker shouting ""Goooood Morning Vietnam,"" doing funny impressions, or dressing up as an old lady. Instead, you see Williams wielding a knife, and stalking your typical American-dream suburban family (or so it seems). To me, it was the equivilant of watching Big Bird do porn or Jim Carrey doing a horror flick. I know that it's not fair to type-cast such a brilliant actor, but ""bad guy"" and Robin Williams just truly do NOT go together. Stay away from this one.. it's a waste of time and money, and will tarnish your image of one of the best modern actors in America.",1091145600,6,850,4.490322580645161
1784632,3,B00006LA87,"Although many elements of the film were well done, the director's choice to make a trompe d'oeil illusion of a thriller leads an anti-climactic wimper of an ending.

 Robin Williams plays Sy Parrish, a dedicated but deranged one-hour-photo technician who works at a generic chain store to the likes of Wal-Mart. Having no life outside of his work, Sy compensates his isolation by becoming attached to the Yorkin family for whom he develops film: He becomes obsessed with being part of their life as he sees it through the prism of his work; he imagines how happy he would be as the family's Uncle Sy and how good he would be to them. His obsession begins to grow as he starts stalking the family members, photographing them, and trespassing into their home. His fantasy is soon shattered when he sees that photos are only a snap shot of family life and that there are ugly sides of married life that are never included in the photo album: false expectations, mundane routine, dissatisfaction, and of course, infidelity.

 The film does a great job in setting up the scenes to show the bland and montonous life of Sy. His empty life just blends in with the neat generic shelves and products of the supermarket he works in. The film brilliantly shows that theme unfolds in Sy's private life and how his neurotic attempts at breaking out of his routine soon become psychotic. Robin Williams played his role surprisingly well. The acting by Connie Nielsen and Michael Vartan as Nina and Will Yorkin was nothing special however.

 The problem with the film is that it takes almost all of its time in building suspense and leading the audience to think that Sy is a demonic killer. Instead, the ending is as bland as Sy's character in that he ends up being nothing more than a harmless peeper who went a little overboard instead of the predatory stalker the film prepared us for. Perhaps the writer and director thought that they were being clever but, ultimately, the joke is on them given the box-office results of this film. They shouldn't have been surprised; they got exactly the same response from the audience as the feeling they sought to evoke with the end of the film: an unimpressive anti-climax.

 I have trouble recommending this film to rent as there isn't much to see in this film afterall; again, all of this suspense is frustratingly brought to nothing of an ending. For this genre, I prefer films such as ""Taxi Driver"" or ""Silence of the Lambs"" instead.",1091059200,,2465,4.703016241299304
1784633,5,B00006LA87,"One Hour Photo is a deeply troubling movie and does not resort to the usual cliches of stalker movies.  The Robin Williams character is not a killer, a rapist or a pedophile.  He is someone intensely lonely, so isolated from everyone else that he has resorted to fantasy in order to make his life more bearable.  He develops photos for a living and latches onto one family - and their photos - as an inspiration for his fantasies.  This particular family makes him happy because they seem to be perfect; in his fantasies he pretends that he's the beloved uncle of the family, and that they love him and invite him to their house.

Personally when I was watching the movie I felt such a gut-wrenching sadness for the Williams character, especially when his world falls apart and he sees into the supposed perfection of his fantasy family.  His performance is subdued and tortured.  To others he tries to appear normal; he tries to please and be helpful, and always comes across as overly eager or even creepy.  Then when he breaks down it's tragic.  The psychological drama is so powerful.",1090454400,7,1088,4.654450261780105

My favorite goes to Gary Cole, who once again plays a boss, much like office space. But this time he isn't taking no garbage, he is the boss and you can take it or leave it.

In this case, the idea is that someone could be quietly ""stalking"" you without ever coming near you. Through a series of photos, a seemingly harmless man has come to know too much about a certain family. How did he get these photos? He develops them at the local photo lab. How many times have you given someone vacation photos or wedding photos? The idea that someone, through all of these photos, knows where you have been, where you live, even what the inside of your house looks like, is what makes this such a creepy film.
As far as casting, Robin Williams portrays the quickly-unravelling developer with perfection. He has just the right amount of madness to make it totally believable.

1784637,5,B00006LA87,"the Williams character creepy?  I am not so sure.  If there was anything creepy in this idiosyncratic movie it was the bland anonymity of the American Wal-Mart (the ""Sav-mart"") with its enforced fake smiles with which the employees (the ""associates"") are exhorted to meet the shopping clients and the sublimated brutality which underlies the ruthless corporate machine that dehumanizes both the buyer and the seller.  I am convinced part of the unease with which the average American meets this movie originates in the guilt he/she/we feel acknowledging the treatment we give these faceless ""associates"" in our shopping complexes.  Romanek provides us with an insightful visual vignette commentary which suggests that whenever we overlook another human being we become less human ourselves.
My dominant response to Sy ""the photo guy"" was that of sadness. Sadness over the loneliness of a man who was never allowed to grow and unfold, who has been forced to suppress his rage so that all that remained was a bland, sterile facade with no inner life; someone who has found meaning only in other people's (perceived) happiness.  Do we see here any parallels with latter day obsession of the masses with celebrity and status?  Is your regular B. Spears or NASCAR afficionado just another version of ""the photo guy""?
This movie is about Sy's yearning for simple things - family life, love, connectedness.  He believes, like so many of us, that other people could bring us happiness...  if only.....  The detective understands this, in the end, with a mixture of sadness, pity and even affection.  Romanek did a great job with little money. And Robbins' performance was simply stunning - it was nuanced, forceful and sophisticated. This may not be a movie to entertain friends with ...  but it certainly is a movie that made me think, feel and investigate.  I recommend it.",1088467200,5,1867,5.045602605863192

The movie takes an ordinary action -having photos developed- and twists it into a deeply disturbing ride which delves into the psyche of the man behind the counter who knows more about you than you think he does.  With unbelievable agility, comedian Robin Williams molds himself into a dramatic actor in this psychological thriller.  He plays Sy Parrish, a photo-developer at a Wal-Mart type place.  He is lonely, depressed, and traumatized, and longs to be part of the ostensibly perfect Yorkin family.  Sy believes that Will and Nina Yorkin are the perfect married couple and that they have the American dream.  Sy has an entire wall of his apartment devoted to pictures of the Yorkins, but his obsession is at first harmless.  Then he stalks the Yorkins, visits their house, and dreams about them.  When he realizes that Will has had an affair he forces Will and his partner-in-crime to do degrading actions so he can take pictures of them.  Sy has built up an image of the Yorkins that is so powerful that when Will breaks up this fantasy Sy goes over the edge.  ""One Hour Photo"" is a brilliant, well-directed, well-acted suspense.

1784639,2,B00006LA87,"A thriller without a drop of blood. Some directors can do it such as the hugely under-rated New Zealand film 'Mr Wrong'. This film simply does not cut it. Robin Williams is credibly creepy but the family he stalks is just bland, the cops who chase him are bland, the shopping manager who fires him is bland.
They all cohabit this bland universe. Some good ideas with colour and placement of characters, do not replace good writing and suspense.
The ending of this film is routine and the premise appears to be an afterthought. Williams tremendous performance is wasted in a directorial style exercise.
And for those of you who like flaws in film look at the final scene where Williams leaves the hotel on the ground floor and then has to run down several levels of a car park. The director obviously loved the circular car park so that it did not matter that the scene did not make sense.
I'd also have a think about the sacking scene. Without a shred of evidence, the manager manages to sack a perfectionist worker after 11 years service without so much as a warning. it does not ring true. The whole film does not allow you to escape to this universe.",1088121600,5,1153,4.495238095238095

1784642,4,B00006LA87,"This is a very, very impressive film. Robin Williams, whose comedies are nothing short of loathsome, takes us into dark territory very believably. Mark Romanek wrote and directed, and obviously knew what he was doing in every shot and with every angle. The writing is superb.
Creepy is a word that is easily brought to mind, almost too easily, by this movie. This is partly do to the movie's understated style. We nod our heads, because we've encountered people like this. Sy ""the photo guy"" is not an ogre, is not unintelligent, and has his own peculiar compassion for people. This makes it easy to empathize with Sy, and pity him, even as he concocts his despicable and pathetic strategies to insinuate himself into the lives of the Yorkins. When we watch him methodically eating and watching the Simpsons, just barely existing, there's something of an accusation directed at us watchers as well. Sy's obvious alienation from society, and his inner sterility, seem even more genuine with his dutiful participation in and obedience to the bankrupted, valueless and commodified civilization embodied by the SAVEMart, and maintained by the petty and bureaucratic manager (Gary Cole). Romaneck almost takes the manager character towards stereotype, by with Cole even it rises above two-dimensionality.
Sy casts himself in the role of protector, as a sort of unbidden defender of human value and values, transcending his own mediocrity by--I suppose--denying it. The delusional grandiosity of this role is even more sad if we have to believe that Sy's dysfunctionality is the only reason he gives a damn. What does that say?
The melodrama of a Hitchcock is absent here. The aesthetic violence of Scorcese's ritualistic TAXI DRIVER also isn't to be found. ONE HOUR PHOTO is most poignant in a main character who is everywhere today in our society. He's easy to understand because we've encountered people like this. The alienated and socially dysfunctional, who are unable to form relationships, respect boundaries, and understand intimacy are all too frequent. The near sympathy with which he's treated in the movie, and protrayed by it, may help us to be able to recognize and maybe address it somewhat in our lives.
A movie that is a clear forerunner, and I think influenced Romaneck, is Coppola's 1974 THE CONVERSATION, starring Gene Hackman, a sort of commentary on the Watergate era. It most closely compares to ONE HOUR PHOTO. Hackman is superb as Harry Caul, whose inner world is a contentless vacuum, yet guarded with obsessive paranoia (Kafka's allegorical story, ""The Burrow,"" explores this kind of existence). Isolation and paranoia morally hamstring the protaganist, yet guides his obsession when he suddenly decides to act as a moral agent. The conclusion of that movie is extraordinary.",1086393600,5,2797,5.135964912280702
1784643,3,B00006LA87,I rate the movie a 4 the first time through. But it's just not a movie I can see people watching over and over. It does a good job of showing what being lonely can do to a person. I wasn't really fond of the ending.,1084752000,,215,3.6956521739130435
1784644,2,B00006LA87,"A nice sunrise opening is never explained, but it would make a good postcard.  We are told that 'family photos are almost always of the happy moments and show smiling faces.'  We don't take pictures of something we want to forget.
In the case of a fire, after pets, people usually save their family photos.  In the early '60s, I lived in an apartment building in the historic West Hill area of Pulaski, TN, where a fire started in the walls between the floors.  A neighbor sat down placidly to look at her photo albums, which I thought strange at the time.  I was busy getting my baby and cat and run down the stairs to deposit them on another neighbor's sofa.
Sy has worked in a photo developing department of a store for 20 years and it is his life.  He gives special treatment to customers he likes, sometimes a free disposable camers as a birthday gift.
He is a loner who ""adopts"" the Yorkin family.  Similarly, Miss Barnes, a spinster librarian at the college where we were, had considered me and mine as her surrogate family.  It is so sad when you have no one in your life, no one who really cares.
He lives vicariously through the photos he personally handled (sometimes making a copy for himself) for nine years.  He tells the waitress at a seedy restaurant where he eats alone that the child is his nephew.  He collects all kinds of old photographs of people he doesn't know.  One was a Senior High picture of a girl taken in the '50s which he pretended was of his mother.
His narration at intervals throughout the movie was most informative, such as, ""I was here; I existed.  Someone cared enough about me to take my picture.""
In fact, he took one of himself at the end of one of the Yorkins' roll so they would see it.  He explained that a snapshot is a hurried shot taken without deliberate aim; a hunting term.  When I take photos, I always aim with an eye for a good background and sometimes abandon the shot if the background is not what I want.
Sy gets a little too personal in his comments about their lovely home when he encounters the husband in the store one day.  A fantastic tree (such as the large one which grows outside my window) is shown at the Yorkin's front door.  He ""visits"" when they are not at home and makes himself 'at home' with a beer watching t.v. and even using the bathroom.  One day they catch him there and pretend he was expected.
He observes a family coming apart emotionally with lots of interpersonal and financial problems, while Sy sits alone watching the Simpsons on t.v. and looking at his wall covered with snapshots of this young family.  He shadows the family wherever they go, even sits in the bar reading Deepak Chopra's THE PATHS TO LOVE as he knows that Ms. Yorkin is also reading this book.  He quotes a passage of Chopra's Eastern philosophy:  ""The things we fear the most have already happened to us.""
From his voyeurism (looking through a set of intimate photos a young girl left to be developed), he discovers the adulterous behavior of Jake's father.  As a result, he inserts them into the envelope for some rather silly snaps the child took with his 'free' camera.
He has made hundreds of copies of other photos without paying and, as a result, gets fired.  I liked the scene where he sits dejectedly on a bed in the store with a Kitty pillow.  Pathologically, he withdraws and his personality changes.  He sits in a corner on the floor and smiles at the atrocious assortment of snaps Jake took which Sy developed as his last 'job.'
As he leaves on his final day of work, he steals a long butcher knife.  He follows as the Yorkins retrieved the photos to observe the wife's hurt and torment when she sees the evidence of her husband's infidelity.  He even goes so far as to hide and take pictures of the family through a large picture window as they go through the normality of a meal.  The purloined revealing, sexy photos didn't have the lasting effect he'd hoped for.
He is clever in his demented state as he sets out to make things right for his beloved ""adopted"" family.  He tracks the philandering husband with his mistress to a hotel and maneuvers to get a room on the same floor.  He tortures the nude couple as he photographs them in sordid situations.
He has committed a criminal act previously, by taking photos of his manager's young daughter.  Gary Cole was good as the manager who had to fire him.  He was marvelous in the t.v. series AMERICAN GOTHIC.  He has invated their existence and subsequently indirectly threatened the child's life.  The police are called and discover the wall of photographs which Sy has defaced by scratching the face of the husband in each one.
He is able to delude them by intervening through a conference on 'retinal implants' at the hotel and escapes through the kitchen.  He runs like the athlete he never was, down the garage ramps.  But gets caught nevertheless.  He'd left the unused knife behind in room 519 and says, ""I just took pictures.""
On the surface, Jake's dad looks the same but nothing will ever be the same.  Is this man smart enough to appreciate the good he has?  Or will he continue to cheat on his wife and neglect his son.  No one will ever be the same.
Sy was harmed emotionallly by some of the content of photographs he'd developed for fifteen years.  Seeing some of the things people did to their children had left lasting damage to his psyche.  He ended up with stupid photos of inanimate objects that only a crazy person would take.  The scene where his nightmare showed blood gushing from his eyes had set him on a trail of depravity.
Did this move have any redeeming quality?  I didn't see any, but this is one film it will take me a long time to forget.  Sorta like PSYCHO.  I guess that stands for something in the long run of things; perhaps a lesson was learned after all.",1084752000,2,5814,4.464015151515151
1784645,4,B00006LA87,"I never know what to expect of Robin Williams anymore.  He skipped from Mrs. Doubtfire to Death to Smoochy in one bewildering leap.  So I rented this movie based on its plot, and without any consideration for the cast.
I must say that Williams really shines in this movie as I have never seen him before.  In Hook, What Dreams May Come, and Dead Poets Society, there was a hint of that dramatic core hidden beneath the childlike flippancy of the movies that are great hits with the younger set.  But in this movie, Williams puts on a stellar performance, demanding that you feel something for him, about him, and possibly about yourself.
The best part of this film is that it is not a knife-and-dagger, grotesque, blood-all-over thriller, but the psychological kind -- the type that leaves you thinking about it afterward, and yet, feeling intense emotions for the poor soul Sy the Photo Guy.  Every person has more than one dimension, even people who we might not consider normal.  But what is normal, anyway?  Everybody has a different defining line for that term.  Watch this movie and decide where you think the normal line is crossed.

1784646,5,B00006LA87,"''One Hour Photo'' this a great movie Ive watched several times.
Robin Williams who has made his career as a clown early on in ''Mork And Mindy'' to the slimy carsalesman in ''Cadillac Man'' to Leslie Zevo in Toys but underneath
all that comedic talent lies a talented dramatic actor.
Remember ''Good Morning Vietnam'', ''Dead Poets Society'' , and ''Good Will Hunting''? These were all great movies showcasing the dramatic talent of Robin Williams.
Obviously dumb critics new and old who thought Williams just did comedy were wrong (including the same critics from other sites I pointed out).
So here we are in 2002 and Williams delivers another great dramatic performances, possibly his darkest and best perforamence.
Under great director Mark Romanek who never really did a good film for several years, Williams portrays an isolated but warm human being named Sy Parrish, a guy who was worked at the same photo mart for all his life. Everyone loves Sy well everyone except his abusive and obnoxious boss Bill Owens (Gary Cole) He is a typical example of the scum that runs a company for his own personal profit while portraying this fake nice guy image which of course Sy knows is a lie.
Sy is an expert in photography however director Romanek takes things a step further portraying saying as an obsessive photo collector which people can take it
as good or bad. I took it as good, here is a guy who takes enough pride in his work to collect everything he has done. In fact it is this obsession which helps Sy uncovers the infedility of a selfish married man and the lies he has given to his family. In fact many critics failed to realize this labeling the Sy character as an obsessive voyeur/killer in the making. As said Sy works in the photo mart and comes to collect and process over a 10 yr period the magical kodak moments of the Yorkin family, Nina (Connie Nielsen)
, Will (Michael Vartan) and their son Jake (Dyland Smith).
Sy has processed their prints for years and almost is a part of their family. Sy though of course obsessively collects his own personal prints to reflect back on what a great family they are and this is what gets Sy into trouble with Bill (Cole).
Bill realizes that several prints of customers have been missing and he realizes it must be Sy. He fires Sy delivering some corporate crap which is meant to only save
his behind. However Sy though before he is fired uncovers the fact that Will Yorkin despite his Mr. Clean family man image has actually been sleeping around with another woman and lying to his family about it.
I loved Robin Williams in this film he was exceptional. We see another great dramatic performance by Williams. He is fantastic even surpassing some supposed great overhyped dramatic actors like Anthony Hopkins. Williams through this character makes
us think as to the actual value of what goes into a photo. It's a image in time made of joy usually, however it shows that photos do not tell the whole story. Obviouslly Will Yorkin is a cheating husband, something that he hides very well till the end.

1784648,5,B00006LA87,"Sy Parrish (Robin Williams) is a lonely guy. He works as a photo-finisher at the local Sav-mart, where he takes his job VERY seriously. For ten years now, Sy has given special attention to the Yorkin family. He's developed their film in under an hour, and even made sure to get an extra set of prints for himself. Poor Sy has no life at all. Each night he gets off work, drives his boring little car home to his dull little apartment, and watches tv. Sy has only one ray of sunshine in his otherwise gray existence. It is the Yorkin family. Over the years their pictures have become Sy's obsession. They have given him a sense of belonging and a reason to live. Sy has covered an entire wall with the Yorkin clan's photos. This collage represents their history with ""uncle"" Sy. One day, Sy gets called in to see his boss at Sav-mart. He's been busted for his decade worth of making (stealing) extra sets of pictures. Sy gets fired. What else is there for a man like Sy? While finishing out his final week, Sy runs across some pictures of Will Yorkin (head of Sy's adopted family) being romantic with another woman. Sy is outraged. His dream has been destroyed and he must face a reality he's spent a lifetime supressing. There are no perfect families. There are no perfect people. There are only human beings doing messy human things. This doesn't sit well with Sy, who sets out to teach his ex-boss and Will Yorkin a lesson in humility. Yep, the glue has dissolved, Sy's come apart, and he's on a rampage! What comes next is retribution for those who have dared to betray him. ONE HOUR PHOTO is a scary movie. It achieves a thickening atmosphere of dread without any cheap shots or unnecessary violence. Every crack in Sy's mind is tiny and subtle, until these cracks join together into one huge split. I thoroughly enjoyed Robin Williams' performance, as it was one of his most gratifying. Highly recommended...",1080086400,2,1913,4.563953488372093
1784649,5,B00006LA87,"Robin Williams as a bad guy? Must be a joke, right?
No joke. Ever since I saw Robin play the angry dad, if only for a few seconds, at the end of Mrs. Doubtfire, I realized that he would make a really scary villain. And honestly, he's not even a villain in One Hour Photo (although the director really wants you to think just that). He's more of an anti-hero.
Williams' strength is that he's playing against type. We know he's a nut -- in a good way -- and expect him to burst out into showtunes at any moment. This just makes the bubbling cauldron of his emotions that much more compelling.
And oh yea, Williams supposedly playd Dungeons & Dragons once or twice. Which makes me like him even more.
One Hour Photo's plot is simple: a photo clerk (Sy Parrish, played by Williams) at the local Wal-mart (er, Sav-Mart) sees things. Lots of things. Things he isn't always meant to see. He becomes obsessed with a family and has pictures of them all over his wall. It could happen to anyone -- it could be happening right now. Do you REALLY know what happens to your photos when you bring them in?
Things take a turn for the worse when Sy discovers, through his job, that not all is at it seems in said happy family. When he discovers infidelity -- that the image he clung to is in fact horribly tainted and all too real, he snaps. And as he snaps, we descend from the heavenly glow of the Sav-Mart's white lights to a dizzying kaleidoscope of hell.
The lensing is a primary character in this film: Greens, yellows, and reds (the color separation of photos, get it?) are all carefully lensed to give a surreal edge to Sye's rage, his madness, his sorrow. Colors are dissonant even though Sye himself is nearly invisible in his pastel clothes. His home is a stark, barren wasteland of color. The only thing that bothered me about the lensing is that the colors often seemed randomly placed -- something I have been trained by other directors to look for as a hint to further meaning in the movie (thanks to Spielberg and the red coat in Schindler's List and Shamalayan's red everything in Sixth Sense). But that's on purpose too, as there IS no meaning to Sye's world beyond the pictures he takes.
One Hour Photo is as much about the ideal American family that you see in department store catalogs as it is about Eleanor Rigbys of the world. For every American ideal, there is a flawed interior. For every pleasant, affable man, there is a demon waiting to be unleashed.
The ending is twisted and poignant, although some might feel it's a cop out. It explains Sye's history, why he so desperately needs a perfect family in his head, and why pictures hold so much affection for him. It also explains his subsequent violence and rage when said family cannot live up to his ideals. There's even a twist at the end -- something Maleficent picked up on but that I missed.
This is one of those movies that I didn't like nearly as much until thinking about it afterwards. It's a classic depiction of suburban hell, an intellectual horror. It reminded me a lot of Session 9, only without the insane asylum.
See it, but don't expect a slasher flick (despite the trailers).",1079913600,2,3156,4.471403812824956
1784650,4,B00006LA87,"""Everyone always takes pictures of happy times. No one ever takes a picture of something they want to forget.""  Those are the words of ""Sy the photo guy"" , expertly played by Robin Williams.  That's exactly what happens to Nina Younkin at the begining of the film. ""It's a shame to waste this one exposure"", Sy says as he takes a photo of himself using the Younkin's camera.  Nina cringes a little, but as in all really good movies the early warning signs are missed.
Sy is a lonley man who dosen't realize he's lonely.  His world is filmed in stark whites, and most of what we learn about Sy is told in spoken monolauge while we watch his bland and uneventful daily activities.  In contrast, everything about he Younkin family has color and expression.  We see early on that the marrage is troubled, but even those scenes are given a depth that Sy's life dosen't seem to have.  Sy realizes this,  and has filled his pale home with pictures of Will, Nina and Jake Younkin.  For the past ten years or so, he prints an extra set every time the Younkins bring film in to the Sav-Mart where Sy runs the one hour photo lab.
Throughout the movie, we see Sy as wierd and a little frightening.  The Younkins see a man who is a little eccentric, and harmless.  Sy begins to ""accedently"" run into different members of the family as his desire to be part of thier happiness grows. All people have faults, and eventually Will's becomes known to Sy.  This is his breaking piont.  Robin Williams is wonderful to watch as he portrays Sy's struggle with himself and with the blemish that Will Younkin etched upon Sy's personal ideals.

Nobody dies, but people are destroyed.  Watch this a second time after you know all that Sy tells the dective.  There are clues, but Sy is a picture of something we want to forget.  We look past the cause and just look at the effect.  The movie isn't horror, or even an edge of you seat thriller. It's just really creepy. It stays with you longer than an action filled adventure would.  Watch it, and be prepared to start developing your own film.

1784651,5,B00006LA87,"As in Christopher Nolan's ""Insomnia"" Robin Williams demonstrates new aspects of his talent in this multilateral thriller, making it a disturbing character sketch rather than a vehicle for cheap thrills. He's the friendly photo-tech in the local mart, especially fond of a particular family, the Yorkins. When they hand over their rolls he prints an extra set for himself, literally covering his walls at home with their pictures, gradually feeling that he's one of them (uncle Sy). Apart from being an exciting character in his own right, the production design makes him blend in with his surroundings, being a part of them on an allegorical level. He's not just a Peeping Tom, but a guardian of morals, related to Orwell's surveillance. When the husband violates the moral principles of a wholesome nuclear family by having an affair, he acts as an angel of vengeance - not a biblical one, but rather an incarnation of the social Ordnung, the flame-sword replaced with a hunting knife and his cyclops eye, the camera.
The movie should also be praised for its restrained pace and closing, not relying on the usual hysterical tricks of this genre.",1078444800,,1146,4.973958333333333
1784652,5,B00006LA87,"One Hour Photo does not qualify as a horror film, but it certainly is creepy and engrossing.
Robin Williams gives an outstanding performance as Sy Parrish, one of those little people in life that everyone ignores.  Parrish is photo developing technician for one of those value chain stores.  His dress is impeccable, he lives in a drab and virtually empty apartment, and drives a sensible car.  The guy really reeks of smallness and emptiness.  Through the years he has insinuated himself into the Yorkin family from afar as he has developed their photos detailing virtually every aspect of their lives.  His actions become a little more intrusive as he scouts their home and young son.  Still, his actions seem harmless enough--until one sees the hundreds of family photos Sy has pasted on one of his apartment walls in some sort of giant collage.  Only then do we suspect a sinister side of William's character.
A combination of Sy being fired from his job (his boss, played by Gary Cole, finds out about hundreds of unauthorized prints being made) and his discovering, by chance, Will Yorkin's infidelity sends him over the edge.  He 'innocently' tries (and succeeds) to make Yorkin's wife aware of her husband's elicit affair but it doesn't generate the result he desires.  He then tries a more aggressive approach in the climactic scene of the movie.  Apparently, Will Yorkin shattered Sy's vision of the perfect family.  Sy is a tamer version of the Terry O'Quinn character in the first two Stepfather movies--but no less creepy.
The movie is very compartmentalized, with most of its scenes either in the store where Sy works, his apartment, or the Yorkin home.  It's the scenes in the apartment where we truly see the emptiness of the man's life.  Again, Robin Williams's performance is startling.

1784654,5,B00006LA87,"One Hour Photo' is both a disturbing and a profound movie.  With it Mark Romanek has fully succeeded in putting across two fundamental truths. The first is that adultery and betrayal are, most of the times, trivial and hypocritical pursuits; the second is about the irremediable psychological damage of child abuse.
The first truth is aptly conveyed through the focus on the lying and secrecy surrounding Will's (Michael Vartan) adultery; on the embarrassment and shame when he thinks his wrong-doing is going to be 'made public'; and on his own understanding of the banality and worthlessness of his secret love story when he is brought to admit it to Nina (Connie Nielsen), the person he loves and yet has betrayed.
The second truth - the psychological damage of child abuse -is very skillfully conveyed by means of a great and unique character: Sy Parrish (Robin Williams) whose emotional and social life has been irremediably damaged by traumatic childhood experiences.
These truths are mostly revealed - and I MEAN 'revealed' - to the audience only in the last few scenes in a compelling twist, which leaves us looking at the main character Sy and at the whole movie through a quite different light and depth. Far from an unhinged psychotic weirdo, Sy (Williams) becomes the only person that has really understood what Will is doing to himself and to his family; furthermore we come to appreciate that the reason why Sy understand so well the harm caused by betrayal is to be found in his honest remembering and courageous awareness of the psychological and emotional damage done to him by his own father.
The link between the two instances of wrong-doing is the process of 'making public', the SHAMING - a link which is wonderfully conveyed by ... the taking pictures to 'the act of wrong doing' itself.

1784655,3,B00006LA87,"Sometimes appears a thriller that relies more on character development and a good, gripping story than in continuous twists and trite action sequences.

As time goes by, Sy starts to care more and more about a family he met through his job. Slowly, that care becomes an obsession, and we see there`s something terribly wrong.
Mark Romanek has directed a few videoclips and creates a stylish, absorbing mood for the movie, capturing the dysfunction and alienation of its main character. ""One Hour Photo"" is a slow, low key though interesting movie that has something to say about today`s society, and despite its somewhat anticlimatic ending still leaves the viewer think about the way he lives and acts with those who surround him.

1784657,4,B00006LA87,"The end of Summer 2002 seems to be following the trend of all past summers by offering so many choices to the movie-going public that don't really appeal to anyone in particular. This comes as no surprise since it is a well known fact that the studios dump their worst films in this time period but get big name stars to try and get some profit from the flicks. Perfect examples in the summer of 2002 would have to be Serving Sara, with Elizabeth Hurley and Matthew Perry, and S1m0ne, featuring Al Pacino, with both failing to find an audience. Another genre that is explored greatly at this time is horror but they don't always succeed even with small budgets like Feardot.com proved. Those are reasons why at this time in the year independent films come out in full force and show to Hollywood that you don't need big budgets to make a successful film. Among these is the film that critics have been raving about since its debut at the Sundance Film Festival, One Hour Photo. Robin Williams, the star of the independent flick, is the main draw as no other star has really drawn any recognition before like him. The year 2002 since to be the transition year for Williams to move from the happy go-lucky characters, he is best known for, to more dramatic roles. But does Williams' creepy performance deliver the goods or is the film underdeveloped?
The story of One Hour Photo focuses on a family and a lonely Savmart photo clerk. Seymour Parish, or Sy the Photo Guy as he is known to some of the regular customers, is the photo manager of the local Savmart who has worked there day in and day out for the past eleven years with little if any problems. In those long years, Sy becomes attached to a family that regularly comes to the Savmart and drops off their family photos to be developed. Without a loving family of his own, Sy becomes very attached to the family and ""adopts"" himself into the Yorkin family even becoming a sort of ""uncle"" to the son, Jack Yorkin, who lives a so-called happy life with his mother and workaholic father. This attachment soon turns in obsession as he follows the mother, Nina, around and pretends to meet her by coincidence in the mall. He evens buys presents for Jack and visits his soccer games. Things begin to spiral out of control after Sy is fired from Savmart for wasting prints by copying the Yorkin family pictures for himself. Sy soon loses control once he learns the dark secret of the father, Will Yorkin. The great thing about the story for One Hour Photo is that it sticks strongly the destructive path of Sy the Photo Guy and doesn't veer off that track very much. But when it does veer off from time to time, it is usually just a dream sequence or some small scene that doesn't last for too long. The intensity of the plot makes the film a great edge of your seat thriller and doesn't become too much for the audience it is intended for.
The cast of One Hour Photo is very well put together and present an outside view of what a normal family looks like which, in the end, reveals that nothing is as it seems. Robin Williams, who takes the role of Sy the Photo Guy, presents his best and most creepy performance of his career. Williams, who also starred in the dramatic Insomnia, really tries hard to fit into the role of Sy by giving a familiar charming look to the character, complete with loose glasses, white shirt and creepy smile, that makes the character all the more chilling. Not only is his performance well done but Williams' chilling narrative in portions of the presentation is also very stirring. Connie Nielsen and Michael Vartan are perfect choices as the ""perfect"" couple of Nina and Will Yorkin. They each present brilliant performances that don't draw attention away from the real story of Sy Parrish. The only problem that can be seen within the cast would have to be Gary Cole who plays Jack Yorkin, the family's son. The character came off as being too cute and, as his mother put it, ""too sensitive"", though his performance was better then most child actors.
Overall, One Hour Photo delivers more positives then negatives by the end of the feature film. The biggest highlight of the film has to be the brilliant and creepy performance given by Robin Williams as the photo clerk of Savmart. Williams will surely be the biggest draw and that is probably what Fox Searchlight is counting on. The story is very well done but some things that are thrown at the audience are a bit too much. One example would have to be a dream sequence involving Sy and blood from his eyes. The only other problem with the film would have to be the annoying performance of Gary Cole but luckily he isn't seen too much within the course of the film. One Hour Photo delivers what it was meant to which is a dark dramatic look at the so-called ""picture-perfect"" life of the modern nuclear family. If Hollywood hasn't gotten the hint after the indie-hit My Big Fat Greek Wedding then they should definitely hear it from One Hour Photo. The message is this: Good performances and better stories mean more then big name stars and loud special effects. Hopefully they will listen this time around.",1073692800,,5143,4.5490830636461705

1784659,3,B00006LA87,"With ""Insomnia"" in particular but also with ""One hour Photo"" R.Williams proves that he's got way more depth as an actor than previously attributed to, in fact that he's been pointlessly trapping himself in ""feel good"" silly comedies.
  In this film, Williams plays the silent, calculating stalker-psycho convincingly but, unfortunately for him, the rest of the script doesn't work with him and the whole film is a rather slow dragging affair that tries to be something but winds up being not much.
  But first things first:
the plot is  about Sy the ""guy who works in the photo shop"" who develops an increasingly scary obsession with the family of one of his customers. His empty humdrum life begins to find a meaning as in his fantasies he sees himself belonging...But where he attaches ""belonging"" is indeed where he doesnt belong into as he pictures himself as a secret uncle of that family.

  When he finds out that the husband of that family has turned unfaithful to his wife he decides it's time to take measures.
  Predictably, those measures carry the psychotic touches that have been taking over him and the results are...somewhat ugly.
  With such a setting (the idea is on its own scary and actually does drive the film automatically in certain points) and with Williams in very convincing form and in a role that seems to be a perfect cast ""One hour Photo"" should've been gone down as a classic in the genre.
  But it doesn't. It doesn't because the rest of the characters are underdeveloped at best, and the pace of the film doesn't keep you envolved enough to bother.
  What ""One hour Photo"" tries to be is indeed a slow paced psychologigal thriller but even as such it simply doesn't cut it.

  Most of the time the film becomes intimidating in one's mind because you can easily picture what could happen ""if"" but in the film itself this ""if"" hardly takes a horror form.

Photo developer Sy Parrish (Mork, er, Robin Williams) is the quintessential human ticking time bomb.

1784662,5,B00006LA87,"""One Hour Photo"" is a refreshing work of directory and acting genius. It takes a new, and much more realistic twist on the stalker genre. Meant to be more of a drama than a thriller, it actively does the work of both. It is a slow-paced, heart-wrenching movie because although the main character is silent as a ghost most of the time, you always know why - and that's what makes his character so appealing. You can't help but feel sorry for him.
Seymour Parish, better known as ""Sy the Photo Guy"" is a photo-technician at a local SavMart. He takes his work seriously and genuinely likes his job. He knows his customers well and they don't have to tell him they want. One particular family whose photos he has been developing for many years, the Yorkins, he considers a perfect family. Having no family or friends of his own, he longs to become a part of their lives, and for them to be a part of his. He lives alone in a dreary apartment in the middle of downtown, where his obsession with this family has taken a hold of his mind.
However, unlike stalkers such as Michael, Chucky, or  Jason, Sy is a kind, decent man with good intentions at heart. He doesn't want to harm the family in any way - he actually cares about them and wants to be with them. However, his social awkwardness prevents him from getting to know the family beyond a professional basis, and it makes him more and more unstable and frustrated.
Everything in this film is outstanding - particularly the score - which, despite its electronic origins, is quite suitable. The sounds used in a few scenes (particularly the scene in Sy's apartment) give a very good backdrop to the feelings torturing Sy's mind. And contrary to what some may say, this is ANYTHING but techno. Quite the opposite, in fact. It reminds me more of slow ambiance. One way or the other, most or all of it is keyboarded, and it's excellent.
This film is abundant in imagery and symbolism. Most of the seemingly filler scenes have hidden meaning which, when uncovered, will reveal more and more about Sy's troubled psyche.
Despite what some may say, I think the ending is very good. This is not meant to be a horror movie or a thriller movie, so I think it added to that differentiation by ending it on a pleasant note. Having Sy end the movie the same way he began it would have been heartbreaking, since Sy never has evil intentions.
All in all, a chill inducing, disturbing movie that earns a straight 6 out 5! Highly recommended for people who are tired of the same old mindless crap that fills our theaters all too often.

I really haven't watched anything from Williams in some time, but I figured it would be extremely rude to ignore yet again my significant other's cinematic choice for the evening. Fortunately, she finally picked something I could get into. ""One Hour Photo"" is definitely not your normal Robin William's fare. The comedian, who has been looking to break out of his comedy straitjacket for years, really delivers the goods with this creepy yarn about an obsessive retail employee stalking a young family. William's performance here is so good that you wonder why he hasn't tried something this daring before. Gone is the performer's spastic, eardrum shattering personality so often seen when he appears on a talk show or in a stand up concert.

One benefit of Sy's job is that he gets to know many of his customers on a first name basis, which for him constitutes his only interaction with other human beings. Parrish isn't married, doesn't have children or friends, and lives a rather bleak existence in a dim apartment. He doesn't have anything really except the copies of other people's pictures he clandestinely steals from the photo department. Parrish's favorite photos are from the Yorkin family: consisting of mother Nina, father Will, and son Jake. Nina and Jake have been coming into the photo lab for years to get their pictures developed, and Sy has taken quite a shine to them. Jake even refers to Parrish as ""Sy, the photo guy,"" a moniker Seymour takes as quite a compliment. Heck, after awhile he even feels like part of the family, so much so that he covers one whole wall of his apartment with stolen pictures of the Yorkins. If Sy cannot live with his adopted family, at least he can bring them into his own house and relive the family's most precious moments. The Yorkins look like the perfect little family on paper, and it isn't too long before Sy starts to step over the line. He ""accidentally"" runs into Nina Yorkin at the mall where the two engage in small talk, which, although meaning little to Nina, means the world to Sy. Then Jake ""accidentally"" runs across Parrish one day after school, when the photo guy just happens to bring the child a gift.
Parrish's world becomes inseparable from the Yorkin's lives, to the point that he begins following them around every chance he gets. Sy has plenty of spare time on his hands because he loses his job at the photo mart after his boss fires him for stealing pictures. The loss of the job is devastating, but even more destructive to Parrish's fragile mental state is the sudden discovery of imperfection in the ""perfect"" Yorkin household. Nina and Will have problems, specifically over Jake and the father's inability to connect with his son. One problem leads to many more when Will Yorkin decides to take a dangerous step outside of his marriage and Sy Parrish is there to teach the sort of lesson no one could ever forget. The conclusion is a shocker because it takes a different approach from the usual stalker/obsessive person film.
I liked ""One Hour Photo."" Obviously, William's take on a guy who snaps psychologically is radically different from many of his other film roles. Sy Parrish is creepy and disconnected, and Williams successfully reveals to us the inner turmoil felt by this individual. Just as neat was the chain store where Sy worked. The place is so sterile, bright, and obsessively organized that I loved looking at the place whenever they showed it. Parrish's apartment with the hundreds of pictures on the wall gives you the chills when you see it, especially later when Sy goes on his rampage and the police find the pictures with Will Yorkin's face scratched out on every single snapshot. The best scene in the film was when we see Sy snooping around the Yorkin house and the family suddenly arrives home just in time to see...well, it's best that you watch the movie yourself to discover how this scene plays out. ""One Hour Photo"" has some unforgettable moments.
The few problems with the movie have little to do with the DVD release, which boasts a Charlie Rose interview with Williams, some behind the scenes stuff, and an interesting menu screen. After watching the ""Anatomy of a Scene"" featurette on the disc, I realized that some of the messages the makers of ""One Hour Photo"" attempted to pass on to the viewer didn't exactly work. The scene in question involved Sy's first meeting with Will Yorkin in the department store. The director goes on and on about how the store represents a type of heaven to Parrish and how he proves his power over Yorkin by summoning help on the store intercom. I must have missed that when I watched the movie and I am not sure many viewers perceived that scene, or others, as the producers intended. Despite that, this movie is a must see for Robin Williams fans and a should see for all others.",1069718400,27,5577,4.7327852004111

The foreboding nature of the obsession explodes into reality when Sy the Photo Guy discovers that the father in his adopted family is having an affair with another of his customers.
The character was such a complete reversal of the normal roles that Robin Williams fills as to make it difficult to digest.  Not that Robin didn't do a heck of a job with the portrayal -- very convincing; it's just hard to see Mork, Patch or the inventor of Flubber doing this type of a character.

With this package one would expect to have a classic in the making, but this movie falls well short of the mark.  It is never boring to watch, but it simply doesn't explore some of the darker possibilities it alludes too and it concludes with a chop-off ending that won't satisfy anyone.  Some viewers will be haunted by the plot next time they get their photos developed, but for me this is an opportunity missed.

1784671,5,B00006LA87,"Right up front: I'm a fan of Robin Williams. I think he's a comic genius and a fine actor to boot.
With this in mind, I pretty much expected to enjoy ""One-Hour Photo."" I thought it could be an challenging role for Williams, and it had been a while since I really saw him stretch himself much. I didn't really know what to expect from the film as a whole, though. I was very pleasantly surprised.
""One-Hour Photo"" is one of those atmospheric films that seem to happen by chance every now and again, happy accidents of mood and observation that seem almost accidentally skillful, but most likely are good by design. The director, in a DVD commentary, expresses the fact that one of the motivating themes behind the style of the film was a fascination with the massive discount store chains that have spread rapidly across America in the last couple of decades. It's a thematic element which shows through in almost every scene, most especially in the expansive, clean shots of the store interior, and mirrored in the ordered simplicity of the decoration and furnishings in Williams' character's house. By contrast, other locations seem complex, chaotic, even messy.
Another impressive element of the film is the use of color. Early on, in a bit of narration, Williams' photo clerk describes his disdain for the work of most one-hour photo labs, criticizing them for prints which are too dark or too light, or in which the color is improperly balanced. In another scene, later, Williams gets into a loud argument with a technician about a slight blue shift in the photo processing machine he uses. Williams speaks with pride of the care he takes in getting colors perfect in his prints. This immediately made me start looking for color and light cues in the film itself, and there are many to find. One of the few places where color and light seem perfect are within the store where Williams works. The store is clean, well-lit, reds are perfectly red and blues (such as on the vests store employees wear) are perfectly blue. However, when Williams steps outside the store, light becomes too yellow or too blue. The only exceptions to this are when he is in his own home, or when he is looking into the home of the family he has been stalking. In a most striking scene, Williams is sitting out in his car, looking into their house. Everything is perfectly-lit there, and colors look right. However, outside its too dark, and blues are stronger then other shades. In the final scenes of the film, as it comes to its denouement, color becomes washed out, lights too bright, as Williams' understanding of this perfect family becomes increasingly fractured. Color plays an important part in the film. Considering that it's about a man who develops photos for a living, why would it not?
Stylistically, I enjoyed the overall visual tone of ""One-Hour Photo."" It's atmosphere is somehow both antiseptic and creepy. The few truly shocking moments in the film are made all the more so by their contrast to the movie overall. Like a Stanley Kubrick film, One-Hour Photo uses a strong sense of order to highlight the chaos. A dream sequence near the end of the film, in which a comparison to Kubrick is even more apt, uses this in a most remarkable and truly surprising way.
It's Williams himself who's the real treat in the film, though. This is a man who has spent much of his career either making us laugh or making us feel empathy for his character. In this role, more even than in Insomnia, he abandons all of that. Somehow, the man who was so open and likable in other films becomes a closed door. While watching One-Hour Photo, I forgot very quickly that he was Robin Williams, as he allowed his usual persona to be completely subsumed by that of the character. Even his narration sounds almost completely unlike what we are used to hearing from him. Gone is the bright, animated voice of Aladdin's genie or the warm voice employed for ""What Dreams May Come."" He's calm and quiet and cold, until he gets a little bit excited. Then he becomes nervous and jumpy. His pathetic attempts to be a part of something he can't attain for himself make him simultaneously pitiful and creepy. He has a distance in this film that is rare for any actor, most especially Robin Williams. Though he is in almost every scene, one is left with a feeling at the end of the film that we do not know him - perhaps that we cannot know him.
The end of the film was also a pleasant surprise, in that it goes against most established Hollywood standards of moralizing and defies expectations. Without giving any specifics away, I can say that one comes away from the film wanting to make a solid moral judgment on some of the characters, but there is no way to do so. There's no easy answers, it seems to say in the end. There's no excuse here to finally pass judgment on this or that character, only more questions, most of which will never be answered. The implicit challenge to the audience to draw their own conclusions about the characters (or even more challenging, to keep an open mind about them all), is what makes ""One-Hour Photo"" a great film in the final analysis.",1064448000,31,5143,4.62800875273523
1784672,4,B00006LA87,"Williams is usually the happy-go-lucky protagonist in most of his movies; but in this case he is the antagonist.  He is a photograph developer with a major-league crush on this one frequent customer of his.  By film's end, he does NOT do what you hope he'll just do and get over with, which (in its own sick sort of way) is kind of depressing.  In fact, I have a hard time finding ANYTHING wrong with anything he DOES do.  He's just a lonely man who wants a family, which is the message I'm left with: ""It's terrible to die alone, with no one to miss you.""",1064188800,,556,4.216981132075472
1784673,5,B00006LA87,"Given the backdrop of the local SavMart and the stunning performance of Robin Williams, this film is a deeply scary thriller that will have you on the edge of your seat all the way through; whether it's out of complete fear of what his character will do next or the embarrassment he faces for his actions.
This is most certainly Robin Williams scariest role to date and one in which he's least like himself as he's completely suppressed his comedic nature for the almost clinical persona of Seymour ""Sy"" Parish.  He certainly deserves any and all accolades he earns from this film.  Connie Nielsen performs admirably in this film as well.
In his feature film directing debut, Mark Romanek has written and directed a pure psychological thriller masterpiece.  From the simple concept of looking at a SavMart like store and coming up with this script, he has shown an amazing talent.  This is a director whose films are to be looked out for in the future.
The soundtrack for this film is also quite dead on with every sequence and adds beautifully to the suspenseful nature of the film.
The premise:
Seymour ""Sy"" Parish (Robin Williams) works at the local SavMart as the photo technician.  He's been working there for eleven years and in a large sense he has no life other than his job.  During his daily routine at work, he sees everybody's lives, or more succinctly, their more joyful moments, in the pictures they bring in to be developed.  Somewhere along the line he has become thoroughly infatuated with one particular family, the Yorkins.  Sy even fantasizes about being Uncle Sy in the Yorkin family.
When Sy suddenly suffers a catastrophic event in his life, he essentially flips all the way off of the rocker and what follows from there simply has to be one of the most suspenseful thrillers that this viewer has watched in quite some time.
I highly recommend this film to any and all fans of this genre; it will make an excellent addition to your DVD library and will stand up quite well to multiple viewings.  {ssintrepid}

1784674,3,B00006LA87,"Perhaps because I am an amateur photographer, I was very interested in seeing the film One Hour Photo, but missed it in the theatres. For this reason I purchased the DVD as soon as it was released. Though it was not as critically acclaimed a movie as one would expect from a film that stars Robin Williams, it is worth seeing and adding to a DVD or video collection. The premise of the movie, a mild mannered clerk at a photo lab being somewhat psychic seemed like an interesting plot for a movie. The viewer gets the sense that Sy, Robin William's character is someone who has his problems, but at first he seems harmless. There are danger signs about Sy that the viewer quickly sees, but Nina Yorkin, the woman who brings her family photos for Sy to develop, fails to see. This adds a sense of realism since victims are so often the last people to know they are being victimized, even though it is clear to others. Since it is a suspense movie, I am not going to say more about the plot but it is original, and actually quite plausible.
The film's chief strength is the strong cast. Unfortunately there are times the film does not move all that quickly, which can be deadly for a suspense movie, but if viewers watch it to the end, it is worthwhile.
People have joked that after the movie Psycho, people feared taking a shower, and after the film the Birds, people have been afraid of our feathered friends ganging up on us. Could One Hour Photo do the same for photo developing? Should we be fearful of those who make our Kodak moments come to life? I will have to admit, since watching the film I do wonder who actually develops my photos, and I know others who have jokingly asked the same question after viewing this movie. Fortunately I know the people who process most of my pictures somewhat well, so I don't have to worry about truth being stranger than fiction. As for others, watch out who may be handling your most intimate and significant memories!",1064016000,4,1962,4.4527777777777775
1784675,4,B00006LA87,"I'm a big fan of Mark Romanek's work as a video director. I think he's a lighting genius and his hyper reality style makes the artist look ultra-perfect. Mark bring this artistic style to his directorial debut. Although I'm a big fan of it, I did find it a bit distracting in a movie format. According to the director's commentary on the DVD, his intention was to make the movie somewhat hyper realistic, but everything is just a bit too squeaky clean.
Yet, this fits the story somewhat, in that the characters are somewhat stereotypical. The dialog is fairly good, but in some of the more deeper sections, the dialog is a bit lacking. The relationship between the Mrs. Yorkin (Connie Nielsen) and the Mr. Yorkin (Michael Vartan, of Alias fame) is one of the weaker points of the movie. They simply didn't have much in the way of chemistry and their relationship wasn't clearly established. You know that they have problems in their relationship, but it's vague and un-authentic.
The standout performance has to go to Robin Williams. What was most impressive about his work in this film was his ability to condense himself into such a quiet and contained character. We all know him as this over-the-top extrovert and in this role he is supposed to blend into the background, which he does. When he blows his gasket, which you know he's going to do, you imagination just runs wild. He's such a lonely character in such need for some type of contact that you just feel for him.
Another performance that surprised me was that of Dylan Smith, who plays the Yorkin's son Jake. His role wasn't all that large, but he really did well in it. You could tell he was really listening when he was in scene and he did a lot of small movements, like playing with a toy somewhat distractedly, that just seemed so natural. This was his first role in a movie, but you wouldn't know it from watching him work.
Although the movie is a bit stylized and somewhat sterile in it's storytelling, it's a very engaging movie. That coupled with the lighting and other eye candy is why I gave it 4 stars.",1063929600,2,2076,4.568364611260054

This movie is an intelligent thriller, unlike the typical guy-goes-wacko-and-hunts-people-down type of movies that are a dime a dozen.

He is a multi-talented, ambitious and passionate actor who can convey raw human emotion so convincingly.  The storyline isn't supposed to be a full-on thriller, it serves moreso as commentary on modern society and human-relations.

1784684,4,B00006LA87,"Proving that he had depths of creepiness untouched by his performance in ""Insomnia,"" Robin Williams puts on some weight, dyes his hair blonde, and inhabits the body and less than complete life of Sy Parrish, who works at the photo lab at the local Sav*Mart (writer-director Mark Romanek talks about it being like a K-Mart or Target, but I am sure everybody who watches this immediately thinks Wal-Mart).  During all that time that he has been processing photographs, Sy has taken what can only be characterized as an unhealthy interest in the family of Nina Yorkin (Connie Nielsen) and her son Jake (Dylan Smith).  Nina has a husband, Will (Michael Vartan), who works too much, but it turns out there are other more serious problems with the perfect life Sy has seen while developing her photographs all these years.
Sy is a nobody, a non-entity dismissed by the rest of the world who sees everything that his life is not in the photographs he develops for the Yorkins.  He sees himself as their ""Uncle Sy,"" a kindly Dutch Uncle.  But Sy has a dark side, which only comes out when something he cares about, such as the setting of cyan on the photo printer, goes wrong, and as Sy starts to work his way into the lives of the Yorkins away from Sav*Mart he finds a fatal flaw in their perfect lives.  After all, Sy does not just develop photographs for them; he just always prints an extra set just for himself.
However, for me there is one rather giant hole in this plot and that has to do with the access that Sy has to the entire store, especially after he is given the ax.  I have to tell you that I have worked in places that have fired employees and stood there watching them empty out their desks.  Under the circumstances that leave to Sy's termination, and given the antipathy that Bill Ownes (Gary Cole) feels for him, it just stretches the limits of my credulity that what happens would be allowed to happen.
However, ""One Hour Photo"" earns back points because at the end of the film we find out, along with Detective Van Der Zee (Eriq LaSalle), not only why Sy did what he did, but also what he did--and it all fits together.  We are not talking about a stunning, spectacular resolution, but simply something that provides the final piece of the puzzle.  Lots of films never get that far and combined with the sustained creepiness of Robin Williams's performance, that is enough to warrant checking out ""One Hour Photo.""",1058745600,3,2429,4.56551724137931

We see him eventually go to jail because he couldn't control his rage at the father of this family who went out and had an affair. I just find it hard to believe that someone along the way didn't know that he was the victim of abuse.
To me it was unrealistic in a sense that no one saw his wall of photos. No one in the twenty years that he worked at Sav Mart could tell by the inventory reports that he was taking pictures.  If he worked there a few months and inventory was completed I could see him getting away with it once ...but for twenty years?  He wasn't that clever.

1784686,4,B00006LA87,"While lacking the overt twistedness of ""Taxi Driver"" (one of the films which inspired this movie), One Hour Photo hits you with its subtlety.  Every scene, to this film fan's eyes, seemed to have meticulously crafted mise-en-scene (in sum: setup) to contrast the bleakness of the main character Sy's life with the lushness and color of the family he becomes obsessed with.
Naturally, the movie revolves around photographs, with several profound lines spoken about them towards the latter half of the film.  Even the colors of the scenes feel well chosen to bring out the full feeling of depth good photography holds.  The sterility of Sy's world is made abundantly clear by the well chosen techniques of the director.
Fans of Hitchcock will find much rewarding material here, as every prolonged silence shot of the main character (marvelously acted by Robin Williams in another experimental role) reveals the teeming rainbow of angst behind the eyes of the friendly neighborhood photo guy as he spirals out of control.  And in the end, we are told (rather abruptly, and the one thing i would have modified about the film) why Sy is obsessed with photographs.
There is no over the top butchery like at the end of Taxi Driver, but it lends a dab of wonderment and even sympathy to the curious old man's character.
In conclusion, this film is more of a character study than an in your face thriller, but is nevertheless a fantastic feature debut from writer/director Mark Romanek.  He has obviously done his homework and shows off his craft with great finesse.",1057881600,3,1557,4.882575757575758
1784687,5,B00006LA87,"This film blew me away. It was incredibly intriguing. In fact, my mother was sitting in the next room and within thirty minutes had come in to finish the movie. Robin Williams sucked me in with his brilliant portrayal of a disturbed man.
Sy Parrish is a one-hour photo developer, and his favorite customers are the Yorkins. Nina (Connie Nielson) has been developing her family's photos there for years. Little does she know that Sy makes an extra print of every photo for himself to hang up on a wall in his apartment. Sy sees himself as a part of their family. But a disturbing obsession turns dangerous when Sy discovers a secret about Nina's husband, Will (Michael Vartan).
The climax scene is, with the exception of a scene in ""Pulp Fiction"", the most disturbing scene I have ever seen. It's brilliantly done by Robin Williams, Michael Vartan, and another woman (I don't want to give away the ending).
A good movie is one that has an impact on you, and ""One Hour Photo"" definitely had an impact on me. I will never look at the photo guy in my local Wal-Mart the same way again. This gives such a great insight into the mind of a crazy person. The ending is great, as it doesn't tie everything up in a neat little package. There's one particular conflict within the Yorkin family that is not really resolved at all, and we're left in the dark as to exactly what happens to Sy.
Rent this movie -- you won't be sorry. However, don't think that just because Robin Williams is in it, your little kids can watch it -- they'll be scarred, I guarantee.",1057017600,,1548,4.4734982332155475

It was the story that I found hard to believe.  I know that I personally would never get that close to my local ""Target"" photo guy.  Plus I would get suspicous earlier, if each time I went in, he pushed his way up to help me and knew my address by heart.  Plus the fact that he would write down 3 prints, then cross it out and put 2 down before he gave it back to her, if something was crossed out every time you get your photos back, I'd take my pictures elsewhere.

1784690,5,B00006LA87,"Those of us that live in the suburbs know that, a few miles away, we will find one or more of those huge chain retail outlets, a place we can go to shop for everything we need.  While we're there, we might drop off a roll or two of film to be processed.  Unknowingly, perhaps thinking the whole process is done via computer, we don't realize that the technician developing the prints might actually be looking those prints over, an invisible eye to our private moments.  That's the premise of Mark Romanek's chilling ""One Hour Photo.""
Robin Williams is Sy Parrish, a photo technician for one of those large nameless stores.  He's polite, friendly, and knows many of his customers by name.  Over the years he's become particularly fond of the Yorkin family: Will (played by Michael vartan), the handsome father and husband; Nina (Connie Nielson), the beautiful mother and wife, who over the years has come to know Sy; and son Jake (Dylan Smith), who also likes Sy, and is sad in his belief that Sy is lonely and has no friends.
We've all seen the manic Robin in many of his comedies, improvising like crazy, not really playing a character, just another version of himself.  In ""One Hour Photo,"" Williams takes that manic energy and stuffs it inside, and he becomes Sy the Photo Guy, no longer Robin Williams.  It's a chilling performance.  Sy is indeed friendless.  Lonely and depressed, he eats his meals alone and returns home to his tiny, empty apartment.
Sy has done some decorating: one wall is covered with photos of the Yorkins.  Over the years, Sy has made a set of prints for himself every time the  Yorkins bring something in to be developed.  And over the years he's become fixated on what he thinks, via the photographs, is a perfect family.  He imagines himself as a part of the family, ""Uncle Sy,"" and his fixation is now turning to obsession.
""One Hour Photo"" is writer/director Mark Romanek's first film.  Like many directors, his work over the years has primarily been in music video.  He also directed Johnny Cash's heartbreaking video of ""Hurt,"" which conveyed an overwhelming sense of heartbreak and dispair.
Romanek is some kind of genius for getting the performance out of Williams that he did.  It's an amazing transformation.
The last third of the movie has Sy's world tumbling down around him: he loses his job and has discovered a piece of information on his ""adopted"" family that finally drives him over the edge into near madness.
The movie ends with many questions unanswered.  There is no nice and tidy Hollywood ending where all problems are resolved.  We, the audience, must now try to make sense of what has happened.  It's a film that will stay with you long after the end credits roll.
DVD highlights:
-- Commentary track with Robin Williams and Mark Romanek.  Apparently this is the first time ever that Williams has recorded a commentary track for one of his films.  The two have a good rapport, and while the commentary lags in places, we do get a glimpse into the ""real"" Robin Williams.  His commentary is, for the most part, subdued and intelligent, with the occasional humorous bit thrown in.
-- Standard ""Making Of"" documentaries, theatrical and television trailers, as well as a longer interview taken from the Charlie Rose show.

1784692,4,B00006LA87,"SOME SPOILERS:
Don't go and buy this DVD if you're expecting another Robin Williams bad boy role akin to the one he played in ""Insomnia"" because you're going to be in for a major disappointment.
HOWEVER, if you have this fantasy: what if I were in some kind of position that allowed me to voyeuristically take a peek into other people's private lives, would I take advantage of that power?
Robin Williams, who plays the photo technician/printer ""Sy"", DOES take advantage of that power.  His character has been played up many times before: the bored, friendless, no-family kind of guy.  But what they manage to do with this character is give him this job that allows me to pry into the private lives of his customers by viewing those photos that he prints in private, and in secret at that.
Oh, but the plot thickens here: He develops a certain obsession on the couple Nina and Will, and takes an interest in their son Jake.  This obsession is the one that makes him the bad guy. But I'd have to stop at that.
The key actors here are Robin Williams and Connie Nielsen.  While I do understand that Robin Williams is trying to get out of his comedy act stereotype (which a lot of actors try to do anyway), this is quite a good attempt.
The films itself is a whole flashback story, because from the very beginning, we already know that Sy has been captured by the law.  What DID surprise me is the ending- and you'll have to see for yourself why.
The DVD has quite a number of interesting extra features, which adds up to the value of purchasing this DVD.  I found the commentary by the director and Williams alone is worth it.",1056067200,,1623,4.447811447811448
1784693,2,B00006LA87,"I originally rated this film 3 stars, so I went back and changed my  review to 2 stars.  I guess I gave it pity points, not fully realizing how stupid this movie was.  Not being a fan of Robin Williams in the first place, this film had to really sell me on it's strong points and give me a good reason to like it, and as you can see, it failed miserably. Come to think of it, I don't think I've liked a single movie Robin Williams has been in.  Wait, there's one, ""Shakes The Clown"".  And to further illustrate my point on how horrible this film is, I will include one sort of funny anedote bordering on the surreal.  I was at a Hollywood Video the other day and saw a clerk rounding up a huge stack of previously viewed copies of ""One Hour Photo"".  He brought them behind the counter and began chucking them in the trash, with much vigor.  I, being the curious video store patron asked him what was going on.  He remarked, ""we've got so many, we don't know what else to do with them"".  I laughed at his comment and further explained I had seen the movie and understood the unpopularity of this particular DVD.  He then scoffed a bit and asked me if I would like a free copy before he trashed the rest of the lot.  I thanked him for his offer, but declined.  Point being, they can't even give this horrilbe film away.  Strange but true.",1055980800,4,1336,4.188235294117647
1784694,4,B00006LA87,".....there isn't much of a story here. While ""....Photo"" tries really hard to summon up tension and actual fear, one walks away from the film feeling a little letdown. Robin Williams is terrific as Sy, a sad, lonely and obviously disturbed man who obsesses over his work a bit too much (and the wall collage of photos in his apartment is sorta creepy), but I never sensed any real danger from him, even when he was holding Will Yorkin and his mistress Maya at knife point, on the contrary, it was actually rather funny! The ending is a completely worthless, but I rate the film so highly because it LOOKS so good and Williams is first-rate in all his scenes. Director Mark Romanek copies Kubrick a little too closely at times but never quite achieves Kubrick's fluid camera movement or his brilliance at making every scene look like a finely detailed painting awash in blinding white light and full of uncomfortable silences. A nice film to look at, but ""One Hour Photo"" seems comedic instead of disturbing or scary.",1054944000,,1016,4.681564245810056
1784695,4,B00006LA87,"Trouble in Happy Familyville. Mrs. Yorkin isn't getting the love and attention she needs from her husband, the son is also being subjected to emotional neglect by his father, and good old Sy (the photo guy who reads Deepak Chopra, so he can't be a real psycho) has always a kind word - all while Mr. Yorkin is off porking crumpet on the side. So far, so morally ambiguous.  But hey! Moral ambiguity isn't where Hollywood is at, so good old Sy finds out about Mister Yorkin's extra-marital activities, gets fired from his job and....well, you'll have to see the movie. Let's just say things pick up.
All in all this is a good film.  Robin Williams puts in a great perfomance as Sy; the camerawork is quite reminiscent of Stanley Kubrick so it's a great looking movie; the supporting roles including Gary Cole as slick, middle-managament type (flashback to Office Space) and Mrs. Yorkin played by Connie Nielsen are very good.

As evidenced on Foxlight pictures website's forum many members including myself who have seen the edited screen play Cannes' Film Festival version, it's a completyely different movie.  I wonder if the viewing public had a choice, if they would prefer a movie that had the ""dumbed down for the masses"" approach by Romanek.  First off the screen play version doesn't start off letting you know Sy was apprehended for some crime.  It starts with a brooding monologue to capture you in.  Romanek did a hack job cutting most of the meaningful William's Dialogues out of the Theatrical and DVD versions.

1784699,5,B00006LA87,"Robin Williams is an amazing actor, im sure he could pull off a movie with purely pantomimes and nothing more, so he is perfect for this role as Si, a Photodeveloper at a local supermart. It is a supremely delicate role in that he has to portray being obsessed with what he wants and appear almost as a stalker and yet still make the audience feel bad for him, if it weren't for the extreme position he is found in at the climax of this movie im sure everyone could truly say, 'that could be me.' I would  reccomend this movie to anyone with a strong understanding of symbolism within movies or other arts and also to anyone searching for a movie that has more to offer in which the director has ingrained subplots or hidden meanings, etc.etc., but you must understand that Robin Williams' character is not simply a homely stalker latched onto an unlucky family, he is a midlife lonely man who only wants someone to love and love him in return, he has nothing else so he attatches to this family he sees as perfect; a large house, a beautiful son, wife, and husband, a pet dog, a new car, everything top of the line. He ends up uncovering the 'beneath-the-surface' america that is really in every home at different levels and it infuriates him, i reccommend going to sparknotes and looking up this movie for further symbolism and theme descriptions, its not one to miss.",1053820800,2,1370,4.502008032128514
1784700,3,B00006LA87,"Do not expect Robin Williams to make you laugh with this movie.  This is not a comedy like a `Patch Adams' or a `Mrs. Doubtfire'.  In fact, this is not a comedy at all.  But Williams' character of Sy ""the photo guy"" is certainly one for the books; or at least one you can look at and shudder.  He does a very good job as a quiet, would-be psycho who resides in the feeling of being part of an everyday family he is obsessed with.  Anyone who enjoys Robin Williams' work, not just his comedy, will most likely enjoy the movie when it's all said and done.  I think that's a fair assumption.  I would not categorize this movie as a ""horror"" movie; it's more creepy and sinister than it is horrifying.  But lord behold, there are numerous parts where you will shiver with fear (the bleeding eyes segment is particularly disturbing).  Sadly, I think it's the laid back attempt to produce a disturbing atmospheric movie that doesn't allow for `One Hour Photo' to become much more than average.
Sy gets his nickname, ""the photo guy"", because he works at the film counter of a SavMart (a sad attempt to parody Wal-Mart) where he processes people's film.  He seems to take great pride in his work; and that really shows when he goes over each type of customer he gets.  He makes note of the birthday party families, insurance agencies printing accident photos, and jokingly, the amateur adult entertainer.  That might've been the only funny part of the movie.  Sy takes a particular liking with the Yorkin family, a family that has been coming to him since their son Jake was born.  A family that in Sy's mind is the idyllic family that holds the idealistic life style he only wishes he had.  From the beginning, we see parts of Nina's, Will's, and Jake's lives through not only pictures, but thoughts and dreams in Sy's mind.  And all those thoughts built up in Sy's imagination force him to drift away from his own life and, sometimes, his work.  Watching Sy channel surf was reminiscent of an insomniac (the `Simpsons` excerpt was short but funny).  There is great turmoil between Sy and his boss (played by `Office Space' actor Gary Cole).  One thing that is continually disturbing about this movie is how incredibly uncomfortable it makes you.  Not because it's scary, but because it's so darn creepy.  And the music behind the movie really adds character (and eeriness) to what was already there.  Sy, in all ways, manages to seem off-putting to his customers; which is something you see even the Yorkin family contemplating.  I'm sure it was intended to be that way, yet still, it is a bit too strange of a feeling for some people to handle.  But it's entertaining, to say the least.  For the first hour or so, the movie seems to be coasting along; letting us think about what's going to happen.  And as confusion within the Yorkin family and problems with Sy's work collide, the climactic point is reached.  The director does a good job leading us up to that climactic point; as it's not too sudden and not too predictable.  I won't spoil it for you.  From the start to the point of the confrontation (the climax), the only thing that isn't covered is Seymour ""Sy"" Parrish's background.  Again it was probably intended to be vague, but again it was somewhat confusing.  And therefore so was the ending.
I never like to spoil movies for people, and I certainly won't do that here.  I highly recommend this movie if you appreciate Robin Williams as an accomplished actor; not just a comedian.  Even with good supporting roles by Connie Nielson, Michael Vartan, and Dylan Smith as the Yorkin's and the appearance by Gary Cole, Williams is really the only actor who shines bright.  The back cover for `One Hour Photo' states that this movie will do for photo processing what `Psycho' did for showers.  I don't know if I'd go quite that far, but still be sure to keep your kids away from this one.  The slow-paced, subtle repulsion of this movie may keep it from becoming a classic, but it's certainly worth watching.  This movie makes you think while entertaining you at the same time.  Watch this. But know what you like beforehand.",1053648000,,4128,4.611796982167353
1784701,3,B00006LA87,"I like Robin Williams. I really do. I've seen most of his pictures (even the bizarre ones) and know that he's not just a great comic actor, but a great dramatic actor, too. However, if Williams wants to gain more recognition for his dramatic roles, he's got to start picking movies that have better ""umph"".

ONE HOUR PHOTO is a movie about a photo lab technician (Williams) who after years of developing pictures for the same family becomes obsessed with them and wants to enter their lives in a more intimate way. The concept is pretty creepy and seems promising. However, the movie never fulfills its promise. Instead, all the great acting, lighting, and scenery go to waste in a movie without any meaning or real plot. What could have been a great stalker film ends up getting lost in the art of filmmaking and the movie itself is lost in the process.

Besides that though, this movie was relitivly a mild-paced movie, some parts were a little slow, and in the end there was a twist ending.  This movie may not be the best movie to show to younger kids, because they may get afraid of the concpet of someone knowing their whole life and trying to kill people.
Robin Williams did a good job, and all the characters in this movie were very well played!  There was not much of a plot, but what they did have was pretty well planed.
There was no ""Thrilling"" special/visual effects and no ""Stand-Out"" music, but that's ok because this type of movie does not require eaither.
This might be a movie to rent though, as it is one of those that you can see twice and be done with.

Williams plays Cy ""the photo guy."" A mild mannered and shy photo booth operator who follows the rules. But he is shown to have not much of a life outside of that. Eating dinner alone in his kitchen, you feel pity for him, until you see the photos from a family plastered on his wall. You come to notice that he is a lonely man that has possibly one friend, the man which he works with. However, the plot starts to really get going when Cy notices that the family man is cheating on his wife, causing an outrage with Cy. He feels it is his responsibility to make a difference. This causes an uproar with the family and the police, as Cy goes after the husband. With a very chilling and tense ending that will then go to the happiest ending one could possibly imagine.

1784706,3,B00006LA87,"One Hour Photo (Mark Romanek, 2002)
Mark Romaneks second feature film (following 1985 indie Static), One Hour Photo was released to almost universal accolades, then found itself skunked at the Oscars. Critics around the country expressed confusion and outrage. Everyone wanted to know why.
One Hour Photo is the story of Seymour Parrish (Robin Williams), a clerk at the local superstore who develops photographs. He has developed an unhealthy obsession with the Yorkin family: father Will (Michael Vartan of the TV series Alias), mother Nina (Connie Nielsen of Gladiator), and son Jake (Dylan Smith, seen more recently in Pirates of the Caribbean).
Therein lies the problem: laid out like that, you can see exactly where this is going. And while its a good stalker tale, it never rises above just being a stalker tale. Even when Parrish is trying to do the right thing by the family, the scenes (and the emotions within them) could be from any of twenty other stalker movies. Weve seen it all before, and while the production quality and the acting is certainly above the caliber of your average Lifetime Original Movie, the underlying plot, theme, and message are right in the zone.
Williams, like all gifted comic actors, does have the chops to play the psychotic, and shows them here well. But in order to truly shine, hell need better material; his two forays into it so far (the other being Chris Nolans execrable remake of Insomnia) have been hampered by bad script choice. In fact, it seems everyone in involved with this film, from Romanek right down to steadicam operator Elizabeth Ziegler (the last name in the credits), is capable of better. There are huge amounts of potential from every direction in this film; they just never manage to coalesce.
That said, as I inferred above, as an example of the stalker-film genre, its not bad by any means. All the main performances are credible, with the arguable exception of Gary Cole, who plays Parrishs boss. Hes a bit two Im the evil upper management guy two-dimensional. The pacing is a little uneven, but once the ball gets rolling, it works well enough. Its worth a rental, but not the awards so many people called for. ***",1052092800,,2184,4.842245989304812

1784713,4,B00006LA87,"I just saw this film for the first time without the benefit of seeing any other reviews of One Hour Photo.
From what I've read here, and I certainly didn't read everything by a long shot, a lot of reviewers seem to have completely missed the essence of this film. I'm not going to rehash what the film ""is about."" You've already read that.
But all of the film's deliberate coldness and psychotic tensions reveal themselves through Williams' character, Sy Parons. They ultimately lead to one profoundly sad revelation: Sy is a victim of early child abuse. As the film further reveals, it was by his own father who was undoubtedly also an adulterer (note the scenes of the photos in Sy's apartment where the adulterer father's face is scratched off of every photo).
Sy is in no way a ""bad"" or ""loathesome"" person. Nor are his intentions evil. He is essentially still a child who could never really grow up, struggling to make something meaningful of his life in spite of wounds that have left him emotionally crippled and unable to deal effectively with relationships. How sad we are for him!
Some clues are apparent noteably in the scenes where Sy forces the adulterer to commit further acts with his terrified partner, so that he may photograph them for posterity, or so it would seem. His threat, ""If you don't do what I say, I will stab you in the heart"", is not what would come from the mouth of an ax murderer. And when he asks the couple to perform oral sex and the adulter proceeds, Sy admonishes him, asserting, ""Don't do that. This is not REAL, it's just pretend!""
The final scene in the police interrogation room with Sy and his photos is straight from Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" and a further revelation of Sy's hurt.
Bottom line, don't miss One Hour Photo. Williams is outstanding, with the rest of the cast commendable as well. The writing is intelligent and sympathetic and the directing taught and well-paced.

The first hour, which includes a few nice cinematic touches (Romanek is clearly a Kubric fundi), do not make up for a narrative which would most probably have fared better as a back story to 'NYPD Blue', or some such vacuous t.v. confection. Williams, although stellar, has not performed quite as much of an about face as many critics have suggested. Instead, he plays up all of those persona traits we have come to expect from him; the nervous glances, the supplicated need for acceptance from the audience. Granted, these character 'tics' have been wholly subverted. The family, on the other hand, seem to have been conceptualized as nothing more than a cold narrative device, a tease in order to force the narrative to it's conclusion.",1050451200,,797,4.741007194244604

No friends, no family, no life and on one who cares about him...except the little boy Jake, the son of the family he obsesses about. When the Man of the House is caught fooling around with another woman, Sy is outraged; HIS family is threatened, and must be avenged. His world is one of sterility and loneliness; there is nothing to alleviate or relieve this man, he dwells in a Hell on Earth, comprised of a lonely apartment, a lonely job and a lonely life; always on the outside looking in. It is, IMHO, the finest work of Williams's career, right up there with Dead Poet's Society...this man can do anything, literally, and this is his tour de force. Even in the store, he sits on a bed next to a Hello Kitty doll, completely isolated is his bubble of loneliness; impenetrable, and the shoppers move around him, but never glance at him; he is the REAL Invisible Man. Spied on by the store manager, a wholly despicable man, typical of the Big Fish in the Small Pond and relishing his power (and chance to bully others who are not in a position to fight back) over the underlings/minions who have the misfortune to serve under his merciless eye. He ""lives"" with this family, he muses about being a family member, included in holidays and regarded with the kindness and caring so sadly missing from his real life. When the store manager fires him, his world, as sad and lonely as it was, comes crashing down; this was, after all, his only hold on life at all and his only contact with people. When this refuge (as bad as it is) is taken away suddenly, he becomes morose and then angry, and his obsession is fuled by this bad turn of events...one wonders how many ""Sys"" are out there, and how many times we have gone into Walmart, K-Mart, Walgreens, etc., and dealt with people but never thought of them as people, but simply ""things"" installed in the store for our convenience...one wonders. All the tiny snobberies, inadvertent, but there nonetheless, and the ""Sys"" of the world go on, alone and isolated while we go home to family and friends and homes with lights and friendly people...Sy's life is, literally, unimaginable, until you see this movie, and really see it.

How in the world would Mr. Romanek have the audacity to ask Robin Williams to perform in such a part. This role is intended for someone like my Uncle Cleo, well, You don't know him, but he is just like the Big-Jaw-Black-Haired Guy from ArliSS, maybe he shouldve gotten the SY role, seing how he is going bald anyways.

Nobody ever snaps a picture of the first fall on a bicycle.  You never see a picture of your first heart break tears or pictures of Dad after the remote control mysteriously flew across the room.  It's as if we paint this picture of our lives with snapshots of smiling happy moments in time that are soon forgotten after a cloud of sadness washes over the landscape.  Picture taking comes to a standstill until a child's first or a birthday and maybe a holiday rolls around.  Slowly the book fills--all too perfect.  Give a kid a camera and see what happens.

While you're looking consider who else is looking.  If I could evoke a feeling of a sinister spirit slowly worming its way into the picture I'd start with Sy Parrish as depicted by Robin Williams.  Of course in addition to meticulously developing your photos in an upscale version of Wal-Mart, Sy is also an avid photograph collector, drives a Toyota Echo and has been silently coveting the Yorkin family since before the youngest member was born.  Such a meek and quiet man who you know has issues just by the way he walks and adds 1 set of prints to the normal 2 that Mrs. Yorkin orders.  Everything is spic-n-span until Sy's perfect family shows irregularity.  In a fleeting moment you silently pity the loner who, in some bizarre way, could have been teaching some form of a lesson; right?  You get what's coming to you; don't you?

You want to scream at the parents to wake up!  For God's sake, just wake up!  But they don't.  They won't.  That is; until a shy, quiet man--a.k.a. Uncle Sy--decides to snap them out of it.

Events develop (pun intended) at just the right pace, so that the viewer is effectively drawn into Sy's obsession-filled world.

This could have been a great film if it had given the viewer more to think or talk about. It was just weak. This is not something that most kids would enjoy. They would be bored while waiting for Robin Williams to crack a joke, and its R rating reflects sexual content, including some nudity, and profanity. One Hour Photo was okay.

He does fall head over heels for this one family and basically bends over backwards for them by giving the boy a free camera, making them pay only part of the amount they owed for the pictures, and even takes a picture of himself to go along with the pictures.  Here's the real bizzare thing is that he has all the pictures of the family in his household and even goes the extra mile to show the wife and son some pictures of the husband cheating with another woman (who is also another one of his customers) and breaks in their hotel room and make them take pictures of them having sex.  He is so attached to the family, it's just ridicuols how he goes about trying to protect them.  Don't get me wrong, Sy does have a soft side to him but it can be overlooked by his bizzare behavior.

Williams' frequent voice-over monologues about the deep meaning of film processing were not intended to be humorous, but were, indeed, laughable.  I could drum up no empathy for a single character in the movie.  We observe Williams in the latter-end of his obsession for this family, and although Williams is convincing in his role as a pathetic, friendless outsider, I've no idea why he wanted to subject himself to such a part.  The only bright spot in the film was Gary Cole as the Sav-Mart manager who fires Williams' character from the store in the last half of the movie.  Mr. Cole plays a great corporate toady and was well cast in this film.  As for the rest of the cast, they all seemed to be wandering around the screen, spouting out awful dialogue.

Sy the Photo Guy is a man who takes exceptional pride in his work as the film developer par excellence at the neighborhood Savmart.  From the grain detail to the tint of the prints, Sy consumes himself with making the recorded picture memories of people as memorable and as true to life as possible.  With one customer, though, he takes this dedication too far.
The Yorkins are a ""picture-perfect"" family comprised of the attractive mother Nina (Connie Nielsen), the handsome father Will (""Never Been Kissed""'s Michael Vartan), and an adorable young son Jake.  Their frequent trips to the Savmart have allowed Sy to get close to them through the sunshine images of their family photos.  We soon realize that Sy has an unhealthy obssession with their happiness, and he finds himself fantasizing about being a part of the utopic lives of the Yorkin family.  He even goes so far as to reprint all of their photos to frame in his own home, and he begins to stakeout the family's home and spy on their son.
The rub comes along when Sy discovers that Will Yorkin has been having an affair with one of his coworkers.  With good intentions, Sy tries to tell Nina about her husband's wrongdoings, but when he sees that Nina won't confront Will about it, Sy takes on a more proactive role in their lives.  This is where the movie begins to take an even more bizarre turn...

Here, Williams' cinematic performance is worth many a rave review, and clearly puts him in the spotlight, up close and personal as Sy ""the one hour photo guy"". We look in on our study in action, working as a lab photo technician at a Wal-Mart-type knockoff. While developing many a photograph, one particular family catches Sy's eye, as well as his personal camera lens, as Sy's job becomes his personal obsession, an obsession that could wind up going too far if Sy isn't careful. In fact, this job means everything to our photography expert, as this storyline is conveyed clearly to the viewer. As the film progresses, the story itself becomes more intense, with the action becoming even more developmental with each passing scene. But, Robin Williams, whose performance here is nothing short of breathtakingly spectacular, isn't the only star whose performance shouldn't go unnoticed. Kudos should also go to Gary Cole, whose performance as a superstore manager and Sy's boss, although somewhat brief, is also worthy of high marks, especially in the intensity dept.. Cole's character is the absolutely perfect opposite foil of Williams' character, where the latter exhibits a Type B personality as opposed to Cole's Type A demeanor. With so many hooks to keep the frequent moviegoer (and regular video purchaser) entertained, and with its star and supporting cast's performances to boot (including Eriq La Salle's [of ""ER"" and ""Coming To America"" fame] credible role as a police detective), ""One Hour Photo"" just might earn Robin Williams the Best Actor Oscar of 2002.

1784740,4,B00006LA87,"This is a low-budget movie that very effectively uses that low budget to create an atmosphere of sterility and coldness.  Robin Williams plays a man who has worked at a one-hour photo lab in a sterile, Walgreen's like department store that seems to have very few customers.  He's obviously good at his job, but his skills have fallen on hard times as his obsession with one particular family (and their photos) begins to consume him.  He keeps their pictures on his wall at home, and we truly sees himself as a beloved member of their family.  When his illusions about the family are shattered, he snaps in a dangerous way.
Williams is well-suited to the role.  He underplays the role, and this reigning-in of his natural ""over-the-top"" nature gives his character a subtext of roiling emotions just waiting to bubble over.
When he does finally snap, even his ""revenge"" is stunted and ineffective.  This man is professional loser.  The movie is well-written enough so that we feel a mixture of sympathy and disgust for this character.  If we hated him completely, then there would be no reason to see the movie.  If we totally sympathized with him, his collapse would be far to difficult to take.
Gary Cole plays Williams' boss in a spin on the character he played to comic effect in OFFICE SPACE.  Here he emerges as the true villain, and Cole is excellent.  He's a very underrated performer.
Connie Nielsen (GLADIATOR, THE HUNTED) is convincing as the mother in Williams' adoptive family.  She is a mature actress who deserves more high-profile roles.
The movie has lots of humor as well, and in many ways is a satire of the cold, sterile retail-centric world we live in, and how easy it is for a shy person to get swallowed up in the impersonal-ness of it all.  Yet on another level, it's a ""psycho"" movie that sometimes feels a bit familiar and obvious...we've seen so many psychos by now!!  But the performances make it well above average.

But beneath the veneer of the smiling photoshop guy lies a sad, isolated man who wants to belong and to love. He is so engrossed in lovingly capturing on film the most beautiful moments of a person's life that  the line between reality and the posed world of the picture gets blurred. When he finds that the beautiful world of the pictures hides sinister secrets, his make believe world of perfection breaks down and he embarks on a mission to restore the moments crystallized in those snaps. With tragic consequences.
A moving picture of isolation and the dehumanization of society where a person ceases to be a person but simply a cog in the wheel. Robin Williams is marvellous in a career defining role where he brings creepiness and pathos in equal measure to create Sy Parrish. The screenplay is taut and the direction is smart...the bluish hues of the photo development center and the sparseness of the rooms conveying the sense of isolation and loneliness much better than words would have ever done.

By this time, Sy has snapped. Is Sy really a bad guy?. Is he nuts?. By the time the film ends, Sy lets us in on the pain that has brought him to this point in his life. It's nothing new and most people will probably see it coming, but at least it's real and can happen and explains certain things. The ironic thing here is that the 'perfect family' he longed after, weren't really all that happy. It's hard to see or think of Sy as a bad guy. Does he need serious help?. Yes. Is he evil?. I wouldn't say so. The movie showcases that what is on the exterior, isn't always in the interior. Williams is brilliant. He makes Sy a real person. He doesn't make it a caricature or bring us to think that it's just Robin Williams being crazy. He is Sy Parrish, and he is amazing. This also breaks the saying that Williams always seems to have a beard whenever he is doing his most serious, dramatic work. Vartan and Neilsen are too plain and directionless. They seem to just be there to go thru the motions while Robin does his thing. Neither one of them really gives out anything great that would make someone like Sy want to be them or be with them. I guess it's just the thought of being in a family. The great Gary Cole also appears as Sy's boss, and former ""ER"" star Eriq LaSalle plays a detective on the trail of Sy. Did LaSalle leave ""ER"" for small, useless roles like this?. The movie is creepy and it has the right, perfect score for it as well. What's really the scariest thing about this is that this is not some monster created by Hollywood. This is real life. This could happen and it could happen to anybody. Nothing is scarier than reality. Some people might be turned off by how Sy turns towards the last part, but it was going to come sooner or later. In his mind, he was doing nothing wrong. Just taking pictures.",1048118400,,3378,4.271450858034322
1784743,3,B00006LA87,"After building a career of ""nice guys"", smiling, funny and even sometimes silly characters, Robin Williams recently decided he could play the bad guy. ""One hour photo"" is an example, and the more recent ""Insomnia"" is another (I haven't watched ""Death to Smoochy""). I always thought Robin Williams was a one-character actor, meaning he couldn't change his performances from one movie to another - even the psychologist in ""Good Will Hunting"" and the troubled husband in ""What dreams may come"", like all other Williams' characters have a sound resemblance to Patch Adams. Well, in ""One hour photo"" and in ""Insomnia"" I was proved wrong. Not only Williams can play a problematic and sad character, he can be very convincing (although we always feel sorry for him).
In ""One hour photo"", the Yorkes (Connie Nielsen, Michael Vartan and Dylan Smith) seem the perfect family for Sy Parrish (Robin Williams), the ""photo guy"" from a ... store. Sy is obsessed about the family. All the photo-sets the Yorke family get from Sy have a copy in Sy's house. When Sy gets to know the Yorkes aren't so perfect after all, he slowly but surely starts to plan his revenge.
Being a movie essencially about obsession and photography, ""One hour photo"" is full of light (there is a light bulb, or the sun, or the moonlight in EVERY scene) and colorful. It just didn't work for me, because I was supposed to be watching a thriller, and in my conception (maybe I'm too old-fashioned) thrillers don't work if they're light- and colorful.
Mark Romanek's script isn't innovative. His direction is confused, blending old and new technics during the movie. About the actors: Connie Nielsen and Michael Vartan have been better (in ""Gladiator"" and ""Alias"", respectively), but theirs are average performances. The kid, Dylan Smith, is rather good. The best performance is by Robin Williams, different from everything I'd seen him doing.
In the end, the best thing in the movie was the Yorkes' house (I'm an architect).
I give this movie only three stars mainly because I was expecting one thing and got one totally different.

1784744,3,B00006LA87,"I was really looking forward to seeing this movie after hearing the raves about Robin Williams' performance. I do think he did an outstanding job, but that was one of the only good things about this movie (well, the cameo by Eriq ""Dr. Benton"" LaSalle was kind of cool). Here are the things I didn't like:
1. The ending is ruined by the first scene. The movie opens with Sy having his mug shot taken, and across the bottom it says ""Threat Management Unit."" So you know right away no one's going to get killed, which makes the ""climax"" of the movie more of an ""anti."" There went all the tension and suspense.
2. I couldn't become attached enough to the characters of the young couple to care enough whether or not anything happened to them. They seemed like a pair of Barbie and Ken dolls playing house; the acting was bland and uninteresting. When Sy starts to stalk them in earnest, I just thought, ""ho-hum.""

1784745,5,B00006LA87,"First of all, if you don't know who the director is, then where have you been the last 10 years? Mark Romanek over the years has directed videos such as Michael Jackson's ""Scream"" and Nine Inch Nails ""Closer.""
So you know that he already has the visuals down. As for the story, well, Mark wrote it. Robin Williams said in the commentary track that after reading the script, he was hooked, but wanted to see what the visuals might be like. After hearing what videos Mark had directed, Robin signed up to do the picture.
The movie? Well, I was anticipating it to be far more gruesome/graphic. Thankfully it wasn't. You're left feeling like you'd watched something by Hitchcock.
Extras? Well, the Charlie Rose interview with Robin & Mark is absolutely hilarious. A *must* see. The commentary track with Mark & Robin is never boring...
A great first movie from someone I expect to become another ""David Fincher""-like director. (Whom Mark is great friends with.)
Audience testings? Well, let's just say Mark sent out the picture to his friends Francis Ford Coppola & David Fincher and took their advice on several things...

1784746,5,B00006LA87,"...because Robin Williams does such a magnificent job as the pitiful and scary but still poignant Sy the Photo Guy, a study in total loneliness and isolation.  You can't help feeling for the guy, no matter how creepy and abject he is; there were many points when I just had to look away from the screen because I felt so sorry for him, more so than watching a million survivors of your run-of-the-mill wars, natural disasters, violence, etc.
The other actors are also well cast, from the hard-nosed Walmart boss, to the supposedly perfect family that Sy idolizes.
This is a subtle film, with striking visuals that keep your attention but avoid too much flash and sensationalism.  (Surprising, given that the director used to do music videos.)  Even though I correctly guessed the basic plot during the first 5 minutes, it still takes some unexpected twists at the end, surprisingly controlled and un-cliched twists---for example, though Sy arms himself with a six inch knife he actually doesn't use it to slice up his victims into several dozen little pieces as a more typical Hollywood melodrama would probably have him do.  This film admirably doesn't take the easy way out...it's not a simplistic portrayal of a simplistic loner-psychopath, nor a simplistic expose of a Yuppy family that's not anywhere as idyllic as it looks.
The brilliance of this film is how ambiguous its main characters are, how it blurs the lines between one troubled man's delusion-life and the delusional lives most of us lead.  There are vast and fascinating subtexts here which are implied but not spoonfed; consequently this is a film that definitely stays with you...one of the best I've seen in years!",1047686400,,1684,4.936395759717315

And Robin Williams looks diffrent in this movie, than he does in other movies, but sonds the same. The movie also has Gary Cole from I'll Be Home For Christmas plays his boss Bill Owens. As the movie opens, Seymour Parrish works at the photo counter at SavMart. Seymour takes your film, gets it devloped, and has it ready until time for the custmors to pick up. But the only things, his custmors don't know about, is that he makes copies of photos that they haven't taken for himself. Seymour's favorite custmors are Mrs. Yorkin (Connie Nielsen) an her son Jakob ""Jake"" Yorkin (Dylan Smith). He gave Mrs. Yorkin 5x7 photos when she wanted 4x6 photos. And when he learns that Jake has had his 9th birthday, he gives Jake a free camera for his birthday. There is one custmor that only takes photos of cats, and another that takes photos of wrecked cars. This movie is Robin Willam's first movie to run under 1 hour and 40 mintues since Flubber.

1784748,4,B00006LA87,"One Hour Photo was the most disturbing film I've seen this year. Its effectiveness in disturbing an audience comes from creating a character, Sy -- the photoguy -- with whom on some level just about all of us can relate to. Chiefly, that he is lonely, hard-working, clean, mild-mannered, affable, and modest. We've all known someone who portays some of the likeable characteristics that Robin William's vehicle, Sy conveys. But William's character's loneliness develops into an unhealthy and illegal obsession with the charming young Yorkin family. As a photoguy at the SavMart's One Hour Photo lab, he has access to their very normal family photos.
That's where the story gets creepy!
Sy's attraction to the Yorkin family is not the typical sicko lust attraction. Indeed, writer/director Mark Romanek establishes early on Sy's dislike of pornography, which gives his *emotional* obsession a creedence it wouldn't have had otherwise. Essentially, Sy's attraction/obsession to the family develops to fill the emotional emptiness in his life -- his loneliness -- and the line between an appropriate concern for the family's well-being and an inappropriate concern (indeed, a legal and illegal concern) is the tight-rope Mark Romanek carries the audience along for most of the film. Some of the things Sy does are nice, good, and likeable -- that's what makes this so disturbing.
Obviously, plastering his apartment wall with a Warhol-esque assemblage of the Yorkin family photos is bizarre -- even illegal -- but much of his other interaction early on in the film seems to have good intentions.
Indeed, the scale is clearly tipped only when Sy loses his job because of his unhealthy and illegal obsession with the Yorkin family photos *and* finds out that Will Yorkin is cheating on Nina his wife.
My girlfriend and I kept saying ""What's he gonna do?"" and ""How's the film gonna end?"" in that we didn't want Robin Williams to be bad. The audience wants him to do good and it's established that he is capable of doing good.
Indeed, Sy ends up conveying a rather convoluted cautionary tale to the police detective (the guy from ER!) at the end, warning him against neglecting *his* family, against infidelity. And Romanek makes a point to show that the detective is listening to him, albeit skeptically at first.
Ultimately, it's safe just to call this a psychological thriller and to say bad, bad, bad -- that there's no question that Sy the photoguy is bad. But it may be that he *has* good intentions that makes his bad intentions all the more compelling.
A complex film. A remarkably self-controlled performance by Robin Williams. Well worth the 4 dollar rental fee.

1784749,1,B00006LA87,"I am disedified that this movie is well regarded.  As storytelling, it gets an F-.  The family that Robin Williams gets a little obsessed with?  The father is some yuppie flake who's got about the same presence as a guy in a dandruff commercial.  The wife seems to have read a book that says the secret to great dramatic acting is to act like you're on downers all the time and can't bring yourself to wake up.  ""Where is your son!""  The detective yells in her face, once its become clear that jeopardizing shenanigans are afoot.  She blinks and slowly shakes her head and says in a voice devoid of emotion, ""He's... at a friend's house...""  The kid himself, who all the fuss is about is basically just a kid, who commands about as much interest as most kids - zero.  Robin Williams doesn't have sexual designs on the kid.  He doesn't have sexual designs on the mother, and though he does end up taking some - shall we say, artistic? - photos, he doesn't have sexual designs on the father.  So what is his angle?  Well, suffice it to say that his own family was not so hot, so he's become a trifle obsessed with what he sees as the perfect family.  Maybe its part of the whole idea that the family he does get obsessed with is nothing to write home about and in fact makes the viewer vaguely nauseous.  Maybe, as in Taxi Driver, what the misguided protagonist sees and what is really there are two different things.  Maybe you are supposed to want to puke on these people and hope that Robin Williams cuts them up real bad with his stilletto, homes.  Maybe.",1047513600,3,1557,4.372822299651568
1784750,3,B00006LA87,"I was excited to see this movie primarily because i was curious with how Robin Williams will come out. Sy, the Photo Guy turned out very well for Robin Williams.
Williams plays a lonely photo developer clerk who's obsessed with the Yorkin family. Everytime Mrs. Yorkin has films developed, Sy (williams) creates a duplicate copy of his own and pastes them on his home wall. To him, they are the perfect happy family. Its the kind of family he was to be part of.
But things turn sour when he finds out Mr. Yorkin is having an affair. He finds this out from the mistress who had their pictures developed at the photo shop where Sy works.
The conflict here becomes apparent. Sy becomes disturbed. Why do people only take photos only of happy moments and hide the sad moments to themselves? After seeing happy photos of the Yorkins then later finds out that they're not so perfect at all, and his illusions shattered, he vents out his anger on the unsuspecting family.
This is the kind of psychological and emotional conflict you'll find in this movie. Absorbing until the end, One Hour Photo takes you effectively into the mind of Sy, the Photo Guy.
While the concept and the story was good, I just found it a little slow. But this is not to say this is a bad movie, actually thinking back when i was watching it, it was a great movie, with all the psychological stuff and the suspense. But somehow it just didn't create the kind of impact other people felt, hence the 3 stars.

1784751,4,B00006LA87,"Robin Williams is the doorway into this movie: it's his performance that makes the whole thing possible. But underneath his brilliant portrayal is a structure that doesn't quite work.
My primary objection to ONE HOUR PHOTO is the artsy flavor it was given by writer-director Mark Romanek. For example, the pristine white of the SavMart is unheard of in the real world: these are the bargain basement stores--they're never this well-stocked or well-kept. What that does is change how the viewer relates to the story: it doesn't take place in the store down the street--it takes place in some fantasy world where perfection is the norm.
Given Sy's black-and-white view of the world, the perfect backdrop could depict more his perception than the reality--his wish for what his world should be--but it never really feels like that. Sy is not a guy in his own world who is trying to understand why things aren't better for him--Sy is a guy who wants to live in the world of the photos he develops. He doesn't see a perfect world he doesn't fit into: he sees the photos as a window on the perfect world he wants desperately to be a part of. Perhaps the excessive sterility of the SavMart is supposed to feel unreal and oppressive to him to the point where he needs to escape it, but overall the look-and-feel of the settings seem to clash with where the story is coming from and what it's trying to achieve.
Even so, Romanek has given us a profoundly disturbing look at the world we live in and asked us all to define for ourselves what right and wrong really are. Is Sy's behavior more ""wrong"" than Will's?
Williams portrays Sy as a disturbed, alienated man who is just trying to find a place where he belongs, and his astonishing performance is the centerpiece of the film (he's in almost every scene). That his angst and struggle is as familiar and poignant as it is disturbing underscores Romanek's questions about our world. Sy could be any person you pass on the street, and his obsession, while extreme, is both morally correct and, ultimately, harmless.
Romanek and Williams are asking us to look at the familiar strangers in our world and wonder if the boundaries around our proper societal roles aren't preventing us from noticing and understanding a troubled soul...a struggling comrade...a good, loyal, gentle friend. He's further warning us that following the boundaries and ignoring the people who are reaching out to us could ultimately be a lot more dangerous than taking a chance and letting them in.",1046908800,,2512,4.763761467889908

Savmart is Sy's kingdom, he fits in so well that he is almost a walking, talking part of the store (right down to the matching colors in his clothes).  Sy's personal life stands in stark contrast, he is swallowed up in the white on white of his apartment's dreary and hoplessly lonely spaces.  Is it any wonder that Sy becomes more and more infatuated with the only sense of a nuclear family he has ever known (we find out that he suffered immensely at the hands of his family)?  In fact the only warmness in Sy's whole existence is in his ""family room"" where he has a supremely disturbing wall covered top to bottom with the warm inviting pictures of the Yorkins.  Ironically it is when Sy becomes too close to the Yorkins that his idealistic dreams are crushed, and he feels that he must right this worldly wrong.

Either way, Williams is fired because auditing notices a discrepancy in the number of photos printed to the number sold. PLEASE! Yes Williams has a wall full of photos at home, but even a thousand photos over 10 years is going to disappear in the paperwork. The boss who looks like the guy who played Lumburg in Office Space fires him because the home office is peeved and someone is going down and its not going to be Lumborg. Preposterous in that Lumburg as the store manager knows anything about the photo department anyway, but the fact that such tight auditing is done when we know that anyone can refuse to pay for prints that are botched is just a silly plot device to drive Williams over the edge.

Not expecting much, having being disappointed with Robin Williams's latest choice of roles, Insomnia an exception, I was really engrossed in this psychological thriller that is not your average dose of blood, gore and predictable endings.
Although not a masterpiece, it is nonetheless powerful and very well directed by Romanek, a director that shows a lot of promise.
It is primarily a character study, that of lonely photo guy, Sly, who becomes obssesed with a family he has been servicing  for years. It would have been all your average 'Hands that Rocks the Cradle' type of psychos's obsession, had it not being for the wonderful performance by Robin Williams, and the smartly written script. Williams is one of the greatest actors in living memory, and although he has made his name in comedies from his TV Mork days, it is in drama that his talent takes a very different and equally powerful outlet.
His words are few and far between, yet his facial expressions perfectly conveying so many emotions..He is anguished, bitter, angry, and yes lonely..very..

I'd heard good word about One Hour Photo, but went into it knowing little beyond the observation that Robin Williams' character was creepy. That didn't surprise me. I've always felt that, beneath the machine-gun style joke slinging, there is something, well, pathological about Mr. Williams. No, I don't think he is a psychopath like his character in this movie. However, let's just say that I always felt that being creepy was part of his less well advertised repertoir. (Come on. Patch Adams was creepy. Admit it.)
Let me cut to the chase. This movie is about the writing; about the directing; about the cinematography; and, mostly, about a stunning, understated performance by Williams. There are some flaws here. The actors who play the suburban family on whom Williams' character obsesses turn in relatively weak performances; but, fortunately, their roles are small. Williams so dominates the screen, and does his work so well, that it isn't a distraction that the rest of the world he inhabits seems a bit two dimensional (much like all those photographs in which he lives). I should note that the actor who plays his boss at the SavMart turns in a solid performance, as well. This is critical since Williams' fate at the SavMart, at the hands of this boss, is the core, and entirely credible, linchpin around which this psychological thriller revolves.
The music and sound effects are generally used well, although they are a bit heavy handed at times. And the interesting shots and colors are reminiscent of artistic photography--adding a magnificent texture and appeal to the film.

I recently rented One Hour Photo after months and months of waiting for it to come on video. The only flaw with this movie is that it felt like it was 96 seconds long. In reality the movie is 96 minutes long. After seeing it on video I decided that I really wanted to see it again. Therefore I bought it and watched it again today. It felt as if the movie got better the second time I saw it. Well mabey not better. The word that I should have used was ""still excellant."" It didn't have the element of surprise when I watched it today but it was still great.
The thing that makes the movie what it is is the premise. It has a fantastic orignal storyline. People have stalked people and became obbessed with people from seeing them and talking to them. Nobody ever thought about the people who find out things about other people's lives through there picture. What a fantastic element of thriller Mark Romanek(the writer and director of One Hour Photo) thought up with.
Lighting gave the mood of the movie. The lighting was also always different with diffeent kinds of sets. When you saw the photo lab it was very white, when you saw Sy's fantasies about the family he loves it is colorful and happy. When you see the reality of the family it is a little bit colorful but also a little dark. When you saw what Sy did towards the end it was extremly dark.
The score was the last thing that the crew of the movie did that wowed me. The music was perfect to this type of movie. Those of you who have seen the movie might know about the music being played when Sy is running in the hotel. It was just fantastic and pretty soon I saw myself humming the theme of that music.
Finally the plot. I have talked about everything that has been showen in the movie except the plot. The film opens with Sy(Robin Williams) caught. I never approved of flashback stories...especially in a thriller. In this movie you know that Sy gets caught by the police in the end. That is a minor flaw that all movies that do that have. Sy starts his story with the Yorkins. Nina Yorkin(Commie Nielson) loves taking picture of her son Jake(Dylan Smith) and her husband Will(Michael Vartan). She gets them devopled at the local Savmart where Yoshi and his co worker Sy work. Sy have developed the Yorkins picture since Jake was a baby and eventually thinks that he is part of the family or ""Uncle Sy"" Nina and Jake like Sy but not as much as Sy likes them. Sy thinks that the Yorkins are the perfect family but he doesn't know that Nina and Will fight about money issues and Jake hears them fighint. Sy thinks of Jake as his nephew and gives him a free disponisble camera for his birthday which just pasts. Nina doesn't know the dedication that Sy puts into the family's photo's more then anyone eles's. But with his contact with the family in the store(at the lab and in the store's isle's when Will goes shopping there)the store's manenger Bill Owens(Gary Cole) becomes increasly concerned with Sy. Bill lays Sy off which is the first thing that gets Sy angry. The raging point of Sy is when he finds out that Will is having an affair with Maya Burson(Erin Daniels). Not to ruin anything in between that and the eventual involment with police detective James Van Der Zee(played fantasticly by Eriq La Salle)

1784771,5,B00006LA87,"There are many films that delve into the mind of psychotics - some of the better known psychopaths in film history are Norman Bates of Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" (1960), Dr. Hannibal Lecter of Jonathan Demme's ""Silence of the Lambs"" (1991) and Patrick Bateman of Mary Harron's ""American Psycho"" (2000).  Now comes a sleeper from director Mark Romanek called ""One Hour Photo"" that presents us with an all-new breed of lunatic - he's the type that even mindful people least suspect.
Meet Seymour Parrish (Williams), better known to his co-workers as Sy, who works in the photo lab of a Wal-Mart-type department store prosaically dubbed Sav-Mart.  Day in and day out, Sy takes roll after roll of film, developing each with a sense of pride and an incentive for high quality.  Most of what comes to life in the dark room are images of birthday parties, weddings, anniversaries, vacations and the occasional amateur pornography.  But of all his regular customers, there is one in particular who fascinates him the most.  Nina Yorkin (Nielsen), who makes a drop-off nearly every other week at Sav-Mart's photo lab, has a picturesque existence - Will (Vartan), her handsome husband with a five-figure income, their cute kid Jakob (Smith), a classy wardrobe and a home with pages directly torn from an Ethan Allen catalog.  Sy is in love with her seemingly immaculate life and unbeknownst to both Nina and Sav-Mart management, he has made and kept additional copies of each roll of film she has turned in for the last eight years.
So involved does Sy become with the goings-on in the Yorkins' life that he soon starts following them around, attending one of Jakob's soccer scrimmages and driving halfway across town to a mall where Nina regularly shops.  His obsession with the Yorkins eventually escalates to spying and one day a roll of film turned in by a familiar face reveals a dirty secret behind the Yorkins' pristine faade.
Mark Romanek, who has had very little experience with major motion picture directing (most of his work is based in TV and a little dabbling in music video), has done a fantastic job in rendering the stark contrast between Sy's monotonous reality and Nina's boisterous routine.  There is also an emphasis on color, Sav-Mart and Sy's apartment both barren and blanched (even Sy's wardrobe is toneless) and the Yorkins' home drenched in warm, neutral tones with soft light.  The color green appears more than once, symbolic to either affliction (physical/mental) or envy (both make sense considering the film's subtext).
Williams is spectacular as Sy, radiating a kaleidoscope of conflicting emotion - sympathy, anger, frustration, despondency and even atonement.  While Sy's actions are considered bizarre and a little disturbing from a bystander's perspective, he still manages to evoke sympathy for his behavior, his desolation justifying his preoccupation with the Yorkins' charmed life.  This is a turn equal to his Oscar-winning performance in 1998's ""Good Will Hunting"" and such an abysmal dive into a character that we forget we are watching an erstwhile comedian - Williams becomes a veritable monster.  What elicits the most chills are his prolonged gazes at the snapshot mosaic that covers nearly the entire wall of his achromatic living room - his expression is vacant, his eyes icy pools of incomprehension.  What is this quiet and outwardly unassuming man capable of?  Stalking?  Blackmail?  Murder?

Nielsen and Vartan do fine as Nina and Will Yorkin and Gary Cole manages to play another hard-nosed character as Bill Owens, Sav-Mart's general manager.  Eriq LaSalle makes a brief but smart appearance as Det. James Van Der Zee and the rest of the cast does their best with their small amounts of material.  Of course, we aren't really meant to notice the supporting players - it's very clear from the start that Williams is the film's essence.
In its entirety, ""One Hour Photo"" is pretty much a one-man show and Williams exalts the film with little effort. For those who are still skeptical of his dramatic capabilities, ""Awakenings"" and ""Good Will Hunting"" should erase nearly all doubt.  But please, rent this little ditty first - it is indeed his best performance to date, sadly overlooked by this year's Academy Awards.",1046563200,,4261,5.051355206847361
1784772,5,B00006LA87,"I have been a fan of Robin Williams since ""Mork and Mindy"". His wit and body language fascinate me and his humor talks to me. I was priveleged to see him perform live once and had an opportunity to meet him at a reception after the performance. He is as funny in person as he is on the screen and meeting him was a real thrill.
I have followed his career closely and have seen every movie that he has been in. Sometimes I am disappointed in his choice of film and don't feel that he has had the opportunities that he should have to really shine in some of these performances. However, ""One Hour Photo"" is an exception. Robin is outstanding in this film. And I call this a film, rather than a movie because I feel that it deserves recognition as a work of art, rather than an entertainment vehicle. Robin Williams disappears into the character of Sy Parrish. With his hair cut short and his eyes concealed by aviator style, outdated glasses, that manic character we all love is gone. Sy comes alive and while we watch his calm exterior, we know that underneath is a churning caldroun of anger, fear, resentment and jealousy. He is truly superb.
The conclusion of this film is stunning in that it is unpredictable. We expect murder, everything seems to be leading up to that. Instead, Sy ""rapes"" the characters with his camera and humiliates an erring husband so harshly the viewer can almost empathize with him. It is a masterful twist to a storyline which continues to build in tension up to the last frame. I loved it.
I hope that Robin Williams will continue to develop as a character actor. I was impressed with his versatility in ""One Hour Photo,"" and think that he may be on the right track. Let's face it, he's been in some real stinkers. The man has talent but it is obvious that he needs the right vehicle. This one was right on the money.",1046563200,,1847,4.419354838709677

The films basic plot is about a lonely photo developer who becomes obsessed with photos as a work of art.  He feels they are very special with each picture taken.  He even develops a philosphy about pictures and the moment it presents.  I feel that Robin Williams was the perfect actor for this one because of his soft spoken personality.  Even though his past filims have not been as creepy as this one.  Without giving away the climax of the film he starts to dream about the family that he could have and perhaps one day.  He becomes so obssessed with this he starts taking hundreds of pictures using the negatives that people have taken for him to develop and then posts them on his wall.  You get the feeling hes going to murder somone or does he?  I won't give away the ending because it makes the movie interesting because the first half is a little slow to build character development.  The last half of the film is rather suspenseful.
It makes you wonder next time that perhaps maybe you should use digital cams.
I have given it 4 stars because the ending is a little bit of a let down because it built you so high for something big to happen and then nothing happens.",1046390400,,1284,4.398305084745763

His apartment is symbolically white with very little furniture or decorations other than the hundreds of photos he has taken of the Yorkin family and put up on his wall.  He gently insinuates himself into the Yorkins' life by attending the son's soccer practice and striking up a conversation with the wife at a fast food restaurant.  Things come to a head when Sy discovers that all is not well in the Yorkin home and he sets out to extract revenge from an unfaithful family member.

Good spooky dream scene where Robin Williams' face does something very interesting, but the psychological impact of the movie is thin as we really know scant little about the main character, so we have no idea why he's got a wallful of pictures, complete with lights, of a family he is obsessed with. Because he's a lonely picture developing guy? Uh, whatever. Normal lonely people don't do these things-sick, medication starved, chemical deficient folks do. I just don't get the point. Sexy Connie Nielsen doesn't even bother to take her clothes off. Why does the movie exist, then? Shock? Criticism? I'm open to ideas, but as for now, this movie isn't worth buying just to see Robin Williams take a malevolent turn.",1046390400,,753,4.890625
1784776,2,B00006LA87,"What did this film want to be? It's too dull to be a psychodrama and contains too many vauge cliches to be a melodrama. It misfires on too many details to produce a truly engaging picture.
Every supposedly creepy scene is lathered with dark musical notes and tones directing us to feel icky. Robin Williams character (Sy) provides narration informs the audience of the obvious. The portrait painted of Sy is flimsy and one dimensional. Throughout the film, Robin Williams walks slowly and in a dilberate fashion as if he were wearing a leaky diaper. The portrait painted of the admired family (The Yorkins) is too shallow for us to really care about their experience.
If this family seems so warm and inviting to Sy, how could they have been dropping off their film to him for the past 9 years and hardly know him. Mr. and Mrs. Yorkin come off as self absorbed yuppie hipsters who just happen to shop at the local supermart.
We only take pictures of happy events and not depressing moments. By way of narration, Sy expresses his understanding of this. Yet Sy is supposed to believe in the perfection of the Yorkins family and ultimately cracks when reality of their unperfect existence is revealed. Okaaaay.
Other crappy things happen to Sy to help push him over the edge and to help us feel bad for him. There is an inherent sadness to the lives of people who are truly alone. Sy's sad moments, however are morsels of a poorly crafted premise meant to spoonfeed us through a story about as intriguing as meatloaf.",1046390400,6,1514,4.631970260223048

""Sy"" Perish, the ""photo guy"" seems like a nice enough man who takes extra care with the photos of the people who come to his counter. Unfortunately for Nina Yorkin (Connie Nielsn), her husband (Michael Vartan) and their son Jake (Dylan Smith), Sy is not who he appears to be. As Sy's life becomes lonelier and his obsession with the family grows, he convinces himself that he's part of their seemingly picture-perfect life. What happens next will leave your spine tingling.
Directed by Mark Romanek, this edge-of-the-seat thriller is one of the best in recent years, refreshigly not going the Hollywood route with a conventional ending. The climax is shocking, disturbing, and extremely suspenseful and creepy.
Sy Parish is a unique villian who manages to make you care for him despite the lives he successfully manages to destroy. Robin Williams is perfection in a rare film role for him. His supporting cast, which also includes Eric La Salle and Gary Cole, are also top-notch. You will never look at the One Hour Photo Shop the same way again.

But we all knew how it was going to end and it was no big surprise. I would have loved to given this 5 stars but it was not that great. But it ws good. Robin Williams is better playing weird characters instead of ""joke every 2 seconds"" characters. Showing the ending scene at the begining gave a lot of it away. And him laying out the pictures at the end was totally lame. But I did like the way he [messed] with his boss' head. That was cool.",1046217600,,578,3.9913793103448274

He furthermore proves his skills as a writer/director in this incredible picture, a Hitchcockian thriller that will leave you Spellbound.
Sy Parrish is a loner, and the only comfort he finds is in the family that he's developed pictures for, for almost ten years.
As he develops a relationship with this family, a 'surrogate' family for him, he finds himself falling more deeply obsessed with them. Then, the fateful day, he is fired from his job, at his 'Sav-Mart'...and plunges into utter chaos....
When he finds, on his last day on the job, that this 'picture perfect' family is not so perfect, he finds himself in a whirlwind of psychological chaos, almost like Michael Douglas in 'Falling Down', but in a much more subdued way...
I won't say more, for fear of 'giving away' the ending, but suffice it to say that this pic is visually stylistic, completely 'on the edge of your seat', and the ending will leave you thinking about it for days. It's not for everyone, I agree, but for someone who wants a thriller that has an unusual twist, plus visuals that will knock your socks off, this is the one...

I expected more at the end.  A bigger payoff.  A surprise.  A complication.  Something.  It just kind of ended.  Maybe I would have complained if it have been some kind of contrived, unrealistic fantastic conclusion, but I think the writer could have come up with something more.  Maybe not.
Williams was spectacular--one of the creepiest performances in my recent movie-viewing history.  The cinematography and costuming were excellent--great use of color (or the lack thereof) to symbolize the ""ordinariness"" of Sy's life.  OK supporting roles--nobody spectacularly good or bad.  The idea for the story and the plot itself are extremely creative and clever (the wall of pictures in Sy's house is one of the more disturbing non-violent images in recent memory, as well).  It just doesn't come together well enough for me at the end, which cost it a five-star rating for me.  The buildup to the climax was steady, logical, and progressive.  Then it ends. . . .  I don't mind a ""head-scratcher,"" as long as it is for ""thinking"" reasons (i.e., MEMENTO, THE USUAL SUSPECTS, etc.)--everything doesn't have to be tied up in a thoughtless package with a pretty bow for me.  With that much anticipation, though, the script writer needed to come up with an ending that is worthy of that anticipation.

1784781,4,B00006LA87,"This is a film that, had it been handled with less originality and had the performances (especially Robin Williams') been less on target, would have been a mere genre picture; the kind where an obsessive nanny/babysitter/tenant/fill-in-the-blank terrorizes an unsuspecting family. One Hour Photo, however, goes quite beyond the cliches of such movies and deals in a fresh manner with topics such as the reasons people take pictures, the sterility of modern workplaces, loneliness and, of course, obsession. Robin Williams is not as miscast as you might think as the loner whose entire life revolves around the pictures he develops at SavMart's photo counter. In a much-needed departure from his usual sappy roles, Williams turns his kindly, naive personality an additional few degrees into madness. SavMart is perfectly conveyed as the generic modern shopping center, with endless aisles and an oppressive whiteness that pervades everything. The entire movie is filled with scenes of such vast, impersonal spaces; these images tell a story of their own, apart from (though not unrelated to) that of the characters. Williams plays Sy Parrish, who is is fixated upon a seemingly ideal family. When he takes pictures of them, he saves prints for himself. He covers the walls of his apartment with these photos. In the fantasy world he inhabits, Sy is an extended family member. Things fall apart for Sy when his boss discovers his transgression and fires him. At the same time, he makes a disconcerting discovery about a member of his adopted family. Sy's behavior as his delusionary world begins to crumble, though it is handled in an interesting and suspenseful way, is not really the point of this film. It is actually an inquiry into the elements that make up modern life and how fragile these can be.",1045958400,6,1802,5.091216216216216

1784783,5,B00006LA87,"""One Hour Photo"" is a clever, offbeat movie that is perhaps 2002's creepiest thriller. Its premise may be unlikely but it's still chillingly plausible. What if that nice man at the store where you have your photos developed has a dangerous obsession with your family? What if alienation and loneliness causes him to start acting out his fantasies?
Seymour Parrish [Robin Williams] is a quiet but pleasant middle-aged man who has worked for years in the photo department of a local discount store. He lives alone in a forlorn apartment. His social interactions seem limited to the store. This is the place where Nina and Will Yorkin, an apparently ideal couple has had family photos developed since their eight-year old son was an infant. What they don't know is that Seymour has made them his `adopted' family. He fantasizes about being a beloved relative. The Yorkins, however, turn out not to be the perfect family, and when Seymour discovers this, he goes off the deep end.
Robin Williams gives one of his finest performances as Seymour and is even scarier than he was as the killer in ""Insomnia"". Connie Nielson and Michael Vartan are quite convincing as the Yorkins. The movie's set and art design are especially good, strikingly contrasting Seymour's cold, blue-white world with the warm, earthy tones of the Yorkins'.
""One Hour Photo"" is more than a mere thriller. It is a vivid portrait of an ordinary man torn apart by the ravages of alienation. On the surface, Seymour is a monster, but underneath, he is a soul in torment - one I can not help but feel empathy for. Though it's not always easy to watch, I recommend this one highly.",1045958400,4,1642,4.785211267605634
1784784,5,B00006LA87,"This quiet movie begged for a commentary in its DVD format. I hoped I could learn more about what Sy was thinking through comments made by the director and Robin. I am very satisfied with it. The segment where Robin and the director do an interview with Charlie Rose is typical. Robin going off on tangents, seemingly auditioning new characters, saying things that are funny but hard to absorb. Like Dennis Miller on Monday Night Football. For the full movie's commentary, Robin is surprisingly subdued. He isn't quiet but he stays in the same gear and is funnier for it, in my opinion. One thing I may never understand is what happened to the roll of film we see Sy shoot near the ending? When the police process the film, it's yet another twist. Did he swap rolls or did he ""pretend,"" as he said during the ""shoot""?
Even people who don't like Robin will find this movie interesting, thought provoking and spooky. I fear this film will be passed over by many as I saw on Halloween, when I was dressed as Sy in his full store uniform. Some people got it right away, others didn't. At a large Halloween party with a contest, I was given a nomination for ""Scariest Male."" When I made the second round and was being judged by the head judges, one whispered to me: ""Scariest? I don't get it."" I'm not qualified to say if Robin could win an Oscar for this performance as I don't see a lot of movies.  2002 was not a good year for movies, in my opinion. If Steve Buscemi could be nominated for his performance in Ghost World (another good, quirky flick), I guess it's possible that Robin could get the nod.",1045785600,,1600,4.423728813559322

But outside of the store his life is unspeakably dull, and lonely.

Unfortunately, when he realizes through the photos he develops that this family is far from ideal, his life begins to fall apart and the tension really starts to build.

The character Sy is a study in cinematic pathos: you're feeling sorry for him pretty early in the movie, though later on you'll question whether he deserves your sympathy. The movie leaves a lot of questions unanaswered. Is Sy truly evil or just well-meaning and deranged at the same time? Are the people in the photos really happy? Does everyone hide behind a photogenic facade? Are we all leading a sort of double life - the one in the photo albums and the one we live every day? This film will get you thinking.
No matter how you slice it, Williams puts on a brilliant and believable performance. Yeah, he's been Mork and Patch Adams, but he's quite good at playing the dark side. The other actors play their parts pretty well. Connie Nielsen does a great job as Nina, the object of Sy's obsession. Michael Vartan's performance as Nina's husband is competent but otherwise unremarkable. Eriq La Salle of ER fame has a bit part as a cool but one-dimensional detective, and Gary Cole's part as the store manager is much more likable (and human) than the manager he played in Office Space.

Sy takes a liking to the family - a young married couple and their 9-year-old son - and always makes an extra set of their pictures...to plaster all over his wall. In his wildest fantasies, he is part of this family. He is ""Uncle Sy"". Not just ""Sy, the photo guy"".
One Hour Photo is a creepy film. Sy is obviously a borderline psycho, but you can't help but feel for the guy. On the outside, he seems like a normal guy, but on the inside he is a bit dilusional - and very lonely. For some reason, this one family has sparked his interest the most out of all of his regular customers (even ranking higher than the ""amateur porn guy""); I think it's because he never had what they have - a perfect little life, with each other.
This is not your typical suspense thriller. I'm not sure it can even be considered a thriller at all. Actually, I think of it as being a psychological thriller.

There's nothing conventional about One Hour Photo. Our film's eye has been tricked into believing movies are extreme. We assume certain things would happen, but then we see it through real eyes and we understand why things are the way they are.
We don't follow the story of a psycopath. We are following the story of a man that has no one. A man that has such a dull life, but daily gets to look into the seemingly wonderful lives of others.
Think about it. What do you capture on film? Great moments. To this tortured soul who has so few great moments, he sees families so happy. Lives he wants to be a part of. He lives through them, and only wishes he could be a part of them. If you look at this movie with a heart you'll see it's more sad than it is scary.

It's rather creepy to see Robin Williams playing such a creepy character, but surprisingly, he does an excellent job with the wackiness.
I thought the coloring of each scene was interesting.  The majority of the movie is done is white and ""cold"" colors.  They definitely invoke a sociopathic feeling.  Of course, at the Yorkin house (the one place that Sy really wants to be) there is a warm yellow-ish tone.  It definitely sets the mood.
The movie is not as suspenseful as it is promoted to be.  It's got a good premise, but the writing is lacking.  I think that it would've been better with a little more development of certain parts.
Luckily, the talented cast makes up for what is lacking, and that's why I give it 4 stars.",1045526400,3,970,4.6647058823529415
1784795,5,B00006LA87,"Don't expect One Hour Photo to be spoon fed. This movie will force you to generate some of your own conclusions about you've witnessed.
Robin Williams gives one of his best performances to date as an appearingly mild mannered yet devious photo clerk who takes his job as a photo tech at the local ""Sav-Mart' a bit too serious because it appears to be all he has.
His emotional pathology becomes progressively evident and alarming as he becomes increasingly 'over-involved' with a family that brings in their photos to his store for processing. Although he blatantly oversteps some major boundaries, he does so in such a way that the seriousness of his disturbance is not realized soon enough. Some of his bizarre behaviors lead your thoughts to very dark places while at the same time, the pity his character generates, makes you want to believe that maybe his motivations really aren't that pathological.
Because Williams character evokes such a wide range of emotion, your own feelings towards him vaccilate.  He is devious yet likable even amidst his pervading creepiness. Although appearingly generally mild mannered and timid, he has his moments of assertiveness and later, 'over the edge' aggressiveness and righteous indignation.
The cinematography and visual imagery is excellent and brilliantly contrasts the drab, washed out and somewhat color-less life of William's character to that of the vivid and vibrant family he becomes ""focused"" on.
It's a good psychological thriller.  Like a photo snapshot, there's much more to this film than what we see on the surface.",1045440000,32,1575,5.1484375
1784796,5,B00006LA87,"One Hour Photo is one of the most unique films of the year, and is a definite one of the most worthy for any type of awards out there (although i say the academy awards and Oscars don't mean squat anymore, this is one of the few films worthy of truelly winning that, like One flew over the Cuccos NEst and ROcky).
The story behind this is that Robin Williams plays clerk at a one hour photo shop.  He has been working there for 20+ years and over the pst 9 has helped this wonderful family that he truely loves.  He is very friendly, but very introverted.  Hoever this family fills hinm with joy, they are like the perfect family to him.  However his boss does not like him, and tries to do whatever he can to get him fired.  Finally when he discovers that up to 100 photos have gone missing over the years, as well as a disposible camera that Williams character gave the son over, WIlliams loses his job.  In the course of this he hits a state of depression and he discovers shortly there after that the perfect family he admires, is not so perfect, as the husband has been cheating on the wife, and the Mistress has been photographing the whole ordeal.  These turn of events leads to a very chilling very sad ending that wraps up  this really unique movie.
I also got the feeling that either the Writer or the Director was a Neon Genesis Envangellion Fan because of frequent looks on that and also how WIlliams Character went through a shocking and drastic change much like Shinji did in NEon Genesis Envangellion (If you have no idea what I am talking about, Neon Genesis is an Anime sereis that is around 25 episodes and is very strange but very powerful).
I am giving this movie 5 stars because it is that damn good.  However in all honesty it is one of those movies that you can only wath once, because after that it starts to lose it's effect.  Maybe I will look back on it in a few years, but really this is a classic that should not be missed.",1045440000,3,1952,4.279891304347826
1784797,5,B00006LA87,"People at indie film company Killer Films did it again.  After making impressive films like ""Boys Don't Cry"" and ""Hedwig and Angry Inch"" (or not so impressive ""Office Killer""), they produced another film with a serious theme.  But don't worry; despite its subject matter, ""One Hour Photo"" is not as schocking as ""Taxi Driver.""  No strange haircut, no handguns in the sleeve, but just Sy, loneliest guy in the world.
Robim Willimas, after 3 years' absence, throws away any good-guy image he gathered in the 90s, and becomes Sy Parrish, one hour photo techinician working at a counter in a huge shopping center.  He works earnestly, takes his job seriously, and, most of all, is utterly lonely.  His only (day)dream is to be 'Uncle Sy' of his customer and picture perfect family Mr. and Mrs. Yorkin (read 'Your Kin'), whose life Sy hopelessly longs for.  But soon we learn that Sy can no longer handle his fantasy, and we are going to see his illusion run amok, making him stalk around the family.  And everything rushes to the disaster when Uncle Sy knows something he should not know about the family.
The film owns its enormous power to Robin Williams's creepy performance as Sy, who gradually loses the control of himself.  Though you may feel he looks (or sounds) like Patch Adams at first, you soon forget that sense, thanks to his strong acting.  By accepting the role of this lonely man, he once again after the good turn in ""Insomnia"" shows his will to extend his faculty as an actor, and he shows it well.  In fact, he has already shown another aspect of acting in his cameo role of terrorist in ""The Secret Agent"" (Joseph Conrad's film version), but never fully achieved the result.  But now he did it.
But ""One Hour Photo"" is helped by other factors; supporting actors Michael Vartan (Drew's teacher in ""Never Been Kissed"") and Connie Nielsen (""Gladiator"") are both good, but the film's strength, in my opinion, comes from its production designs, music, and photography.  They all contribute to creating the cold, detached atomosphere of the film, and their effort is effectively shown in the manufactured feeling of the shopping place, with symmetrical shots of the unnnaturally clean and  white interiors.  That comes as no surprise when you know that production designer Tom Foden's previous work was Jennifer Lopez's thriller ""The Cell"" and photographer Jeff Cronenweth worked for ""Fight Club"" (by the way, his father Jordan Cronenweth may be much more famous for his ""Blade Runner"").
""One Hour Photo"" has some minor flaws -- dream sequence that looks out of tune, and flashback structure of narrative, for instance -- but the film is fascinating as a character study of Sy, this very lonely guy.",1044576000,10,2710,4.8503253796095445

Robin Williams gives the performance of his career as Sy, The Photo Guy. A very clever trailer and promotional campaign ensure your expectations are headed in one direction while Mark Romanek's subtle screenplay quietly reveals its true and more complex intent. Reinhold Heil and Johnny Klimek's unsettling score and Tom Foden's thoughtful production design conspire brilliantly to take this simple story to new levels of tension. This is not only a brilliant second feature from Romanek but a brilliant film in its own right, made all the more satisfying because it doesn't resort to explaining everything - Romanek leaves the audience with plenty of work to do, and plenty to think about: most importanty, how often do we accept the 'picture perfect' people and demonize those who are different without having any understanding of either of their lives? From the tone of the reviews, plenty of viewers were diappointed that this didn't deliver the kind of horrific, blood-soaked climax they were expecting. But that's part of the point: if you think about the kind of backstory which drove Sy to do what he did, then you realise it's far more chilling than any orgy of violence could have been.

1784801,5,B00006LA87,"One Hour Photo is a film of supreme caliber. The film is powered by the haunting, chilling, silencing, and above all-genius performance by Robin Williams. But the rather extroardinary thing is that it is not Robin Williams on the screen, it's Sy Parish (the character's name). Robin Willliams fades away from our senses and slips into the ever so sweet and innocent yet psychotic role of a supermarket's photo developer. The films script is only accented by Williams, at times, restrained performance. Williams ignites on the screen and burns till the last frame, and you are unable to take your eyes off him. As I mentioned the film is sublimly written as well as directed. Though being Romanek's first, I certainly don't think this is a bad start. Romanek's direction adds to the on-going tension throughout the film. More affecting is Williams' delightful calmness. Trying to hold himself in becomes more troublesome for both Williams and his character as the story develops. Yet through the calm eyes of an innocent blaze the fires of hatred and intensity, which could very well sum up Williams' performance. The film does have some disturbing images as well. Yet they are not really strong enough for you to get up from your seat and leave yet rather the opposite. Williams' contribution as well as guidance towards the actions and scenes of peril compell as well as amaze you towards both the performance and film itself. Williams' shocking contribution to the screen is enough to make you cry, scream, and yell in your seat. Because the origins of the character are bittersweet just like own known Williams, leads to a crazed and psychotic breakdown. It's as if watching our own funny and beloved Robin fail us. Though the truth could not be any further, Williams but succeeds in the art of acting, creating an achievment in the field. Creating a landmark. Writing his/its own chapter. I guarantee that this film will be required study material in acting classes for now on. So to conclude: although we were bombarded with great films this past year of 2002, like Minority Report, Insomnia, and the soon-to-comes Gangs of New York and Catch Me If You Can, this was probably my favorite of the year.",1039219200,2,2205,4.867021276595745

1784803,2,B00006LA87,"Let me say right at the start, ""I get it."" The movies SUPPOSED to be stylized and it's supposed to be sterile. But, oh dear me, but.
There's so much to pick at in this movie and, unfortunately, none of it's meat. Robin Williams plays his part with such restraint that he's in danger of disappearing completely in this, frankly, boring movie.
Robin's is a fixated photo booth processing clerk - fixated on a family who seem to be photo addicts, judging by the amount of trade they put Robin's way. (If I took that many photos I'd a) be bankrupt and, b) be in danger of being committed to a mental institution but this family's rich so that's okay then.) The store in which Robin works (Savmart) is the cleanest, most well-stocked mart in the whole world - an essay in off-whites and pale blues, not a mark on the off-white floor (ever) and never an item missing or out of place on any shelf. Just to round off the (boring) picture here, Robin's uniform is also off-white and pale blue but that doesn't matter because Robin's own clothes are, yep, you got it.
Robin is off his rocker in this movie - as are the police. A unit called The Office of Threat Management is called in after Robin takes photographs - innocent photographs - of his boss' daughter. The Office of Threat Management (previewing Tom Cruise's unit in Minority Report) go after Robin with guns drawn, execute an illegal search of his apartment and then mobilize an entire police force to track him down even though, at this point, poor Robin has not committed a crime!
Sad stuff. The disbelief totally failed to be suspended and all I was left with ...",1034985600,3,1619,4.491525423728813
1784804,5,B00006LA87,"Sy Parrish is unusually enthusiastic about the job he has been doing for over 20 years, working in the photo lab of his local Savmart... the voiceover introduction we are given by him suggests an employee whose job is also his hobby. Unlike De Niro's character in Taxi Driver or Micheal Douglas in Falling Down, Sy does not seem to vent any of the unhappiness which comes through loneliness in his descriptions of the world he inhabits.
There is no talk of deteriorating moral or national standards, instead Sy seems to accept the artificial world that Savmart is. He can identify with the company's high customer service ethics as he too feels strongly about processing peoples photos with care and affection, he describes with reverance his regular customers, especially the Yorkin family who he feels a part of. That is the life that is explained to us in voice-over narrative however the life we see is very far from pleasant and the visual style of the film communicates this perfectly. Savmart is as vernacular and washed-out as a modern prison, everything flares with a harsh, glaring whiteness - the director has created such atmosphere that you can almost smell the antiseptic on the floor. The customers mill around in the background like zombies as Robin Williams subtle acting conveys a middle-aged man who looks ill at ease.
The crux of this story is his psychopathic fascination with the Yorkin family. He has taken duplicates of all their photos to keep for himself and has built a collage shrine of them over the years on the wall of his apartment. It is when we are shown a glimpse of this collage that we realise Sy's fixation is a sickness. When Sy loses his job over the unaccounted for prints that he has taken of the Yorkins his obsession begins to manifest itself as he becomes a dangerous stalker. Though not a complex script this film is so well directed and Williams performance so convincing that you will ponder the psyche of Sy well after the final credits have rolled.",1034726400,,1998,4.744252873563219

The story becomes truly sinister as we see Sy wants to become part of this family, by any way he can. Up to this point, the movie is great!
But will someone please tell me who wrote the last 30 minutes of the film? Surely, some stranger walked in to the screenwriter's office, took the script away from him, and finished it, without reading it. The ending's style didn't match the preceeding part at all. I kept thinking, ""Huh?"" It completely fell apart and any tension that was built up was lost. Too bad, because it started out so well.

1784806,4,B00006LA87,"One Hour Photo starring Robin Williams was another film I enjoyed over the weekend.  I've never seen Williams give such a serious performance.  Chilling, really.  He plays a 1-hr. photo store clerk who has a particular obsession with one family (the Yorkins) and tries to find ways to integrate himself with them.  Mostly he daydreams and watches from afar that is until he discovers the affair Will Yorkin is having behind his wife and son's back with a coworker.  This shatters his picture of a perfect family and a happy life.  What this epiphany leads him to do is something you'll have to watch the movie for.
As a side note.  I had to laugh at the blatant product placements used in the film.  It's not enough that Sy works at SavMart, but he also has to travel down the aisles and take a rest on a bed with Hello Kitty.  And what about the PlayStation game young Jake plays?  Or the Sony HDTV in the living room?  Or the fact that the husband even knows the brand of his wife's designer blouse?
You can tell I really have nothing bad to say, if all I could comment on was product placement.  You caught me.  This film really is a shining moment for Robin Williams.  One great movie!

what's so disturbing about this picture is not that Williams plays a repressed nice guy psycho, it's that viewers are made to buy the most bland stereo-types in the drama...Dad looks cool, but works too much on his computer and has an affair -- that's it -- I think he has 5 lines -- Mom, though somewhat caring, shops too much and spends all of dad's money and they fight once about that matter...and now to the boy -- we are supposed to like him because he's a boy -- and all boys are nice and play with plastic figures -- they neglect said boy, in a nice way, and Robin comes to the rescue in his deranged sort a way.
As for telling the story, they start with the end first -- that must have immediately placed it in the art houses 'cause that's the trendy convention to break these days...see ""Momento"" for an intellectual & dry version of the broken & reversed narrative

However, Robin Williams's acting is consistently high-quality throughout, and the ending has a very subtly freaky quality to it.  I imagine a bit TOO subtle for many viewers.  I mean, the freakiness was there, but the ending's impact was almost lost on me as well because it was so underemphasized.  A writer friend of mine loved it (saying that it gives us a peek into Robin's character's disturbed psyche), but I thought it could have pulled a bit more focus, you know.
""One Hour Photo"" is a quality piece of moviemaking definitely worth seeing (just seeing Robin Williams going away from his usual Mrs. Doubtfire/Aladdin's Genie-type fuzzy-feeling comic characters is a delight), but it is hurt by the hype generated by the critics and such.

1784812,4,B00006LA87,"Robin Williams gives what may well be the performance of his career in ""One Hour Photo,"" a creepy psychological thriller written and directed with cool precision by Mark Romanek.  Given its premise, the film could easily have degenerated into a sordid, exploitative tale of obsession and madness.  Instead, Romanek has chosen to take a more subtle approach, fashioning a film that downplays the potential violence of its material while, at the same time, recognizing the humanity of its central figure.
Romanek understands that the greatest threats to our safety and lives often come from the gray, nondescript people who surround us unnoticed, the ""nobodies"" whose benign faces and vacuous smiles reveal no trace of the insanity, evil and potential for doing us harm that may be lurking right there under the surface.  And nobody is ""grayer"" than Si Parrish, an innocuous, socially undeveloped milquetoast who spends his days working as a photo developer in one of those sterile five-and-dime drug stores (just like the one in ""The Good Girl"") - and his nights sitting all alone in his drab apartment brooding over a massive family-photo shrine he has erected to the Yorkins, a seemingly happy family of three whose pictures Si has been developing, copying and obsessing over for more than seven years now.  The film centers around Si's growing fixation with this one family and his delusional belief that he too could somehow become an integral part of their family unit.  Then comes the day when Si realizes that he is no longer content to be a mere vicarious member of this adopted family and, thus, begins his plan to gradually insinuate himself more and more directly into their lives.
As both writer and director, Romanek manages to keep us in a state of vague uneasiness throughout.  We are always anticipating some potentially dreadful event, yet Romanek doesn't go for the easy thrill or the obvious plot turn.  Thanks to Williams' subtle, incisive performance, we come to understand something of what makes this strange character tick.  We begin to sense the deep-seated loneliness and social awkwardness that have come to play such an important part in defining both his behavior and his character.  Si is scary, but he is also pathetic.  He may have slipped over the edge into madness, but it is a pathology rooted in overwhelming loneliness and the inability to ""fit in"" to the societal ""norm"" of marriage and family. Even when his character is at his most threatening and irrational, Williams somehow makes us care about him.
Romanek hits upon a few ancillary themes as well.  He acknowledges how photos create the appearance of a life without necessarily reflecting the reality of that life.  Most people, Si confesses, record only the ""special, happy"" moments of their lives - birthdays, weddings, holidays etc. and leave out the mundane or painful ones.  Moreover, Si tells us that people use pictures as a way of defeating aging and time, of saying to the world of the future that ""I"", this seemingly insignificant person, was really here, being happy and enjoying life.  To match this theme, Romanek's visual style often feels like the director's own personal homage to The Photograph, as the camera scans caressingly across a sea of snapshots - and Si's voiceover narration complements that feeling.

A down and out lonely man searching for some meaning in life through other peoples pain and loneliness.

To blithely characterize the movie as ""creepy"" or Sy Parrish as ""psychopathic"" seems wholly inaccurate, if not superficial.
Sy isn't twisted or horrific (like, say, Hannibal Lechter of _Silence of the Lambs_).  To me, at any rate, Sy is an intensely pathetic figure--not in the current sense of ""wretched,"" but in the original sense of ""evoking pathos"" (as in Tchaikovsky's _Pathetique_ Sympthony, the Sixth).
Sy is an individual whose soul has been ravaged--and as a child, no less, and in one of the most monstrous ways imaginable.  Miraculously, he hasn't become a soulless, apathetic figure, one who has lost the ability to give love or to be in need of it.  Nor has he become a monster himself, falling into the same perversions as his parent(s).  His methodologies are the problem, not his motives; he acts out of what seems to be a genuine love for his ""adopted"" family, the Yorkins.  His loneliness and pain have driven him to the point of obsession--and therein lies his tragic flaw.  But is it only his flaw, or is it also a reflection on American culture in some sense?
For those willing to reflect a bit more deeply, Sy's story is as much an indictment of American materialism and its unthinking, image-obsessed culture.  How many lonely, hurting souls are there who hunger for real love and fellowship, for genuine ""I-Thou"" relations, only to find themselves scorned and marginalized by a culture that prefers to function on the superficial and/or self-serving level of the ""I-It"" relation?  How many people lead lives that could be characterized by the ancient Hebraic proverb, ""A satisfied soul loathes the honeycomb, but to a starving soul any bitter thing is sweet""--?
A disturbing movie, yes; profoundly so.  But not for the reasons generally given.  The true horror is only portrayed indirectly: The tragedy of a soul reduced to the status of an ""It,"" first as a child, then as an adult.
An excellent movie, intensely thought provoking and poignant; highly recommended.",1032825600,4,2157,4.963888888888889
1784818,3,B00006LA87,"""One Hour Photo"" is Robin Williams' second (actually first, in the order they were filmed) foray into playing the mentally-disturbed bad guy.  Earlier, he was a writer-turned-killer in ""Insomnia,"" and now he's Sy Parrish, or Sy the Photo Guy, a seemingly innocuous photolab worker at the local Save-Mart (or some such...knockoff).  For the last thirteen years, he has developed pictures for people in the neighborhood, which means he has access to the private lives of these people, at least insofar as their lives are reflected in the pictures they take.
Sy has ""adopted"" the Yorkin family, a nuclear household that seems to have everything.  As Sy points out, ""everyone smiles in their pictures, because they are moments you want to remember.""  So, of course, Sy's view of the Yorkins is highly distorted: he never sees them fight, or spank their kid, or whatever goes on behind the closed doors in suburbia.  But Sy does discover something inadvertently by developing another customer's picture: Mr. Yorkin is having an affair with a woman from his office.  His vision of the prefect family ruined, Sy embarks on a mission to ""punish"" Yorkin for doing this to his wife and son.
What Sy does not know, but the audience does, is that Mrs. Yorkin is also having an affair, so it makes his ""Taxi Driver""-like psychotic binge a little less noble, because it shows the hypocrisy of people who only see part of the ""picture.""  (Picture, get it?)  What ""One Hour Photo"" has going for it is that its portrait of a very disturbed individual is very well done and complete: Sy's slide into insanity is wholly believable and fascinating to watch, but sickening, like a car wreck in front of your house.  Williams pulls this off with finesse, proving he's more than Mrs. Doubtfire in the acting department.  Not once is the audience subjected to a cutesy voice or manic mood swing.  Williams' descent is both steady and inevitable, and doesn't need to rely on such devices to be effective.
Where ""One Hour Photo"" fails is in its portrayal of suburban America and the reasons for Sy's initial instability.  The Save-Mart is a sterile, white-and-gray environment that looks more like a hospital than a store.  As another reviewer pointed out, anyone who has been in a Wal-Mart knows it is a veritable rainbow of color, trying to get consumers to buy, buy, buy.  Sy's house, and the Yorkin house, are equally sterile, and even the little boy's messy room looks like a setup.  For a movie that preaches not to examine things through a single lens, it fails in this endeavor itself, never rising above an insipid and tired view of suburbia (yeah, suburban life is hollow and hypocritical, WE GET IT ALREADY) and becoming so self-conscious that it is obvious the audience is seeing through a camera lens into a created environment.  Also, Sy's admission at the very end seems like it was tacked on to ""explain"" his behavior, and it robs Robin Williams of the dignity he had in creating a part where such an explanation was not necessary.  It would be like Jack Torrence at the end of The Shining saying, ""but my father was an alcoholic who beat me!""  Yuck.
On the whole, ""One Hour Photo"" is worth its 90-minute running time, but for a movie with such potential, it's a shame it could not realize more of it.

1784821,5,B00006LA87,"One Hour Photo is a high caliber psychological drama starring Robin Williams in his best performance to date. Here Robin's latest non-comedic role is that of Sy the Photo Guy, a friendless, familyless worker at a One Hour Photo shop whose abused childhood is about to catch up with him. He insinuates himself into the Yorkin family whom he developes film for, going so far as to read a Deepak Chopra book because he glimpses it in Nina Yorkin's (Connie Nielsen's) bag. The book quote he gives her gives a strong clue to the film's true theme, ""What we fear most already happened"".  Sy sees the Yorkins as the ideal family that he never had, making extra sets of their photos to put on his wall.
Throughout we get an ominous humming background soundtrack a la Safe as well as a violin motif borrowed from Requiem for a Dream (borrowed from Laurie Anderson). This film has been compared to Taxi Driver, but more appropriate comparison would be Midnight Cowboy.  The parallel to Joe Buck's isolation and naivetee, his disconnection with the TV and radio shows he watches/listens to for example is strikingly similar.  And both films are a subjective jump into the character's isolation, demons, and emotions.
 Sy's lid on those demons is blown when he sees photo evidence of Will Yorkin's (Michael Vartan's) infidelity...and gets fired by a fascist boss (Gary Cole). Detective Van Der Zee (Eriq La Salle) serves as liaison between Sy and the audience, as he tries to grasp what we try to. One significant hint is when he says, ""Well he knew that Yoshi (Paul Kim) would come to you and you would call us"", i.e. Sy set up this elaborate plan to get caught (to get attention).  And finally in cathartic release acts out his own abuse, his abusive father taking him over. Then the regression to the ideal childhood, hence the photos of objects a la Jake's photos. Importantly we don't know all this until the end, when he explains it to the detective...in a manner that can easily go over the heads of a mainstream audience.  What sums up Sy's tortured world best is the shock registered on the expression of Maya (Erin Daniels).

I saw this film on a Saturday and I was expecting the same great acting that Robin Williams served up in 'Insomnia' and a okay thiller movie.  What I got was much more.  By the time the credits finished rolling, 'One Hour Photo' was my favorite movie.  I saw a possiblity of nine Oscars.
Best Picture; If this movie doesn't get at least a Best Piture  nod, I will have offically filled the Oscars in the catergory as the People Choice Awards, Teen Choice Awards, American Movie Awards, and all those other meaningless award shows.
Best Director: Mark Romanek;  Through watching the movie, I could tell that Romanek really cared about the project and he really showed what movies are supposed to be.
Best Actor: Robin Williams;  If he doesn't get this award it will be the Academy's biggest mistake since bypassing Jim Carrey's proformance in 'The Truman Show'.  Williams' protrayl of Sy Parrish is one of the greatest things he has ever done, if not the best.  Sorry Hanks, but Williams has proved that he is the best actor this year.
Best Original Screenplay;  This movie proves my idea that any storyline can make a great movie.  Heck, with great writing you could turn American Pie in to a Best Picture.  The way the story is written really breaks out of the typical triller mold.
Best Set Design;  The use of colors in this picture is one word: FLAWLESS.  The Sav-Mart is remarkably constructed
Best Costume Designing;  The costumes went hand-in-hand with the great colors in the set.
Best Score;  The music is tense when it's needed, subtle when needed, but always fit for the scene.
Best Make-up; The only thing make-up related was Sy's hair, but it worked in with the puzzle that is his character.
Best Visual Effects;  Just like the make-up, there was only one effect related scene, the bleeding 'Red Eye' scene.  However, the effect didn't look hoax-y or fake.
There you go people. If you haven't seen this movie, run as fast you can to the closest theater playing this emotionally charged thiller.  But seeing as how it is limited release, it could be severeal miles to the closest theater playing it.",1032480000,,2150,4.670212765957447
1784823,5,B00006LA87,"This movie has got to be one of Robin Williams' best work ever!  He shows, with this movie, that he can play characters out of his normal comedic realm.
As you can tell by the title this is about a one hour photo counter in a Savemart store.  It is about Sy the photo guy, who is a middle aged man and very lonely.  Sy takes great pride in his work and knows all of his customers, their addresses, the  type of pictures they take, how many prints they want, the size of print, etc.  However, he is so lonely that over the years he has become obsessed with a family who has been developing their pictures with him for 9 years or so.  Sy, figures out something about this family (by putting 2 & 2 together), and becomes obsessively angry.  So much so that he sets out his plan to make someone pay (can't tell you what occured to make him snap as it hasn't been seen in the tv trailers yet so I can't spoil the movie).
Robin's performance is riveting and compelling.  There is enough suspense to keep you on the edge of your set.  However, this movie is quite disturbing in some ways and is not for everyone, especially children.  There are a several disturbing scenes but that is what makes the movie, along with Robin's unforgetable performance.

This movie is great... some might like it some might not, but I must say this is one of the best works that he has ever done.

1784828,5,B00006LA87,"This movie was wonderful. By far one of the best character developments I have ever seen in a movie. The entire movies goes in-depth to portray the psychology and sociology of the characters and the enviroment they are surrounded in. It actually mimics  the modern way of life we see every day. On one hand the industrious, wealthy family and *mart where you can purchase everything and the store. The other side is the cleanliness and stark existence our modern habits and technological roles have given us. I really would like Williams to recieve an Oscar out of this. More importantly I would like to see the entire movie get oscars as well; director, cinematgraphy, best actor and best script.
My last take is on the ending. Without trying to spoil the movie I will say REMEMBER this person is the stereotypical loner but do you really see any violence from and leading up to the end? I believe, unlike some critics, that the ending closely matched Williams personality in the movie and anything different would have belied the entire revealing process and results of his nature.

1784830,4,B00006LA87,"I enjoyed this movie thoroughly.  Even so,I subtracted a star from the otherwise perfect rating simply because something about the movie didn't work.  Not that the plot, style, characterizations and overall visual presentation of the film was not well constructed and in-sync.  It wasn't that... it was the audience.  We are just too well-primed to accept the strange as, well, almost acceptable.
In portraying Sy Parrish,Robin Williams takes his deranged writer role in 'Insomnia' up a notch.  At first, Sy seems the typically harmless guy with the best of intentions and one or two loose screws.  He's lonely: no friends, no family. His job seems to be all important to him,and he performs well but, in actuality the job is just a means to an end.  By perfectly processing the film rolls handed over to him at the local discount department store, Sy becomes a voyeur without ever leaving the confines of the world of his apartment and the store. In particular, he has zeroed in on the Yorkin family: Nina, Will and their young son.  To him,they have a model existence,one where Sy envisions himself as an involved ""uncle"", albeit to the extreme especially when he discovers that Will is having an affair with another photo client. Sy's loose screws drop out of his head as his picture of perfection is trampled and he devises a method of 'helping' the situation in a way that leaves the moviegoer's imagination stinging with bizarre possibilities that I will not disclose.
All this makes for an enthralling panorama of suburbian life that mesmerizes but nevertheless misses a beat somewhere in the process.  I think as 21st century film critics we have become just a little too anesthesized to strangeness as portrayed on the silver screen.  We have seen it all, haven't we?  Hannibal Lecter scared the daylights out of us with his slithering tongue and psychological slashing of Jodi Foster in 'The Silence of the Lambs', yet in 'Hannibal', a more gruesome act of eating Ray Liotta's still thinking brain had somewhat of a lesser impact. We have been 'privledged' to see multiple-personalities, child molestors, sexual deviants, serial killers and the all purpose cannibal---hey, we all love the Sopranos---so as creepy as Robin William's portrayal of Sy Parrish should be to our moral and ethical sensibilities, it is somehow diminished by our own sophistication as curried from the virtual world of films. Sy just doesn't provide the 'punch' needed to overthrow Hannibal from the current 'King Weirdo' throne. Visually, the director provides only a hint of what Sy's punishment for Will actually is---and this is the one moment of the film that lifts the hair off the back of the neck---ironically what WE DON""T SEE is more bizarre than what is shown in full technicolor.
Nonetheless,'One Hour Photo' is still a good film in spite of our jaded viewpoints. Connie Nielson ('Gladiator') is chic yet vulnerable as the suburban wife and mother and Michael Vartan ('Mists of Avalon')is sufficently sexy and thoroughly ashamed as the straying husband and father. While the sterile whiteness of the ubiquitously offensive suburban superstore and that of William's apartment in the film suggests Sy's toxic need for order in an otherwise unordered situation contrasts well with the picture perfect environs of the Yorkin family's phony Utopian dream.  Check it out--you'll only add to your library of the Bizarre.",1032048000,7,3410,5.0588235294117645
1784831,4,B00006LA87,"One critic wrote that ""One Hour Photo"" will ""Do for photo developing what 'Psycho' did for showers"". It is a creppy and somewhat demented film, with an amazing performance by Robin Williams, but is flawed by a script that falters towards the end of the movie.
Williams plays Sy Parrish, a photo developer at a Savmart (a department store similar to ...) who takes special pride in the prints he produces. To him, developing is an underappreciated art form. His life revolves around his job, and for good reason, he has no real life to speak of outside of his work. He was never married, has no real friends or relations, and we learn very little about his past. What we know of his present situation is bleak and depressing. But Sy has taken a special liking to a suburban family, with a successful husband, a pretty wife, and a beautiful son. Domestic bliss personified. He, in his lonely state, becomes obsessed with the family, and longs for something he can never have. This pushes him to the brink of near insanity.
I will not give away any more than I already have, but I will say that the ending lets down the whole movie. The movie begins as a fascinating character study, and ends as a hollywood cliche (a diet version, if you will). While the creppiness and the quality of the acting keeps ""One Hour Photo"" entertaining, you feel unsatasfied in the end. Similar to movies like ""Silence of the Lambs"" and ""Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer"", the characters are more interesting before the go over the edge.
The movie is the perfect starring vehicle for Williams, who is proving that his move from comedy to drama in his later years is indeed a good idea. The script, while meandering at times, is smartly written and doesn't turn the movie into a Hannibal-type affair. Williams is a lonely man who seeks love and attention, and only finds it out of his reality and in the photos he develops. He nailed the character perfectly.
While it's not Oscar material, it is definitely worth checking out. Most people will love Robin Williams's darker side, while others will like the unique story.",1032048000,3,2097,4.639784946236559

Rather than a film about a crazed, murderous stalker, Director Mark Romanek delivers a touching portrait of a lonely man looking for a place to fit in.
  Robin Williams is excellent as Sy ""The Photo Guy"" Parrish, who uses his job in the photo departmant of SavMart to accumulate pictures of the family he so desperately wishes to be a part of. When he discovers clues that all might not be sweetness and light with his fantasy family, Sy decides to take steps to correct things.
  I really didn't feel too much for the Yorkin family- Apart from the sympathetic young son, the parents aren't the nicest of people, and the secret they're hiding made me like them even less. (I did understand how Sy could be drawn to the lovely Mrs. Yorkin, played by the luminous Connie Nielson.) The ending is vastly different from what I was expecting, and that's always a plus.

I'm trying not to give out too much of the movie here, but what makes this movie so successful is an idea of an 1 hr photo clerk, which is so close to home for most of us.

His alter images of himself portraying a contributing member in the Yorkin clan are downright eerie, adding just such a touch of realism to make the average moviegoer appreciate life as it exists today. The average moviegoer does not care about substance . . . just a quick ruffling of feathers for a few dollars. Fans of intellectual independent film will adore the true-to-life realism with which Williams portrays Sy. The picture honestly touched me in a waay like never before. To see a man break down over the loss of his job, and realise that he is in a deeper state of sadness over his losses in the social side is a real tongue-in-cheek, lump-in-your-throat ride. Of course, Sy is a demented and deranged person . . . but he is characteristic of us all in some ways; the way we each latch onto something with a fervour and passion. This is as true to life in the depression sector as one can get, and yet, it is still a character study . . . one not entirely depressing, but having heart as well . . .",1031875200,5,1465,4.532075471698113

This film left the audience in awe.  No one left their seats when the credits started to roll.  It is mesmerizing, haunting and compelling.  What makes it such a creepy thriller is the fact that this flick is REAL!  It can, and probably is, the story of what is going on right in our own backyards.

The story revolves around Sy, the photo processing clerk (played remarkably by Robin Williams), who leads a very dull. Eventually, he alienates himself and starts imagining himself as a member of the Yorkin family, a seemingly perfect family, who have brought their photos to him over the years. He has developed their photos over the years and knows everything about them. Sy uses them as a escape from his dull life and appoints himself as Uncle Sy, a caring loving member of the family. However, when something goes wrong in the family that Sy finds out about, he goes about his way to see that the person is punished.
Robin Williams characterization of ""Sy, the Photo Guy"" is brilliant; a chilling, eerie, humanizing and many-layered portrait of a deeply disturbed individual. Although, it gives a negative effect for Sy, you can't help but feel sorry for him, as he is not a bad person in any way, but because of his significant psychopathology, he looks at things a different way.

Williams plays ""Sy the Photo Guy"" at a discount store  Sav-Mart which, for all of us in America is all too familiar.  Sy takes absolute care and pride in his work, to the point of obsession (the altercation with the photo processing technician gives you your first peak at just how seriously Sy takes his work).  Sy becomes obsessed over one family in particular and dreams of becoming part of the family as ""Unlce Sy"".  Seemingly harmless on the surface, you find  that as the film progresses Sy may not be as harmless as one would think.
In the opening sequence, Sy narrates a tale of his customers from the new parent with the endless rolls of film, to the amatuer pornographer, which at this point you start to think, ""should I be taking all of my film to the same place to be developed?""
Mark Romanek's theatrical debut as a director is stunnng.  The camera work is exceptional, from the enormous glaring halogen staleness of the Sav-Mart, to the drab environment in which Sy lives in at home, to the warm inviting coloration of the family to which he has become, in his own mind, an important figure in.  The set design, costumes and overall look and feel of this film is realistic, and yet has moments where the glaring sterility of everyday life for  a middle aged single male practically smacks you in the face.
Some people may find the film a tad slow, but every single frame of this is neccessary in order to fully develop the feeling, mood and the characters themselves.
In particular, the ending is something that you absoluetly do not expect, but give yourself a couple of moments to think and it will become very clear as to what the motivation of the characters, screenwriter and director was.
I admit this film is not for everyone, but if  you find that you are searching for a film with a bit more depth and are willing to think your way through this, it is well worth the effort and money.",1031356800,8,2196,4.52020202020202
1784842,5,B00006LA87,"When Robin Williams utters that line, the whole audience burst into laughter. And why is that? Because there he is in his car, peering through his camera lens at an unsuspecting family--he's a stalker!
Got to admit, I was hesitant to see ""One Hour Photo"" at the local theatre because the coming attractions made it seem quite violent. There are scenes of violence eventually, but by far most of the film is very self-contained. This is appropriate because it deals with an isolated man, Williams, who works at a one hour photo lab in a shopping mall. We see his constricted world and his lonely existence; seems sad but not all that unusual. But then there's a pullback and we see that the entire wall of his apartment is covered with extra sets of photos he has made of his favorite family, the Yorkins. He's become obsessed with them and their seemingly idyllic life, and he's about to go over the edge.
What finally pushes him over? The discovery of trouble in Yorkin paradise, an adulterous affair. When he sees the photographic evidence of that, he is so outraged that he figures he has to take matters into his own hands, even if he has to balance a chef's knife with his camera in those hands.
Kudos to Williams for a remarkable chameleon-like disappearance into the character of Sy the Photo Guy. He looks years older, and acts in a surprisingly understated fashion. But since we all really know that he is larger than life, we always feel that there's going to be an explosion of energy at some point, and  we're not disappointed. Oscar should remember him next year.
Take care where you send your photos to be developed next time!",1031270400,,1640,4.616438356164384
1784843,5,B00006LA87,"Sy is the photo guy at the local Savmart.  He has been processing the Yorkin's family pictures for at least 10 years.  He's watched as their little boy grew up.  He's watched as they experienced all of their happiest memories.  Sy is lonely.  He has no family, no friends.  No one to care for, and no one who cares for him.  To him, the Yorkin's are his family.  He gets presents for little Jake.  But, there's another part of Sy's life that not many people know about.  A secret life.  An obssessive, fantasy life.  He fancy's himself as ""Uncle Sy"".  He gets little Jake Yorkin presents for his birthday.  He imagines himself in the Yorkin house, drinking a beer and watching the game on their television.  Even celebrating Christmas with them.  The Yorkin's, to him, are the ideal family.  He finds comfort in imagining that he is a part of this perfect family.  When blemishes begin to appear Sy's picture of what the Yorkin's are, though, is when things start going bad.
This is Robin Williams best performance.  I'm sure you've read many reviews that say the same thing.  Nothing you've read will prepare you for how frighteningly brilliant Williams is.  He delivers what is easily the best performance of the year.  I realize the Academy, in it's infinite wisdom, will never give him the award he deserves, but he will at least garner a Best Actor nomination.  Mark Romanek also proves himself as a directer.  His shots, though occasionally bordering on cliche, are for the most part expertly set up.  One particular shot that comes to mind is perhaps a nod to David Fincher.  Sy is taking pictures, and the camera zooms into Sy's camera lens, then continues to zoom until it is like you are taking a journey past the lens and shutter and into the camera itself.
It also bears mentioning that the music in One Hour Photo is taken (at least partially) from Requiem for a Dream's musical score.  I noticed this because I recently saw Requiem for a Dream, and thought that the music in particular was brilliant.  Apparently, directer Mark Romanek felt the same way.
This is a film that will creep you out.  You will find yourself thinking about it long after you leave the theater.  It's one of those movies that has to be rewatched, in the same way that Taxi Driver must be rewatched many times, to fully appreciate all aspects of it.  This movie will not let you down, but will instead surpass your expectations.  A picture never lies.",1031097600,,2440,4.615384615384615

Gary Cole (Hop, The Brady Bunch The Movie) has a great performance in this one. I love the intense story about Sy The Photo Guy follows and obsessively keeps a copies family photos from another family. Then he founds out the father is having an affair with someone he sees her in a family photo. Follows the father and the mistress. Gives them something you don't wanna miss.
