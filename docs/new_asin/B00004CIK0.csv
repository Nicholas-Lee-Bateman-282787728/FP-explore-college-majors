1339046,2,B00004CIK0,"I like iconoclastic risktaking filmmaking as much as the next guy.  That said I didn't cozy to ""The Coca-Cola Kid"".  It seems like it tried too hard to be offbeat, selfconsiously so, that it never really caught fire.  Definitely a case of an askewed sensibility over any real substance.  It doesn't help matters that Eric Roberts' character, a whiz kid from the head office in Atlanta, grates on you.  I've liked Roberts in other endeavors(see ""Runaway Train"") but he doesn't seem to get a handle on this one.  One of the film's few redeeming qualities is the turn by Greta Scacchi as a wily secretary for Coke's Aussie headquarters.  She is sexy, coquettish, and hilarious in turns.  Alas, she can't make us believe that she's head-over-heels for Roberts' character.  Another reason for pause is a scene where Scacchi showers nude with her on-screen daughter.  Some may find this sensual I thought it exploitative and redundant.  Regardless, this one is a definite misfire.",1351728000,2,974,4.950617283950617

1339049,3,B00004CIK0,"The only thing I noted about this lightweight frothy film was that the American used profanity & none of the Australians did. Otherwise when all was said & done I found absolutely nothing of interest. The character Eric Roberts played representing the US showed nothing worthwhile  & verified my opinion that Coca Cola is one of those American products that are entirely unessential & the world can very well do without.

Likewise this film is unessential among a myriad of other unessential American films & I recomment viewers do not waste their time looking at it.",1323216000,,567,4.895833333333333

I had to force myself to finish watching this film and was very disappointed with pretty much every aspect of it.  The leading lady, Greta Scacchi, plays a likable quirky character that I was able to get behind, but I could not get past how much I disliked Becker (Eric Roberts' character).

To bad Coca-Cola never made use of the jingle in the movie. If you don't fall in love with Greta Scacchi your heart is made of stone!",1168819200,2,295,4.016949152542373
1339068,4,B00004CIK0,"My initial statement read as follows: 'I'm not making any comments about this film, as it's a long time since I last saw it, but I do want to register my objection to Mr Tamm's calling ""Smash Palace"" an Australian film.  It was a New Zealand film, made in New Zealand, by a New Zealand director (Roger Donaldson), about New Zealand characters and starring mainly New Zealand actors (Bruno Lawrence, Greer Robson, Keith Aberdeen).  It has no connection whatsoever with Australia.  This is almost as bad as when Peter Jackson's third ""Lord of the Rings"" movie won all 11 academy Awards for which it was nominated, and after Billy Crystal had been making jokes all night about everyone in New Zealand having been thanked in the various acceptance speeches, the following morning a prominent US newspaper referred to Peter Jackson as ""an Australian director""! We are NOT Australians!!!!'

Having watched the film to which this review is attached since making the above statement, I should probably provide at least a brief review of the actual film, so here goes:

""The Coca-Cola Kid"" is an entertaining comedy about a young American who heads to Australia on behalf of the Coca-Cola company to find out why the company's products are not doing well in a particular area of that country.  It turns out that a small independent soft-drink company controls the market in that area.  The ""Kid"" has to try and get the old guy who runs the company to sell out to Coca-Cola.  He finds it a rough ride but along the way he learns a lot about himself and even discovers romance in the form of a single mother, played by Greta Scacchi.  The movie is entertaining on a variety of levels, as entertainment, as social commentary, etc., but for me, what makes it really worthwhile is Greta Scacchi's shower scene.",1152403200,2,1796,4.7491961414791
1339069,5,B00004CIK0,"First of all,

I highly recommend the review below, by the guy named ""Sideburns."" I think he captures the factual basis and spirit for this film. I can understand how some who are ""Australia-philes"" might want to see a purely Aussie product, and this is not that. It's not ""Smash Palace"" or many other fine Aussie films of that genre. What this film is, can be described in one word: WEIRD.

That's a good thing.

The genius of Eric Roberts used to be (and may still be again), his ability to seemingly lose himself in his roles, and do so while lacking any self-consciousness about how he comes across. To see this film and then see other excellent (and weird) films, including ""The Pope of Greenwich Village"" and ""Runaway Train,"" is to see a career arc that was pretty amazing. He seemed to get into serious films with major talent around him, and then be able to carry-off demanding roles (albeit, some similar, sure), with energy and command.

Okay, onto this film. First of all, let's be honest, this is not a deep film. It's not meant to be. It is almost like an indie verson of a Farrely brothers film, at least their early ones, where they don't mind taking risks and also having fun. There's also a nice romantic subtext they had (""Kingpin"" - believe it or not, ""Me, Myself & Irene"") where, in a ridiculous way, they reflect what's in a good majority of people who are either searching for love, or just searching for something in themselves, and they find it reflected or - in the case of the main characters in the Farrely films, and definitely in ""Coca Cola Kid,"" abbetted by others. I'm not saying Woody Harrelson or Jim Carrey could've been the Coca Cola Kid, but what they all have in common, in the specific roles they played in these films, is to make one wonder if anyone would or could find anything remotely interesting about them in a romantic way. They are so completely un-indearing, it seems almost cartoonish - and then one just thinks of many people we all know, and it's not that unbelieavable.

The music in the film alone is just fantastic. The Coca Cola jingle Robert's character commissions is incredible, and it's punctuated by this aboriginal guy who is playing his device - a guy Roberts finds outside the Coca Cola local offices, and promptly drafts into service. It's just really funny to see The Kid's mind work - marketing wheels a'spinnin' as he devises and employs his strategies. Everyone on both sides is equally mocked, and that makes for a really fine, mostly non-judgemental film (rare these days, eh?).

There are other nice touches in the soundtrack and

also, I'd be remiss, not to mention NUTS, if I avoided the very nice scene of Greta Scaatchi where she's freshening up...well, go see the film!

It's quirky, it's revealing, and a lot of fun. It also does a great job of discussing culture clashes, where, when everyone is harmless, you can see how progress comes out of a some dissension, yet still wonder if we're losing a little something in the translation. If that's vague, so's the film in some ways, and I think that is precisely what the director was going for. It doesn't all have to fit perfectly. A lot doesn't, and that makes it kind of seem real.",1130803200,12,3210,4.5898778359511345
1339070,3,B00004CIK0,"This movie did not replay quite as well as I'd hoped after viewing when it first came out on tape to now.  But it still holds some very entertaining moments and Eric Roberts proves that he really is a terrific actor.  The director, who also made Sweet Movie, has a bizarre sense of humor, in this case you must make to the very end to find the twist.",1129593600,,350,4.132352941176471

1339072,5,B00004CIK0,"I was fortunate enough to view this movie before trying to expand my business into Australia.  It helped me avoid a number of mistakes.  I realize it wasn't meant to be a training film, but it sure worked for me.  Now, if only, I could find that distinctly Australian sound!",1060300800,,274,4.44
1339073,4,B00004CIK0,"I have been an Australophile forever; if there was one decade that really brought Australia's best side for the rest of the world to see, it had to be the 1980's; the pop music from Down Under during that time was among the best in the world, and the movies from Australia have a wonderful sense of the country that make them far more representative of itself than other movies from other countries...you see an Australian movie and you just KNOW: ""That's Australia"".
>
It may be hard to believe now, but there was once a time when Eric Roberts was much better-known than his sister Julia; this time parallels the time in Eric's career when he actually made good movies, like this one, f'rinstance.
>
This movie is very enjoyable in its quirkiness...Eric Roberts is terrific as an ex-United States Marine Corps, Southern-fried Gordon Gecko (Roberts, like his sister Julia, is from Smyrna, GA, so he does come by the accent naturally) who eats, sleeps, and breathes Coca-Cola and is sent by the Corporate hotshots to find out why in one remote corner of the Australian outback (redundancy, anyone?) no Coca-Cola is sold. The reason, it turns out, is the local Cola Baron (played by Australian cinema standard Bill Kerr...check him out in another great Aussie flick, ""Gallipoli"") who produces terrific cola virtually by hand and with it has won an almost cult-like devotion by the locals.
>
Greta Scacchi (who really does look like Susan Sarandon's kid sister in this movie) is the somewhat dizzy secretary with an on-again, off-again ex-husband and a beautiful wee daughter (who calls herself ""DMZ"", as in neutral territory where her parents can't fight) who starts attempting to seduce Roberts from his first day in Austalia. She may or may not have a motive to her madness, and it can at times be painful watching her attempts, but this is an enjoyable movie for someone who may not necessarily enjoy romantic comedies per se; and as a native Atlantan, I particularly enjoyed Roberts' monologue on the virtues of his product (""...the SOUND...of COKE"")...made me want to pop one open on the spot.
>
And I PROMISE you will NOT be able to get that Tim Finn (former Split Enz, technically New Zealanders, but who's counting) Coca-Cola jingle out of your head after watching this!",1030060800,26,2276,4.823529411764706
1339074,4,B00004CIK0,"I watched this movie when I was on my Greta Scacchi binge. It fared well against the others considering they included Jefferson in Paris and The Red Violin. It is like others have said, pleasingly wacky.
Eric Roberts is one of those actors I love to hate (along with Banderas and Gere) because of his gratingly arrogant manner. But he grew on me (like a wart) in this movie, as the sold-out Coca-Cola marketing man with a mission Down Under. It was funny seeing the disclaimer at the beginning of the movie that this does not represent Coke's actual tactics.
Scacchi is appealing as the pretty but inept secretary who throws herself at Roberts and has a secret related to the cola wars. Smalltown Australia is depicted in much the manner I have come to expect, with a bunch of oddball characters thrown in.",1029456000,7,806,4.604166666666667
1339075,5,B00004CIK0,"I originally viewed this movie in the 80s and had positive feelings about the story and the cast. When the DVD release became available I purchased and viewed it again. I enjoyed it even more. This is the story of a coca-cola trouble shooter and an independent pop producer in Australia and the Coca-cola man's (Kid)effort to have coca-cola expand into the market area of the independent brand. Doen't sound funny but it is. It is funny and although there is nudity and sexual content,it is a gentle and sweet movie with abundant humor.",1025395200,5,536,4.712765957446808
1339076,4,B00004CIK0,"The Coca-Cola Kid gets by on it's off-beat charm of which it is loaded with. Eric Roberts is Perfect as Becker the hotshot trouble shooter who comes to bring coca-cola to the outback. Along the way he becomes a better person as he encounters a local soft drink makerwho refuses to be pushed aside by the American giant.  Greta Scacci plays Beckers love interest who has a few secrets of her own. Yes it is compareable to ""Local Hero"" but is original enough to stand on it's own. One of Roberts better performances.",1020643200,7,514,4.526881720430108
1339077,4,B00004CIK0,"Not one of Makavejev's best, and fans probably shun it as a ""commercial job,"" but it's charming in the same vein that Bill Forsyth's 80s comedies were. Come to think of it, COCA-COLA KID was probably geared to cash in on the success of GREGORY'S GIRL and LOCAL HERO.
Still, the story about a big city, American ""corporate troubleshooter"" raising capitalistic hell with some wacky Aussie has its moments. Eric Roberts is superb as a lean, clean, ex-Marine, preaching and drawlin' his way through an office wasteland in search of trouble to root out and resolve. He runs amuck of skeptical executives, a ultra-cute divorcee with an instant crush, her cute as a button daughter, an old-fashioned, rural soda pop maker, and a subversive hotel bell hop who's convinced he's a CIA operative. Result: nothing like the Atlanta executives intended in sending their ""miracle worker"" down under.
The plotline seems to sputter out as the story digs in; that is, when the action and dialog are fast and furious, the film's utterly charming. (The DVD is worth its price for Roberts' near-religious presentation on the worldwide appeal of Coca-Cola.) But when it all has to slow down to bring the story up to date, the sparkle dims. Still, Roberts and Greta Scacchi (as the smitten secretary) are great. Watch for Tim Finn doing a costar turn as well as composing some of the soundtrack.",1013644800,9,1372,4.867521367521367
1339078,5,B00004CIK0,"I walked into this movie on a suggestion from my father. I was skeptical. A movie bout Coca Cola? With Eric Roberts? I thought he was dead.
The movie begans in Atlanta, Georgia, which is the headquarters of the world's most popular carbonated drink company. The big-dogs of Coke began to look over their sales charts and they realize there is one particular part of Autralia where there product isn't selling.
So, they send out their best sales-man and persuader, of whom the movie is titled after.
Suffice to say that the plot becomes more complicated once he arrives in a very small town in the Outback. There is some surprisingly excellent music, and Eric Robert gives a very good preformance, feigning an Atlanta accent amazingly well. It is a funny movie, and has a very large 80's feel to it. (Take a look at 'Local Hero' and 'The Gods Must Be Crazy' - they both have the same feel.)
For these reasons, I give this movie five stars and would suggest it, as my father did to me, to anyone who likes a laugh.",1003190400,6,1012,4.475675675675675

7919844,4,B00004CIK0,"This is one movie I missed during the 80s, and my first impression was that this was almost a parody of all the 80's Aussie movies that were spearheaded by Crocodile Dundee, except, of course, that it wasn't. To be honest, I have a problem with comedy movies. Most of them aren't just that funny. This one isn't sidesplittingly hilarious, but it is a lot of fun and borders on outright zany without crossing into stupidity, the way a lot of comedies do. The movie deals with a young American ex-marine who now works as a troubleshooter for Coca Cola, and come to Australia to help boost Coke's sales down under. He encounters an odd assortment of kooky characters, including the estranged daughter of Coke's main competitor in a portion of Australia, who, even though she sees the Coke executive as a possible love interest, attempts to get the goods on him by manuevering him into a gay party with a photographer waiting in the wings, her ex-husband, who makes his own vodka out of wood chips and is definitely a Crocodile Dundee parody, a hotel employee who thinks he is a CIA agent, and the like. And herein is the only real problem with the movie - it's based on a set of short stories, and thus the screenplay can get a little disjointed at times, when one screwball character and a subplot is inexcplicably grafted onto the main storyline. This was as Australian movie - I doubt it could have been made in America and kept the references to Coca Cola. It's a cute movie, and I smiled most of the way through it. It's worth watching if you missed it back when it was new.",1466467200,2,1576,4.475694444444445
