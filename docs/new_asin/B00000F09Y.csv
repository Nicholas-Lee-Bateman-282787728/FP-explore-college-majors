7906001,2,B00000F09Y,Didn't mention IS2. Said the M26 took a huge toll of German armor. Balderdash. If you want to spend alot of time looking at early British junk this is your documentary. Two stars is generous,1473811200,,190,4.457142857142857

7906004,5,B00000F09Y,"THis is the type of comprehensive video WWII buffs like me can view in detail every few years.

Too much attention is often paid to German armor. The allies used armor well, even if they did not have the biggest tanks. The story is here. I highly recommend it.",1274572800,2,260,4.3061224489795915
7906005,5,B00000F09Y,"This DVD provides a comprehensive overview of allied armored vehicles of World War II, while still offering a good level of detail on each. The DVD format is that of good quality period film footage of each subject vehicle, sometimes what looks like film created for original military consideration/review while other times it looks like the standard newsreel or combat film footage we're all used to finding on these DVD's. While the film footage plays on an unseen narrator provides the info, stats, and regular commentary on what the film is currently showing. The video starts off with a brief history of the use of tanks in warfare and then goes on to cover the differing philosophies with tank design and tactics and then moves right on to progress through the various Allied armored vehicle designs used throughout the war. This DVD was sort of a sleeper hit for me since it appears to be fairly new and it had no reviews to speak of. It wasn't recommended to me beforehand as many of these videos are, and there wasn't a big library of titles associated with it. But it is absolutely a hit with me and I would highly recommend it to any military history buff or someone interested in scale military modelling, etc. The film footage is of a much better than average quality and the vast majority of it is stuff you shouldn't have seen before. So if you are interested in the subject and are thinking about giving this title a shot I would say absolutely go for it! You will not be sorry and at the price Amazon asks for this DVD the value just can not be beat.",1191628800,5,1567,4.52112676056338
7906006,3,B00000F09Y,"This covers most allied armor in minute detail. You will see footage of all of the different models with brief descriptions of their speed armament armor etc in a cronological order.
What is realy missing is a comparasion of the allied armor with that of the axis and how they fared in battle their strengths and weakness overall it is ok if you are a real history buff.",1069718400,2,370,4.455882352941177
