8167942,3,B0002D68WE,"Produced in 1997 early IDPA was just getting started. I recognize some of the names still active shooters. The production was good but did lack a little. I'm sure it is expensive to produce anything.
As the name suggest it is IDPA only with rules and structure of the organization.
It points out the differences in IDPA and other organizations who have gotten away from the basics. IDPA teaches basics in gun shooting, carry & concealment with the average person in mind who is just interested in personal self defense using the least equipment,nothing fancy.
What it does not teach is shooting techniques, stance, concealment, cover, grip, trigger control or drawing. There are other great teachers for that, try Personal Defense TV, or Shooting USA DVD's.
