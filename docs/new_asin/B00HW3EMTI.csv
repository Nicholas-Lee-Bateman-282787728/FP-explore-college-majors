6230395,5,B00HW3EMTI,Can't wait to order volume 4.,1424649600,,29,4.0
6230396,4,B00HW3EMTI,"This is still a fun show with a fantastic ensemble cast. The scripts are good and the one weakness (the go no-where relationship between Sheen and Blair) is cleverly dispensed with, creating a wonderful story arc.
  There is still the great ensemble in Goodson's prison group. The writers utilize this.
  If there's a potential danger for the future it is (again) Sheen's genitals. His promiscuity is, at first, beautifully tied into the departure of Selma Blair, but some catalyst (or train wreck) is needed to avoid turning Charley Goodson into Charlie Harper. I hope this comes at the start of season 4.
  Some wonderful moments occur utilizing the gifts of Barry Corbin who's been paired with Martin Sheen.  Shawnee Smith is remarkable, consistently. Her crisp ""T's"" (noticeable in ""Becker"") suit her well. She manages some of the finest moments in this season between business ventures, boyfriends and being a good mother. One of her most beautiful scenes is with a goat named Stella who belongs to a boyfriend named Canvas.
  Namaste.",1424476800,3,1040,5.035087719298246

6230399,3,B00HW3EMTI,"Charlie Goodman is No Charlie Harper. Charlie Sheen's performance on Anger Management seems like he's only giving half of his Comedic performance as in 2 and a Half Men.

Selma Blair was not the only member of the shows cast and crew that was frustrated by Sheens work habits as I hear they would often sit and wait for hours for him to show up for work. Although it was Blair voicing her concerns that got Sheen to flip out and get her fired by text.
What Charlie Sheen wants, he gets. After mounting a campaign to get his co-star on the FX comedy series Selma Blair fired over alleged comments questioning his work ethic, its mission accomplished for Sheen, who reportedly threatened to quit the show if Blair stayed. Anger Management producer Lionsgate just issued a statement, making Blairs dismissal from the show official. We are confirming that Selma Blair will not be returning to Anger Management, and we wish her the very best.
I really miss Selma's Blair's character fellow therapist Dr. Kate Wales. Please bring back Selma Blair!",1420156800,5,1041,4.751381215469613
