2313295,5,B0009QYGM8,"PageCraft has done it again.  I have been waiting for this DVD since I saw the preview on Tim Holtz's Altered Journey DVD.  I never thought I'd be the paper marbling type, until I saw this.  Now I know I can do, will do it, and will create wonderful papers.  This is a must have for anyone who uses handmade papers, or wants the look of handmade papers, in their scrapbooking, stamping, bookmaking, etc.

You'll love it.",1120003200,7,420,4.402597402597403
2313296,5,B0009QYGM8,"If you have always wanted to know HOW those fancy endpapers in books are made, this DVD not only shows you, but teaches you to make your own!  No talking heads here; lots of hands-on views and step-by-steps.  I've taken marbling classes and I paid twice as much as this DVD to learn half as much information as was packed into this set of lessons.

The interactive gallery is great: you click on the icon and it takes you to the section where you learn how to make it.  Peggy talks about design while she shows you steps; she expands on materials and safety issues during the gallery and even when the credits are rolling you get to see her personal art journal!

Just so much bang for your buck it is unbelievable!",1120003200,14,715,4.345864661654136

8065418,4,B0009QYGM8,"Peggy takes you through the complete process of marbling in a way that is easy to understand and follow.  As a beginner she left me with the surety that I can do this! The only trouble was the disc.  Mine came with a couple of scratches on it and the ""back"" did not take me back when I wanted to review something I had already listened to in a previous chapter. I am kind of grumbly about this as when I am learning something  I'll go back and forth often.",1379203200,,456,4.044444444444444
8065419,5,B0009QYGM8,"Peggy is an American Treasure. She shares with you the basics and the details.
You will gain insights that would take you years to learn on your own. That is why some used copies of this DVD sell for 200.00
Please wait AS i KNOW THEY ARE PRODUCING SOME MORE.Peggy is also looking at a kindle guide to Marbling in Manual form which I hope she does.
 How to make paints alone is worth the price of this DVD which I didntcheck  time but must be over 1 1/2 hours long. She explains how to use concentrated pigments to get the brighter colors Marblers are looking for .This is a must have .

8065420,5,B0009QYGM8,"Explaining marbling is difficult enough.  But, explaining marbling and making the tools in particular in this excellent video is definitely a tour de force.  Bravo, well done. Is sitting on my shelf within reach for help when needed. It is great even for an experienced marbler.",1234915200,5,278,5.021739130434782
8065421,5,B0009QYGM8,"MASTERING MARBLING video by Peggy Skycraft is very excellent! It is concise, and Peggy gives very clear instructions. It is enhancing my learning experience quickly! The only problem I have is with the sound. I tried it on two different DVD players and the same thing - I cannot get it to a louder volume. Thank goodness! I can hear it well enough, though, but you need to be closer to the screen than normal. I do highly recommend this DVD for learning the age-old craft of marbling.",1200700800,5,484,4.511363636363637

The magic of creating these papers takes place in front of your eyes.",1120521600,8,260,4.608695652173913
