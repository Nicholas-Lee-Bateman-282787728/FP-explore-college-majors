8707123,5,B00UJQCPF8,If I could have every  DVD made from the movies of 1939  indeed It would be a thrill. My love for old movies is endless. This 1939 collection is great. This will not be my last  order of movies from that genre if an offer is available. Having a collection of movies is a passion.,1448582400,,279,4.036363636363636
8707124,5,B00UJQCPF8,Good Value for 1939 classic movies but how many times will Gone With The Wind be reissued?,1444608000,,90,4.352941176470588
8707125,4,B00UJQCPF8,"I was very happy with this collection ,it arrived on time, the price was good considering what you would pay at a retail store. blu ray upgrade was excellent .but why include 'gwtw'when just about everybody already owns a copy...there were so many classic films from that golden year that should have been considered,,,kind of a rip off I think  ,yes, an I was the dope that bought the collection anyway...",1440806400,3,406,4.71830985915493

8707128,5,B00UJQCPF8,If you don't already have most of these (I have all but one) these are all great films.  My copies are not all on Blu-ray but yes 1939 was THE year they didn't even pick half of the really great  ones.  Now a copy of 20 of the movies of that year would be something.  Then again in my case I still have most of them. Otherwise I wouldn't hesitate to buy this collection,1436400000,2,369,3.945945945945946
8707129,5,B00UJQCPF8,"A great collection for those of us who don't already have Gone With The Wind. So many great films from 1939, why limit it to five?. I would be tempted but I already have 2 copies of GWTW",1429056000,7,186,3.9210526315789473
