8075472,2,B000A7DVV8,"Being a fan of old black and white movies, I was really looking forward to ""Haunted House"". Well, I'm not really sure why they even called it that because you never actually get to the house until the movie is almost over. Then the house is nothing more that a single room with a fireplace. There are much better movies that actually have a haunted or scary house in them. I did like the movie for the main 2 young actors. Everyone did a good job for what they had to work with. I have not watched ""Snow Creature"" yet.",1140998400,,518,4.19
