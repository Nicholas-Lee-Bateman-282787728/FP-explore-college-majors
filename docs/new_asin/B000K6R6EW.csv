2683145,5,B000K6R6EW,"WOW!  Having been born with two left feet I was thrilled to find ""Swing Dancing for Beginners""!  Shawn and Joanna break the dance down into easy steps that ANYONE can easily understand and perform.  The way this video is filmed is unique and makes it simple to follow their lead.  After years of wanting to be able to dance, my husband and I have finally found a teaching method that works!  I can't wait to try Volume 2.",1165276800,15,421,4.346153846153846

2683147,5,B000K6R6EW,"This DVD is all you need to learn the basic swing steps, fast swing as well as slow swing depending on the music being played. The instruction technics were simple to learn and easy to remember. As an example, using the Hula Hoop as an aid to demonstrate the swing move is superb and is imprinted in the viewer's mind. I strongly recommend it to beginners.",1165017600,18,356,4.409090909090909

2683149,5,B000K6R6EW,"I recently purchased all three of the Swing Dancing DVD's despite already being a regular (once a month) swing dancer, but wanting to have a better idea of what I was supposed to be doing on the floor.

This DVD starts with the basic footwork and leads into using the arms and the different turns. This much isn't even covered in the free 1 hour lesson before each swing dance at my local dance place.

Also, I enjoy this much more as I can learn at my own pace and not risk the embarassment of feeling like a total newbie in front of people I'd potentially like to dance with.

With this DVD, I can use it as a refresher for myself or friends before we go out so we can spend more time on the real priority. (what to wear!)",1163980800,14,724,4.120567375886525

It is understood that where to step, who leads, etc. is as important as keeping the rhythm.  This video will let you feel comfortable on the dance floor and let you advance at your own pace.  As it is with learning anything, you cannot just watch the video.  You have to get up and try it and hopefully one of your two left feet will become a right one.",1419206400,,443,4.1647058823529415

2683154,3,B000K6R6EW,"Good instruction, but it repeats the same stuff over and over.

2683155,3,B000K6R6EW,"Purchased both volumes 1 and 2 at the same time.  While the cover several moves, I would recommend ""How to become a good Dancer"" series by Emilo and Blanche Libero instead.

2683156,5,B000K6R6EW,"Super easy and basic video for brand new ballroom dance students, and the music is suitable for practice, with or without a partner. If you are already a ballroom dancer, then this will probably bore you, and you should try one of their more advanced videos. I like how they stress that the basic footwork is the foundation of dancing, and they make it very clear that you need to have good understanding of this, before you move on to attempt turns and tricks. They show both regular step timing and triple step, but you need only learn the easiest pattern to start. If you have been afraid to try ballroom dancing, this video is really user friendly. The second volume 2 shows more moves, and you should consider buying both at the same time, since any dance lessons will likely include all of this.",1388966400,,801,4.531034482758621

2683158,2,B000K6R6EW,"The instructions are good but really too much.  They dwelve into nuances that seem more appropriate for advanced styling or in an actual class and less on the moves.

If it weren't for the long instructions, this would have been more of a 5 star category.  Several times we wanted to review the steps and its hard to find the actual instructions for the moves as one fast forwards through the styling nuances.

This is a DVD instruction and not an actual class so the format should accomodate that.  If one wants to review a nuance or 2, one can easily rewind.

Raul and Tenias salsa instructions (also purchased on Amazon) are the best dance instructions so far;  They go straight into the moves and as you get more comfortable with the moves, you can focus on styling.",1374451200,,770,4.536231884057971
2683159,3,B000K6R6EW,"This DVD is 75 minutes long and it takes over 45 minutes to get to a the Man and Lady dancing the Swing Basic Step in a closed (and open hand hold) position.  Much air time is devoted to counting and leading (and following).  If you want to learn some basic swing steps, this DVD is just as good as -- but no better than -- the Vicki Regan DVD on Swing.  Indeed Shawn mostly demonstrates his Swing Basic steps using the single beat Shuffle Steps (while Vicki shows only the Triple-Step version of the Basic Swing).  That said, I should mention that my father (recipient of all of these instructional dance DVDs) really likes the Shawn Trautman series. I would go right to the Slow Dancers' refresher steps DVDs, but some people need to count out the beat and be reminded how the Man gives leads to the Lady in dancing with a partner.",1360627200,,833,4.354838709677419

2683163,2,B000K6R6EW,"The visual quality of the video was quite poor. It was as though the video had been copied so many times that it got very grainny. Also, the split screen effects were poor and distracting.  The instruction was fair and boring at times.",1344643200,,235,4.465116279069767
2683164,5,B000K6R6EW,"The hardest part of anything is usually getting started.  But Shawn Trautman makes beginning Swing easy.  This volume has all the hallmarks of good instruction - clear directions, demonstration, opportunities to practice the basics before moving on to the more complicated, and a lot of encouragement.  I've gotten more from this video than from hours of private instruction, and feel ready to move to the next level.",1340668800,,417,5.1940298507462686
2683165,3,B000K6R6EW,"Well, I thought I was a beginner, but this is extremely basic!
It would be great for anyone who has never danced the Swing, especially if they have two left feet.
If you know the basic step\step\rock-step, triple-step, one underarm turn, and how to hold each other, than you have pretty much mastered this video.
The ""and more..."" promised on the cover must refer to music and pep talks, because that is it on the dance steps!

The instructors are very pleasant, but they covered the basic material in about a third of the video and then spent the rest reinforcing it.
A learner could just replay the base material as needed; while the instructors might have covered more dance moves in remaining time.
Not that the basics are compacted to the first part of the actual video, they drag out every bit of instruction and repeat each step many times.",1328313600,,847,4.6092715231788075
2683166,5,B000K6R6EW,"The Swing Dancing DVD was my first Shawn Trautman DVD. I had never danced before and I picked up the Swing right away.  Shawn teaches the leader's part; his wife Joanna teaches the followers part.  The pace of the lesson is perfect.  By the end of the DVD, you will be Swing dancing.  I had no partner when I started, so I did the DVD alone.  When I got to the dance floor with a partner, I was able to follow!  Great value...much cheaper than lessons!",1325462400,2,452,4.1976744186046515
2683167,5,B000K6R6EW,"My husband and I were so thrilled when we purchased this DVD.  After a few lessons and other DVDs we had learned some dance steps but had not learned lead follow or the very basics for swing dancing which we have found to be very important for our dancing.  We thank Shawn for helping us.  His lessons were easy for us to follow.

We have also purchased Shawn's Swing Dancing for Beginners Volume 2 and
Intermediate Volume l.  Shawn and Joanna's teaching is equally good on these DVDs.",1323993600,,485,4.465909090909091

The content was good. However, they spent 1.25 hrs. going over what should have taken 0.5 hrs. In that time, they didn't even get to an inside turn!

This is not a 5-star product - Shawn T. must have 23 close friends.",1322784000,2,342,4.230769230769231
2683169,5,B000K6R6EW,My wife and I recently purchased this video.  We found it very instructional for beginners and very easy to follow.  The one thing we liked about it was it didn't just teach the dance steps.  It also emphasized the proper frame needed to dance properly and provided many little tips that made learning the dance that much easier.  We were very pleased with Shawn's approach to dance instruction.,1320883200,,395,4.764705882352941
2683170,4,B000K6R6EW,"this is very west coast swing. this is good to look over because it gives you basics. to be honest i love east coast a lot more. i am new to swing but not to dance. if west coast swing is what you want this will help u get started. they are professional and knowledgable. i didn't know the difference when i purchased this. look up balboa and you will see what i mean about east coast. just a start. they would do well in teaching footwork, they are good teachers.",1315785600,,464,4.1098901098901095
2683171,5,B000K6R6EW,"At the age of 28 I had never been taught any form of dance.  At social gatherings whether it be a school dance, wedding/anniversary, country music bar, military ball, or even an underground punk rock show, I was always on the sideline watching other people have fun and never knowing that the one form of dance could have me completely covered every occasion until I got this video.  By the time I finished the Swing Dancing Volume 1 video I had learned enough to go out and dance at virtually any venue from mild to wild.  The video begins with teaching you not only the basic steps, but also how to use the steps to any variety of music styles and speeds in a way that's simple to understand, even if you happen to be one of those people who has a problem staying with the beat of music.  In addition to the in depth step by step instruction, throughout the video Shawn adds many helpful hints along the way to help guys with the lead like keeping your partner's mind occupied by doing the left, right, and underarm turns he demonstrates.  Joanna also chimes in with helpful tips for the ladies from the followers perspective and makes sure that the followers have just as in depth step by step demonstration as the leaders receive from Shawn.  The only flaw this video had was that when the camera zoomed in on some parts of the instruction it used a digital zoom which causes a bit of clarity loss, but it does not the degrade the excellent quality of the lessons taught (which is what really matters), so I still give this video a 5 Star rating.  I'd recommend at least getting the Beginners Volume 2 Swing as well because you'll learn all the basics in this video fairly quick and want to start trying the more fancy turns, spins, wraps, and other moves to come in Volume 2.",1305417600,4,1780,4.408536585365853
2683172,5,B000K6R6EW,"My husband and I have been in love with big band music for years.  When we find a group that is playing locally, we are there.  we enjoy the night out to watch the dancers and the music.  We never knew where to begin with the dancing so we enviously watched.  Too afraid to make fools of ourselves on the dance floor.  Dance lessons at some of the facilities near us were out of our price range.  I am so fortunate that I found this collection.  I ordered the Swing Dance Volume I and II set.  We had so much fun learning comfortably in our own home (and privacy) and it wasn't long before we got up and out on to the dance floor ourselves. AND, we noticed we were NOT the least experienced dancers out there.  The fun we have had since being able to listen to the music as well as dance is amazing.  and all of it so affordable.  The instruction is so simple and easy to follow.  We were amazed.  We loved it so much we gave Volume I as a gift to our best friends.  I can't wait to learn more.  I highly recommend Shawn Troutman dance lessons to anyone considering learning to dance.  We went from no skill at all to feeling comfortable and having so much fun with it.  Shawn and Joanna's step-by-step demonstrations make it fun, easy and so not intimidating.  Just do it!!! It's fun!",1294358400,6,1285,4.19672131147541
2683173,5,B000K6R6EW,"2 Thumbs Up!  I purchased the Complete Volume Set of Shawn Trautman's Swing Dance Collection and it was a solid investment.  He breaks down steps very nicely with a great attention to detail and ease of instruction.  I love the ""laid back"" style, yet professionalism to show that ANYONE can dance and enjoy the benefits of social dancing.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants to invest in solid teaching in a nonthreatening, nonintimidating, yet, fun manner.  You can use his as a technical tool to enhance dance training or independently to learn new steps.  I've been teaching for years and am always looking for different DVDs and teaching materials to enhance my library.  I will be purchasing some other of his videos (Slow Dancing, West Coast Swing and others) to continue my training.  Great job Shawn and Joanna!  Keep up the good work!",1265932800,4,851,4.813793103448276
2683174,2,B000K6R6EW,"We had this rushed to re-learn the swing steps before a dance at our church.  I chose it because of the great reviews, but I'm sorry to say that we were a little disappointed.  There's a bit too much boring chit-chat.  When you finally get the parts where you follow along and dance, it's difficult because there is rarely any music, just the guy talking you through it.  I realize that they cannot use copyrighted music without permission. That being said, it would've been better to at least have a ticking metronome.  This is especially difficult when you're trying to turn, and can't always see the TV.  Also, the instructors are below average when it comes to articulating and enunciating their speech.  It was helpful, but more amateur than expected.",1264723200,6,756,4.769230769230769
2683175,5,B000K6R6EW,This DVD breaks down the basic steps in an easy and fun way.  It is the way they take the time to explain the steps and give tips on leaders' and followers steps that makes this DVD one of the best I have seen.,1259712000,3,210,3.772727272727273
2683176,3,B000K6R6EW,I bought this DVD along with Volume 2 and was a little disappointed. The video quality just isn't there - very fuzzy at times and it's not nearly as good as another DVD I got from DanceVision. The one I got from there is by Don Johnson - Anyone Can Dance Single Time Swing (Jitterbug). This one is a single DVD (only $24.99) with 12 steps you can learn with BOTH beginner & intermediate levels. Much better quality and easier to learn.,1257292800,3,435,4.317073170731708
2683177,5,B000K6R6EW,My husband and I got this DVD to practice for his brother's wedding.  We ended up having so much fun that we would just turn it on to have a date night.  It was very helpful that we could back up and practice a step if we didn't get it the first time. They stand so all we had to do was mirror them.  We really liked this dvd and want to get more of his DVDs.,1256428800,4,359,3.6363636363636362
2683178,5,B000K6R6EW,"This is THE best dance instruction DVD I've ever used.  I've taken ""live"" lessons in a group and learned the basics (I thought) but I always felt awkward.  Well, Shawn was able to explain some of the things beginners naturally want to do that MAKE us look awkward. Wow!

The DVDs are easy to watch and give more than one camera view of the feet and body. Most of all, you can start out as a complete beginner and not feel lost.  Then, each Shawn adds little pieces at a time so you can learn at your own pace.  You won't be disappointed with this purchase. Seriously.",1230595200,3,567,4.261682242990654

2683180,5,B000K6R6EW,"I've reviewed many ""dance lesson"" DVDs and videos made by professional dancers but they don't come close to the quality and depth of Shawn Trautman's.  Their DVDs are well made,( proper lighting, excellent audio, multiple views of the footwork, they zoom in on important technical points). The instruction is clear and the lessons are taught at the perfect pace.  It's like having the instructors right there in your home. They speak in detail to both the lead's role and the follower's.  They stand and dance as you will while watching and practicing(not facing you so that you have to look over your shoulder while following the moves).",1199750400,6,638,4.94392523364486
2683181,5,B000K6R6EW,"An excellent introduction to East Coast Swing, including single-time and triple-time. Shawn and Joanna have become our favorite dance teachers as they produce videos that we can actually follow step-by-step. Each new step is introduced, then repeatedly shown from various angles. Each step is shown from the Leader's perspective, and then the Follower's, and the Trautman's are talking you through it each step of the way.  This way you can start the DVD and dance right along with it, without constantly stopping, rewinding, and replaying parts. If you didn't get it the first time, just wait and they will show you again. There are lots of helpful hints, and enough moves to get you started on the dance floor. We ordered Beginners Volume 1 and Volume 2, as well as Intermediate Swing at the same time. We like to view the whole set first to see what's coming and to give us a goal. These DVD's are great learning tools, but we also keep them and use them repeatedly to accompany practice time, and as a refresher on things that we may have forgotten. Shawn and Joanna make it fun.  They have an easy-going informal style that makes you comfortable.
I highly recommend all three of these DVD's.",1190678400,22,1196,4.7451923076923075

I purchased the Swing Dancing for Beginners (both volumes) to supplement our lessons. To my delight Shawn teaches exactly what my dance instructor is teaching us. I wish I had found these DVD's before signing up for dance lessons. These DVD's are the same as taking professional dance lessons.  We also purchased the intermeadiate volume and have completed it as well. I highly recommend these DVD's to anyone who wants to learn the East Coast Swing quickly, correctly and know you are getting quality intruction.",1189987200,36,621,4.8584905660377355
2683183,5,B000K6R6EW,"I've seen two other swing DVDs, but this is the first one I've gotten anything out of as a beginner.  Needless to say, I was skeptical to buy this DVD even after reading all the reviews.  It turns out that THIS DVD IS GREAT!  The instruction is clear.  The instructors break each step down to the smallest detail (instead of just doing it 3 times and showing the different angles at a fast pace) and even break down the hand movements. They tell the timing and when to start footwork as well as the body positioning for moves.  My wife and I got a lot out of this DVD, and we now feel comfortable swing dancing in front of others.  I never thought I would see my wife smile like when we danced together.

2683184,5,B000K6R6EW,"Other than dancing with my son at his wedding, I am a dancing ""newbie""--so green that I was reluctant to go to a dance class! I have wanted to learn to dance for many years but never had a partner so I decided to take matters into my own hands and begin with DVD instruction. I made several unsuccessful phone calls with various suppliers until I happened upon Shawn Trautman's order department. An operator helped me personally select the first two DVD's to suit my needs and then long-story-short, I have purchased 12 DVD's to date. I received a personal email follow-up making sure that I had received the DVD's and that I was satisfied.

Shawn Trautman's teaching style is comprehensive and clear allowing for plenty of practice time within the lesson. The DVD format has all chapters clearly labeled allowing for precise access to a desired spot in the lesson. He and his wife, Joanna, give the lessons with plenty of tips for men on how to lead effectively and for the women, how to follow responsively...also provided are the much-needed tips on how to look stylish and confident as you take your first steps on the dance floor. It's great for us who fit into the ""fake it 'til you make it"" category!

I was cautioned by dancing friends to make sure the instruction I received was accurate as to avoid learning faulty technique. I have learned enough at home to Swing dance with several different partners and I have been complimented on my technique when I confess that I am a beginner.

The attention to detail on all facets of leading and following including the demonstration with the hula hoop was impressive.  The instructors are very relaxed and easy to follow on the floor.  The parts on connection points and on going from single swing to triple (east coast) swing were very helpful. If you want to learn how to Swing dance, go with this video.",1179619200,11,445,4.5375
2683186,5,B000K6R6EW,"Shawn and Joanna Trautman's three DVD series on Swing Dancing is an excellent way to learn Swing Dance basics. For example, both lead and follow basics are explained so that both the lead and the follow know exactly what to expect on every move. The lead's role is explained, the follow's role is explained, the individual move is explained, and then the move is done to music.

Also, at the end of the DVD, there is a summary of what was taught in the indidvidual DVD. I found that this really reinforced learning.

Furthermore, the difference between single step swing and triple step swing are explained. Plus, I thought the explaination of how to lead left turns and right turns proved helpful to me. It was explained in a way that I could grasp it.

I also thought that there customer service is excellent and that they were very respectful.

These DVD's are reccomended highly.",1176336000,19,883,4.67741935483871

The instructor breaks down each step, arm position, and dance position into its most basic form allowing a person who has never danced before to master the basics.

8154518,5,B000K6R6EW,"This DVD has been very helpful. We were taking lessons from a dancer.  She is a very good dancer and could show us steps.  However in this DVD Shawn showed us how to dance together.  The lead person has several signals to give the partner which we hadn't learned from her.  We were smoothly dancing together in a short period of time. I had struggled on the turns until this tape.  We were able to hit replay too, until we figured out I was skipping a step, which was putting us out of sync.  He takes each step one at a time, adding more steps in a reasonable pace.

I agree the DVD is not the best quality and does look like a copy of a copy ... but not to the point it cannot be viewed.  I also agree it should be cheaper since it is not the best quality for viewing.  However, it has been a very good instructional tape.  I have also used a Shawn Trautman's DVD for country line dancing. He does make great instructional DVD's so I would advice not to pass his DVD's up because of the quality reviews.",1486425600,2,1005,4.107692307692307

It hard to make out what they are doing. Very bad quality. As for the content, it is mediocre at best.  I do not recommend this product.",1473292800,,278,4.450980392156863
8154521,5,B000K6R6EW,"My sweetheart and I have been taking lessons at a famous and expensive dance studio in our city for 7 months. We feel that we know more than when we started but inadequate to dance swing publically.  Plus, we feel we are ignored as to what we want to learn. The studio desires long term competitive dancers.  I thought there has to be a better way.  And that better way is Shawn's videos.  After viewing and practicing a few times, we can dance swing wherever we go.  My sweetheart feels confident too although he hasn't practiced as much as I have.  I love the chance to practice and practice and see the dance from different angles.  I like Shawn's instructions  and his wife's instruction is helpful for the ladies  The quality of the video isn't perfect but I can easily see what to do next.  Thank you so much.  We are dancing and ready for Volume 2..",1468972800,,856,4.388535031847134
8154522,2,B000K6R6EW,I bought volumes 1 and 2.  The two videos pretty much over the basic step and an under arm turn.  The quality of the video is poor.,1463702400,,131,3.814814814814815
8154523,5,B000K6R6EW,"I gave this DVD to my husband for Christmas.  We both love to dance, but are still in the learning phase.  Shawn and Joanna are terrific instructors.  This DVD is for the inexperienced.  It goes step by step with a lot of repetition which is great for beginners!  My husband and I have taken dance lessons and this DVD instruction is better than some of the personal instructors we've had.  Highly recommend it.  We are learning some things we were not taught by local instructors.  We will continue to use this DVD and will return to it time and again.  Thank you, Shawn and Joanna!  When we become more confident we will move on to Volume 2!",1455926400,,643,4.418803418803419

8154525,3,B000K6R6EW,"My 3 stars is my ""averaged"" rating based on 4 stars for content and 1 star for video quality.

This seems like the DVD was reproduced from an old, worn VHS copy. Extremely grainy and would often pixelate, making it barely watchable in parts.

I've watched a preview of Shawn's 101 series, and it's video quality is excellent, in comparison.
I also bought the Volume 2 video in this series...same poor video quality.

In my opinion, the selling price should reflect the video quality, which is obviously known to the producer. For the price, I would expect the same high quality as his more recent video productions.

On a positive note, Shawn's instruction did help me with the left and right turn footwork I struggled with when I took a ""drop in"" swing lesson at a local club.",1437004800,,777,4.608695652173913
