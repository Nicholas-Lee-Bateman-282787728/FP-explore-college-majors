2289416,5,B0009GV9H8,He was absolutely hilarious the entire show. A no-brainer for anyone to purchase. I've recommended to several of my friends. I've watched it quite a few times. He has a nice style and doesn't hold anything back. You'll love it,1143417600,4,226,4.675
2289417,5,B0009GV9H8,"Jeni turns out a stunningly brilliant performance in this piece, tying up all his scattered comedic topics together by the end of the show like only he can. What a legacy.  After catching this show on cable, it was masterful to see him in person in Orlando.  Use of language not for those who blush, but it's not just vulgarly thrown in as some other comedains often do just for the sake of saying them. My 75 year-old father-in-law laughs his natural teeth off and blows his hearing aids out watching the show...Christmas present problem solved!  Keep it up Richard.",1133222400,4,567,4.65

2289467,5,B0009GV9H8,"Not only was this the final appearance of the late Richard Jeni, but it was also his funniest. sheer perfection in observational study. Now don't get me wrong, A Good Catholic Boy is probably just as funny, but with the addition of politics and world turmoil with terrorist attacks he really covers the gamat of some important issues. He did 4 major standups and all were good. But these last two is where he honed his trade. And as of late his family has tried to release anything he has put out. including a new cd of some unreleased material. So go to the official website for all the other dvd's. It supports his family estate. And most of these are no longer available through other sources. But Big Steaming Pile of Me is and so go ahead and place your order. Sit back when it arrives and pay tribute to one of the funniest comedians ever to grace a stage and microphone. Each stand up is completely different. there is no recycling of material. Which is what really made him a genius. ""Imagine a small little peckerhead like me having my own satellite dish"" Rest In Peace Bro and thank you!!!",1388966400,3,1099,4.445544554455446

2289480,5,B0009GV9H8,"This is the last filmed special by a man who I consider to be the best stand-up comic I have ever seen.  I was lucky enough to have seen him live twice at Banana's Comedy Club at the Holiday Inn in NJ, and he was great both times.  He had an awesome ability to go off on tangents, whether dealing with hecklers or just making observations about people in the crowd.  Sometimes it felt like you were hanging out with a hilarious buddy rather than watching a paid comic with pre-written material.  At one point in the show the first time I saw him (which was his Platypus tour), after he had already gone massively overtime, he said he didn't have anywhere to go that night, so he was just going to keep talking until he got tired, and maybe all of us (he and the audience of over a hundred) should all just get a room to continue his act.  lol

That genius is clearly evident in this special.  I just wish they would re-release his other two specials, so a new generation of audiences can learn to love him like I and my friends do.

Such a unique talent who will always be missed.  RIP Richard.",1369267200,,1094,4.221153846153846

2289488,5,B0009GV9H8,"Richard Jeni had to be one of the funniest comics of his time and the loss of him was so tragic that it has taken me THIS long to even write the review. I literally stumbled across this show halfway through one night as I was searching through the channels looking for something to watch.
I laughed so hard that tears were running down my face. He was absolutely hysterical with the faces he made and the way he would strut across the stage. I loved the fact that he was talking about ""taboo"" current events like Martha Stewart and Michael Jackson and I agreed with everything he was saying. I had never heard of him and absolutely loved him! I was able to find his show on another time and set my DVR to record figuring that I would someday record it onto a VCR to keep. Then I had to move and although I looked all over the HBO website for it, much to my dismay I was unable to find it to purchase.
That alone says a LOT. I rarely if ever purchased a movie on VCR or DVD and still don't. The few that I own are ones that I have seen over 20 times (literally) at least and still laugh just as hard as the first time I saw it or is a long term television series that I never tire of watching (OZ the prison show from HBO). I own less than a dozen separate movies and they are comedies and one exercise tape I absolutely adore.
To say I was thrilled beyond belief to find this DVD was an ultimate understatement. I was in comedy heaven and knew I could finally erase it off my DVR and if I needed a new DVR; there would be no problem. I had already given up one recording of it when I moved in with my husband; however I was able to find it again to record.
I was devastated and still feel a deep sense of sadness when I think of Richard Jeni's passing and how unnecessary it seemed. I was even more appalled by the huge lack of comment on it and how it didn't seem as though many cared. I wanted to scream it from the rooftops and tell everyone everywhere what a comedy genius we had lost. I know that some of the media shied away from seeking comments on his passing etc as that is what they do when it is a self-inflicted incident. However in this time and age when words that are considered ""swear"" words are used on television in prime time and girls under 10 are getting pregnant; I honestly don't see that reporting this type of passing is going to cause any more people to do or think about it than were doing so before! Again, this is just my opinion.
Richard Jeni, I love you and you were a total riot in this show; my only regret is that you didn't live on to make others and travel so that I would have the change to have you sign this and enjoy more or your hilarious truths of today. I know you would have had a wonderful time with our last election and all the different things going on today. I hope you are making them laugh until tears run down their faces wherever you are!",1306540800,,2891,4.073684210526316

Tragic that he ended his life;  who knows what joy he could have brought to so many had he just could have ridden out the dark times.  But such is the life of the artistic geniuses",1205712000,,365,3.891891891891892
2289529,5,B0009GV9H8,"Richard Jeni hit a homerun with this performance that was originally shown for a number of years on HBO.  His carefully crafted portrayal of the human condition and hilarious satirical treatments are perfectly balanced to allow him the opportunity to poke fun at everyone without polarizing his audience, unless of course you're maybe Michael Jackson, a mindless liberal, a right-wing neo-con, or a fence-sitting whiner.  That just about covers all of us at one level or another, which is why Mr. Jeni is so funny and incredibly poignant.
In spite of the fact that the video is a few years old, it is still marvelously in step with the current, American-cultural-dynamic that shapes our collective conscience.  Richard is incredibly astute when it comes to pointing out our undeniable human nature and bringing to the surface the comic irony of the less than perfect treatments we all apply, with such fervor, to our lives.
It is maybe the funniest stand-up performance I've ever seen, but don't take my word, watch it for yourself. I belly laugh every time I see this video and can say every person I've shown or given this CD to has had the same reaction.
The performance is little racy at times and should be for adult viewing.
For those of you who don't know it, Richard committed sucicide recently, which is too bad.  I mourned his passing for a number of months last year and really didn't want to watch the video for a while.  I recently showed it to some family and friends and the effect was the same,  none of us could stop laughing, in spite of the circumstances surrounding his death.
So, take a look at this remarkably humorous diatribe and pass it along.  I like to believe this is probably how Richard would want to be remembered.",1198368000,,1745,4.701639344262295

I loved that he didn't take himself too seriously, at least performing, sadly he did in life. I love him so much and am still mourning the loss.

2289537,5,B0009GV9H8,"I had the distinct pleasure of seeing Richard Jeni live a few years ago and I gotta tell you that I really almost peed my pants. He was astoundingly funny. This DVD definitely captures his comic genius, although it is woefully short compared to the amazing talent that he is and that he expressed in the huge amount of material he developed.

It was incredibly sad to see that he took his own life which, from what I heard, was based at least in part on the fact that he was not able to get the gigs he used to get, which is itself really sad. He developed what I think is the best comedy, which is comedy that stings and bites because it reveals us human beings as full of weaknesses that are, ultimately, pretty stupid in the face of everything good in this world.

He will be sorely missed in this world that needs more people to show us all the dumb things we do...and by doing so, how we should and can be a lot better than we are.",1177632000,7,936,4.137362637362638

His humor, from yeast infections being surrounded by helicopters, to pubic hairs escaping on a bar of soap, was incredible. His best bit, is the Belching Gourmet (not here).

WHY...did he not recieve the accolades of much lesser comedians who reached fame? I watched every HBO special he did, and was hilarified.

WHY...hasn't someone put together a collection of his cable specials?

WHY...do I feel so bad he killed himself when I never met him? Because when I watched his shows, I DID feel as if I had met him.

2289550,5,B0009GV9H8,"I just finished visiting the Richard Jeni website, signed the guestbook, and was glad to see that SO many people loved Richard's comedy as much as I. This, his final HBO special, affected me as it did most people intelligent enough to recognize great humor when they see & hear it: I laughed out loud, and often, probably waking my upstairs neighbors. I always knew Richard was funny from seeing his various TV appearances and his bits in movies, but I didn't realize he was capable of an hour-long HBO special that had me in STITCHES. If you get this DVD, you won't be disappointed. The only disappointment I feel now--in addition to the pain of grieving over his loss--is not having seen him in a live concert setting. His death, for me, is right up there with the untimely loss of other comedy greats: John Belushi. Bill Hix. John Candy. Phil Hartman. Chris Farley. Sam Kinison.

Rest in peace, Rich. You brought a lot of life and laughter into an all-too-often very sad world. Thank you for that and so much more.

8060355,5,B0009GV9H8,"One of the best 1-hour specials ever produced. From the political bit, to the masturbating bit, to the driving bit, Jeni is Carlin meets Seinfeld, the perfect combination of cynicism, wordsmith, insight and outright humor. Jeni should be appreciated more especially in this new revival of standup comedy, he is every bit as important to the recent history of comedy as some of his better-known peers.",1507852800,,400,5.075757575757576
