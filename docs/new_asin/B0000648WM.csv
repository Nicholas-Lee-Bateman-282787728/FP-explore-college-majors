1705522,1,B0000648WM,"In the 02 release the sound has been re-recorded or ""mastered"" or something like that. Also the credit roll track has been changed in the second movie; replaced with AISENSHI from the climactic fight scene. The result was for me an unpleasant surprise. It had been a long time since I had seen the originals and I was feeling nostalgic so I rented them. I am glad i did not jut buy them straight away. It all seems out of place and just wrong. Great covers though. If you can I strongly suggest you look for an older release.",1214352000,2,525,4.313131313131313
1705523,1,B0000648WM,"I was so looking forward to this finally coming out on dvd since I have the movies on VHS and they were dubbed, but when the dvds came out and weren't dubbed I was pissed",1141603200,5,170,3.8857142857142857
1705524,5,B0000648WM,"I had to review when I saw that this has gotten some negative reviews.  For shame, people, for shame.
Anyway, this is the original Mobile Suit Gundam; well, condensed into a 7 hour movie trilogy anyway.  I'm going to be honest and say that sitting down and watching this for 7 hours does get pretty long, even for a diehard Gundam fan like myself.  However, the animation is crisp and the voice actors are the original Japanese, as opposed to the cheap TV series and its even cheaper dub.  So, whenever I want to watch a scene from MSG that's in the movies, I choose that over the TV series.
Anyway, this anime has it all: war, politics, battles, romance, drama, even comedy.  I am a teenage girl who by all rights should love Wing, but instead loves MSG.  The characters are incredible; well-developed and totally realistic.  And may I say that MSG's romances tend to be subtle, but they are simply awesome.
This was my first taste of the original Gundam, and after watching it I could not understand why people would say that it's good, but only a small taste of it.  And after watching the TV series, I realized how right they were.  Honestly, I enjoyed the TV series so much, and it covers a lot more than the movie does.  So, if you want to be ""hardcore"" UC Gundam, I recommend watching the TV series.  Try and stomach the dub.
But if you just want a nice amount of background information or even just a glimpse of what UC Gundam has to offer, this is an excellent source to tap.  The animation may be from the 70's, but the story is a masterpiece.",1072742400,4,1553,4.372822299651568
1705565,5,B0000648WM,"This product is perfect for me, because I love the Gundam saga, I cant wait to have the next season II collection box.",1512691200,4,118,4.173913043478261
1705566,5,B0000648WM,"I was very happy to get this edition of the first season of Iron Blooded Orphans. The whole package is great quality! The box comes in a nice plastic sleeve that protects it while making it look nice. The Card board holder for the Blu-ray boxes is really strong and finished with a polished design that makes it sturdy and great to hold your Blu-ray boxes in (there is even room for season 2 when that comes out). The art book is a cool little added bonus and the Model was fantastic! Its a high grade model and the metallic injection style really was a nice touch. All in all, I highly recommend getting this if you're a fan of Gundam.",1512172800,3,636,4.264462809917355
1705567,5,B0000648WM,This set comes with part one and part two of season 1 for Gundam ibo in both bluray and DVD. It also comes with 2 background pieces 1 that's just for if you want to use it as a background and the other is to fill the space in the collectible box saved for season 2. That case also has the collectible art booklet inside (paperback). And one of the best parts is this kit comes with a fumigation exclusive barbatos in a really nice color.,1511913600,,437,4.093023255813954

1705569,5,B0000648WM,"I'm Not sure which edition some people are reviewing, but this review is for the premium edition of Iron blooded orphans complete season 1 released November 14, 2017.  The box includes season one part 1 and season 1 part 2, all 25 episodes, with enough room for season 2 when it is released.  It includes both the blu rays and dvds in japanese with subtitles and english dub.  There is also a limited edition gundam model and art book included.  I have not watched the dubbed version but the subtitled version on the blu ray is done well.  The video and audio quality are nice.  I purchased my set from best buy because I had a coupon, but I have purchased other official licensed anime from Amazon and not been disappointed.",1510963200,11,725,4.4961832061068705
1705570,5,B0000648WM,Love this collection. Great kits and awesome stuff. Great English dub and Funimation did a best release. Im watching season 2 on Toonami now.,1510617600,,141,4.916666666666667

1705572,4,B0000648WM,"Hi this version of mobile suit gundam  is one of the more better one that have been made so far! This one was made with really life in mind. It is like a really long movie that you want to watch it through so you could get to the end to find out what happens. The video was made in a HD but, with no computer imaging. Unlike other movies if someone got hurt you can see them bleed. The things I didn't like about it they didn't put it all in one box so you got to buy 2 to get it all.",1510358400,,484,3.6538461538461537
1705573,4,B0000648WM,"This is another fantastic modern Gundam series.  If focuses on a rag tag bunch of space orphans who learn how to work and stay together no matter the odds.  There's action, drama, and lots to like about this series.  This isn't your typical Gundam series where its all about corrupt governments and which side to chose, don't get me wrong there's still is plenty of it but you don't get lost in all of it like some of the older series.  0083 is still one of my favorite series but this is a very close 2nd for me (I also love Gundam Wing).  You obviously want to root for these Orphans!  I can't wait for this set!",1503619200,16,614,4.205128205128205
1705574,3,B0000648WM,"The disc is fine, but the DVD case was broken with a label attached that did not allow to see the movie art. Next time, please, avoid to attach any label to the front of the case.
Thanks.",1417478400,,187,3.9473684210526314

7960433,5,B0000648WM,If you're a fan of all the other Gundam series out there like myself then I highly recommend this series.,1521590400,,105,4.3
7960434,1,B0000648WM,"*DISCLAIMER* This is a review of my experience with ordering this, not the actual quality of the disc or product. I received my order and the blu ray case was empty. Upon further examination, the case and insert looked like to be a bootleg or something. The disc case itself was the one-disc case, not the four disc case I was expecting. What was odd is it was still wrapped as if brand new. Please be sure to check and test everything if you decide to order this in the future.",1520208000,,478,4.263736263736264

7960436,5,B0000648WM,"The box is awesome! The disks were in fine condition and I know I'll enjoy rewatching this season. On a final note, the Gundam model kit is not to be taken lightly. I detached a wrong part from the kit for the head, and lost the piece hehe. Lesson learned for my first attempt at a build I suppose. Overall I was very happy with purchase",1517097600,,337,4.121212121212121
7960437,5,B0000648WM,Awesome box set!,1516665600,,16,4.666666666666667
7960438,4,B0000648WM,"The box is really nice, with the bonus art book and Gunpla making it feel special. This first season of the show is a classic. It's extremely engaging and fun to watch, while carving its own path without relying on too many of Gundam's well-worn tropes - though there are still a few moments of familiarity.

For all this praise, I can't give this 5 out of 5 due to the audio. The only audio tracks are both 2.0 channel tracks. My Endless Waltz DVD from 2001 has a 5.1 track, so this is unbelievably disappointing. It sounds terrible on my (admittedly dated, but how often do you change out your surround sound system?) 5.1 system with almost no low-end presence and really flat reproduction of the opening and ending music. For a lossless format, my ears sure are losing a lot as compared to how much better this show sounded on the Crunchyroll stream while it aired.

Aside from the sound, it's a great set!",1515456000,,909,4.469879518072289
7960439,5,B0000648WM,"Great value for the gan and a collector.
First you get the full season 1 on Bluray and a Special release kit that is only included in this set. And more.
I haven't really seen any of these types of releases for along time. Worth it. If you are a fan of the series.
Which if you haven't seen. Is a new fresh take for the Gundam franchise. Give it a watch and you'll be pleasantly surprised.",1515369600,,389,4.064935064935065
7960440,4,B0000648WM,"If you should watch anything of Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron Blooded Orphans, please just watch the first season as the second season is generally a huge mess and a disappointment from a story aspect all together. You should be warned that the seasons are very different. Season 1 has a clear and concise plot line that sets up characters and flows great story wise. The second season is a train wreck that doesn't flow at all well whatsoever  with the first season and feels disconnected.

I don't want to judge the whole show off of one awful trainwreck of a season so I feel that I have to say that most will only need to really watch season 1 of IBO to actually experience any of the great writing and storytelling of this show. When season 2 comes out, avoid it like the plague. It's such a let down and a meandering slop of a season with nothing but a collection of loose plot threads that resemble a story that it almost ruined this season for me. I won't spoil season 2 but yes, this show goes downhill fast because the writers  forsake all the good writing they did in the first season. It's a pity that this show fell so apart like that. But I can with all recommendation vouch for the first season's being really good. Though I wouldn't want to buy a box set like this of it that is large and costs so much.",1514678400,3,1314,4.290322580645161
