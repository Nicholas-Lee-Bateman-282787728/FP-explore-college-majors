8603963,5,B00004W5NZ,"I borrowed this video from our local library for my three-year-old ballerina and it became an instant favorite after one viewing!  It's genuinely fun and the dance steps are easy to follow yet challenging for my sophisticated preschooler. The main attraction of this video is that kids demonstrate the dance steps. Even though my little girl loves ballet and this video features jazz dance, she'll choose this video over our ballet video selections any day. It's especially fun to see my daughter frequently demonstrate what she's learning from Time to Dance. She gives this video 5 stars.",1054166400,2,589,5.072164948453608
