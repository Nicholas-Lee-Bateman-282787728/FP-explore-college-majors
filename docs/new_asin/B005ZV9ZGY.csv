4911488,5,B005ZV9ZGY,Sound quality is great.  Every song I wanted to here was on this disc.  The concert ends on a great note.  Just really really awesome,1377648000,,133,4.24
4911489,4,B005ZV9ZGY,"Good Blu-ay. The live is very good.
It lacks just a documentary to be perfect ! Maybe on the next BR :-)",1363392000,,104,3.772727272727273
4911490,5,B005ZV9ZGY,"This film is exactly what you expect it to be. They only have two albums, so they play almost all of their songs with a cover of Psycho Killer by the Talking Heads. The quality is definitely up to par and the camera angles are great. If you've never seen these guys live, you will for sure want to pick this up. Just so you know, they get pretty wild during their concerts. This also comes with three live videos from Lollapalooza earlier 2011, which is pretty awesome. I would reccomend this to any fan of the band. You can also get the cd at Walmart and Best Buy. The cd costs as much as the Blu-Ray though, so I reccomend this.",1326672000,2,630,4.172131147540983
4911491,5,B005ZV9ZGY,"I had taken my son to see Cage the Elephant at the Vic, not knowing it was going to be taped for a DVD.  I had liked CTE before, especially their Thank You, Happy Birthday CD.  However, I was not truly a fan until I saw them live.  This concert was simply amazing.  Right from the start, they had the entire crowd.  Lots of crowd surfing, audience participation on stage and the best stage dive by Matt Schultz off of something like a 12 foot speaker.  The DVD does a great job capturing the vib that night, though reality was much better.  It's great having a keepsake of the show.  If you've never seen CTE live, this is an amazing look into their performance style.  They are a better live band than studio band.  The DVD also includes a CD of the entire show.  Money well spent!  I also got see a lot of my kid in the opening shots, as they brought him to the front of the line for wearing a CTE t-shirt.  Proud mom.",1326067200,4,920,4.129943502824859
4911492,5,B005ZV9ZGY,"First I'm going to say I got this dvd/cd for a steal at $14. For anybody who has seen them live (or even if you haven't) and is a huge fan...like me. You'll enjoy this concert! This concert is a full 2 hours and has the whole 2nd album and about 1/2 of the first. Plus, they have two covers from Talking Heads and Pavement in there which was cool. You get to see how these guys in the past couple years have grown as musicians. But some of the best performances, are definatly ""Rubber Ball"" when you get to see Tich play the guitar on stage (which doesn't happen every show)!!! and ""Shivers"" (Right before my eyes) with a amazing performance by Matt just strumming his guitar by himself on stage which was probably the best part of the concert! Oh, and the audio cd that comes along with the dvd was better than I expected! The whole concert including the opening credits is included to that cd and everything.",1325721600,6,910,4.3274853801169595
4911493,5,B005ZV9ZGY,"I wouldnt have said I was a huge Cage the Elephant fan before today.  I have listened to all their songs on the radio and loved every one of them.  Today I watched this concert and appreciate them for their many other songs, this performance, their spirit of a young band, a crowd of people that are truly into the music, a great video with awesome sound, and the energy I got from watching this concert.  I listened to the CD first in my car going to work and I was impressed but not sure how the concert would be.  Came home and watched it right after work.  It was insanely entertaining.  Its weird to say but I don't want to ruin the performance by giving anything away but I will say this:  1) You will see an ""Eddie Vedder"" towards the end 2) The very last song is super cool to watch  3) These guys can rock!!!

I shouldn't even have to write that much considering its release price of $13!  But after you watch it, you will understand that this video is very unique and makes me smile knowing that rock is still alive and growing!!! I would like to mention that for anyone that is not familiar with the band, listen to some of their tunes.  If you like punk rock, alternative, Nirvana then you will NOT be dissappointed.  Just buy it already.  Those that have seen this show will understand my enthusiasm.  It was incredible!!",1325548800,3,1334,4.305220883534137
8489981,5,B005ZV9ZGY,"This is an amazing show by an amazing band. Matt's stage dive is reason enough to buy this. I saw them live on March 4, 2017 and they were even better. This is just a wonderful taste of how they are on stage. Already, three friends have asked to borrow this blu ray and I always tell them that believe it or not, they are even better now!",1491523200,,338,3.985294117647059
