4988016,5,B006H0SW6G,I haven't been this riveted in ages!  Amazon made its money back on this big time! Just make sure you have blocks of time set aside.,1393286400,,132,4.076923076923077
4988017,5,B006H0SW6G,"My favorite types of tv shows are darker and gritty and tend to revolve around crime and mystery.  I also like watching flicks from other countries.  For the most part when watching foreign items I have stuck to watching films (besides a few BBC shows like Luther).  I saw a review for this that was compelling and so have watched the first season so far.  I thought it was fantastic!  The fact that it is based on a true story is all the more appealing.  Of course I had to google some of the real people that were portrayed in this film - they chose actors who looked similar to the real folks.  The first season revolves around a ""gang war"" from around 1995 to around 2005 in Australia.  One of the newspaper articles I read had interviewed a police office on the task force and the officer said something to the effect that what happened between these two gangs couldn't have been more over-the-top.
If you like shows like Sopranos, The Wire, and Luther you'll enjoy this one too.",1392422400,,984,4.427777777777778
