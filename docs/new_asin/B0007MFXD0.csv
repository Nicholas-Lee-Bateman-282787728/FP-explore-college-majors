8048919,5,B0007MFXD0,"I bought the Billy Blazes firetruck for my grandson who is almost 2, and got two Rescue Heros DVDs to go along with it.  Billy Blazes figure comes with the firetruck.  He enjoys watching the DVD, which features Billy Blaze, and it is in 11 minute segments, so works for him now at 11 - 20 minutes and he will definitely grow with it.
