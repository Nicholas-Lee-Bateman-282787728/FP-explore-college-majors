8320118,4,B001LXQ17Q,"There are many travel shows, but Rick's show is the cream of the crop. Samantha Brown is an airhead who spends half of an episode getting a massage or drinking wine. The Globe Trekkers care more about getting stoned or attending a Gay Pride Parade than actually exploring historical sites. Rick, on the other hand, is different. He tells you everything you need to know about a country. There is very little fluff in the episodes.

This review pertains to the episodes I watched. Obviously, some cities are more interesting than others. I must point out that for some reason, THE ISTANBUL EPISODE WOULDN'T PLAY ON MY DVD PLAYER. And I purchased it directly from Rick's website. Still, I got my money's worth.

The VIENNA episode begins at the Schnbrunn Palace. It has a nice garden in the front. It was built to celebrate the Habsburg royal family. He later visited the St. Stevens Cathedral and Charles Church. The highlight of the episode was the Kunsthistorisches Museum. The Hopfburg Palace and Vienna State Opera House were also featured in the episode. Rick pointed out that during the summer, there are free outdoor concerts in Vienna. The episode concluded with a visit to a monastery in Melk and a village called Vaka, which has a lot of green space and bike paths.

In BARCELONA, he visited the Plaza Catalunya. Rick discussed the animosity that people in the Catalonia region have towards mainland Spain. Rick stopped by the Boqueria market. Next, Rick made a rare bad decision- he visited the Christopher Columbus Monument. Columbus slaughtered Indians and took their land. Next, Rick visited the former Olympic Village. It was turned into a man-made beach. The Picasso Museum is probably Barcelona's most famous attraction. It wasn't my cup of tea since I'm not into art. Later, Rick stopped by a tapas bar. They served beer and finger food. It looked tasty. The Church of the Holy Family, which Rick said would take 50 years to complete (?), was also featured. Towards the end of the episode, Rick took a cable car to a monastery. I personally felt that the Barcelona episode was below average.

The SWISS CITIES episode was much better. Switzerland has an efficient high speed rail system. Rick rode the trains on numerous occasions. My favorite part of the episode was when he visited a secret fortress in a mountain. The Swiss army used that to fight the Nazis and Communist Russia. It is decommissioned and open to the public. Switzerland also has many picturesque cities, including Zurich and Luzerne. Lausanne is a nice, hilly city, though it is a little too commercialized (there was a McDonald's in a historical part of town. I felt that was tacky).

ATHENS was a fun episode. Rick visited the Acropolis and Parthenon Temple, which was dedicated to the goddess Athena. He also visited the Temple of Hephaestus. Rick used the Athens Metro, which is a clean and efficient subway system. Athens is a fairly large city (4 million people). Contrary to popular belief, it's not just historical sites. It also has modern skyscrapers. In addition, there were quite a few attractive women in the city. Rick's last stop in Athens was the National Archaeological Museum. He took a side trip to Delphi, where he saw the Oracle of Apollo, and Hydra (hee-dra), which is a traffic-free island. Everyone on the island used donkeys to get around.

COPENHAGEN was another enjoyable episode. It began with Rick riding a boat in a canal (Copenhagen has canals just like Amsterdam). He visited the National Museum, which contained artifacts from the Bronze Age. He mentioned that Copenhagen is a bike-friendly city. King's Garden was a nice park. Nearby was the Rosenborg Castle, where Christian IV once resided. My favorite part of the episode was the visit to Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek (Carlsberg Art Museum). The museum was founded by a rich family that owned a brewery. The museum has exotic Mediterranean plants as well as a myriad of paintings and sculptures.

Rick used the Copenhagen Metro. Like Athens, it is a clean and modern system (I wish the NYC subway was as nice as the subways in Europe). Later, Rick visited the Christiana Commune. Hippies turned a former military base into a thriving community. At the time they took over, the property was worthless. As the years progressed, however, the property increased in value. The episode concluded with a visit to Tivoli Gardens. It is way better than Disney and Six Flags. In addition to an amusement park, it also has adult activities like concerts.

My favorite episode on this DVD was the DENMARK BEYOND COPENHAGEN episode. It began with a stop at the Frederiksborg Castle. Later, Rick passed by the resund Bridge, which connects Denmark and Sweden. The bridge, which was quite impressive, carries cars, trucks, and trains. Denmark invests in its infrastructure. They spend money on trains, bridges, and tunnels, not wars. Rick visited the Roskilde Viking Ship Museum and Odense, where Hans Christian Anderson once lived. His house features some of his literary works, as well as a children's fairytale theater.

My favorite part of the episode was the visit to Legoland. I used to play with Legos when I was a kid. Legoland features roller coasters, model trains, and lego structures, including Mount Rushmore and the Statue of Liberty. Rick later visited the bohemian town of Arhus. The Open Air Folk Museum featured actors who dress up like 19th century Danish residents. The episode concluded with a visit to Aeroskobing, which has sailing vessels, farms, windmills, and solar panels. After watching both Denmark episodes, I can see why Denmark has one of the highest standards of living in the world.",1369785600,,5669,4.9277486910994766
