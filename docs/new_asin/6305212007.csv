1003369,5,6305212007,"After arguing with Slingshot Entertainments customer service person, I emailed her boss.
He advised me that they were re-mastering this dvd, and reissuing a new version.  He then sent me the new version, and it is a 100 percent improvement.  The dark and grainy version that showed the segments of the imax screen has been replaced by a first class digitally remastered version.
The cover looks different than the original.
If you have problems, contact Slingshot Entertainment and request they replace your old version with the new.
Thanks to Slingshot for doing the right thing.",1025049600,14,580,5.094736842105263
1003370,2,6305212007,"My dad bought this DVD in Arizona after watching the presentation at the IMAX theater but he was disappointed when we watched it at home on our Sharp LCD projector (on a 5-foot screen).  The video quality was VHS-level at best and not even close to what we've become accustomed to from DVD's.  The film seemed grainy and the colors were not as distinct and lifelike as they had appeared in the theater.  The audio quality was pretty good, but the narration was a bit on the dull side.  The camera shots were done pretty well but we were looking forward to more helicopter fly-by shots through the Grand Canyon itself.
I hope they re-do this video from scratch and stick to the high-quality film that IMAX theaters are famous for.",1007942400,7,729,4.541984732824427

1003372,3,6305212007,"I have the Slingshot edition (DVD9804) of this IMAX video. The print quality is pretty good but as a few others have mentioned there are one or two scratches and marks on the print used to make this DVD which is a bit  disappointing considering on the back of the case it says the title was  digitally remastered. I thought that would have been the time to fix such  problems. When I saw this film at my local Imax I thought it looked a bit  dark. I was told by the manager that early Imax cinemas used silver instead  of white screens. (Anyone know if this is correct). Early Imax films also  used a different film stock (?) which resulted in the dark look on the  white screen. I don't know if this effects the look of this DVD or not.  Apart from the one or two little scrathes it looks rather good throughout.  A 4,000 year History of the Canyon, most it European history of the last  500 years, is used to link endlessly beatuiful shots of the Canyon  together. Much of the middle section of the film is a ride sequence down  rapids. Its spectacular and I assume would have been extremely dangerous to  film. It certainly looks dangerous. Lots of helicopter shots, some nicely  executed re-enactments and thats about it. There is however a nice link  between an early sequence and the end of the film which ties up the  narrative nicely. Worth getting if your never likely to get to the Grand  Canyon yourself. I would have liked an ambience and music option on this  DVD, but sadly its not there. There is an additional 9 minute making of  featurette on this edition which shows how difficult films like this are to  make. Keith Merrill also made Niagara: Miracles, Myths and Magic, which is  done in exactly the same style as GC.",949190400,28,1736,4.430379746835443
1003373,3,6305212007,"This is more a history lesson on the Grand Canyon than being one of ""Hidden Secrets"".  Although quite informative, it only gives a brief history.

1003374,1,6305212007,"After the spectacular IMAX ""Super Speedway"" I looked forward to this DVD, but was sorely disappointed.  Many shots have the look of being filmed a little soft, then digitally sharpened, producing a nasty ringing  along edges.  Also, the camera is clearly vibrating during many static  shots, leaving the picture trembling and hard to watch.  Moving shots are  generally good, though the print shows evidence of dirt and streaks.  Narration is pompous, and the attempt at narrative is like the worst  educational films.  Even the packaging has problems, listing chapters and  times for the documentary supplement incorrectly. The only bright point was  the sound, which was a quite good Dolby Digital 5.1 channel mix.",916963200,8,716,5.247787610619469

1003542,1,6305212007,"What do you get when you watch a 30+ minuet movie about the Grand Canyon that spends no time discussing what the GC is and how it was formed, spends about 1 minuet covering 4000 years of history of the native people that inhabited it, and a few minuets covering John Wesley Powell river expedition? That's right...... Grand Canyon - The Hidden Secrets

I had the pleasure of spending an entire day hiking along various trails of the canyon the day before I decided to watch the movie hoping to learn more about the canyon. I honestly thought watching the movie would enhance my hiking experience the day before. So to say the movie was a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT is the understatement of the year. The film lacked depth in providing historical and factual information on the Native inhabitants as well as the early settlers. The film also failed to accurately depict most of the canyon's wildlife. Nothing in that film truly showed me what the canyon truly was and how it came to exist. All I saw were close-up (and slow-motion) shots of settlers' boats battling through the Colorado river rapids, and a guy in a hang-glider towards the end. It was pitiful attempt at a sales pitch to encourage viewers to do a whitewater/helicopter/hang-gliding tour. I will admit that (in the IMAX version) some of the aerial views were pretty spectacular but their luster wore away pretty quickly. If you want to buy or watch a movie that lacks depth and  substance, but instead is a cheap sales attempt to lure you into purchasing the canyon's ""recreational"" services then by all means, this movie is for you. If you were like me, and wanted to see a movie depict the canyon from a historical/scientific context (you know, something you would see on discovery channel) then this movie is not (and I repeat IS NOT) for you!  For the first time in my life I demanded a refund after seeing a movie. I plan on voicing my humble opinion to the makers of this movie as well.

This movie lacks substance and will not fail to disappoint you no matter what format you watch it in.",1151798400,8,2053,4.601092896174864

The 30 minute film tells about the rich history of the canyon, from the early native settlers 4000 years ago to the Spanish discoverers of the 1500's, to the Powell expedition of the 19th century, to the present day hikers and explorers.  The music by ""Rocky"" composer, Bill Conti gives the film an awesome presence.

7886603,2,6305212007,"GRAND CANYON: THE HIDDEN SECRETS A TIMELESS ADVENTURE is a 60 minute movie concerning The Grand Canyon.  The Grand Canyon is 277 miles long and up to 18 miles wide, with a depth that at points reaches 6,093 feet (over a mile).  In the year 1540 (or shortly thereafter), the first European viewing The Grand Canyon was Garcia Lopez de Cardenas, who was operating under orders of Francisco Vazquez de Coronado.  In 1869, John Wesley Powell led the first expedition down the canyon (info from Wiki).

OUTLINE OF THE THREE PARTS OF THIS MOVIE (in thirds).  About one third of the movie takes the form of reenactments of events from year 1540, and before that time.  The movie starts out by showing a dozen indigenous children scampering between red-colored boulders and fighting each other.  A bit later, the movie shows Spaniards dressed in full-regalia with metal helmets, conferring with an indigenous man.  They are in a forest of pine trees, and the indigenous man points in one direction, and the Spaniards go in the direction that direction, and the movie shows them viewing The Grand Canyon for the first time.  The middle third of the movie shows reenactments of the journey by boats by John Wesley Powell and his small team of explorers.  There is some very good footage showing the boats traveling through the aggressively churning rapids of the Colorado River.  The actor playing John Wesley Powell is missing one arm, and the narration tells us that John Wesley Powell had lost one of his arms.  The movie discloses that, at one point, the expedition lost one boat and that one of the explorers was killed.  Also, the movie discloses that at one point, the men in the expedition split in two, where one part simply disappeared into the wilderness never to be seen again, while the other part continued down the river in boats.  The last third of the movie shows present-day tourists traveling on large rubber rafts, bouncing up and down in the churning rapids, and having fun.

WEIRD PART OF MOVIE ABOUT ATTACKS BY MEN COATED IN MUD. The last third of the movie also has a weird excerpt, lasting one minute, showing a man covered in mud chasing after a girl.  The girl runs away and she runs through the water to the shore of the Colorado River, and several men (all coated with mud) rise from the muddy short of the banks of the river, and then attack the girl.  I.M.O., this one minute excerpt is really stupid, because it has nothing to do with scenery and natural beauty, nothing to do with geology, nothing to do with exploration, nothing to do with present-day activities for tourists at The Grand Canyon, and nothing to do with anything.

THE CINEMATOGRAPHY.  The cinematography is not very good.  The filming crew did not attempt to find beautiful locations for doing their filming.  Photographers with expertise in the American Southwest, and with with a good eye for great locations, great angles, and with a knowledge of the different light conditions that occur at dawn and dusk, and how to employ those light conditions to good advantage, include: (1) DAVID MUENCH; (2) RAY MANLEY; (3) JACK DYKINGA; (4) STEPHEN TRIMBLE; (5) JOHN ANNERINO, and others.  But in this movie, most of the footage is spent showing boats floating down the rushing rapids of the Colorado River, without much attention to the scenery.  In one 1-minute episode from this movie, the camera dwells on a little nameless waterfall in a little nameless gulch.  If you are expecting to see dramatic views of The Grand Canyons, where the scenery is awesome and inspiring, then you should be informed that your expectations will not likely be met.  First of all, the parts of this movie that show grand vistas, do not show them to any maximal effect. The cinematography provides images that are produced by an amateur point-and-shoot snapshot, where there is no attention to: (1) COMPOSITION AND BALANCE; (2) SCENERY THAT IS DRAMATIC AND UNUSUAL; (3) LIGHT CONDITIONS.  Second of all, most of the movie is about traveling down the river on: (1) A primitive raft; (2) On wooden boats (reenactment of the Powell expedition); and (3) Present-day rubber rafts.",1520899200,,4144,4.809590973201693
