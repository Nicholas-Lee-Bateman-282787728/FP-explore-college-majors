8222313,3,B000WC39Q8,"La Vida Segun Muriel is a film I know well. In studying Spanish, I have borrowed it from a library and watched it dozens of times. The music on it is spectacular, as is the cinematography and the story is poignant. The copy I finally bought from this vendor has less than good quality music. They offered me to return it, but I have no guarantee that after going through yet another transaction, the soundtrack will be as full as it was on every library copy that I watched.",1296000000,,474,4.337078651685394
