7751911,5,B01FVC8LN4,Love  Jari,1475539200,,10,4.0
7751912,5,B01FVC8LN4,"This is my new favorite by Jari Love. Great way to get in shape, each segment is highly effective and she works several areas. While working upper body, she will add lower body to it. She is all about success in a workout, so you make it as challenging as you want by increasing weights and adding the step, but you will get a great workout without the step too. I love the format of this dvd, the music is awesome and the workouts are easy to follow but challenging - challenging in a good way - not at all in a way that makes you want to quit from frustration or intimidation.",1469404800,5,578,4.123893805309734
7751913,5,B01FVC8LN4,"Each segment is timed and has multiple moves so the workout flies by!  I love having the option of doing an hour or breaking it up into 2-30 minute workouts or 3-20 minute workouts.  I have all of Jari's dvds and this has my favorite moves in it. Great dvd to change up my routine and include with cardio equipment to create interval workouts.  I was so glad to see a new Get Ripped dvd!!!!
UPDATE:  I still love the workout, but the dvd doesn't start all of the time. It will look like it is starting up, begin playing and then instantly stop and the screen is blank.  I tried to exchange it but had to return it. I did not get the price back that I paid. I do not understand why I was charged for the return shipping when it was purchased with my PRIME account.  I then purchased a new DVD to replace this defective one and it is doing the exact same thing.  I am now stuck with it because apparently if i return it it will end up costing me money.  Great way for Amazon to treat its customers.",1467936000,6,996,4.0717948717948715
7751914,5,B01FVC8LN4,"I purchased this DVD from a different online retailer and I love it!  Not only is there a full workout but premixes of 2 x 30 min and 3 x 20 min when you are short on time.  The music is great too!  I own several of Jari's DVDs and I like this one the best.  It is suitable from advanced beginners onwards and if you up your weights, it is also suitable for the advanced home exercisers.  The studio is brightly lit, not like the dark spaces in her previous DVDs. You need a light and a heavy set of dumbbells (she recommends 3lb and 8lb), a step for some lower body work and a mat.  No complex combos. Great job, Jari!",1467331200,3,619,3.991869918699187
8761584,3,B01FVC8LN4,Really works muscles groups but is very repetitious it gets quite boring,1495584000,,72,5.083333333333333
8761585,5,B01FVC8LN4,Fantastic workout; personally I like doing the entire workout at once but the 6-minute option is perfect for those short on time. Great exercises and instruction.,1487116800,,162,5.269230769230769
8761586,4,B01FVC8LN4,"I do like this workout, but I thought it would be a few different workouts. Instead, the 30 min workouts are just the 60 min DVD split in half. Also, parts of it the music is very loud. I prefer the music in the background so that I can hear the instructor.  Overall, the exercises are good, I just expected more variety when I saw 20 & 30 min workouts also listed.",1483142400,,365,4.069444444444445
8761587,4,B01FVC8LN4,"Good workout, decent paced, would be better if there was some cardio included as well.",1482278400,,86,4.8
8761588,2,B01FVC8LN4,"I have every Jari Love dvd she's ever made and love most of them.  I've been looking forward to a new release from her for a while and was excited when this one came out.  Some people have given it great reviews but I was extremely disappointed in it.  I did not even feel like I worked out, despite doing the entire hour.  I think the biggest difference between this and her previous  workouts is that the other ones incorporate a lot of reps so that you work the muscle to fatigue, which is what you need to do if you want to see results.  With this workout, you do a few reps, then change to another exercise well before you even begin to feel fatigued.  This might be an excellent workout for someone just beginning a life of fitness, or maybe for the occasion when you are not feeling up to par and need an easy day, but for someone used to doing Jari's previous workouts, it's not going to give you those same results or have you feeling like you really accomplished something by doing it.  I would never have paid the price it is selling for if I had known.",1480204800,10,1064,4.206896551724138
8761589,3,B01FVC8LN4,"I was so happy to see some new videos from Jari. I gave up checking for a time because it seemed she was focused on selling the on demand package which I don't need or want. I'm disappointed in this workout though.  It will be ok for easy or shorter workout days. It's not as challenging as what I love from Jari.  I look for videos where the workout portion (excluding warmup and cool down) is at least 1 hr. While I didn't time it precisely this one seems 1 hr including warmup/cool down.  Hence, expensive compared to what one gets in the other videos or Cathy Friedrich videos. Thankfully, the ab portion is a bit more challenging AND uses some new music (finally!).  I hope the Get Ripped Express that I just ordered is better.",1479686400,4,732,4.360294117647059
8761590,5,B01FVC8LN4,Great 6 min flow in between sets  - I work from home so nice to have options to get a workout in through the day.,1478563200,,113,3.52
8761591,4,B01FVC8LN4,"I think this is a great addition to your Jari Love collection. Straight weights, no cardio, and definitely more advanced. I apprecaite this as her early ones are becoming too easy for me as I get more conditioned. I am taking one star off for the AWFUL editing........a lot of segments end when Jari is either bending over to drop her weights or is saying something and has her mouth hanging open. NOT something the producers should've let slide.  Very unprofessional......come on Jari, you need to care more about how your product is presented! I am usually very lenient on editing, but this really sucks and makes me wonder if anyone at all looked at this before it was released. Her earliest videos were MUCH more professionally done. It looked like they actually cared how everything was presented. As time has gone on, Jari Love and her team have gotten very sloppy.",1478044800,,871,4.730263157894737
8761592,4,B01FVC8LN4,"I have most of Jari's dvd's, this is probably one of my favorites due to the fact that the segments seem to go by quick, the music is better than most of her other dvd's, has a brighter look and not as repetitious as others.  I love all of Jari's workouts, I was finally able to transform my body (not just lose weight) by doing her workouts.  However, I can only give this 4 stars due to the quality of the dvd, the first dvd starts playing the warm-up as soon as it loads into the player, there is no way to fix this.  The second dvd is such poor quality I can't watch it.  Unfortunately, not just with Jari but other workout videos (for example, Jillian Michaels), either the dvd's themselves are cheaply made or the editing is horrible.  They must know what they are selling to their customers, I just can't understand why they don't care to give their fans a quality product.  Or lower the price to match the low quality.",1477958400,,926,4.293103448275862
8761593,5,B01FVC8LN4,"Great workout form Jari Love. Fun, fast and never boring. Best Jari yet. A+++",1477440000,,77,4.571428571428571
