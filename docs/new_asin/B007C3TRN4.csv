8514178,4,B007C3TRN4,"I recently picked up this DVD at a used book sale.  Although I was not familiar with the instructor, Laura Tarbell, I was intrigued because the cover described it as ""intermediate advanced Pilates,"" as I'm a daily exerciser who is experienced in Pilates and generally consider myself to be high intermediate.  Furthermore, I tend to enjoy plyometric work, so overall, this workout seemed like it would be a good fit for me.

The Main Menu offers options for Introduction & Principles of Pilates - Start Workout - Chapter Selection.  In the 6.5-minute intro, Tarbell provides an overview of the workout and reviews basic Pilates principles, such as breathing and positioning of the spine.  For the workout, Tarbell is joined by two background exercisers, each of who show some modifications.  A mat and a stability ball are used, and all of the exercisers are wearing athletic shoes--necessary for the plyo work, but rather inconvenient for the Pilates matwork portions.

Tarbell begins the 5-minute warm-up on the mat.  She moves slowly through simple warm-up exercises such as knee circles, legs in and out, shoulder bridge, and arm circles; the Pilates hundred concludes the warm-up sequence.

For the main body of the workout, Tarbell alternates between plyometric moves and Pilates matwork, both with and without the stability ball.  The exercises are listed below.

*standing 2-legged jump, 30 seconds
*Pilates ab series (single leg stretch, criss-cross, double leg stretch, scissors)
*2nd set of standing 2-legged jump
*shoulder bridge, 2 sets (2nd set on toes)
*1 leg jumps, side 1
*elbow plank on ball, side 1
*1 leg jumps, side 2
*elbow plank on ball, side 2
*""plus"" jumps (R-L-center-center)
*pikes with feet on ball; keep feet on ball for planks up & down (spider push-ups)
*split jumps ending with held lunge, 2 sets
*on floor, Russian twists and v-ups
*standing speed skaters
*lying on ball (elevated bridge), several sets of ""butt blasters"" (i.e., legs apart, legs together, legs turned out)
*lunge jumps
*rollover (10 total)
*2nd set lunge jumps
*rollover to v-sit balance (10 total)
*elbow plank position for spider push-ups and ins/outs; end with push-up holds
*squat jumps
*teasers
*2nd set elbow plank series
*side lying leg lifts and leg circles with ball

Tarbell concludes the workout with a VERY QUICK stretch (1.5 minute) consisting of the shell stretch, down dog, and standing breath work.

At first, I thought that I was going to enjoy this workout, but I quickly discovered that it was definitely more ""advanced"" than ""intermediate.""  Although I thought Tarbell had a nice personality, she gives NO instruction or form pointers on how to perform the Pilates moves.  This was fine for me, as I'm very experienced with Pilates and was already familiar with the exercises.  However, Tarbell also performed the moves at an athletic, advanced level--e.g., 20 total rollovers!  That is more than I feel is necessary.  Furthermore, Tarbell does not mirror-cue, and she rarely offers suggestions for modifications (although, as noted above, her background exercisers do modify at times--in fact, it sometimes looked like they were struggling to keep up).

Overall, I do think that Tarbell did a nice job with this routine, although it could have been made even better by mirrored cuing, clearer modifications, and a longer, more thorough cool-down stretch.  This workout is definitely best suited to experienced exercisers who are already knowledgeable in the area of Pilates and who are looking for a further challenge.",1413849600,4,3539,5.1646234676007
8514179,5,B007C3TRN4,"This is a fun workout. It has its challenging spots, with the plyometric work, but its spaced inbetween with the pilates which is not as hard. It got my heart pumping. I felt my muscles working! It made me feel strong. I think the toughest part was keeping my balance on the stability ball. A ball is helpful to have but certainly not required for this DVD- you could easily use your couch, or even the floor. She works your abs, legs, arms, and butt really hard. The total video, including warm up and cool down, is 43 minutes. For me it went by pretty quickly because it was fun. She suggests ways to modify the exercises if you need to. I would definitely recommend.",1333584000,7,669,4.36
