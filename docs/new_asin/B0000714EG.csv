7973582,5,B0000714EG,"into the life of Louis Farrakhan,the controversal and often misquoted Black leader.
Aside of the assumed inclusion of footage from the Million Man March, we are treated to remarks from other activists such as the Rev. Al Sharpton and the Rev. Jesse Jackson, equally balanced with commentary from critics like Kenneth Jacobson of the anti defamation league.
Additionally, Khadijah, the wife of Farrakhan talks about the Louis Farrakhan at home, coupled with an especially moving account from daughter Maria concerning a death attempt on the family when she was a child. We learn too about his skill with the violin and admiration of a certain great violinist of Russian Jewish origin.
Of course,no reportage of Farrakhan would be complete without reference to Malcolm X. Here Louis Farrakhan speaks earnestly about his and the N.O.I alledged involement in the death of brother Malcolm.
Farrakhan's anguish at the demise of Elijah Muhammad is also highlighted as is his reconciliation with the Fard family, i.e. the wife and children of Mr. Muhammad.
The enormous respect from the hip-hop community is witnessed in a brief slot during this 45 min. dvd. Farrakhan was a major player in promoting the ethos of concerned rap.
