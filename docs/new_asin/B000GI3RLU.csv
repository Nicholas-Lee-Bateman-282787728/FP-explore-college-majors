8132455,1,B000GI3RLU,"This documentary is really bad. I was expecting some really useful information.  This documentary involves Judy Mowatt (was this suppose to pull in more people to buy this documentary, Judy Mowatt is no longer a RAS--and by opinion never was and she currently sings Gospel music), and she sings (badly) through some of the breaks in the film.  I am kin to a few Rastafarians these men and women who viewed the film with me all gave in grave reviews.  They wanted to know why a Caucasian woman was interviewing the RAS men--the men on the film were portrayed as ignorant & backwards--not all RAS men are like that & why were these Caucasian women playing drums as if there were really RAS.  Just because you lock your hair & don't wash it for a couple months does not give yourself the right to say you are RAS. Again this reiterates the theory that everything people of color do the Caucasian people absorb in order to make it there own or attempt to push it into Pop Culture in order to make a fast dollar or Euro off of it.  Amazon needs to recycle all these DVD's and make into some thing much more useful.  FIYAH BURN!!!",1238976000,7,1124,4.405797101449275
8132456,4,B000GI3RLU,All in all a great show informative and inlighting. If your a woman wanting to know abut the Rasta movement you should get this.,1167782400,6,128,4.375
