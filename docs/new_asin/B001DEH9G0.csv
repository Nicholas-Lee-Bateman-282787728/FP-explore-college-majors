3529014,5,B001DEH9G0,The kind of simple logic and easy to understand economics that are sorely missed in today's discourse! Still as meaningful today as when it was first broadcasted.,1387497600,,162,5.037037037037037
3529015,3,B001DEH9G0,"I saw the original series on PBS many years ago and have the book.  The travels on this update were ok but seemed too short and also choppy.  The discussions at the end of each chapter were excellent, allowing the speakers to make strong cases against Friedman's views and for his significant replies.

I attended U. Chicago when he was there, but did not have a class with him.

I later donated the update and the book to the public library.",1374278400,4,442,4.419753086419753
3529016,5,B001DEH9G0,"This DVD should be seen by everyone who believes in liberty, self-reliance, and free market capitalism. The ideas being showcased in this DVD will stand the test of time and will endure forever as long as men and women yearn to be free and have control over their lives without the yoke of government around their necks.",1373760000,2,320,4.631578947368421
3529017,5,B001DEH9G0,"This updated version (1990)of the 1980 pbs series does a fine job of explaining the economic theory of perhaps the most influential economist to have ever lived. When made, this documentary was showing the virtues of a market based economic system versus socialistic or communistic systems. Indeed most of the world was socialistic already or trending there quickly. Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan however took office championing the economic thoughts of Milton Friedman. The rest is history as tens of millions have been saved from poverty thanks to Friedman and Austrian economist Frederick Hayek.

This video cannot be overrated.",1369008000,4,637,5.434343434343434
3529018,5,B001DEH9G0,"The logic of ""Free to Choose"" by Milton and Rose Friedman brought me to a much better understanding of the beauty of our system over forty years ago and this DVD documentary continues to re-enforce my deeply held beliefs today. It is presented in such a manner as to provide even the least of us with a robust appreciation of the foundation at the core of this magnificent nation of ours.",1324425600,4,388,4.47887323943662
3529019,5,B001DEH9G0,"I read the book years ago but seeing the DVD was awesome.  It was great to see the original footage of the PBS special. If you are a Milton fan, you need this DVD set.",1306454400,4,167,3.7714285714285714
3529020,5,B001DEH9G0,this series offers excellent insight into the true virtues of free market capitalism.  it is well researched and well produced.  this offers a full and complete discussion of the subject matter with multiple examples of both the positives and negatives of different economic systems.  absolutely outstanding material that everyone should see.,1288828800,7,342,5.666666666666667
3529021,3,B001DEH9G0,Didn't like this whittled down version even with the updated discussion panels after each show,1254700800,35,94,5.333333333333333
3529022,5,B001DEH9G0,"This is a classic tv series by the late Milton Friedman.  It's well done, although a bit dated (it was filmed in 1990).",1240876800,10,119,4.173913043478261

8293029,5,B001DEH9G0,"One of the best non-fiction books ever written in the wide-open field of economics.  Fairly large font so the words are easy to make out, and its written in a very simple, easy-to-understand style.  I highly recommend it.",1508112000,,221,4.7894736842105265
8293030,3,B001DEH9G0,"If you're thinking about buying Milton Friedman's ""Free to Choose"" program, I recommend you skip this updated version and purchase the full 10-part 1980 version first. This 1990 revision gives you one new episode, but leaves out over half of the originals.

Let the record state, I absolutely love Milton Friedman and what he has to say. I always tell my fellow free-market minded friends that Milton Friedman is the single best person to listen to for pro-Capitalist ideals and arguments. If you aren't listening to, or haven't ever listened to Dr. Friedman, you're doing yourself a massive intellectual disservice. He states, in plain English without any political hyperbole, the best possible arguments for having a open and free society with government on the back burner as opposed to being at the forefront of the economy. ""Free to Choose"" is probably the greatest of all his works, even beating out ""Capitalism & Freedom"".

That being said.... The initial introductions don't offer much beyond celebrity lip service. Though not unwelcome, the 5 or so minutes they waste aren't worth the loss of the original content which it took the place of. The episodes are each around 45 minutes long, and it seems most of the trimming was done on the back end. The new discussion panels after each episode that replace the original 1980 panels are nowhere near as spirited. The discussions after each are shorter overall, with Milton getting **much** less speaking time compared to his opponents (even though there are far less people), and to be honest they're just not as spirited or insightful as the ones from 1980. The fact they cut out content to fit each episode into 45 minutes (down from 60 minutes), and then took another 5 for the celebrity introduction, is an absolute travesty.

IMHO, since Free to Choose Network already YouTube streams the new episode they did for the 1990 re-run introduced by Reagan, there's no reason to purchase this over the complete 1980 10-part set. The 1980 version is more expensive, but it's the *much* better one of the two. Free to Choose Network has since remastered their 1980 version DVD set, and entitled it ""Ideas for all Time"". It also now takes up 12 discs as opposed to just 5 DVD's in their original 2007 release in the red colored box.",1480982400,8,2285,4.8538461538461535

8293037,1,B001DEH9G0,"This is hilarious because although the ideas in the program is great, the production quality of these DVDs is appalling!!  The pictures are grainy, sound is so noisy, colors are faded.  I know these were produced in the 80s, but with modern remaster technology, it it not hard to make them at least watchable.  For God's sake, if given a chance, the US Postal Service probably could produce better quality DVDs.

This is certainly not the best example of free market enterprise!",1387929600,4,478,4.7926829268292686
