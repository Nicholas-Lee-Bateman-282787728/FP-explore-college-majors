6678037,3,B00NT6NGT4,"I didn't like justice league war. The voice acting was terrible for the characters. Even tho it wasn't  the classic voice of Kevin Conroy, I think Jason O'Mara did good as batman. The rest of the cast,  however, was completely horrific. So I'm glad to see the new cast for this movie. Also, I never really cared for Aquaman but that's only b/c I never bothered to learn his story. So I'm excited to see that as well.",1417996800,,416,4.32051282051282
6678038,4,B00NT6NGT4,It's not out yet... But this is based upon the new 52... Like Justice League War was and Kevin Conroy is not the voice of batman in the New 52... Deal with it and let this film stand on its merits . don't bash it because you're not happy that your guy is not in it,1417651200,8,264,3.732142857142857
6678039,1,B00NT6NGT4,"The wrong voice-actors being cast once again, for no reason at all.
Kevin Conroy was available, but wasn't chosen to voice Batman again, and that is what really hurts this movie, along with other very poor choices in casting.
I just don't get why the production staffs of these release-to-video offerings waste time making these with making no effort in wanting them to be better than mediocre at best.",1416268800,13,402,4.840579710144928
6678040,5,B00NT6NGT4,"After watching the trailer for Throne of Atlantis online, I have definitely found myself impressed with the story and the plot. Aquaman is one of the most underrated Justice League members, and I feel it's about time he got into the spotlight. The extras on this will make this worth every cent with the NYCC panel, documentary, and eclectic mix of Aquaman cartoons from various series. I am looking forward to this when it does come out January 27th.",1415059200,23,451,4.7215189873417724

6678049,4,B00NT6NGT4,"Having watched the previous version of DC Animated Films Justice League movie I had to admit my hopes were pretty low that this movie could be good at all. DC Animated had pretty much butchered Justice League Origin to make Justice League War. One thing that made me angry was that they substituted Aquaman with Shazam and while Shazam was a great character a part of me wanted Aquaman in the movie. But now that I've seen this, not only am I forgiving DC Animated for Justice League War, but applauding them for making Justice League Throne of Atlantis arc much better than the original comic book story.

Set almost immediately after the events of Justice League War, in particular the post credit scene where Orm Marius, Prince of Atlantis holds the body of his father the King of Atlantis to the surface swearing revenge. A tragic casualty of war brought upon them by Darkseid in the previous movie, its elaborated further and even more importantly tells a pretty awesome origin story for Aquaman. Make no mistake, Aquaman has always been a vital member of the Justice League since the 1960's but has had a bad reputation. Batman's been silly every once in a while, but Aquaman appears to always have been silly. The ""talking to fish,"" the loud orange and green colors and of course how naval stories can be slow and boring.

This story not only sets up Orm's seriousness as a threat to the world and for the Justice League, but also makes Aquaman into a much more belivable and serious hero. This story is well adapted from the original story but at the same time told better. Green Lantern and Shazam are involved. There is no treachery from those loyal to Arthur Curry/Aquaman, the only bad guy here is Orm, who's played superbly by Sam Witwer. Plus the tone of this movie is better than the last. No silly Michael Bay style moments and even the cast feels more suited than in the last movie.

Great movie. DCEU take notice, this is how you should make an Aquaman movie.",1518739200,2,1977,4.594900849858357

6678055,3,B00NT6NGT4,"Neat intro for Aqua-lame-man but everything else is odd. New DC comics suck. Yes, Wonder Woman bangs Superman because we said so... F&%K you DC.",1514937600,,144,4.8
6678056,3,B00NT6NGT4,"""Justice League: Throne of Atlantis"" is the sequel to ""Justice League: War"", the third DC DTV movie from the New 52-based films kickstarted by ""The Flashpoint Paradox"".  After DC rebooted their comics universe with their New 52 imprint they decided to do the same with their animated movies.  The reception has been more or less the same in both media: lukewarm but still managing to attract a lot of audience.

Regarding quality, it's generally mediocre, and this is no exception.  This is the consequence of having this new series of films being directly adapted from stories from the comics rather than merely inspired by them, and the comics are generally mediocre.  While I haven't read the comic this movie is based on, I've read other Aquaman comics from the New 52 imprint, and it's apparent that this movie doesn't do the characters any favors.

The storyline for this movie is a largely watered-down version of the Justice League episode ""The Enemy Below"".  While there's gore here where there wasn't in the animated series, characterization is far weaker, which is a bad thing, considering the basic plot (man tries to kill family to inherit the throne and do as he pleases with the kingdom) is extremely derivative.  The Justice League episode made up for that with amazing character arcs and fun action, but this movie lacks in both departments.  Most characters feel like caricatures of their originals, if not outright useless.  In fact, Aquaman pretty much feels like less than a secondary character in what's arguably his own movie.  The story also suffers from bad pacing, having most of the running time dedicated to setup and things only really starting to move along way past the halfway point, then ending abruptly.

Then there are the subplots, which are just as weak.  There's the bit about the Justice League not being sure if they're an actual team or not, which is mentioned once and never again brought up.  The same happens with Batman's reluctance to be part of the group, which last about ten seconds.  There's still the romance between Superman and Wonder Woman that no fan in history was ever invested in.  There's even an eliminated sequence seen on the extras regarding Batman's investigation on Scarecrow.  The sequence is short (less than a minute), but feels entirely pointless and it would have ruined the pacing of the film even further if included.

Speaking of extras, these are definitely the highlight of the disc.  There are a few features on DC underwater villains, a Comic Con panel, the film's score and, as usual, four included episodes from DC's cartoons, all of them associated to Aquaman, and all of them far more fun and interesting than the movie.

So, if you're a completionist, go for it when it's cheap.  Otherwise, avoid.  It does nothing new or interesting and your time is best spent watching something else.",1514332800,,2868,4.894409937888199

6678132,4,B00NT6NGT4,"Bottom line: if you ever grew up loving Aquaman but he was constantly derided as the clown(fish) prince of the seas, the not cool kid on the Justice League block, or that ""lame dude who can talk to fish"", then ""Throne of Atlantis"" is your comeuppance.  Aquaman is cool again.  He's a badass.  You don't want to mess with this dude.

""Throne of Atlantis"" follows the story of Arthur Curry who doesn't know that he's really Aquaman, but he does know he's ticked off.  When there is a coup in Atlantis he's drawn into the fray and is attacked by Oceanmaster and Black Manta, who seek to seal him off from his throne.  The Justice League gets involved as the Black Manta is helping to draw Atlantis into conflict with the surface world to aide in the coup, and the Atlantians show themselves to be fierce warriors.  While they do some initial damage the JL is just too powerful for them to tidal through and Curry/ Aquaman gets his revenge.

These new DC movies are pretty violent.  This one is certainly PG13 and not for the younger tykes.  These movies seem to be aimed at the older comic book fan and I'm fine with that but parents who think that superheroes are always do-gooders and don't get their hands dirty should put a finger of caution up to the wind.

Lastly, there's a swell of nice supplemental features as always.",1470355200,,1324,4.475

6678153,3,B00NT6NGT4,"The sequel to Justice League: War, Throne of Atlantis could have made up for the shortcomings of its predecessor by showing some character development, and the JL coming together. It mostly fails. There's too little time spent on the League working out how they intend to handle missions and who gets to call the shots. It should be a point of conflict in the film, but instead everyone just falls into just grudgingly listening to Batman right off the... well, bat.

The plot and fight scenes aren't as good as War, either. The climatic fight between Orm and Arthur is horrible. All Arthur had to do was grab the trident, then beat Orm into the ground. Instead, he pulls of such epic moves as grabbing his brother by the ankle and throwing him into tanks, just so Orm can get back up and punch him some more. And this movie revels Superman's weakness to orange ocean plastic. Seriously, no explanation for that one.

On the bright side, this movie makes Aquaman pretty awesome. The thing is, his girlfriend was way more awesome. She can form water into ice arrows and take down a bunch of guys in one move, and her design was fantastic. Why was Mera not the star? DC needs more female characters that aren't there to be the sex interest, and Aquaman's lame reputation meant most people probably wouldn't have minded the change in roster for the New 52. She could become a fan favorite like JL/JLU's Hawkgirl.",1467072000,,1409,4.609561752988048

It's a great story about someone who's life has never been complete and then learns they are heir to the throne of one of the most sacred cities ever. Alot less serious than main screen DC films, but not quite as funny as Marvel movies. It's a good mix!

6678172,3,B00NT6NGT4,"As much as I am a DC geek from long long ago, this was not a standout animated movie. Good mix of heroes & interesting Aquaman origin story, but 1) too adult & dark w/ showing various characters being killed...not to mention showing they way they're killed & 2) yet another depiction of a juvenile, whimpy, under-powered Captain Marvel. That character alone is being smeared big-time in all of DC's recent offerings, including Young Justice. This time, we watch Aquaman's evil half-brother, Orm, change Cap back to Billy Batson with his own magical lightning from an Atlantean trident? What?! Why does everyone from Wonder Woman to Orm have control of the wizard Shazam's magic, yet Billy/Cap doesn't? I'm thankful that DC is including Cap in Young Justice & all their modern offerings, but they have him all wrong. DC, tap into all of Cap's powers, don't just make him fire lightning from his hands & throw lightning balls. C'mon, he's Superman w/out the vulnerability to magic!",1463529600,,979,4.903614457831325

6678186,3,B00NT6NGT4,"As many of the latest reviews say the movie (70 mins) was OK, had some issues that made it weaker than it should have been but for me the big one, the one that blew my mind and made me start to hate it just a little (spoiler alert) was when the Atlanteans attacked Metropolis (or a big city, can't recall) to begin their war on the surface world it made ZERO sense.  First of all, they had nukes.  If you have nukes (stolen from a US submarine) you don't have to march into one town to start the war.  In fact, that's just stupid.  So, the other big thing that had me about to wretch is that the Atlanteans (using magic) create a super tidal wave to strike the city and then instead of letting the wave hit the city they stop it short to come out and fight on dry land.  WTF?  That's another horrible writer's flaw.  If they are people of the sea they should have let the wave hit the city and then fought in their element.  But nooooooo!  So, other than that I sorta liked it but JL War was far, far better.  I will forgive if the next movie in this line uses a writer who has a brain.",1462233600,,1086,4.0093023255813955

6678207,4,B00NT6NGT4,"I'm giving this DC animated film 4 stars because its the Justice League, but honestly, this is a 3 star film. I was so excited when i found out the new DC film would be about Aquaman. He is one of my favorite characters and i find his whole origin story and Atlantis to be fascinating. I couldn't help myself and i caved in and brought this. I love the JL, but than again who doesn't?

This film is beautiful looking and beautifully drawn. The character design i believe is inspired by Jim Lee's take on JL in the New 52 DC comic rebirth. Yeah, DC keeps relaunching their heroes every few years. Anyways. I love the way each character looks, but with that being said, who knew JL could be boring? This film is pretty much the definition of it. It moves at a slow pace, the dialogue isn't that interesting and it takes awhile before things finally build up and when it does, it ends to quickly. I felt there was so much that they could do and i feel DC shouldn't keep torturing themselves by thinking that a DC animated film can only be 72 mins in length. This is straight to video and they can make it 3 hours for all i care. I'd rather have a 3 hour masterpiece than something that has to be crammed in within a short amount of time.

Buy this if you are a huge JL fan, but others films such as JL Doom and the JL Flashpoint Paradox are way better.",1460073600,2,1349,4.145038167938932

From little things, like what would really happen to a pressurized submarine with a breached hull, to larger issues (like how in the world is Arthur Curry a martial arts expert when he spent his whole life in a lighthouse), this movie has problems.

6678233,5,B00NT6NGT4,"Justice League: Throne of Atlantis is AMAZING!! This film from DC gives the telling of Aquaman's origins the respect he deserves.  DC never disappoints with its direct to market animated feature films.  They have far surpassed Marvel on this front. JL:TOA is a superior standard for Justice League films.  It completely won me back to the franchise after that oddball film Justice League: Gods and Monsters.

Arthur Curry is given the origin story that leaves no doubt as to why he is King of the Seven Seas.  The team behind this film really knocked it out of the park.  I don't want to give away any spoilers here.  However, I will say that if you rent it or buy it, you will NOT be disappointed.  JL:TOA watches like a big budget feature film.  If DC could take the brilliance of this film and translate it into a live-action property, they could match or even conquer the success of Marvel.  (Also, they would have to stop letting Zak Snyder butt-hump iconic DC properties.  Remember Man of Steel?)

At any rate, Justice League: Throne of Atlantis is 5 stars from me.  It is hands down one of the BEST Justice League films DC has ever produced.",1455667200,,1148,4.568627450980392

6678307,5,B00NT6NGT4,"JUSTICE LEAGUE: THRONE OF ATLANTIS is an excellent adaptation of the graphic novel collection by Geoff Johns, Paul Pelletier and Ivan Reis. It also demonstrates why Aquaman deserves his own live-action movie. The hero who was the butt of jokes for two generation finally comes into his own in this story. As always with DC Entertainment animation, everything from animation to voice acting to musical score are first-rate. The bonus features are informative and the four cartoons from the DC Vault complement the feature attraction.
  THRONE OF ATLANTIS is both an adventure story and an origin. The latter is extremely difficult to do successfully, but this version of Aquaman's story never drags or gets bogged down in unnecessary trivia. This is a movie that moves. It has the usual PG-13 rating for comic book violence and a few mild vulgarities, but younger children who understand the difference between reality and fantasy can watch it without having their little psyches scarred.",1441929600,,987,5.1625

I wasn't crazy about Wonder Woman or Superman's costumes, but Batman, Aquaman and The Flash looked fantastic! The story is a nice look at how Arthur Curry becomes Aquaman. Excellent action is sprinkled throughout the film to make the animated movie enjoyable and fun to watch. I still have a problem with animated characters using profanity. For one, it just look odd to see cartoon character use the language, but mostly because it adds nothing to the structure of the dialogue.",1440460800,,548,4.967391304347826

It seems to me that they could do more for the money we pay for these things. There are some interesting extras, but I feel like the feature needs to be more complete. If it were longer, then the story would be more complete and I would have given it more stars. It is a Justice League story, so we do get Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman and the rest. I do like it, it is totally worth seeing, but I wasn't excited about owning it. I actually watched mine and then sold it on Amazon.",1440460800,,649,4.078125

This really shows us a new take on Aqua Man's history and how he came into being.  It also has a pretty cool villain and the fight scenes are terrific and loads of fun to watch!

6678333,5,B00NT6NGT4,DC rules animated hero movies.,1439942400,,30,5.2
6678334,3,B00NT6NGT4,"The second Justice League title in DC's New 52-based movie series, ""Throne of Atlantis"" is a sequel to ""Justice League: War,"" which was based on the comic ""Justice League: Origins."" In the ""Origins"" comic, Aquaman stood on equal ground with the rest of the Justice League, but the ""War"" movie adaptation replaced him with Shazam. I was hesitant of this decision at first, but ""Throne of Atlantis"" makes DC's reasoning behind the decision clear, and for the most part I can appreciate the effort. ""Throne of Atlantis"" essentially combines the first three Aquaman stories of the New 52 into a single animated adventure, mixing Aquaman's origins, his battle against the cannibalistic ""Trench"" monsters and arch-enemy Black Manta, and the epic titular ""Throne of Atlantis"" Justice League story. The results are mixed; the production values were disappointing for a DCUAOM, with some subpar voice dubbing here and there as well as several instances of lazy animation (the anticlimactic finale with obviously empty cities and copy-pasted soldiers comes to mind). I also do not approve of how they treated Orm's character in the story, removing the sympathetic nuances and patriotic innocence of the New 52 version of the character in favor of his stupidly evil, mustache-twirling, badly dressed 70's counterpart, as well as ruining the ""whodunnit"" mystery of the original. However, I will give the movie credit in that most of the original ""Throne"" story has been captured well, and the compression/rewriting of Aquaman's origin is flawlessly integrated as well. Overall, this movie was a surprise; it succeeded where I feared it would fail, but fell short when excellence seemed a given.",1439942400,,1682,5.233333333333333
6678335,5,B00NT6NGT4,"A great chapter in the DC  legends. A nicely explained origin story with lots of good cinematic moments. It was less like a comic book movie and more like an animated thriller. I will offer no info on what characters did, how they react to each other, their circumstances, etc. Those type of spoilers would just ruin it for you. If you have ever read a good, like the ones by Grant Morrison, or Len Wein. It's like watching something like that come to life.",1439942400,,457,4.376470588235295
6678336,1,B00NT6NGT4,"Despite Justice League War being utter garbage, I was foolishly excited for Throne of Atlantis. Alas, just like its predecessor, it falls far short of greatness. The voice actors awkwardly force poorly written dialogue, the amazing moments and plot from the novel are noticeably absent, and (worst of all) Shazaam is once again along for the ride (despite him not being in the novel for good reason).

Don't watch this, read the book. The novel by Geoff Johns is an instant classic; the animated film is an insult to all fans of comic books.",1439856000,,541,4.75531914893617

6678363,4,B00NT6NGT4,"Justice League Throne of Atlantis was a pleasant surprise. It was much more enjoyable than the movie Justice League War which preceded it, both in chronology and continuity.

I believe the element that put this movie over the top was how likable Arthur Curry was--I know that a superhuman who is knife proof and talks to fishes shouldn't be all the relatable, but he was. Once he got his head around his origin and fate, he plowed forward with determination.

Once again, the Green Lantern provided much of the more ironic humor, and Shazam the immature humor. I don't say this in condemnation, because Shazam is a teenager in an adult's body, so he should be a little immature.

Not a lot can be said about the animation--it was top notch as usual. The only time in recent memory that I didn't care for the design style of a DC animated movie was in the Flashpoint Paradox, and that was because it was too much like anime.

Nowhere near as good as the first --- Arthur is a nice guy and not the angry man portrayed in other recent renditions.  Unfortunately, he also comes across as somewhat weak and lacking the charisma a king could probably use --- the romance with Meara is also weak.  Although I never cared much for Steve and not at all for Lois (who is a big B in every story rendition I've ever seen), can't say I'm a fan of the supes-ww romance here either --- this storyline seems to have cornered the market in awkward, stilted romances.  Strangely, the bats/supes pairing is still somehow a successful duo --- maybe to do with the normal/nice guy and tortured/jerk dynamic.  Cyborg, Lantern, and Flash have distinct personalities and add some humor to the story.

6678387,5,B00NT6NGT4,"Since Bruce Timm and DC initiated the Animated Direct to DVD movies, most often based on graphic novels, they have been a mixed bag. Some being superb, some just bad. Usually the ones without Timm's name attached are the ones I have found to be the worst.
Fans of the animated Batman series have just one wish: Kevin Conroy to be the only one to voice Batman. Andrea Romano is awesome at her job. She finds the best voices for the parts, hitting home runs over 90% of the time. Even some of the others who have voiced Batman have been good. Just not Conroy. And generally, going Conway will be the right way to go. Never-the-less, this was not a horrible voiced Batman; although, his part is not large enough to really worry about.

As the modern age of comics continues to find new ways to connect heroes, this was not horrible. And, fortunately, this film, and for us, there seems to be a little continuity, in that the JL finally knows each other, and is not totally against each other.

The story is good, animation good, but, as usual, not perfect. One thing that bothers me is that parents will have to decide whether this is age appropriate for their kids, as there is a bit more use of the stronger swearing.",1435449600,,1216,4.424107142857143

I see the progression of the movies from Justice League War through this; introducing and building the characters. The super-powered ones still don't quite like The Batman but, they are keenly aware that he is more than just some guy in a bat suit.
I like the grittier nature of this movie (no more Superfriends). I wish they would have Green Lantern as more than a wise cracking mid-level semi-super being; he gets his butt handed to him way too easily.
I can't exactly put my finger on what I didn't care for in this one but, it just didn't have the action I looked forward to seeing. Seemed to be over too easily.

6678394,2,B00NT6NGT4,"If any DC animated film embraces mediocrity, it is this one.  A mixed bag of horrible animation, horrible writing, corny dead dialogue, and yet a few really fun ideas and adult action sequences.  The fun ideas, however, are glossed over.  The plot is rushed and childish, very cliche.  Motivations are not explained well.  The heroes are more set pieces than they are essential parts of the story.  Characters jump to conclusions and accept nonsensical changes with alacrity--as if it's perfectly normal to be able to breathe under water all of a sudden, so Arthur talks about another subject!

This movie looks like a biracial Japanese anime child.  The animation is really stiff, childish, and OLD looking.

The voice acting is a mixed bag too.  Two or three heroes are acted perfectly and the rest sound like cardboard come to life.

The action is choreographed well.  There is blood.  There is death.  There is a lot fun power vs. power action.

It's just a shame the writing and animation are so terrible.

I think today's new audience is much more interested in the technical and intellectual aspect of heroes these days. I think personal tragedy is what drives people to superhero movies. The motivation is already there for audiences to blame and seek a good butt kicking. Honestly, the audience could use a dosage of what makes people do evil things. More time needs to be taken to show how evil is developed and more of a struggle for the hero to wrestle with the situation to deal with the evil appropriately.

6678425,4,B00NT6NGT4,"Meant to be a follow up to Justice League: War, this was based on the crossover event between the New 52 incarnations of Justice League and Aquaman comics. Where as in War, Aquaman was replaced by Shazam, this animated movie acts as an intro of Aquaman into the League, and his origin story, making it the first time outside of a few failed TV pilots that the character's backstory has even been fully fleshed out. Directed by Ethan Spaulding, who worked on the fantastic Thundercats reboot, this production features most of the cast from War, but Nathan Fillion makes a grand comeback as Green Lantern.

 Set some months after Darkseid's invasion of Earth, the Justice League is called in to investigate an attack on a navy submarine in one of the deepest areas in the Atlantic Ocean. At the same time, a young lighthouse keeper named Arthur Curry is grieving over the loss of his recently departed father, when he's suddenly attacked by assassins from Atlantis, the mythical underwater city from where Arthur's mother, Queen Atlanna, who sent her agent Mera to watch over him. Mera rescues Arthur from the assassins, and brings him to an underwater safehouse. The Atlantean assassins were sent by Prince Orm, Arthur's younger half-brother who feels more entitled to the ""throne of Atlantis"" since he's fully Atlantean. Orm teams up with the scavenger known as Black Manta who acts as Atlantis' rep to the surface world, and the two of them plot to assassinate Atlanna and make it look like humanity attacked Atlantis. After Arthur learns about his mother, he meets up with the Justice League and heads to Atlantis, only to find Atlanna is dead, to which Orm proudly confesses to. He uses a magical royal trident to take down Arthur, Mera, and half of the League(including Superman and Wonder Woman who can somehow breathe underwater), then leaves them to be eaten by a giant Cthulu-type sea monster. The League gets free and Superman uppercuts Cthulu, while Orm leads an Atlantean army to Metrolpolis. While he easily could've just flooded the city(like he did in the comics)Orm has his laser-toting troops invade with the Justice League surprisingly all getting floored by him. Arthur quickly subdues Black Manta via a scene strait out of Deep Blue Sea, he however also succumbs to Orm's power. But Cyborg uses his recording of Orm's confession of killing his own mother, which makes the Atlantean forces switch sides to accepting Arthur as their true king. After assuming the throne, Arthur joins the League and is given the name ""Aquaman"" since it was such a hit online. The movie ends with a teaser for the next film of Lex Luthor meeting up with Orm in prison, possibly to start his own Legion of Doom.

Throne Of Atlantis works as a pretty good Justice League movie as you see the team come together more, although more emphasis was shown on Aquaman's origin, as well as Cyborg's adjustment to life as being half-machine. There's some slightly thrown in subplots involving Superman and Wonder Woman beginning a romance, plus a deleted scene with Nightwing and Robin(Damian Wayne)which leads into Batman Vs. Robin. The quality in production is slightly better since War, plus the fight choreography got a serious boosting. It's a little hard to see one on its own without having check out War before this, but not totally necessary to enjoy it.",1432166400,,3351,4.875438596491228

The idea of two heirs - one peaceful, one warlike - vying for the throne of a peaceful monarch has been done many times.  The way the warmonger brings about his designs is also too familiar.  Although it is intelligent in parts, the powers of Aquaman and the other Atlanteans are never clearly established, and thus some of the key fights feel like ex machinas.

6678442,4,B00NT6NGT4,"I wasn't sure I would like the New 52 based animated previous movie: JL War but it surprised me by truly showing how these super powered people (as well as a master strategist that is at peak human levels) would get along after first meeting. This is continued in Throne of Atlantis as Arthur Curry is trying to make sense of his life after the death of his father. The rest of the Justice League are trying to cope with the world expecting them to work together (which doesn't happen well yet) as each of the members has such different ways/methods of dealing with crime and threats.
The story was good and got me rather interested in Aquaman. The one thing that seemed to throw me of is the voice cat changed from the last one for some members (I believe, I could be wrong) but overall the voice change is for the better. Whether the actors found better ways to embody their characters or they got some new actors I found it a little distracting but for the better.",1430870400,,967,4.377777777777778

6678444,2,B00NT6NGT4,"Let me begin this review by saying I LOVED Justice League: War. I thought it was excellent, brutal, and really set it apart as a set of movies to be taken seriously in this Marvel dominated world. Justice League: Throne of Atlantis has all the same characters, a few cool Easter eggs (Steel anyone?), but overall, the plot and villains were just weak. I love the new spin on these old characters. Wonder Woman is a favorite of mine, as is this less boy scouty Superman. Batman, as is usual in DC Animated movies, steals the show. His line in regards to a tidal wave that's about to inflict heavy casualties is especially chilling to hear.

I wanted to like this movie. I wanted to LOVE this movie. But it was just a let down in too many ways for me to recommend to anyone. It's too much of a disappointment for fans of the DC Universe, and it's too brutal for younger fans. Seriously, unless you want your kids seeing people ripped apart and chopped in half with plenty of blood, this is one you should pass on.",1430697600,,1011,4.349206349206349

I admit I haven't watched all of these toons, so I might have missed a plot point or two. I am like Homer Simpson on this Justice League, why can't Superman handle everything, why do we need all these other guys? My feelings aside, the writers do a good job in at least feigning a need for multiple heroes. I want to point out that people on submarines do not carry sidearms. Seriously? Who are they going to shoot 400 feet below the surface? There were numerous misconceptions about subs the film incorporates, too many to mention. This appears to be a filler film in the series.

6678457,2,B00NT6NGT4,"There's been roughly 24 DCAU films depending on how you count.  The steam has been running out since Flashpoint but the last few have been exceptionally dull.  This plays like a movie made by bored people.  Like watching a movie made by robots.  Nothing stands outs.  No single scene is memorable.  The characters all act like they don't care, the story unfolds because it has to, and even the villains are villains just because the plot demands them to be.

Despite being new teammates everyone falls into place with almost zero growing pains.  The laziness of the whole thing is summed up in the scene where Aquaman meets the Justice League for the first time.  They come out of nowhere and start helping him in battle.  After they all start talking like they know one another.  Not a single question is asked about who they are, where they came from, or why they're helping Aquaman.  Like the story couldn't be bothered to make him care.

It's depressing really.  I used to really look forward to these but the last few have killed my enthusiasm.  This one was written and directed by some unfamiliar names so I hope the upcoming Bruce Timm film rekindles my excitement.

""Throne of Atlantis"" is the orgin story of houw Arthur Curry became Aquaman.  At first the action centers around the newly members of the Justice League who aren't quite too keen on the idea of working together as a team.  The romance between Clark and Diana heats up with Clark showing Diana how he disquises himself with a simple pair of glasses and change of hair style - a tatic Diana adopts when she and Clark go out on a date that gets interuppted by Lois Lane - who tells Clark that he is dating way out of his league - Diana introduces herself to Lois as Diana Prince - Cyborg meanwhile doesn't seem to get that his doctor has a mega huge crush on him and he goes off to investigate a mysterious submarine disapperance.  Meanwhile, Arthur is grieving the death of his father and quickly stumbles upon a distrubing fact or two - not only is he the son of the Queen of Atlantis - who just happened to have an illicit affair with his father and left soon after he was born - but he has a half brother who wants to kill him, and oh yes, wage war on humanity and destory all land dwellers.
Very intense action as Arthur comes into his own as a hero to bridge both worlds.

6678471,3,B00NT6NGT4,"**Spoilers**  I'm a huge fan of the DC anime that has come out in recent years but this one has some pretty lazy story telling.  The main villain beats down the entire Justice League including Superman, Green Lantern, Wonder Woman and Shazam. Really?  One guy?  Then the same villain is taken down single-handedly by a rookie Aquaman?  LAZY!  Writers make these heroes great but then loose fights they shouldn't.  Green Lantern is the biggest victim of this.  Have you seen this pattern:  Danger comes,  Green Lantern creates a shield to hide behind, it's not strong enough, he gets knocked out.  Over.  And over.  And over again. They will talk up the Power Ring as ""The most powerful weapon in the universe"" yet gets thwarted all the time on Earth alone when he's supposed to be able protect a section of the Galaxy.

6678472,3,B00NT6NGT4,"I'm a big fan of Aquaman, really enjoy the New 52 series, particularly the Geoff John's run that this movie ostensibly borrows from. I'm ok with the separate canon of this movie from the comic--though Dr. Shin's role was too different for my preference, to put it mildly. It is unfortunate that this film didn't take the right cues from the John's no-BS, ass-kicking Aquaman. When Justice League War excluded Aquaman in favor of Shazam I was disappointed until I learned it was an effort to pave the way for this project. I thought, ""Great, they're going to capitalize on the dramatic reinvention of one of comics' most underrated heroes."" Instead it seems like they read through some comics real quick, then merged that with some tween humor, and said ""Greenlight this ho, let's make some money off nerds!""

It's a shame this movie is yet another Aquaman iteration that must be tactfully defended by Aquaman apologists. It's not terrible, but it lacks cohesion, it's a little too campy because of laziness--like the creators just threw together some general knowledge of the comic and half-assed a movie from there, because they knew (and they were right) that comic fans would still watch. That's a bit dramatic--I'm sure they wanted to make a good movie--but it's sometimes a little too wink-at-the-audience-and-do-comic-book-things. There are some real bright spots among the DC animated movies and I'll keep watching them and paying for them (even if only to rent) because I love DC stories.",1429315200,2,1496,4.984

I think it's great that DC wants the DCAU to match more closely to their comics so as to pull fans that have not yet read the comics, upon which these are based, to do so! However, if they intend to draw new fans, those new fans will be in a shock if they ever read the current Aquaman and Justice League titles as this movie is way-off the mark for several major plot-points or even background!

On it's own, the movie is jumbled, confused, and as other reviews attest, the characters are never developed...ever.

Don't waste your money, the animation is uneven (huge neck muscles; weirdly thick/crooked legs/hips; etc.), the voice-acting is God-awful and often does not suit the scene, not does it line-up with the mouths at all, and there's hardly a story yet each character jumps through weird decisions without notice or a seemingly-reasonable motive",1429056000,4,866,4.798657718120805

As far as plot goes, seeing Aquaman in the story was great! The most annoying aspect was the relationship between Superman and Wonder Woman came across as more of a familial, brother sister relationship which made the kiss scene... Uncomfortable to say the least. I've personally preferred when they sought relationships with humans, as it implied that despite being super powered gods, humanity had something the gods did not. However, I'm well aware that the comics and DC at large seems to disagree with this view. Again, don't get the movie expecting the comics or a compelling story, the writing wasn't great like Flashpoint, but it wasn't terrible either.",1427587200,,798,4.748201438848921

I dunno.  Guess I was just expecting more.  A decent story.  And yes, they finally give Aquaman his long deserved due.
But I question why the publishers fell the need to have foul language in a cartoon for all ages.
And the movie feels more like an episode than a featured movie.
As a JLA fan since I was a kid, I think you will like it if your a fan.  Just don't watch the previews.  It basically tells the whole story and when you watch the movie you feel like your just watching filler.",1427587200,,508,4.090909090909091

This movie had potential. DC cut corners. they recycled animation from Justice League War and Justice League the Flash Point Paradox. This movie felt rush. This movie had great pieces that were not put together so well. Aquaman starts out in the dumps and then all of sudden stops being in the dumps. The Animation was Great. I like Kevin Conroys Voice as Batman so much better.  I feel that hurts all the movies after Flashpoint except Assault on Arkam where surprise Kevin Conroy is batman. Jay Olvia or Bruce Timm Should return to edit and direct the movies because even with a good story, it not as good as it should have been. This DC movie is Missing the Attention to Detail, that most of Animated movies have that make them great. This one is good I still bought my 2 copies. It is painfully obvious how it could have been better. if the sections of the movie at least felt like it flowed instead of just moving on would have been a start. this movie should have been longer or done in 2 parts.

Often feels like it was directed by a middle school student.
I say this even giving all due credit to the material on which it is based, namely comic books and cartoons. I understand that it lends itself to having a certain degree of tolerance when it comes to comic book cheese moments or instances where you just can't take it seriously. I can deal with cheesy dialogue and half baked subplots(literally ""sub"" plot) but some things just the result of bad production decisions.

I will describe one of several questionable moments, but first, if you consider the appearance of a giant tidal wave in this story a plot spoiler, I apologize, this review was probably not for you anyway. Now that we have that taken care of, the scene is where Metropolis is about to get destroyed by a giant tidal wave. So what does the city do? Well, the next scene is of solders, presumedly the national guard or some such entity showing up on scene, and proceeding to point their rifles at the oncoming wave... I know I shouldn't take it so seriously, but even in my best attempt at not thinking, I can't understand why someone would decide this was a reasonable response to a giant tidal wave.",1426464000,,1265,4.597345132743363

The element of this film that made it better than previous Justice League movies was Atlantis.  The creators did a superb job tying the Justice League and the surface world to the lost city.  Throughout the entire movie, I was primarily concerned with Atlantis, Aquaman and the Atlanteans that changed Aquaman's life.  I was disappointed that Batman had so little involvement.  That being said, Aquaman's presence throughout the movie more than made up for it.  I would highly recommend this movie to Aquaman, New 52 and Pre 52 DC Comics fans.",1425772800,,686,4.811965811965812

I never read the comics involved but these animated movies involving the Justice league new 52 are just not as good as the ones before.  This was about as good as the last one, but frankly I find matricide a little hard to swallow in what are essentially children's animated superhero cartoons, whatever the so called production team's vision is apparently working towards.  Why it was neither as inappropriate as Flash Point Paradox nor as good as War, it was nice to see Aquaman get some major screen time.  While I am pleased to see that they have toned down Wonder Woman's bratty behavior, are we going to be imposed upon in the future with Superman and Wonder Woman making out?  Because that certainly seems to be where this new creative team is going.  While this doesn't deserve an R rating by any means, since these are mostly watched by children (regardless of whatever audience the production team thinks they are aiming for), I think that DC Comics and especially Warner Brothers needs to take a harder look at what these movies are promoting and whatever agenda the production team has in mind.

6678607,1,B00NT6NGT4,"This movie missed on so many levels it left me shaking my head as to ""what were the writers thinking?"". This movie attempts to make sense of Aquaman's place as a hybrid undersea monarch and land dwelling hero. His power mad half brother who becomes ""Ocean Master"" secretly slays their mother, the queen of Atlantis and leads an army into Metropolis to attack the surface dwellers who have been wrongly blamed for her death, courtesy of Black Manta. How any Atlantean would believe Manta, a wetsuit wearing surface dwelller himself only scratches the surface of this sloppy writing and ridiculously silly outcome that this movie reaches. Miscasting abounds, as we are treated to Flash being a serious guy (?!?!) and Green Lantern being the goofy chick chasing knucklehead that Flash has usually been potrayed as for quite a while. Batman's Gotham problems pale in comparison to an undersea invasion and the concept of Superman and Wonder Woman being a couple which could make for a fantastic story in itself is completely wasted here as a mere background happening. Cyborg is relegated to dealing with his gimmicky suit's weaknesses and his own emotions has him coming off as weak and ineffective. There is a lot of silliness as ""Ocean Master"" easily takes down the ENTIRE JLA in his attack and has them all thrown into cocoon-like pods to be fed to a giant undersea squid-like creature with only has ""fancy salad fork"" just adds to the bad taste that this movie left on me. My favorite characters deserved so much better than this, especially Manta and Aquaman himself. DC dropped the ball on this one, pure and simple. Thumbs DOWN.",1425600000,,1632,4.853046594982079
6678608,3,B00NT6NGT4,"Sadly, ever since they started these New 52 movies I've been growing less and less impressed with them.  The strength of the DC animated movies was always in the rapport the heroes had with each other, which as been completely lost in their desire to mimic the Avengers and have a team in constant conflict with itself.  The problem as I see it is that for the Avengers this works because the individual characterization for each of the heroes is top notch and almost equal to the size of their egos.  We know that Tony Stark always considers himself to be the smartest man in the room.  We know that Captain America's hackles get raised by anyone who tries to go after people weaker than them, no matter how slight.  We know that Bruce Banner is terrified that the chaos generated by the other team members around him is turning him into a ticking time bomb.  And because we know all of this it is possible for us to see all the conflict between them and still view them as heroic figures.  In fact it even helps, because the kind of arguments they get into ultimately serve to inform us of their character.
Take away all the character building though, and you get stuck with what we currently have with the Justice League.  The arguments between characters do not inform the audience, nor do they reveal anything about the character.  They simply make the characters look childish and petty.  This was far better than Justice League War for me, but it's still coming up very much short of the high quality work I'd come to expect from these.  Hal Jordan is still being written like an oversexed frat boy, which undermines the entire thesis of his character (being ""the man without fear"") by making it seem like he's constantly overcompensating for being afraid of everything.  Wonder Woman remains ridiculously bloodthirsty, though at the very least they didn't seem as determined to draw attention to it as they were last time.  Superman continues to feel bland and soulless, at times more avenging angel than shining example, and Shazam is almost too childlike for belief.  Superman and Wonder Woman's relationship, which seems to be built entirely on a foundation of feeling they are just too good for everyone else around them, is equal parts patronizing and boring.  Neither character has been presented as being any more than a cardboard cutout with superpowers - and the fact that they'd form a relationship based solely on matching power sets demonstrates exactly how little interest DC editorial has in fleshing them out.  Superman doesn't even seem to view himself as Clark Kent anymore.
That said, there's a lot of stuff that this film does get right which War did not.  Nathan Fillion, for one, brings his trademark infectious charm to Hal Jordan which softens the writing considerably, taking a character who was completely insufferable and giving him a more lighthearted comedic cadence which almost makes you believe that when Hal says something horrible he's simply trying his best to make a joke and no one has the heart to tell him how flat it's falling.  While Shazam's character is at times confusing, he's also got a great talent for stealing every scene he's in.  The Flash feels spot on, even if he does somehow manage to get himself tripped.  And there's just a hint of a budding friendship between Batman and Superman which gives us the first moment that this Superman has actually managed to feel like he could be fun.  Even Wonder Woman, who went from being a favorite character to one of my least in the reboot, had some moments where I could almost start liking her again.  And Victor Stone, while still at times cheesy and a little too blunt in trying to establish his feelings and motivations, still feels like he was lifted from a much better written series.
I really do hope this is a sign that DC is starting to get their act together in regards to this reboot.  If the next one is able to dispense with the cheap gags and the forced romance subplot and actually let us get to know these new characters (and make no mistake, these are new characters, not the ones we've seen in the other movies) then I think it should be possible for the films to level out somewhere near their former level.  If not, I'm not sure how much longer I'll be willing to let DC try to convince me that I should really feel something for Superman and Wonder Woman.",1425513600,2,4378,4.648508430609598

If you like ""consistency"" or depth in your story, you will be disappointed.

So many problems with power levels, everything seemed rushed.  It was as if it were written by someone completely different than the WAR crew.
Aquaman had almost 0 depth at all.  I did have high hopes after FlashPoint, Under the Red Hood and War. This was no where near the same quality as any of those.

It seems like the JLU was an afterthought and probably should have been, so they could have fleshed out the Underwater characters better.

There was 0 realism, 0 consistency and honestly should have been 30-45 minutes longer to properly tell this story.  It's a must watch if you liked war, but mainly don't get your hopes too high.. It's just piss poor in comparison.

6678623,1,B00NT6NGT4,"I have to agree with some of the other reviewers on this one. I was looking forward to at least being entertained, but found it to be poorly written in story and character development.  None of the characters in this movie are very likable, even Batman, who is the coolest character in the DC Universe. There's a scene in it where Batman and Superman pair up for part of the investigation. Batman is lecturing Superman when Superman reminds him that he is an investigative reporter. Batman dismisses it by saying ""Journalism is dead."" Pretty dickish, even for Batman. I'm only slightly familiar with the New 52 stuff as a I don't read comics anymore, but if this movie is an accurate representation of what they have done with it, I question the direction DC has taken with their revamps.

6678629,4,B00NT6NGT4,"I actually enjoyed this much more than I expected to.  Aurthur Curry, or Aquaman is such an underrated character in the DCU.  The only reason why I couldn't rate this 5 stars is because of the following; 1. I'm still not used to the whole ""New 52"" thing.  2. I feel like it was too short.  These films should be pushing at least 90 minutes.  3.  I really wish they would keep the original voice actors instead of having to have people pinch hit for the voices we're used to.

Anyway, while some other reviewers gave this film a low review for language and blood, I LOVE it.  P.S. to those who didn't like that their kids heard a few bad words, maybe you should be paying more attention to the fact it was rated PG-13 before letting your 6 year old watch things?",1425168000,,761,4.236111111111111
6678630,4,B00NT6NGT4,"Theres been a disturbing trend with the DC Animated films lately. After years of stellar animated films from DC they have been slipping up lately. Justice League: WAR was average at best and Batman & Son was borderline AWFUL. The good news is this is FAR better than Batman & Son and slightly better than Justice League: WAR.

This is basically an Aquaman movie with the other Justice League characters playing supporting roles. At times the movie can drag a little but in the end its one of the better films DC has put out recently. Unlike Batman & Son they do justice to the comic book source material without cannibalizing the story or making a train wreck that barely resembles the original story. Its great to see Aquaman finally getting some attention and respect since he came an unnecessary punchline in recent years. I don't know where the whole ""his only power is he talks to fish!!"" insult came from.

If you're a fan of Aquaman, Justice League or Animated action in general you will enjoy this. The only glaring negative I can think of is the voice actor who plays Batman. Jason O'mara has got to go in my opinion. His work here is better than Justice League: WAR and Batman & Son but thats not saying much. Its like hes sedated or something! Its almost like hes trying to talk in a whisper but hes so monotone and emotionless that it gets grinding after awhile.

Also there is an after the credits scene that I'm assuming sets up the next film in the series. Hopefully this is the beginning of an upward trend for the DC Animated films and they return to their past glory.",1425168000,,1585,4.496527777777778

This guy not only has the ability to communicate with the fishes but he also has powers similar to Percy Jackson. Even in DC comics, he was described as a follower of Poseiden, The Lord of The Seas. And his relation to Wonder Woman has people buzzing too, because Mount Olympus and the city of Atlantis have both been visited by Aries, the god of war. (A well-known enemy who once tried to turn their worlds against each other.)

A good way to reintroduce a valuable member of the team. And let's face it: guys, like Flash and Green Arrow can only do so much in ""wet"" situations so they could definitely use THIS DUDE as a helping hand.",1425081600,,784,4.25503355704698

6678654,2,B00NT6NGT4,"In the immortal words of Doctor Raj Koothrappali, Aquaman Sucks!  Justice League: Throne of Atlantis is the latest DC Comics animated production to hit home video.  It seems that Warner Bros. is alternating the releases between classic DC storylines like Batman and Son and New 52 storylines.  This story adapts the Throne of Atlantis storyline from the pages of both Aquaman and Justice League from 2012 -2013, and written by Geoff Johns.

An American sub is sunk in the Atlantic by unknown invaders, killing all aboard.  Cyborg investigates the wreckage and discovers its missiles have been stolen.  As of yet there is no official Justice League but that doesnt stop Cyborg from seeking the aid of Superman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, The Flash, Shazam, and Batman.  Their investigations lead them to the conclusion that the sub was attacked by Atlantis.  Black Manta, in cahoots with Ocean Master (Aquamans half-brother) launches an attack on Atlantis that is blamed on humans.  While Ocean Master tries to stir up trouble and push his people to war, Mera locates Arthur Curry, aka Aquaman, and reveals his heritage as half-Atlantean and of royal blood.  Ocean Master kills Queen Atlanna and takes over rule of Atlantis, launching a war against the surface world.  As the forces of Atlantis attack Metropolis, Ocean Master manages to defeat the most powerful members of the Justice League including Shazam, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, and Superman. We are left to rely on Aquaman to save the world.  Yay!

Its not that Justice League: Throne of Atlantis is bad, but it does have two things working against it.  First it features Aquaman as the main character.  Aquaman has always impressed me as the Antman/Giant-Man/Goliath/Yellow Jacket of the DCU, only not nearly as cool.  Hes a career 2nd stringer despite repeated attempts to reboot him over the years.  Secondly, this is simply not a storyline that warranted being adapted into an animated film.  This might have worked as a two or three part episode of the old Justice League animated TV show but it doesnt have the kind of epic storyline that deserves being put on film.  I meanBlack Manta and Ocean Master as your two antagonists?  Ooooohhhscary.

If that wasn't underwhelming enough we are getting the NEW 52 versions of the characters so we have a Superman who lusts after Wonder Woman; a Shazam who is a punk juvenile delinquent; and a Green Lantern who is simply an A-hole.  Oddly enough although he may be the least important member of the Justice League, the character of Arthur Curry comes off as the strongest, or at least the noblest.  In one scene he gets into a fight with a bunch of guys at a restaurant when they want to order lobster.

The voice cast is mainly the same group from Justice League: War with Jason O'Mara, Christopher Gorham, Sean Astin, Shemar Moore, Steven Blum, and George Newbern all reprising their roles from that film.  Thankfully Nathan Fillion is back as Green Lantern so even though the character is written as a jerk, at least hes a lovable jerk.  The animation is solid and the same as seen in Justice League: War.  I guess DC is feeling the need to push the New 52 in their animated projects as well as the comics but there are hundreds of storylines that are better and better suited for animation than Throne of Atlantis.

6678672,4,B00NT6NGT4,"For the record, I'm really enjoying the animated features that are being released that center around the New 52 series.
Honestly, I enjoy the comics and I enjoyed this feature much more than I thought it would.
The dialogue is an upgrade compared to War, to be honest. War's dialogue wasn't altogether terrible, don't get me wrong, but there were certain points that were definitely cringe-worthy (SM: ""You're strong."" WW: ""I know."" complete with goo-goo eyes. Blegh, gag me). The dialogue in this one seemed a bit quicker and less plodding than it did in War, thankfully.
There are quite a few things that were left out from the comics, obviously, to save space. Some of it works and some of it doesn't (ie - Steve has been relegated to a very basic plot point. At least in the comics, we got to see some of his family and the effects of the Justice League's success on him. We get none of that here). Character development was a little bit underdone - I think DC was banking on the fact that its fans were familiar with the main JL characters already. However, this movie does focus a lot on Cyborg and Aquaman, who barely get focused on normally (apart from Cyborg's backstory in War) so that was a nice break from routine.
Random sidenote, I will say the relationship between WW and Supes initially felt very rushed to me in this feature... The midair kiss in the beginning seemed shoehorned into the plot. But that could be just me.

Anyway, I enjoyed this for what it was. It's a good movie and chances are, if you've seen the other New 52 animated features (Flashpoint Paradox and War, for example) and you've liked them, you will like this one as well. I rented it initially and plan on buying it soon to add it to my collection. :)",1424649600,,1740,4.488958990536277

Really wanted to like it, of the prequel to this movie I wasn't a big fan of. Unfortunately it seems that is what they are building on. I don't dislike Aquaman, definitely not my top Superhero though. Honestly even if it is just made up Superhero stuff. Even in that universe it seems highly unlikely that ""The World's Greatest Heroes"" not only can't defeat essentially one Atlantean cause of a Trident and the fact that they are straight up killing people.

I know what you're thinking, why didn't Ocean Master just kill his mother when he first had the chance?

6678692,5,B00NT6NGT4,"Based on the New 52 Universe, this DC animated feature has it all: Terrific voice acting, an adult tone without being devoid of hope or humor, fantastic animation, action that builds character and tells a story, solid character arcs and a well-written plot based on the origin story of Aquaman.  Our hero is entirely likeable and his rise is a memorable one.  Far from the 1960s portrayal, this Aquaman has a serious set of powers that make sense within this universe.  His red-haired companion showcases some advanced moves that even Aquaman cannot perform yet.  The rest of the Justice League feature heavily and it does nothing to steal the show from Arthur.  This is almost on par with the vaunted ""Under the Red Hood"" in terms of quality and storytelling.  It is refreshing to see Aquaman being treated with respect considering the Robot Chicken backlash following his turn with the Super Friends.  With Jason Momoa poised to redefine the role on film, it looks like Aquaman is off to a solid start in 2015.

I purchased the BD/DVD/UV edition and was not disappointed.  All three arrived in two days and cheaper than any other retailer I checked.  Special features include: an original Aquaman episode from 1967, Justice League Unlimited Episode, Batman: The Brave and the Bold Episodes, standard trailers, back story for the feature's two main villains featuring commentary from a UCLA Psychology professor, and more.  This is what a DC animated feature can be.  Now if they would just abandon this ridiculous Son of Batman storyline...",1424390400,,1542,4.957198443579767

They got Nathan Fillion back for GL but where is Mike Rosenbaum for flash?!! No offense to the guy who voices batman, but we all know who should be the voice of Batman.  Anyway, I realize the story is focused on Aquaman becoming Aquaman and the villain is from his people but I didn't like how it made the entire league look inept against the main bad guy while Aquaman was the only one capable of saving the day. Maybe it's a plot hole because they try to explain why the main bad guy is so powerful and why Aquaman should be the one to deal with it but in the end when he does, he doesn't do anything uniquely Aquamanly that the rest of the league should have been able to do easily.

Ocean Master took on the entire team and was kicking some serious rear with it.  It was just ok in my humble opinion, I mean they could have done better than the other previous movies.

Yeah I'm not a fan of Brave & Bold (Powder ToastMan) version of Aquaman. Not familiar w/ other DC Universe movies besides The New Frontiers I purchased sometime ago. But I did enjoy this movie and was glad they didn't do a whole origin of Aquaman. They did a few flashbacks that didn't take up space and focused on the main story. Growing up in late 60's the origin of Aquaman was a bit different more so w/ Mera, Orm and Black Manta but it wasn't any let down and this version doesn't make me question it. I like the cast of Justice League it was interesting seeing Captain Marvel but his character seemed more like Billy and not a mature Captain Marvel I figure he's the same age as Superman or Batman.

6678739,2,B00NT6NGT4,"I'll be blunt.

Aquaman is still lame. This movie lacks a lot of the character development that made JL:War so interesting, and just isn't as good. Not to mention, now they're making Aquaman roughly as powerful as Superman or Wonder Woman--someone stabs him in the chest with a combat knife, and the blade literally breaks, and he's only ""half-atlanteean.""

Not to mention, Wonder Woman and Superman have no problem running around Atlantis for extended periods of time without even needing scuba gear. While talking and holding conversation.

It's just not nearly as good as ""War"" and doesn't develop the characters nearly so much, while focusing on the character and setting that... no one really likes.

Oh, and, *Spoiler Alert,* another part that was slightly ridiculous. The new king of Atlantis decides to ""purge the surface world."" So he takes... about 4-8 small tanks, and a couple hundred men, to wipe out mankind. Akin to Hitler deciding he'll conquer the world with 1000 men.",1424131200,3,985,5.024539877300613

6678742,3,B00NT6NGT4,"The art work was very nice. The voice acting was very good. The issue I keep having is with practical realistic violence.
The Practical would say that any of the JLA underwater besides Aqua man are going to need oxygen and a source/air tank and little shop/medical type masks really made it laughable.

If you possess a trident that allows you to make a tidal wave probably good to hit the beach with it first. That was a horrible amphibious assault. Seriously I know that everyone loves to line their troops up like Roman soldiers and march a legion at a time but this is not how practical fighting would go especially if how they hit cyborg at the beginning holds true they would have sent multiple tidal waves and then expanded the ocean on land.

The water lasers was a bit far fetched to say the least. I get that Aqua man has to not look like a tool because of Robot chicken and big bang theory slamming him a while back but seriously the lost arm hook was more bad ass along with the sacrificing of his arm to save his people. The problem with any of these kinds of stories is that details matter and when to many artistic liberties are taken the end result is a movie with no more than 3-4 stars and fans that voice opinions.",1424044800,,1233,4.310344827586207

6678745,1,B00NT6NGT4,"Not as bad as Justice League: War but definitely disappointing. Aquaman's gills and ability to talk to sea creatures is never explained, they just happen, and he immediately knows how to use them; he doesn't freak out that he can breathe underwater or even ask why; his mother abandoning him and NEVER contacting him makes no sense; his removal of the royal armor to just the orange undershirt makes no sense; an entire fight with a sea creature that was the PERFECT time to showcase Aquaman's power is instead given to Superman...for no reason; the forced Cyborg plot is annoying; the death of his mother that he never met (except briefly a child in a hazy drowning incident) somehow drives Aquaman into a full blown rage; Captain MArvel/Shazam is made very obviously much weaker than Superman, he never has the wisdom of Solomon to help him, his magic is now a lot weaker than even the Atlanteans, and now just a very strong bolt of lighting can transform him without his even saying Shazam;the league never meeting at first is never explained; the tidal wave that stops for no reason, since the entire goal of the bad guys is to kill all the ""surface-dwellers""; too many minor fridge moments as well (why does the throne room have stairs if everyone just swims up to you?); and, finally, bad editing/build-up of key moments (beating Orm, taking the Trident, death of the mother, meeting the league, talking to fish, etc.)

What makes it watchable: a decent Aquaman origin story, making him interesting, even if it really should've had an extra half hour of explainers; good animation; Green Lantern's isn't-this-all-silly one-liners; a great shout out to Batman: The Brave and the Bold; a pretty good fleshing out of the Wonder Woman-Superman-Lois Lane love triangle; the softening of Superman into someone who likes people; and interesting battle moments in otherwise uneven battle scenes (Orm using the trident to brace himself as he falls down a building's side, Wonder Woman taking on Atlanteans, etc.).

The problem is the movie logic seems primed for 12 year olds, but there is FAR too much blood/killing/hardcore violence for 12 year olds watching a comic book movie; at the same time, there s too much fridge logic for older fans to overlook. So in trying to be all things to all people, the movie fails to satisfy anyone.

Disappointing. With two major Justice League movie duds, DC really needs to go back to the drawing board on them; otherwise, DC's long reign over Marvel in the animation department is going to end soon.",1423958400,,2537,4.841013824884793

6678758,5,B00NT6NGT4,"Great story for a underrated character. Aquaman has always been the laughing stock of every comic book fan that I speak at conventions so far. For decades he's been in the back burner of DC Comics, until now. The powers that be, Geoff Johns, has been doing an excellent job at relaunching every DC character, with much success, and Throne of Atlantis story arc proves that he's on the right track. For the animation, they decided to do it as a stand alone origin story in the JL continuity. I always considered Aquaman as the number four after the big three, Green Lantern and The Flash very close to them also. For this movie, it continues the story from JL War, and adds to the missing components of the War movie lacked. Every character is reprise by the same voice actors from the War movie, animation is also in the same excellent style. The Blue-Ray is phenomenal,Vivid colors, and the audio and soundtrack are awesome. Pick this one up and enjoy another excellent story. Make Mine DC!",1423440000,,991,4.604519774011299
6678759,4,B00NT6NGT4,"It's about time Aquaman got the limelight he deserves. Anyone who's kept up with his New 52 title knows the King of the Sea was resurrected with more powers than ever before when DC rebooted its universe. ""Justice League: Throne of Atlantis"" is the latest explosive animated offering from the comic book giant and Warner Home Video and proves to naysayers our fishy friend has what it takes to be a contender.

Atlantian troops assault Metropolis as revenge for the death of their King. But the Queen of Atlantis has different plans and requires the Justice League to find her lost son, Arthur. While they search for him, the Atlantian soldiers, led by Ocean Master, continue their assault.

""Justice League: Throne of Atlantis"" is all the proof one needs to justify Aquaman's place on the greatest super hero team of all time. Whether on land or at sea, he can use his liquid-centric powers to bring down the law on all who oppose him or his friends.

I love the style for the New 52 animated movies and think the change that started even before ""Justice League: War"" was needed. The voice actors all fit quite well, too. Of course it's still hard to hear someone else besides Kevin Conroy voice Batman, but change occurs whether we like it or not.

""Justice League: Throne of Atlantis"" is rated PG-13 for sci-fi violence and action throughout. There's some profanity to be found as well. It was very unnecessary and really could've been avoided. The use of adult language is something that will cause some parents not to let their children watch the movie. However, I'm pretty sure no one would've avoided watching it if there weren't any curse words.

The Blu-ray edition of ""Justice League: Throne of Atlantis"" features some fun bonus material. They include ""Scoring Atlantis: The Sound of the Deep"" featurette, a Robin and Nightwing Bonus Sequence, the ""Throne of Atlantis"" NY Comic-Con Panel, ""Throne of Atlantis"" Soundtrack, a Sneak Peek at DC Universe's Next Animated Movie: ""Batman vs. Robin,"" ""Villains of the Deep"" Featurette, and Four Bonus Cartoons from the DC Vaults.

""Justice League: Throne of Atlantis"" is one of my favorite animated offerings from DC Comics. I'm a big fan of Aquaman and it's nice to see him get his due finally. My only complaint is the weird haze that seems to be placed over the animation in every DC animated movie I've seen. The film never lets up in the action and adventure departments and moves forward at a breakneck speed. There's never a dull moment and it will leave you wanting more as the credits roll. Also, try not to miss a a ""super"" special guest drop the ""hammer"" on some Atlantian troops.",1423440000,,2643,4.759825327510917
6678760,5,B00NT6NGT4,"Since the reintroduction of Aquaman into the DC Universe, just prior to the New 52 reboot, the character has been very well written. He is shown as tough, intelligent, and with deep conflicting emotions concerning his heritage and birthright. The storylines in the comics have remained faithful to that initial portrait over the last 5 years. His supporting cast has also been well developed. Mera, in particular, has come into her own. She is also tough, intelligent, and a character that can stand on her own. Throne of Atlantis was an arc a few years back in the comics, after Aquaman had been in the Justice League for awhile. It showed definitively just how powerful this character could be, taking on all of his Justice League counterparts and defeating them soundly. It also depicted how torn his mixed heritage made him. In the end though, Arthur Curry, always does the right thing.

This movie follows the Throne of Atlantis story line rather well. Arthur is depicted in here faithfully to the way he is portrayed in the comics. The plot line is mostly the same, though a bit different based on him not being in the War movie, as he should have been. Still, even with those minor tweaks, this is an excellent story. It is definitely targeted at a younger audience, but it is still enjoyable for an adult viewer who is willing to let their imagination run wild and watch superheroes fly, swim, run at speeds faster than sound, etc.

All in all, this was rather well done. DC movie makers for live-action films should take a clue from these animated ones. They are lively, fun, and stick to the core of what makes these characters what they are supposed to be...heroes.",1423440000,,1676,4.697278911564626

6678762,3,B00NT6NGT4,I was really hoping Throne of Atlantis would be really great. It was bad but not as good as it should be. I enjoyed Aquaman's story but thought they should have went deeper into Black Mantas story as well ad Ocean Master. Hated the Superman Wonder Woman being an item. Shazam is just a nuisance. Hated him in War and now in Thrones. His name is Captain Marvel and for me always will be. He's suppose to have the wisdom of Solomon but is portrayed like a man-child. The animation was ok I'd preferred if it looked more like the art from the New52 Aquaman series #1 . Other than that I lke it .,1423440000,3,592,4.156521739130435

6678766,1,B00NT6NGT4,"The film overall is okay. The story is lack luster and poorly timed. A seemingly normal guy accepts all this crazy news of being an Atlantean and a destined king fay too easily. The Justice League is severely underpowered in this film as well. There is one scene that is moderately cool and gives hope that the action might compensate for the poor story, but its just a tease that never delivers. The end fight has the entire Justice League fighting Orm and they...Spoiler Alert! Do not read past this sentence.

The justice League LOSES to Orm. Thats right the same animated universe Justice League that defeated Darkseid loses to Orm. It may be because they fight Orm one by one which is equally stupid and frustrating to watch. Makes absolutely no sense for them to fight one by one.

This final fight alone makes me hate this movie because it tries too hard to spotlight Aquaman and show him as an cool character. They went overboard.

Problems with the final fight are the following...

1. Shazam should not revert to Billy when hit by Orms lightning.

2. Why would Cyborg use a seemingly useless sonic wave assault on Orm when he just witnessed Shazam go down. He would know better to hit with a powerful attack. Just plot induced stupidity.

3. Wonder woman lassos Orms trident and it electrocutes her. Why does she not just let it go? Okay maybe its too painful for her to let go(stupid logic already), she lands  a punch on Orm and he barely flinches. Later on Aquaman punches Orm and it makes him fly around the city.

4. Flash attacks Orm and Orm knocks him out of the fight with a simple closeline.

5. Green Lantern who fights intergalactic demigods/gods and ancient universal threats gets defeated by a single lightning bolt.

6. Supermans heat vision that is hotter than the sun barely does anything to Orm other than knock him down.

Aquaman beats the snot out of Orm later.

This fight alone shows the writers/directors had no appreciation for the characters and simply produced this to popularize Aquaman. Fact is no matter what Aquaman will never be as cool as other Justice League members. And this movie made to highlight him as a hero actually made me despise the character even more because of the giant s*** they took on the DC heroes.",1423353600,15,2259,4.62

6678768,5,B00NT6NGT4,"I put five stars so people would read the review. I give it TWO stars.

I like the premise of the story, but not the execution. I felt the story was crammed into a short time slot, causing the creators to cut a lot of vital scenes that would have made this a great story. I only like the start of the movie. It was a decent introduction of the characters, but after that, it seemed like the story was cut into pieces and more action was created as a substitute for lack of story execution. The graphics were decent too, as well as the voices of Shemar Moore and Nathan Fillion.

The Antagonist was a story distraction. I totally disagree with the tidal wave. If you're going to create a tidal wave of that magnitude, there better be a good reason why you wouldn't use it to destroy your enemies. I greatly disagree with the big boss fight scene. You have can't have a guy best Superman, Wonder Woman, Flash, and Shazam, and then, try to create an epic battle between him and Amateur Aquaman. It will not feel believable, not even to many young teenagers. One could say, ""Hey, he used the Trident to defeat the others, but he couldn't use it on Author, so that's why their battle was longer."" and I can agree with that, but the story would need to emphasize it more and Aquaman was still an Amateur, so the creators would need to skillfully get around that too.

I like some of the sarcasm, but most of it seemed misplaced. Humor is great, but it's hard to pull off when the story feels weak. You can't save the story with humor.

Again, with the story being so crammed, the small romances all over the story felt like distractions, too. They would have been nice if this were a series or possibly a mini-series, then the writers could have developed the romances.

In short, Justice League and Justice League Unlimited set the bar and opened the window for more Justice League stories, but that bar is fairly high. What made that series so likable was the story line foundation, but the creators didn't stop there. They layered it with intriguing character development. They made the viewers care about the characters, Protagonists and Antagonists. The romances between John Stewart and Shaira, and Batman and Wonder Woman were decent, because the writers had enough time to develop them. The villains were believable and/or life like. The action was decent. There were flaws in their action scenes too, but they kept the flaws smalls.",1423267200,,2435,4.562929061784897

Do yourself a favor and skip this one.
 *spoilers*
I was excited to see that this is a new 52 based movie, the origins of the new aquaman was nice to see but otherwise this movie is terrible. This is my abridged version

""I'm the new king? No that can't happen. Oh ok I'm fine with it now."" ""Oh hey, your hot, lets make out."" (Both aquaman and the power couple that is superman and wonder women do this.) ""Hey i'm of both worlds and i'm your king now."" Atlantiens ""yay!"" ""Oh yea I can talk to fish now."" (quote from the move)

So yea the story was rather brief and suffered bad writing, even though its based off the graphic novel. I was way more interested in what was happening to cyborg, who is still dealing with his new robotic body and relationship with his father. Seeing the new power couple was kinda nice too but was set aside for aquamans story. The flashes spot of comic relief was filled this time by the more present captain marvel, but otherwise the Justice league set up is about the same.

Visually...meh. I mean i've never really been blown away by a dc feature but they haven't really looked bad. Here it's...boring. Atlantis was very underwhelming. Bikini bottom looks more impressive. The people of atlantis look like the belong on the surface with how they are dressed.(lots of cloth, not very mermaid like at all. And why are they harvesting seaweed?) None of them looking like the belong underwater at all.

So over all I was rather dissappointed, the first dc feature I really regret buying.",1423094400,5,1667,4.413680781758957

And in the comics, Vulko actually played a big part in the war.

Going to make my rants short.  The Justice League looked so weak in this movie, they hardly put any fight.  The attack of the Atlanteans looks so tired as well.  The comics made it more aggressive but here, it looked like they weren't serious.  I have to read the comics again, but I'm pretty sure Manta didn't die from being eaten by a giant shark.

6678801,2,B00NT6NGT4,"Spoiler alert!

I did not mind Justice League War but I felt that movie was a bit flat. This movie's animation also seems to have taken a hit as the smoothness from other earlier films is lacking here. I felt they cut corners in this department. However, I can forgive such corner cuttings if the story was good...but sadly it was not. Theoretically it is supposed to continue from Justice League: War but the connections to the first film are non-existent. Again however, I can forgive this since it is rather trivial...it is the story that has fallen flat.

The story was pretty simplistic at best and reiterated a slew of usual superhero cliches with more 1-dimensional characters that I can recall. Personality wise there wasn't much different from Flash, Green Lantern, or Shazam (Captain Marvel). Take away the costumes you'd be hard-pressed to tell who was who. The main story arc revolves around growing tensions Orm (and later on Black Manta) has towards the queen of Atlantis in regards to the threat that the surface people pose to Atlantis. It is quite evident from the get-go what the plot is going to be, who is going to be killed (the scene where the Queen is killed could not have been more obvious), and what was going to happen.

There were certain scenes that seemed absurd even given its comic book nature. There were several instances where the superheroes should have been outright dead as Cyborg and Superman were pretty much impaled but miraculously revived....even more vexing was Superman, who was underwater and had no access to sunlight to revive him.

Inconsistencies were abound....including Shazam being hurt by lightning and eventually turning back into Billy, Shazam needing to breathe underwater when he has the power of the Gods just like Wonder Woman who did not need a breather, Cyborg's armor being pierced under armor yet his circuitry was unaffected, Superman being able to breathe underwater (in the comics he can only hold his breath for a certain amount of time, but not long enough to stay in Atlantis and certainly not enough to speak without a breaking apparatus), Orm actually moving fast enough to knock down the flash, and so on. We don't get a chance to see Shazam's or Batman's true abilities and they make the main villain more overpowered than even his most powerful comicbook incarnations. I wasn't even sure if these were the same characters I've been reading post Flashpoint.

I've been disappointed by the last few DC releases and to see yet ANOTHER Batman movie will pretty much have me off this DC diet for good. This movie should've been an Aquaman movie, but probably due to marketing it was a Justice League movie. I feel that DC has lost its touch since the only movies that ever come out are Justice League, Superman, or Batman. They have a great library to expand upon, but yet there is no diversity in their stories or titles. The last good movie was probably Flashpoint and before that Wonder Woman and JL:A New Frontier along with some other pretty decent animated movies.

I understand that Justice League will help get the titles into more hands, but if they keep releasing crap like this they'll kill off the characters before they know it.

6678804,3,B00NT6NGT4,"We might as well call this chapter of the DCU Animated films 'The Book of Sequels' because that seems to be all that we have been receiving since 'Justice League: The Flash Point Paradox' . This time we get a follow up to Justice League: War, which finally includes something most of us have been waiting for. The origin of Aquaman.

I was very excited because since Bruce Timm began bringing us his DC animated world, he has been known to give those heroes that have been poked fun at their redemption. In this film we get the beginnings of Aquaman in a story that reunites this New 52 Justice League to save the world from a broken Atlantis. It is up to those who still want peace with humanity to find Arthur Curry and let him know his destiny. As a bonus he will encounter and befriend the Justice League to protect the people of Earth from evil.

I always enjoy these films, but this may be the weakest of the bunch. It has some great moments and I loved Aquaman's role in this film. Still, this movie is not as engaging as some of the others before it. I hated the fact that some of the voices in this film were swapped. As much as I love Nathan Fillion playing Green Lantern, I would have preferred Justin Kirk to continue on from Justice League: War. Same could be said for Alan Tudyk voicing Superman and Michelle Monaghan voicing Wonder Woman. Now bear in mind that Jerry O'Connel and Rosario Dawson are great, but I am a guy of consistency. We did get Sean O'Mara back to play Batman, who is now one of my favorites along side Kevin Conroy and Bruce Greenwood. Especially since he also voices Batman in Son of Batman. The highlight of this film is definitely Sean Astin, reprising his role as Captain Marvel and he has some of the best lines in the whole film. It is great seeing this character get a lot more development and screen time since these films began getting released. Finally new comer Matt Lanter did a great job as Aquaman. The film, while it does have its weaknesses does capitalize on Aquaman and all of his abilities, even the ones you may not know he had. While it would have been great to see more of them he is clearly a force to be reckoned with. I give the film additional credit with poking fun at the campy powers that he has just to get a few laughs out of the faithful. I also felt that the villains could have been fleshed out more. Black Manta is one of the most feared in Aquaman's rogues gallery and he only got a chance to show that for a small amount of time. Orm, also known as Ocean Master just came off as a big baby with tons of daddy issues. Still based on this film it looks this will not be the last we see of the King of Atlantis. To me that is a wonderful thing because the rights to Aquaman had passed hands while the original Justice League series was at its peak and we could have seen so much more from Aquaman.

Again, this film is enjoyable, but it just doesn't feel the same as the others, it is very rushed and lacks development that I usually expect from these films. However, there is a little surprise after the credits so as far as no more sequels...I have a feeling this story is going to be a little longer than I had anticipated. I am very eager to see just what is in store. For now the rest of the year will see the release for two more films. One reuniting the entire cast of Son of Batman and a third that may in-fact bring us a version of the Justice League we all know and love.",1422662400,3,3451,4.2178517397882
6678805,4,B00NT6NGT4,"No, this is not absolutely true to the New 52 or classic Aquaman origin story.  Yes, some parts of the story do seem a bit hurried, but it is still a very good entry in DC's Justice League cartoon series.  All of the complaining in these reviews could easily mislead you into thinking this movie isn't worth watching.  It's your loss if you do pass up on this one because it has a number of redeeming qualities.  The story has a nice balance of plot development and action, and contrary to what others have posted, there are some credible efforts to flesh out the characters by exploring some of their struggles in fitting in to normal society, coming to grips with newly discovered powers (Cyborg), and fulfilling their needs for meaningful relationships.  All in all, that's not bad for a mini-movie limited by roughly 60 minutes of storytelling time.  If you're a DC Comic fan, or a fan of New 52's Aquaman (I very much prefer New 52 Aquaman over his classic origin) you should be entertained by DC's efforts here.",1422662400,,1017,4.5911602209944755

I thought the voice work was very good especially having Nathan Fillion back as Green Lantern. I thought Aquaman, the Flash, Superman, Cyborg, and Wonder Woman were also greatly improved upon. I am still only okay with the Batman voice acting. I know Kevin Conroy couldn't do it forever. Just think this movie is better than anything the much darker, Dark Knight Returns based, movie universe will give us in the years to come.",1422576000,,668,4.717948717948718

6678808,4,B00NT6NGT4,"When franchise filmmakers successfully course-correct after a disastrous first chapter, you have to tip your hat to them.  The DC Universe Original Movie ""Justice League: War"" was one of the most disappointing entries in the longstanding DC Universe Animated Original Movie line.  In comparison, their new production and follow-up to ""War"" is a vast improvement.

Unlike its predecessor, ""Justice League: Throne of Atlantis"" has the feel of a standalone film.  The introduction of Arthur Curry/Aquaman (voiced by a humorous, conflicted and interesting Matt Lanter) and his own Atlantian saga is set parallel to the Justice League's stalled formation and its members' own conflicts, allowing the film to play like another surprisingly successful sequel - Tony Gilroy's ""The Bourne Legacy.""  Like that film, which introduced a new main character while crosscutting to the Jason Bourne and CIA events of the previous film and its characters, ""Throne of Atlantis"" begins with a well-staged attack on a Nuclear Sub, and then cross-cuts between Arthur's developing story and League members across the world - complete with titled locations featuring that nifty, clich `computer-generated' sound as letters appear on screen.  Oddly enough, locations are spelled out, with the same clich sound, in the ""Bourne"" franchise.

Screenwriter Heath Corson noted with regard to this project on www.comicbookresources.com: ""They sen(t) me the comics and then they say, 'What are we going to do, what can we take from this?' We don't want it to just be the comic book on film...I think the fact that we take them really seriously and then we add a little bit of humor in the storytelling, I think that's really what's different and what's fun...I think you don't see a lot of sophisticated adult storytelling in animation and I think people miss it from the animated series and from 'Justice League Unlimited,' and I like to think we're songs in the same key.""

""Throne of Atlantis"" definitely exceeds ""War"" with regard to its level of sophisticated adult storytelling that Corson refers to.  This is can be attributed on a great level to the correction of errors DC Universe Animation made in the production of ""War.""

Casting errors were a major problem with ""War."" Neither Michele Monaghan's Wonder Woman, Justin Kirk's Green Lantern, nor Alan Tudyk's Superman rang true on any level as the iconic characters they portrayed.  For ""Throne of Atlantis,"" Director Ethan Spaulding, Casting and Voice Director Andrea Romano, and Producers Alan Burnett, Sam Register and James Tucker nailed the recasting of these roles with DC Universe veterans Rosario Dawson as Wonder Woman, Jerry O'Connell as Superman and three-time DCUAOM Green Lantern veteran Nathan Fillion returning as the ring-slinging Hal Jordan.

The addition of these outstanding actors with Shemar Moore as Cyborg and Sean Astin as Shazam, both outstanding in ""War"" and ""Atlantis,"" together with Christopher Gorham as Barry Allen and Jason O'Mara as Batman, both of whom are easing nicely into their respective roles, creates a fully-realized group of actors that brings this new Justice League to life on a fully-realized emotional level.  Unlike in ""War,"" the cast of ""Throne of Atlantis"" brings Heath Corson's screenplay to life with humor, regret, pain, confusion, contemplation, anger - whatever emotions Voice Director Andrea Romano required to fulfill director Ethan Spaulding's vision.  This simply was not possible with the cast of ""War.""

The other major flaw in ""War"" was composer Kevin Kliesch's (""Superman Unbound"") overtly `synth' score.  Kliesch's symphonically artificially score for ""War"" gave the film the sound and emotional feel of Marvel's line of 1990's animated television series, not the theatrical feel of most DCUAOMs.  For ""Throne of Atlantis,"" Director Ethan Spaulding and Producers Alan Burnett, Sam Register and James Tucker went with superior composer Frederik Wiedmann.  In his liner notes for the ""Throne of Atlantis"" soundtrack, Wiedmann states the film ""asked for a little bit more than a standard superhero action score.  I was in awe of the beautiful design of the city of Atlantis. The colors and the animation captured a wonderful sense of mystery and magic, so the music needed to complement this throughout the story.""

Wiedmann employed woodwinds, ethnic guitars, violins, violas, cellos and basses in his arrangements and the orchestrations done by Hyesu Yang.  Parts of Wiedmann's score was performed by the Angel City Studio Orchestra, conducted by Yang as well.  The players on Wiedmann's score are Hollywood Session Players, AFM members who have played on major studio productions.  It is this use of the best musicians in the world that gives Wiedmann's score an emotional impact that elevates ""Justice League: Throne of Atlantis"" to that of a DCUAOM standalone film.

Wiedmann's contribution to the film is so important, it merited a `Special Feature' on the film's Blu-Ray release.  For viewers who know little about film scoring and recording, it is a fascinating look into the process.  It also reveals just how committed to his art Wiedmann is, and why fans of DC Universe Original Movies should always be excited when his name is attached to upcoming projects.

""Justice League: Throne of Atlantis"" is not without its flaws.  It's a shame the story calls for the invasion of Metropolis by the villain Orm and Atlantian troops.  While an admittedly inseparable part of the story from both the source comics and screenplay, comparisons arise to the superior and similar war invasion depicted ""Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox.""

Director Ethan Spaulding and writer Heath Corson quickly pivot out of this low-point by making the battle against Orm and his troops by the League, Aquaman and Mera (a perfectly cast Sumalee Montano) an intimate, personal confrontation.  Each League member's weakness against the Atlantian magic of the Trident which Orm wields is shown.  For once, Batman's entry into a battle is held back until the moment his skills are called for.  It's all timed perfectly to coincide with the moment Arthur Curry takes his stand against Orm - accepting his true destiny to rule Atlantis and complete his character arc.

The epic challenges of earth's wars and conflicts are juxtaposed against the intimate, difficult ostracization faced not only by Arthur Curry, but by Superman, Wonder Woman, Cyborg and Batman as well. It is the key subtext of the film, making it emotionally resonate beyond its predecessor.  Here's hoping this complex human theme continues to be explored in the next chapter of this ongoing series.",1422576000,2,6638,5.265654648956357

Like WAR, this cartoon has some really odd out of place profanity.  Now, I curse all the time, but I don't want to have little kids listen to Green Lantern and (Batman or Aquaman) say ""SH*T""  I mean really?  ""Sh*t? ""  War had them saying ""bastard"" or ""son of a Bi*ch""  one of them. Really out of place for a JLA cartoon.  PLUS, it was just bad.

The music is perfectly matched to the story. In fact, the music add quite a lot to the experience. Something I didn't expect to see, people actually die here. It wasn't graphic, really. But many humans, and monsters died violently. It fit the story well, and a young kid wouldn't notice it. The human deaths are off screen.

My only complain,,,the power levels of the Justice League members are very inconsistent.  Aquaman can punch through thick steel doors, but a thug in a bar fight can knock him down?  He boxes with the attackers?

I think the reasoning was that he was discovering his abilities, like in Man Of Steel.......but these heroes have near godlike abilities, and it isn't consistent. The Flash can run the speed of light, but can get sucker punched?  I get  that the power levels have to fit the story, but it's something I noticed a lot.

Another for the collection!  Top Notch animation and Great pacing.  I have seen all of the DC animes in this current line, to date.  I judge every viewing on ""its own 2 feet"", though this is part of the shared DC Universe which is really cool.  I too miss the Bruce Timm Directed material as much as the rest of the fans. and would like to see more variety of direction the way it is in the books.  I LOVE everything that is put out and respect them for their creative differences as films.

The Deep Ones were cool, though it was sort of a let down to have Superman defeat Cthulu: I thought this movie was about Aquaman. Some parts are really well done, while others are just flat/meh.

6678816,3,B00NT6NGT4,Was just ok.  I did like it better than War but I wish they would leave out the profanity.  It just doesn't fit in an animated feature.  It also prevents me from watching these films with my young sons which I would love to be able to do as a father.  Also some things did not make sense in this movie like how Superman and WW do not need masks to breath under water but yet the rest of the JL do?? I also am not a fan of the animation in this film as it seems a bit lifeless.  I miss the days of the old JLU TV show.  The writing and animation was much better.,1422489600,,561,3.752136752136752

Keep in mind that the DC animated movie universe officially stated it started a new continuous continuity back in Justice League War from February 2014 so this retelling of the tale is trying to introduce the characters we know into that continuity for future movies in this universe.  I think my favorite part of this Aquaman remake, and the most original part, was seeing Mera play a major role in the story and seeing her use her water powers in action.  I don't recall seeing her in action before so that was a nice change.  I recommend it for all but fans keep in mind that it is another variation of the Orm storyline so if you've been there and done that then keep that in mind before purchasing.",1422489600,2,1023,4.368421052631579

6678819,3,B00NT6NGT4,"Let me start off by saying I had low expectations when I watched this. DC movies have nice quality normally but this was not up to there usual standard. This would be a lower rating except a few nice parts in the movie.

First editing and continuity is very shoddy, the pacing is fast and moments were a brief dialogue might explain something they just jump into another action scene were something happens and you might not be sure why or what's going on.

Second the characters are just really inconsistent. They tend to be rather emotionless and tend to have sudden mood swings, literally 5 seconds of movie time acting one way then having a 180. Which goes back to first point that the pacing is so fast they really just put too much into this short of a movie.

But really this movie is saved by a Shark. I won't spoil it, but if you really want to see the scene I'm sure it's on YouTube. This movie would be 1 out 5 for its pacing and editing, action scenes are good but the Shark is just so good to keep the rating up.",1422489600,,1025,4.219387755102041

It really felt like it needed to be longer, since parts just happened just because. How did Aquaman control fish? Because.... How did they escape from the deep? Because..... Also, I do agree that some of the stuff with the Justice League, like Cyborg possibly becoming more like his Dad, felt brushed over and not focused on. Overall, this is the weakest of all the Justice League films, but it's still not bad. Entertaining, but it could of been so much done, given the source material.",1422403200,,784,4.528169014084507

To the movie itself: This was not a new idea but a re-hash of the 2001 Justice League Season 1 episode 6 and 7 The Enemy Below with some new elements.  The animation is on par with what has currently been produced: clean colors and the outfits look like the New 52 comic series.  The writing is sub-par and definitely not up to the level of Young Justice.  The voice acting was simply ""read said line here with no emotion or inflection"" ...and on to the next line.  At some point writers forgot that when 9 year old Billy Batson becomes Captain Marvel he becomes a man with the wisdom of Solomon not a 9 year boy in the body of Superman.  The plot was forced with poor story transitions.  Then for some reason, after multiple movies over the last 10 years, it tries to hint to it's building the actual Justice League for the first time?  - I'm confused, how many ""origin"" stories do we need?  Is there truly someone out there that doesn't know who each character is already and where they came from?  ~sigh~ I digress.

I have been rather disappointed with some of DC's previous offerings. While Justice League War was a great story, the characterization of Superman and Wonder Woman as well as the constant bickering among the team were terribly annoying. Assault on Arkham is fun, but the story is so convoluted that it is difficult to watch more than once.

The Throne of Atlantic is a well developed story is approached with the seriousness that both Justice League heroes and their enemies deserve, but without the gimmicks that are sometimes used to create a ""adult"" film out of comic book characters.

I would always like to see more special features on the Blu-Ray, but the ones included are quality and ejoyable. The film is well-worth purchasing.",1422403200,,911,5.10738255033557

6678838,4,B00NT6NGT4,"I can see why this has mixed reviews. After watching it with no expectations, I can say that I actually enjoyed the movie. But there are things that fell a little flat to me, but half of them are because I am comparing it to the new 52 Justice league comics. I think most people need to consider the animated universe and the comics as separate, they're never going to align perfectly. I'm just enjoying the fact that we are able to have both and seeing the similarities of the movie to the comics gives me a sense of joy.

But if I were to judge the movie as a movie alone, it did have some issues. The dialogue at times felt choppy where the lines between characters felt choppy in timing in response to each other. It constantly would take me out of the movie and ruined the flow somewhat. Also, transitions between scenes should be more varied instead of just a black screen. Some wipes or even dynamic transitions would be nice. Like if batman is communicating to cyborg it could zoom into his communicator in his mask matrix style and zoom back out to the headquarters with cyborg. The black screens took me out of the flow as well, so I guess my major issue was the flow of the movie. Just in general between scenes and also the dialogue.

Overall though, if you're a fan of Justice league, you'll enjoy it. Just because you are a fan and will have fun seeing the scenes played out in a movie.

But that's it as far as motives go. There are few character conflicts and just very little drama over all. The film had its moments however, and I will surely watch this one again someday.

Lots of action combined with plenty of funny moments (especially the part when Batman and Superman were investigating Dr. Shin's house!) and good character development made this a great film. I only have a few, minor peeves about this movie:
1. How is Wonder Woman breathing underwater? She's never been able to do that before (as far as I can remember)
2. I find it strange that a being like Superman appears to have sustained a severe, PERMANENT injury
3. Why does Shazam need a breathing apparatus underwater when Superman and Wonder Woman don't? Makes no sense

6678855,4,B00NT6NGT4,"Okay, so I gave it four stars; however, with a caveat.

If you notice when rating something here at Amazon, 3-stars implies that you think it's ""okay"" while 4 means you ""like it"". In addition, if you also look at my username, you'll will notice that it says JLA Fan...so duh, I'm a huge Justice League fan! So what does this all mean?

It means, that you could probably take a pile of poo, slap a sign on it (or in it) saying ""Justice League"" and my opinion would most likely go from, ""Ew -- poo."" to ""Oooohhh -- poo!""...Meaning, my opinion is perhaps biased.

Having said that, if this movie were not about the Justice League, I probably would have given it 3 stars at most.

My biggest deal with this movie, as some others have suggested, is it seems to be more focused on action versus story. While the story isn't bad - it's based on the Justice League series story-arc by the same name - it just doesnt' seem to carry the same weight or have the positive effect on me that reading it did.

I will say that I am estactic that Nathan Fillion is back as the voice of Green Lantern, Hal Jordan which is a huge bonus!...I thought the guy they used in Justice League: War was terrible. Fillion sounds much more confident and cocky which is fitting of Hal. The guy they used in JLW, sounded more whiny and annoying.

Aside from that, I actually really like most of the other choices for voices, particularly Matt Lanter as Aquaman and Jerry O'Connell as Supes. Superman is my favorite hero, so I'm very picky in regards to him, but can say that O'Connell is the first actor I was okay with voicing him, not named Tim Daly or George Newbern. Matter of fact, I think I might have even preferred O'Connell. :O Ironically enough, in voicing Supes, O'Connell didn't really even sound like what I'm used to O'Connell sounding like.

Unfortunately though they are still using O'Mara for Bats which I'm not a big fan of...DC, if you are not going to use Conroy, at least give us Bruce Greenwood! It's not that I have anything against O'Mara, I'm just not feeling Batman from him.

Anyway, the movie felt a bit rushed and lacked character and charm. It may be on par with Justice League: War, but it is certainly no Justice League: Doom...or even Flashpoint Paradox.

Finally, if anyone is wondering how I can rate the movie when it hasn't been released yet, it's because it has been released digitally (I purchased my copy through Vudu).",1421971200,21,2427,4.460496613995486

Then, after completely laying waste to the entire Justice league a little video makes the badguy an easy target and he gets stomped... WHAA???? Shoulda been a 90 minute movie. Continuity is key in these movies and they could have developed characters a little more and flushed the story a bit without it getting boring. As is it seems they figured everyone that would watch this film would have read the comic books related to it so they didn't need to focus on the small stuff. Solid movie, fun to watch.

6678929,2,B00NT6NGT4,"If they want to make a new Justice League cartoon show, they should just make it -- because ""Justice League: Throne of Atlantis"" feels like it was written as a multi-episode arc.

And yet, this sequel to ""Justice League: War"" is strangely flat. Supposedly it introduces the character of Aquaman, king of Atlantis, while also exploring the growing pains of the Justice League. Yet both are handled with an oddly passionless approach, with all the characters -- except Cyborg -- sliding into their new positions with little actual conflict or trouble.

The Justice League is having trouble coming together as a group -- Batman is busy doing his solo thing, Superman and Wonder Woman spend all their time macking on each other, and Cyborg is having trouble adjusting to his new body. But when a submarine is destroyed by an Atlantean army, they have to get together and investigate.

Meanwhile, lighthouse-owner Arthur Curry is mourning the death of his dad when he's attacked by a bunch of mysterious sea creatures. Turns out he's the lost crown prince of Atlantis, and his mother the queen wants him to take his rightful place. But his older brother Orm isn't happy about that, since he wants all surface-dwellers to be extremely dead. And he's willing to murder his own family for that.

The biggest problem with ""Throne of Atlantis"" is that it doesn't feel like a movie, or even a sequel to one -- it feels like an episode of a TV show. While TV shows can neglect characters or storylines for a few episodes, a movie doesn't have that option -- and ""Throne of Atlantis"" leaves most of the Justice League thin as paper dolls.

There's some halfhearted lip service paid to the idea that these people don't get along and are just getting used to being a group (""Avengers""-style). But this sort of fades away when the first crisis comes along, and by the end they're all happy, united and over any personal issues they might have had about working together. All it took was one mission, and not a very epic one.

This is made especially painful because none of the characters are very well-developed either. Batman is barely even present, even when he's onscreen -- his part in the plot could mostly be filled by an iPad. Shazam is there just to be perky and violently annoying, and both Green Lantern and Flash seem like they'll be amusing, but end up fading into the background. The only one with any character growth is Cyborg, who is depressed and struggling with the idea of being mostly machine.

And yes, that applies to Aquaman/Arthur Curry as well. Like the rest of the League, he just sort of shifts from ""crusty town drunk who chats with lobsters"" to ""heroic monarch"" in the space of about six minutes, with nothing that really explains this change in personality. He never rejects his destiny or shows any anger or confusion -- he just sort of slides into his new role (and an instant relationship with a woman he barely knows) without even blinking.

And what do we get instead of proper character development? We get the awkward, shoehorned-in romance between Superman and Wonder Woman, who have as much sexual chemistry as siblings. Seriously, either one has more chemistry with Lois Lane in her one-minute cameo. The intent was pretty clearly, ""See? Wonder Woman is a MUCH better choice for Superman, not that stupid HUMAN Lois,"" but it backfires horribly.

Despite the thinness of the characters, it does have some excellent action scenes, both on land and at sea -- one involves Arthur duking it out with monstrous sea-creatures atop his lighthouse, causing it to crash to the ground. Another involves the climactic battle in the streets of a seaside city, with the League finally kicking much butt. And Sam Witwer throws his all into playing a malevolent usurper with plenty of enthusiasm.

The problem with the animation? The characters don't have much expression. One scene features Superman being impaled on a trident and electrocuted... and while screaming in agony, he has no expression. It's like Superman as played by Kristen Stewart.

""Justice League: Throne of Atlantis"" has some good points, but the rushed pace and flat characterization -- including the too-easy formation of the League -- make it feel oddly lifeless. Let this one sink to the bottom.",1421366400,65,4278,4.822646657571624

- the Nu52 uniforms. They just don't work. They're busy just for the sake of being busy. I'm not a purist, so it's not like I'm pissed off they're not the originals, it's just that these don't work. The young justice uniforms were far better updates.
- cyborg.  Has anybody found a way to make him work? No! That character needs a major retooling.
-Green Lantern constructs... during the final battle there is the dumbest construct I've ever seen. Constructs just don't work they're always groan inducing. They need to stick with the Green Lantern abilities from the original justice League cartoon.

6678965,2,B00NT6NGT4,"I was more disappointed in this movie than the previous Justice League: War movie. It didn't really take time to develop Aquaman as a character. He goes from drunk to King material as fast as you can change hats. The guy is going thru some tough times and the loss of loved ones. How does he cope with it? Don't know. Is it something in his upbringing or in his background? Who knows. Was he inspired by someone in someway? They don't tell us. What I'm talking about is character background, development and some growth. Its very thin and there's hardly any of it, which along with the action makes the whole movie feel kind of empty. There's just not enough in the way of substance here or decent writing. I don't feel sorry for Aquaman's losses or any of the other characters because the writing doesn't make me care. How can I care when you would think that Aquaman would be mourning the loss of loved ones, but he's too busy hitting on some underwater babe.

In the last War movie they depowered Darkseid and made him into an intergalactic thug from the terrifying demigod-like alien that he was in the past. In this movie Ocean Master can now stand toe to toe with the entire Justice League. Its a little hard to swallow and it doesn't help that there is no explanation of his powers. They seem to all come from his trident. That is one killer trident. If I remember right in the old comics he actually had some magical abilities, but this is not explored in the film. He just gets a trident and is now on par with Darkseid. Its a little much. There's a whole Atlantean army marching! Except it doesn't really look like there's that many of them when they are preparing to come on shore. Maybe they didn't have enough of a budget to give us a truly large and terrifying army?

Remember when Superheroes tried not to kill people maybe even when the bad guys have it coming? Now there's no hesitation about throwing some solidified water daggers into Atlanteans or Wonder Woman slicing and dicing some fish creatures (that are obviously sentient), etc. Surprisingly enough Batman who has no problems beating people up, but will never cross the line of killing others never calls anyone else out on their actions. I guess DC is trying really hard to earn its PG-13 rating with the uptick in violence. Are they trying to appeal to an older demographic? Do they think that violence and death alone somehow makes the story more ""mature""? Well, I can tell you that it doesn't make the story any better. I'll point to Young Justice as a better written mix of old school superheroes and more modern sensibilities.

In conclusion, I found the story to be weak and for an origin story we end up not knowing much about who Aquaman is as a person and therefore not much about him as a hero.",1421193600,14,2782,4.483234714003944

6678990,2,B00NT6NGT4,"Aquaman deserved better. 72 minutes was not enough time to tell the story of Arthur's origin, the Throne of Atlantis story, and two pointless love stories (Superman/Wonder Woman and Cyborg/Scientist lady). The animation was so poor at times, most notably in the lip syncing. It looked like an episode of Speed Racer. Aquaman was not the badass we know him to be. One could argue that it was because he was first starting as a superhero, but I was incredibly disappointed when Superman said, ""I'll take it from here, Arthur"" when the two were taking on a SEA MONSTER. Aquaman was also written as a goofball sometimes. Saying lines like ""Can't things just go back to normal?"" when he complained to the Justice League, as well as my favorite line he spoke to Mera, ""I talk to fish now. And they actually listen. So... I'm gonna stop my evil half brother from destroying the surface world. Do you uhm... you wanna come?"". THAT LINE IS WORD FOR WORD WHAT CAME OUT OF HIS MOUTH. Aquaman didn't even defeat his brother! It was Cyborg and Batman! What the hell happened! They ruined the original story by trying to squeeze in this extra crap with the other Leaguers. Oh they also killed off an imperative character to the story. He just sorta showed up and died. I was super stoked to see this movie as an Aquaman lover as well as a lover of these DC animated films. But I have no idea what the hell happened to this one. Whatever. I'll wait for the Jason Momoa Aquaman film I guess.",1421107200,10,1475,4.4869888475836435

6678992,3,B00NT6NGT4,"*****Some Spoilers in the Review*****

The movie was ok though I think Justice League: War was better.  It seems that they are forgoing any type of story development in favor of action and fighting scenes.  At the first the Atlantians are strong and skilled fighters that can damage a 1/4 ton Cyborg then they're just ""ordinary"" bad guys that die so easily from a stern look by Batman.  The Atlantian army is part of the coup, but then at the end they are shocked that a coupe happened...just examples of the inconsistencies that occur numerous time throughout the film.

I didn't like how they compensated for how weak the Atlantian army was against the JL by making the Trident Spear all powerful.  Oceanmaster beats up the entire League, yet is beaten Aquaman who had just gotten his butt kicked by Manta Ray.  I will always support the DCAU original movies and look forward to their release, but I feel the New 52 based movies are not as well done as say Batman: Mask of the Red Hood or Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths.

Overall I recommend this as a rental.  I also bought the blu-ray / dvd combo, but I did it to support future DCAU releases.",1421107200,68,1153,4.5048076923076925

6678994,1,B00NT6NGT4,"Personally, I just do not like Aquaman. He smells like fish and alcohol. Both are traits that remind me of my dad. Most of my youth was spent working on the back dock cleaning the fish, doing the dishes and cleaning the paper boats at the Long John Silver franchise resturaunt he owned here in Colorado.
Eventually, he lost the resturaunt when one drunk and stormy night he stole a crane. He drove the crane over from a nearby construction site where they were building a Kenny Rogers chicken restaurant. He picked up the entire resturaunt with everyone inside and began swinging it around. The intention was to give them an authentic dinning experience being at sea during a storm.
However, because he was so drunk that night, he was actually swinging the Del Taco around from next door. None of the people inside were documented citizens, consequently, he never faced charges for the incident besides the usual public intoxication and vehicular theft.
Nothing new for him.
I can't sit through this movie without feeling a sense of anxiety recalling all the nautical-related drunken shenanigans I was witness to during my youth.",1419724800,16,1129,4.885416666666667
6678995,5,B00NT6NGT4,"This movie will be amazing. Being based off of one of the best recent Justice League storylines this is a chance for Aquaman to shine and show that he truly is a Justice League member. Live that for the New 52 movies they are keeping the same cast from Justice League: War and Son of Batman.

To the People who complain that Kevin is not in this, I love Kevin just as much as toy and love it every time he voices Batman, but it's good to give it to other people once and a while our it gets stale. Lastly, this is Nathan Fillian's third time voicing GL.",1419206400,6,553,4.073394495412844
