They don't cover everything but they cover a lot of things you may not have thought of.  Kind of hokey, but very enjoyable.  The quality is a little sub par, as if this couple did all the writing, directing, filming and editing on their home computer.  They probably did, but I still recommend it.",1378512000,,437,4.6103896103896105
8130043,4,B000GAKP3Q,"This guide to horse care is full of fun little tidbits to amuse all ages. It's presented with goofy little tricks to keep the viewer amused and interested. It's a little slapped together, but I don't mind the lack of bells and whistles. It's accurate, helpful and fun to watch, so what more could you ask for? Actually, I could ask for the exploration of tack placement and care, as well as more information on the correct way to handle and groom a horse. It would make this video exactly what I'm looking for, which is a fun, educational video to show to kids at a summer horse camp.
All in all, this was a great buy and will be an awesome rainy-day activity for any time conscientious horse enthusiast.",1210723200,3,704,4.423076923076923
