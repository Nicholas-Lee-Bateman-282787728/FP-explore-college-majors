3163334,3,B0016PUSWI,"This budget DVD-10 from Lionsgate has two El Santo movies: Santo in the Wax Museum(1964, black and white) and Santo and Blue Demon in the World of the Dead(1970, color). In 'Wax Museum', Santo battles a Vincent Price-ish guy who makes wax statutes out of people! In 'World of the Dead', Santo battles a demon who possesses his girlfriend(Pilar Pellicer)! This film predates The Exorcist(1973) by three years. El Santo was like the John Cena or Hulk Hogan of his time; he was a professional wrestler who starred in his own campy movies. Santo movies have detractors(especially with people in the Mexican government)for being mindless camp. In the plus column, 'World of the Dead' has the Funky El Santo theme by Gustavo Cesar Carrion! For Santo fans only!",1288396800,6,754,4.8984375

8264069,5,B0016PUSWI,"Just got this today in the mail. The disc was in perfect condition. I saw a bit of Santo en Elmuseo de Cera and thought it was pretty good so far. It's unfortunate that there are no English subtitles. Even if you play it on an Xbox 360 you can't choose subtitles. I thought I would be able to because I have an Xbox 360. The good news is you can still catch on to the plot fairly well, I knew a few of the words they were saying because I took Spanish in 8th and 9th grade.",1442448000,,473,3.836734693877551

8264071,5,B0016PUSWI,"Good pair of Mexican-made, Spanish-language (no dubbing or sub-titles) El Santo flicks.  The first one in black-and-white, Santo in the Wax Museum, is about Santo squaring off against a mad wax museum owner.  The wax figures are pretty good and it has some creepy moments.  This is the better of the two.  The second one in color, Santo and Blue Demon in the World of the Dead, is about Santo having to go into the hoary netherworld to save his sweetie from a witch's curse.  Blue Demon only has a small part in this.  The quality on the Lions Gate DVD is excellent.  Recommended for Santo fans.",1422057600,,595,4.5046728971962615

8264074,4,B0016PUSWI,"I first discovered the ""Santos"" Movies in the summer of 2010. I am a Vintage Horror Collector and was very amused and captured by just how different these Films are in their interpretation of Horror and Fantasy! I highly recommend this DVD and also ""Santos VS. Frankenstein's Daughter"" also available on Amazon. It is a unique look at Mexico's 1960's Style of Horror.",1351036800,4,367,4.841269841269841
8264075,4,B0016PUSWI,"Lucha libre movies are usually released on DVDs as double features and all too often, a strong film is saddled with a weak one. This DVD, on the other hand, contains two strong Santo vehicles that are from opposite ends of the 1960s. ""Santo en el museo de cera"" is a black-and-white riff on ""House of Wax"" that features some moody cinematography and some pretty effective creepy moments in the first half. This is one of the better-known Santo films partly due to its being released in a dubbed version for American TV, and partly because it's one of the tighter-constructed movies. It's almost like a live-action comic book, which is precisely the point. This is a superior B-movie, close in spirit to the Santo comic books. It's easy to understand why some Europeans thought that Santo was a superhero created for the movies, especially after you watch him in this film. ""Santo y Blue Demon en el mundo de los muertos"" is a supernaturally-themed color film involving reincarnation and colonial-era witchcraft. At times it reminded me of the 'Dark Shadows' soap opera that was popular around that time and I wonder if that was the idea. Blue Demon has a very small role in this movie, despite what the DVD box will lead you to believe. There's a lot of imagination in this movie, and some really exciting fights closer in spirit to a brawl rather than typical lucha moves. I especially liked the sequences in the World of the Dead toward the end of the movie. Unfortunately, ""El mundo de los muertos"" has lower production values than ""El museo de cena"" which robs some of the more outre ideas of some much-needed punch.

No subtitles (sadly) - not even in Spanish! Still, for any lucha libre fan - especially one who remembers when VHS copies of these films were very hard to come by - this is a good deal and one of the better pairings to come out of Lionsgate. The very best lucha libre movies are like Silver Age comicbooks brought to life, and ""El museo de cena"" is one of the all-time best lucha movies.",1300665600,15,2009,4.580555555555556
