2259455,5,B0008JF9EA,I am a Cathe fan and as always this work out did not disapoint me.  I have the whole series now.  I have a complete workout for my whole body and it does work.  I want the blast series next but for now I can see results with this one. A+++++,1285113600,,241,3.6862745098039214
2259456,4,B0008JF9EA,"Really good and easy to follow instructions. I would have prefer that it also have a section for triceps which I have to work separately after working with this DVD. Other than that, it is a great arms workout. I highly recommend it!",1249430400,4,233,4.441860465116279
2259457,5,B0008JF9EA,I bought this DVD along with Cathe's tricep & chest workout in an attempt to get defined arms for my wedding this summer.  I've done them both only a couple of times each and I can already see a difference.  Hopefully I can keep my motivation up for a few more weeks and have Michelle Obama arms by the summer and in time for my strapless dress!,1245974400,2,345,4.134328358208955
2259458,5,B0008JF9EA,I LOVE Cathe's Gym Style Series. I've done them for a month and got amazing results!!! They are so much fun and not boring at all. Cathe is just amazing and a great instructor! Gym Style is great upper body workout.,1231632000,5,215,4.2682926829268295
2259459,5,B0008JF9EA,"Gymstyles hits every muscle fiber in your back, shoulders and bis with varying weights and rep counts.  Just when you think you can't do another rep - it's time for a bonus burn with the band.  I have made tremendous strength gains with the Gymstyles series.",1221696000,2,258,4.586956521739131
2259460,5,B0008JF9EA,"Great gym style workout.  If you are looking to really sculpt and have nice biceps, shoulders, and back this one's for you.  My hubby tried it and it kicked his booty too.  I love Cathe's workouts she pushes you beyond what you think you can do with bonus reps and encouragement.  I own most of her workout dvd's and have yet to be dissappointed.  It is like having a personal trainer in your home.",1219708800,5,398,4.324324324324325
2259461,5,B0008JF9EA,This is a great workout for someone trying to add some strength and some curves.  I can already see a difference in my biceps and shoulders!  I just recently began doing Cathe's workouts in the last 6 months and I love it!,1197590400,5,222,4.261904761904762
2259462,4,B0008JF9EA,"Here is another installment in Cathe Friedrich's Gym Style series, this time focusing on Back, Shoulders and Biceps.  Clocking in at under an hour, this routine gets a lot done in little time.  For this workout you will need a barbell (dumbells as also be used), assorted dumbells, a resistance band and step or bench are also used.

After a simple warmup, you will start with back work.  Here you will see reverse dumbell rows, then you will move into one arm rows followed by a seated T-back squeeze using a resistance band.  Finishing out the back set are barbell pullovers and some unweighted lower back exercises.

Shoulders are next, these are hit well with a combination of dumbell and resistance band exercises.  Here you will see seated overhead presses, standing lateral raises including a bonus set with the band, front raises with the band, and rear deltoid raises again an extra set with the band.

Biceps are last, these are hit extremely thoroughly and from all angles.  Starting with barbell curls working the length of the bicep, then you will do dumbell partial reps working the belly of the bicep, bottom half first, then the top half. Next you will do seated concentration curls which work the peak of the bicep, a very slow count is used here which makes them pretty tough.  To finish out the bicep segment you will do hammer curls and an exercise where you curl up and twist down, working the length again plus the forearms.  Finally you will do some wrist curls which get the forearms some more.

This is probably my favorite in the Gym Style series as hard as it is.  Very thorough and challenging, guaranteed to whip your upper body into shape.  There are also shorter premixes if you don't have time to do the full workout which is a nice option.  Four and a half stars for this one.",1180224000,18,1809,4.609375
8056324,2,B0008JF9EA,it is ok music is horrible and feels like old school aerobic workout. wish it was more focused and used only weights and weight bench not bands or steps. needs to be more current with less people in the video actually turns me off. very disappointed.,1501372800,,250,4.456521739130435

8056327,5,B0008JF9EA,"I love this DVD...perfect pace to use heavy weights and a toning band. I never got big/bulky, but just slim arms with no bat wings! Included are biceps variations (concentration, hammer, lawnmower, close grip, etc.), upper back, shoulder press, lower back moves.  Also included are pre-mixes which give you a mixture of these exercises in shorter time version (<35mins).  the moves are done at a nice pace, two beats, not fast, to where you cannot catch on.  I use this in conjunction with her other gym style triceps/chest.",1429142400,2,524,4.931818181818182

I am using pretty much the same weight that Cathe does but did not do so in the beginning.  Soooo.....it's definitely working!",1357171200,,304,4.016666666666667
8056332,4,B0008JF9EA,"Work your back, shoulders, and biceps hard, smart, and in 51 minutes.

I enjoyed this gym style workout in which Cathe Friedrich goes from one exercise to another in a controlled and moderate pace, with strict form.  This is a mostly dumbbell based workout so you need various sets of dumbbells, (but you could just start with one pair).  A barbell is used, but you may use dumbbells.  You should also have a bench or step, along with a flat thera-band, (the flat, thin one, not the round tubing).
