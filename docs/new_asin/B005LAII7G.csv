4756882,5,B005LAII7G,"I heard good things about this movie, and now I see why. It got right to the point and gave us what we wanted; a good ol' fashioned shoot-em-up action flick. It's much better than the 1995 Stallone version. Judge Dredd is very sinister, yet bad ass. While investigating a homicide in the 200-story slum tower block Peach Trees, Judge Dredd and rookie Judge Anderson are locked in by Ma-Ma. (Ma-Ma is the dealer of an addictive new drug called SLO-MO) They must fight their way thru the building and execute Ma-Ma's men. Judgment is coming. I highly recommend DREDD!!!",1348272000,2,567,4.68
4756883,4,B005LAII7G,"Dredd 3D takes place in a futuristic City with plenty of action that doesn't get in the way of story telling and character development. Well paced with some note worthy 3D moments.

DREDD 3D STORY: Entertaining for the most part
The story is well told and set in a Megalopolis City, following Dredd as he's travels by motorbike after a gang of wasters, putting an end to them only to end up trapped inside a giant mall/apartment building on lock down. Calling the shots from the 200th floor is a ruthless, merciless female antagonist Ma Ma, short for her full name which includes the first two letters of her first and last name. She is distributing a slow-motion drug, and it's up to Dredd to stop her or perish at the hands of every armed citizen called to action by Ma if they want to regain their freedom.

The story is given heart with trooper Anderson, a female mind reader on her first assignment with Dredd, who not only adds a soul to contrast against Dredd's cold, caculating demeanor, but she also adds some comical moments between her and Dredd, thanks to her mind reading ability. In a way, she was the star of the movie, but shared equal screen time with Dredd thankfully.
Their assault up to the top floor takes many twists and turns, with the bullets taking a break just enough to allow for character and story development before the guns begin blazing once more. Karl Urban does a great job as Dredd nonetheless, delivering believability in his role.

ACTION: Well paced, with plenty of bullets flying at a steady stream, with easy to follow cinematography from start to finish. Many shots get up close and personal to the characters, but offer enough space to get a sense of location and character stance. The action is not constant, and allows breathing room for the characters to express themselves during the brief stealth moments or downtime. Several moments reminded me of DIE HARD. The cool twist was Dredd's gun had plenty of different ammunition types, from stun, machine gun, incendiary grenade, silencer, and more to add variation to his assault. Plenty of gory moments followed his ascent up the massive tower.

3D JUDGMENT: Mixed Bag 3D gets better halfway on:
Dredd 3D has a combination of brilliant (slo-mo shots of glass or water flying looks amazing), good (most of the film) and poor (the first 10 to 20 minutes or so) 3D mixed throughout it's runtime, but most of the 3D is clearly restricted by the scene compositions usually including a very close foreground object, character or fence so close to the screen, that everything has to converge its focus on the frontal object, resulting in some average 3D where it could have been brilliant, like many of the scenes during slow motion.

Peering down some of the hallways, you really get a sense of great space reaching far down the path, with objects jutting out from the sides, characters walking into the depth to great effect.
But not to overlook the flaws during the first twenty minutes of 3D shots, where we end up with a lot of timid 3D with minimal layers, plus combined with some conflicting reflective lighting effects where one eye sees light on the vest of Dredd, while the other eye only sees some of that light. Thankfully the problems clear up roughly after the first 20 minutes of 3D and the rest is mostly smooth sailing with good to excellent 3D.

STORY: 8/10. Point A to B with plenty of conflict, along the way.
ACTING: 8/10. For an action movie, believable characters.
ACTION: 8/10. The action was fun to watch, but fairly basic in style.
FX: 8/10 Nice special FX and some nice gory moments in slo motion.
3D: 7/10. From brilliant to subtle, a mixed bag of mostly good 3D.

SOUNDTRACK: 9/10 Industrial, hard edged electronics compliment the action well.

DREDD 3D is a satisfying shoot-em up action movie with a nice futuristic style worth a watch for the lead characters, action, special FX and 3D.",1348185600,9,3906,4.691970802919708
4756884,5,B005LAII7G,"DREDD 3D

Excellent movie for the budget. The spirit of Dredd is here in spades. It is not perfect but bloody imaginative.

First the camera work is fantastic. This is really a film to see in 3D. Not because of fancy Hollywood CGI but because of brilliant artistic imagery.

MegaCity looks European in the visuals and vistas but maybe for Americans the vans and cars just look weird. So it works!

Pete Travis' direction is solid and Alex Garland's script is informed and funny. Would loved to have heard Dredd say ""Drokk"" just once!

Karl Urban is Dredd. He needs to be warmed too but he plays the part very well. Olivia Thirlby is also excellent as Anderson. Lena Headey is very convincing in her Motherly role.

I do hope this becomes a franchise. Dredd is as important as Bond. Show him some respect.

Brilliant!!!!!",1347235200,210,820,4.613793103448276

This version of the 2000AD comic book Lawman, is a vast improvement of the 1995 movie version by Danny Cannon and starring Sylvester Stallone Dredd, even though I still like that version as well, has now been given justice to its dramatic story line casting with Karl Urban and Lena Heady and is much darker and more intense version take of the 1995 movie version and of course graphically violent throughout the movie. Lastly the other good thing about this version of Judge Dredd is the uniform itself, without the metal shoulderpads and the Lawgiver 2 hand gun, with various ammunition rounds and the firing of the weapon itself and his police bike, which is used in the graphic chase scene at the beginning of the movie and that it was shot live in downtown Pretoria, South Africa, which stood in for Mega City One.

4757323,5,B005LAII7G,"As a fan of the various Judge Dredd comic series, Karl Urban and company do an excellent job capturing the atmosphere of the original comics. Not only does Urban, really embody the character, the story brilliantly doesn't try to do too much with the storyline and keeps it a simple fight between Dredd and evil and the development of Anderson. With the Mega City One series underway and off-and-on again talks of a sequel, I can only hope that true fans get to see Urban reprise this role at least once more.  Additionally, this is a really good action film. Even non-fans of the comic should enjoy how well this movie is made.",1522281600,,627,4.548672566371682

4757454,3,B005LAII7G,"Great story, plot and acting, but if you buy 3d blu rays for the 3d, you may be disappointed. Read reviewer Jin Choung's excellent explanation of the problem below. Lighting levels, reflections, grain, etc. differ in much of the film between right and left eye views, causing a ""wow wow"" effect, where your eyes can't quite merge the two images. This does not happen during the slo-mo CGI sequences, where the 3d is EXCELLENT. When the 3d is good, it's really good, but for the vast majority of the film, the 3d is inexcusably bad. Not the fault of the disk itself, but the cinematographer (his first 3d project). In many scenes, there is no dimension whatsoever, even when characters are in a long hallway. But it's the reflections, as Jin Choung's review notes, that make this hard to watch. They appear everywhere throughout the film in one eye only, making you blink and try to focus your eyes. In one of the featurettes, the filmmaker discusses how he wanted to use 3d in a new, revolutionary way. He should have gotten a handle on the basics of stereoscopy first. Had to pause the film a dozen times before concluding that nothing I could do in my TV settings (LG OLED 65E6P) could fix the problem. Not a good 3d experience.",1520899200,,1230,4.570135746606335

4757650,5,B005LAII7G,"I didn't expect anything when I watched this movie. I had bad memories of the 1995 version, starring Sylvester Stallone. It's a lesser-known comic property. I noticed some surprisingly good reviews. And the film surprises. Shot on a ""cheap"" action film budget ($45M), Karl Urban shines as a stoic and unemotional Dredd.

This isn't a talky sci-fi dystopian film. It's not an exposition-by-dialogue film. The dystopian, collapsing world is well-realized, and the Judges look great in their armored marching band outfits. Dredd is paired with an aspiring judge and psychic as his partner. It sounds corny; everything makes sense within the world, which doesn't spell everything out and lets you make your assessments based on the visuals they give you.

The inimitable Lena Headey plays the primary antagonist, with help from one of ""The Wire's"" criminal alumni. Most of the action takes place in a concrete slum hellscape that looks like 1970s public housing as realized by a mall construction firm. It's both wide and claustrophobic, with Dredd and his partner left to sort things out. The plot is basic but it doesn't matter. This is an outlier within the saturated comic realm, with its crossovers and slow build-up. After all, the average comic film uses one film to launch the character, a second to allow for a major conflict, then splits the bloated conclusion into two films to grab that extra ticket and DVD/Blu-Ray sale. Sequels may follow, but this film is pretty self-contained and allows you the option of a mindless actioner or a careful viewing to dissect a thoroughly awful world of an advanced civilization with premier technology that's also collapsing on a civil and environmental basis.",1516060800,,1705,5.085714285714285

The basic story was simple but effective.  Criminals in the future go to much greater lengths to control the city and drug rings, as do the judges in their pursuit, and corruption runs deep.

Dredd is a fantastic movie that captures the essence of the graphic novels and the dark and hopeless elements of the few judges that fight the criminal elements of Mega-City One.

The plot is pretty simple. This is primarily an action movie, so don't expect a super deep plot, but trust me, it's worth watching. The first 15 minutes sets the stage of Mega-City One before moving into the confines of the Peach Trees Living block controlled by the Ma-Ma Clan, a group of vicious criminals led by the fantastic Lena Headey, who some may know better as Cersei Lannister of Game of Thrones fame. And believe it or not, Ma-Ma is a far more sadistic character. Dredd, with his rookie partner Anderson, respond to a murder report from Peach Trees. What follows is a solid run of action paced at just the right speed, escalating at just the right amount as Dredd and his rookie partner bring law to the lawless. I don't think any more needs to be said than that.

This is not the Dredd Stallone played. This is ""THE"" Judge Dredd. And Karl Urban plays him fantastically. If you want a pretty good movie full of some awesome action, this one will do nicely.",1513296000,,1292,4.493617021276596

4757818,5,B005LAII7G,"Dredd is a 2012 science fiction action film directed by Pete Travis and written and produced by Alex Garland. It is based on the 2000AD comic strip Judge Dredd and it's eponymous character created by John Wagner and Carlos Ezquerra. Karl Urban stars as Judge Dredd, a law enforcer given the power of judge, jury, and executioner in a vast, dystopic metropolis called Mega-City One that lies in a post-apocalyptic wasteland. The film's plot revolves around Dredd and his apprentice partner, Judge Anderson (played by Olivia Thirlby) having to bring order to a 200 story high rise block of flats and deals with it's resident drug lord, Ma-ma (played by Lena Headey), who has been distributing a drug known as slow-mo (a drug that slows down a user's perception down to 1%). It's probably no surprise that I love this film (a lot).

The actors did a highly commendable job. Karl Urban was excellent as Judge Dredd (definitely makes up for Stallone's version of Dredd). Olivia Thirlby was also fantastic. In many ways, this was just as much her movie as it was Dredd's. Lena Headey definitely made her character seem threatening, which is what a villain should be. The rest of the cast was great, too.

The costumes and set design was impressive. And the CGI, rivals the large budget films that come out of Hollywood today. The movie also has a large amount of practical effects. Also, the film managed to find a way to make 3D work. Rather than having dark cinematography and having things quickly fly at the camera. Here, the film, while having a more grimy color, looks much brighter, and there's also frequent splashes of yellow throughout the film. Also, the slow mo scenes, while overwhelmingly gory, there's an undeniable beauty to these scenes, which is rare for movies that involve slow-motion). The score, done by Paul Leonard Morgan, was quite interesting. Rather than having a bombastic, orchestral score (like the 1995 film), we get a very industrial sounding score. For the slow motion scenes, the score goes from high-tech to slow, dreary and dream-like. A funny story for this. The inspiration for the slow mo music actually came from an audio file on soundcloud where someone took the Justin Bieber song, ""You Smile"", and slowed it down by 800%. They made their own music in the style of this fan-edit. So they didn't have to pay Bieber any licensing fees. I also loved that the film didn't mess around and went full on with the R-rating. Another thing I loved is that this film was much closer to the comics than the 1995 film.

As for the flaws, none of them have to do with the film itself (the film is (in my opinion), nearly flawless). It more has to do with how the film is treated here in the US. The film suffered from poor marketing. It was strictly marketed in 3D. So people had to drive miles to see a 2D showing. It also didn't help that people here thought this would be a sequel to the 1995 film. It was also criticized for being too similar to The Raid: Redemption. However, Dredd was made before The Raid, yet released After. So what's the real ripoff here? The film (sadly) underperformed at the box-office (earning $41 million on a budget of around $45 million dollars). However, it was getting great critical reviews. Dredd eventually saw greater success when the film was released on blu-ray and DVD.

Dredd was an amazing film. It has excellent acting, awesome action, score, and direction. Just like the 1995 film, it was only 95 minutes long, and never boring in the slightest. Dredd deserves every bit of praise it's gotten. Just everything about this movie was excellent. On a scale of 0 to 10, I give Dredd 3D a 10/10. Not only a great action movie, but one of the best comic book adaptations. I highly recommend this film to everyone. If you want a film that actually has action, has 2 badass protagonists, and fantastic acting and effects. This is clearly the film to watch.",1512864000,,3915,4.6695652173913045

4757822,5,B005LAII7G,"The most underrated action movie of it's year, and many others. So sad that this failed for whatever reason. Largely unknown cast ?(at the time, of course, Urban and Headey are now quite known) , or perhaps because it's a reboot? an edgier grittier reboot, to say the least and in the BEST way. One thing for sure Lionsgate did a horrific job promoting this film. Or there was a terrible taste left in the publics mouths after ""Judge Dredd"" many years earlier. (a truly awful mess). This run at Dredd absolutely slays. Not for everyone and definitely not for the kiddies, it...is....violent. Before there was Deadpool taking an uber violent comicbook to the big screen, there was...Dredd. In addition it's also one of the best 3d, gasp  YES I said 3d, flicks as well! seriously the 3d in this film is extremely well done, I have both the 3d copy and now that I have a 4k set bought the Ultra HD. Dredd was marketed as a 3d movie at the end of the 3d gimmick's height, which probably didn't help ticket sale either. Whatever the reason I'm glad it has done so well in dvd sales and has become quite a bit of a Cult Classic. Highly recommended.",1511654400,2,1142,4.438095238095238

I got it as a 7 dollar steal, but it has 2 main problems: It runs I'm guessing a very special and non-widely used 2D and 3D system, that prevents this from playing on most players except high end, and up to date players. On the PC side, this movie only plays in Cyberlink Power DVD.

Quality wise, It is a bit disturbing that the 2D version looks about the same as the iTunes HD version, although the audio is of course much more superior.

I'd recommend you get the 3D version  and the 2D version separately for maximum compatibility.

This looks great if you're looking in 3D though, the contrast and picture quality in 3D is amazing, it just doesnt translate well to 2D only.",1508198400,,748,4.246478873239437

4758058,3,B005LAII7G,"Dredd is a film based on the comic Judge Dredd. The plot is set in a post-apocalyptic world, in which one gigantic mega-city has survived some kind of nuclear holocaust which left most of the world an irradiated desert. Curiously, life in Mega-City One goes on much like before, with skyscrapers, cars, lousy jobs and a lot of gang violence. The thin blue line against complete anarchy is the Hall of Justice and its judges, cops entitled to condemn and execute criminals on the spot. The concept has been filmed before  remember Sylvester Stallone and Max von Sydow?

I know this is supposed to be science fiction, but sometimes Dredd feels like a documentary about 2017 Detroit. Or is it Chicago? Seriously, though, I didn't find this film *that* interesting. The main character isn't macho enough, the villain doesn't look villainous enough, and many characters are too well-fed and have too fancy uniforms for a post-apocalyptic hellscape. Virtually the entire plot takes place inside a sealed building, in which villain Ma-Ma's gang is trying to hunt down two judges, one of them telepathic. The politically correct angles feel forced, especially since the head crook is a woman, and the judges (who kill or imprison people simply for being there) are supposedly The Law And That's A Good Thing. There are also some plot holes.

I know this was a popular flick, but personally I would give it three stars and that only barely. Please don't sentence me to an isolation cube!",1506816000,,1478,4.8804780876494025

I figured it would be another meh remake that Hollywood likes to dish out at us and decided to wait to catch it on dvd. Boy was I ever wrong. The 1995 Judge Dredd with Stalone was a fun campy movie but this movie but this movie takes Dredd to a whole other level. This is an over-the-top action flick and I can't wait for a sequel.

The movie is presented in 2:40 anamorphic widescreen and is a solid nice looking transfer. Audio options include English 5.1 and Spanish 5.1 tracks. There are English and Spanish subtitles.

The dvd also has a generous amount of extras. The extra I enjoyed the most is the 14 minute Mega City Masters: 35 Years of Judge Dredd. A retrospective of the comic that inspired the film. There is also the 15 minute Day of Chaos:Visual Effects. There are four other featurettes that clock in around 2 minutes each: Dredd, Dredd's Gear, 3rd Dimension, and Welcome to Peachtrees.

Due to ballooning costs, there are usually a few decent action scenes but they're broken up with generic story. Many movies are about cartoonish characters learning lessons that don't really resonate with the viewer.

Dredd doesn't fall into any of these pitfalls.

The film spends very little time setting up its presence and then launches into nearly uninterrupted action. The movie has a coherent story but its an action driven film through-and-through. The relationships of the characters in the story are believable but they don't fall into the cliche story beats. The action itself is intense, beautiful, and graphic. This is one of the best action films of the last decade easily. I say film because it is one. While the action has broad and exciting appeal, this is clearly a work of art.

It sucks because I kinda liked the way this movie looked in theaters and on regular DVD on a non 4K tv, and the bad looking parts are very noticeable since the other half of scenes that look good, look really good.
Any way, I love the movie,  way better than Judge Dredd with Stalone, this is the gritty modern remake with Karl Urban (Judge Dredd) and Lena Headey (as the drug kingpin Ma-Ma) and it doesnt dissapoint.

4758469,5,B005LAII7G,"Oh, how I wish I'd seen this in theaters when I had the chance.

Let's be clear, I've not read a single page of 2000 AD. Nor have I read any of the numerous American attempts (DC, IDW) to bring the Judge over seas to our shores. So I'm really going into this blind. I never saw the original Judge Dredd either, though apparently this was for the best.

I've always been drawn to the character of Judge Dredd. Visually, he's just fascinating.

Well, it turns out the dark, dystopian city he and the other judges inhabit is equally fascinating. The movie, which has been compared to The Raid (which I've never seen), stars Judge Dredd as he takes a rookie Judge Anderson, who is a mutant gifted with psychic abilities, on her final test before she becomes officially a Judge.

The two get called out to a mega block tower, a slum that is ruled by the drug lord Ma-Ma. Dredd and Anderson, hoping to respond to their initial call while also shutting down a source of Slow-Mo, the drug Ma-Ma pushes, only to find that they are sealed inside the mega block. Now, following orders from Ma-Ma to kill the judges on sight, the pair have to find a way out while also shutting down Ma-Ma for good.

The movie, much like the comic that inspired it, covers a lot of surprisingly complex ground in terms of subject matter, from matters of martial law and police brutality to the simple empathy that Anderson brings with her, this movie covers some interesting ground.

It helps that in addition to its heavy subject matter, the movie is serviced with some intense action and some fantastic special effects, especially when you consider how little a budget this movie had when you compare it to the action-comic blockbusters produced today.

In short, Dredd is an amazing movie. If you haven't seen this yet, I definitely recommend you do.",1492387200,,1824,4.576687116564417

The movie itself is great, that's why I bought this disc - for the digital download.

I bought this disc to get the code and watch the movie in 3D. The digital download gave me a 2D version from VUDU. Not just that the service is locked to US but it gave me a version I did not want. Apparently it is not possible to redeem 3D movies on UltraViolet.

And even if it would be, the VUDU player does not play 3D on PC.

Never happened on any other movie. The 3D is great for the city scene's and the Slo-mo action scenes, but not as great as some people make it out to being in the best 10 3D movies out there. The only problem is the the 3D and 5.1 surround sound. Who ever mixed this movie down did a crap job of it. They made all the bullets come from the back speakers instead of a mix of in the back and in front of you. The volume overload on the bullets rivals Saving Private Ryan in terms of loudness.

There is no way to gauge Urban's performance, other than it is robotic and bears comparisons to Peter Weller's old Robocop character .. but robotic seems to be the way most ""judges"" are wired. The real knockout performance is delivered by Lena Headey as Ma-Ma, the vicious arch-villain and drug kingpin . She is superb.

Stellar acting on all parts, amazing cinematography, and very accurate depiction of what the comic book authors intended. Definitely under-rated in my humble opinion. Karl Urban and Olivia Thirlby are perfect together on screen. One of my favorite movies from both actors.

The violence doesn't ever seem excessive given the scenarios the characters are in. It is a bit gruesome, but I feel like that's what was lacking in modern comic based movies. An ""R"" rated movie for mature audiences for sure, but a must-see for those that enjoy a more gritty and dark style of film.

4759897,4,B005LAII7G,"This movie caught me totally by surprise. It showed up unannounced in my Amazon Prime list in 2013 and on a whim I decided to try it out.

Its amazing. Forget the Stallone version and most other dark comic-to-film- or game-to-film movies. This ones the real deal. Its dark, gritty, well paced, clever, and brutal. Its also the first movie Ive ever watched at home and found myself saying, Now, that movie would really look good in 3-D!

An interesting thing about that last comment is that most of the movie is spent on the inside of a vast urban city tower, running up and down corridors, shooting things and people up. But the way the movie is photographed, edited, and choreographed you don't have a tiresome boring by-the-numbers floor-by-floor fight-fest like The Raid. In Dredd you know where you are and where the bad guys are at all times. You get plot twists tossed at you but the logic of Dredds inevitable judgment is inescapable.

Karl Urban adds another capstone to a lustrous action career thet now includes not only Dredd but Lord of the Rings, Chronicles of Riddick, and Priest. And you never get to see his eyes under that helmet!

Lena Heady proves again she is well on her way to becoming the go-to actor for psychopathic female leaders. This woman does not fool around and is just plain fun to watch. I would love to see her play a character up against Alice in the next Resident Evil movie.

The movie is very well photographed. Scenes are interestingly but not ostentatiously framed. Lighting is such that, even when shadows abound, you can always see what is going on. I especially loved the coloring; much use is made of yellow, orange, and gold, in contrast to the washed out blues and greens weve grown accustomed to in so many fantasy and science fiction films.

Think about the lighting from the early scenes in Blade Runner, especially the scenes of the exterior and interior of the Tyrell Corporation. Then apply that to a gritty vertical city constructed from hundreds of layers of cheesy and decaying urban shopping malls. But sort of pretty, if you know what I mean?

This is a violent movie. Its R-rating is well-deserved. Maybe thats why it didn't do better at the box office. I suspect, though, that now that its more widely available a lot more people are going to discover it.",1473206400,11,2314,4.643031784841075
4759898,4,B005LAII7G,Love this movie! 80's quality action in a modern skin.,1473120000,,54,4.5
4759899,5,B005LAII7G,"Perhaps the greatest example of an under-the-radar movie. The movie that should have been seen by everyone was seen by almost no one. Its unfortunate release date a week after the absolutely horrible The Amazing Spider-Man, didn't give it enough room to find an audience in the era of Mega-Weekend Blockbusters. Bad flashbacks to Stallones repugnant adaptation, Judge Dredd, also kept many away.

The good news is since its release to streaming and home video, Dredd has managed to scratch out a cult status completely worthy of the film. Although this does little to soothe the I need it now bean counters running movie studios, it does give the film a credibility which far outlasts that of many, many far more financially successful but completely forgotten films. There are even some rumblings about a sequel.

Dredd puts all the pieces together and in every way demonstrates exactly how a comic book movie should be made. It follows all the rules, the most important being remaining faithful to the source material. Karl Urban plays Judge Dredd to perfection, channeling Eastwoods Dirty Harry to create the perfect, unstoppable legal killing machine.

As with nearly every movie on this list, the director is the key and the direction of Pete Travis is superb. The plot revolves around a new narcotic called Slo-Mo. The drug causes the user to experience everything at an incredibly reduced speed. The excessive violence, when merged with the effects of the drug, creates a bloody, yet beautiful, cinematic ballet.

Forced into action Dredd and his partner, Judge Anderson (Olivia Thirlby), move through a murderous video game-like gauntlet in pursuit of the the wretchedest of villains. The action is relentless and, within the context of the story, completely plausible.

If you have not seen this movie, get it. Tonight. Your assessment begins now.",1473033600,,1856,5.112211221122112
4759950,5,B005LAII7G,"This movie is bad ass! The plot is simple and concise, the characters are perfect, and Karl Urban kills it as Dredd. He is intimidating and dangerous, but he is also human, with limitations to his abilities. The movies actions scenes are gorgeous and brutal. It is very similar to The Raid: Redemption, with minimal story but awesome characters and set pieces. Check out this film for that bad ass void thats missing in your life.",1473033600,,430,4.671052631578948

The left eye has a slightly different contrast level in the bright areas, causing a distracting shimmering effect. It's similar to when you wear polarized 3D glasses in the real world. This film was shot in 3D, so I'm surprised this was a problem. I returned the disc because I would never watch this in 3D again.

4759957,1,B005LAII7G,"Ok, I was bored-very bored when I decided to watch this movie. I didn't expect much since I knew this and the version with Stallone were take-off's of a comic book series. Practically the entire movie takes place inside what is in reality an old University building in, I believe Johannesburg South Africa. The choice of buildings and location makes sense for a movie about a very dystopian future since Jo-Burg is one of the most violent cities on the face of the earth. The ""bomb doors"" and so on are, of course CGI effects and the whole flick is full of such effects.
  The film's plot revolves around the ""super hero"" cop/judge Dredd and his female psychic rookie assistant who become trapped inside this building while trying to meet out ""justice"" against a gang of illegal drug peddlers who actually run the whole building through the use of terror. If I say much more in this vein I will give away the ending, but you can probably guess that both protagonists survive, right?  As regards the acting; it is typical B movie level, but then again one has to consider the script they were given to work with.  The plot is simple: shoot the bad guy. No; really it is just that simple. And blood? Buckets of it everywhere- heads being blown up in ""glorious color"" and arms being shot off. It was even shown in 3D in the theaters in 2012. In the film the ""Judges"" are judge, jury and executioner all rolled up into one. God help us  if this ever were to become a reality. Watch it if you like blood, gore and no real plot. I am told that fans of the comic book series loved it. Whatever.",1471737600,,1587,4.402730375426621

The fact his helmet does not come off - for that typical hollywood'ism - makes the character that much more mysterious and iconic. The whole production of the film is not bent on a save the world vibe, but a glimpse of a grim future - and felt like more a short story in a rich universe (so its evocative for that).

I wish hollywood producers could be a bit more objective about the genre they're hoping to kickstart. Though this franchise has promise, it needs momentum - like a series format - to take off.",1471219200,2,644,4.322314049586777

From the start of Karl Urban's expositional narration and opening sequence, one starts to realize this movie is much darker, grittier, violent, and bleak. It has great visual effects including one of the most ingenious uses of high speed photography as a storytelling device.

This movie is about Judge Dredd, but it also shows the perspective and evolution of another officer; an evolution from who we knew in the beginning to someone else by the end (like I said, no spoilers).

Not for the faint of heart; I found the violence in this movie extreme, but it's a part of this society that is being portrayed so I am fine with that. Just fair warning that there is a lot of graphic violence in this movie.

The final thing I will say is that most movies like these appeal mostly to male audiences, but there are three women in this film that prove not all women are damsels in distress or just sexual objects. So female audiences will feel empowered by these strong women.

4760522,1,B005LAII7G,"I got suckered by the hype of this pile of trash. I admit it.

Kind of the warning sign to me that I need to think before I go blindly into watching flicks recommended by professional critics and comic book nerds.

Everyone in the cult of Dredd is kind of weird. It's something I don't understand anymore. I guess I missed the appeal of Karl Urban gunning down random poor people/criminals in a apartment building while Lena Headey sits around doing nasty things to people.

About the only thing that seems to get anything out of me is Anderson played by Olivia Thirlby, who is the only character with a real arc or background besides maybe Headey and one of her random hired guns in the building who we only find out is a family man.

Otherwise everyone else is about as faceless and badly written as you can get.  Best of all is your growling main character who is wearing the helmet because the comic book nerds demand he keeps it on throughout or else!

Urban's performance closely resembles a bad Clint Eastwood impersonation, I mean this guy does a killer Deforest Kelly one in Start Trek, but can't pull off a Eastwood, that's shameful.

Even his role in Priest seemed to feel like Gary Oldman or something, and he excelled at it. Here, he's kind of just eh.

I'm not going to blabber about how violent the movie is, because why bother, plenty complain about it on here as it is. The violence is rather over the top, which is an underestimate really. I kind of wonder if the MPAA was asleep at the wheel when rating this movie, I mean they gave Killer Joe such a freaking hard time the previous year before this one.  But this one, they apparently didn't care.

I think if anything, Deadpool showed this movie up in the R-rated comic book movie contest, I mean it actually succeeded and raked in the money and got people hooked. This  did not, and I have to fault the writers of this movie for making a movie with no really background or anything to it or barely any existing.  They made it hard for anyone to really get hooked into anything about this character.

I mean that's something that even Stallone did better, he gave something to the character, an arc, something, Yeah, he had to tone the violence down and make it cheesy and put Robbie the idiot front and center. That was back when Robbie the Idiot was getting his 10 seconds of attempted fame, before getting sentenced to only Adam Sandler movies and DTV land. Robbie the Idiot had also been in Demolition Man, which was a better movie than Stallone's Dredd, but it nailed the satire and humor that really is missing in this movie.

Frankly only Paul Verhoven seemed to nail this kind of nasty witty humor in his films like Total Recall, Robocop. Robocop is based on Dredd and is probably the best adaptations that never was for it. This movie barely has any humor to it, it's too busy trying to be sober and serious. Even Stallone's Dredd seemed to know it wanted to be a satire or something besides dour and dull.

Slow-mo is a horrible device for a writer to create to justify endless slow motion action scenes or violence scenes. You know if you wanted to be John Woo, just be freaking John Woo, it's not going to kill you not to have some lame plot device to explain your love for slow motion shootings! It's infuriating that the drugs couldn't of been something that wasn't so stupid and hard to say with a straight face.

Armand Assante eats the scenery of the original movie and Headey just soaks in baths and tortures and cuts things off of people. She really just acts smug throughout, and it's a boring smug, not very entertaining to watch or even be invested in.

The special effects look cheap and crappy, the costumes look rather cheap as well. One shot of the city they included I swear basically could have been stolen from Blade Runner. That probably would have saved CGI money. You can create a future city and not make it look like Blade Runner, be more original with your design movie, for god's sakes. And we barely see any of the city as it is.

I would say the movie's action scenes are something to watch, but they aren't either. Not when 2012 had End of Watch, Skyfall, Django Unchained, Premium Rush, Jack Reacher, The Expendables 2, The Raid. Then again even Act of Valor and Safe House had better action scenes, because I actually freaking cared about the characters in the movie.
And it's kind of pointless for me if I don't really care who lives or who dies in the action scenes. I mean everyone is nearly detestable, maybe the computer hacker guy and Anderson are about it. I really thought they should of just offed Dredd at the end of this movie, good ending, instead some weak Deus Ex Machina patch helps him live. BOO!

Finally, the fanboys of this movie are insufferable people. I understand the fact that you like it, that's nice, I don't. Please stop wearing others out because they don't. These fans are also very desperate for a sequel, apparently never coming. I doubt also Netflix is springing for a series about this. You're not Marvel or DC owned, so forget it.  But the fans live in a blissfully ignorant world of thinking a sequel is going to be popped into production anytime now.

Lionsgate is a really B-level movie company, they produce cheap action movies and their biggest claims to fame are Hunger Games, Expendables, Twilight and independent movies usually action ones. In some ways, they are to me like Cannon Films. Cheap, predictable action pumped out for the action fan to look at and forget the next moment. I realize they are only distributing this movie, but really it seems no different than any of their other B-level action gore fests. The only difference is that Jason Statham isn't in it or some aging action star.

It's rather sad to see this type of potentially great movie squandered by being nothing but a paint by the numbers action flick. I mean the source material could warrant a better version than Stallone, but it would have to be someone with a witty, sharp humor level.

By the way the score is a wretched John Carpenter sound a like, which is insulting as it gets. I guess ripping off is the sincerest form of flattery.

My opinion on this pile of whatever. What a disappointment that only caters to weird fans of this comic book and even they couldn't bother to actively go see it well enough or even spread a good word about it. But part of me thinks Lionsgate knew they had a dud on their hands so they sabotaged it anyway to sink it fast. By the way, if you want a good R-rated Comic Book action movie, there's a whole list of them: Watchmen, Sin City 1 or 2, Blade 1 or 2, Deadpool, hell for obscure foreign movie watchers, Lone wolf and Cub is a particularly violent and exciting Manga/Comic adaptation made in the early 70s that is pretty good.",1464134400,2,6802,4.489068825910931

I'm watching the since cancelled TV series Almost Human at the moment in which Urban is the star and really he's not much of an actor but from what I remember of the comics he did Judge Dredd in his fascist OTT the law is the law shtick very well.

 I didn't remember the movie being as humorous as it was too a few times I burst out laughing at Dredd's monosyllabic responses. The soundtrack stood out for me and the brutality of some of the violence like when those skinned bodies hit the ground. The landscape shots of the dystopian Mega City One are incredible too.

4761136,3,B005LAII7G,"First I'd like to say that in regards to the movie, I actually like the movie fine. I've seen the movie before, and here's the thing. Of your gonna compare this movie to a great action movie, or are expecting to see something original or memorable, this may not be your cup of tea. But if you are aware and are expecting to see an action movie consisted of a fast pace, action, violence, 1 man army sort of thing, then I think this is right up your alley. I remember seeing the Stallone dredd movie as a kid, and although I can't really remember too much of it (I keep thinking of demolition man for some reason), I can assure you this is nothing like that movie. If anything I would say the original Cranked movie reminds me of dredd in a way. This movie is a solid B- to B movie, which is what I was expecting which would have been a 4 star movie Amazon reivew on its own. The reason that I give it 3 stars is because of the inclusion of the 3D advertising. When I bought this movie, it was on sale and below $10, I didn't have the movie and felt it was worth it for that price. When I opened to watch the movie in 3D, I it was the first time I'd ever seen a 3D bluray movie which did not have the 3D bluray and regular Bluray seperated. In this case, they both come on one disc. So I pop it in my bluray player and start watching in 3D. I had seen the movie without 3D before and was eager to see the movie with the inclusion of 3D since so many action sequences of the movie were made with 3D in mind. 20 minutes in, I was dissapointed, and 30 minutes in, I had a headache and switched it back. From all the 3d movies that I've owned, this was definitely the worst. Reminds me of when 3D first came out and I had an early active 3D enabled samsung tv with terrible ghosting on the images. If this 3D bluray would have cost more than $10, I would have given it 2 stars. Still, you should probably watch it in 2D.",1456876800,2,1915,3.9895833333333335

4761320,4,B005LAII7G,"I will say right off that I enjoyed this film. I know nothing about the origins of the Judge Dredd character, whether it is from comic books or what have you, but I enjoyed the action in the dark, futuristic city of hopelessness.

Karl Urban is the stony, droll Judge Dredd. Judges in this dystopian future city have complete power of judge, jury and executioner. They are tasked with attempting to dispense justice in a post-apocalyptic world and maintaining order. Each judge is not only a conventional law enforcement officer, they are almost futuristic soldiers with specialized weaponry that will fire incendiary, armor-piercing and high-explosive rounds.

In this film, Dredd is assigned a rookie to assess as to her suitability as a new judge. This one is a marginal candidate but with a twist - she's a mutant with psychic ability. The Judge and his rookie find themselves trapped in a giant living complex inhabited by tens of thousands of people - and the Mama Gang.

Action and adventure galore await the viewer as Judge Dredd and his rookie (played by Olivia Thirlby) find themselves at war with hundreds of gang members led by ""Mama"" played by Lena Headly. Although Headly and Thirlby do an acceptable job in their roles, Urban carries off the part of Judge Dredd quite well as it could easily have been a cartoonish character. Instead, he pulls it off without being a caricature.

Now, I will say, the special effects are quite well done, the sets are reasonably well made to represent a world where the current one we live in has aged and is crumbling and is augmented by massive living units - almost reminiscent of Soviet apartments. The weaponry is suitably impressive - the miniguns destroying an entire floor is visually impressive. The only things I really didn't like was the overly bloody special effects of bullets entering bodies, bodies falling from great heights to smash against the floor, etc.

On the whole, it was a good action film that had few deadspots in the action and held my interest from start to finish. A good action flick that I recommend with four stars.",1454976000,,2097,4.797783933518006

I'm told the 3D version looks excellent, but I haven't seen it on the disc. The 2D version, not so much. One shot or scene goes from crystal clear and looks very, very good. The next shot (usually, if not always the darker shots) goes to noisy digitally and grainy. It's actually very noticeable and pretty darn distracting. Other say the opposite. But it's very distracting to me. I would give the movie 4 stars. But the grainy scenes that come and go through the whole movie is pretty disappointing. I do wonder how the regular DVD looks.

The setting was very gritty, dirty, dark, and dank - makes you want to take a shower after watching it. It's not a movie for everyone, but I I understand why it didn't do better at the box office.

Why?  Swagger,  catch phrases,  impossible stunts... most modern action movies lose their sense of believability and immersion in spectacular effects and extreme stunts.  Dredd, however, truly delivers a feeling of near anarchy, brutal living conditions, and truly evil villains.  Megacity is a place you can actually believe possible.  Dredd does not ham it up.  Instead, he is as unflinching, cold, and efficient as he is supposed to be.

It's a f***ing travesty that Jem and the Holograms gets green lit but this movie doesn't have a sequel.  Dredd is what action movies should be.",1447200000,,767,5.096774193548387

4761961,5,B005LAII7G,very quick and excellent item.,1445299200,,30,5.2
4761962,5,B005LAII7G,"This is an amazing movie.  The only thing bad about it is the ridiculously poor marketing campaign that failed to get people into the theater to see it.  I am stunned that such a quality movie could have been overlooked by the movie-going public like this.  I've had several friends whom I had to coax into watching this movie who were absolutely blown away by it.  It's that good.  Just give it a chance!

Now, a caveat--this is a hard-R action film, which means the violence is pretty brutal and the filmmakers don't pull any punches.  That said, it's not torture porn; the violence is all part of the plot and very believable within the story.  I personally HATE torture porn movies like Hostel, etc., so if you're worried about it being that kind of movie don't be.  The main focus of the story is on Judge Dredd and Judge Anderson taking on the sociopathic drug-dealing gang that controls the Peachtrees mega-block in the most badass way imaginable.

Speaking of bad, Karl Urban is a bad, bad man.  He IS Judge Dredd.  Urban plays the Judge perfectly, as someone committed to law and justice even though he has to slog in the muck of crime and exploitation nearly 24-7.  Urban also brings a much-needed low-key sense of humor to the proceedings.  This is hardly a laugh-a-minute fun ride but some of Urban's facial expressions and one-liners provide a welcome break in the tension.

The tension is there because the movie is so well-paced.  You will not look at your watch once during this movie.  You will not be bored.  It is not action for the sake of actions.  There are sufficiently-high stakes and Lena Headey's Ma-Ma is evil enough that you will be rooting for the judges the whole time.  But Headey's Ma-Ma is not a cartoon villain; the filmmakers provide enough of a backstory on her so you can see where she's come from, why she is who she is, and why she did what she had to do to control Peachtrees.  She's still evil, of course, but the evil you understand is sometimes more terrifying than the evil you can't.

Olivia Thirlby isn't just eye candy here, either, although she is of course very attractive.  Her character (who has psychic abilities) has the biggest (only?) character arc of the film.  Everyone else is pretty much who they are through the entire movie except for Thirlby's Judge Anderson, whose experience in the ""deep end"" changes her from a naive, nervous rookie to a potent colleague.  The psychic abilities are handled very well; they aren't laughable and they aren't throwaway.  Her experience in the head of Ma-Ma's captured lieutenant is gripping.

I simply don't re-watch movies, but I've watched this movie at least five times.  If you're not turned off by violence, it's a lot of fun, and Urban's Dredd holds it all together.  I'm just disappointed that the poor box office probably means that there will not be a sequel.  Because if any movie deserves one, it's Dredd.",1445212800,,2912,4.664047151277014

First of all there is no story, at least not one that you can follow.  Second, the action scenes are forever chasing actions scenes and none of them are exciting or seem to have purpose.

4762249,5,B005LAII7G,"If you wanna show off how good home 3-D Movies are  Dredd 3D should be one of those tech demos
I've actually gathered a good size of 3-D BR's over the last year and I still think
this film cracks my top 5 films to own and show off on home  3-D
Mostly cause the 3-D isn't a gimmick it serves a purpose to the film something you don't get with 65% of all the films put out in the theaters now
3D is slapped on them just to hike up ticket prices
I seen this film in the theater over-payed for real3D
but, I'm glad I seen it loved it they don't make films like this anymore really once in a while every know and then
you'll get hard rated ""R"" Alpha male type films like Dredd 3-D, Mad Max Fury Road, but, it's not nearly often enough

The film looks stunning the 3-D is used as a plot device to explain the drug people are  taking which slows down time
flat out brilliant
almost everything is digital F/X I hate digital f/x but, they did such a bang-up job i let it go everything looks so real and organic
You can just tell the director actual gave a damn about the original source material
This film wasn't made to help revive a ageing actor's career like the first Judge Dredd
This film was a massive apology to everyone who seen the first film and the comics fans
Dredd 3-D is a real deal dark adult film that pulls no punches

Karl Urban  as  (Judge Dredd)  great casting he has to prove he can act in this flick and he does....
Karl Urban isn't mugging for the camera he looks angry! he never takes of the helmet he is the proper Dredd we never got in the 1990's
he own's it

 Olivia Thirlby  (as Anderson) Rookie Anderson before she became a Judge
i didn't know her work previously to this flick but, they dyed her hair blond and cut it the right way and she looks very much like Judge Anderson
I thought she did a very good job she is the only Judge through-out the film that isn't wearing the helmet
which I guess makes sense since she's like a beat cop and you get the helmet when you become a Judge (been a long time since i read any Judge Dredd books)

then you have the simply amazing
Lena Headey  as the new top drug dealer of Mega City  Ma-Ma
who is pushing the ""hot"" new street drug known as slo-mo

The film is simple Dredd being one of the top Cops aka Judges has to take the new rookie Anderson out for her first day on the beat in Mega City
and that day becomes the longest shift in police history
Dredd & Anderson get locked into one of the massive apartment buildings that Ma-Ma controls
Ma-Ma puts a bounty on both the Judge's heads so the two must survive until back-up arrives
and let me tell  you this slummed out apartment building is crawling with shady people armed to the teeth with crazy guns and weapons

The film is super violent
I'm a little shocked they got away with so much of the gore
I guess the MPAA know longer watch movies here in the US ???
Which is a good thing to bad they weren't sleeping from 1986 to 1994 though
I Love this film it's such a rare animal in this day and age a action film that's rated ""R""
and you can see why it got the ""R""  9.8/10
I wish the BR had more special features by know i thought they would've put out a second Collector's Edition version

4762253,5,B005LAII7G,"There are few movies that I watch over and over again within a years time and ""Dredd"" is one of them. I never read the comics and the previous Judge Dredd movie is probably not in my top 100 films to watch but this movie is amazing. It not only portrays a modern day comic book movie but is an addiction to watch. The action and special effects are feniminal but the characters and acting is incredible. So here's a little about the movie without any spoilers:

Dredd as well as a rookie judge who also has psi capability enter a block city which is a huge building that serves as a gigantic apartment complex to investigate the death of three individuals. Upon investigating they take a prisoner which in turn causes the entire block being shut down and them being hunted by a gang called the Mama Clan.
I don't want to give anything away and if your a fan of the comics I'm sure you can elaborate on some other qualities the movie brings but from my point of view this is a movie that deserved more credit in the theaters than it did. If your looking for something that accelerates your adrenaline and gives you a great escape in a post apocalyptic world this movie is it.

However, Marvel can sometimes make their movies too funny (or too kiddie) or they can scale things up so massively that you lose your emotional connection to the characters.

You won't find either of those issues here.  Dredd is a bad a** movie.  Blood, guts, violence, no hold bars (exactly what it would be if this setting was non-fiction).  This movie is not for kids; I repeat not for kids!  This is an adult comic book based film that is highly enjoyable.  I own it in 3D, and it's what I use to show off my t.v. :).  The slow-mo sequences are visually amazing, and one of the best 3D renditions of any scene EVER!  I highly recommend this movie to those with strong stomachs, comic book lovers, and those with a 3D TV.  If you fall into one (or all) of these categories, stop reading this and buy this movie!",1439769600,,988,4.397790055248619

The dialogue is often droll and Urban delivers his lines in a wonderfully deadpan monotone. The performances from the other two leads (Headey and Thirlby) are also perfectly pitched. The slow-motion photography, which can easily be misused, is implemented here to very good effect and is impressively constructed. It also has a banging soundtrack thats spot on for the material.

I'd rather see a great movie than care how much it makes. Adam Sandler has never made a watchable movie and he always is box office king, so what does that tell you? In my book Dredd is one of the best action movies ever made, up there with Man of Steel, Christopher Nolans Batman Trilogy, Total Recall, Terminator 2, Cliff Hanger, and the Specialist. I was a fan of the comic growing up and it was really satisfying to see that universe finally get its just dues. I give credit and thanks to all who made it possible.

It is amazing to see how even though the movie wasn't a big budget one, the producers and director created amazing special effects that enhance the story and movie experience.
The especial effects are there to serve the movie, not the other way around as countless of soulless big budget movies do.
Dredd reminded me of The Matrix, the first movie where the special effects served the movie. (Bullet Time)
The other 2 movies from the Matrix trilogy were terrible, all special effects, no much of a story.

4762744,5,B005LAII7G,"Theres a moment about forty five minutes into Pete Traviss Dredd where the titular lawman stalks out of a fiery inferno - in order to pitch a bad guy off of an interior balcony of the labyrinthine city-block in which the majority of the film is set - and then stalks back into the fire to continue meting out justice. Shot for shot, the sequence could be drawn directly from one of Judge Dredd illustrator Carlos Ezquerras comic panels: the look, the framing, the colour palette, Karl Urbans posture, attitude and entire demeanour  hell, the entire thing  is a labour of love.

And in that sequence lies the secret to Dredds success as a film  namely, unlike the excruciatingly bad Sylvester Stallone vehicle that preceded it, everyone involved in bringing this incarnation of Mega-City Ones favourite stony-faced lawman to life understands exactly what it is that makes the legendary 2000AD  comic strip work, and theyve taken those qualities and amplified them ten-fold. The Mega-City One of this film is a barely functioning megalopolis teetering on the edge of absolute chaos; a frighteningly seamy combination of East LA and Mogadishu; in a city in which only 6% of the crime can ever be addressed due to chronic under-staffing in the Justice department, the absolute hard-line ruthlessness of the Judges really is the only logical solution. Sure, they may be fascistic, but given the alternative, Dredd and co. really are the solution that you need to deal with the problem.

Karl Urban spectacularly nails the character of Joe Dredd: I grew up reading 2000AD from the first issue and take it from someone who can reel off a fictional mythology that stretches back nearly thirty-six years, Urban IS Dredd. During the entire time that I read the comic, I could never satisfactorily decide what Dredd would sound like  a Dirty Harry era Clint Eastwood impersonation would have been too obvious  but upon hearing Urbans gruff, clipped delivery I sat in awe because I finally knew EXACTLY how the character would sound; and when he intones the classic phrase that launched a thousand t-shirts, all memories of Stallones groan-inducing cry of AH UM THALAW! were smote from my memory. Urban IS the law and when he intones that immortal phrase, its not an emotive declaration - its a statement of fact: I am all there is and beyond me there is nothing. Cross the line and discover the painful truth of these words. Nothing else is open to discussion.

Likewise, Olivia Thirlby is absolutely note-perfect in her performance as Anderson. A lesser actress could have quite easily fallen into the trap of playing the rookie Judge as a wide-eyed Deer-in-the-headlights, but kudos to Thirlby, she imbues Anderson with a good deal of complexity. By no means is she inured to the immorality, violence and wholesale slaughter that surrounds her  as one particularly telling scene in which she painfully realises that shes addressing the unsuspecting wife of a man whom she has just summarily executed in the course of her duties  but neither does she shrink from the utter ruthlessness of which the Judges must be capable, as a scene in which she subjects a suspect to the psychic equivalent of an interrogation-room beating testifies.

And then theres the villain of the piece: Ma-Ma. Played to lithe, angular perfection by Lena Headey, Ma-Ma is every mans worst castration nightmare made manifest; a ruthless, scarred former streetwalker-turned-criminal-kingpin-in-the-making who is ten times more ruthless and sadistic than any of her cohorts and who thinks nothing of flaying the flesh from the bones of those who oppose her. What could have been reduced to little more than a bad-guy cypher in Headeys hands becomes a master-class in illustrating the formation of character through a modicum of word and gesture: Headey makes you understand why Ma-Ma is the way she is. In a world as brutal and dog-eat-dog as that into which she has been plunged, how could she be otherwise?

Coupled with these exemplary performances is Alex Garlands assured scripting. Garland teases us with glimpses of the vast expanses of Mega- City One and then proceeds to confine the action to one of the immense city-blocks that rape the poisonous skyline of the city. This simple act of reductionism serves not only to refine the focus of the film, amplify the inherent claustrophobia of Dredd and Andersons situation and remind us of the debt the film owes to the likes of Die Hard and a number of John Carpenters movies (something also alluded to by Paul Leonard-Morgans brilliant, brooding synth-heavy score), but teases us with the suggestion that as bad as things are inside Peach Trees, what the hell must it be like on the meat-grinder of the city streets outside?

I for one would like to find out.

And thats why Karl Urban needs to don the helmet again and ""Dredd"" needs a sequel.",1433376000,,4862,4.9266503667481665

I only wish it would have done better in the theatres as this could have been a great series of movies.

This is not a movie; it's CGI animation sequences and and filming ""techniques"" sprinkled with some dialog to make you think this is a movie. There is no character development and there is barely a plot. The characters are lifeless and boring. I'm a serious fan of the original. Yes, it was hokey at times and absurd things happened, but it had a plot, had character development, humor, romance, deceit, a plot twist, touching moments, cannibals, and oh yes actual acting and dialog. Now you may say the original had hokey dialog and you might not think the acting was that great... but Armand Assante was a great villain, he even had the ""crazy eyes"" (he's also one of the most underrated actors in Hollywood). You can have a good movie with a goofy and awkward hero, but you cannot have a good movie with a lame villain. This ""remake"" is a dude in an armor suit that spends the whole movie locked down in an apartment complex running away from explosions and people trying to kill him with a stupid drug-addict woman (the villain) who talks over the intercom to him.

4763919,5,B005LAII7G,"I've been a long time fan of the Dredd comics, and I have to say, the level of respect the director and Karl Urban approached this project with is a beautiful thing. Stalone's Judge Dredd has ruined Dredd for so many people because it was a Stalone film. He had to show his face, he had to be relatable and likeable, there had to be comedic relief and there had to be a hero. Dredd will not provide a whole lot of that for you AND BELIEVE IT OR NOT,THAT'S HOW IT SHOULD BE. Dredd in the comics is not likeable. He's not funny. He's not a hero, not really. He doesn't show his face and never has in the comics. Dredd is the law. The law is faceless, it doesn't care if you like it, and its sure not funny. He is a cold man that enforces the law to the letter of the word-black and white absent any grey in between. Our world is a dying place infested with crime, poverty, and the corrupt. Only 5% of all calls can be answered by the judges and that number is going down by the day. Bleak, hopeless,but powerful imagery thats a setup for a great action movie with a great action ""hero"". The violence never feels forced or fake as it does in so many movies. The plot isn't a crazy one. Just another day bringing what small amount of justice a certified badass can bring to the grim futuristic Mega City One. Great great movie, watch it.",1423872000,,1333,4.1505791505791505

However, I can say that as a gritty sci-fi film, Dredd does just fine. The performances are good, and while some of the individual pieces of the plot are generic, things move and shift often enough that it doesn't get stuck in a rut of copying what has come before. I can hardly count the number of times that an event comes along and turns \the movie in a completely different direction. Because of this, there was never a point at which I did not feel entertained. There was a bit of gore, but never overwhelming for those who are used to movies with some violence.

4763968,2,B005LAII7G,"Well, if you saw the trailers, you knew this movie was about Judge Dredd and his young understudy being trapped in a building with a crazy female gang leader and her minions. It delivers on that for sure, but there's no substance beneath the surface. I'll give Dredd credit for its brutal semi-realism and some of its visual effects, but any other aspects that make up a movie (acting, characterization, plot structure) are pretty non-existent. I really don't understand how it can be averaged at 4 stars - it's like watching someone play a gruesome, violent video game, only there it's tense because you don't know if your friend can get through it, while here we have two unstoppable heroes surviving against all odds, going against cookie-cutter bad guys with bad aim and worse common sense.

Are people really praising Urban's performance? He speaks in monotone and shows no facial expressions other than ""blank"" and ""angry"" in the whole movie (and I like him in other roles)! His narrations that bookend the movie are inane to the extreme. Oh, and the ""rookie"" is written terribly, a total cliche from start to finish (she's the semi-emotional one, the one we're supposed to identify with...of course). ""Ma Ma"" certainly has the look of a woman who's gone nuts, but really doesn't do much on screen to seem any more despicable than her underlings.

I know the Stallone movie probably comes off as corny nowadays, but at least it was FUN to watch. You can get a group of buddies together and have a riot watching it. Most comic book movies made in the last decade are all about being dark and gritty but lack the simple enjoyment of being escapist and entertaining. Dredd isn't enjoyable on any level other than being a time killer.",1422921600,,1736,4.745033112582782

4764125,5,B005LAII7G,"I'll make this short, as others have gone into excellent, in-depth reviews.

I'll start by saying that this film is rated R, for a reason.  I've seen negative reviews, because of the violence.  It is essentially about ""urban warfare"" in a future, dystopian setting, so anyone expecting a sugar-coated outing, should look elsewhere.

Put simply, even if you know nothing about the graphic novel, this is a great film.  Think of it like a thrill park ride, where you just strap in, and ""hang on"", while winding your way through a cleverly built mix of story and action.  There is none of the over-the-top acting of the Stalone version.  The acting is spot-on, with Urban and Thirlby playing their roles to a tee, with totally believable characters.  If you enjoy this genre at all, and have not seen this film, then I cannot imagine being disappointed with it, because it is just so well done.  It also lends it self to rewatching.

Some oddball comments....
It's still a great movie, if seen on a ""regular"" TV, but it deserves a solid LFE (and surround) environment.  There is a driving (low freq) background ""beat"" that underpins the many ""tense"" scenes in the film, and also, the LFE comes into play in a big way in several action scenes.  This is a film whose sound was well crafted, such that you ""feel"" the tension and action, as much as you see it.

This is a special blu-ray offering in that you get the 3D and non-3D version on the same disk, and this is not a post-production 3D conversion.  This was shot in 3D, with none of the gimmickry.  The 3D just enhances the outing even more, by simply enhancing the visual feel of the experience.

And lastly, as I write this, Amazon has this on sale for the ridiculously low price of $6.  Buy it!  It is a ""can't lose"" purchase.",1422057600,,1780,4.509375
4764126,5,B005LAII7G,"This is a very lean, grungy, dirty, nasty action film and I loved it.  If, like me, you are so, so bored of origin stories, this is a comic-book adaptation that throws you in with a straightforward adventure and very cool action.  They don't explain every little thing about the last 40 years of Dredd comics because it isn't necessary.  Karl Urban is great as Dredd and really pulls the role off well, even though you never see his face.  Worth it if you like R-rated action flicks, especially with an 80s pseudo-future vibe.",1421971200,,526,4.5638297872340425

Olivia Thirlby is compelling as the Rookie Judge Anderson, thrown into her first day of street duty, a task she may not be ready for.

4765156,5,B005LAII7G,"If you are looking at this movie, then you don't take movies like this too seriously in the first place - I mean, its Judge Dredd.  It's not a world class drama by design.  What it is, is a gritty action flick with a consistent story, good characters, and lots of creativity that ""could be real if this was the situation"" which I really appreciate.  Keith Urban is a great Dredd and the movie never kicks itself in the teeth by having an ""I can't believe they just did that - that's way out of line for this story"" moment.  The love that the movie never breaks character - I call this the ability to ""suspend my disbelief"" and not many directors achieve that in their movies.  But I'd put this one with The Abyss and Aliens for consistency and solid ""world development"" (though this isn't as cleanly put together as Ridley Scott's work or nearly as pretty.  For what it is, I'm pretty amazed). But every so often I re-watch it because the drama between the Judge's (Dredd and Anderson) and the actions of the villian and her underlings ""feel"" consistent to the character.  I love Anderson's decisions at the end, the way she sorts herself out - when a hero or villian develops a character trait during a movie it's something few movies portray that's a draw for me.  And I like a ""dirty hero"".  Anyway, I guess the movie just has more depth than is normally expected in an ""action"" flick... and I keep coming back for more.",1418860800,,1423,4.421455938697318

4765439,4,B005LAII7G,"This film was much better than the late 90's Sylvester Stallone movie.  The lead actor Karl Urban who played Judge Dredd is very convincing and did a great job.  His partner actress Olivia Thrilby did an outstanding job as Anderson a telepathic new recruit.  I also thought the main villain Ma Ma played by Lena Headey was well done.

Most of the film takes place in a large high rise skyscraper, it reminded me of ""Die Hard"".  I liked the pacing of the film it seemed to flow very well and was not overly long or boring.  It does have a lot more violence than the earlier Judge Dredd film and would not be good for young viewers.

I was surprised how much I enjoyed watching this film.  It had a lot of nice elements in the script.  I thought the Anderson character was fascinating and liked how she was able to look into the lives of people who lived in the ghetto apartment building.  I thought it made her a better judge. The idea of a cop movie focusing on a veteran officer taking a rookie under his wing is nothing new, but I thought this films took that idea in new ways which was refreshing.  I thought the world itself was believable. You can easily imagine what could eventually happen with massive overpopulation and food shortages.

This film kind of flew under the radar at the box office and not a lot of people saw it but they are missing out because it was one of the best action movies I have seen in a long time.  If you are looking for mindless explosions and endless body counts without seeing anyone actually get hurt or die watch a Transformers movie but if you want a thinking mans action movie this is a good one.

I really enjoyed the lengths in which Ma Ma tries to get rid of Dredd and Anderson as they climb higher and higher in the building.  The scenes with the other Judges in the building are great and I thought both the cops and criminals made smart decisions which made the film more believable.

I have never read any of the Judge Dredd comic books, but I think this film was highly entertaining.  If you are in the mood for a good popcorn flick this is it.",1418342400,2,2094,4.287531806615776

The plot is true to the comics--over the top violence with a lot of grit and determination. The visuals are fantastic. They're not too exaggerated, and they give the same feel of ""gritty,"" dirty urbanized sprawl that just fits with the setting. The characters aren't overblown caricatures that was Sylvester Stallone. And a minor point that I liked is that Karl Urban never takes his helmet off, nor do most of the other Judges.

The story is refreshingly simple after watching self-important slogs like The Dark Knight Rises.  The performances are perfect, the action is spectacular and it has a satisfying arc.

Like The Matrix, the fantastic effects are justified by the story (in this case, a street drug that allows its users to perceive time at 1% normal speed), and even though the setting is confined, you get a sense of a fully realized cyberpunk backdrop that makes the characters believable.

Though I love sci-fi, violent movies aren't usually my thing and this is the polar opposite of my usual fare, but I thought it was beautiful, alternating between atmospheric and hypnotic and KICKASS thrilling.  Gosh, reminiscent of so many things- westerns (the good guys, the bad guys, and the hapless in-betweens caught in the crossfire), Dirty Harry, Die Hard, Death Wish, etc.  I loved the idea of the Judges, their clarity and absolute precision (and how these were embodied in both judges yet with subtle differences).  Dredd's knack for understatement reminded me a lot of the title character in the sci-fi novel&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hard-Luck-Hank-Screw-the-Galaxy/dp/1492974900/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hard Luck Hank: Screw the Galaxy</a>, delightful.

I'm against recreational drug use, but there was a substance years ago (no longer used/available, side effects sometimes included brain damage and sudden death) that produced the slo-mo effect, and the experience was PERFECTLY rendered, amazing.  The entire movie was a feast for the eyes (Mama's face- incredible- the lighting throughout inspired, from ethereal to Edgar Allen Poe or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Crow-Stairway-To-Heaven/dp/B000OCY7OO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Crow: Stairway To Heaven</a>-like), and a feast for the ears too, for that matter (SPLATT.  THUNK.  BOOM!  Strange, I can't say I've ever noticed sound effects in a movie before).  No muddiness or grey areas emotionally or morally, either- nothing to wrestle with or ponder, perfectly clear- good will prevail, just relax and experience everything that comes before.

I really like that Dredd wears his helmet the entire movie- this is not a movie about some big action star (ie: sly stallone), it is about a justice dealer whose reputation is far bigger than his ego, and who is friggin awesome at his job.

However, since seeing this one I have become a fan of the original comics and have bought the first seven years of books (so far). No prior knowledge of the character Judge Dredd is required to enjoy this well-paced action film, but fans will have a great time spotting references to the source material. Karl Urban kills it as Judge Dredd, and no, he never takes off his helmet (one of the sins of the Stallone version). One of the (many) things I like about 'Dredd' is the amount of character development it features without ever dragging down the pace of the film. As a result, I have found myself able to watch this movie multiple times (at least half a dozen... so far) without growing tired of it. I would recommend checking it out in 3D if possible; my personal favorite scene is the raid on the Slo-Mo den. In conclusion, this is a great movie, with a great cast, cool story and lots of action. Check it out, then listen to Anthrax's 'I Am The Law,' then get your hands on some of the original books.",1416441600,,1107,4.458128078817734

4766926,5,B005LAII7G,"This is actually one awesome movie. Its fast paced with some real smart and hard hitting characters. It never drifts through its run length and every scene builds towards a fitting climax. Karl Urban walk through the entire movie with his helmet/mask on with nary an expression on his face (atleast, the 2 square inches that we do see). Yet some how, I found myself rooting for him. Like one would root for The Hulk in The Avengers. The storyline follows two policemen (with a license to kill) as they try to escape from a 200 storey skyscraper filled with goons trying to kill them. Sound very benign but the movie is atypical in many ways like both the protagonists and antagonists hardly ever make a very dumb decision and (almost) nobody ever talks before shooting. The violence, though plentiful, threads the line of gory without ever crossing it.

However, this movie sunk without a trace at the box office. I think it might have been mostly due to the horrible original Judge Dredd starring Sylvester Stallone. Thankfully the only common thread between this movie and that is the dystopian setting of a decaying metropolis and the name of the main character.

I would watch a sequel if they make it.",1414281600,,1206,4.710900473933649
4766927,3,B005LAII7G,"Dredd is an action filled super cop type of movie. The stroy line is simple, the acting is pretty good and the effects are well done. I would give a B+ for the special affects, and a C to the script. What struk me is the underlying feeling that this type of police state inforcement is possible. Being judged on the spot surly saves time and resources. Maybe this is a glimpse into a future somewhere. Be careful creators...thoughts are powerful.

4766972,4,B005LAII7G,"Great film for having only a $50mil budget.  Most $150mil films can't do it as well as this film and crew did. Art and concepts were fantastic, created by a great Matte Painter and concept artist Neil Miller. Check out his work online.

The story is decent, and the direction and cinematography work as well or better than most big budget films. Visual effects were great also. Too bad this didn't do well in theaters, but that is certainly not because it wasn't a good film.  Probably didn't fair well due to bad executive management, cuts in advertising budgets, and the usual host of poor studio decisions made by two or three old, crusty, white men in suits.

It's rare to see a raw version of a comic book hero in films.  This one was razor sharp, violent, and as true to original concept as these movies have got so far.  I hope the director, actors, and the hundreds of artists involved are proud of this film regardless of how it did financially.  Because they all made this film quite perfectly.  I would be proud of it if I were involved, for sure.",1413936000,,1058,4.44559585492228

There's little else to be said here other than it was surprisingly awesome. I really wasn't expecting too much, and I walked out genuinely impressed, surprised, entertained and ready for more. Urban simply IS Dredd. He IS Dredd to an even greater extent than Stallone is NOT Dredd ... which is saying something.

I very much hope we see more of Urban's Dredd with a similar production quality to this.

Perhaps this movie suffered from association with the early 90's Stallone flick but let me inform you  that under no uncertainty this is by far the superior version starring Karl Urban. Not only is it superior to the earlier adaptation but also superior to every comic book adaptation to date in my humble opinion. It respects the source and doesn't feel like a rushed adaptation. That said it is hyper violent and technically it does pass the Bechtel test since Anderson (played by Olivia Thirlby) does speak to another woman about how they can get out of her apartment level. Another kudos is how that Anderson is only objectified by Kay (Woody Harris) because he's a murderous street thug and not by anyone else at all.",1412121600,2,798,4.692857142857143

The plot is simple and the characters are straightforward but, unlike many other modern action movies, Dredd's simplicity is it's biggest strength. Dredd uses a straightforward narrative, a drug bust gone wrong in a high rise apartment building, to explore a world sunk deep into anarchy, pain and desperation. With surprising subtlety from it's two stars, this film makes you feel every gunshot, tremble from every explosion, and question the same things rookie judge Anderson does as her first mission devolves into a savage fight for survival: are the judges really a force for good, or the crucibles of a violent dystopia?

4768631,5,B005LAII7G,"First of all, ""Dredd"" should not be confused with that sick mockery of the Judge Dredd franchise starring Sylvester Stallone released in the 1990s. This is the real deal. Superb acting, directing, scripting, etc. This film is essentially a flawless rendition of Judge Dredd on film. It is dark, grim, and bloody. Judge Dredd himself is a cardboard character, so if you are expecting some amazing character development, forget it. There is no love story, no sentimentality. This is genuinely the comic book properly brought to the screen.

My intention here is not to focus on the film itself but upon the fabulous Blu-ray presentation of it. The single disk contains both the 2D and 3D versions. Think about that. No switching disks for both versions. Why I have been required to use a separate disk for the two versions of every other 2D/3D Blu-ray I have now utterly baffles me.

While the 7.1 surround sound is superb, this disk also contain the kind of soundtrack that absolutely EVERY action picture should have, a 2.0 stereo version optimized for late-night viewing. Some of you who have invested in home theaters may have had to deal with the horror of constantly adjusting the volume again and again while trying to watch a film when others are sleeping or doing other things. Modern filmmakers for some utterly absurd reason love to present mumbled or whispered dialogue at virtually indiscernible levels followed by loud explosions and room-shaking bass effects. Unless it is a garbled mumblefest like ""Dark Knight Rises"", it usually work in a theater, and it usually works at home, provided everyone else is interested in watching the picture, which rarely happens in my home. With the 2.0 soundtrack, I simply set it and forgot about it. The volume of quiet dialogue was raised, and loud explosions and music were lowered, facilitating a truly enjoyable viewing and listening experience for me while my children slept and my wife did not complain or curse at me. It truly baffles me as to why this is not an expected standard feature on ALL Blu-rays. It was one of the reasons I actually liked VCDs, being that sound on them was always optimized in the same way.

The disk also includes numerous special features which should truly satisfy any fan, including interviews with various people involved in the creation of and perpetuation of the comics over the thirty-five years before this masterpiece was released.

Guys, be warned. This is probably one of the worst possible films you could choose to watch with females, unless they are exactly the right kind of geek girls, and I do not mean the kind of geek girls who got into comics because of ""Strangers in Paradise"" or anthropormorphised animals. I mean the kind of geek girls who would truly enjoy 95 minutes of dark, gritty, virtually emotionless action with no romance or humor whatsoever, basically the kind of geek girl who might be slightly less rare than honest politicians.",1411171200,,2948,4.89

This movie is an excellent prequel/opening to the next, original 1995 movie ""Judge Dredd"" with Stallone. Here they present a much darker and more realistic version of this futuristic world, but with a very narrow scope. The movie focuses on one good guy (and sidekick) vs bad girl villian (and minion) in a single scenario. In some ways it parallels the 1988 movie ""Colors"" with Duvall or even ""New Jack City"" but in no way can it be put in the same league as either of those movies. The context is so narrow in scope especially when compared to the 1995 movie that covered so much ground. The blood was gratuitious and added nothing to the action or the story (not that there was much of a developing story anyways). Definately not a movie for children under 17.

If you haven't already seen the original with Stallone, then I encourage you to see this one first. It provides a good foundation to understand the world that Dredd lives in, and the original movie has a broader scope that introduces background story and politics as well.",1410652800,,1161,4.603864734299517

Revision: For the Studio folks who won't make a sequal, there was NO MARKETING FOR THIS MOVIE, if there had been, I'm pretty sure with a Rotten Tomatoes score of 78% you would have made a lot more money. I figured I'd give it a shot one day even though I had never heard of it, Karl Urban and some good reviews from obvious sci-fi and comic fans sold me.

Better than a couple of other movies lately with big names and more marketing.

I can not stress enough how good the effects are, original and very cool, some of the best I've ever seen, and I've seen most sci-fi and fantasy movies out there. It's very well done overall. Good acting, good story and did I mention how friggin cool it was. Gritty post-apocalyptic awesomeness!

Underrated and definitely worth it. I bought the Blu-Ray after renting and it's very good, get the version that gives you Ultraviolet, Blu-Ray and 3D.",1407110400,2,1058,4.466321243523316

The action is non stop from beginning to end. Karl Urban played Dredd amazingly. I love that he never takes off his helmet and nails the comic book Dredd persona unlike the original Judge Dredd where Stallone's ego got in the way of what the character should've been. It is insane how this movie wasn't as popular as it should've been. But it's defiantly a diamond in the rough and I see it gaining in popularity in the future.,1407024000,,604,4.601851851851852

When I played the blu ray for friends and family they regretted not watching it with me.  Lots of people compare the plot to the raid but I remember an old 80's B-movie with the plot. Less campy than the the original Urban is more intimating than Stallone and Olivia a far better Heroine than most action movies where an actress would go over the top. Film also shows you don't need a 100 million dollars for a great action flick. Which shows Hollywood is run like the government but doesn't use other people's money.

4770317,4,B005LAII7G,"I watched the original Judge Dredd way back when and decided I needed to see the reboot, which many argue is a better comparison to the comics. I personally have not read any of them, but the concept intrigues me beyond belief!

The movie itself was highly entertaining. It is based around Dredd and his never ending quest to uphold the law in a city full of deviants. As they state at one point in the movie, there are X hundreds of thousands of crimes commited each day. We can only address 6% of them. (Sorry, I'm paraphrasing). In other words, A LOT goes unpunished. Dredd is tasked with assessing a potential rookie, Anderson. She accompanies him on a routine trip out, which turns out to test the both of them more than either realizes.

They respond to a triple homicide on Peach Tree Street, a complex of slums that is run by MAMA and her gang. Dredd and Anderson apprehend one of her henchmen and attempt to take him to the station for questioning. Before they can leave the compound, MAMA orders all of the blast doors shut, leaving them trapped with the entire gang! Think of it as an ant waltzing around in an active beehive. They need to somehow survive the ordeal while keeping the suspect in tact.

The movie itself reminded me a lot of fight club with its ""grittyness"". Everything seemed very dirty and unkempt, which is how most of the city seemed. This leads me to my only critic of the movie. There were a few scenes that had this very rough look, not set wise but cinematically. I almost wonder if they ran out of money or time to clean up the frames. Other than that one small complaint, it was an awesome movie that I wouldn't mind watching again, which says quite a bit because I rarely watch a film twice.",1406592000,,1729,4.413793103448276

The special effects were great, the plot, well it wasn't the best but it didn't matter, the momentum of the story and the gritty timeline made it intriguing.
This movie is not for everyone, I noticed the low raters on this movie cant take the extra blood and violence, thtas ok, those people shouldn't watch the movie. If you like futuristic sci-fi mixed with a touch of gritty reality, some added blood and guts, then youll enjoy Dredd. Lead actor Urban doesnt take his helmet off the whole movie, he didn't portray the campy charater that Stallone did, instead he stuck to the dark seedy character that Dredd is.

I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed watching this movie. Karl Urban's nose and mouth managed to perfectly portray Dredd's personality and Olivia Thrilby's Anderson almost stole the show with her supporting (but honestly, she was the main character of the story) cast.

Excellent action (without excessive shakey cam), great villain (Lena Heady as Ma-Ma), slow-motion used properly and logically, strong female roles (Olivia and Lena are BAMFs without being over-sexualized).

There are nuances, such as ""We can't execute on 99%"" that reinforce the fact that there is a system in place that Dredd follows.  These reinforce that Dredd is not simply a vigilante cop, but a servant of the law.  Along with this, Anderson goes through a well-crafted heroine's journey and brings the audience along for the ride.  It's a very well built action movie, but is EXTREMELY violent.  Do not confuse this for the campy Stallone version.

4770652,5,B005LAII7G,"A must for fans of the cult comic strip. Dredd's dystopian worldview should be viewed through the prism of the 1980's geopolitical deadlock; the writers of 2000AD posed questions such as 'what if the nuclear stalemate should end in nuclear war?', 'What does our inner city urbanized future hold?', 'Can notions of justice coexist with the inexorable development of Mammon?'. Dredd has a dark humor throughout - the erudite placard of the vagrant reads 'Will debase self for credits', and his minimalist summary to his commanding officer 'Drug bust, perps were... uncooperative.' Not for those who don't find nihilism funny!

I hope there's a sequel but am disappointed to hear it didn't do well at the box office. I saw it in 3D and it's truly spectacular. Casting is excellent, script is spot-on authentic (apart from the lack of 'Drokk'), direction and visual effects are great. Some may disagree with the vision of Mega City One on display, but several artists drew Dredd as a comic and all had their own style. This reminds me of Brian Bolland's art for 2000AD - one of the greats. A tv series would be a great opportunity to showcase the zany world of Mega City One, Sovcit, the Cursed Earth, Muties, Chopper, Fatties, Judges Death, Mortis, Fear, and Fire, Titan et al.

4770869,2,B005LAII7G,"As much as I enjoy watching Karl Urban and mindless killing and destruction, this movie lacks so many things that make a movie good.  I will start by saying, the plot wasn't bad.  If you feel like watching this, I shall not spoil it.

However:

From the start, the scenario is any city USA.  There isn't anything about the movie that makes Mega-City One standout from modern cities (this was something that was humorous and enjoyable about the Stallone film).  This really hit from the start with the bland shot of the Hall of Justice.  Even all of the automobiles are generic (including Dredd's motorcycle).

Dredd has a neat uniform, but it's missing those little touches that would have made him more of a Judge (say, some golden epaulettes).  I mean, this is supposed to be a darker future where crime runs so rampant that the justice system was put on the shoulders of glorified S.W.A.T. members (a.k.a. Judges).  If the costume design is going to do away with the uniformity of the Judge's dress, then the movie should at least have had a darker tone.  It could have done well in the ""bleak society"" style that Nolan utilized in the Dark Knight franchise.  That would have been awesome.

My other contention with the movie is the ""gore.""  I love movies with gore and unique deaths, but every time Dredd does something cool, it just falls flat.  No one-liners and no resolution beyond each death.  It's just death for death's sake.  I suppose that gives the movie a cold appeal, but that is overshadowed by Urban attempting to make the his judgements (almost) comical.

To say the budget wasn't big enough is just a poor excuse.  I have seen better cinematography in SYFY movies (and that's saying something).  But don't completely count the movie out.  As painful as I found it to be, there are those few moments when you'll be watching and go ""oh, the movie's back.""",1404950400,,1873,4.649390243902439

For the fan of both 80s action films (such as Robocop) and current action films, it does not disappoint . The difference between this film and the average studio film of the same vein is that this one adds edge, ...but not too much edge; just enough to make you take a breath and shift uncomfortably in your seat.

This film has a very basic plot with much better acting than I was expecting.  Also Judge Dredd never takes off his helmet, as it should be. It was a lot of fun but do not let your kids watch it, brutally violent at times.  It did a good job showing how the society in a city of 800 million is basically just anarchy and the judges are not necessarily the good guys in the eyes of the citizens. I wish it hadn't flopped in the theaters because I would eagerly go see a sequel.

And it's actually pretty cool.

I went through a stage in the mid 80s of being 2000AD fan. I got the comics for a few years, but would never described myself as hardcore.

That said, I found Stallone's interpretation to be so appalling that I had an anger stroke that I have never really recovered from.

Fortunately, this goes some way to healing that hurt.

Dark, gritty, and broadly faithful to at least the idea, I thought there were some nice touches, particularly the Soylent Green references.

But there were disappointments; the image of Mega City 1 was terrible. The cityscapes in Fifth Element were closer to those of the original comics than in this movie.

The characterizations were good for Dredd and Anderson, but woeful for Ma Ma.
She felt like a goon of The Joker, and was just bad for the sake of being bad - no reason, just bad, and I hate a lack of backstory.#
Finally, plot holes - there were two biggies.
(1) Ma Ma never needed to shut Peachtrees down. She could have had the informant shot before leaving (she controls the CCTV) or had the 4 corrupt judges kill him before reaching interrogation. But that is nothing compated to
(2) Dredd never needed to transport the informant. Anderson could have mind probed him (like she did later) and then they could have executed him.

Duh!

4771531,4,B005LAII7G,"I enjoyed this movie and for the most part this Blu-Ray.  The transfer is the big thing here that could be better. Unlike most studio titles this was released with the 3D version and the 2D on the same disc.  This forces the disc to have more data then normal so the data that is there needs gets compressed to a higher degree. The compression leads to more digital artifacts then I am used to seeing on modern Blu-Ray discs. It is not a horrible looking transfer by any means but not as good as some.  It would be nice to see this title released with both versions dedicated to a disc of their own.

The audio on the disc is pretty good.  I am used to some very impressive uncompressed audio tracks though and the mix on this one is better in some places then others. This is not the fault of the disc but is about the mix created by the filmmakers. As with the video these are kind of nit picky things but I am used to such amazing quality on most of my discs that it does not quite compare to those.

The movie itself I enjoyed and is much better in my opinion then the Stallone one from the 90's.  This movie steps away from the camp and takes itself more seriously. The story is actually the same one as in the movie ""The Raid."" If you have seen that one you know the basic premise behind this film.  There are some graphic violence moments and some disturbing images here and there that will keep this from appealing to some.",1402876800,,1431,4.178181818181818

It's a bit of a brainless action movie, despite having been based on one of the most scathing commentaries of that sort of thing in print. It's fun, though, and Karl Urban does a great job as Judge Dredd. Olivia Thrilby is pretty good as Judge Anderson, and I like how the film is written.

If you have any disdain for the 1995 Stallone ""Judge Dredd"" any residual bad flavor in your mouth from that thing they call a film, just watch this and it's like a nice cold sip of Pepsi (or Coke).  Karl Urban just knocks it out of the park, never takes off the helmet in Dredd mode 99% (except when he sounded like Christian Bale Batman), and Lena Headey, a beautiful woman day and night, in this movie you barely want to look into her eyes because her character is just....evil; the rest of the cast is great.

4771658,4,B005LAII7G,"I will admit that I liked the Stallone Judge Dredd. It was entertaining, gave you insight into the Dredd universe, and provided Stallone and Assante lots of opportunities for good, campy dialogue.
That being said, this version of Dredd is definitely superior! Karl Urban provides just the right edge for a believable Dredd in accordance with the comic book version I remember oh so well. Additionally, the depiction of Mega City One was a particularly vivid one providing a view of the new world which was built on the remains of the old one. The Mega Blocks were a very stark contrast to the skyscrapers of old.
The story was entertaining and very timely with the current situations with drugs, gangs, and cartels currently popping up in the news. Action scenes were well thought out and I didn't need to suspend too much disbelief.

This ""Dredd"" is NOTHING, like the original, ""Cheeky"" almost comedic action flick that was Stallons ""Judge Dredd"".

The story isn't anything special and the Villan in this movie is Chick!

Fortunately, the Dredd in this movie is Bad A$$ and takes his job much more seriously than Stallone in the Original. If you like action and all out Violence then you will like this movie.  I sure did.

He has been portrayed in many different ways in 2000 AD magazine and his own titles and we got a taste of the campy version with Sylvester Stallone some years back. This particular take on the futuristic law enforcement officer is much closer to the version that I grew to love reading imports of his comics from England. Raw, dirty and tough as nails, the story is just one day in his life that delivers on those traits that made him a household name in the UK- Judge, Jury Executioner. The cinematography captures visuals that have never been done before courtesy of the drug ""Slow-Mo"" that is a centerpiece in the story. While it's not full of the way out sci-fi characters often found in 2000 AD magazine, this is basically a survival story of 2 cops versus an entire drug gang and their leader trapped in a mega-city block amongst about 18,000 residents.

Karl Urban makes a MUCH better Judge Dredd than Stallone.  His character was cold and calculating, just as in the comics.  He never raised his voice for inflection, as someone in complete control of any situation.  Just another day at the office.

The visuals are absolutely stunning, especially the slow motion in the film. Such as the skin rippling on a heavy dude when a round strikes his gut and we see the penetration in slow motion. I saw the 2d version first on Netflix and just KNEW it was a 3d film because of the effects.  I was right, because this was filmed in 3d, not a conversion.  I absolutely LOVE this movie.

First, it is a MUCH more accurate representation of the comic source. If you were to compare the 1995 Stallone Dredd with the 2012 Urban Dredd, it would be like comparing George Clooney Batman to the Christian Bale Dark Knight.

The acting is great, gone is the camp. Gone is the wacky side kick (Rob Schnider). What is left in it's place is intense, brooding acting with just a touch of deadpan humor. The costumes are waaay toned down and much more believable. You can tell they are making an action movie not a ""super hero"" movie.

No real theme, no real subtext but involving nonetheless. Action movies succeed for me on one basic point of focus: Do I feel relieved and a sense of ""Mission Accomplished""  when the bad guy gets it? If you don't care, then the movie's failed. In Dredd's case, I laughed a bit at the manner in which the antagonist bites it in the end. It was somewhat clever.  Meanwhile, I wanted to see why it got so many negative reviews and upon reading further, there are TON of people who think it's based on the 1995 Stallone travesty not the 1970's comic book. And what's worse, there are reviews complaining that Dredd isn't as good as Stallone's effort, which was 100% awful. 2012 Dredd, at the very least, created a tangible, believable world and nailed the post apocalyptic nihilistic vibe of the comics. So, if you're a Grandma, stay the heck away from Dredd. You won't like it. If you're vaguely familiar with the comic book, it's a pretty decent time.

Judge Dredd, is not one of those films. It's one of the worst, if not the worst, film he's ever made. This is -not- a remake or reboot of that film. It intentionally had nothing to do with it and was made to correct the offense that film was for fans of Judge Dredd, which is a comic book.

It get's everything right. The bad one liners, the hyper violent gore, and everything about this film is exactly what it should be. This was made by a fan of the character who knows the source material and did a wonderful job bringing it to life. The absence of the SF cuss ""Drokk"" is notable, but easily ignored. It doesn't appear in every issue of the comic, so it's not out of place that he doesn't say it in the film. Would have been a nice nod to fans to put it in there though, but this film does enough right that it's easily forgiven.

It's perfectly okay to not like the film, but people should understand that the film is exactly what it supposed to be, what it should be, in every way. This is what Judge Dredd is and how he should be portrayed. If you didn't like it, it's not because there's something wrong with the film. It's because you're not a fan of this character, because this movie gets everything right.

Judge Dredd is a comic book that was published in the British Anthology series 2000 AD and was first in it's pages in 1977 in the second issue of the anthology. He was written as an even more extreme and futuristic version of Harry Callahan from the Dirty Harry series, and his character was modeled after the leather clad biker on the Deathrace 2000 movie poster. He's essentially the Punisher with a badge and legal authority, and not the nice Thomas Jane version.

He's not Sylvester Stallone, was never intended to be, and does not ever take his helmet off. In the original comic even when he's shown at home in his off time he's wearing it. He did remove it in one issue, but the reader never sees his face, and the people in the comic that do are horrified and disgusted, to the point of being violently sick.

He's essentially a political satire from the 1970s. An extreme example pointing out the perceived flaws of the British justice system in the period. The comic became popular in the 80s and has been going strong ever since. Dredd is probably the most famous comic British comic book character in the world.

This film was made by a fan of that comic with a deep love and understanding of the source. They knew what they were doing, got so many details right, and this is without doubt one of the best comic book adaptions ever made. Sin City is possibly the only film I can think of that does better, and that's because it's word for word and frame for frame the same as the comic. Every panel in Sin City is a frame in the film version.

Reviewers that don't like it because it's violent, gory, brutish, and crude are making valid criticisms. If you're not into that sort of thing you're not going to like this film. Avoid it. Though, why someone who doesn't like those things is watching an R rated action film is beyond me. I'm left wondering what they were expecting it to be exactly.

However, the hundreds of people who seem to think this is a bad remake of a Sly Stallone film are simply ignorant and should be ignored. This was intentionally made to have nothing to do with that film and was created to make up for everything that movie got wrong for fans of the character. It accomplished that amazingly well.

This movie gets five stars from me. It's exactly what a comic book adaption should be. It's extremely true to the source material, and gets the details right. As a fan of the original comic, this film blew me away. It's a better comic adaption than anything put out by Marvel or DC in the last ten years. Not necessarily a better movie and certainly not a more popular one, but as an adaption that isn't word for word and frame for frame the same as the original comic, it's as true to the source as a comic book movie adaption can possible to be.",1398988800,,4136,4.297817715019256

Urban is great as always and the psychic side kick did a great job as well. This movie was kind of a rip off of The Raid but I actually like it much better.

The female sidekick brought an interesting slant and in what I thought was an extremely unique approach, the star (Karl Urban), never takes off his helmet throughout the movie so you never see his face. Lena Headley as the villain also provided a nice twist. Overall I was pleased and enjoyed the movie. It was probably more like 3.5 stars, but rounded up for the unique approach.

4772475,4,B005LAII7G,"The previous movie had a some what lighter tone than this one. Here I think you get a much more vivid sense of millions of people in overcrowded hyper violent slums, and driven to desperation and a life of crime. This movie is actually VERY similar to ""The Raid"" a kung fu movie, so if you like this you should watch that, if you like that you should watch this.
The acting far and away exceeds that of the original especially by Karl Urban (Dredd) who does a good job capturing the 90's bad asssery of Stallone's Dredd without trying too obviously to imitate him. You can also check him out as a slightly less by the book detective on Almost Human, a GREAT sci-fi/buddy cop show.

I think slow motion was amazing, they didn't use it as often as they probably could but when they did the effect was really stunning, especially in a door breach at the begging(how did they do that?).

There is loads of material to make other superhero movies using the same and other characters, a lot of people would like to see how their stories progress and not continually see the same origin movie over and over. That being said this movie was surprisingly good and the special effects were well done as well. It helps the the guy playing Dredd was Karl Urban, as he is an amazing actor who did an excellent job getting the mannerisms and speech patterns down for his role as Dr. Leonard McCoy in the remake of Star Trek. His gravely voice was spot on for Dredd, looking forward to more of his work. The only reason i gave this a four instead of five stars is for the above stated reason, its a remake.

There was no doubt whatsoever that Dredd and Andersen would succeed in their mission. All this movie felt like was a videogame. I was never emotionally invested and the ending was predictable. That is what this movie felt like-just watching somebody play a video game in an arcade. Lots of special effects and computer graphics but no emotion or feeling like in the Stallone version where they humanized Dredd.

Sly, make a sequel with Rob Schneider. There was a humanity that was fleshed out in the first movie as Sly's Dredd was forced to deal with failure and betrayal to fix the judges program and the only one he could rely one he could rely was a wise-cracking loser and Diane Lane.

So when it was released on DVD/Blu-ray and on Amazon video, I figured I give it chance and watch it. I was not dissappointed.

 The setting takes place in a futuristic metropolis inhabited by criminals and monitored by Judges who are law enforcement that decides a sentence to criminals on the spot. The movie ""jumps right in"" to the story of how Judge Anderson (Olivia Thirlby) became Judge Dredd's (Karl Urban) apprentice and they go on a patrol in a slummy, neighborhood building called Peach Tree. It just so happens that this building is controlled by a drug lord name Ma-Ma. I don't want to go into too much details but the story is very simple and straightforward. Like all video games and movies, the good guys will fight their way up to confront and fight the big boss.

  We learn very little about the characters besides the fact that there are different types of human species like mutants such as Judge Anderson and that Judge Dredd is one of those work-alone-archetype law enforcement character. This movie would definitely appeal to those who are sci-fiction fans, comic book afficionados, or action flick lovers.

They struggle to survive and turn the tables on the bad guys.

""Dredd"" is comparable to ""The Raid: Redemption"" in plot and style but whereas The Raid favored it's action to be overpoweringly quick, bloody and brutal and up-close and personal Dredd settles for violence that is spaced, seemingly overpowered but not feeling overpowered, and filmed frequently at distances versus in tight hallways and shallow rooms.  None of this is by way of criticism but by way of comparison because Dredd is a good time for the action fan.  It stays true in tone and visual to its European source comics with the titular Judge himself never removing his helmet (that I recall).  That allows Dredd (played by Karl Urban) to maintain his enigmatic and unapproachable aura.

I hate that rather than coming up with something brand new, people think they have to remake all these movies now days, most of which turn out awful. I didn't expect much out of this to begin with and I picked it up for only $5 and I figure it was maybe worth that, but I regret not buying something more interesting. The action was okay and Urban did okay as Dredd, but there was really no plot to the movie. There was a slight story but they tried to focus more on how much blood and gore they could squeeze into the 90 minutes instead.

I know a ton of people complain about it, but I really did enjoy the old movie far better than this remake. At least it had a decent storyline to it and it made it more interesting. I personally liked Stallone better as Dredd too. Remakes of old movies just need to be stopped and people need to start using their brains and coming up with their own ideas.

When Hollywood makes a movie based upon a work of another medium--in this case a noted British graphic novel series that began in the 1970s--it has a certain responsibility do more than just adhere to the original in some manner. Some think it's sufficient to simply let the name speak for itself, and feel if they throw a certain amount of money at the project-even if it's just to purchase a celebrity to play the lead and throw in a heaping amount of special effects--then they've done enough.

But as we've all seen, that kind of attitude can come near to killing a possible franchise. I cite&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Green-Lantern/dp/B005LJITS0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Green Lantern</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Daredevil/dp/B001GJ1BBQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Daredevil</a>, the Joel Schumacher's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Batman-Robin/dp/B001XVBGGM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Batman & Robin</a>, and almost any&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Superman/dp/B001IA0BOG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Superman</a>&nbsp;movie after the first. And, in this case...

The godawful 1995&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Judge-Dredd/dp/B004IDG97S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Judge Dredd</a>, starring Sly Stallone, in which the lawman came off like a claymation dullard. To be fair, it's a tough role for any actor: the central character's helmet covers everything but his chin and his scowl. But even with those limitations, Karl Urban's characterization is still leagues ahead of Stallone's.

It's a comparison that has done nothing but harm, in fact: it's believed that this movie's lack of audience and financial earning can be linked directly to the bad taste the Stallone film left in the fan base's collective mouth. It's reported that DREDD, which cost an estimated $50 million, has not yet broken even--and that's killing any chance for a sequel. Many have drawn a more ""friendly"" comparison, however, to the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Robocop/dp/B00FY84E9G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Robocop</a>&nbsp;franchise, yet that current franchise has stalled, too.

I think this current movie has a closer modern counterpart, and that's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Raid-Redemption/dp/B008ULRY78/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Raid: Redemption</a>. Granted, that film is a martial arts movie, whereas this is guns, guns, guns, but the movie's theme--a slum apartment complex serves as a mob's fortress--couldn't be closer to the this movie's plot AND, most notably, the fact that, somehow, the film crew just gets it RIGHT.

Like THE RAID: REDEMPTION, DREDD is a well-made movie that sets about a goal and delivers on it with great style and action. Both are willing to minimize setting in order to ""enclose"" itself both physically and thematically--allowing a tighter focus on its key elements.

While the story began with a motorcycle chase, pretty much all of the rest of the film takes place within a into 200-story mega-ghetto called the Peach Tree, which is ruled by an iron-fisted psychopath named, ironically, Mama (Lena Headey). When Mama learns that one of her own men has been captured--one who has enough damaging information on her to cripple her lucrative drug trade--she literally shuts the doors to the complex, trapping the Judge and a trainee within, and uses the building's public address system to promise a sizable bounty to anyone who executes them. When you consider The Peach Tree has a population in the hundreds of thousands, it's pretty much a death sentence. It's a great movie tactic, too, as the Judge is stripped of his usual advantages and must rely on wits as much as weaponry.

What really stands out about this movie, however, is the director/screenwriter's decision to make the film's violence reflective of the drug Mama is pushing: the brand new psychedelic drug called Slo-Mo...so named because it slows down the taker's perceptions so that his sense of the ""present"" is occurring at about 1/100th the speed we typically perceive things. That means the scenes of drug use are not just violent--they are as kinetically vivid as anything I've ever seen. The bullet enters the skin and there is time before it exits: skin ripples, blood explodes, waves of pressure cause visible interior damage. Yes, director Pete Travis indulges violence, but it is thematically appropriate, and to those who find this a horrifically indulgent kind of violence I can only thank the heavens for the director's RESTRAINT: imagine how horrible it would have been had he decided to depict the skinning of three drug competitors at the start of the film. They had been forced to take the drug just before they were skinned alive and thrown from the top of the open central atrium into the lobby 200 floors below. To imagine what they went through would be appalling.

In fact, there is even personal growth (gasp!) on the part of Judge Dredd in this film. I felt for the man, and I felt for Anderson, his trainee (Olivia Thirlby). Don't get me wrong: this is an action movie, plain and simple, but Director Travis understands that the movie is at its best stride when we see Dredd as a man who is both NEARLY invulnerable. Perfection would be machine-like, and I found it interesting that there is really not much in the way of futuristic innovation in this dystopia (the film is set in 2074): a quick look at automobiles in the early car chase scene yielded little more than what's out there now. The same went for any ""creature comforts"" in the apartments in the Peach Tree--granted, it is a ghetto; but the movie seems to be saying that the only real innovations that make it into our near future six decades on comes in the form of the surveillance capabilities available to those who can manipulate them.

Karl Urban (whom is also in ""Almost Human"" on FOX) plays Dredd true to form, including that the helmet NEVER COMES OFF.  He portrays the character with voice, posture, and form and does superbly.

They attempt to explain why the female Judge goes without headgear the whole movie, but it is a lame explanation.

Why is it, that special skills/powers only work when the script needs them, but not when they would be useful in reality?

Andrews Blu-ray Review: Judge Dredd [Karl Urban] and his rookie in training Judge Anderson [Olivia Thirlby] are called out to the Peachtree Mega-block after three people are murdered. Soon after their arrival and the arrest of a local thug, the crime boss of the Mega-block, Madeline Madrigal, also known as ""Ma-Ma"" [Lena Headey] locks down the entire 200 floor block and says shes not opening up again until the two judges are killed. Times are dire for the two law enforcers but one of those Judges is Judge Dredd and hes not so easy to take out.

In 2012 Dredd proved to be somewhat of an antidote to the comic book hero films that just keep on getting bigger and bigger. A simple premise, a limited cast, a gritty and violent approach that services the lead character's origins rather than hollows him out for mass consumption. Of course, theres nothing all that original here. This really is the same plot that most video games serve up every couple of months. Enclosed space! Weapons options! Increasingly more difficult foes as you work up the levels. Its all typical stuff but when you throw Judge Dredd into the mix, played by a perfectly grimacing Karl Urban this elevates into something way more fun than the basics would usually deliver.

Elevation is genuinely the key here. As the characters get higher up the Mega-block everything seems to grow more and more extreme. Gunfire, blood sprays, gore, Ma Mas madness and just extreme amounts of destruction. Everything builds and builds but still theres time for quiet moments between waves to fill out the world of Mega City One. Sure, its not exactly much in the way of set up and backstory for newbies to Judge Dredd but theres enough to paint a bigger simple picture of his world and just how hard edged it is to warrant people like Judge Dredd to enforce the law.

Director Pete Travis has kept everything streamlined. We know the odds very early on. We know whats at stake. We know Dredd has to look out for Anderson as she grows a backbone and we know Ma-Ma is real bad and enough to throw all she can at the judges in order to come out of this one the victor. The real success here however is that Travis uses all of this to sell exactly how tough and driven Dredd is at every turn. Every set piece celebrates the 2000AD character like we've never seen on the big screen and it all works. Travis even pulls off the impossible and never has a single frame of Dredd out of his helmet. Karl Urban never really get much more to do that scowl but he does it well and Dredd comes out of this film a total and vindicated hero Id like to see again in more sequels.

Blu-ray Video Quality  To begin with, when the scenes are well lit, the colours and the textures are really quite great. Kinks and scratches on Dredds helmet look fantastic as does the stubble on his chin and many a set pops with neon lighting and other well placed light sources. The Slo-Mo scenes pop with amazing vivid colour and really play with images beautifully for an 1080p presentation but and this is a big old but, every now and again this Blu-ray can look not visually tip top. It begins with a real sense of heightened grain or indeed digital noise. Its sometimes quite filmic and fitting for the style of the movie but at other times its like a veil has been placed over the screen. This mutes colours, dirties light sources and turns every deep black into a grubby dark green or blue. When this drop in quality occurs at its worst, its luckily only for a very short time before we pop back into a much better looking portion of a scene but between the low lighting, boosted with neon oranges, blues and reds there is a distinct murky feel to a lot of the corridors of this Mega-block.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  The award for aggressive bass goes to Dredd! The bass on this 5.1 DTS-Master Audio track is relentless as well as awesome and I have to say its all in great ways. It almost becomes a supporting role as it lends so much to the film. Everything from the score to simply Dredd walking has a bass boost that will kick the hell out of you and it seems to be used throughout the film, even when you least expect it. The bass underpinning score gives the film a constant presence and when its not setting a mood, Dredds bike is rumbling in wonderful ways, guns are tearing up the Mega-block or there are scenes filled out with the heavy end of dance music or crowd ambience, just to keep everything feeling like a heartbeat to the rawness of the film. Because of the entire bass and general boost to most things dialogue can sometimes feel a little bit low in quieter conversations but its certainly not a consistent thing as non-whispered dialogue is generally strong and clear.

Blu-ray Special features and Extras:

Special Feature: Dredd: 200AD The Original [2012] [1080p] [3:28] This is a short documentary covering the history of Judge Dredd.

Special Feature: Slo-Mo [2012] [1080p] [2:12] Shows the ideas behind the drug induced visuals and the super slo-mo effect generated in the film. Slo-Mo was manufactured in the Peachtree Block of Sector 13 by the Ma-Ma Clan. Slo-Mo is a caramel-colored liquid that comes in a white inhaler with a clear capsule. The white inhaler has a heart on it to mark the Ma-Ma Clan.

Special Feature: Welcome To Peachtree [2012] [1080p] [2:34] This is a look at Mega City One's Mega-blocks.

Special Feature: The 3rd Dimension [2012] [1080p] [2:00] Tackles the approach to the hyper stylised 3D in the film as well as the approach to added depth and the process. We also get a look at the slow-motion cameras used for the Slo-Mo sequences and get to see a lot of the camera tests they ran to get the blood to look the way they wanted.

Special Feature: Dredds Gear [2012] [1080p] [2:32] Shows us the making of Dredds costumes.

Special Feature: Dredd [2012] [1080p] [1:52] An overview look at the film.

Special Feature: Interviews [2012] [1080p] [26:35] The biggest chunk on the extras are the Interviews which are with all involved in the project. Its a shame they are cobbled together with static question cards and bland talking head answers.

Special Feature: Previews: Underworld Awakening 3D; Piranha 3D; Shark Fight 3D; Hugo 3D; Killing Them Softly 2D; Alex Cross 3D; Lockout; Chasing Mavericks 2D and Stand Up Guys 2D.

Finally, DREDD 3D maybe wasn't quite as hard hitting this second time around as it was the first time I saw it but even with that said, theres a whole lot to enjoy here. Karl Urban does Judge Dredd some real justice, the story is simple and to the point and extremely violent compared to the other comic book films out there and really this ninety odd minute fight to get to the boss shoot fest is exactly what the doctor ordered to kick the Judge Dredd franchise off to a good start. I really do hope sequels are enabled after this first outing and it would be good to see the world of DREDD expanded to all the places the comics go. The disc itself is great for the most part but a little chaotic in the visuals department and thin on real extras. That said, the punchy audio set-up should keep most happy as it captures the large cinematic oomph very well indeed. This is a great companion to the Sylvester Stallone Judge Dredd Blu-ray disc and I am so happy to add DREDD 3D to my ever expanding 3D Blu-ray Disc Collection. Highly Recommended!

This is a video game movie, the storyline fits perfectly into a level based video game model. In typical dumb jock fashion Dredd gets trapped inside a vertical ghetto, 200 or so floors, by a gang leader named Ma-Ma. Dredd must fight his way up the building encountering progressively more difficult combatants and overcoming them until a climactic moment when Ma-Ma herself faces the depressive grimace of the Law. All the while Dredd is rolling with a telepathic rookie wingman, Judge Anderson, who lends a little yin to Dredd's emotionally dead psychopathic blood lust.

The only character development, not counting death, is found in Anderson who after killing dozens of people and seeing dozens more murdered decides she isn't cut out for this line of work. Dredd takes the slaughter all in stride rationalizing his actions as carrying out the will of the law.

This movie is an attempt to illustrate concepts in hopes of getting picked up as a trilogy. I hope doesn't get lucky.",1393977600,2,1104,4.956756756756757

Once you get past the shock value of the violent setting, there really is nowhere for the story to go.

As for the Movie itself, It is a gory action flick, but it has so much more depth with the set designs, visuals, cinematography, and the overall mood set by the director and screenwriter (Alex Garland, The Beach, 28 Days Later, Sunshine, Never Let Me Go, and the future Halo movie). Most people I know liked the movie the first time, but with more time to pay attention to the details in the second viewing, came to appreciate the movie and loved it. The Visuals are crazy with the use of ""Shine"" and ""Slow Motion"" during the drug use scenes. *Slight Spoiler but more of a plot point*  SLO-MO is the Drug that the judges are trying to eliminate, when they get trapped with 100,000 people and a large portion want them dead. There was 57 kills for Dredd alone.

There isn't exactly a movie like this, the closest to me are; the original Judge Dredd (Stallone), but much better quality and no stupid antics, or Idiocracy, just in how the movie visually presents the future, and there are a lot of stupid people in Dredd, at least 57.

4773832,4,B005LAII7G,"Dredd (Pete Travis, 2012)

I am one of the few who actually likes, in an entirely non-ironic way, Danny Cannon's cheesy 1995 Judge Dredd with Sylvester Stallone in the title role. It's a silly movie, but if you took it seriously, you were kind of missing the point. It's meant to be over the top, and it succeeds gloriously. Because of this, I was maybe a little more way of the 2012 reboot than I needed to be, especially when the glowing reviews started pouring in. So it took me perhaps longer to get round to watching it than it should have. Ultimately, you can count me up as yet another convert to the cause; while the film is not without its (minor) problems, Karl Urban filled those shoes far better than I ever thought he would, and the breathtaking cinematography from Alex Dod Mantle (who also worked with writer Alex Garland on the similarly-gorgeous 28 Days Later...) pushes it over the top from acceptable to incredible.

The plot: MegaCity has itself a new drug called SloMo, which does, well, about what you would expect. Right about the time you're asking yourself why this might be a bad thing, one of the drug's dealers injects someone with it, then pushes him off a 53rd-floor (was it 53rd? I think so) balcony. That drop is, well, ten times longer when you think the world is moving ten times slower. Enter MegaCity's police force. Judge Dredd (Doom's Karl Urban, who's come a long way, baby) has just been assigned a green recruit named Anderson (The Darkest Hour's Olivia Thirlby) to evaluate. Not the best idea when you're on your way to Peach Trees, MegaCity's equivalent of Cabrini Green in the early eighties, in order to take down Ma-Ma (The Purge's Lena Headey) and her gang of merry dealers. Though they don't know that yet at the beginning of the filmthey only know Peach Trees is the place it's all coming from, and that they're going to stop itunless Ma-Ma and her trigger-happy gang get there first.

You probably found yourself thinking of a dozen different movies while reading that ridiculous attempt at a synopsis. I know I did while writing itTraining Day, The Raid: Redemption, The Horde, Red Road, and of course the 1995 Sylvester Stallone movie are all obvious points of comparison, and you're sure to find a lot of others. And yet Dredd manages, somehow, to reference all these things, often blatantly, without ever feeling derivative. That's huge, and I think a lot of it is down to screenwriter Alex Garland (28 Days Later...) . While the films based on his novels (which are similarly excellent) tend to be woeful, his original screenplays, well, I have yet to see one that wasn't cracking, and Dredd is no exception to the rule. Director Pete Travis (Endgame) gives Garland's script a grimy feel that really works here, and the principals all bring their A games (in some cases, I didn't even know these folks had A games to bring). As far as I'm concerned, Dredd ends up being the most pleasant surprise of 2012: an action movie that fires on every level. *** ",1393459200,,3008,4.659133709981168

It appears weakly and occasionally for the rest of the film.  Urban is a known actor, but his acting has always taken me out of the world of the picture he is in.  I know he has his fans, but I am not one of them.  He was a problem that was not solved by the weak director.  An unusual thing about this film is Dredd never took his helmet off so the entire face was exposed.  Stupidly removing the helmet so the actor's face can be seen is a pet peeve sterotype of mine and I was glad to see it was not done here.
I liked the acting of the rookie judge and her esper sensing of other's thoughts fit the situation and the script without being too strong a power that rendered the movie senseless.  Her not wearing a helmet at all was well explained and accepted by me, as was Dredd's criticism of it.  In the final scene of Dredd speaking to the Judge commander, it was Urban speaking, not Dredd.  The angry ridicule that started the movie was missing, so the scene did not work for me.
The insanity of MaMa was very well presented by the actress.  It was strong and came right off the screen and was the strong point that held the movie together.
Visually the film looks like the comic it is based on, with accurate set decoration and costuming.  The background acting was good and the bit parts were well done.
This is a second Dredd film, after one done by Stallone as Dredd.  The Stallone film had a lifetime gross of $34.6 million, this film $13.4 million ([...] ).  They were box office duds, and I put it down in part to this character and setting is not uplifting.

From the story, no reason to believe the ""good guys"" are anything better than murderous thugs, the same as the opponents they meet.  A couple of toss-away nods to inconvenient niceties like justice and the effects of human suffering, but nothing that can't be easily overlooked in blowing people away.

4774019,4,B005LAII7G,"I was a little skeptical to watch this reboot of Judge Dredd, simply because I truly enjoyed the first movie, and didn't think the reboot would do it justice (no pun intended.)

First, let me say, I am a Karl Urban fan.  I have pretty much enjoyed every character he's played, starting with that of Julius Caesar in the Xena TV series.  However, I wasn't sure he would be the hard-edge, muscle bound character like Sylvester Stallone's Dredd.  And he wasn't, muscle bound that is, however, he gave the character a harder edge, in my opinion than Sly did.

The only drawback to this movie in my opinion, was the lack of character development, pretty much no back story, just straight to the action.  This wasn't a deal breaker for me as I did truly enjoy this movie.

I would definitely be in line to see a Dredd 2 if it was released.",1392854400,,833,4.405228758169935

Straight to the point action movie with a good back story and plot that doesn't get too in the way of what's important: watching Dredd beat people down.

I watched this prior to reading the comics and enjoyed it. It wasn't until I picked up one of the comic collections that I saw how perfectly well done this movie is.

If you're looking for a good action flick with some grit to it, this is your movie. I especially love the slow motion scene when Dredd and the rookie barge in on a bunch of druggies and shot the crud out of them.",1392595200,,709,4.205882352941177

I think the audience of now needs something more complex and grandiose. Fighting the simple/common criminal can be done but it would need a stronger plot and more complex characters. There are a lot of explosions, fight scenes, and gunfire but I think the audience didn't ""buy-in"" to the characters and didn't connect with our heroes.

The Raid is probably one of the best fighting movies I've ever scene. The director of the Raid sold the rights to Hollywood so they could do their version of it (Dredd). Hollywood simply enlarged the scale of the movie and replaced fight scenes with guns and lots of special effects. After seeing both I prefer the original over the Hollywood version. I am now looking forward to the sequel to the Raid which is coming out March 28, 2014 (The Raid 2: Berandal).",1392595200,,636,4.352941176470588
4774080,4,B005LAII7G,"Dredd is a little more than a big, dumb action movie. Dredd has a unique flair to it. A visual style. Something that makes the movie worth watching beyond the normal, shallow eye-candy.

Dredd has the grit of a post-apocalyptic society far in the future. People are barely managing to maintain a society in the over-populated and anarchic Mega City One. Only the Judges maintain order by eliminating criminals left and right and generally keeping the peace. Judge Dredd and his new recruit, a young psychic named Anderson, are sent to an apartment complex where gang wars have taken over and are threatening innocent lives. Dredd and Anderson get locked in and must fight their way out.

The plot of the movie is pretty basic. Don't expect an Oscar-winning screen play. It's the unique visuals that make Dredd a worthy viewing. The proper use of slow motion and gradual distortion of color really pull you in to the atmosphere of Mega City One. The acting is surprisingly good, too, for actors nobody's ever heard of. Most of the scenes are in the interior of the apartment complex, giving it a real claustrophobic feel. It's very tense from start to finish. All in all, a very good movie.

Its got it all, gunfights, blood, slow mo action, explosions, enough violence to satiate even the most bloodthirsty movie goer.
While the film does have some flaws all together its actually a really good film that hasn't received its due.
I think the reason for it not having been received well is really two fold, first the premise of the world and the judges is not one modern Americans stomach easily and second is just how bad an impression that Stallone fiasco made on the public, who the hell makes a pg-13 judge dredd?
This is really the film fans of the series should have gotten, its the nasty mean judge dredd that people know and love.
Where the film fails to me is that it does curb some of the violence which kinda feels like ""it okay to show someones head imploding but not this?"" to me. But it may have just been artistic license in how it was presented.
All in all its actually a pretty good movie and I recommend it to any fan of old school action, this reminds me of the big 80's movies like Robocop for the level of violence and action.
If you liked the old school style, don't go see the new Robocop half-assed remake, stay home, watch this, and enjoy.",1392249600,,1231,4.310344827586207

Lena Headey did a great job as the villainess with a bit more than one dimension. Good practice from Game of Thrones.

This version is definitely top-notch and does not try to be what it isn't. If you want to watch something fancy and dramatic, go to the New Wave section and get yourself a Godard movie.

  The story is simple and doesn't try to drag out the exposition any longer than it needs to be. Just a few minutes of a narration that gives you a welcoming introduction to this world and information on what a Judge actually does.

  The movie remains consistent in pacing and awesome slo-mo shots of people getting...well...shot.

4774556,3,B005LAII7G,"No snooze fest to say the least.  High octane from the just east of the word go, this film attempts to take the comic out of the original comic and instead focus on tactical appearances, a few socially critical absurdities, and guns.  Lots of guns.

Karl Urban (Red, Chronicles or Riddick, Riddick, Star Trek) doesn't quite give the Dredd of the comic book; adapting into a cold, robot like bad ass super cop: part Robocop, part Christian Bale Batman, part Stallone Dredd with some added nuisances.  The performance does stand on its own at times, all though Dredd is less the focus of the movie and more the main protagonist.

Unlike many big budget action films, the performances are better than average; from top to bottom, the cast is an excellent mix of notable actors (such as Wood Harris, Remember the Titans and The Wire, and Lena Headey, 300) who provide stellar performances and well thought out characters creates stories and story lines that can't help but draw attention.  However, being a bit too wrapped up in the genere, the film focuses more on their actions than exploring their depth.

The visual effects add to small glitches in costuming.  The penultimate effects in the film, however, fall a bit flat, as they are played with through the film but, like the characters, not entirely explored.  The lack of experimentation with the actual camera in filming also detracts a bit, not pushing the viewer far enough out their comfort zone to really enchant them with the effects.  The scenery and lighting attempt to coincide with the modern-noir take of high contrast color schemes, however they lack a certain pop.

A true fan of Stallone's Dredd will be let down by this film.  It is by no means a sequel, nor does it attempt to explore Dredd's origin as done in the nineties.  A bit closer to the comics, the film lacks the grandeur placed in mega city one in Stallone (cheesy at may be).  Dredd, reimagined, lacks the booming voice of authority, but does still way lay the scum of the city in mere moments.  No flying bikes, no interjections of other 2000 AD comics, no Rob Schnider.  The quirks are replaced in an attempt to be serious.

Not something most people will add to their collection, but worth a rent if a fan of the genre and (to some extent) the comic.  Go in without expectations and you'll get a few of those pursed lipped head nods before the end credits.",1390608000,,2392,4.641330166270784

4774592,5,B005LAII7G,"Do you like classic action movies like The Warriors and Escape from New York? If so, then I'm sure you'll love Dredd. It takes a very stripped down approach to the action, and chooses to allow the conflict to unfold with very little exposition. The dialogue is short, terse, and nothing is wasted instead the viewer is allowed to get an in-depth look into what fighting crime might look like in a grim alternate reality, and in a sense the world itself becomes the primary characterization of the film.

(Judge) Dredd is a character that sees everything in black and white. His partner, a psychic, sees the world in shades of grey. In time, they both see things from each other's perspective but it's only implied and the film never devolves into revelatory speeches or ""a-ha!"" lessons of morality. They understand each other, and there are hints of something deeper but the film never shies away from the central conflict and the entire run time is gritty, and unapologetic.

If you don't mind a film that never lets up on it's brutality, and don't mind not really getting too, too invested in the characters then I'm sure you'll find Dredd to be a very enjoyable flick.",1390435200,4,1171,4.679611650485437

And nor will you find the quality of those top tier films. I kept fast forwarding this one and that is never a good sign. Not once was it really all that believable. I did like the city shots, some of the drug infused photography, and a couple other things. I thought Stallone honestly did the judge better, even if his film was worse. In fact, Stallone could have made the better film if he had the right script instead of the hokey thing he got.

This is another so so effort imo that simply needed more conviction and talent. Comic book fans will find more to like than anyone else. I find a lot of it cheesy in a bad way and utterly meaningless at times. Other times the action is interesting and the sequences are fun. There are some pretty cool drugged out kill shots with slick editing, all set to Justin Bieber's music slowed down to a crawl, producing what sounds like sirens from heaven and droney choral music. It really is beautiful stuff if people haven't listened to it already. ('Youtube' JBieber's music slowed down 'XX' times. It becomes this weird ethereal stuff that is actually captivating in its beauty.) So decent art and sound design I guess, but ultimately it comes off too hollow again.

I'll give it 3.5 stars. 7 and average bordering on failure but worth seeing if you like the comic.",1390262400,,1431,4.437262357414449

4774659,4,B005LAII7G,Because the Stallone version of Dredd was awful (at best) and I really hadn't heard a whole lot about this movie I was hesitant to buy it until I saw it around the holidays at a cut rate price. The movie is way closer to the source material than the Stallone movie even thought to be....Urban never takes the helmet off during the entire movie and no bad humor/weak comedian slowing the movie down. Not a bad movie overall (although the general plot mimics the movie The Raid) and with a run time of just over 90 minutes it never slows or feels drawn out. I have a 3D t.v. so I watched both the 3D version and 2D version and the 3D effects really don't add to the movie but do enhance a lot of the scenes - especially the ones where characters are under the influence of the drug in the movie slo-mo. If you're into extras I highly recommend watching the animated short before watching the movie because it serves as a prologue to the movie and gives you an understanding of the villain in the film. The other extras are a lot of shorts exploring the history of Judge Dredd in the comics and the fanbase.,1390089600,,1104,4.261904761904762

Second it's rated R and it's a good old fashioned HARD R, Like the original Robocop R. Unflinchingly violent and bloody. That said the violent action scenes are really artfully composed and shot. The use of the drug SloMo and the accompanying effects shot bring an almost balletic feel to the action, it really works well. Karl Urban is perfect as the grim faced Dredd, he never takes the helmet off and that's okay, this guy does more with his clenched jaw than most actors can do with their whole face.  The setup is a bit formulaic, rookie cop out with the grizzled veteran and trouble ensues, testing them both. But that's okay because this is merely a jumping off point.

Great action flick and Karl Urban's Sylvester Stallone face was great, lips jaw wrinkled cheeks looked just like the original Dredd. Oh and by the way he never shows his face, he has the helmet covering most of his face, you know just like the original but never takes it off. Good movie; if you like action flicks with a lot of blood this is it. There is no pause in the action more than one minute. Watch it you'll love it.",1389916800,,776,4.145695364238411

After a short time I found myself caught up in the action and curious what was going to happen to the characters.  I didn't care much for the ending as it seemed a little too open ended.

It takes place in a sci-fi world, but it feels real, authentic. Very little suspension of disbelief is needed.

 Urban's performance was a little over the top,  but I suppose that goes with the territory of playing an over the top comic book character.  Olivia Thirlby's performance was fantastic.

Those of you who groan at the inauthentic close quarter combat tactics that are portrayed in Hollywood will be glad to know that this movie does it right.  Someone who knows about tactical engagement was definitely on set to make sure they did it right.

The future is depicted as a dirty, hard scrabble world where the few try to protect the majority from predators that make the Dillingers, terrorists and lawless gang members we have today  look like candidates for the Boy Scouts or sainthood.

This film is enhanced by the relationship between Dredd and a rookie, Anderson, whom he is evaluating.  The growing mutual respect and the meshing of their skills turns the final shootout into something of a ballet.  The two move in mutual support without a word or gesture.

You can blame timing/marketing for that one, because this movie is utterly fantastic! In the following year, word of mouth helped this movie move at least another $10 million in DVD sales, which are numbers normally reserved for the Avatars and Avengers of the world.

In fact, DVD sales have been so strong that a sequel is seriously being considered... for a movie that originally LOST money at the box office.  That's how good this movie is.

Simply put, It's on the same echelon quality wise as the ultra high budget comic book movies like The Amazing Spiderman, Man of Steel, etc, at 1/4 the budget.

4775311,4,B005LAII7G,"I was curious about this movie when it hit theaters. Went unnoticed but I understand why. This movie is not for children like the Marvel or DC comic movies are. Definitely don't let the kids watch this. I took one star off for it's use of extreme violence and drug use. Before this the only thing I knew about Judge Dredd was the awful Sylvester Stallone movie from way back when. If you are wondering why I still gave it 4 stars is because out of all the comic book movies you'll ever see this is probably the closest thing you will get to a 'realistic' comic book movie. The visuals were great and not over done with hollywood flair as I like to call it. They did a great job of painting a dark and grim dystopian future that was very convincing. I am also a Karl Urban fan. I thought he did a great job as Bones in the new Star Trek movies and this proves his talent ranges from a witty caring character to a tough heartless anti-hero.  Olivia Thirlby as did a fantastic job as Dredd's partner and both of them formed a very convincing team. I think what really played well in the movie was that Judge Dredd was this very mysterious, dark, almost merciless hero and the fact that Karl Urban wore the helmet during the whole movie played very well into this characterization. Then Olivia Thirlby played the more merciful heroine. Her character was a rookie learning the ropes of being a Judge. While her physic abilities prevent her from wearing a helmet, this detail played well in the movie since you can see her reaction to every situation they faced and she was also able to seek help from the civilians who otherwise are terrified of the Judges. She was the link between the civilians and the Judges. That formula always tends to work well in movies and creates a more artistic way of storytelling that is very common in Japanese Anime. Add Lena Headey as the ruthless drug lord and you get a great movie with great action sequences. So if you are looking for a comic book movie with flashy visuals and bright colors then you might want to skip this one. But if you are looking for a more realistic comic book movie experience then this movie won't disappoint.",1388966400,2,2167,4.4175

Urban gets that Dredd is a completely by-the-book cop in Megacity One.  There's no character growth.  There's a slight nuance of comedy, but it's mainly a straight-up Dredd ascending a drug gang ridden tenement block that gets dicier when the Drug Queen puts a price on Dredd's head.  The direction and cinematography are riveting as is Urban's meat and bones portrayal who seldom goes farther than that.  The major diversion from the comics comes with the inclusion of Judge Anderson, played smartly by Olivia Thirlby, introduced as Dredd's rookie partner.  Still a Psi-Judge though.  Definitely something to enjoy with popcorn.  I'd compare it with the new Conan, albeit Dredd is science fiction and would arrest Conan for grand larceny and murder.

However, the main issue I have with this movie is it lacks a bit in the way of character development and story.  The main character doesn't seem to develop at all and is bland.  His side kick is much more interesting and she does evolve a bit, but it was still difficult to connect with her.  The villain was ruthless, but I didn't find her terribly interesting.
On the positive side, it does have great action.  The guns and explosions are great.  The hand to hand fights were also pretty good.  If you're OK movies like say Transformers that doesn't care too much for plot or characters, but does its share of blowing things up or would like one to show off on your 3D TV - this movie should work for you.

I don't know if it's because there's two versions on the disc - 2D and 3D, but the video quality ranges from typically fantastic BluRay to low quality dark images - we're talking VHS tape quality. ALL dark scenes suffer from banding, over-compressed, pixelation. Most lighter scenes have those annoying ""rainbow"" pixels everywhere. I swear the equipment they used to render this had defects. You'll see the same black spot in the same space in several scenes. The same red spot on several scenes. I only paid $10 - any more and it would go back.

It's a film whose reputation will grow similarly to other sci-fi classics that didn't have a high box office gross, but became beloved, critically acclaimed cult classics over the years like ""Blade Runner"" and ""Tron"". The directing, cinematography, acting, story...so much fun! This is on par with Paul Verhoeven's ""Robocop"", in fact I believe there was a nod to that film with the ""20 seconds to comply"" line uttered by Karl Urban's Dredd character.

Also, the 3D was beautiful! So much care went into making the viewer feel part of the scenes without resorting to gimicky 3D gags. Those shootouts and the breaking glass!

4775672,5,B005LAII7G,"As it should be, for this is making a clear announcement that its irrelevance to 1995's Judge Dredd is a necessary one. But let's not bore ourselves on the past (albeit an appreciative one regarding the production values being its major strong suit), let us bear thought on what is present now and what this film crew have done since that time of mishap.

Here comes what might be one of the greatest action movies I have seen in a long time. I will admit that I am a huge fan of Dredd before his silverscreen lining and I am a big proponent of John Wagner's artistic merits; he is a superb writer, most of which consists of this particular character (Button Man would be the other prominent effort outside of such futuristic endeavours). The film crew here, have translated Wagner's vision to a tee, but more than that, they have harnessed the very necessary elements of action sequences of yore to concoct a deliberate, visceral and poetic action film.

The execution is stunning. The appropriate cuts at certain events that lead to the climax make it all the more rhythmical in its potency of poetry by gesture and by word. Alex Garland is the pivotal drive behind this (though Pete Travis has done well with the camera too) eloquent depiction of a comic character coming to life in the live-action realm of super hero movies. It's not fair to describe Dredd as a super hero though, which is why it is that much more alluring when lumped into said category.

Garland has done a tremendous job at sustaining one constant subtext that DEFINES Dredd as an unshakable character; he is a Stoicist. What is a Stoicist? Someone who detects negative premonitions that life brings; he expects dread, so to speak, and thus deals and acts upon this philosophy what ever means possible to survive what fateful event may occur. The relationship between Dredd and the city is another prominent feature that is underlooked here. This scenario is just one of the many that Dredd has endured through out his career. The city is vast, it is deadly and relentless in providing what all judges must face everyday; the Ma-Ma clan is just another day at the meat grinder.

On this day, Dredd is faced with administering a rookie on the field and determine whether she is capable of handling the lever that grinds flesh to mince. Ms. Anderson, a psychic who has applied for the work of a Judge, has been given her first case on the streets under Dredd's supervision. At the cherry pick of crime happenstance on that day, she chooses Peach Trees as her point of assessment, and so they dust trail to the mega-structure edifice that houses the current crime scene. Upon arrival, they discover an anomaly with the victims that leads to another event triggering the drug syndicate in the building itself where both Dredd and Anderson arrest one of Ma-Ma's henchmen. Ma-Ma's nervous reflex sends the building on lockdown, and thus, enter the narrative of Dredd.

What sets this movie apart from other action movies (or even other super hero movies) is the way events unfold: why the lockdown happens, why the drug syndicate exits and why Ma-Ma (Lena Headey) has exorbitant power over this complex-district. Garland weaves curiosity with causality and uses yin yang theory to justify all characters motivations in every possible way: Ma-Ma is justified by her history of violence and sexual slavery, Anderson is justified by her drive to support those in need of justice and Dredd is justified by is enigmatic stoicness through his experience in the field.

The depth of Dredd's character has a lot to do with his actions by the terse, cold, stop-end phrases that compliment his actions. His character is more defined by actions than by words. This is an important trait as we can see midway upon Ma-Ma's revelation that who she is dealing with isn't the typical law enforcer that may have seen her triumph in the past.

All the actors here a truly spectacular. Thirlby's performance of her naive-perceived justice and what is expected on the field of work. Urban for his brilliant miming techniques on the varying frowns of expression relative to the current situation and Headey's dead-eye stupor that her life is run of the mill; grandeur power begets dictatorship expectations. Dredd and Ma-Ma are actually the antithesis characters perfectly mirroring perceived causality. Their interests are vastly different, but are conflicting due to either one having to eliminate the other in order to achieve sustaining said interest. They are both ""machine-like"" in supporting their role in the world of Mega-City 1; clear cut; protagonist vs. antagonist.

That's the meat of this film's brilliance; convention. There really isn't anything new to be seen here, it's all been done before but that's exactly why it is so brilliant. The tropes, the genre trappings, it's all here but with facilitating a unique execution. Why do we have to re-invent the wheel every time with cinema anyway? What is the point of innovation if all it means is that we spend time focusing on what we want to do in order to make something fresh instead of what we NEED to do. There is a difference and Garland sees this with great insight.

This story is ordinary in ways, it's ordinary in the sense that it's conventional, that you might expect what may come next. The interesting part is that the narrative IMPLORES you to expect such things. There are some twists that are intelligent and clever but we all know that it doesn't deter from what will happen at the end, but that's the entire point:

This is just a case-file of the many in Mega-City 1, the Ma-Ma clan scenario is merely a speck of what beast this city cultivates. That's the driving notion here, it's a violent behemoth that never lets up the destructive qualities that is the blood of civilization. A story like this is fascinating in the sense that the end is actually just an opening to the characteristics of Mega-City 1.

Having said that, I command you to check this flick out. Understand that this type of storytelling should be embraced. We need more screenwriters who are concerned about spatial awareness. Character relationships not just with other characters, but with the environment. This story is incomplete. It will never BE complete. It is open ended all the way to the edges of our imagination. What is Mega-City 1? We may never know, but if you watch this film, you may have an idea. And that my friends, is something worth viewing, if only for a sequel to arrive and expand what glimpse this city beholds.

Watch it, support it, embrace it. That is the Law!",1388448000,2,6592,4.782952548330404
4775673,5,B005LAII7G,"I'll keep the review simple. It's a great action movie. The casting is spot on with Urban owning the role of Dredd. Olivia Thirlby does a real good job acting alongside Urban as a rookie judge. The scenery and score hit all the right notes. It's one of those movies that people are going to be watching years from now and wondering why it wasn't a bigger hit at the time of release.

As a note to those who are expecting or comparing this movie to the 1995 Stallone movie ""Judge Dredd"" you should know that this not a sequel to it. Dredd 2012 is much more authentic to Judge Dredd comics which the movie is based on. The comics were dark satires on things such as police states and violence and as such this is a much more violent movie than the 1995 version. However the 1995 version deviates a lot from the source material and in doing so misses the point and ends up making quite frankly a bad movie.",1388448000,,903,4.25

That said I thought Karl Urban did a fine job although you could tell he was trying a little too hard to use emotions with his mouth, considering he never takes off his helmet.

From what I've seen this appears to be a faithful adaptation to its source material and it's basically just a straight up action flick. Very gruesome, very gritty, not much sci fi here, more like post apocalyptic cops vs. criminals. I liked the way it played out more like a b movie than a big Hollywood movie, but you can see why this one didn't get too many people in the seats cause it seems more like fan service. Overall a solid flick that should please fans.",1388448000,,748,4.3428571428571425

4775751,3,B005LAII7G,"There are certain artistic choices in this rendering of the Judge Dredd story that didn't sit quite right with me. The slow-motion sequences that represented what the users experienced under the drug Slo-Mo, while possibly necessary at least once, got a little tired after the second, third and sixth iterations, as if the director suddenly decided this was going to be an arthouse movie. Let's be honest, this is a comic book adaptation of a fairly violent and bloody world, so maybe we should leave pretentions behind that this is going to be ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.""

That being said, it was reasonably entertaining. Karl Urban took the role as seriously as one can, and there was none of the camp as we witnessed in the Sylvester Stallone version over a decade ago. Olivia Thirlby seemed flat and emotionally distant, but it fits her character to an extent, and I'm afraid that Lena Headley's ""Ma-Ma"" character was a little one-dimensional as well, but I don't think that's as much her fault as the limitations of the screenplay -- she's not exactly given much room for character development, as great an actress as she is.

On the whole, while I'm not upset that I spent the last hour and a half watching this, I don't think I got out of it what I had hoped I would. While this was definitely never intended to change my life, I think that a good movie should leave me feeling SOMETHING other than mildly irritated that I might need to watch another movie to actually feel entertained.",1388361600,,1499,4.695817490494297
4775752,4,B005LAII7G,"I'm not going to write a review of this great movie, there are plenty of them available around. I juts wanted to make a couple of points:

- Many scenes have ""film noise"" in/ added to them, especially in low light and it really turns into nasty 3D noise. It's a little bit like footage from a security camera. This effect works well in 2D but low fidelity security cameras just don't convert well into 3D. This almost ruins a few scenes. Other cleaner scenes are great with a good sense of depth or trashy clutter that adds to gight choregraphy. Overall, not the best 3D transfer and not the movie I would use to showcase 3D (for that I use Avatar, Hugo and Pacific Rim).

- Even buying the 3D version, the ecopy (Ultraviolet) can ONLY BE REDEEMED IN 2D. This is very general (and sort of shady) but is worth knowing. If you want to stream in 3D you'll have to go online and buy a electronic 3D version. You won't get it with this disc.",1388361600,,936,4.252808988764045

On top of that, these scenes introduce a completely new perspective of sensation through incredibly creative and unique visual effects, with the goal of capturing what it feels like to be on the made-up drug being pushed by the villin.

Even if you brush aside the innovative cinematography and beautiful visuals surrounding the solid, congruent character that is Dredd, this movie conjurers a deep, strong, festering desire to root for and fight with Dredd.

The artistic flair of the slow-motion blood spurting isn't really my thing, but I'll admit it was well-done nonetheless.

Karl Urban is the snarky badass and is never really actually in any peril, despite ambushed, out of ammo, and presumably in deep crap.  If there's a climactic danger, it's to Anderson, not Dredd.  And if you know anything about the universe, you kind of know how Anderson's going to get through it the moment you see her about to get killed.  Predictable outcomeand if you saw a little tactical display earlier in the movie you don't even need the in-universe background.

As for the one moment when it's ""obvious"" Dredd is gonna die, he says something.  And then you know how that one's gonna turn out as well.  Absolutely zero surprise there.

But you're not watching this movie for deep drama or complicated plot twists.  It's kind of like the back story for the game Doom back in the 90s.  Remember that?  You're a space marine stationed on a base where they're doing  something and then  something goes wrong and  who cares?  DEMONS, SHOOT 'EM!  Basically it's like that.

Just don't think about it too hard and enjoy the show.  :)",1387670400,,1349,4.659574468085107

His rookie Thirlby is also very good she deftly balances future bad ass with inexperience and determination.  Qualities that Dredd comes to respect.

Also, after a while ... the blu-ray player will just crash.

In this case, this movie was purchased from Amazon. So, I returned it for a replacement.  The replacement is just as bad, and I will be returning the replacement as well. This time for a refund -- likely so that I can get the DVD instead.

She shows great courage in letting herself be made ugly for the part of the psyco bitch villain and plays it to perfection.

4776555,4,B005LAII7G,"I grew up in the Sylvester Stallone days of Judge Dredd. As a child it didn't take much to ""wow"" me in the sci-fi genre. But seeing the original as an adult was almost unbearable considering the budget and cast the movie garnered... Sly could get away with anything back in the 90's.

Seeing the trailers in theater I was curious, but wanted to wait until it was out in case it was terrible and I needed to abort the decision. Urban portrays the comic book Dredd in this film rather than a Hollywood-stylized version that was created for Stallone. In short it works and makes for a solid action film that will most likely turn into a cult favorite.

If you enjoyed anything from the original ""Judge Dredd"", a fan of the comics, or Urban himself you'll love ""Dredd."" It is highly-violent,  but portrays the true spirit of the character in a manner the original never did.",1387411200,,870,4.493670886075949

Within the last decade we've witnessed an aggressive dumbing down of society with music, pop culture, fashion, life style, and of course movies. This movie embodies the shilling of atrocious acting, recycled concept and script writing, lousy cinematography, cheesy set design and costumes, and out right plagiarism in nearly every scene.

Even the lead ""actor"" (if you can call him that) Karl Urban is so unconvincing in this role due to his limited acting skills, it becomes clearly apparent  right out of the gate that the director or producers insisted to elevate his character, he adapted a (laughable) attempt to impersonate Clint Eastwood's ""Dirty Harry"" character voice. It's not just pathetic, it distracting throughout the entire movie. What the movie lacks in all phases of intriguing and captivating movie making, it makes up for it with gratuitous body parts, blood, guts, ridiculous and pointless swearing that isn't even supported by this lousy script. How is it possible that near every actor in this movie could possibly be so unconvincing, unschooled in the basic tenants of acting, and land a gig? Simple: It's called feed the masses crap and they will like it. This flick is as dumbed down as any I've ever seen.  A movie so bad, I'm actually appalled at myself for even watching.

4777014,5,B005LAII7G,"When this movie first came out I had absolutely no interest in seeing it. For me the only exposure to the character was the lame Stallone film in the 90's. The added draw of seeing it in 3D did nothing for me. I feel like that format is overused and used badly far too often. After reading several recommendations on the film recently, my curiosity got the better of me. I finally bought the movie. I happen to have a TV that will play in 3D, although  I had only watched one film all the way through that way. I put Dredd in last night and was stunned for 96 minutes. This film is so much fun and for lack of a better way to describe it, BAD ASS! I find it hard to fathom how anyone could be disappointed with Dredd. The violence is strong and the film does not preach a moral, but very rarely does sci-fi get treated like this anymore. Unfortunately the film did not get the money it deserved at the box office. I look forward to seeing what this director does next.

(This is the director they should seek out to revamp The Terminator or just give him the money and let him do whatever he wants.)

Anyway, back to the point, the five stars is for my joy, exceeded expectations, and images I cannot get out of my head. It is very much worthy of a purchase. I look forward to watching again with friends. If you have 3D capabilities it is a must buy. One of the best uses, if not the best I've seen. I'm still looking forward to seeing Martin Scorsese's ""Hugo"" in 3D. This is impressive stuff. If you were bored with Avatar, then this is the 3D movie for you. It comes with the standard version as well for added value.",1386720000,4,1620,4.169329073482428

This is a movie that you leave feeling like it went above and beyond its calling. Its so very true to the source material. Dredd didn't get a good treatment back in 1990 with Stallone, but this movie sees Dredd rising like a phoenix. The acting and effects are perfectly balanced. It's a rarity to get such an amazing sci-fi epic in this day and age. Like I said, I loved it so much, I bought copies for friends and family.

If you're using an Oppo: Setup Menu, Device Setup, Persistent Storage, Erase BD-Video Data, OK. Then exit out.

The reason for this is that when you put your DREDD disc back in again, it won't try to resume from the last point. Also, it's just a good idea to start over with a clean slate.

(If you have another brand of BD player, just cycle it on and off. The test below should still work.)

Load the DREDD 3D disc. Chapter skip 8 times (when it lets you) to the main menu.

DO NOT SELECT ""PLAY MOVIE""!

Instead, move the cursor over to: SCENES.

Select the first chapter. It should start to play in 3D.

Technically it's still a defective pressing! We are well within our rights to complain.

Consumers shouldn't have to jump through hoops in order to get their 3D Blu-ray disc to function properly.

One really weird thing about this disc and the Oppo (and possibly other players) is that once you play it (selecting 3D from the menu) it makes every other 3D disc you play afterwards exhibit the same problem. The only way around it is to turn the Oppo off, and then on again. That seems to cure the glitch that it infects the player with..

What a great use of 3D in this action packed movie. One of the best 3D action movies yet. This one was shot with the paradise FX 3D camera system as opposed to post production conversation.  The directors did some really cool slow motion effects and during these scenes made some of the blood and gore look strangely beautiful. A nice effect. I seen this at theaters  first and was even more impressed after seeing it at home in 3D. Not to mention some raw and gritty action with some good acting and great costumes and a cool story, this disc is a must have for 3D collectors.  I can't believe this disc set it's less then $10, along with ultraviolet. I wish Amazon and Lionsgate would do this with more 3D movies as I would buy them all :)",1386547200,,777,4.26530612244898

I have just purchased, and returned to Amazon, my SECOND copy out of an obviously bad batch of these discs.

Attempts to play the 3D version of the film are repeatedly crashing my player (Oppo BDP-93, with the latest firmware).  There are other reports of this happening (to varying degrees depending on the player) documented on some of the home theater and Blu-ray forums, going several months back -- so this problem has been known for a while.  It is definitely a problem for a number of us on the Oppo.

Everything else on the disc, including the 2D version, plays normally.  The 3D is badly authored and needs to be recalled and replaced by the manufacturer.  I bought this only to enjoy the 3D version, so it really deserves a zero-star rating.",1386547200,3,803,4.612676056338028

A great, pulpy feel and synth soundtrack...reminiscent of some of John Carpenter's earlier work, like ""Escape From New York"" or ""Assault on Precinct 13.
Mixed with a little ""Blade Runner"" in the background surroundings, and a ""Robocop"" sense of humor and violence, that pretty much sums up ""Dredd.""

Great pacing for a straightforward action plot, with perfect acting and characterizations to bring the UK comic to the big screen the way it always deserved!

I think a touch more humor would have helped; these kinds of movies are always a bit better when they're not taking themselves too seriously. The story isn't terribly original and it doesn't pick up much gravity, making few if any observations about law and crime, class structure, or corruption (and I think there were opportunities to do so without being preachy), but the earnest performances and a great soundtrack really pulled me in and everything just seemed to fit in the film's simplicity and over-the-top action.",1386201600,2,742,4.84251968503937

Hats off to Mr. Urban for having the integrity to stay true to the character, whose face has never been shown (as far as I know and no, the Stallone version doesn't count).

Anyway, for those who aren't familiar with the comic or had the regrettable experience of only knowing Dredd from the Stallone version of the movie, here's the basics: Dredd is a street judge, so he is cop, judge and executioner. This whole movie is basically about him doing that, and that's all the plot needed, really. The rest is mostly bullets.

4777605,5,B005LAII7G,"Full disclaimer: I have never read any of the Dredd comic books, so if you haven't either, this review might speak to you.

The only good way for me to start explaining my like for this movie is to compare it to the first Dredd movie. And but the way, you can breathe easy because the older Dredd movie is in no way related to this one, except for the titular character. Out of the two, I like this movie much more because it seems to mix characters, action, and plot better than the old one. To me, the old Dredd movie seemed, as many adaptations do (see The Shinning), to be overly focused on the big name actors in the film rather than conveying the source to a new medium and new audience.

The tone is perfect; it's unabashedly violent and dark, and I enjoyed every second of it. The look and feel fit the description of Mega City One that the movie is trying to sell. Tension can be built without being either too soft or overly dramatic.

The plot is interesting enough to keep your attention but not convoluted. There is no obnoxious cliffhanger in a transparent bid for a sequel tie-in, but on the other hand, they could easily make another movie if they saw fit to do so.

Dredd never takes his helmet off, and he feels an appropriate distance away from us for the character. He's too cold and by the book for you to get close to, but then again, Dredd very much feels like a character you're not supposed to be close to. He's an outsider, and his distance tells you that this exclusion is part of his sacrifice for putting duty before everything else in his life. At the same time, he also bends the rules just enough for you to have no doubts about his humanity. We're meant to feel some sympathy or empathy for him, even if we're not allowed to get too close, and the simple yet compelling performance of Karl Urban gives us that too. It's a Dredd 'sweet-spot' if you will. The other characters are believable enough and no one ever really stood out to me as holding things back.

Overall, it's a well-rounded movie, which is rare these days. I'm not claiming that Dredd is perfect, but it's a very fun movie with a consistent tone, an awareness of its own identity, and memorable characters that's definitely worth a watch.",1384128000,3,2237,4.380722891566265

4777684,4,B005LAII7G,"I enjoyed watching this film again, I was a big fan of the comics as a youngster and this a decent adaptation. As well as that it is a decent action film. It's set in the future where most of America is an irradiated wasteland, Mega City One is a vast city housing most of the remaining population. The city is rife with crime, things are so bad that the judges are empowered as judge, jury and executioners as needed. A new drug called slow-mo (which also provides a nice reason for some of the special effects) has hit the streets and as part of this three pushers are murdered. Judge Dredd and a rookie called Anderson investigate the murders and find themselves trapped inside the block. They then have to battle their way out.

The set up is very similar to The Raid (another excellent action film) and while the story isn't particularly unique it is sufficient to keep things interesting through the film.

For me the real problem was the setting, it didn't really fill the fantasy created in the comics. It has glimpses of it, but for the most part is little different from a modern environment. This in part  reflects the low budget for the film.

However it's strengths far outweigh that minor complaint. The main plus for me was Dredd himself, Karl Urban does portray the character I imagined while reading the comics. The other characters are also well played, Anderson contrasts well with Dredd as the rookie judge being assessed.

4777946,3,B005LAII7G,"I'll start off by saying, I am a fan of the first Judge Dredd movie.

I've never read the comic but I really liked the character and the atmosphere of the Dredd world which I why I chose to watch this one.

This is a Reboot of the Judge Dredd world and was more or less a hit or miss of the recreation IMHO.

Pros

Great atmosphere! You really get a feel of a city in chaos in this movie.
Decent characters - They did well with the casting, (I really liked the boss and her story).
Good effects - (albeit reused over and over) they still looked cool.
Pretty good story/setup - It's the classic one building setup (think Die Hard 1 style). I've seen it before but it doesn't lose points for lack of originality.

Cons
(Why I titled this More Judge, Less Dredd).

Lack of back story - Where is Dredd??? You see him for 90% of the picture but you really don't know anything about him. No flashback, no word of mouth tales, no nostalgic banter between him and his rookie. Heck I ended up caring more about the Main Boss then I did about Dredd and his rookie because they told more about her back story then anyone else. In fact (I'm ashamed to say) while watching it, I actually mistook Dredd for one of the other Judges in one of the scenes because he really doesn't stand out.

Less Dread - (this is nit picky but important to my personal experience) to the point above, if you are gonna leave Dredd's back story out and just make him out as a veteran Judge then make him feared as such. There is only one reference to the might of this veteran judge in the movie. I was really hoping they would amp up his legendary status, bad guys should be frozen in fear (heck peeing their pants) when they hear that judge DREDD has entered the vicinity. He is like the famous Batman, striking fear into the hearts of criminals is his primary weapon. Yet while watching the movie I felt he was only experienced but not feared.

Inconsistencies (lazy story telling) - the rookie is a mind reader (maybe this was a comic thing that I missed). Okay whatever I'll go with it, she says she doesn't wear her helm (very important while bullets are flying around) because it interferes with her powers. Yet towards the end of the movie guess what she does ... yes she reads the mind of someone wearing the helmet. This could have been easily remedied with a slick ploy to get said person to remove the helm first but ... no, consider the ball dropped.

This is supposed to be a lawless world, there is a scene where our cute young rookie gets placed in a perilous situation with numerous murderous thugs with intentions of ravening her. Inexplicably the cold blooded boss (breaks character) has a change of heart and orders them not to touch her. Personally I'm glad because I didn't want that to happen to her but at the same time I'm like don't put her in that position if don't want your film to take that direction. Please understand that ""You are breaking my IMMERSION."" Either this is a lawless immoral land or it's not, don't try to walk the line (again lazy story telling).

Less Dredd World - I like the one tower thing, Die hard Throwback. At the same time, this meant sacrificing on a variety of bad guys and scenery. No more mutated cannibalistic scavengers in the ""cursed earth"" waste lands, no more freakishly huge robots (ohh i missed them), and was I the only person waiting for him to say ""double-whammy""?. The fact is you get very little feel for the city or the Dredd world at all because of this setup.

If this was my first Judge Dredd Movie, I feel like I would have learned nothing about the (main) characters or the important footnotes of Dredd world. Again simple ploys (such as newscaster reports or rumor dialogue) could have filled in this blanks or helped flush out this expansive world that we never get to see.

Over hyped slow mo effect - We get it, Matrix made it cool. Now every action movie, video game, and music video has to show the slow mo effect. Dredd introduces a new gimmick drug that allows the user to see things in slow motion. Since they can't react to what they see (which would have been cool) it just becomes a blatant ploy to show slow motion shots every so often (reference lazy story telling).

All in all I would rate this 2.5/5 for completely average. It was an average tale about an experienced judge (cop) in an average setting.

Worth seeing? Yes if you like action flicks, moments of hyper violence and slow motion sequences.

Just expect to see more Judges and less of the world that is Dredd.",1383436800,,4531,4.390214797136038

The future world in this story is not over the top, Dredd rides a souped up motorcycle, and never takes his helmet off, EVER. But his character, though somewhat one-dimensional, is not an over-the-top tough guy, he literally treats each action as a case and meters out sentences according, usually letter the punishment fit the crime. Though his trainee, with the ability to read thoughts, makes him aware that justice should not be blind to harsh realities within a suspect's life. No academy awards here, but decent acting and solid characters like the villain, Ma-Ma. (Cersei Lannister)

The gore is violent and ultra-realistic, so be-warned. But this is a grim but fun take on the comic book hero( which I haven't read), and I hope they make a sequel to go deeper into Dredd's psyche and explore more of the future world and politics behind the Judges.",1382918400,,1041,4.810055865921788

I have read the Judge Dredd comics and I loved them. I was excited the for the first one with Stallone. I watched that one only once. :) As one commenter pointed out, the movie discards the fluff that was present in the first version. This is a great adaptation of the comic book character. Just plain ole judgement. Nothing more and nothing less. It is gritty and the camera work is great.

Additionally, the acting is good. There are no weird characters or cheesy lines. Most importantly, it is action packed all the way. No introspection or pensive moments boring you to death.",1382745600,,641,4.47008547008547

I love 3D movies and own quite a few of them. I don't think this one is worth the extra $. I don't understand how some other reviewers think that it's on par with Avatar. If you use Avatar and other IMAX 3D movies as a benchmark, this movie is nowhere near it. The 3D effects just don't pop out of your TV screen.

A story that could have been written by a sixth grader (as long as his vocabulary consisted mostly of a four-letter beginning with ""f"").

People are using iPhones and wearing contemporary clothes, for crying out loud. It's a fairly low-budget film, but imagination doesn't cost anything, and there's no excuse for such sloppiness.

The Director and Special Effects people should be ""judged"" for their efforts - the ""Slo-Mo"" drug scenes make us wish the drug has been ""Fast-Mo"" to get us out of this, and the psychic scenes with Anderson (Thirlby) went from reasonable to unicorn rainbows and back.

If you like automatic weapons, gun fire, graphic death scenes with lots of blood, Dredd meets your needs. If you are looking for Doctor McCoy from Urban, watch Start Trek again.

This new version takes place in a single location but full of action. Cool effects and when I tell you in this movie hero runs out of bullets, believe it. Dredd goes into a Mega building block  to investigate murder of three people with a rookie assign to him to evaluate, things go bad to worse. he gets trapped in the building with almost 100 drug users who has automatic weapons. Instead of hiding and trying to stay alive until back up arrives ( one he hopes he might get), best defense is offense, he starts hunting down these drug cartel members and destroys their drug lab finally killing the leader, a prostitute turn drug dealer. You will enjoy the movie. no nudity but lots of violence and gore. You decide how old your kid should be to watch it.

But, I was bored, I have Amazon Prime, and it did not cost me anything.  So, for a free movie, it was not a bad way to waste some time when there was NOTHING on tv.

The actor that plays Judge Dred, Karl Urban maybe, wears a helmet that covers the top half of his face, after about half the movie, you realize that he ""hisses"" every word, and that he speaks through his teeth, grimacing, kind of like Clint Eastwood in the old Spaghetti-westerns.  It starts to be kind of funny.

At best, I give this two stars.  (Because, in the end, it did not irritate me so bad I stopped watching, and there were some interesting effects and characters, plus the premise is interesting.)  I actually stopped watching it one night, and watched the rest two nights later, so it did not even really keep me interested enough to keep from giving up once and going to bed.  I only finished it out of boredom, morbid curiosity to see if they could pull it out in the end, and out of some insane homage to the old Sylvester Stallone movie that wasted an hour and a half from my youth.

Honestly, you get the feeling that it could have been good, maybe at least halfway good, if they had just had a better script or something.  Who knows?

So, if you're really bored, have nothing else to do, and have Amazon Prime, then you might waste a bit of time with this movie.  However, if you have any other available options open, explore them.",1381968000,,1562,4.290102389078498

you won't get to in this film.  I'm not a Dredd fan, so this review is from the
perspective of someone that wanted to enjoy the sight of Karl Urban, and only got
to see his lips and chin.

This action film has all the shooting and strategizing against
the bad guys that you'd expect, but the director adds some very interesting, colorful
(not just red) angles and shots (pun intended) that make this different than
the regular shoot 'em up movies.

Dredd is on the job and testing a rookie at the same time.  His and his partner's near
heroic and impossible against all odds adventure appears to be a typical day on the job,
nothing that would cause Dredd to sweat or worry. He goes into a large village of a building
where unemployment is greater than 90%.  Soon Dredd and his rookie partner are in
a battle between them and Ms. Drug Lord, who placed a reward on killing Dredd so that
even the citizens will be interested in bringing Dredd & rookie down.

I gave it four stars due to the interesting slow motion sequences because it was very
different, colorful and there was much to see in these shots, something different enough

If your looking for an Oscar worthy film, this isn't it, but sci-fi flicks have their own type of energy that keeps them on the shelf long after many critically lauded films (Ordinary Lives vs the Fifth Element!).",1381190400,,597,4.486238532110092
4779585,3,B005LAII7G,"Spoilers ahead.

This movie was ok, despite its faults until the ridiculous machine gun scene.  The logistics of the scene make no sense whatsoever.  You have gigantic machine guns that cut through steel that are shot accross an entire floor, yet the floor does no collapse and you really have no idea how anyone got away because, even suspending belief, no one would have gotten away.  Yet they do.  And then, for some reason, they go back in without waiting for backup, or explaining the severity of the situation to their headquarters. And the villain sees Dredd and he sees her, and she doesn't shoot him with her gigantic machine guns that are still loaded right in front of her...and..well, you get the point

And then, the 'big reveal' is that the drug dealer that is trying to kill them is, in fact, a drug dealer trying to kill them.

And put on top of that a useless psychic woman cliche who never seems to know what the guy next to her (or the drug dealer) is thinking or going to do, which results in her obligatory capture.

And a silly looking firework bullet that clearly wouldn't have hurt anyone that turns the tide for Dredd.

The CGI is excessive and bad, just as the excessive violence in the movie that serves no real purpose.  CGI Squibs are lame and obvious.

And, of course, making a Dave Chapelle lookalike as the 2nd in command constantly made my brain scream 'what?!'.

Then, Dredd becomes psychic after being shot and the baddy lets him make an exceptionally dumb speech.

And the other medics and judges all just casually and dumbly wait outside all night and when the doors open they casually stroll in, no big deal.  Just a joke

A real joke.

Wanted to like this, but it isn't even as good as the Stallone vehicle.  At least that one was intentionally funny, the city looked good, and it didn't rely on cgi.",1381190400,,1839,4.507552870090635

A-list acting, terrific effects, and a plot with enough twists to keep you wanting.

4779696,3,B005LAII7G,"Judge Dredd as a comic anti-hero should translate better to the movies than the first two attempts.  At least in the first version of the movie, Stalone took his helmet off and was semi-human.  In this version Karl Urban, who is actually very good in these types of movies (loved him in The Chronicles of Riddick) never takes his helmet off, and just walks around as a semi-automaton, shooting stuff up.

Judge Dredd reflects a future where crime is so pervasive that the justice system has combined the primary law functions into a single human - if you can call them that.  The woman who plays his mentee/cadet starts out human - too human, and eventually becomes another uncaring walking justice system dispensing justice (I mean death).

These movies would be more appealing if they dealt more with the inner conflict a judge encounters, being also the jury and executioner.  This movie just has them not caring at all.

Being a sci-fi and horror flick aficionado I certainly can understand the need for violence in some cases for theatric emphasis.  But this movie is the definition of mostly pointless and gratuitous violence that really does not attach well to the story.  If you are going to that, add humor like the Arnold movies.  This movie has ZERO laughs.  None.

The story was decent, and moved along at a reasonable clip.  Plenty of action.  My only complaint if that they over used the ""slowmo"" drug effect quite a bit.

4780047,5,B005LAII7G,"Mega City 1; a vast, sprawling metropolis, home to 800 million citizens, housed in enormous hive-like tower-blocks. Crime is rampant and is only kept in check by a department of brutal, unforgiving lawmen known as ""Judges""; enforcers and executioners combined. Dredd is the best of them... he IS the law.

Dredd is a comic book hero (or perhaps anti-hero) who made his appearance in the British sci-fi comic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/2000AD/dp/1781080089/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">2000AD</a>&nbsp;during the mid seventies. Ironically, he didn't appear until the second edition (or ""Prog"") of the comic (ironic because Dredd is unarguably one of that comic's most iconic creations). The story lines were at first glance relatively simple action adventure affairs but underlying them were some fairly complex (for a pre-teen reader) socio-political concepts. They also strayed far and wide from their action roots to cover romance, road-movie and comedy themes as well.

While earlier generations grew up with Biggles, Bulldog Drummond and Dan Dare, mine had Dredd.

Now, there has been one&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/previous-attempt-to-film-Judge-Dredd/dp/B009YOH62S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">previous attempt to film Judge Dredd</a>&nbsp;- Stallone's depiction is almost universally despised by true fans of the ultimate lawman, but I honestly didn't find the film too bad. As I remember it, the visualisation of the whole Dredd concept was done surprisingly well and even Sly managed to convince me ""Eye am the leaurgh!"". The film's most egregious crime was to allow Dredd to remove his helmet - something that only happened twice in the comic (once blanked out by a ""c e n s o r e d"" sticker and then with his face swaddled in bandages. Dredd is a faceless embodiment of the harsh justice of MC1, but also an enigma, a ""man-with-no-name (actually, it's ""Joe"") and the helmet is a symbol of his unrelenting pursuit of ""justice"". But that's enough about the previous film... how do Urban (Dredd), Garland (writer) and Travis (director) fare in this ""reboot""?

Well, mostly good, but I'll start with the bad. Well, not especially ""bad"", but the look of MC1 is not quite the thing as far as I'm concerned. I saw the metropolis as a far denser, darker, more vertical place - more like Manhattan or Hong Kong than the wide open city, studded with city-blocks that we see in the film. It was also a much more futuristic city. In ""Dredd"" we are presented with a very 20th/21st Century place, where everyone drives VW Combi Vans instead of hover cars. You could have taken out Joe Dredd and replaced him with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Harry-Calahan/dp/B002MZ1UQE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Harry Calahan</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Popeye-Doyle/dp/B0000X7S7U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Popeye Doyle</a>&nbsp;and the film wouldn't have suffered (much). That was the only real disappointment, however.

Urban wears the helmet and the badge drokking well. Dredd's comic book nickname is ""Old Stoneface"" and Urban has that trademark grimace down to a tee. So he earns top marks as a robotic, emotionless lawman. And he never removes his helmet. His acting support is a little variable, however. Olivia Thirlby does well enough as a rookie side-kick but her&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Judge-Anderson/dp/1906735220/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Judge Anderson</a>&nbsp;is far too young and vulnerable and insufficiently highly strung for my taste. Lena Heady is amazingly good as a spaced out narc overlord, sexy and brutal by turns, and she steals the film in her scenes. She has a seemingly endless army of rather forgettable henchmen so the film boils down to her interaction with JD, with a side-order of Thirlby looking good and (eventually) kicking butt.

The story is (unlike this review) suitably cut down and simple. Judges vs perps and there's only one possible outcome. That's all you need for this sort of a deal. I'll admit that the ending was a bit of a let-down and perhaps could have been done better - but then maybe we are just too used to the neatly packaged Hollywood crescendo-ending where morals are drawn and sequels are hinted at. Sometimes in life, things do simply end on a flat note.

Ah yes. The blood. There is a fair bit of that, I can tell you. Well - more than a fair bit, to be honest and ""Dredd"" easily lives up to it's 18 certificate. Indeed, I can't think of any more gruesome film (not that I seek them out) and it appears that the director and cinematographer decided to make the gore a bit of an art form for this movie. Blood, guts and bursting bodies we clearly at the top of their ""themes"" list when they started work on the storyboard. Indeed, there IS an element of beauty to the treatment of the violence and death here - the slow-mo passage of a bullet through a human head, the Pollockesque sprays of blood and brains. It may be amovie for a lover of cinematographic art, but it is NOT a movie for the squeamish.

Certainly the cinematography is very well done - the movie looks a million dollars with some startlingly vivid imagery (and I'm not just talking about the blood and guts). I only watched it in HD 2D but I can imagine that it's probably a seminal 3D film as well.

This release is backed up by a number of fairly dull and brief ""making of"" mini documentaries and some particularly soul-less talking head interviews with the actors and creators.

A startlingly gory, fairly simplistic but very enjoyable action film. I would give it five-stars for the watching experience and general treatment of the Dredd concept, and would mark it down one half of a star for it's poor depiction of the Mega City.

4780053,5,B005LAII7G,"Dredd greatness lies in its simplicity. As seen in some other reviews, Dredd is Die Hard meets Robocop in a action film that refuses to let up its pace for its relatively short hour and a half run time. The movie is refreshing in that there's no filler, no attempts at shoehorning in a romance or character moments that don't quite belong. Instead Dredd goes for a well shot, well executed action movie with all of the fat trimmed, and what's remaining is pure fun. I'm not typically an action movie fan due to the lack of plot and characters, but Dredd does what it needs to with its characters and nothing more, focusing the rest of their resources on making an outstanding action movie. Highly recommended.",1380672000,2,709,4.590551181102362

4780153,4,B005LAII7G,"Karl Urban is a much better Dredd than Stallone...I don't much blame Sly's portrayal including a more human element but Dredd is the epitome of faceless raw vigilante justice.  Only in Mega City 1 he is the Law.  You can recall Chris Nolan's Bruce Wayne waxing about symbolism in Batman Begins--- that's why the Dark Knight wears the cowl and that is why Judge Dredd should NEVER take off his helmet.  Karl Urban understands this and although he has bemoaned his headgear in previous films (Eomer in LOTR, Vaako in Riddick) he uses his voice and body language to great effect.
Now I have by no means been a regular reader of the Dredd comics but what I have read sporadically over the last 20 years is an indication that it is unmined gold for a film franchise.  This movie is complete in itself and only introduces a few of the major players in the comics-- and only a small theme of block war--leaving much left to be explored in the future.
Mega City is truly immense and is as much a character in Dredd as New York is in the Marvel Universe or Gotham City is in The Dark Knight.  Although in this universe the city is full of gratuitous violence and blood/gore, so that turns some casual viewers off.  Nevertheless it is faithful to its source material so I was pleased with this movie and highly recommend it to Scifi fans and anyone who enjoys good popcorn fun.",1380499200,,1367,4.448

4780361,5,B005LAII7G,"I'll just start out by saying I LOVE this movie.  I watched it three times in the theaters, and have watched it a dozen times since I purchased the Blu-ray.  That being said, this movie isn't perfect. None of them are.  But for staying true to the source material, and absolutely NAILING the character (Karl Urban IS Dredd), this movie does it right.  This is NOT a remake of that travesty ""Judge Dredd"" done by Sylvester Stallone.  It's fine if you like that film, to each their own.  But those that feel this movie was bad because it wasn't like that film, understand this...it's not SUPPOSED to be like that film.  I hesitate to even call this a reboot, primarily because you have to acknowledge that the Stallone version exists to do so.  To those that can't stand this portrayal of Dredd or the fact that he never removes his helmet, I URGE you to do some background checking on the character.  Judge Dredd has been running continuously since the 70's, and the one and only time he showed his face, they censored it.  Which means he NEVER shows his face....EVER.  To truly enjoy this movie, I believe that knowing something about the character and the world he operates in is important.  It is possible to enjoy it without that knowledge, but you'll miss out on some of the nuances.  If violence and blood and a stoic main character don't appeal to you, then this probably isn't the right movie for you.  But for those with a heartier constitution, and especially ANYONE that has a remote interest in the Dredd universe, SEE THIS FILM.  It was such a shame that this movie didn't get the attention it deserved when it was in the theaters.  But it's not too late...",1380499200,,1669,4.531772575250836
4780362,4,B005LAII7G,"What I liked;

1.  Cool effects not seen in other movies (i.e. the slow motion, blood splattering, etc.).
2.  Shallow character development (it worked in this movie with Dredd...he is what he is).
You don't need to care much about these characters.  Again, it works for this kind of movie.
3.  Some good action and cool concepts around shooting and blowing things up.
4.  Some light comedy that gets lost in the misery.  Really, this is just a blood bath movie
based on a miserable human existence in the future.
5.  Predictability is good in some movies.  It worked here.

What I didn't like:
1.  The acting by the female judge lead.  It isn't very good or convincing.  If you are
going to be boring at least be really good looking and sexy in the process. (Although the
intra-mind action was intriguing).
2.  The plot could have been developed better even in a shallow movie.
3.  It actually lacked some action that could have made Dredd a better character to watch
(i.e. get him some more big guns or toys to blow stuff up).

Overall, it wasn't what I expected yet I was pleasantly surprised.  Of course, I watched it
without my fiancee.  This is a guys movie all the way (although some ladies will like it).

Go for it.  Just don't say I didn't warn you if you don't like it.",1380499200,,1279,4.431034482758621

For some reason, I really like the Judge Anderson character, there just something about her, maybe because she was the underdog, or maybe she used her psychic powers on me.

Therein we find Dredd: police, jury, executioner.  His face never breaks scowl.  His persona is that of tightly wound sociopath just on this side of moral goodness.  The dialogue is sparse, both literally and in terms of irritating exposition.  It is also one of the few if only action films that portrays the female protagonists as simply people (equals) and not a mewling female in need, or some lesser than sex secondary to men.  It's pretty damned bad ass.  I loved everything about this film and was disappointed that it didn't do better domestically.

Bladerunner was made over 30 years ago and I was more convinced I was in the future over this film.

Karl Urban was a great judge and gave his all to sell the part convincingly enough even though at times it looked as though he was possessed by ""Grumpy Cat"". Still love the guy and anything he does.

Maybe I just wasn't in the mood for this type of film, but I found it a bit slow and boring and the whole rookie test pass/fail plot felt a bit lacking, just another day for Dredd I've heard some reviewers say? I don't think so , who gets impaled on a daily basis and then goes to work the next day, nope!",1380067200,2,999,4.197916666666667

In fact, I don't think Dredd ever takes his helmet off. The fact that the movie didn't rely on cheap CGI and silly affects for most of it actually makes this better than I think it would have been if there had been more CGI affects. The movie feels more raw, almost like it could have been made in the late 1980's rather than recently. It also had a good soundtrack that fit the style of the movie. Its not one I would listen to outside of watching the movie, but it really helped to set the tone of the film. It provided an emotional element that was not provided by the characters.

First of all, this is not a family film, and this is not a movie that should be watched around individuals who are prone to idiotic adaptations of films into real life situations. Although this is true, this movie was good.

Pros:
The relationship between the two main characters was admirable. I enjoyed the fact that the male and female characters were not coupled. In most movies, you expect a sex scene or a kiss, and I am glad that this was not enforced.
The characters are gritty, and tough both male and female.

Great action

Nothing was overly emotionalized.

The visual aspects were fairly well made and managed.

Cons:
The sound ranged from high to low really fast, and I found myself adjusting it to hear more in certain parts, and hear less in others.

The scenes were pretty intense, and no gore was left to the imagination. (could also be a pro)",1379894400,3,933,4.523809523809524

Dredd is set in a bleak, dystopian, post nuclear world where it feels as though humanity is on its last leg. The comics depicted this clearly, and it's a treat to see the director bring this realism to the screen. There is no watering down, or shying away from that fact. Karl Urban loses himself in the title character and is at once stoic and yet shows a man 1-2 steps away from going over the edge at all times. The film is concise, driven and gripping. Karl Urban has been delivering amazing roles to the screen for some time now, and after this work, the man should finally take the lead in a main studio push.",1379808000,3,788,4.331081081081081

This movie was done badly the first time round with Sylvester Stallone, including the cardinal sin of removing his helmet and making him into a cheesy character. Dredd is not a deep character, the comics only portrayed him in one dimension, as a faceless symbol of by necessity brutal, hard-bitten law enforcement officers in a grim future world - yet a man apart with his own legend and identity. Dredd is flawed, and Karl urban plays him to perfection, with surprising nuances in his performance. He brings to life a character that hints at something beyond the limited range one would anticipate from a man hiding deliberately behind a helmet - and brings us ""The"" Judge Dredd. His voice, movement, gesture and gravitas tell us all we need to know - it's a superb performance. He is Dredd.

Dredd's  sidekick provides the emotional outlet, with a relatable, vulnerable character learning to cope and survive in a raw, gritty world. She is human with strong emotional motivation, yet she becomes a bad-ass judge as the movie reaches its conclusion.

The villain is played to perfection - cold, cruel, ruthless and utterly callous. I would compare the movie to Die Hard and (maybe more so) Robocop as a Bad Ass cop movie, and it goes down in my Hall Of Fame for being a superb action movie with fantastic characters with a tense, totally bad ass story line.

I've forgotten the Stallone version of the film, which was embarrassing (Love The Expendables, so all is forgiven ;) - this is The Dredd movie we always wanted.

I hope we have part 2 in the works, I loved it and will see it again.

Buy it on Blu-Ray, you'll love it.",1379721600,3,1832,4.601226993865031

I wish the film would have done better at the box office ($35M budget/$13.4M gross) so that sequels could be made. I would love to see more stories with Karl playing Dredd.

4781663,4,B005LAII7G,"Being a long time fan of John Wagner's Judge Dredd comic, I came into this movie with little to no expectations.  Comic book fans have been forced into a sort of prolonged cynicism in regards to movie adaptations.  So many poor movie makers, like Chris Nolan and his ilk have been granted access to these properties with little to no oversight or knowledge until now, comic movies are by and large purely trash.  This movie is an exception.  I took away the feeling that the makers of this movie were actually fans and somewhat knowledgeable of the very things that make comic books enjoyable and vital.
Not to say that this is an accurate depiction of an actual comic book.  In all fairness though, I don't see how a movie could be.  It is like the difference between Star Wars and a Moebius comic.  The movies were visually styled after his artwork but really look nothing like it.  So instead the makers gave us the ""feel"" of Judge Dredd.  The style in which they worked is very John Carpenter and it is a perfect fit.  Recreating this in a digital format is in itself quite an accomplishment.  Their ability to mimic the look of 1970's-80's Carpenter action movies within a brand new filming technique is a great sign for all filmmakers.  The technology seems to work well.
Karl Urban does a fantastic job of portraying Joe Dredd.  He adeptly captured the stoicism of the character with simple lines and excellent physical acting.  Urban has become known for this ability throughout his career and was an excellent casting.

Nothing says enjoyable movie time like seeing someone's brains coming out of the back of their head.

Some people might be surprised Karl Urban's the star of this, but given the depth he puts into his roles, it's a perfect fit. He *is* Dredd, not Sylvester Stallone playing someone named Dredd. Given the disappointment of the Robocop trailer and likely the film that will follow it, this definitely is the antidote to concerns that they just don't make movies like the original Robocop anymore.

They made a believable world, and this is one story of one day in that world.

I've watched it about three times now, and listened to the soundtrack many, many more and I don't think I'll ever get sick of either.",1379548800,2,673,4.7844827586206895

Karl Urban maintains a constant pained frown throughout the whole ordeal and never once shows his face. Every second of this movie is brilliant cinema.

This also competes heavily with Coraline 3d for my favorite use of 3d in a movie. This is one of those films which it is worth buying a 3d tv for.

I thought I might get tired of the film after a while, but I'm up past view 15 now and I would watch it at least 50 more times. I'm sure I will too.

Dredd was a real sleeper in the brief time it was showing which I blame on that piece of garbage Rob Schneider was in a number of years back. I suspect everyone just steered clear because of latent fears and memories of that movie.

This is an action/crime heist/comic book film with innovation.  It doesn't just show mindless shootouts with shaky camera and cliched dialogue/plot development in between.  The film is an innovative, artistic approach to the genre, while also providing enough thrilling action sequences and over-the-top gore.  In other words, it's got something for everyone.

I had the distinct privilege of seeing ""Dredd"" at Comic-Con this past summer with my buddies from JoBlo.com at its first public screening and it's an experience I'll never forget. Having been a fan of the Judge Dredd/2000 AD comics since I was a young kid, I've always dreamed that one day a group of filmmakers would deliver the perfect Dredd film and boy did they ever with this one. Karl Urban absolutely owned the role along with a terrific supporting cast, classic hardcore 80's style action, a kick-ass techno score and also surprisingly good writing. It's my greatest hope that this finds a strong following after releasing on Blu-Ray cause I can't imagine this not having sequels, it's too good to let go of.",1379462400,2,945,4.733333333333333
4782248,5,B005LAII7G,"Just to add to the list of 5 star reviews here, I just gotta say that this movie ruled. The 3D is the best I've ever seen. But it's not just visual gimmicks; the movie is well-paced and just gritty enough to illustrate its world without being a parody of itself.

I've heard some people voice their dislike that Judge Dredd is a boring character; one-dimensional. My view is, there's more to him under the helmet. I have often thought about becoming a police officer. There is a struggle inside, a struggle between being yourself and obeying your animal needs, or, sacrificing your ego, and devoting yourself to a code, so that you can help others and keep what's left of your society intact. That's who I think Dredd is. And I think they portrayed him well.

Here's some minor spoilers to add to my analysis: When Dredd has to stun those two kids who pull guns on him, I could really hear the concern and sincerity when he leaped to the side and yelled, ""Stun!"" before he put those kids out for a bit. Urban threw in compassion into that line. Also, when it's all over, and he's asked what happened, all he says is, ""Drug bust."" As if it were just another day. I love it. Little things like that make a big character like Dredd, and I don't think he gets enough credit.

The music is also awesome and noteworthy. It's pulsing and carries the film well. The futuristic setting, while not as wacky as the original comics, is still fresh and realistic; I can picture it happening.

This is the type of movie that I love like a great album. If I'm hanging out at my apartment and just need something on, I'll just put it on, and inevitably get drawn into it. We need more movies like this these days, to balance out the over-the-top-with-meticulous-CGI, ADD explosion-fests, a la Michael Bay's Transformers movies. So, here we have a tight, well-paced action/sci-fi flick that will be up there with the ranks of RoboCop, The Terminator, and other 80's classics. Nothing is superfluous, and everything is perfect.

Here's my part to help make a sequel. 5 Stars. Thanks, guys.",1379462400,3,2071,4.556451612903226

It's got great action, good characters and a deeper narrative and message that is only there if you want it. It does not hit you over the head with some great social narrative, and there is no cringe inducing dialogue where they try to draw a connection to modern day society. It's just a solid action flick.

Mega City looks the way you would expect it to and really feels like the overpopulated hell hole that you see in the pages of 2000 AD. And finally, the rating means just what you think it does. This film is heavy, dark, violent, and definitely intended for adult viewers...and the results are amazing. Watch the film. Buy the film.

For those comparing it to ""The Raid: Redemption"", don't. ""Raid"" went into production AFTER Dredd, and they rushed their movie to market (which shows) after they ripped off the Dredd storyline.

4782906,5,B005LAII7G,Great action movie much better then the stalone version. One underrated comic book movie that needed more attention. 5 stars,1379462400,2,124,5.25

4782908,5,B005LAII7G,"Unfortunately, this movie did very poorly at the box office both in the states and the rest of the world but don't let that fool you, this movie is worth watching. By no means is it the best movie ever made but it's a bloody good time (no pun intended). It's good to see a comic book adaptation not only be very faithful to the source material but maintain a adult rating as well (I guess the two go hand in hand). The story is fairly straightforward but it's well written enough to keep you intrigued until the end. Karl Urban is fantastic as Dredd and the supporting cast is great, with the standout being Lena Heady as the antagonist ""Mama"".

I'm not particularly well versed in the Judge Dredd lore but I throughly enjoyed this movie. It's got spectacularly gruesome action, great acting and a well written story. If you're looking for a great action movie that provides a little more substance than most then check this out.",1379462400,2,929,4.497041420118343
4783078,5,B005LAII7G,"This is a great, great movie. I mean, really great. Not because of plot, or pacing, or layering, or special effects -- though all of those are pretty darn stellar -- but great because the people who made it cared deeply about staying true to the Dredd character. You can tell, because of the obvious thought, caring, and detail that went into their effort. The surest giveaway that this movie is more than it seems is that Dredd's helmet is never removed -- his full face is never revealed. Brilliant. Dredd-the-movie is more of a character study than anything else, though disguised, ironically and self-referentially, as an action flick. Karl Urban's portrayal of Dredd is perfect -- conveying a deeply sympathetic character, flawed and striving, instead of the all-too-usual cardboard-cutout action hero. In this movie, Dredd is someone that you actually want to get to know, and someone you miss when the movie ends. The supporting actors and actresses are superb and again carry much richer characters than a typical action flick. This is a movie made by people who cared, and it shows. Five stars and fingers crossed for a sequel!",1379376000,2,1136,4.921875

It was the best Dredd movie by far and would like to see them do more with this franchise.  I doubt they will because it seems many people were like me and did not give it a chance.

I like plot, not big explosion-filled brain dead fests, and this made it among my top 5 movies, so it's not a mind-numbing experience.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying this is the height of plot-development, I'm just demonstrating that if you think it is just a stupid shoot-em up, it isn't.  Give this a try, you won't regret it.",1379289600,2,492,4.556818181818182

While the plotline has changed, and the sidekick is kinda cute (subjective, but this is an opinion anyway), it's still somewhat predictable. Definitely some interesting moments though. Action's ok if you take into account that, as with most other action flicks, they dodge bullets with the best of them and seem to survive a lot that's thrown at them, including armor piercing rounds!",1379289600,,491,4.927710843373494

At first both myself and my husband were hesitant because well, quite honestly we expected it to suck. But I heard good things about it and it was free so what the heck. Partway through the movie I started thinking that Dredd was Karl Urban and to my surprise, it was!! Even though all you could see was his mouth he was really great as Dredd. His posture, tone, there was a scene where he knew he was screwed and even though you can't see his face, it really says it all. Great movie. What a surprise. I wasn't really a fan of the slow-motion scenes, I think they were a little too long, but the whole movie was pretty great.

The script seems like it was taken from an 80's action movie (Cobra 2?). Characters and set seem like they were recycled from another movie.

I like violent movies BUT he and I generally like the same types of movies so I decided missing it was not a big deal.

Now I am FURIOUS again that I did not get to see this movie in theaters.

Yes, this movie was EXTREMELY violent but it is Dredd.  When was Judge Dredd ever supposed to be a pacifist?

I enjoyed the over all storyline and the inclusion of a psychic and corrupt judges.  I hope there is a sequel and am actually thinking about watching this movie again tonight.",1379203200,3,670,4.147286821705427

It definitely earned an ""R"" rating for the violence. Frankly, I could have done with a little less of that BUT it was clear that the extreme nature of the villains demanded extreme measures to stop them. Karl Urban was appropriately dour for the entire movie. He had a tough acting job since he never removed his helmet so we never saw his eyes.

There is no overarching statement behind anything in the film other than possibly, ""Don't be a bad guy cause bad guys get killed.""

I like Karl Urban and want to root for his career, but he doesn't have much of a chance to do anything in this movie. Not his fault. He's stuck under the gigantic Judge helmet without exception through the entire movie and seems to have been directed to be as one-note as possible.

Lena Headey delivers the same, unexciting, perma-sour-face performance that she has made so famous, (and so disappointingly) as Cercei Lanister on Game Of Thrones. Not much to get excited about there.

Mostly, you should watch this movie only if you can appreciate lots and lots of bullets flying and explosions and blood spattering with almost no decent story, dialogue, acting, or point.",1379203200,,962,4.680473372781065

In the future, Boston to D.C. has merged to one city, Mega City One. Judges are essentially cops, judges, juries, and sometimes executioners all in one. A crime is committed in a building, and Dredd and his trainee go to investigate. What looked like a routine investigation turns into a battle for Dredd and his trainee as they try to escape the building.

If you're looking for something deep, this isn't the movie for you. If you're just looking for some action and a well made film, then you should definitely give Dredd a try.",1379116800,2,746,4.398550724637682

Yeah, the special effects were indicative of a lower budget movie.  The story itself was very interesting and entertaining.  The movie is fast paced with great action.  Instead of being all over the place, the bulk of the movie takes place in one location - that location is a huge 'apartment' building.
Urban does a great job as Dredd.  He doesn't play it over the top - he's plays Dredd very straight forward.  I think that was key to my enjoyment to the movie.
I read a lot of reviews going through every minute detail of movies.  I don't do that at all.

4783932,4,B005LAII7G,"I'm not a fan of most comic-book film adaptations. I couldn't care less - they are almost all terrible. Even Joss Whedon (who is incredibly talented) couldn't make a good film out of the ""Avengers"" - he could only make an otherwise dismal plot reasonably entertaining. ""Captain America"", ""Iron Man"", ""Spider Man"", ""Batman/Dark Knight"", ""Wolverine"", ""Superman""... billions of dollars being wasted on the cinematic equivalent of a Domino's Pizza. Awful, but somehow consumed by masses of people without a second thought (apparently a million a day worldwide - fun fact).

Now I know, most of my complaints so far are about Disney/Marvel movies. These are clearly cynically pumped out as part of a Goldmanesque moneymaking scheme aimed at defrauding twenty and thirty-somethings of the treasured comic-book memories of their youth. Unfortunately I also find the majority of ""arthouse"" comic-book films to be entirely worthless as well. Take ""V for Vendetta"", ""The 300"", ""Sin City"", ""Blade""... none of these (OK, I didn't actually watch ""The 300"", I watched a preview, passed-judgement, and went happily on with my life) were any good. I do have a soft spot for ""Blade II"" and ""Hellboy"", but mostly because the former had stylish, well-done visuals and the latter was unabashedly quirky (oh, and Guillermo del Toro is actually a really talented director, which shines through - unlike, say the labors of the Wachowski siblings, who are clearly just talentless hacks).

OK, so finally we get to ""Dredd"", which I watched because I was trying to take a short break from working and figured I could quickly tune it out or turn it off. I've seen ""Judge Dredd"", the original starring that tiny little musclebound man from the 80's, and that was awful, so low expectations were at least warranted. The beginning was all very blah, with car chases and cheesy (not so special) effects. For perhaps five to ten minutes I figured ""Dredd"" was going to live up to my very low expectations. Then something miraculous happened - good acting. So much of it that at first I was just kind of annoyed. ""Why is Karl Urban trying so hard?"" I thought to myself. ""Doesn't he know that this is a B-movie?"". But no, Karl is there acting away as if he had just landed the lead role in BladeRunner, and this female lead who I vaguely recognize as Suzanne from ""Bored to Death"" is also doing an awesome job. Then I noticed that the lead villain was also really ****ing good, and that it was actually Lena Headey buried under all that makeup. Then all of a sudden ""Dredd"" started making this sad little low-budget environment that it was confined to an interesting stage. What had been a relatively tired, generic movie had rapidly transcended into some strange, seldom reached nether-realm of cinematic awesomeness (I can only think of ""Cowboy Beebop"" and ""Ichi the Killer"" as occupying an at all similar plane of existence).

95 short minutes later I had happily watched the entire film, and damn if it wasn't actually really good. Good in a way that ""Sin City"" or ""V for Vendetta"" should have been, except the latter actually had a really great plot that was destroyed by lousy acting and terrible directing, and ""Dredd"" was a kind of inverse to ""V"" - a real treat wrapped around a generic boring plot that had been so compacted by a well-executed film that it almost seemed sarcastically self-aware.

So there you go. If you want to see a well-acted, well directed film that has substance and style beyond all expectations and the vast majority of the genre, give ""Dredd"" a viewing.",1379116800,3,3553,4.838815789473684

Also, the soundtrack is fantastic. It's in 7.1 surround and it gets your heart pumping. We only have a sound bar and separate sub woofer and it just blew us away. It's the best soundtrack that I have every heard to date. If I had room, I would purchase a home theater surround system because of this movie. I can't believe this movie did not make money but I hope with the high DVD-Blu-ray sales that it had, it made a little. I wish they would do another.
As for the acting, the main actors were just fine. They were perfect in their roles. It was well done considering the ""small"" budget they had to work with.
As for the filming, the slo-mo and the violent scenes used rich color saturation combined with high-speed photography which produced a visual treat. I've never seen that before.
The blu-ray comes with both 3-D and regular all in one disc. I have a Sony Playstation 3 so it is compatible with 3-D. I've also watched it in 2-D and it's great too.

Olivia Thirlby does a good job as Anderson and doesn't over act it.

Before watching this I heard a lot of comparisons of Die Hard meets Robocop.  For me, that comparison was way off the mark.  What made Die Hard so great was Bruce Willis' character John McClane...the every day guy stuck in the most non everyday situation.  That's what made the character so likable.  There was nothing like that here. Dredd was every bit as sterile as cyborg Murphy when he first rolled off the line, and that was it.  With Murphy, you saw some character development with him trying to find his way between his human side and his robot side.  Nothing like that here.

4784819,5,B005LAII7G,"I wish I'd trusted my gut and watched this on the big screen, but I still loved every minute on my home theater.

This movie doesn't give us a Mega-City One with the colorful flourish, scope, or futuristic backdrop of ""Judge Dredd"" from 1995, but it also has none of the camp, and all of the dark edge from the comics. This film favors a smaller story, narrowed down to one escalating conflict in a massive super-structure, large enough to cover 6 city blocks, packed with survivors, vagrants, and felons. Through this focal point we sample how cruel and self-destructive the entire slum city really is, between the various shades of drug lords, the outgunned law enforcement, and the hapless tenants caught in-between.

Unlike Sylvester Stallone's body-building white knight in Judge Dredd, Karl Urban gives us an unyielding para-military brute who never softens or blinks. It's not a physical presence so much as a tireless, deliberate stride of barely-contained fury. Stallone was beefy and boisterous, while Urban is a seething, weathered gunman who discards compassion as a liability and a distraction.

Introducing Olivia Thirlby as rookie Judge Anderson with a special, classified ""gift"", instead of as a seasoned officer, often gives audiences a counter-view to citizens' motives and emotions, which contrasts against Dredd's swift hand of punishment. Her first foray is a rough trial but it also adds a new layer to the considerations of judgement.

Lena Headey is probably the one sticking point for me. Headey does a decent job as Ma-Ma acting bat-guano crazy while keeping all her cards to herself, but it's hard to sense any direct threat from her presence. She's an unlikely villain with a reckless abandon verging on nihilism to keep her crew in line.

The violence is often intense but brief, except for the a few times the director takes the opportunity to prolong the gore. On special occasions, the drug-induced slo-mo extends the visuals to evoke a mental wince, and rightly so. Body counts rise abruptly as the story progresses. But the violence always has a purpose and I rarely found it wasted.

I know comparisons between the 2 Dredd movies are unavoidable, but for my personal take the best Dredd movie would drop the actors from the new film into the landscape and technology of the old one. Regardless, I wanted to see a dark Judge Dredd and I think that's exactly what the remake delivered.

Simply put, ""Dredd"" is a fantastic visual treat, worthwhile on its technical merits alone. Not in terms of the gimmicky 'pop-up' effects, but more along the lines of ""Avatar"": excellent depth-of-field composition, striking color palette, and stunning particle effects. Really the main negative, purchase-wise, is a lack of special features, which isn't surprising given it's a (self-described) low-budget dystopian comic-book adaptation. It's ""The Raid: Redemption"" without the martial arts, and ""Die Hard"" without the wisecracks. I don't mean this as a negative: if you love either of those films, you'll probably get a kick out of ""Dredd.""

Highly recommended for anyone as a test-your-systems product; I'd do a series with this, ""Avatar,"" and ""How to Train Your Dragon"". For the film itself, I loved it on the second watch but it's certainly not for everyone. The box art and limited marketing really don't do it justice, however.

Couple guys come in, they get killed, some struggle happens w/ main characters, then they move on. Bad guy dies, good guys win. I was hoping for a good movie & got an okay one.

If you're looking for a remake of Stallone's Dredd movie, this is not it. Only consistency between the two movies is the female counterpart & Dredd's character himself.

So about the movie, I can't remember who the director was but why he had Urban play Dredd like a clone of Sylvester Stallone is beyond me. There was always a shadow on the right side of Urban's face which is exactly where Stallone's birth defect is and he played the role like a robot. I guess Stallone was busy and didn't want to do this movie so they decided to take a really good actor like Urban and told him to bring nothing to the role other than an imitation of Stallone. But Urban pulled it off and turned in a good performance - sign of a good actor.

Karl Urban is a fantastic Dredd, and if you think you'll be disappointed by the introduction of Cassandra Anderson (Olivia Thirlby), don't be.  Her character never becomes cloying or burdensome, and she kicks a fair amount of a** in her own right.

I liked the creative style of this movie, and the acting fits just perfectly. Karl Urban uses the growl and his chin to great effect, and the sparse writing and minimal direct character interactions work marvels. And at around 1.5 hours, the length of the movie is just right as well.
It all works well together. Steady yourself for a blood bath and enjoy, especially if you're a fan of the ""Judge Dredd"" comics.

4786345,4,B005LAII7G,"When this movie was advertised, apparently I thought like most Americans and had no desire to see it in theaters. It's estimated cost of $50 million was not recouped by about $15 million. That's globally speaking. After seeing the movie last night through Prime, I have to say that I wish I saw it in a theater.

The movie is violent, with quite a lot of CGI used to depict the gory effects of projectiles and gravity. I like the no nonsense attitude of Dredd in the movie, and I like Karl Urban in the role. The female roles were well played, though I had to force myself to accept the villain was as fierce as she was supposed to be.

Dredd is seemingly immune to the harshness of the world around him and is 100% driven by his sense of right and wrong, which is the law and order that is supposed to govern citizens. I feel like without the law for him to view the world through he would be aimless. Anyway, the plot is moderately thick, leaving the viewer a lot of room to fill in voids, but not so shallow that it's a struggle to fill the voids. None of the characters are deeply changed through the course of the film, unless you count going from alive to dead as character change. Dredd learns that sometimes things aren't ""black and white,"" so to speak. Anderson is simply exposed to the harsh world of being a judge and living with the decisions she must make. She seems to be comfortable making those decisions by the end.

Dredd offers viewers visceral action with a good enough plot, deep enough characters for an action movie, and only a little post-processing to make sense of things. To me, those are the ingredients for a good action movie!",1378166400,2,1656,4.387622149837133

I went in with low expectations and was pleasantly surprised. Compared against the 1995 Dredd, the recipe for this remake is more parts serious than camp. The actor lineup is great and the characters are written with some nuance, which is refreshing.

Pacing was excellent, camera work good, effects music were good, acting was actually very good. Color choice set the scenes well, not overly dark or to clean.

If you enjoyed quick style HK action movie pace (original Infernal Affairs) and glossy camera work this will be a fun diversion. Don't expect clever dialogue (Layer Cake) or deep political introspection out of it (Elysium). Or introspective character development (Batman series).

Highlights that made it stand out over other action movies:
Characters were all competent.
Characters made smart decisions.
Female lead did a good job by not being a typical 'action movie' female. Held her own against Dredd.

Scenario was believable in context laid out, and didn't deviate from outlined material.

This is strictly a fun popcorn cruncher much better than the latest Wolverine movie made even better by it being free for amazon prime subscribers.

A few silly parts but it's worth the viewing. Grab some popcorn and enjoy it.

Being a fan of the original 2000AD comic and having been let down by the pervious Dredd film it seemed to me that this film was going to be just another 3D remake with no thought to the source material.

Long story short, I was wrong on every count.  This film gets it all right in relation to the Dredd mythology and the 3D even works.  Honestly this is one of the best uses of 3D I have ever seen, and it relates to the story instead of just being a tacked on effect.

I also want to give special nod credit to Karl Urban who plays Judge Dredd who, like the comic character does not ever take his helmet off.

Let me summarize this movie to you:

Judge Dredd growls something with supposedly scary voice.

Judge Dredd shoots.

Brains on the wall.

More brains one the wall.

4786801,4,B005LAII7G,"As a kid I hardly remember the Stallone version... I never know that a comic book existed for the film...or vice-versa. I am not a comic book fan. Regardless, this was a good movie for the rainy-no plans-nothing better to do-day I had. Actors we good and well developed. Action was alright, though they seemed to be going a bit over-board with the blood and guts approach...probably due to almost no action stunts at all in the movie. Plot was OK...an easy story to follow with a satisfying outcome if not surprising. Environment/prop/world/set development could probably have used a bigger budget. But for such a under-budgeted movie, I can appreciate what they did with what they had. It's to bad because with a bigger budget, they could have made a blockbuster. Overall, a good one-time view fun movie.

On a side note, a lot of complaining about judge always having his helmet on by others seems to be misplaced. First, this approach leaves Dredd as a mystery, which keeps things tantalizing. Much like the HALO character. I liked this approach alot. Secondly, the character Anderson is purposely missing hers. And it is not because of the lame excuse in the movie. It is so she can be the focus of acting while Dredd can do his turret-on-wheels routine which we all enjoy.",1377907200,2,1277,4.752252252252252

Instead, it was strangely...beautiful. Not only were there rock-your-face-off action sequences, and a genuinely sinister villain, but the characters and cinematography really drew me in. You'd think that not seeing Dredd's face ever would make it hard to relate to him but somehow Karl Urban manages to imbue him with humanity. And Anderson is an awesome character who is able to hold her own, be sympathetic, and be realistic all at once. I can see how some people would think this movie has no plot or is too slow, but I was really into it.

I am reviewing this for those who have no idea what the Dredd comic books were about.  Evidently they are about a desperate future where police officers are judge, jury, and executioner.
With an R rating I was expecting nudity, profanity, some violence.  This was mostly violence.  Some profanity, but not much.  There was more nudity and hardcore innuendo than profanity, but mostly it was violent.  Wish they had a V rating for obscene amounts of violence, so I would have had a bit more warning.  That said , I did watch the entire movie.  It does have a premise, story line, climax, and a fairly decent ending.  Giving this 5 stars seems unfair to other better done movies.

4787081,5,B005LAII7G,"Spoiler free review:

The story is about Judges that are unbelivably outnumbered and overstreched in a post apocalyptic urban jungle.

The story deals in large part with a drug (slo-mo) that hyper accelerates your perceptions, and the bad guys who make money from it.  Not a spoiler, you see the drug work in the first minute or so.

Dredd gets an extremely cute rookie to train for her first day, and they drop into hell.  This doesn't turn into a budding romance or anything of the sort, and if you're looking for Dredd to kiss anyone, you'll need to look elsewhere.

Many scenes use the drug to slow down perception, and the soundtrack gets underclocked to match, producing the eerie, ethereal, hauntingly beautiful music produced by slowing it down.  I have no doubt the drug idea movie was inspired by the famous Justin Bieber song ""You Smile"" slowed by about 30:1 that's floating around the internet.

The action is extremely brutal and ugly, kind of like what happens in real life when really, really evil people amuse themselves.  Seeing people get shot graphically in ultra slow motion takes away the romance of neatly mowing down rows of anonymous villians, though we were pretty much spared the screaming.

Judge Dredd fans: If you want to see what life would really look like in your hero's world, here you go.

Five stars.",1377820800,3,1335,4.760869565217392

4787083,4,B005LAII7G,"I was surprised by this film. When it was in theaters, I completely wrote it off, mostly because of the comically awful Stallone version (incidentally, a good drinking game for that version is to take a shot every time someone mentions ""THE LAW""), but when I finally gave it a shot, I was surprised by how much I liked it. It takes the source material, and makes a very solid, well paced action movie out of it. The plot is fairly simple and direct, but is well thought out for the film, and events flow fairly organically from the premise. The action is unflinching and gore-filled, and there are some beautiful slow-motion action sequences seen through the eyes of people who've used a drug that slows down perceived time, called ""slow-mo"".

It's not perfect, though. There are some implausible moments here and there, and the armor the Judges wear makes them far from nimble in a fairly obvious way. The middle section drags a bit, with samey action sequences filling it out, with little to break it up, but it picks up again towards the end, and provides a satisfying conclusion.

All in all, it's well worth the time you'll spend on it, and it'll hit the spot when you're looking for a good action flick with a reasonably well thought out plot.",1377820800,5,1249,4.596412556053812

If you take the dystopian darkness of The Road Warrior, the over the top action of The Expendables (R rated version) and the dark humor of Robocop you'll get an idea of what this movie is about.

Frankly using Karl Urban for this was a joke too. I believe he could of been a much stronger character if we actually saw his face once or twice.

The display of gratuitous violence in there wasn't even warranted. At least if you're gonna shoot everybody do it with a purpose. The bad guys falls one by one like flies (not that it's different than other movies, what's different is that the usual tougher bad guy, (bodyguard) as a better position in the film especially in defending the main villain.)

It is very violent, and not for the faint of heart or those who distain violence in their movies.  Karl Urban plays a great Dredd, and is quickly becoming one of my favorite sci-fi actors (I think he plays McCoy in the new Star Trek amazingly well).  Olivia Thirlby is great as the rookie Anderson, and provides the perfect character to balance Dredd.  The visuals are really good for such a relatively low budget film ($35 Mil).  They create a gritty, dirty, unpolished environment with a visual styling that matches the Dredd world perfectly.  The slowmo drug scenes are amazingly well done, and provide a great way to show slow motion sequences that are violently beautiful.  They aid in the story vs. just being slow motion for slow motion sake.  I already loved Lena Heady in Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles, and her role here as Ma-Ma is great.  This movie is NOTHING like the previous attempts at Judge Dredd, and really provides at Dredd that dark sci-fi fans should love.  It's a movie that I really hope gets a sequel because they have laid the groundwork with Urban and Thirlby for a great series of movies.

4787512,5,B005LAII7G,"First off, I have never read a Judge Dredd comic, so I'm no fanboy.  I have known about him since his creation, just never thought to pick one up.  The first mistake most people will be comparing this to the Sly Stallone film that was not very good.  This movie is all balls and no comic relief.  Fortunately, Dredd didn't make any misplaced puns at any time.  He was full on hard-ass from beginning to end.  The ""rookie"" Anderson also came off as a competent judge-to-be instead of a hapless tag along.
The film was a bit claustrophobic as it takes place entirely inside a building, but the action moves along fast enough to maintain interest.
Now not all was great.  The plot was pretty predicable with no unexpected twists or turns and even though they tried very hard to incorporate the 3-D effects into a specific plot point (the use of the drug Slo-Mo), it still seemed contrived (ala ""Put the mask on now!"").

4787612,5,B005LAII7G,"I will first of say that I can see how this movie will split viewers opinions right down the middle.

Personally I think its a great movie, good action sequences, very nice effects, and while never going deep into actual back story seems to be a fully fleshed out world probably reasonably loyal to the comics that spawned it.  (never read them so can't say for certain)

I love Karl Urban's Dredd, he's a tough guy in a tough world.  He's a total badass and seems to not really care that he is, he's just doing his job its just what he does.  The fact he can convey so much with variety of frowns is a little mind blowing.  Oliva Thriby is an excellent counter point, took me a while to realize that the story isn't so much about Dredd but about her.

The flip side is the story line might be a bit too understated for most causal audiences.  This film has all the hallmarks of a major big budget action flick, but it lacks the over the top in your face story line most come with these days.  Overall I agree with some of the other reviewers that this has a more dystopian District 9 feel, the story is there but its mostly just to promote the character development.  Movies today tend to either spoon feed plots or beat over the head with emotional development.  An action movie with a subtle story line is just not done these days, and frankly will likely leave a lot of people lost or dissatisfied they didn't get more answers.

I will say that I've seen the original and have friends familiar with the comic so I was able to fill some of the back story as I watched, for all its strengths the story may rely too much on people being familiar with the franchise.  Though the rumor was that they had hoped to make this a trilogy (as is the fad these days) so maybe they had planned on fleshing out things in future installments.  Sadly due to its box office performance that is not likely to happen.

Overall I think it has great potential to be one of those cult movies beloved by fans who then spend many afternoons introducing acquaintances to this film they did know about or see for years to come.",1377561600,8,2105,4.293670886075949

4787662,5,B005LAII7G,"There is nothing original, or Judge dredd in this movie. the story line was stolen from both Escape from New York and die hard. I'm curious about who told the actor to use the batman voice and snake plissken attitude. It didn't work, although it was less amusing than the Stallone original voice. The Stallone version was large and enthralling. The latest version is contrived and overly in love with the slow motion violence that little gamer boys love. I'm curious as to why they didn't just hire Sydney the janitor to play Dredd. They could have covered him and had a voice over and gotten as good if not better performance. the actor was never seen, (unlike the little girl who was the focus of the movie)and he was simply used as an accessory, like a purse. Non of the Judge Dred storyline was used and the film had none of the massive reality of the cursed earth and why these people were herded into this city. It was just intended to be a two advertisment for a video game and it failed badly. Weak writing, incredibly weak directing and wasted acting talent. It cost $190 million and made $37 million world wide. It could have been so great with the addition of talent on the writing and directorial end, but then they possibly couldn't have used that cute little blonde girl, which I suspect was the real point of the movie making process.

p.s.
At least they worked on the costuming. The cod piece was left out and the bright 90's colors. Too bad they didn't use the costumes and steal the story from Judge Dredd. That would have been a good movie.",1377475200,,1559,4.470175438596491

It is the second film on blu ray I have seen that was a box office disappointment in the past year that turned out to be a great film. Oblivion is the other and I love that film, too.

Dredd is mostly wall to wall action and violence. It is VERY violent so that was a shock to me. I expected a superhero film with violence such as in The Avengers. Yes, I missed the part where this is rated R. But is it that much more violent than an episode of The Walking Dead? If it is, it's not by much. But just be prepared when you watch this film. It's not for kids.

Urban is fantastic in the lead. We never see his face. We see his jaw and that's it as he works his way through the film and the mega city. He is a driven man and though we learn little about him personally (there are brief hints) it is his actions that speak loud and clear.

4787928,5,B005LAII7G,"Cops vs. bad guys in a giant skyscraper is what this film is about, and it delivers on all counts.  Karl Urban as Dredd is stiff-jawed, sarcastic and menacing, and his willowy rookie partner with psychic abilities is the perfect counterpoint to him.  Nena Headley (of Sarah Connor Chronicles) does a nice turn as Ma-Ma, the bone-chillingly viscous gang leader who locks the building down to capture Dredd and his partner after they investigate an honor killing related to a narcotics deal.

It's the subtle things that really make this film work.  The deadpan dialog, the lack of exposition, the simple set-up.  The place: the street scenes shot in Johannesburg with digital overlays have a realistic depth to them, as do the multiple floors of the megablock Peachtrees, where all the action takes place.  If there was a fake looking effects match-up in the enormous digitally-composited concourse the characters enter through, I couldn't see it.  The building was like a real breathing place, with working poor, minorities, gangs, and unemployed.

I mentioned 'western' for a good reason, much of this film plays out like a man-with-no-name spaghetti western with Clint Eastwood.  The subtexts and character motivations are all very primary, and on the nose, but because of the way it's done, it all works really well.  You don't LIKE Dredd, but you're glad he's doing his job.  You don't LIKE Ma-Ma, but you feel a certain pity for her, as she's as much a villain as a victim of her social status.  The supporting characters all add shades of grey into the moral conflict.

Not much else to say, really. It's very well done, dryly amusing, dark, and contains some of the most strangely beautiful scenes of violence committed to film in recent memory.  If you like a strong-toned action film, this is one to see. If you like Karl Urabn, you HAVE to check this film out.

There's no great acting to be found in here, nor are the action sequences over the top but you have to consider the script when making that call.  It takes place inside what's basically a giant apartment complex.  There's only 1 great action film that takes place in a building that I know of and Bruce Willis is nowhere to be found.  If you complain about the acting, consider the title character is supposed to be stoic and wooden, so I can't fault an actor for not going way out of character.

4788182,5,B005LAII7G,"Dredd, directed by Pete Travis (Vantage Point) and written by Alex Garland (Sunshine, 28 Days Later) tells a story of Judge Dredd, a law-keeper in the Ruin of the Old World. After a mysterious event that left the United States an irradiated wasteland known as the Cursed Earth, Mega-City One, along the East Coast, houses 800 million civilians. Every day, there are over 17,000 crimes a day, and only the men and women of the Hall of Justice stand against the injustice. When he's teamed with a rookie judge (who's also a psychic/mutant) named Anderson, Judge Dredd takes her out on her first mission to Peach Trees, where Ma-Ma, a notorious drug lord is selling and creating vast quantities of Slo-Mo, which makes the brain work at 1% its normal capacity.

Dredd is easily one of the greatest sci-fi/action movies ever made, with visually stunning action sequences and superb directing. Pete Travis really knows how to capture the hellish world from the 2000 AD comic books, and Alex Garland knows how to re-create the characters for the screen, in the best way possible. Stallone's Judge Dredd in the 90s was a truly awful movie in just about every way, but here, Dredd is near-perfect. Karl Urban IS Dredd, with his straight-forward execution of law (literally) and no hesitation to do the right thing, which also includes killing; one of his specialties as a Judge. Olivia Thirlby was actually great as Judge Anderson, a mutant with psychic powers, giving her an advantage over other Judges and perpetrators. Lena Heady, well, is no less intimidating here as Ma-Ma than in Game of Thrones as Cersi Lannister. The visual effects are award-worthy, but with the competition it had, it was reasonably overlooked. The musical score Paul Leonard-Morgan is interesting, being both electronic, hard rock-sounding, and orchestral in places, capturing the brutal and chaotic atmosphere of the Cursed Earth.

Honestly, any and every action aficionado must see this movie, 2000 AD fans, and those who like well-made sci-fi or post-apocalyptic style worlds/stories. Dredd never lets up on the action or intensity, and there is much more to this world, and to Dredd, that needs to be told. A sequel is needed, and Karl Urban is counting on us fans! Of course, this movie is not for every but it is an action masterpiece",1375574400,3,2309,4.933161953727506
4788183,5,B005LAII7G,"Dredd wasn't meant to be a likable comedian, or a lighthearted chum under the armor.

Negative. Dredd gets it done and makes NO apologies, which is thankfully the attitude of the scriptwriters. This was truly a collective triumph for the entire cast; actors, writers and special effects inclusive. ***If you love pulsing, kick ass musical scores, get Paul Leonard-Morgan's soundtrack.***

Karl Urban -- despite the viewer never seeing his face -- gives a perfectly gritty, unremitting performance that the comic book crowd has been clamoring for. I honestly never thought I would feel that way about a performance in which you never see the top-half of a character's face. However, Urban bled seemlessly into the armor and the persona that is Judge Dredd. He was every bit as terrific and flawless as the savage, unforgiving environs of Mega City One.

Lena Headey turns-in what should have been an Oscar-nominated performance for Best Supporting Actress. Unfortunately, the famed ""Academy"" isn't the least bit interested in rewarding actual performances unless the proper lobbying, knee-padding and whining ensues. Headey plays the twisted, hard-as-steel drug kingpin Ma-Ma. When her syndicate is compromised by Dredd arresting her top lieutenant, she seals-off the entire 150-story mega complex and proceed to hunt-down Dredd and his rookie partner.

Simply, the action is heart-pounding, realistic and paced without going over the top or getting repetitive much less boring. The story is far superior to the vast majority of action movies of late. No, the film doesn't have Marky Mark or Vin Diesel or the Rock -- but this is in favor of Dredd, as it doesn't become bogged-down in being a vanity project of a ""Too Faster, Too Furiousestest Part XVI.""

4788188,4,B005LAII7G,"Full disclosure: I came at this film as a die-hard fan of the Stallone vehicle. Maligned as it is, it offered a very faithful interpretation of the Judge Dredd universe, megacities, cursed earth, and all. In fact it is my belief that Stallone's Judge Dredd would be remembered fondly to this day had it not totally screwed up Judge Dredd himself. Stallone's Dredd kisses girls, takes off his hat, and generally behaves nothing like his comic book namesake.

So for many fans, the tension for Dredd was the same. Will Judge Dredd be right? I'm happy to report that yes, Dredd is spot on. Carl Urban scowls, grimaces, does absolutely nothing to be appealing, and doesn't even take off his face-obstructing helmet when he's been shot through with armor-piercing ammunition. In fact the only field judge in the film who DOES show her face is Judge Anderson because hey, it would be a crime to cover up Olivia Thirlby. Speaking of which, good news there! Thirlby's Anderson brings the beloved supporting character (and sometimes miniseries star) to life with spunk and verve, and is a more than competent foil to both Dredd and the lowlifes they must battle.

As much as this film improves on its predecessor's depiction of Dredd, however, its depiction of Megacity 1 veers far further off. This megacity is a much more believable place, an endless smoggy sea of skyscrapers and gridlock that stretches on forever, studded by Megablocks; enormous arcologies packed with far more people than they should hold. It's a minimalist, realistic place that suggests Gotham City or Equilibrium, and frankly I didn't care for it at first blush. But it grew on me; this film had neither the money for a more fanciful Megacity 1, nor the inclination. This is a SERIOUS Dredd film, ripped more from the pages of the later comics than from the camp 70s material that spawned the Stallone picture.

The grit carries over into all respects of the property. Dredd's armor and motorcycle are toned down and believably futuristic; the technology of the world is less ""world of tomorrow"" and more ""next decade,"" and the Peach Trees megablock in which the film takes place is no futuristic spire or industrial nightmare, but a bunkeresque mashup of prison and council-housing. The use of colors and lighting both inside and out to induce loneliness and claustrophobia is more than a little reminiscent of the unlicensed 2000 AD film Hardware, which will please most fans of 2000 AD or British sci fi in general. All of this urban wasteland is underscored by a throbbing, buzzing electronic soundtrack that pitches and falls as the film moves along, but never quite disappears.

The plot is paper thin but totally workable. Dredd and Anderson learn of a drug operation stemming from a particularly lawless megablock and move in to establish law and order. They soon find themselves trapped with the building's blast doors on one side and the cutthroat Ma Ma clan on the other. The gang's eponymous crime lord is played by Lena Headey, who is more or less channeling Cersei Lannister on a lazy weekend for the role, with good success. What ensues is a solid movie's worth of crazy gun battles with horribly graphic results. In its violence this movie closes in more on its source material, capturing the crazy kind of world Dredd inhabits- life is cheap, death only closes a mall for a half hour, and the police are equally likely to ticket you, imprison you for life, or shoot you in the face.

The bottom line is that while this film does not capture the Dredd universe as vividly as the Stallone movie, it still gets the gist and it makes far better use of the characters. Here we finally have Dredd as the force of nature he is meant to be- neither good nor evil, a faceless avatar of his world's authoritarian law, destroying all those who break it purely on principle. We empathize with Dredd and Anderson, not because they are virtuous, but because the enemies they slay in such huge numbers are so much WORSE. Acting as a prequel of sorts to the books, and working with very little money, this movie still succeeds and would be a great basis for sequels. However this is probably not to be as it frankly lost money hand over fist. This is a crying shame as it is a stark, surprising sci-fi action yarn that will at least intrigue any fans of the comic or genre.

The picture on blu ray is quite good, and the audio is deep and clear as a mountain stream. Points are docked for the opening trailers, which must be skipped manually (thanks, Lions' Gate) but there are a wealth of good extras including a pretty solid interview with many of the artists and writers to work on Dredd over the decades.",1375315200,3,4676,4.7032967032967035
4788189,5,B005LAII7G,"Note: This is NOT the Sylvester Stallone film.  Please, for everyone's sake, just pretend that the Stallone film never existed.  Wipe it from your memory and watch this as a completely unrelated film.  Which it is.  Stallone is to Judge Dredd what Adam West is to Christopher Nolan's Batman.  Same character, different worlds.

As everyone knows, Dredd flopped miserably at the box office.  Which is deeply unfortunate, because immediately after watching this, I found myself intensely craving a sequel and mourning that such a well-made, entertaining, highly watchable film (with visual flair to burn) failed to find a broad audience.  I did an online rental of this, and immediately after watching it, I watched it again.  I never do that.  And having watched it twice in a row, I now want to purchase it.

This is not pretty Hollywood action porn.  This is gloss-free, gritty, intense, and unrelenting, reminiscent in both tone and quality of Mad Max and The Road Warrior (which were, not coincidentally, action films made outside the usual Hollywood bubble, at modest budgets).
A dirty, dangerous world punctuated by the occasional burst of high-technology (the ""Lawgiver"" pistol).  Well-executed dystopic vision of the near-future.  Different, but all too believable.

It is a little sad to me that Zach Snyder's uber-noisy, somewhat repetitive and disappointing Man of Steel gets to make money hand over fist, while Dredd languishes (perhaps thanks to guilt by association with the Sylvester Stallone abomination that preceded it).

This is the real deal from writers who knew what they were doing. Think of its 2000AD stablemates such as Slaine, ABC Warriors, Rogue Trooper etc that would also make great movie franchises. You don't have to make a one-size-fits-all pg13-neutered mess of a flick to make money, movies aimed squarely at grownups can and should too.

This is a very good, low-budget sci-fi action movie even if you don't already know the character.

The actors playing the two lead judges did a great job, especially Karl Urban, who had to do all his acting with just the lower half of his face due to a helmet that stayed on for the entire movie. The special effects were great. There are some scenes in slow motion that are kinda beautiful and also relevant to the movie.
I thought it was pretty neat how the main story all takes place inside one giant apartment building/city block. You get an up close view of how the people in this world live.  It was nice to see a female lead who wasn't just a damsel in distress. Olivia Thirlby, playing Judge Anderson, really toughens up as the movie progresses and kicks some serious ass. And Judge Dredd is just a complete badass. He isn't saving the world in this movie, he's just doing his job which on this day happens to entail warring with a drug ring and killing dozens of bad guys.

4788579,5,B005LAII7G,"This is the sequal to the first attempt to put this comic character ( I believe he may be mostly popular in Australia and possibly England though there is also a following in the US) on the silver screen The first was """"Judge Dredd"" starring Sylvester Stallone, a totally dreadful Movie( no pun intended, but the move was a terrible adaption of the Dredd character). This movie removes much of the over the top costuming of the 1st movie, even if at times the silli costuming was more consistent with the comic book, in favor of still pretty odd but more functional gear. You never actually see Dredd's face, which is just one of several subtle political message overtones that I chose to ignor in favor of simply enjoying the ride of this intense non- stop action movie.
As in the comic, it takes place in a post- apocalyptic  world (don't they all?) where most of the viable living space has been destroyed and remaining mankind are forced to live in extremely congested and squalid high rise ghetto-like structures located in massive urban cities crowded with millions of inhabitants. Gangs and criminality are everywhere and the remaining powers that be have resorted to the use of highly specialized forces that act as judge, jury and, if need be, on the spot executioner. The movie takes place with judge Dredd and a female rookie who is a mutant with enhanced ESP powers and on her test run to become a judge.
As any comic transfer, this would sound like a silly premise but in fact the CGI is very good, the movie really proved to be unique in many aspects and the acting pretty good. Not surprisingly, if violence and Sci Fi is not your thing, then this is not for  you. But this has genuine suspense, leaves you rooting for a hero in spite of his human flaws and ended leaving me eager for a sequal.
Believe me when I say this is NOT an Asylum made for tv cheesy SviFi movie. There are no giant bizarro creatures, aliens nor Zombies who win just when you think the movie is over and the day was saved. All the characters are human and the plot easily connects to current events. However it is no "" Citizen Zane' so don't expect award nominations.
So, why the 5 stars? Simply because both my wife and I just plain enjoyed it. We never felt we were watching something geared for adolescents, we could enjoy and have a good time without delving into any deeper political messages, though one is free to do so if they please, and we found the gadgets, story-line and special effects and costuming all engaging. We liked it enough to purchase the 3D version. Absolutely, you do NOT need the 3D version to enjoy this flick, but I want to say the 3d translation, while not quite as good as it could have been (true of so many 3D movies) still capable of adding a huge and enjoyable dimension. We became aware of events that completely passed by our awareness in the 2D version.
Finally, I understand some of the lower ratings. Movies are a very personal thing, just like wine, food and the opposite sex. I am simply writing as a fan of SciFi who is weary of all the zombie, giant creatures and vampire/ werewolfs, and horribl CGI that pass for entertainment lately.

The rookie role (Anderson) could have been dreadful but this was certainly not the case. Lena Headley's Ma-Ma is a be-hatch of the highest variety. Which... really is the entire point.

4788733,5,B005LAII7G,"I have been a fan of Karl Urban for a while now. I did not expect Dredd to be one of those movies I would like; much less one I would write a review about. I watched John Carter before I watched Dredd, and while it was barely just an ok movie, I enjoyed the ending of John Carter more than I did the entire movie which I found to be bizzare and unusual. Dredd on the other hand is a different case entirely.

In 2012, we had 3 really BIG comic book movies to come out during the summer. The highly anticipated team up of Marvel's The Avengers, The epic conclusion to Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight series, and The surprisingly exceptionally well put together reboot of spider man entitled: The Amazing Spider Man. So naturally, I did not initially hear or know a thing about Dredd being made into a movie.

Dredd stars Karl Urban as the title character himself. Supporting cast consists of Olivia Thirlby as Judge Anderson (expect a surprise with her character), Lena Headey as the main antagonist, Ma-Ma (funny name I know) and Wood Harris as Kay. The Cast both main and supporting did a terrific job, and more notably, Karl Urban really surprised me playing the lead character in the movie.

The story line is good and easy to follow. There is a lot of action (fast paced and slow motion); and too, the effects work really well for the movie.

To compare Dredd to other movies: its like Daredevil, Crank with Jason Statham, and Wanted all in one movie. Dredd is not a mercenary but he is fearless and committed. Dredd does not disregard the law, but he executes it by any means necessary.

I will again admit that I did not expect to like Dredd as much as I did. I was shocked to see that it got such rave reviews and yet there is not a confirmed sequel. But nonetheless, as a comic book adaptation, and more importantly as a movie, Dredd does succeed.

Lets just hope that soon, in the not too far off future, that this great movie gets the sequel it deserves.

This movie has absolutely no chick appeal-- the hero shows no trace of emotion and doesn't even remove his helmet for the entire movie!  He's the futuristic version of the Man With No Name from all those spaghetti westerns.  The violence is graphic and gratuitous and the villain is this heinous looking, brutal ex prostitute.  She is not sexy, and there is no nudity.  That's my favorite kind of guy movie, though!  Mindless violence, but without booze and bimbos.  This is the opposite of James Bond movies.  Judge Dredd does not try to be cool and suave and bang the pretty girl.  His only motivation is killing and surviving to face another day so that he could, as Hemmingway might write, die in the rain.

4788739,3,B005LAII7G,"I came into this film from the perspective of a long time Judge Dredd fan dating back to 1983 with his run in Eagle comics.. When I saw the 1995 film I didn't walk out of it hating it but I saw huge room for improvement. In particular I was disturbed by the removal of his helmet and the addition of his wacky sidekick played by Rob Schneider. Dredd 3D corrects a lot of the problems of the previous film but then introduces all new ones.

My concern started with the opening pan shot of Mega City One. This was not Mega City. Mega City is a massive densely populated supercity that spans the entire east coast with enormous mile high buildings. What I saw here was a rather ordinary looking city with the occasional CGI superskyscraper doting the landscape. Dredd 3D had a modest $45 million budget, half the cost of the 1995 film, but $45 million isn't chump change. The action scene that starts the film is small and forgettable and banks on the vicious way that Dredd kills the criminal to sell itself.

If I were to describe the Judge Dredd comic in just one word it would be satirical. If I were to describe Dredd 3D in just one word it would be gritty. My second choice would be violent. Despite its many flaws the 1995 film was correct to never take itself too serious. Judge Dredd is big, bold and over the top. Dredd 3D feels small and grim. There is a fan made video on YouTube called Judge Minty that actually does a better job of recreating Judge Dredd on what I assume is a miniscule budget. That is not to say Judge Minty is better. It suffers from the same problem as most fan made movies which is a forgettable plot and amateurish acting but the uniforms and Dredd's Lawmaster look much better.

The producers of Dredd 3D made the correct albeit obvious decision to keep his helmet on the whole movie but then ended up radically changing the rest of the uniform. It's hugely toned down to give it a more realistic look but again I think the producers miss the point of Judge Dredd. The comic book costume is ridiculous but that was the intent. The oversized shoulder pads, knee pads and elbow pads are a reflection of the over the top nature of the comics. The point of the comic wasn't to make Judge Dredd the world's biggest bad ass. It's about social commentary and irony. There is the irony of this machine like judge dressed in an incredibly outlandish, non utilitarian uniform. Dredd 3D nails the look of the helmet but besides that the 1995 film does a much better job. Well, except for the bizarre metal codpiece.

Judge Dredd holds an 18% on Rottentomatoes while Dredd 3D has an enviable 78%. I would put both the films closer to the midway point between the two. If you want a relatively fun, violent action film with a character whose name happens to be the same as a comic character you can certainly do worse than Dredd 3D but if you want the comic Judge Dredd and his world brought to life you'll have to keep waiting. If this were a very good film but not a great interpretation of Judge Dredd I could appreciate it for what it is but there is just so little for me to latch on to. The music is unremarkable and dated. The sets feel like they're from a movie with an even smaller budget than this one and besides a few interesting moments the film just didn't make a lasting impression on me. I did appreciate the casting of Karl Urban and Olivia Thirlby who were both excellent. The one weak cast member was Wood Harris whose acting resembled his name.

I have to wonder if the very generous reviews are a reaction to the fact that this movie is so aggressively not Judge Dredd 1995. However to me it feels like they threw the baby out with the bathwater. Honestly, the 1995 film did not get everything wrong. A film that's much closer to Judge Dredd in tone would be the original Robocop would featured tons of social commentary and kept a balance between the violence and levity. Despite the favorable reviews Dredd 3D was a fairly sizable bomb at the box office and I noticed that user audience reactions were slightly lower than professional reviews which is rare for an action adventures movie. If you love the film, that's cool. Support it, buy the blu-ray and if enough are bought maybe a sequel will actually be made but if you're not a reader of the comic know that this isn't just a slight alteration of the source material. Dredd 3D is a complete departure in terms of tone and unlike a character like Batman there haven't been tons of tonal shifts in Dredd throughout the years so as far as I know this is a unique interpretation and in my opinion not an improvement.",1373587200,,4612,4.4021101992966

a true shame that it didn't do better in theaters.

but the cinematographers dropped the ball in that the light coming into one of the cameras was polarized (or polarized differently) than the light going into the other camera.

what this means is that virtually all shiny surfaces in the movie (and there are a LOT of shiny surfaces in this movie whether it is metal or even the sheen off leather) will ""buzz""... that is, the specular hilight is brighter in one eye vs. how bright it is in the other and this will make the image seem to ""buzz"" from the mismatch.  it's, at best, distracting... at worse, it makes one of your eyes feel like it has a film over it.

and stereo in general for the movie isn't very accomplished... i expected better from a movie that was shot in stereo.  oh well.

This is a competent sci-fi movie as well as a great comic book-based story. Even the smallest details in the story are actually very cool science fiction elements. This is like Blade Runner on steroids. The violence is graphic and this is not a family friendly movie.

4788878,5,B005LAII7G,"Unless you find super slow mo gorgeous blood-water-and-light cascades sexy. Karl Urban (who is not the same person as Keith Urban, it turns out) is a damn handsome man, as anyone who's seen Lord of the Rings can attest. You never see his face in this movie. Olivia Thirlby's cute, but she's covered in body armor. Lena Headey, of Game of Thrones fame, is, um, let's just say they have de-prettified her and leave it for now.

The movie is what it is: It's a relatively short (just over 90 minutes in an era where blockbuster films often top 2 hours) suspense/action movie that does not probe too deeply into the inner life of its characters, explore lofty themes, or get bogged down in super intricate plot twists.

That said, it's really good! The visuals are beautiful. The plot is tight. You give a damn about (some of) the characters. There ARE hints about them having some depth, but the movie is kept tight, so there aren't rambling subplots dealing with those depths. And you find yourself really hoping the good guys win and the bad guys get it.

It's 94 minutes and might run you what? 4 bucks? Rent this on Amazon the next time you manage to get the kids to bed on time. Microwave some popcorn. Invite your friends.",1373328000,4,1225,4.509009009009009

4788992,5,B005LAII7G,"This is my first review on Amazon but I just felt that I need to chime in on this movie.

I watched the movie after it's theatrical run; couldn't find a 2D showing in my area and my girlfriend doesn't do 3D - hurts her eyes. Whoever made the decision to limit the 2D release... well, that was incredibly stupid. While the 3D effects are touted as amazing, this movie does NOT need them to be successful or enjoyable.

My girlfriend and I watched this movie on a whim, without really knowing anything about it (critical reviews are borderline useless to me any more now that Roger Ebert has passed on). We were blown away. This movie doesn't waste time on traditional formulas and focuses on being among the best of what it is: An amazing action film that lovers of the golden age of action movies (the 80s and early 90s) will shed a tear of joy to.

It doesn't waste time on back story, love interests, or extraneous color. It plows through its story without any fat and provides the most enjoyable action experience I've had in 15 years. The feel is like a modern Robocop or Terminator 1/2 but unlike those movies, there is literally no drag in Dredd. The characters play out through their actions and the run time is perfect to tell the story.

The story is minimal, to be sure, but that is what makes it work. We're not saving the world, changing mankind, or creating a watershed moment in the legacy of the people involved. We're storming a building that's on lock down with a brilliantly understated lead character and nearly perfectly balanced supporting cast.

The action sequences are obviously well done and look amazing. Add to that a perfectly paced film and a character who easily goes in my top three film badasses of all time and we've got a film worth watching multiple times. Also, did I mention that my girlfriend absolutely loved it? Got the Blu-ray coming later this week and I plan to watch the damn out of it. You should, too.

tl;dr - Buy it. Watch it. Support it. Let's get a sequel and set a box office record. You won't be disappointed.",1373155200,5,2061,4.482666666666667
4788993,4,B005LAII7G,I have said to myself to avoid gratuitous violence in movies because it can weaken the story and take away from your viewing experience BUT I liked this movie despite its emphasis on showing you the violence in slow moving graphic detail please spare any young children -this is for adults. I like the judge concept of being judge and jury it definitely saves time. Karl Urban did a good job. I was saddened by the persuasive poverty shown and the numerous violent acts committed every day because people are trying to survive- can this be mankind's future? See this for yourself and make your own decision but I want a sequel very soon!,1373155200,5,637,4.5964912280701755

4788998,5,B005LAII7G,"As someone who has written comic books for many years I have to start off by saying that I am a great fan of 2000 AD and the original Judge Dredd comics.  As such, I dutifully saw the Stallone film adaptation and just as dutifully disliked it.  It wasn't a bad film--just not a Judge Dredd film.
This time, however, I got to see a real, honest-to-God, film about Mega-City one and the Judges who patrol it.  DREDD, played by Karl Urban, is perfect--more so because, unlike most movie stars, Urban does the entire film with the helmet on!
 Olivia Thirlby makes a quite interesting Judge Anderson, gifted with psychic powers she can still kick ass right alongside Dredd.
The film is well shot with wonderful use of 3-D and memorable secondary characters.  I know it suffered in theaters from being connected with the Stallone fiasco but be assured, this is the real deal!",1373068800,4,869,4.616883116883117
4789059,4,B005LAII7G,"If you can stomach yet another dystopic, post-apocalyptic sci-fi film, DREDD improves on its onscreen predecessor, the one that had Stallone uttering one of his most quotable lines ever. Stallone's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Judge-Dredd/dp/1558908846/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Judge Dredd</a>&nbsp;is fun in a cheesy sort of way. My main nitpick with it is that Stallone pretty much discards the Judge's helmet, something which you historically never ever see Dredd without. Judge Dredd in his core represents a police state. In the comics we never quite get to know him on a personal level, never really see him off duty. All he ever does is enforce the law impersonally. He always has that helmet on. When Stallone strayed from this, he lost me.

In this bleak future, America is an irradiated wasteland, our planet become a Cursed Earth. Set in the eastern seaboard, Mega-City One stretches from Boston to Washington, DC, home to ""800 million people living in the ruin of the old world and the megastructures of the new one."" In the face of increasing overpopulation and rampant crime, as society decays, the Judges - these men and women of the Hall of Justice - must be unflinching in carrying out their duties. They act as judge, jury, and executioner. Judge Dredd is heard to spout an alarming stat: ""12 serious crimes are reported every minute, a sum of 17,000 per day."" Dredd goes on to say that the Judges can only respond to 6% of these calls.

It chronicles a day in the life of Judge Dredd. It finds him saddled with a rookie partner, Cassandra Anderson (Olivia Thirlby). Anderson's test scores were marginal at best, and she wouldn't even have gotten this far in the training except that she's that rare powerful psychic. Dredd is tasked with evaluating her under field conditions. As such, Dredd and Anderson are dispatched to the residential mega-block of Peach Trees to investigate a brutal triple homicide in which the victims were also deskinned.

Odds are these following fun facts aren't in Peach Trees' tourist brochures: The mega-block houses 75,000 registered citizens; It flaunts the highest crime rate in Sector 13; it boasts an unemployment rate of 96%; it's widely regarded as the most dangerous district in Mega-City One.

Peach Trees comprises 200 floors, is run with vindictive efficiency by Madeline Madrigal or ""Ma-Ma"" (Lena Headey), a crime boss bent on expanding her territory thru sales of Slo-Mo, a dangerous reality-altering drug. Slo-Mo presents us with the film's most striking special effects as enough moments unfold as seen from the addicts' drastically slowed down perspective. The Slo-Mo cam elevates John Woo's slick bullet ballet to even more exaggerated extremes.

Somewhere along the way, DREDD takes on that&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Die-Hard/dp/B000O77SRC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Die Hard</a>&nbsp;premise, that&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Raid-Redemption-Unrated/dp/B008ULRY78/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Raid: Redemption Unrated</a>&nbsp;premise. A chain of events eventually compels Ma-Ma to implement full lockdown protocol on the Peach Trees complex, trapping Dredd and Anderson inside with their prime suspect. Ma-Ma then gets on the speakers and commands her tenants to hunt down the Judges. The only thing she doesn't do is play ""The Rains of Castamere"" on the air.

Quoting JUDGE DREDD artist/co-creator Carlos Ezquerra as he comments on how society has shifted to a darker, more cynical outlook: ""In those times (**the late 1970s when Judge Dredd debuted**) he looked like a very futuristic figure. But today, 35 years later, any policeman looks like him now."" Back in the day Judge Dredd was THE semi-fascist boogeyman. Today, he's just another guy. Even the X-Men's Cyclops has got him beat in authoritarian excess.

Karl Urban does what Stallone couldn't, which is make Dredd a serious, credible character. And he achieves that without ever relinquishing his Helmet of Intimidation. Another quote from Ezquerra: ""Justice has not a face."" So credit Karl Urban for maintaining Dredd as an impersonal instrument of the law, someone so insanely dedicated he works only in absolutes, not so much in the grey areas. Urban must've been tempted to veer away from the Dredd aesthetics, maybe introduce an endearing emotional tic or two. Good on him that he refrains. I never ever want to see Judge Dredd crack a smile.

I liked Stallone's version up to a point, but I love this reboot, love the post-apocalyptic vibe of it. It's violent, sometimes graphically so. The acting doesn't succumb to cheese. Lena Headey is wonderfully detached as the damaged goods turned big bad. I even like the chemistry between Dredd and Anderson. And just when you least expect it, we even get a moment in the end in which Dredd demonstrates that he can, on rare occasions, break the rules.

But, hey, Judge Dredd, Magneto called. He wants his helmet back.

Be ready with buckets to catch the blood coming out of the screen in this action packed blood-fest.  There are a couple of very creative scenes that I would never have expected to be filmed if I hadn't seen them here. Honest, you'll be amazed at a couple of them!  The choice of a drug that causes the users to live in ""slow motion"" is a particularly good plot device for a 3D movie, btw.

4789063,3,B005LAII7G,"For a super hero movie, it fell behind a lot on super hero elements, Spiderman shoot web, Batman do things in dark, Superman has super strength, so there are a bunch of examples down the road.

Dredd, besides holding his equipments from his unit, he's just an old fashion cop practicing law, and that's all about it. There is nothing 'super' about him, one might say 'hey, Batman doesn't has super power either', but to me his nearly unbelievable fortune that back him doing what he's doing is the 'super power', by the definition that super power meaning a power source that is unreal, and in his case, his financial and technological support is unreal.

This Dredd, however, too 'real' as a super hero, besides he's living in a near future environment, he's just a cop. I repeatedly point out that because aside the futurisctic setup in this movie, the plot and everything else is just so standard production to the best. I can't even count how many times I've seen an action movie with the main bad 'guy' is a drug lord of some kind.

The movie is still interested to the end, I don't deny that, but it falls to those movie title that you would rewatch after a certain while. Clearly a few months past there is nothing in this movie that I would recall like the other super hero would.

4789181,5,B005LAII7G,"I am a little biased, I'm a fan of Karl Urban and to a lesser extent Lena Headey.

Leaving the embarassing Rob Schneider comedy sidekick routine where it belongs (in the 1990s Judge Dredd) Dredd takes a very serious approach to law enforcement.

The opening chase sets the scene, with Dredd as Judge, Jury and Executioner. Life can be harsh in the post apocalyptic Mega City One.

Although she failed the test, Cassandra's powerful psychic powers are of interest to the Hall of Justice and Dredd gets to take the rookie out on assessment. Events conspire to trap them in the 200 story Peach Tree tower. Drug Lord Ma-Ma (Lena Headey at her most vicious) wants the Judges dead and uses psychological warfare, blackmail, bribery and brute force.

Dredd looks great and sounds great. It almost demands to be seen in 3D with a good or better sound/surround system (there is a 7.1 audio track compatible with Neo X). I've only watched the blu ray in 3D and it looks stunning; the scenes of the time perception altering 'Slo-Mo' drug are used sparingly. I've also watched it on DVD; a friend that did NOT want to see this saw the opening scenes and sat down to watch the entire movie.

Other than that, the stories are completely different.  If you're looking for a simpler story line and pure shoot 'em or blow 'em up action this is the movie for you.  If you're looking for a little more complicated story along with some humor then watch Judge Dredd.  I love Sylvester Stallone, anyway.

4789417,5,B005LAII7G,"Judge dredd has been around for 36 years ! now. And the first movie with sly stalone was ok, at best. But this one really just nails the character. Judge Dredd has no real backstory and never takes off his hood and that is maintained here. People who have not read the comics will probably think this is just  a action flick. And in that department it makes use of the 3d aspect in the most violent and expert way possible. Many 3d flicks just have the 3d for depth. Which is fine. But this is the type of 3d flick with many specific shots of things flying out at you. So it's a great showcase for 3d viewing in that vein. This is not about making a great character based movie though. It's about doing a Judge Dredd story and many are like thia one in the comics. But then again many are far more fantastic and I would love to see a more mutant orientated one etc. Where he goes into the mutated badlands and fights monsters etc. But this is a straight forward JD tale. In some levels it's like 'shoot em up' or Crank' in that it's a pure action flick. But they don't have a long history like this movie does. I like all kinds of action flicks , or drama flicks with a little action. It's a big field. this is a great pure action type of flick. If you don't like that type of flick then don't get this. Another great thing is that there is no ghosting in the 3d here. Many 3d films I have on blu ray have double images because they did a half butt job of mastering it to blu ray.  Not this one. ONe of the worst is 'shock labrynth"" and sadly 'dial m for murder' which deserved a better mastering job. This is on the other end of the scale . NO 3d breakup at all.  IF you don't like mindless action flicks you may not like this one though.  I love em and deep storied ones with little action too. So it's all good for me.  This just looks stunning though , for that reason you should grab it alone.",1371772800,3,1898,4.050666666666666

4789420,5,B005LAII7G,"Ok, first of all stepping into this I have never been a huge Judge Dredd fan. When I saw the old campy 1995 version I got a good laugh and went about my business, never thinking to much of it. So when I saw that they were making another Dredd I thought it would just line up with the rest of the action packed but plot absent movies that are being rolled off the conveyor belt nowadays. So when it was available for rent at the only remaining video store in town I took it home expecting to be disappointed. I was very wrong.

It has been a long time since a movie has really grabbed a hold of my collar and drug me through the plot and story but this one did it with such precision I had to make sure I wasn't making it up. This movie holds so true to the ideals of the comic series that it feels like you are reading a series of them in order. The movie is dark, and gritty and very bloody but in all that violence you begin to feel and understand the huge task it is to patrol and respond to the crime of Mega-City One.

And it isn't just the well done violence and effects that leave you on the edge of your seat. The character development and chemistry between Dredd and Cassandra Anderson is in my humble opinion, some of the best I have witnessed in a film.

I highly recommend it to anyone interested in this kind of film, however if excessive blood isn't your thing I suggest you rent it first before buying.",1371772800,5,1417,4.089928057553957

This is the type of movie that you want the action to be heart pounding and fast. That said, I don't think the length and storyline could've support that pace. So the pace follows the length of the story.

I watched it in 3D at home, which is great. There are some scences that show great depth and distance. There isn't too much pop-out effects, but I'm not into that personally (maybe once per movie is fine).

4789667,1,B005LAII7G,"I regrettably picked up this movie on RedBox because I thought it'd be an entertaining, enjoyable action flick - and, better yet, with Karl Urban. While I like Karl Urban, I enjoyed the first Judge Dredd (the only!) as a very entertaining, good action flick with some emotion between Sylvester Stallone and Armand Assante. So, I knew it wouldn't be as good or better, but figured there's no way it could be horrible.

Big mistake.

Certainly the most ridiculous part of this movie is that not once does Karl Urban never - NEVER - removes his helmet throughout the entire movie. So all you ever see is his lower face (lips/mouth, chin). That is ALL. His dialogue is perpetually monotonous and dreary, that dreadful but well-mimicked (from Sly) frown never changes, and the presence of the female costar is painfully 'acted' that it just adds to the lameness of the flick's scenario, which is no different than the mundane aspects of a cheap shooter video game.

The gore and violence is over the top but not too surprising, afterall, looks why it's rated R. People who have been bashing the movie for its excessive gore and violence and thus giving it a 1 star need to elaborate on the other horrible aspects of the movie, otherwise most people who know what they're getting (action-wise) in the movie will simply disregard your review entirely.

Despite some decent action scenes, the gratuitous and fastforward-worthy slow motion scenes remind me of Max Payne (but worse) and the fact that the emotionless STARRING ROLE never removes his helmet for even the slightest bit of authenticity the entire movie hinders me from giving this movie 2 stars. It truly deserves no more than that.",1370822400,6,1685,4.820069204152249

4789675,4,B005LAII7G,"For those of you who haven't seen Dredd yet, if you're expecting the typical flashy PG-13 comic book movie, a remake of Stallone's Judge Dredd or a carbon copy of the 2000AD/Megazine Judge Dredd, you might be disappointed.

This Dredd is a combination of a dark, depressing, gritty, British indie film mixed with a 70s/80s, over-the-top, R-rated action film.

There's some subtle, dark humor neatly woven into Dredd. Unfortunately I've noticed that some viewers miss this. Maybe their attention is focused on the depressing, violent surroundings/situations and the humor falls flat or passes them by.

I've seen ""excessive violence"" mentioned a lot and Dredd certainly deserves it's R rating (I wouldn't let kids watch) but to me it didn't feel much worse than many other movies. Maybe I just happen to watch a lot of violent movies but I think it has more to do with genre expectations. We normally associate over-the-top violence with horror or certain thrillers so it could come across a bit more shocking seeing this kind of violence in the comic book, sci-fi genre.

It's also important to note that there is a subtle social/political message sprinkled throughout the movie and that the filmmakers use of ""excessive violence"" is part of this (fascism, crumbling society, violence).

In my opinion, Dredd works best in 3D but is still good in 2D... although it works far better in the theater than on blu-ray.  This may have to do with the style of 3D. Instead of the jump-out-at-you 3D of many movies, Dredd's 3D is more about depth. I think this style translates better on a large movie screen than on your average TV.

Last, I never understand why people worry about comparing movies or who stole what. If it's a good movie, enjoy it but I'm going to touch on a few things that reviewers are confused about.

Claim: Dredd is a Hollywood copy of Raid Redemption - If you fact-check dates, you'll see that Dredd was written first and Dredd finished main filming before Raid even began filming. Also Dredd is a DNA film, an independent British film production company, not Hollywood.

Claim: Dredd is a Robocop clone - I would not be surprised if Verhoeven's style influenced Dredd but Robocop was actually modeled after the Judge Dredd in the comic book.

Claim: Urban is imitating Stallone's Dredd - Karl Urban and Stallone both based their character after the Judge Dredd in the comic book.  In fact, intentionally or unintentionally Urban's Dredd gives off a Clint Eastwood, Dirty Harry vibe which is fitting since the comic book Judge Dredd was influenced by Dirty Harry.",1370476800,5,2580,4.881006864988558
4789775,5,B005LAII7G,"Even though I read many comics in my youth, I had only limited opportunity to check out the Dredd series. I very much enjoyed the few that I could find. The stories were interesting and clever, and I thought it was cool that you never saw Dredd's face. Anyway, like I said in my title, they did everything right with this film. Very gritty action, Karl Urban's Dredd is GREAT, Olivia Thirlby is also terrific as the rookie Anderson and Lena Headey is truly scary as the brutal Ma-Ma. The look of the film is rough but highly detailed and surprisingly colorful. There is some extreme violence in slo-mo and some quick flashes of sexual violence, so this is definitely an R-rated movie. There are some good special features that fill you in a little bit as far as what the Dredd character and society is all about. I understand the film didn't do especially well at the box office which is too bad. It was very well done and Dredd's stories should definitely be continued in (many) sequels.",1370476800,2,988,4.5251396648044695

Can't beat Arnold Hollywood, same will go with The Crow remake and Robocop remake and most other remakes, forgettable and a waste of time making them in the first place!

Btw Dredd ain't a remake, its actually the proper Dredd from the comic book, not um Stallone's one... gotta admit though first 10 minutes of Stallone's movie I was in awe, then when he took the helmet off it was all down hill from then, still good movie at the time, but now the Real Dredd with helmet on all through ;)

Wont spoil it, buy it, support it, heck if enough buy we might get that sequel from DVD/Blu-Ray sales.

I found myself getting grossed out by the brutal killings in the movie and also got a real kick out of the semi-realistic yet still sci-fi world.

I really enjoyed Karl Urban as Dredd and finally, for once. There was a strong female protagonist by the name of Anderson! She wasn't a damsel in distress, she got herself out of a nasty situation and knew when to slap a guy down who was getting too cocky. The team up between these two was really fun to watch and I would absolutely LOVE to see a sequel of this movie.

Now, a lot of people compare this movie to The Raid and say that Raid is superior. Well, i saw both movies and I feel that people are comparing apples to oranges. Sure the basic premise is the same and there's not much story, but a lot of Dredd's focus was on Anderson coming out of the rookie role. The Raid wasn't about rookies, but about a cop trying to find his brother and a bunch of political back dealings that lead up to the assault.

Karl Urban is a fantastic Dredd, and as befits the character, never takes off the mask. Lena Headey is soft-spoken and off-putting in a wonderful way, and Olivia Thirlby makes the most of her several opportunities to shine.

4789880,4,B005LAII7G,"There really is no reason for me to write this review as 1,100 have already chimed in. I'm doing so because of how surprised I was in seeing that, what I thought was going to be a mediocre, pedestrian outing, was actually very good.

Here's the scoop. Judge Dredd (Karl Urban) is hitting the street with a rookie trainee (Olivia Thirlby) who didn't test well but is a mutant psychic which could giver her an advantage. Answering a call involving three dead lowlifes in a huge, vertical slum, they figure to dig deeper only to find it was a ""message"" execution. The attempt to find the perps leads them to a gang which is manufacturing and distributing a new drug called SLO-MO. The gang is headed up by a violent, scarred woman named Ma Ma (Lena Headey) and she isn't going down easy.

The story and script are good (or at least good enough). What is really happening here excels on the production level. For my dollar, the director, Peter Travers has really stepped it up. The color palette is outstanding with many colors being over-saturated in greens and yellows giving everything a very diseased pallor. The sound design is also very good. The music score blends in with other sounds to raise the sense of doom and helplessness. The gore effects are outstanding. Seeing someone's head explode the way it's done here is one of a kind. The action scenes, in general, were filmed well. Travers knows how to set up and frame a shot. The editing, likewise, was essentially seamless. The set of the Slum was great. Part of what a film like this requires is the look, and they got it here in spades. The acting was good enough though I found it odd that Urban plays the entire movie without removing his helmet. Lena Headey is outstanding as Ma Ma. Her scarred face helps drive home her sense of resolve.

This is not unlike the movie ""The Raid"" in its basic outline. This merely has a greater budget driving it toward a higher level. If you like sci-fi action, this is about as good as it gets.",1369785600,,1993,4.515235457063712

4790031,2,B005LAII7G,"I had several friends who said they loved this movie. They said it had action. Style. Gadgetry. Yep. As much as a six year old with crayons.

This movie is honestly abysmal. While I will admit if you are the type of person who is impressed with flashy colors, testosterone plots, cyberpunk futures, and gimmicks, it's perfection.

Don't get me wrong, I like Karl Urban. I enjoyed the cheese he played in Doom. He was a fantastic Bones. And, believe it or not, he's a great Dredd. He is not what is wrong with this movie.

The standard movie features ridiculous slo-mo scenes lasting 3 times longer than they need to be, round about plot using psychics, the terrible execution of the ""at noon"" style movie making, this movie is just poorly shot. In fact, this movie feels like an exceptionally long modern made 90's music video. As for the 3D, it's not well implemented but does offer that type of 3D that feels like cards set at different distances. I've found some people enjoy this. I do not.

I won't go on about this movie. I didn't like it. It isn't the worst movie I've ever seen but I would absolutely not recommend it to persons with my taste in movies. Like I said, it's possible you could enjoy it. Just know that if you think while you watch movies you're not likely to enjoy it. If you just sit back and take a ride when a movie plays, well there ARE worse movies... I just cannot immediately think of them.

My friends who recommended this? Well let's just say this movie pops up in dialog more often than it deserves when they say ""you should watch BLANK."" ""Remember Dredd? I do.

If I had to describe it I would say it's a bit of a Noland-like (a kind of realistic spin, like it ""could"" happen) take on the Judge Dredd comics. Instead of giant eagles on the shoulders, it's more like SWAT body armor. The visuals are stunning and hypnotic. It is a violent film but Dredd is a violent comic. It's a fun ride that is worth buying and watching again from time to time....

When this film was in theaters they had a TERRIBLE marketing team. They should all be given 5 years in iso-cubes. Seriously, the failure of the team that marketed Dredd is epic.

- There are some interesting twists that caught me by surprise. For example, the shooting scene at the end.

- I did not read the comic books that this movie was supposed to be loosely based on. Besides, I do not care if it's a faithful adaptation. I just want an enjoyable film.

The film showcased its action in a way that left me feeling at times uncomfortable. I liked that the script left room for this discomfort in scenes that show the fallout of violence and its patterns.

4790242,5,B005LAII7G,"I think the subject says it all. If you are into the older just straight up action movies (Commando, Predator, etc.) then this is a movie you'll enjoy. There isn't any overly deep character development. And fortunately it is missing a lot of those really tired current action film trends (Super shaky camera shots, terrible jokes, bad acting). It really is just a fun action movie. Dredd, although I have never really learned anything about the character outside of the first movie and this one, is an interesting character. The story and the environment is really cool if you like the whole run down future kind of thing. It's more believable than the Stallone one, a more gritty nasty future with people living in these overcrowded apartment complex's which is where most of the movie takes place.

What this movie suffered from is abysmal marketing. The company that was hired to market this should be really disappointed in their treatment of this film. They overhyped the 3D, and under advertised the great action and interesting setting.

This movie, sadly, will probably not get a sequel as the it did not make a great amount of money. But do this film justice, buy the Blu-Ray and enjoy some great action, and great special effects.",1368057600,8,1240,4.816901408450704

4790368,3,B005LAII7G,"Transferring a comic book character to the big screen can pretty tricky business if the right people aren't at the helm.  If the script doesn't get the tone of the character right, it doesn't matter who the director or actors are in the film, because it's doomed to fail.  For example, Green Lantern (2011) was always doomed to fail.  It didn't matter if Ryan Reynolds sucked as Hal Jordan or not (and he did) because the script didn't do the character justice.  In 2012, Judge Dredd returned to the big screen in Dredd, which was recently released on DVD/Blu-ray, and it's perfectly evident that screenwriter Alex Garland didn't do this comic book character any favors, either.

Before we get to the review of Dredd, let's do a quick review and background check on this character, known as Judge Dredd.  For those that don't remember or didn't bother to watch Sylvester Stallone's portrayal of Judge Dredd in Judge Dredd (1995), this character is a masked (helmet) street judge in Mega-City One, a variation of a New York City-like urban area after it has been devastated by a Soviet nuclear attack.  Judge Joseph Dredd is a famous/notorious street cop (known as a judge) that patrols the streets and serves as judge, jury, and executioner after apprehending a criminal.  He carries a multi-function gun, known as a ""lawgiver,"" and patrols the city on a motorcycle, called a ""lawmaster.""  He is a ruthlessly affective officer, unbending with his judgments, and incorruptible.

In Dredd (2012), Judge Dredd (Karl Urban) is given the task of evaluating a rookie judge in training, Cassandra Anderson (Olivia Thirlby).  Anderson, a powerful ""mutant"" psychic, must pass a final test and assist Dredd in the investigation of a new drug, ""Slo-Mo,"" which severely hampers a user's concept of time.  Responding to a building after a drug-related murder, they apprehend a drug thug for questioning.  Dredd and Anderson identify Ma-Ma (Lena Headey), a drug lord, as the one responsible for the spread of ""Slo-Mo.""  And, while attempting to bring the drug thug suspect in for questioning, Ma-Ma traps Dredd and Anderson in the building, ordering their deaths.  Cue the action scenes.

Unlike the 1995 rendition of Judge Dredd, this new version of Dredd doesn't delve into the past of the Dredd character, or even the Dredd universe.  This 2012 rendition feels more like a sequel than it does the first film in a reboot series.  That's not to say Dredd is a horrible film, but you have to question the thought process of making this film prior to bringing it to the big screen.  Aside from a short monologue at the beginning of the film or unless viewers have read the comics and/or saw the Stallone film version, viewers will be scratching their heads asking themselves if they missed something.  Had the creators made an origin story explaining the characters, explaining the destruction of the city, and the unique politics of this wasteland government, then Dredd would have served its purpose as a very healthy sequel.  Instead, this film creates more disappointment than excitement.

For the moment, let's put those questions aside and move on to the film as it currently stands.  Karl Urban brings the cold, calculating Dredd to life in ways that Stallone never did.  Urban is far less comical than Stallone, while Urban's portrayal is far more bold and serious, which is more like the comic book character and less like what viewers were treated to in 1995.  Since Dredd's face is never seen on screen (only true to the comic book), you may never know it's Karl Urban under the helmet - unless you're able to identify people by their chin.  As far as the supporting cast goes, Olivia Thirlby and Lena Headey leave a great deal to be desired.  Going back to the earlier point - there's very little actors/actresses can do with a weakly written script.  This is obviously not a dialogue heavy film, as it focuses much more on the action aspect with constant gunfire and relentless explosions.

Overall, Judge Dredd is little-know character that was given a misguided return to the big screen.  There's plenty of action to go around in this film, so that's a plus for action junkies.  However, other than that, this film contains unmemorable acting, a clumsy plot, and to make matters even worse - since the film was shot in 3D, there's an abundance of overused, slow-motion drug scenes that are extremely tedious and unnecessary.

Overall Film Grade:  C+

It's obvious they want sequels and they will probably churn them out.  I, however, won't be wasting my money or time watching them.
I admit, I don't know a thing about the British comic book this movie was based on (apparently, its 35 years of satire aimed squarely at America.  None of it is meant to be flattering.)  So, I had to judge this movie purely on what it delivered, which was a mindless set of incredible action sequences.  Unfortunately, action in and of itself is not particularly interesting unless it's attached to something or someone we can care about.  Dredd is a robotic guy in a uniform that doesn't exude any personality whatsoever.  At one point in this movie, he's fighting 3 fellow judges dressed exactly as he is.  I couldn't tell them apart.  It didn't make any difference, proving that anyone wearing the suitable outfit could play this character.  An automaton persona was all that was required to play any of the characters in this movie, no one stood out.  The star of this movie was obviously meant to be the action sequences.  Making this a fabulous looking offering not unlike Iron Pyrite (pretty, but useless).

For me, DREDD lacked the basic elements that I look for which guarantees multiple viewing pleasure.  The missing ingredient here is the human factor.  Dreed was this drab and dreary guy who could just as easily have been a CGI creation.  In fact, they really didn't need any characters at all, just gunfire, explosions, and all that lovely Slo-Mo.

4790447,5,B005LAII7G,"As a fan of Judge Dredd in comic form since 1987, wanting a kick ass Dredd movie has always been a dream. 1995 saw Stallone placed as the lawman, and that, for lack of a better word - failed.

This time around, we have Dredd. Karl Urban was slotted to play the lawman. My first Urban experience was in RED, and I really liked him there. Picturing him as Judge Dredd, was hard for me, but I kept an open mind, because I felt he couldn't do worse than 95.

Can I say I was totally floored and mesmerized on opening night? Not only did Karl Urban pull off Dredd, there were times you forget it's Karl and can just see Dredd from the comic come shining through. Finding out later the Karl Urban, himself, is a Judge Dredd fan as I am was icing on the cake. Olivia Thirlby and Lena Headey added so much more to the movie with their portrayals of Cassandra Anderson and Ma-Ma. I made sure I purchased this on Blu-Ray.

As a side note, I have heard about the knock off RAID-Redemption. And I can say Dredd holds it's weight well. Raid, is nothing but a knock off made with Dredd's storyline and few changes here and there. Yes, I watched Raid, and I was appalled at the blatant rip off done by the director.

There is no point comparing this movie to the first Dredd movie.  There is no plot similarity and no comedy relief (which helped the first movie get by due to a silly premise).
I am not a fan of the original comic book Dredd so I can't comment if this follows the comic book character.

4790609,5,B005LAII7G,"In this era of slick but ultimately soulless PG-13 blockbusters, DREDD is a welcome reminder that a concisely told, small-scale action movie can be just as entertaining as watching hundreds of CGI cities explode. Unapologetically gritty and honest in its ambitions, DREDD is like a refreshing blast of punk rock in a scene grown used to showy, interminable guitar solos. Looking at it this way, it's easy to see why this movie has enthused many to the point of obsession while simply confusing others.

The creative team gets pretty much everything right. Alex Garland sensibly keeps the word count down in his taut screenplay, for the most part leaving the characters' actions to do the talking. The artistic cinematography really comes alive in the colorful slow-mo scenes, creating the most enjoyable movie rendering of the comic book form I've seen since SIN CITY. The 3D is also masterfully done. It makes me wonder why many Hollywood films with far bigger budgets have been unable to come up with something as visually stunning as this. The directing by Pete Travis is solid and functional, and while there are a few rough edges, for me that's all part of the film's punky appeal.

The excellent cast really throw themselves into their roles. Karl Urban plays Dredd as a nigh-unstoppable force of nature with no time for anguished reflection, which is just as it should be. Olivia Thirlby is a revelation as Judge Anderson, striking the perfect balance between vulnerability and toughness. Lena Headey oozes dead-eyed menace as Ma-Ma, the villain of the piece. Her understated, even tragic performance makes a refreshing change from the ludicrous super-villains that usually appear in action movies.

DREDD is one of the most immersive movies I've seen for a long time. Its visual style, its evocative electronic score and the performances of its leads all work together to create a fascinating world that lingers in the memory long after the credits roll. While early John Carpenter movies are the obvious reference point, it could also be said that DREDD is comparable to BLADE RUNNER in that both films focus on building their own distinctive atmospheres instead of following the trends of the day. And like its more illustrious predecessor, although DREDD flopped on its cinematic release, its reputation has been growing and growing ever since.

The film is a worthy adaptation of the Judge Dredd comics with a script written by Alex Garland (The Beach, Sunshine). For those of you concerned that the film is like Sylvester Stallone's ""Judge Dredd"" from the 90s, you need not worry. The film is stylishly shot, aggressively violent and wickedly funny. Karl Urban (Star Trek, LOTR, Bourne Supremacy) absolutely inhabits the role of a morally upright fascist and puts in enough humor and wit to make the character unpredictable at times. Olivia Thrilby plays his partner, Anderson, and she does a pretty damn good job in the role and holding her own. Both leads are very believable. Lena Headey (Terminator:SCC, Game of Thrones, 300) is great as the film's villain ""Maw-Maw"", a brutal gang leader whose apartment complex the two Judges must face down in order to bring her to justice.

I went in with low expectations and the film far exceeded what I thought I'd expect. It's a fun little film and definitely a must have. The 3D is pretty cool from a stylistic standpoint but over all?

4790636,5,B005LAII7G,"O.k. I am a huge fan of the comics. I never got into the safe, coffee table marvel comic story lines and always felt Dredd to have more of an edge with its drug addicts, terrorists, mutants and serial killers that filled the story lines of the best British comic that ever graced the magazine shelf at the store. For years i looked forward to the movie...then Stallone did one that was NOT anything to do with the comic OR character.......and that was that!...until now!

The Good-
Its shot in a dirty, grimy way (as Mega City One should be) some people are complaining about this but i understand this was done to make the 'Slow Mo' scenes much more clear and sharp which moves me onto my next point. The Slow Mo scenes were absolutely beautiful, they were shot in extreme slow motion with a track that sounded like Loscil's 'Argonaut'. The effect was a tiny glimpse into the mind of a poor drug taker seeing a snatched moment of perfection in an otherwise ugly world...i remember the scene with Ma Ma in the bath and the droplets of water looked like a a shower of diamonds floating in the air. Cinematically combining these moments with the grey, grim futuristic settings with only flashes of sickly and nuclear yellows to draw the eye i was impressed.

Its Good Vs Evil in a strictly darwinian sense. The justice is doled out in a totally impartial way...many people have said this is pure fascism but these people obviously do not know the story behind the judges...retirement for them is called 'the long walk' and means leaving Mega City One to wander the cursed earth and try to bring justice to the mutant wastelands. The Judges are selfless upholders of the law who reap no reward other than seeing a perp get what they deserve.

Dredd the man was a job well done by Mr Urban, admittedly its not the hardest role to act but it requires a little subtlety in his growls that Dredd fans like myself saw and appreciated. Anderson was as fragile and uncertain as any rookie would be on the job (i loved her mental battles with the gang member 'Kay') MaMa was probably the most evil (and skanky) looking female criminal i have seen on the screen in a long time! i really felt for the tech guy who was terrified of her!

Yes there was no glorious end-of-level shoot-out with the boss...MaMa was just another perp to Dredd and he summed up the understatement when the Chief Judge asked him at the end what happened here (After the night long battle in the block with dozens of enemies dead) and he simply replied '...Drug bust'

The Bad-
These are just little gripes of my own as a huge fan...I would have loved to have seen more of Mega City One and its huge range of interesting sub-cultures. The city looked a little sparse and it should have been a little more like bladerunner complete with hover pods flying about. It did not feel as futuristic as the comic.

The marketing and the 'Crappy Stallone Dredd Drag Factor'...basically killed this film at the box office as everyone thought ""oh they have re-made that crappy movie?"" and thus it did not make it its targets for a sequel deal however....Its wonderful to see this has become an instant cult classic and the Blu Ray & DVD sales and fan interest will probably put the baddest Lawman in the planet up where he belongs on the big screen with a multi-movie franchise!

Perhaps more importantly than comparing this movie to the original movie is the comparison to the actual comic. and in that, this movie takes the cake... in fact, I might argue that this is the best comic-to-movie adaptation ever.  The filmmakers were able to take the grimy, gritty, dark urban feel of the characters and the environment and even the dialogue in the comic and effectively translate it onto the screen.  It's difficult to do, extremely difficult to do *well*, and this movie has done it exceptionally well.

I'm not super big on owning movies, since I have an Amazon Prime membership and mostly just watch all the free movies and TV that comes with Prime membership... But this movie is a major exception, and was purchased as soon as I saw it come out on Amazon.

Given the brutality and seeming lawlessness of the ""judges"", it was hard to root for the protagonists. On the positive side, it moved along briskly to its gory conclusion.",1365897600,2,581,4.339449541284404
4790640,5,B005LAII7G,"This film, while an adaptation, gets the character 100%; it's probably the most faithful translation of a comic character into live-action - on a par with Jackie Earle Haley's Rorshach.

Unfortunately the dire shadow of the 1995 film could not be expelled - its tarnishing of the brand back in the 90's and in the interim due to its continual rotation on cable and video, damaged the current film's box-office potential with a wider audience last year but, it's become apparent that due to the constant retail sales that have out-sold its box-office numbers and the overwhelmingly favourable reviews among fans and non-fans, that this film is in no regard a flop nor an artistic failure, it's a triumph.

I highly recommend it and to quote Judge Dredd's original co-creator and writer: ""There's nothing in the film that isn't Judge Dredd"".",1365897600,2,839,4.943262411347518
4790641,4,B005LAII7G,"The plot is simple enough: Judges are the only rule of law in a post-apocalyptic futuristic setting where crime, drugs and violence run rampant and the law is pretty much nonexistent. In Mega City One there is Judge Dredd, one of its most loyal, unforgiving and harshest Judges. Stuck with a rookie Judge, he gets embroiled in a drug war in one of the City's major housing developments, Peach Trees. Run by Ma-Ma, a former hooker turned drug war lady, is plummeting the city further into chaos and violence with the proliferation of her drug, Slo-Mo.

When I watched this revamp (and yes, I did like the original with Stallone), I was still recollecting the  original film,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Judge-Dredd/dp/B004IDG97S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Judge Dredd</a>&nbsp;(1995), in all its cheesy, deadpan glory. Both versions are based off the British comic of the same name (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Judge-Dredd-The-Complete-Carlos-Ezquerra-Vol-1/dp/1613775504/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Judge Dredd: The Complete Carlos Ezquerra Vol. 1</a>) but with completely different story lines.

What the modern version has in similarity to the original is its protagonist: Dredd, who has a plethora of cliched one-liners and a constant frown throughout. It's supposed to be cheesy and Karl Urban (Bourne Supremacy, Star Trek) does exactly as he should have and is an homage to the original. Understand it, accept it and move on or you will hate it beginning to end. Not once do we see Dredd's face. He is just a face of the Law. Anderson (Olivia Thirbly, Juno, The Darkest Hour) is our emotional rope through the dreary morass. She is naive but stubborn, hopeful and scared. It's not in-depth; however, it was a nice cut through all the brutality. Lenda Headey (Game of Thrones, 300, Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles) as Ma-Ma was a nice turn though one-dimensional but anything less or more would have set the tone of the movie off. She is the perfect evil, heartless and utterly ruthless villainess, the complete opposite of our hero, Dredd.

Dredd, as a whole, is slower paced but steady and didn't drag. It's violent and it's got action but there is little dialogue and characterization above the basic, yet somehow, I enjoyed it. That's probably because of the creative, darker, edgy, tense directing and the graphic visuals. It is self contained within one setting and that's usually dull but it wasn't. Pete Travis (Vantage Point) does something that is DIFFERENT. It's hard to pinpoint what that is but it works. From the production, the look, the visuals, the special FX and its minimalistic approach to everything else. The setting from Cursed Earth to Mega City One to Peach Trees has a melange of ideas--Mad Max slash Waterworld, late 90s Ghetto bleakness, comic cool, gritty edge of dystopian dreary video game vibe--that melds perfectly in unison.

Again, there is nothing new in the terms of the plot and I doubt the sequel that is most definitely to come will offer us more. It's what the director does, showing us his plot through sustained action and unrelentless, saturated violence. It obliterates the actors themselves who are mere caricatures but that's okay. We get enough background of Mega City One, of Dredd and his rookie, Judge Anderson. Those elements are uncomplicated, simple and basic, and necessary in order to get to the heart of it all, action and the visual overload. In the end, it's all sensory information. Some will hate it. I didn't. Some won't get it, and that's okay.",1365811200,3,3607,5.309982486865149

I really liked this movie because the female lead starts out seeming a little fragile but ends the movie as a total bad-a**, without becoming slutty. She is a very empowering female character and I really enjoyed how tastefully she was characterized, especially with it being a comic book movie.

The movie is full on Quentin Tarantino-esque violence fest, but I think they handled it surprisingly artfully.

4790704,4,B005LAII7G,"On the face of it, this movie doesn't sound like it is going to be up to much.  Minimal plot (two judges, one Dredd the other a rookie have to enter a huge tower block in pursuit of some bad guys, and have to work their way up the mega-block to the head honcho at the top, killing bad guys and trying to survive as they go), lesser known actors, limited budget for sci-fi actioner and a director who although he showed promise in Vantage Point, has spent a lot more time in television than the big screen.
And yet!  With all this to overcome, it works.  The milieu and the characters are interesting enough, the action brutal and undiluted enough and crucially the direction tight enough to pull you through and be left suitably entertained.  In stark contrast to Stallone's bloated 1995 version, this movie gets straight to business, and business of the day is an `average day' in the life of Judge Dredd.  Instead of all the backstory and character explanation, screenwriter Alex Garland has Dredd and his psychic rookie bringing their judgement in some innovative ways, hinting rather than ponderously explaining the essence of the character - although you could argue that the biting satire intended with an all powerful judge and executioner is somehow lost in this interpretation.  It's an extremely effective storyline for delivering what the fans want, while allowing a fresh audience in - all in a manageable budget.  Satisfyingly, the punches have not been pulled - no pandering to the censor here a la Taken 2 or Die Hard 5 to ensure a rating allowing the widest audience - the violence is brutal and gore is not short on supply, making this not one for the squeamish.  Although I'm not a huge 3D fan, if you do watch this in 3D the effects are quite satisfying - it benefits from being actually shot in 3D, and not ""dimensionalised"" in post production.  Even the music works - neither traditional or melodic, it's a pulsing and throbbing industrial score, which serves the material well.
Karl Urban manages to be less the `man with no name' and more `man with no face', channeling Clint Eastwood's minimalism into his demeanor and raspy voice, managing to convince you that there is a man behind the mask without resorting to removing the helmet, and Lena Headey is also a wonderful surprise as the villainess.  In the end though it is the lean script and tight direction that make this worth watching, despite the fact that ultimately it is a lengthy series of people getting killed which doesn't actually amount to much.  It has enough of a character study in it though, that I'd be interested in seeing Urban reprise the role, even if the weak box office appears to make it unlikely.",1365811200,3,2698,4.6828752642706135

This movie is not (in any way) a sequel to that movie. It is a complete re-launch, entirely. It is packed from start to finish with loads of action and gun-play, and the acting is good. Although this movie is sci-fi, there really aren't a whole lot of sci-fi elements to it, so if you aren't a fan of that particular genre, don't be afraid that this movie will be off-putting to you by overloading you with all sorts of sci-fi gadgetry or exotic locales or aliens. All the characters are human and the crimes being committed are all very real problems. It just happens to be set in a slightly futuristic setting.

Karl Urban is a great actor, and he plays an excellent Judge Dredd. Lena Headey, who has been making waves in Hollywood ever since the movie&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/300/dp/B000V39KDO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">300</a>, is an excellent villain in this movie, and newcomer Olivia Thirlby play an excellent Judge Anderson - the new recruit who happens to be a rare and powerful telepath.

The bad: The story line, plot, and script was lame. The majority of the movie takes place in one location which was a city sized apartment building. Also, unlike the first movie this one had very little in the way of comic relief that the first movie had.

The only reason I gave it 3 stars instead of 1 or 2 is due to the improved special effects and the actors did what they could do with a poorly written script.  For a scifi buff it's okay.  For a regular movie goer it stunk pretty bad.",1365724800,2,730,4.223021582733813

4790809,4,B005LAII7G,"First, a couple warnings.  I'm not a comic book reader, but I have read a few graphic novels so I understand the appeal.  Secondly, I never saw ""Judge Dredd"" with Sylvester Stallone, successfully warned away at the time by my son.  Frankly I've begun to put some distance between myself and many of these loud, violent and poorly scripted films.  Coming late to the party, I have to say this is a pretty damn good movie.

Karl Urban is Judge Dredd, perhaps the most feared of the new judges in the new order where they investigate crime and act as judge, jury and executioner as warranted.  It's a different futuristic world.  One where 800 million inhabitants occupy a metropolitan area that stretches from Boston to D. C.  We're not sure how this all happened or what the rest of the world looks like, but who cares.

The area is a concrete jungle mostly run by gangsters, thugs and other miscreants.  Attempting to keep everything under control is the police force and the judges.  Dredd and his rookie training partner, Anderson (Olivia Thirlby) are sent to a high rise to investigate the falling deaths of 3 men.  This is also the headquarters of Ma-Ma (a scarred up Lena Headey), who is in control of the manufacture and distribution of ""Slo-Mo"" a new drug.  In a plot reminiscent of ""The Raid,"" Dredd and Anderson are trapped inside the high rise and are forced to battle their way out.  This is mindless pap, but it is also wildly entertaining and well made.

The Blu ray transfer is in 1080p and has a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  Surprisingly the film isn't flush with color nor should it be.  The director, Pete Travis elects to go with a muted, surreal effect.  The exteriors are grey and yellowish.  The interiors are likewise intentional bleak looking.  The audio is DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 and is amazingly excellent throughout the movie.  I was really impressed with the constant envelopment with me in the middle.  I'm set up with a pair of sub-woofers included in the mix and they were earning their keep with this film.  The dialog comes across crystal clear and when the bullets start flying, I started ducking.  Sure, check it out.",1365292800,2,2145,4.658666666666667
4790810,4,B005LAII7G,"This movie is a total new movie from the original Judd dredd.  I really like this movie and should give it a honest viewing.  In my option, it three times better than the original.",1365292800,2,180,4.264705882352941
4790861,4,B005LAII7G,"Firstly, other than the title, this has no connection with that stinky pile that contained Stallone and Rob Sneider.  Even the stories don't line up which was a great decision; it's a clean start.  Lets start with the uniform. It looks like something a tactical cop would wear; leather, weathered, scratched up.  The uniform has seen a lot o action, so has the bike.  The city landscape is dirty, gritty, unruly and filled with desperate people.  So the crime is off the scale.  A place where Dredd belongs.  Keith Urban plays Dredd the way you imagine; like a Clint Eastwood western.  Tough, smart, and a man of few words who's ready to bust some caps.  However, devoid of the ego typical of these type of heros.  He is not a man on a mission.  Many of judgements are very matter of fact.  Just a man with a job to do.  However the action is any but mattter of fact;  if you want someone to get dead in a hurry; try 3 belt fed 50 cals and not concern yourself with the bystanders.  These dudes weren't playing around.  The story, however, was not entirely original.  It is similar to The Raid: Redemption or you can even see shades of New Jack City.  I think this is better film than both of those films, largely thanks to the main character.  Keith Urban is an actor that doesn't get his due, and this film should have raised his stock.  I just think people still associate Dredd with Stallone and that is unfortunate.  Best thing to do is pretend that the earlier film did not happen.  This is the first film, and it was done right.",1365206400,2,1535,4.368794326241135
4790862,5,B005LAII7G,"Yes, indeed. This is one that has been around since the start of all things Star Wars. Starting off as a one-off comic character, he quickly demanded his own title. Dredd has amazing 3D, gratuitous violence, frenetic action sequencing, superb editing and fairly believable acting. This is the guy that thanks to twenty years ago might only be remembered for the cheesy one-liner ""I AM THE LAW!"". This film surpasses the Stalone version and does not look behind.

For those who did not know, Judge Dredd is a mean streak gone mental, the most infamous and dangerous of a super police force in Mega City One. Everything you expect from a movie from such a simplistic plot point ensues at break neck speed. Criminal mastermind stages a district take down on the same day Dredd has to evaluate a rookie's front line performance.

And kudos to Kurt Urban, who has played in so many movies and played his part so well, most people might not realize this is the same bad arse that was in The Two Towers, Chronicles of Riddick, and his pitch-perfect part as Bones in the Star Trek revamp series. He is proving to be a powerhouse, and this film needed that kind of weight to the performance. The helmet does not come off. Not even for a second. And you still see a great job on screen.

The slight downfalls include one too many slo-mo scenes (even if they were a plot device) and the fact that the film has enough grit to encompass every Western that Clint Eastwood ever did. These trifles are easy to ignore so long as you realize this is a 'comic book film' and 100% true to canon. With all its kind rearing its head at Hollywood, Dredd reminds us that not all comics have spandex-clad super-powered characters.

Some just barrel their way past the critics and naysayers and are found in a violent part of this fan's heart. Apparently, happiness is indeed a warm Lawgiver... er, gun.",1365206400,6,1877,4.560830860534125

Dredd this time around is much more closely aligned with the comic. Not a remake but a re-imagining, Dredd captures the greatness of 80's action movies while retaining relevance to current events. Science fiction serves to reflect modern times through a warped mirror and Dredd does so with brilliance.

The camera-work is outstanding, maintaining a gritty over-the-shoulder view during certain shootouts, while never taking itself too seriously. The acting is solid and the plotting tense. The characters feel human and we see through their facades to the weariness and fear beneath.

4791003,4,B005LAII7G,"I vaguely remember the Stallone version from when I was a kid.  At the time, it was an enjoyable sci-fi movie.  I'm not sure what I would think of it, today.  In any case, whenever I saw that they were doing another adaption of the character, I was intrigued.  Still, it was only until recently that I got around to checking it out (my first RedBox experience, too).

Basically, the movie is a a short, action-packed sci-fi film that aims low and hits surprisingly high.  It's a modest, unpretentious movie that sets out to entertain, and it does. Karl Urban is solemn and stoic as Dredd, but he still emanates a certain icy charisma that never lets the character become boring.  He's the embodiment of an ideal-- or, if it not an ideal, a stereotype-- and despite the character never becoming emotionally relatable as a real human being, there is an undercurrent of humanity to him that can't be entirely disguised by his helmet and body armor.

Dredd has a rookie Judge to assess during the mayhem. Judge Anderson, played by Olivia Thirlby, is a mousy, yet capable character that the audience will root for automatically.  This isn't a tear-jerker, though.  Dredd and Anderson do not share heartfelt moments.  They do not bond.  Anderson is not affirmed by Dredd. Instead, Dredd is an observer to Anderson's affirmation of herself as the film progresses.  This was a nice touch from the writers, since I don't think we would want to see Dredd affectionately tousling Judge Anderson's hair and saying ""nice job, kid,"" or some other cliche line of that sort.

Are there ""one-liners?""  Yes, there are, but they are so well delivered they will not make you cringe.  There's a subtle 80's vibe to the dialogue in Dredd, but its incorporated in such a way that it never becomes campy. It's almost like the writers took a script from an old Schwarzenegger or Van Damme movie and skillfully edited it into something smart and serious.

The only thing I disliked about the movie was the villain, Ma-Ma, played by the always watchable Lena Headey (looking quite rough, here, but justifiably). Her character is one-dimensional and uninteresting to me. The character serves only as a finish line for an awesome and exciting race.

4791009,4,B005LAII7G,I liked the movie a lot and found it to be very entertaining. Actors did a great job of portraying their sensitive profession while spraying pullets and other projectiles in just about every direction. 4/5 for sure,1364688000,2,214,4.8108108108108105
4791010,5,B005LAII7G,"This film is a vast improvement over the big budget Stalone version and is very close to the original character portrayed for over 40 years in 2000AD and Judge Dredd magazine. Karl Urban was born to play Dredd. He has every perfected every nuance and even the body language of Dredd - all of this without ever once taking off the helmet!

For Dredd fans this film is a huge hit and I've watched it several times since buying the bluray disk - it never gets stale. Sadly in the States the public are not familiar with the Dredd character so it wasn't the mega-hit it deserved but if you enjoy action, dark humor and bleak futuristic settings, this is the film.

Judge Anderson is also brilliantly portrayed as the Rookie judge coming to terms with the brutality of the job. While Dredd is already a granite faced veteran, Anderson starts the film with doubts and moments of hesitation. In effect this is a ""coming of age"" story and again the actress (Olivia Thirlby) has nailed her character brilliantly.

The only limitation on this film is budget; there are a few moments we are reminded this film was made on limited funds, however I am reminded of Pitch Black which in many ways owes its brilliance to the same combination of excellent actors and script-over-budget excellence.

I can only hope that somehow everyone on this film gets picked up to make a bigger budget sequel. There are many rich stories in the Dredd magazine, and many which reflect on society today.",1364688000,13,1471,4.624521072796935
4791130,2,B005LAII7G,"Let me start off by saying I love SIFI and really love my 3-D TV with 3-D movies. However I have discovered that when it comes to 3-D movies ,not all that glitters is gold and with the price tag on them what I have been doing is previewing the movie in 2-D  by renting or getting them from my library. By doing that, I have been able to save myself from throwing good money down the bad drain.

Now to Dredd. My take is it was nothing new , and it had a one beat note plot. What I felt Carl Urban did , was to do his or the director's vision of an imitation of Sylvester Stallone from the original movie ,Judge Dredd. Much of this movie was dark which I have seen in other 3-D movies and does not show well.
One thing I must say that there were a couple of parts that that looked like it could have been cool in 3-D . With all that said, I think I saved myself some money by not buying this one because all it was about was one after another bang, bang you're Dredd",1364688000,,965,3.8934010152284264

However, I gave it four stars due to a streaming issue. The issue was that the playback was interrupted by periodical blackouts, yet the sound remained constant. In other words, the screen would go black and come back on. I will say that I streamed it through my computer, and I'm not sure if that had something to do with it.

The story lines are completely different from each other, which is why I think they did such a great job. I wasn't watching actors trying to reinvent or copy the original actors of Judge Dredd.

Even the city in Blade Runner looks better than this. Maybe they should have gotten Ridley Scott to helm this one.

You'll love the colors, the sound design, the slow motion effects, the simple plot, the setting, and the characters.

You'll hate the slow motion effects, the simple plot, the low budget, and the feeling of wanting more.

For some the slow motion will disrupt the pace of the film but for others it will enhance the 3D experience and visual one as well. The fact the movie takes place all in one building block, might put off some viewers due to lack of variety in setting but some might  think of it as a neat storytelling tool; It makes it feel like the story is taking place in real-time. The low budget means that there are moments that feel like there could have been more or done better if the budget were higher; for example, the movie might have taken place in more than one building block or had a more climactic ending. Speaking of the ending, it is more or less lacking. I feel that this is a fault due to the script as much as it is because of the budget. The whole movie feels like a demo for potential Dredd sequels.

Regardless of all this, I really enjoyed watching Dredd and I am curious to see more of him, Anderson and Mega City 1. Urban IS Dredd, his performance had me smiling the whole time. Thrilby as Anderson gave me another celebrity crush. And Mega City 1 is a setting with SO much possibilities for future stories (can't say much without spoiling some plot points).

Unfortunately that version approached the material with a thick coating of ""camp"", perhaps an attempt to make it feel like a comic book and slough off some of the excessive violence that are a basic part of that future dystopia.

That film was based on the premise of Judge Dredd being pulled into a conspiracy to take over all remaining fragments of the law by your typical psychopathic ex-Judge escaped from prison and bent on revenge against the whole world.

The current film chose to take a more realistic tack, giving the entire world a hard coating of grit, grime and decay and discarded the attempts a humor the first film found itself relying on to make it paletable.

But as I sat through it, I realized why it had been released and instantly crashed at the box office.

This is simply a terribly unpleasant thing to watch.

Not that its poorly produced or shot. It isn't. The production values are first rate and the effects are amazing.

What makes it difficult to endure is a combination of the bland storyline and an overload of meaningless violence.

While the Stallone film had a moderately interesting storyline, this one feels more like an episode of ""Cops"" from the distant future. It's basically nothing more than a drug bust in a really, REALLY bad neighborhood gone wrong, winding up in a massive seige and hostage situation. The fact that the nieghborhood is a single massive high rise that can seal itself with massive blast doors, thus trapping the Judges and the perpetrators inside is the only reason this film exists.

Actually, the true only reason is so the producers could set up the bloodiest, most grusome, most distasteful collection of violence ever filmed. It's nothing more than a ""first person shooter"" game that you can only observe, not play. ""Innocent civilians"" are there only to be killed in horrific ways and by the dozen.

The fact that the effects are so detailed and realistic only makes it all the more difficult to watch. I found it producing the same vague, disquieting feelings I get when I observe the heaps of bodies recorded in old Nazi Holocaust footage.

In short, this is one of the most heartless, cold and disturbing films I've seen in quite some time, primarily because there is no transcendant or uplifting point needing to be made. It is just grusome violence for its own sake to the point of being marginally pornographic.

The very fact that so many people find it exciting or entertaining is, in itself, very disturbing. The fact that I also was impressed by the precision and realism of the violence makes me feel a little guilty.

My thoughts are, if you do watch this film and don't find yourself at least thinking ""enough already"" long before it ends, you should perhaps worry about your own store of human empathy not being quite as strong as it should be.

If you think it's great and you want to watch it again and again, I pray you never get your hands on a firearm. It's that disturbing. Trust me.",1363564800,,3223,4.723707664884135

Again the movie is very entertaining- the scenes where they take slo-mo are awesome, and we noticed way more effects that were designed for 3d, like when dredd punches one guy's voicebox in.

Imagine the complete opposite, dirty, gritty....DREDD!
 I thought Urban did a masterful job as Joe Dredd. In one scene...he's choking out a perp for info and Anderson asks him to stop because her way would be  more effective. Urban turns, with nostrils flared and Dredd's trademark scowl....hell at that moment, he IS Dredd! Spitting image of a Brian Bolland DREDD pic.

There was an actual story and the concept stayed faithful to the comics. Karl Urban was great, which is saying a lot since we never get to see his face. That's what I call impressive acting.

This version is far more faithful to that version than Stallone's effort (not that I thought that version was bad, but this one is better).

One thing to keep in mind about this is that the original comic is a satire of American culture, taken to its extreme and from the point of view of those of us in ol' Blighty, and this movie reflects that well. Just remember that satire does not mean parody--a parodic film would be played more for comic effect; this one is handled with deadly earnestness.

Decent action set pieces; somewhat over the top, but that does reflect the original material, at least what I remember of it.

Dredd is suitably ruthless, but still possesses more compassion and humanity, in his way, than some of his fellow Judges, despite his rigid adherence to ""the Law.""",1362787200,2,948,4.597633136094674

There's no real character development or in depth plot. As stated, it a pretty simple action flick; explosions and lots of shooting.

Based on the comic, I believe it to be a great adaptation. Great visuals and good acting on Karl Urban's part (hey it's hard to express different types of sneers while always wearing a helmet). When watching this movie, just enjoy the ride.",1362787200,,677,4.586776859504132

4792041,4,B005LAII7G,"I was not expecting much from this movie, but was pleasantly surprised.  If you want a good futuristic action flick, this is it.

What I really enjoyed about this movie was the filming technique, music, and multiple homages to Blade Runner.

Visually, the movie is kind of a cross between RoboCop/District 9/ and 300.  there are some scenes where the CGI is overdone to the point where it no longer looks like a movie...or animation from the 1980s...however, these are usually drug-induced ""dream-like"" sequences, so maybe this was the intent.

Substantively, there is not much to this film.  The movie presents a ""day in the life of"" a ""Judge"" in megacity one, and a rookie he is tasked with evaluating.  The world depicted is dark, gritty, uncaring, corrupt, and beyond saving.  The Judges try and maintain order, although without any notions of due process.  The accused are adjudged and sentenced on site, and the Judges carry out the punishments---usually death.  Dredd and his rookie get trapped in a mega high rise apartment complex--a ""city within a city""--where they do battle with an ex-hooker ganster/drug dealer who has taken over the building and wants the Judges' heads on a platter.  Dredd is a no-emotions, cool operator, who dispenses life sentences based on bad acts with no regard for the mental state or motivation of the guilty.  His sidekick is a telepath, and provides a empathetic ""foil"" to Dredd's cold nature.

The filming does a nice job of presenting a sense of claustrophobia and ""no way out""--although you never really fear that the judges will not come out on top.

Most of the movie is a standard shoot-em-up, as the Judges first try and escape the building, and then decide to go after the baddie.  There is a small plot twist; but most of the movie is predictable.  What is nice is that the movie avoids most of the usual hollywood cliches of hero saving the planet, getting the girl, etc.  Dredd gets out alive and presumably suits up the next day and does the same thing.

So why am I giving it 4 starts?  Visually, the movie is pretty stunning and really ""brings"" you into the world.  The special effects are pretty good and the Judges have some cool tech they bring along.  The DTS sound is great.  This is not an oscar-type movie....Rather, it is a good  Saturday afternoon popcorn.beer flick.  I was entertained, and will probably watch it again.  They don't make many of these types of movies anymore, and it is a shame because Dredd is just good escapist fun and doesn't pretend to be anything more.",1362528000,2,2541,4.733485193621868
4792042,4,B005LAII7G,"This was a solid rendition of Dredd. The characters were well developed, story was cool, 3D was great and it was non-stop action from start to finish. I would definitely recommend this movie.",1362528000,2,191,4.818181818181818
4792043,1,B005LAII7G,"Disclaimer #1: I have not been a lifelong Dredd fan and apart from prior awkward film adaptations and a few graphic novels, am not an expert.

Disclaimer #2: I am a girl, and do not attach any degree of self-esteem to identifying with square-jawed fascists, so I have no pony in this race whatsoever.

In case you're under the age of 20 and missed the original point of Judge Dredd, it was a piece of social commentary most relevant in the 1980's UK featuring a very recognizable Orwellian future of overpopulation, hyperscarcity, and fascism- all very well-traveled literary themes in 70's and early 80's literature, film and television.

Before I've lost ALL of the tl;dr crowd (as opposed to the 90+% I've already lost), the point is this: you were NOT supposed to empathize with or identify with Judge Dredd or any of his ridiculous counterparts. They were supposed to be caricatures of a legal system run amok, a Patriot Act carried to its logical extension into a dystopian future where there are way more criminals than jails, and nobody really cares what the social causes of crime are anymore. It was about fascism, plain and simple: the idea that if society continued on its current course, we would ultimately accept the ultimate abrogation of our civil liberties and freedoms for protection from the near-total anarchy that complete scarcity would bring about, and we'd let a bunch of hypermacho cops run around dispensing absurdly harsh penalties for every crime they could come across. Also, there are psychics. Who are universally hot chicks. And a Judge that was a fish. And the Grim Reaper and stuff.

This movie, which I hated even more than the 90's version that I merely disliked, stripped out any higher concepts completely in favor of a very generic high-octane shoot-em-up. Now, don't get me wrong, I like gun porn as much as the next girl that likes gun porn, but if you're going to borrow an intellectual property, you should at least take a vague stab at incorporating something more than the name and vague look of what you're doing (I'm looking at YOU, Star Trek).

Short no-spoiler synopsis: Judge Dredd and a trainee Judge shoot their way up from the ground floor of a gigantic crime-infested tenement to the top, where they have a not-terribly climactic confrontation with the big boss, a lady drug lord who employs a big s***load of people who are all guilty of being brown and poor (which seems to be what most people in Mega City One are guilty of in this particular imagining of ""Dredd"").  Seriously, that's it. That's the entire plot. Oh, yeah. The trainee is a psychic. Because she's a hot chick. Which ends up being barely relevant to the story. Except that she can sense that everyone wants to rape her. You know, because they're criminals. Also, they sing the raps and shoot all the jobs.

If this were just a regular unbranded action flick, I'd give it 3 stars or so- it's very generic gun action, lean on plot and high on shooter porn- but to be honest, it isn't even fantastic action. Gun fights have the silly absurdity of Robocop- bad guys shoot thousands of rounds at no one and nothing, protagonists are magically immune to gunfire, no one runs out of ammo, and conflicts are as empty and meaningless as a platformer video game.

Like a tidal wave or an out of control fire in a disaster flick, the future is just another form of a big bad movie monster. Mega-city One of the new movie Dredd is no exception. A bleak future for sure, where 800 million people live in an enclosed society which stretches from Boston to D.C., where crime runs rampant, there are twelve major crimes committed per minute. Inside the Peach Tree block, which is where the majority of the action takes place, there is an unemployment rate of 96%, I'm not sure if that includes the drug dealers and slum lords or not.
 When I first heard of the updated Judge Dredd I mockingly joked that the tagline should read ""do you Dredd it"", I wasn't expecting much after the terrible Sylvester Stallone failed blockbuster of the 1990's, but I couldn't have been more erroneous in my assumption. Dredd turns out to be one of the most exhilarating comic book adventures in a while, it is also a puff of welcome retro rehashed air that is pretty enthralling to take in.
 Taking a more scaled back, realistic and understated approach than the nineties movie did, this is like a good looking 80's action-sci-fi throwback that captures the spirit of that era batter than some other recent films. It's stark, dark and engulfing in it's slant. In many ways it is the opposite of the earlier screen incarnation.
 In this gritty and grimy future world the Judges are the only thing standing in the way of anarchy, they are cops, but they also act as the whole juridical system including jury and executioner. Judge Dredd (Karl Urban) is the biggest bad ass of them all, sent on a routine call he and his rookie partner (Olivia Thirlby) find themselves cornered off and trapped inside the Peach Tree block, which is run by the ruthless drug manufacturer Ma-Ma (Lena Heady) and her clan. Her new drug of choice, slo-mo, allows it's uses to experience the world at one percent of it's normal speed, so it's like the reversal of crack. She means business when it comes to not allowing the Judges to escape with their suspect, a gang member (Wood Harris) who can blow the lid off of her whole organization.
 The plot is nicely uncomplicated, in this day and age when action films so often allow themselves to get bogged down in overtly complex scenarios. The minimalist approach isn't just limited to the storytelling, but also the visual effects, which are lightly peppered through out, stylish but never over dominating with a refreshing lack of cartoonish CGI. The production design is properly atmospheric, unlike it's blotted predecessor. The violence, while bloody and graphic, is  often limited to short sudden and thrilling outbursts.
 Played out as sort of a cross between ""Dirty"" Harry and Robocop is Dredd himself, now portrayed by Karl Urban, who is a much more ideal choice for this material than was Sly Stallone two decades ago. Urban plays the role with a deep serious growl to match his menacing scowl, a low toned voice to equal that of Clint Eastwood. I am not familiar with the comic book 2000AD, which is Dredd's source of origin, but I understand that it has it's serious devotees who were appalled by the earlier version, among the truer to it's source is the fact that Urban keeps his helmet on through out the entire picture creating a rewarding mystique about him.
. As Cassandra Anderson, Olivia Thirlby is the emotional center to the film, a newbie who may not be cut out for the kind of fascist justice she is required to deal out. Originating from the same slums she's targeting she has a more conflicted view than does Dredd. She is also a mutant, not with three breasts or anything, but she is psychic so she knows one's guilt or innocence, as well as their true motivations. Thirlby is very impressive here, she all but owns the movie, with dirty blonde hair and deeply expressive eyes, I'm glad  she's not kept behind a helmet the whole time, she's also more fun to look at than Urban.
 Also quite admirable is Lena Headey, Sarah Connor from TV's incarnation of the Terminator franchise and the movie 300, she is a force to be reckoned with as the film's main villain. A woman who's as strong as any of the men in the picture and as scary as any villain this year.
 The story and it's approach recall the best work of John Carpenter, as does Paul Leonard-Morgan's excellent mood setting techno score which helps set the pace the way Carpenter was known to do with music in the past. Likewise, the taunt ninety-five minute run time and keen editing by Mark Eckersley, who was responsible for the little seen gem of tension  the Disappearance of Alice Creed, keeps the proceedings crisp and thrilling.
 Regrettably the unnecessary 3-D effects hamper the truly exceptional roaming cinematography of Anthony Dod Mantle, an Oscar winner for Slumdog Millionaire. I found the 3-D to be typically murky, the movie has a pale color scheme that does not lend itself well to the extra dimension,  and about half way in I just took the glasses off as it was giving me a migraine, fortunately my headache elevated and I was able to appreciate the excellent photography as it was. I don't think that this will be a problem on the DVD and Blu-ray releases, which is where I figure most people are likely to see this, for anyone seeing it in a cinema, I would suggest going the 2-D route.
 All coming together under an intense script from Alex Garland, who made this into a life fulfilling passion project. Garland allegedly clashed with director Pete Travis over the finished film, coming in behind him and finishing the venture himself. I only know one other movie by Travis, the undistinguished Vantage Point, but some of his other work has been better received. No matter, the behind the scenes tensions do not come across on the screen as things could not have looked better.
 Narrativley this is somewhat like the critically embraced Indonesian movie the Raid: Redemption, from earlier this year. This hard R-rated action movie left me felling fully pumped by the time of it's conclusion. Being released the last day of Summer, I'll be damned, but this may well be the kick a** movie of the year.

4792079,3,B005LAII7G,"In this dystopian Sci-Fi story all the action takes place in a high rise housing project. It's just like a present day housing project in that there is a lot of violence, but there are some key differences.

The biggest difference is that in this movie the racial roles are reversed. Real housing projects are almost all filled with black residents who kill one another frequently. In Dredd the initiators of the ultra violence are the whites and the black residents are just another set of victims. In the movie the police force seems to be all white except for the police chief who is a black woman.

Of course in the real world we don't build multi storied housing projects anymore, much less these super sky scrapers. All the oppressed, poor and miserable tenants of the huge buildings are completely integrated. No one pays any attention to any one's race. Racial harmony has triumphed although no one notes it. It is just taken for granted that race doesn't matter. There are black criminals but more white criminals and everyone gets along with everyone else swimmingly.

The message is - what? Are we supposed to admire the way we can dispose of crime and criminals if we just let the police do what ever they want? Are we supposed to take this as a cautionary tale about rising crime? Currently most violent crime in America is committed by blacks. Detroit today is if anything worse off than the mega-city depicted in this film. But in their version of the future there is no connection between race and crime.

It's not too clear what went wrong in the world of this movie. Everyone lives in a single city surrounded by empty desert. Why? Maybe this is explained in the comic books.

4792217,4,B005LAII7G,"I've been a fan of Judge Dredd since the early 80s, when I started reading 2000 AD. I thought the first Dredd movie was ruined the moment Stallone took off his helmet, because Dredd is really an impersonal force. In many respects, he means it when he says ""I am the LAW."" I understood why they had to show Stallone's face; after all, you're paying Stallone. So I completely respect Karl Urban's decision to keep the helmet on through the entire movie. The man's got serious nerd cred. He understood the character and the needs of the work, rather than going on ego. Moreover, you can tell it's Urban under the helmet. Those are some serious acting chops right there, and I don't think a lot of people recognize that about him.

The story is pretty good. It's really your typical MegaCity One kind of tale. The city isn't threatened with doom and destruction. It's just an average day for a Judge on the beat. There are 20 billion stories in the naked city, and this is one of them. I like that kind of vibe. And the plot itself is pretty good. Drug gang takes over a hab block and locks Judge Dredd and Anderson inside. It's a great way to isolate the main characters, so they can do what they're supposed to do. Shoot every criminal they see.

I really loved this movie, but there's a couple of things that make me give it only four stars. First, the violence was a little over the top. Skinning people, slo-mo bullets through the head, lingering shots on dead bodies -- it all seemed gratuitous. Judge Dredd was never about the ultra-violence. It didn't contribute to the film, and if the director was trying to make some kind of commentary on society then he failed. Robocop did a much better job of that. Second, Judge Dredd is ultimately supposed to be funny. It was a British take on American society during the Reagan-Thatcher years. It was over the top, with wry, sophisticated humor. Even the creators acknowledge that in the documentary. So it's sad that there's no sense of humor, no elan, to this movie.

4792218,5,B005LAII7G,"This movie was made outside the big budgets of holiday.  But it captures the universe of Dredd phenomenally.  This isn't a parody of a gritty and brutal world.  This is a gutsy rendering of a dark city where the police can only respond to about 6% of the violent or worse crimes.  The satire and irony of the original stories are there creating a perfect blend of humor against the cruel backdrop.  I've seen this about 30 times now and I am still impressed with how the favored the original material.  Unlike the farce version made in the 90's.  In 3-D this movie shines as well.  I haven't seen a better film that truly demos what your 3-D TV can do than this one.  Yet the whole movie isn't overly saturated with ""eye-popping"" 3-D moments.  When they step into a scene that really screams ""this should be in 3-D"" they execute flawlessly.  And when a normal cinematic perspective is more than adequate they don't choke you with in/out 3-D focusing of needless objects just because they could.

I've never read the Dredd comics or seen the Stallone flick; I've only played the Dredd pinball (pretty good machine). So I came into this film cold, and was definitely blown away, visually more than anything else. The ""Slow-Mo"" drug sequences are some of the most colorfully astonishing scenes I've ever witnessed in a film. The extras (40 minutes on the blu-ray including a nice bit on the killer visual effects) point out that these are due to a new kind of super slo-mo camera, and boy does it work. They also clearly added CGI to those shots, and the sparkling rainbow of colors is amazing.

I watched this on a big LED on blu-ray, and the image quality is near-perfect, some of the best I've ever seen. I can only imagine how intense it was in 3D Imax. Wow. But as blu-rays go, this is state of the art, up there with The Dark Knight and Up and Baraka for picture definition.

Yet movies do not live by effects alone, and it helps that Dredd tells a good story, however grim. The acting is solid, the script rough but wry, and all in all it's a real roller coaster ride, punctuated by those truly mind-blowing slo-mo scenes. If you like good sci-fi, this is an excellent dystopian futurist vision, though very violent, so be forewarned. Not for the squeamish.

It's clear the filmmakers are big fans of many sci-fi classics, as there are elements of and sly nods to memorable flicks like Escape From New York, Blade Runner, Matrix, Robocop, Road Warrior, Aliens, Total Recall and a host of others. If you like those films there will be plenty for you to enjoy here.

By the way, I look forward to seeing these new slo-mo cams used for nature films. Should be incredible.

PS The Slow-Mo drug slows thoughts by 100 times, which when you think about it is pretty incredible. I think anybody would end up taking that, right? Makes your life last that much longer, hard to resist. It made me think of that scene in Inception where the people are all hooked up together and sharing the dream world that's 12 times slower than life. Then of course each new level is 12 times slower, so four levels is 12 to the fourth power. Which is mighty slow! All of which leads me to wonder: what would be the ""perfect"" slow-down speed for a drug/biofeedback machine/etc?

I'd be interested to know what people think. As we enter the cyber age ever more fully, one can't help but think we're slowly leaving our bodies and letting our minds float free in the ether. Will slowing our brains down be the end goal of that? Seems to be the opposite right now, in any case.

4792451,4,B005LAII7G,"I had wanted to see this in theaters because I'd read in advance reviews that the 3D was pretty awesome but they pulled it after not even three weeks, which is really surprising seeing as ""Dredd"" is a pretty cool action film that will most likely gain a cult following.

The first thing this film does right is to wash away the bad taste of the earlier ""Judge Dredd"" film with Stallone in the lead. I like the Dredd character and I'm not really a diehard fan or anything but I knew while watching the Stallone film that showing Dredd without the helmet was a big mistake that probably doomed the film single-handedly, a mistake that this film wisely avoids. Karl Urban takes over the role for this installment and I have to say, he nails the character perfectly. Considering that this was a fairly low budget film, you wouldn't really think so when you take the production design and special effects into account. ""Dredd"" is very stylized and almost immediately, you're thrust into this post-apocalyptic world where citizens live in these huge, overpopulated cities where crime runs rampant and the dwindling number of authorities in the form of Judges act as judge, jury and executioner. The special effects are pretty impressive, especially whenever the film slows to a crawl as various characters partake in Slo-Mo, a drug that makes you experience things at 1/100th speed. It's in these scenes that I really get bummed out about not seeing the film theatrically in 3D because they are visually incredible and a sight to behold.

I think the fun in watching this movie is in not knowing how it's going to play out so I'll just say that while the plot is pretty simple, there is more than enough here to keep any action fan interested and Lena Headley (Queen Cersei from HBO's ""Game of Thrones"") is especially a joy to watch in this as the sadistic main villain, Ma Ma. You've probably heard that it's very similar to ""The Raid: Redemption"" and it is but to think that you should skip out on this film because you already saw ""The Raid: Redemption"" is to do yourself and ""Dredd"" a great disservice. They're similar in concept but different animals entirely.

The Blu-Ray presents the film in 3D but since I don't have a 3D TV, I wasn't able to watch the film in that format. In regular HD, the film looks fantastic and the surround sound is very active. The extras are standard stuff (vfx and production featurettes) with the best segment focusing on Dredd's long history in comics. A lot of comic industry people chime in on the character and you really get a sense of how influential the character was and how timeless he is. Again, I didn't see the 3D version on the disc so I apologize for not being able to give you the scoop on that but I'm sure it must look astounding.

I walked away from this film with a better appreciation for the character and a desire to see more. Dredd got shafted during its run in movie houses and it deserved a lot better of a reception than it got. I give this film a solid thumbs up and as a pulpy, ultra violent, retro action film, it works really well. Really hoping ""Dredd"" gets a sequel or two.",1361923200,3,3136,4.535335689045937

The plot is terribly simplistic - which, by itself might not be a bad thing if done properly, but unfortunately, it's not supported by any sort of human interest or clever perspectives.

The one good thing about the film, is Dredd's noble ""uphold-the-law-at-all-cost"" attitude, but such a theme can (and has been) wrapped in better, more entertaining packages (see 3:10 to Yuma with Christian Bale, for example).

I'd be willing to forgive the shallowness if, in return, we were given incredible action sequences, but there, the movie falls flat as well.  There isn't even a decent fist fight the entire time (for those of us who love watching choreography).  Nope - Dredd just walks around (stiffly, I might add), shooting people with his little gun.

At one point, some rouge judges are called in to take out Dredd.  He nonchalantly shoots them, without much trouble.  Then nonchalantly shoots the rest of the bad guys.  His partner, the ""rookie"" has psychic powers but that interesting characteristic is never developed.  They literally just walk around shooting.  The end. No high-flying hover-bike chases, no insane, death-defying leaps, no major explosions, no incredible martial arts ... nothing.  Just a little bit of uninspired gun-play.

Hollywood must think we're all a bunch of whores who have to accept whatever they shovel our way.

4792574,4,B005LAII7G,"Karl Urban, known for his role as omer in ""The Lord of the Rings"" saga, is Judge Dredd, the ultimate law enforcement officer of the dystopian society of Mega-City One. Directed by Pete Travis (""Vantage Point"") and written by Alex Garland (""28 Days Later...""), the new version is fast-paced, stylish and very violent. And it's very entertaining.

The simple story of ""Dredd"" about a veteran-/rookie-cop duo is told with a slight touch of Dirty Harry thrown in. Karl Urban's Judge Dredd has to team up with a recruit Cassandra Anderson (Olivia Thirlby) in order to evaluate her competence as a Judge. This is virtually her first job, but Dredd and Anderson, trapped inside a 200-storey building ruled by a ruthless drug lord called ""Ma-Ma"" (Lena Headey), have to fight for survival, surrounded by gun-toting thugs.

The premise may be a bit similar to that of ""The Raid: Redemption,"" but what is impressive about ""Dredd"" is its bloody gun fight scenes and stylized slow motion images. In fact, the sci-fi action is sort of a western set in futuristic post-apocalyptic America (actually shot in South Africa), and it works.

Karl Urban is spot on as Judge Dredd and he clearly knows what fans would expect from the character (this time Dredd does not remove his helmet). Based on the graphic novel series (which was once made into a film about 17 years ago starring Sylvester Stallone and ... Diane Lane and Max von Sydow!), the 2012 version ""Dredd"" is an entertaining movie with more fights and more action.",1361750400,,1505,4.848249027237354

It is much brighter and appealing than the trailer. Also, the story differs from the original's. The setting is similar, a crime-infested megalopolis isolated from a radioactive wasteland, and Judge Dredd is similar, though his uniform and bike are dingy compared to the original's gold and chrome. But the new movie offers a good deal more that is new, including an element of science-fiction ESP.

JUDGE DREDD's plot progressed with a background of political corruption. DREDD's action occurs mostly in one of the megalopolis's skyscrapers, reminiscent of something from Peter F. Hamilton. Maybe that indicates that some science fiction screenwriters are beginning to do their homework by indulging in SERIOUS science fiction, which you can do only by reading. Anyway, it allows for an element of suspense when the hero and heroine become trapped in one of those gigantic buildings.

The three main characters are done very well. It was good to see Lena Headey. She was fine as the heroine in the TV series TERMINATOR - THE SARAH CONNOR CHRONICLES, and as a villainess in DREDD, she is superb. Though I won't say that the new actor for Dredd was better than Mr. Stallone, he was perfectly adequate (Karl Urban, familiar as Dr. McCoy in the new STAR TREK movies).

He's not an irritating one-liner quip machine. He doesn't play jokes on or give the rookie a hard time; he's tough but fair to her. He doesn't have time or patience for the sob stories of the perps he sentences to die. Ma-Ma is an ex-prostitute junkie sliced up by her pimp and forced to sell drugs because of a life of poverty. Dredd. Does. Not. Care. His job is to uphold the law. That's actually refreshing. This movie is basically about a day on the job with Judge Dredd in a dystopian overcrowded future city as he methodically carries out his duties. Dredd and rookie Anderson are trapped in a housing project after investigating a triple homicide. Every gang member in the building is ordered to kill them.

Rookie judge Cassandra Anderson is given a second chance at becoming a judge through an in-the-field evaluation. Who better than the Dredd. Their first mission out and things turn horribly south.

I especially appreciated how the bad guys made (for the most part) sensible decisions instead of cliche moves and lines.

4792837,5,B005LAII7G,"I'm going to start ""There"" so get over it.

Sylvester Stallone made an excellent Judge Dredd -For the first maybe, ten minutes he was on screen.  He was large, imposing and although his appearance was a little comical (as in over the top) it was okay.  Judge Dredd is a comic and is also dressed kind of funny.  But after he sentences Rob Schneider to prison, the movie quickly nose dives brought up only by Armand Assante's 'Rico.'  Who I loved to watch.  That was as good as that movie got.

Dredd with Karl Urban in the titular role is miles ahead better than the Stallone version.  It's violent, Dredd is a violent comic.  Over the top.  Again, the comic is at times.  And awesome, again, the comic...

This version of Dredd takes a different approach to this type of movie, where the earlier film version took Dredd and put him in a larger universe, quest, where he was out to save the world (Mega-City One) this version locks him in a building with a recruit and basically throws only one scenario at him, where if anything it's just a fight to survive, or to reach the bad guy and eliminate one threat whose disaperance isn't likely to change the world all that much.

This version was more compelling, more interesting, and without Rob Schneider more tasteful.  This movie deserves a sequel, Karl Urban needs to make more money.  If I was a billionaire I would fund three more of these movies.",1361318400,,1401,4.503968253968254
4792838,5,B005LAII7G,"I am not a comic book fan in the least and usually avoid superhero movies as they aren't my thing in the least, but I found myself really enjoying this film. I really like films that push the envelope for what is acceptable and tolerable by the audience and this one definitely delivers in the violence department.

The acting was well done and it seems that the cast did the best possible job for such a flat storyline. I'm not sure what else they could have done as I don't know much about the Dredd universe but a little more character development would have been welcomed.

 As I watched the movie I kept having the feeling that the director was a Gasper Nior fan as you weren't just along for the ride as the violence happened but also the result of the violence which can make some people...like myself...squirm in their seat a little. I wouldn't have bat an eyelash if this film had come over from France or another European country with more progressive cinema but the fact that this is an American action/hero film that doesn't try to make itself a 'family event' and placate the masses should be commended.",1361232000,,1116,4.514851485148514

Mega City one is a dismal place, Dredd never takes off his helmet, Olivia Thirlby is great as Judge Anderson who has the worst first day on the job ever, and Lena Helmsley, who should just get the Queen Bitch award for this and Game of Thrones, is excellent as Ma-Ma. I really wish this would have made a ton of money, because I'd like to see a sequel. Karl Urban is tremendous as Dredd, without being over the top at all.",1361232000,2,520,4.158415841584159
4792931,5,B005LAII7G,"I watch a lot of movies, and not without discrimination, though I did take a chance on Dredd - I did not know what to expect, and hoped it would not suck. Note: not that it would be good, just that it would not suck, because a lot of this brand of fare does tend to. I have also never written a review - EVER - but for Dredd, I will try. I will, because Dredd, actually, is great, and this effort went sadly under the radar in 2012, while a lot of other maligned schlok got rather undeserved attention.

Yes, there are some plot similarities with The Raid, however I do not see this as a deterrent to enjoy Dredd. It has vibe to boot, the dystopian future of Megacity One sets a pitch-perfect backdrop, aided wonderfully by a subdued synth heavy horrorscape score; Karl Urban's enactment of the relentless, one-man army Judge is about as dead on as you can get, perma-scowl and all, Olivia Thirlby does a great turn as psychic rookie Judge Anderson, and Lena Headey delivers quite the vile performance as the merciless drug queen Ma-Ma.

The editing and pacing are taught, the special effects are not overbearing and serve the story, and on the right screen look rather beautiful and mesmerizing; the action and tension build, and overall make for a very entertaining offering.

In this day and age of sequels, I can only wish that the crew did an even darker follow up, and let Geoff Barrow score it.",1361232000,4,1401,4.46484375

This version is more like the source material, has a story that makes sense, good actors, and some of the best action that I have seen in quite a while.  I rented this movie on Amazon instant video and I watched the movie three times in 24 hours!  Yes, it was that good.

4792937,5,B005LAII7G,"I have been a Judge Dredd fan for a long time now and this movie does the character justice. The film has captured the dangerous and crazy look and feel of the comics in so many ways from the characters that it portrays such as the Mama clan, to the giant Mega City block towers, right down to the Judges uniforms, guns etc. They tweaked some things here and there, especially with the Lawmaster bikes that the Judges ride on, but that is understandable. And the story, while maybe not the most involving plot that you have ever seen, was still decent enough for what it does, which is to show you an average day on the streets of Mega City 1 for a Judge.

The movie also introduces a well-known and favorite character of mine from the comic books, Judge Anderson, the psychic sidekick who over the years has helped Judge Dredd to solve many tough cases within the city. In this movie we see her on her very first day of duty as she is being trained by Judge Dredd to see if she has what it takes to become a Judge. She does.

This movie was so action-packed and riveting that it literally had me on the edge of my seat the first time that I viewed it at the theater. It really made you feel what life would be like to live in such a dystopic society. Something that I would not enjoy very much I'll tell you that. This is a bleak, dreary, and oppressive world where life is tough and unemployment and the crime rate is through the roof. The Judges can only do so much to try and keep law and order in this huge overcrowded city. And Judge Dredd is the best of them.

I am glad to see that this movie is making waves on the home video circuit because it tanked pretty badly at the box office. I hope that it's success continues to grow and that maybe if we are lucky we can get a sequel to it made in the not-too-distant future. There are many more interesting characters from the comics just waiting to make an appearance on the big screen, some that would make for very interesting villains in a future release. I am referring of course to the well-known Dark Judges, Mortis, Fire, Fear, and Death. These ghastly supernatural beings from another dimension are just dying to be seen on the big screen.",1361145600,2,2202,4.275779376498801

And as a lot of others mentioned it is an entertaining action movie.  It's not like the original Stallone movie at all, but goes on it's own story line. I wish they had gone into more of Dredd's background, but I guess it would be reserved for a sequel, which unfortunately I don't think will happen.

I just wish this movie gave a little more background on how Dredd became the way he is. It is too bad this movie was a flop because maybe a sequel could've gone more in depth with his character.

After hearing the beginnings of this movie's cult followings I was amazed by nearly every aspect of the film. Urban does a great, deadpan performace never removing his helmet while the female lead was our view into the harsh world of 2100 A.D while not being weak and powerless (instead using her abilities in creative ways to elicit results). Surprisingly good, little cons, overall a keeper and a fun film.",1360972800,2,720,4.76
4793203,1,B005LAII7G,"First off, I just want to say that this is not a review of the movie, but instead a comment on the Blu-ray disk itself.

As a European customer, I've bought a lot of Blu-ray movies from Amazon in the US, either to take advantage of extra features unavailable on editions sold here, or simply better pricing.

I've also bought DVDs, and have been warned by Amazon when a disk is region-encoded and might not play on machines on my side of the, ah, pond. I accept that as a customer service advisory and make my decision accordingly.

There are no such warnings (yet) when it comes to Blu-ray, so i was surprised that my copy of Dredd (excellent movie, by the way) wouldn't play on my PS3. Further investigation showed that it was, indeed, Region-locked,

I checked a number of my more recent purchases (under a magnifying glass, it must be said) to see whether there was any indication of regional encoding, but found no evidence of any, so I figure this must be a new development in Blu-ray technology.

That being the case, and being conscious that I can't be the only European customer of Amazon.com (or.ca, for that matter), may I respectfully suggest that Amazon adopts a policy similar to that surrounding DVDs, and provides a more visible warning about playabilty outside the US and Canada?

First, I was worried that it would be all exactly the same as with Judge Dredd from 1995, but the movie proved me wrong. It has nothing to do with the 1995 movie except for judges, and Dredd himself. The movie could go both ways: like it did with Dredd as main character, again or with another character by another name. Anyways I loved the main characters and rookie was quite awesome as well. That said, I've seen ''the Raid'' and I don't really care if they took ''fighting in the locked building'' from that movie. I didn't like the Raid for its violence and sadism. I think the movie could be so much better if we had a bigger world to explore, but none the less I enjoyed the movie so much. What I disliked in the movie is slow-motion. It wasn't used too much, or all the time, but it got me bored with it, even though I could see all of the details. As my title for the review says, I would love to see a trilogy for Dredd!

While Stallone did well in his portrayal of Dredd ""back in the day,"" Urban did a terrific job in that portrayal.

What really gets on my nerve is the character Ma-Ma, as played by Lena Headey. She managed to take up a residence in my horrendous nightmares with her Slo-Mo drugs and ruthless, conscienceless acts. Such a scary woman, no doubt. However, to counteract that aspect, a cute Judge Anderson (embodied by Olivia Thirlby) - a psychic who feels the thoughts and emotions of others and using those abilities to save her and Dredd from any immediate danger.

If you are iffy on 3D, this is a good way to acquire a 3DBD at a 2D price. It does play in 2D on 2D equipment. If you have 3D equipment, you can play it in either 2D or 3D.

A bad batch of disks was pinpointed primarily to Best Buy stores. Here is a comment from them: ""I have received a final update from our business team as well as the vendor, and I wanted to make sure to pass this on to all of you.

After all of their research, they have been able to isolate this problem to a specific number of copies of this movie.

They can be reached at 1-877-230-2756 or by emailing lionsgateshop@orderassistance.com.""

I purchased mine from Amazon and it plays just fine on my PS3 slim and Sony BDP S570. Some have mentioned a grainy overlay in some scenes. I haven't experienced that. It is pristine in both 2D and 3D on my equipment.

The highlights of this release are the slo-mo scenes filmed at 3000 fps on Red Cameras; (They are absolutely spectacular in 3D)and the DTS HD MA 7.1 neo-x audio. It will sound just fine on a 5.1, 7.1 or an 11.1 surround system. There is a sound test in the extras that uses excerpts from the audio track to demonstrate the height and wide effects matrixed into the audio. On my 7.1 system, when the height and wide speakers are demonstrated (which I don't have)the audio is directed to the front and center speakers to excellent effect. As far as I know, the only other Blu-ray released with Neo-x is Expendables 2.

If you like live action movies based on comics, you will enjoy this. Amazing job by Urban as Dredd, who has to act with 3/4 of his face covered by a helmet for the entire movie.

Olivia Thirlby plays his psychic rookie Anderson, on her evaluation day.  And Lena Hedley plays a convincing, if somewhat over the top, gang boss.
The film does a good job of explaining Anderson's past, and throughout her first day she has some good character development moments such as her first execution.  CG is good, and the movie starts out with several very graphically violent scenes to remind you that this isn't a fun place to live.

4793558,3,B005LAII7G,"Spoilers in this review:
Liked:
(1) Good acting.
(2) Mentor/protege relationship between Dredd and Anderson.
(3) Production design was believable as a dark, slumlike dwelling.
Disliked:
(1) Excessive blood splatter in slow motion.  If you like films where characters are shot in the face and stomach in slow motion, and murder victims shown with bits of brain and gore everywhere, this film shows that.
(2) Film is a 24 hour day in the work life of Dredd - we learn nothing about Dredd other than he is competent at his job, which we learn in the first few minutes of meeting him.  He hints that the job is difficult (in meeting with his boss), but the story itself never shows him having difficulty with it.  No character arc, no reason for audience to attach to him, audience can respect him for doing his job conscientiously, but except for the fact that he is determined to do his job as well as he can, which we learn in his first confrontation with the first junkies, Dredd's work throughout the story is a variation on his insistence of high quality law enforcement, but we don't see his effort (probably in part because the mask covers his face).  Even getting shot he uses to teach his rookie how to apply a basic field dressing.  A character outstanding at his job isn't enough for an audience to attach to him; the audience needs more information, but the filmmakers basically had him saying he is the law, and apparently felt that was enough.  That may be enough for fanboys, but for audiences unfamiliar with the character, there was insufficient information to understand Dredd.  For example, why was he so dedicated?  I needed to know more about him as a character to better sympathize with him.
(3) Anderson is introduced as a psychic, yet she fails to anticipate being kidnapped, being shot, and also that Dredd would accept her as a Judge.  If the storytellers wanted her to be seen as partially psychic, they should have mentioned the limits of her powers before those limits were shown in the story.  Should we trust her word as truth or shouldn't we - she is used inconsistently.
(4) Poorly realized master villan.  Ma Ma was given as the top villan in the story, yet we are first introduced to her as she is getting high.  It's hard to believe that a junkie could successfully run a drug empire because a junkie is not in control of herself while she is high, therefore during those times, her lieutenants and/or her competitors could easily kill her and steal her business from her.  Also, she makes the mistake of killing other junkies in the beginning of the story, and displaying their bodies in such a way that causes their deaths to be reported to the authorities, thereby bringing the Judges to the building; a very bad decision.  Yes she has corrupt Judges on her payroll (and who knows how far up the corruption goes in this story), but why bring unnecessary attention to her empire - very poor judgement for a master villan.  In addition, after she made the call to kill the junkies, and the Judges come and capture her second lieutenant, and he, by cunning, manages to escape, and capture a Judge in training at the same time, Ma Ma slaps and berates him and tells him the whole debacle is his fault, when in fact, it is her fault, and based entirely on her own decisions.  In other words, Ma Ma is a chief villan in name only, and nowhere in the story does she demonstrate competent, not to mention  exceptional, villan skills.  In a story where it is an automatic death sentence to attempt to kill a Judge, it's not bright for a character to place a hit on Judges with thousands of people as witnesses to it, over a loudspeaker.  A more effective strategy would have been to kill her second lieutenant before he left the building.  Doing that would have avoided having a direct confrontation with Dredd, and would have solved Ma Ma's problem of stopping her lieutenant from spilling his guts under interrogation, which was her principle goal.  It does not help a story to have a stupid top villan, it doesn't make the hero seem more heroic, it just makes the story seem dumb.  Also, it doesn't help a story to introduce a character representing them as top villan, and the story giving no example of them being top anything.  For example, Anderson was introduced as a psychic - though her psychic abilities were not on display throughout the story, there were some points in the story where they were demonstrated, so the audience saw that she was introduced as a psychic, and the story shows her to be a psychic.  In the case of Ma Ma, Ma Ma is introduced as the top villan, but the story itself provides no opportunities to display her superior villan skills.  Ma Ma was cruel and sadistic, but many film criminals are cruel and sadistic, it takes more than that to be a believable and competent master film criminal.  In a world where the State has technical and warfare superiority, intelligence is a minimum requirement for a believable film villan.  Villany, in my opinion, is hi-risk and hi-stress, it seems a very difficult career choice, and dumb villans would find themselves post haste imprisoned or worse.  In Dredd, Ma Ma should have been presented at the top of her game.  Then more tension could have been added to the story by having the audience worry if Dredd and Anderson would make it out alive.  The way Ma Ma is written, she poses no threat to Dredd in my opinion, and it is no surprise that he and Anderson not only escape, but complete their job of taking out her gang.
(5) Music.  Just didn't like it as it was mostly used to punch up the violence, which I didn't like either.
(6) Not believable that paramedic would have refused to allow Judges to shelter at the Medic Center.  Police officers, firefighters, paramedics, all first responders, in my opinion, share a camraderie (sp?).  I found it totally unbelievable that the onsite paramedic would not have allowed the Judges to enter the Medic Center once the Judges were under attack - 100% unbelievable.
(7) Anderson's capture - I thought Dredd had the shot and could have stunned Anderson and her kidnapper.  Ma Ma's lieutenant, Kay (I think was his name), had his arms around Anderson and the gun, but from what I saw the gun was not pointed at Anderson, and I thought Dredd had a shot, and could have stunned them.  This is a film of course, and it's easy to armchair quarterback, and thank god I've never been in a gun battle, but I looked at the film many, many, many times and I thought Dredd could have stunned Kay and Anderson and thereby prevented her kidnapping.
(8) World in which Dredd takes place is said to be future America, where nearly a billion people are squeezed into about 1/4 of the present country.  No information given as to how a billion people are fed and watered, if the rest of the country is a wasteland. Where does their energy come from? Their clothes?  Nobody looked as though they were starving - a poor beggar asks for drugs, not for food.
(9) Disliked that Ma Ma was thrown out of a window by a man twice her weight to her death.  The storytellers protected this part of the story, showing why they had Dredd throw her from the window - but I am a woman, and I took absolutely no pleasure in seeing a man throw a woman by her neck out of a window.  Tinge of mysogeny (sp?) there from the storytellers, in my opinion, mostly shown by how much the filmmakers protected that image in the story.  To that same point, hated the mental rape scene Kay subjected Anderson to.  She was a police officer, disgusting that she was shown being raped.  Is this what the filmmakers think their male target audience wants, hyper violence and rape?
(10) Black people in the drug business.  I am African-American and am so tired of seeing African-Americans as top people in the drug trade.  Here's my opinion, though I cannot prove it - despite the tens of millions of dollars, if not billions of dollars our country spends on drug prevention, drugs are apparently as easy to obtain in most large American cities as milk at the local grocery store (no direct experience, opinion based on what I read).  If that is the case, there is corruption somewhere in our system.  I am sorry to report, as a middle age African American woman, I have yet to see in my own personal life powerful African American men - there is the president, but I do not know him.  To get drugs into this country, despite the laws and deterrents, someone is being paid and someone is granting access, people with power.  There are no doubt lots of independent operators, but in reading the newspaper/articles over the years, drugs are so prevalent that major drug routes must be open into the country for the drugs to flow apparently so freely, and drugs like meth and pot (sometimes planted in national parks), are homegrown, which I read about in newspapers when police make large busts.  And yet in drug themed film stories, you see African American men wheeling and dealing, but the men with power in this country are Caucasian, and you don't see representations in large enough amounts of those men at the highest levels in drug themed films.  I do not say that some African American men are not involved in the drug trade; I only say that they are, in my opinion, minor players - though minor players are bad too.  Nor do I mean to imply that a majority of American Caucasian men are involved in the illegal drug trade, that would obviously be untrue, as most Americans of all ethnicities are hardworking and law abiding.  I do believe though that despite advances in the country for minorities and women, the real power brokers in this country are still primarily men, Caucasian men.  Nothing against Caucasian men, who I count among my ancestors, as well as Africans, but apparently some have so much power that even film stories don't show the dirty deeds of some of the law breakers who happen to be Caucasian, in the proportion to which I suspect they play a part.  I'm not racist or sexist against Caucasian men (my ancestors after all, in part, make me who I am), but I do believe that power in this country, real power, belongs, still, predominantly to Caucasian men, though admittedly not the average working class or middle class person.  I'm not speaking of ordinary people when I talk of drug lords, and I don't know enough about drug lords to recognize one if I saw him or her, because, in my opinion, if they are successful in an illegal business, they would by necessity keep their business on the down low, as out of sight as possible.  So you see how unbelievable Ma Ma's appears in comparison, when she orders the Judges murdered over a loud speaker in the slum building where she lives.  That would be much too blatant for a successful drug lord, even one with Judges in their pocket.  How interesting it would have been then if the film had showed how far up the corruption in the Judge's Department went, how much more interesting to show a character with real power, more likely to be Caucasian and male, instead of the dumb villans shown in this cartoon.  The story would have been alot more believable and frightening.  As the filmmakers decided on a female villan, she needed to be smart and successful in her business, and that intelligence and success needed to be the story displayed for the audience; it's not something to be told the audience as the paramedic fills the Judges in about drug violence in the complex, but it needed to be part of the story, as much as Dredd taking out bad guys was the story.  Ma Ma ended up killing thousands of innocent citizens living in the building in her attempt to kill the Judges.  That was villanous behavior, but it occurred out of her interaction with the Judges.  Before that mass murder, the story needed to establish Ma Ma as brilliant, cool under fire, ruthless and utterly egotistical businesswoman, at the top of her game.  She was ruthless and egotistical, but unintelligent - no match for Dredd.  But this was a mistake by the writer, for she needed to be so villanous that the audience would wonder how Dredd could take her out.  The Judges are trained in urban warfare; Ma Ma, despite the violence surrounding her, ran a business.  Fighting Dredd was not playing to her strengths (of which I saw none), she is a capitalist who uses violence to maintain her business - her business is not the art of war.  Her men, though willing to do her bidding, are untrained and obviously unprepared to fight against a seasoned Judge and his rookie.  Nor did Ma Ma have a strategic mind.  It is the villan who sets the bar in a film story; the tougher and more dangerous the villan, the greater the hero's success is celebrated by the audience if the hero succeeds.  Remember the jubilation felt when Luke destroyed the death star in Star Wars IV - the audience was so pleased because the empire pushed all the right buttons as a villan; they were successful, better armed, ruthless, utterly selfish, Vader was nearly psychic with his use of the force.  The villan needs to be seen by the audience as a force to be reckoned with, for the audience to celebrate the hero's success we need an impressive villan.  A drug addict is not an impressive villan.  The villan needs to be bad to the bone, not afraid, as Ma Ma looked after she saw Dredd had survived her most determined assault.  The audience needs to be alittle afraid of the villan; the villany so excessive that even the audience, safe in their seats or on their couch at home, can't think how the hero is going to escape the threat the villan represents.  A well written villan is essential for the audience's enjoyment in a hero/villan story - a strong hero alone is insufficient to make a film story work properly, the villan is, in my opinion, even more necessary for the audience.  Part of the villan's job is to help the audience invest emotionally in the story, by hoping the hero is able to stop the villan's handiwork, whose work needs to be portrayed as anti-social as possible.  But it's not just the quantity of people she murders, she must be intelligent and behave in a way that represents a threat to the audience.  A dumb villan is not a threat, and so does not do her job in Dredd, not because of the actress, but because of how her character was written, what she was given to do, how and why she is destructive.  For example, again in Star Wars, the empire destroyed Princess Leia's home planet, just to gain street crede; in other words to prove to their competitors that they would kill billions of forms of life to get their way.  As the audience itself lives on a planet, the empire's action and why they acted, showed the audience that the empire was indeed a threat, and needed to be taken out.  When Luke managed to do so, the audience celebrates with him.  Another example of a great film villan is in Jaws; how dull that film would've been without the scary, aggressive, shark.  In Dredd, there is no believable villan, no shark.  Hard then to worry for the safety of Dredd and Anderson, who are trained warriors.  Even Anderson, who doesn't meet the standards of a Judge (the film shows that is because she is a defensive thinker, instead of an offensive one), manages to escape from Ma Ma's gang.  Also, Dredd wasn't structured properly, and so when Ma Ma was killed, though she clearly earned her death by her behavior, I was distanced enough from the film emotionally that I disliked how Dredd flung her out of the plate glass window.  What that means, is that the filmmakers were unable to properly attach me emotionally to their story for the reasons I've mentioned.
(11) Secondary criminals - none of the secondary criminals, from the first junkies Dredd takes out, to the first gang members that answer Ma Ma's call to action, behave as if they exist in a world of Judges.  In Dredd, Judges exercise immediate life and death sentences, and yet the characters don't act accordingly.  For instance, how much more believable if the story had had one of the first junkies surrender to Dredd when he is offered life.  As an audience member, it seems to me I reacted more believably to the reality of the Judge's power than the characters did as I verbally admonished them on what to or not to do, none of the advice the criminals took (I guess they didn't hear me).  It makes a story more believable when characters act like they are in the same reality together - after all the audience assumes the characters want to live, though the characters gave no evidence of desiring that.  The story is not believable when the characters do not act as if they want to live.
(12) Kay didn't know Judge's gun worked for individual Judge only.  Unbelievable that Kay wouldn't have known this.  He himself says he's known many Judges; corrupt Judges are on Ma Ma's payroll, no reason they wouldn't share this information. In his experience as a criminal in Dredd, Kay would know that a Judge's weapon was useful only to the Judge.  Totally unbelievable Kay would know not to use Anderson's gun.  And of course, not believable that Kay is alone when he attempts to kill Anderson.  Surrounded by gang members, why would he be alone in a room with her?
(13) No eye candy.  Production design is bleak as the building is a slum.  Pretty protege for the guys, but no eye candy for women.  Unpleasant to be stuck in a slum with gangs and shoot 'em ups, blood and gore for most the entire story.  I understand Dredd doesn't take off his helmet but then no male beauty for women to look at, just a chin which is not enough.  No male beauty, no nature beauty, a real slogg visually unless you enjoy seeing how many ways characters can be killed.  Not fun.
(14) Seemed almost a police officer propaganda film, showed hero police officers in a very flattering light - very careful to show Dredd firing only when he was fired upon and that he immediately lowered his weapon when criminals lowered theirs.  Showed honest officers as highly competent, professional and just about everything a future like that shown in Dredd would want officers with power of immediate life and death to be.  Romanticized policing, e.g., pretty girl calling Dredd sir, tons of war toys to play with. Propaganda, but hey we need good officers, and if this might attract young people, I'm not mad at the filmmakers for propaganda.  Obviously untrue of real policing, very romanticized, but I liked seeing a police officer provide the appropriate force necessary for a specific scenario.
(15) Convenient that the skateboard deck located just so, when the Judge's were under the most intense attack; otherwise they would have tumbled who knows how many floors to their deaths.  If the skateboard deck was going to save Judges, needed it louder in the story, needed Judge's to know it's there, and not just have it there by luck.
There are probably more story weak spots I cannot remember.  Basically, having no knowledge of Dredd, I approached the story on it's own merit (having read positive reviews), and found it to be pedestrian and not as well told as I'd like.  Hopefully they will try again and do better.  I give the movie 3 stars because the actors are competent and production design made me believe it was a slum, and also a star for effort for the film makers.  As I said, it would have been a much stronger story if the main villan had been better written.  The actress did what she could with it, giving her character a creepy, depressed feel, but her part needed to be much more intelligently written and she needed to be much more frightening.

The ""Slow-Mo"" shots are beautiful and incredibly graphic at the same time, making the 3D experience just incredible! Although there are a few shots that pander to the 3D, it is not something you see throughout the whole movie, and other shots that aren't pandering, still look good as well. I would highly recommend this movie for anyone wanting a good action flick and ESPECIALLY to anyone wanting to add on to their 3D collection!",1360540800,3,588,4.8316831683168315
4793560,5,B005LAII7G,"This simply must do well on DVD and Blu-ray to get the sequels it so richly deserves, because what happened in the theatres is an absolute crime, especially when you consider what terrible/crap movies like Michael Bay's disgracefully bad (not to mention hideous and totally inaccurate) ""Transformers"" or should I say ""Giant New Zealand Tattoo shaped monsters movie"" took at the box office!!! ... It just boggles the mind????????

This movie is so damn good, especially when the low budget for it is taken into consideration, that I have bought both the standard DVD and Blu-ray versions of it just to do my bit to put towards the more than deserved sequels.
There's no point me going on about the story in this review to you because you can read up about that on Amazon's synopsis, or via most other people's reviews on here - but - if you're looking for an absolute ""Barnstormer"" of an action movie to add to your collection, then look no further than this masterful production because it's a real hardcore a**-kicker that's surely destined to become a cult classic.
Action packed, gritty, and most importantly, true to the comics with regards to Dredd's character. Dredd is like Eastwood in the future (an uncompromising - law enforcing butt kicker) he was pretty much based on Dirty Harry, and this movie gets that aspect completely right (unlike the appalling Stallone version!) Robocop was based on Dredd, the influence is clear in those movies, even down to the use of classic stereotypical Dredd words like ""Creep!"" And to all you misinformed people who think that Dredd copied ""The Raid"" ... think again, because Dredd's post production dates way back to 2006, development was announced in 2008 and 3D filming began in 2010. Dredd's script was leaked a few years ago. ""The Raid"" was in post production in 2011, and was released very quickly after news of Dredd's release was finally on the cards! So, you can draw your own conclusions but it's pretty obvious what actually happened here!
This is without a doubt, the best movie that I have seen in years (and I have seen plenty in my 30 + years on this earth) it's even got that good old 80's feel to it, especially with the music (Paul Leonard-Morgan did a superb job with his score!) I just simply can't recommend this movie highly enough to you!! Brilliant story, brilliant cast, brilliant soundtrack, brilliant movie (even if you just like action packed movies) then this is a ""MUST/ESSENTIAL"" purchase for you!!!",1360540800,4,2475,4.809859154929577

This movie is just like a roller coaster. Just pure non-stop action from start to finish and you never want it to end. Yes people, it is ultra-violent as its rated R. You should know that going into this. If you can't handle these kind of movies, just stay away and go watch The Little Mermaid or Twilight for yourself and don't come here complaining about its rating and violence. Its just a movie get over yourselves.

The 3D here is pretty good, I would put in on par with The Amazing Spider-Man's if you have seen that movie. Its average for most of the movie but during the slo-mo scenes its actually pretty good. The DTS-HD Master audio here though is fantastic, and the movies soundtrack is beyond fantastic. It definitely will give your home theater system a workout and sounds great doing so.

Dredd is back and much grimmer than when Sly played him in an earlier version of Judge Dredd. The humor is gone as this movie settles into a dark and foreboding future of a world mostly wasted beyond ruin and a concentrated mass of humanity in what are known as mega cities (800 million people and 17,000 crimes per day). But don't worry for the judges are here to run things playing judge, jury and executioner and being allowed to kill people on site for violating various laws.

Tale opens with Judge Dredd (played by Karl Urban) being given the task of training a rookie with psychic powers named Anderson (played by Olivia Thirlby) who failed her exam to become a judge. She gets one more chance training under judge.

And thus do they come to investigating a drug den in a highrise. Guess what? Not surprisingly it's worse than they thought and the villains seal them in and try to wipe them out. Minor spoiler but I'm adding some details so that it might sound enticing enough to watch.

Judge Dredd creator John Wagner, who had been critical of the 1995 adaptation, gave a positive review of Dredd. He said: ""I liked the movie. It was, unlike the first film, a true representation of Judge Dredd ... Karl Urban was a fine Dredd and I'd be more than happy to see him in the follow-up. Olivia Thirlby excelled as Anderson ... The character and storyline are pure Dredd."" (Wiki)

Screenwriter Alex Garland started working on the script in 2006.

The budget for this film was $45M and it made just a bit over $36M at the Box Office. Quite a disappointment from what some were expecting. However, it did well with home media and because it pushed over $50M gross a trilogy is in the works or so Garland claimed.

It takes the Judge Dredd movie made earlier and makes it look like a kid's movie.  The quality of the two doesn't even compare.  Dredd is a masterpiece of a movie IMO and will become what I like to say, ""a comfort food video"" because you can watch it over and over - if you have the taste for it.

When it comes to landing the niche position in box offices, this could easily become a cult classic - or even better a series like other comic book movies - as THE most accurate portrayal of future crime available.  If there's no sequel, I'll be happy watching this DVD and buying a new 3D TV just to do so.  There are small details in this movie that scream quality!  I think the major problem in this movie taking a box office dive was the promotion.  If I would've known it was as good as it is, I would've went to it TWICE in theatres.

So, down to the movie itself.  I think we all know who Dredd is about and what he does.  The best part about the movie are the nuances, the details, the vision and the quality they achieved in making it lifelike.  I could totally see everything in this movie happening in the future with no doubts.  At no time, did I say, ""that wouldn't happen or it couldn't.""  I was captivated at the realism portrayed and the sheer brutality of the criminals Dredd takes down.  Also, needless to say, the graphics and Slow-Mo sequences were absolutely breathtaking.  I didn't expect this movie to make me a cult member of the Dreddies.  I've drank the juice now though...

Here's a good example, from a bioengineer's point of view - the guy who makes medical products - I can already tell you that the Slow-Mo drug portrayed in this movie is spot on when it comes to future drug delivery trends.  It's one of many little ingenious details in this movie.

So, I'll top it off with this: BUY THIS MOVIE TO SUPPORT THE MAKING OF A SEQUEL!  Because Dredd deserves to have a 2, 3, 4, and even 5 if they are the quality of this movie, and I'll make the commitment to buy them too when they come out.",1359936000,3,2406,4.198689956331878

First..Karl Urban.  He tried to copy Sly's frown and it came across weird.  I mean, I know he's Dredd but something about that frown with the pooched lower lip was off to me.  He would have done better to have a normal expression rather than copy Sly, who has a funny sort of mouth to begin with.  It works for Sly but didn't work for Urban.  Second thing was the name ""Maw-Maw"".  When the name was said during the movie, not so smooth..just something a little off about it.  Other than those two very small things, the movie is good and if you liked Dredd in the 90's, I think you'll like and enjoy this too.",1359936000,,784,4.236486486486487

Dredd contains a perfect balance of action and people talking(some would call this dialog). simply put the main judges were mysterious to the end and I didn't hate them ever. The movie also pushes the SciFi genre by adding gadgets and powers shown in a new way. Robocop's gun is no longer my dream gun.

A sequel would be nice if this time around it isn't hidden behind a crappy trailer. 9/10 stars because the beginning of the movie was a bit slow . Plot left me more satisfied than the raid did. Watch Dredd.",1359849600,,639,4.361344537815126
4794248,5,B005LAII7G,"I'll admit I've never read the Judge Dredd comics, though I did see the Stallone movie.  I enjoyed both, but I prefer Dredd--a much grittier, more violent story.

Mega-City One is a sprawling metropolis that stretches from what was New York to Baltimore.  Mixed in with the buildings and 'high-rises' that might be seen in any contemporary cities are the mega-structures that dwarf the buildings around them; small cities in themselves.  The technology is 'near future' rather than distant, and the cities are all concrete and motor oil; much harsher than the sleek, futuristic scape in the Stallone movie and more appropriate for the postapocolyptic theme, I think.  Mega-City One, and the Peach-Tree mega-structure that is the setting for the bulk of the movie, have a realistic atmosphere that sets the tone for story.

The story itself follows Judge Dredd and rookie Judge Anderson, who is being assessed by Dredd in a sink-or-swim manner.  When they decide to investigate a triple murder at Peach Tree, they inadvertently find themselves at war with drug queenpin 'Mama'.  In a move rimiscent of ""Die Hard"", they are locked into the Peach Tree complex along with Mama, the bulk of her (very violent) gang, and the thousands of innocent civilians who live in the massive mega-structure.

The cinematography was masterful; it reminded me of older classics like Blade Runner.  As neat as CGI can be, so many movies over-use it these days.  Dredd doesn't.  The fighting is realistic and the world is harsh.  This is NOT a movie for kids; it is brutal and graphic.  But mixed in with the brutality are breathtaking slow-motion scenes.  The drug Mama sells is 'Slow-mo' and it does exactly what it sounds like--makes everything seem slow.  Unlike so many movies that introduce slow-motion scences to highlight the dance-fighting and action sequences, Dredd utilizes slow motion to give the viewer a sense of the drug.  These scenes highlight the beauty in the mundane--water or glass or even blood, sparkling in the air, for example.  The moments of beauty contrast sharply with the world of Dredd, which is ugly.

The acting is well done, too.  I admit, I decided to watch the movie because I'm a big Karl Urban fan.  His Dredd is gruff and enigmatic; there are fleeting moments of humor, but he remains poker-faced behind his helmet (although I was disapointed that we didn't get to see his baby-blues).  Lena Headey, who plays Mama, is a chilling villain; the picture of ruined beauty turned to psychopathy.  And Olivia Thirlby manages to bring a bit of innocence to her role as the idealistic and inexperienced Anderson while still being strong.

Overall, Dredd is a great movie I highly recommend.",1359849600,4,2701,4.9511111111111115

4794251,2,B005LAII7G,"I was a fan of the original screen adaptation ""Judge Dredd"" with Sylvester Stallone at his scenery-chewing best.  If you didn't like Sly, you still had Diane Lane to look at and Rob Schneider's character for comic relief.  Even though the film had flaws (notably a flat, unexciting ending) it was fun if you didn't expect too much.

This sequel (it's not a remake) manages to keep all the flaws of the original but throws away all the fun stuff.  There is no humor, no real interplay between the characters, and there are no breathtaking special effects vistas or action set-pieces. Virtually the entire movie takes place inside one large, generic, scummy-looking building which looks drearily ordinary.  Dredd (Karl Urban) never takes off his helmet during the entire movie.  Come on - even Robocop took off his helmet at some point.  The IMDB entry for this movie says the cost was $50 million - it sure doesn't show on the screen.",1359849600,,933,4.75776397515528

4794254,4,B005LAII7G,"POSSIBLE SPOILERS FOLLOW.

From the start of the movie, Dredd is shown to be an unrelenting force to be reckoned with, and appropriate for the post-apocalyptic world he exists in.  Karl Urban's portrayal of Dredd is perfect.  He is reserved with emotion but not with doling out justice.
Olivia Thirlby is a good fit as new Judge Cassandra Anderson - and her psychic abilities in the film help the two out more than once.  Lena Headey is perfect as Ma-Ma, the drug lord and main antagonist in this movie.  Ma-ma is cold and ruthless, and is a perfect adversary for the equally cold Judge Dredd.
The action is fast-paced and pretty-much relentless, and the various types of ammunition available for use by Dredd makes for great special effects, and painful deaths for his foes.
Though there is limited room for plot development in the timeframe in which the movie takes place, Dredd develops itself fully as a good, hard-hitting action flick that drives home the fact that Dredd is all-business and takes no prisoners.",1359849600,2,1016,4.816091954022989

4794354,5,B005LAII7G,"To start off, I am so perplexed as to why it performed so terribly at the box office! Of course it's an R rated movie and they obviously cannot make money like PG-13 action movies but come on! Firstly, Dredd is one of the best looking action movie in a long time; the ""slo-mo"" effects are quite beautiful and I love the dark gritty cinematography inside Peach Trees. The set design is amazing as well. The Mega Structures are incredible during the opening aerial shots. The cherry on top though, definitely, is Olivia Thirlby... Wait, what, oh, I got off track there.

The story is decent. It definitely helps that Alex Garland is the writer. This is the fourth film he has written and it definitely continues his tried and true abilities to write in a post-apocalyptic setting with just a few characters to speak of. Dredd doesn't have very much dialogue, and it's a bit of a double edged sword. Obviously you want a likeable, relatable hero. I'd say he is likable enough. I'm glad they gave him a bit of humanity. He has a little sense of humor, which you can tell by an early scene involving an incendiary round. Judge Anderson rubs off on him through the movie. In the beginning he says something along the lines of a fail is a fail. By the end of the movie he sees the world in a slightly less black and white way when he passes judgement onto Judge Anderson. The other characters are drawn well enough. Judge Anderson is the psychic rookie who is very determined to become a judge. Ma-Ma is a vicious ex-prostitute who virtually runs Peach Trees. Overall I personally would give Dredd an enthusiastic 8/10 maybe an 8.5. I just wish there was a little more to the story.

If you want a professional review of the Audio/Video quality of the blu-ray I would suggest you go to blu-ray.com they review almost every blu-ray release.",1359763200,5,1832,4.531722054380665

4794547,5,B005LAII7G,"Having only watched it in theaters and the Blu Ray version (I do not have a 3D set up), the Blu Ray version is the one I'll be talking about.

Dredd was one of my favorite movies from all of 2012. It's a sci-fi action romp with gritty visuals and explosive action that doesn't bother dressing any of it up to try and pretend something else is there when it clearly isn't meant to be. It was pure fun combined with superb acting, a spectacular story, gorgeous visuals, and some of the best action you'll find anywhere.

While I always had a soft spot for Stallone's cheesy adaptation of Judge Dredd, Karl Urban's Dredd delivers the kind of man I expect I would fear and respect if I were unfortunate enough to live in Mega City One. The rest of the cast also does a spectacular job and I found myself enjoying Lena Headley as the villain more here then I ever have in Game of Thrones. Olivia Thirlby also delivers a great performance as a rookie judge under Dredd's tutelage on the toughest first bust any Judge could ask for. Honestly, I can't think of anyone in this movie that didn't do their role justice.

As for the Blu Ray quality, the movie still looks just as spectacular as it did on the big screen and sounds awesome. The packaging was also your typical Blu Ray fare, which I have no complaints about whatsoever.

Overall, the film is well worth the investment, well deserving of five stars, and easily some of the most fun you can have if you're still catching up on 2012's movies.",1359504000,5,1492,4.394927536231884

Second of all because I simplly love ""judge Anderson"" Olivia Thirlby. She's so cute. I love that they put an empasis on the gun. It's so cool. THey kept it short and sweet. Left his helmet on the whole time too which i though was actually funny.
 *Correction* Oops dredd was written first. I do have to point out that anyone who has seen the raid-redemption knows that its basically identical with dredd having its own finishing touches on it. Second time I have seen this in past few years. The first one was with hunger games copycatting ""battle royal"". I don't have a problem with it though because i love all the movies. I also like the amercian remakes also such as ""the girl with the dragon tatoo. ""
  In conclusion this film was just kick ace. Lots of action and they keep the movie going fast-paced. I look forward to a sequel if they make one!

*6/9/2014 Watched it again tonight. I'd have to agree with my former posts stating it rocked. Olivia thirlsby is simply dreamy, and the action sequences are entertaining. I'm happy with the finished products. I think the film did a great job of leaving the viewer wanting more as it should have been it's primpary goal. However I've read they may not do any more sequels which leaves me very disappointed for I thought the goal was to make a bunch of these.

Below the surface, it provides interesting social commentary on the justice system and absolutism in the face of the absurd, but the viewer is not struck over the head with such concerns. I saw ""Dredd"" in the theater in September after being intrigued by the trailer and was not disappointed.  The visual effects are extremely well done, and it features a good amount of deadpan humor that actually made me laugh aloud.  Thematically it can be compared to some of the more famous films about the Vietnam War, as the plot line of ""Dredd"" is really a ""just another day"" scenario for the characters.  The pacing is good, there are no blatant logical absurdities, the tone is consistent, and it doesn't take itself too seriously, all of which were huge problems in ""Django Unchained.""  Despite very good critical and fan reviews, this movie failed to make an impact at the box office and only ran for a few weeks.  I've seen it four or five times since purchasing the movie, and it seems to be selling quite robustly.  Maybe we'll even get a sequel that rewards the work of Karl Urban and Olivia Thirlby if it continues to sell well, but at the very least, ""Dredd"" is destined to become a cult-classic alongside ""Fight Club"" and ""The Boondock Saints.""

Overall the film has a troubling story, but the comic book fans are giving great reviews.  The quality of the photography is the best part, in my opinion.  As far as a story, this does have plot parallels with The Raid Redemption.  Wonder if the comic inspired that movie too....

Definitely worth buying, but is extremely violent, graphically so.  Only thing missing is the smell of all that blood (if you ever worked in an ER trauma center, you know what I mean.)

Now that I have seen the 3D version, I have to give it 5 stars.  A visually impressive piece of cinema, well worth owning, as long as you are not letting little kids see all the violence in it.

Caught myself judging the book by the cover here..) this movie came out swinging BIG time and the best part about it was that it DID. NOT. STOP. Some of these action/adaptions spend a lot of time developing the much desired story... This movie summarized all of that nicely while keeping up with the carnage. I would summarize Dredd as a matrix type of action movie, with some robocop and Clint Eastwood thrown in.. Ha! The detail and driving elements were powerful, the acting fit the films sense of reality, and quite frankly I am hoping they make another. I recommend this movie to anyone who open mindedly enjoys a good action movie that makes you say words like ""awesome"" or ""dude, wooa!"" with bad guy drug dealers and slummy gotham city like environments.

If the director and production team spent half as much energy on atmosphere, pacing, or acting as they did on glorifying slow-motion blood splatter then those 4 and 5 star ratings might be justified.

I'm not surprised that it did poorly at the local cinemas, because this is rather some kind of fan movie, nothing for people that don't know ""Judge Dredd"", don't like violence or don't like one-line-sentences or a predictable story.

-Movie is great and plays in VLC with no problems
-Special features include a nice little commentary on the history of Dredd

The story while not the strongest, and done many time over in movies like The Raid: Redemption, and New Jack City, works for this movies. The elements of special effects are worked into the story line giving them more meaning then just one more slow motion scene. The violence is not to campy and some of it has a very small bit of dark humor to soften it up.
  What I didn't like in the movie is the Movies big bad guy, or in this case Bad Girl. While she is as bad as up get, I think she could have used a little more fleshing out as she is one of the most unmemorable villains in any movie ever.

 I rate the movie as a good time.",1359331200,2,787,4.058064516129032

This is an action movie from start to finish. It makes no excuses and doesn't hold back. If you don't like guns or violence than this movie isn't for you. I haven't seen a film like this since the 80's/early 90's when action films were action films without campy drama and dialogue thrown into them. This is just Good guy.. Bad Guy and a lot of bullets exchanged inbetween. For some reason though this movie kind of reminded me of Robocop. I guess it was because it's futuristic and features an insane villian manufacturing drugs thats goes over the top to try and kill Judge DREDD and his ""rookie"" sidekick.

I heard this movie didn't do too well in theaters probably because the original movie was such a joke but this one is like Batman Begins. I hope there's a sequel.",1359331200,,948,4.473988439306359

I really hope they continue this and bring back Olivia Thirlby's character in some form. Ma-Ma was perfectly played Lena Headey. Anyway, not gonna go on about how awesome the movie was.

There is no sentimental storyline for Dredd, no character development, and he does not save the wold. Instead, Dredd gets a call. Dredd responds to the call and bad stuff goes down.

So, despite a plethora of good reviews, I went in with somewhat lowered expectations. Boy, was I surprised! The movie is amazingly well executed, especially given the budget. I'd say it sweeps the floor with many recent action flicks. Hey, the much lauded ""Avengers"" comes as an overbearing Disney toy-movie compared to the violent awesomeness that is ""Dredd"". Anyone in their psycho mood, looking for a fast-paced action with buckets of blood and gore galore, will not be disappointed. Better still, the violence here isn't as pointless or tasteless (hm, can we say that about violence?) as in other adaptations (""Watchmen"", I'm looking at you!). It's more of a Tarantino variety: stylish, haunting, visceral, and moving the plot forward. I wish more actions films were like that.

1). You couldn't see Urban's face, but I guess that adds to the mysteriousness of his character.
2).  The movie was pretty graphic with the violence ... especially the three poor bastards that got SKINNED and then thrown over the penthouse balcony.  You only got to see little snippets of the actual deed (who the hell would want to see ALL of it?) but it was still enough to thoroughly creep you out.  Definitely not recommended for little eyes/ears.
3).  The believability of Ma-Ma's rise to power.  Ex-whore/druggie over all those guys with guns?  That's gotta be one tough broad!

Overall, Karl Urban is totally underrated.  That man is everywhere from the old Xena shows to ""Chronicles of Riddick"" to ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy to Star Trek's ""Bones"" McCoy"" and dozens of others in between.  I concur with one of the previous reviewers for this movie ... Urban IS Dredd!

Liked the movie ... make a sequel, but maybe go a little easier on the graphic violence so younger eyes can appreciate it.

And what a day for rookie Judge Anderson to have her assessment! Good performances all round and the film scores for not out-staying its welcome. It has its faults for sure, mostly due to the modest budget but I like the overall aesthetic of a more grounded, run down future (why would they have flying cars after a nuclear war anyway?) It is also incrediby violent, a throwback to the 80's action films (especially Robocop - partially based on Judge Dredd). Add to that subtle satire, strong female characters (there's a good case for calling this movie 'Anderson'), several genuine laughs and a stonking soundtrack and you have a pretty damn good film.

The DVD is one of those few times it matches the blu-ray because of the intentional 'grain' used in some scenes, keeping that overall 'documentary' vibe. I did have some problems with the blu-ray (as mentioned elsewhere) but I swapped players and it was fine. The colours during the slo-mo scenes are very vivid though, so the blu-ray just edges it (strange how Amazon only allows one review, as DVD and blu-ray are completely different beasts). Extras are short and sweet, undoubtedly these could have been better but there's a quick beginner's guide to Dredd's comic history for those only familiar with the character because of 'the other film'. Overall, a solid re-introduction to the character and the world of Mega City One. It's a real shame a sequel is highly unlikely to get made, as this setting opens up so many possibilities, not to mention classic Dredd stories to explore.

3.5 stars if it were any other film, 4 stars because it's Dredd (long term fan). But as some people have only given it 1 star because they 'didn't like it', I'll give it 5 for the opposite reason.",1359158400,5,2036,4.716292134831461

Policemen who serve as judge, jury and executioner (IF NEEDS BE). This movie actually builds the mega cities around our existimg cities. Judge Dredd didpenses justice harshly but very fairly. Most of the movie takes place in a building but don't let that turn you away. You will be completely satisfied with the pacing and dark humor in the film.

4795113,5,B005LAII7G,"It grows exponentially more difficult to create a good action movie, especially one that can stand out from the massive corpus of material.  Stories get trite or convoluted, visuals get bloated or too heavy on the CGI.  But Dredd works.  Definitely the best action movie I've seen in several years.

Here's why.  The movie is tightly controlled:  Dredd says very little but what he says is concise, like the language of a Hemingway novel; the film is short without overblown drama or lengthy kill sequences; the music propels the film without getting in the way of the flow; scenery and individual scenes are interconnected and aligned so that the story moves quickly but not abruptly; and the editing pays homage to keen observers who need little reference for story connection.

Simple yet effective film making requires enormous discipline, and it is precisely what makes this movie excellent.",1359072000,5,896,5.054421768707483
4795114,5,B005LAII7G,"Could not believe that when I downloaded this to watch that it would be this good. After seeing the original and thought it wasn't good, and like all remakes, they just almost always fall short and flat, I didn't have high hopes. This one I downloaded and watched because of a friends recommendation. What a surprise.  I can watch this movie again and again.",1359072000,4,358,4.59375
4795115,5,B005LAII7G,"I have to be honest here.  I liked the Stallone film, Judge Dredd.  It has not much value as a good film, but it sure as hell is entertaining, and sort of a guilty pleasure.

Dredd, though, is not a guilty pleasure.  It's a pleasure you should be proud of.  It's a shame this movie didn't do well in theaters, and that will surely not help Hollywood make more R-rated comic book movies, which is terrible.  It just so happen that R-rated movies are not profitable, and it's because the general public has a bad concept of them due to lack of information.  Remember this: because this movie failed, we're more likely to see another PG-13 Punisher and the same for Deadpool, if it ever gets greenlit.

Anyway, onto the movie.  If you've seen the previous adaptation or read the comics, you'll know the basic gist.  Otherwise: it's the future and crime is rampant.  The justice system has been compressed, and streets are watched by special agents who are there to fulfill the role of police, judge, jury and executioner.  These agents are called ""Judges"".  Judge Dredd is one of the best, and one of the most feared by the criminals.  Judges ride in motorbikes and use a special gun, which is able to dispense several forms of firepower.

That's the one thing this movie has in common with the previous one, otherwise, it's an entirely different plot: there's a new drug being popular on the streets, called ""Slo-Mo"", which makes people temporarily sense the world at a really slow speed.  The creator of this drug, a prostitute-turned-drug-lord named Ma-Ma inadvertedly drags Judge Dredd into her turf, and now she'll do anything to get rid of him.

Dredd, though, not only is a formidable opponent, but also carries a wild card: rookie female Judge Anderson, who's being tested by him in order to keep her job, due to her terribly low skills, except for one: powerful psychic abilities.

Now, I'm not going to compare this film to the other one, but there are a couple of things to mention.  One, this film is slightly more rooted in reality.  Second, while the first one changes location all the time, this one is almost completely set inside Ma-Ma's building (Die Hard style).

A third, interesting feature is that while Karl Urban has nowhere nearly such an imposing figure as Stallone does, it actually works well for this film.  Going back to the Die Hard comparison, it makes Dredd a more relatable character.  Dredd should not be a character we like, but he's so well written and portrayed that you can't help but do it.  He's not a superpowered individual, or a wealthy man, or even a chosen one with a hidden ability.  He's just a regular trained policeman with a powerful belief in the law.  And, when put in charge of the situation, he becomes an unrelenting badass.

Judge Anderson is an interesting character, who shows some great character progression, and it's not just ""the girl"", like Judge Hayden was in Stallone's film.  She's here to be a character, not to become an object of desire.  Ma-Ma, on the other hand, is quite a terrifying villain.  You can easily believe she's able to handle all the power at her hand, and understand why everyone is so afraid of her.  Both actresses do a terrific job in their roles.

The film itself is visually beautiful, particularly in the slow-motion scenes (which, unlike in other films, actually make sense here), though quite gory, so if that somehow displeases you, be warned.  The settings are well done, though limiting the setting to the inside of a building doesn't do much to show the futuristic looks of the world.  That, though, is not important for this particular story.

All in all, this is a great film, one that shouldn't be missed by anyone who enjoys a good comic book story with lots of spectacular action.  Unless you're looking for romance, there's probably something for you here, so go get it.  Purchase this movie on DVD or Blu Ray, so it makes enough money to warrant a sequel.  Because, trust me, you want one.",1359072000,6,3991,4.672883787661406

This second one DOES show in 3D, but on first showing you may have to start it in 3D, then if it only shows in 2D, press stop, then power down your 3D Blu Ray player, then power back up.

4795120,4,B005LAII7G,"If you are a Judge Dredd fan as I am, you will enjoy this.  Brutal, unflinching, violent, but tempered by beautiful, colorful, interludes whenever someone uses a certain drug, this movie could have been worse than Stallone's version but for three things:
1. Karl Urban, a self-professed Dredd admirer, plays the part perfectly.  The helmet never comes off, he speaks with a scowl, he punishes the guilty harshly;  in other words, he IS Dredd.  Urban completely loses himself in the role and in doing so gives the character the edge of believability, which is important in an unbelievably horrible world.
2. The Slo-Mo sequences are delightful and not overused.  If the film had a bigger budget they probably would have been, but rolling through the gate at just around $50 million and shot in South Africa probably ensured their effects budget to be small, so the filmmakers worked wonders with the Slo-Mo stuff -- it looks better, as a matter of fact, than the effects in lots of other big Hollywood productions.  It is one of the highlights of the movie.
3. No annoying sidekick.  Since I hate Rob Schneider I could not stand Stallone's Dredd, but the character played by Olivia Thirlby more than makes up for the misstep of Schneider in the 1995 version.  Her character is put there to give Dredd a human, emotional anchor, which this film needs because of its graphic violence;  without her Dredd would probably just be a psychopathic killing machine on the order of The Terminator, but her appeals to his mercy, his humanity, validate having her around -- UNLIKE Rob Schneider.  Thirlby took what could have been a cypher role -- a female in a man's movie whose only reason to be there was eye candy -- and gave it chops.  A truly well-done turn by her.
As for the other major star in Dredd, though she tries (and maybe that is the problem), Lena Headey's villain is ridiculous, which is saying a lot in a movie like this.  Her take on Ma-Ma gives her ample screen time to mug, sneer and smolder, but never once did I feel menace, and to be as bad as she acts, snapping off kill orders and such, menace should be tantamount.  She was not a match for Dredd at all, so much not that the inevitable showdown between her and Dredd simply showed what she was all along:  a big-mouthed dope fiend and nothing else.  Ma-Ma is the one failure in this movie.
Put all together, Dredd is a spot-on adaptation of a beloved comic antihero, made by people who appreciated and understood the source material.  Not many superhero movies can say that.",1359072000,3,2539,4.621380846325167

not only you get a bad ass character taking down a whole gang of street thugs while he climbs a freaking massive building of MEGA CITY 1, you also get the 1st die hard movie into the steps of dredd. but with afresh take and superb acting and action.

judge ANDERSON is astonishingly sexy and hot, and also a bad ass. youget to see how she develops from being a rookie to being a judge just of the same caliber dredd is. she makes the movie! dredd packs the BADASSNESS!!! and ANDERSON carries the acting and the growth and depth of the movie!!!

not other movie of 2012 can compare to this one in terms of action! (and i am speaking of budget. how doyou make a greatest action movie without having the budget of the avengers or the dark knight rises???only dredd can!!!
and did!!!
skyfall sucks in comparison to DREDD!!! i would be ashamed of being the new BOND at the side of JUDGE DREDD.

IT DELIVERS ON EVERY LEVEL. and i have to add i only went to the theater coz i was bored that day and wanted to check if dredd was fun. and i came out from the cinema SHOCKED of how good this movie was.

I EXPECTED THIS DAY TO BUY ON BLU RAY 3D and still delivers. ITS FRESH! ITS RAW! ITS GREAT! GREATER THAN OTHER ACTION FILMS! AND SURELY ITS GOING INTO MY COLECCTION OF FAVORITE FILMS OF ALL TIME!

and i close this review by wishingthe it continues to sell on the upcoming weeks, coz it will be great if we get to see the continuity of ANDERSON, DREDD and the stories in MEGA CITY 1. that would be the greatest thing that could happen to action movies nowadays.

buy it without doubt. if u miss it at the cinema. don't miss it now!!!
support it. i know u fans of the good action genre will be blown with this movie.
and u will support it, just as i am doing it right now.
this is my 1st review ever, and i did it coz dredd is totally worth it!

4795310,2,B005LAII7G,"If you haven't seen this movie, rent it first.  I was tempted to buy it cold, based on the overwhelming number of five-star reviews it has, here on Amazon, but it wasn't even a good rental in my opinion.

The majority of the film takes place inside of a dilapidated apartment building, and it's basically 95-minutes of bullets flying back-and-forth.  They never really flesh out the world Dredd lives, the ""Hall of Justice"" which he works for, or even Dredd himself.  I never got a sense of who this character was, why he does what he does, who he does it for, or why he's so special.  That's one thing the Stallone movie got right.  In the first film, Dredd was an actual person; one who took himself very seriously.  His job meant everything to him, and it was his dedication to it that made him one of the best there was; but these obsessive traits also hurt him in his personal life.  Over the course of the movie, he loses a mentor; he loses a brother; but by the end of the movie, he gains a friend and a love interest!  He also faces corruption within the force.

In this movie, they don't explore anything in detail (besides slow-mo effects), and Dredd is no different than any of the other judges that appear in the film.  They all talk in dehydrated voices, they're all devoid of personality, and they're all interchangeable with Anderson--Dredd's partner de jour--being the only exception.  This movie feels like it's more about her, as she tries to prove her worth as a judge, than it does about Dredd, who is just there to be her chaperone on her first suicide mission.

At no point does Dredd seem intimidating, and neither does Ma-Ma, whose constant lack of energy suggests she has no will to live.  Yet, we're supposed to believe that this lanky, lifeless drug-addict was capable of taking over a 200-story apartment building, loaded with heavily-armed criminals, that were already fighting for turf before she arrived?  I'm not knocking Lena Heady.  I love her as Cersei on Game of Thrones (a REAL villain), but here, she's cast as a walking, talking corpse.  Her character here is so lifeless, it would have been less out-of-place on an episode of The Walking Dead.  As I type this, I can't help but think that the people that enjoyed this movie are fans of the show, who have been starved for action by watching the past three seasons on DVD, back-to-back.",1358985600,3,2375,4.587677725118484

The super slow-mo was a little overused at first, but in some scenes it really was unique. Of course there are some great over-the-top scenes of graphic violence. Dredd came off as a total boss without over-acting the part. I hope this movie gets plenty of underground attention so they will make the two rumored sequels they had planned.

As I watched it I thought that this would be far more successful as an ongoing TV series than a series of movies.

4795377,5,B005LAII7G,"For starters, I am a huge JD fan, which made me excited and also worried about this second attempt at bringing him and his world to the big screen.  Dredd stands as a stark example of how clear storytelling and a simple plot can make an extraordinary film.  The laughable Stallone film tried to shoe horn in too many concepts from the 30+ year history of the character.  Dredd, on the other hand, focused purely on the meat of the character, giving only small glimpses of the sprawling universe he inhabits.

Judge Dredd may seem hollow and robotic to new comers, but this is exactly why his character is so beloved.  The film makers do a great service to the character, and Karl Urban's performance helps to solidify this.  I can only smile when reading irate reviews hammering the lack of character development and robotic acting.  The reviewers obviously don't understand.  There is a reason why JD never takes his helmet off.  He is meant to be faceless.  He is the one solid and reliable rock in the sea of crazy that is the far future.

The one drawback is that this film is very violent, and if you aren't prepared for it you will be turned off fairly quickly.  It also makes great use of slow motion to capture and juxtapose the action from different viewpoints.  This gives the action scenes a strange pace, but I felt it to be perfectly suited to the plot.  It only felt overdone during a couple of sequences.

Speaking of plot, this film has taken some knocks because of a thin plot.  I find this funny considering how paper thin most movie plots are when compared to novels and comics.  The Hobbit is a movie about a long journey, and is great because of what happens along the way and what obstacles they have to overcome.  This movie is essentially a day in the life of Judge Dredd, and is about his journey to stop and apprehend a gang leader.  It is great because of what happens along the way and what obstacles he must overcome.  A simple, clearly stated plot with great story telling wrapped around it is what you will find in this film if you give it a chance.  I did, even with my fear of past failures, and I loved it.

I don't like the Ultraviolet service, but this disc also has an iTunes compatible download.  If there is a drawback, then it is that all of these are crammed onto a single disc instead of giving us a separate disc for the Blu Ray and the digital download. Also, having no DVD version available in the set was a bit of a downer since I like to loan mine out to friends to get them hooked.  The digital download worked fine for me, though, and the BR ran perfectly in my 1st generation PS3.",1358985600,5,2630,4.364197530864198

4795535,5,B005LAII7G,"Best comic book movie of 2012 by far, and that's in the same year as The Avengers assembled to mercilessly trash the city they were supposed to be saving and The Dark Knight Rises where the Dark Knight only rose in the last twenty minutes of a near-three-hour film.

Lean, mean and devoid of unnecessary backstory filler, this is a brutal but brilliant film that aims an incendiary bullet straight at the more mature comic book fans, in much the same way that the graphic novels of Alan Moore, Frank Miller and Neil Gaiman did in the 1980's. As such, with casual audiences so used to the vanilla-flavoured superheroes of the Marvel Universe, it looks jarringly out-of-place at times but is actually a far more stylish interpretation than many have given it credit for. And perhaps because much of the action is limited to dank dark corridors and dingy rooms, the 3D seems to 'pop' all the more; even the title and credit sequences seem more 3D than most of the Asgardian scenes in Thor.

All-in-all, worth every penny you pay for it. If you're a fan of comicbooks, it's a must; if you're a fan of action films, it's a must.

Every place on the web that talks about it is talking about an amazingly sharp and entertaining movie whose indifferent box-office reception is baffling. Well it isn't baffling - just the result of a poor (and possibly under-funded) marketing campaign.

Dredd newbies will find themselves swept quickly into the action with minimal preface; Dredd comic fans will recognise their hero immediately. And to those complaining that Mega City 1 isn't rendered with all the painstaking expense of the Stallone movie - remember that this is exactly why 'Dredd' has the room to be breathtakingly violent and memorable; there's no way the producers could have brought us something this gritty and particular with $150m worth of producers breathing down their necks.

That said, the urban CGI is amongst the most flawless I've ever seen of its type; and that's typical of this movie, which knows its limits but is determined to max out within them.

'Dredd' is lean, mean and moody, just like its hero. Karl Urban captures all of the minimalism of the classic comic character, and the script mercifully keeps our favourite future-cop away from either saving the world or being redeemed from his semi-fascist roots. The only fault one can find with this movie is that it almost echoes the central character's talent for understatement - when 'Yeah' becomes a classic line, it's as if a young Dirty Harry is back in a new movie (and Harry Callahan was the inspiration for Judge Dredd in the 1970s).

This film has a welcome excess of attitude and atmosphere to back up its frank violence and narrative sparsity. It's a simple tale, expertly told, and well-deserving of a (sadly unlikely) sequel.

The pleasantest surprise of 2012, and very highly recommended.",1358899200,4,1906,5.015822784810126
4795654,3,B005LAII7G,"*** spoiler alert ****

As a fan of both comic books and dystopian futuristic movies, I really wanted to like this movie.  But there were too many nagging plot holes, inconsistent acting performances, and general over-use of slo-mo sequences, for me to completely enjoy it.  While a 1000% improvement over the Stallone version of this film from 1995, it is not a ""must own"".  I rented this movie on 2D Blu-Ray, so I can't comment on the 3D experience or special features discs.

First off, while I am a comic book fan, I have only read a few that featured Judge Dredd- specifically the mid-1990s ""Dredd by Simon Bisley"" trade paperback and Batman-Dredd crossover.  Perhaps this doesn't qualify me as knowledgeable about the Dredd universe, but I've read plenty of comics, and seen movies like Robocop and Blade Runner, to know when this genre is working well.

Here are the things I liked:
* Karl Urban as Judge Dredd.  He projects a gruff voice well and chews up the scenery whenever he is on screen.  It is a nice touch that he never removes his helmet, a faithful adaption of his comic book character.
* The authentic look of Mega City One and the Peach Trees 200 story slum tower.  Filming in South Africa helped give it a more different look, as opposed to filming with the LA or NYC skyline in the background.
* The compact and self-contained story.  Too many times in bad futuristic movies they overreach, showing off huge sets while having the protagonist try to save the entire planet.  The movie doesn't require you to have read 100s of pages of the comic to follow the story either.

Here are the things I didn't like:
* Lena Headey as the villain Ma-Ma.  Fans of the Game of Thrones series on HBO will be disappointed, as Lena underwhelms as the evil druglord Ma-Ma.  They scar her up to make her look fierce, but she has few chances to show how evil she really is.  Maybe they cut scenes to keep the running time less than two hours.  Ma-Ma has few chances to be evil, even though other characters keep telling us how evil she is.  We just have to take their word for it.
* Kay, Ma-Ma's clansman.  He does little for much of the film, standing in the background as a cuffed prisoner of Dredd and Anderson.  He acts like he's on Law & Order- waiting to call his attorney, post bail, and sue the police if they attempt to abuse him.  That's not the world of Dredd!  Kay is guilty of so many crimes his punishment of death is a foregone conclusion, the judges tell him is only alive so he can be tortured at headquarters.  Yet he doesn't complain, threaten or bargain with his captors, or try to escape until what seems like forever.
* The Peach Trees lockdown plot device.  I realize that the 200 story high-rise slum is supposed to be a place where Judges fear to tread.  And that Ma-Ma's goons called Control and told them that they were running a system test.  But it seemed hard to believe that the building could remain completely sealed for hours, without attracting much suspicion from the Judges.  Especially so after Anderson calls for the meat wagon just before the lockdown, and Dredd radios in for backup after they briefly escape through the blown out wall.  I found it hard to believe that the judges would extend the benefit of the doubt for so long in a place that was described as a haven of crime and drug trafficking.
* Overuse of slow motion sequences.  There seemed to be lots of these in the film, and not just when one of characters was on the slo-mo drug.  The scene where Ma-Ma falls to her death has less impact since the effect had been used many times before already.

All in all, I found the movie to be decent, but not excellent.  That's too bad, since the film had many things going for it that would have put it into the ""most own"" category.  Instead, it is in more in the ""OK to watch on a airplane or road trip"" category.

4795655,4,B005LAII7G,"I know that when you think of Judge Dredd you think of that awful 90's movie with rob schneider and frankly who can blame you. It was ultra cheesy and completely not true to the graphic novel. It was a Hollywood monstrosity of the highest caliber.

But let me tell you right now , this one IS NOT a Hollywood monstrosity. Its a painstakingly crafted and accurate to the graphic novel as you could get for a $50 Million budget. Karl Urban does a great job as the cold but effective Judge and the brutality of the graphic novel carries on through beautifully.

The special effects are excellent and gritty. This is not a movie for the weak of stomach as it hammers you right off the bat with just how brutal and terrible this dystopian world is but the Judges are what keeps it from completely falling apart.

""The camera work is fantastic. This is really a film to see in 3D.""  This was fantastic in theatres in 3D.  I have a 2D television and love the 2D version, too.

""Karl Urban is Dredd. He needs to be warmed too but he plays the part very well.""  It is hard to relate with someone when you can't see their face, but you will have formed a real bond with Dredd by the movie's end.

""Olivia Thirlby is also excellent as Anderson. Lena Headey is very convincing in her Motherly role. ""

4795762,4,B005LAII7G,"Okay, I get why so many give this five stars and I did very much enjoy this film, but...

The best Judge Dredd film is still Robo-cop. Hear me out.

Judge Dredd the Stallone craptacular had some very fine Judge Dredd qualities about it even if it failed on some important notes. Mainly, the decision to turn Dredd into a heroic character. My understanding (and much to Stallone's credit) is that Stallone fought to keep many elements in tact from the comic but simply lost too many behind the scene battles. Ultimately though, Rob Schneider as Walter the Wobot and other elements made this film just too off base from the source material.

This film Dredd, gave us an incredibly gritty take on Judge Dredd. Far more grittiness than even the comic book had. It was as if the pendulum swung too far the other direction. This Mega-City One was a bland and brutal place, devoid of craziness and relying on the 90's version of the stereotypical thug for the vast majority of its baddies. Despite some of its perfunctory elements, the whole film worked and it was nice to see a more visceral take on the action. Karl Urban was fantastic as Judge Dredd, even sounding eerily like Clint Eastwood in several scenes (which is acceptable as Dirty Harry was the template for Judge Dredd). Olivia Thirlby was also great as a young Judge Anderson, giving us a much more human side of the Judges, even if she was well on her way to becoming nearly as hard as Dredd by the end. My only complaint (albeit a small one in the overall context of the film) was a small scene in the finale in which Dredd chose an action that could make him out to be sadistic. Dredd was never a sadist. Overall though, just not a particularly good Judge Dredd story yet a good film and decent introduction to that universe. I know that may seem confusing but I stand by it. Karl Urban = Great as Dredd. Film = Great entertainment. A Dredd Story = A decent introduction if not the best example of a Dredd story. The important part is that the producers got the important elements of Judge Dredd, mostly right.

A quick note on Robo-Cop. So many elements in that film were spot on from the old 2000 A.D.s with both the gritty and nasty city and all of its twisted humor and irony in tact (Something sorely missing from Dredd (film) and the strong fascist cop protagonist (if too sympathetic in relation to Dredd). Even Robo-Cop's famous line is right out of one of Judge Dredd's earliest comics, ""Come quietly or there will be trouble."" Anyway, still the best overall Judge Dredd adaptation.

So for Dredd, despite its flop in theaters, it has been doing amazingly well on both rental and purchase for home video and I know I would love to see more of Karl Urban as Dredd. Fingers crossed.",1358812800,,2749,4.501002004008016

After that, there's the story, amazed at how pretty the graphics were. A common thread in a popular perception of value in contemporary movies- make the action like a first person shooter in an RPG, then jack up the gory visuals and slow down the violence sequences so the eyeballs can feast on that cheek that was just ripped open by the fitty cal bullet, by the carcass that was skinned before killed, etc., etc., etc..

MegaCity One is all grimy and delapidated, rather than packed with color and imaginative futuristic details.  Which is a shame; for the world of the comics, however distopian, was certainly colorful.  But I could forgive that, on account of the budget, if only they had injected a bit of brightness and color into the script.

It's nice that Dredd keeps his helmet on (one of the reasons I never bothered with Stalone).  Thus we never find out he is really Karl Urban, and not Judge Dredd.  But it's not enough.  Dredd, implacable as he was, had -- and needs to have -- a bright side - for otherwise he is not Wagner's larger-than-life embodiment of implacable justice (and occasional mercy); but merely another angry thug in a cop-suit sadistically taking out his frustrations on the criminal element.",1358812800,4,1010,4.655367231638418

4795768,3,B005LAII7G,"Dredd(released Sept/12)stars Karl Urban as Judge Dredd,Olivia Thirlby as Anderson,and others. Those of you who saw the original with Mr. Stallone in the lead,will find this one a bit more to the point and closer to the comic book series. It is far darker than Stallone's version and far more violent. The director had a thing for slo-mo here and seemed to enjoy showing bullets rip through flesh,blood spurting everywhere and bodies hitting pavement,in that mode. It is certainly not for the squeamish and it seemed like he was making a gory point once but continuing to beat your heads with it all through the movie. I like both versions as they are like brothers with the same parents,but I think Stallone's comes in respectively ahead of this one.
The story finds the post apocalyptic world now living in mega cities. Giant 200 or more storied apartment complexes are THE preferred places to live. The world also has a new style police force in which judges roam the streets and dispense justice,on the spot. Dredd is the most well known and storied of all the judges,and he has to accompany a rookie judge about the city and mark her as to whether she is future judge material or not. She scored four points below a pass at the academy,but her enhanced psychic abilities seem to make her an asset to the force.
They attend a call to a 200 story high living complex which is controlled by a drug dealer by the nickname MaMa. She was a former model until a pimp she worked for wrecked her face and she went into illegal business for herself. She controls the entire building and it contains a home making drug lab which dispenses the newest in drugs,the latest being a substance,when inhaled,seems to slow down time to a micro-second when inhaled(everytime there is even the slightest hint of this drug being used,the director will use the slo-mo to ""enhance"" the feeling).Dredd and Anderson come upon a grisly scene in the atrium area where three flesh stripped bodies have been thrown down and lay on display for all to see.
A local fills them in on what is going down and they head to an upper floor where they arrest one of the men responsible for taking the skin off the dead men. They attempt to leave but MaMa and her minions seal the building in,using old blast shields and doors. Now Dredd and Anderson have a prisoner with no where to go. For the next few hours the pair have some up and down encounters with MaMa and her troops,just barely escaping death. Eventually more judges show up outside and get in. Instead of assisting Dredd they are there to assist MaMa who has them on their payroll. Now Dredd and Anderson are forced to battle,not only MaMa's crowd,but dirty cops also.
Little by little the dirty cops are taken care of and MaMa's time gets shorter and shorter. Eventually Dredd confronts her on her top floor. However,she has a remote control device that is rigged to go off if her heart stops beating. This doesn't stop Dredd who first wounds her,sentences her,gives her some of her own drugs and finally sends her crashing through glass and down onto the atrium floor like the others. The remote device goes off but the signal is too weak to set off 50 stories worth of explosive charges. In the end Anderson passes her grade test.
Dredd is played by one of my favourite actors,who was first introduced to me via the TV show Xena. You may recall Karl wonderfully playing Caesar,with a bit of a bent to that charcater. He has since then appeared in a myriad of films,like one of the Riddick's,Doom,just to mention two off the top. Karl is a great actor with a great future ahead of him. Here he plays the comic book Dredd to a tee,ruthless with no remorse. I did find his emoting struck me a little funny,as he seemed to be channeling Clint Eastwood at times,doing a decent Dirty Harry impression. Other than that Karl was THE main character here,and when he wasn't around,the action I found lagged a bit.
Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:40:1 and is clear and crisp. Extras include about six featurettes,a comic book prequel and commentary.
All in all a not too bad remake of the original starring Mr. Stallone. The producers I'm sure would say it's not a remake but a companion piece to Stallone's,but a rose by any other name,as Shakespeare would say. Urban does a pretty good Clint Eastwood impression with what little lines he is given to say throughout,but he turns out to be the centrepiece of the film. If the director had not made so much use of slo-mo,which got too gory and tiring,I might have given this film more marks. Recommended. 3 1/2-4 stars.",1358812800,,4607,4.59902794653706

Some of us pay attention by god! Then I saw that it was offered in 3D, which just seemed like tying a pretty red bow around a pile of steaming...well, you get the idea.

But then I saw that it was getting good reviews and I was all like...HUH?. This was, needless to say, a wee bit intriguing, as well as humbling, because my trailer analysis formula is rarely wrong. But i never got to the theater...I missed it.

But, I saw it on Amazon and was elated! I punched in my pin code and let the sci-fi ultra violence flow from the screen and into my brain. It is a film that isn't breaking any new ground, but the story was great and Carl Urban delivers as usual. It was the first time a comic adaptation felt like exactly like the comic that inspired it. I felt like I was watching a gritty Judge Dredd comic come to life. The sets are limited, but that's because the film makers decided to be smart about the obviously modest budget they had to work with. It's set inside a giant building in Megacity one, sort of like Die Hard, only darker and waaaay bloodier. I mean, holy eff the gore in this. heads exploding, slow mo bullets penetrating fat bellies.

It is action packed, but nothing is unrealistic and explosions used only sparingly. This movie is not trying to overdo special effects to fill gaps of plot. The acting I found excellent: although you never see Dredd's face (Karl Urban) because of his helmet/visor, he uses the lower part of his face and his voice with such an effect that still gives you a solid and likable character.

This was a movie I looked forward to for a long time. A real Judge Dredd movie, not the version with Stallone. I don't hate the first film (though I hate the formulaic role Rob Schneider played) but it doesn't feel true to the source material. For the benefit of some commenting here, the source materials are the 35+ years of Dredd stories. There is no connection between the two movies.

This new film is much better than the earlier one. The setting was great, the villain was convincing and I liked Urban and Thirlby. The idea of the judges being on the defensive worked well as did how the conflict gradually escalated.

What I didn't like are probably some of the same things that kept the movie from being a big box office success. A little blood and violence can add to a story, but showing someone get shot through the head in slow motion is too much for me and is not going to garner a large mainstream audience. There were far too many graphic gunshot wounds, and the death of the villain really made me cringe.

A 3D-only release probably didn't help the film's box office either (at least where I live there was no 2D, and 3D gives me a headache). Reminds me a bit of the reception Serenity received. Another good movie that didn't seem to catch on. Something tells me a sequel will not happen anytime soon.

For all those people complaining it's not like the original, this is NOT a remake or sequel to the first movie.  The first movie was based off a comic, just like this one, and this is more true to the comics.

Not an all time classic or ground breaking in any way but a solid entertaining action sci fi movie. Its rated R, so for those that don't like graphic violence then this will not be your cup of tea. I was never a big fan of the Dredd comic book but I really liked this movie because of the quick pace and non stop action.  The movie was direct and to the point, no cheesy emotional bantering or cliched ra-ra super hero shenanigans, or deep artistic symbolic messages, it was just a solid action flick with cool weapons and killer fight scenes (the use of slow motion is really sweet, especially if you are watching it in 3D).  One thing to note for any 3D enthusiasts out there, the aspect ratio of the blu ray is such that it will not fill in the entire screen on a widescreen hdtv, meaning you will have black bars at the top and bottom of the screen which diminishes the 3D somewhat but not enough to reduce the enjoyment of the movie.

This wasn't meant to be an origin story but more a day in the life of a Street Judge and do you get a good idea. I love it.

In order to keep costs down, most of the movie is filmed inside a single building. There is some blood here and there. Dredd never takes off his helmut (sorry ladies), though Anderson walks around without one through most of the film (spoilers aside, you will see why in the movie).

The movie itself moves right along, and in some ways, it's more about Judge Anderson than Dredd (how she goes from Rookie to one of the ranks).

I liked it in many ways, it's action filled, though using a single location for the setting is not enough. The bad guys (and girls) are extremely violent, well, they are actually little more than psycho gang members, and that genre is wearing thin on me. I think the film makers could have been more creative to come up with an evil foil to Dredd's lawful approach.

While Dredd himself is mostly a conundrum, Urban brings nuance to the character, infusing him with a bestial but purposeful physicality and giving him a harsh voice that would beat Batman's to a pulp. As Anderson, Thirlby grounds the film emotionally; the stakes for her are higher than just her own life, as she experiences for the first time the realities and costs of the job.
There's a cynical way to look at Dredd, : proof for Hollywood that eventually any property can be made to work. But that would miss the point entirely. Dredd works because it's an action flick with wide appeal that takes risks it doesn't need to -- in its delightfully off-putting violence and daring style -- and those choices pay off in a singular and exhilarating movie experience. It's savage, beautiful and loads of fun.",1358467200,2,1109,4.836842105263158

I REALLY want to see Dredd and Anderson in a sequel!

One thing I would like to point out is I thought Lena Headey's performance as Ma-Ma was really good, especially considering the small amount of screen time and few lines she had to work with.

4797164,5,B005LAII7G,"The world of MegaCity started in a comic book series called ""2000 A.D."" in 1979 as a black & white ink outline style.  It was a British/Spanish artist's idea to create a new sci-fi comic off the heels of '77's Star Wars craze, because Sci-Fi was not selling well in the comic market.  The fan-favorite character in the comic was ""Judge Dredd,"" labeled as the ""Judge, Jury, and Executioner"" in what the Brits (emphasis on Brits) felt as a ""right-wing"" Fascist Police State mentality at the time.  (Fascism is more of a Left-wing thing, actually...Big Government telling you what to do and how to act, etc) But anyway, some of the uniform and symbols of the Judges and Command Central were big Eagles, which have been symbols of European Fascism thru-out the centuries (Roman, Nazis, and to an extension America.)  The stories in 2000 A.D. and Judge Dredd have generally been more about everyday life in MegaCity and the surrounding Cursed Earth areas, rather than just on Judge Dredd, so the stories are pretty much endless.  Dredd is just there to clean up the mess.  Which leads us to the story portrayed in this 2012 Dredd rebbot film.

In Dredd 3D, we have a MegaBlock (a 200-story cubical shaped towering mass of concrete with a open central core for sunlight and ventilation purposes surrounded by businesses and slummy apartments) called 'Peachtrees,' that is being run by the Ma. Ma Clan.  A drug clan ran by Lena Heady's character whose drug of choice is Slo-Mo (a drug that slows your brain's perception of time down to 1% of real time.)  Their rule is ruthless and involves some very graphic actions of murdering poor folks that get in their way.  Well, in a Crime Call to the Judges that involves the murder of 3 Judges in Peachtrees, sends Dredd and his new female Rookie Judge into this MegaBlock to investigate.  Well, to make a long story short.  The Ma. Ma Clan lock-down the MegaBlock, trapping Dredd and his partner inside, with a bounty on their head. So the rest of the film involves them trying to get out and killing as any bad guys as they need to.  Think Die Hard with an all-purpose hi-tech 9mm auto-pistol.

But what makes this Dredd so superior to Stallone's '95 outing, is that it adheres to the dark and gritty atmosphere of the comics, along with a bright, but gloomy (and grainy) comic book color palette, akin to the Ray Stevenson ""Punisher: Warzone"" film. This film actually looks like you're watching a live-action motion comic.  And quite frankly, it works brilliantly.  The slow-mo parts (4000 fps) also emphasize this comic book feel.

Unlike the '95 film, this one absolutely deserves a follow-up....telling an all-new story, as this story wraps up with the death of the villian.  I'd love to see them go into the Cursed Earth Saga.  That'd be cool as hell.  Maybe not in the next film, but perhaps in a 3rd if this iteration goes that far.",1358467200,4,2878,4.6726190476190474

Maybe I'm being unfair here after only my one viewing, but I found the cinematography to be pretty poor, especially in terms of 3D composition, but also in terms of just the overall look of the movie.  It looks cheap and badly shot.  I'll rewatch it at some point and I will revise this review at that point if I feel I was wrong.

The props don't look very good (especially not the Judges' motorcycles, and Dredd's helmet doesn't fit right or something).

The writing is not completely terrible and the acting is mostly passable, although Urban's frown is too exaerrated a lot of the time.

There are some interesting visual effects and some really bad ones.  There's a very uneven level of gore. Sometimes they spare the audience a gruesome image, and sometimes they shove a gore effect (of various qualities from laughably bad all the way up to good enough to be gross) in your face in a way that feels out of place to me.

Dredd didn't seem large or imposing enough in my opinion, his voice lacked weight in some scenes, and the actor was just trying to hold his mouth the way Stallone did the whole time.  The smaller Dredd made him seem more like an underdog, which may have helped the movie, but it doesn't fit the character as far as I'm aware.

Helmet purists seem to like that he keeps the helmet on.  Yay.  Stallone wore his helmet while in the field until he was stripped of his rank and banished.  Urban is shown without his helmet at one point in the movie while he's not in the field, and frankly why wouldn't he be?  The real question is why would he tolerate a particularly glaring helmet-fail that's eventually addressed in the movie but only far too late.

Also, if you're someone who hates CG blood effects, you should know this movie is shameless with them and they look awful.

There are some questionable effects and props in the Stallone movie but, on the whole, it looks a lot better and I thought that movie was a lot more fun.  This one is a so-so action movie that  doesn't look very good and just wasn't very enjoyable to watch for me.  I don't hate the movie, but I thought it would be better than it was, despite not thinking it looked good enough to bother with in the theater.",1358467200,2,2661,4.389795918367347
4797353,5,B005LAII7G,"I watch bad ""genre' movies all the time.  I'm familiar with the license to a degree and have seen the stallone version.  This was actually a really well done movie.  Very violent but seemingly legitimate to the source material.  I think the other (female) judge was miscast.  I get the dynamic that's supposed to be in place (soul-less judge interacting with someone seemingly sympathetic to the people she's supposed to judge and how they change each other over the course of the movie) but it seems ham-fisted and the female judge seems a little loopy for this material/world.

It's decent for the budget and for the most part takes place in an apartment building (a big one) probably for that reason.  But it's good for what it is.  Doesn't really have a point or go anywhere though but I suppose that's just the nature of these popcorn flicks.",1358380800,,847,4.675675675675675

it is a tragedy that it didn't do well in the theaters, and I am very hopeful that it does well in sales and gains a cult following like The Chronicles of Riddick, so that we might once again see Urban as Dredd.

Movie is like a mash up of Dirty Harry, Die Hard, Robocop, Minority Report, and Training Day.

4797359,5,B005LAII7G,"First of all, I know that I made a very bold statement in using that title.  Allow me to explain.

As far as I am concerned, Dredd is indeed one of the greatest action movies of all time.  Of course, this is incredibly subjective, but to me, it hits it out of the park.  When I'm watching a straight-up action movie, I'm looking for a few things.  First and foremost, I want realistic, but not gratuitous action.  For example, the Expendables movies are amazing for what they are, but it's all very gratuitous and over the top.  It makes for a fun time, but it just won't make me want to watch the film over and over again.  I'll just skip to the scenes I liked.  In Dredd, the action comes fast and furious, but no scene feels superfluous.  What we get in Dredd is an incredibly violent action movie, but every move Dredd makes is simply to complete his goal, and nothing else.  It continually drives the plot and makes the audience identify with both Dredd himself, and his new rookie partner, Anderson.

The long and short of it is this - Dredd doesn't pull any punches.  Every scene has a purpose.  I can't tell you how impressive and refreshing it was for me to NOT see a romantic sub-plot develop between Dredd and Anderson.  That just wouldn't be believable, but it would certainly fall in line with a very well-established action movie trope.  Bravo to the film makers here.

I also want to touch on the source material and how this movie relates.  As other reviewers have mentioned, this could be the most faithful adaptation of a comic in movie history.  This film nails Judge Dredd as a character.  He is a faithful public servant, hardened by the harsh word in which he lives.  He is not devoid of emotion or feeling, but he knows how to put it aside to do what he has to do.  No doubt, the characters in this film were well-written, but Karl Urban needs a special mention here.  If any of you are jaded by Stallone's portrayal of Dredd, then you can breathe a huge sight of relief.  Karl Urban is amazing.  Dredd is a hard character to pull off.  As I mentioned, he needs to be almost cartoonish in how cold and calculating he is, but he can't be made into a robot.  I can't think of anyone being able to pull of this balancing act quite as believably as Urban does in this film.  He has made a fan for life in me.

So to summarize, for action-lovers out there, you can't go wrong with Dredd.  As I have mentioned, its pacing is perfect and its action is sublime.  Expect a visceral and heart-stopping romp through one night from hell in the life of Judge Dredd.  And all the while, looking through the filter of one of the most beautifully shot films in recent memory.",1358380800,4,2682,4.355555555555555

4797385,5,B005LAII7G,"Before you even start reading my review, if you haven't seen DREDD, stop reading and just get it. It's fantastic.

Peter Travis and Alex Garland have delivered one of the best action films in recent memory. Karl Urban, clearly a Dredd enthusiast, utterly nailed the hard boiled, unforgiving ballistics of the titular role while Olivia Thirlby's performance will help secure her a place in the next generation of leading talent. She's wonderful as Judge Anderson.

The production design and the mature approach to the material singly places DREDD well above the tongue-in-cheek offerings of the Fast and Furious films along with the myriad hyper-realistic productions due later this year. DREDD completely immerses the viewer in the dystopian world of the future and the plight of its citizens. DREDD is exciting, unexpected and, amid the hail of gunfire and Judge Dredd's unmitigated obsession to protect the people, it somehow remains a story of human innocence and empowerment.",1358380800,4,979,5.269230769230769

4797389,4,B005LAII7G,"Mega-City One: a vast metropolis of 800 million people stretching along the Eastern Seaboard of North America and a safe refuge from the radiation-ravaged Cursed Earth beyond. Fifteen thousand crimes take place daily in this huge city and only the men and women known as Judges - law-enforcement officers who summarily evaluate crimes and dispense sentences - can try to keep the peace.

Cassandra Anderson is a new recruit to the Judges who has already failed one evaluation. She has been given a second chance due to her powerful psychic powers and Judge Joe Dredd, one of the city's most effective Judges, has been assigned to undertake her second evaluation. Anderson's test takes place in Peach Trees Block, a kilometre-high residential block of eighty thousand people, which has been taken over by a criminal gang and turned into a drugs factory. The two Judges have two hundred floors to ascend and countless obstacles in their way...and no back-up.

Dredd is the second attempt to make a live-action movie based on the extremely popular Judge Dredd comic book. First appearing in 2000AD in the late 1970s, Judge Dredd is a satire on police procedurals and action movies. In particular, it pokes fun at the fascistic idea of single 'good' police officers being trusted to carry out law enforcement without oversight (something presented as laudable in Hollywood cop movies of the 1970s and 1980s, with 'good' policemen being hampered by bureaucratic officials from doing What Is Right in their eyes). Another film version was made in 1995 starring Sylvester Stallone in the title role. Whilst the 1995 moved nailed the offbeat, demented feel of Mega-City One in the comics and had some great (if impractical) production design, it was a failure in the departments of story, character and Rob Schneider. The 2012 film improves upon it in almost every department (starting with the laudable decision to not cast Rob Schneider) to deliver a highly entertaining action movie.

Playing Dredd this time out is Karl Urban (or, more accurately, Karl Urban's Chin), who brings the requisite amounts of gravitas and presence to the role without descending into camp (as Stallone had a tendency to on occasion). He doesn't wisecrack (though a couple of his deliberately-understated reactions are quite amusing) but gets about business with relentless, grim efficiency. Dredd is presented as a force of nature. Staying true to the comics, he does not remove his helmet (unlike Stallone) and is presented as the faceless embodiment of The Law. However, he does have a highly practical and more flexible side to him, as shown by his willingness to ignore minor crimes, like vagrancy, whilst investigating much more serious ones. One of the limitations from the comic is that Dredd's character changes very slowly, only over years or decades, whilst writer Alex Garland only has an hour and a half to work with here. He can only hint that Dredd's opinions and character has been changed by his experiences in the block and with Anderson in the final scenes, but this is actually successful. Dredd himself looks surprised - or as surprised as a chin can be - by his final decision in the film which reflects his experiences.

Olivia Thirlby plays Anderson with understatement. Anderson is a rookie who takes the carnage of dispensing justice on the streets with much less stoicism than Dredd, but is not presented as weak, only inexperienced. Anderson's psi abilities allow her to take courses of action that Dredd simply never considers (and usually rather less violent ones) and are used in a manner that makes sense: an elaborate deception and trap that is laid for her fails in a rather spectacular fashion. With Dredd not evolving much as a character over the course of the film, it's Anderson whose character evolution and arc is more central to the film and this is handled well by the writer and actress.

Opposing both is Lena Headey as 'Ma-Ma' Madrigal, the gang leader who has effectively taken over the block. Ma-Ma is presented as an utterly ruthless criminal whose backstory (one of abuse before killing her abuser and taking over his crime empire) is not allowed to excuse her actions. She is a sociopathic monster rather than a scheming villain, which would not fit in well with the film's stripped-down atmosphere. Headey does some excellent work with the material she's given, though we actually spend a lot more time with Wood Harris (noted for his role as Avon Barksdale in The Wire). Though given a fairly limited character, Harris also does some good work, particularly in his psychic sparring scenes with Anderson where he tries to shock her with mental imagery only for Anderson to turn them back against him.

The film has a laid-back, minimalist atmosphere. In early scenes this is disappointing, with Mega-City One looking suspiciously like a mildly CGI-enhanced versions of Johannesburg (where the movie was filmed). The crazy exuberance of the city in the comic, which is the one thing the 1995 movie did get right, is simply not present here and Mega-City One becomes just another characterless, futuristic cityscape. In particular, presenting the blocks as being massively spaced out means that the Block Wars of the comics are simply not possible now. However, this minimalism does work well once Dredd and Anderson hit the block and the mayhem kicks in. The aliens and robots of the setting are not in evidence, with Dredd and Anderson instead having to take on a tower full of human criminals (a tower considerably larger in volume than the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, for comparison's sake) in a focused hour or so of combat scenes and psychological warfare. Aside from a few moments that don't make sense (like a certain scene with three miniguns which is not only gratuitous, but completely pointless) these scenes are directed with energy, vigour and an awful lot of CGI blood.

CGI is used sparingly throughout the film, with real explosions, bullets and models preferred. The most notable special effect sequences are those involving the 'Slo-Mo' sequences, where time is slowed down to a fraction of its normal rate by drugs. These add an air of balletic elegance that counterpoint the more frenetic action scenes. The film's score is also a success, with stripped-down industrial tracks giving way to more appropriately atmospheric mood pieces during the Slo-Mo scenes.

Overall, Dredd (****) is a film that overcomes a low budget and limited premise though excellent performances (even by the bit-players), some impressive effects and a relentless pace, helped by a concise running time. Though the film's disappointing box office performance - which in the UK at least could be attributed to a crazy decision to not show the film in 2D in most cinemas - makes a sequel unlikely, I for one would welcome a return for Karl Urban's take on the lawman.",1358380800,4,6878,4.995636998254799

The impressive thing was how subtly Dredd is humanized and turns out to be likeable as a fair-minded and tough lawman in the most wild of wild-west locales, not because he seeks to subjigate the weak or dominate opponents but because Mega-City One is teetering on the edge of collapse and the Law is the last strand of a decaying and frayed rope holding society in place.

The conceptualization of Mega City was excellent CGI, I have no complaints. The weapons in this film are absolutely monster. The film is very violent. There is plenty of action, shooting, and blood in the film. There is not really any nudity.

END OF SPOILERS:

""Dredd"" looks very nice on Blu-ray even though it's only one disc and includes both the 3D Blu-ray, regular Blu-ray as well as special features. The 3D is particularly effective with nice separation and detail throughout is crisp. The regular edition also has good depth as well as exceptionally good fine detail and the blacks aren't crushed (since this is a dark looking film that's important to insure that fine detail is crisp throughout).

The lossless audio puts you smack dab in the middle of the action but dialogue remains crystal clear. We also get English subtitles.

The description put together by Amazon is inaccurate about the special features: ""Mega-City Masters: 35 Years of Judge Dredd"" a featurette that covers the comic history of Dredd;""Day of Chaos: The Visual Effects of Dredd 3D"" which is self explanatory. There are also shorter pieces including ""Dredd"" which is basically a promo piece on the film, one on set design entitled ""Welcome to Peach Trees"" and ""Dredd's Gear"". Rounding out the special features are a motion comic prequel and ""The 3rd Dimension"" about the 3D shooting.

It would have been nice to have a commentary track but what we do get in the way of special features are pretty good.

That said, if you can handle the unrelenting violence, uncompromising, unflinching, you will likely find this to be one of the best films in this category that you will ever see.

The protagonists: MaMa is pure, unadulterated evil - she knows it and she knows you know... very creepy villain - 94%
Judge Dredd - we never see his face. So, as a result, as was attempted in V, he becomes anyone, everyone.. nicely done 92%
The Rookie - as we never see the Judge's face, we never ""don't see"" the Rookie's she doesn't wear a helmet... nice dichotomy which extends into the idea of innocence vs experience.... Dredd is still *good* but he has no illusions about the world he lives in while you feel the Rookie may: 91%
Ambience: IF you can get past the violence [my wife was not able to do so] and accept the movie on it's own terms, it *will* draw you in... 92%

4797551,5,B005LAII7G,"I think this movie wasn't marketed well enough, I can't really say for the USA, I live Europe I didn't see any Advertising here, This is in my opinion why this movie flopped at the box office. I thought this film was better than Looper, Total Recall and The Bourne Legacy, I will go as far as saying it was better than Skyfall, much better. I watched this movie 3 times and I really loved it. I think it was spot-on what Dredd is like, I have some comics on him and I think they nailed it. People are complaining about the story line, what do they want, Cloud Atlas? Confusing plot? To much going on at the same time? No! you keep it somewhat simple, with twists here and there, like with the lock-down/Vulcan Cannon scene on level 76. Look at the Avenger movie, people knew who the bad guy was thru out the movie and they knew what was going to happen, did anybody actually believe Loki would win? No, we just didn't know how he was going to lose. Same with The Dark Knight rising, Keeping things simple and basic added with an element of surprise/shock/suspense, this works well when its done right, I love these last two films I just mentioned. It irks me when people give a good movie 1 star just because the 3D on the Blueray doesn't work right or to some effect pertaining to the disk rather the movie it self, two words ""return it"" Another thing, one reviewer said he watched 5 minutes 25 seconds, then fell asleep only to awake at the end of the movie and then he gives it 3 star because he thought it was boring. This guy didn't even watch half of the movie. If you don't like this film and its not your cup of tea, I understand, but, please, be insightful as to why when you write an review, some people might not like the extreme blood and gore, which is understandable, but don't be idiotic and childish when writing about a movie you don't like. Anyways, excuse the rant, The score/music for Dredd is just purely awesome. I hope the Blueray and DVDs make up for the loss and they make a sequel.",1358294400,2,2007,4.28421052631579

I was bored so much that I started reading my wifes magazines on the table in front of me. The fact is they could have cast Steve-o and whoopie Goldberg, and the story would have worked. There was no reason for this to be a Dredd movie. It's like they took the opening sequence from Stallones movie, and stretched it out over a couple hours.

Look at all those gold stars. It's an overwhelmingly positive reaction. Makes you wonder why it didn't soar at the cinema.
I loved the comics as a kid, I liked the Stallone film, but this time around, it's taken to another level.
My only complaint would be that it's not a bigger budget, enough to explore mega city one, but that said, if a studio did put more money in to it, then there would be nervous execs wanting to make it more mass appeal, so it would have been a different film, undoubtedly less violent. Here, those constraints are not evident, so no specacular epicness of the world, but buckets of brutality. It made Dredd a hard hitting visceral experience, and it works very well indeed.
The writing is clever enough to justify the limited scope, and the film works in terms of flow and plot. Two judges, one a legend, one a rookie, trapped in a confined space with no escape, a psycho gang intent on killing them. It's an inspired piece.
I've read comparisons with Nolan's Batman, but Dredd does what Batman can't. Personally, I find Batman limited on lots of levels, Dredd is a far superior character, and this is a far superiour film than any Batman offering.
The scope for Dredd is huge, if only it were given the oppertunity. Everyone's hoping for sequels, me included. The potential is fantastic.

The chemistry of Dredd and Anderson was top notch; with Anderson being the perfect counter balance to Dredd stern personality. As the movie progressed, the development of Anderson felt appropriate considering the events that embedded her. Although the story line was as basic, that was all the movie needed. Being the first movie(and a character I've never heard of) it did a great job of introducing the environment and characters as a first movie should. The action in the movie stolel the show. The slow motion effects were all appropriate and done at the right times. Seeing a bullet entering a bad guy in slow motion was gruesome but awesome. The only shortcomings of the movie was they should have invested more time developing Mama. At times Mama felt more like an obstacle than a villain. When Mama did get screen time, she was cold and demeaning.

4797825,5,B005LAII7G,"Now THIS is how the Judge should be shown! This movie RULES! I think all these big time directors and producers in Hollywood need to look at this movie all around. I would challenge the acting in this movie to any (as far as pure action/ sci-fi) and even some ""serious"" movies that seem to always get nominated for awards. This movie has substance and a great story. The acting is well above average also. No intelligence robbing, obvious one liners, just all Dredd business!

I read Dredd (2000 AD) growing up and the pure gritty-ness of this movie portrays just how our society will someday feed on each other just like the comics showed. The best part is this doesn't portray some radical over the top post apocalyptic view of our world, but it seems like a not too distant one. The way the movie makers made you feel like this could be your life as soon as tomorrow was a huge attraction to this film. Most can usually tell what direction a movie is going in or the characters' emotions being played out, NOT Dredd! You won't have a clue to what is going to happen next or who its going to happen to and that is rare for sci-fi.

With the ridiculous collection of sci-fi films that I own (from the original When Worlds Collide to the rebooted Total Recall and everything in-between), this rates pretty high up there. I've read some folks' comments on the effects and how they are not that great, but I completely disagree. The work that went into some of the shots and lighting are amazing! And not to be a total downer, but man, if your tripping on mushrooms or some other wild stuff, Dredd will definitely blow your mind!

This is not a movie to dissect, this is one to just sit back to, let your imagination go and hang the hell on! I guarantee you'll be screaming ""mama"" when your done watching!",1358208000,4,1803,4.408408408408408

No great victory has been won, that - in fact - for Judge Dredd, this was just one more day, and no matter how exceptional it may see to us, it is a very ordinary day for him.  I think it is a very, very dark future portrayed, but it reminds me of the following passage from Patrick Devlin:

""What is the relationship between crime and sin, between the Church and the Law?  I have spoken of the criminal law as dealing with the minimum standards of human conduct and the moral law as dealing with the maximum.  The instrument of the criminal law is punishment, those of the moral law are teaching, training, exhortation.  If the whole dead weight of sin were ever to be allowed to fall upon the law, it could not take the strain.  If at any point there is a lack of clear and convincing moral teaching, the administration of the law suffers.""

This movie, while extreme, illustrates the  consequences of allowing the ""whole dead weight of sin"" to fall upon the law ... and the law alone.  It is a cautionary tale.",1358208000,,1136,4.357142857142857

4797954,5,B005LAII7G,"""Dredd"" was perhaps the most underrated film of 2012; actually, that might not be entirely true, as critics gave it rave reviews. The underrated quality of the film comes from its box office pull: a few million shy of its production cost. The main problem here, as far as anyone can tell, was that too many people associated the film with the previous ""Judge Dredd"", starring Sylvester Stallone. That movie was awful, and it's a shame this film suffered because of it.

The plot of the movie is extremely straightforward: in the future, civilization has experience a bit of a backlash and everyone lives in large ""Mega Cities"". The policing force are known as ""judges"", and are given the power of judge, jury, and executioner. The film follows a day in the life of the toughest judge around, Judge Dredd (portrayed brilliantly by Karl Urban). On this particular day, Judge Dredd is given a new psychic recruit to evaluate (Olivia Thirlby) and is locked in a 200 story slum under the control of ruthless gang leader Ma-Ma (Lena Headey, of Game of Thrones fame). Judge Dredd and his new recruit Judge Anderson must fight to survive 200 stories of gang members.

""Dredd"" succeeds on many levels: it's a perfect comic book adaptation, faithful to its origins; it's a superb action film; it's terrifically acted, if you can catch the tongue-in-cheek approach of the film; and it's just so damn enjoyable. And really, that's the point of a movie, right? To provide and exciting, enjoyable experience for and hour and a half or two? ""Dredd"" is definitely a movie that scores in every way.",1358121600,,1581,4.787545787545787
4797955,5,B005LAII7G,"Ask yourself this, do you like the first RoboCop film?

 If you answered yes then this is the movie for you, but if you answered no then this picture is one that you should avoid. It really is that simple.

 I don`t know what the nay-sayers are thinking. Did they expect to see a film as deep and character driven as Gone With the Wind or a story as fleshed out and diverse as Citizen Kane?

 What you see is what you get and Dredd advertised itself as just that; an action movie that delivers tons of action that will keep you entertained for the duration of its running time.

 It`s a film that is meant for Judge Dredd fans in terms of story (As it remained true to a story you would find in the comic book), and thrill seeking audiences in terms of action; nothing else.

 The actors do a fine job with their characters and are more than competant in their acting skills keeping whats unfolding on the screen flowing smoothly and tense (Someone in the reviews section said that the acting was some of the worst that they`d seen, but the cast weren`t a bunch of actors overacting or giving the performance of a lifetime that will nab them an Oscar; they acted believably in the roles they were assigned and carried their performances perfectly. Nothing more, nothing less).

 The direction is both artful in terms of the fast paced scenes that transpire and also in terms of the beauty that is shown through the slow motion footage (The saying Poetry in Motion comes to mind for the latter).

 The CGI/Special Effects are amazing in the graphic violence they portray and the beauty they convey when the Slo-Mo drug is being used (There are many more mentions that I could go into throughout the movie but the examples would turn into a laundry list so I`ll leave it to your viewing experience to see for yourself).

 My only gripe with Dredd is the soundtrack but thats only because I`m not a Techno fan so the fault lies with me and not the movie; but other than that thats it.

 Here`s what Dredd has going against it (Or so I`m assuming), its a picture made for the fans of the comic book and not for the general audience of theater goers. Those out there that aren`t fans and have no concept or interest in the comic won't get it but for those who are fans of the comic and have been waiting for an honest depiction of Judge Dredd will.

 I think the film will win some fans over from the Action genre audience, and from some of the positive reviews that I`ve read Dredd has; but for those who came to see something more than just an Action movie they will be disappointed in what Dredd has to offer because it only has to present what it always advertised; Action and Adventure; and sometimes thats enough.",1358121600,3,2714,4.39

I missed the futuristic flying cars, and robots, and mutants of Stallone's movie because I love that type of stuff, and Stallone's uniform almost perfectly matched the comics, but this movie was so much better, as far as plot and characters.  Production design and cityscapes felt like we could live in this world in my lifetime, and I found that to be really scary, and it made me nervous the whole movie (in a good way).  After watching the extras on the Blu Ray, I feel like they made a very faithful adaptation of the character, and stayed true to who he is.  Karl Urban is one of my favorite actors, and he did a fantastic job at being a badass. Lena was great as Ma-Ma.  I don't think there was a poor performance by anyone in this movie.  It was VERY gory (really earned that R rating), and had some innovative kills, if you like that sort of thing.  Slow motion shots were impressive, and I'd love to see it on a 3D tv.  One of the highest compliments I could pay is to the CGI, as I often could not tell that some of the city or the main building, Peach Trees, was computer animated (only realized it after watching featurettes, and I always look for CGI during a movie).  These filmakers should be very, very proud of what they did with the limited budget they had.  I would definetely recommend it to action movie fans, and would see the sequel in theaters, if they get to make one.  It wasn't just a shoot 'em up, as the Judges had to use their wits and skills to make it out alive, not just their guns (which when used, were awesome).  The mini-gun scene was so visceral and real, it was fantastic.

Botton line - I bought it at full price without seeing it before purchase, and I'm glad I did.  No regrets.  I actively regret not seeing it in theaters in 3D.  I hope there is a sequel with a higher budget.",1358121600,3,2008,4.239473684210527

4798113,5,B005LAII7G,"This is a solid, no frills action movie. The plot is not hugely innovative or original, but is well executed and, more importantly, acts as a worthy vehicle for Karl Urban's excellent performance as Dredd. If you saw the travesty and that was Sylvester Stallone's 1995 outing and were as disgusted as you OUGHT to have been, then you'll be pleased to hear that Urban's performance in this movie will rinse the bad taste from your mouth.",1358121600,,436,4.675324675324675
4798114,4,B005LAII7G,"Much in the same blood splatter appeal as the visually spectacular, ""Punisher War Zone,"" the 2012 version of the ""Dread"" reboot masterfully pulls the character from the pages of the comic book to the big screen and soaks that with buckets of dripping grit and grime. With that wash, expect ""Dredd"" to be one of those cult classics, a film that did poorly at the box office, but gets a second life as a repeat playback worthy of multiple views.

And views it provides - everything about the film fits within the stylishly lavish CGI world, though with a minuscule budget in relation to other adaptions, director Pete Travis stretches the American dollar, body count for body count. The story line itself, penned by John Wagner and Carlos Ezquerra, is really a simplistic and straightforward plot approach that rewards audiences with a more by the books Dredd, who lead Keith Urban plays with hardened appeal. Olivia Thirlby helms Anderson in her own poker faced way, giving substance to Dredd's special abilities sidekick partner. And of course, there's Ma Ma, who Lena Headey does so with quiet, but violent tendencies.

A bit of warning: those who come in with a blind buy mentality might find themselves in the cross hairs of a flick with certain and particular, say 'comic book' expectations. Unfortunately, those expectations will definitely be shot down by the disappointment they'll feel of a film considered by them to be complete chaos. Sure, it feels a little longer than it should. However, others will know this is the version of Dredd they've been waiting for, a film pure of unadulterated action bliss, a shoot-em up that will appeal to both fans of the comic and those who enjoy it for it is: a slow burn of a satisfying thrill ride.",1358121600,2,1747,4.8006644518272426
4798115,5,B005LAII7G,"This movie really caught me off guard, its set up is simple but it offers great moments of both brutal bleak action and strong characterization from the two leads and the villian. It never looses it focus with no truly weak parts.",1358121600,,230,4.5
4798116,5,B005LAII7G,"Number one, i do not enjoy seeing movies in 3D in the theaters, because A) i wear glasses and 3D glasses don't fit well over them. so the whole movie i am uncomfortable fiddling with them. and B) the 3D glasses make the screen darker, and you lose detail. and i don't see that big of a difference.
But Dredd was one of the only 3D movies that i completely enjoyed, and feel like i got my money worth, the 3D was awesome, and i feel like this is one of the only movies that you should have seen in 3D over the 2D version.
I have never read the Judge Dredd comics, but i knew who he was, and the Stallone version ruined my interest in Dredd, so when i saw this faithful remake was coming out i was excited that Dredd would get a pretty cool kick ass adaptation. Karl Urban does a great job on Dredd, and he keeps the Helmet ON, he isn't like the Vain Stallone who had to show his face the whole movie, Dredd never takes his helmet off. this movie stays true to that.
This movie is AMAZING, and a movie i feel that i can watch over and over again, the action is plentiful, the story moves along well, the characters are great, the Slo-MO is the big highlight of the movie, and the Score is really good. if you have the choice to buy one movie this month this would be the movie to get. GET DREDD!!
i am disappointed that Dredd did not perform well in theaters, but that is because America does not really know the Judge Dredd comic's, so they ignored it. but you don't need to be a comic fan to enjoy this Great movie, that i feel is very faithful to the source material. i really do hope that they make a sequel to Dredd, the movie ends and you want MORE. hopefully Dredd will gain a Cult following in Bluray sales and they will decide to go ahead with another.
So DO NOT Pirate this movie, Dredd deserves every penny, so buy this Bluray, it is awesome, and the Bluray has the standard and 3D versions on the same disc. and it comes with a digital copy too, i travel a lot every weekend, and this is a movie i will put on my iPad and watch on the plane!!!
Dredd is my Favorite movie of 2012 and there were a lot of great movies, but this one made me want more!! i am thinking about reading the Comics too now!

Have a Great day, and i hope this Review helped you buy this KICK ASS movie, that is one of the best Comic book adaptations to date! :)",1358121600,,2344,4.040860215053764

From the stunning 3D slo-mo (no pun intended) action sequences to the solid story line that stays true to it's comic book counterpart, this adaptation is well worth the watch. The score is very interesting and fits perfectly into the narrative and no corn-ball acting, as seen in the old sly version, is to be found. This movie takes itself seriously and by all means it should. If you want to invest in a flick that will do your 3D tv justice or just add a solid entry into your blu-ray collection, Dredd delivers.

Given up on finding the middle ground between Christopher Nolan and Michael Bay?

If any of these problems seem familiar, check out Dredd: one of my favorite action movies since Starship Troopers.  It carefully walks that razor-thin line between not requiring too much thought and not insulting your intelligence--big and dumb without assuming that you are.

4798278,4,B005LAII7G,"I didn't bother watching the old Judge Dredd. Newer movies are better at making the future look good anyway. It bothered me a little that we never saw Dredd's full face - it made him seem like he was supposed to be a generic character. His overly breathy/creaky voice (like a character out of a 1940s film noir) furthered the impression. Maybe that's what they were going for?

The rookie cop is pretty easy on the eyes. We never see her wearing the judge helmet. There is some plot device about it making it too hard for her to use her senses. This works out okay, because there is only so much emotion Dredd can pump out without us being able to see his eyes. She also figures out pretty early on that Dredd's primary motivation is that he's a psycho. This is not surprising, given what he spends all day doing, and his permanent frown.

The environments are nicely put together. If you want to spend a while looking at the dystopian future, this is worth a rent. Since they put some effort into making the graphics nice, get it in HD if you have something capable of 1080p. I wouldn't outright buy it unless you're seriously into this kind of thing, though.

4798283,4,B005LAII7G,"So I am not a big fan of all the remakes of old 80's and 90's movies.  Example of that would be the new ""Total Recall"", which in my opinion was not as good as the original, just had better effects.  And that was my concern for this movie.  However, I think this modern day ""Dredd"", did a much better job telling a story and in presentation.  The original ""Judge Dredd"" from the 90's was very campy I thought.  ""Dredd"" does a better job of staying true to the original comic indention and has a much darker and gritter feel. The story line and character development are much better as well.

Granted Dredd as a character, doesn't have much character development, but the rookie does, and the movie seems to be more about her than Dredd.  Which I thought was well done.  And the two kinda played off each other.  Dredd, being the 'by the book justice' and the rookie Anderson showing more compassion.  Which leads to the underlining them of the movie, should justice be dispensed coldly or compassionately.  Yeah its kinda a stretch for an action movie with a lot of violence. But I thought the underling question and theme was done well.

So the guts of the most reviews is ""should I spend the money to rent or buy this movie?""  Yes.  It is entertaining, better then the old one, and well presented, and worthy of you hard earned cash.",1358035200,,1334,4.436213991769547

A drug dealer and determined to take over the city.  It's the straight forward plot that drives the movie forward.  There are no Stallone like moments in this film. Dredd has his helmet on the entire movie!

I picked up a copy of Dredd [3D Blu-Ray w/Ultraviolet] on January 12, 2013 from Best Buy. That night we tried to watch the movie only to discover that the disc will not read on our 3D Blu-Ray Panasonic BDT110 or PS3. Both players had up-to-date firmware and have had no problems reading recent 3D Blu-Rays, including Frankenweenie and Avengers. In an effort to do a complete troubleshooting I unboxed our old Samsung P2550 Blu-Ray player (one of the first produced) and although it took 5 minutes to load the 2D version of the movie would play. Since I did not buy this movie just for the 2D feature I will be returning the product to the store today, and while I was considering an exchange to make sure it wasn't a bad on-off disc I've changed my mind since reading several comments on Blu-Ray and Hi-Def forums reporting similar problems (also including missing menus and sound dropout after 30 minutes). Beware, if you have a PS3 or Panasonic player this movie will not load.",1358035200,7,1245,4.4801762114537445

4798349,4,B005LAII7G,"Dredd is a great example of what truly creative people can do on a limited budget. It is also a good example of remakes that actually work. Great acting, great effects, great action. This particular version of Dredd is steeped a bit more in reality, thus you won't see the crazy futuristic qualities of the Stallone version. ( The Stallone versions one redeeming quality was its set designs, which were dead on perfect for Mega city one.) The new Dredd, does include some futuristic backdrops, but it doesnt linger on them for long, instead giving us an intimate, simple story, jam packed with great action, that takes place inside one mega building. No flying spaceships, no war robots......just Dredd and his rookie partner, on a call that goes bad. 2 Against hundreds. Dredd is very violent. The filmakers do not candy coat the violence in this world.......thank goodness. Dredd isn't a pg 13 kiddie show.
  One of my favorites of the year. I'm not giving it 5 stars for nitpicking issues. The score could have been better, and the main villian needed a bit more back story. But again, just nitpicks and in the end, just my personal opinion. Oh, and the 3D is excellent in this, partly due to the slow motion sequences, allowing the 3D to really shine.",1358035200,,1255,4.7
4798350,4,B005LAII7G,"This film having eschewed cheesy dialogue and Rob Schneider, made it instantly superior. The ""Day in the life of"" script, and choice of villains, kept the movie well grounded IMO. It felt like contemporary police dramas we have all seen before. But the ""futuristic"" elements. enhance the action, instead of distracting you from it. The violence is brutal and graphic at times, so not for the little ones.

 On the downside: It inspires some of the same frustrations I have with many other films. I will not include spoilers; you will likely understand what I am referring to, once you have watched it . They are the garden variety frustrations along the lines of ""Why didn't you....?""  ""You could have just....""  stuff.

4798421,5,B005LAII7G,"Movie - 5.0

I don't remember much about 1995's Judge Dredd. I did like it, but probably more for the dark and dreary futuristic sci-fi atmosphere it had and the fact that it starred Stallone rather than anything else. I remember Diane Lane, Armand Assante, Max Von Sydow, and even Rob Schneider (*bleh*). I remember those kick-ass Lawgivers, some really cool set pieces (a prison out in the middle of a desert, I think), and that's about it. Needless to say, I was just a kid back then and my cinematic sensibilities have grown a lot since that time, which brings us to this reboot. The world has irradiated itself from nuclear war. The earth is all but a barren wasteland, with its remaining inhabitants crowded into Mega-Cities. Mega-City One's population is 800 million, with its territory stretching from Boston to Washington D.C. Amongst the crowded chaos stands one force to bring order; a force that serves as jury, executioner, and Judge. On a day when Dredd (Karl Urban) is assigned rookie, Cassandra Anderson (Olivia Thirlby), for assessment, they would get more than they bargained for on her first day. In response to an initial homicide call at the city block of Peach Trees, they also discover a drug ring run by a woman called Ma-Ma (Lena Heady). But she won't have the Judges taking one of her men into custody. And in an attempt to thwart them, she seals the block's blast doors, leaving the Judges to fend for themselves as they battle to survive.

Since the old Dredd, I've discovered a lot of interesting titles that make this movie the bleak and desolate sci-fi actioner that it is. Not that I'm saying any of these films are directly responsible for what you see here, but I like to think they helped contribute. These movies are: Blade Runner, Training Day, V for Vendetta, and Punisher: War Zone. This new Dredd takes some of the dystopian elements of Blade Runner, not so much the sense of prowess and ingenuity for its time, but similarly in that the future is a dirty, grimy, and post-Apocalyptic one. The Training Day reference is seen in how Dredd teaches Anderson to make her own judgement calls, how those decisions can turn out (for better or worse), and ultimately ponders the morality of what can and can't be done within the legal system. The Punisher: War Zone similarity comes in the excessive style and mentality of the hyper-violence. Here, you have Dredd working on the side of the law. But the law, in fact, allows him to brandish his own (bloody) justice based on their rules and his own judgement, much like the Punisher does as a vigilante, only the Punisher worked outside of the law. Then, there's V for Vendetta which, for the most part, was about anarchy (or anarchy in the sense of ""freedom,"" if you go by the movie). Where V fought to break out of authority, I see Dredd as the exact opposite in that he fights to achieve it. As lawless and degenerate as the world of Dredd is, I'm fascinated by this contrasting view that manages to tell all of these things in 90 minutes of action-packed goodness. And because of that, I now regard this as one of my all-time favorite films.

Dredd was shot using 3 kinds of digital cameras: the Phantom Flex, which shoots at a rate of over 3,000 frames per second capturing every little detail for slow-moving, jaw-dropping clarity, as seen from all the obvious effects in the Slo-Mo sequences; the Red One MX, which captures images at 4.5K resolution and is currently the highest-quality camera of its class at the moment; and the Silicon Imaging SI-2K, a favorite of DP (director of photography), Anthony Dod Mantle, that shoots at a native resolution of 2K and was used in collaboration for both of Danny Boyle's Slumdog Millionaire and 127 Hours (of which the first won an Oscar for its cinematography). Case in point: they shot this movie using some pretty top-notch cameras, and it definitely makes a difference. Not to mention, with such a masterful and skilled DP like Mantle working on, frankly, the most popular comic book franchise to ever come out of England, a visual feast is to be expected. The result was an excellent 2D image. But the fact that this was shot in 3D is what makes the film even more of a unique experience.

I saw Dredd in theaters twice, of which both viewings were in 3D. So seeing it at home on BD is actually my first time ever seeing it in 2D. That being said, the 2D presentation is near-perfect. The beauty of Dredd being shot with all these cameras means that the negative format is completely digital, so transferring it to BD was a cinch. Clarity is spectacular showing all the little lines and details in the sets, props, costumes, and texturing. Dredd's face (at least what's shown of it) and all the Judges uniforms look razor-sharp. In particular, I really like how you can see the stubble on Dredd's face and the lines above his lips with that signature scowl. The black levels give the film a very gritty feel and and balance perfectly with the contrast to show just enough detail within the frame, but also withholds enough to give the movie a kind of edginess. The color scheme is very monochromatic, though I'd say it helps create the bleak, desolate atmosphere that Dredd is supposed to be. It consists mostly of dark reds, blacks, dingy greys, and mustard greens, but I like the effect it gives the story. Alternatively, the colors become very exaggerated during the Slo-Mo sequences, where the crew wanted to create a surreal, almost artistic, sense of depth in conjunction to what the the drug is actually supposed to do to your brain. On the downside, since the movie was shot in Stereo (Stereoscopic 3D), it gives way for some video anomalies: the non-Red One MX-shots have a little bit of digital noise in them, colors and detail seem a bit off in some shots, and the obvious 3D effects simply don't register on a 2D viewing plane. So if you can, I highly recommend you watch this in 3D by default.

3D - 5.0

And now to the good stuff. Lately, I've been going through and sampling a lot of 3D movies to compare depth, pop, and overall effectiveness just to see how one 3D movie can differ from another. Most of the 3D movies I own were shot in native 3D, with I think, The Avengers being being the one lone converted-3D title I tried out with the rest. And after lots of sampling, I've come to the conclusion that for all the excuses I hear for 3D merely being a ""gimmick,"" it ultimately comes down to artistic creativity and how the director and production crew decide to present their movie. In the case of Dredd, after watching the special feature on the movie's visual effects, I have to say I commend the approach Mantle took with his first-ever attempt at filming in 3D. The world of Dredd is a confined one. The world was blown to hell, and what remaining 800 million people there are have to bundle into one Mega-City that only stretches so far along the Eastern Seaboard. Knowing this, Mantle purposely utilizes the effect of closeups to help accentuate the nature of this confinement and isolation. I feel this gives the film an extra sense of depth just by itself and that it does a great job creating separation between the fore-, middle-, and background.

As for the more commonplace 3D elements (i.e. the ""pop"" effect). The film takes advantage of this mostly during the Slo-Mo sequences. Smoke floating, bullets flying, and blood, glass, and water splattering, shattering, or splashing look especially breath-taking when combining the frame rate of the Phantom Flex, the exaggerated color scheme, and the layering of 3D to create a true thing of beauty in an otherwise ""ugly"" world of a story. This particular visual aspect adds a whole new dimension to the storytelling, and provides a great counterpoint to the hyper-violence rampant throughout. Coincidentally, all the digital noise and off-color anomalies that are present in the 2D version are pretty much absent in 3D. And I have to say that in comparison to what I saw in theaters (which used a Sony 4K projector), seeing this on an LED flat-panel screen looks even better. The brightness of the LED lighting makes a huge difference in detail, which I'm willing to sacrifice a little size and blacks for, so definitely give this a chance in a home theater setup if you thought the video was a little too murky back in the cinemas.

Being an action movie on top of everything else, Dredd has a remarkably aggressive audio design that really puts the viewer in a bubble of sound throughout its entire duration. While guns firing, bullets ricocheting, and structures crumbling make up the forefront of this chaotic mix, it's Paul Leonard-Morgan's pulsating electronic score that really enhances the mood. Much like Hans Zimmer's work for the action sequences in The Dark Knight, the score acts as a sound effect in itself to help give the film a unique sound. In the case of Dredd, I feel the music gives it a sort of ""driving force"" that can double as either a representation of Dredd, the character, or the kind of world he's living in and trying to defend. The rhythm of these pieces, in turn, end up making a good portion of the movie fly by before you know it. But of course, as a fan of action movies I won't deny the bad-assery of all the shooting, explosions, and blood splattering all over the place either. In terms of pure immersive audio, you couldn't ask for anything better.

As for the actual quality of sound from the speakers, it's perfect. Dialogue is at a very clear and discernible level that not only emanates from the center, but occasionally through the front, side, and rear channels as well. Dynamic range is stellar from the piercing sound of bullets to the low end of the music making for a sonic treat. Separation offers up some pretty intense moments when the Judges are having shootouts with stuff blowing up from this and that speaker and the music resonating through or along with it from the others. Side and rear channels have excellent directionality dividing proper placement of effects such as bullets flying from one side of the screen to the other, crowds of people scrambling to safety, or vehicles driving across the road. And last, but not least, are the LFEs (low frequency effects). Bass is pounding from the constant rhythm of the score and the frequent discharge of the Lawgivers, with an even more boisterous display of this when Ma-Ma and her gang are shooting up a floor with motorized .50-caliber Gatlings. This is definitely a reference track for showing off your home theater setups.

Extras - 2.5

- Mega-City Masters: 35 Years of Judge Dredd (HD; 14:27)
A brief, but very detailed overview of Judge Dredd since his first appearance in Britain's weekly comic book publication, 2000 A.D. The creators and various other writers/artists talk about Dredd's origins (much of the influence coming from Clint Eastwood's Dirty Harry), the symbolism and representation of his character (a stranglehold on order, justice, and authority), and get into particular detail about his design and how they wanted it to be simple, yet macho enough to be the complete embodiment of the law (his helmet mimicking a medieval executioner's mask, with the eagle on his shoulder representing America, or in some cases, fascism). They also discuss Dredd's rise in popularity over the tenure of his existence and how the character itself became an icon amongst British comic book lore. In addition, they also discuss the general worldview of Dredd, the various characters and scenarios he faced, and the different types of stories written over the years (i.e. satires, metaphors, etc.). I honestly wish this segment were double the length, as I'm really interested in learning more about the franchise, now.

- Day of Chaos: The Visual Effects of Dredd (HD; 15:21)
This segment talks mainly about the production design of the movie and the specific style of 3D they wanted to shoot. Initially, all the art and production crew had to work with was a storyboard script (that coincidentally looked like a comic book itself), but still managed to achieve the look and vision that was asked for by using a lot of practical shots throughout South Africa and incorporating sprinkles of CG to make it look like the dirty, grimy, yet massive set piece that is Mega-City One. The inside of Peach Trees was constructed to scale as a set, but only had 3 floors and a quarter of the actual coverage, which they later redressed for different shots and angles. Meanwhile, the 3D aspect was something the crew wanted to do a little differently than most other 3D films. Here, they had more so an intention of creating a surrealist perception of Dredd's world using lots of closeup shots, the occasional Slo-Mo sequence, and other effects to give the viewer a more ""wondrous"" feel, as opposed to the gimmicky ""pop"" most other films have become acclimated to producing. It's a damn shame this and the first segment were all they could afford to make in terms of extras, as I feel there's a lot more work that went into the actual movie that we'll never get to learn about.

- Dredd Featurette (HD; 1:53)
A promotional piece that gives a very basic overview of the film's setting and plot. And it's not even as intriguing as the theatrical trailer. I would say it feels more like those promos they play in the theater like a commercial before the lights go out and the actual trailers even start.

- Dredd's Gear (HD; 2:31)
Again, too brief of a segment that talks about Dredd's police gear, Lawgiver gun, and motor bike.

- The 3rd Dimension (HD; 2:00)
Some quick tidbits about shooting in 3D. Most of it is rehash from the Visual Effects segment.

- Welcome to Peachtrees (HD; 2:33)
Talks about how the production crew wanted use the entire city block set as a ""character"" in the movie.

- Dredd Motion Comic Prequel (HD: 2:57)
Gives a little background info on Ma-Ma and the man that created Slo-Mo.

- Theatrical Trailer (HD; 2:30)

Overall - 4.5

I didn't even know they were doing this remake, let alone how awesome it would be. Dredd is a visually stunning and thoroughly engaging sci-fi actioner with a lot of subtle influences that I feel make it a perfect setup for the world of Judge Dredd. And as well-received as it was by fans and critics alike, it sadly has yet to break even of its production budget to show any kind of profitability. But if you've seen this movie based on a recommendation (mine or someone else's) and like it, do me the favor of spreading the word to anyone you think would like this and try to help the home video sales for a possible sequel. In fact, it's rumored that screenwriter Alex Garland wants to make this a trilogy which, given how great this first installment is, would be a sight to behold. The video specs are excellent in 2D. But the fact of the matter is that you should see this in 3D at least once in your life. Meanwhile, the audio will definitely rock your theater room, so be careful not to disturb anyone if you're watching this late at night. And it's a shame the special features couldn't include more content (like an audio commentary). But hopefully enough word will get out, people will buy this, and we'll see that trilogy yet!",1357948800,17,15490,4.689845474613686

4798423,4,B005LAII7G,"This review doesn't reflect upon Amazon.com or the movie in particular, but rather the actual product; in this case, Dredd on 3D Blu-Ray/Blu-Ray.

I purchased my copy elsewhere, but my Blu-Ray player didn't read the disc. There is only one disc in the box as this disc utilizes new technology combining 3D and standard Blu-Ray on one disc.

I promptly returned it and the customer service rep also tried to play the disc, but met the same results. As I was at the counter, another customer saw that I was returning a Dredd Blu-Ray and mentioned that his player wasn't reading his copy of Dredd either.

Maybe we bought from a bad batch, but just be aware that your player may have problems reading this Blu-Ray 3D/Blu-Ray version of Dredd. I just wished they came out with a Blu-Ray only version. Good luck!

The movie by itself I thought was good enough to buy on Blu-Ray; not many flicks make the cut when having their DVD version replaced with a Blu-Ray copy.",1357948800,3,962,4.575581395348837
4798424,4,B005LAII7G,"Lionsgate's DREDD has proved worth the wait, especially
when you consider the ancient Sylvester
Stallone 1995 effort.  Stallone's film was silly
fun: colorfully violent. In many ways it did capture
the spirit of the helmeted lawman.  The only trouble
was that Sly wore that iconic Dredd helmet for only
twenty minutes, then discarded it for full facials for
the rest of the movie.  And we, who'd grown up with
the ""faceless"" Dredd of the 2000 AD comics, were not
amused.

This DREDD - which received next to no publicity -
is the ""real"" thing; at least it's what we
post-2000 AD fans have become familiar with.  Gone is
the humor (save perhaps a couple of subtle digs from
our judge).  This is a lean, mean tale of Dredd
taking blonde Anderson out on her first street patrol
and both becoming prisoners in the ruinous Peachtree tower.
There they have to face the scarred Ma-Ma who rules
the 200 story building as her own kingdom, and who is
flooding Mega City One with the drug Slo-Mo.

The director's kept all things Dreddy.  An almost faceless
Karl Urban is gruff, perhaps human; Anderson, his student, is
destined for a different department (Psi).  Everything
is dark, everything is Dredd.  Let your eyes drift from the action,
and you'll see hints of Dredd's past: a ""Chopper"" grafitti,
""bent"" Judges, block wars.

It's a worthy flick, a good no-nonsense story. For once
the ""extras"" show us quite a bit more than the usual fluff
stuff.  I particularly liked the nearly fifteen minute
""history"" of Dredd, featuring tons of art and comments by
early Dredd artists Carlos Ezquerra (first to draw
the lawman), Brian Bolland (the ""best"" artist), and comments
by John Wagner (one of the original writers).

I suppose only a true Dredd enthusiast will really
enjoy this (it has a great ending); but for a different kind of
thrill, why not spend an hour and a half in Mega City.
At least you'll come to appreciate The Law - if you
survive.",1357948800,,1936,4.6923076923076925
4798425,4,B005LAII7G,"After watching this ""low budget"" effort to bring the serious Dredd back to the screen I was impressed. The work of Thirlby and Urban should be commended right alongside Headey and Harris and various others this movie rocked and given that with the money constraints and the spectre of the Stallone Dredd hovering over it says alot. Had this $40million dollar film made more than $36 million worldwide we would of been hearing about the second Dredd: Origins and Democracy, The screenwriter talked of a planned trilogy including the third film bringing Judge Death to the screen but alas we will just have this gem that reminds me of 80's movies like Robocop, Road Warrior and Die Hard to look forward to and this movie like those rocked! This day in a life take on Dredd gladly honors the comics and its dark humor. Dredd and a rookie Judge Anderson infiltrate Peach Trees one of several huge housing complexes that is a cross between an apartment complex and a mall where folks could live and die there nevering leaving. What starts as a routine investigation about three skinned bodies that fall from the sky becomes a race to escape with their lives. Anderson who is considered a mutant due to her latent psychic abilities is our eyes that follow the mostly quiet Dredd through the maze of guns and bodies. Like another movie I loved ""The Raid:Redemption"" this movie is fun simple and kick ass with the blood and action. Highly recommended.",1357948800,2,1443,4.73015873015873

For people who don't understand the source material, I can assure you that this movie stays close to it. Judge Dredd would rather die before he takes off his helmet, and his helmet is never removed the entire movie. Most big name actors would never do this (Stallone), But Karl Urban insisted it be this way. His gun is pretty amazing, which you have to see to understand. Without ruining any of the plot, this movie isn't intended to be an end of the world scenario as most action movies usually are. This is a normal day in the life of Judge Dredd, which is akin to the original Die Hard movie, if every single day was like the Nakatomi plaza incident for John McClane. This might scare some people off, as they think the stakes might not be high enough for it to warrant huge explosions and massive firefights. It delivers on both of these quite well.

4798565,1,B005LAII7G,"This was a blind buy having seen so many positive reviews...and was looking forward to it.
I simply couldn't wait until it was over.
Its based on the comic and Ill just take the word for it that it follows it closely.
I found the film to very dry, uninteresting , lack of character depth, just a lot of dull no frills no personality people shooting each other for 90 minutes. Its a drug bust film where Dredd attempts to stop the MaMa gang( or whatever they are called) from spreading this reality altering drugs. I was hoping for something along the lines of Robocop and Die Hard - instead I got the 2013 Manos the Hands of Fate worst film Ive seen yet. 90 minutes of frowning faces as if the characters didn't like being in the film either.
Yes its supposed to be dark, grim, but even Batman had a little light in the darkness. This had nothing going for it. At least to me. Another film that just depends on one's tastes.
Helpful or not, I am just sharing my opinion and should not deter anyone curious enough to watch, such as me for example
I can only say I watched the Blu Ray non 3D version since I do not have the capability. If nothing else, the HD transfer on this film was spectacular.

4798735,5,B005LAII7G,"I expect connoisseurs of the action w/gore genre will pick this review apart, but I'm not writing it for them.  This is for those who enjoy a decent action film and generally don't care for gratuitous blood and generous views of what lies under the bad guy's skin.  That's the kind of action fan I am, Bond, Bourne, Sniper, Jet Li.  I didn't really care for the Expendables; I give that a 'meh'.

Dredd is actually something quite decent.  Yes there is gore, amazing gore in slow motion.  Sure, the plot is so simple you could sum the entire thing up as ""Drug bust... Perps resisted"".  Yeah the lead protagonist has a voice that makes Christian Bale's Batman voice seem melodic.  However, it was a very decent movie.

I enjoyed this movie in several ways.  There are several nice artfully filmed segments.  The action is not over the top Rambo style, but more of a western gunslinger style of shoot out.  The characters do in fact grow on you in spite of the fact that you know almost nothing at all about them.  I don't read the comics so everything I know about Dredd comes from the Sly Judge Dredd movie.  This is a much darker and significantly better movie than the 1995 Dredd film.  Somehow the directing and acting drew me into the characters without making any obvious attempts to get me to like them.  Character development was conspicuously absent, and perhaps that's where the magic is. I was fully satisfied these protagonists.

The climactic finish was mesmerizing.  I wanted to look away, but was spellbound.

I am more interested in what the story has to tell me about the idea of the future than in the actual shooting, mayhem and car crashing.

Even if you are not a fan of the comics you should definitely check out this movie because it harkens back to a more classic style of action movie, where no love story or extraneous plot is needed, just good guys fighting bad guys.

Now for the bad part though, I was incredibly excited about the release of the blu ray but had extensive issues when it came to playability. I own two different blu ray players and the film would not work on either player, it would not even be recognized. This was the case with a total of four copies of the movie and it wasn't just my players, the store that I purchased it from checked all of the copies on almost every blu ray player in the store and could only get it to work on one.

4798741,5,B005LAII7G,"Just a heads up, I'm writing this review as someone who hasn't read the comics or seen the Stallone movie. In fact, all I knew about this franchise beforehand was that the Stallone movie was awful. But as a general movie lover and fan of Karl Urban and Lena Headey, I had hopes that it would at least be fun to watch and have nice visuals.

I never expected to be completely blown away.

I saw this film in theaters twice, once on opening weekend and again a couple weeks later in 3D. After I saw it the first time, I kept thinking about how good it was and my love for it grew in retrospect until I saw it again. And even the second time, with all my built up appreciation for it, I picked up on more subtleties and loved it more.

Plot wise, the movie is great. Nothing out of this world but still engaging and entertaining without falling flat or being cliche. What I love about it is that there aren't too many twists. It's even slightly predictable, which normally I'd think is faulty, but it really works to Dredd's advantage. Because it completely immerses you in the experience. What this movie does extremely well is bring you into Mega City One's atmosphere and lets you experience the suspense.

It's a high stakes cat-and-mouse story line with a concise but intriguing backstory, a temperamental villain with a tendency for extreme violence, and completely ridiculous odds against our heroes. What makes it so special is the extreme scale. This is a city that houses 800 million people (that's almost three times the entire population of the US) in a stretch of land from Washington D.C. to New York. This is a manhunt inside Peach Trees, a half-mile high building the size of a city block. This is two people fighting for their lives and for order in a place where people are either trying to kill them, or couldn't care less what happens to them.

What really shines in this movie is the characterization. We have Dredd, the title character, who strictly sticks to regulations and will take any measure to make sure his job gets done. Anderson, a psychic Judge hopeful, on a pass or fail test in the field. And Ma-Ma, a psychotic gang leader who wants Dredd and Anderson dead at any cost.

What I love about these characters is that they are extremists in an extreme world. They know the stakes, they understand the risks they take, and they have strong convictions about how the world should work. Each of them backs every action they take 150%. No hesitation, no questions.

Another thing that makes the characters of Dredd so special is that the female characters are treated no differently than the male characters, which I find to be especially important.

There are so many films where female characters exist solely to provide character development for male protagonists, or as romantic interests, or as background stories. But in Dredd, they steal the show. Ma-Ma is the most powerful criminal in Peach Trees, the most dangerous leader of the most dangerous gang. She is the law of her world and she will take no prisoners. Anderson is an up-and-comer, she's not even a Judge, but she gets results Dredd wouldn't be able to obtain. She has no qualms about doing her job and the brutality it entails. And get this: her uniform is stylistically and fundamentally exactly the same as Dredd's. They are equals.

I'm actually angry. I'm angry this movie barely made any money, because it's one of the best films I've seen this year. Top Five, easily. And I'm excited to own it because now I can sit down everyone I know, show it to them, and have them love it, too.",1357862400,4,3582,4.584375

4798743,5,B005LAII7G,"Plenty of other reviewers have already said everything possible on what's right about this movie so I'll keep my comments brief.

I really wanted to like the Stallone version, which was terrible, yet did have a lot of great things in it.  It was just ruined by Hollywood camp and overproduction.

This version more than atones for the sins of its predecessor. Story mechanics were basic and uncomplicated, but well managed. Casting was spot-on. Special effects were excellent, with no indication of a smaller budget. In fact, in light of the excesses of Michael Bay or Roland Emmerich, the lack of gratuitous CG was refreshing and provided a greater sense of authenticity.

The action and violence (which was plentiful and frequently gruesome) was also stylized and at times surprisingly elegant.

The characters were treated with respect by the film, showing personality, integrity, and thoughtfulness. No cliches or cardboard cutouts here.

In all, everything I could have hoped for in a Dredd movie. Yet another indicator of how independent studios are breathing new life into an industry that all too often gets it wrong.

More like this one please!

My only criticism has nothing to do with the movie and everything to do with the Amazon instant rental. First, I wanted to watch the movie in HD, which they charge extra for. Then, because I'm trying to watch it using my laptop (High End MacBook with very fast Fiber internet), HD isn't available, though it would be on an array of other lower-end devices (Kindle, XBox, etc.) This is annoying and difficult to understand. At times the streaming was laggy, and just plain locked up, causing me to have to restart my browser and resume, which screws up the whole experience. When I can rent the same movie from RedBox for a buck, and have a much higher quality experience, the convenience premium starts to get weak. Amazon should fix this.",1357862400,,1894,4.896875

4798772,4,B005LAII7G,"It seems that comics have become the mainstay in films these days. With the success of the film adaptations of Marvel characters and Batman, more comic book characters are making their way to the screen. Fans of the British comic 2000 A.D. are well acquainted with Judge Dredd. Not the one we saw years ago with Sylvester Stallone (not bad but no, not like the comic), but the comic character. Dredd is the quintessential tough guy. He takes no guff and deals out justice with extreme prejudice. So that makes him perfect for a new film, this time just known as DREDD.

In the future most of the world is a desolate wasteland. Only 2 cities remain the main one of which is Mega-City One. It is a city filled with people and that means plenty of crime. Crime is so rampant in fact that they've tossed aside the old ways of doing things and now have just one authority in this world: judges. Judges fit everything into one tight package: police officer, judge and executioner. There is no need for a trial, if you break the law the judge will arrest and sentence you on the spot. If you do something as extreme as murder, your execution will take place on the streets with clean up to follow.

One of the most extreme members of this police force is Judge Dredd (Karl Urban). He also happens to be the most effective officer they have. His day today will be different though as he's been assigned a special task: take a new recruit who barely passed the admissions test but has something special about her, telepathy, and rate her performance. If she's effective, she's in but if she fails, she's gone. Dredd meets up with new Judge Anderson (Olivia Thrilby) and off they go.

The film goes for the usual here with the gruff old timer giving the newbie a difficult time. Their first case results in a chase involving a group of drug users racing through town. While Dredd kills a few of these criminals, the rest escape into one of the skyscraper type neighborhoods.

The deaths of the criminals who escaped in a skyscraper type neighborhood leads the Judges to that building.  It turns out to be run by Ma-Ma (Lena Headey), one of the most vicious criminals and drug lords in Mega City One. Ma-Ma is in the process of promoting a new drug to the streets called Slo-mo, a drug that when taken makes the user experience the world in slow motion. When she learns that the Judges have entered the building, she immediately has it shut down and locked up tight and then offers a huge reward for the first person to bring both Judges to her.

This forces the Dredd and Anderson to work their way up the floors of the building in search of Ma-Ma before anyone can collect that reward. And along the way the body count rises as every criminal in the building, and there are plenty of them, tries to collect. Unfortunately for them they have yet to realize how resourceful and deadly Dredd truly is. To put it mildly, Dredd makes Dirty Harry look like a kindergarten cop.

Those of you who recall the review I wrote for a film called THE RAID might think this sounds vaguely familiar and in part it is. Both films have law enforcement officials trapped in a skyscraper filled with criminals out to collect a bounty on their heads. But this one does have a number of differences. While THE RAID had a tad more realism in how its heroes found a way to survive, DREDD has the title character who is the supreme tough guy. Dredd doesn't think twice about shooting someone, he just does it. Anderson also is a plus as her telepathic abilities help them to find out more about just where they're going when they question a captive drug dealer.

If you're an action fan you'll love this movie, the same for fans of the comic. Gone are the humorous touches found in the last version of Dredd, replaced by a performance that is more in line with the comic book. Urban does a fantastic job here, never once feeling the need to remove the classic helmet Dredd wears to show off his smile, grimace or anything else. This is what Dredd should look like and how he should be played. Thrilby does a nice job as well showing her frustration at being judged by someone who clearly has no use for her only to later be the sidekick that he needs.

The movie is filled to the brim with movie violence. Don't rent this one not having a clue about that. Just like the comic, the movie is filled with splatter moments and the blood gushes freely here. It's not a film for the squeamish. But for movie fans, comic fans and Dredd fans, you'll enjoy this movie much more than the Stallone version.",1357776000,,4561,4.446172248803828
4798773,1,B005LAII7G,"I bought this, received it in excellent condition, and immediately found it is not watchable. There are no menus. After sitting through twenty minutes of previews, there was no way to begin movie playback; I am using my laptop and Cyberlink PowerDVD 10 Ultimate, which has handled other Blu-Ray discs adequately.

That was my first go-round. I download the latest update for PowerDVD, got menus, and got to watch the movie. Extremely annoying, but that's apparently what law-abiding purchasers have to deal with these days. The digital download may actually work--but iTunes says ""estimated time 12 hours"" to complete download, so I'm not holding my breath. Since it has to be downloaded anyway, save yourself some dollars and just buy the digital version?

Why do I put that in my review? Because I paid for the package deal. Other people may review the movie--I want the buyer to know that a) there is a way to watch their purchase, b) the process to watch it is annoying, but the movie is so good it's worth some trouble to see. Strong acting, the actors seemed consistent with the characters in the comics I read twenty-five years ago. Very, very good direction and cinematography. It takes balls to be true to Judge Dredd. Some movies are weak on supporting actors, but this one isn't. There are better reviews than mine out there, but if you've read this, I expect you'll be able to enjoy this movie just as much as someone who writes better than me.",1357776000,5,1456,4.728346456692913

The movie looks good on Blu Ray (4/5 for the 2D version) but the DTS HD MA 7.1 soundtrack (5/5) is the real gem on this disc. It is ferocious to say the least. The audio has amazing power and directionality across the entire sound field. This will be a real treat for audiofiles and owners of a beefy home theater system.

4798867,4,B005LAII7G,"Though the original Judge Dredd with Sylvester Stallone was action packed and entertaining for what it was, I'd have to say that I enjoyed this new adaption from the comics much better.  Not only is it a bit more accurate in comparison to the comics, but I also felt that Karl Urban made a much better Dredd as well.

As far as how well it follows the comics, I am not a hundred percent sure because I am honestly not incredible familiar with them...I have only ever read scattered issues before.  However, according to what I have read and heard, this movie follows a few of the comics much better than the original one did.  In fact, as I have read, about the only thing that resembled the comics much at all in the old movie was the view of Megacity One, which was probably about the only thing the new Dredd differed on, giving it more of a feel of District 9, and that's what I thought of 2 when I saw much of what it showed of Megacity One.

Once the movie moves into the tower where much of the movie takes place, it has more of a feel of the original Die Hard and The Raid Redemption from there on out...a little bit Robocop.  The action is good and the movie is altogether engaging and enjoyable.

One thing I've come to understand about Judge Dredd as far as the comics go, it's very very rare that he ever takes his helmet off, and in this movie he really doesn't.  You see him ever so briefly from behind in the beginning of the movie with his helmet off, but it's on the entire rest of the movie.  The original fell short in that sense too because Stallone is not wearing the helmet for at least half the movie.  Not only that but the movie, as far as I know and have read, did not follow the comics hardly at all.  I still gave the original a decent rating because I enjoyed it overall, but as far as I know it fails as far as it's ties to the comics.

This is the best of the 2 though in my opinion, and I really hope that they make at least one or two more of them, so long as the same characters star in them.  The only words of warning I will give is to those of you who are squeemish or don't like heavy violence & gore...stay away from this one.  There is one or two pretty brutal parts and we aren't spared from gore with each person that dies.  However, for those of you sci-fi & action buffs like myself or fans of the comic that aren't phased by gore, I highly recommend giving this movie a watch, if not a buy!

It also deserved to bring in a lot more than it received at the box office and I sincerely hope there is enough financial boost in DVD sales, rentals, etc. to spur another movie.  Would hate for this potential franchise to be laid to rest before being properly judged by others outside of its fan base.  The movie certainly has a darker tone & is much more graphic than its Judge Dredd predecessor, starring Stallone, but pays better homage to the Dredd character and the world surrounding him.  Karl Urban did a fantastic job playing Dredd.  Casting of Olivia Thirlby & Lena Headey were excellent choices, as well as the casting of most others in the film.  I also enjoy that the movie ultimately focuses on the iconic Judge Dredd character & what he does best, JUDGE.  Dredd's helmet, uniform, & primary weapon were never left behind throughout the entire flick. The ferocity of this film, accompanied by its artistic style, also helps mold this movie into a tight, masterful production.

As the title implies I did not go into the film thinking I was going to be entertained, but I was wrong. Dredd is a brutal sci-fi action film that has a rather straight forward plot from start to finish. The ride may not be full of surprises or leave you pondering some philosophical question but is quite entertaining and time well spent. If you think the words ""bad ass"" qualify as an appropriate descriptor for a movie you would like to watch, then look no further.",1357776000,4,611,4.368421052631579
4798872,5,B005LAII7G,"Finally we have Dredd done right.

First, the feel of this film is far closer to the source material than anything seen before. It has a sort of gritty, almost ""Dirty Harry in the future"" feel that the Dredd comics did. And it does so without overt political posturing which is a relief - I watch movies to be entertained not lectured.

Second, Karl Urban nails the role perfectly. He is an amazing actor - I don't think I have ever seen him just ""mail it in"". Olivia Thirlby also does well as his rookie partner and Lena Headley gives a nice performance as MaMa - a villain worthy of the hero.

Also noteworthy is the choice of story. While it may have been partly budget motivated, having the movie basically all be in one block gave the film focus. It was really lasered in on just a few components - the conflict between Dredd and MaMa, Anderson's evaluation and the fight of the two judges to survive. This is a welcome change from a lot of films where too much is typically going on and everything gets muddled.

I do have one quibble though - the gore is overdone to me. The film did not need to be THIS bloody to get its plot across. It reminds me of the film ""Daybreakers"" (also an excellent film) where 99% of it is superb but they couldn't resist the temptation to overdo the gore. But, overall, I decided not to dock it a star over what is my own stylistic preference.",1357776000,8,1380,4.296153846153846
4798873,5,B005LAII7G,"Dredd is a futuristic SciFi action film that takes place in Mega-City One, a large metropolis with 800 million residents and 17,000 crimes reported daily. Judges keep order and work as judge, jury, and executioner. Judge Dredd is evaluating a powerful psychic and potential new Judge, Cassandra; they end up in Peach Trees, a 200-story apartment-like building, where they face off against the powerful drug lord, Ma-Ma. (the story is a bit deeper than that, but I'll keep it short.) Dredd is an action-packed, ultra-violent SciFi blast that oozes style.

Dredd's story is fairly simple, but great, nonetheless. After a routine stop, Dredd and Cassandra become trapped in the building and must fight to survive, and move up the gigantic building to stop the sinister drug lord, Ma-Ma. The film introduces a drug called ""Slow-Mo"", which makes the user perceive time at 1% of normal. This effect is used to create spectacular action sequences and stunning visuals; this effect is also used often and is never abandoned, so it never feels like a concept or test. Another plus is the variety the film has, from the ""slow-mo"" scenes to the tense showdowns, it really packs in a lot for 1hr and 30min. The film stays consistent throughout, without a dull moment; this is complimented by its ferocious pace. The film is very bloody, very gory, and very detailed, especially during the ""Slow-Mo"" scenes; this is a pure action film, without restrictions or limits, and I like that. The acting was great in this film. The music matched the atmosphere of the film. The cinematography and visuals were amazing.

Overall, Dredd is a superb SciFi action film, with nonstop-action, spectacular effects and visuals, and amazing execution; definitely entertaining, and one of the best time-killers you can watch, thanks to its short runtime and consistent pace. I highly recommend a purchase for action and SciFi fans.

This movie has taken some heat from the public, but I do not understand why. It cost $36 million to produce it with a small budget for promotion. Movies today are 50% movie and 50% promotion.

I loved the villain and it has violence and bloodshed with plenty of gore throughout. However the MEGA CITY shots could have been better to give the viewer a better idea of the scale the massive block buildings are supposed to be. The 3D was OK especially when viewing the scenes when the character is on the drug SLO-MO. The most spectacular thing about it was the sound, it was loud and in 7.1 surround. My house sounded like a war zone watching this movie. The feel of the cinematography made it seem more lifelike and grittier. Karl Urban was great in the role putting anything Stallone did to shame. Lena Heady was FANTASTIC as Ma-Ma, one of the most ruthless villains I have seen in a while.

4799063,5,B005LAII7G,"Just watched Dredd on Blu Ray in 2d, I was really disappointed I didn't see this in theaters when it was out (btw never saw ""Judge Dredd"" I refused too ha!) First off, people complain Hollywood won't make any good violent action films, well here ya go! and its original!  Yes, its similar in plot to ""The Raid: Redemption"" but that's just cause they are both trapped in a building.  My expectations were very very high for this, when I saw the original stills I thought it looked cheap and really really low budget!!!  However, to my surprise and seems like everyone else's, the movie is great!! It gets straight to the point, the plot is simple and its a great 80's action flick!!  Watching in 2D was great, but this movie makes me want to get a 3D TV!!!  I hate 3D but I can only imagine how amazing this film would look!  The slow motion is not over done! COUGH ""300"" COUGH and its not dragged out and the writers didn't go for some huge crazy plot!  Dredd and a rookie must go investigate a crime scene, and then it all goes down hill from there!!  Full of action!!!
My only gripe is the quality of the blu-ray, I was hoping for a more crystal screen, was a little grainy to me, but I get it that it was made to look dirty and I know the budget wasn't the highest, Karl Urban gained a lot of points in my book!  You never see his full face, and he pulls of a great job just with his voice!!
Its a shame! I doubt there will be a sequel, but there should be!!  This gave me the good fun shoot em up memories of other films as of late, especially Punisher: War Zone, just not as cheesy, well not at all as cheesy!  But the action is great in that as well!!!  Go buy this so they make another!!",1357689600,2,1694,4.1
4799204,4,B005LAII7G,"There are to many spots in this movie were Karl Urban (Judge Dredd)looks and acts like Sylvester Stallone.
He has the same stubble and frown on his face.

I have not see or read the comics (graphic novels) so this is going to be a comparison between the movies.

Stallones was almost comic like.
Urbans was more realistic what the comic books probably were like.

Stallones tried to wow us with the future of its movie flying cars.
Urbans was futuristic but not in a stupid way.

Stallones spent more on showing us how great the future will be.
Urbans was more of a dark future but everything was more realistic.

I would rate Stallones Judge Dredd a 1 1/2 star.
Urbans lost a star because the first time you see Dredd you would think you were watching Stallone.

I edited this review because it was pointed out I was combining two movies that Stallone did.
Guess that's what happens when you watch to many movies and Stallone does to many of the same movies.",1357689600,,959,4.451428571428571

I can't believe this movie didn't do well in the theaters but that just shows that people don't really care about the movies but the big names that are associated with them.. Don't have much to say about the 3D since I never cared for it and thought it was a gimmick which is slowly going away..

4799207,2,B005LAII7G,"What do you get if you combined the movies, Raid: Redemption, Punisher: War Zone, The Dark Knight with Raul Julia from, Street Fighter, you get, DREDD!?!

Okay, so I've never read the Dredd comics (2000AD) but I have seen lots of the artwork from said comics and know that Dredd is suppose to be a big, brutish, lug of a guy, encased in a suit that he barely fits into (one of the things they got right with Stallone in the original version) but what we get in this incarnation is Karl Urban (of Xena, Doom, Pathfinder) who, although a pretty fit guy, looks like a sickly person wearing an outfit that was meant to be worn by a guy twice his size (thus the Raul Julia refference, as he WAS sick when he was making the movie, Street Fighter, and he looked it, with his overtly large costume threatening to consume him at every turn) not to mention the ill fitting of his iconic helmet and the fact that unlike Peter Weller in Robocop, his mouth and chin just don't stand out as good from under the helmet, making him look too small for the thing (once again, Stallone looked pretty good in the helmet).

As for the story, if you've seen, Raid: Redemption, or the last half of, The Punisher: War Zone, then you've basically seen this film; good guys go into a large story, tenement building to get to the bad guy(s) at the top, and have to fight their way through throngs of heavily armed henchmen sent by said bad guy(s) to kill them, and all manner of kayos ensues (heck, the baddies from both War Zone and Dredd have bad facial scars that help to define who they are and why they're doing some of the bad stuff that they're doing).

As for the, Dark Knight reference, it's in regards to the fact that the futuristic cities in both, look more like the downtown of most major metropolitan city, just with a few taller CGI created buildings seen in the distance (another thing the Stallone movie got right, as the comics show Mega City 1, as this multi-teared, Vegas like basterdization, with massive buildings, atop massive buildings, atop massive buildings all decked out in glass, neon and grime).

Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad movie per say, it's just that it's not the definitive Judge Dredd movie that the critics were touting it as being, feeling more like a very small scale indie film that was given a bigger budget after the fact, meaning that the script is pretty basic, the effects are added in, after the fact embellishments (that look cool for the most part, but aren't necessary to the story, what little story we get).

Karl Urban is a good actor, but was (in my opinion) miscast in this role (Jason Statham might have been a better choice or even, The Rock could have given the character the iconic profile that is Dredd) and the film plays more like you're watching a HD video game with a basic story plot to move along the action and carnage, but little in the way of character depth or real character development to be found.",1357689600,4,2949,4.44362292051756
4799208,5,B005LAII7G,"When I watched Dredd 3D in theaters when it was released I wasn't quite sure what to expect - I hadn't seen a single trailer, heard nothing about movie or it's director or stars other than quite a few positive reviews from RottenTomatoes. The movie blew me away in it's sheer greatness: the hard industrial soundtrack, the gritty realistic violence, the cinematography, and the 3D visuals are truly awesome especially during the ""slo-mo"" shootouts.

Whereas The Dark Knight Rises, Amazing Spider-Man and The Avengers were big budget crowd pleasers (and there's nothing wrong with that as they are quality films) I found that Dredd holds nothing back and is easily my favorite comic book film adaptation of 2012. I picked up the 3D Blu-Ray yesterday and it's just as fantastic of an experience at home as it was on the big screen. Don't hesitate, buy this film - you won't be disappointed.",1357689600,2,888,4.842105263157895
4799209,4,B005LAII7G,"My review score is based on the set and what you get, not the movie itself. There are other rating places more fitting for that like IMDB though i will say how i feel about the movie later.

Of the features, the disk only lists it as 3d. The disk has both the 3d and the 2d versions which is nice. I love to get 3d but hate to watch it with the glasses on every time i want to see it. I was hesitant on buying this but there is a 2d version so have no fear.

The 3d in the movie itself wasn't the greatest. My son wasn't sure if it was even 3d at first, though it was. There were no big points where anything jumped out at you. It seemed just to be a 'basic' 3d i guess i would call it. I have seen others use a scale, which measures how far things seem to leap out of the screen. This had depth, not nothing that wowed me. Still it was nice to have some dimension to what we saw and i liked it more than a 2d version.

The movie comes with Ultra-Violet which tends to get a bad rap. I have the Flixster app on my ipad so i can stream the movie from anywhere and not use up space which i love. It goes without saying you can stream it from any other internet device like a pc. I personally like it because you can't lose the copy and it's always available. You can even download the movie straight from Flixster onto your device, just like an iTunes copy. The quality of the movie streamed is great and appears to be HD, not SD.

It also comes with an iTunes copy is HD also. I bought Avengers and iTunes gave me the SD definition which i wasn't too happy with. This copy looks great, though i will probably never use it as it takes up a lot of space. Its still nice to have. I have to note that the iTunes version also has the special features included in the download.

The bonus features are sorely lacking. There are only five features, and each only run for about two minutes. They don't get into much of anything. Because there was so little, i was disappointed, though i usually don't watch special features.

A DVD copy would have been nice, but wasn't given. I probably wouldn't use it but maybe lend it out. I think this is why they didn't offer it. It's not a deal breaker.

The insert in it is just a leaflet with the code for the digital copy and a cover for the movie. There's no pamphlets or any extras. There is a case cover that's nice.

Personally i liked the movie, but not as much as the 90's carnation and i didn't like the color scheme on this one so much. Overall it was a good flick though. Urban did a good job, but was too robotic in his movements, like Robocop. He was trying too hard to be tough, unlike Stallone who was full of energy. It had lots of action and was fairly engrossing throughout. The story was good, and any fan of the old movie or the comics will most likely like it.

For the price, its a good set.",1357689600,,2845,4.021238938053098
4799210,4,B005LAII7G,"Let's get one thing out of the way up front. The only thing 2012's ""Dredd"" and 1995's ""Judge Dredd"" have in common is a name. For those who have somehow escaped seeing a trailer for the new take on the futuristic lawman, let me just say there's no comparison between the two. Sylvester Stallone's adaptation of the character boasted stylish clothing, props, and special effects. Karl Urban's has style, but it's in the form of an interesting combination of artsy cinematography and violent grit.

The America of the future has been reduced to a desolate wasteland known as the Cursed Earth. The only civilizations left are overcrowded metropolitan areas called Mega Cities. Inside each of their walls, hundreds of thousands of citizens fight for some semblance of a life amongst the decay and crime.

The only thing standing in the way of the gangs and other lawbreakers taking over the cities are the Judges. They act as judge, jury, and executioner when they encounter ""Perps."" Joseph Dredd is the most notorious Judge in Mega City One. His skills are put to the ultimate test as he and his new partner, a psychic named Anderson, are commissioned to take down a drug kingpin housed atop a sealed-up tenement where everyone is on the hunt for them.

Screenwriter Alex Garland and director Pete Travis did a bang-up (literally) job of delivering a satisfying vision of 2000AD's legendary comic book character. I don't think Dredd fans could have asked for more. All the graphic violence and cynicism readers came to enjoy on the printed page is brought to vivid life with plenty of splashes of bright red to quench the bloodthirsty hordes.

I'm extremely impressed with director of photography Anthony Dodd Mantle's work. He creates a beautiful balance between gut-level grime, realism, and a hyper-colored drug-induced world of art house / indie film glitz. It's a unique mash-up that works effectively within the confines of ""Dredd.""

Alex Garland's screenplay is simple and to the point while staying engrossing. Everything moves along quite well until the last ten or fifteen minutes. Unfortunately, we run into some action / cop movie clich&eacute;s which don't completely ruin the experience but come dangerously close to tainting it. A simpler ending might have brought the film to a close quicker, but would have served it better in the long run.

The high-definition video and audio quality is superb for ""Dredd."" The elegance of the cinematography for the film comes across strong on Blu-ray. The colors are vibrant and the picture is as clean as it should be without losing its personality. The 7.1 surround sound mix brings to life all the explosions, gunshots, and roaring motorcycles one would expect in a big-budget action film. They'll definitely keep an audience awake in a home entertainment setting.

An adequate amount of special features are included in the Blu-ray edition of the movie. There are six different featurettes entitled ""Mega-City Masters,"" ""Day of Chaos: The Visual Effects of 'Dredd,'"" ""'Dredd,'"" ""Dredd's Gear,"" ""The 3rd Dimension,"" and ""Welcome to Peachtrees."" All of them are under 16 minutes and feature the cast and crew talking about different aspects of the production and the world of ""Dredd."" A ""Dredd"" motion comic prequel gives more information on drug kingpin Madeline and the slo-mo drug.

Longtime enthusiasts and action movie fans will delight in the gory ultra-violence of ""Dredd."" It delivers on every level and only meanders into overly familiar territory momentarily. Great cinematography and a simple-yet-satisfying story make this recommended viewing.",1357689600,,3608,5.145051194539249

4799304,4,B005LAII7G,"As a life long Sylvester Stallone fan, I'll always enjoy the 90's version. That beind said, ""Judge Dredd"" is also very typical from a Stallone action flick of the 80's-90's: from the highly entertaining ""Cobra"" and ""Demolition Man"" to the god-awful ""Over the Top,"" the bulk of Stallone's movies from the 80's-90's are relatively predictable, campy and by the numbers. That's the charm of a Stallone vehicle. I assumed the remake would also be predictable, campy and by the numbers, minus the likeable superstar. Thus, I really had no desire to see it in the theater.  After renting it on Amazon Instant Video, however,  I can safely say I was wrong. ""Dredd"" is one of the best action movies I've seen in a long time.

I have a hard time calling ""Dredd"" a ""remake,"" as the storylines are completely different from one another. While it is certainly leaner, meaner, grittier and nastier than the Stallone version, you could easily watch them back to back as two separate adventures of Judge Dredd. The Stallone version, with a bigger budget and larger scale, is much lighter and cheesier; this version is much darker and more serious. In fact, this version can be nightmare inducing and off-putting to softer stomachs with its hardcore violence.

Plot in a nutshell: Judge Dredd takes a rookie Judge out into the field for an overall assessment. The two answer a call to investigate a triple homicide in the Peach Tree district (a rough area populated with gangs and killers). The two judges cross paths with a self made drug lord, the ruthless ""Ma-Ma"" (wonderfully played by Lena Headley, who is one nasty, scary bitch of a villian), who has the entire complex shut down. Trapped inside with no way of escape, the two Judges must fight for their lives as ""Ma-Ma"" orders their immediate demise. If you are familiar with the movie ""Raid: The Redemption"" you will notice both storylines are very similar. ""The Raid"" is another fantasticly hard core action flick that was released in 2012, where cops are trapped in a building full of killers and crazies attempting to fulfill the bloody demands of a drug kingpin. However, ""The Raid"" is much more of a martial arts extravaganza where Dredd concentrates more on violent gun play and amazing visuals that are truly stunning to watch.

Speaking of amazing visuals: The visual style of ""Dredd"" is wonderful- especially the use of slow motion throughout the film. In fact, the use of slow motion is probably the best I've seen in ANY movie, surpassing even the Matrix or any other film that has taken slow motion to new heights. ""Slo-Mo"" also happens to be the name of the drug that Ma-Ma pushes, and the scenes where people are high on ""Slo-Mo"" are among the most amazing in the film. From an early scene where Ma-Ma is high while taking a bath to a gun fight between Dredd and a roomful of junkies who are smoking ""Slo-Mo"" -- the use of slow motion is absolutely breathtaking to behold.

Add an intense industrial / electronic soundtrack, plenty of gore, terrific pace and solid acting from all the major players, ""Dredd"" is easily the most overlooked, under-rated action movie of 2012. While the movie flopped at the box office, most critics loved it (currently 77% on Rottentomatoes), as did general audiences (see IMDB.com and all the 4 & 5 star reviews from Amazon).

Yes, the plot is simple and the characters aren't deeply developed- This isn't that kind of movie. In fact, the movie is all the better for it. I've never read the comics, so I have no idea how mysterious or developed the character of Dredd is. But for the film's sake, I think the less that is known about him the better. Urban's performance is well done- his Dredd is simultaneously righteous and sociopathic. He constantly seeths with an inner hatred, but at what is never explained: is it the constant ugliness of street violence he's surrounded by? Did something horrible happen in his past? Is he simply a sociopath himself, a killer with a questionable conscience? All of the above? Again, I liked that his character is open to interpretation (if you're nerdy enough like I am to search for deeper meaning in a high energy action film like this- I personally think there's a lot of depth to this movie, which is one reason why it is a critically acclaimed film).

If you are looking for highly entertaining hardcore adult action that moves quickly, pulls no punches and takes no prisoners, ""Dredd"" delivers in spades.  Hopefully this movie finds new life on video that it did not at the box office, thus warranting future installments in the ""Dredd"" franchise (so long as the same makers are involved).",1357689600,6,4624,4.7556109725685785

This movie is what it is, and it knows it -- pure action. Don't expect a hidden subplot, surprise characters or twists. Dredd and his rookie, Anderson, are trapped in a giant mega project called Peach Trees. Upon being trapped, an hour of badassery follows; gun fights, gore and a soundtrack to match.

Big TV, 3D Glasses, and 5.1 surround cranked up are highly recommended.",1357603200,2,692,4.440944881889764
4799310,4,B005LAII7G,"I won't recount the plot of Dredd, there is plenty of that in the product details. I will briefly say that this is a solid action film that I wish had done better at the Box Office (and I find myself partly to blame for this)

Karl Urban is great as Dredd, delivering a gruff hardass anonymity to the role. Olivia Thirlby is pretty good too, mixing a vulnerability with a hard edged confidence as well. She plays a psychic with a magical realism that you don't often see in these characters and has a great psychic standoff with a criminal. Lena Headey could have been given more to do.

But let's be real, it's not meant to be a thoughtful and intriguing rumination on government and police (although there is a lot of potential for that) It's an action film. It's a low budget high violence B movie action flick. Fans of anything done by actors who could appear in the Expendables should enjoy this.

I'm not saying it's brainless, and I'm not saying it's dumb. But it is simple and straightforward and I say that in a good way. A very enjoyable action film with a killer soundtrack.

Enjoy the Judgement.",1357603200,2,1107,4.438423645320197

After the horror of the Stallone version (despite a few high points), I had little hopes for this new release.

This is one of those times that I am thrilled to be wrong...

The movie was much more faithful to the character of Judge Dredd, even if it was a slightly different take on the world of Dredd itself.  It didn't have quite the comicy feel of Megacity (something that the Stallone movie did actually do pretty well), but it did feel like a more realistic version of the Dredd universe.  I was also amazed at how gritty it was... you thought the new Batman took a darker/grittier approach?  Nothing compared to Dredd.

It is not one of the major story arcs (at least not one I read in the progs/comics), but more of a day in the life of Dredd.  Just a simple day of testing out a rookie, and seeing if she has what it takes to really be a Judge.  Of course, things rapidly spiral and escalate out of control, and then Dredd does what Dredd does best - he plows through every obstacle with a single minded determination to reach his goal.

The cinematography was superb, some really beautiful effect - especially the scenes when perps are using the slo-mo drug.  The sound really immersed you in the film - to the point that I quite literally jumped when I heard one of the gunshots from a rear speaker.

All of the actors do a fantastic job in their roles, with Urban, Headey and Thirlby being the stand outs (as they should be).

The special features on the Blu-ray are nothing spectacular.  There is a pretty good '35 years of Dredd' clip that is well worth the price of admission.  The video prequel comic is ok, but too short.  There are several other short featurettes that are worth watching, but nothing stand out.

Really wish there were some deleted scenes, or a commentary, or maybe a few progs digitized for my wide screen nostalgic reading pleasure.  Maybe we'll see that in a special collectors edition that comes with a prop lawgiver.....

It is sad that the marketing campaign for this movie wasn't better here in the states - or that the word was so slow in getting it.  It seemed to be out of theaters even before most people heard it was released.

With any luck, the Bluray/DVD sales will be enough to generate interest in a sequel... Dark Judges?  Judge Cal?  Who knows.  One thing I do know, is if they stick with the creative team on this film, and Urban/Thirlby, it will be fantastic!",1357603200,4,2910,5.264642082429501
4799312,5,B005LAII7G,"A solid action film, vastly superior to the original and very deserving of a sequel. However I must say that the central premise of being trapped in a tenement block with the inhabitants unleashed on the heroes is a total rip-off of The Raid: Redemption; which if you are a fan of action films is a must see as it is one of the best martial arts/action films ever. This being said the reincarnation of Judge Dredd is definitely worth watching, you will not regret it.",1357603200,,467,4.441860465116279

4799393,3,B005LAII7G,"This movie is reminiscent of that movie The Raid Redemption, though without the kung-fu.  It's got some ups and downs to it.  The first movie (Judge Dredd) had much better Sci-Fi pushed into the post apocalyptic world. This movie has no flying cars, no food robots, no cyborgs, and no clones or abusive computer AI's to manipulate.  Instead, it's almost like what Detroit would be like in 20 years...ha!  Still, for an action flick, it's not bad.  At least in this one the side-kick female role was played out much better with her killing people and passing judgement.  The first movie it was more ""look at me, I have boobs."" and that's all she was good for.",1357603200,2,658,4.581196581196581
4799394,5,B005LAII7G,"It's kind of sad to realize that this may be the only Dredd movie we will see in a while. I loved this movie. It was probably one of my favorite movies of 2012. Everything about it was great. The actors, the story, the music, the set design, etc. I really hoped that this movie would make enough to warrant a sequel, but it's probably not going to happen. Karl Urban throws it out of the park with his performance. This is quite literally the best performance I've seen from half a face in my entire life. Olivia Thrilby as Judge Anderson is a great counterpart to the grim and morose Judge Dredd. Lena Headey is brutal as Ma-Ma. What made this movie great, ultimately ended up hurting it. The dark, gritty, story line with scenes of some pretty explicit violence is what made this movie stand out. But, it also deterred movie goers from watching it. Not to mention, many people still have a bad taste in their mouth in regards to Dredd because of the previous adaptation with Sylvester Stallone. That movie was embarrassing and campy. This movie was anything but.

One could also make the argument that movie goers are expecting a certain type of movie when it's based on a comic book. I personally also loved The Avengers, but I recognize that that movie is pretty much a fluffy joyride when compared to Dredd. Dredd is a proper action movie, with action scenes that have tangible consequences. People die, sometime in gruesome ways. In The Avengers, we see only one character explicitly die with blood, and even then it's a little dribble. Dredd is the anti-comic book movie. And I really appreciated that.

I hope that this movie makes enough money in home video sales to justify a sequel, because that would be great.",1357603200,6,1722,4.587662337662338
4799395,5,B005LAII7G,"This may be my first and only review, but this movie was completely entertaining.  If you are a fan of comic book movies but want to watch something closer to the original comic watch this film.",1357603200,,194,4.388888888888889
4799396,4,B005LAII7G,"To say that DREDD is an improvement on the Stallone interpretation is missing the point.  JUDGE DREDD is one of those films that's just so awful, you can't help but watch it.  DREDD is not that kind of film.  Not to say it's a great piece of cinema; it isn't, far from it.  But as an action film that doesn't take itself too seriously, it's definitely a welcome adaptation.

The plot is simple: the titular judge of few words and a psychic rookie along for the ride check out a triple homicide in a 200-story skyscraper kingdom ruled with an iron fist by drug lord Ma-Ma.  When the judges take one of Ma-Ma's men prisoner, she overreacts and shuts the building down.  The judges now have to shoot their way out.  You know what happens next.

Karl Urban brings some excellent screen presence to the role of Dredd; his face mostly covered (yes, comic fans, the entire movie!), he speaks in a harsh drawl that conveys an excellent mix of menace and humor.  Olivia Thirlby, as the rookie Anderson, is a welcome surprise, especially when her character is given permission to get down and dirty and kick some bad guy butt.  As Ma-Ma, Lena Headey is a menacing delight; it's a shame that her character isn't given more to do, and that the ultimate showdown is so sudden and disappointing.  If anything, that is perhaps DREDD's biggest weakness: with such a small premiss (characters stuck inside a skyscraper, no way to go but up and out), the film needs to drown in tension.  It doesn't.  There are no real stakes; we know Dredd will get out alive, and we know the bad guy (or girl) will be punished.  DREDD offers some good imagery, some great action sequences, and a nice lead turn from Urban; but it lacks anything surprising or original.  Still, for someone wanting a more faithful adaptation, something darker and more action-driven, then this is a good enough film.  Far from anything great, but it's definitely an enjoyable 90-odd minutes, and you can do far worse out there.",1357603200,,1976,4.6
4799397,5,B005LAII7G,"Like some other reviewers, I am biased regarding this film.  I love the Dredd comic and I've been reading it since I was a kid.  Although this movie does not exactly match the Bolland/Ezquerra aesthetic, I think it does an excellent job of bringing the world and characters to life.  This movie suffered from a lackluster advertising campaign and sadly performed poorly at the box office.  However, do not be deterred!  This is the best comic book translation you will ever see!  This was the hidden gem of 2012 and blows Whedon's cheese-ball Avengers movies out of the water.

This movie is bleak and violent, just as I always imagined the world of Dredd.  However, it is delivered in a cinematographic style that is beautiful.  From the first moments of aerial shots of Mega-City 1 to the cramped interior of squalid apartments, I was struck by the richness of every scene.  I will agree with some critics that the slo-mo scenes can be a little drawn out, but I'm willing to give the director a pass on that one.  Throughout the movie, the action is fast paced, but doesn't seem rushed; I never felt like it was dragging, or that action was being thrown on the screen for its own sake.  Each scene makes internal sense and moves the plot along fluidly.  Plot-wise, this movie is simplistic, but that is part of its appeal.  In the comic, Dredd views his world in black-and-white terms, there is no room for moral ambiguity, and I believe the plot of the movie showcases this aspect of the comic superbly.

The actors in this movie all gave outstanding performances.  Urban in particular nailed his role as the titular character.  The supporting cast were all emotionally convincing and intriguing, but without ever outshining Urban as Dredd.

Lastly, this movie has an amazing soundtrack.  I enjoyed listening to the original scores (and rare outside songs) during this movie as much as I enjoyed Zimmer's work in Inception.  Music is very much subject to personal taste, but I feel that the scores in this movie wonderfully match the look and feel of the visuals.

If you're a fan of the comic, there are numerous easter eggs to pick up, i.e. buildings named after significant figures in the life of the comic, and a movie poster advertising Krysler's Mark.",1357603200,6,2260,4.728900255754476

If you enjoyed the certain darkness and realism Christopher Nolan created with his versions of Batman, you will love this. The mid 90's Batman and Dredd movies were a little fantasized and unreal. Like the newer batman movies, Dredd brings a certain darkness and realistic feel to the environment you're submerged into.

4799497,5,B005LAII7G,"You're being hunted, outnumbered, you're unable to escape. To make matters worse, your only ally is inexperienced and you have a prisoner whose safety is your responsibility. What do you do?

  The majority of the United States is now uninhabitable, thanks to radiation. Those areas are referred to as The Cursed Earth. Mega-City One, one of the habitable areas, is a large violent metropolis containing close to one billion people and suffering 17,000 violent crimes a day. The only bulwark maintaining some semblance of order is the greatly outnumbered Judges. Despite their name, they perform the same tasks as police officers in addition to carrying out the duties of determining guilt and imposing sentence. One such man is Judge Dredd (played by Karl Urban). Dredd (Urban) is well-known among his fellow Judges for his uncompromising nature and stiff sentences. Against his will, Dredd is ordered by his superior to evaluate a young officer who failed her exams but was offered the chance to be a Judge because of her psychic abilities, caused by the radiation and making her part of a societal caste referred to as ""mutants"". The young rookie (played by Olivia Thirlby) is named Cassandra Anderson and, while Dredd wears a helmet throughout the entire film, she elects not to for fear that it will inhibit her psychic abilities. Simultaneously, in a 200-story slum referred to as The Peach Trees, a crime boss named Madeline Madrigal, also known as Ma-Ma, (played by Lena Headey) has three men drugged, skinned, and dropped from a high floor in The Peach Trees. Dredd and Anderson are informed via radio and arrive at the scene to investigate. Anderson's psychic abilities allow her to identify one of the perpetrators almost immediately, causing Dredd to take the man into custody so he can be interrogated back at the Judges' headquarters. Something Ma-Ma cannot allow. And the hunt begins.

  Now, I have seen the 1995 Sylvester Stallone movie which was inspired by the same source material. In fact, I've seen it many times. I'm not proud of it, but it's true. While this film doesn't explore Dredd's origins or allow the same ""growth"", I'd say Dredd succeeded where its predecessor failed. No, it doesn't have Rob Schneider to offer comic relief or Diane Lane and Joan Chen as strong and attractive female characters, but the cat-and-mouse game Headey's character and the illustration of the drug referred to as Slo-Mo more than compensate. It doesn't break new ground or challenge the actors, save for Headey who is forced to appear unattractive onscreen for the first time in her career, but it is highly entertaining and I enjoyed it a great deal.",1357516800,4,2662,4.9707865168539325

4799499,5,B005LAII7G,"Hollywood sci-fi action movies these days tend to have too many subplots, characters who act out of character, nonsensical character motivations, and swooshing CGI cartoonish action scenes. ""Dredd"", on the other hand, is a lean, mean, well-paced, well-acted, well-thought out, darkly funny non-stop escalation of movie violence. I've seen this movie multiple times and it keeps getting better. What really makes this movie is the acting and the way the characters are written. Judge Dredd is a no nonsense fascist lawman who out-fights and out-thinks his opponents at every turn and Urban plays him to perfection with his Dirty Harry-esque line deliveries, hard-ass attitude, and best of all, his permanent Dredd scowl. AND he does all this while keeping the helmet ON. His relationship with the rookie cop would have been a cliche and an annoyance in another movie but here the interaction is well-written and believable. Even during a firefight he's still putting the rookie through the paces. I love how Dredd summed up the events in this movie to his boss in two words, ""Drug bust."" This one-liner is neither a pun nor a smart-ass remark but it tells you all you need to know about Dredd and manages to crack me up every time. Man of few words indeed.

Come to think of it, it's sad that it's exceedingly rare nowadays to find an action movie or any movie with smartly written characters, motivation and pacing. It's easier to suspend your disbelief when the characters are believable and would act and think according to their personality instead just doing random things to lead to the next set piece. Now, ""Dredd"" is not ""The Godfather"" or ""Citizen Kane"" but its simple plot lends to it becoming about the journey and not the destination. It's like this breakfast sandwich I'm about to consume. Ham, egg and cheese on toasted English muffin. Simple but, in the right hands, a delicious journey.

After reading some reviews it's annoying to see some people complaining that this movie was similar to or ripping off ""The Raid"". Let me tell ya. ""Dredd"" was written and went into production a year or two before ""The Raid"" was a twinkle in its director's eye. ""Raid"" is littered with terrible acting and after 30 minutes it became really tedious to watch men fighting each other to the death over and over and over and over and over and over again. If Dredd is like anything it's like having Dirty Harry in ""DIE HARD"". Now THAT sounds like a good movie.

The only complaint I have about this movie is that the design of the sets and Mega-City One along with the bad guys could be a little more ""futuristic"". I know it's due to the low budget and that the filmmakers wanted a real-world feel but it would look and feel more like we're watching some future post-apocalyptic society where crime and violence is the norm and a fascistic judicial system is needed to combat that instead of a fascist cop in hazy South Africa shooting and killing poor people (even if they are criminals) with no mercy. I also miss some of that strange and quirky tone that Mega-City One has in the comics. But that's nitpicking. It's a great movie so please, people, BUY this movie so we can get a proper sequel.

One last thing, my wife LOVED this movie. She's not a fan of action movies or Judge Dredd and I basically had to force her to go watch this in the theater. Half way through the movie I looked over expecting her to be bored out of her mind or asleep but her eyes were riveted to the screen and she was pumped to see Dredd and Anderson kick more ass. In fact, I now have to wear a Judge Dredd helmet when we make sexy time.

Mega-City Masters: 35 Years of Judge Dredd (HD; 14:27) is a really good (if kind of brief) retrospective of the franchise, including interviews with co-creators John Wagner and Carlos Ezsquerra, artist Brian Bolland, 2000AD's Matt Smith, among others. In the ""if you can't say anything nice, don't say anything at all"" category, this focuses solely on the comic and steers clear of the Stallone vehicle.

Day of Chaos: The Visual Effects of Dredd (HD; 15:21) is a nice look at the cool VFX featured in the film and includes interviews with Neil Miller, Visual Effects Art Director and Jon Thum, Visual Effects Supervisor. There's some interesting information on a new handheld 3D camera that was utilized for the film's extreme close-ups, as well as the highspeed (over 3000fps!) that did the ""slo-mo"" SFX.

Dredd Featurette (HD; 1:53) is really little more than a gussied up trailer.

Dredd's Gear (HD; 2:31) takes a look at things like costumes and props.

The 3rd Dimension (HD; 2:00) features interviews with Producer Andrew MacDonald, Cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle and Lead Stereographer Vincent E. Toto.

Welcome to Peachtrees (HD; 2:33) focuses on the ""megablock"" where the bulk of the film takes place.

The action is good and the story is actually not that bad but for me it just couldn't hold my attention. Im sure many people will love this movie and will watch it regardless of what I say but for me there are many other sci-fi action movies out there there are much better, the new ""Total Recall"" being one of them. Overall, not bad but hard for me to stay focused on. I give it a B-.",1357171200,2,1052,4.086956521739131
4799655,4,B005LAII7G,"I hadn't even heard of Dredd before its release date, but the sheer volume of positive critical reviews convinced me to turn over my silver at the local cineplex.  With first run tickets costing $12, I'm less inclined to take a leap of faith these days, but in the case of Dredd, I'm glad I did.  If I had waited to talk with someone who had seen the flick, I would have been out of luck, as it seems only a couple dozen other US movie goers caught this dazzling left field ball before it faded at the box office.  I agree with other reviewers who feel it's a shame and a mystery this film failed to attract an audience.

I won't summarize the plot - others have already done so aptly and with more details than I can recall from one viewing.  Suffice it to say Karl Urban is the re-personification of the Man with No Bane + Dirty Harry, transported to another dystopian future with just enough cinematic novelty to push Dredd past the now all-too-common usual post-apocalyptic suspects.  Urban seems to have won over the Dredd diehards who were still smarting over Stallone's jokey star turn from 1995.  I can't comment, as I am unfamiliar with the source material, however, Urban perfectly channels Eastwood, circa 1966/71, with his laconic, ironic performance.

One of the pleasures of watching this admittedly hyper-violent action flick, is the growing realization that Urban's Dredd is so bad ass, no matter what the increasingly impossible odds, nothing is going to stop him from attaining the ridiculous ante he ups, even when it seems he has no choice but toto fold.  Like the Eastwood personas, you root as much for the IDEA of a super-heroic unstoppable force plowing through a familiar landscape of evil-doers - baddies who might otherwise singe the feet of John McClane or even Schwarzenegger on a good day.  The fun comes from watching the bad guys (gal) coming to grips with the fact they are simply not facing an ordinary mortal, although Dredd isn't Superman taking down a bicycle thief; he's flesh and bloody-well bleeds.  His super power lies in the fact he's just more cold than the villains.

It's the almost Tarantino/Sam Jackson attitude that Urban evokes - you don't question how, you just laugh and root him on.  The fact that Urban plays it totally straight, yet not RoboCop-ish, is key.  Granted, obscuring his face with a helmet for the entire movie helps to discourage any sly eye-brow arching and the script doesn't give Dredd much wiggle room in the character development department.  Though Eastwood never wore a mask, the comparison is still compatible - no offense Clint, but who needed, who WANTED expressive range when Harry Callahan was doggedly pursuing Scorpio through a hail of gunfire in that rock quarry?  A man's got to know his limitations indeed!

The rest of the Dredd cast does a serviceable job and the effects, as noted, are on the Spartan side, however the filmmakers make up for a lack of budget, similar to Looper, with enough imagination to keep the largely CGI-scenery fresh.  I'm looking forward to buying Dredd on Blu-ray and recommend it to anyone who enjoys loud, smart, escapist fun.",1357084800,4,3141,4.763837638376383

4799659,4,B005LAII7G,"Dredd takes place in a post-apocalypse world. The planet has been destroyed by nuclear war and people live in massive cities called blocks. Dredd (Kark Urban) is a judge who serves as every branch of the criminal justice system all rolled into one. Judges patrol the urban landscape on super-fast motorcycles, dispensing swift justice. They are empowered to arrest, convict, sentence, and execute criminals.

Dredd is assigned a rookie partner, Anderson (Olivia Thereby), who failed the judge training system, but a nuclear mutation has given her the ability to read minds, a helpful tool in policing and seeing through bad guys lies and deceptions.

Dispatched by the central authority, the Judges target is Ma-Ma (Lena Headey), a ruthless boss bent on expanding her criminal empire through sales of Slo-Mo, a dangerous reality-altering drug. Set over the course of a single day, the film follows Dredd and his psychic rookie partner as they investigate a triple homicide in a skyscraper slum run by sadistic Ma-Ma.

Dredd revels in choreographed action sequences and killings meted out in assorted, bloody ways. The film never really ponders the morality of instant justice, and there are some lapses in logic in the screenplay. Whatever its shortcomings, Dredd is far superior to the awful Sylvester Stallone Judge Dredd of 1995. This one is played straight.

The character of Judge Dredd was created by writer John Wagner and artist Carlos Ezquerra, and first appeared in 2000 AD (1977), a weekly science-fiction anthology comic.

Though Dredd was originally released in 3D, the 4K Ultra HD version is in standard 2D, though visually impressive. The picture is sharp, with vibrant color as well as deep blacks, providing a rich, inky look. Details are amazing. You can see clearly individual shards of shattered glass, detailed features of buildings, gruesome make-up enhancements, dirt, dust and scratches on helmets, and some cool specifics in debris flying around in action sequences. The CGI still looks good, but not as believable as in the theatrical version. In this case, the enhanced 4K detail shows off the computer work a little too much.

Bonus extras on the 2-disc 4K Ultra HD/Blu-ray Combo Pack include 7 behind-the-scenes featurettes and the theatrical trailer. A digital HD copy is enclosed.",1356912000,,2311,5.198924731182796

This is ""entertainment"" in the sickest sense, a long drudgery of bodies being shot, stabbed, shredded, gored, and yes, even skinned alive. Oh, and don't forget the scene graphically depicting oral sex that goes disgustingly violent. Can't have a movie without that, right?

So I was excited to go see this second attempt at bringing him to the big screen and was highly disappointed.  Dredd for me has always worked because he parodies action heroes even while being one.  He's the sort of 'hero' who'll save a mugging victim, brutally beat (or kill) the perpetrators, then haul in the terrified victim for incitement (you should have known better than to wear jeweled kneepads in this neighborhood).  He's the ultimate fascist hero and in the right hands he makes us cheer for him, and then makes us uncomfortable for doing it.

This movie missed that point.

You can see them missing the point right there on the cover.  In the comics Dredd's uniform is outrageously over the top with a massive eagle shoulder pad and a badge the size of a dinner plate.  The attempt to make it look more realistic shows the film makers wanted a generic action hero, not a clever parody.

So we got a film about a supercop shooting his way through an apartment building and beating the bad guy all in glorious 3D.  There was no sense of self-awareness or satire or even humor in the film.  Everything is just ugly and dirty and unpleasant.  I neither laughed nor cheered.

I know I'll be in the minority here but just as the Stallone version went too far into parody this one went too far into the grim.  Maybe in 15 years or so we'll get a movie that strikes the right balance.",1356480000,9,1469,4.412639405204461

The Stallone version, cheeseball as it was, carried a lot of weight and honestly I didn't see where there was room for any sort of improvement given the source material.  I'm not knocking the Dredd comics, I just did't expect anyone to have the will to translate them in any way faithfully to the big screen.  Man, was I wrong. This film is dark, violent, gory, and unrelenting. It has not real morally redeeming moments. It is... almost perfect. Dredd, this Dredd, is a bad ass for the ages. Kudos to Alex Garland for a solid script.  And kudos to Karl Urban for throwing himself into a role that no one is every going to recognize him for (literally, he's a frown with a helmet for the entire movie).

The other surprise for me was the cinematography. This movie is visually stunning in a way you just don't expect from a action movie like this.  The visuals are balanced with a terrific sound track as well. The movie really draws you into the world the filmmakers were trying to create.

I don't know, maybe my initial doubts going in are clouding my judgement, but this was a stand out movie for me for 2012 and I can't wait to see it again on blu-ray.",1356393600,18,1238,4.360869565217391

Instead of cheesy one-liners, Dredd delivers a face full of bullets, but when it comes time to dish out the dialogue, Karl Urban does a great job with the his gravelly voice to create a larger than life walking death machine. You literally never see his face the entire film, and yet he is oozing with character. They give you little tastes of the possibility of a sequel but when I saw this in the theater, there was about 5 other people besides my friends. This is what a modern action flick should look like, I just hope they can find a way to make another one.

The Movie has had a great response from both critics and Cinema-goers alike, and I believe that if a sequel was to be made, then it would do extremely well at the Box-Office next time around. Alright, Dredd didn't do too well takings wise, but that was not due to it being a bad Movie. But morons online stating that Dredd is a ""remake"" of the poor 1995 Stallone Film before it's release, probably didn't help matters much. Along with the fact that the new film probably wasn't marketed hard enough in time for it's release either. (Even though the films two main stars did do a lot of interviews for Dredd) Many people didn't even know a new Dredd film was even on the way at all. And by the way, Dredd is not a remake of the Stallone film, it's a completely new, fresh start for the character. It's a re-boot rather than a remake. A brand new story, a brand new Mega City One, and a brand new Judge Dredd. I have a strong feeling that ""word of mouth"" will play a big part in whether or not there will be a Dredd 2, plus it's probably all down to how the film sells on Blu-Ray and DVD across the coming year also. I'm positive that the possibility of a Dredd 2 in the next two or three years will not be overlooked by all the parties concerned, providing Dredd does indeed do well on the home market.

And what an exhilarating and exciting movie Dredd turned out to be-more than living up to its classic comic book source material, no mean feat in itself.
Dredd (2012) gets everything right that the 1995 movie iteration of the character got so spectacularly wrong.
Dredd is a refreshingly adult piece of filmmaking-brutal, dark and with a razor sharp vein of black humour running through it and is pretty much the opposite of what Hollywood churns out today.
Dredd is old school filmmaking at its best and reminiscent of many of the classic 80's dystopian sci-fi movies of the past, such as Mad Max II and Escape From New York, and is really not to be missed by fans of such films.
The performances are uniformly excellent. Karl Urban perfectly embodies the cold, almost machine like character of Judge Dredd and Urban is matched by his co-star, Olivia Thirlby, who gives a remarkably committed performance, as rookie Judge Anderson.
Your protagonists are only as good as your antagonist. And luckily with Lena Headey, playing Ma-Ma, they have their equal as she depicts a brutally ruthless individual, that is also a strangely sympathetic one. Not an easy juggling act to pull off.
The film is visually striking with an effective (read subtle) use of 3D that never overshadows what is effectively a high octane and sharply written character study from director Peter Travis and writer Alex Garland.
If, like me, you miss the days when films weren't just an excuse for increasingly overblown and redundant uses of CGI and in service of an actor's ego, at the expense of a compelling narrative, then Dredd is the film for you and should be ordered without hesitation.",1356307200,3,1818,4.983552631578948

When a triple homicide happens at a block high rise, our duo goes to investigate only to uncover a large scale drug operation. The drug is called ""slo-mo"" and gives one a slow motion sensation which adds to the special effects as we get to see plenty of slow motion killings.

I would be ashamed to give it to somebody or even have it on my shelf after seeing Dredd!!! The 94 version is practically a Candy Factory reproduction of the 2000ad Comic which origins are Hardcore and from the GUT!

Karl Urban plays an UNEXPECTED role as Dredd which surprised me and I didn't take him seriously to begin with when I saw the previews on TV. I was like ""Karl Urban! Dredd! get outta here!"" just never imagined him playing a role like this and he kicked ass! But I must save the best for last, Lena Heady, WOW, lena plays Ma Ma, an evil, psychotic, insane, demented, deranged, Drug Lord who leads a band of psychotic lunatic misfits, may I say more! how often do you get to see an actress play a psycho who actually makes you feel uncomfortable....She did! Lena Heady took the show! Olivia Thirlby plays the Rookie Anderson who's a telepath and Dredd's Trainee, she was also impressive and her character was most definitely needed to make the story click.

It was full of all the typical clichs of a 90's action movie and some hilarious over the top acting such Stallone screaming and mispronouncing the word LAW over and over. Now it would be a few years till I actually saw it as I was just a kid back then and even a few more years till I learned that Judge Dredd is based on a comic book and pretty much all the comic fans hated the movie. One of the big complaints fans had is that Dredd is never supposed remove his helmet. Ever. Well, fans can be happy that you never see his entire face in this new movie and it actually works well in adding to the character's badassness. The overall look and feel of the movie is far more gritty, dark, and violent than the previous film.  It should please the fans and seems to be pleasing the critics surprisingly which is one of the main reasons I decided to check it out. A movie like this could easily be horrible and it wasn't. It's nothing more than what you'd expect from an R-Rated action movie but it proves to be quiet entertaining.

  The story is quite a simple one. Instead of having a complicated story like the 95 movie which goes into conspiracies and Dredd's past, it focuses on a really bad day type scenario. In the future, the remains of the US are walled into a super city. Crime rates sky rocket and a special police force known as the Judges act as judge, jury, and executioner for dealing with all the crime and they deal with it very harshly. The most badass and feared of these judges is Judge Dredd played by Karl Urban. This day he takes under his wing rookie Judge Cassandra Anderson played by the lovely Olivia Thirlby. Anderson is special because she is a mutant and has telepathy and they believe her powers will be useful and they are. While investigating three murders inside one of the mega block, 200+ floor apartment complexes that fill the city, they happen to piss off the head of a powerful crime syndicate that controls the building that is lead by Madelaine ""Ma-Ma"" Magrigal played by Lean Heady. I give them props for having a female antagonist. She manages to lock the building down, sealing the two judges inside with hundreds of gang members wanting to kill them. It then turns into something out of a video game as Dredd and Anderson move and shoot their way up the levels and hallways of this mega building. It is actually quite successful in building tension and suspense in several scenes. At only 95 minutes, the movie moves at a good pace though it does have a very lack luster ending and a suddenly plot point that was poorly explained and required me to read Wikipedia when I got home to understand it.

  The gritty and dark tone of the movie never lets up and there is very little humor (though it didn't stop us from making our own here and there). This movie is also VERY violent. If you have a problem with graphic violence, DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE. A head melts within the first ten minutes and it just keeps getting worse from there. The acting is nothing special. There are no over the top lines like from the 95 movie. Karl Urban does a good job of keeping Dredd cool and level headed but totally badass at the same time but I do miss Stallone yelling `I AM THE LAWL!' We get no real character development out of Dredd so if you like to see character development in main characters you will be disappointed. Olivia Thirlby is the only character with development in the movie as the clich trial by fire rookie but does well with the role and she is nice to look at. Lean Heady's acting is very subdued but you can tell she's evil and twisted in her actions and body language more than in her dialogue.  Everyone is more or less a clich or a target to be shot or die in some horrible way. The action scenes are well done and specially the drug induced scenes where a character or more than one character are on a drug called `Slo-Mo' and everything is slowed down and given a heavenly aurora around it. It makes for some interesting and artistic action scenes. Now I saw this movie in 2D but everyone says it is amazing in 3D. If you know me, you know that I HATE 3D movies but I will admit that these drug induced shoot'em up scenes would look pretty cool in 3D. Does this is mean I'm going to go see it in 3D just for that stuff? Hell no.

Overall, it's a cool little action movie that does much more JUSTICE to the source material than the 95 Stallone movie did and it should please fans. Even if you aren't a Dredd fan or know nothing about the comics in which it is based on and enjoy gory, mindless action films, you should have a hoot with this.

I watched the 3D version first and I was blown away with the ultra-slow motion and 3D accentuations.  The director did a wonderful job of portraying really brutal scenes artistically with the use of the slo-mo and 3D.  While it's true the story is similar to another recent release, The Raid, Dredd has enough differences to stand on its own (futuristic wasteland, Judges, sci-fi elements, and no martial arts).  While I am a comic book fan, I've never really read any Dredd comics but I'm familiar with his character.  Karl Urban does a fantastic job as Dredd and does so without ever removing his helmet.  Kudos!  This movie is a pure action flick so be prepared for a lot of shotouts and over the top action.  It was a shame so few went out to watch this film as it will definitely become a cult classic.  After watching the 3D version I decided to watch it again but in 2D for two reasons, 1) I really enjoyed the movie and wanted to see it again and 2) I wanted to support the film financially in hopes that a sequel would be considered/made.  So yes, I enjoyed the film enough to rescreen it and I was hoping/wanting a sequel to see where the directors would take these characters.  As for the 2D version, I liked it as well.

This despite the fact that I'm a monster fan of Karl Urban, I have to say: Be prepared to be bored to death. And without a shot of 'SloMo' - though it certainly felt like it.

A bland and routine tale with little to offer. It's certainly not innovative. Nor fresh. Not particularly exciting. And surprisingly, it's not even mildly funny. Not that I expected the latter given the early reports I read about the script going ""darker"". But if you're going to cut away the fat, the least you can do is leave some meat.

Honestly not sure what the point of this film was? The tiresome clich&eacute;s were numerous. A drug dealer takes over an entire building. While delivering justice in an ugly unfair world, a hardened street judge has the unenviable task of reviewing the performance of an untested rookie. Trapped, alone, and fighting for their lives - the pair have to find a way out of the drug lord's domain.

What - that's it? A pedestrian shoot'em up?

In all seriousness, did Director Pete Travis even read the original comics? There's *nothing* in this film that even remotely suggests he did. And one has to ask: Why not, no pun intended, draw from the source material? Where are the Judges of John Wagner and Brian Bolland? Where's the dark satirical humor? Where's the iconoclast with a wit and insight to the gritty underbelly of humanity?

This is the second recent action flick I've screened where slow-motion was integral to the cinematography and plot. This is so 1980s and well beyond pathetic. Is there something wrong with using straight CGI platforms in 2012?

And that brings up the question: Is the current fascination with 3D so effective a gimmick that sheeple are scammed into believing it makes up for a creative story and proper direction? It doesn't. Not by a long shot.

Also, what was the point of constantly showing the elevator going up and down throughout the movie?!

Yeesh.

The only performance of note: Wood Harris, who played Kay. An actor who has been flying low but steady the past few years, producing yet another excellent execution. Definitely deserves larger and better roles. Certainly has the acting chops for it.

I want, more than anything else, to know where the director of the extremely entertaining '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vantage-Point/dp/B0018CWW32/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vantage Point</a>' was during the filming of this retread schlock?

I got to see a Dredd for free thanks to a friend from college who is an assistant manager at a Regal Cinemas nearby and I got to see a great film. First before I go on to my review of the film I need to tell you two things. First I'm not as big of a hater of Stallone's Dredd as others. I believe I gave the film 2.5 stars if I remember correctly. Stallone was not good as Dredd unless you use his acting performance as comedy. Armand Assante who I think is a really good, but not great actor does a decent job as the bad guy, but he wasn't the right actor for it. The plot was overblown and ridiculous. The action and special effects were good, and Rob Schneider was good as the comedic side kick. He's funnier as a sidekick then staring in his own films. I know people bash it because it wasn't like the comics which leads me to my second thing I need to tell you. I have never read the comics, so I can only judge this film on the cinematic quality or simply how much I liked it or not. I don't know why I haven't read the comics. I just never got around to it. There are hundreds if not thousands of different comics out there. I can't read them all. Though hopefully after seeing this film I'll find the time download them or read them online, so again this is only a review of the film. I'll leave that kind of review for the people who've read the comics.

As for Dredd is an awesome film, but not perfect. It has its limitations with its budget and story, but again it's a great action film. The story like I said is pretty simplistic. Anyone who's seen the recent film The Raid: Redemption will find similarities with their plot, though this film is much better. It is sometime in the future after some kind of nuclear war and one of the few places that remains is Mega-City One that encompasses the range of Boston to Baltimore. There in this hell hole of survivors fighting for survival the only organization that keeps order are the Judges. Two judges Dredd (Karl Urban) and the rookie physic judge Cassandra Anderson (Olivia Thirlby) who's failed her training tests and the Hall of Justice only gives her another chance with Dredd for her physic abilities. These two judges head to the Peach Trees Tower where three men have been murdered. The two judges investigate and capture a small time drug leader who deals in the new drug called Slo-Mo, which slows the brain down and everything seems to go in slow motion. The drug kingpin of the entire 200 story building Ma-Ma (Lena Headey) can't let the man testify and seals down the building from there the action and fun truly begin. On a side not I can see this possibly happening sometime in the not too distant future where the US is a police state. I'm sure some would say were already there. As I said a pretty simple plot, but as I said it works for this film. From what I hear and read this film had a budget 45 million. I could be wrong, but even if I am by today's standard of action/Sci-fi films it isn't much and not even have the budget of Stallone's film. The writers of this film knew the constraints they had and kept things simple focusing mainly on three characters. The partner/mentor relationship between Anderson and Dredd, and Ma-Ma and it works really well.

It's a risk having your main character head covered the entire film, but it works in this film and that is thanks to Karl Urban who blows Stallone's performance away. Even with the helmet on Urban is still able to give a human element to Dredd. Over the last handful of years I've come too really like the actor. He was one of if the only bright spot in Doom and of course his great role as Dr. Leonard McCoy. This is an actor who needs to be given more chances to shine. The gorgeous Olivia Thirlby also did a superb job as Judge Anderson. She really shows the scared and damaged emotions of the mutant physic who wants to become a judge and her growth in the film. I had never heard of the beautiful actress before this film, but she can act and I hope to see her in more films. The chemistry between the partners was great, and if there is a sequel which I truly hope this film makes enough money for then I would really like to see them as maybe partners. How many cop action films have a man and woman as partners? I can't think of any off the top of my head. The two did a really good job and I think it can work again in sequel. Lena Headey is another actress I haven't really heard of. I was surprised to see that she played Sarah Conner in the Terminator TV series and Queen Gorgo. I did not remember that. Anyway she did a good job playing the ex-hooker turned ruthless drug kingpin. Oh I also forgot to mention Wood Harris who plays Kay the guy the judges arrest and Ma-Ma doesn't want to testify. Yeah the film has a tiny cast with one or two minor roles and tones of extras, but like I said the writers new their limitations with the budget they had.

The slow motion worked in this film. I was a little nervous like I think others were about the slow motion scenes in the film, but it worked great enhancing the action. I also think it worked because they didn't go overboard with it. The action in the film was raw and gritty, and great. This is definitely an R-rated action film and to be honest this is more of an action film then Sci-fi film. Though there is a lot of blood I don't think the effects people went overboard with it keeping it believable. The effects were just decent. You could tell that the director and effects people had a limited budget, but I think it was a good thing. For a first film of a possible franchise you need to keep things simple. That was one of the problems with Stallone's Dredd. I think they tried to do this overblown action Sci-fi film with at the time a limited fan base. That was before comic film skyrocketed. This Dredd on the other hand doesn't try to do too much with the effects and it works.

Pete Travis the director along with Reliance and DNA films did a good job with the making of Dredd. The other film I saw that Travis directed was Endgame staring William Hurt, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Johnny Lee Miller is a good film and shows how good a job Travis can do with a limited budget. I think he perhaps even does a better job with this film as it is his first time doing a comic action/sci-fi film. I also need to give credit to Reliance, DNA the production companies along with the distributor Lionsgate for taking a chance with the film after the total bomb of the previous Dredd film. Lionsgate is turning into one of my favorite production/distributing film studios. Sure like every studio they've made some bad films, but in recent years the quality of their films have gone way up and they've been making better films all around.

Don't go into Dredd expecting a Sci-fi film or out of this world special effects because you won't get them. Overall Dredd is a great action film with a limited to mid-range budget with a good story, great acting, great action, decent special effects, and good directing. This film makes Stallone's Dredd look like a pile of sh*t. The film doesn't have to have a sequel, but I hope it earns enough for one. I haven't read the comics, but I think people who have will enjoy this film as well along with everyone else. Give Dredd a chance and remember to keep your eyes open for Karl Urban and Olivia Thirlby two good actors who need to be recognized.",1350086400,6,7428,4.2915181753385605

I usually avoid 3D movies as they give me a headache, so I took some paracetmol with me to the cinema.  What can I say, it was so good I went and saw it again.  Paracetmol, headache and all, it was worth it!  I'm just really hoping they will make another/sequel.  Can't wait for it to come out on DVD!",1349654400,3,428,4.234567901234568

So, what can I say, the action was okay, but it could had been better. Dredd basically goes to this one building and is trapped inside. That makes it basically one location in the whole movie and nothing other places until the end, which was the same other location in the start of the movie. Also, he doesn't ever take off his helmet from beginning to the end. For some strange reason, the makers didn't feel like we needed to see the face of Dredd. Maybe he is too ugly? I don't know. lol

The direction of the film is slowww and boring! The story was retarded. There is no need to watch this film and doesn't even come close to buying it. Save your money! You thank me later.",1349222400,9,940,4.15934065934066
4800262,5,B005LAII7G,"It is an utter crime how this movie flopped at the box office. To be honest I had no idea what to expect when I entered the theater to see this movie. Initially i wanted to go see ""Looper"" but for some reason at the time I was in the mood for something less cerebral, so me and my buddy chose to see Dredd 3D after a class mate told me to check it out and that it was phenomenal.  My God, I was completely blown away! I was so blown away that I went to see it again immediately the next day!

You can tell the director of this film really cared about the project. I felt his heart and soul within every composition and frame. Before this film I use to be anti-3D but after I saw this, it completely changed the game for me, yes even more than ""avatar"" did. This was the first time I felt that the only way to experience this film was in 3d. even though this film failed at the box office, i feel as if i was part of something special because i was one of the few who saw it in 3d at the theaters. All those people who are going to rent it or buy it on DVD/blu ray will be missing half the experience in my opinion. Too bad for you guys!! And if there ever was a movie that would consider me to covert my home theater into 3d, it is this one.

The way the film makers utilized slow motion was the best I have ever seen since the ""Matrix"", maybe even better. Lately I've hated the way recent films have used slow mo, just for the sake of it (Sherlock Holmes) but Dredd actually uses it to engross the audience further into the story. I loved the way the cinematography switched up during these scenes, making the drug scenes feel surreal and beautiful at the same time. That, accompanied with the amazing score, really made me feel like i was on a wild thrill ride. I haven't had this much fun at the movies in a while. This year has been a great year for movies. i loved ""Prometheus"", ""Dark Knight Rises"" and ""Avengers"" and even ""Looper"" but Dredd was the most fun and mind blowing of them all, despite it's simple down to earth story line. In fact I think it was the simplicity of the story that made it so great. It didn't try to have Dredd save the damn world. it was literally like watching John McClane in ""Die Hard."" It was all about survival!!

Karl Urban was great as Dredd. He really knew how to internalize all the angry emotions of the character and I commend his performance especially since we never got to see his eyes. He always retained a calm but ruthless demeanor. Lena Headey was chilling as Ma-Ma, I'm glad to see her still getting work after her underrated and beloved performance as Sarah Connor in the Terminator TV series (if you haven't seen that show, check it out, you won't regret it!). Olivia Thirlby did a decent job playing the rookie/dredd's side kick. At first I thought she was too young for the role but her character contrasted well with Dredd's character. At times I thought the made her appearance too pretty but she carried the role good enough to make me overlook that.

If you like films such as ""Die Hard, Robocop, The Crow, or Darkman"" YOU HAVE TO CHECK THIS FILM OUT!! It's a true action film masterpiece that put's the Expendables to sleep! This is easily one of the best R rated films to come out in a long time. These days everything is PG-13 just so the studio can sell more tickets and it was like a breathe of fresh air to see all the action and gore done in a way that wasn't gratuitous but servicing to the story and suspenseful atmosphere the film was trying to create for the viewer. I haven't seen violence in an action film done this well since the 80's. Everything about this film is fresh and exciting. The only thing that I can nit pick about was some of the supporting characters (Ma-Ma's henchmen) acting was bit forced but what do you expect from a low budget film? This film is one of the best-low budget films ever made and proof that you don't need hundred's of millions to deliver the goods. i think the reason why people didn't check this out was because folks thought it was a remake of the the Stallone film. My god, how they were wrong! TOO BAD FOR THEM!! Even though in my opinion I feel that a non 3D version of this film won't be as good as the 3D one I'd still recommend it to anyone, whether 3D or 2D. I'm definitely purchasing this when it comes out!",1349222400,263,4325,4.206024096385542

4800354,1,B005LAII7G,"OK. I'm coming out of Amazon-review retirement to write this.

I'm a huge Judge Dredd fan. I discovered the character in the `80s when Eagle Comics reprinted the British 2000AD Judge Dredd stories in comic-book form for the American audience. To my delight I discovered the essence of Judge Dredd: shocking violence mixed with wonderful comedy. It was something really new. Dredd became, and remains, my favorite comics character.

Basically, I think DREDD stinks, because it ignores the essence of the character.

People have asked me which is the better Dredd film--the unfortunate version starring Sylvester Stallone, or this humorless blood-and-guts fest. My answer? The best Judge Dredd film was ROBOCOP.

ROBOCOP captured the character of Judge Dredd beautifully--a humorless law man/machine in a hilariously insane future, fighting hilariously insane bad guys. The jokes in ROBOCOP were Judge Dredd jokes. Those of us who understood the tone of the film burst into laughter while others were offended. [By the way, DREDD seems to contain a nod to ROBOCOP, as Dredd gives some baddies ""fifteen seconds to comply."" This was the joke that first stunned ROBOCOP audiences, who found them/ourselves laughing and screaming at the same time.]

If they wanted to throw some lame characters and a lame storyline together just to push the limits of cinematic violence, they should have named the character Judge Bludd and been done with it.

Someone once said the great thing about Judge Dredd is, he doesn't know the joke is on him. He moves straight ahead from one case to the next, battling Mean Machine Angel [who has a dial on his head that makes him more and more violent--""I'm goin' up to four on ya, Dredd!""] and the Dark Judges, led by Judge Death, the ghostly menace who rents an apartment from a little old lady too blind to notice that he's a demon from another world. Judge Dredd takes them all on without once cracking a smile [or removing his helmet, even when he's in a hospital bed.]

Oh yeah, the helmet gag. Stallone had to pull his off at the first opportunity, but the DREDD Judge Dredd keeps his on. A joke-non-joke nobody gets.

In the wonderful world of Judge Dredd the comic, we're in on the joke, and the joke's on Dredd. In the world of DREDD, the joke's on us. And it's not funny.",1349136000,20,2305,4.817721518987342
4800355,5,B005LAII7G,"Just got a chance to see this movie, yesterday. It was great. Karl Urban brought a faithful rendition to our favorite judge, Judge Dredd. Great visuals and music. I hope that a sequel will be done, despite the low number at the box office. For the cost of making this movie, the cast and film crew have created a cult favorite, that should be commended for. This is no ""Battleship"" nor a 2012, ""Total Recall."" Outstanding movie.",1349136000,3,428,4.571428571428571
4800356,4,B005LAII7G,"I just saw Dredd on Saturday.  Here's my verdict.  While it is not a masterpiece, I thought it was thoroughly entertaining.  It's not like the Stallone vehicle made in 1995.  The best thing in this movie was Lena Headly as MA-MA.  I never heard of her until this film.  She gave an excellent performance.  She created one of the best female villans of filmdom.  I would not want to mess with her. I also thought Dredd's partner, Anderson, provided a good performance.  As for Dredd, Karl Urban was good.  But the women in the film steal the show.

Some of the 3-D effects were quite spectacular. I don't understand why the critics trashed this film.  If you are looking for a decent action film I would highly recommend it.  However, I would not let young children watch this film.  There is a lot of blood and gore.",1348963200,8,816,4.462585034013605
4800357,5,B005LAII7G,"The issue with Hollywood in the past few years is studios' fascination with rebooting anything and everything. That obsession has given us some excellent features, such as Nolan's ""Dark Knight"" trilogy, ""The Three Stooges"", and ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"". However, most of what we get is middling, such as the misguided ""The Amazing Spider-man"", to unnecessary, such as this year's ""Total Recall"", to outright crap, like... well, like the rest of them. So I was a bit gun shy when I saw that Lionsgate was issuing a remake of the abhorrent Sylvester Stallone vehicle ""Judge Dredd."" After some positive reviews came out, I decided to give it a shot. Thanks to that decision, I have a new film that is has been firmly added to my favorite sci-fi features of all time.

In the future, the world is a desert wasteland, and the only life is housed in a giant city spanning multiple U.S. states, appropriately called Mega-City. Crime is out of control in Mega-City, and the only line of defense against them is the Hall of Justice. Working for the Hall are armored super-cops called Judges, who possess sweet motorcycles, tight leather chaps, and pistols that are capable of firing explosives, taser rounds, and splitter shots, to name a few. The best of these Judges is Dredd (Karl Urban), a seemingly emotionless man whose only goal in life is to deliver fair, by-the-books justice. But when he is tasked with training the unstable, psychic rookie Judge Anderson (Olivia Thirlby), his morals are put to the test. The two find themselves locked in a 200-story apartment complex, and pitted against an army of goons amped up on a dangerous drug called ""Slo-Mo"", all controlled by the ruthless gang boss affectionately called ""Ma-Ma"" (Lena Headey.) Throughout the course of one night, they must survive both their assailants and each other.

""Dredd"", in the face of so many detractors (myself included), is a triumph in both action and science fiction cinema. Its gunfights are more tense than any scene in ""The Expendables 2"", and the near-future setting is far more enthralling than anything we saw in ""Prometheus."" The dialogue is very minimalist, and fits the overall tone of the film quite well. Dredd's one-liners never feel hammy and are always natural, thanks to Urban's surprising performance. Thirlby conveys her character's pathos and apprehension beautifully, to the point of her almost stealing the show from everybody else in the movie. Rivaling her is Headey, who is deliciously evil and obviously having a great time playing somebody with no redeeming qualities whatsoever. This is a movie that one could watch and enjoy for the acting alone.

Action buffs have nothing to worry about, either. The shootouts are exciting and packed with some of the most visceral gore this side of a slasher flick, yet never cross into exploitation territory. More tension is packed onto these scenes due to the fact that ammo conservation and utilization of stealth are very real issues, giving more realism to the situation. The two Judges never feel superhuman, and are just as vulnerable as the droves of criminals that they pump full of lead. Special props should also be given to the slow motion effects, which are some of the best I've seen since ""300"", and in my opinion, raise a new standard from what we should expect from a Hollywood blockbuster. This film has less than a quarter of ""Avatar""'s budget, yet its effects are far more convincing, and I daresay better, than James Cameron's $300 Million+ ego trip. Studios need to take note that it's not the size of the budget that matters, it's all in how you use it.

Every element of this film holds up to critical scrutiny, from the acting to the dialogue to the action sequences. Even Paul Leonard-Morgan's score is enthralling. A sci-fi/action movie hasn't captured me this much since ""The Matrix"", or even ""Terminator 2: Judgement Day"", two films which I feel are on this one's level. This is one example of a reboot that went beautifully right, and a definite must-see for moviegoers. ""Dredd"" is a triumph in action cinema, in sci-fi cinema, and in film in general. One of this year's best movies, one of the best action films of the past decade, and arguably the best reboot since ""Batman Begins.""

4800359,3,B005LAII7G,"I must confess to be in the minority in my reaction to Dredd 3D as I found it a very uneven mix.  Parts of it - mainly the 3D parts showcased in the early parts of the film and in the climactic scene near the end - I felt were dazzlingly well done, one of the rare instances where I felt a film made truly good use of 3D.  But the rest of the film, the bulk that lies between those two dazzling parts, I found to be tedious, cliched and highly derivative, particularly of 1981's Outland with Sean Connery, from which most of the plot developments in the middle were basically lifted.

Directed by Pete Travis from a screenplay by Alex Garland, Dredd is adapted from the long-running British comic book character Judge Dredd, originally created by John Wagner (writer), Carlos Ezquerra (artist) and Pat Mills (editor) back in the 1970's. Set in a highly dystopian future about seventy years from now in which most of what's left of civilization is a savage urban ruin and the only source of law and order are the Judges, a mobile police force in which each Judge combines all law enforcement functions rolled into one: policeman, judge, jury and executioner. Particularly executioner.  They are heavily armed, heavily armored and empowered to dispense justice on the spot as they see fit. Dirty Harry crossed with the Terminator, in spades.

The film begins in Mega-City One, a violent megalopolis of 800 million sprawled across the east coast of the US. Judge Dredd (Karl Urban) is in pursuit of a vehicle whose occupants are using ""Slo-Mo"", an addictive new drug that slows the user's perception of time to one-percent of normal. After chasing down and taking out the offenders with his Lawgiver, a special Judge's pistol that fires six different types of ammunition, Judge Dredd returns to base and is assigned by the Chief Judge (Rakie Ayola) to conduct an assessment of a rookie Judge named Anderson (Olivia Thirlby). A marginal candidate whose performance in training was only middling and who has thus far failed to pass the necessary tests to become a full Judge, Anderson is being given another chance, mainly because she is something special: a mutant with strong telepathic abilities, a highly valuable asset to have in their line of work. Dredd begins his assessment by bluntly informing Anderson of all the ways in which she can fail and nothing about how she can succeed. This is not going to be easy.

At the same time, in a 200-story slum tower block called Peach Trees, drug lord Madeline Madrigal (a riveting and deadly Lena Headey), known as Ma-Ma, punishes three outside drug dealers who intruded on her territory by having them loaded up with Slo-Mo, skinned and then thrown from the top of the tower, the drug making them endure their fatal fall for a hundred times longer than it actually takes. Dredd and Anderson respond to the reported homicides. Once inside Peach Trees, they track down the nearest drug den and assault it, arresting a surviving perp named Kay (Wood Harris), one of Ma-Ma's henchmen. While cuffing Kay, Anderson psychically detects his direct involvement in the murders. She informs Dredd of what she learns, but when Dredd tests her by asking if she's sure of his guilt to see what she'll do, she hesitates, then says she's ""99 percent"" sure. Dredd responds neutrally that 99 percent is not 100 percent. So Kay lives. For now.

Learning of Kay's arrest, Ma-Ma quickly takes measures to prevent the Judges from taking Kay out of the building to where he can be interrogated about her operations.  After her forces seize the tower's security control room, Ma-Ma uses a terrified clan-techie (a very effective Domhnall Gleeson) to seal the building using its blast shields under the pretense of a security test, thus preventing the Judges from leaving or summoning help. After this point, the task for Dredd and Anderson becomes quite simple (and quite familiar): survive the hordes of bad people trying to kill you, and keep your prisoner alive in the process.

To be honest, I'm somewhat surprised at the number of fans of the comic book who seem to like this adaptation.  I say this because what I really liked about the comic was the dark ironic humor that ran all through it, a quality that Dredd 3D is, in my opinion, utterly lacking. I can't blame Urban for this as I know from his performance in Star Trek that he can do subtle humor extremely well. The fault really lies in Garland's screenplay. One gets the impression that he never actually read the comics and just skimmed a wiki entry on the character to get a handful of basic facts to work from. And while director Travis does do a quality job with the action sequences, he too just didn't seem to get that humor is also about _timing_, robbing the few scenes which could have been darkly funny of the impact they might have had in more deft hands.

The casting was something of a mixed bag as well. While I loved Karl Urban's McCoy in the Star Trek reboot and his Julius Caesar in the Hercules & Xena TV series, and while I consider him extremely talented and highly charismatic, I felt he was somewhat miscast here. In staying true to the original character, Dredd keeps his helmet on through the entire movie so that the only part of his face you can see are his nose, mouth and jaw, so for this role you really need an actor with a distinctive jaw and mouth. Talented as he is, this is something Urban lacks. This caused additional problems in the when other Judges arrive on the scene as I found it hard at times to tell them apart in certain scenes since, with the helmets on, they all tended to look alike. (I found myself actually missing Sylvester Stallone's Judge Dredd from the 1995 film because of his distinctive jutting jaw and perpetual sneering lip that made him easy to recognize even with the helmet on. The movie was largely crap but physically Stallone was perfect for the role).

Olivia Thirlby was also, I felt, somewhat miscast as Anderson. Judge Anderson was one of the original characters from the comic book and rather different from the way she was portrayed here, but even ignoring that, it's just hard to visualize Thirlby's soft and pretty ingenue-ish Anderson as ever being able to really be a Judge. It's also hard to believe her having the tough-orphan backstory she supposedly has in the film. Acting-wise she does a creditable job given the limitations of the script, but they would've done better to cast someone with harder edges to her and the film would've worked better as well.

On the plus side, Lena Headey's Ma-Ma dominates every scene she's in. Not surprising when you remember that Headey has also been Cersei Lannister in Game of Thrones, Sarah Connor from Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles, and Queen Gorgo from 300. Even with her face made up to be seriously scarred, Headey is still darkly beautiful, tough and riveting, her eyes so piercing it's like watching a deadly cobra toying with her prey.  The parts of Dredd that work best do so mostly because of her. Also on the definite plus side is Domhnall Gleeson, the unnamed ""clan techie"" (that's the way he's listed in the credits) who carries out Ma-Ma's orders in tracking and trapping Dredd and Anderson.  Son of veteran actor Brendan Gleeson, Domhnall Gleeson is probably best known as Bill Weasley from the last two Harry Potter movies and the unfortunate Moon from the Coen Brothers' True Grit. In this film, Gleeson takes what might have been a throw-away part and throws himself completely into it, radiating a kind of jangled-nerves terror as he does Ma-Ma's bidding. (Note: Gleeson's eyes are subtly altered with special effects, hard to put your finger on at first but becoming more evident as the film goes on.  It's never explained why they're different however. I'm guessing that it might be because he's another mutant but it never comes up.)

And as I indicated at the beginning, the most dazzling parts of the film are the 3D scenes where you're immersed in what it feels like for characters under the influence of Slo-Mo. It was a very creative use of 3D that fit perfectly with the plot, and I found the 3D capture of the smoke wisps in those scenes to be particularly fascinating. Most of the time I feel that the 3D in films is wasted or more often just pointless, but in Dredd 3D I felt that it did contribute in a real and meaningful way to the scenes in question.

Recommended for the creative use of 3D in the drug sequences, for Lena Heady's performance, and for die-hard fans of the Judge Dredd comic book character. It's far from being the ultimate Judge Dredd film adaptation, but it might keep you until that much hoped for adaptation finally does happen.",1348617600,5,8699,4.693114754098361
4800360,4,B005LAII7G,"I was excited to see Dredd all summer long, but with awesome movies like The Dark Knight Rises and The Avengers I wasn't going to let a potentially bad Dredd film ruin my summer. Then the reviews started coming in from the 2012 Comic-Con screening and they were almost all positive. I was starting to get excited again. Then Dredd was released in England and the reviews were extremely positive from fans and critics alike. I went in with modest expectations and Dredd blew me away. It was an absolutely insane mixture of action, dark humor, trippy visuals, electronic music (think John Carpenter meets Trent Reznor), cool future tech and great costuming. Dredd is better than expected and truly one of the coolest films to come along in many years. As much as I loved The Dark Knight Rises (saw it 4 times), Dredd may have more replay value due to it's memorable characters & action, epic gore and tight running time. Urban nails Dredd, Ma-Ma is a fantastic villian and Judge Anderson keeps things grounded. This movie is RoboCop meets Escape From New with a touch of Road Warrior thrown in for good measure. The poor US box office (people are morons) threatens the franchise but I suspect great word of mouth with put Dredd into the cult classic status very soon and we can hope for a sequel. If there is never a sequel, I'm thrilled we have this movie to rewatch for years to come.",1348617600,11,1384,4.584677419354839
4800361,5,B005LAII7G,"First off, let me say that I am biased to this particular comic book character.  I've been a fan since the late '80s and have wanted a film adaptation for a long time.  I am not saying that I am pre-disposed to like this film.  In fact, quite the contrary is true.  I'm not only coming at this from the point of view of somebody who wants to see a good movie, but as somebody who will be judging this by its adherence to and respect for its source material.

I've been disappointed before.  The Stallone version of the '90s failed this test on both counts.  In fact, the only thing that movie got right was a few beautifully rendered hyper dense scenic shots of Mega City one.  This film didn't have those shots.  In fact, the scenic shots of the city didn't seem that dense at all...yeah there were tall building....but spaced far apart.  It seemed almost like a quaint small city trying to be a big one at the edge of a dessert.  That is...until we are taken inside the city.

This is one of the real coups the film pulls over on us.  A few quick shots of the area around these mega blocks (big...REALLY big...More then twice the size of the Twin Towers big) reveal some familiar (especially if you are a New Yorker) buildings that frankly look like kids toys in comparison.  When we are informed that the city has over 800 million people covering a land mass that stretches from Boston to DC, you have to intake air when you realize the true scale of the shots looking at the city from the dessert.

We are quickly given a day in a life type story focusing on two characters who have an importent yet oddly impotent job in the city.  To maintain order.  And it doesn't take too long until we realize how futile that task is in a city so enormous.

The plot details are somewhere along the lines of a Die Hard film from that point on, but the feelings this setting evokes in us are more akin to District 9.  It's an all together beautiful and disturbing combination the filmmakers utilize quite adeptly.

At some point we are inside one of these big blocks, and the Judges (a hybrid cop/judge given powers to dispense instant justice) we are following through their sadly ordinary day had to shoot lots of people and utter caustic lines like ""Defense noted"" or ""you have ten seconds to comply"".

Did I mention lots of people get shot?  Well... let me put it this way:  LOTS of people get shot.  And we are not spared one ounce of gore when this happens.

The film never really lets up, rather it moves at a brisk pace as our protagonists go about their job.  The titular Judge Dredd is the experienced mentor, putting Judge Anderson through the ropes here.  For those of us familiar with the comics, these are the two biggest characters in the world of Mega City one.  While Anderson does go through changes, this film gives us a bit of her origins (placing this story actually BEFORE the comics really take place).  While she goes from barely competent and wishy washy cadet to the beginnings of the kick ass PSI Judge we all know and love, Dredd himself never breaks a sweat.  In fact, you get the sense that this particular day was no better or worse for him then the day before or the day after.  His actions in the last scene of the film really hammer this home.

This characterization is what really makes the film work.  The sense that this is the norm in this city informes us of the prevailing fatalism that must soak into every citizen.  It is a very bleak dystopian view of the future, that sadly looks all too understandable and real.  We are never told how the human race came to be in those cities, or why they still exist there.  It's only that they ARE there.  And it's left up to us to fill in the importance of that.",1348531200,522,3736,4.3468208092485545
4800362,5,B005LAII7G,"I never considered myself a fan of Judge Dredd in comic book form, nor did I like or enjoy the Judge Dredd movie from the 90's, but deep down I have always responded at some deep emotional level to the potential that I have always seen in what Judge Dredd can be.

I have always yearned for a Judge Dredd which shows not the great and idolized hero of MegaCity One hell bent on protecting it and all creation against some great conspiracy of evil, but instead a simpler Judge Dredd where he is just one of thousands of nameless, faceless Judges who kicks ass, takes names and do their best to protect the innocent.

And at its core that is what this movie is, there are no mentions of cloning or how it is Dredd became who he is, no discussions of his family, no talk even of where he goes and what he does at end of shift. That's why this movie is brilliant, yes believe it or not I said brilliant (and in regards to a Judge Dredd movie?) I'm as shocked as you are. This movie's simple story of a single bust gone horribly wrong mixed with elements of ""Training Day"", ""The Rookie"" and other movies which feature breaking in rookie police officers takes us away from the need to explain things in a grandiose or comic book fashion and instead simply allows us in 90 minutes to ride along with Judge Dredd and Judge Anderson get a quick peek at both the wonders and the grim of the world of MegaCity One.

I highly recommend you see it.",1348531200,5,1435,4.249084249084249
4800373,4,B005LAII7G,"Unless you're a fan of British comics and pop culture, chances are you won't be familiar with 2000 AD's comic hero Judge Dredd unless you've seen the 1995 Judge Dredd movie starring Sylverster Stallone. 2012s Dredd starring Karl Urban and directed by Pete Travis is NOT that movie. And that's good. Travis, Urban, and screenwriter Alex Garland take the character back to his roots and deliver a supreme Judge Dredd movie that properly introduces the iconic character to an American audience and offers a damn good movie while it does.

______________________________________________
The Premise

From IMDB (and written by the Dredd Production staff):

""The future America is an irradiated waste land. On its East Coast, running from Boston to Washington DC, lies Mega City One - a vast, violent metropolis where criminals rule the chaotic streets. The only force of order lies with the urban cops called ""Judges"" who possess the combined powers of judge, jury and instant executioner. Known and feared throughout the city, Dredd is the ultimate Judge, challenged with ridding the city of its latest scourge - a dangerous drug epidemic that has users of ""Slo-Mo"" experiencing reality at a fraction of its normal speed. During a routine day on the job, Dredd is assigned to train and evaluate Cassandra Anderson, a rookie with powerful psychic abilities thanks to a genetic mutation. A heinous crime calls them to a neighborhood where fellow Judges rarely dare to venture - a 200 storey vertical slum controlled by prostitute turned drug lord Ma-Ma and her ruthless clan. When they capture one of the clan's inner circle, Ma-Ma overtakes the compound's control center and wages a dirty, vicious war against the Judges that proves she will stop at nothing to protect her empire. With the body count climbing and no way out, Dredd and Anderson must confront the odds and engage in the relentless battle for their survival.""

Dredd's premise is perfect. It sets up an incredible scope for the movie, and, for the most part, it succeeds. From the ground floor of the Peach Trees Mega Block, to the top, Dredd offers a thrilling suicide run fraught with danger, humor, some character development, and of course, some pretty intense graphic violence. Thankfully Dredd doesn't overdo it for the sake of some petty grindhouse horror-fest (though there are quite a few scenes that will make you cringe). Instead, Dredd offers a pretty good-if straight-forward-story, one that definitely revolves around the titular character, but arguably centers on Anderson. The two together provide the heart and soul of the movie, making each inescapable situation and each violent confrontation nuanced and driven. You won't find anything Oscar-Worthy in Dredd, but it delivers a compelling plot and some really fierce situations that really make Dredd work.

______________________________________________
The Characters

The use of Anderson (Olivia Thirlby) as the audience's gateway to this world is used well: she's a rookie. Not completely helpless, but unaccustomed to the horrors Judges face day to day. Anderson's main role is as a contrast to Dredd himself, the yin to his yang, providing a link to the humanity Dredd is unable to show himself. He is grim, he is a mystery, and you will never see more than his scowling lips and steely jaw for the entire film.

This is not a flaw of the script, or of Urban, but an ode to Dredd's character that director Travis and screenwriter Garland had to work with to keep the character true. See, John Wagner and Carlos Ezquerra-the creators of the character- have often said that the character's face should never be shown. 1995s Judge Dredd biggest flaw-according to many fans-was ignoring one of the character's core design elements. Dredd represents the Law (hence his most-known catchphrase ""I am the Law!"") and he represents it's faceless quality. The Law isn't a person or a feeling, it's a symbol, especially in this horrible dystopian wasteland, a symbol of much needed order. Like Christopher Nolan's Batman in crime-laden Gotham, he represents a symbol, a system he believes in, to his core. Despite this (and how the trailers may seem), Dredd's Dredd isn't a one-note character, and the filmmakers-along with Urban-do well in making Dredd more than a caricature of the grim, gritty hero.

Going into this movie, I expected Dredd to just be this unstoppable instrument of death and destruction. A focused force of nature who stops at nothing to get the job done. And to an extent I was right. After all, the character is slightly influenced by Clint Eastwood's character in Rawhide, the tough, grizzled hero archtype who keeps on coming until justice is served. But there are some nice moments where Dredd's humanity slips through the cracks, where we can see beyond the visor without ever having to see his face. Where we see he is just a man, but a man who believes in a code.

Unlike some trigger happy hero of 90s action cinema, he still follows the rules, even when dragging a suspect with him through dozens of floors could be a liability. When faced with critical situations he still tries to pull the potential out of Anderson, to get into her mind, to see if she she's capable of being the Judge she thinks she can be. And the ally he needs to survive. And when faced with danger, he does get hurt. Sometimes badly.

But even beyond the violence, it's his personality that really makes the movie shine. The one thing that keeps him going, even when knee-deep in the worst the world has to offer, even when he sees how flawed his own system is, is trying to maintain order. As he puts it, thousands and thousands of crimes happen every day. And the Judges can only respond to 6% of that total number. But at least someone's trying. No matter how hard the work, someone has to do it, no matter how dangerous. And when the moment arises, he does crack the occasional one-liner that brings out the humor of an entirely desperate and tense situation.

The biggest flaw in Dredd is in the film's villain, Ma-Ma (Lena Headey). Though not any fault of Headey, Ma-Ma is written as your garden variety bad gal, the typical unrelenting despot willing to sacrifice the lives of anyone to get what she wants. But even in her we see a contrast to Dredd: she does have her own order, her own system, her own answer to the problems of this new world. Arguably, before Ma-Ma arrived was disorder, with three rival gangs vying for territory in Peace Trees. So in her we see a parallel to Dredd's Law: order through violence. But her order is based on corruption, vulnerability, and fear; Dredd's order is through hope and will. Hope that things will-bit by bit-get better. That even those as powerful and frightening as Ma-Ma can be stopped. That order can be restored correctly, eventually.

That people like Dredd will be there even when the world ends and turns to shit.

The Verdict

Dredd isn't perfect. And neither is it for everyone: undoubtedly the M-rated violence may scare some viewers away, and the plot is decidedly simple and straight-forward. But it works. And it stays true to the character.

With some great action, good character development, a grim atmosphere, and good humor, Dredd is worth the price of admission. Go check it out.

4800375,3,B005LAII7G,"And if this is what the future is going to be like then I want no part of it, the violence in some sections was just totally unneeded but what can you expect from a violence prone action piece, it needed to be more engaging even though I thought the scene where they opened up with the motoized machine guns was awesome to an extent where they tore apart the inside of the locked down tower when they went after Dredd and his cohort, the drug kingpin being a female was a switch of pace but overall I'd give it a lackluster performance review.
Still can't beleive a paid $6 bucks for the matinee showing.
I believe that I'll wait for the DVD to come out and then rent it from the library to see the extras but I don't think that I'll be buying it. It wasn't all that good.
I think that the version played by Sly Stallone was played better.

4800376,5,B005LAII7G,"The original ""Judge Dredd"" was released in 1995. Being eleven years old during its release may have contributed to its enjoyment, but there are definitely fond memories of ""Judge Dredd"" being a typical action movie that was over the top, had ridiculous humor, and was entertaining for the silly movie that it was. If there was a movie being released with a big name that was both big in size and in name like Sylvester Stallone then you pretty much knew what to expect back then. The downside was that it went down a different path than the source material; a mistake the remake ""Dredd 3D"" now hopes to rectify.

In the slums of a futuristic city, judges have replaced the police with high tech weaponry and possess the combined powers of judge, jury, and instant executioner. Karl Urban (""Star Trek,"" ""The Chronicles of Riddick,"" ""Doom"") is Dredd; the judge with the biggest and baddest reputation in the city who's perhaps known best for his untamed anger. Dredd is ordered to assess rookie judge Anderson (Olivia Thirlby) and take her out in the field for a day; a sink or swim situation. But when they go to investigate a triple homicide at the Peach Trees city block, they're ambushed by Ma-Ma (Lena Headey) and the Ma-Ma clan.

Upon seeing the trailers and TV spots for ""Dredd 3D,"" you probably noticed how similar it looks to ""The Raid: Redemption."" Peach Trees, the 200-story city block in ""Dredd 3D"" is an awful lot like the 30-story tenement run by Tama in ""The Raid: Redemption."" The surprising thing is ""Dredd 3D"" does its own thing and manages to be at least as good as ""The Raid: Redemption"" because of it.

The humor is a lot more subtle this time around; it's usually very dry and closer to satire than the original ""Judge Dredd."" The ""hot shot,"" ""admirable,"" Kay's (Wood Harris) fantasy about Anderson, and the bum at the entrance of Peach Trees scenes all come to mind. ""Dredd 3D"" spends a lot more time being a straight action film with some pretty great sci-fi elements.

The SLO-MO drug is a really fantastic addition to the film. Not only is it an interesting drug, but it results in some of the best sequences in the movie. The slow-motion effects are incredible. Simple movements look beautiful, you get to admire the mayhem of explosions and the carnage bullets cause to the finest degree, glass sparkles like fine diamonds, and blood pools and splatters in ways you haven't seen in ages. ""Dredd 3D"" is so gloriously violent; it doesn't hold back with any of the gore. People are skinned alive, tossed off 200-story buildings, their eyes are ripped out, they're shot to death, and thrown through windows. It's bloody marvelous!

The unexpected aspect of the movie is how smart it is. The Anderson character in general adds quite a bit to the story. Her interactions with Kay, especially the lecture he gives her and the head games she plays are really well done considering what she's capable of. It's like ""Dredd 3D"" takes several concepts that have the potential to be blown out of proportion, but keep them all grounded and the final result is more spectacular because of it.

Maybe it's because everyone was so dead set on Dredd keeping his helmet on this time around, but Karl Urban really seems to fit the role of Dredd better than Sylvester Stallone. Revisiting ""Robocop"" before seeing this may have also contributed in its extreme enjoyment. The truth of the matter is this is one of the best remakes to come along in quite a long time. Fantastically violent, well-written, and constantly captivating with great 3D effects, ""Dredd 3D"" is one of the most superb action films of the year. Ignore the box office results for its opening weekend; this is the type of movie that demands to be seen in theaters.",1348358400,8,3737,4.697709923664122
4800377,4,B005LAII7G,"I'm not a comic book geek so I'm not familer with Dredd's history.  I'm also not a fan of the original Judge Dredd with Stallone.  I can say that I enoyed this version for the most part.  The film only gives us a brief view of the city before the action starts.  Otherwise most of the film takes place inside a drab high rise.  I had to see the film in 3D due to limited screenings for the 2D.  I'm not a fan of 3D or an expert but I thought the 3D FX were not that impressive.  There was plenty of beautiful slow-mo and close up head shots though.

Karl does a good job as Dredd playing a man of action but few words.  The film is dark, bloody, beautiful and yes even a little poetic.  I hear that comic book fans were glad that Dredd keeps his helmut on for the whole film.  I for one had a hard time finding a emotional connection with his character.  You never see his eyes so I had a feeling of disconnect.  So Dredd remains a mystery at least to me but then maybe that's the whole point.  Who is Judge Dredd?",1348358400,,1014,3.9800995024875623
4800378,5,B005LAII7G,"When I left the theater after seeing Dredd, I had to pinch myself. It is the first action movie I have seen since perhaps Terminator 2 in which I was fully engrossed and thoroughly entertained throughout. I initially had my doubts about Karl Urban as Judge Dredd, but his performance is stellar, perhaps phenomenal. Urban's delivery of Dredd's famous signature one-liner was goosebump-inducing in so much as it captured everything that is Judge Dredd with ne'er a hint of effort. I never felt like I was watching Karl Urban as Judge Dredd; I was simply watching Judge Dredd himself. Olivia Thirlby and Lena Headly also offer up flawless performances as the rookie Psy-Judge Anderson and criminal queen-pin Ma-ma, respectively. I applaud Alex Garland's decision to leave Dredd's helmet on for the duration of the film, paying homage to the comics and lending an air to the character that would vanish were the helmet to come off. Though, this movie goes beyond merely fulfilling every Judge Dredd fan's dreams. It is, even to the uninitiated, a thoroughly enjoyable action movie bereft of the undesirable corniness and bad acting which so often plagues the genre. Dredd is truly an instant cult classic.",1348358400,4,1202,5.015
4800379,4,B005LAII7G,"When it comes to action movies, there seem to be two kinds: those that go into philosophical issues, and explore the deeper aspects of being human.  Other action films are content to simply blow stuff up without a second thought, and never going further then that.  It's the rare action film that manages to find a balance between the two, and ""Dredd"" manages to hit that sweet spot.

Taking place in the late 21rst century, ""Dredd"" follows the exploits of Judge Dredd, who fights for law and order in a chaotic post-apocalyptic city where crime runs rampant.  While taking out a rookie cop on a routine patrol, Dredd finds himself trapped in a high-rise tower with a literal army of criminals eager to take him down.  Little do they know that they might just be the hunted, rather then the hunter.

What's most surprising about ""Dredd"" is that it feels exactly like an 80's action flick, complete with a dystopian future, lots of gunfire, hard-boiled cops taking on psychopaths, and a story centered about drugs.  And that's what ""Dredd"" aspires to be: a really solid action film, and in that, it succeeds.  Its pace is steady, the story is good, the acting is good, the production values and the look of the film are high, and it mettles out enough action and justice to keep the audience satisfied, while even tossing in little moments of moral ambiguity in how law and justice can really even be applied to such a hellish world (how do you react when two kids come at you with guns?).

What truly surprises me is that ""Dredd"" has no real weak spots.  It is, in all ways, a very solid 80's action movie that just happened to be made almost thirty years after that era.  Solid and with its own brand of charm that only comes in seeing criminal scumbags being blown away by equally tough cops, it's a genuine treat for action fans who don't mind a little bit of intellectual charm to go with all the gunshots.",1348358400,4,1910,4.539358600583091

The 2012 reboot is a dark, dirty, grim and ultra-violence masterpiece. It's really a simple film and it does not disappoint. I did saw it in 3D and it's one of the best 3D I have seen in long time.

Karl Urban never removes the helmet, yet his mouth, chin and memorable voice add more personality than one might expect. A very good performance by him. Lena Headey, of Game of Thrones and 300 fame, plays a ruthless villain here. Not too over the top, but very believable and menacing. The young girl Judge who gets thrown into the mix because of her ""mutant"" ability to read minds plays off of Urban quite well throughout the movie.

There's brief moments of respite from nearly 90 minutes of non-stop gun violence and action. Urban portrays Judge Dredd well and Anderson plays the other side to the black-and-white judge with a more gray-tinted outlook on how to dispense justice.
