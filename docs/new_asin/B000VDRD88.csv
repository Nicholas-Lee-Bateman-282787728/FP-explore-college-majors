8218301,5,B000VDRD88,Magnificent documentary. Very hard to not get emotional watching it if you've ever been inside the place back in the glory days. Filmmakers did an excellent job trying to cover both sides of the demolition debate as it was unfolding. The vintage interviews are fantastic throughout. So glad they created a DVD edition with expanded interviews as special features. A must for any Baltimore sports fan!,1475625600,,400,5.075757575757576
