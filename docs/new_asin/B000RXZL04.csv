2876523,5,B000RXZL04,I have always been a fan of these movies and never owned them before. The price was great and it allowed me to get both movies at 1 low price!!,1193616000,,143,3.8
2876524,3,B000RXZL04,"I bought this a couple weeks later after its release and it was not what I expected.

- The bad thing id that the main menu is the same as in Apocalypse, it doesn't have any of the special features from the first one, and you can't choose between full screen and wide screen like the second one.

- The good thing is that it includes a few clips from the third one and a few new featurettes.

If you buying it for the special features, wait for the third one to come out on DVD and have the collection separate to enjoy both movies better.",1191628800,4,539,4.066037735849057
2876525,4,B000RXZL04,"I've been a fan of Resident Evil since the first one was released on the PlayStation.  Most movie adaptations of video games tend to fall a bit flat.  I don't think these two Resident Evil movies fall into that category, however.  While the movies didn't follow the game as close as I (or fans in general) would like, I think it did a good job with story.  Unlike most people I know, I'm kind of glad they didn't involve more characters from the games, as I already had their story in my head.  At any rate, for $14 or so, you can't go wrong adding this to your collection.",1190332800,6,573,4.220183486238532

2876529,5,B000RXZL04,"In my opinion the first movie was your introduction and the real movie is the second one. So it makes sense to have them together. It's really easy to watch the first one and move on to the next. (I don't know how I feel about the rest of the movies though) Lots of action, you feel pretty pumped after watching either, and (in the 2nd one) child zombies- the worst part of any apocalypse! Actually hungry zombie dogs might be the worst part!",1365465600,,442,4.273809523809524
2876530,5,B000RXZL04,"This is a very good start to this movie series. AThe first one is s the best. They have to stop the vires and survive zombies. Both are action packed and if you love zombie movies and super soiders this is for you. Great lead and most video games suck as movies, not this one. This is very good!",1361232000,,295,4.016949152542373

2876533,3,B000RXZL04,"I am a fan of the Resident Evil Movie franchise. This DVD 2 pak is great. The seller and Amazon were  both phenominal. The only problem I have is with the way the movie itself was marketed as having a bridge between movies 2 and 3. There is a special feature called ""Bridge to Extinction"" but it does not give you anymore information on what happens at the end of Apocalypse, to what happens at the beginning of Extinction than you would understand from just watching both movies. If your looking to see what happens to Valentine, or understand what happened in Detroit, you still won't know after seeing the ""Bridge"".",1287446400,,618,4.5675675675675675
2876534,1,B000RXZL04,"I bought this DVD at Best Buy thinking it was a pretty good deal to have both the first and second movie on one disc. I didn't watch it immediately and I've since lost the reciept which is bad for me because when I finally did go to play it, the disc doesn't work. It doesn't start, it just freezes the DVD. A friend of mine said he had the same trouble with the same DVD on his player -- which is a Sony. I have a Panasonic home theatre 5 disc changer. So its not just one dvd player that this version does not work on, but several. I'm guessing it is a flaw in the production.
While the movies are fantastic horror flicks, the DVD it comes on in this case isn't worth the money you supposedly save buying a compilation.",1251417600,,721,4.048951048951049
2876535,5,B000RXZL04,If you like Mila Jojovich then these are a great set of movies.  She kicks butt and is good to look at.  Zombie movies with Mila kick.,1228176000,,134,3.925925925925926
2876536,5,B000RXZL04,I have wanted to get these for quite awhile and decided that getting both at the same time was a bargain.,1224288000,,105,4.0476190476190474
2876537,4,B000RXZL04,"For those who haven't seen probably the most successful adaptation of a video game to live-action film franchise, you might get a kick out of Resident Evil. Starring Milla Jovovich as Alice, a chief security officer for Raccoon City's Umbrella Corporation. Within Umbrella's secret lab called The Hive, a deadly T-Virus accidently gets released, turning most living things into blood-thirsty zombies. Alice, with strange implanted memories haunting her as well, must find a way to stop the virus with a group of various similarly heroic characters, ending up with one last battle with a very large super mutant in end's way.

Sound like a video game? Well both the first and second chapter here at times plays out like one, even though minus a few established characters, the storyline here veers off the original plot laid out by Capcom's original playable ones. But to the moderate, and even the more dedicated ones like myself, Resident Evil is a decent addition into Zombiedom. Of course it's not going to surpass original works like 80's Italian fare or George Romero's original trilogy (even though he was rumored to direct/write the first installment, only to be turned away), but there has been worse Zombie films and Jovovich does do a good job playing the lead.

As for this new re-release combo of the first two films, I was expecting the cheap way out with maybe the original '02 release one discer of the first movie packaged with the Disc One of the sequel. But surprisingly that's not the case. The discs in this set are a brand new piece, with Disc One having BOTH movies on the same DVD-9 single sided, dual layer disc. This was very cool, with a brand new menu with one movie per layer, with only two audio tracks (5.1 English/French). You'd expect that the bitrate would be very low for these movies, but since this was re-encoded in 2007, both movie's rate seem very high, and picture looking superb for SD. As for the second disc, it's a mixed bag. If you were expecting all the bonus features from the 2 Disc individual releases, forget it. Since this release was made just to promote the theatrical release of the third film, '07's somewhat disapointing Extinction, they mostly deal with sneak peeks of it. However, there are a few extras outside of Number Three, but they all deal with Apocalypse, so no behind-the-scenes of the original, not to mention the films themselves are missing their commentaries from those as well. There is a neat trivia game on Disc Two with some pretty hardcore questions on Apocalypse, but they could have easily given us more than what they did.

Overall, this is a great way to get the first two films at a good price if all you're really looking for is the movies and a morsel of extras. As I write this, it's been a year since this was released and I doubt it will be in print for much longer due to Extinction now old news on DVD. But if you don't own the first two films and have interest in modern-day Zombies I'd suggest picking it up cheap, then if you really, really like the films, spend the extra buck and buy the extensive 2 Disc versions and with Extinction, or wait for a possible complete boxset in the future.

2876538,5,B000RXZL04,"Milla Jovovich proves once more that she is not only beautiful but also a great actress. Both films are creating lots of suspense and at times one is terrified by horror. A Must for all friends of movies of this kind. It's fast and full of action, no boring moments. Great entertainment! Good that the third part is already available on DVD which I can highly recommend as well.",1214179200,,378,4.492753623188406
2876539,4,B000RXZL04,"I have on many occasions docked a set a star for absurd pricing.  For instance, most of the STAR TREK sets are subject to this -- though I must add that as I write this review all of the STAR TREK boxes have had their prices dropped down to prices that are actually affordable (if the prices were permanent instead of merely for a month or two, I would probably start collecting some of my favorite series) -- but this is the first time that I can recall giving a disc a star for bargain pricing.  If you have any interest at all in RESIDENT EVIL, they've priced this as a level where you can hardly refuse buying it.

If you want to get at the heart of what keeps all three films in the RESIDENT EVIL series from being very good it is this:  the assumption that surface is everything.  The mark of good movies is the number of subtexts that they generate, but with the RESIDENT EVIL franchise, there is a powerful resistance to subtext.  For instance, even if you want to do an analysis of the tropes that attach to the main character of Alice, you will find resistance at every point.  Why?  Because the film itself has lingered in every frame on surface alone, completely resisting imbuing the film with more than just a succession of glittering images.  There are entire visual sequences that have no function whatsoever but to merely paint a pretty picture.  As a result, human elements are left entirely aside.

This obsession with surface and spectacle is unfortunate because Alice is potentially a fascinating character.  Very occasionally the films in the series almost begin to toy with character development, but always pull back immediately after toying with it for a brief second.  At the hand of more gifted filmmakers, Alice could have had the potential to become a poor man or woman's Ripley or Buffy or Max Guevera.  At the hands of only moderately gifted filmmakers, we get little or no sense of her character, no real idea of what makes her tick, utterly no hint of what she wants, and very, very little about how she feels about things.  Milla Jovovich is so gorgeous that she manages to make us forget how poorly drawn her character is.  But the weak writing and poor direction never allows the films to ascend above slick spectacle.

These first two movies tell the first two parts of Alice's descension into her own nightmare land.  The Alice in Wonderland imagery is reinforced at several points, not least in the original by naming the Hive's computer The Red Queen.  And in the third movie in the sequence, EXTINCTION, a version of ""White Rabbit"" by Collide plays over the closing credits.  During these films Alice, who initially suffers from amnesia, first learns from physical memory that she is a surreally gifted martial artist and weapons user, then recalls that she was head of security at the Hive, and later learns that her blood bonds to the virus that is killing everyone else, enhancing her strength, reflexes, and senses to absurd levels.  What keeps the series from being very good is that the films continually focus on what these powers mean for what she can do to the bad guys, never on how it is affecting her.  Contrast this to the way that this would have been done by any of a number of men (and why is it always men -- why haven't women helmed movies or TV shows with female heroes?) like James Cameron, Joss Whedon, Luc Besson, Ridley Scott, or Ron Moore.  Under any of these there would have been as much or more about what all of this was doing to Alice.  But then, all of these writers/directors/producers are more (or at least as much) concerned with the inner as the outer.

In short, these are extraordinarily superficial films.  All surface, no depth, no interesting characters (mainly because of no character development).  Having said that, the film does present superior surface.  Once you accept that the films have nothing to offer but sheer surface, you can moderate your expectations and just go with that.  Once I realized that these films would not/could not be more than a succession of spectacles, I surrendered and moderately enjoyed them.  Was I ever truly entertained?  Of course not.  Was I bored?  Not really.

I will add one last observation.  The three films that make up the RESIDENT EVIL trilogy (soon to be a quartet, with the addition of RESIDENT EVIL: DEGENERATION) easily comprise the most interesting films ever made based on video games.  That would be a more impression achievement if there had been some really good movies based on that source, but it is unlikely for some time that another game will produce such a film franchise.",1208563200,,4615,4.661310259579728
2876540,5,B000RXZL04,"RESIDENT EVIL:A secret experiment...a deadly virus...a fatal mistake. Based on the wildly popular video game series, Resident Evil is an action-packed thriller starring Milla Jovovich (The Fifth Element), Michelle Rodriguez (The Fast and the Furious) and Eric Mabius (Cruel Intentions) in a battle of good...
excellent movie after all.
RESIDENT EVIL:APOCAL:A deadly virus has been unleashed on the population of Raccoon City. Resident Evil: Apocalypse is a terrifying adventure in survival horror. Milla Jovovich (5th Element, Dummy) returns as Alice, one of only two survivors of the contained biochemical disaster in the first Resident Evil, the $100 million hit that serves as a prologue to the all-out action and horror of Resident Evil: Apocalypse. The film begins where the first film left off, with Alice in the heart of the ravaged and deadly Raccoon City. She has been subjected to biogenetic experimentation by the vast Umbrella Corporation and become genetically altered, with super-human strengths, senses and dexterity. These skills, and more, will be needed if anyone is to remain alive....

2876541,5,B000RXZL04,"Resident Evil & Resident Evil Apocalypse has certainly opened the doors for Resident Evil Extinction. They tell how the Extinction came about for the Earth.

2876542,5,B000RXZL04,Great deal has 1&2 on it you can't go wrong. worth every penny. and even better price! Hard to beat AMAZON,1201392000,,106,4.095238095238095
2876543,2,B000RXZL04,"I'm going to start off saying I'm a huge Resident Evil fan. I've played every single game in the series...twice. Well, more than that actually but for each title I've played the English and Japanese versions (since they always come out earlier). Even the Arcade Gun Survivor games haven't escaped my grasp.

So when I say that the movies based on the game suck, you'd better believe it. The movies not only twisted the material till all semblance of the original was lost, they added in even more nonsensical elements. Alice (the character played by Jovovich) is a lost cause the second she appeared in the first movie. Totally uninteresting, both as a character and a plot device. Ironically, the directors seem to agree as Alice's character is made even more unbelievable in the second and third films (why no RE Trilogy on DVD? Blu-ray has it!).

Resident Evil's plot (the first film) is perhaps the best of all the three movies...maybe because at least they tried to stay true material.'Tried' being the word here.

Despite the Spencer Mansion being drastically reduced in size (not to mention having it's own railway system), the premise of a hidden underground lab underneath a mansion falls in line with the first game.

Sadly, after that the whole thing breaks apart. While initially the premise is sound, as the movie drags on, the absurd nature of some of the events (the main baddie, the 'evolving' Licker simply takes the cake) ground the film firmly in the realm of stupidity. If that doesn't put you off, rest assured the stilted acting and inane stunts will.

Apocalypse, the sequel, fares even worse. Ostensibly the people doing it wanted to show to the fans that they understood the material. They added Jill Valentine and a host of RE3 (the game) characters. The only thing was they forgot to add in a plot...or at least a coherent one. Alice returns super-powered (don't ask...the answer will only kill your brain cells due to it's sheer stupidity) and has to face off with another Umbrella monstrosity called Nemesis.

While Nemesis and Jill look exactly like their video game counterparts, the role they play in the movie couldn't be more different. Jill, instead of being central to the plotline, is simply relegated to the background and Nemesis' mission (which was originally to destroy the surviving Raccoon S.T.A.R.S.) was instead turned to the oft-used plot of pitting two pet projects against one another to see which one is better (Alice or Nemesis). Not satisfied with the depths of depravity the first film sunk to, the people who made the second one upped the ante...and made it even more unwatchable. Even more stilted acting, even cornier lines and even less coherent plots. It's a triple threat of crap!

Sure, the value of the package isn't shabby. Two movies for 12 bucks but hell, even then you're being cheated. The movies aren't the 2 disc versions but rather the bare bones single disc editions. And really, couldn't Sony have delayed releasing this package in the first place till Extinction (the third movie in the series) was on DVD. As I mentioned before, they've done it for Blu-ray but it seems like DVD owners who want to get the whole enchilada in one swoop get screwed.

If you really want to see a good Resident Evil movie, chances are you'll not have long to wait. Capcom's already hard at work producing the next RE film (it's all CG though) and this time it'll be solely based on events of the game (it's even going to be treated as canon...no better guarantee than that!) instead of being 'adapted' or 'influenced' or whatever people want to call it when they don't want to follow the established universe but want to milk the name of a product.",1201305600,4,3700,4.779342723004695

Yeah these movies are not something that would most likely happen but they are very much an action movie. Something is always happening in all of them. If you follow or have watched the whole series, you know things from one movie to another are not the same. In one movie  ""Alice"" may have a certain power and then it is gone in the next. But it is not something that makes them a bad movie they are just what they are, a movie that is a story and only that, a story. Some of the things that happen you can tell that it is from Hollywood and they need more action even though it really goes over the top. If you like these types of movies then you will like these.
