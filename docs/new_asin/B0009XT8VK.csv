2337666,3,B0009XT8VK,"I Accuse is about a accusation of rape against a doctor by a patient. The movie suffers from an after school, lifetime movie of the week, which doesnt mean it was bad. It's just not that great, but it still manages to hold your attention. As far as Canadian films are concerned, I Accuse is not great.",1126742400,8,301,4.298245614035087

8070179,4,B0009XT8VK,"I Accuse is a film that started off rather shaky, and gradually won me over as I kept watching and paying more and more attention to the storyline.

Now, Estella Warren is a great actress and a beautiful woman, but her acting skills are a bit off the mark at times.  Just SOME of the time.  I've seen her in other films however, and I believe her acting skills were an improvement in those ones.  Despite that, for the most part she's right on the money in her role as a determined rape victim looking for revenge throughout the movie.

Actually acting improves all around after the first 15 minutes of film.  The movie had trouble getting started thanks to the unacceptable acting skills in the beginning, but once the story heats up, you begin to figure out how the rape took place, and everything seems to click.

You really feel for Estella's character because NO ONE around town believes her when she tells them she was in fact raped.  This was because the doctor who rapes her has a history of being a friendly family doctor.  Eventually she got fed up with everyone and took action herself.

Going to the town cops for help initially didn't help, however over time the truth slowly unravels. The cops eventually believe her story as more unexplainable things start happening, so the cops then go to the doctor and do everything in their power to try and bring the guy down.  However, the doctor has plenty of evil schemes up his sleeve (literally) that enable him to outsmart the cops and his rape victims.

Somewhat weak acting in the beginning, but a film that will certainly win you over by the end.",1268784000,6,1609,4.529411764705882
8070180,3,B0009XT8VK,Disturbing thing about this movie that its based on a true story and the real doctors name is Dr John Schneeberger from South Africa i believe. In real life he continuinly(sp.) raped his 15yr old stepdaughter with that same sedative he used on Estella Warren's character. Ofcourse they don't show that in the movie. Its a decent movie some scenes were a little overacted but still enjoyable.,1181606400,10,391,4.850746268656716
