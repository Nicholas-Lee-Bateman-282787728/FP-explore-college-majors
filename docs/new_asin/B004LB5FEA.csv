4401055,5,B004LB5FEA,"This is one of the best film noir movies ever.  John Payne and Evelyn keyes each have scenes that are so powerful, they should have received oscars.",1362009600,2,148,4.481481481481482
4401056,5,B004LB5FEA,I just caught this film on TCM and I enjoyed the mess that John Payne had to go through a lot of pain on this Film Noir nightmare. there is a nice but brief Karate Vs Boxing scene. It's not full tilt just Judo chops but the build up is nice. I watch for these little pre-martial arts film fad moments.,1358812800,,301,3.9508196721311477
4401057,4,B004LB5FEA,"""99 River Street"" is a distinctly B-movie film noir that is, nevertheless, entertaining, though not imbued with the complex themes one sometimes sees in even B-noirs. Ernie Driscoll (John Payne) attempted a comeback after his boxing career petered out, but that failed spectacularly. Now he drives a cab, and the wife, Pauline (Peggie Castle), who married him when she was a showgirl and he was a rising star, resents their modest lifestyle. When Ernie catches Pauline in a compromising position with another man (Brad Dexter), he becomes enraged. Just when he thinks things couldn't be worse, an actress acquaintance who frequents the same drugstore coffee counter, Linda (Evelyn Keyes), begs Ernie to help her get out of a desperate spot of trouble.

When Foster Hirsch introduced this film at the Noir DC film festival, he called it an ""odd-ball hard-boiled noir."" That it is. The way Linda induces Ernie to help her is especially odd. I suppose it was intended to provide the audience with a surprise. This is clearly a low-budget film, but its weakness is not the drab sets but its narrative contrivances. The writers' methods of integrating and introducing plot elements leave something to be desired in terms of fluidity and plausibility. And they seemed to be trying to fit too much plot into 83 minutes.

The cast is impressive. John Payne effectively conveys Ernie's frustrations and loss of self-worth. Evelyn Keyes, always a great B-movie actress, is good here, though her part doesn't have the weight of her role in ""The Prowler"" (1951), and the way her lipstick was applied beyond the contours of her lips bothered me every time she had a close-up. Jay Adler, of the famous Yiddish theater Adlers, plays the cautious and even-tempered jewel fence Christopher. Jack Lambert, staple of film noir heavies, plays one of Christopher's thugs.

""99 River Street"" was made in 1953, toward the end of the noir cycle. We begin to see elements of 1950s social mores, particularly the emphasis on domesticity. Ernie's boss advises him to convince his wife to have children in order to quell her dissatisfaction. Pauline is a femme fatale, but a powerless one, tied down by apron strings, resentful of her husband and uncomprehending of her lover. She's a strong character, played to perfection by the lovely Peggie Castle, but she doesn't have much room to maneuver. Linda is also strong but less independent than the ""helper heroines"" of 1940s noir. The filmmakers approve of her, because she uses her feminine wiles for a good cause. At least she is allowed to use them, as heroines will not be as he decade progresses.",1351468800,2,2623,4.956818181818182
4401058,4,B004LB5FEA,"I'm a more-than-casual movie fan, but not a scholar by any stretch.  I love black & white movies and actually moved up from a regular DVD player to a Blu-Ray so I could watch incredibly old movies in their most perfect presentation ('Maltese Falcon' and 'Casablanca' were my first two BR purchases).

I thought I knew a fair amount about film noir....the films, the stars, the directors...but I was flabbergasted when I finally watched Phil Karlson's 'Kansas City Confidential.'  What a premise!  What a movie!  What a director!  It was the most excited I'd been since discovering the work of Anthony Mann and John Alton.  I followed 'KCC' with Karlson's 'The Phenix City Story.'  I liked it, but not nearly as much and thought that perhaps Mr. Karlson only had one good noir in him.  Boy, was I wrong.

'99 River Street' is right up there with 'Kansas City Confidential.'  It's another great premise, well executed all around.  I've never seen John Payne in a better role, Evelyn Keyes is terrific and the supporting cast combines to present one of the finest collections of hard-luck faces this side of 'The Hustler.'

I watched '99 River Street' on Netflix (it's in their on-demand library) but I'm here today to buy a copy of my own.  Netflix has made such odd decisions in the recent past that I don't think I want to rely on them to have this movie at their (my) disposal for long...and I know I'm going to watch it again and again.  First rate stuff....and I'm going to turn over rocks to find all the Phil Karlson noir/crime movie I can so I can catch up with this guy's early work.  Those who only know Phil Karlson as the guy who made 'Walk Tall' are missing a great deal of pleasure.

(This gets 4 out of 5 stars because the ending was a little cheesy.  Somehow, I don't think this was Mr. Karlson's fault.  But, still.....)",1339459200,24,1835,4.539634146341464
4401059,4,B004LB5FEA,"Good reproduction of an unrestored film from Warner Bros Archive. Very crisp and clear picture with only very minor flaws and very good mono sound.

I am a big fan of film noir but I had not seen this film before and was surprised as to how good it is. 99 River Street has not gotten the attention or praise it deserves.

A down on his luck boxer who is hunted by the police for allegedly killing a woman - must clear his name by finding the real psychopathic killer before its to late.

99 River Street has the usual classic film noir touches that we all love: A confused and hunted-by-the-law anti-hero, at least one or maybe one and half fem fatales, an assortment of ugly underworld characters, foggy water fronts, sweaty boxing arenas, seedy cafes, dark alleys and an assortment of red herrings.

The acting by the entire cast is very good even if at times there appears to be some overacting. Ahhh but, as it turns out the overacting is deliberate and part of the story. Pretty clever on the part of the film makers.

I also noticed some very aggressive and beautifully rendered, atmospheric mat-shots scattered here and there in the film.

The well written story has some great twists and turns that had me fooled a number of times.

The only thing the film lacks is the ultra cool dead-pan dialogue found in the very top film noirs - Double Indemnity, or Murder My Sweet for example. And **spoiler** I found the ending for 99 River Street to be just a bit too nicey-nice ""they lived happily ever after"" for an otherwise pretty dark film noir.

All that said - I think 99 River Street should be in top twenty-five film noirs - it's a great find.  I highly recommend 99 River Street for lovers of film noir.",1323907200,11,1713,4.447284345047923
4401060,5,B004LB5FEA,This one was a real surprise for me.  Tight story line plus excellent acting by Payne and Keyes.  A great noir and worth the price.,1313020800,15,131,4.2

4401062,4,B004LB5FEA,"Many of us film noir fans have waited a long time for an offiicial studio release of 99 RIver Street starring John Payne.  And while the film was not restored or remastered, it is certainly very watchable,  The package erroneously indicates that this movie is in ""widescreen"".  It's not---the movie was filmed in 4:3 aspect ratio and that is what you see on the DVD.  I was fearful that they would crop the top and bottom of the image for a ""widescreen"" effect.  Don't worry they didn't.  There are no extras--but who cares?",1296345600,51,524,4.580645161290323

4401065,4,B004LB5FEA,"Great old noir--with atmosphere and artistic touches to boot--from the boxing intro that a certain Academy Award director had have to have seen years before his own picture, to the tough and violent finale.  All the noir touches are here--a framed hero, a femme fatale, and the almost entire movie shot at night.  Some dated dialogue, and a bit of overacting--but it's film noir... and one of the near great ones.
  A bit of a plot hole near the end, but maybe you won't even catch it-- if you do, it really won't spoil the fun.",1453680000,4,528,4.46875

John Payne was excellent as the angry hot tempered nice guy and Peggy Castle played the rotten wife to the hilt.

At first I thought Evelyn Keyes performance was a little over the top, but after watching it several times I started to like her more and more.

This is a movie and I  can watch over and over due to the interesting performances and great directing.",1441670400,2,621,4.6422018348623855

A two-timing wife, diamond heist, a frame-up, an acting experiment of unbelievable insensitivity, anger, hostility, frustration, redemption...this is truly a thrilling, action-packed drama.  Keyes is terrific, transforming from intelligent, ambitious woman into willing assistant, even into wriggling seductress.  Payne's boss and his former trainer prove their loyalty.  Ah, if only...

4401088,5,B004LB5FEA,"I have recently been interested in John Payne movies. He's  a good actor but I never heard of him before. I like the general theme of his movies, including this one.

4401090,5,B004LB5FEA,"Ive revisited this one a few times and its one of my favorite noirs. Some may call it a B-grade noir, but I think it has a great story with a perfect antihero.

99 River Street is about an ex-boxer who is living a down and out life as a taxi driver, with a wife who is neither supportive nor honest. Ernie (John Payne) had been barred from the ring because of a serious eye injury, so he drives to make a living. From the get go, you get the sense that his marriage is on the rocks. The big conflict comes in the form of him being set up and framed for murder by a slick and seedy con man. Along the way, an aspiring actress (Evelyn Keyes) joins him on the quest to clear his name, and to find the one responsible for the murder.

Payne does an apt job as Ernie Driscoll, a working class man of principles and ambitions, but with one major flawa vicious temper. Still, Ernie is a redeeming character you want to root for.

99 River Street has everything you look for in classic noirvillains and heroes, atmosphere and mood, suspense and intrigue. Great film and the quality is very good too.",1388016000,2,1091,4.2105263157894735

8434132,4,B004LB5FEA,"Not a perfect film but an entertaining one, made all the better by the excellent commentary track by Eddie Muller.  And for sheer esoterica, the leather flight jacket worn by John Payne is a rare example made by H.L.B. Corp. John Payne serve as a flight instructor during WWII, so the jacket may have been his own.  Note also that during the climactic scene on the wharf Payne wears a different and arguably inferior jacket, likely so as not to damage his personal jacket.  Total speculation on my part but it plays well, just as does this film.",1492819200,3,545,4.540816326530612

8434137,5,B004LB5FEA,"Amazon has the unfortunate habit of lumping all reviews for a film together, regardless of date of issue or format (VHS, DVD or Blu-Ray).
This is especially unfortunate when the newest version is a dramatic improvement over the old versions.
This is the case with ""99 River Street""
The Kino Blu-Ray was released on June 21, 2016.
There were already forty reviews of the old MGM DVD-R posted on Amazon.
Most of them liked the movie, but had reservations about the print quality and lack of special features.

The new Blu-Ray has a beautifully restored HD picture.
The new Blu-Ray has trailers for the film, plus three other films noir.
The new Blu-Ray has a commentary track with film noir expert Eddie Mueller.

Very entertaining commentary track - an example of how it should be done.
Mueller points out a lot of things I never noticed before:
-- In a tour of 1953 New York City after dark, we are taken to the usual places:
1) An all-night saloon
2) An all-night drug store with soda fountain (whatever happened to soda fountains?)
3) An all-night boxing gym
4) An all-night pet store (huh?) where the villains hang out
5) An all-night cafe
-- The HD picture on Blu-Ray reveals a lot of things that went unnoticed on DVD:
1) The ship at the dock in the final scene is an obvious matte shot.
2) Villain Brad Dexter is actually wearing eye liner.

-- Brad Dexter was a wonderful screen villain in dozens of films in the '40s through the '70s.
As the commentary points out, despite being a handsome guy, he never made it as the hero (something weaselly about his smile)
Brad Dexter only played the good guy once in his career:
He was one of the Magnificent Seven (the one nobody remembers)

Great film noir: Imaginative script, camera work, lighting and directing.
My only complaint is the lack of subtitles
(the DVD didn't have them either)

GET THE BLU-RAY, NOT THE DVD.

PICTURE 1 = OLD DVD COVER
PICTURE 2 = NEW BLU-RAY COVER
PICTURE 3 = BRAD DEXTER",1467849600,21,1952,4.547008547008547

John Payne enjoyed success in many genres, Pirate films, film Noir, Westerns, drama's you name it he did it & did it well!!!  I don't think he was in any Sci-Fi or Horror but he does span many genre's!  He certainly isn't from a stable of Hollywood's second rate actor's as one film buff friend of mine put it... No he is a 1st rate actor.  It has been great fun for me discovering his huge bulk of work & seeing these great old films.  I think the first time I saw him was in "" Miracle on 34th street"", now I am playing catch up adding a lot of his films to my library.  99 River Street is up there in my top 10 John Payne movies & John Payne made so many great films that is a high quality top ten!!!  Just in the film Noir genre I can name three great films this one, Kansas city confidential & Hell's Island a unique in color film noir.",1467676800,6,964,3.9329896907216493
8434139,5,B004LB5FEA,"99 River Street, a film I had never heard of until it was released on blu-ray, is a gem of a film.  The plot turns are so inventive and preposterous I would call the film Screwball Noir. Although Fritz Lang's You and Me is much closer to being a screwball comedy noir.  The production values aren't as high as those of Out of the Past or The Maltese Falcon or low as those of Detour, and for that reason perhaps the film has remained relatively obscure.  Occasionally, it veers toward TV-like cinematographer, but it never crosses over from film.  There is only one moment in the film that seems campy, but otherwise the film plays it straight.  I did find myself laughing out of joy at the many surprises in the film.  Just when it seems to be getting a bit boring, bam, something brilliant happens.  The cinematographer does a  decent job, even if he is no John Alton.",1467590400,5,870,4.427672955974843
