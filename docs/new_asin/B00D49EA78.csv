8589450,5,B00D49EA78,"I first discovered British comedienne/singer/dancer Jessie Matthews when I watched  and favorably reviewed  the 1930s film First a Girl! (the film that inspired Blake Edwards film  and later Broadway hit Victor/Victoria). Matthews was a delight and I wanted to see more of her films. But a search showed that only one other film was available in the US and she made a bunch of them. What great news when I learned the independent DVD reissue label, VCI, was going to release EIGHT of her films this year! Ive reviewed them all here on Amazon and this one is one of the better ones in terms of entertainment and transfer.

While some of the JM films have only one or two songs in them, this one has SIX including a big production number, where Matthews signs and then performs and extended dance number in a nightclub. One song  Looking Around Corners For You is performed TWICE, once as an upbeat number and later in a much darker version. Same song; different moods. The songs were written my major tunesmiths Harry Revel and Mack Gordon and are really catchy.

Like many of these films the plot is really beside the point but this film seems more serious than the other JMs Ive watched. The 78 minute film seems to have the love relationship resolved way too quickly at the end  as though they were running out of budget. The film was made in 1937 in England and though the next year brought the saucy comedy of Sailing Along, the humor here is not as much fun. In fact there really isn't much to laugh about in this film.

The print (in 4:3 ratio) is one of the best of the Matthews releases so far. The sound is excellent   though not exactly hi-fi  and the print really sharp. VCI has added English subtitles (though the accents are not hard to understand and you shouldnt need them). The transfer was apparently made by ITV for broadcast on TV in the UK.

The only bonus here is a one-minute-plus Photo Gallery which plays to the films title song.

If you are not familiar with Matthews, a good place to start is Its Love Again (see my review on Amazon) Then move on to First a Girl!, Sailing Away and the others. I cant wait for VCI to release some more JM titles in 2014 (How about Evergreen, her biggest hit?).

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
