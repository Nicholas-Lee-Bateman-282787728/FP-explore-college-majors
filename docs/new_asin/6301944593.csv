387372,1,6301944593,"No way is this movie a 2013 release. The acting is poor at best and the dialog is even worse. A few social issue promos thrown in like ""Don't drink and drive"" and ""Don't smoke"" complete the circle of lessons being touted in this movie. If you like lectures on behavior, this movie is for you.",1392422400,,292,4.232142857142857
387373,1,6301944593,"Bad acting, script, plots etc.  The actors were the ""hotties"" of the day, long since sunk into the distant mire of old TV shows.  Includes 1980's grainy TV video quality too - no extra charge!",1392076800,,192,4.457142857142857
387374,1,6301944593,"It was very cliche', predictable, and outdated. It did not hold my interest and I turned if off after maybe 20 minutes.",1390867200,,119,4.454545454545454
387375,5,6301944593,"This is one of those movies put together with several known & soon to be known stars that never made it into the Pop Culture Era of it's time, as a hit........... However, it should have been a bigger success than it was, just one of those unfortunate events in life....

I think you are missing out on some good entertainment, good life lessons, some laughs & some disappointments.....  One of those very much understated, "" Left out in the cold "" movies that should have been in a better standing all these years.....

Despite the apparent "" Kid "" who more or less calls it a 1987 flick with bad actors, I beg to differ, immensely !!!

Don't miss this one if you are from that era..........

It has a lot of good music, longtime well known actors & soon to be well known actors in it that will give you a nice slower paced movie without all the special effects, crashes, killings & overpaid, egotistical actors flailing one another for the best character in the movie award............

More of a feel good movie with fun, romance, fantasy & some fairly good actors in it that will leave you with a smile on your face when it ends........

I for one, thoroughly enjoyed it as I am from that era but have never to my knowledge seen this movie until tonight & I wonder if I had watched it back then, would I have liked it then as I liked it now.......... BF II",1390348800,2,1360,4.309803921568627
387376,1,6301944593,"Disappointment.  Old flick from 1987 with the quality and format of that era, fairly poor acting, and not such a great plot, all spun as a 2013 release.  Not sure where that new cover came from.",1387238400,3,194,4.361111111111111

However even in the 80's that type of DJ was bad, yet typical at hotel bars.
I was glad to see Billy & the Beaters in this but I thought they only had 1 song.",1498003200,,226,3.3653846153846154

7817932,1,6301944593,I like some 80's films but this one is bad. B movie actors even for that time star in this movie. Don't waste your time.,1478563200,,120,3.84
