7955524,2,B00005UWAG,"The DVD Came in a SORRY Padded Envelope & inside the case one of the places where the DVD is supposed to be secure IS BROKEN,, Luckly the DVD isn't damaged..
So this is why I'm giving it two stars.. If the person would have just shook the case alittle bit they would have heard that it was broken inside from all the ratteling...

Product Description said nothing about being damaged.. All it sais was this....

7955525,5,B00005UWAG,"This is a great DVD for anyone who is interested in Elvis' years in the US Army, it covers nearly every step of his induction into the military to include fingerprinting!  I've seen dozens of this clips in other films, but this film puts them all together nice and neat.

  As a former member of the US Army I can relate.  It is not very expensive either and has some funny songs sung by people who immortalized his drafting into the Army in song, there is NO singing by Elvis in it but I thought is was very appropriate as is.

7955526,3,B00005UWAG,"The Missing years is basically a bunch of old army buddies talking about there experiences with Elvis. There is no Elvis music and the film footage that is used of Elvis is in not so great quality. The Elvis impersonator's singing is pathetic and sometimes annoying. The CD that comes with it contains Elvis interviews and Louisiana Hayrider material which has been released several times. Matter of fact it's the same cd that camein the 1993 book 'Private Presley', except with a picture disc. Basically if you're not a true Elvis fan. Avoid this release.",1020211200,16,556,4.863157894736842
7955527,3,B00005UWAG,"Hi folks, this dvd is only for diehard fan's like myself who wish to see anything with Elvis in it. It has some cool unseen footage in it, like Elvis being sworn into the army, getting onto the ship heading to Germany, home movies shot by Eddie Fadal during some of Elvis' visits. There is no Elvis music in the dvd, its a cheap impersonator which is a letdown. The audio disk is just another rehash of the early Elvis, Scotty, Bill live.  All in all, i'd skip this and wait for ""this is elvis"" to be released on dvd. Pretty cheesy stuff here. This is only for diehard fans.",1019952000,11,574,4.218181818181818
