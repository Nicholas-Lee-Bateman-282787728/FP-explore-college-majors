8058205,5,B00097FLFI,I love this DVD it shows his personality and I love the bloopers and extra footage.,1257984000,,83,4.25
8058206,3,B00097FLFI,"Thom's designs are always amazing. He never fails to impress. This DVD, however, is a mess. The organization of it makes it so you can't follow a single design from planning to execution... you have to see ALL of the projects at once! You see all of his impressions of the spaces, then see all the shopping trips, then see all the final reveals... you can't keep all the people and designs straight! And all of this chaos is accompanied by the nonstop Queer Eye techno. For an hour. Oof. I LOVE THOM!!! I just do NOT love this DVD!",1216166400,4,531,4.32
8058207,1,B00097FLFI,"First, I love Thom Filicia's work.  However I was under the impression, from the write-up, that this DVD would reveal a bit about how Thom Filicia approaches a room redesign and it revealed NOTHING more than I've seen on the show.  The mfr has misrepresented this DVD completely because there's NO additional information about Filicia's methodology so, if you've seen the show, you don't need the DVD (just watch Bravo reruns and you'll achieve the same effect).",1160870400,10,462,4.987012987012987
8058208,1,B00097FLFI,"This DVD set is a complete waste of money.  Furthermore, I am surprised that Mr. Filicia was willing to lend his name to the project.  The back of the case reads in part, ""In this fantastic personal guide, Thom gives you the keys to creating a delicious dcor in your own home.""  That description is totally incorrect.

The first disk consists entirely of short clips from previously aired shows.  The second disk consists of outtakes from previously aired shows where Mr. Filicia either flubs or someone says something in questionable taste.  Oh, and there is also a previously aired episode (the one with the scene carpenter guy who had long hair and wore overalls).

I *expected* a little added value-- maybe a voice over, or at least arrangement of the clips in such a way that the disks would actually teach something--before and after, perhaps?  But no.  Nothing but Thom Filicia saying ""It's horrible"" and so forth, again and again.  It would be useful to someone who finds the man amusing and/or attractive (not to say that he isn't those things), but does nothing at all to teach the slightest design principles.  Because the various clips seem to have been edited for humor value alone, the content is so cut up, one learns less than one would by actually watching the show.",1125878400,19,1283,4.7342342342342345
8058209,5,B00097FLFI,"Anyone who loves QE especially Thom well love this DVD....you get a better sense as to how funny Thom really is...his sense of design knows no bounds....if you like to laugh and get ideas on how to decorate this is the DVD to get. As another QE fan says run, don't walk to pick up The Bset of THOMS Home.",1125014400,,304,4.083333333333333
8058210,5,B00097FLFI,"Grab your credit card and your track shoes and run, don't walk, to buy this DVD! Thom is an expert in the decorating/design field and yet never talks over the heads of the viewers. While carefully considering the needs of the straight guys, Thom manages to not just clean up and improve the guy's surroundings, but he makes the entire experience an exercise in friendship. While you watch Thom transform the straight guys' spaces, you'll have to be careful not to spill your Margarita on your Pratesi sheets....you'll be laughing so hard! And, last but not least, Thom Filicia is very easy on the eyes...be still my heart....intelligent, sweet, sensitive, caring, a good listener.....what's not to love?!?!",1122940800,,706,5.042735042735043
