4331729,3,B004D8TXAI,It would b a great training DVD if the other guy would let Mike teach I understand he's excited about what he's learned but jes let Mike teach us how to play he's the professional. That's just my opinion,1446249600,2,203,4.230769230769231
4331730,3,B004D8TXAI,very good learning tool,1431129600,,23,5.0
4331731,2,B004D8TXAI,"I really expected alot more from these dvds. I have huge respect for Mike as a player & instructor. However, these dvds are not very organized and are very disorganized due to the constant interruptions from his co-host Kevin. I just kept wishing he would shut the hell up and let Mike do his thing. Don't waste your time or money!",1428796800,4,331,4.442622950819672
4331732,5,B004D8TXAI,Friend really enjoys this book,1407888000,,30,5.2
4331733,4,B004D8TXAI,"I'm a beginner and  have only watched the first dvd so far. The drills have helped me improve my stroke considerably. But that other guy in the video with Sigel makes it almost unwatchable. I'm not sure who he is,but he won't shut up  I would give it a lower rating,except for the fact that when Mike gets a chance to talk and demonstrate a drill without being interrupted, I have learned alot.",1391644800,3,394,4.383561643835616
4331734,1,B004D8TXAI,"Save your money. Sigel is without a doubt a fabulous player and may indeed be a good teacher, but you'll never find out from these DVD's; the set is embarassingly awful.

Sigel is paired/hosted with some guy who promotes a pool tour, and who babbles constantly about how great the DVD series is, and how much you'll learn. He simply NEVER shuts up. I kept waiting for him to disappear and Sigel to start teaching. But he's in every second of the video. I paid for Sigel; I got 30% Sigel, and 70% this other guy. After 5 minutes, I wanted to strangle him. After 15 minutes, I threw the DVD set in the trash. As soon as Sigel starts to talk, this guy interrupts with ""Wait! You mean, like this? But I've seen people do this, and this, and this..."" Sigel then has to stop and respond to the endless stream of inane, distracting remarks. Might not be bad if it happens once, but it happens every 60 seconds. Apparently, they decided they didn't need an outline or a script. They were wrong.

There's a lot better instructional material available on YouTube.",1384560000,10,1053,4.450777202072539
4331735,4,B004D8TXAI,"It's very basic. If you've been playing for a little while, or have watched/read anything on pool, you know 95% of what he goes through. VERY REPETITIVE, but nonetheless, great for beginners.",1373241600,,191,5.0
4331736,5,B004D8TXAI,"Best pool instructional  DVD I've seen period!  Hey,I  just said its the best DVD I've seen . What more can I say.",1359936000,,114,4.090909090909091
4331737,3,B004D8TXAI,bits of good info few and far between. Some info wrong. Very little on spin or english. Could have covered content in one dvd.,1344211200,2,126,4.291666666666667

8425012,5,B004D8TXAI,Great dvd I wish Mike Sigel would make the same 3 pool dvd instructional set leaving the other guy out of the production then it would be a fantastic instructional dvd set Mike really knows his stuff.,1509408000,,200,4.4324324324324325
8425013,2,B004D8TXAI,"could be a great instructional aid but is just unwatchable due to the CONSTANT interruptions from the ( co-host ?) other guy on the video.

8425014,4,B004D8TXAI,This was well done and easy to follow I also enjoy having the cards that come with the set as I can bring them to the pool hall to work on the practice techniques.,1497571200,,163,3.823529411764706
8425015,1,B004D8TXAI,Kevin Trudeau distracts from the DVD -- amazon shouldn't do anything the supports Kevin.  Kevin should be treated as an untouchable.,1486252800,,132,5.285714285714286

8425017,2,B004D8TXAI,"Totally ruined by co-host Kevin. Like the other reviews said.. he never shuts up. Without him, Mike Sigel could the whole thing and better on one DVD",1462665600,,149,4.555555555555555
