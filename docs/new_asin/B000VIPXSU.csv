8218888,3,B000VIPXSU,It is very basic.  I have done Pilates workouts at a studio and was looking for smt I can do at home with my 10yrs old.  Perhaps my expectations were too high.  But it just doesn't seem challenging enough.,1357257600,,205,4.205128205128205
8218889,4,B000VIPXSU,"This DVD is pretty good. The music and encouraging main guy is awesome. I actually have a lot of time to do this video, so I think it's a little short. But it's a great workout for the abs, and even I can feel it afterward, even though I did the modified version of everything! This is great for people that are VERY busy with sports and such, and I would reccamend this to any busy, active teen who needs some DVD like this. Remember: have good balance and form with these moves to get the whole benefit!",1232582400,2,505,4.163265306122449
