These accusations are fairly accurate, but the bad thing about this film is that it doesn't make any arguments, or provide any evidence, to counter these stereotypes,

If you don't think Arabs are some of the most violent people in the world, Google ""worst terrorist attacks.""

If you don't think Arabs are lecherous, Google ""child brides,"" ""modern slavery,"" or ""arab rape.""

If you don't think Arabs are stupid and lazy, Google ""imam calls arabs lazy,"" or ""airbus crash toulouse.""

Or do like I did, and live in predominantly Moslem countries such as Iraq, Afghanistan, and Saudi Arabia for more than a year.",1468540800,,718,5.0508474576271185

The action of few extremist(who are denounced by Arabs themselves) does only add and serve the individuals who want to spread the hatred message between nations. I recommend this to all people and it is important to mention that the Shaheen's brothers are not Muslims.,1212883200,10,356,5.033898305084746
