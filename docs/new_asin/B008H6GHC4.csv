8528001,3,B008H6GHC4,My 2 year old son wasn't really into it. He loves the movie cars so I thought he would like this to but he didn't. It was a cute movie though. My 4 year old nephew watched it at my house and loved it so I let him take it home with him.,1403136000,,235,3.452830188679245
8528002,5,B008H6GHC4,"This movie has it all.....These movies help kids understand Bible verses.  We were looking for movies with good messages so I didn't feel so guilty about them watching them.  I even let them watch it on the way to church.  They are much better than the Veggietale movies.  I highly recommend these movies.  They have a story, a Bible verse, and a recap of how the verse fits in the story.  I love them, even more important so does my son!!",1400716800,,439,4.3580246913580245
8528003,5,B008H6GHC4,"My son loved this show before they added the Christian lessons to it, we love it even more now! I got this to add to his Easter basket and he will be thrilled. Monster trucks AND a Christian lesson, can't get any better!",1396396800,,220,4.1395348837209305
8528004,4,B008H6GHC4,"was concerned they would get all ""religious"" throughout the cartoon, but it wasn't like that at all.  a cute bunch of shorts with nice characters that drive and zip around, followed by a religious message afterwards, which can easily be skipped.  good for kids in the 3 to 5 range (mine are 2 and 4).",1369526400,,300,4.4363636363636365
8528005,3,B008H6GHC4,This wasbought thinking it was a completely different movie. This is an animated version and for small kids. If kids were smaller would have been great,1366502400,,151,4.846153846153846
