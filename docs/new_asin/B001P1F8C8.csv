8331853,5,B001P1F8C8,Wife loved this gift that was a throwback to her childhood. She lost her copies in the move after her divorce (or he kept them) but either way she was thrilled. DVD came packaged securely and all played without a problem.,1520812800,,221,4.414634146341464
8331854,5,B001P1F8C8,"This package includes the Mexican Santa-vs.-Satan classic, ""Santa Claus,"" and the bonkers ""Santa Conquers the Martians,"" starring tiny Pia Zadora, on one disc, plus some other garbage. That is all.",1500854400,,197,5.6
8331855,5,B001P1F8C8,"I LOVE this DVD, because it has the cheesy Santa classics from the late 50s and early 60s. I remember seeing ""Santa Claus"" back on Christmas Eve, 1959. It was one of the best movies for a child; very colorful, and featuring children and songs from all over the world. ""Santa Claus Conquers the Martians"" is just plain cheesy fun, but I really enjoyed this film even now. The costumes look cheap, as if they were made from Goodwill rejects, but it's entertaining nonetheless. If you really want a fun take on this film, check out Elvira's ""Movie Macabre"" which features this film plus Elvira's comments. Priceless.
For all the movies you get on this DVD, it's a real bargain and a fun DVD to watch every Christmas.",1327449600,,713,4.578125
