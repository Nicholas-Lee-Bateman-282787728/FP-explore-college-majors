It is so bad that any wanna-be filmmaker will either get an A+ after watching this or change careers immediately! I'd give away the ending, but I don't remember if there was one!

1638850,1,B00005O078,"Boy, do I feel ripped off.
Even my boyfriend complained within 30 seconds - did they really bother to put a movie like this on DVD?  It was obviously filmed on Video, apparently using ambient lighting, using the on-camera microphone (which makes the sounds very muffled).  The acting, direction & camerawork is the most amateurish I have ever seen, but when you put it the context of a home video, then it all fits into place.  At least the microphone didn't slip into the picture, but that would be very difficult to do, given the microphone must have been the camera's in-built mike.  The storyline is incredibly weak (OK, so there's no happy ending, either - just loose ends, out of character with the rest of the movie).  The background music is incessant & mostly inappropriate & poorly chosen (I found it annoying after a bit).  I love gay movies, but this DVD is an insult - both the movie itself & the DVD presentation.  The DVD has probably had more money spent on the interactive menu, than the whole film's budget - it it very pretty, although only one option (play).  There are no chapter stops (which is a problem for my Sharp DVD player as its fastest fast-forward is 3x or 4x - not good if you want to stop the film & come back to it later).  The movie lasts just 1hr 1min (plus credits).
If you are prepared to pay that much money for a home video quality production, that you have trouble hearing & appears to have an uninteresting story, then OK.  I buy almost all gay-themed DVD's that are released, but this is the worst by far.  Sad. P>...Unfortunately Amazon won't allow me to give this DVD less than 1 star rating...",1014681600,31,1639,4.466442953020135

All in all, a bit too contrived for me, and I looked up an hour in and thought, ""isn't this over yet."" It's getting 3 stars because Edward Fasulo's character, Joey, has a chance to cheat on Bruce but decides not to.

This movie sets a new standard for bad gay movies.  The audio reminds me of the ""Dueling Cavalier"" scene in  ""Singin' in the Rain"", with weirdly loud noises such as footsteps but sometimes inaudible dialog (maybe that's a plus).  Practically every character is a stereotype ... why does every independent gay movie set in NYC have a flaming drag queen as a neighbor?  A well-dressed gay investment banker would be a nice change of pace.  One of the main characters is supposedly an adult, but is such a sniveling coward that I was rooting for his BF to leave him in the first 15 minutes and end the terrible movie.  Both the BF and the audience would have been better off.

(when his parents come to visit) and keeping the truth from them.  This plot has only been done, oh, I don't know,
a hundred times before (and done better) and it's outcome is more than predictable.

1639166,3,B00005O078,"well, um. this is pretty amateurish and it often felt like i was watching a entry in a amateur home video contest.
  the sound in this film is irritating and often inaudible. the buzzing and static noises are not from the Dvd transfer but are actually technical problems in the production itself. the dialogue all sounds like it was recorded with a bad microphone. the sets look like they were filmed in someone's living room which is really supposed to be a New York apartment. a nightclub scene with a weird drag queen is also equally unconvincing.
  the acting is amateurish but acceptable when you can understand what they're saying through the bad audio. the story and premise are not bad however and i guess from the review by one viewer, it came from a stage play.
  it's hard to make a movie unless you're rich. that's not very democratic. i have to credit the fimmakers for getting their project done and getting thier movie on Netflix and Instant Video. i think a lot of people will feel the ultra low budget to be a gyp. personally i feel people should give more movies (or video, whichever) like this a chance.
  it's a good effort. and even though i found it watchable enough, that's all it felt like, a effort at making a movie.",1355875200,2,1242,4.513392857142857
1639167,1,B00005O078,"I admire when low-budget independent film makers put out their own product.
The script and story premise was okay.

My major hang-up is these two men are in a relationship. The major plot is that one whose parents are dropping in, who are anti-gay ministers.  And for some reason, he never got around to telling his BF this (some relationship if this never comes up).  The other goes home with another guy and cheats on him because he feels cheated, but this plot point never comes out.

But I agree, this is low budget as it gets.  If the cover art was done in the same tone of the production it would be stick figures in crayon.  It seems like they spent all their money on the cover art and none on the production.
They obviously spent no money of the sound -it is a struggle to hear the dialogue.  So to counter that they play background music that drowns out the dialogue.
They editing and filming -a child on you tube has better production values.

I want to applaud the production for their effort, but this movie is not the best, and at best it is a testimony to how to not make a movie.
Just to get through the end of the movie, I started the Fast forward through, because the sound was distracting.
If you have to fast forward to get through a 70 minute movie, that is bad.",1355529600,2,1283,4.2727272727272725

And boy, could it use closed captioning!  The sound quality is so poor that half the dialogue is inaudible; the writing is so bad that you wish the rest of it were also.

The acting is completely amateur, and there is not a single laugh or a plausible line in the whole script.  The film is shot on videotape (like a porno film) and doesn't look very good at all.  Oh, and the box somehow failed to mention that the whole thing runs barely 65 minutes - what a gyp!  It wouldn't have been worth a budget pricing of less than ten dollars; at the price I paid, this film was a total rip-off!  Please save your money!  If you want a fun gay Christmas movie, go for 24 Nights instead.

This film was the second-worst gay film I've ever seen, following closely on the heels of Ben & Arthur (another dismal offering from the distributors, Culture Q Connection).  Both films are serious contenders for the title of worst movie ever made.
