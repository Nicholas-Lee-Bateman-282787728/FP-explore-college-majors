1222066,5,B00000IC8A,"The Hitchcock set is going to be loaded with 14 great film treasures that have been cleaned up for blu-ray. It is also going to be expensive in the U.S. at $225, but the same set (as well as a better one) can be had from Amazon U.K. for far cheaper. I bought the deluxe limited version of the the set (which is region free and will play in U.S. players) for 86.41 which equals $137.26 I was given a promotional discount at checkout from the original asking price of 100.00 to get to that price. I also separately ordered the deluxe coffin version of the Universal Monsters set, which after discount is 39.75 which comes out to $63.14 including shipping. So, using Amazon U.K., I was able to get deluxe versions of BOTH box sets for a total of $200, $25 less than most in the U.S. are paying for the regular version of just the Hitchcock set. Buying from Amazon U.K. is simple since you can use your U.S. Amazon login, and it's easy to tell which titles are region free (can play in all blu-ray players regardless of country)since those titles are clearly marked as being ""[Region Free]"". So, head over to Amazon U.K. and save some money to get the same thing, or something even better, for less money!",1346716800,294,1201,4.390134529147982
1222067,1,B00000IC8A,"Thanks to a previous review, I did checkout The Hitchcock collection on the amazon.com.uk website. It was one hundred pounds, which translates to about seventy dollars less than the American version. The box that it comes in is way cooler than the psychedelic cover of the American version. It may come out a week later than the American version and take a week longer to get here, but the additional cash will help pay for the Bond collection.",1346112000,103,444,4.705128205128205

1222069,3,B00000IC8A,"This collection is somewhat disappointing.  Already owning North by Northwest and Psycho on Blu-Ray made me wonder if this Collection was worth buying and selling the two duplicates.  I'm passing on this Collection and will buy the ones I want separately.  The reason for my downgrade of this Collection is the inclusion of the two lesser films, Frenzy and Family Plot.  Strangers on a Train, Spellbound, Notorious, Suspicion, Lifeboat, The 39 Steps, etc.  These are great Hitchcock films and to exclude them is ridiculous.",1341187200,6,523,5.178571428571429
1222070,5,B00000IC8A,"Hitchcock is my favorite director of all-time and as soon as I discovered this set was up for pre-order I jumped straight away to order it.  I did check Amazon's UK site and I must say I really like the look of the UK version much better.  The UK version doesn't have NORTH BY NORTHWEST included but, for me, that doesn't matter as I already have NBNW on blu-ray digibook.  So I ordered the UK version as well.  Usually Universal (like Warner) releases their blu-rays to play in all regions - hopefully that will be true with this release.  If not, I luckily have a region-free player. When the street date nears I will make my decision as to which set I will purchase and cancel the other one.  As of right now, I'm leaning more on the UK release.",1341014400,6,748,4.307142857142857
1222071,5,B00000IC8A,"Not all of the greats, but a lot.  This plus a few additional will get you most all of Hitchcock's movies.  Great packaging, much better then the bloated UK packaging that won't fit with your other Blu-Ray's.",1340841600,2,208,4.594594594594595

1222074,3,B00000IC8A,"In film school I was torn between which version of exciting story is better. It may just be this one, with Hitchcock in fine form weaving dry British humor into a story of heart-pounding suspense; young girl is  kidnapped to prevent her parents from revealing what they've learned about  assassination plot.  The film opens as Bob and Jill Lawrence are on a  winter sports holiday with their teenage daughter Betty. When their friend  Louis Bernard is shot whilst dancing with Jill, he tells Bob of an  assassination about to take place in London. Fearing that their plot will  be revealed, the assassins kidnap Betty in order to keep the Lawrence's  quiet. Bob and Jill return to London and take matters into their own hands.  Jill and Bob Lawrence are on a winter holiday with their daughter, Betty.  While he is dancing with Jill, the secret agent Louis Bernard is shot to  death. With his last words he tells Jill about an assassination planned by  some terrorists, about to take place in London. Fearing their plan would be  revealed, the spies kidnap Betty and carry her off to London with them. Bob  and Jill come back to London too, searching for their daughter.  Still an  intact suspense plot by today's standards, the film exceeded the standards  set by Hitchcock's Golden age work in an era when the cinematic suspense  lexicon was still maturing.  Performances are gritty and wholesome, when  easily identifiable transplanted Americans are caught in a game of Cat and  Mouse.  Equally so, Sabotage is a key film in dark suspense.  Not to be  confused with Saboteur, a much more successful film, this is possibly one  of Hitch's biggest downers.  The film was a critical and financial failure  in light of his previous works.  In wartime Europe, Mr. Verloc, a cinema  owner, is part of a gang of saboteurs in London. He lives with his wife,  Sylvya, and her young brother, Stevie. They know nothing about Verloc's  secret. Scotland Yard assigns an undercover detective, Ted, to work in a  shop near the cinema and investigate the man. The head of the gang assigns  Verloc to put a bomb in the metro. The man sends Stevie there with the  ""bag"".  Originall retitled A Woman Alone, in the US, the film is  intricately dressed, with amazing sets built in exactitude for remarkable  payoff with Hitch's classic shots.  Look for a high drama tense scene when  a potential murder takes place just after a quiet dinner for two.  Though  not much of a bonus package, this 2 DVD set has a much better look than  your typical screener copy transfer double feature on a single dual layered  DVD.",961632000,3,2595,4.737078651685393
1222075,1,B00000IC8A,This is aimed at the dvd release of this set only. Very very very poor choice for packaging on behalf of the manufacturer. The discs are housed in cardboard sleeves.

1222101,5,B00000IC8A,"After much indecisiveness, I finally bought this excellent Blu-ray collection when it dropped to a low of $39.95. I hesitated because this package is listed here on Amazon at all sorts of prices, depending (apparently) on whether it includes 14 or 15 films. The one I got has 14 and it is the ""Region Free"" version, which means it will play on any Blu-ray player in the known universe as of 2017. It includes Saboteur (1942) Shadow of a Doubt (1943) Rope (1948) Rear Window (1954) The Trouble with Harry (1955) The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956) Vertigo (1958) Psycho (1960) The Birds (1963) Marnie (1964) Torn Curtain (1966) Topaz (1969) Frenzy (1972) Family Plot (1976). North By Northwest is not included in this version, but the other versions go for $70-$80, so who cares? It also doesn't include dozens of other Hitchcock films, some of which I bought at the same time in a 6 DVD collection called ""Ultimate Hitchcock Collection"" (contents are older, B&W, classics: The Lodger (1927) * The Ring (1927) * Easy Virtue (1927) * The Farmer's Wife (1928) * Champagne (1928) * Blackmail (1929) * The Manxman (1929) * Juno and the Paycock (1930) * The Skin Game (1931) * Rich and Strange (1932) * Number 17 (1932) * The Man Who Knew Too Much (1934) * The 39 Steps (1935) * Secret Agent (1936) * Sabotage (1936) * Young and Innocent (1937) * The Lady Vanishes (1938) * Jamaica Inn (1939)) And that STILL doesn't get you all of Hitch's films. No big. I'll settle for now and catch up later. I sat down to The Man Who Knew Too Much (2nd version) and Vertigo last night, both beautifully restored, and I knew I'd made the right decision.",1501027200,3,1630,4.5288135593220336

There is no doubt that this is a good buy from Amazon ($68.99 at the time of ordering June 25 2017).

If your machine plays Blu-rays it should play these and at this price...they're a steal! $49.95 (1-20-17)

Whether you are a veteran home video connoisseur or casual viewer of Hitchcock movies, long-time collector or first-time purchaser, already have a Hitchcock collection on standard definition DVD or even older formats and are looking to upgrade to high definition Blu-ray, or you're starting your Hitchcock collection and want to begin with the best available disc technology, this is an excellent set  in my opinion the best currently available  and because it's now into its fifth year on the market, you have an opportunity to purchase Hitchcock on Blu-ray, as of this writing, for $3.57 per movie vs. a list price of more than $16 each when they were introduced in Oct, 2012, not to mention countless hours of fascinating and informative special features, which includes nearly all of the original material released when the standard DVDs were introduced years ago. As I see it, your timing could not be better  5 Stars!

OVERVIEW OF THIS AMAZON CUSTOMER REVIEW  HOW IT'S DIFFERENT:
In an effort to add value for readers of this review, written more than four years after this set was introduced, I have read and mined all 195 Amazon customer reviews posted to date and will summarize the highlights and some of the pertinent information I have gleaned from them. I undertook this effort to inform my own purchase decision and will share the results with my fellow Amazon shoppers/home video lovers. When appropriate, I will add my own thoughts and comments, along with analysis of the data mined from nearly 200 Amazon customer reviews.

Although this review is admittedly very long, it potentially could be a one stop review, providing you with the data you need to make a wise buying decision while saving you time in the long run. In the event you feel you need additional information, I have identified seven additional reviews, out of the 195 posted (as of 1-20-17), that may contain what you are seeking. They are placed at the end of this review in chronological order as a post script.

If you feel I overlooked something or you think something is inaccurate, or have any other suggestions, please leave a comment. I intend to revisit this review periodically and if necessary, I will edit this review and/or incorporate your suggestions into my future reviews on home video media and other Amazon products. Thanks in advance.

If this review (and analysis) provides you with something of value, perhaps you would be kind enough to award me a 'YES' for my effort. It costs you nothing yet will mean a great deal to me. Thanks!   STICKS-OF-TNT

U.S. VS. UK VERSION:
Okay, now let's get down to the nitty gritty and take a look at the details that led me to my conclusions and 5-Star rating. To begin, we need to examine the matter of the two geographical versions of this set, the source of considerable customer confusion. Amazon carries two geographical versions of this set, commonly referred to by reviewers here as the 'U.S.' and 'UK' versions. The UK set is substantially less expensive than the U.S. set. The U.S. set will only play on U.S. and Canadian players, which are known as Region A/1 players. The UK discs are multi-regional, sometimes referred to here on Amazon as 'REGION FREE' or 'ALL REGIONS' and should play on ALL Blu-ray players. I have two Blu-ray players, an inexpensive Samsung purchased from Sam's Club and a more expensive Panasonic model purchased from Amazon, each acquired in the last few years. Although I assume they are U.S. (Region A/1) models, I'm not certain and since I have never purchased anything but U.S. Blu-rays in the past, I was a little apprehensive that the UK set might not work in my players. I'm happy to report my new 'UK' Blu-rays worked fine in both of my players. Perhaps in the future instead of referring to them as the 'UK set' we should use the less confusing 'multi-regional' or even better, 'all regions' set since they apparently will work in ALL Blu-ray players (NOTE: Some reviewers have advised it may be necessary to update the Blu-ray player's firmware if there is an operability issue. I suspect this would rarely be an issue unless the player is a very old model.)

Now for the differences in the two sets. The U.S. (Region A/1) edition has 15 films, including 'North by Northwest'. The UK/All Regions edition has 14 films and does NOT include 'North by Northwest'. The quality of the films is identical  they're the same discs. The difference (other than the UK set being MUCH cheaper) is different packaging and the fact that 'North by Northwest' isn't included. The U.S. version has a 58-page soft cover booklet with movie posters, production drawings and other information about each movie, which was not part of my more basic UK set. As of this writing (1-20-17), the UK set is $49.95, or $3.57 per movie for 14 movies, and the U.S. set is $88.88, or $5.93 per movie for 15 movies, an additional $2.36 per movie for the U.S. set! Now, quite frankly, either amount is a great value as compared to the original list prices of the sets when they were first released in 2012, but still, a savings of almost $39 by purchasing the UK/All Regions set is not insignificant. Here's what you might do with those savings:

Instead of purchasing this Region A/1 (U.S.) set:
- ""Alfred Hitchcock: The Masterpiece Collection"" - 15 Movies (U.S.) [Blu-ray]$88.88 (1-20-17)

Buy the following items together (18 Movies)  Total price $84.00 (1-20-17):
- ""Alfred Hitchcock: The Masterpiece Collection"" - 14 Movies (UK/All Regions)[Blu-ray]$49.95
- ""Alfred Hitchcock Collection"":
 'Dial M for Murder' / 'North by Northwest' / 'Strangers on a Train'[Blu-ray]$22.91
- 'To Catch a Thief' [Blu-ray]$11.14

NET RESULT:
For $84.00 you obtain the one movie not included in the UK/All Regions set, 'North by Northwest', PLUS THREE ADDITIONAL BLU-RAYS OF HITCHCOCK'S VERY BEST MOVIES  'Dial M for Murder', 'Strangers on a Train' and 'To Catch a Thief'  A TOTAL OF 18 BLU-RAY MOVIES and you're still paying $4.88 less than the U.S. set cost!

PRODUCT PACKAGE:
Keep in mind the UK/All Regions set is really bare bones in terms of packaging. You get 14 Blu-ray movies on individual discs, in order of year of release, in a book-like case in which each 'page' is a cardboard sleeve holding a single disc. Each movie is presented in an attractive two-page, multi-color spread featuring poster art, promotional type photos and quotes related to each movie and a list of special features included on that movie's disc. The disc for each movie is held on the right side with that 'page' being a sleeve for that movie and, after the page is turned, the reverse of the sleeve being the left side of the two-page spread for the next movie. The entire book, when closed, slips into an attractive cardboard slip case, which combined, make for a very sturdy package with the appearance and size of a hardback book, which should take up a minimal amount of shelf space and approximate the dimensions of other 'standard size' multi-DVD/Blu-ray sets you may own. Numerous Amazon reviewers have complained about the cardboard sleeves, concerned about them scratching their discs. My research indicates that Blu-ray discs in particular benefit from substantial scratch-resistant coating which, when handled with reasonable care, should prevent scratching. As indicated previously, this set is housed in a compact package which, while still quite artistic and attractive, does minimize shelf space. Generally, I prefer this somewhat minimalist approach to more elaborate, sometimes unwieldy cases, potentially at a much higher set price. Unfortunately, with the cardboard sleeves used in the design of the Hitchcock set, the only way to get the discs out is by grasping the edge with thumb and forefinger, which invariably is going to leave a smudge requiring immediate cleaning. Furthermore, if any foreign particles make their way to the inside of the sleeves, there is a risk of scratching during the extraction of the disc from its sleeve. An additional hazard is the possibility of discs sliding out of loose sleeves.  Personally, I would have preferred a design like my '(The) Ultimate James Bond Collection' [Blu-ray + Digital HD],which had 25 slots (23 movies + place holder for then unreleased SPECTRE + a bonus features disc), each disc on its own plastic tray, housed in three disc portfolio cases (standard DVD movie type, just a bit thicker to hold multiple Blu-rays), all three then sliding inside a cardboard slip case with cover. That entire package, with 11 more discs, is even more compact than the Hitchcock collection, just not as 'artistic'.

I guess in this particular case, most of us prefer 'function over form'. I'm just not willing to knock off a star for such a great collection available to us now at such an incredible price. Remember, $3.57 per Blu-ray disc containing a classic Hitchcock movie in high definition, loaded with special features. Focus on that. If you really think otherwise, plastic jewel cases to store your discs individually are very inexpensive. At the price I paid, they could have been housed in white paper CD envelopes and it still would have been a good deal.

HITCHCOCK'S DIRECTORIAL CAREER & FILMS AT UNIVERSAL PICTURES:
The movies in ""Alfred Hitchcock: The Masterpiece Collection"" are those currently owned by Universal Pictures. The set was released in 2012 as part of the studio's '100 Year Centennial Anniversary Celebration', which is highlighted in a short promotional video at start-up on each disc. (It gets old after you've seen it a few times, but like the FBI warning and other start-up boilerplate, you can't fast forward past it.) The fourteen films in the collection (listed above), spanning the period from 'Saboteur' released in 1942 through 'Family Plot' released in 1976, are the films Hitchcock directed for Universal, or for Paramount, which in 1958 sold much of their film library to Universal in an effort to raise capital when they were struggling financially. In an unexpected move after the success of Hitchcock's previous film, 'North by Northwest', 'Psycho', released in 1960, was a low budget black and white film, which was produced by Hitchcock's own production company and filmed at Universal Studios after Paramount resisted the concept. After that, from 'The Birds' through 'Family Plot', his last six movies, Hitchcock worked exclusively for Universal Pictures.

Hitchcock made fifty-two commercial movies over a career of nearly the same number of years, from his directorial debut in 1925 during the silent film era, his first sound movie in 1929, through his final movie, 'Family Plot' in 1976. An aspect of the UK/All Regions set worth noting is that of the fourteen movies, the set includes eight of the last nine films of Hitchcock's career, covering his last twenty years as a director, 1957 to 1976, the sole exception being 1959's 'North by Northwest', the one film NOT included in the UK/All Regions version of the set. The fifteenth film in the U.S. set, 'North by Northwest' (1959), is owned by Warner Bros., which I suspect Universal licensed it from in an effort to boost the selling price of the U.S. set. Fortunately, I recently obtained that film as part of the ""Best of Warner Bros. 50 Film Collection90th Anniversary Limited-Edition Blu-Ray + Ultraviolet"" (digital HD downloads) I purchased as an Amazon 'Deal of the Day' on Dec 19, 2016 for $70. That exceptional pre-Christmas deal, with an original list price of $598, might be the single best buy I've ever made on Amazon during my 20+ years as a customer, working out to an incredible $1.40 per Blu-ray disc for some of the finest motion pictures ever made. When combined with a ton of special features content, it may take me years to work my way through that entire collection. I have already watched the only Hitchcock film in my new Warner Bros. collection, 'North by Northwest', which has been restored to absolutely pristine condition. When all factors are taken into account, I consider 'NxNW' to be the quintessential Hitchcock film, especially for his non-horror movies. If not #1, every fan must surely have it on their 'Top 10' list of Hitchcock favorites. So if you buy the UK/All Regions 'Hitchcock Masterpiece Collection', as I am heartily recommending in this review, and you don't already own 'NxNW' on Blu-ray, be sure and add it to your wish list of future Hitchcock video purchases.

SPECIAL FEATURES:
Due to its length, the list of special features on each disc in the collection was moved to the very bottom (below the post scripts). The list of special features was not provided on the Amazon product page for the UK/All Regions set or in any customer review as of 1-20-17.

AMAZON REVIEWERS' MOVIE WISH LIST:
Many Amazon reviewers, perhaps not realizing this was an exclusively Universal set, bemoaned the failure of the set to include some of their personal favorites. I compiled a list of other Hitchcock films mentioned by Amazon reviewers:

1) 'The 39 Steps' (1935)
2) 'The Lady Vanishes' (1938)
3) 'Rebecca' (1940)
4) 'Foreign Correspondent' (1940)
5) 'Lifeboat' (1944)
6) 'Spellbound' (1945)
7) 'Notorious' (1946)
8) 'Stage Fright' (1950)
9) 'Strangers on a Train' (1951)
10) 'Dial M for Murder' (1954)
11) 'To Catch a Thief' (1955)
12) 'The Wrong Man' (1956)

,  Indicate first or second release in year with two films released.

Although I have long been a fan of Hitchcock films, going back to my boyhood, Universal's 'Masterpiece Collection' was my first purchase of his movies on home video. Since I'm a value shopper (i.e., 'cheap') I consider it my good fortune to have begun my search at a time when this Hitchcock set was so attractively priced. However, these movies will probably only whet my appetite for more from this brilliant director. It is unlikely I will be able to match this price on future Hitchcock film acquisitions, particularly without duplication of films I already own. Regardless, the above list of Amazon customer favorites will be the focus of my future efforts. It's worth noting that none of the above titles were from Hitchcock's first ten years as a director, 1925 through 1934. Obviously, the first half of those years was Hitchcock's silent movie era, which probably has limited consumer appeal. Several factors may account for lesser interest in the second half, 1929 to 1934. My guess is they might include the more primitive nature of sound films made during that period, Hitchcock still developing his skills as a commercially viable movie director, deterioration of film prints from those years, insufficient consumer interest to make the cost of print restoration of films from that period practical, technical limitations preventing upgrade of film from that era to high definition, or perhaps it's as simple as Hitchcock films from those years just not being available to the public for purchase. By the way, if you want to view the movies Hitchcock directed from the silent era in the 1920s, and his early work in the 30s, they're in the public domain and available free online. Just don't expect the level of sound and video quality you've come to enjoy in restored movies like this Universal's 'Masterpiece Collection'. It costs big bucks to accomplish that.

Assuming sometime in the future all fifty-two of Hitchcock's films are restored to the highest possible quality and eventually some company is able to overcome the legal obstacles and assemble the rights to market his entire catalog as a single set, it's still doubtful such a dream collection of the master filmmaker's lifetime body of work would be available at a price I would be willing to pay. So as a practical matter, my collection of fifteen Hitchcock films on Blu-ray is not a bad start. If I now focus on the dozen films above recommended by other Amazon reviewers, perhaps someday I'll own at least half of the Hitchcock library at a much more reasonable final cost. The result though is that the half I own, with perhaps a few exceptions, will essentially be 'his best' half, the half worth repeated viewing in the years ahead. As a value shopper on a limited budget, I would be more than happy with that outcome.

TESTIMONIALS  NOW CAN I GET AN AMEN?:
If you are at all reluctant about acquiring this Hitchcock boxed set, consider the following comments from the reviews of this collection (with light editing for readability) by customers who likely paid a lot more than you will:

""I own literally hundreds of Blu-rays and this is without a doubt my favorite set to date.""

""This collection is amazing and is by far my favorite to own  it's a must have!""

""I cannot rave enough about the fabulousness of this set and hope Universal releases a second volume of Hitchcock.""

""If you like Hitchcock this set is everything you'd hope it would be.""

""I love this collection and could not be happier.""

""Fantastic box set! Work of art! Quite possibly my favorite Blu-ray box set of all time.""

""Vertigo' is getting rave reviews for the restored image on this Blu-ray. Both Blu-ray.com and Hi-Def Digest.com gave it 4 stars for video and 4.5 for audio. I was knocked out when I saw it  dazzling colors and a crisp clear image. The original mono track has been presented in an all-new 5.1 channel lossless master audio track. Plus there's a lossless 2-channel mono option.""

""I love it! It's the best thing the light of day has ever seen  there is just no other way to describe it!""

""This Blu-ray collection is awesome! It was a great price and shipped quickly. I love the artwork, the layout, and of course, the movies. I would recommend this to any Hitchcock fan!""

""The new transfers - especially a gorgeous new one of 'The Trouble With Harry' - will make you see these movies in a new light. The beautiful New England fall foliage captured in 'Harry' was a revelation, with the movie looking like it could have been shot this year.""

""If you love movies and everything that goes into them then this collection will keep you mesmerized. Watch the angles, the background, the intensity of every detail. Hitchcock was a genius and this collection makes it fun and scary and all the good things movies can offer!""

""Watch them in chronological order to see how his style progresses.""

""Incredible to have all of these great movies on Blu-ray and in one collection. If you like Hitchcock movies and want to collect them, THIS is the collection you first want to buy.""

""Best Hitchcock collection going as of 2014.""

""For either an introduction to Hitchcock or as part of a completist's collection, this box set is a must-own.""

""The packaging is beautiful. The movie posters next to each film make it easy to locate each one.""

CONCLUSION:
If you've gotten this far, you certainly are interested in the film work of the man many consider THE master director, Sir Alfred Hitchcock. If that is the case, I encourage you to buy this boxed set, just as I did. I have already had many hours of enjoyment watching both the movies and special features and expect to have many more in the months and years ahead.

Yes, it may have some flaws which, if you were making this purchase when it was introduced in Oct, 2012, at a price of $225 ($16/movie), or later, couldn't manage to catch it as a 'Deal of the Day' or another sale and Amazon's regular price was still north of $140 ($10/movie), those flaws might have made you hesitate. I can't forget the customer in March, 2016 who bought it (the higher priced U.S. version, I guess) and confessed to us, ""Wish I would've gotten it cheaper  $165 seems high. Oh well, I wanted it!"" But now it's well below that 'point of hesitation' price. As I stated at the top of this review, ""If you just want the bottom line of my review  this is it  Buy the UK/All Regions boxed set. If your machine plays Blu-rays it should play these and at this price...they're a steal!"" $49.95 ($3.57/movie) (1-20-17)

Although this review is admittedly very long, it potentially could be a one stop review, providing you with the data you need to make a wise buying decision while saving you time in the long run. In the event you feel you need additional information, I have identified seven additional reviews, out of the 195 posted (as of 1-20-17), that may contain what you are seeking. They are placed at the end of this review in chronological order as a post script.

If this review (and analysis) provides you with something of value, perhaps you would be kind enough to award me a 'YES' for my effort. It costs you nothing yet will mean a great deal to me. Thanks!

1222144,5,B00000IC8A,"Here are my reviews of the films. Where I thought the extras were particularly good, I have included them too.

 North by Northwest
Mistaken identity. Cary Grant is not George Kaplan but nobody will believe him? What follows a fantastic movie-long chase across America.
Brilliant movie that, in typical Hitchcock style, brings you to the edge of the cliff, literally in one scene, and then pulls you back. The suave, sophisticated Grant is perfect as the advertising executive, Roger Thornhill, not really satisfied with his life, who upon raising his hand at exactly the wrong time in a hotel reception area is kidnapped by two nasty heavies. And then the fun begins.
There are many quality set-pieces.
The murder in the United Nations building.
The penultimate scene on Mount Rushmore.
Grant and Eva Marie Saint ordering dinner on a train. (Charged with sexual chemistry)
The drunken Grant nearly driving over a cliff.

To name a few.
Thoroughly enjoyable, high-class Hitchcock.

But

Not only do you get a superb movie but a feast of extras is included. The best one is ""Hitchcock's Signature Style"" in which directors like John Carpenter and William Friedkin discuss what is unique about Hichcock and his films.

Rope
A man is murdered. Can the two murderers conceal his body from the people who keep popping into their apartment?
Not my favourite Hitchcock film. A good performance by James Stewart holds it all together but a bit too talky for my liking.

The Trouble With Harry
What do you do with a dead body?
A bit like ""Rope"" in that the premise is the same but much more light-hearted. A pleasant, undemanding film.

Saboteur
After the success of ""Rebecca"" Hitchcock turned to the spy genre again. Robert Cummings is accused of fire-bombing an airplane factory and murdering his best friend. Again, the film leads us across country with Cummings trying to find the truth, culminating in the brilliant Statue of Liberty scene. Exciting and fast-paced, this is one of Hitchcock's best spy thrillers.

Extras
Watch out for the fascinating interview with Norman Lloyd, Fry in the film, who talks affectionately about his long collaboration with Hitchcock and gives some insights into the making of the film. Highly recommended.

Psycho
A woman tries to escape her dull life to be with her lover, stealing $40,000 from her employers on the way. She drives to her  new life only to make the fatal error of stopping at a Motel just off the highway.

I remember watching this home alone many years ago when it came on network TV for the first time. I was 14 at the time. I ended up watching with one eye on the screen and one eye looking behind me. I had never seen anything as frightening. But, again, as Hitchcock would say, I was thrilled to be frightened.
As time goes by, you realise how for a relatively small budget, a ground breaking horror film had been made. The magnificent performance of Anthony Perkins as the tortured Norman stands out in movie history. The much reviewed shower scene meant that Janet Leigh would only take baths in later life. The eerie old house where Norman and Mother lived has now become a film icon.
A top drawer horror film that influenced so many this has to be in the top 5 of all Hitch's films.

Extras

Possibly only matched by ""North by North West"" for quality, comprehensive extras to be found on this disc. Standout - ""In The Master's Shadow: Hitchcock's legacy""

Shadow of A Doubt

Small town America made rotten by the appearance of Joseph Cotten.

Supposed to be Hitchcock's favourite. A man on the run may be a serial killer. Has he left too many clues for his young niece ? Great game of cat and mouse ensues.

The Man Who Knew Too Much  1956

Doris Day  and James Stewart try to get back their kidnapped son and fight spies along the way in Morocco.
Enjoyable enough but not the master's best work.

Torn Curtain

A lot of trouble on the set on this one. Paul Newman wanted to act in his own inimitable style and Edward Hermann, the composer, after a long partnership with Hitchcock gets fired.
A decent enough espionage thriller. Memorable scene, ""The Oven"".

Frenzy
""The Wrong Man"" theme again. A serial killer threatens London only for an innocent man to be accused who has to go on the run to prove his innocence.
Hitchcock, back in the UK, takes advantage of the relaxed censorship laws to give us a really terrifying film. Some of the murders are unforgettably ""real"".

Extras

Good archival footage of Hitchcock on the set of ""Frenzy"".

""Family Plot""

Hitchcock's final film is a dark comedy. Great performances from Bruce Dern and Karen Black. Not one of Hitch's best but definitely entertaining in a quirky sort of way.

Rear Window

A photographer breaks his leg and has to convalesce at his apartment. Bored, he uses the long lens on his camera to ""spy"" on his neighbours. But wait a minute, what is Raymond Burr up to?
Great climactic scene. Tension simmers nicely. Comic relief by Thelma Ritter. Highly enjoyable film.

Well decked out with extras.

Best

 Pure Cinema: Through the Eyes of the Master
Breaking Barriers: The Sound of Hitchcock
Masters of Cinema  (Archival Interview)

The Birds

What if our feathered friends got their revenge on us for hunting and caging them?
Genuinely scary at times. The experiences of Tippi Hedren on the set have been well documented in recent years. The scene in the attic is oh too real.

Extras

Best one is ""All About The Birds"".

Topaz
Russian missiles and Nato spies.

Not one of my favourites but good enough to watch on a cold, Saturday afternoon.

Vertigo
A man hires an ex-detective to trail his errant wife whom he fears is losing her mind. But the detective, James Stewart, becomes obsessed by the woman leading to the uncovering of a sensational plot.
Considered the best film ever made by critics, this is Hitchcock at his most stylish. The set design is imperious, Kim Novak's costumes are exquisite, the music by Bernard Hermann is hypnotic and Robert Burks' camerawork is sumptuous. The storyline is like a few of Hitch's films, a little over the top but you'll soon forget that when you get drawn into the psychological intensity of ""Vertigo"".  Highly recommended.

Extras

Informative commentary by William Friedkin.
Interesting docu about the restoration of the film.
Hitchcock's collaborators.

The Collection
Very Good

Print quality good to excellent.

1222198,3,B00000IC8A,"There is some confusion here.  There are, as far as I can tell, at least 2 different versions of this title.  The main one pictured is perhaps the one everyone else is writing about (with 15 movies) but the one I received has a profile of Hitch filled in with jagged pix from the included movies.  I just received the item and haven't viewed the blu rays yet and will update if needed.  Without comment about the quality, there are plenty of reviews about that, I will point out that the edition I received only has the original 14 movies included in the DVD edition.  North by Northwest is conspicuous by its absence.  So if you really want that title stick with the higher priced items listed here - as they are NOT all the same.  I am giving it 3 stars because of that confusion.

As I already have To Catch a Thief, North by Northwest, Dial M for Murder and a couple of others in HD copies, digital or BluRay, the missing movie isn't a problem for me but might be for someone else who would be expecting it, so beware.  I only wanted 9 of these titles so the others are just extras for me and saving the $$$ was a plus.  My edition was only $83 at the time of purchase vs $135/199.  After reading the reviews here re: the quality of the transfers in the higher priced editions I took a chance because even at the higher price there were still issues.

1222233,5,B00000IC8A,"THE FILMS: This set was released in 2012 as part of Universal Studio's centennial and contains most (if not all) of the films he directed/produced for them from the 1940's to the 1970's. They are the following:
-Saboteur
-Shadow of a Doubt
-Rope
-Rear Window
-The Trouble with Harry
-The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956 remake)
-Vertigo
-North by Northwest (produced for MGM; now owned by WB/Turner Entertainment)
-Psycho
-The Birds
-Marnie
-Torn Curtain
-Topaz
-Frenzy
-Family Plot
If you'd like know my thoughts on each individual title, just visit its Amazon page. As for the set, I wouldn't consider myself an audio/videophile as such, but the audiovisual presentation of each film looked very good to me. Film grain is a little more apparent/prevalent in some of them, e.g., MARNIE, but on the whole Universal did an outstanding job at restoring these classics.

THE EXTRAS: There are probably people out there who purchased the previous DVD set before upgrading to this Blu-ray collection. I am not one of those people, but for those wary about sinking more money into this I will say that most of the special features seem to have been ported over from previous DVD releases. Of course, why wouldn't you want to have these films looking the best possible anyway? As for the content of the supplementary material, at a bare minimum each title has a 30-60 minute (almost 90 minutes in the case of THE BIRDS) retrospective/making-of documentary, storyboards (which Hitchcock was famous for), production stills/promotional material, and one or two trailers. I found the documentaries to be very informative and provided an interesting look into Hitchcock's working methods and how these particular films came to be. The only one of these documentaries I felt to be not up to standard with the others was the one for TORN CURTAIN, which is essentially a narrated video essay with no talking head interviews. There were also other conspicuous exclusions, such as Shirley MacClaine not being interviewed for THE TROUBLE WITH HARRY and Sean Connery for MARNIE. Otherwise, it was great to hear Hitch's collaborators, daughter Pat, and other filmmakers influenced by him, talk at length about him and his work. NORTH BY NORTHWEST also includes a 90-minute special on Cary Grant that originally aired on PBS. For a select few, however, there is a commentary track and additional short features that go into more detail on stuff like special effects and particular famous sequences, e.g., PSYCHO'S shower scene. These titles are REAR WINDOW, VERTIGO, NORTH BY NORTHWEST, PSYCHO and THE BIRDS. Also included with the set are several short featurettes dealing with Universal Studios in honor of their centennial. Examples include Lew Wasserman (former studio head) and the famous backlot. Overall, for someone who hadn't previously bought the DVD sets, the extras provided with this Blu-ray set are top-notch (with few exceptions) and considerably enriched my enjoyment of and appreciation for these films. They also include a 60-page booklet which includes even more information and tidbits/factoids.

OVERALL: Even though I had seen PSYCHO and THE BIRDS prior to buying this three years ago, I really consider this to be my introduction to Hitchcock. And that's the beauty of this set, really. It's equally valuable to the collector, long-time fan, or the person who is discovering these for the first time. I wouldn't consider this necessarily the definitive Hitchcock collection, as there are plenty of other titles that aren't here, but as a sampling of his American period, this can't really be beat. Sure, not all of them are ""masterpieces,"" but as Leonard Maltin says in one of the retrospective documentaries,"" even 2nd tier Hitchcock is better than most directors today."" Of course, for those who enjoy going beyond the film there is a wealth of material to satisfy your inner historian. My only minor quibble about the set is how the discs are housed. Each disc is inside a sleeve (like the page of a book) and is allowed to move around a bit. I haven't had any problems with scratching (as blu-rays are scratch-resistant anyway), but I would have preferred slots that fit a little more to the contour of a disc. Anyhow, this set was still worth every penny I spent on it (all $149.99, at the time), and will make an invaluable addition to anyone's personal collection.",1439683200,9,4369,5.0248275862068965

1222301,4,B00000IC8A,"***Content***

I won't spend a lot of time discussing content. These are Hitchcock's US films that are currently held by Universal Studios. Is it a complete catalog of Hitchcock's classics? No. Missing are ""The Wrong Man,"" ""Notorious,"" ""Dial M For Murder,"" and ""Strangers on a Train,"" among others. But this set does contain his very best: Vertigo, Psycho, The Birds, Rear Window, North By Northwest (under license from WB), Rope, Shadow of a Doubt, etc.

The question, content-wise, is whether you would be justified purchasing this set when the much cheaper ""Essentials"" collection contains the first five of the very best films listed above. I think the answer depends on what sort of fan you are. If you want the cream of the crop and aren't particularly interested in diving in to his lesser-known catalog and watching his evolution as a film-maker both before and after that peak period, then save yourself seventy bucks and pick up the ""Essentials"" set. They're exactly the same discs, albeit with cheaper packaging. But if you really want to learn about movies, and be entertained, and watch a prolific director change with the times, this set still provides a lot of value for the dollar. Fifteen movies at an average of seven or eight dollars apiece is a pretty healthy bargain.

Extras are copious on the ""greats"" and bit less so on the catalog pieces. Almost all of them are ported over from prior DVDs, and so are low-res letterboxed/pillarboxed presentations. Sigh.

***Packaging***

The set is contained in a relatively sturdy box, and includes a nice softcover book of about 60 pages that shows movie posters, production drawings, and contains some info about each movie. The binder containing the discs is a bit more problematic. Each disc gets its own page in the binder, with graphics similar to the packed in book. But the sleeves are quite flimsy. Where, say, the Star Wars set or the Alien Anthology set were made of thick foam boards that housed each disc, these are very thin paperboard sleeves. Several of my sleeves have already started to let discs slip through the bottom where the glue should be stronger, as opposed to holding the discs securely inside. So although the box, book, and binder are all quite handsome from a graphical standpoint, the binder ends up coming off cheap.

***A/V Quality***

These video transfers are a real mixed bag. A few of them rank up with the best blu-ray discs from similar periods: Vertigo, North By Northwest, and The Trouble With Harry each offer superb detail, rich color, and a very film like experience. Others like Rear Window and Rope are pretty good, but suffer from strange digital noise owing to the way these prints were processed. Some, though, are absolutely wretched. Family Plot and Frenzy are edge-enhanced messes crawling with strange digital noise but also smoothed to heck with DNR. The Man Who Knew Too Much offers up totally bizarre colors, with several actors looking gray and ashen.

Audio is mostly excellent. When soundtracks have been ""upgraded"" to 5.1 channel, they sound respectful and accurate. When we have stereo or mono tracks, dialogue is clear and no undue noise seems evident.

***Conclusion***

This is a great set, and will be thoroughly enjoyed by Hitchcock fans and fans of great cinema. But it has some serious flaws. The packaging stinks and fully a third of the movies look terrible by the standards set by other Blu-Ray transfers of movies from the 30s through the 70s. As long as a customer goes in knowing this, I think tey will ultimately be satisfied.",1414022400,11,3563,4.893864013266998

1222305,5,B00000IC8A,"This region-free collection of the suspense master's late-period works has more movies for less $$$ than the current Region 1 box set, so you'd be mad not to buy it instead. As near as I can tell, it's the same prints and bonus features from the other set. (With that comes some transfer issues that nerdy cineastes like me care about, but I doubt the average movie fan will mind. In any case, until Criterion sub-licenses these films, this is the best you can get.)

The packaging is attractive. The disc menus, because the set is meant to be sold around the world, are a bit cluttered with language options. But that's easy to overlook.

At the risk of starting a flame war, here's how I would tier the films:

UNDISPUTED MASTERPIECES
Vertigo, Rear Window, Psycho

EXCELLENT FILMS
Saboteur, The Birds, Shadow of a Doubt, The Man Who Knew Too Much (this is the 1956 color version with James Stewart and Doris Day, recommend watching in conjunction with Criterions new disk of the original 1938 British version)

STILL OF INTEREST TO HITCHCOCK FANS
Everything else...

Rope is a great one-take experiment that is still being echoed in films like Birdman.

The Trouble with Harry and Family Plot are rare Hitchcock out-and-out comedies. Harry's comedy is dark, about how the discovery of a dead body upends a peaceful Vermont tow. Plot is lighter, with a breezy script by Ernest Lehman, who also wrote North by Northwest.

Frenzy has one of my favorite of all Hitchcock sequences (you'll know it when you see it).  Topaz and Marnie show Hitchcock experimenting with color cinematography. Torn Curtain has one of Hitch's most famous fight scenes, and was the film that a young Stephen Spielberg sneaked onto the set to observe.

ALL IN ALL
You won't really have a complete survey of the master without such indispensable films as North by Northwest, Strangers on a Train, The Lady Vanishes, Rebecca, Spellbound, Foreign Correspondent, The 39 Steps and probably some others that escape me. But given that the rights to these films are spread among many different corporations and carved up by geographic territory, this set is about as good as it gets. For either an introduction to Hitchcock or as part of a completist's collection, this box set is a must-own.",1412208000,5,2258,4.8264248704663215

However, be forewarned that the set is probably a work in progress, with the quality of the blu-ray transfers varying considerably from movie to movie. I guess they rushed this out without waiting for proper transfers of some of the titles.

The new transfers - especially a gorgeous new one of THE TROUBLE WITH HARRY - will make you see these movies in a new light (the beautiful New England fall foliage captured in HARRY was a revelation, with the movie looking like it could have been shot this year).

However, others like THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH and even the later titles like FRENZY and FAMILY PLOT could have used a bit of spit and polish. The pictures look a bit grainy.

Some of his best know films are in this set...and the blu-ray only makes them better.  Almost like seeing them for the first time in the movie theater, the films look crisp and clear and plain beautiful.  Vertigo is my favorite Hitchcock film.  I fell in love with it when I saw it for the first time in college in the mid sixties....it was not being praised then as it is now....but I knew then that I loved this film...and sat through it several times when they did an all day showing at the library of my college.  I could not wait to buy the long playing album of the score...but it was a hard to find item...so it was years before I finally was able to find it....no Amazon or internet in those days...so the search was always in any record shop in any city one passed through....and usually with no luck.

There have been many comments about poor quality transfers on some of the discs, and I agree. But, some of these films had poorly processed shots to begin with, so I can't really fault the transfers for this. I have owned all of these films on DVD before buying this set, I think the films look much better on blu-ray. Many of the extras were leftovers from the dvd releases, so I had no problem taking my old dvds down to the local used record/video store to sell. I would have like to have seen some of the Selznick releases included, but I will just have to buy them separately. All in all, a great collection of films!!",1391644800,2,729,4.2898550724637685

I would NOT buy it at full price, since the # of films actually worth owning is fairly limited.  The packaging is beautiful with the movie posters next to each film making easy to locate each film.  The only thing I don't like about this item is the fact that each movie is in a sleeve.  I prefer the designs that let you push the disk down onto a post so there's no risk of disks falling out if my kids aren't careful.

The quality of the few Blu Rays we have watched is very impressive.

Buyers not very familiar with Hitchcock should know, though that there are several other good and great Hitchcock films available on Blu Ray that are not included here so you should look into buying those as well.",1385164800,3,881,4.50314465408805

I have always loved Alfred Hitchcock movies. His direction is outstanding and always with some humor. This collection includes most of the best of his masterpieces. The blu-ray transfer is very good although a couple of movies (Family Plot & Marnie, in particular) are a bit dull/grainy in appearance. This does not hinder the value of the movies...I just thought they (Universal) could/should have been able to ""clean up"" the picture quality better.

Anyway, full of suspense and intrigue, these movies are worthy to be part of anyone's Blu-ray/DVD collection. Also, each movie includes production information as well as interviews from the actors, screenwriters and other collaborating parties. A truly outstanding collection.

1222358,5,B00000IC8A,"Just got it yesterday and I'm 2 movies in! Packaging is great --- I don't understand some of the negative comments about this. The book, disc holding sleeves and box should stand up for a long time if you use just a little care (and most blu ray owners I know do). Shadow of a doubt looks best it ever has. Vertigo jumps off the screen ---- amazing! This review will continue to grow as I continue to view the films ----- but so far so good! Update, Trouble with Harry looks truly amazing! Colors, scenery & clothing really pop in HD. Deep blacks rich reds, yellows & oranges. This might be my demo disc for showing what Blu can do for older flicks.

Update: as I have viewed most of the collection now I can truly say this was well worth getting! Psycho deep blacks, moody excellent print! Frenzy, NBNW and Rear window just blow me away. Probably because I owned most on VHS tapes years ago (some recorded off tv). If you like Hitchcock this set is everything you'd hope it would be.",1382572800,2,984,4.318918918918919
1222359,1,B00000IC8A,"I can't comment on the content of the set (which I'm sure is magnificent due to the title of the boxset) because I've had to return it to Amazon TWICE now due to defective packaging from Universal.  The first set was almost completely unglued and the discs slid around freely in the sleeves (and sometimes completely out of the BOTTOM of the book).  Some were scratched pretty badly and one had actually been GLUED into the sleeve as a result of the shoddy manufacturing of the book-style disc holder.  The second set was in better shape but still had a few minor scratches on some discs and then some not-so-minor ones.  On one of the last discs was a big greasy fingerprint -- not mine.  And then while examining the last few discs, the disc holder started coming unglued in the exact same way the first one had.  Discs started to slide out of the book again.  Ridiculous!  I hadn't even had it in my hands for 3 minutes.  Completely unacceptable for such an expensive product.  Univeral is notorious for cheaping-out when it comes to their releases but this kind of poorly-made product just shows contempt for the consumer.  I'll change my review when I get a functional product.  Until then, I'll just say that Universal needs to pull their heads out.",1381968000,40,1255,4.603603603603603

Overall, the picture and audio quality are very good. The Masterpiece Collection is also fully loaded with over 15 hours of previously released extras (especially Rear Window, Vertigo, North by Northwest, Psycho, and The Birds). I haven't checked them all yet but I noticed the new Psycho Sound feature on the stand-alone Psycho Special Edition Blu-Ray has even been included. An exclusive 58-page collectible book is also included. The exclusive content on this release celebrates 100 years of Universal. On 'Vertigo' we have ""100 Years of Universal: The Lew Wasserman Era."" And on 'The Birds"" there is ""Restoring the Classics"", ""The Lot"" and ""Hitchcock's Monster Movie."" My only complaint is that the transfers of Marnie and Family Plot could have been better.

The 15 Hitchcock Films Included: Saboteur / Shadow Of A Doubt / Rope / Rear Window / The Trouble With Harry / The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956) / Vertigo / North By Northwest / Psycho / The Birds / Marnie / Torn Curtain / Topaz / Frenzy / Family Plot.

This Universal collection is missing a few key Hitchcock titles. Strangers on a Train, I Confess and The Wrong Man belong to Warner Bros along with acquisitions Mr. and Mrs. Smith, Suspicion, Stage Fright and Dial M for Murder. To Catch a Thief is also absent because Paramount owns the rights.

The color and detail in ""Rear Window"" and The ""Birds"" is simply breathtaking.  The gray value and rich blacks in Psycho were equally impressive.  I never realized that the lettering on Mr. Stewart's cast is actually legible as are all the labels on the various cans and boxes and little toys in the Bodega Bay general store.  I'm watching on a 50"" plasma, but I felt like I was in the theater.

I'd be the first to admit however, that, although I am a big fan of Mr. Hitchcock's movies I am no expert or film connisseur and so some of the flaws mentioned about the transfers of other films might escape my notice.

The collection is packed with tons of bonus material including trailers and a surprising amount of other stuff.  There was a ""making of"" film about The Birds that ran well over one hour and contained fascinating insights into the germination of the idea, to production decisions, to great story boards mapping out the action.  The actors also offered their own insights and recollections.

No doubt there are some flaws as have been pointed out in other reviews, but from my perspective they do little to diminish the overall quality of the collection.  As for value, I picked up the collection on an amazon ""deal of the day"" just before Christmas and I think it was $101 for the set--an incredible bargain.  That's approximately $6.30 per blu ray DVD and is less money than the standard def, DVDS.",1367884800,6,1598,4.571929824561403

Even DVD versions of Hitchcock's movies tended to stay somewhat expensive.  However, I waited and eventually found this set on an Amazon deal of the day for $120, which is a terrific price for 15 of his best films.  The transfers are gorgeous, and the supplemental/bonus features quite excellent.  Some of the movies appear to be given extraordinarily fabulous treatment; 'Vertigo' never looked and sounded as lush as it does here.

He loves the packaging, information they supplied on each film and how each disc is place on seperate pages in plastic.  What is really nice is that each film disc and poster is organized in chronological order by the orginal release date.

Other reviewers have mentioned ""Family Plot"" and ""Marnie"" as flawed and this is true, but not for the full duration. Oddly, both of these films have some shots that have a low-res pixilated quality to them. But other major segments are beautiful high-def images. Why the inconsistency? I can say that they have ""Frenzy"" corrected with the original titles and it looks terrific. ""Vertigo"" also looks beautiful to me, but there is the one shot at the end in the bell tower that is out of focus. Was it photographed that way in the original? How does a high-def transfer render one shot out of focus?

I was looking forward to it for personal reasons, having attended the premiere of this film as a kid at the LA Filmex event and a dinner honoring Hitchcock afterwards at the Century Plaza Hotel.  Aside from the poor ""Marnie"" transfer, which some reviewers commented may be due to source materials, the rest of the set is amazing and well worth the money.

I am never one that expects movies that old to look as good as something made today, so the grain and glitches in the video that you occasionally see do not bother me all that much.  The films that have been restored like Rear Window do look great however.  I also think the extras that you get on each movie are very good.  The documentaries which have interviews with the remaining stars, film makers and Hitchcock family members are very good.  I don't really know how this compares to the DVDs that are already out there.  You probably want to research whether this will be that much of an upgrade to what you already have if you own any of the movies included here.

1222421,5,B00000IC8A,"This review will only discuss the price and overall quality of the collection. The movies are all great and don't need another review after 50 yeras. People who buy these movies have seen them all already and know what to expect.

After purchasing Monsters from Amazon UK, I just received the masterpiece collection from UK. The only problem (...minor) is that it took three and a half weeks to come (probably DHL had somebody walked it to my house from Edimburgh or London). Otherwise everything is perfect. I watched all the movies with ...presumably bad transfer that people talk on this page including Marnie, and everything looks just fine. It is true that the UK collection has 14 movies instead of 15 for the US collection. I am not missing North by Northwest because I already own a nice blu ray copy with the book. I also own ""Psycho"". Great movies, great entertainment all around.

Outstanding quality!  I just want to remind everybody that those movies are 50 years old. They look PERFECT on blu ray. I just watched one of my favorites ""The Birds"". Since I watched this movie I cannot stand birds. Each time I see one, or in the morning when I see them perched on the phone lines out of my house, the first thing that comes to mind is the Hitchcock movie. I am just affraid that they will attack. The view of the gaz station burning taken from a bird's point of view is great. Let's not forget that this was made in 1961-62 and the special effects are all ....man-made. No computers, no special software etc. We can just wonder what great movies Hitchcock would have made today with all the help!

I bought the masterpiece collection, limited edition, in a nice black book with Hitchcock's signature on the cover protected by a nice case ...decorated with birds for 86.42 pounds which is $139.18 (depending on the day they charge you) plus some exchange fees. It comes to about $10/movie on blu ray disks. Not a bad price for some really classic movies with great sound and picture. The packaging is interesting and much better than the one used in the James Bond collection. Same principle but different storage. The movies are in pouches and are easy to access.

As always, ordering from Amazon UK is easy since you can use the same account as the US account. It is still much cheaper from the same overpriced collection in US if you don't mind waiting. By the way, the limited edition in the nice black book with a case is NOT available anymore. I hope somebody can explain to me the difference in price. The only explanation I have is that the economy in Europe is really bad and people don't spend. Thus, they need to drop the prices in order to sell merchandise. However, Amazon UK still makes money with these low prices! Imagine how much money Universal makes in this country.

Between these two collections (Hitchcock and Monsters), I saved enough money to purchase the Bond collection for $150 from Amazon US the day it came out. I urge everybody to do their homework. Sometimes even Best Buy has better prices than Amazon. Don't misunderstand me, Amazon has a great collection of movies (especially foreign movies) and great prices, but sometimes Best Buy and Walmart have great deals. In addition, Walmart has serious unique deals on great family movies (October baby, Touchback, Saints and soldiers airborne creed, For Greater Glory etc) that for some reason Amazon doesn't have immediately when they come out. Some of them are offered later, while other never show up. Still waiting for October baby.

Great collection at a great price from Amazon UK! Five stars if don't mind waiting.",1354924800,4,3610,4.693522906793049

1222423,4,B00000IC8A,"There are three absolutely gorgeous new transfers contained in this set of 15 Hitchcock films:
1. Rear Window
2. The Trouble with Harry
3. Vertigo [the color issues discovered in the pre-release copies have been corrected, and the U.S. edition does have a fine sounding mono option]

The two transfers that have had previous releases and are still available as ""stand alones"" are also stellar:
1. North by Northwest (despite some color issues)
2. Psycho

Seven of the transfers are acceptable high definition upgrades from their previous standard def releases:
1. Saboteur
2. Shadow of a Doubt
3. Rope
4. The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956) [This one really needs a restoration--but the problem here, isn't the transfer per se]
5. Torn Curtain
6. Topaz
7. Frenzy [The problem with the credits that were discovered in pre-release copies has been corrected]

That leaves us with three very problematic transfers:
1. The Birds -- clearly a lot of work went into this so-called restoration -- and I understand how difficult it is to work with the primitive process shots that never looked very good to begin with -- but the amount of digital artifacting that is evident in some scenes (particularly the segment involving Tippi Hedren crossing and re-crossing a bay) is simply unacceptable.  Much of the movie looks better than it ever has on home video, but ""traveling"" video noise should never be evident.

2. Marnie - I *love* film grain, but too frequently the grain in this transfer looks like old fashioned television static from a poor signal.

3. Family Plot - Grain the size of basketballs and an overall look that implies the movie was shot through a sand filter makes this disc, by far, the worst transfer in the set.  Depending on your sensitivity to such things, the movie is viewable, but still this transfer should never have been allowed to leave the studio.

1222425,4,B00000IC8A,"Unfortunately this Blu-ray set from Universal is a mix of original release negatives and the 1980's revival re-issue negatives.

After marveling at the crispness of ""THE TROUBLE WITH HARRY"", mastered from the original VistaVision YCM color separation negatives, I put in ""THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH"" and was a bit disappointed.  It looked good, but not great. Then about 30 minutes into the movie the colors became unsteady, the Yellow Negative seemed to be causing the hues on the walls to shift, this lasted about 20 minutes.  The Albert Hall sequence is the best sequence, looking crisp & bright.  Then the end logo came up and it was the 1980's UNIVERSAL re-issue logo (remember this was a Paramount VistaVision production)!  Now I  know why the film looked a little grainy & unstable, it was the 1980's revival re-issue print!.

This is the only pre-""THE BIRDS"" film that I found issues with, all others seem to use their original release negatives worthy of Blu-ray.
I'm still going through all of the discs, but so far ""ROPE"", ""REAR WINDOW"", ""THE TROUBLE WITH HARRY"", ""VERTIGO"", ""NORTH BY NORTHWEST"", ""PSYCHO"", and ""THE BIRDS"" all look great, crisp and sharp with great color (if in color).

After ""THE BIRDS"" the quality in general goes down, higher film grain and weaker colors.
The other movies receiving complaints from fans are ""MARNIE"", with enough grain that it looks like a DVD and negative dust specks that should have been removed, and ""FAMILY PLOT"" which seems to suffer from the cheap Eastmancolor Negatives that Technicolor was using in the 1970's.

I think some re-mastering and replacements are in order for at least these three titles.

Oh, and who thinks that VHS tape release commercials are the original theatrical release trailers?  Apparently Universal does!  THE TROUBLE WITH HARRY trailer even shows the VHS tape box at the end.",1354060800,12,1857,4.95483870967742
1222426,4,B00000IC8A,"Let's put aside the fact that this contains North by Northwest, which has been omitted in both the prior DVD version of the Masterpiece Collection and the UK box set of this collection. The fact is there was no one quite like Hitchcock, his quirky since of humor, ingenious approach to film making and story telling ability are still unmatched to this day.  The man was a genius, and these films, all of them, show that off.  There are omissions to each of these box sets that could, and undoubtedly should, have been added.  But reasons for their omission are as varied as the topics Hitchcock covered.  The real problem with this set is it's outer skin, who ever chose to use the Pop Art Serial Killer font for the cover grossly underestimated the audience. The prior release, only to DVD was in a beautiful red velvet covered box, and was one of my prize collections.  Beautifully put together and nice to display.  This set is not that, while it contains every movie offered in the prior one, plus North by Northwest, all digitally remastered, the packaging is an eyesore, something you want to shelve and forget about.  Like a few intrepid people on here I followed the lead to Amazon.uk and fell in love with the European edition of this set. There have been some notable concerns and issues with some of the sets sold by Amazon.uk as not living up to the description, mine, thankfully, was not one of them.  It arrived exactly as promised, and just as beautiful as the images show.  It is a true work of art, including the containing ""book"" which holds the movies.  So, in short, if you don't already own the Red Velvet box, or any of these fine films in Blu-Ray, and you don't want to risk/wait on Amazon.uk, then by all means get it.  If you do own the prior box and are happy with it, pass on this set, either upgrade your favorites to Blu-Ray individually or, once Amazon.uk has them back in stock, order it.  It is amazing.

In short, one cannot go wrong with Hitchcock, the set is worth every penny, but I subtracted one star for the overall presentation as this is also the ugliest box set I have ever seen.",1353888000,2,2121,4.477922077922078
1222427,5,B00000IC8A,"I have recently received my copy of the collection, and my guess is that the ""issues"" with Marnie (and likely the other films in this collection that are receiving poor reviews) are related to the way the films were originally made, not modern transfer/mastering mistakes. In Marnie, it is clear that all of the soft focus shots are done in post processing. The grain and color issues ONLY occur during the film's soft focus closeups and special effects shots. At the time that Marnie was made, these types of post processing special effects, dissovles, fades, mattes, etc. were created using an optical printing techniques. This always created degradation, since one generation of film was lost in the reprinting process. Optical printing shots often vary in quality from movie to movie, depending on the type of film, the equipment, and the optical printer operator. Most films of this period use few of these shots for more than a couple of seconds at a time, usually during fades or dissolves. Marnie seems to have a lot, as it appears that Hitchcock chose to create the soft-focus closeups in post processing. I'm sure that you would rather have the film as Hitchcock intended it, rather than a film with remastered special effects that would likely stray from the original presentation of the film, right? This is hypothetical anyway, since it is incredibly rare to have access to all of the original film elements in order to rebuild these kinds of post process shots, since they were rarely saved.

Please take my words with grain of salt. I viewed the Marnie Blu-ray on a DLP projector at 106""... DLP tends to be more forgiving to certain types of image artifacts than LCD or Plasma so this grain may be more accentuated and annoying on those playback systems. Perhaps there are better ways to deal with the added grain and softness from these types of post processing shots, but I don't believe the rumors that Universal has somehow added or caused this grain problem during transfer or mastering of these Blu-ray discs.",1353628800,19,2030,4.85014409221902

CONTACT UNIVERSAL TODAY AND DEMAND A RECALL!!

""Family Plot"" looks awful with a pixelated image. I guarantee that you haven't seen a worse looking blu-ray. Go watch it on youtube and you'll get about the same quality as some parts of this blu-ray.
""The Man Who Knew Too Much"" has NOT been restored and is in danger of being lost forever as originally filmed because Universal decided not to spend money on restoring the film, despite this being a money-making film for them (that will pay for its own restoration) and, again Universal is NOT hurting for cash. They can afford it, but chose not to and chose to charge YOU top dollar for them being cheap. DO NOT ACCEPT THIS!
The sky pulsates between blue and yellow, which distracts viewers. Colors throughout the film are wrong and change mid-scene. It makes Hitchcock look incompetent. Universal couldn't even apply proper color correction. Bad Universal.
""Marnie"" has noise on the image for the first 17 chapters. It needs to be redone.
More minor problems exist on almost all of the other films, like screwing up the color during the titles of Vertigo...the list is long, my friends, including Frenzy's edge enhancement among issues.

1222433,4,B00000IC8A,"Costco had this set today (11/7/12) for $163.99. They have had the complete Bond Blu-Ray set for less than $150 and the Universal Monster set for under $100, though the last two have disappeared from my local Costco.",1352246400,8,216,4.7105263157894735
1222434,4,B00000IC8A,"After having watched all the movies in this set I have mixed feelings about the quality of the transfers for ""Alfred Hitchcock: The Masterpiece Collection""; a number of transfers look exceptinally good while others look exceptional bad. I'm hoping as archievist Robert Harris as suggested in comments that Universal will recall the titles that weren't done correctly and redo them. Let's examine the individual titles shall we?

All the titles in this set features the original special features (except for the commentary track featuring James Katz, Robert Harris and Herbert Coleman) from the DVD releases/boxed set from a couple of years back but presented in standard definition. The commentary tracks are also included as well. The original mono soundtrack for ""Vertigo"" appears here and the redone 5.1 mix improves on the previous version which featured new sound effects, etc. that had to be done because the original elements are missing. The mix is a bit more subtle and more closely resembles the original mono track (although it hasn't been redone I suspect it was tweaked a bit for this new transfer).

1. ""Saboteur""-The earliest film in this set looks quite nice with nice depth and clarity. Grade: A

2. ""Shadow of a Doubt""-I've seen complaints that the film uses an older HD master and that digital noise reduction was overused on this title. I think it looks fine if a bit soft. Grade: A

3. ""Rope"" looks decent although the colors could have been stronger and there are speckles evident in the film used for the transfer that haven't been cleaned up. Grain is inconsistent. Grade: C

4. We jump ahead a number of years to Hitch's classic ""Rear Window"". Although this doesn't use the restored negative prepared by Robert Harris a number of years back, it looks really good. The colors are nicely reproduced and although there are some minor issues with the transfer, most folks aren't going to notice or care. This is a very nice restoration job by Universal to this title. Grade: A-

5. ""The Man Who Knew Too Much""-Looks OK although colors are inconsistent as are density and detail. Grade: C. There is also quite a bit of lip flap where the audio is slightly out-of-synch with the action. Perhaps this was on the earlier version I don't recall.

6. ""The Trouble with Harry"" evidently has survived remarkably well with nice color, clarity and depth to the image. Grade: A

7. ""Vertigo"" along with ""Rear Window"", ""North by Northwest"", ""Psycho"" and ""The Birds"" is, to many people, one of the crown jewels of this set. Hitch's most personal film received a critical lukewarm reaction in 1958 when it was released. Rarely seen until it's reissue in the 1980's the stature of the film has grown. Grade: A

Harris worked on the restoration of this title and, if I'm not mistaken, he was consulted on this title for the Blu-ray.

Overall ""Vertigo"" looks marvelous although one could nitpick about some minor issues with the title but, on the whole, this looks exceptional.

8. ""North by Northwest"" features the same digitally restored transfer that was released individually by Warner Home Video. Grade: A

9. ""Psycho"" features the same digitally restored transfer that Universal did recently. Grade: A-
10. ""The Birds"" features a restored version of the film prepared for the 50th Anniversary of the film (it is being preped for an individual release next year along with some of the other titles in this set). ""The Birds"" varies from exceptional to just OK from shot-to-shot. Grade: B ""The Birds"" was a difficult project to restore due to the overwhelming amount of process shots in the film.

11. ""Marnie"" has a number of issues including the use of (reportedly) an older HD transfer for the film. As others have mentioned the film probably could have benefited from a digital facelift to eliminate the speckles and various other flaws evident in this transfer. Hopefully Universal will return to this title at some point and correct the issues dogging this title. Grade: D
12. ""Torn Curtain"" Grade: B+

""Torn Curtain"" is considered one of Hitchcock's lesser films for good reason--Paul Newman and Julie Andrews have little in the way of on screen chemistry, the replacement of Bernard Herrmann's fascinating original score (although the replacement score isn't bad--it just can't match Herrmann's)and the use of process shots are painfully obvious in many instances. The script had potential but just doesn't gel. There is a marvelous sequence which compares to the best Hitchcock had ever done where Newman's character has to kill an enemy agent using a gas oven. It's a marvelous, intense sequence but it's a pity that it isn't in a better film.

13. ""Topaz"" Grade: B
""Topaz"" was problematic from the very beginning as Hitchcock was working with a script by Leon Uris that Hitchcock considered a disaster. Hitchcock sometimes shot sequences only hours before they were finished after bringing in veteran writer Samuel Taylor (""Vertigo"", ""Sabrina"")to rework the script but, beyond a couple of sequences, ""Topaz"" didn't engage Hitchcock. The film looks decent. Hitchcock couldn't decide on his ending so he shot THREE endings.

14. ""Frenzy"" An older HD transfer with heavy handed use of DNR which smears some of the details, skin textures,  the film looks decent. Color looks nice and depth is much improved. ""Frenzy"" is considered by many to be a late classic from Hitch and a return to form after stumbling with ""Torn Curtain"" and ""Topaz"". Grade:B

The issue with the opening titles (Universal found the backing footage and generated new opening titles that were rife with misspellings and uses the wrong font for the opening)have been corrected by going back to the original opening titles for the film.

15. ""Family Plot"" the most recent Hitchcock film SHOULD have looked the best here and been the least problematic but, in fact, it looks the WORST. The film is a pixelated nightmare looking like a badly upscaled 480p/DVD transfer. Of all the titles in this set ""Family Plot"" is the one that needs to be redone the most urgently and replaced. Grade: F

The packaging isn't all that great in my opinion. The design of this set is similiar to the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alien-Anthology-Blu-ray/dp/B001AQO3QA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alien Anthology [Blu-ray</a>from a couple of years. While it's compact, to take the titles out you have to slide them out of the cardboard pages of the book style packaging. The slipcase is extremely sturdy and we get a 58 page paperback book with photos of memorabilia and trivia about each film much like the DVD boxed set from 2005.

The only special feature that appears to be missing is a segment of the AFI Tribute to Hitchcock as far as I can tell and the only new extra is a 15 minute featurette on ""The Birds"" (it's quite good if a bit short).

Even the least popular title in this set deserves to be digitally restored, (the ""digitally restored"" comment on the back of this set is hyperbole--there are SOME titles that have been digitally restored but many have not been) but the best titles in this set look extremely good. You may want to wait until these titles are individually released if you can't get this at a good price as there are great movies and so-so ones in this set.",1351987200,239,7296,4.958230958230958
1222435,1,B00000IC8A,"This is a real kick in the butt from Universal.  One of the most requested films on Blu-Ray has been ""The Birds"" for some time now, and no release date has ever been announced by them; now they include it in this collection and you're only able to obtain it by shelling out $225.00 for 14 more titles that you may already have several of or just plain not want.  I won't be buying any more discs from Universal; this is an insult to their customers and just a way to bring in more profit.",1351987200,26,488,4.126315789473685
1222436,4,B00000IC8A,"Having watched the first four movies---I'm very happy with image quality.  But the packaging leaves much to be desired.  Each disc is in a cardboard sleeve. And this makes removing each disc (without smudging them) very difficult.  Otherwise, I'd give this collection 5 stars.

11-12-12--update--having watched all 15 movies--I'd give image quality pretty much 5 stars--although colors on ""North by Northwest"" seem more saturated than on my original stand alone BD copy--which I think I will keep.  But the cardboard packaging is simply horrid and is starting to come apart.  I am purchasing some blank blu ray snap cases to safely house these discs.  Because I don't think the packaging will survive another removal of any disc.  Simply the worst packaging of any blu ray movie I own.",1351987200,11,785,5.078125
1222437,4,B00000IC8A,"The four stars are an accurate rating of the transfer quality of most of the films in this collection.  A few rate five stars (""Vertigo"", ""The Birds"" and ""Rear Window"", for example).

But there are real defects in two of the titles in this set: Both ""Marnie"" and ""Family Plot"" were given slipshod transfers.  ""Marnie"" particularly (a film I consider one of Hitchcock's masterpieces) has visual specks throughout, and some scenes of ""weak"" color.  If you don't believe me, just go to a scene mid-way in the film and freeze the frame on a closeup.  You'll see what seems a shabby grill on the faces.  The images aren't clear and seemingly form a grill pattern.  (""Frenzy"" also exhibits flaws but not as seriously as those two.)  These problems are obviously due to a lack of quality control in mastering these discs.  To see the difference compare these two titles to ""The Birds"" or ""Rear Window"" and check the clarity and brightness of their color images in a freeze-frame.  This crappy transferring is reprehensible for Universal in not taking the proper care to make sure the master Hitchcock has been given the treatment he deserves. They made so much money from the great works by this brilliant filmmaker they could have at least given ALL these films the highest quality treatment in Blu-ray technology!

This is certainly a trivial point, but also demonstrating Universal's inherent sloppiness, is that on a few of the discs, the spectacular new Universal corporate logo is actually shown TWICE in a row through an error in the disc making!  (Note: I noticed this only in the UK region-free release!)

Most of the other discs are very good to superb, but these two (and some transferring flaws in ""Frenzy"" as well) could be enough for many to reject this set.  I won't return it because most of the discs are essential to anyone's collection at it is, but I will continue to hope that in the future a new Blu-ray master of ""Marnie"" will be redone and made available in a beautiful transfer! UNIVERSAL OWES IT TO EVERYONE WHO LOVES THE ART OF CINEMA!

The technicians at Universal who are responsible for these shabby transfers should be ashamed of themselves!

Bob Blenheim

PS: Many chastise reviewers for lowering the rating of great films because of flaws in the quality of the discs; They say only the film should be rated.  I agree with them for the most part.  But still, the low quality of several of these disc transfers, I think, should properly reflect at least one star lower to warn buyers.  I admit if these discs were all superb the set would inarguably garner 5 stars by anyone remotely interested in film. These movies are among the greatest in the history of cinema.  They ALL need to handled with the utmost of care as if they were treasures (which they are!).",1351814400,589,2784,4.698969072164949
1222438,5,B00000IC8A,"I just saw this at Costco for $163 and at about $10 per movie I consider this a bargain .... regardless of what it would cost buying from an overseas vendor...

I am staggered by the beauty of the prints and I'm something of a cinema diva when it comes to color or classic black and white....between sharpness and contrast I'm picky and this meets my expectations and exceeds them.

As far as the packaging ...I find it stunning. The book that holds the discs is quality and the images on the pages in hi gloss are striking and very fun in the style of the original posters etc.. The book that comes with it isn't a coffee table book but its more than window dressing (excuse that rear pun) and I enjoyed browsing through it. All of this isn't some overblown size either...its appropriate to its size and easy to store.

I actually do not have a problem with the standard Universal menu pages as others do...I find them easy to understand and navigate....some makers are getting so clever just navigating the normal options is almost like finding ""easter eggs"".

I'm not going to review these classic films and lets just say when hyperbole is rampant THESE ARE classics... but I wanted to give a pricing heads up to those interested and confirm that unlike what some are saying these films look superb and they have transferred all the bonus features from the normal DVDs...and I'd like to add that THAT is becoming more scarce these days with Blu Rays coming out lacking some of the informative bonus features of the normal discs causing them to need to be kept by true collectors and if you are looking at this set you are a collector and not someone who would just want Psycho or North By Northwest ...etc

Vertigo was a flop on its initial release, and The Trouble With Harry did well in England, but not in America--people were expecting from these films something that they did not get, which caused them to overlook the greatness.... Inexplicably, Topaz, Marnie and even Rope are seen as inferior works not worthy of the director....oh well....

I have no idea why the set is so expensive in America. ""Strangers on  a Train"" is released separately on blu ray but is not on this set and I have doubts that there is a different version that includes ""North by Northwest""-why would it, its been released on blu ray already.

The standard from what I have seen is excellent, ""Vertigo"" looks one hundred percent better than the always inferior normal DVD.

""Issues with set! Shoddy Work by Universal!

1 STAR: Hopefully Universal wil have the decency to delay this set and--if that happens--I will remove this review. Until then, I will leave this up as a warning to those considering purchasing this set. Essentially, several films in the set have been the victims of botched digital encoding. This has left them looking ""digitized"" and of worse quality than the previous DVD editions. As if this was not horrific enough, Universal has redone the title credits on Frenzy, misspelling many of the words. This is likely just the tip of the iceberg, and this does not bode well for the set having effective packaging--others issues will certainly arise. Please fix these issues Universal! Otherwise, Hitchcock fans will be paralyzed in suspense waiting to receive this collection only to discover that the true horror of this set is not ""Psycho"" or ""Frenzy"", but the shoddy product passed off by Universal as a $300 set!

Specific issues as per noted by respected film enthusiast and expert Nick Wrigley (a founder of the British ""Masters of Cinema"" collectors label)

'1.) The credits on FRENZY, and if at all possible a new FRENZY encode without DVNR (it's the only film in the entire box that has this level of paralyzing DVNR, and it's lazy). If they're redoing the credits they'll have to do a new encode anyway. Turn the DVNR box off.
2.) MARNIE and TORN CURTAIN have really fuzzy, crap encodes. The films look like DVDs playing through a 1080p fuzz filter. I'd redo both encodes.
3.) FAMILY PLOT is a bit of a mess. Don't really know what's happened to this one. Parts look awful, parts look okay. Look into this and try and redo?'""

EDIT (9/14/12): Universal has delayed the boxset to Oct. 30th, and is correcting these issues. 5 Stars to Universal for doing the correct thing!",1347494400,27,1870,4.813084112149533

Early analysis of the discs points up problematic transfers for MARNIE, TORN CURTAIN, FAMILY PLOT and FRENZY. In at least MARNIE's case it appears these are not just poor transfers but actual errors in the authoring. Rumours have already spread that the set may be delayed. Even if it is not, it's quite likely that a mail-in replacement programme wll be initiated, so buyer beware.",1347494400,21,514,5.130952380952381
1222452,3,B00000IC8A,"Reviewer Nick Wrigley has pre-release review copies and has posted of several mastering errors and other problems.

Notably:

* For Frenzy:

""A completely re-rendered opening credit sequence for this new HD master introduces typographical inconsistencies, wrong fonts, typos, and multiple errors in crew members' names. Parts of the film are slathered in noticeable DVNR which causes undesirable effects. I can't recommend this disc. Dear Universal, when the credits get fixed (which hopefully involves simply putting the original credits back, regardless of softness or damage), please dial back the DVNR across the whole film too.""

* DVNR issues on ""Shadow of a Doubt"" (Yes, Universal strikes again)

* Bad ""non-film like"" encoding on ""Marnie"" and ""Torn Curtain""

* Color shifts during the titles of ""Vertigo"" and the English audio is reprocessed 5.1 ONLY - no original mono or stereo mix, just faux surround.

1222453,1,B00000IC8A,"It has been noted elsewhere online that there are glaring mistakes made and changes to credits and font in the titles and credits of some of the Hitchcock films in the set. Notably Frenzy!  AS for Vertigo:
""VERTIGO - BD50 - R0 - Checkdisc date 13th August 2012
BD film length 02:08:27 / VC-1 / DTS-HD MA 5.1 Ch. 48kHz / Confirmed AR 1.85:1

There is no option on the menus for original mono, 2.0, or 5.1, just ""English"" which plays the 5.1 track (see pic). When you play the BD without a 5.1 speaker system, you're getting the DTS-HD MA 5.1 Ch. track `folded down' to stereo. All the other languages are plain DTS 2.0, except the Japanese track which is DTS 5.1.

The colours at the start have been altered. The VistaVision screen is b+w, the first shot after that is extremely drained sepia, and then it turns completely red. This is apparently more like it should be but there are concerns that the rest of the titles contain far too much colour.""

As for DVNR, apparently it was used heavy-handily on Shadow of a Doubt.

All this is very disconcerting of such an overly expensive set.
One should also note that the US set is 90 dollars more and only includes one more selection which has already been released sufficiently in Blu-ray.

7910541,3,B00000IC8A,"Five stars for the movies, of course.  And five stars for the transfers of The Birds and Rear Window, four for Vertigo and North by Northwest.  The black-and-white films look okay.  The problems reside with Marnie (the worst of the batch and truly worthy of being recalled - a complete travesty), Trouble With Harry, which everyone thinks looks amazing, could look much more amazing with a transfer from the actual VistaVision negative, Torn Curtain looks barely better than the DVD and is, of course, the same transfer, same with Topaz - The Man Who Knew Too Much looks better than the DVD but not much - it, too, needs a transfer from the VistaVision negative.  So, at some point Universal will hopefully treat ALL these films as they should be treated - with fresh 4k transfers of Marnie, Torn Curtain, Topaz, Frenzy, The Man Who Knew Too Much, The Trouble With Harry, and Family Plot (also a travesty).  Treat these films the right way, please - they are all crown jewels, even the worst of them.

As to The Birds - that is a really fine new transfer, that is receiving some brickbats from people who simply do not know whereof they speak.  I was very happy with that transfer, and a little more work on Vertigo would help the few problems that remain.",1519516800,,1256,4.580357142857143
