  I only took off one star because
  (1) The music, should you choose to put it on, is terrible.  I thought at least the standards would be safe.  Not so!  It was mostly jazz... and let's face it: any noise on earth is more enjoyable than jazz.
  (2) I wish the loop were a little longer.  It seems like I have to start it over a lot.
  Still, I am very happy with the purchase.  There are no weird advertisements or anything else I've seen people complain about with these products.  I say go for it.",1389484800,2,723,4.1678832116788325
