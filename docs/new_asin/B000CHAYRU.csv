8099029,3,B000CHAYRU,"I watched this short documentary because it had been a special feature to another Islam documentary which I own, Secrets of the Koran (from the History Channel). Although the information in the film was accurate, it was WAY too basic. It barely skimmed the surface. The episode on Muhammad from the Biography Channel gives the very basics of Muhammads life and the doctrines of Islam, but it really does not go into the intricacies of Muhammads life, his struggles to spread Islam, or anything.
I mean, this movie would be good for kids or others who do not have the attention span to watch an in-depth documentary or for people taking a history class who just want to know enough to pass a test on Islam, but honestly, if you are genuinely interested in Muhammads life (as I am as a historian and as a scholar of religion), then I would actually recommend The Life of Muhammad (directed by Faris Kermani). That is much more in-depth, is much more fascinating, and gives one a more comprehensive look at the prophet Muhammads life than this one does.",1512518400,,1050,4.650537634408602
8099030,4,B000CHAYRU,"This is a 42-minute program from A&E's ""Biography"" series. Like the ""Biography"" program on Moses, it isn't a biography precisely. Rather, it's a presentation of the traditional Muslim story of the life of Muhammad, with commentary by scholars who are Muslim or sympathetic to Islam (including two of the usual suspects, Karen Armstrong and John Esposito). The film honors the Muslim tradition of not depicting Muhammad or members of his immediate family.

This program does a good job of bringing the story of Muhammad to life. I've used excerpts from it in teaching classes on world religions.

This program is included as a ""bonus feature"" on the DVD ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Secrets-of-the-Koran/dp/B000FOQ03W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Secrets of the Koran</a>"" (a good history of the Koran and its interpretation).

If you'd like a more detailed version of the story of Muhammad, I'd recommend the movie ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Message/dp/B000AQ6A4E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Message</a>.""",1170115200,,1096,6.544827586206897
