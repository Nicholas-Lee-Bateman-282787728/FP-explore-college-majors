4162571,5,B003OXSRVO,"I can't praise MHZ Network highly enough for FINALLY bringing Varg Veum to the shores of the United States!! Gunnar Staaleson is considered the Raymond Chandler of Norway! The interview and tour of Veum's and Staaleson's Bergen,included in the 6 disc set is NOT to be missed by Euro Crime aficionados! And, YES, it is in English! As for the movies themselves, every one is a suspense filled, dark, noir-like, and VERY, VERY EXCELLENT series of movies NOT TO BE MISSED!! Trond Espen Seim might be a bit younger than the original character in the books, but that can be overlooked because no one but Seim could play Veum! SEIM IS VEUM!! The acting is never over the top nor exaggerated but realistically portrayed by Seim and Bjorn Floberg as his police friend/contact. These movies are so HIGHLY PRAISED in Norway and Europe, that they have won awards! Hopefully,this will stimulate publishers to bring more of Staaleson's novels to America's shores, three of the book series, in English, doesn't even scratch the surface, of Staaleson's massive library of Veum's adventures! Note that these movies would be rated ""R"" here in states. There is quite a lot of realistically portrayed violence, some nudity and sex, but one hell of a roller coaster ride through Varg Veum's world!! THANK YOU MHZ NETWORK AND AMAZON!!",1293321600,22,1312,4.914414414414415
8401743,4,B003OXSRVO,"I really enjoyed this series. I also study Norwegian, so I find myself wishing they'd include subtitles in the language being spoken to help out the learner -- but that's a wish.

It is very well-filmed and well-acted, and has an excellent musical score. I remained interested in every episode, and they definitely have a ""film"" quality feel to them. If you crave lots of color, however, you're in the wrong part of the world.",1442966400,,426,4.68
8401744,5,B003OXSRVO,"Varg Veum is a Norwegian TV crime series about a former child welfare investigator (CPS in the US may be the equivalent), who is now a private PI working for various clients. He often winds up working closely with the local Police Detective (Bjorn Floberg,who treats Varg like a misbehaving little brother). Since Varg can move more freely around legal limits, he is often very helpful to the Police in catching bad guys who would otherwise get away with crime. The cases Varg takes vary from missing persons, environmental terrorism, infidelity, and quite often unsolved murders the Police have given up on. What I like about the character Varg is, he is tough--but he's not a 'bad-ass'. He doesn't fight particularly well, he doesn't carry a gun, he doesn't drive a cool car. But he is tenacious and caring particularly about kids in his work, often fighting for the underdog when others have given up. This show isn't like most US detective shows (Kojak, Banachek) which are great, its 'different' which is also great. Its not worth the current  ridiculous $99 price for a used copy, but when it gets back down to $30 its a great addition to your 'Nordic Noir'",1432512000,,1163,4.757425742574258
8401745,5,B003OXSRVO,"Even if you have to busy yourself reading subtitles, the stories are excellent, well written, well acted, extremely well photographed (a majority of scenes could be converted into some very stunning art displays),  (It is so refreshing to watch something more of the caliper of cinema art instead of the formulaic crime suspense flicks we mostly get here in America)",1386374400,,366,5.1
8401746,4,B003OXSRVO,one of the most attractive antiheroes to come along in a long time. The DVDs are actually better than the books.,1368057600,,112,4.380952380952381
8401747,2,B003OXSRVO,"After watching the full set of the ""Varg Veum"" series, I must say I do agree with the disappointing reviews.  As mentioned, there is a great deal of room for improvement in the script.. and also in some of the performances. But the most disappointing to me was the very uneven translation, full of errors in basic sentence structure, literal and awkward, and with several highly objectionable slurs.  For awhile, I wondered if the translation was trying to be authentic to UK English, or to a character, but ultimately it's just a poor, distracting translation-- so bad, I really wished I could return this series! Watch some of the great Norwegian movies that Amazon offers instead!",1330819200,,683,4.879310344827586
8401748,3,B003OXSRVO,"I purchased this set because it had pretty good reviews. We have enjoyed the Wallander and Maldanado series, so thought we would try another European series. This one we have been disappointed with. He does really dumb things, is apparently not armed, and seems not to have any personal defense skills either. But he does make miraculous (and unexplained) escapes . Not worth the money.",1312761600,3,386,4.953846153846154
8401749,2,B003OXSRVO,"Rather disappointing, uneven ability to tell the story.  For example, there can be too many situations that are not believable.  In one episode, Varg, the PI, is hired by somebody he hasn't seen in years to follow around a possibly wayward wife, but right off the bat our hero seduces her himself.  After that somebody kills her, and our guy is up to his eyebrows in this mess, the cops soon know it, but they keep working with him, allowing him to come and go as he pleases through a series of related crime scenes.  On top of that, a cop who is personally involved as a victim is still working on the case, and then later, after being put on leave, still shows up armed, looking for revenge.  It's never explained why he happens to know where to be at the right time.

The crime details can stretch one's patience.  How does a murderer manage to have enough matching dresses in the right sizes so he can outfit each victim identically?  Would a murderer care?  It's OK if you don't think about it too much, but there are various lapses of this type, and the stories suffer.  The crimes are brutal, yet sometimes the reason for all this mayhem doesn't seem to support the violence.  Also icky: embarrassing moments when the PI announces his brilliant insights as if the cops wouldn't have a clue themselves.

The filming is good, and it's great to see good actors we don't know.  Overall, there's good suspense, too, and I really would have liked to get into these episodes, but unfortunately the scripts needed more work.",1303862400,8,1523,4.534798534798535
8401750,1,B003OXSRVO,"Though not stated by Amazon, the first review by L.K.
Lynch misleads with a strong assertion that said collection is IN ENGLISH.
This was cause for my purchase, only to find it is NOT in English.",1298592000,6,195,4.444444444444445
8401751,5,B003OXSRVO,"Without a doubt, a great series featuring Varg Veum, a former cop now a private investigator.  Varg's singularity, the moodiness of the northern Norway coast and the very twisted, thinking mysteries make for a great show.  One of my best purchases on Amazon.  I only wish
there were more of these shows.  Amazon, Are you listening?",1298419200,17,331,4.857142857142857
8401752,5,B003OXSRVO,"This is a first-rate series -- superbly written, acted, and produced.  The setting of Bergen is fascinating in and of itself -- functioning almost as a separate character and certainly as an effective backdrop for the action.  It's sometimes difficult to imagine a fresh rendering of the old private eye genre, but Varg Veum is a refreshing change of pace.  The characters are many-layered and intriguing and the episodes are intelligent and compelling mysteries.  I can't wait for the next series to become available for the USA format. I give this series my highest recommendation.",1298160000,22,583,5.105263157894737
