8133843,4,B000GPXZ9C,I love this movie but it's not for everyone. If you bleed cross you'll love it too. If you're looking for high energy extreme cycling it's not your thing... Unless extreme mud is your thing... Gotta love cross.,1509667200,,210,4.552631578947368
8133844,5,B000GPXZ9C,Excellent documentary on cyclocross.,1469577600,,36,8.25
8133845,2,B000GPXZ9C,"The video documents a season of cyclocross racing in the United States.  The filmmaker followed the circuit with an 8mm camera, taking footage of numerous races, and documenting the comments of the main participants off-camera while the footage rolls.

Frankly, I found it boring.  The film quality was grainy, by the very nature of 8mm film.  There wasn't really a plot, just a series of comments on how much fun 'cross is, even if it does hurt like hell, and even if the footage was kinda neat, it was basically one long highlight reel, with no plot line or character development.  I ended up donating it to my local bike shop to play on the TV during the day.  That's about the only place it might be appropriate.",1194825600,,716,4.5546875
8133846,5,B000GPXZ9C,"This is the best thing to watch when you're gearing up for cross season or to get your friends into cross. It's beautifully shot, has a great soundtrack and makes you want to go for a ride. I loaned it to my neighbor and he watched it when he was riding the rollers last winter. Just a great film!",1189036800,,297,4.0508474576271185
