8482745,2,B005PW1NRM,Disc labeled as disc 2 was a duplicate of disc 1. This was alao true when I attempted to replace it.,1509753600,,100,3.8095238095238093
8482746,1,B005PW1NRM,"Arrived, but neither disc plays. Waste of money.",1472601600,,48,5.125
8482747,3,B005PW1NRM,"3 times ordered and 3 times product was faulty. It is a 2 disk set, love the tape, but disk 2 is labeled as such, but has disk 1 content again. I believe the seller has a bad batch. Please look into fixing this, the disk is great, but without correct content on both disks, no one will be able to achieve the perfect bum.",1463875200,,321,3.953846153846154
8482748,3,B005PW1NRM,I had the same problem as the other reviewers.  Disc 2 was an exact copy of Disc 1.  What a rip off!,1463529600,,100,3.5

8482750,3,B005PW1NRM,I had the same problem with the discs. Disc 2 said 2 but it was really disc 1. I had really been liking it up until then.,1384041600,3,121,3.5185185185185186
8482751,4,B005PW1NRM,"I liked this video.  It is a twelve week program BUT it comes on 2 disc and I guess I just got a lemon, it had disc 1 on both discs even though it was labeled disc 2, I wonder if anyone else had this problem?  So it was a good program until I couldn't continue with week 7.",1380758400,4,273,3.610169491525424
