6474271,4,B00L8G6PMW,"Based on true events Ryszard Kuklinski, was an intelligence officer in the Polish Army during The Cold War. He gets spotted by the big wigs in the Kremlin and is soon having access to Top Secret documents. This coincides with him having an attack of conscience. This is after the brutal crack down of the Gdansk shipyard workers in 1970.

He then makes an overture to the Americans and they can't believe their luck. What follows is his amazing journey as spy and ally to the West at a rime when nuclear war was a real possibility. This is quite often edge of seat stuff with an authentic cast that do an extremely good job. All the actors are from the countries that they represent, Americans, Russian, Poles etc. The period details all have a high look of authenticity too.

We get the full range of his life and those around him and the travails that they all had to endure. This is a thoughtful production, which was a modest budget affair but has not let its financial confines stifle its artistic endeavours. With a run time of over two hours and very good sub titles this is a film that is easy to recommend.",1427500800,2,1115,4.434146341463415
6474272,5,B00L8G6PMW,"Polish action-spy movie based on actual events from the life of a controversial personality Ryszard Kuklinski (code named Jack Strong).
Kuklinski in the late 1970's and early 1980's was a high ranking military officer in the Polish People's Army during the Polish communist era.
It was also during that time when he started cooperating with the American CIA.  I am not going to dwell on his motives, and if he was right on
betraying Communist Poland (Poland).  My review is strictly for the movie alone.  What is really good about this film, is the international cast and its realistic feel.  Basically, American actors play American agents and speak in English, Polish actors/actresses play their parts and speak in Polish, and Russian actors play Russian agents and speak Russian. For instance, in many movies produced in Hollywood the international cast speaks only one language, which is English, making the movie unrealistic.

Furthermore, Jack Strong (2014) is a high budget action movie for Polish film-making standards, the title role is played by Marcin Dorocinski (a very popular actor in Poland these days) and the American agent or rather Kuklinski's CIA contact is played by Patrick Wilson (whose wife interestingly happens to be a Polish-American actress Dagmara Dominiczyk, who also has a minor role in this production).  The remaining Polish cast features exclusively actors from the top of the list.  Everyone in Poland knows names like: Zamachowski, Baka, Globisz, or Malaszynski.

In terms of the plot, the movie is somewhat reminiscent of the Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy  (2011)/ Argo (2012).  There is lots of dialogue and in between light action scenes, nothing too crazy.  If you are a fan of James Bond films and you like a lot of constant action, adrenaline pumping chase scenes, explosions, fight scenes, etc. this movie is probably not for you.  I would also classify this film as an auto-biography of Ryszard Kulkinski.",1422057600,,1945,5.13968253968254

6474276,4,B00L8G6PMW,"Excellent film depicting the Cold War years between 1972 and 1981 when Ryszard Kuklinski (code name:  Jack Strong) became the most important source of information for U.S. Intelligence on communist Poland and the Warsaw Pact.  This high-ranking Polish officer had become repulsed by the brutality of the communist  crackdown in the 1968 Czech Spring, and the 1970 massacre of Polish workers in Gdansk, and he turned to the West in hopes that the Soviet domination of Poland might be subverted, and the shackles of its political masquerade in Eastern Europe smashed.

Much of his information reached the desks of Presidents Carter and Reagan, and there are scenes in the movie in which Leonid Brezhnev and General Wojciech Jaruzelski express their consternation over the critical intelligence leaks for which Kuklinski was responsible.

John Le Carre couldn't have written a more engaging spy story, and it's profoundly interesting that this courageous Polish patriot is still looked upon by some in Poland [primarily communists of the old regime, but also some leaders of the Solidarity movement, including (sadly) Lech Walesa] as a traitor.  In 1984 he had been sentenced to death in absentia by a Polish communist military court.  His sentence was later reduced to 25 years after the fall of communism, but after pressure from Jimmy Carter's former National Security Advisor, Zbigniew Brzezinski, and the potential threat of a U.S. veto to Poland's entrance into NATO, his conviction was vacated in 1997.

Be that as it may, the acting in this film is first rate, the tensions at home and at ""work"" are vividly portrayed, and the use of the various languages (Polish, Russian and English)--with appropriate subtitles for English-speaking folks--adds to the story's authenticity.  Remember, though, this dvd is ""Region 2"" and requires a multi-region DVD player.

UPDATE (Dec., 2015):  It would appear that an all region (NTSC) dvd is now available, although I would suspect that the new dvd will still contain Polish language dialogue and subtitles.",1412035200,20,2050,5.238532110091743

Crakows were named after the city of Krakw (Cracow), Pol., and they were also known as poulaines (Polish). Crakows were admired on the feet of the courtiers of Anne of Bohemia, who married Richard II of England. The exaggerated toes were imitated even in armour.and how many times in history we saved the western civilization from Polish blood in the front ranks and undergrounds to fight injustices.
It shows what only a few could dare do and the strong pressures of the communist party boots to necks of Proud Polish people that got trapped by the Iron curtain and that was due cause a unwinnable WW III
