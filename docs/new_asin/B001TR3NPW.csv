3793568,2,B001TR3NPW,"Unfortuantely movies like this are all too common. A stupid quasi-pornographic movie that teeters on the edge between real hardcore pornography and mediocre sexploitation. It is just boring. The film drags on. It almost has a plot, but every scene without bare breasts seems to serve as little more than filler. (I meant a little less than filler.)

Emanuelle is a multi-talented woman: a trollop, a harlot, a strumpet, a slut and oh so many other words. She takes photographs of somewhat attractive ladies and works for the newspaper. She goes around the world photographing rich people getting their freak on, in freaky ways of course. She carries around a small voyeur camera inside of a little medallion and snaps shots inside of orgy halls and wherever else.

The movie simply is not that shocking and not that erotic. Needless to say the plot is at best thin, so the audience needs something to tide them over during those one hundred minutes. The directors try to give us porn and shocking filth. But, what it comes down to is that beastiality and fake snuff will not turn most people on and in this day and age, these things are really not that shocking. Of course in 1976 this was kind of hardcore (although sexploitation was obselete after Deepthroat), but today with the internet and mass media the scenes in this movie are hardly shocking.

The filler scenes are at times hilarious. Listening to a senator talk about the virtue of war and sacrifice is one of the most laughable scenes in any movie. You are laughing at the movie though. This movie will not turn you on, it will not really shock you and it will not entertain you. It will for the most part bore you more than a Bresson film (I like Bresson but... they are rather long). If you want to be turned on, then watch a porno, if you want to be shocked then download a video. Emanuelle is merely a time capsule that you don't have to open.",1105056000,3,1909,4.559766763848397
3793569,3,B001TR3NPW,"If Sylvia Kristel had acted in this it probably would have been more entertaining, since she doesn't mind doing a sex scene or two. Laura Gemser, on the other hand, was plenty nude in this film (about every 5 minutes or so), but she has nothing even remotely close to a ""sex scene"". What gives? She gets touchy feely on a few occasions, but nothing special. Maybe that's why they had to call her ""Emanuelle"" with one M, instead of Sylvia Kristel's ""Emmanuelle"", because the extra M means MORE sex.
That's okay, because there was plenty of sex to be had by everyone else, even the horse! Contrary to the review from ""dirk digler"", Laura did not have anything to do with the horse, and nobody had sex with it. Some lady just massaged its genitalia. Big deal.
There is a scene at a party which turns into an explicit pornographic orgy and, later, when Laura is out and about taking pictures of people having sex for some reason, they are all engaged in explicit, real behavior. So that makes up for Laura's lack of ""getting it on"", but her soft-core stuff would've been silly compared to what else was going on, anyway.
Now, the ""snuff"" stuff.....I'll admit, it was quite troubling to watch at first, until I heard in a commentary how the director scratched up some 8mm film he shot the scenes with to make it look grainy and real. His efforts paid off, as far as realism goes. I honestly couldn't tell if it was fake or not at first, until one of the ""victims"" (the torn breast girl) didn't quite convince me that she was being tormented. But the meathook? How could you fake that? Even if it is fake, it still is creepy to watch. Definitely effective cinema, if nothing else.",1063670400,35,1674,4.473856209150327
3793570,5,B001TR3NPW,That's awesome how Emmanuelle jacks off the horse then turns around and takes it in the rear!  Next time I get near a farm I'm gonna do the same thing!,1062460800,17,151,4.033333333333333
3793571,4,B001TR3NPW,"Sleaze director Aristide Massaccesi (a.k.a Joe D'Amato) died suddenly of a heart attack in 1999, the unfortunate culmination of a long career as the creator of numerous low budget horror and soft-core sex films. Among horror fans, D'Amato's seminal contributions to the genre include the taboo busting 1981 film Anthropophagus and the ultra gory 1977 classic Buio Omega. Joe's films crossed the borders of bad taste as often as they mixed gluey gore with sexual themes. It is perhaps this movie, ""Emanuelle in America,"" that best personified the basic premise of a Joe D'Amato film. Lovingly reconstituted by Blue Underground, a new DVD company specializing in underground cinema, this Laura Gemser vehicle was the first of a string of Emanuelle films helmed by D'Amato. It was also the beginning of a long collaboration between D'Amato and Gemser that eventually ended with the Indonesian actress's retirement in the mid 1990s. We'll never see a new Joe D'Amato film, but with the advent of DVD fans will finally see excellent versions of all of his old classics. Up until a few years ago, many of us acquired grainy third or fourth generation dupes in order to view any film from Joe D'Amato. Those days are now over.
In ""Emanuelle in America,"" Indonesian actress Laura Gemser plays Emanuelle, a newspaper journalist who roams the world in search of offbeat stories. There really isn't much to the plot here, with Emanuelle embarking on trips to Italy, the Caribbean, Washington, D.C., and Latin America. In each of these places, she uncovers various sexual situations ranging from a brothel controlled by a crime boss to degenerate nobility in Venice to a ""dating service"" in the Caribbean. The final adventure sees Emanuelle searching for the makers of grotesque snuff films. The movie concludes with little resolution in a tropical paradise where Emanuelle and her boyfriend encounter a native tribe and a mysterious ""film set"" (?) before running off into the sunset. Predictably, the acting is terrible, the dialogue laughable (I rolled my eyes at least four times), and the plot fails to achieve any sort of continuity. I know the whole idea of the Emanuelle films involved exotic locales mixed with cheesy soft-core erotica, but I'm willing to bet several other entries in the franchise possessed a better sense of wholeness than this one did. Moreover, the nudity and inserted hardcore scenes (yes, there is hardcore in this movie) didn't really do anything for me. Maybe it's because this is the 1970s and all of the women look rough. Whatever it was, I just didn't find ""Emanuelle in America"" all that erotic.
There are many intriguing elements to this film once you look past its flaws. Several music pieces, especially noticeable during the pool scene, were downright excellent. They had a sort of new age/Pink Floyd sound to them. I also thought the cigarette pack table/bar was cool. But it is D'Amato's taboo busting scenes that really take the cake here. First, there is a scene with a horse that is, well, controversial. That scene is here in its full nauseating glory. As if this isn't enough to float your boat, there's the snuff film segments. Employing stomach churning gore effects, D'Amato doctored up these sequences by scratching the film, using quick cuts, and employing jumping frame techniques to make the snuff footage look like the real thing. It is gruesome, even more so by its association with intimate relationships. On an unrelated note, I thought that the guy who pulled the gun on Emanuelle in the beginning of the movie was none other than actor Maxwell Caulfield (best known for his role in ""Grease 2""). Upon further investigation, I can't confirm that it is actually Caulfield, but it sure looks like him.
The extras on this disc are simply marvelous. You get a thirteen minute interview with Joe D'Amato made shortly before his death, an audio interview with Laura Gemser, and background on the Emmanuelle phenomena (D'Amato and others changed the spelling of Emmanuelle to ""Emanuelle"" in order to avoid copyright problems), a franchise which ran for decades throughout Europe and America. The best extras on the DVD are the talent bios for D'Amato and Gemser. These two biographies deeply explore the careers of these two underground favorites. Any information on D'Amato is always welcome, and the bio here does a good job constructing a partial filmography of this busy director. Interspersed throughout the bios are movie posters for various cult films made by Gemser and D'Amato.
It's amazing how great the film looks on DVD. It is obvious that the technicians pieced in several scenes in order to present an uncut version of the film, but overall the picture looks splendid. I hope the release of ""Emanuelle in America"" signals a growing movement to release even more D'Amato works in the near future. ""Troll 2,"" a D'Amato classic not to be missed by anyone with a love for ""so bad they're good"" movies is due to appear soon. If new uncut versions of Anthropophagus and Anthropophagus 2 followed, I would truly be happy. For those new to the Joe D'Amato catalogue, ""Emanuelle in America"" is a good place to start. This movie isn't great, but it is an important contribution to underground cinema.",1062028800,66,5244,4.973804100227791
3793572,5,B001TR3NPW,"This, the most infamous film in the Emmanuelle series, will not be for people who have enjoyed the previous erotic entries.  This is the polar opposite of those films.  All sex is forced, coerced, paid for and/or violent.  This is far from a couples' film.
D'Amato also steps into the real of ultra-violence with some great fake snuff films.  Unnervingly real, though the angles and format seems to be lifted directly from the courtyard scene is Passolini's Salo.
Laura Gemser is a pure sex symbol who, when placed in the world D'Amato has created, becomes as unappealing as all the violence around her.  Any eroticism she delivers is immediately displaced by either the background, violence, or an ingratiating soundtrack.
Not for those looking for a hot sex film, but for those who want to see just how far they can step over the line in their cinematic tastes.",1060128000,7,863,4.804054054054054
3793573,5,B001TR3NPW,"This has to be one of the best exploitation films ever made, completely going beyond all sense of taste and decorum. Joe D'Amato does a brilliant job in showing us some of the most deprived and hard-core sequences in film history.
The bit where the girl is masterbating the horse is an absolute classic. You literally can't believe what you're seeing!
Definitely a collector's item in every sense and no doubt soon to be withdrawn/banned, get this while you still can - especially with the excellent extras on the disc.
You might be disgusted, but you won't be disappointed!",1058400000,6,574,4.808080808080808
3793574,1,B001TR3NPW,"I bought this DVD because I had read about the film and because Blue Underground has been doing a great job in selecting their releases. I haven't had such a negative reaction to a film in ages. I had no problem with the X-rated sex scenes and the bestiality sequence was something I've never seen before so that was kind of educational. My problem was with the snuff film sequence.
I'm an old gorehound and I don't shy away from this kind of material but I feel context is very important when watching good gore. I like people and I don't want them to be eaten by Zombies so when I watch say Dawn Of The Dead I want to be horrified by scenes of carnage and I want the director to tell me I should be horrified.
The problem with the gore in this movie is that its context is to serve as sexual titillation. Intercutting scenes of Laura Gemser having sex while looking through a window into the torture room with scenes of women being very realistically mutilated is way to perverse for me. I'm sure that about 50% of the people who read this review will be even more likely to purchase it now but for people like me who will feel ""soiled"" after viewing this, you've been warned.
My disk also arrived scratched up do to a very crappy box with sharp edges on the ""button"". Since I threw out my copy immediately after viewing it this wasn't an issue but since this will no doubt become a major collectors item after the government bans it you may have trouble getting a mint copy through [Amazon.com]",1057190400,20,1497,4.35
3793575,4,B001TR3NPW,"This is one of the most brutal sex exploitation films ever made. Emanuelle in America not only exploits the beauty of a naked woman, it also contains bestiality (woman with a horse) and a projected snuff film that appear very real. The sex scenes appear real and there are scenes of graphic penetrations near the end of the film. Although the story is simple (about a woman photographer looking for something controversial), it is the graphic sex scenes that make this a unique and maybe irresponsible film.
The DVD image is terrific considering that this was a film in the 70's. The sound is satisfactory. I think Blue Underground really did a great job--as usual.
I would recommend this film to collectors of erotic cinema.",1056499200,23,725,4.808

3793578,3,B001TR3NPW,"Finally took an opportunity to order this material, after reading about it for YEARS in genre magazines. This is one heck of a BIZARRE movie, presenting an odd mix of awkwardly filmed sex scenes interjected with occasional flashes of extreme and mind-bending GORE. Film lead Laura Gemser gives an energetic (if confused) performance in a film that has her playing a jet-setting photographer who seems to uncover a strange SNUFF film network. While Gemser seems to have the goods to carry a film lead, the decision to take the EMANUELLE series from a classy, dreamlike series of adult vignettes and turn it into a odd collection of porn and gore scenarios really does a mind-zap for any reasonably well-adjusted film devote. Can't say I recommend this film to anyone, except as on odd period curiosity. However, the supplemental material provided, which looks back at the Emanuelle film series, as well as interviews the director and star of the later BLACK  EMANUELLE titles, is worth the price of the disc alone. Overall, a very high quality package that will probably leave you unsettled and a bit disillusioned about mankind.",1419638400,2,1128,5.0

Most of scenes are very unusual in choice and, to add to it, we are shown different cities, streets, landscapes etc. The producer, Joe D'Amato is not my favored but he manages produce better flick than most studios with big budgets half a century later. I guess mainstream never learn and never will. Highly recommended!",1375574400,,498,4.735632183908046
3793582,5,B001TR3NPW,"This film is extremely sleazy at times, (a near sex scene with a woman fondling a horse is an example) but it has excellent scenery, some fantastic soundtracks, a happy atmospheric type quality, and Joe D' Amato's direction is superb.  The full frontal explicit nudity is abundant, and Laura Gemser looks great here and has plenty of explicit full frontal nude scenes; and many other attractive women get fully nude.  Although most of the nudity is softcore, there's some hardcore inserts; but none of these are with Gemser, even though the women who do participate in these scenes look good.  The film is mostly an explicit erotic film with some extremely disturbing snuff film scenes shown later on; the gore effects and acting in these scenes are extremely realistic and disturbing.  Because the overwhelming majority of the film is so erotic, the viewer might be unprepared for how horrifying these scenes are. Most of the film presents a lively and peaceful atmosphere with sunny days, uplifting music, and attractive locations as Gemser encounters assorted erotic adventures. Later, these joyful adventures are interrupted when Gemser begins to discover the existence of real snuff films. The discovery of these films and their content is in complete contrast to the large majority of the film that presents a soothing quality with explicit sex sequences and nudity in attractive locations that are accompanied by peaceful musical scores.  The films pace is also fast and the replay value is great.  I've had this DVD for awhile, and it never gets boring.

The DVD looks great, but it does have some grain.",1357171200,,1612,5.037593984962406
3793583,5,B001TR3NPW,This is the best of it's kind.  Just the right amount of sex mixed with a plot that makes sense.  Interesting and taboo at the same time.

Other movies with this actress that came later were much more tame.,1316390400,3,372,3.972972972972973
3793584,1,B001TR3NPW,"<strong>Emanuelle in America</strong> (Joe D'Amato, 1977)

Aristide Massaccesi, better known as Joe D'Amato, directed nearly two hundred movies in a career that spanned over a quarter-century before his death in 1999. Like most exploitation film directors, D'Amato dabbled in just about every genre you can think of, from hardcore (<em>Porno Holocaust</em>, viz. review 23Jun10) to historical drama (a weird hardcore retelling of the bio of Marco Polo). But the movies that have made D'Amato a household name, as much as he could ever be one, are the movies he did in the Emanuelle series. After Bitto Albertini introduced the world to the new Emanuelle, Laura Gemser, in 1975's <em>Emanuelle Nera</em>, Gemser became something of a phenomenon, and the late seventies saw a flood of Emanuelle films starring Gemser. D'Amato made four of those over the course of 1976-77, having probably gotten the job because he'd directed one of the pre-Gemser Emanuelle flicks (<em>Emanuelle e Francoise le Sorelline</em>, with Rosemarie Lindt as everyone's favorite bad girl). They were so popular that, eventually, other, later flicks Gemser and D'Amato teamed up for were re-released under the Emanuelle banner, despite having nothing at all to do with the series. <em>Emanuelle in America</em> was the second of the ""canonical"" films D'Amato and Gemser worked on together, and it lives in a very, very strange place. D'Amato was still trying to figure out how to shoehorn a plot into these to make himself seem vaguely respectable, but wanted to get in as much of his background in/obsession with roughies and what we would call today torture porn, though D'Amato would laugh at today's efforts; after all, he grew out of the same school that birthed Ruggero Deodato, maker of the notorious <em>Cannibal Holocaust</em>, and Umberto Lenzi, maker of the even more notorious <em>Cannibal Ferox</em> (aka <em>Make Them Die Slowly</em>). The term ""torture porn"" takes on a whole new meaning in a movie like this--and fans of the last few unwatchable Saw movies could probably learn a thing or two about discomfort from watching it. But, that said, it's still a Joe D'Amato movie, and so some of the glimmers of what might have been a halfway decent exploitation film (with a few random hardcore scenes thrown in, presumably for the sole purpose of pissing the censors off; it's not a hardcore film for most of its hundred-minute length) were, not surprisingly, stomped out as fast as they appeared.

Plot: well, there's not really a plot per se; there are three episodes linked only by Emanuelle (Gemser, at the height of her beauty here) and her boyfriend Bill (<em>Swept Away</em>'s Riccardo Salvino), a pair of investigative journalists engaged in friendly competition when not otherwise engaged between the sheets. In the episodes, Emanuelle goes undercover first to expose an arms-smuggling baron, then to document the shenanigans at a very private resort for rich women, and finally to expose a seedy undercover world of sexual torture and snuff films being made in a backwater South American jungle. (Oddly, despite the movie's title--Emanuelle is supposed to be from New York--all three of these episodes send her overseas, to England, South Africa, and South America.) All three have the same basic idea--Emanuelle spends a lot of time unclothed, in the presence of many other unclothed people, and takes surreptitious photographs with the camera hidden in her necklace when she's not making out with some other beautiful creature.

What is there to say that hasn't already been said about the Emanuelle movies? Turns out that in this case, there could have been something. Little bits of interesting storylines spring up, but are squashed as quickly as possible in service of the overall plot; D'Amato wanted to make sure the sex kept flowing, rather than developing character depth, theme, or anything else that might have made the movie worth a rewatch. And lord knows there were opportunities. There is nothing at all to recommend it, aside from the obvious. For Gemser collectors only (as I can't imagine there is such a beat as the Joe D'Amato collector.) (half)",1307664000,,4162,5.153846153846154
3793585,5,B001TR3NPW,This is one of the best Emanuelle movies. If you want to see the really good Emanuelle films get the ones that star Laura Gemser. She doesn't in any of them but her co-stars do and it makes up for it. So I really recommend any Emanuelle fan to buy this movie you won't be sorry and is the one of the best.,1297209600,,305,3.857142857142857
3793586,4,B001TR3NPW,"In the 1970's, soft core erotica was the rage in Italy and Europe and the toast of the town was Joe D'mato with his Emanuelle series.

While many women have played the role of that sensual, sexual goddess, Laura Gemser's run seems to get the most attention as she's the only non-white (that I am aware of) that has ever played the role and is actually true to the woman who wrote the original Emanuelle stories as she was Eurasian as was Gemser.

As for this entry, we see Emanuelle playing a reporter and using both her brains and beauty to get in and out of situations. Of all the movies, this one has the most controversial scenes which are rarely seen in the U.S. Particulary showing one of the females participating in beastiality with a horse! Furthermore, the horse seems to be loving it!

The other is showing various couples engaging in sex where the actual acts are being show including oral and penetration! Only Gemser herself didn't participate in the hardcore type of sex as her scenes were kept sensual but stimulated.

In terms of acting and story, it was a step up or two from the usual fare. I would dare say, this was probably the best acted of all the Emanuelle films that Gemser did during this time.

Highly recommended if you are an Emanuelle fan and particularly of Laura Gemser's run as the character! For me personally, the beastial scene was a bit much and could've lived without that! Ugh!

3793588,4,B001TR3NPW,"Laura Gemser had that certain something - a natural, organic sensuality and a comfort level while doing nude scenes that I don`t recall in any other actress of her day (that weren`t doing hard-core). She never dressed provocatively, never wore a lot of makeup, never looked trashy, yet radiated something mesmerizing that had an ability to turn heads of most men anywhere. This film showcases her at her finest, and it`s one of Joe D'Amato's best films. I know that's not saying much but, trust me, it`s speaking volumes about this film. There`s almost nothing sleazy here, except maybe Pedro the horse getting his carrot whacked, but I`m thinking he wasn`t objecting much. It's one of the few times when an exploitation film transcends its genre and becomes something else, but doesn't fail to deliver the goods more than adequately to its core audience. Gemser is an investigative photojournalist with a fearless thirst for adventure and an insatiable erotic hunger. This time she uncovers evidence of an international 'snuff' film conspiracy (rumors of which were abundant back in those days), and travels the seedy streets of New York City to the corrupt confines of Washington D.C. to expose her story and herself along the way. This film is an absolute must-have for fans of 70`s grindhouse/sex+exploitation/Eurosleaze/cult film enthusiasts, and I recommend it as much as inhaling and exhaling regularly.",1272153600,6,1410,5.1615720524017465

The stunning Laura Gemser stars as Emanuelle, the fearless fashion photographer and investigative photojournalist whose thirst for adventure is matched only by her insatiable erotic hunger. But when Emanuelle uncovers shocking evidence of an international snuff film conspiracy, she is plunged into an odyssey of forbidden passion, depraved desires and unspeakable human brutality.

From the lust-filled streets of New York City to the corrupt corridors of Washington D.C. and beyond, one of the most controversial sex and gore epics in exploitation history has finally come home.

Joe D'Amato (Aristide Massaccesi) was born on December 15, 1936, in Rome and died in Rome, Italy because of a heart attack. The last film that D'Amato was working on befoe his death, was a movie called ""PLANKTON"" (1995). That was supposed to be about a group of young divers that become infected with a 'virus' which results in rape and bloody mayhem the way only Joe can do it.

EMANUELLE IN AMERICA! The jaw-dropping cult classic, that features graphic sex, harrowing violence, a horse named Pedro and much, much more. Directed by the notorious Joe D'Amato (BEYOND THE DARKNESS), EMANUELLE IN AMERICA has been newly mastered from pristine vault materials and is now presented completely uncut for the first time ever!

3793592,5,B001TR3NPW,"I have watched the movie a couple of times. Once over a year ago, and once a couple of weeks ago. The first time I had no idea what to expect, so it really shocked the hell out of me. I was watching it on an old big screen, so the picture wasn't real clear (even though it was a dvd). It still took over a week to get over the imagery which combined with the soundtrack was almost the stuff nightmares are made of.

You may think I am exaggerating. A couple of weeks ago I decided to try it again. I mean I had just gotten a beatiful new tv to watch my classic horror films on. I figured I would watch them again to see what could stand the test of time.

Before I get to my point let me recommend Lucio Fulci's Conquest. I mean if you want a movie that is full of hidden truths and symbolism that will stay with you a long time, watch this late with a loud surround sound system.

Back to America. The first time I watched it I didn't really understand what the point of the movie was. This is because the point is not really revealed until the end.

I am kind of morbid. For instance when I watch shockumentaries, I tend to sit there and freeze the frames, going back and forth in slow motion, frame by frame. It gives me a really intimate experience of the psychology involved.

Once I was watching a documentary that showed a US military plane explode in mid air. I paused it and started moving frame by frame to watch it explode. Amazingly, at the last frame before combustion there suddenly appeared two mysterious sets of lights directly behind the poor [...] I mean, whatever blew him out of the sky was invisible to the naked eye, except for that one still frame!

What am I getting at? Well as I watched America again (I had been putting it off for a while, because I know what happened the last time I saw it) I began to see that there was only one point that the directors were making. Since I had a much clearer TV picture this time, I ended up spending over an hour more than the movie length, examining the footage, frame by frame.

3793594,3,B001TR3NPW,"I have probably watched, under duress I might add, about a dozen Emmanuelle/Emanuelle movies, out the approximately two dozen or so available movies, (talk about sequels) so for those of you not familiar, a little background is in order. After seeing so many of these movies, I have come to the conclusion that name Emmanuelle means beautiful nymph in French. It is obvious because, in each of these movies, the only common denominator is a gorgeous woman of the world, who sleeps around, a lot.

Ok, I was kidding. The movies have a couple other common denominators, lousy plots and plenty T & A, so it is obvious that these movies were made for one reason and one reason only (other than to make money), to turn people, including me, on, so if you're looking for brainfood you have mistakenly pushed the eye candy button.

Now I know you are all dying to know why I said Emmanuelle/Emanuelle. Can you guess? I'll give you a hint. Franco/Italio. Get it? What have I got to do? Draw you a picture. The first Emmanuelle movies were made in France and it took two years to get over the Alps to Italy and when it did they said `mama mia buenvideo' or something like, that and started making Emanuelle movies, which means in Italian - beautiful fallen angel. As you have now, probably figured out, Emanuelle in America is of the Italio, fallen angel persuasion.

Emanuelle in America

As I said, I have probably viewed a dozen or so of these movies but Emanuelle in America was truly a surprise for me. There were parts in this film that made even me, blush. I didn't say I closed my eyes or turned my head. I blushed. In fact, I grabbed the remote and went over the parts that made me blush so I could blush a few more times.

####WARNING####

If you are the kind of person who doesn't like to read about SEX and are easily embarassed or offended and wish you hadn`t started reading this crazy review about this crazy movie, I understand, I'm the same way, sort of, so go with my blessing and I'll say a prayer for you and review a Disney movie in the future.

Back to the diehards. Emanuelle in America is one kinky, MF (morbid flick) which is not surprising since it was directed by Joe D'Amato, who is notorious for sex and gore.

PLOT

In this movie, Emanuelle (Laura Gemser), is a ""fashion photographer"" (of fashionable nude women), photo journalist, investigative reporter (both undercover and above cover) and any other thing you can think of. After a preliminary scene where Emanuelle goes down on some guy with a gun that wants to kill her, she goes off to join some millionaire's zodiac conceived concubine (Emanuelle`s a Virgo). After bedding his right hand man, an interlude with two other naked girls in the pool and a lesbian scene in a sauna we are treated to a scene where a naked lady masturbates a horse. No really, I'm not kidding. While this is going on, Emanuelle is ostensibly taking voyeuristic photos with a miniature camera, embedded in a bracelet.

After she makes her getaway from the millionaire's California compound, Emanuelle hooks up with a Duke? From Venice (Italy) who invites her the annual wingding he and his wife throw. After a manage a trios with the Duke and Duchess we have the shindig, which turns into a big orgy and of course our heroine is walking around the naked bodies, again taking pictures with the little camera, this time mounted in a tasteless costume jewelry necklace with an extra long chain, which is so obvious she may as well blurt out, ""Hey, You mind if I take some fu*king pictures"". Here we get our first glimpse of hardcore as a woman performs fellatio.

Next our liberated mostly undercover trollop is off to a Caribbean island she heard about at the orgy, where the services of well endowed men (studs) are available (for sale) to wealthy women. The movie continues with her viewing and photographing more graphic sex, with her poorly hidden camera and even an investigation into the source of some snuff film footage, of which I will not go into.

What's good

~ As usual Laura Gemser was lovely, though when she was fully dressed, her clothes seemed overly large on her. She must be tiny.

~ I must admit that I was intrigued rather than turned, off by the hardcore scenes. I was caught totally off guard, having never seen them in previous Emmanuelle/Emanuelle movies.

~ There was lots of nudity but except for Emanuelle with her Barbie Doll figure and the anatomically pleasing Duchess, few were exceptionally attractive.

What`s not

~ Although Miss Gemser is shown entering into numerous intimate scenes, they all cut away before anything beside preliminaries are shown, (exception, the lesbian scenes).

~ For a professional undercover investigative photographer, Emanuelle was certainly obvious with her supposedly surreptitious photography, nor was her camera well hidden.

~ I may be wrong but some of the explicit sexual scenes in the movie looked, to me, like they were borrowed from other films. Oh well, who cares?

~ The story was weak and the ending was terrible but I'd watch it again!

~ In the scene where the kid had a gun to Emanuelle's head, she didn't appear to be the least bit nervous, let alone scared. Well, it was a bit laughable.

~ In fact, I guess you would have to say that overall the acting was weak but then who watches these movies for the acting.

~ Some of the cinematography and editing seemed weak as well. That means it looked like your home movies. (The quality not the subject matter)

CONCLUSION

When it comes to this version of Emanuelle, all you have to remember is Laura Gemser. For one hundred minutes we see Laura Gemser traipsing around the world mostly in profile. Now Gemser is a Eurasian beauty, no doubt, but not in profile. She, like another beauty, Heather Locklear do not photograph that well in profile. They kind of look like somebody stole the tip of their nose.

I must admit to some ambivalence regarding this film. On the one hand the film was fascinating, wondering what new kinky perversion D'Amato was going to throw at you next, as he pushed the envelope of decency, by tackling subjects that were taboo in polite society. Overall I enjoyed the film despite numerous flaws, so I'm not sure how I should rate it. I guess I'll play it safe and rate it in the middle, 3 stars.

PS. This film is not recommended for children under the age of thirty-five!",1127088000,7,6380,4.632978723404255

3793596,4,B001TR3NPW,Emanuelle in America is a must have for any serious exploitation film collection.  The film has it's flaws mainly due to a non-smooth running plot.  But it is a jem to be discovered if only for the outstanding snuff footage at the end.  The special effects team headed by g de Rossi have done an outstanding job of bringing the snuff myth to the screen.  I would like to know what one of the reveiwers is downloading when they state that such material is available over the internet. You need to collect that reward from Al Goldstein as no true snuff film has ever seen the light of day and is generally considered to be a social myth. Most people who state they have seen one generally have seen the aforementioned footage or a copy of Cannibal Holocaust.  Joe D'mato was a very accomplished camera man who new how to make money.  Emannuelle in America was the film which pushed the envelope at the time not in terms of sex but violence and has a very important place in exploitation history.  If you like predictable Hollywood fare avoid. Also check out D'mato's Anthropophagus(cut in America as the Grim Reaper there is an uncut German disc)and also Beyond the Darkness. Joe also made some excellent costume XXX. Well worth a look. PS They dropped the M from Emannuelle for legal reasons to disassociate from Sylvia Kristal;s movies.,1106697600,4,1336,4.635593220338983

EMANUELLE IN AMERICA is one of the most disturbing opus of this Italian sub-genre, and perhaps the best Joe d'Amato movie. Very good transfer and excellent extras. The crazy thing : this film is an Italian-French coproduction, but impossible to find it in France : Studio Canal, owner of the rights, is afraid to compete with the official Emmanuelle series with Sylvia Kristel, another of their properties.

8342287,4,B001TR3NPW,"I saw this film again yesterday evening on a Beta VCR (true period atmosphere) and enjoyed it as never before: a trash masterpiece that reflects the mid-70s in its plot, characters, shedding of inhibitions and clothes. Even the theme song is uniquely enjoyable. Laura Gemser plays a hedonistic investigative journalist who goes ""undercover"" to embed (literally) herself in vice, orgies and politics in various geographical locales. Her activities include researching ""snuff films,"" an urban myth believed in  by many at the time. Though the film's narrative structure would embarrass a second-year film student, this somehow adds to its appeal, as does Gemser clothed and not. Speaking of which: there are numerous attractive female shapes in the film, all with natural figures and fur - rare nowadays. A good example of a film and ""filmmaking"" that could never claim to be art and wouldn't want to.",1489622400,,899,5.2

8342291,5,B001TR3NPW,"This is an awesome addition to my collection.  I had forgotten just how beautiful the scenery and sets are, and how delicious Laura Gemser looks whether she's nude or not.  Definitely one of the two best of her Emanuelle (note the different spelling from the original Emmanuelle trilogy with Sylvia) movies, the other being Emanuelle Around The World.  I love the period, the quality of the film, and the nostalgia value.

Of course the other reason I rate this and Around The World as the best, is thanks to the hard core scenes.  Yes, I'm aware that one can see such material elsewhere, but it's not just how explicit but also production quality and context that makes it exciting.  There was not as much here, since it is just one simulated orgy scene that does have some explicit fellatio and then one other scene that has explicit fellatio and intercourse, but what there is to see, is worth it.  The bestial scene is explicit but not - basically stroking a horse but it's not very long (the scene, not the horse) and if you could call such a scene tender, well it is as much as that's possible.  The scene I really can do without (which I didn't watch again but I assume it's still on here) is the scene of violence toward the end.",1423180800,5,1237,4.466666666666667
