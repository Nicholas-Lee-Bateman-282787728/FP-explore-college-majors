2208262,1,B0007CEXRM,I WAS A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED IN THE LENGTH OF THE MOVIE.  IT WAS OVER ALMOST BEFORE THE MOVIE GOT STARTED INTO THE PLOT.  I DO THINK THAT CHILDREN WILL LIKE IT THOUGH.,1193270400,2,166,4.15625
2208263,1,B0007CEXRM,"This ""movie"" is only 48 minutes long.  Made in 1986, it was obviously a one-TV-hour show.  See it only if you're a fan of one of the performers.

This gets my vote for the worst Christmas movie ever made and one of the worst movies ever made.  The acting by Katherine Helmond is the phoniest I remember ever seeing.  It's astounding to watch, it's so bad.  You just keep gaping: how can anybody be that bad?

The little girl, Melissa Hart, is very cute.  I hope she got the parts she deserves.

The story is the length of a short-short, so there's a lot of treading water in this show.  The gratuitous nastiness to the woman customer who had traveled all the way across town in the snow was stunning.  The fact that the little girl did not tell her adoptive mother about the footprints after they'd all been searching for the man all day is not credible.

Bottom line: if you buy this movie, you get what you deserve.",1171497600,16,917,4.329411764705882

2208267,5,B0007CEXRM,"I am just a sap for sweet, predictable movies, especially Christmas ones. A good movie to watch with your kids.",1386374400,,111,4.6
2208268,4,B0007CEXRM,Nice little  story ...for a lazy afternoon...great to watch with kids or Grandkids. Great price for a movie that will become a family tradition .,1379116800,,145,4.8
2208269,4,B0007CEXRM,"The Christmas Snow bought back fond memories, I'd read the short story and the show was faithful to the bookThe acting was beleivable and uit was an excellent Christ,mas show, something that fits beautifully with the season .",1359936000,,225,4.947368421052632
2208270,2,B0007CEXRM,A lot of eye rolling and groaning with the acting and storyline.  But you have to understand that this was made 30 years ago.,1359676800,,125,4.208333333333333
2208271,5,B0007CEXRM,Received this after Christmas - enjoyed it anyway!  Great to watch with the family or friends. This will leave the viewer with a smile and good memories.,1357603200,,153,4.666666666666667
2208272,4,B0007CEXRM,"I love this heartwarming movie.  Each holiday season, I have brought out my old VHS copy which shows signs of age.  And now I have my own DVD.  The actors are superb.  This movie demonstates the true spirit of Christmas, as ""Ma"" declares ""if we don't save Mr. Schneider, we will lose Christmas!""",1326326400,,295,4.509433962264151
2208273,1,B0007CEXRM,"This was the worse Christmas movie I have ever seen.  I counted on other reviewers, but they let me down.  Most of the reviews were so positive and I am a movie buff, also a Christmas movie collector.  I doubt I will ever watch it again.  The best thing I can say about this movie is it is short.",1312243200,,296,3.9661016949152543
2208274,5,B0007CEXRM,"This was a delightful movie that we had recorded off of tv back in the 80's.  So glad to see it came out on dvd.  I think this is a charming little tale that is safe to watch with your children, no bad language, nudity or violence.  That is hard to come by now a days.  Takes you back to a time when shows were much more wholesome.",1294012800,,331,3.823529411764706
2208275,5,B0007CEXRM,"Purchased for viewing during Christmas, arrived quickly and in good shape, enjoyed the film which was fairly old and somehow missed by me during the times it was released, I suspect a made for T.V. Movie when it was released..

It has a good story line and delivers a message as well..",1293667200,,285,4.480769230769231
2208276,5,B0007CEXRM,"I recorded this movie on VHS when it first aired. The family watches it every year. It is one of those movies that we have to watch as part of our traditional movie schedule. My tape is worn out so will be looking to purchase a copy, I want it on DVD.",1292198400,,251,3.8461538461538463
2208277,5,B0007CEXRM,This is a short warm christmas story. I love it. It's about two adopted children wishing for snow and a candy lady who adopted them trying to save her house from becoming a laundrymat. Very good.,1291334400,,195,4.444444444444445
2208278,3,B0007CEXRM,An old fashioned sweet Christmas movie.  Excellent to show to early middle schoolers who are learning English as a foreign langage. Not for young people who are looking for wild adventures.,1266105600,,189,5.096774193548387
2208279,2,B0007CEXRM,"Even if you like corny, sentimental Christmas stories (and I do), this one is too much.  Katherine Helmond is a competent actress, but  Sid Caesar, as an actor... well he should stick to comedy.

Poor overall story line and characters are SO sweet, if you're over the age of 8 they'll make your teeth ache.

Includes a free music CD that I haven't even bothered to listen to.  I already have Christmas music with artists I enjoy, so this was no bonus for me.

Sorry, but even with its low price, I recommend you give this a pass.",1265068800,,529,4.346938775510204
2208280,3,B0007CEXRM,This movie was cute. It isn't something that I would watch more than once or twice.,1264809600,,83,4.25
2208281,1,B0007CEXRM,Bad acting and a ridiculous plot. Within 10 minutes you could see what was going on and how it would end. Fortunately it was not a long movie and I had time to prepare this thing for a quick visit to a yard sale. BAD movie,1264809600,,222,3.847826086956522
2208282,5,B0007CEXRM,"I truly LOVED this DVD, it was wonderful to get back to what christmas is all about, and this is a wonderful family DVD, with some beautiful scenes, i watched it 3 times in a row, and my family watched it with me, and they all loved it!",1262131200,4,236,3.9375
2208283,3,B0007CEXRM,"I found this DVD at Kmart for $3. It comes with a cd of Christmas music. I figured for the price I would take a chance.
It was a made for TV movie from 1986 based on the novelette ""London Snow"". It stars Katherine Helmond, veteran actor Sid Caesar, a very young Melissa Joan Hart, and Kimble Joyner. It won an Emmy in 1987 for cinematography and an ASC award in 1988. It's a nice family movie, but it's only 48 minutes long.

The movie seems to be set in the 1950's. Mrs Mutterance (Helmond)is a widow who runs a candy shop in the lower level of a building where she lives on the 2nd floor with her 2 adopted children (Joyner and Hart). Her mean spirited Landlord, Mr Snyder(Caesar)tells her she has two weeks to vacate the building 2 days before Christmas. After a blizzard, Mr. Snyder turns up missing. Will Mrs. Mutterance be able to find him?

Melissa Joan Hart is very cute in this movie. I thought all of the actors were good, but I thought this presentation fell short of a holiday classic. I think it is a better production than the made for tv movies are today. Well worth the $3 I paid for it.",1260576000,7,1103,4.247619047619048
2208284,2,B0007CEXRM,I love Christmas but this movie will be one that I watch once.  Not a very good movie at all.,1231718400,,93,3.65
2208285,5,B0007CEXRM,Excellent short story and great mini movie. I haven't noticed it on TV in recent years and wanted to purchase it on DVD (my VHS tape wore out). Great for the entire family with a worthy lesson. It's an annual must at our house for Christmas.,1228435200,19,241,4.260869565217392

8046679,5,B0007CEXRM,"One of my perennial favorites, we watch it every Christmas season.  Katherine Helmond is so wonderfully quirky - I love her in everything she does.  Sid Caesar is great as well.  The kid playing Wallace tends to go OTT but it's forgivable.  This is a heartwarming redemption story akin to Scrooge, great writing and direction.",1450656000,,326,4.872727272727273

I'll give it credit for not reworking holiday cliches, but that's about it. The production values are spotty, the script is mawkish, and the plot painfully unexceptional.",1419552000,,312,5.137254901960785
