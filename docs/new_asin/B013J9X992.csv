8727947,4,B013J9X992,"Yes, these are imports. That means they are REGION 2 Blu-rays. That also means in this case NO ENGLISH AUDIO OR SUBTITLES. I have purchased German Shaw Brothers releases before that did have English subtitles, These do not. They have only German subtitles and only German and Mandarin audio. Also, the packaging is a bit ackward. You have to slide the discs out of the hard plastic slots carefully to avoid damage. That's the main reason for the 4 stars. The movies themselves are excellent, and I knew I was taking a chance buying German imports so I cannot blame the seller for the subtitle situation.

Also, here is a list of the movies included: (most of these can as of May 2017, be purchased or rented from Itunes or Amazon.)
1. Blood Brothers
2. Killer Clan
3. The Blazing Temple
4. The Invincible Kung-Fu Trio
5. 36th Chamber of Shaolin
6. Invincible Shaolin
7. The Heroic Ones
8. Mad Monkey Kung-Fu
9. The Boxer From Shantung
10. Return To The 36th Chamber",1494201600,8,965,4.578034682080925
