665586,4,6303499988,"I'm a 53 year old woman who enjoys staying fit. Back in my younger days I loved to do aerobics, but the impact just became too hard for my joints. I have been exercise walking for about 16 years now. Recently I have wanted  to begin some sort of exercising, but just didn't know what. I have lower  back problems and I sure didn't want to aggravate that problem. I found  that this tape is just the answer. It definitely gives you a workout,  making your abs really burn. Also,the trainer is careful to stress how to  take care of your back while doing the exercises. I think it's great! The  arms portions is an added bonus. Only after you do the tape will you  realize how much you need these exercises. Now, I am thinking about  purchasing the 8 minute buns video.",947980800,139,767,4.314685314685315
665587,5,6303499988,"I am very pleased with this tape.  It is a series of exercises that work all of the abdominal muscles in just eight minutes. This is a great tape for those of us that don't have a lot of spare time, but want to exercise.  The added arm exercises are great, also. I would definitely recommend this  tape to anyone who is looking for a fast, effective ab toner.",944006400,38,359,4.173913043478261
665588,5,6303499988,"This is a great video for getting washboard abs. Before I bought it, I was not too fat, but I had a fairly noticeable bulge around the midsection. I did not like taking off my shirt because it was disgusting to look at. But  when i got this tape, I saw results in only one week!! The bulge was  beginning to disappear!!!! And after three weeks, it was completely  gone!!!! All that was left on my midsection was solid muscle. I had a  killer six-pack. My waist line went from 34 1/3 inches down to 27 1/2!!!!  And concerning arms, they were not really flabby, but I had no muscle  there, when I flexed, nothing showed. But after a month of this video, they  grew huge!!! I got 16"" biceps!  Now, I am the hit of the beach  whenever I go there. Combined with my good looks, my killer body makes  women go crazy. Before they didn't pay attention to me, and now they stare  in a trance at me. I have a girlfriend now and boy, is she cuttteeee. She  is a tennis player. All you people out there, get this video. It worked for  me and it can work for you.",927417600,8,1049,4.108374384236453

665765,5,6303499988,"Even though this VHS is so old, I still use it every week! I've been using the 8 minutes abs workout for many years and it is simply the best ab workout I've ever done and gave me results after two weeks. My stomach was noticeably firmer and more defined and I still use it to maintain tight abs. You can tell as you are working out that it's working as you feel the burn right away!

I love that the workout is so short and because you are so focused on proper form and movement, as well as Jamie's encouragement, the 8 minutes fly by! It's great to find a workout that works so well with little time commitment in the hustle and bustle of daily life. The exercises are very easy and Jamie, the instructor, really focuses on how to maintain proper form so as not to aggravate the neck and back. I also liked the bonus 8 minute arms workout that is on this as well!",1407628800,,865,4.118343195266272
665766,5,6303499988,I was very happy to find this video.  Several years ago I had purchased three other videos from the same company. I needed the arms workout to complete my program.  They all work very well.,1398297600,,189,4.371428571428571
665767,5,6303499988,This is an awesome 8 minute work-out. Really hits all the abs and arm muscles. Great and easy workout. Just love it.,1396396800,,116,4.318181818181818
665768,5,6303499988,"I am a 25 year old female, very active and work out 5-6 days a week, I will flatter myself by saying I am in pretty good shape. In the 90s my Dad ordered the 8 minute collection (abs, arms, butt) so I grew up doing these work outs. Now I am an adult and I have kept my VCR just so I can do these work outs. I do 8 min abs very morning before I get ready for work. Its pretty much the only ab work I do, besides heavy lifting at the gym and running. I find 8 min abs/butt are an easier regimen to sick with, instead of some 45 min workout video. Obviously these videos are not all you need to get in shape, but throw some cardio in there and occasionally lifting and you're on your way!
If you are thinking about investing in workout videos; 8 mins abs (and Butt!) are the way to go! Screw Insanity and POX (Im sure people will murder me for saying that lol)",1392768000,,857,3.875

I used it so often i wore it out and had to buy this new one and also bought one for my son. He doesn't have a bad back, but by using this video it will protect his back as he works on his Abs too.

I couldn't find it in DVD form.  I still have a VCR,  so was pleasantly surprised to find a VCR tape of this.  The tape arrived like new, never used before.  After 5 or 6 views, however, the tape within the cartridge broke down and the tape is unusable.  I was sad about this, but, I guess I might be too old, too. :)",1362700800,,493,3.87

665872,5,6303499988,Tough 8 minutes but definitely worth it.  I'm not an exercise junkie at all but I have had these tapes for 15 years and when mine wouldn't play any more I was immediately looking for a new one.  I'm glad I was able to find it.,1360022400,,226,3.891304347826087

665874,5,6303499988,"I bought this video years ago and did it (almost) every day for some time.  I remember noticing results - e.g., flatter stomach - quickly. Out of laziness I quit and kind of forgot about it all together.  A couple weeks ago, though, I was thinking about how I'd like to have a fitter midsection in time for summer and I found 8 Minute Abs again.  I remember now why I love it!  Eight minutes is a short time, and it's incredible how much work your abs can get in that time.  And what can beat a workout you can do lying down ;) Jaime Brenkus is so cheerful and supportive (get used to ""Good Job, Gang!  You can do it!"") - this is NOT a boot-camp style workout.",1334880000,,660,4.077519379844961
665994,5,6303499988,"I'm not a doctor, and I don't play one on TV, but if you're wanting to trim your abs or tone your arms, this 20-min video gives you the techniques to hit all the target muscle groups with simple daily 45-sec exercises that target specific muscle groups so that you can hit each of them.  I knew I wanted to trim the abs and tone the arms, shoulders, and chest, but I didn't know how to be strategic and effective.  Situps and pushups alone aren't comprehensive.  This video shows how to thoroughly tone your middle and your arms/shoulders/chest/back with simple, targeted exercises.  The on-screen 8-min and 45-sec countdown timers make it easy to stay on track.  Once you learn the routines, it's easy to continue these exercises anywhere, anytime, and know you're doing it effectively.",1318636800,,787,4.8

665996,5,6303499988,"I found this workout in the bargain bin at a department store several years ago. I have since purchased the DVD.  I use it when my back bothers me a little and the pain goes away. It is simple, short and very effective. After trying other workouts, I found this to be great for anyone from beginner to intermediate level. It may be a little light for advanced athletes, but should be part of anyones fitness library. I highly recommend this program to everyone.",1311033600,,461,4.488095238095238
665997,5,6303499988,"I love 8 minute Abs!  I used to have it on VHS, but it eventually got eaten. After trying several other routines, I finally got it on DVD.  My stomach muscles were sore after doing it once.  You can tell it's old and it's cheesy, but it's so quick. Plus, the instructor is really chipper and encouraging.  It's something that I have no excuse not to do, after all, it's only 8 minutes.  Obviously to see any major results, other cardio workouts are needed, but my abs are the worst so this is a good strengthening routine.",1299628800,,522,4.34020618556701

665999,1,6303499988,I was very disapointed did not even get through one play before it acted werid and was eaten alive by my vcr. My previous copy I played every day for years it finally wore out love the benifits of the exerice so I wanted another but it must have been old itself even though it was a new copy??

666000,5,6303499988,"You're not going to get as ripped as the people in the pic on the box, but you will get a nice bit of toning and in just 8 minutes.  This program is great for people who don't have a lot of time, and helps to start the workout process.  If you do it consistently you will build up a nice level of tone.  You will have to chose another program after that to really continue on as you will reach a point where this doesn't help too much any more.  But it is a great starter program!",1286668800,,480,3.86734693877551
666001,5,6303499988,"My abs are the only part of my body that I need to work on. I like this because it doesn't waste time on exercises that are good for the body overall, but don't focus solely on the area I want ultra trim.
It doesn't just save time because it's an 8 minute work out, it also saves time because it focuses on one part of the body",1282953600,,327,3.823529411764706
666002,5,6303499988,"I love this video work out!
It is not hard or too long.
A good 8 minute work out that really will work if you stay with it!",1263427200,,123,3.4285714285714284
666003,4,6303499988,This is an excellent video. It really works well but your going to need to do it on a daily basis. When you first start you might feel sore in your neck due to you over compensating for your abs which cannot handle it at the beginning. But you will definitely need to run or bike with this as well. You will build up your ab muscles which mine have done greatly but if you have a layer of fat over the muscles that will not go away without some type of active exercise. Also this video tends to work more of the core of your abs and less of the extreme lower abs. It does do a few for the lower abs but I definitely feel it more in my middle and upper abs. Overall though this is a very effective and quick way to get your abs looking good.,1258070400,2,740,3.9072847682119205
666127,5,6303499988,"I'd never done any work with weights before I bought this tape, so I thought it'd be a good way to get started. It was that, and even more!

I do this routine EVERY NIGHT after my aerobics workout, and it's beginning to make a difference that I can really feel. (my upper arms are still pretty ""plump"" right now, so I'll have to lose a bit more weight overall in order to SEE the newly developed definition in my arms) For someone who's new to working with weights, I'm pleasantly surprised at how quickly I've gotten a good result. Talk about positive reinforcement!  I started with one-and-a-half-pound weights and have worked my way up to using 3-pound weights. I fully expect to graduate to heavier weights as I continue to get stronger.

As other reviewers have noted, the tape gets right down to business. No nonsense, no wasted time. And that's extremely important to me because I'll have already done anywhere from 30 to 60 minutes of aerobics...AFTER I come home from work and prepared dinner for my family. But eight minutes isn't very long at all, and I can easily devote that little bit of time to my upper arms without feeling worn out, especially since I'm already warmed up from the aerobics anyway. It's far easier to incorporate this into my exercise routine that I'd have ever imagined.

Bottom line, the workout may be short in duration, but it's long on results!",1257379200,,1382,4.628571428571429

666129,4,6303499988,"I actually think this product does work.  I do it everyday, and I can feel it everyday.  I only do the abs and buns/legs parts though.  To help create less stress on your neck use a pillow, and ignore what he says about looking up I look down the front of my body and I never have neck problems.  I did have trouble with the vcr one with it not working but it was a REALLY old tape, now I use the DVD.  So I say if you will stick with it and do the excersises right, this is a good workout.",1204156800,,490,3.764705882352941
666130,5,6303499988,"I admit I was skeptical of a product that promised results with seemingly so little effort and the first time around when I tried it, I didn't see much results beyond feeling a little stronger. But then my husband and I tried it together along with a cardio program (20 min. a day) and I lost an inch and half in a matter of less than two months. It is not magic, but it works if you do it properly and do cardio on the side to burn fat. I have had chronic back problems and this has helped a lot with strengthening my abs and my back. Worth every bit of effort and time and then some.",1188259200,,585,3.9661016949152543
666131,4,6303499988,Good intense workout! I use it for 3 years to maintain my 6 pack! Too bad that it does not do a good job at tightening obliques.......,1175040000,,134,4.0
666132,4,6303499988,"I've only been using the product for a little while now so i haven't seen much results although i can definately feel that i'm doing SOMETHING when i'm working out. I've never been in shape and when i'm a full time student acutally over full time student and i work 40 hours a week i don't really have much time for anything haha. thats what i like about this video is that you can pop it into your dvd player or laptop and work out in the hour or so before i go to work. My mom got this for me to help get me in shape (she's recently lost over 100lbs and now wants to help me to lose weight.) The thing that i appreciate most about the video is that he is constantly saying that its ok if you're a beginner, or its ok if you cant do the full 30 seconds because honestly at this point i cant and when i did exercise groups or other videos i felt kind of ashamed or REALLY out of shape. I like how he doesnt pressure you and he realizes that everyones limits are different. I've also used the 8 minute legs (not so hard for me  since i do alot more walking and running than anything else) and it was pretty good too i will definately keep on using these products!",1174608000,,1162,4.008620689655173

666134,5,6303499988,"In the beginning the exercises put my neck through a lot of training (and some pain) but the bonus has been a nice neckline. Some of the abs exercises needed to be worked up to and I was just patient with myself and let myself rest when I needed to. Now I've noticed that even if I haven't done the exercises for about two weeks... it's easy to get back into them without any pain. It seems that this really has conditioned by muscles. It's my most difficult area to keep in shape and this tape does it!

After using the VHS tape on a more regular basis this the year -- it's starting to get worn out so I'm looking for a DVD version.

I'm just beginning with the arms using the soup cans. It's pretty easy so I think I may need to graduate to weights.",1157068800,3,752,4.074324324324325

My parents got this tape back when I was younger [I'm only 14] and I watched my mom do it all the time. But when I got older I started doing it and it was awesome my abs were actully harder and tighter then before! But unfortunitly the tape was recently eaten by my vcr, but of course I loved this so much I went on good ol Amazon and orderd the dvd package which includes 8 minute abs, buns, thighs, and arms, but I haven't recieved it yet.  But if your concidering getting this I highly recommend getting the whole 8 minute workout pack which I mentioned above because it's around the same price of this one tape but you get all the workouts on 2 dvds.

Brenkus' style is laid back, straightforward, non threatening, and the exercises are simple to do.  I felt it after one use of the tape, and saw results in a few weeks after using it regularly each day.  Now I use weights to increase the difficulty.

A worthy investment for those short on time, and for those who hate to be condescended to in those videos by those perky, size two models.",1152403200,2,564,4.554455445544554

Almost immediately (1-2 days) I started seeing results, I was amazed. It's not an easy workout, but it is short - and it most definately gets the job done.

It was the perfect choice to kick off a fitness habit five years ago when my girlfriend introduced me to it:  the right length to do every day, serious enough to produce results and campy enough to keep me in good humor.  It's become an old, reliable friend.

666247,5,6303499988,"I used this video in High School weightlifting class, and remember hating it cause it actually made me work.  (I used to mostly try hide out in the back of the class with my friends.)

A few years later, I had my daughter I decided to buy the tape for myself. I would use the tape for a couple months and then go off for a while.  I did notice that when I used the tape my stomache was a lot harder than it was when I wasn't using it.

One thing I did notice is that this video seems to only work me in the middle section of my stomach.  No matter what I would do I couldn't seem to get rid of my love handles, even though they were small, they seemed to want to stay.  Though that could have been from having a baby and having my body change so much.

My tape had many uses for about 2 years when it quite working on me, it just wouldn't play in the vcr anymore.  I did memorize the routine and was doing it that way until I got pregnant again, now I can't seem to remember exactly how it went so I've decided to upgrade to the DVD.

I would totally recomend this video to others, though I might suggest the dvd for better viewing if you can't memorize the tape yourself.

I only weight 100 at 5'2"" tall.  I am happy with my weight but my abs are a problem.  I began using this tape along with several other tapes (rotating each day) and it works.  It only takes a few minutes a day and you will see results.

I also recommend Quick Fix Abs and Quick Fix Tight Abs; along with Firm Parts 5 day abs.  All these tapes are less than 10 minutes.  Most have 3-5 day segments so you can use the same tape for a few days.  They are all good.

For a longer ab workout Winsor Pilates Ab Sculpting is good but it's 20 minutes.  I try to do this one once a week.

And the second person is a guy and he is for those who have worked out before (he uses weights). The instructor (who is using 2 cans of food not weights) tells you what to do and the name of the movement. The screen shows you the name of the movements and how many minutes and seconds you have left. The left side of the screen has how many minutes you have left (it counts backwards) and on the right side of the screen it shows how many seconds you have left till you finish each movement. This is a straight and to the point workout. There are different movements for your arms, back, chest and shoulders. I needed this because I am trying to get my upper body back into shape. I was surprised, this workout was quick, fast and to the point. There was no breaks, warm ups or a chance  to stop. It's good to do a five minute warm up and stretch your arms and back before going in. Be sure to breathe and have some water handy. In the end...I can actually say I had fun. For a workout that came out so long ago, It didn't seem like it. I would recommend this. A+",1090195200,5,1226,4.087136929460581
666250,5,6303499988,"A couple months ago I got the ""8 Minute Abs"" video and it totally rocked my world.  It was just incredible to get rid of my gut, and all it really took was the commitment to do the darn tape every day, no matter what.  I gave myself that like a present for my 38th birthday.  And after just a couple months my old lady was so turned on and hot for me again that we started doing this ""New Sex Now"" and ""Goddess Worship"" sex stuff off some videos, and it was just radical! My old lady was just so diggin' me, and I was lovin' life!  So I said hey, why not get my arms all rockin' cut too?  And I got this tape and, for Valentine's day I'm gonna get a red rose tatood on my tricep and give her that instead of a dozen long-stems!  Ha!",1075161600,8,732,3.8466666666666667

I didn't realize how much I had been compromising myself... My own ego was selling me out, underselling me, underrating myself, because of my ... gut-roll. I used to be in such great shape, but age and work and a kid and mortgage payment, the whole deal, took a toll... mostly around the belly.  (I hate that word, but that's what I had.)  So I finally said to myself I'm friggin gonna do this ""8 Minute Abs"" thing every day, and I did, and it rocks, after just a couple months,,,  It rocks so hard being cool about taking off my shirt at the pool or the beach without feeling so self-conscious because I knew I had that little paunch.  And now I'm psyched to strip it back and stretch out my sixpack for all to see.  This has been right up there in terms of profound effect on my life with the ""New Sex Now"" and ""Goddess Worship"" video techniques my old lady turned me onto. So I guess I kinda did this for her too.  I have to say, I am very grateful to have such a hot and loving babe in my life to inspire me with stuff like this.

666378,5,6303499988,"8 Minute Abs is a solid workout that works your upper and lower abs and obliques. There are two countdown clocks at the bottom of the screen, the total workout clock and a forty five second clock for each exercise. This is still my favorite ab workout after five years because there isn't any 'core conditioning' crapolla- just eleven solid floor work exercises. The workout is led by Jamie Brenkus and there are two other participants, a man and a woman. It's set outside by a lake.
8 Minute Arms isn't as good. Because I am an intermediate/advanced exerciser, eight minutes for upper body is just silly. I guess you can get results if you use heavier weights but... An earlier reviewer pointed out something that I had been wondering about- what's up with Jamie's Beetlejuice garb?

After you use it you'll notice your tummy feels much stronger and tighter.  I would advise people to use this tape right before going to a party or somewhere that you want to show off your body.  The people are motivating, and they get right down to business.  If you hate to work your abs, this is a good one because you go too fast to realize you're even working out (this from a person who was a beginner and hated working my abs).

As a matter of fact, I have replaced my Firm abs workout with this one.
Although I still have not seen the ""six-pack"" as of yet, my abs look wonderful.  I am really going to put Jaime to the test as I have started doing this video every night of the week.

It is the one constant in my routine because it only takes 8 minutes out of my day. My old self-formulated ab routines were long and I needed to allow myself 48-72 hours of rest. Now I can do 8 min abs every day with better results in less time without being sore. I've been using this for not even 2 weeks... after the 1st week I already saw very noticeable results.  My midsection has always been somewhat toned with hints of a six-pack but now it is worthy of being called a true six pack. My only problem was that the first 3-4 workouts my neck was really taking a toll even though I was correctly performing the movements; It is much easier on my neck now.",1045526400,5,781,4.1381578947368425

666536,5,6303499988,"8 Minute Arms is exactly that: 8 minutes of arm exercises with very, very little breaks in between.  This is an excellent tape to add to your collection for the days that you really don't feel like working out (but would feel even worse if you don't) or for the days that you want to go easy and just have to do have do a little something.
This tape assumes that the viewer is familiar with the exercises and that you have warmed up beforehand. There is no warmup, Jaime jumps into the program immediately after explaining what types of weight to use.  Each exercise lasts for 30 seconds and the triceps, biceps, upper back and shoulders are targeted.

666537,5,6303499988,"When I first did this video (the abs only), I hurt so bad for 3 days... my abs hurt so bad and my neck *really* hurt!  I was persistent, though.  I did it again, but this time, I did ""every other"" crunch instead of all of them.  That helped a *lot*.  Then I realized I was using my neck and not concentrating on using my ab muscles (it's been so long).  Now?  I can do that abs workout twice a day and it doesn't hurt, but I can still feel it work.  I have to consistently concentrate on using my ab muscles and not my neck, though... but Jamie reminds you of this throughout the video.  I even do every crunch!  The best part?  Is that I've been doing the video only for 3 weeks (everyday consistently) and I've already gone down a size in jeans!  AND people have consistently commented on my ""weight loss""!  Another thing is that I make sure not to eat within 3 hours of going to bed.  I started this at the same time as started the video.  I read somewhere that our bodies burn fat while we sleep, but if we eat within 3 hours of going to bed, our body burns the food instead of body fat... so if you're working out and dieting and not losing weight, that's probably why.  It works!!  I do the video every morning (and I'm not a morning person, but 8 minutes is so quick)... I wouldn't trade these tapes for anything in the world!",1036368000,17,1333,4.108527131782946

666539,5,6303499988,"This video is excellent for people who want a quick workout.  The instructors get right down to business from the get-go, without a lot of talking or wasting time.  You spend roughly 45 seconds on each exercise, which is perfect - you will feel the burn if you're working constantly and not taking breaks.  I can see how other readers think the tape gets boring after a while, but I don't watch exercise tapes to be entertained - just to get a good workout.  This tape delivers what it promises- a quick and efficient workout without all the nonsense often stuffed into videos.  It's great because when I don't feel like working out, it's only 8 minutes, so it's manageable.  I highly recommend this tape if you're interested in a concise, effective workout.",1027382400,4,758,4.661654135338346

The lower abs have always been a problem area in my family and the exercises have been VERY effective.  The time goes by really fast, but I was surprised by how many reps you can do in 8 minutes.  Just with the crunches alone, I do 126!  I would highly recommend this tape to others who like me do not like to exercise, but want to have those great abs.  The tape works all areas of the abs too.  I have used my tape so much, the tape wore out and I bought another.  I do not exercise without it!  I recommend doing the arms first and then the abs to work yourself up, as the abs will make you sweat more than the arms.",1024963200,9,713,3.9027777777777777

However, I ordered this tape, along with 8 Minute Buns + 8 Minute Thighs and I must say that I am absolutely loving these toning exercises.  I'm able to squeeze a quick workout into my day and am seeing pleasant results in a short period of time.  Of course not all bodies respond as quickly to exercise and any exercise if done improperly can have the opposite effect than intended (which may account for some of the negative reviews).  If the crunches are done correctly your neck should not hurt, therefore do not be discouraged by those who call this a ""neck workout.""  The arms portion of the tape is designed for everyone from beginners, to intermediates, to the advanced.  I personally appreciate the way all three levels are represented on this portion of the tape (one person uses no weights, the lead instructor uses tomato cans and the third person uses hand weights.)  The timers on the bottom of the screen provide added incentive to stay the course through to the end of the workout.  I definitely recommend this tape to anyone who feels as I did that they had no time for a workout!...",1024099200,18,1239,4.545045045045045

I have recommended these to family members and friends who now feel the exact same way. I once lost my ab tape from a plane trip and that same day I went online to replace it. IT IS that good.
Recommendation--------- for 8 minute arms....if you are somewhat experienced at fitness, this tape seems a bit too simple according to the  instructor's advice..using no weights or tomato cans, but if you add the right amount of weight that fits your ability it becomes a great workout. If ""tomato cans "" are not doing it for you..... well you know what to do. Enjoy!!!",1023235200,4,688,4.333333333333333

Since the purchase of the video I have tried everything including the Ab Shocker and nothing has compared to 8 minute abs.  I highly recommend this workout and I believe that will will result in a very happy ending for someone who is seeking help in the ab area of their body.  Good luck and have fun.  It really works.

The only vise is that for the first few times you do, you may want to have somebody watch your form to make sure you are doing it right. If you really want to see results, you must change you diet to that of low-fat (fat seems to go straight to the abs for some reason) and burn the fat already surrounding the abs since the muscle is under the fat.

The setting is a lovely river view with two exercisers and the lead instructor Jaime Brenkus. Jaime Brenkus has a friendly, approach with just the right touch of enthusiasm. On the abs section of the  tape, he leads you through 8 minutes of exercises designed to work different parts of your abdominal muscles. Each set of movements like oblique twists and reverse curls are 45 seconds long. A small bell rings when each set is done. Brenkus then takes you into the next set. A timer at the bottom of the screen tracks your progress till you have completed the full 8 minutes. There is no warm up or cool down. Just 8 minutes of straight abdominals. I really love the ab section. It's handy to tack on to the end of another workout when you are already warmed up or warm up yourself and use alone. It's hard to find an ab tape that is short and efficient, where you don't have to fast forward through a lot of tape you don't need. I also like the one on one style Jaime demonstrates. The timer is motivating too. The one drawback is that Jaime does not explain to the viewer correct abdominal postioning to get maximum benefits from ab work. This makes a big difference in results. But if you already know this information and want a quick workout I highly recommend it! In the bonus 8 minute arms section, Jaime does a number of different exercises to work the arms in different ways using light weights. Again a timer at the bottom keeps track of the 8 minutes. The drawback to this section is there is not enough time to switch from lighter to heavier weights for a more effective workout. The change from one exercise to another is rapid so you really have to stay with the same weights the whole time and this may not challenge the areas that could use a heavier weight. However, as an occasionally boost to your fitness program or as a mini toning section its quite nice. The ab workout alone is worth the price of the tape!",981676800,66,2101,4.346055979643766

THe movements are varies and self-paced, each one timed at 45 seconds.  The movements are tough, without being too tough.  BUT - some of them exercises can be tough on the neck, there are a few places where he does not give enough imput into form.  I think there is potential for a beginner to injure the neck or lower back, if not careful.",980467200,,608,4.189655172413793
666996,5,6303499988,I started a new work out routine in May 2000.  I included the eight minute routines in it.  It is now Jan 2001 and I have succeeded in losing approximately 75 lbs. (From 200 to 123).  Everything together helps out but I feel these tapes were very important. I have recently included a friend in my findings and she has started on the legs tape and is thrilled.  She has purchased two more.  I need to get the arms to finish my collection.  I have recently joined the internet and was thrilled to find the last tape I needed.  You need to get these tapes into the stores a little more.  Thanks a lot.  KImberly,979776000,4,609,4.226086956521739
666997,4,6303499988,"I was first introduced to 8-minute abs when my roommate borrowed it from a friend.  By the end I could really feel my abs burning!  This is a great tape, combining the abs and the arms, which are also good exercises, not just for the arms, but the shoulders, chest, and back as well.  8 minutes is so short you can always make time.  I like to modify some of the moves (especially the ones to work the lower abs) now that I have been doing the tape for a while.  I also own the 8-minute legs & buns tape, which is good for legs, but the exercises for buns are pretty repetitive and didn't feel like they were working very well.  The music is pretty cheesy, but the instructor is very encouraging and goes slowly enough so that even a beginner can quickly pick up the exercises.  This video is well worth the little time and money that you spend.",977702400,10,845,4.211180124223603
666998,5,6303499988,"I've always disliked any form of structured, repetitive exercise, preferring instead to hike, rollerblade, dance, and take part in activities that are more enjoyable to me. However, the 8 Minute Abs and 8 Minute Arms workouts have helped me tremendously, without requiring me to set aside large blocks of time for tedious exercises. The exercises themselves are very focused so that you don't spend a lot of time jumping around without accomplishing your goals. I'm very impressed by how quickly I've noticed a difference in my body. I can do pushups for the first time in my life, my Yoga practice has improved tremendously, and I feel wonderful.
I'd recommend this tape to anyone who hates to work out, but loves exercise and being in shape.",977011200,34,743,4.904761904761905
666999,5,6303499988,"This is a great tape for anyone who wants more definition. Combined with aerobic activity (walking, running, stairmaster, etc.) and the right diet, it really works! Feel free to contact me if you'd like to know how I lost 35 pounds and kept it off for three years now! I am not SELLING anything, so don't look for a get thin quick fix.",971568000,2,335,4.333333333333333
667000,5,6303499988,"I've been using this video for about three months, and my abs are definitely tighter.  For some reason, though, I still don't look like either of the two guys in the video--maybe that happens in the fourth month.
Anyway, I've really enjoyed the tape and I highly recommend it to others.  My first workout left me with a good tight feeling in my stomach, even though the exercises didn't seem all that hard to do.
The main virtue of the tape is that it's short and simple: when other demands of life keep me from the gym, I can still pop the tape into the VCR and feel like I haven't lost too much ground.
I also like the tone of the instructor.  I've used some other workout tapes (e.g., The Firm), but the dulcet tones of the exercise leaders and the coded aerobics language that they use make me feel like I'm being assimilated into a Fitness Cult.  Brinkus is more like that jock you knew in high school who turned out to be a pretty nice guy after all--his instructions are plain, simple and well paced, without jargon but spiced with a ""hey,gang"" kind of enthusiasm.  Even those not used to exercise will find this tape fairly easy to get into.",970876800,44,1149,4.375586854460094
667001,5,6303499988,"This is among the best ab videos I have ever seen. Each move is done for  45 seconds, and you alternate ab work with oblique work. I have done the  video several times, and can feel the burn. I know this works. The  countdown clock makes the workout even better. You don't have to worry  about how much time you have left, because it is displayed on the screen at  all times. I would recommend this video to anyone.",968976000,10,415,4.2025316455696204
667002,4,6303499988,"This is a good ab workout. I did feel a good burn but I did not find it  too challenging, but I do workout my abs everyday. The exercies are simple  but work. I think that this is a good tape for the beginner to  intermediate. But if you have been working out for a while you may not find  it too hard. It was fun though and offered a change. I like the viedo  because if I am just lying around the house I will pop it in and get a  quick pump. But I still do a longer ab routine at the gym. The only thing I  wish that this tape had was a warm up and a cool down.",968371200,3,564,3.5737704918032787

I tried using my really old aerobics tapes  from the late 80's and found them to be too long or generally not  ""safe"" by today's standards and my older body.  I found the  exercises on this video to be extremely beneficial and actually FUN!  Just  when you think how much time is left?  I look on the TV screen and see I am  almost done!  I also have 8 Minute Buns and Thighs and alternate doing 2 of  each a day.  They have not given me any back problems (which I had injured  in a car accident) and I feel great after finishing.

I will definetely buy the rest of the series. Just because it is 8  minutes doesn't mean it doesn't work,i read somewhere that in order to have  a good workout you should do a small and average workout or a longer and  more calm workout. And this tape proves it. Hope you will buy it,you will  love it. You will do it every day and stay in shape.
