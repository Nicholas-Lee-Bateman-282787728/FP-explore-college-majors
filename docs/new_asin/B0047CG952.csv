4284273,4,B0047CG952,"I ADORED going to Cavalia last year.

Many people complained about the quality of the show, and on some levels I agree.  It was not the best dressage, vaulting, roman riding, or horsemanship I have ever seen by a long shot (except the arabian stallians at liberty - that was amazing).  It was not the best music I have ever heard, not the most breathtaking acrobatics or gymnastics, and it was not quite the best staging I have ever seen.

That said, it WAS the most amazing SHOW I have ever seen.  There is nothing in the world like it.  I also appreciate the fact that the same people who did the roman riding, also rode dressage, jumped, did trick riding, amazing gymnastics, and probably care for and help train the horses.  I don't know anyone who is that varied in their skills with horses, or, well, anything.  Despite the fact that the piaffe and passage was always sloppy, they had over 20 horses who could do it (or fake their way through it).  Despite the fact that the vaulting was not death defying, the horses were at liberty, beautifully conditioned, and the vaulters were ambitious and smiling. Despite the fact that the thematics and ocasional act were unbelievably cheesy, THEY HAD A DISAPPEARING LAKE.  Overall the show was unique, and it felt as if it was created, and directed with care. The actors and producers seemed to have a true desire to show the unique world that is equestrianism, and truly cared for the horses.  At my show there were almost no pinned ears, no lameness, and no harsh punishment or equipment.  That is more than I can say for most local horse shows, at any level.

Now my review of the DVD:

They did a great job of capturing Cavalia, and showing it to you from angles that you could never have seen from the audience.  At first, the laugh-track applause bothered me, but after a bit I thought it fit in pretty well.  Of course it was nothing like going to the actual show, but it was way cheeper, and I can share it with everyone.  So far, I have heard only compliments from the people I lend it to.

My only complaint is the quality.  Most DVDs look pretty darn good on my HDTV, but this one left something to be desired.  It looked fine on my older TV, but blown up, it was often fuzzy or pixelated.  For that I remove one star.",1325030400,2,2278,4.401913875598086
4284284,3,B0047CG952,"Pretty good show, but it moves kinda slow.  The music and movements are nice though.",1438819200,,84,4.6
4284285,5,B0047CG952,"Bought both Cavalia Live and Cavalia. Wish I'd known they were the same.
The concept of Cavalia is without rival from beginning to end. From the idea to the performance.
I wish they would come within 100 miles of me and I could see it in person.
Imagine horses at liberty enjoying their human and visa versa.",1433548800,,308,4.421052631578948

4284294,3,B0047CG952,"The horses are absolutely beautiful.  I enjoyed watching them perform, but the dvd didn't  really excite me.  Maybe the show is more impressive if you actually experience it live.",1390089600,,179,5.103448275862069
4284295,5,B0047CG952,Great Dvd. Great entertainment. If you are a horse person you will like this. If you are not a horse person you will still enjoy it.,1388275200,2,132,4.115384615384615

4284297,5,B0047CG952,I have seen this show live twice and both times it is the best.  I love horses and to see how well trained and well kept is great.  I enjoyed this tape it put me their again.,1380672000,,174,3.675675675675676

4284299,4,B0047CG952,"If in this lifetime, you have the chance, and I do mean chance, to see Cavalia live and in person, DO NOT MISS IT.  The Circ du Soleil production of equestrian excellence is magical.  The event is transporting, even to the world weary and those who have forgotten how it felt to be amazed.  Truely unique and mythical in person, the dvd does it's best to capture the experience.",1379462400,,378,4.449275362318841
4284300,2,B0047CG952,It was just a bit too boring. Better music and scenario might have helped but it just wasn't worth watching a second time.,1378857600,,122,4.3478260869565215
4284301,5,B0047CG952,saw this show live and loved it so the dvd will let me relive those wonderful moments. Would highly recommend to everyone.,1377993600,,122,4.590909090909091
4284302,5,B0047CG952,Wanted to see more. Beautiful....Horses and humans together. Some day I'd love to go see it live. Wish I had a job working in that world.,1374278400,,137,4.3076923076923075
4284303,5,B0047CG952,I loved this DVD and was memorised by these majestic creatures. The whole show was very entertaining and the music is quite beautiful. The introductory session was great as it covers all the different breeds of horses used in the program.,1371686400,,238,4.829268292682927
4284304,5,B0047CG952,"This is not just for the dedicated horse enthusiast - it's simply beautiful art. The bond between the horses and their co-stars is mesmerising.  It is also lovely to see a show that can be enjoyed by the whole family (though parents and carers take note - the opening sequence shows a foal being born, which may need to be explained to small children).",1368576000,3,352,4.5
4284305,5,B0047CG952,"Was a gift for Christmas.  The recipient LOVED it.  Said it was an excellent CD, showed the entire performance.  A must see for horse lovers!",1357862400,,141,4.56

4284307,4,B0047CG952,"I really wanted to see Cavalia, but never got to. And while no video can truly capture the atmosphere and all that is going on during a live performance, this is the next best thing. The performances were still amazing to watch ... and they left me wishing I could have seen the show live.",1357430400,,289,4.2727272727272725
4284308,2,B0047CG952,"We attended the show and enjoyed it - the Video looses the ""live"" aspect of the performance.  It is definitely not worth what we paid for it.",1351900800,,141,4.222222222222222
4284309,5,B0047CG952,"Cavalia Live is a gorgeous dvd of a live performance of this sensational show. Great quality, nicely packaged, and conveniently set up--it has a chapter option available on the menu so you can go straight to your favorite parts when you don't have time to watch the whole thing.
The main drawback is that this dvd was put out after the phenomenally talented founders of Cavalia, Frederic Pignon and Magali Delgado, left the show and returned home to France to raise their son. So their performances and their stallions are not featured in this dvd. To see them, you have to buy the first Cavalia dvd which has interviews galore and highlights of the actual show, though not a full recording of the entire show.
The show is still amazing without them but it did seem to be lacking a little of the personal magic of the original cast. I find that this dvd is best enjoyed in conjunction with the earlier Cavalia dvd. A little pricey to get them both, but well worth it.",1350864000,,967,4.531428571428571
4284310,5,B0047CG952,"Love the horsemanship on this show. It's very obvious that the riders have a good bond with their horses. There are trapezes, trick riders, acrobatics here as well; all which are centered around the horses.
My favorite performance is Sylvia Zerbini's liberty act featuring her 9 Arabian geldings and stallions. Watching her communicate with her horses was awe inspiring.
This show features many breeds of horses including  Lusitanos, Canadian draft and even Quarter horses.
This dvd also features questions and answers section, Ambra Zerbinis first performance, and a training session with two young horses.",1342051200,9,607,5.457446808510638
4284311,5,B0047CG952,"I think that this is the only DVD available of Cavalia, the fabulous horse act.  The DVD is a bit grainy, but does show most of the show.  The bonus features are great...they include a brief behind-the scene tour of the stables, and a rehearsal.  Highly recommended as either a way to remember the show if you went to it, or just to marvel at the horses and riders if you haven't seen the show.",1336867200,,394,4.226666666666667
4284312,5,B0047CG952,"I saw the show and was mesmerized.  I have never been a ""horse person"", but always appreciated their beauty and power.
The show is truly the most magnificent show I've personally ever seen. A bit of Cirque de Soleil, and the brilliance of
the lovingly, amazingly trained horses was just superb. The show was captivating and the dvd allows me to relive a
wonderful experience. A must see! for your bucket list.",1330560000,,409,4.680555555555555
4284313,5,B0047CG952,Fantastic DVD of the live performance.  I especially enjoyed the slow motion replay of some of the stunts.  It was a nice touch to add a tour of the stables and training exercise.,1330041600,4,179,4.393939393939394

8417952,3,B0047CG952,"Saw Cavalia Live in 2006. This DVD performance is from 2010 and is different from when I saw it Live. I remember the lead singer sang the songs better Live in 2006 at that time too. The horses are beautiful!

(If you do get this for children to watch please skip the first 90 seconds) They show live horse birth. Not something I wanted my four year old to see yet) LOL",1445904000,,368,4.111111111111111
