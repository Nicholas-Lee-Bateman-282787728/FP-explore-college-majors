Throughout his career, his goal was to be unrecognizable from one role to the next; this performance affirms his uncanny facilitiy in that regard. His versatility is umatched, and astounding.",1395532800,2,332,5.166666666666667
868031,5,6304422806,"If portraying an ideal for Life is propaganda . . . then this film is just that.

Did all Britons of this era share and live the values portrayed here (?) No.
Did enough share and live them . . . to make them quintessentially British values (?) I think so.

Everyone can decide for themselves whether they are values to be admired . . . or not.
I myself admire them a lot . . ..",1393804800,3,378,3.896103896103896

The Olivier character is telling this story to some British sailors who are in a Russian port delivering war material to the Russians.  Interesting film of its time.,1391299200,,289,4.76
868033,5,6304422806,"It's strange how much I differ in opinion with others who write these reviews. This movie is sort of a propaganda movie, but to me, it's good propaganda (much better than the propaganda coming out of Hollywood these days). In this movie Lawrence Olivier is a Russian Engineer who goes to England on business and has all these preconceived (communists) ideals of a free enterprise system and the people in a free country. He finds out how warm and charitable the English are softens his perspectives. The acting in this movie is very good and Lawrence Olivier is very funny as a Russian with bad English. Also the romance works well, I'd love to find a woman like that (oh well...), she (Penelope Ward) does a good job of being lovable.",1381190400,3,735,4.6183206106870225
868034,3,6304422806,"""The Demi-Paradise"" (aka ""Adventure for Two"") is a 1943 black and white ""fish out of water"" comedy with political overtones. Set in 1939, a Soviet inventor (Laurence Olivier) travels to England to get the British to build a new prototype of an icebreaker propeller, and falls in love with the daughter (Penelope Ward) of the ship building firm's owner (Felix Aylmer).

Laurence Olivier (1907-89) was nominated for an Oscar 10 times, from 1939 (""Wuthering Heights"") to 1978 (""Boys from Brazil""), and won in 1949 for ""Hamlet"". He appeared in 80+ films, usually as an Englishman or in films based in England.  His prime period had been in the 40s, and he made few films in the 50s, probably because of all the personal problems he was having. He appears as #14 on the AFI list of Top 50 Screen Legends.

While Olivier played an Englishman very well, his attempt to play a Russian is unsuccessful. For the first half hour of this 2+ hour film he appears to be constipated/

Penelope Ward (1914-82) plays Olivier's love interest. She was active in the late 30s and early 40s in British films, then abruptly retired in 1948 after her marriage to Sir Carol Reed. She does a marvelous job as the plucky Englishwoman who draws the opinionated Russian out of his shell.

Felix Aylmer (1889-1979) plays Ward's father. Of his 150+ films, Aylmer is best known for his roles as Polonius in Olivier's ""Hamlet"" (1948) and as the Archbishop of Canterbury from ""Becket"" (1964). He does his usual good job here.

Margaret Rutherford (1892-1972) has a small role as a friend of the family. She's best known for her roles as Miss Marple in Agatha Kristie films of the 60s, and for her Oscar and Golden Globe winning performance in ""The VIPs"" (1963). She does her usual good job.

Famed British comedian Leslie Henson (1891-1957) appears as himself in two music hall comedy routines that are well worth viewing, and reminiscent of Victor Borge's work in the U.S.

The film is directed by Anthony Asquith (1902-68) who is most famous for ""Pygmalion"" (1938), ""The Importance of Being Earnest"" (1952) and ""The VIPs"" (1963).

The first part of the film is the ""fish out of water"" segment, and despite disappointing Olivier's performance, it is very amusing as the British poke fun at themselves. But the key to real success in ""fish out of water"" films is to have the fish out of the water, as Crocidile Dundee was when he came to New York, or Tom Hanks when he played a teenager in a 30 year old body, or Edie Murphy trying to work with the Beverly Hills Cops. So the real treat is denied us as Olivier, an Englishman, tries to fool us that he's really a Russian.

The second half of the film (did I mention it's more than 2 hours long) is the propaganda portion, making nice between the British and the Ruskies, without every mentioning that the Russians and the Nazis were allies from 1939 until 1941.

Bottom line - definitely some funny scenes as the British poke fun at themselves",1367193600,3,2960,4.6513409961685825
868035,3,6304422806,"A curious production which starts softly as a comedy of manners, then progresses to a love story, then suddenly turns into a full-blown propaganda film. A memorial to the short-lived Soviet-British friendship.

May be interesting: (1) to Olivier fans (he creates a consistent, albeit not very deep, character of an improbable Russian (being Russian myself, I know); (2) to film historians, etc.; (3) to anyone with a penchant for the weird.

The acting is generally very good, the plot is quite contrived.

However, the film has its moments: the playing of cello in the dark garden with the intermingling sounds of bombs and nightingales, a historic pageant, a few seconds of warmth and affection here and there.

I watched it yesterday (on a DVD), on the last evening of 2008 - a strange choice, I agree.",1230681600,4,805,4.897058823529412
868036,3,6304422806,"Laurence Olivier stars in this soft-edged wartime propaganda film, which sought to promote trust and understanding between the beleagured Brits and the newfound Russian allies.  Olivier plays Ivan Kouzeroff, a laconic but slightly uptight Soviet engineer who is sent to Britain before the war to broker a shipmaking deal with a local shipyard.  When he arrives, he's both wide-eyed and dismissive, full of preconceptions about the coldness and venality of the English.  All this, naturally, goes by the wayside over time: Ivan discovers how playful and warm-hearted the British actually are, and they give him emotional shelter before the gathering storm.  Not much going on in dramatic terms, but the nudge-nudge, wink-wink look at British mores, and the ""good neighbor"" propaganda elements are both kind of interesting from an historical perspective.  Even though his accent's a little off, Olivier's character is completely believable and charming, in his own odd way.",1055721600,7,971,5.446666666666666

7870562,4,6304422806,"Think of this as Britain's answer to ""Mission to Moscow,"" but, in that ever-English way, much less obvious than its Yankee counterpart.  You won't find any mention of Stalin's pact with Hitler that led to the dismemberment of Poland and the post-war Iron Curtain, but you will get some solid performances from Sir Lawrence and a bevy of British actors and actresses.  What people perceived in Penelope Dudley Ward is beyond me, but her upper class and political connections probably played a role in her landing the ladies' lead.  Dame Margaret Rutherford is a treat, as is Felix Aylmer as a surprisingly smart shipbuilder, and the socio-political references are handled well with a view towards getting the Brits to accept their Soviet ""allies,"" however misguided that effort ultimately proved to be.  In all, a fine film and a good glimpse of the British perspective of just how to deal with one of the strange bedfellows one often finds in war and politics.",1454716800,,960,4.907407407407407

7870564,5,6304422806,"I normally don't review things, but Demi-Paradise must be an exception.

This film is enchantingly wonderful in every respect: conception, writing, acting, and more.  It exudes good will and good humor without recourse to sentimentality or cliches.  It is idealistic without being sappy.  Most of all, it is about possibilities and the human potential for growth and understanding.

Oh, and it's funny and thoughtful and deep along the way.  Did I mention that for all of that, it is wonderfully entertaining.  If you miss watching it, you have missed something truly great...and real greatness is not easy to find, particularly in a quiet little film.",1445731200,3,652,5.152380952380953

7870566,3,6304422806,"I can forgive the naivet  of this movie. I can even forgive the terrible Russian accent of Sit Lawrence Olivier. What is hard to forgive is the twisting of historical facts. The movie is about a Russian engineer coming to England in 1939 to manufacture a revolutionary propeller. It is a movie about romance, about cultural divide and about friendship between different nationalities fighting a common enemy. This enemy became a common enemy when the Germans invaded Russia halfway through the movie. However, the movie completely ignores the fact that prior to that in August 23 1939 the Germans and the Soviet Union signed a treaty of nonaggression, known as the MolotovRibbentrop Pact. A week later the Germans invaded Poland and World War II started. Are we to believe that during that period the British were building ships for the Soviet Union?",1411603200,3,850,4.985915492957746
