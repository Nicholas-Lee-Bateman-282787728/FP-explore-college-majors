8055845,1,B0008ENIPW,"Your average US movie is 90 minutes long.  This was only about 75 minutes and the last 5 minutes was a random, out-of-nowhere rap video.

This could have been a serious meditation on the forced choices of ex-cons.  However, the main characters are not sympathetic ones.  I felt like much of the dialogue was stolen from Nia Long's scenes in ""Soul Food.""  The actors had no skills.  I wonder if their scripts were posted to the floors or walls and just read out loud.  This is supposed to take place in Louisiana, but you really don't get any of the local flavor from it.  This film was very intentionally set in Any Ghetto, USA.

The only thing I like was the main characters were cute.  Their haircuts were perfect.  One of them was sexy in that Busta Rhymes kind of way.",1303776000,,772,4.404255319148936
