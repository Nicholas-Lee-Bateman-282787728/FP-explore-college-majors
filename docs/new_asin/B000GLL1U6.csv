2614991,4,B000GLL1U6,"I followed the making of this movie on BRAVO's Project Green Light and I am excited to see it released on DVD.  I personally have not seen the movie yet, I would have supported it and gone to the theater if it had been released in NJ.  I can say that John G worked hard to create the film that he wanted and from the reviews it sounds like his hard work paid off. If you followed the show, there was alot of issues making this film, and at times it looked like the walls would crumble in on the project.  The budget was a modest 1 Million Dollars, chump change to pratically all films released.  If you have seen the movie please post your reviews and encourage others to support this film.",1160956800,4,690,4.165413533834586
2614992,4,B000GLL1U6,"I saw this movie at a pre-screening. I don't give it five stars because it's basic premise is that of the movie ""Dusk till Dawn!"" That aside, I still it's worth going to see.

More funny then it is a horror movie, I mean the monsters look so FAKE!! And the brave hero dies in say 3 secs. Don't worry others will arise to save the day.

Now this ain't a comedy because there is as much gore as there are laughs ... check that there is I think more gore! Okay, Comedy-horror movie! That's the best way to explain it! But don't go expecting to be scaried if your over 15 or maybe over 13. You will be disappointed.",1160611200,3,611,4.083333333333333
2614993,4,B000GLL1U6,"I saw this movie this past weekend at one of its very rare theatrical screenings (which happened to be at the theater where co-screenwater Marcus Dunstan used to work in Macomb, IL). What the film lacks in originality and budget it makes up for in attitude and ends up a fun, entertaining movie. The plot is a simple rehash of From Dusk Til Dawn, only this time it's monsters/aliens(?) attacking the bar, and the people are trapped inside, defending themselves like the folks in both the original and remake of Night of the Living Dead. The writers know what the audience expects from a film like this, so they throw a monkey wrench in here and there to dispel a few of the B-movie horror cliches, their tongues planted firmly in cheek. This movie is down right hilarious, but there are a few surprise moments. Don't expect to be scared, but there is plenty of blood and gore. As one person said on another site, the only element missing from the classic late 80's horror flicks is the gratuitous nudity - No T&A!!! (Just a little bare cleavage). The character profiles which pop up when the characters are first introduced have a Tarentino feel to them, and are a hoot. If you like From Dusk Til Dawn, Jeepers Creepers, the Evil Dead or Tales From the Crypt movies, or Return of the Living Dead, then this movie is a must see.",1160352000,44,1327,4.5103734439834025

It's odd that Matt Damon and Ben Affleck were executive producers, but maybe they just have good taste in horror flicks, I dunno. Not so much odd that Wes Craven was one as well.

The pace of the movie is awesome. Perfect balance of comedy and horror, I wasn't bored once. You're either cracking up or cringing. Pretty decent cast as well, I particularly enjoyed Hank Rollins as a motivational speaker who sports some very cute pink pants. Punk rock.

2615010,4,B000GLL1U6,"Nine Things About the Movie ""Feast""

1. This movie has a weird pedigree - it was made as the result of the third season of the Project Greenlight television series. It was produced by Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, and Wes Craven.

2. It's partly a spoof of the ""creature feature"" horror subgenre, but it's also a good splatter film itself.

3. It's about a group of people at a bar in the middle of nowhere that get attacked by a group of vicious (and horny) creatures, and they must figure out how to survive. Violence, blood, maggots, vomit, and teeth ensue.

4. The movie plays with your expectations of what a horror movie should be - it turns the stereotypes on their heads. You really can't predict who is going to die and who is going to survive.

5. In a clever twist, the characters are all introduced with a summary of who they are and what their chances are of surviving the movie.

6. The cast is as eclectic as the producers: Balthazar Getty plays a selfish redneck, and Henry Rollins leaves his hardcore punk band far behind to play a self-help guru who keeps trying to boost everybody's morale. And indie actor Jason Mewes has a small part in the movie - playing himself.

7. Some of the editing is so fast that sometimes it's hard to tell exactly what's going on. You never really get a full view of all the creatures. This might be to help hide the fact that it had a small budget and couldn't afford a lot of actual monster shots. But given the pacing and mood of the film, it works OK.

8. The movie is 85 minutes long, and after all the characters are introduced, it's pretty much full-throttle monster action. It doesn't waste much time building up the characters, because most of them die anyway.

9. There's no social commentary or deeper meaning to this movie. It's a simple fun, violent, monster movie that gorehounds should find worth watching.",1455321600,,1865,4.477876106194691

2615012,5,B000GLL1U6,"Hilarious !
That one word best sums up this bloody, disgusting yet charming movie.
Veteran Hollywood character actor Clu Gulager stars as a owner of a bar located in the middle of nowhere where all kinds of people stop in either for a drink or a good time.
However one night that all changes as they are attacked by creatures and trapped inside the bar by them.
All mayhem breaks loose as the patrons and bar owner try to defend their selves and your kept guessing who will die next as captions pop up on the screen about each character and their odds of survival leaving you laughing.
There are survivors but to find out what happens to them their is a part two and three which I highly recommend as well for the same bloody humor as the first movie.
A perfect five stars from me which I do not give often.",1450483200,,807,4.281045751633987

2615062,1,B000GLL1U6,"I'm basing this review more on my complete dissatisfaction with the Blu-Ray release than on the quality of the film.

The film itself is a ton of fun for gore-hounds, horror-junkies and fans of horror-comedy.  In addition to some decent thrills, cool creature effects and great set-pieces, it also has a lot of great jokes, ranging from bizarre slap-stick moments, to uproariously over-the-top carnage.  For me, the film is a strong 4 out of 5.

However, the Blu-Ray release left a sour taste in my mouth for two reasons.

I should note that I previously owned the unrated cut on DVD.  And I was very satisfied with the disc.  However, I lost my copies of all three ""Feast"" films a few years ago in a flood, and decided to upgrade to the Blu-Ray for the original.  And I'm not satisfied at all.

For starters, the disc barely works.  I tried to play it four times and the disc wouldn't load on my PS3.  Finally, the fifth time I tried, it loaded after about three full minutes of the disc sitting on a blank screen.

Eager to start it, I hit ""play"" and discovered that while the film looks good on Blu-Ray, the film is FALSELY ADVERTISED.  I bought the ""Unrated Edition"" (the case and the disc both read ""Unrated""), yet it doesn't feature the Unrated Edition!  It features the R-Rated Edition.  I'm sorry, but you shouldn't advertise the release as ""Unrated"" if it's not.  That's FALSE ADVERTISING (which is illegal in most places), and I honestly wouldn't have bought it if I knew it had the R-Rated cut.  I specifically wanted the Unrated Edition.

And before anyone says otherwise, I looked into it- across the internet, MANY people have noted this false advertising and complained about it on other sites.  (And there are sites that compare the R-Rated and Unrated cuts which further proves that this version is NOT the Unrated Cut.)

It's a shame.  I guess I'm just going to have to stick with buying a new DVD copy for now, because the Blu-Ray sucks.  (Which is the opposite of what usually is the case...  usually the Blu-Ray easily beats DVD due to upgraded picture and audio.  But here, the disc issues and the deceptive packaging ruin the experience.)",1402531200,,2161,4.626315789473685

2615073,4,B000GLL1U6,"FEAST (2005) is a really terrifying bloodbath of a dark comedy, one that's a perfect Halloween season film. Frame for frame, it just may be the goriest, grossest picture ever made. The violence is unrelenting!

I love this one's humorous touches, like freeze-framing on each character to put up a spoof bio on them. At the very start of the film, the hunky one identified as ""HERO, LIFE EXPECTANCY: Pretty effin' good!"" comes bursting into this rundown desert tavern and tells everyone present to prepare for an attack from flesh eating monsters.

He shows them a trophy: this ghastly, alien-looking head with a mouthful of razor-sharp teeth. ""Bartender"" (Clu Gulager) asks, ""Who the hell are you?"" as Hero backs towards a window. ""I'm the guy that's gonna save your ass!"" he declares, back to the wall. A creature reaches through the open window, and our hero with a darn good life expectancy has his head bit right off. Arterial blood soaks the room as the headless corpse teeters on its feet then falls over.

That's just the start of the fun!

Obviously, this Wes Craven-produced movie is not for the squeamish or anyone wishing to avoid having frightful nightmares. For the rest of us scary picture fans, FEAST is exactly what its name implies: a sm&ouml;rgsbord of mayhem that offers no logic or explanations and spares the lives of few of its participants.

2615079,4,B000GLL1U6,"If there's one film from the 2000s that's guaranteed to tickle your funny bone as much as it tests your gag reflex, it's ""Feast."" Produced under the Project Greenlight umbrella, the debut effort from director John Gulager became a cult classic for horror fans almost immediately upon impact. With its tongue planted firmly in cheek, the film mixes ample amounts of gore with equal parts humor with purely entertaining results.

Almost like ""Tremors"" meets ""From Dusk `Till Dawn"" (and maybe a little bit of ""Roadhouse"") a group of rag-tag survivors find themselves trapped in a dive bar while bizarre creatures with an insatiable appetite for human blood lurk outside. With hardly any likeable or moral characters among the bunch, it's anyone's guess as to who will survive (albeit with a killer hangover) and who will be turned into pub food for the unwelcomed patrons. Will Henry Rollins lead the crew to victory in his pink sweatpants? Or will Jason Mewes  -- sans Silent Bob -- turn out to be the unlikely hero? One thing is for certain, there are a lot of characters and plenty of potential for unfortunate circumstances.

While the film is admittedly rather low-brow, it gets by with a lot of charm thanks to its script by late-""Saw"" series scribes Marcus Dunstan and Patrick Melton.  There are a lot of characters to sift through in the film's brief 80 minute run-time, and not only are most of them set up and defined rather well early on, but the pace never lets up for one minute, resulting in a powder-keg of horrifying action. Whether it's the over-the-top visuals or the constant feeding frenzy of action, Gulager keeps things fun and fresh, ensuring that you'll never want to look away for fear of missing something truly grim and/or gross.

With a plethora of visual gags that will make you, for lack of a better term, gag and a relentless sense of humor, ""Feast"" more than lives up to its name for lovers of b-horror. While those who revel in such madness will likely binge on all the film has to offer, those with a weak stomach and an even weaker sense of humor would be advised to purge themselves of this film immediately.",1357430400,,2141,4.713903743315508

2615081,1,B000GLL1U6,"Sadly, reading the SPOILERS in this review won't detract from the plot of this movie in the least. FEAST is a one note disappointment. If you like puke or gore, this is for you. If you want anything resembling a story, look elsewhere because FEAST has about as much plot as a bottom of the barrel Porn film. The filmmakers admit to staging it inside a bar due to limited funds; obviously so they could blow the majority of the budget on gore. Indeed, the blood is the unchallenged star of this film. To bad it didn't occur to them to spend some time on making sure the plot was worth seeing. At no time did it occur to the director, writers or producers to let the audience in on... well, anything. Not knowing any details on the origins or motivations of the creatures is often a given in splatter films, but this one takes it too many steps further. The whole film is as loose as a goose. For instance; when Honey Pie is told she should be a nurse, we have no idea if the comment is straightforward or facetious. She's been throwing up, but the tone of voice indicates nothing. This voice comes from off camera but we're never even given a reaction shot of the face that said it, so there's no indication of intention. When the same girl is seen climbing out of a barrel later, we're surprised; but not in a good way. First thought; when the heck did she get in a barrel? Second; who came up with this plan, because her character has never been anything but a dumb blond? Was she in collusion with another member of the group? There is no answer or angle that allows the audience in on what the heck is happening. Even as she takes off, we're never given a single shot of her face to let us know what she is thinking, so the payoff of being surprised falls absolutely flat. No info before, during or after means NO INVESTMENT; they haven't given the viewer anything to grasp. I see from the deleted scenes on the DVD that they cut out the final creature withering in the sunlight and running into the shadows. That's a shame, because the slam-bang fashion of the editing and plot leave us ignorant of how many creatures we're keeping up with (mom, dad, two babies - and so many creature smashing shots and angles we've lost count). Big mistake. This director apparently thinks it's more important that we be blindsided with a surprise at the end. Well, that works well when the script is a smooth and taut vehicle; but when it's a plot riddled with unexplained connections, thoughts, comments and motivations; NOT SO MUCH. We aren't even ever let in on whether this is a parody (a la SCARY MOVIE) or not. It's takes itself too serious to be funny, but not serious enough to be good. They run around. They yell at each other. There's blood. And none of it means anything. Who knows. Who cares. Not these filmmakers. The end.",1345334400,2,2825,4.403441682600382

I'm not going to say there weren't any funny bits, there were.  And someone said they didn't say where the creatures came from or why they were there.  Not true.

Yes... i think Wes craven, Matt Damon and Ben Affleck have some producing credits here as well. If you look at the cover you may be thinking that it looks like a freakin crazy  film with s serious tone but don't get fooled  by it, its mostly a comedy rather than a serious film. A very good comedy for horror fans!...and/or a creepy one for the others....

There is no background story here, no ""why"" or anything. The film starts with the bar scene where you get to meet the characters (it still makes me laugh...). A few minute later a guy comes in all covered in blood, he's identified as our ""Hero"" and tells them that they're all in danger and that some terrifying creatures are on their way to kill them all. Not even 2 minutes later our ""hero"" gets killed by one of those creatures and the battle for survival begins for everyone in the bar......

Its good... Its hilarious and its moving......The acting is fine, i think they choose the perfect actors for this. Cinematography is right on!  Perfect use of lights as most of the scenes are at night, outside or in the bar......appropriate use of colors as well, overall a very good picture quality. My only disappointment was that the pace of the film seems to be getting a little slower near the end and the creatures seems to become less scary than the were earlier in the film, some scenes with the creatures may appears to be a little cheesy but  it's not too bad and you should still be able to enjoy it for what it is.

This film is for anyone that wants to have a good laugh or any horror fans of course but it could also be a very good introduction to horror if you never really liked it before cause you were too scared to dream about it. You can laugh all you want but there is still lots of people that don't like horror because it is too scary and they don't wanna be stuck with those images in their head but at the same time they're fascinated by it....if you are one of those...call some friends over and start the movie . Like i said the tone is not very serious and i'm sure you'll have a good laugh through the whole thing.......and then.....who knows.....maybe you'll just be craving for more!!.......

Re: A bar full of characters in the middle of nowhere is attacked by a band of horrible creatures.

Outstanding: Throws a lot of the rules out of the window, along with some surprising characters in this goofy, gory movie. No one is safe, and the monsters are a creepy combination of hulking horrors and rags of bones and skins that are surprisingly resourceful. Also, Henry Rollins plays a somewhat dorky motivational speaker - That's pretty awesome.

Unacceptable: A lot of the actions scenes were filmed horribly. I don't understand why a director thinks they have to throw the camera around the room to make a scene exciting. Some of the humorously gory parts were lame, over the top things that made me roll my eyes.

Summary: I'd heard of this flick before, but never really paid it much attention. While the plot was something I love, I get annoyed with shaky-cam gross out horror pretty quick. But this had Jenny Wade in it, and I'm suffering from some serious ""Good Guys"" withdrawal, so I checked it out. It was pretty fun. It's saved from being just another splatter film by ingenious monster designs, some decent acting and surprising twists.

2615092,4,B000GLL1U6,"FEAST does for the monster movie what SCREAM did for the Slasher by creating an entirely self-aware Horror movie that cleverly plays against each of the genre conventions in an insanely bloody and wildly entertaining gorefest! The film begins with the familiar NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD scenario, where a bar full of miscreants must board up the windows and lock the doors to avoid being eaten by a pack of ravenous creatures. From here, Project Greenlight winner John Gulager drowns the picture in gruesome splatter and injects it with the sharp humor provided by the writing team of Marcus Dunstan and Patrick Melton. When the bar patrons aren't having their limbs torn off or their guts wrenched from their torsos, they are being blasted with fountains of blood, bile, or worse. FEAST had the potential to become an instant classic, but unfortunately it never manages to break free from its cheap B-movie roots. Though the characters are extreme exaggerations of Horror movie stereotypes, they are also completely one-sided and rarely intelligent. After an incredible opening, the meandering plot fails to achieve the same level of excitement and intensity of the first act. Still, there are many brilliant moments found throughout the film that are as shocking as they are unexpected. FEAST sets the table with plenty of laughs, buckets of blood, and gooey gross-outs, quickly making it a cult-favorite amongst fans.

2615093,4,B000GLL1U6,"Talk about your ""not fun drinking"" moments. Imagine you ar ein a bar and a bloody and bruised ""fero type"" comes running in while spouting off something aut them closing in. then all heck breaks loose as something - ugly, fast, and with lots of theeth - comes crashing in. It makes short work of some of the people, makes some nice fodder for some of the jokes that are playing out, and then it makes the people understand just how screwed up their night is going to be when they see that this is the baby - and they sorta poked it to death with sticks, knives, and lead.

When this movie came out, I really thought it would be bad. i recall the contest it won to get released and I remember the way that people treated it. They were basically hush about it - and that can mean a lot of things in the horror world o doom.

Feast did a lot of things that were great, however, and it was really funny as it tried to be and as it simply progressed. You got a little snippet on the people, for example, and it told you a little on them, how long they might live, and some other stuff. This was always off but on at the same time, and it made me laugh. Other things that made me laugh were the way the plot rolled out and the people tried dealing with things, digging that hole deeper and deeper as they did so. It was a beautiful thing, too - all the gore in oceans and all the people in a place they hated.
It sounded lke work, only some of them wer epatrons at the bar hoping to let off some steam.

If you like your horror quick and dirty, messy in the gore department, sometimes a little SeXXy in the monster realm (yeah, it goes there), then you might find this fun. I admit that expecting nothing and getting this shot its score up to a 4 really quickly.

2615096,3,B000GLL1U6,"Feast (2005) is a tense, offbeat, gorefest, that takes place in a bar, in the middle of nowhere.  The first ten minutes are spent touring around ""Boss Man's"" (Duane Whitaker) establishment, getting a look at the assortment of characters present for the evening.  A man then bursts into the bar with a shotgun, carrying the head of some creature, proclaiming that vicious monsters are chasing him, and that everyone inside is in danger.  When something crashes through a window, and tears his head off, it is clear that this will be no ordinary night.

The action is confined almost exclusively to the tavern, featuring a cast who refer to each other using mostly nicknames.  It is an eclectic group, but what they do have in common, is that they are all potential meals for the mysterious, fast moving creatures.  The first strike leaves a good number dead, or injured.  In shock, the survivors barricade themselves in as best they can, awaiting the next attack.

Different characters step up to take the lead, but their efforts are usually disastrous.  ""Coach"" (Henry Rollins) tries out his theory, that the monsters will respect a display of ""superiority"".  ""Heroine"" (Nari Rawat) leads an attempt at escape, only to become a victim of an unexpected accident at the hands of ""Bozo"" (Balthazar Getty).  ""Hot Wheels"" (Josh Zuckerman), rigs up some trick bait for the monsters, which takes one of them out, but has some unintended results.  Only ""Tuffy"" (Krista Allen), who's frantic efforts manage to rearrange the facial structure of one of the creatures, achieves substantial success.  Her final punch that finishes off the beast, is an intense and gratifying climax.

Judah Friedlander (30 Rock) does a fantastic job as ""Beer Guy"", who gets covered with creature puke, has maggots crawling in his flesh, loses an eye, and physically degenerates to a quivering mass.  ""Honey Pie"" (Jenny Wade), has some really funny scenes with ""Beer Guy"", checking out his deteriorating condition.

Clu Gulager had retired from acting, but returned to work with his son John, who makes his directorial debut.  The making of the movie Feast, was the subject of Project Greenlight 3, a twelve part documentary that aired on Bravo.  Thus far, there have been two sequels to Feast, both directed by John Gulager, and featuring his father Clu, as the ""Bartender"".

The extras include a short featurette, and a commentary track featuring members of the production staff, which is a mostly friendly get together, that is low on technical insight.  Lively, unpredictable, and with a talented cast, Feast is a pressure cooker type horror adventure, that nicely delivers some unexpected shocks, dark humor, and violently explosive, blood spattering thrills.",1269129600,,2733,5.085201793721973

First of all the movie has an undeniable cool factor about it. Henry Rollins as a second rate Tony Robbins, a Jason Mewes joke, and a truly funny self referential anyone can and will die at anytime vibe all in the first ten minutes which sets the table for a cool fun ride.

The movie involves people inside a bar and monsters outside trying to get in. Nothing more. It turns into a surprisingly action packed film for what is basically a one set Rio Bravo remake. Like Shaun of the Dead (Another better than anyone could of hoped horror comedy) the characters make the difference.

There is plenty of cannon fodder (Introduced in an almost too long for its own good style of captions rating the various bar patrons survivability), and eye candy, and best of all a surprising amount of x-rated violence. (There isn't a body fluid not featured in the movie. Finally an unrated cut that is truly unrated and not just an ""R"" with some deleted exposition scenes.)

The movie wisely never explains what the monsters are or how they got there. It concentrates on the real time survival of the bar patrons. Did I mention that anyone can die at anytime? Even your best horror movie watching radar will be put to the test as you try to figure out who among the rabble are the prerequisite hero and heroine.

Plenty of fun and action and style cover any of the rough spots. Simply a great B movie.",1257292800,,1578,4.427586206896552

...Words cannot even begin to describe the mayhem that goes on this movie, the brain-child of the Project Greenlight series and a collaboration between Ben Affleck, Wes Craven, and more-It hasn't been since Roger Corman's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Carnosaur/dp/B00004OCXU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Carnosaur</a>&nbsp;since I've seen this level of sheer violence and gruesomeness in a movie, and in this case, it's a good thing! But take this review as a warning-Feast is for those select few who can take all the black comedy and blood this movie has to offer.

Even from the beginning Feast has everything going for it, including excellent acting (Krista Allen is actually good in this movie!), a creepy title sequence, and laugh-out-loud funny and creative character intros. Think the hero is going to save everybody? You're dead wrong. Think the old, drunken Grandma can pull off surviving this movie without having a massive heart attack? Well, now we're talking! Although the action starts rather quickly, you'll know every character, along with their life expectancy, ranging from ""should be dead already"", to ""Who really knows?"" Once again-I haven't seen a movie get this creative with characters in a looong while.

Now enough about characters-how's the acting? Pretty fantastic, for a movie like this! These people knew what they were getting into, and they take all the vile liquids that are thrown at them repeatedly almost as if they signed up for the movie just to see how it feels. And like I said before-for a movie like this, that's a good thing! If you were an actor working on this movie who didn't like to be covered in blood & slime, then you signed up for the wrong movie bub!

But how are the creatures that spray our band of bar patrons with all of these liquids? For a movie with a relatively small budget, they look, along with every other special effect in Feast, super! John Gulager, the director, uses no CGI, going for the practical effect and making these...hungry things as realistic and voracious as he can. Pair that up with the frenzied pace and angles of the camera filmed the mayhem, and Feast rolls along at a breakneck pace doing everything it can to be the best creature-feature of its day. Will I see this again? Well do these creatures like to eat?!",1252886400,,2746,5.06858407079646

It's intense and fast paced nonsense at it's best! The bloody gore is hysterically gross and the excellent cast's acting is heads above most films of this nature.

The film has an excellent mix of comedy and horror and doesn't let up for a second of it's hour and twenty five minute running length. I don't get surprised often, but this one sure surprised me!...it's a total blast, but I would have liked to get a better look at those creatures....maybe that was part of it's genius?

From what I could see they started out looking like some old cattle skulls covered in some sort of skin, but then they morphed into something that looked like Venom (Spiderman's arch villain) covered in blood and guts? Regardless this is must see viewing for fans of horror and comedy.

2615104,4,B000GLL1U6,"Four years ago, when the first FEAST came out, I was pleasantly surprised, but a bit too disgusted to tell many people about it.  When I discovered that two sequels were filmed last year, I sat down with all three films and watched them front to back.  Here's a brief recap:

FEAST: PART ONE
The basic scenario: a scattering of rastabouts are trapped in a bar by a family of malevolent creatures with large underbites.  The characters try, mostly unsuccessfully, to find a way out without getting killed.  Meaning virtually everyone gets killed.

Because the movie is staunchly amoral, the gore is obscene.  Everyone from the jaw-chiseled hero to the helpless toddler is up for grabs, and in ways that are designed to make you squeam.  The movie helps viewers out by offering up stat cards the first time a character is introduced, including the probability that the character will be dead by the closing credits.  It's a bit of smart playfulness that makes the proceeding hideousness a little bit easier to handle.

Personal state: bemused, slightly nauseous, took two antacids, probably the pizza.  Four stars.

I'm not ruining anything for you by saying that one of the characters to die in the first film was a sneery biker chick referred to as Harley Mama.  In fact, she suffered an especially gruesome death (which is saying a lot), and now her twin sister has discovered her remains and is off an ill-advised revenge quest.  She is accompanied by an unlikely survivor from the first film, and together they encounter many spectacularly horrifying things including:
--a baby ... that's all I'm saying about it.  A baby is involved.
--every single bodily fluid you can name, one after the other
--the violation of a cat
--a liquefied grandmother
--and so on

This installment introduces a new character archetype called ""The Puker.""  See, if the creatures vomit on you, you either melt away after time, or the melting stops and you develop an irrational affinity for blood.  But not for the blood of other Pukers.  It's not THAT irrational.

The creatures are more clearly seen this time around.  They run around giddily, mating and eating; they appear to be what humanity would evolve into if all money and electricity disappeared from the face of the earth.  Meanwhile, our cast of characters commits all kinds of grotesque acts, all in supposed self-interest.  I guess if&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tucker-Max/dp/0806531061/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tucker Max</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/It-s-Always-Sunny-in-Philadelphia/dp/B0018RKEQE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia</a>&nbsp;have taught me anything, it's that these days it pays to be a raging jerk.  Or, more accurately, that most people think it's funny.  But I found it distracting.

In their attempt to top the first film, the makers turned the second movie into a pornographic satire of the original flick.  A catapult is created using the clothes of two breasty biker chicks who spend the remainder of the movie mostly nude.  A man ends up with a pipe in his head but suffers only minor swelling.  Except for the Mexican wrestlers, Thunder and Lightning, every character was viciously selfish.  The movie pushed the envelope until I had no more pushing room left.

And yes.  What did it for me was the baby.  I guess that was supposed to be funny.

Personal state: experiencing abdominal distension, some light sobbing, phone call to mother.  Two stars.

This is another immediate continuation from the previous film, with our gang moving underground in their quest to safety, guided this time by a mentally handicapped Prophet who has an unusual ability to ward off the creatures.  As it crawls through labyrinthine sewage systems, the movie achieves new depths to its depravity, including violence of cartoonish dimensions.  (Seriously.  Wile E. Coyote would fit right in here.)  At first I'd rationalized that the movie was offering a kind of social commentary.  In fact, as the third movie unspooled, I was reminded by what Dawson said, ""As soon as men decide that all means are permitted to fight an evil, then their good becomes indistinguishable from the evil that they set out to destroy.""  It made the movie seem smart again.

The ending, not so much.  It's abrupt, it's stupid, it's completely out of left field, like the filmmakers just said, ""I'm tired of this movie.  Let's stop.""  There's a tease about a possible fourth (and an amusing song over the final credits), but the whole thing felt like a shamefaced shrug to me.  As if the makers didn't want people to be too offended, so they finished with a silly little ""See?  We didn't mean no harm!""  When, of course, they did.

Personal condition: smiling, a little headachy, slight dry mouth, not altogether unsatisfied.  Three stars.",1240876800,2,5238,5.517587939698492
2615105,3,B000GLL1U6,"I've always liked the old horror concept of a group of people banding together in a secluded environment and fighting off an evil that wants to get inside and kill them.  But though I like this idea, I wasn't all that crazy about Feast.  I certainly didn't hate the movie by any means, but it didn't really make me wanna see it again.
In the film, a group of people gathered at an out of the way tavern are attacked by a small group of very hungry beasties that aren't too happy about having one of their own hit by a car.  We get the squabbles, the plan to escape, the gruesome attacks from the creatures, the one sourpuss character who's job is to make things harder for everyone else(I call these characters the ""Mr. Cooper"" of the film), and so on and so on.
I do feel a good job was done at making the characters not so cliche and making it harder to get a feel for who was gonna die and who was gonna survive.  I also like the fact that the creatures weren't CGI and that no explanation is given for what they are or where they come from.  Throughout the film, when they attack, they are very fast, precise, strong and deadly.  In the final moments of the movie when they are in close contact with the remaining characters, they seem slower, weaker and clumsier.  That's not a big deal to me, just an observation.
The thing that irritates the hell out of me are the scenes when the creatures attack, and most of the action sequences.  This is one of those movies where during monster attacks, the director finds it necessary to wildly shake and jerk the camera around.  I know there has to be a special place in hell for the guy who first started doing that.  Point the damn camera at the carnage and shoot it!  No need to wrestle with the camera.  Anyhow, I realize that this is a personal preference and that some folks may like this type of shooting(or just don't care either way), but hey, it's my review, right?  And Clu Gulager was in it, so it can't be all that bad.
Considering the state of horror these days, I'd have to say that Feast is actually rather good, but pickens are slim anymore.",1238371200,,2105,4.2853535353535355

Do you remember a little show called Project Green Light were up and coming filmmakers had the chance to make a movie, it was Produced by Ben Affleck and Matt Damon. I watched every season and knew that the final one was going to be great, that would be the season that followed the making of ""Feast"". Although the show made it look like all involved hated each other and the director in particular it some how spawned the absolute best film from the show, with out a doubt. This film not only turned into an excellent movie that is fun for the family but also turned into a franchise, imagine that. This movie turned out to be one of my all time favorite movies ever, as did the sequels that followed.

Out in the middle of the desert is a little bar were there is a group of not so likeable people, well most are not likeable some are decent. We have a horrible mean owner who takes advantage of his position and uses the job as a way to force a waitress into having sex with him. She has to let him in order to keep the job and take care of her son, another waitress works there along side an old grumpy bar tender. And then of course there are your usual customers there to take a load off and drink, and a delivery guy as well. These people don't know it but their lives are about to be turned upside down [some literally] when a man comes bursting threw the door, he claims there are monsters coming. From here we have a night full of blood, guts, sex [including the creatures], shooting, screaming, and over all a great time. These people have to survive the night and kill these things off while trying not to kill each other.

Director John Gulager and writers Marcus Dunstan and Patrick Melton may very well be the greatest trio in the history of film, no lie. John's direction is perfect and moves along at an amazing pace, things start up at the beginning and just don't stop. The script is magnificent and full of non stop violence and blood; this is a movie for every one. Producers Affleck, Damon, Wes Craven, Chris Moore, and Michael Leahy really know how to find a great script and superb talent. Who knew that putting these people on one project would result in one of the best films ever made regardless of how the TV show made the production out to be. No joke I highly recommend this movie to every one that enjoys a good time, and who doesn't enjoy that.

The cast was amazing as well although to be honest one of the main reasons I wanted to see this was because of Jason Mewes of Jay & Silent Bob fame, and of course Treach from Naughty by Nature was in it as well. Still they pick picked off early but the rest of the cast aside from hero number 1 make it a little longer and do not disappoint. The director's father Clu Gulager is cast perfectly as the bartender and he really is one of the best actors in this film, and his character only gets better over the next two films after this one. Henry Rollins is also one of the best on this movie and a far cry from his superman days, he really is excellent in this movie. Navi Rawat is good as well despite some tension on set [watch the show]. Judah Friedlander is very funny as the beer delivery guy and also gets messed up the most, poor guy. Josh Zuckerman and Balthazar Getty are good in this as well as Jenny Wade, Krista Allen, and Diane Goldner are great as well. Still one of the best performances comes from Duane Whitaker as the bar owner, what a jerk.

Still the main reason to see this film is the wonderfully bloody moments that arise through out the entire movie, and there are a lot. Where else will you find a child being eaten alive right in front of his own mother and where else will you find monster rape and sex. There are all kinds' extremely great kills and truly sick moments, this is absolutely one of the funniest and greatest films ever made. There is no way I can do this film justice with a review, you must watch this film right now. When the hero enters the bar at the beginning is worth buying this alone so imagine how great the rest of the film is. Honestly this is one of my favorites of all time, truly a top 10 in my eyes. Run and buy this flick now, matter of fact buy all three.",1235692800,,4199,4.224159402241594
2615107,2,B000GLL1U6,"Feast has an energized following promoting the movie like political lobbyists.  In horror circles, it's given a lot of attention and praise.  Billed as a gory, horror comedy, for the life of me I don't really know why.  It's a horror movie, but it's far from funny or gory.

Multiple people are relaxing in a bar when a man runs in weathered, bloody, and terrified.  He's introduced, and summarily decapitated by the monster.  His wife enters shortly thereafter and she convinces everyone to start boarding up the bar.  A young boy gets swallowed whole a few moments later.  More random killing ensues.  None of this is a spoiler, because the movie doesn't follow the majority of traditional horror concepts.  Other than that, however, the only other positive is the acting, which is pretty good for such a low-end movie, despite the fact that none are good enough to elicit any concern from the audience.

The monsters are dark, loosely resembling gargoyles, but they're barely seen.  The gore is mediocre at best.  The lighting was done by Stevie Wonder.  The camera work, Michael J. Fox.  The comedic aspects were inspired by a lamer version of the already lame Carlos Mencia.

For me, the final verdict on this movie resembles the one creative aspect of this movie: the early movie freeze frame introductions.

Sure it's flawed. Sure it's full of your regular cliches. But the movie points out it's cliches, says FTW, breaks expectations and presses on.

2615109,3,B000GLL1U6,"I was excited to see this movie after seeing its production on the final season of Bravo's Hollywood reality show ""Project Greenlight"" because the director seemed talented and after watching a season of people struggling to make a movie, let's face it, you want to see what all the fuss was about.

From what I had gathered from the show, the horror concept was a tongue-in-cheek, fun-flik in the vein of Evil Dead 2 so of course I didn't expect sophisticated suspense and freight but I assumed with such a promising director, the film would at least make strides in campy horror. Well, this film ended up being beyond campy to clearly rushed and thrown together. With this movie being the director's first Hollywood film, and the rest of the staff having so many issues, it seemed like the film may have suffered, but if you're watching the movie beyond the blood and special effects you can see where something seems missing.

I saw this movie months ago and it's so forgettable I can only remember two things about it. For one, Jason Mewes (Jay from Jay & Silent Bob) has a cameo playing himself. Secondly, the movie could win an award for most unnessasary scene for the sequence where the monster has its penis cut off, which then causes it to wiggle on the ground.

They come crashing against the walls and windows.

The gallery of characters begin to defend themselves, with much gore and blood splashing the walls. Some are decapitated or have limbs torn off. And this is where the confusion really starts. You can't tell what's really happening because of the insanely flash edits that whip around the rooms and the people. Who was killed, who was mutilated who survived?

After half an hour of this madness I finally had to hang up. My head was throbbing and I still yearned to see one of the monsters in action because from what I saw, it was only a bunch of hand puppets, lunging and flying around.

Sure the film is quite plotless and there's no explanation of where the monsters come from but this does offer some good quality entertainment for the horror fan. The film co-stars Dwayne Witaker (""Pulp Fiction""), Judah Friedlander (Wonder Showzen), Henry Rollins, and Balthazar Getty (""Alias"") with Clu's brother John Gulager as the director of this movie with Wes Craven, Ben Affeleck, Matt Damon and Chris Moore as executive producers. The creatures in this movie are quite HP Lovecraft-esque as they are all done by animatronics rather then CGI and the gore effects are so over the top such as the eyeball ripping sequence for instance that you'll need an umbrella to prevent more blood from spilling.

2615118,3,B000GLL1U6,"I purchased this HD-DVD because of the price and I had watched the making of the movie during Project Greenlight.  I was interested to see how the move turned out after all the problems that were on the set during it's filming.  I'm not a huge fan of horror films, but this wasn't that bad.  The performances by the ensemble cast did a decent job pulling it off.  The directing was OK as was the script.  I didn't find the movie all that frightening or suspenseful.  I guess since I knew what it was about, it kind of took away from the suspense.  Not a bad first movie for Gulager's first directing gig.  The movie takes place in a dive bar out the middle of no where.  The bar is besieged by a group of aliens/monsters (not sure which) who are trying to get to the patrons of the bar.  The people in the bar must fight off the monsters in various ways.  It wasn't a bad movie considering I only paid $9 for it from Amazon.",1217289600,,924,4.163841807909605

2615120,3,B000GLL1U6,"""Feast"" is a B-action/horror movie and it certainly knows the rules of the genre it belongs to. Body counts here are larger than most films of that ilk and in fact the film gives us plenty of gores and deaths, plus occasional humors.

The film's story (which is very thin) is already familiar to most of us, especially fans of Robert Rodriguez films. Patrons are trapped in a bar located somewhere in a remote place in Texas, and they are attacked by some terrifying creatures. In ""Feast"" we don't know much about these creatures (actually we cannot see them clearly throughout the film) and perhaps we don't have to. The film is about unfortunate humans who deliver intentionally corny lines before they get killed, or in short, how they die, or survive.

The problem for me is, ""Feast"" suffers from its quick editing and jerky camera, which lessens the impact of each killing. Also, the film has more characters (and victims) than most of other horror films and all of them are introduced with profiles including their supposed ""life expectancy."" Some of the viewers would find them funny, but I found them a bit repetitious, as well as some of other jokes in the film.

I enjoyed watching the film and I think filmmakers including first-time director John Gulager did a decent job within the limited budget. It is fun, but with a tighter script, better camera and more original ideas, ""Feast"" could have been a more thrilling ride.",1208649600,,1434,4.751004016064257

I enjoyed the humourous introductions of the characters and when the monsters began to attack it was complete chaos! I don't think I've seen that in a movie before ever!

This movie featured a reasonable amount of humour, but thankfully not so much that it dominated the movie, shallow, but still likable characters, and a straightforward, but enjoyable plot.

Neither funny enough nor scary enough to live up to its ""horror-comedy"" billing, ""Feast"" came off (to me) as too much in the Tarantino-wanna-be category  ----  too much emphasis on trying to be stylish, clever, and or funny, and not enough emphasis on compelling storytelling.

The idea of the movie was great. I loved the whole concept of all these people being trapped while these man eating creatures lurk outside doing anything to get in and feed. The only problem was it was made a bit too comical. I was hoping for more of a scare then a laugh. Well except for the little creature that humped everything, that was well worth it. As for the creatures themselves they were really cool looking, once they were finally revealed in the last 15 mins. I wish we would have had more time to see them without their coverups on.

Overall I would have to say this was wasn't nearly as good as I expected. It did have it's moments but just wasn't enough.",1203811200,,939,4.211111111111111

2615131,5,B000GLL1U6,"Generally speaking, when movies are released direct-to-DVD they are crap.  The kind of crap that surpasses campy and goes into the territory where I never tread.  For the most part, it's a don't pass go, don't collect 200 dollars, go directly to trash.  Feast is, surprisingly, not one of these movies.

It was a project that probably should suck, beginning life as the notorious Project Greenlight episode that had a bunch of bickering, problems with management and it seemed poised to fall.  And it did, sort of.  Not having a proper theatrical run (at least at any theatre I've seen) and being relegated to DVD.  Having watched portions of the show and knowing a little about the history of the movie's tortured release, I picked it up on a lark, thinking it might be entertaining.

I wasn't prepared for the insane send-up of horror genres and movies that it contains in it short 92 minutes.  In the same way that Slither was a funny send-up of the genre, Feast presents a very simple story set up.  It's a bar, we get to know the characters in a slick character bio pause frame, the bar quickly gets attacked and Hero number one tries to save the day...dies horribly, so the movie seems to randomly select hero number two.

It's this sly wink and nudge that had me laughing throughout the film.  It's very easy to see the edges that were cut to film Feast.  It feels very indie...the kind of indie that's filmed on an actual indie budget and showcases puppetry and various ways to get by the cheapest.  But instead of being annoying, the cheapness actually made me love the movie more.

There's really not much to say about Feast.  It's bloody, gory, hilarious and a terrific homage to all the 80s/90s flicks that I grew up watching.  For those looking for a film in the same vein as Slither, this is a good, cheap choice.  And a perfect example of a movie that didn't get the chance it deserved, but flourished anyway.",1198713600,4,1924,4.559766763848397
2615132,5,B000GLL1U6,"Well watching the Bravo Project Greenlight series I didn't know what to expect from this movie. If you watched PG from beginning to end you'd be led to believe that John Gulager was the biggest idiot alive who stumbled on to a camera and go the lucky shot to make his feature film (his sales pitch was laughable as he basically played with his mouth). During the shooting of the film it was made apparent that Gulager didn't quite have the knack to set up shots. Then in other occasions there was other drama on the set from Krista Allen being to Clu Gulager being a complete jerk to the hardworking crew who was becoming frustrated with the project itself. Finally, there was tension about the budget of the film going from millions to millions and whether the film would ever make a profit.

No matter whether this was true or not is irrelevant now as ""Feast"" delivered all the goods in this type of monster movie: Gore, sex, violence, quick laughs. I don't think anyone could have written this type of film. I mean lots of movies have monsters in them but in today's age every wannabee director thinks he can do effectively....few do.

(Spoilers)
I love the surprises the film offered from what they do with the hero and heroine. Krista Allen is hot and even though she will not be remembered as a great actress she was a good pick here as was Balthazar Getty, Navi Rawat, and Henry Rollins
(played a good coward) to name a few.

The character development was there for the most part at least with characters that I cared the most while the expendable characters were quickly put to rest. The suspense was there, you couldn't tell me watching movie the first time that you knew who would die and who would live.

The ending was good as well. No matter what happened on PG (true or not) ""Feast"" turned out be a fabulous horror movie.

Currently Feast 2 and Feast 3 are in development and seeing how successful this film was well ""Feast"" fans are rejoicing in delight.",1198281600,4,1969,4.504201680672269
2615133,4,B000GLL1U6,"This movie was very entertaining.  The writing was top notch and I look forward to more movies from this group.  The only minus was the low budget special effects.  The plot is a familiar one - group of people stuck in bar in the middle of nowhere trying to escape from invading monsters -  but the scenes unfold in an ingenious and original way, breathing new life into an old story.  I absolutely loved that you never knew what was coming next.  Henry Rollins as a motivational speaker was a nice addition to the usual motley crew.  I also liked the written summaries that appeared under each character as they appeared onscreen - instead of at the very end.  Dark humor abounds with this cast of cliched horror movie characters (wheelchair bound young man, anti-hero, hero, heroine, drunk guy, etc.) presented to us with a twist.  Be prepared for some risque monsters (verrry different) in the UNRATED version.

2615139,5,B000GLL1U6,"*WARNING-spoilers found in this review*

Last year the third season of PROJECT GREENLIGHT moved over to the Bravo network. While this may have resulted in higher exposure, it did nothing to help the show which at this time has been subsequently canceled. It did give us a glimpse at what I consider to be one of the series more mainstream films. They chose to go the low brow route and went with a horror film. Adding Wes Craven (NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET) to the producing table and you have some credentials that should have guaranteed a great release. And so they have.

The show gave us a look at two first time writers and a first time director for a major film. It showed the trials and tribulations of getting the movie made. It also showed director John Gulagar (son of Clu Gulagar) searching for the safety net of his friends and family while being forced to make professional decisions to get the job done. What even he may not have realized is that when it all came together it resulted in something great.

The movie begins with a car wreck and moves across the desert to an isolated bar. This watering hole is current home to several characters, almost all stereotypes, that are there for one reason: to kill or be killed once the movie gets going. One of the funniest moments (yes the movie is a mix of humor/action/horror) is when each one is displayed with a freeze frame and subtitle referring to who they are and what their life expectancy is. My favorite was for actor Jason Mewes of JAY AND SILENT BOB fame under whose name something along the lines of ""not having lived up to his potential"" is listed.

We have two bar maids, one a single mother whose son is upstairs, a barfly floozy, a hustlers with a brother in a wheel chair, an aging bartender, a bad*ss owner, a beer delivery driver, a biker lady preparing to rob the place, a Marine, a pool player being hustled and a motivational speaker on the road. Nothing unusual happens between these characters save some mild banter back and forth. And then suddenly a blood covered young man holding a gun pops in through the front doors.

This is the hero whose life expectancy is the highest. He lets them all know that hell is coming in the form of 4 creatures, Lord knows what they are, on a rampage and heading for the bar. Their goal is simple: to eat anyone they find. When asked just who the hell he is, he answers ""I'm the man here to save your *ss"" at which time one of the creatures reaches in through the door and pulls him out to eat him. So much for life expectancy.

The creatures begin their attack with the smallest, youngest of them making its way through the bar. While doing so, he cuts a leg off the biker chick, peels off Jason Mewes face and wreaks havoc on this unsuspecting group before ending up humping a deer head on the wall. His undoing as this give the group a chance to shoot him and trap him in a freezer.

Ensuing mayhem results as the wife of the hero, known as the heroine, enters and tells them the story of hitting one of these creatures on the road after leaving their child with her mother. All she has in mind is surviving and returning to her little girl.

The motivational speaker (in a stand out performance by Henry Rollins) suggests that they kill the creature and toss it out, demonstrating their superiority over this low life, sub level creature. The result is an angry set of creatures whose child has been killed, who (in front of the bar customers) create another one and then launch their attack.

The movie works on many levels. It works on a fear level because we have the unknown in the form of these monsters attacking in what some would consider a normal safe haven. We have a claustrophobic world where the attack takes place in the smallest of confines. Applebee's this is not, it's a small bar. We have the threat of turning on one another as each person tries to figure out who they can and can't trust. And we have a movie about survival and what people will do to reach that.

For gore fans the movie is a dream come true. The blood flows heavily in this film. Severed heads gusher dark colored blood, enough to coat anyone standing next to the victim. Goo covered monsters dart back and forth as they attack. And one unfortunate victim is coated in something a creature spews out on him that ends up having maggots grow on him as well as change his appearance.

For horror film fans this one is a gas. It brings back the long lost creature feature that many of us grew up with. It was nice to see something other than a slasher or madman seeking out teens. The movie features adult characters and not nothing but nubile teens parading around in little or no clothing. This is not to say that the cast doesn't have its share of attractive leads, but most don't have to offer up all of their attributes to get attention.

The movie is nothing more than what it intends to be, a fun filled horror flick. It's not some big social issue. It's not an attack on the government. It's not a moral flick about the world falling apart. It is simply a movie about a group of people banding together to face off against a monster.

If you love horror films then by all means find this one. Word is out that sequels are on the way.",1191369600,,5249,4.387860082304527
2615140,5,B000GLL1U6,"I have to say I watched this movie strictly because Eric Dane was in it. And for anyone who has watched it, knows the joke is on me! That said I thoroughly enjoyed this film. Horror movies nowadays barely peak my interest, I rarely sacrifice the 9 dollars to see them in the theater, and if I am at home watching them and they are no good I usually end up turning tuning them out while I paint my toenails or turning them off in favor of the food network (Rachel Ray is usually scarier).

  I never watched Project Green light, so I had no preconceptions going into Feast. I did notice however that there were some big names attached to it like Wes Craven Matt Damon and Ben Affleck. All of which have some credibility with me. Some.

  It starts out with a little 8mm clip of some dude scraping a dead dog off of a highway, and than onto a darkly lit bar that is out in the middle of nowhere. We head on into the bar and there is a group of people, who are familiar in that sense that in every town in some seedy bar there will be one or two of these characters lurking around. I really loved the way they froze the screen, and described each person, what they did, and how long they had to live. I loved the names they are given like: Bozo, Coach, Heroine, Beer Guy, Hot wheels, Edgy Cat, Honey Pie, Tuffy, Bartender, Vet, Hero, Harley Mom, Drunk Girl, and Boss Man. They are played by a myriad of actors like Balthazar Getty (who I remember from Lord of the Flies), Henry Rollins (Who is the funniest one in this!) Jason Mewes (who plays himself) Kirsta Allen (who played Billie on Days of our Lives) Judah Friedlander (who is on 30 Rock) Clu Galagher (who is an old 80's horror alumni, as well as being the directors dad).

  The premise is this, and its simple, these people are going about their business when a guy bursts into the bar declares that they all must listen to him or they are all going to die. He shows them the head of the monster/beast that is coming after him...and all heck breaks loose. What comes after is some of the most hilarious, frightening, gory, brilliant scenes I have ever witnessed. Throw out what you know about horror, it doesn't work here. I laughed my arse off, jumped a few times; I was flipping glued to this movie. It is absolutely one of the best Horror films within the past 10 years, and I don't say that lightly. I love when movies take place in one location; it gives the whole thing a sense of reality and claustrophobia. It takes into account that you have to use what ya got, and that you have to rely on the people around you even if they are strangers.

Clu is quoted as saying once ""We need to laugh, we need to be scared, we need to hug our girl in the theater. It lightens the load of this crummy life""

There isn't much of a plot, just some people trapped in a bar trying to survive the onslaught on some rather unpleasant creatures. However from the start the film doesn't take itself to seriously. There is a comedy element that runs through a lot of the film, which results in a number of laugh out loud moments, which seems quite inappropriate baring in mind the carnage going on a lot of the time.

The horror is well done. Suspense and outright gore, together with few moments that are pretty disgusting especially if you don't like maggots! I thought the acting was pretty good and what there was of a script was pretty sharp (especially the comedic element). Its also worth baring in mind that this was made on shoestring budget.

2615146,5,B000GLL1U6,"And don't get me wrong - I consider ""Alien"" a B movie and one of the best movies ever. To me ""B Movie"" describes a genre rather than a level of quality. ""Feast"" was just fun fun fun in ways that Hollywood hasn't managed in quite a while. It has a cleverness on par with that shown by ""Scream,"" in that it plays to, and with, the conventions we know and expectations we bring. I mean, everyone knows how a horror movie or creature feature is supposed to play out, and this movie plays with both keeping to that tradition and dropping it like the cold wet rag it can be to surprise us and entertain us. I was expecting something like a straight-to-DVD video that would tell basically the same story in basically the same way as any other monster movie, probably with cheesy effects and maybe bad acting. I was very happily surprised at how much better than that Feast turned out to be. The characters are well-done and the actors turn in good performances (a special nod to Henry Rollins on that count), and the production style is really very entertaining, a good sense of humor underlying everything. It is graphically (and sometimes sexually) violent, but if you object to that you're probably not considering this movie anyway. And despite being on a limited budget, the monsters are done well, nicely grotesque, frightening and convincing. This is as much due to the director's cinematography as the effects folks' creations, both of which work to advantage in bringing these creatures to life. I recommend this movie the way I recommend American Werewolf in London and Carpenter's The Thing. I believe this movie was the result of the ""Project Greenlight"" program, so horror fans looking for a little deviation from the standard predictable Hollywood approach to these kinds of movies should definitely support this film, send the message that we'll be an audience for more than they think.",1185148800,4,1894,4.759878419452887

I'm not a big fan of all the super quick editing, but that is a popular trend, unfortunately.

But it succeeds as an enthusiastic horror movie despite (or perhaps because of) the severe lack of money and time available, and the constant presence of ""Project Greenlight"" camera crews.  Gulager put together a product that is definitely a B movie, but one that's head and shoulders above much higher-budgeted studio horror fare.  It helps that the script, while imperfect, has some great moments, and that the actors are generally at least competent.

One real virtue of ""Feast"" is that it just keeps moving.  At 85 minutes, you don't have time to stop and think about the plot holes too much.  It's a rocket on rails from start to finish.  One way ""Feast"" keeps moving is the unique way in which we ""meet the meat.""  Some viewers will hate it.  I liked it, myself; but that's purely a matter of taste.  The first few minutes are entertaining and get a lot of the exposition out of the way fast.

2615158,4,B000GLL1U6,"""Feast"" stands apart from other recent horror movies by finding the right mix of comedy and gore. So often we find these thrillers taking themselves far too seriously, or not seriously enough. Feast doesn't play the ""False-scare"" card either, relying more on intensity rather than fear.

In fact, ""Feast"" really isn't that scary. This movie is more fun than fright. It starts off with the shoveling up of a severed monster head, then shows us the title. We are then taken to a bar in the middle of nowhere, desert style, with regulars as irregular as they come.

It is these characters that make watching ""Feast"" such a treat. They are all introduced with a short bio, complete with life expectancies. Yeah, it's that kind of film. I was happy enough watching the deadbeat cast of alcoholics go through their nightly routine, completely oblivious to their impending doom. It takes its time until the action hits and when it does, it doesn't take too many breaks.

The mayhem drops on you like a ton of bricks. This movie is meant t be watched with the volume loud. It is made more interesting with the monsters. So often a low budget, used cleverly, can be more of an omen than a burden. The less you see of these monsters, the more it works. We are on lockdown in this bar and know as much as they do. And it's not so much how these monsters look, more what they do!

In order of creative gore, this ranks fairly high. Not too over the top, but almost everyone gets knocked off in an interesting way. And hosts a monster kill any feminist would be proud of! This film can be surprisingly sexual.

The women have the lead throughout, while the men are mostly idiotic, which makes watching the interplay inside the bar priceless at times. Henry Rollins' character, a motivational speaker (who doesn't seem to take his own advice) gives great lines like ""we need to think outside the box"" and ""this is a clash of species"".

Maybe the clash of species that is really taking place is that of the sexes. Maybe not. Maybe we aren't supposed to think too hard about ""Feast"" which is why it is good fun to watch. Fun monsters, plus murders of characters we seem to have known all our lives is what makes us keep watching this camp movie for the 2000's with smiles.",1177459200,6,2256,4.503667481662592

(im sure there is more to it than that but you get the point). cgi just doesnt feel as personal to me. i mean watch some of the making of videos of some of the older horror classics like the thing or dawn of the dead trilogy or alien/aliens. you could tell that these people cared so much about their product and busted their chops to make it to as close to real as possible. and in the end i think that piece of heart and soul the filmakers put into their product really shines through. thats what the effects were like in this movie. cool looking, nothing fancy, but well made. this movie i felt had a lot more character to it than half the movies out there now a days like i know what you did last summer trilogy (i cant believe they made a 3rd one) cry-wolf, continual sequals of final destination, etc. i mean don't get me wrong, these are pretty much all popcorn movies, which theres nothing wrong with that really. i guess everyone goes to the movies for one reason and thats to be entertained, and these movies i guess serve their purpose. the difference is do you want to leave the theater like:

1: yeah that was good

or

2: I CANT BELIEVE THAT, THAT WAS AWESOME!!!!

this movie i think falls in the 2 catagory for me. it might be in the 1 catagory for some others. it might not have the most earth shatteringly original story line (we have been making movies for about 100 years or so<---historical accuracy questionable----so pretty much all the fresh ideas are takin and have been done before)but this movie had enough fresh ideas, and innovations to differenciate this film from the others out there and it did make me truly enjoy myself for the 90 minutes it took to watch this film, and the next 180 minutes of repeat viewings.

2615161,4,B000GLL1U6,"""Feast"" is a hybrid film, part comedy and mostly horror, set in a single location, a bar in the middle of nowhere. We begin by meeting most of the characters, complete with brief on-screen biographies a la the end of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Animal-House/dp/B0000A02TZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Animal House</a>. These biographies include such helpful information as the characters' life expectancies and trivia (as, for example, for the bartender, who was once bitten by a squirrel). The information, as it turns out, is not entirely accurate.

The deliberate humor is strong evidence that the filmmakers approached ""Feast"" with a high degree of irreverence. And yet there is clearly affection for the genre here, too, and the combination works for the most part. Once the plot starts in earnest, the movie moves at a rapid pace, pausing only briefly for breath a few times.

The plot is simple. Into a bar one night comes a man holding the head of some sort of very frightening-looking monster. A dull night at a hole-in-the-wall bar is about to change. What follows is about an hour and a half of the worst night of any of the characters' lives as the creatures attack, kill, eat, copulate, give birth, and vomit on the characters. Along the way, there is enough gore to keep the most demanding of gorehounds happy and a few jump-out-and-go-boo moments that should cause more than a few viewers to jump themselves.

Certainly, the idea of a group of people trapped in a confining location is not new. But ""Feast"" refuses to play by the rules. A well-experienced horror viewer can often tell at the outset who will live and who will die. Those expectations are likely to be thwarted in this film, though. I won't say who dies, but the answer is that if you think X will survive, you're probably wrong.

In the end, the horror of ""Feast"" is not groundbreaking. We've seen most of this before. However, the filmmakers' attitude shows through and gives the film an edge, much as happened with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Scream/dp/630521610X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Scream</a>&nbsp;and the similar&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/There-s-Nothing-Out-There/dp/B00005NFZZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">There's Nothing Out There</a>. By not playing completely straight, by being just slightly askew at times, the creators of these movies add something that lifts their films slightly above similar films without the attitude.",1175212800,3,2562,5.76984126984127
2615162,5,B000GLL1U6,"A perfect blend of horror and comedy.  And with the horror is tons of gore.  Really no plot to speak of.  A bunch of strangers get stuck in a bar while a bunch of monsters try to get in and eat them.  There's a minor backstory as to why the monsters are there, but nothing as to what they are.

But, so what?  This movie is a horror movie lover's dream.  There are the token characters, including the pretty, hard-drinking single mom, played by Krista Allen; the mean-sprited but somehow likable Bozo, and the motivational speaker played by Henry Rollins.  There are more, and they are all great.

Feast does break some rules, however.  No one, and I mean no one is safe from being a snack for the monsters.  And as they are eaten blood, gore, and other matter flies, some actually getting on the camera lens (which I thought was a great touch).

Well, this flick gets so stupid you have no choice but to regurgitate a few chuckles, if your eyes don't roll to the back of your head first.

2615168,2,B000GLL1U6,"Feast (John Gulager, 2005)

Feast is one of those movies that has almost endless promise. It starts off great, introducing the characters in such a way that you can be sure the movie's going to start flaunting monster-movie convention right and left. And it does! The rules of monster movies go flying out the window... for the first thirty minutes. After that, however, things go downhill.

The plot, and a very straightforward one it is: a number of people are trapped in a bar by a number of hungry creatures, and have to fight their way out. With such a simple premise, one can do almost anything. And at the beginning of Feast, it seems as if John Gulager's going to try to do almost anything. Once we're past the point of introducing the characters (which is done in amusing videogame style-- Uwe Boll could learn a lot from John Gulager's approach), though, convention comes sticking its head right back in. Pretty soon, we're riding the same predictable rails we've seen in a thousand monster movies. A great deal of potential here, with very little of it realized. **",1172534400,2,1076,4.6878306878306875

Despite the low budget and no name actors, Feast delivers a fast paced, gory and wildly entertaining ride that undoubtedly deserves more respect than many big studio horror films.  Special Kudos to the film's first act, which has to be one of the most original set up's in horror history. The only problem Feast really suffers from is the formulaic structure.  Some reviews complain Feast lacks a plot and they're right.  The story is very simple.  An eclectic group of people find themselves barracaded in a rural bar while a family of deadly abject monsters with huge teeth lurk around outside.  What the monsters are or where they came from is only briefly explored but it doesn't matter.  The story is about the humans trying to outwit the monsters and survive.  Its substance comes from the sub plot which pits man against man inside the bar.  A couple of pop culture icons do appear, most notably Henry Rollins and Jason Mewes, but overall the cast is a group of new faces.  Fortunately, most of them do the best job they possibly could given the dialogue and deserve recognition for helping make Feast the entertaining gore-fest it turned out to be.",1171843200,13,1218,4.729857819905213

2615174,2,B000GLL1U6,"Ignoring its Project Greenlight history and focusing just on the film product at hand, this is basically a loving tribute to From Dusk Till Dawn: If that was your favorite movie of all time, you will probably get a real kick out of this. You are getting hyperactive action-comedy-gore here, no real suspense or truly disturbing horror anywhere in this package; if that's your preference for the genre, definitely, by all means, have a go. It's better made and more worthwhile than a lot of its competitors, though the first time direction is occasionally pretty clumsy and several scenes are poorly put together to the point where the action winds up having no flow. It's reasonably energetic though, has a few decent laughs, one genuinely great moment late when a character does something too few characters in these movies do, and some very likeable actors in both the main and smaller roles (though I should say Rollins is quite a major disappointment here). There's really nothing original or new in this movie unfortunately; almost everything is a swipe or tribute to an earlier better film, which is too bad. The most infuriating thing about Feast is that, for all its posturing at the beginning about how it will throw all the rules out the window, the script simply substitutes a second tier of the same basic character types it takes such pride in eliminating at the beginning: the end survivors are pretty much exactly who you expect they will be from the real set of characters once the script dispensed with the fake decoy ones. There's no really serious desire here to actually tamper with the formulas that basically rule the survival horror template; only a desire to trick it up to give it just the facade of something subversive or gutsy and different, which is too bad.",1169424000,2,1787,4.805194805194805

2615178,4,B000GLL1U6,"Being a pretty dedicated horror movie watcher, it was a treat when Project Greenlight decided to do a genre picture and the chosen genre was horror. It was the only season of that show I've watched the whole way through and the main reason for that can be said in two words:John Gulagher. From the moment this man with the great eye and the horrible confidence issues walked in to the pitch session with that bizarre painting(if you don't know what Im referring to you have to find season three of P.G. somewhere),I was transfixed. His obvious talent combined with his utter lack of ability to effectively communicate what he wanted made him some sort of a roly poly tragically endearing figure. Combine that with his stubborn nepotism and his need to avoid conflict and I wasn't sure there would be any way a movie this guy made could hold up to simply watching him try to make a movie. The anticipation for the final product after the season came to its close was insane. Those of us who cared were teased with theatrical release date after theatrical release date only to then hear the project had been shelfed,only to then hear it had turned into a straight dvd release, and then finally to have it released in a one weekend theatrical release(Im guessing to wet appetites for the dvd). When I was actually able to go see this movie in a theatre,I was exstatic. Finally after about two years of waiting, I was going to see the product of Mr Gulaghers insanity. Why it was never given a full release I'll never understand,because of being from the show,it had at least a small built in audience already, also simpy being a horror movie,throw some more people onto the bus. What surprised me though when I got to my seat expecting a full ravenously boodthirsty theatre packed with horrorphites(?) it turned out to be me, my friend Helga and about four or five other people. Maybe wide release wouldnt have worked-but I was positive with just a few dollars more thrown into advertising, it would have made its meager budget back in the first weekend. Anyway, you don't care about that... how was the movie?

Maybe anticipation taints your opinion...maybe. But if you like monster movies,irreverent humor,Evil Dead,gore,Henry Rollins,hot babes,Clu Gulagher(from one of my favorite horror movies Return of the Living Dead) well i could keep going but you get the idea. The plot itself is about as simple as you can get-a random group of strangers gets holed up in a remote bar and one by one are mutilated in several different fun/creative/unpredictable ways by marauding creatures from who knows where and who cares...they're mean and hungry(and horny)and thats all our strangers care about. Now I realize the plot itself doesnt sound all that original and it's not. When you go see a horror movie like this plot is secondary(if not thirdondary-?) to how the victims are eviscerated. This is what sets the movie apart. Characters are introduced with very funny summaries showing who they are,what they do and what they're life expectancies are and very quickly we realize that almost all conventional horror cliches are thrown right out the window(literally at one point).trying to predict who the next victim will be is like trying to decide whos got crabs at a concert for 80's hair metal bands. The sense of fun is almost never lost and I only turned out to be right about maybe one person. It would make a great shot game for first time viewers.

So did the movie live up to my expectation?Yes. It was wildly fun inventive gory well done atypical horror with all the right standard touches. Why give it 4 stars? It wasn't perfect. Horror fans at this point are used to low budget fare, sometimes that budget in itself forces the filmmakers to have to be creative. Many times that forced creativity becomes cinematic gold(Night of the Living Dead,Evil Dead,Blair Witch) and Feast is no exception. That said, the constraints of the budget show themselves in several of the opening action sequences. The first few monster attacks are filmed in that MTV style chopped editing fast paced chaotic mode that not only is supposed to add tension but disguise the fact that showing the monsters clearly would have allowed the audience to realize that yes indeed it is  a guy in s suit. Its understandable that Mr Gulagher made that choice, but the first few attacks or so over-edited that not only could I not tell what was going on, I got a little motion sick. Less would have certainly been more. Thats really the only thing that keeps me from getting 100% behind the movie, but 95% aint bad.

Basic point, truly energetic irreverent gory horror is a rare commodity these days and if thats what youve been missing in the American movie horror scene-I cant think of a better example than Feast.",1168473600,,4789,4.738609112709832

First off, where did the Heroine learn those tactics utilized against the monsters? I could understand if they disclosed she was former military or something but you don't inherit that kind of skills by watching television. Second, exactly at one point did the plot of this movie begin? Did these monsters just suddenly materialize out of nowhere? Did they land in a little flying saucer???? Who created them??? I just don't get how this movie intended to move from start to finish. The movie began in the middle and ended in the middle. With that said, the acting was fairly decent. The women were hot, always a good thing in a horror movie. And the monsters looked really cool. Just wish they had a purpose for being there. Government expirament?? Finally, what is supposed to happen next in this plotline? Did the old woman necessarily have something to do with the monsters? Did they kill her and then move on to other places? The deleted scenes were okay but if the alternate ending where the sunlight killed the monsters had been used, perhaps this film could have enjoyed a more detailed and viable storyline. The movie had a few interesting points and lots of blood. But overall you end up feeling like you had a sizzling steak and no cold beer: INCOMPLETE!!!!!",1167523200,3,1421,4.688
2615186,1,B000GLL1U6,"**WARNING:  SPOILERS**

I keep reminding myself to be as generous as possible when reviewing honest efforts to produce something either of quality or of interest.  And I think this movie is an honest effort to produce a schlocky, gory horror movie.  It delivers so little beyond the cheap ""ews"" of spewing filth that even generosity fails.

Clearly, the filmmakers are trying hard to point out and then subvert horror conventions.  Trying to subvert convention is not enough of a reason to make a movie.  I can't imagine that anyone read this script and then, from among the hundreds or thousands that are submitted to Project Greenlight,  chose it because it was the best. It defies all probability. This is a dreadfully told story.

It starts dreadfully.  Beginning by giving us text backstories for the main characters, telling us certain characters were going to survive, other were going to die, then doing the exact opposite was not startling; it was not clever; it was not funny.  It was just dumb.  Especially the 2nd and 3rd times.  And why have Jason Mewes playing himself in this movie, only to have him killed off after he utters two sentences?  They didn't even play it up: Hey, this is REALLY Jason Mewes having his face ripped off!  Dumb.

It continues dreafully.  Oh, surprise:  No one's cell phone works.  And the one phone in the whole joint is a payphone, and it gets shot.  There are enough cutesy lines in this that make me wonder if this was originally meant to be a comedy horror along the lines of Army of Darkness (where the cute line worked).  Much of the gore is so excessive, too, that it's self-parodying.  But all the self-referential stuff just comes off as self-conscious attempts at cleverness.

And why, if a baby monster can punch through the metal of a chest freezer, can the adult monsters (standing, oh, a modest 7 feet tall) not get through the flimsily boarded windows?  Narrative inconvenience?

It ends dreadfully, namely, without giving us any information whatsoever about the creatures.  Why do these marauding things suddenly appear?  Why are they killing people?  Why do they wear cows' skulls?  I guess these sorts of things don't matter in a self-consciously clever movie that is trying to subvert horror convention:  You can just say, ""We don't have to explain these things; we're subverting convention.""

Everyone says these monsters flew.  I guess I dozed during that shot, because I don't remember it.  I'll take your word for it, though.

Whoever greenlighted this one must have done so because it would have been a cheap movie to make, and therefore, as a horror flick,  almost certain at least to make its money back in DVD rentals.

It's a shame that so many crummy horror movies are being made.  Skip this one, and wait for The Descent--it's a horror flick with a story, decent characters (and gore).",1166745600,8,2857,4.804526748971194

These are somewhat tongue in cheek.  Then a stranger arrives and says trouble is on the way and that they need to lock down the bar.  Trouble does arrive in spades a few moments later in the form of very violent creatures.

Most of the rest of the movie is taken up by the survivors trying to continue to be survivors.  This is accomplished with lots of action and tension.  Near the end we get our best look at one of the creatures.

There is no explanation or reason for the events in this film.  We don't know anything about the creatures other than that they have some level of intelligence and are very violent.  The action was filmed in very jumpy digital giving it a look a bit like 28 Days.  I don't think it worked well as just too much of the film was jumpy.  All in all it was pretty mindless (no plot, after all) and violent.  If all you want to see is violence without plot (sort of like some video games) then this is the movie for you.

FEAST moves a long at a rapid clip but ultimately progresses very little.  The opening is interesting, especially when we see what happens to HERO right off the bat, but then it downgrades into a somewhat predictable slayride.

None of the characters were truly given the chance to come to life.  They served the needs of the role, but little else.  The tags identifying the characters were humorous and well done, I thought, but that was really about as much characterization as you got.

The special effects were good, and there was plenty of gore to spread around.  The bar felt real because I've been in that part of the country and seen plenty of them just like it.  The fact that the movie was shot almost entirely within the bar and maintained suspense is credit to the director and the actors.

FEAST is a good buddy flick for a night when you don't really want to get heavily involved in something but would like an hour and a half of diversion.

2615198,5,B000GLL1U6,"First time director John Gulager takes the helm of what could have been an overly prosaic and boring B style horror flick, and instead steers himself into fame with a tour de force of blood, guts, and black comedy that should sate even the most jaded of gore hounds.  The premise of Feast is as simple as it is effective.  Average joes from all walks of life are barricaded inside a bar while monstrous hungry beasts try to get in and eat everyone.  No attempt is made to explain where these creatures originate or even what they truly are, and this is on purpose.  Feast breaks down all the horror genre's standard attributes into its component parts and drops all the extraneous pieces by the wayside, focusing solely on the parts that matter - the setting, the antagonists, and the gore.  The characters themselves aren't even graced with actual names; they are simply referred to by their genre cliche characterizations.  Nancy and Glen, Brenda and Jack have all been replaced with ""Beer Guy"", ""Bozo"", ""Hero"", and ""Honey Pie"".  The lack of setup and background story actually works in the films favor.  Who needs to see twenty-five minutes of a bunch of teen kids taking a road trip down the great American highway when we know they are all going to end up getting gutted by the end of the movie anyway?  Feast capitalizes on the fact that people want to see the actual gutting more than the bantering of annoying and oversexed characters.  Unfortunately this approach does lead to the films only real flaw.  As there is no emotional attachment to any given character, no one is going to find themselves screaming, crying, or even being slightly moved by anything in the film.  However, it's obvious Feast isn't trying to connect with the viewers in any meaningful way, it's just trying to entertain, which it does superbly.

The gore in Feast might as well be a character in the movie all it's own.  It is both ever present and extremely well done.  Limbs will be removed, blood will spurt by the gallon, guts will go flying, and by God people will find many ways to die quite painfully.  Feast isn't interested in pulling any punches either.  Just because a character is young, innocent, beautiful, or resourceful doesn't mean they can't be offed, extremely graphically, at any given moment.  Anyone who has ever found themselves wondering why the hell they can't just kill that one annoying or cuddly character in a slasher flick will be pleasantly surprised with the sheer volume, and frequency, of deaths in Feast.

While horror (or more specifically, gore), is the main focus of Feast, there is a good deal of dark humor.  As each character is introduced, a set of statistics flashes up on the screen.  The character's name, a fun fact or two about them, and then their average horror movie life expectancy is gleefully displayed without a shred of remorse or tastefulness.  It's all one big joke to the viewers, as it is obvious the characters in the movie have no idea their lives and rapidly approaching deaths are on display for a dispassionate audience that will find entertainment in their suffering.  Even the actions of the monsters and some of the kills are done in a humorous style, such as the extreme sexual overtones in how the creatures operate.  All comedic elements are done just right so that things never go to far and fall into the dark pit of Hollywood cheesiness, or not far enough and fall flat without being funny.

To put it simply, Feast entirely pwns the horror genre.  Gulager's off to a great start and I can't wait to see what he has to offer up next.

UPDATE: Years later all I can say is, for the love of Zeus and all that is holy, don't watch the sequels. They nose dive, badly, and aren't worth your time, even in a ""so-bad-it's-good"" capacity.",1163980800,5,3787,4.664156626506024

Namely, your time.  There is a lot being said of this movie, but one word truly describes it: terrible.  I only gave it 2 stars because Henry Rollins was in it.  And why Wes Craven would attach his name to this is beyond me.  If you must see it, then at least you'll be able to fully appreciate why Project Greenlight went down in flames this year.

First of all, it took 2 people to write 'Feast'?  How can 2 writers pen a script with no purpose or any semblance of a plot?  I'm all about pointless story lines, but at least most of them have a pay-off in the end.  Feast didn't.  I kept waiting to learn about where these creatures came from, why they were here.  It never happened.

The movie opens by introducing 10,000 characters, all of which you learn nothing about so you don't care what happens to them anyway.  So you say: 'it's just a gorefest, so who cares?  Enjoy the movie for what it is.'  Ok, but what the hell was it?  People keep saying this movie broke all the rules of the genre.  So what?  If breaking the rules means not having a plot or explaining anything, then what's the point?  Someone wrote that 'Feast' was reminicent of Toby Hooper's induction into the horror genre. (Texas Chainsaw Massacre)  Are you kidding?  Just because 'Feast' was filmed in the desert doesn't make it an instant horror classic.

Screw all those silly horror movies coming out these days that can't be creative enough to break from the one dead teen, two dead teen, three dead teen format... and those worthless PG-13 scary movies that cut everything they can so that teenagers can get into the theatre and give them their money.

FEAST is gory. Outrageous. UNRATED and unpredictable. BRAV-frickin-O!!

My only complaint is that it was too short, but FEAST is non-stop, creative, explosive, intense and unpredictable from opening to closing credits.

FEAST is not just a GORY movie though. That's why it merits 5 stars. It's creative and unique. It WILL shock you, because it does things that most movies (horror & non-horror) are afraid to do, be unpredictable. Most importantly, FEAST is not afraid to offend or do things that audiences may not like to see. It does them, and it gets the desired emotion. Ultimately, the point of movies isn't just to satisfy people and make them happy, it's to get EMOTIONS out of people, bad or good.

FEAST will make you laugh, it will freak you out and it will entertain. It's the kind of movie that JADED movie goers have been complaining that they've wanted to see for years... and here it is.

The beer guy has some funny lines, but maybe not as good as Henry Rollins as a poor mans Tony Robbins. He nails it as a bad motivational speaker who later in the movie finds himself wearing pink sweat pants-classic. The action is fast and  when the monsters are not wreaking havoc the movie turns to humour to fill the void, which makes this a constant riot. This movie won't test your iq, but its one of those movies that is so enjoyable to watch. All the characters seem to have completely different personalities as well. The way the people are introdiced to the viewer is also interesting, but you will be surprised who goes and who stays. I only wished Navi Rawat had stayed a little longer!

2615203,3,B000GLL1U6,"The siege story in horror films is a very solid one.  You have your group of dysfunctional characters in an enclosed place (anything from a roadhouse to a spaceship), getting picked off one by one by the nasty thing or things outside.  It, the Terror from Beyond Space, The Thing, the Alien movies, Dog Soldiers, Evil Dead, etc.  All are good movies that have benefitted from the premise or formula.  The problem with Feast is that it is so obviously following that formula, almost in a connect the dots way, while at the same time winking at the viewer, as if saying we're in this for the laughs.  Well, that can get annoying after a short while, since it never really allows you to relate to the characters, even in a fun B-movie way.  Right from the start, you are given profiles of each character, as if they're fulfilling a horror movie ""type"" (hero, bimbo, dork, rebel, threatened child, etc.).  I suppose this is meant to pick up on the whole video game thing that can now be found in some horror movies (Resident Evil, Doom). But this is a far cry from a movie, like for example The Evil Dead, which is funny, but also frightful.  The humor in Evil Dead unfolds on its own, without having to lead the viewer by the hand or jabbing an elbow into the ribs, saying ""laugh here.""

All movies are calculating to some extent, but Feast seems to cross a line, and as a result leaves the viewer on the outside watching the minutes of the film tick by, rather than on the inside where they should be, with the characters and their ordeal.  That said, there are some truly funny moments in Feast.  My favorite was the fate of the square-jawed Kurt Russell look-a-like (a deliberate, in a good way, move by the director).  And then there was Honey Pie's escape, which was also very funny.  But the monsters are pretty weak, and the frenetic camera work does nothing to add to their frightfulness.  So, if you watch this, be prepared to Feast on the possibilities rather than the end product.",1163203200,4,1988,4.486111111111111
2615204,3,B000GLL1U6,"Ooooh! Wes Craven. Ben Affleck. Matt Damon. Attaching those guys to Feast must mean it's an awesome movie, no? Uh...well...no. It's good B-ish Horror flick. Just like the recent Horror satire Slither.

In fact, Feast could be the prequel or sequel to Slither. I.e. the Slither worms mutate, like the Tremors worms from Tremors 1 to Tremors 2, into the Feast Beasts. Then the mutated worms head to the desert and find this bar with a bunch of B actors in it and try to eat them. Kewwwel.

And is W. Earl Brown (that guy in HBO's Deadwood who's Swearengen's heavy-set henchman) the spittin' image of Duane Whitaker (Boss Man in Feast) or what? Dang. I lost a bet with my wife; I swore that Boss Man was Brown. Um...no. My wife gets a free day of shopping (I would have gotten just a free day).

Funny thing is that Whitaker was in From Dusk Till Dawn 2, and Feast also reminded me very much of From Dusk Till Dawn (the original with George Clooney et al). Except From Dusk Till Dawn was a 4-star flick; contrary to the average review at the time of this writing, Feast is less than a 4-star movie...for sure. But entertaining nonetheless.

The special effects in Feast are college filmfest caliber, but effective. There are some scares and some laughs. As I said, the acting is B at best.

Feast is a good hour and 20 minutes of wasted time. Big names (Affleck, Damon, Craven) attach themselves to a straight to DVD release for some extra beer money and it pays off....I'm sure they'll all be able to go out and pick up a few sixes with the proceeds from Feast.

Feast is a worthy rental for those into the genre with nothing better on the docket.",1163116800,,1645,4.412541254125412
2615205,5,B000GLL1U6,"This is one of my favorite sleazy horror movies. It's all about people getting stuck in a tavern and trying to not get eaten by creatures that are never explained, which I think is a good thing, in American films, we get so caught up in why that we forget the what. I HATE CGI, most CGI are totally out of sync. I mean the tones and light don't match up with the background and ends up looking like someone cut and pasted it in. This movie takes just about every horror cliche and trashes it. Oh, yeah, and the girls kick more butt than the guys. I mean, the heroine killed the last monster in such an over the top, totally not female-like way. My favorite cliche? Ok, it's not a cliche, it's more like something you see a lot in survival flicks. In most flick towards the end of the movie, the survivors get in their cars and ride off into the sunset with happy rock music playing in the background. In Feast, they get in their car and start to ride off into the sunset and happy rock music plays (Never Gonna Kill Us). Suddenly, their car stalls, the happy rock music stops. Heroine 2 gets out of the car and they manage to get the car going again. And off into the sunset they go. Resume happy rock music. This movie is not for the faint of heart. It is for die hard horror fans who understand the rules and want to see them broken. There's maggots, decapitation, head explosion, rotting, ect. They even use one of the charas as a battering ram! Another reason you should watch this film: the only film out there were Donkey Kong is being used as a battle technique. Also, go buy the cd, it's great.",1163030400,2,1602,4.238562091503268

The gore and violence are awesome throughout. The women are SEXY, and the monsters are way cool. As for the disc features, the commentary is mainly the key players joking around, offering very little in terms of technical or story background.

2615208,2,B000GLL1U6,"How do you mess this one up?---:a bunch of townies drinking it up in a little hole-in-the-wall bar on the dusty side of Nowhere, on a night when the hellwind comes yowling across the prairie like all the Demons of the Pit are on shoreleave and hungry for blood.

A few quick cuts lay down some dead-eye head-on car holocaust somewhere out on the highway, and a quick glimpse over the horizon---is that a plume of smoke rising up over the high desert in the darkening sky?---suggests something bad is on the rise, and very close by.

And Hungry. Oh yes.

It gets no simpler, does it, boys and girls---almost campfire tale Simple: men & women, trapped. Besieged. Outside their tiny clutch of safety lurk huge, hungry, darksome things, that lust for their flesh and blood. Monsters on the Outside, Dinner on the Inside.

And astonishingly, even with this primal recipe for good old-fashioned deep-nougaty chewy-delicious horror, director John Gulager & Company manage to botch it.

And that's just sad. I *wanted* to love ""Feast"", and for about 15-glorious minutes---all front-loaded, which is astoundingly, sweetly generous, I suppose, in a high-school-nice-girl-paradise-by-the-dashboard-light sorta way, in that they could have forced you to have little burps of pleasure throughout the flick intermixed with hellish long stretches of boredom---but it's also maddening. Maddening!

""Feast"" desperately wants to be cool. It wants to be cool the way your 7-year old goofy glasses-wearing little brother wanted to be cool and 'hang' with you and your buds---when you had 11 years on the little guy. You know what I'm talking about? Sure you do.

And that's what's kinda pitiful, because deep down your little Brother ain't a contender, he's no palooka, he's not a slugger, he's no champ. He's your little brother. And you might adore the kid---might admit he's got a thing for goo and snot and disgusting creepy-crawly icky 7 year old kiddo stuff, yeah---but you also have to be honest: he's lame.

Same with ""Feast."" It's a nightmare, and not in a good way.

What did I like?:

1)Eric Dane does a badazz Bruce Campbell impersonation. Seriously: it really took me aback when he comes storming into the bar, all Ash-ed up, right down to the hair and the attitude. Hell, Dane even sounded like Brucie. Spooky.

2) Goop! Skankiness! ""Feast"" has lots of two things: Goop & Skankiness, and with me goop goes a long way, thus the flick gets its two stars. High Cuisine goop, too: maggots crawling about in green slime and burrowing into flesh, projectile monster vomit, squooshy suppurating flesh, an eyeball pulled out by its ruddy stalk (and that's just on*one* victim), legs blown off, sliced through, faces ripped off.

3) Navi Rawat (Heroine #2---or izzit #3?): Casting got it right with Clu Gulager (who can act in his sleep, and proves it in this flick) and Dane, but really hit the bullseye with Rawat. She's a one-woman killing machine: having her do her HI-YA! karate-fu on everyone who annoyed her really tickled my light fantastic.

Things I didn't dig:

1) Monster Design: sure, no CGI was used, it's all organic, blah blah. Whatever. The monsters came in two flavors: a) sexy aborted fetus or b)a kind of sicko hybrid Sleestak/Snuffleuphagus combo. And when all the skirts come off ""Feast"" wimps out, ditches the Undead Space Cow design, and goes he tried-and-true (and boring) way of the bipedal big-toothed big-headed alien.

Rob Bottin did far more on a beer-budget way back in 1981 with ""The Thing"", and his Thing, faced with the critters from ""Feast"", would laugh--hard---and take their lunch money.

2)Henry Rollins. What the hell happened to Rollins? He's all puffy, pasty, dons pink sweats, and looks like he belongs in 'em. Cut back on the nachos, Henry---seriously, man.

3)Everything else.

In the end, ""Feast"" is anything but: if you're hungry you'd better pack some snacks before heading for the chow-line, because pickings here are gonna be slim.

The movie really exceeded my expectations and was better than I had originally hoped. This may sound crazy but what I thought was unique was the dialogue. What dialogue you ask? There was a ton of cursing, but the reality is that's how many people talk, especially in stressful situations. I also thought the director really brought some unique aspects to the film that I've not seen elsewhere. Yes as others have noted, the movie was somewhat ""formulaic"" but there is plenty of cool and unique aspects. Bottom line is that it was a very FUN movie with some great laughs peppered in with all the gore.

I liked John G. on ""Project Greenlight,"" but this style of directing always annoys me.  It destroys the clarity of the storytelling.

That being said, there were some scenes in the movie that were actually beautiful...when the director decided to calm down and actually show a scene for more than one second.  An example: towards the end there's a beautiful shot of the blazing sun shining through a doorway of the bar.  Stunning.

The monster themselves are very cheap and poor looking, and there movement kinda reminds me of the kids in South Park. Watching them 'mate' was not a fun sight to behold!! I apologize for being so negative about this, but trust me, no matter how many buckets of blood and gore you dump on this, it's still just a standard run-of-the-mill monster movie.

At one point it is a comedy. At another point it is a new wave gore fest. It hops back and forth between both... not really sure which way it's going. Even with the ending!

The plot is typical. Set up a bunch of strangers in a claustrophobic trap and have them be attacked by a horrific bloodthirsty beast(s)and one by one kill them off til the hero/heroine survives. Done many times... some very well... others not so well. This one...????

The characters are cliche... they even have the dumb blonde who outwits the rest of the crew! The drunk, the old lady, the cripple, the testosterone infected hunk, the testosterone infected female... etc.

Low budget indeed! Who did they hire to write the script?

The only redeeming parts were the humor. When it was there it was quick witted, wry and full of irony. But it was brief... too brief. I have a feeling this would have done very well with a lot more of the humor thrown in.

The wryest part was the introductions to each of the characters... actually printed on the screen, with great jabs at creature features! The 'Scary Movie' series did much better than this overall.

This one didn't even fit into a 'grade B' category. I became bored. Probably most of you will too... save your time and invest it in something more rewarding.",1162252800,7,1315,4.546610169491525

2615216,5,B000GLL1U6,"""Feast"" absolutely blew me away!  Directed by John Gulager, written by Marcus Dunston and Patrick Melton, and executive produced by Wes Craven, Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, and Chris Moore, ""Feast"" is an over-the-top, balls-to-the-wall horror movie.  What a refreshing change.  The movie for whatever reason(s) received a very limited run at theaters.  That's too bad because this is the best horror movie I've seen since ""Slither"".

The set-up--although not all that original--delivers because of the non-stop action.  Each character introduced is just that:  a character.  There are no ""names"", only nicknames.  That's something else I rather enjoyed about this movie.  You are shown a frame of a character.  His/her stats come up, i.e. nickname, occupation, and (what I loved best) chance of survival.  That type of tactic by the director works very well here; he's basically telling his audience, ""look; don't become ""involved"" with any of these characters because I just might kill everyone.""

Several critics have said that ""Feast"" was just too simple in its approach to horror.  Take it from someone who has seen just about every kind of horror movie:  YOU NEED TO KEEP IT SIMPLE.  I don't watch horror because I want to see some complex story line that is next to impossible to follow, coupled with actors who take themselves WAY too seriously, followed by your run of the mill slice 'em and dice 'em end product.  If I wanted to be bored to death, I'd watch ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (Part Pie)"".  The director has put these characters inside a bar, bombards them with some of the nastiest monsters this side of ""Alien"", and never distinguishes between the ""good"" guys and the ""bad"" guys.  Good and bad are turned upside in this bar.  Just as in everyone's real life, YOU have to make that decision.

The movie stars Balthazar Getty (Bozo), Eric Dane (Hero), Navi Rawat (Heroine), Judah Friedlander (Beer Guy), Duane Whitaker (Bossman, and Clu Gulager (Bartender--and director's father) are part of a great cast. Henry Rollins (Coach) plays a motivational speaker and when he's giving his rah-rah about how to beat the aliens, well...you just wanted to strike him repeatedly with any kind of heavy object!

About the story:

A couple runs over a small monster looking creature and their car crashes.  The small creature was the offspring of two big monsters, so they go after the couple.

This movie has a lot of stuff packed into it hour+ running time. People of all kinds are slaughtered, devoured, and in one of the most disturbing moments of the film... regurgitated. Yet, this beast of movie takes it all further as it crosses lines left and right. Take for instance the moment when a female victim is oraly gagged by the montser mounting her... which climaxes with a very porn oriented gross out moment. There are really no safe bets in this film as characters you would expect to live don't and those you think would die... well, in most cases do... but in a couple instances, they don't. A neat little tactic was a pause on each character as introduced with a little fact-tivia listed by their face shot. It was distracting but in a good way... as some funny little one liners were mentioned.

Enter our ""hero"" all covered in blood. The patrons of the bar are shocked and he tells them that they need to band together to fight what's coming. Unfortunately, for some, they arrive sooner than expected and the blood begins to flow. No one in this film is incredibly smart but there are a few who have something going on upastairs... and of course there are those who are beyond stupid. It becomes a twisted tale of survival and then simply a ""kill em all"" epic... and the ones who save the day are the ones you may not totally expect.

For its pure misdirection of expectation... I give it 5 stars. I tell ya... one you see this one, expect the unexpected.

2615223,3,B000GLL1U6,"Feast has two big things going for it.

First,  borrows self-awareness from the horror-film-savvy characters in Scream (coincidentally, Scream director Wes Craven is co-executive producer here). On-screen text is shown as each character is introduced: ""Hero,"" ""Heroine,"" ""Beer Guy,"" ""Vet,"" etc., along with a fact or two about them and their chances of survival. The characters, however, aren't in on it, as they only reference once or twice how their lives have become a horror film.

Second, of course, is the classic, non-CGI goo, entrails and explosions that hearken back to the classic splatter films of the 1970s and 1980s. There's nothing revolutionary, but it's a whole lot of bloody fun.

Also, the wackier characters get laughs: Judah Friedlander as ""Beer Guy,"" horror-film regular Duane Whitaker as the twice-shot-in-the-foot Boss Man, and the director's own dad - Clu Gulager - out of retirement to star as the soft-spoken, foul-mouthed ex-Marine bartender.

Ultimately, the story goes on a big too long, and the characters are never interesting enough -- mainly because of the main conceit that forces audiences to look at the survivors as characters, not real people.

DVD Extras: The commentary track is amateurish, with lots of poking fun at the film and making ""Project Greenlight"" and on-set injokes. The funniest of the commentators is special effects wizard Garry Tunnicliffe, who's also the worthy subject of a featurette on the DVD. Viewers will learn from watching that the deleted scenes were wisely cut, and the alternate ending was best left alternate. Outtakes are suitably amusing.",1161388800,2,1609,5.290196078431372
2615224,5,B000GLL1U6,"Ten years ago I was pretty much just discovering the horror genre, and I was gobbling up the old classics at any chance I could get.  Unfortunately, the interest seemed to dissipate with my growing age, and nowadays horror genre flicks seem to be all be remakes in one way or another, utilizing new technology to make everything faster, louder, bloodier, and lacking any real imagination.  ""Feast,"" however, is a lone exception, and like ""Scream"" ten years earlier, another Wes Craven film has brought the horror genre back to what it once was.

Yes, ""Feast"" is bloody, and John Gulager shows he is not afraid to spray his actors (mostly Jenny Wade and the stand-out Judah Friedlander), the set, and even the lens, with as much blood and guts as possible, but they do it all with a smile, keeping the level light and fun.  Gulager has a great cinematic eye, and he's precise with every shot: he's meticulous, and he thinks them all through.  Every shot is pretty, despite the amount of blood involved.

Yes, ""Feast"" is frenetic: the camera moves fast and jerks around in a way that sometimes you're not quite sure what's going on, but ""Feast"" is also smart horror, which is has become oxymoron in this genre.  There are tongue-in-cheek stabs at the genre and its key players, namely by creating Stat Sheets on the characters, telling the audience exactly what to expect in some cases, and never showing so much interest that the characters are given real names-- in other words, they are merely pawns in a game, so don't get too attached to these sad, depressing creatures.  What was more enjoyable, and almost surprising, were the witty one-line zingers from just about everyone, but lead by the underrated Balthazar Getty who, along with Krista Allen, stole the film.  The actors took their jobs seriously, even when the film itself did not, and that made ""Feast"" more than just another campy, silly, popcorn flick.

Even if you are like me and read the draft of ""Feast"" submitted to ""Project Greenlight"" or saw an early test screening of the film, you should check it out now, as the ending has changed.  The DVD doesn't have the same effect that seeing it on the big screen would have, but the final cut of the film proves that sometimes a couple extra bucks for reshoots can make the difference.  Skip the commentary, though; it is mostly just a bunch of guys proving its their first time doing commentary and assuming they will never have another shot at it, as they just talk through everything and about mindless things-- no real tricks of the trade will be learned by listening to it.  Skip the deleted scenes, too; they are just short extensions of already existing scenes.  But the featurettes are worth it, and the movie alone was such a fun surprise, it is worth the five star rating I gave it.

If you like horror movies you know there is so much crap out there. These guys at least tried to put some new spins in their writing. We've all seen the monsters hunting peole trapped in a small space a hundred times before...ALIENS, ALIEN, DUSK TILL DAWN etc. But the dialog was witty and funny. Their were a few twists and turns on who died...it's all there. FILM snobs never like anything, ignore the bad reviews. Politics probably kept this out of the theatres.

The characters, of course these are cliche characters, the movie practically points that out to you.  Yet the movie is probably the best American horror movie I've seen in the past year.  I'll compare this to another movie I saw yesterday (I saw Feast movie just a while ago), that movie was another cliche movie called Are You Scared.  That movie compared to this movie shows just how a cliche can work well (as in Feast) and work badly (as in Are You Scared).  Both copy what we've seen before, but Feast revels in the passion, the gore, the humor, something that the other cliche lacks.  Yes.  Nothing new under the sun you might as well say, at least in the horror genre, but this can be a good thing or a bad thing depending on how you know your work in your hands.  The people that bring us Feast know what we want, know what we like, and presents it in such a twist that keeps us glued to the action throughout the whole movie...something that many other movies out there in the horror field lack these days.  I really hope that the director of this, along with the actors and actresses, along with the special effects people, go a long way and will be seen again.  The movie kind of reminds me of an early Stephen King (as in The Mist or Pet Semetary) or Clive Barker (Books of Blood), fast, furious, bloody, funny, and want we want in our horror.",1161129600,59,1446,4.350746268656716
2615227,5,B000GLL1U6,It reminds me of a up to date version of the Evil Dead movies.  A bunch of one liners and tons of blood/slim.  I digged the 8mm stuff at the beginning.  It was a cool little horror flick.  Check it out.,1161129600,6,202,3.8536585365853657
2615228,3,B000GLL1U6,"i bought this dvd yesterday night...

i watched it with my bother and sister... and I fall asleep not even at half of the movie... it's not that it was boring... it's just i was too tired. anyways the movie was quite interesting... good scares, blood, and suspense... and some humor too... i'd rate it more... but i'll have to watch it again...",1161129600,4,344,4.4603174603174605
2615229,2,B000GLL1U6,"This movie would have been a lot more enjoyable if they would have slowed down the action scenes so that you could actually SEE what's going on! It became quite annoying but not as annoying as the freeze frame stats on the characters. Funny at first but made me roll my eyes after awhile.

It, to me, was a wanna-be Quentin Tarantino ""From Dusk 'til Dawn"" esque film. Some of the characters were VERY annoying to me to the point I couldn't wait for them to get offed. *Possible spoiler* The ending bit with the creature getting ""arm choked"" was such a rip-off of the old 80's ""Just Before Dawn"" classic ending. SOooo unoriginal! I gave it an extra star just for the fact that I was entertained somewhat enough to finish watching. It takes a lot more than gore or cinematic tricks to get me to rate higher.",1161129600,4,805,4.402684563758389
2615230,5,B000GLL1U6,"This one of the best horror movies I've seen in a long time.  It's a hilarious, fast paced no holds barred gore soaked blood & guts splatter flick.  All you need to know is that this is your ""trapped inside/monster outside"" set-up ala ""Night Of The Living Dead"", "" TFC-Demon Night"", & ""From Dusk 'Til Dawn"" to name a few.  Great acting, a great cast (Henry Rollins as a yuppy wuss...priceless) & unlike most films in the genre, absolutely unpredictable.  This is the 3rd movie from the HBO series ""Project Greenlight"" with Matt Damon & Beniffer ""Yo, you was da bomb in Phantoms"" Afflec.  Rush out(or order online) right now to buy this movie to let the movie studios know that this is what we want in a horror movie, not some safe PG-13 ""oh no, it's scary when I jump"" half a horror.",1161129600,7,783,4.409722222222222
2615231,4,B000GLL1U6,"I am more than a passing horror fan, and this was the most enjoyable flick of its type I've seen since Slither (ok, so that was more comedy, but still fun). Others have pointed out similarities to other films, and this certainly adds little new to the genre, but so what? It has tension, suspense, a healthy helping of gore, comic relief, a well-defined host of characters. A truly unique spin on character introduction in this film takes place when all action pauses for blurbs to be posted on each character defining name, occupation, and life expectancy. Terrific creativity, not to mention downright funny. Tremendous pacing to the film. I was never bored or wondering when something would happen. Hard to tell this was a low budget film for the most part. Creatures are sometimes only partially visible or their movements are too quick to be captured for more than a glimpse, but this works to the movie's advantage, adding suspense and feeding the imagination. This deserved a big screen release rather than a midnight viewing then straight to DVD. Good fun. I'll watch it again.",1161129600,,1085,4.838709677419355
2615232,4,B000GLL1U6,"Project Greenlight's third movie is a blood soaked, fun filled, ..nightmare!! Wow!! I am glad a horror script won the Project Greenlight contest. This one was alot of fun! Besides buckets of blood and gore, this one manages to be very funny as well.. I liked the mojority of the cast, there is a few familiar faces mixed with some unknowns. I have to give high marks to the effects crew because the effects are really good, especially if you consider the low budget (about 3 million) they were givin. Our location is a remote bar in the middle of no where (sorta like ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" but less crowed) where a group of all walks of life are inturrupted by a man who bursts in holding a mutant creature head. He warns that these monsters are coming.. moments later they arrive and its non-stop madness and mayhem from then on!! If that sounds good to you, you won't be disappointed. IDEA: **** BLOOD & GORE: ***** ACTING: ***1/2 (points lost for Henry Rollins) DIRECTION **** SUSPENSE ****1/2 OVER ALL ****",1161043200,2,1010,4.554945054945055
2615233,4,B000GLL1U6,"I went to the store today to rent this flick. Actually I went to two stores and neither store carried this title, which probably means no store will because these stores were very well known stores. Anyway, I wanted to see it really bad, so I bought it, since I couldn't rent it anywhere.

This film has a hell of a lot going for it for starters. It puts all kinds of different people under one rough and they tell you that they are going to baracade the doors at the beginning of the movie, which means no one is going to be going anywhere and you basically start to wonder who is going to make it out and actually live through this movie. This provides for a little mystery at least.

As for the acting it's actually good. Henry Rollins and Jay from Clerks 1 and 2 and Jay and Silent Bob are the only people I recognize in the film from, but everyone does a solid acting job.

There isn't much too the story, but that doesn't mean it's bad. People die in many different ways and the timing that they die is very unexpected, which works a lot better than your usual low budget horror film.

The monsters are pretty scary and there are different sizes and different looks to them, so the variety offers some interest, and keeps things from being too predictable.

The humor is what seperates this from a lot of other movies that try to do what movies are suppposed to do and that is entertain. The jokes and funny lines of some of the characters come at just the perfect time and make this movie a lot better than what it could of been without the humor.

The only thing I didn't like about the movie was the gore, slime, and maggots. I don't mind seeing any amount of blood, but I hate seeing slime and maggots. I was willing to look past both of them in this movie because it had so much else other things going for it.",1161043200,3,1821,4.218390804597701
2615234,5,B000GLL1U6,"Yes, it's a no-brainer-popcorn-gorror-comedy, but if more movies were as good as this one I'd go to the theater more often and not feel gypped at the end of the show.  I was lucky enough to catch it in it's limited cinema release and I'm astounded it didn't get a wider distribution, as it could have done some healty business.  It delivers the goods that it promises, and that seems rare lately.  If you want to have a real blast, do yourself a favor and pick up FEAST!  I have a feeling it's destined for cult classic status.",1161043200,4,527,4.346938775510204

The plot (such as it is) doesn't make much sense - supposedly the military is behind the ""monsters"" but why is never made clear in any way. It has a few tense moments and likable enough characters due to the ability of the actors rather than any character development in the story line but that's about it.  If you like B movies, you may enjoy this one.  If you""re looking for something with a plot that develops and holds together with logical progression from beginning to end, this isn't the movie for you.
