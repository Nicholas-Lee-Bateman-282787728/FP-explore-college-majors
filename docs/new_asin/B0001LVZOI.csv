8014254,3,B0001LVZOI,"I grabbed this movie in the close-out bin, and I thoroughly enjoyed the story and smaltzy production values. Doug McLure is working hard to make this film work, and his acting shines, bringing the character alive. Co-Star Angelica Ott, is breathtakingly beautiful. The colorful scenery and sublime storyline-give this movie cult/sleeper status. The Fox animated series, ""The Simpsons"" would always parody the Doug McLure character and portray him as making forgotten-B movies that no one ever heard of-and this could certainly be one of them. Now, I get the joke. Regardless

it is an enjoyable view, and probably very much under-rated and swept under the cobwebs of time. Find it, dust it off, and enjoy. I saw a DVD version-which was pretty much a straight transfer with only Chapter Selection for features.

Grab it if you can.",1093478400,2,830,5.0510948905109485
