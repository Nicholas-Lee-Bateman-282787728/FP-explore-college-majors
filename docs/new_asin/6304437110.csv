7871295,5,6304437110,"The Galactica encounters a vast magnetic void in space, a Cylon outpost on a nearby asteroid, and a mysterious alien virus that has infected the crew. Eventually they find a cure to the virus and destroy the Cylon outpost. But now to protect the fleet from the Cylon baseships, the Galactica must enter the void which leads them to their long-lost homeworld, the planet Kobol. Kobol is now a dead world, but the remains of the ancient city of the once great civilization that lived there could show the way to Earth. But will their expedition to the planet be interrupted by a visit from the Cylons and the traitor Baltar?

7871296,5,6304437110,"This is a very good episode. It kind of gives you some of the history of the Colonies Founding Fathers, the Lords of Kobol. It unvails some of the mystique about how the Colonies came to be and how our Earth could have  been the Thirteenth Colony. This episode links certain aspects of Earth's  history to the history of Kobol. I enjoyed this episode a lot. I have all  of the episodes that are currently available on video and some of them are  lame, but not this one.",949276800,5,469,4.295454545454546
7871297,4,6304437110,"Lost Planet Of The Gods is the ""sequel"" to Saga Of A Star World and picks up where SOASW unwisely left off on exploring the mankind's genesis theme touched on in the series.  Without question Lost Planet  explores this theme with great effect.
The episode's superior quality is  something of a surprise, for it gets off to an incredibly slow start and  does not truly come into its own until Part Two.  Part One does have strong  qualities, notably the reintroduction of Baltar (John Colicos) and his  placement into the role of commander of Cylon forces, complete with an  aide-de-camp in the form of sentient cogitator Lucifer (voiced with  infectious glee by Jonathan Harris).  On the human side, there is the  engagement of Apollo (Richard Hatch) and Serina (Jane Seymour).
But the  Fleet encounters a spatial void, a magnetic ""sea"" that nearly  ""swallows"" Apollo and Starbuck alive.  Elsewhere, exploring a  planetoid that houses a Cylon outpost, warriors Boomer (Herb Jefferson Jr.)  and Jolly (Tony Swartz) contract an alien virus that spreads to warriors  assembled at Apollo's bachelor celebration, and soon has stricken the bulk  of the Galactica's warriors.
  This disease-of-the-week angle is the  episode's biggest weakness; I suspect producer-writers Glen A. Larson and  Donald Bellisario wanted these pilots incapacitated in combat (a theme used  in some fan fiction), but could not get away with it because of Standards  & Practices at the ABC network, which regualrly campaigned to tone down  the show's violence.
The stricken warriors are replaced by raw  recruits, entirely female, and one of whom is Serina (Apollo and Serina  argue over this, to good but insufficient effect).  Predating G.I. Jane,  they are seen whipping Cylon raiders over the planetoid as Apollo destroys  the enemy outpost; the chessiness of this battle, though, is countered much  later.
As for the void, Adama (Lorne Greene) recognizes it to contain the  world from which humanity first gestated; Kobol.  Upon finding the titular  lost planet of the Gods, Adama, Apollo, and Serina (now husband and wife)  explore two enormous pyramids, and eventually find ancient hieroglyphs  recording the flight of humanity to other worlds, including the Twelve  Colonies, and Earth.
However, Baltar has tailed the Fleet, and has landed  on Kobol in a vainglorious attempt to convince Adama and his people to help  him overthrow the Cylon empire.  Suspecting that the human traitor indeed  intends to so use the human fleet, Lucifer launches Cylon raiders to attack  Kobol.  The attack is harrowingly presented, with excellently booming sound  mixing amid superb SFX of Cylon raiders strafing the planet; eventually  Cylon raiders blast the tombs of Kobol to complete destruction, one of the  absolute best SFX shots ever put to film.
The performances are superb,  notably the verbal cat-and-mouse between Adama and Baltar within the  largest tomb; Baltar's roar vowing revenge when he is left pinned under  debris is chilling.  Also gripping is the doom of Serina; shot in the back  by Cylon centurions landed to rescue Baltar, she dies in the arms of Apollo  back on the Galactica.  Her son Boxey (Noah Hathaway) and Apollo are thus  ""left to face the universe alone,"" displayed as they sadly walk  away at the episode's conclusion.
The episode's bitterly sad ending is  bold; how often does any film end on anything but a happy note?  It is one  of the most poignant moments of the entire series.",928886400,23,3480,5.1125
