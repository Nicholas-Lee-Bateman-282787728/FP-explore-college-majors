3152831,5,B00166UFTI,"This season was excellent.

  I am sorry there aren't more episodes or other seasons, but at the end of the last episode, I felt like things were going to work out just fine.  (It isn't much guesswork with ""you have to marry Sarah, or the world will end.""  I won't say more, if you haven't seen the whole season to understand the impact of this statement - especially based on who made it. )

The new JJ was a brilliant move.  I think it would have been a better show if this JJ would have been there from the beginning.

I enjoyed watching all of the seasons from beginning to end.",1438041600,,582,4.18018018018018

3152857,5,B00166UFTI,"I think it ended well . . . . I agree with other reviewers that John and Sarah deserved more in this last season. But at least they ended it a bit on a cliffhanger . . . Another season? I also felt that if they followed the John and Sarah storyline, and the Armageddon storyline, they could keep this show going much longer.

3152859,2,B00166UFTI,"The series is great up until the last episode of this season. From the beginning the hallmark of the series have been: funny conversations, intriguing stories, the dynamic between Johnny Smith and his ex-wife and as a side-treat the main plot (visions of the Apocalypse).

I understand most series end sometime, and that many factors determine when a series end including finances, but to end the series like this is just not fair to its fans. It is remisscent of the ending of Sopranos though to be honest I'd rather like to see how THIS show ends than the Sopranos.

3152885,5,B00166UFTI,"The finale to a great series.  New producers, Walt is killed the first episode, which leads to interesting scenarios.  Little Johnny has been recast, and while the young man is a good actor, he looks nothing like either parent-so it's a terrible physical recast and quite an unnecessary one.  We don't see much of Bruce and for some unknown reason, Johnny doesn't explain to Sarah that he couldn't manage to save Walt despite saving him several times from death.  Stillson turns out to be an okay guy due to Walt's heroic actions in the first episode so we don't fear him anymore.  Johnny and Sarah's happy ever after is left unresolved however with the series finale.  Actually, hadn't watched the last episode when I wrote this, Stillson is still a bad guy...glad Sarah now knows John Jr has visions too.",1374624000,,806,4.7214285714285715

3152913,4,B00166UFTI,"I just started watching this show on a rental basis. Just to let everyone know this is a spoiler so turn back now if you don't want to know what happens. First off I think it was a bad decision to kill off Walt, he was more of a main character than Purdy, IMO. Purdy not dying made me mad, don't get me wrong David Ogden Stiers is an excellent actor as is Chris Bruno but Purdy's role was too crooked. If it proves anything in this world it's that the good die young to make the weak willed and those who create bad karma in this world look even worse. I did like when Janus was killed off, he was an all out monster. It just sucks that Walt had the good news of him being a new father and then he's just killed off, sucky. I think Sarah needed to realize that Walt was a great guy and she didn't need Johnny anymore. In the end I just felt bad Walt had to die, it was a stupid decision, also if they had killed off Bruce I would have been equally mad, he's cool. It's a really great television series, I only wish there were more of them like it around, this reality tv is boring. Good writers, good actors, just an awesome and well produced show except what I mentioned sucked. Now I'm going to buy this on DVD and let my mom see it.",1332633600,,1235,3.9838709677419355

3152915,5,B00166UFTI,I loved the show when it was aired on TV.  Did not get to see all of the episodes then. All of the Dead Zone series outshines the original book by S. King.  Have been home on medical leave and find that I am enjoying what I missed before.  Item came quickly and in excellent condition. Thank you Amazon for being there for us.,1324857600,,326,4.0625
3152916,2,B00166UFTI,"**** May be spoilers below ****

This is a great show.  Every episode draws you more into the story.  For a while in the show, Smith kept seeing the world ending.  In the last season or two, something happened and he stopped seeing it.  Then, in the LAST episode, everything went back to what it had been.  In a bad way.  What the hell is going on?  One cool thing about the last few episodes is, you find out a little more about the characters.  BUT, what you find out makes you ask yourself more and want and need to know more.  I was SO disappointed after watching the last episode.  I sat in my bad and just stared at the TV.  SO many things go unanswered.  Not just little things, I'm talking really important things that the show had been building up on.  Actually, I don't think anything gets answered.  Plus, I thought I saw an episode before that had Johnny being able to save Walt and decide if he wanted himself or Walt to be alive.  But, it was not in the last season, so I guess I'm crazy!  While the last season has good episodes, they would have been better if they went somewhere.  I am happy to own the series, but I will always be waiting for a true ending.  The way they ended it looped back to the beginning of season three or four.  If you like the show, get the seasons.  Just be ready for an ending that let's you down and makes you feel like you've watched the other seasons for nothing.",1314748800,,1411,4.171003717472119
3152917,2,B00166UFTI,"We enjoyed the first couple of seasons, but they stopped being so entertaining and more... Let's just say the main character became more opinionated and less likable.  The old cast was pretty much replaced with new folks that you don't have time to get comfortable with.
We did NOT enjoy this season!",1296172800,,300,4.769230769230769
3152918,1,B00166UFTI,"This was a truly disappointing, uncreative, and plain boring conclusion to a series that was growing in potential. The story arc that was growing in complexity was clumsily truncated due to what I assume was an impending cancellation. Rather than go out in a blaze of glory, they opted to  give Stilson a ""Road to Damascus"" moment and end everything.  I would call this a spoiler, but in fact, it spoils itself by doing this at the beginning of the season. The remainder of the season is reminscent of season 1, only more maddening because we've already developed characters.

I won't even say that this season offers closure to the storyline. Frankly, you don't need this season if you want to know where the story arc goes--it ends; abruptly, with leaps in character, and with little circumstance. It epitomizes anticlimax.",1276905600,,825,4.878571428571429

3152920,4,B00166UFTI,After the darkness that was the past season and a half. If you've been watching this series long enough that you are even thinking about getting this season then go for it. You will be disappointed but only with the fact that USA decided to end the series without allowing them another season to wrap everything up. They do a good job of getting the main story lines tied up but a movie or miniseries event would have made it better. Long story short if you've watched up to the 4th or 5th season then do yourself a favour and get this 6th season.,1263772800,,547,4.269230769230769
3152931,4,B00166UFTI,"Several of my favorite TV series have had final seasons this past year, and the Dead Zone was one of those. Kudos for the network for allowing the series to have closure to the story. It does leave you guessing a little bit as to whether Johnny and Sarah get together. That was okay with me because I kept hoping Johnny would move on to find someone else.",1261958400,,355,4.235294117647059

This series continues to intrigue viewers.  Sorry to hear it's finished.
Plenty of suspense and intrigue.  The only small detail that spoiled it a little
for me was that there was a new actor playing the part of Johnny's son.
If the 'powers that be' ever decide to continue on with another season, I'll be waiting.

3152934,3,B00166UFTI,"The Dead Zone series was excellent and when writing about the final season I must warn readers that I refer to events they may not wish to know about until they have watched the series.
As an Australian I eagerly awaited the arrival of all the seasons of The Dead Zone due to episodes being shown intermittently.  The first shock was the death of Walt and a replacement actor for J.J. But the big disappointment was the unresolved fate of Stilson.  To carry a story through so many seasons and leave it open-ended was frustrating and annoying.

Hopefully they will revisit the series to tie up loose ends.  But overall the quality was still apparent.",1255564800,,650,4.626086956521739

The last season is not what I expected as an end for the whole thing. Pretty poor and vague I think. On top of that, these boxed sets, which I own them all, don't come with any subtitles, not even in English. Personally, that's fine with me because I'm a teacher of English but I'm the only one who can watch the DVDs at home. A shame, really.",1243468800,,509,4.204081632653061

In the earlier seasons the stories they went with were really effective in taking the show to new ground and exploring every avenue of what could happen if you had this ability.
In a sense this season went backward. literally. To his father before him.....bla bla.......
Obviously their budget was extremely low for this season, to cull the characters and to fizzle the story and where it was headed.
The last 5 minute of the last episode was a good way to finish though.",1234483200,,677,4.65

3152964,4,B00166UFTI,"Unfortunately the ""Final"" season of the Dead Zone (or the sixth season as it was once called) was disappointing in terms of character focus and story shift; however, it was still overall better than most TV in my opinion and, when push came to shove in the final few episodes, the writers did justice to the fans and gave us a fitting final (?) that satisfactorily dealt with the issues and arcs that made the show one of my favourites.  That, plus a visit from Johnny's psychic 'girlfriend,' make this season worth owning.  (If you're new to the show, YOU SHOULD BUY SEASONS ONE AND TWO FIRST.)",1223596800,,595,4.5514018691588785

stories, we now have to see him bind again with family stuff ...boring
boring...big waste of quality dvd time.  But again, it was a great show

The last episode wasn't even a good conclusion to the series. The writers should have tryed a little harder to end the series well.

Michael Anthony does a great job in the part he plays as Johnny Smith, however the writers definetly lost there excitement for the story line.  I agree that the Stillson ticket was good, but it would have been good to see more about his mother, and maybe purdy being involved in her death.  And also, seeing Johnny's son carry on the vision.  But I agree this series ended due to poor writing.  And a lost story line.
Besides that the series overall was pretty good esppeacially the first 2 seasons.",1221436800,,620,4.590909090909091

3152969,4,B00166UFTI,"Evidently the cancellation of The Dead Zone came as a big surprise to the producers as the 6th season began with numerous changes.  First, the show's production was moved from Vancouver to Montreal, Canada and Connor Price was brought into play son J.J., replacing Spencer Achtymichuk.  In the first episode alone, Sheriff Walt Bannerman and bad guy aide to Vice President Stillson, Malcom Janus, are both killed.  The series went out with a huge bang as season six had a number of fantastic episodes even though the series finale still left a few plots unresolved.  Anthony Michael Hall turned in some of his strongest performances this season and Price was even better as the new J.J.

The last season begins with ""Heritage"".  As Cleaves Mills readies for the town festival, Johnny gets a vision of Walt dying and vows to stick with him all day, actually preventing his death a few times but fate won't be stopped.  Walt is killed in a fire at the church rescuing Rev. Purdy.  Malcom Janus is also killed and with his death, Johnny's visions of apocalypse surrounding Stillson seem to end.

A new Sheriff, Anna Turner (Carla Buono) takes over in ""Ego"" and she and Johnny get off on the wrong foot right away.  She has no use for a psychic and Johnny wants to know why she is investigating the late Walt Bannerman.

""Re-Entry"" Is one of the highlights of Season Six.  A private space mission, part of Stillson's ""Go Space"" program has suffered an accident.  Unknown to the crew a wing flap is damaged and the ship will rip apart if it tries to land.  It also carries a load of plutonium, which will cause a national disaster.  Stillson is prepared to shoot the shuttle down unless Johnny can use his powers to send the astronauts a message so they can make repairs.  Outstanding episode filled with tension.  At the end of the episode, Sarah gives birth to her baby she names Hope.

""Interred"" is another outstanding and chilling episode.  While hitting balls at a gold range, Johnny gets a vision of a man buried alive in a coffin. The man is running out of air and he and Turner have to race to rescue the man before he suffocates.

""Outcome"" finds Johnny picking up Sarah's friend from a bus terminal but getting a vision of the station exploding.  He has only an hour to find the source of the explosion and prevent it.  Johnny has to interact with several travelers, intertwining with their lives in a compact yet powerful episode.

The series finale ""Denouement"" is very good but obviously rushed together as so many plot elements are attempted to be wrapped up.  Johnny learns that his father may not be dead after all and meets the woman who had a secret meeting with Walt before he died.  Meanwhile, Stillson makes his play on Sarah and J.J., offering to give her a job in Washington D.C.  Tom Skerritt guest-stars as Johnny's father.  There is a great payoff to the plot involving Johnny's father who has been used as a tool by Stillson to predict the future.  There's one final moving scene involving Walt who knew Johnny would eventually pickup his final words in a vision.  Still, not everything is completely wrapped up and we can only hope that perhaps a TV movie will bring things to a more final close.

3152991,5,B00166UFTI,"I found the story line very well written. Though the last season was slow in some places, I wish they would have wrapped this up with special season ending episode. I didn't know the show was cancelled until today. Sara and Johnny should have married, and they should have had a daughter, as shown in one of the reruns on UPN 9 that aired tonight, to wrap it up nicely. I hate it when shows leave you hanging. A well written show, even if given a good ending, could be ressurected by good writers. It really is a shame when networks & writers do this, and I absolutely hate it.",1217721600,,577,4.254545454545455

3152993,4,B00166UFTI,I have all seasons of The Dead Zone and I hope they will have a movie to end all. All though It is gone off the air I like the Show a lot. Michael Anthony Hall is a great actor and has been since he were young. The 2dead zone will not disapoint. I recommend it to all.,1216512000,,268,3.6379310344827585
3152994,4,B00166UFTI,"Living in Australia has never made it easy to watch this show as they didn't air it on television over here. So i was always dependant on amazon to release the next season to buy (thankyou amazon).

Still a very enjoyable series although it is a shame that they ended it, as i was unaware that the show had been cancelled until reading other reviews.

I found Season 6 slighty off the mark compared to the other seasons, probably because i was disappointed knowing that it was the last season.

Im sure if the studios had given the cast and crew another season to give the characters send offs that they deserved, then i would have enjoyed it more.

I take my hat off to the entire cast for making it such an enjoyable series to watch over the years, especially Anthony Michael Hall.

Hopefully in the near future the studio will see the error of there ways and continue with the series. If there are people in Australia prepared to wait for it to come out on DVD just to watch it, then im sure that there are plenty in the US that would still love to see it continue.

3152998,3,B00166UFTI,"I enjoyed this show from the first season, and I'm sad it's over.  I gave it three stars though, because it probably is a little weaker compared to the other seasons, and I agree with other reviewers that there were things left open-ended... you'd hope for another season.

I suppose I should place a spoiler alert warning here... First, although I was slightly bummed there was a different actor playing J.J., I really liked this kid.  In all honesty, I think he was better than the original, had more personality.  The whole thing with Stilson not being wrapped up didn't bother me.

I was sad to see Walt go, because I grew to like him, but I liked the irony of Sarah now giving birth to Walt's kid, and John being left behind to take care of them.  The thing I disliked the most was how John and Sarah ended up.  All this time passed, now they finally have a chance to be a real family, and I think the two characters never got the finale they deserved after so many years.  For those of you who watched it, Sarah's issue with the lie John told her was ridiculous to me.

I liked the end scene in that it was hopeful, but I would have preferred to see them finally married off... at least J.J. finally accepted him as ""Dad.""",1213833600,,1228,4.304347826086956
3152999,4,B00166UFTI,"This show was multidimensional and amazing. I didn't start watching until the second to last season. I didn't really get where they were going until I saw it for myself. I think alot more people would have watched from the beginning with better promotion - I couldn't see what it was with those Monk and John commercials. But I agree with the previous reviewer that USA network showed a lack of respect for the cast, crew and fans by now allowing them to tie up the loose ends. The only reason you can't really give this five stars is because so many questions were left unanswered. I don't want to give too much away in the review but as always I think it's worth watching.",1212364800,,674,4.4
3153000,3,B00166UFTI,"I've been a long time fan of this show and I have to admit that it was loosing some steam, but I don't think the network have that many good shows that was worth canceling this one.  I always enjoyed the episodes that pushed the Stillson story line (this is with all the seasons), so I'm most upset that the show was canceled prior to tying that up.  There are a few gems on this set, I only hope that they give us some good special features to make up for our lost.  I hate when shows like this are not given the respect of a proper ending.  Sad.",1210896000,,547,3.9908256880733943
3153001,3,B00166UFTI,"While it is too bad this is the last season, it was quite obvious that it would be because of the season finale (for those who've seen it you know what I mean). The first episode started itself even started off bad; no more Bruce, different JJ, no more Walt. Through-out the season they even had to progress the whole Johnny & Sarah thing even further, which was part of the ruination of the show; they also didn't have too much to do with the whole Stillson and end of the world thing. The worst part of this whole season WAS the very last scene of the season finale...too happy.
However, I still enjoyed following the mystery of the whole season & playing the game; plus, the special effects never ceased to amaze me & Anthony Michael Hall is still a phenomenal actor. If you are a collector then it's worth buying, if not buy the first 5 seasons they were definitely better.",1210377600,,877,4.386503067484663

I understand most series end sometime, and that many factors determine when a series end including finances, but to end the series like this is just not fair to its fans. It is remisscent of the ending of Sopranos though to be honest I'd rather like to see how THIS show ends than the Sopranos.

We don't see much of Bruce and for some unknown reason, Johnny doesn't explain to Sarah that he couldn't manage to save Walt despite saving him several times from death.  Stillson turns out to be an okay guy due to Walt's heroic actions in the first episode so we don't fear him anymore.

First off I think it was a bad decision to kill off Walt, he was more of a main character than Purdy, IMO. Purdy not dying made me mad, don't get me wrong David Ogden Stiers is an excellent actor as is Chris Bruno but Purdy's role was too crooked. If it proves anything in this world it's that the good die young to make the weak willed and those who create bad karma in this world look even worse. I did like when Janus was killed off, he was an all out monster. It just sucks that Walt had the good news of him being a new father and then he's just killed off, sucky. I think Sarah needed to realize that Walt was a great guy and she didn't need Johnny anymore. In the end I just felt bad Walt had to die, it was a stupid decision, also if they had killed off Bruce I would have been equally mad, he's cool. It's a really great television series, I only wish there were more of them like it around, this reality tv is boring. Good writers, good actors, just an awesome and well produced show except what I mentioned sucked. Now I'm going to buy this on DVD and let my mom see it.",1332633600,,1235,3.9838709677419355

3387413,2,B00166UFTI,"**** May be spoilers below ****

This is a great show.  Every episode draws you more into the story.  For a while in the show, Smith kept seeing the world ending.  In the last season or two, something happened and he stopped seeing it.  Then, in the LAST episode, everything went back to what it had been.  In a bad way.  What the hell is going on?  One cool thing about the last few episodes is, you find out a little more about the characters.  BUT, what you find out makes you ask yourself more and want and need to know more.  I was SO disappointed after watching the last episode.  I sat in my bad and just stared at the TV.  SO many things go unanswered.  Not just little things, I'm talking really important things that the show had been building up on.  Actually, I don't think anything gets answered.  Plus, I thought I saw an episode before that had Johnny being able to save Walt and decide if he wanted himself or Walt to be alive.  But, it was not in the last season, so I guess I'm crazy!  While the last season has good episodes, they would have been better if they went somewhere.  I am happy to own the series, but I will always be waiting for a true ending.  The way they ended it looped back to the beginning of season three or four.  If you like the show, get the seasons.

The story arc that was growing in complexity was clumsily truncated due to what I assume was an impending cancellation. Rather than go out in a blaze of glory, they opted to  give Stilson a ""Road to Damascus"" moment and end everything.  I would call this a spoiler, but in fact, it spoils itself by doing this at the beginning of the season. The remainder of the season is reminscent of season 1, only more maddening because we've already developed characters.

I won't even say that this season offers closure to the storyline. Frankly, you don't need this season if you want to know where the story arc goes--it ends; abruptly, with leaps in character, and with little circumstance. It epitomizes anticlimax.",1276905600,,825,4.878571428571429

The last season is not what I expected as an end for the whole thing. Pretty poor and vague I think. On top of that, these boxed sets, which I own them all, don't come with any subtitles, not even in English. Personally, that's fine with me because I'm a teacher of English but I'm the only one who can watch the DVDs at home. A shame, really.",1243468800,,509,4.204081632653061

In the earlier seasons the stories they went with were really effective in taking the show to new ground and exploring every avenue of what could happen if you had this ability.
In a sense this season went backward. literally. To his father before him.....bla bla.......
Obviously their budget was extremely low for this season, to cull the characters and to fizzle the story and where it was headed.
The last 5 minute of the last episode was a good way to finish though.",1234483200,,677,4.65

they are very kind ,funny, warmful and courageous.
of coursel Sarah,Bluce,Pardy,Rebecca,Alex and Stillson ..they are fantastic character!! they are making good jobs in making film.
I was thinking this amazing story would continue as long as X-File's span.
because story line is excellent!! canceling is Mottainai!!
I can't undestand this desicion and I don't want to believe it.

3387461,4,B00166UFTI,"Unfortunately the ""Final"" season of the Dead Zone (or the sixth season as it was once called) was disappointing in terms of character focus and story shift; however, it was still overall better than most TV in my opinion and, when push came to shove in the final few episodes, the writers did justice to the fans and gave us a fitting final (?) that satisfactorily dealt with the issues and arcs that made the show one of my favourites.  That, plus a visit from Johnny's psychic 'girlfriend,' make this season worth owning.  (If you're new to the show, YOU SHOULD BUY SEASONS ONE AND TWO FIRST.)",1223596800,,595,4.5514018691588785

stories, we now have to see him bind again with family stuff ...boring
boring...big waste of quality dvd time.  But again, it was a great show

stories in it.  I will now mourn the loss of a great series and re-watch the better episodes.  I really hope they make another movie with

3387463,3,B00166UFTI,I really love this show but I don't know what happened with the last season. The first few episodes were alright but after that the whole season lacked substance. The last episode wasn't even a good conclusion to the series. The writers should have tryed a little harder to end the series well. Every other season was better than this one.,1221523200,,339,4.573770491803279

Michael Anthony does a great job in the part he plays as Johnny Smith, however the writers definetly lost there excitement for the story line.  I agree that the Stillson ticket was good, but it would have been good to see more about his mother, and maybe purdy being involved in her death.  And also, seeing Johnny's son carry on the vision.  But I agree this series ended due to poor writing.  And a lost story line.
Besides that the series overall was pretty good esppeacially the first 2 seasons.",1221436800,,620,4.590909090909091

3387466,4,B00166UFTI,"Evidently the cancellation of The Dead Zone came as a big surprise to the producers as the 6th season began with numerous changes.  First, the show's production was moved from Vancouver to Montreal, Canada and Connor Price was brought into play son J.J., replacing Spencer Achtymichuk.  In the first episode alone, Sheriff Walt Bannerman and bad guy aide to Vice President Stillson, Malcom Janus, are both killed.  The series went out with a huge bang as season six had a number of fantastic episodes even though the series finale still left a few plots unresolved.  Anthony Michael Hall turned in some of his strongest performances this season and Price was even better as the new J.J.

The last season begins with ""Heritage"".  As Cleaves Mills readies for the town festival, Johnny gets a vision of Walt dying and vows to stick with him all day, actually preventing his death a few times but fate won't be stopped.  Walt is killed in a fire at the church rescuing Rev. Purdy.  Malcom Janus is also killed and with his death, Johnny's visions of apocalypse surrounding Stillson seem to end.

A new Sheriff, Anna Turner (Carla Buono) takes over in ""Ego"" and she and Johnny get off on the wrong foot right away.  She has no use for a psychic and Johnny wants to know why she is investigating the late Walt Bannerman.

""Re-Entry"" Is one of the highlights of Season Six.  A private space mission, part of Stillson's ""Go Space"" program has suffered an accident.  Unknown to the crew a wing flap is damaged and the ship will rip apart if it tries to land.  It also carries a load of plutonium, which will cause a national disaster.  Stillson is prepared to shoot the shuttle down unless Johnny can use his powers to send the astronauts a message so they can make repairs.  Outstanding episode filled with tension.  At the end of the episode, Sarah gives birth to her baby she names Hope.

""Interred"" is another outstanding and chilling episode.  While hitting balls at a gold range, Johnny gets a vision of a man buried alive in a coffin. The man is running out of air and he and Turner have to race to rescue the man before he suffocates.

""Outcome"" finds Johnny picking up Sarah's friend from a bus terminal but getting a vision of the station exploding.  He has only an hour to find the source of the explosion and prevent it.  Johnny has to interact with several travelers, intertwining with their lives in a compact yet powerful episode.

The series finale ""Denouement"" is very good but obviously rushed together as so many plot elements are attempted to be wrapped up.  Johnny learns that his father may not be dead after all and meets the woman who had a secret meeting with Walt before he died.  Meanwhile, Stillson makes his play on Sarah and J.J., offering to give her a job in Washington D.C.  Tom Skerritt guest-stars as Johnny's father.  There is a great payoff to the plot involving Johnny's father who has been used as a tool by Stillson to predict the future.  There's one final moving scene involving Walt who knew Johnny would eventually pickup his final words in a vision.  Still, not everything is completely wrapped up and we can only hope that perhaps a TV movie will bring things to a more final close.

3387488,5,B00166UFTI,"I found the story line very well written. Though the last season was slow in some places, I wish they would have wrapped this up with special season ending episode. I didn't know the show was cancelled until today. Sara and Johnny should have married, and they should have had a daughter, as shown in one of the reruns on UPN 9 that aired tonight, to wrap it up nicely. I hate it when shows leave you hanging. A well written show, even if given a good ending, could be ressurected by good writers.

3387491,4,B00166UFTI,"Living in Australia has never made it easy to watch this show as they didn't air it on television over here. So i was always dependant on amazon to release the next season to buy (thankyou amazon).

Still a very enjoyable series although it is a shame that they ended it, as i was unaware that the show had been cancelled until reading other reviews.

I found Season 6 slighty off the mark compared to the other seasons, probably because i was disappointed knowing that it was the last season.

Im sure if the studios had given the cast and crew another season to give the characters send offs that they deserved, then i would have enjoyed it more.

I take my hat off to the entire cast for making it such an enjoyable series to watch over the years, especially Anthony Michael Hall.

Hopefully in the near future the studio will see the error of there ways and continue with the series. If there are people in Australia prepared to wait for it to come out on DVD just to watch it, then im sure that there are plenty in the US that would still love to see it continue.

Thankyou again from an Australian fan to everyone who made the Dead Zone series possible. (A series worth watching again and again) Thankyou.",1216252800,,1211,4.383928571428571

3387495,3,B00166UFTI,"I enjoyed this show from the first season, and I'm sad it's over.  I gave it three stars though, because it probably is a little weaker compared to the other seasons, and I agree with other reviewers that there were things left open-ended... you'd hope for another season.

I suppose I should place a spoiler alert warning here... First, although I was slightly bummed there was a different actor playing J.J., I really liked this kid.  In all honesty, I think he was better than the original, had more personality.  The whole thing with Stilson not being wrapped up didn't bother me.

I was sad to see Walt go, because I grew to like him, but I liked the irony of Sarah now giving birth to Walt's kid, and John being left behind to take care of them.  The thing I disliked the most was how John and Sarah ended up.  All this time passed, now they finally have a chance to be a real family, and I think the two characters never got the finale they deserved after so many years.  For those of you who watched it, Sarah's issue with the lie John told her was ridiculous to me.

I liked the end scene in that it was hopeful, but I would have preferred to see them finally married off... at least J.J. finally accepted him as ""Dad.""",1213833600,,1228,4.304347826086956
3387496,4,B00166UFTI,"This show was multidimensional and amazing. I didn't start watching until the second to last season. I didn't really get where they were going until I saw it for myself. I think alot more people would have watched from the beginning with better promotion - I couldn't see what it was with those Monk and John commercials. But I agree with the previous reviewer that USA network showed a lack of respect for the cast, crew and fans by now allowing them to tie up the loose ends. The only reason you can't really give this five stars is because so many questions were left unanswered. I don't want to give too much away in the review but as always I think it's worth watching.",1212364800,,674,4.4
3387497,3,B00166UFTI,"I've been a long time fan of this show and I have to admit that it was loosing some steam, but I don't think the network have that many good shows that was worth canceling this one.  I always enjoyed the episodes that pushed the Stillson story line (this is with all the seasons), so I'm most upset that the show was canceled prior to tying that up.  There are a few gems on this set, I only hope that they give us some good special features to make up for our lost.  I hate when shows like this are not given the respect of a proper ending.

3387498,3,B00166UFTI,"While it is too bad this is the last season, it was quite obvious that it would be because of the season finale (for those who've seen it you know what I mean). The first episode started itself even started off bad; no more Bruce, different JJ, no more Walt. Through-out the season they even had to progress the whole Johnny & Sarah thing even further, which was part of the ruination of the show; they also didn't have too much to do with the whole Stillson and end of the world thing. The worst part of this whole season WAS the very last scene of the season finale...too happy.
However, I still enjoyed following the mystery of the whole season & playing the game; plus, the special effects never ceased to amaze me & Anthony Michael Hall is still a phenomenal actor. If you are a collector then it's worth buying, if not buy the first 5 seasons they were definitely better.",1210377600,,877,4.386503067484663

I watched Dead Zone on TV as long as reruns played, and have recently bought up the entire series on DVD to enjoy again.  And again season 6 is a bare-bones box with insert or episode guide at all just like amazon's season 5, nothing like the original issues of a season.  I had to print a guide off the internet to place in the case. And I had to use Maxell polish to get disc 3 to play all the way through without skipping, again like season 5.  There was a blooper in epsode 11 called Exile - just curious if anybody else ever noticed.  When Alex and Johnny emerge from the submerged car, he asks her about stashing the rescue items in HER trunk (not 'my trunk').  It wasn't her vehicle the truck, it was Johnny's rental car still in the shop for repairs.  It would have made sense if it had been her truck submerged but it wasn't.  And she mentioned learning how to scuba dive.  So how did she manage to find scuba anything in a wide place in the road in Indiana, and how did she manage to get it inside the rental car in the shop?
