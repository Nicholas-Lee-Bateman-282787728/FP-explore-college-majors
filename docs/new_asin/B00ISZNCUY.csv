6291142,5,B00ISZNCUY,"This is a classic Tom and Jerry film with all the goodness included! I thought Tom and Jerry would find a lost dragon in their normal house, but no! Tom And Jerry: The Lost Dragon is a hilarious family friendly adventure with a lot of unexpected turns.

This is a story with a lot packed in it  adventure to start with covered in Tom and Jerry classic humor, with a sprinkle of thrilling and all topped with family wrapped in one huge delicious story sandwich.

The story begins with a girl who owns an animal-care shop but, it is going out of business. Then, they find a dragon egg and a whole bunch of stuff happens including the girl facing her evil Aunty Witch! Of course, the girl's two little helpers are a cat named Tom and a mouse named Jerry!
What a fantastic Tom and Jerry film! This has everything right about it. Tom and Jerry don't talk, but imitate talking. The slapstick humor makes you crack up throughout the entire film and much, much more! They cover all of it! The voices of the talking characters are fantastic and they also make it so that Tom and Jerry are very close to main characters but are not in every scene. I like this because it lets the story develop much smoother and takes it much further.

My favorite scene is probably in the very beginning when Jerry is awake and running around doing chores while Tom is lazily chilling on his pillow not doing anything - the classic Tom and Jerry scene. As usual, Jerry gets upset and teaches Tom a lesson. I love it because its such a classic moment for these favorite characters.

This film is extremely family friendly. Even kids who don't understand the characters will enjoy the bright colors, so a good age rating is 4 to18. I also give it 5 out of 5 stars for just an overall fantastic Tom and Jerry adventure.

With successive direct-to-video releases, Tom and Jerry have convincingly proven that they can support and enhance plots that last more than five minutes. However, Tom and Jerry: The Lost Dragon (hereafter Lost Dragon) really puts even our energetic duo through their paces. Seeing the DVD cover, one might conclude that Tom and Jerry only have to worry about taking care of a baby dragon that hatched from a missing pearl-like egg (and has imprinted upon Tom) until they can return it to his frantic, ferocious mother. Ah, but the plot is more involved than this.

Lost Dragon actually begins in a medieval elf village where the Gandalf-like wizard Kaldorf (voice of the dependable Jim Cummings) bans the sinister, threatening witch Drizelda (voice of Vicki Lewis) from the town. Drizelda tries to entice her niece Athena (voice of Kelly Stables) to follow her into exile, but the tender-hearted girl prefers to stay with Kaldorf and the elves. Of course, Drizelda vows revenge.

In spite of her good nature and love of animals (including Tom and Jerry), the elf citizens, especially the vain, shrewish Elf Elders wife (voice of Lauraine Newman), who loves hideous hats, prejudicially distrust Athena. Therefore, with Tom and Jerry (mostly Jerry) as assistants, Athena retires to the woods and runs a sort of animal menagerie hospital/refuge. Athena tries her best to win over the townspeople, and is on the verge of doing so, but you-know-who (plus a manic warthog) keep messing things up.

Meanwhile, Drizelda has sent her henchmen (henchcats) Tin (voice of Greg Ellis), Pan (voice of Jess Harnell), and Alley (Richard McGonagle) to steal the pearl/egg from the forbidden, treasure-filled mountain lair of a fire-breathing dragon. She seeks the pearl-egg to increase her magic power. They succeed but the mother dragon gives chase and makes them lose the pearl-egg, where Tom and Jerry find it floating down the river.

So as I said before, taking care of a mischievous, flying, fire-breathing dragon that thinks the lazy, kinda-chicken Tom is his mother is just the beginning of the duos adventures. Can Tom and Jerry put aside their eternal bickering and one-upmanship to get the baby (named Puffy, also voiced by Kelly Stables) safely to its mother before the angry mother torches the countryside looking for it, AND before Drizelda steals the dragons fire to become a super-dragon herself, AND help Athena gain the villages acceptance?

Lost Dragon answers these burning (no pun intended) questions with a lively medieval plot that borrows from both The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug and Dragonslayer chock-full of thunderous action, suspenseful danger, and evil incantations. Of course, Tom and Jerry do what they do best, but they are not out of place in this energetic tale, and in their own reliable slapsticky way try to help Athena, the village, Puffy, and his mother to their respective happy endings.

Tom and Jerry fans should get their quota (and more) of cat-and-mouse shenanigans and pratfalls (including the scene where Tom and Jerry are falling from a great height and Tom looks at his watch to see when theyll hit the ground), while medieval/Tolkien fans should get a pleasant homage and send-up of their obsessions. Lost Dragon is an eventful and ultimately satisfying animated journey.

P.S.: Despite the fire-and-brimstone aspects of the story, Lost Dragon shouldnt really disturb children, even sensitive ones, although what happens to baby Puffy and mama dragon after Drizelda steals their fire might be considered shocking. Otherwise, everybody should be able to enjoy this latest Tom and Jerry adventure without nightmares.",1432598400,,3694,5.196638655462185
