3422820,3,B001957A26,"I think Grindhouse needs to make a sequel to this original ten movie concept. I enjoyed all of the movies even though the visual quality was bad at times. These were movies I watched as a teenager at the drive-in. This in itself brought back many fond memories. A lot of these movies I HAD seen only once but when I started to get into them it all came back to me and it will you.
  My favorites were the two guys doing the Bud Spencer and Terence Hill act. They were very good. The other movie was Sons of Trinity which had me holding my sides from laughing so much. I just wish these two guys made some more films together. Anyway I felt I got my money`s worth just wish once again the quality  of the pictures was better.  RICKO",1233532800,,731,4.126760563380282
3422821,1,B001957A26,"These DVD's are for the most part unwatchable.  I am a Trinity fan.  Thought this would be fun.  But the quality is absolutely terrible.  Cramming two movies onto each side of a DVD results in a poor watching experience.  And there are a lot of video and audio dropouts.  This is worse than watching UHF on a B&W TV in the 70's when you are just barely able to pick up a signal.
Save your money.",1227916800,18,395,4.131578947368421
3422822,5,B001957A26,These are some really strong films that I think have been forgotten for way too long. This is one really cool collection - some of these films have never been on DVD before - which means that these films have not been seen since they first when out in movie theaters decades ago. This is a great opportunity. These films truly are classics. Watching Viva Django was great - the only official sequel to the Franco Nero masterpiece. Definitely one very cool collection which is definitely worth owning!,1226534400,3,500,4.693181818181818
3422823,5,B001957A26,"All these Grindhouse Experience releases are usually the same with varied quality of VHS transfers, But in this collection the movies are quite fun to watch, they are not all spaghetti westerns, Bud Spencer & Terence Hill are still great & on here are some I have never seen, also I enjoyed Kid Stuff with Michael Coby & Paul Smith playing Bud & Terence. Grindhouse Experience for me so far is the Experience of new & unseen territory of ""B"" Movies from the late 60's through mid 80's, If I hadn't seen these from the Grindhouse Collections I most likely never would have gotten to see them. If you like Grindhouse type movies then you should love these as I do.",1225584000,2,662,4.479338842975206
3422824,1,B001957A26,"First off this is a ten movie set,two are fairly watchable two are barely watchable and six are pathetic. I'm speaking in terms of the transfers only,the content is  up to the individual. The  transfer of
Blackie the Pirate is the best followed by Viva Django which has severe audio issues in that you have to turn the volume all the way up and it only plays out of one audio channel. Trinity goes East and Trinity and Bambino are so bad that only a true fan of this genre can watch.
the others are like watching a dirty TV screen in the fog. Apparently no effort was made to clean these up so I say why bother relaeasing this.",1223856000,7,627,4.216666666666667

8271949,5,B001957A26,"No where in the advertising of this collection does it claim to be a "" Best of Terence Hill & Bud Spencer Films"".  Quite the contrary on the back of the Box Set it states that for the first time a film dedication to the Trinity Boy's, their look a likes & successors.  As far as the picture quality goes' we should be thankful someone has taken the time to preserve these rare films at all as many have become so damaged they have been completely canned!!!  The picture quality is very watchable & the sound quality is good...however you may have to go through the anguish of turning your volume up & down.  All in all these films are totally watchable.  I purchased this collection mainly for "" Blackie the Pirate"" & I am very happy with the sound & picture quality.  I discovered some real gem's in this collection especially the movie "" Tedeum"" which has the same "" Tall Tale"" element's that made the Trinity franchise so successful.  I have seen "" Trinity & Bambino"" under a different title called "" The Son's of trinity"".  Like Monty Python, Mel Brooks, Woody Allen & The Three Stooges & other comedy's  these films like there more popular commercial successes all depends on personal taste.  If your looking at this with thoughts of purchasing it , chances are you have seen at least the original Trinity series "" My Name is Nobody"", "" They call me Trinity"" & "" Trinity is still my name"".  It is amazing that so many non-western films were made using the  Hill/ Spencer pairing as well as their westerns, which is a testament to their world wide screen appeal.  So if you are looking for the best of Hill & Spencer be prepared to make many single D.V.D. purchases. Even if you go that route that means you are a fan in the class of fan's that would love to have these rare films.  This Box Set may seem pricey...but when you consider your getting 10 full length movies many of which are so rare this Box Set is there D.V.D.  Debut, most never even making it to V.H.S.!!!  With this in mind it's not so pricey after all.  While I would not recommend this Box Set to everyone, I can recommend it to everyone that loves the Terence Hill / Bud Spencer pairing.  A pairing so endearing to fans that they spawned look a likes just to keep the fun going a bit longer.",1493164800,,2266,4.354761904761904

8271953,4,B001957A26,"I only purchased this for Viva Django. I don't really like comedy spaghetti westerns but I did watch Te Deum which was actually pretty entertaining. my four stars, however, were for Viva Django because spaghetti western comedies just aren't worth it. Otherwise, without Django, this set would have received a one star rating from me.",1359244800,,333,5.072727272727272
8271954,4,B001957A26,"Ok, so the title of my review may make it sound like I regret buying the above DVD set but that is not the case. While the video quality is horrbile, chances are you're not going to be able to see these films in any other way unless you speak Italian/German and have a Region Free DVD player.
Oddly enough this set of rare films doesn't contain any Spencer Hill pairings but one (Blackie the Pirate) but it does contain some of thier rarer solo films and imitators. Among them are:

Trinity and Bambino ***

This is apparently a 1990s TV movie directed by the original Trinity series director Enzo Barboni (E.B. Clutcher) thus making it the only official sequel to Trinity is Still My Name. Consequently, its the best film of the bunch (of this DVD set that is, not the Trinity films themselves) and even has a few roles played by actors from the original films (just not Spencer and Hill themselves)

Trinity Goes East *
It would be interesting to know the history of this strange film made in the 1990s. Basically it has characters named Trinity and Bambino and its set in modern day Asia. Bambino is a detective and Trinity is a thief, but unlike the Trinity of old, he's never on top of the situation and is basically a buffoon. An odd film to say the least.

Blackie the Pirate *

This was Bud and Terence's first post-Trinity team up. Sadly, I can't remember if this one was supposed to be a comedy or not. All I remember is that it wasn't funny one way or another. (For funny non-Trinity Spencer Hill comedies see Watch Out We're Mad, Crimebusters and Odds and Evens to name the best).

Bulldozer ***
Not terribly funny but for some reason I enjoyed this solo effort from Bud Spencer as an ex-football player who comes out of retirement.

Kid Stuff and Diamond Peddlers ***

These two films starring Paul Smith and Michael Coby as Terence and Bud rip-offs are surprisingly good. The voice actor who dubbed Spencer in his Trinity films even dubs the Spencer rip-off character in Diamonds! Someone who didn't know better would probably even think Coby and Smith were Bud and Terence.

Tedium ***

Supposedly this film pre-dates the Trinity films as a Spaghetti Western comedy but I'm not sure. In any case, I was surprised to find it was actually pretty funny, not on par with the Trinity films but almost on par with similar fare such as ""Sundance Cassidy and Butch the Kid"".

Revenge of Trinity **
Terence Hill in a serious role that IS NOT his Trinity character. If memory serves the film is based on true events, but over all it was pretty boring. For a ""serious"" Spaghetti film its certainly no ""Death Rides a Horse"" and is just your run of the mill stuff.

Viva Django **

This DVD set bills the film as the only official sequel to Django but I'm not sure this is actually the case. (Django II starring Franco Nero is the only official one for sure) According to the IFC Spaghetti West documentary the producers of this film initially used photos of Terence Hill (who plays Django in this film) to dupe producers into thinking Franco Nero had returned as Django! Anyways, this isn't a bad serious western, but I still found it a little boring, but thats just me.

Jesse and Lester in a Town called Trinity I honestly didn't watch so I can't say if it was good or bad. I am curious however as to why one of the more famous Trinity rip-offs called ""Two Sons of Trinity"" wasn't included? And for that matter Bud Spencers solo Westerns It Can Be Done Amigo and Buddy Goes West both of which would've been more appropriate to this set and are in (I presume) the public domain.

So bottom line, if you're Hill Spencer completist I'd pick up this DVD set, just don't expect good picture quality.",1357171200,3,3699,4.4836309523809526

is a statement of supreme kindness,
for they truly bungled everything but the packaging of this DVD release.

I will not purchase other Grindhouse releases.",1340496000,2,237,5.2368421052631575

The quailty of the film is not that bad for the older movies what do you expect! The only trouble I had was how skinny some of the movies was! But, I loved them all, and it is a great set to watch! SO what if they where not all western's, they were great! I would Highly recommend people to buy this set!! I am a Trinity fan, and a western fan!! I really Loved the whole set!",1273708800,,529,3.8181818181818183
8271957,2,B001957A26,"At the time of this review this product is $17.99. Considering the availability of some of these movies, I would say it is worth it. But as some have said here, the quality of both audio and video is bad. Most of the time it is not both with one movie. For instance, Viva Django, good picture-bad audio. Trinity and Bambino, bad picture-ok audio. But, if you want these for your collection, $17.99 is not a bad price for 10 movies.",1253232000,7,431,4.333333333333333
