8018837,5,B0001ZJQ8G,"A continuation of book #1 of course but continues to challenge with more difficult chord styling and configurations. A great introduction to the blues given you have some finger picking ability.  Roy's are the first DVDs I've truly worked with all the way through.  A big ""thumbs up""!",1442188800,,284,4.895833333333333
8018838,5,B0001ZJQ8G,"A world class musician with an a bundle of technique and talent laced with extraordinary wit and comedic timing. Easy and relaxed teaching style which makes learning a pleasure..I can`t wait for practice time so I can get to my guitar and start a session with Roy. The material is not terribly difficult but it would be good for you to have a pretty good handle on the thumb picking style of playing..... Buy this DVD, spend some time with it and you will learn a few things that will ""change your life.""",1367280000,2,504,4.43010752688172
