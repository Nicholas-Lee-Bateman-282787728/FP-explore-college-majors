8112464,5,B000EP0W0E,"How can one not watch this and have multiple Whogasms???? This is Roger Harry Daltrey, CBE at his most beautiful, most angelic, most pensive, and most seductive! The funky ""Get Your Love"" gives Rod Stewart a run for his money. The sensuous, sultry ""Proud"" sends chills up my spine! And then there are those pensive, emotional ballads ""Near to Surrender"", where you can feel his arms around you, ""Oceans Away"", where he's just about ready to burst into tears and sob at the piano pouring his heart out to you, and ""Milk Train"", where he finds solace in your arms after a wild night out. The hip animation of the soulful ""Hearts Right"" is like a segment from 1970s SESAME STREET or THE ELECTRIC COMPANY.

The video production is amazing, with Roger looking more stunningly gorgeous than ever, proving he can do more than just shout Pete Townshend's lyrics into a mic and then swing it really fast! I actually wept the first time I watched, cos this is a Roger that one can only hear and see to believe! Well done, Roger! Keep using it!",1274918400,2,1033,4.553763440860215
