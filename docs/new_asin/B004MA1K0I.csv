8435806,4,B004MA1K0I,"Perhaps the true intention of this film has been missed by those who point to 'Isa's time as a religious mercenary as the foci of the piece when, in fact, the real message lies somewhere between the origin of the tragic child and the renaissance of the 'found' man.

I found this documentary to be surprisingly inspiring (despite the fact that I, personally, have no overall use for organized religio-political groups or the ""truths"" they claim to espouse, nor the fanatical zealots they empower).

In my mind, the thing to be taken from this film is the fact that this man overcame his personal demons when others of similar (and, indeed, ofttimes less harsh) backgrounds cannot seem to do the same.

The fact that this seemingly violent man with no formative male role model has brought himself to the point where his cause celebre is no longer the call of his religious fever but, instead, the cry of his children and the renewed sense of self found with them is an achievement worth celebrating.

Well directed, engrossing, and thoroughly interesting.",1387411200,6,1055,4.844444444444444
