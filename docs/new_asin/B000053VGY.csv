1393208,2,B000053VGY,"A very modest year 2000 film has, oddly, more commentary by German Shakespeare specialists than really makes much sense. Shakespearean actor Sir Derek Jacobi hosts and comments throughout the film, thus we know the angle of the film leans exclusively on the assumption that the 17th Earl of Oxford, Edward de Vere was the secret author of all of the Shakespearean plays, sonnets and poems -- the ""Oxfordian School"" as it is referred to.

I'm at a loss to fathom why so many German specialists are interviewed in this film. Is there more support for the de Vere theory of the ""Authorship Question"" in Germany than elsewhere? Are there any popular claims that the author of the plays,sonnets and poems may have been German?

The producer of the film is Paul Streitz, an MBA who is also the author of 'Oxford: Son of Queen Elizabeth I', 'The Great American College Tuition Rip-off' and 'America First: Why Americans Must End Free Trade, Stop Outsourcing and Close Out Open Borders'. The director of the film is a person by the name of Michael Peer.

Mr. Streitz's book ""Oxford: Son of Queen Elizabeth I"" claims not only that Edward de Vere was the author of all of Shakespeare's works, but that he was also the illegitimate son of the Virgin Queen Elizabeth I. It gets more complicated with ideas that Edward de Vere also _fathered_ a child with his supposed mother Queen Elizabeth I (the product being Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton). If you want more information on this line of research look up ""Prince Tudor II"" on Wikipedia, or Google it. (And, no, I am no prude. The history of European royalty is rife with illegitimate children and incest. I think it might lend the de Vere authorship idea some verisimilitude at that.)

""The Shakespeare Conspiracy"" contains some unusually tacky and very old silent film footage from Othello and the Merchant of Venice -- Othello with a huge, grimacing, shiny blacked-face with big wide minstrel-show eyes and a caricatured Shylock with extra (profoundly) ugly hooked nose, wearing a Star of David on this cloak. All just a little too overdone. No very good judgement for filmmakers to use old movie scenes from films that look as they were exclusively produced to mock African-origined people and Jews.

Of course there may be a point to all of that. Even pro-de Vere scholars say that the fine Earl was chronically ill-tempered, excessive and some say an outrageous personality in Queen Elizabeth's court. All of this evidence may just be pointing to that conclusion. And, if the 17th Earl of Oxford is proven to be the real author behind William Shakespeare's works, then a lot of time may be spent not only revising attributions and chronologies -- there will be a _lot_ of pondering whether the place of this author really should be held in the same moral esteem as the author of the Songs of David or the Jesus of Mark's gospel, as some Shakespearean scholars have opined.

This will be a review in progress. Please feel free to comment.",1303603200,2,2994,4.781431334622824

1393211,3,B000053VGY,"While this 50 odd minute video races by hitting just the high spots, it is certainly a compelling argument for the true identity of the man who wrote the Shakespeare plays and poems as being Edward deVere.  Derek Jacobi is the very able commentator whose well-known and respected persona helps to establish the veracity of what is being said.  The film was produced by someone named Peers, in Austria, and makes use of a number of scholars as well as a descendant of Edward deVere, most of whom are speaking in German, which is over-dubbed in English. While this sometimes feels time-wasting, it is probably necessary to do it that way, and is not difficult to understand.  One could wish for more.",976233600,9,698,4.704918032786885

It would, however, be a continued injustice to not give the credit and notoriety to the true author of these great works.

1393214,1,B000053VGY,"Extremely weak case that ignores textual research and the inconvenient fact of De Vere's death ten years before Shakespeare's retirement.  It gives voice to a fringe theory.  De Vere was known as a poet and playwright under his own name, and was a favorite of Queen Elizabeth.  How then could the man have created a parallel body of work under a different name, which only premiered years after his death?  There was also a collaboration and another playwright, again after De Vere's death.  How do dead men collaborate?  And why would De Vere need to hide his writing in the first place?  Rather than focusing on 17th century engravings showing Shakespeare's tomb in Stratford, they should have addressed these questions.  They also ignore critical items like the diaries of contemporary writers like Ben Jonson, who sometimes complain about Shakespeare's writing.  This is not a theory that any well informed person would take seriously.",1461369600,14,939,5.084967320261438

Completely one-sided ""Conspiracy Theory"" presentation, that presents as evidence ideas that were proven wrong years ago. As it is, due to considerable historical research in the past few years, there is plenty of documentary evidence showing that Shakespeare of Stratford was indeed, the former actor, theater owner, playwright and real-estate speculator of London. There is far more evidence for this than there is for the ludicrous idea that de Vere produced that whole body of work.

It always seemed to me rather marvellous how a man whom in historical notes is mentioned for farming corn, being a butcher's apprentice and poaching deer could produce the sophisticated subtlety, vibrance and complex structuralism, not to mention the masterful portrayals of diverse characters found in the works of ""Shakespeare""!

This video shows a many parallels between the characters in the plays those in the sphere of de Vere's life, and even visual evidence in paintings showing his seals and coats of arms in portraits of Shakespeare and in the works themselves.

Theories abound as to who really wrote the plays and this one is rather convincing.

1393230,1,B000053VGY,"This film has not held up well since its production in 1990, with some of the theories expressed having been subsequently been determined to be fraudulent.  For instance, near the beginning of the film, it is alleged that the earliest questions raised about Shakespeare's authorship were raised in a 1785 speech made by James Corton Cowell to an ""Ipswich Philosophical Society,"" disclosing that an earlier antiquarian, James Wilmot, had found no proof of Shakespeare's authorship of the plays and poems.  But the account of this speech was based on a single document that Columbia University Professor James Shapiro had shown was a 20th century forgery, using words and making references to biographical details about Shakespeare that were not known at the time of the speech.

Similarly, the film has a considerable discussion on an early engraving of the monument to Shakespeare at his burial site that seems to differ from the existing monument.  But the discussion predates a valuable study by anti-Shakespearean writer Diana Price of the original sketch upon which the engraving was based, showing that the sketch accurately portrays the monument and that the engraving poorly reproduced the sketch.  More importantly, the book that included the engraving, ""The antiquities of Warwickshire Illustrated,"" called Shakespeare ""our late famous poet Will. Shakespere.""  So the author of the book clearly considered Shakespeare to be a writer.

This documentary presents many aspects of the ""Oxfordian""  version of the anti-Shakespearean legend, but practically all of it rests on not giving the viewer the full story or context.  For instance, the dedication of the sonnets refers to ""THAT ETERNITIE
PROMISED BY OUR EVER-LIVING POET.""  For the anti-Shakespeareans, the reference to ever-living must exclude Shakespeare, who was still alive at the time.  And so it does: in context the dedication is referring to God, not to the author of the sonnets.

The bottom line is that this film recounts the state of the art in attacks on Shakespeare's authorship, circa 1990.  Some of what is presented has since been conclusively disproven; much that remains is either out of context or pure speculation.",1404000000,3,2197,5.296829971181556

1393240,1,B000053VGY,"If you are a lover of overly dramatic music, look no further than the first few minutes of this piece of crap and then feel free to turn it off because nothing else of note comes afterwards. I shall divide this review into two parts: Firstly looking at the evidence and experts presented and then secondly production quality. I shall be comparing it a lot to the show ""Ancient Aliens"", which I believe sets the standard for tomfoolery and conspiracy in this present age.

1. There are three main experts presented. Even the history channel, when doing a special on ancient aliens can usually manage to dredge up more than three ""experts"". Secondly, we are given little as to the qualifications of said experts. One is listed as a ""professor of history and Latin"" but it is never mentioned where. Another is an author, what he is an author of is unclear (probably more of a fringe blogger). Again, Ancient Aliens always gives us from what university or lab there experts hail from or at least the title of their most famous work. Secondly, the writers seemed to have a problem finding experts who spoke English. Now, I do not mean to belittle scholars who speak and write in German (or any other language) but doesn't it seem funny that in a movie in English about the most eminent of English playwrights and poets that not one English speaking expert could be procured?

 Then we have the descendant of the Earl of Oxford himself presenting most of the evidence of a conspiracy. Now, I sincerely doubt that the writers of this piece have ever met any descendants of old families or houses on either side of the Atlantic, because they always have a rich mythology involving their families and are quite willing to capitalize on them.

Of course the evidence is shaky, circumstantial and takes a great deal of salt to be believed at best. The narrators, who again and again draw a distinction between ""shackspear"" and ""shakespeare"" seem to have absolutely no knowledge of the way the English language was written at the time. And again with their insistence that it was a pseudonym was well known because it was spelled ""shake-spear"". Give an idiot a photocopy of a folio written in 15th century English and this is the sort of nonsense that you will get.

Now, for the big one. Apparently, this is a ""conspiracy"" because the tourist industry of Stratford-Upon-Avon doesn't want the truth getting out. Imagine, an industry that brings in a rather paltry (in global lobbying terms) 10 million pounds a year has been hushing up academics, authors and truth seekers for centuries now! It has been ever since Shakespeare's time (when no such tourist industry existed... so I wonder how they managed it?)!

2. The production quality is awful. The old footage from plays now in the public domain look like the cameraman set his camera in front of a tv playing an old vhs tape. And the footage of the interviews look like they were filmed on a $40 kodak point and shoot from seven years before it was shot. Could no one borrow a Canon Rebel from a struggling photography student?

TL;DR: there is better conspiracy videos out there if you are drunk and like a bit of amusement.",1344902400,20,3168,4.6768402154398565
1393241,5,B000053VGY,"Some years ago, the PBS FRONTLINE episode THE SHAKESPEARE MYSTERY introduced me to Edward de Vere, the 17th Earl of Oxford. Having been unable to acquire a video of that fascinating broadcast, I am now quite happy to settle for THE SHAKESPEARE CONSPIRACY as a consolation prize. What a compelling presentation!

I am puzzled by the critical review of this film where the reviewer asks the bizarre question ""Are there any claims that the author of the plays, sonnets and poems may have been German?""  He also points out that the film's producer has an MBA and has written a few books with sensationalist titles. He then complains that the film ""contains some unusually tacky and very old silent film footage {of Othello and Shylock}"" that are racist and anti-semitic.  Well, most silent film footage is indeed very old . . . and Disney's depiction of Native Americans in PETER PAN a generation later is every bit as racist--and gratuitously so!  As to being tacky, the paintings of Giotto might be considered ""tacky and very old"" because Giotto hadn't mastered linear perspective.

I am at a loss to understand how any of the reviewer's complaints actually address the arguments presented in the film itself.  In fact the reviewer fails to respond to even a single one of the specific arguments that the film presents in favor of de Vere's authorship.

Questions about who actually wrote the works of Shakespeare have been surfacing for decades.  However, this year the New Oxford Complete Works of Shakespeare credits Christopher Marlowe with some of the Shakespeare body of work.
Marlowe, Englands foremost playwright before Shakespeare, was supposedly murdered in 1593, just a few days before he was to be sentenced for treason.  He was immediately buried in an unmarked grave which hasn't been found to this day.
Some Shakespeare scholars believe that Marlowe faked his death and spent the rest of his life in hiding as William Shakespeare, an unknown actor who had never written anything before, suddenly appears on the scene writing these classic works.
After 1616, the year the actor died, 14 plays by Shakespeare continue to appear, leading some to believe that Marlowe actually outlived the Bard.
My novel, The Shakespeare Conspiracy by Ted Bacino, tells the story of Marlowes life in hiding as he continues to write.  The last third of the book is a supplement detailing the actual facts pertaining to this theory.
