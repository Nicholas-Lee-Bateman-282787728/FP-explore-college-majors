7986876,5,B00008UAME,"I am really not much of a wrestling fan.  I find most of it to be cheesily acted nonsense where personality types I despise (Hulk Hogan, Steve Austin, The Rock) are set up to be the top attractions and ""heros"".  And they don't inspire any desire to ""root against them"".  Most wrestling just seems repetitive and boring to me.

What do I want out of wrestling that I feel is missing?  I want senseless violence.

XPW prides itself on senseless violence which is what attracted me to check it out.  XPW has put out a lot of non-violent absolutely boring content but when it gets violent, it really delivers the violence.

I have to question all who criticize XPW violence as ""garbage"" wrestling because ""they are not using real wrestling moves"" and just do inflict violence on each other.  Well, if you are interested in ""real wrestling moves"", why not become interested in REAL WRESTLING?  I don't see anything compelling about people using moves that are ""real wrestling moves"" except for the fact that the ""opponent"" is cooperating.

While there certainly is skill going into performing normal WWE / WCW type wrestling, it is something that basically anyone is able to learn with training.

I find much more compelling hardcore wrestling because it takes an uncommon constitution to be able to willfully allow yourself to be brutalized for the entertainment of others.

As I said, this dvd has my favorite wrestling match ever on it.  It is the one between Supreme and Angel the Hardcore Homo.  I am assuming that both are home grown XPW wrestlers and I hope they both turn up in other violent promotions in the future.  I am aware that they were matched up together in at least one other XPW event which is probably my 2nd favorite match ever.

We have the Hardcore Homo who is a smaller guy dressed in pink and often makes flamboyent actions.  On the other side we have the Human Horror Film Supreme is a big bald muscle slug who is less hefty but similar in appearance to King Kong Bundy.

This match is pure sadistic entertainment.  I often broke up laughing at the pure uncompassionate gratuitious violence of it.

There are plenty of beds of barb wire, beds of light bulbs, and combination barbed wire/light bulbs.  Supreme is constantly throwing the Hardcore Homo into another stack of light bulbs or barbed wire without compassion.  The Hardcore Homo also does some successful retaliations by returning the favors.  In one case, throwing Supreme face first busting through a pile of glass.  Soon both combatants have faces entirely red with blood but it doesn't cause any slow down in the level of violence.  At one point, Supreme takes a broken bulb to slowly (and carefully) cut Angels head to the point it is dripping quickly large amounts of blood.

Already bloodied to the point of forcing any WWE hardcore match to wrap thing up, these guys continue to throw each other into beds of barbed wire, often from inside the ring down to outside the ring, slam each other into broken glass.

It was so appallingly unmerciful that I couldn't help crack up constantly during this match.

It finally ended when Supreme through Angel about 5 feet down onto a table with barbed wire and a few light bulbs on it.  And then holding him down for the 3 count.

Not only was the Hardcore Homo's face totally red with blood, his entire shirt front and back as well as much of his legs was totally red.

I really have to admire how someone willingly takes this level of abuse to entertain others.  The intended injury far exceeds what most fear would happen in unintended injury and these guys take far beyond most would even imagine.

While I like the Supreme character more, I have a far greater respect for Angel who took the most sickening abuse of the two.",1126828800,,3757,4.659574468085107
7986877,5,B00008UAME,"I am a big XPW fan/Hardcore fan too. So when I read that this is from XPW I bought it. it is worth every single penny it is so good. So let me give you the run down.
XPW World Tag Team Championships: The New Panthers; vs. Tag Team Champs Mexico's Most Wanted. A great tag team match, alot of high risk moves performed just great. Mexico's Most Wanted is a great tag team in XPW and all around the world and my favorite tag team.
(XPW King of the Deathmatch Championship): King of the Deathmatch Champ Supreme vs. Hardcore ... Angel. This match is worth the video by itself is is great. These two men use everything you can imagine and more. after this match you will be screaming XPW!XPW!XPW!
(XPW TV Title Ladder Match): XPW TV Champ ""Rock Superstar"" Kaos  vs. ""Confederate Currency"" Chris Hamrick. This is a great ladder match some really crazy moves go on but it is XPW.
(XPW World Heavyweight Title Match): ""Living Legend"" Terry Funk vs. XPW World Heavyweight Champion ""The Franchise"" Shane Douglas
This was not a great match because, Terry cut his arm very bad up to the point you can see his muscule and it is very graphic and they stop the match because of it. Then Terry takes off Lizzy close.
This was one of XPW best shows. it had alot of action and alot of hardcore matches. Go out and buy this you won't be ... I promise you that. ...",1057795200,,1346,4.320158102766799
