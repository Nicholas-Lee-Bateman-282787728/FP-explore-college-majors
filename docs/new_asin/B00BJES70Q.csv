Cover art is a copy from a from a original Vampire D Blood DVD you can see it is a photo copy. For the price it is worth it.

8569655,5,B00BJES70Q,"Very happy with this purchase. Was definitely worth it. The video quality is pretty good. Sound is great, disc came in with nothing wrong with it and of course you do get to have your options of Japanese or English. I actually usually prefer the Japanese voice cast on most anime but if I do come across some that sound good with english voices I'll watch it that way. The English voices sounded good on this one. Only watched the first movie but I'm sure the second will be fine too since they are both on the same disc",1425945600,3,520,4.262626262626263
