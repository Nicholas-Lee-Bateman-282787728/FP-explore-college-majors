8208512,5,6302650488,"The reason is simple.  Money.  Copyright laws have changed in recent years and this requires that each and every song that is used in a particular episode, even if the song only played for a few seconds, must be licensed.  This takes time and, more importantly money.  It is quite possible that, in order to get complete episodes on DVD with the same music could make a DVD set prohibitively expensive for most people and thus it will be priced out of the market.  They could replace some of this music with cheaper, generic tunes, but when that has been done in syndicated airings of WKRP longtime fans have revolted.

There is some encouraging news, however.  Amazon is now collecting e-mail addresses of people who want to see WKRP released on DVD.  Just enter ""WKRP"" in a DVD search and give them your e-mail address.  Amazon says they will notify the studio of just how many people are waiting.  Sign up today, and tell as many people as you can to do the same.",1111622400,28,966,4.5

And all of them, not a limited collection, just like all the other great (and many far less than great) TV shows of the past!  Why?  Why? Why?  This was a great show; give it and the many, many fans the treatement we all deserve!",1102118400,10,304,4.357142857142857
