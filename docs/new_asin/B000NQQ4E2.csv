8180779,5,B000NQQ4E2,What's great about this DVD are two specific episodes (4 in total) One one we see Ozzie and Harriet singing on stage together (which I have never seen...only in flashbacks when they were much younger as in a dream or memory) and also there is one episode that Ozzie and his buddies talk about UFOs and it;s fun to hear Ozzie endorse the idea that they may be real...great fun!!,1368748800,,377,4.4
