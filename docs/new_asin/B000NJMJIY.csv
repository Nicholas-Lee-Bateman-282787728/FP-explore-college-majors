2770392,4,B000NJMJIY,"A great movie and Mark Harmon was the reason I ordered it as he is one of my favorite people, I watch him on NCIS every day.",1271894400,3,124,3.6296296296296298
2770393,4,B000NJMJIY,"The film stars Julliane Phillips (Bruce Springsteen's ex), Ron Perlman and Mark Harmon as Jonathan Frayne. Jonathan walks into a radio station with an idea for a radio show where listeners may confess their misdeeds. It leads to a caller confessing to a murder, but Jonathan's  own haunting demons and misdeeds also preoccupy him. As he gets involved in solving the mystery of the caller and the murder he falls deeper into the mire of the murder's psyche. His mystifying past lends an attraction to the suspenseful story.

All of the actors fit well into their parts and do a credible job. There are no extras on the DVD.
When you finish watching this movie you will probably say that it was an interesting thriller/mystery and will be surprised by the twist at the end, so it's a enjoyable acquisition.",1266537600,80,804,4.735714285714286

2770395,5,B000NJMJIY,"Loved watching this obvious low budget movie. Nothing that was over the top and Mark Harmon played the part extremely well.  Apreciated the twist at the end.  Highly unexpected.  Would definitely recommend for purchase and would buy again if something happened to this copy.  I will watch this again, so I am happy with owning.",1245974400,64,327,4.890909090909091

2770411,2,B000NJMJIY,"This was a pretty oring movie, that could have had a lot of potential.  It was a waste of Mark Harmon's talents being in this movie!",1401494400,,132,4.076923076923077
2770412,4,B000NJMJIY,"I love anything Mark Harmon is in.  There were some surprises in this film, but the ending was a disappointment; I wanted a better idea of where the protagonist was headed in life.",1389312000,2,180,4.454545454545454

2770415,3,B000NJMJIY,"We really like Mark Harmon, and are devoted fans of NCIS, but this movie seemed like a ""made for TV"" story, and sort of melodramatic.",1370649600,,133,4.36
2770416,3,B000NJMJIY,"mark harmon is the only thing this movies has going for it. it's okay, it is worth watching one time.",1369958400,2,101,4.1
2770417,4,B000NJMJIY,"This is a very good production, with a compelling story and good acting, especially by Mark Harmon.  His Johnathan Frayne is a departure from his usual gallery of rogues.  Sensitive and vulnerable, reflective and approachable, not anything like you see on NCIS.  Julianne Phillips is also quite good, but hasn't a lot to do...excellent supporting cast.",1368921600,4,352,5.25
2770418,4,B000NJMJIY,"It's a good film to enjoy with the voice, the smile and the way of acting of this actor. It's an intriguing film too. Nevertheless, I believe he is much better actor when he is performing Leroy Jethro Gibbs in NCIS. There, I have seen him playing that incredible role.",1368489600,2,268,4.38

2770420,3,B000NJMJIY,Mark Harmon before NCIS. It was not the most facinating movie. It may have been made for Lifetime Movies. But it was intertaining enough for afternoon intertainment.,1360627200,,165,5.148148148148148
2770421,1,B000NJMJIY,This was a strange movie......great stars in it but the movie itself left me cold.  The movie was delivered in a timely fashion but just would not watch it more than once.,1360108800,,171,4.34375
2770422,5,B000NJMJIY,"Saw it in TV and knew I had to have it. Have most of his movies. Great actor not important what he's doing, comes out great.",1357171200,8,124,3.8076923076923075

2770424,5,B000NJMJIY,"Mark Harmon hasn't made a lot of movies but when he does it's either, like this one, rivating & suspenseful or comical.  This one keeps you glued to it wondering what next will happen.  Different kind of script than most cause you can't figure out who the villan is till you find out at the end.",1318982400,2,295,4.25

2770427,5,B000NJMJIY,"A very interesting choice for Mr Harmon.......not not you would expect from him...

Very well played from a actor who is one of the best actors at the minute.

This movie is not high in action and has a very simple plot, but never the less its has Mr Harmon in it.",1293580800,2,264,4.0576923076923075
