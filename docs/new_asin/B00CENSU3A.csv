5719593,3,B00CENSU3A,"I enjoyed the ova but I'm not too wild on the CGI.
I wold almost scream lazy, compared to the original. For me it looks a bit strange and fake but the animation indeed is fashionable.

Also watch the original if not familar because this is too much clumped together and because of it you are not given enough walkthrough to the character's realtionship with each other.
So its terribly rushed!!
Another crammed anime that delivers only flashy looks and not enough feeling and genuine pace within the anime.
By far to me the best anime is a good plot and stories and not so much vanity in apperaence.",1366761600,5,599,4.495412844036697
5719594,5,B00CENSU3A,"Vast improvement over the first film. The CGI is cleaned up, and visually the movie is just much better. The voice acting for both the English and Japanese dubs are strong, as well as the soundtrack. My one pet peeve is that there is a lot left out from the original manga. The story of Griffith killing the queen is entirely passed over. All in all it's a great addition to the franchise and sets things up nicely for the eclipse.",1366329600,10,431,4.333333333333333

5719688,5,B00CENSU3A,"i didn't know they rebooted the Berserk anime! i stumbled across this by accident and had to watch it. I'm a huge fan of the Berserk Manga series. this is different from the original manga series that came out. some details are different that they didn't show in the series, but did post in the comics.

I wish the story would continue in the manga tv series, minus the pirate boat sequences.",1484697600,,392,4.444444444444445
