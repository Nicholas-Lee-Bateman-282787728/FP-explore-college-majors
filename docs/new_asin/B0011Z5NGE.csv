3070501,5,B0011Z5NGE,"Rachel Ashwell had a show called ""Rachel Ashwell Shabby Chic"" on Style Network a few years back. Her company has released three DVDs from that series: (1) Treasures (2) Gifts, Sentiments & Romance and (3) Flowers, Petals & Gardens.
Each DVD contain 3 episodes so if you buy all three DVDs you will own 9 episodes from the original series. There are many more episodes yet to be released, depending on how well these three initial DVDs sell they'll consider putting out more DVDs.

Here is what you get on this DVD:
1- Flowers
2- Roses
3- Gardens

In the FLOWERS episode Rachel visits a rose farm, a flower market, and the floral department at her local supermarket...all inspirations for her fabrics, home furnishings and decorations.  Rachel also shops a flea market and antique store looking for unique vessels to contain the flowers.  After gathering an abundance of blooms in her kitchen, Rachel displays her vases of flowers throughout her home.

In the ROSES episode Rachel celebrates the rose for its beauty and fragrance, after all it is the quintessential element of Shabby Chic style.  Artist Christie Rapasy demonstrates the process of creating a rose oil painting, using the soft color palette Rachel loves.  Rachel then explains how she matches up the right frame to each painting.  Vintage fabrics purchased from flea markets are inspiration for Rachel's own line of fabrics (with small alterations to the original color, scale, and pattern).  A studio shows the process of creating a new print using the silk screen method.

In the GARDENS episode Rachel and her landscape designer walk through Rachel's own backyard and pool area pointing out plants that best represent Rachel's garden style.  At Peggy Perez's garden, Rachel demonstrates how to press flowers and then Peggy shows the many ways in which to use them.  Rachel visits the Lake Shrine public meditation garden to admire it's beauty and tranquility.  And finally, back home, Rachel talks about why she uses colorful terry cloth to cover the cushions and pillows on her outdoor patio furniture.",1215561600,15,2071,5.02046783625731
3070502,5,B0011Z5NGE,I just loved this dvd Rachell explains so well all about the beautiful flowers that are her favourites and mine as well. Just loved all her advice that you can use anything you like as a vase. Flowers can really brighten up your day. Their fragrances around the home make you feel so warm and fuzzy and no matter what state the house is in flowers make me feel at home. Loved the dvd. Good on you Rachel. All the best Christina.xx,1211155200,3,430,4.2560975609756095

8243039,1,B0011Z5NGE,don't buy it... did not learn much. it really was not a good buy... wish I could return it ...,1381190400,,94,3.75
8243040,2,B0011Z5NGE,"Ok in all fairness I didn't know that this was a TV program (I haven't had television for about 5 or 6 years now; as I would rather be doing something, reading a good book, painting, creating things and working in my garden when I can or searching the internet to learn about things and so on)and duh me I didn't read the reviews I just saw the picture of roses and the word garden and the price when I bought it. Had I read the reviews I would not have bought this video as it is not a how to. The only thing I found for me that was sort of interesting was the silk screening of the fabric (wish they had gone into more details) and the pressed flowers which I already do so at least I could relate to that. They do have some beautiful scenery. If you just want to watch something to kill time or see how the other half lives you might enjoy this but, as for me it was a waste of money and time.",1317427200,,896,3.9285714285714284

8243043,5,B0011Z5NGE,I love Rachel Ashwell's design asthetic. I was so happy to learn her tv show was put in DVD - I still don't know why it was ever canceled. I enjoy watching the videos - it always inspires me to either have tea and biscuits or go to a flea market.,1245024000,4,246,3.843137254901961
8243044,5,B0011Z5NGE,"My wife loves Shabby Chic Rachel Ashwell. She is sad that she went out of business and she is sure that she will be back. Very inspiritational.

8243045,3,B0011Z5NGE,"The videos are lovely, well done, a bit on the short side for the price, but OK. I must say, though, that I was extremely disappointed that these were not complete episodes of the show she did for E! I discovered her there quite by accident and liked her philosophy of cherishing old things for their flaws and the beauty of age. I taped most of those shows and then lost the tapes in Katrina. When I heard there would be DVDs, I was excited...even pre-ordered them. I'm not sorry I did, but I am disappointed. I would hope her vast creative ""empire"" would consider going the full-episode route with subsequent releases.",1217289600,14,620,4.544642857142857
