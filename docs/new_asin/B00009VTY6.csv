1891779,5,B00009VTY6,"If your looking for an informative,close-up look at one of the best bands around,then this is it. Blackie Lawlwess is honest,intelligent and sincere,proving that there is a smart man behind the madness. W.A.S.P. is the only band that took what Alice Cooper started and did their on thing with it. The clips are rare and entertaining and probably the best documentary on a metal band ever. Chris Holmes is drunk throughout his segments,giving us cool information and laughs along the way. If you can find this video,you will be inpressed.",1008806400,7,537,4.977777777777778

7993420,5,B00009VTY6,"Cool, video tape indeed, lots of awesome music videos from 1984 to 1987. Blackie Lawless explains how the band met and got started with their controversial lyrics and stage shows at concerts and later running into problems with the PMRC. This tape also has some great interviews from Chris Holmes and Johnny Rod. If you are a fan of Wasp like myself  then do yourself a favor for the group and get ahold of this totally rockin, vhs tape now!",1413158400,2,441,4.5125

7993423,5,B00009VTY6,"I love, love, love Ginuwine vocals & his moves are crazy sexy.  After listening to the new TGT Three Kings I found myself craving more from Ginuwine.  I am a TGT (Tyrese, Ginuwine & Tank)addict.  But my 1st & all time favorite has always been Ginuwine, his voice, or his sexy looks or his smooth moves never get old.",1378512000,,316,4.322033898305085
7993424,5,B00009VTY6,I bought this video back in 1988  and I still Have it and it is always  number#1  keep it if you are a truly Hardcore W.A.S.P. Fan.,1266624000,,131,3.7777777777777777
7993425,4,B00009VTY6,"These videos capture many of Ginuwine's great moments in music, but what I want to know is why if the title is ""the videos"" why would you leave out four of his videos from the 90's? Four of the videos missing were, ""Holler,"" ""When Doves Cry,"" ""Pony (Remix),"" and ""Same Ol' G."" That's why I think they should do another DVD for Ginuwine, making sure that they put all of his videos and maybe even some more extras, because if they can remember to put his more recent videos like, ""Hell Yeah"" and ""In Those Jeans""(don't really capture his talent) they can remember to put his classic work from the 90's! That's why I gave this item 4 stars.",1121644800,5,638,4.369747899159663
7993426,5,B00009VTY6,"GO Get This, it has every ginuwine video, except Pony (Remix), When Doves Cry, Holler, Same Ol'G and Just Because.",1090108800,6,114,4.75
7993427,5,B00009VTY6,"I didn't even see this dvd being advertised, but I was searching through the music dvds in the store and found it. Since I'm a big fan of Ginuwine, I had to get it. ""When Doves Cry"" and ""Same Ol' G"" are not on here but its still worth purchasing.  I love watching Ginuwine dance.",1083456000,5,279,4.072727272727272
