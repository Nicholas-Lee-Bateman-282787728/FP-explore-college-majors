8296272,5,B001E454MK,"This 3 part series is fantastic. The first 25 minutes of part one feels cheesy, but it's only once you've passed that point that you realize that the cheesiness was intentional, and from there forward this is a simply wonderful drama about a man who dearly loves his girlfriend, his son, and his aging father, but is critically handicapped by a gambling addiction. This series is so full of honesty and heart that even a cynic like me was touched by it. BBC should make this available to region 1 so that it can be appreciated by a wider audience.
A full 5 stars.",1416441600,,563,4.423076923076923
