3803346,5,B001UP4Z50,"This is a great view of a great city!  I'm not sure when it was filmed, and a few things have changed since, but it really captured the ""feel"" and diversity of New York.  I know I'll watch and enjoy it again and again, and with greater appreciation after each time I visit there from my home in San Francisco.  If you haven't been to New York City, you've got to go -- ASAP!  But watch this DVD first.",1298764800,2,401,4.037974683544304
3803347,4,B001UP4Z50,"After watching so many travel programs that get bogged down with so-called local color and interests, it was great to find one that just concentrates on showing you the city. I'll buy more of this series.",1294099200,2,204,4.694444444444445
3803348,5,B001UP4Z50,"View ALL of NYC just like the area visable from atop the Empire State Building. This DVD is aerial footage done in high-definition from a helicopter mounted camera. There is plenty of amazing zooms to see up close, also. It was first filmed in 2004, so fairly current when released, even showing work being done at Ground Zero. Regular almost an hour feature was shown on PBS but the bonus footage (20 minutes) is unseen on public TV.

The content consists of much architecture, and the narrator gives interesting information (like a tour guide or 1st rate travelogue presenter) including historical items as the film runs. You never have to look at the narrator. He gives accounts of many buildings, bridges, Central Park, Bronx Zoo, Coney Island, Ground Zero (including seeing the only sculpture to survive), an extensive portion of night filming (the city never sleeps) & of course so much more. It's a packed hour. There are identifying captions for structures/locations displayed on the feature and the bonus segment.

No subtitles--but we did get the CC words to appear, just as good as subtitles.
Bonus footage includes music, as does the feature, which is a wide variety of style from Jazz to Classical; instrumental and some with vocal. The bonus segment does not have narration, but does include the structure captions and the music. It could be used as a CD music background while working around the house, the music is that good.

A significant DVD for architectural education, NYC history, and travel fans. The only thing missing is the city smells. On one visit, this reviewer camped outside the city and trained in for a full day of sightseeing. Nothing could be seen as well as this DVD does it. Plus we all noticed the smells. When I returned to our campground and showered, I could literally smell the city washing off. You'll miss the smells with this DVD, but the visual and audio is astounding.

If you like this, check out the other ""Visions of:"" series, all helicopter filmed in Europe. They are equally awesome and Amazon available.",1273017600,20,2056,4.849002849002849
3803349,5,B001UP4Z50,I remember first seeing this on PBS a long time ago and not being able to afford it because it was so expensive.  Can't commentate the quality of the DVD as I have yet to receive it ::::grrrr::::  but if it's the same as the show on TV I'll be immensely pleased,1468195200,,261,4.0

3803359,5,B001UP4Z50,I love this DVD.  Reminds me of my time in the big City.  Its slightly out of date now that the WTC is mostly finished but the reverence they display for the WTC rebuilding and site are really nice.,1394236800,,198,4.051282051282051
3803360,4,B001UP4Z50,"As I am planning to visit New York and stay for one month, the DVD helps me to virtually fly over the places and buildings I want to visit. I  now feel quite familiar with New York,",1389398400,,181,3.891891891891892
3803361,5,B001UP4Z50,"Magnificent  photography, particularly the views from the air day and especially at nightfall.  I am a former resident of NYC now living in the upper midwest. After almost 7 years away from New York, all I can say is ""Once a New Yorker, always a New Yorker"".  A wonderful experience to behold.",1384387200,,293,4.596153846153846

3803363,5,B001UP4Z50,It was a very well shot panorama of New Yorks attractions and touristyness that's a must view if you have reservations about visiting the 'Big Apple'.,1372982400,,150,4.8076923076923075
3803364,5,B001UP4Z50,Perfectly described! My girlfriend loves it. He's never bee to new York so I bought her this DVD so she could get a glimpse of NY,1325721600,,129,4.0
3803365,5,B001UP4Z50,"In Sept - Oct 2011, my wife and I, spent some 10 days walking streets of Manhattan and enjoyed it very much.  But the balloon view or helicopter view that you get to see in this DVD is fantastic.  It is highly professional and extremely enjoyable.  One can never see NYC like this on his own.  We have been to most countries in the world and we do not hesitate to give 5 star to this DVD and the persons behind it. The quality of picture as well as direction of movies is absolutely top class. Do see before you go to NYC.  Amit Shah (India)",1319932800,8,541,4.066037735849057
3803366,5,B001UP4Z50,"Due to unwillingness of my girlfriend to host me and the expensive hotel charge at New York, I decided to give myself a treat by buying this DVD.  It is very good and gives me some idea how the city is.  My mother notice the DVD right away and asked me to loan to her to watch it with my Dad. For a challenged person, this is a nice subsitution of travel at home. I may not know the city enough, but I like what I have seen with the different kind of music.  Please only use my comments as a reference if you have loved one trapped in the house and would like to see places.",1317513600,,574,3.888888888888889
3803367,5,B001UP4Z50,"I've always dreamed of flying over New York in a helicopter. Although that dream is yet to come true, this dvd is the closest thing so far. The night shots are incredible. You won't be disappointed.",1314403200,2,198,4.527777777777778
3803368,3,B001UP4Z50,"An almost worthy addition to the 'Vision' series, Manhattan is captured beautifully in this aerial portrait. However I would place this on the lower end of the 'Visions' series. First, it has become quite dated since its original production in 2004. It needs updating. Second, the video spends too much time flying over Manhattan and driving on a double decker bus at night with the camera pointed at the street. Sure Manhattan is beautiful at night but do we need 25% of the video devoted to this? And last, the video does not cover the entirety of New York City. New York City is more than just Manhattan. The other four boroughs, Brooklyn, The Bronx, Queens, and Staten Island also need their time seen from the skies. This video reminds me of the Indian folktale about the blind men and the elephant. Each man touches a part of the elephant and declares what he knows an elephant is; the man who touches the trunk assumes it is a snake, etc. This video is woefully incomplete.",1300147200,6,980,4.605714285714286
8344615,5,B001UP4Z50,Very prompt shipping of this item and really enjoy the DVD. This is one of many similar programs I have to watch while on the treadmill. They make exercising a pleasure rather than a chore.,1520208000,,189,4.428571428571429
8344616,5,B001UP4Z50,"A little dated for 2018, it is still a spectacular tour of NYC post 9/11.  Great music and beautiful helicopter views.  I would say that if this were shot today it would be done by drones, but this movie came out pre drone, which I suppose is a bygone era of shooting aerial footage.",1517011200,,283,4.222222222222222
8344617,4,B001UP4Z50,"This highly-entertaining tour of New York City, focusses largely on Manhattan, taking viewers from Battery Park to Harlem, occasionally offering little pearls of wisdom about its most iconic buildings, structures and spaces (the Guggenheim Museum is best experienced by starting from the top so you can take in the artwork on the walls of its distinctive circular design as you make your way down). Though necessarily painted in broad strokes with a running time of just under an hour, this PBS program hits all the expected highlights, from Ellis Island to Wall Street, jazz clubs, museums, Broadway and Times Square. Backed by a blend of jazz and classical music, narrator Frank Deford waxes enthusiastically to often-stunning aerial photography of the streets and skyscrapers, most notably in a sequence covering Central Park. While lifelong New Yorkers won't be surprised by much of the material, anyone familiar with the City That Never Sleeps will bask in the brisk editing and many shots of the constantly moving city from street level and above. Recommended for ages 12 to 18 as well as adults. I give this 4 out of 5 stars.  Reviewed by Michael F., KIDS FIRST! Juror.
