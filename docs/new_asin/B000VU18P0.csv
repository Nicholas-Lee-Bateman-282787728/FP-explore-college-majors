8283277,1,B000VU18P0,"When I put the DVD in my DVD player I got a NO DISC error message even after trying several times.  I then put the DVD in my computer was it was able to load.  I wanted to watch the DVD on the large screen not a 12"" monitor so I was very disappointed.  I will keep the DVD because I haven't seen anything else on Cuba and I don't feel like packaging it up to return.  I have not yet watched the DVD.  The DVD has a purple color to it on the side that gets read and I wonder if that is why my player couldn't recognize it.",1286841600,,521,3.7
