8764125,5,B01GWE0A5W,"This was exceptional film, because it detailed Commander SS Franz Stangl of Treblinka, the film is accurate portrayal of an arch villain, not a novice to euthanasiax but expert murder. The film's weak point didn't mention Kurt Franz, Christian Wirth, or Odilo Globocnik.",1520812800,,270,5.3023255813953485
8764126,5,B01GWE0A5W,"Originally found this documentary series on YouTube.  Waited and looked for it to be available in the U.S. for what it seems like forever.  FINALLY jackpot!!!  You learn so much from this series.  It goes beyond the war and find out what these monsters did before, during, after the war, and for some their eventual capture.  Too bad so many Nazi criminals got away for the rest of their lives.  Never give up.  I would want to know where there bones are laid and I think that any country that gave them refuge should be penalized somehow.  I don't know how to punish them but no country and no person (that one pope--Pope Pius) should have helped them escape from owning up to their crimes.  If you are a fan of WWII documentaries you will like this.",1474156800,,751,4.423357664233577
