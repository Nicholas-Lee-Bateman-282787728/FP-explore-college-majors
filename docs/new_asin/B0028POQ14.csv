8356615,4,B0028POQ14,"I like this package because I'm writing a book for the family about Dad's experiences flying the P-47 Thunderbolt in France in 1944-45, and I find it helpful to understand the operation of this aircraft in order to better understand his stories.  This is entirely for the head--nothing for the heart--but it's valuable to see the Army Air Corps' cut on introducing their young pilots to the aircraft they will be flying in combat, and that  may save their lives due to the ruggedness of its design and construction.  This is a good introductory tutorial if you know little or nothing about the P-47.  I'm glad I have it, and I will likely rewatch it during the ongoing course of my writing to make sure I haven't missed anything I should have included about the aircraft.",1407024000,,771,4.647058823529412
