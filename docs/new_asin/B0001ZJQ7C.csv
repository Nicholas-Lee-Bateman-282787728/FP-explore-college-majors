8018880,5,B0001ZJQ7C,"I really like this video that sums up the book with all the important points.  Toddlerese, and the Fast Food Rule have worked well for gaining the attention of my tantruming 28 month old.  In my opinion, the book is too repetitive.  The video and CD are far more clearly to the point and very helpful in teaching more effective communication skills.  For a compatible book with hundreds of additional quick read discipline suggestions for parents of toddlers and preschoolers, I highly recommend THE POCKET PARENT by Gail Reichlin.  Just look up the annoying behavior at hand and come away with fast answers to such behaviors as Anger, Bad Words, Biting, Bedtime and Mealtime Refusals, Sibling Fights, Not Listening, Power Struggles, Manners, Tantrums, Separation Anxiety, Lying and Whining.",1104105600,33,791,5.1484375

 I posted a review 2 days ago then realized that I made a mistake.
It should read:
After having so much success with the Happiest Baby on the Block calming techniques, I could not wait to watch The Happiest Toddler on the Block by Harvey Karp,M.D.
My 22 month old grandson  began to scream when I told him it was time to go inside.  I spoke ""toddlerese"" with much expression as suggested by Dr. Karp.
  I said, "" No No No"" you do not want to go inside.
  He looked at me very surprised.
  I said, ""No No No"" you do not want to go inside.
  He looked at me again with his mouth wide open.
  I said again, ""No No No you do not want to go inside, but we must take sister to potty.""
  ---------he came with me without protest.  In the past he would have continued screaming for about 5 minutes and
I would have picked him up kicking and screaming.
Now I can't wait to read the book The Happiest Toddler on the Block to get more helpful suggestions for the children in my family and in my practice.

I give it five stars! Debbie Farmer, parenting author of 'Don't Put Lipstick on the Cat'",1082505600,12,259,4.395833333333333
