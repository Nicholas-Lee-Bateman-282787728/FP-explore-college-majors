I really liked seeing how they come together as a community and help one another. ( OH WELL ),1533772800,,265,4.215686274509804
8725221,5,B0121626VQ,"I saw season 2 on Hulu and liked it so much I bought season One and liked it just as much. It does, however, have some contrivances like you might suspect, BUT these people are absolutely real and they live in or close to Port Protection. I generally don't watch the so-called ""reality"" shows cause most all are a joke. I got the product very fast and in perfect condition so all is very good, thank you very much!! :--)",1472860800,3,420,4.2625
