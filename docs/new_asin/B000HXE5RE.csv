8142362,5,B000HXE5RE,"These super-short little 50 minute films covering the 1970 thru 1980 seasons of F1 leave the viewer SCREAMING for more footage, but at least it's SOMETHING, as getting our U.S. hands on anything F1 is as unlikely as finding a suitcase full of cash on the sidewalk! One would've thought that by now a lot of F1 historical material released on VHS would've found its way into U.S. DVD players by now, but sadly we are instead flooded with national, rather than international, motorsport such as the idiotic oval racing of NASCAR or the FAR inferior IndyCar 24/7. Oh well, we must be content with the few snippets we can get. This F1 fan hopes for a day when all of the F1 releases that ever made it to VHS be rereleased to the U.S. in DVD form. That is all.",1379030400,2,755,4.361702127659575
8142363,5,B000HXE5RE,"The 1974 F1 Season on Video was awesome.  Enjoyed the actual footage, interviews and overall documentary.  Will surely order more videos of different years in the F1 saga.",1374624000,2,171,5.071428571428571
