2793734,1,B000OCY7KI,"Be warned.  The historical Ruffian is not to be found in this movieland fluffery put together by people who didn't do their homework, who made up what they could not be bothered to portray accurately.

Movies hardly ever get horse racing right. Seabiscuit was the closest approach I have seen, but even that movie had problems. Ruffian is loaded with problems.

WHY WHY WHY do movies with racing invariably confabulate odd little human subplots that anyone with any knowledge of the sport knows are pure hokum? I do KNOW the sport, having raised, handled, and raced my own horses, and having written about the sport professionally. The actual history of Ruffian was compelling enough without the make-believe elements of this movie.

The horses used to portray the title character were some of the coarsest, plainest beasts imaginable. Ruffian--the real one--was a tall, nearly 17 hand filly, quite leggy and graceful. With all the cast-off TBs available for purchase on a per-pound meat price basis, couldn't at least one been found for close shots that did not look like a chunky pony???

I am sure that many people in racing would have cheerfully advised the movie's makers on details, gratis, just to be sure things were not gotten laughably wrong. The notion that Claiborne Farm, in the 1970s, shipped horses in a rusty beige trailer with ""CF"" on the side is silly. Claiborne was and is one of the last remaining family, multi-generational outfits, and has been involved not just with foaling and raising good horses, but in shaping and influencing the breed globally. It is not a marginal operation without presence or reputation. Go to the farm, and note that the gates, the (very large) water tower, the trim on the main stallion barn--are all painted Cadmium Yellow, the farm colors. Rusty beige trailers? Pulled by aged pickup trucks? I think not.

This was a FICTIONAL movie appropriating the name of a real filly, and beyond that, not much more. It was never really explained why Ruffian was extraordinary--the movie makers seemed confused between stakes record time and track record time--or that she had an average winning margin of 7 lengths after 10 races, or that there has never been anything like her since, and in what seems a glaring omission, there was no hint of all the advances in caring for catastrophic breakdowns since 1975. Foolish Pleasure's reputation was inflated beyond what it was at the time--he was a good 3-y-o, but not a great one, and he finished his days in obscurity, pasture-breeding mares somewhere out west.

Watch this howler as maudlin fiction, but be warned that it is fiction, and has not much to do with the real Ruffian or the real sport.

No wonder Frank Whiteley and Jacinto Vasquez sought to legally block the airing of this movie without adequate disclaimers.",1181433600,95,2813,4.907368421052632
2793735,3,B000OCY7KI,"Sorry, but what was supposed to be a major theatrical release on July 26( the theatres in our area had this ""coming to theatres"" trailers) was somehow reduced to a made-for-television, release-to-dvd cheap low budget melodrama. After very lackluster reviews of the book and film came out in the NY Times I suppose that the producers felt that it would be too risky a proposition to put RUFFIAN in the theaters. I think they were right!

Horses and horse racing as well as films have been a lifelong passion for me. I saw the ill-fated Match Race on t.v. as a college student in 1975. I also had the distinct pleasure of seeing Ruffian run and win The Sorority, The Spinaway and the CCA Oaks. She WAS as magnificent as anything the world has ever seen. Being a Marylander, we claimed Ruffian as our own, though technically she was a Kentucky bred as her sire, Reviewer, was standing stud in Kentucky. Her dam, Shenanigans was as Maryland as Maryland could be, as she was a daughter of the great Native Dancer,who stood stud in Baltimore County. Her owners, the Janneys, also lived in the ""valley"" (as we say here!). Her trainer, Frank Whiteley was also a Marylander and had trained the famous Horse of the Year, Damascus, in 1966-1968. After Ruffian's tragic death, a video was produced showing her ten victories from start to finish,as well as her ""breaking down"" against Foolish Pleasure.( It used to be available through a video sales outlet specializing in horse products). It was documentarian in style with narration; pretty straightforward.

Now ...back to this film. On the positive side, RUFFIAN does do a good job at chronicling her racing career. The SLO-MO showing of her breaking her joint is quite graphic and will probably be very disturbing to young viewers...so WARNING! The film also does an excellent job at showing the decline in interest (which has gotten worse) in horse racing in America and how the NYRA (New York Racing Association) wanted to capitalize upon Ruffian and Foolish Pleasure in order to ""revive"" interest in the sport.(NOTE: match racing had become obsolete by the 1970's and fortunately these kind of events were rarely if at all  in America after Ruffian's breakdown, which was noted in the end credits. Another interesting point that is brought out in the match race call (by retired and legendary track announcer Dave Johnson)
is that Ruffian and Foolish Pleasure ran the first quarter mile in .22 and 1/5 seconds. For those interested, that is way too fast for horses to be running safely at a mile-and-a-quarter distance. That was very true.(This is what happens in match races: horses go ""all out"" and it really is dangerous)Also, the film does correctly point out that Ruffian DID break her other leg coming out of the anesthesia (always the biggest concern apart from infection).Another point of interest NOT noted in the film is that Ruffian and Foolish Pleasure were actually related in that they both had the same paternal grandsire, Bold Ruler, who had been known as a sire that brought speed and unsoundness to the breed. Also, Ruffian's damsire, Native Dancer, also infused the breed with knee problems.(Just a few notes of interest!)

NOW...for the NOT so positive: this film really falters due to the  ""saccharin"" of the script and the really inane dialogue that relies on stereotypical characters and cliche. The film seems to be intent on being G-rated (remember: this film was to originally be a theatrical release when it was started)  and geared to a family audience. The sentimentality is SO forced that as a horse race lover AND a film devotee I was truly torn. I thought the world of Ruffian, but this film has a very low budget look to it, and the acting from the news reporters and extras is right out ABC Family or Lifetime. It is REALLY bad!!!Frank Whiteley and the Janney's are not the slightest bit like what they were portrayed (this is not even a Hollywoodized production...it is cheaper that that!)  Even the soundtrack is appropriately syrupy. Sorry, but I am glad I taped this off of television where I had to pay nothing!

My conclusion is that for info,RUFFIAN is  accurate, but the execution as a film is woefully inadequate for a champion of her stature. It was somewhat interesting that the filly Rags to Riches won the Belmont Stakes over the colt Curlin two hours before RUFFIAN was aired as if Ruffian and her sex had somehow been vindicated!",1181433600,3,4423,4.809210526315789
2793736,5,B000OCY7KI,"I watched this movie last night on TV and absolutely loved it.  I remember when Ruffian died and this movie brought it all back for me.  It showed what a fantastic horse Ruffian was and how beautiful she was to watch.  The last half hour was very hard to watch but I recommend it

to anyone.  I am actually going to buy a copy for my Father - I know he will love it.",1181433600,2,366,3.891891891891892
2793737,5,B000OCY7KI,"Ruffian is perhaps the greatest racehorse of all-time.  I have all of her races and have watched them repeatedly.  It never gets any easier to watch the Great Match Race and this dramatization doesn't soften the blow AT ALL.  The last thirty minutes of this film are incredibly difficult to watch.  Horseracing is as dark as it is beautiful and Ruffian was the darkest and most beautiful of all.

This DVD includes some excellent bonus features including nearly all of her races in their entirety (including the Match Race), an interview with Nack, a documentary featuring Jane Schwartz, Frank Whiteley, Jacinto Vasquez and others, a tribute comparing Ruffian and Barbaro etc. Worth every penny and more.",1181347200,99,704,5.0344827586206895
2793738,5,B000OCY7KI,"This was shown shortly after the Belmont Race and, interestingly, a filly names Rags to Riches won that race. The timing couldn't have been more perfect as a set-up to the film about another fily, the great Ruffian, starring Sam Shepherd as Ruffian's trainer. For anyone who loves horses or horse racing, this is a must-see, telling the story of a horse with such heart, such a drive to race - and of the people who worked with her, including her extraordinary trainer.
  Ruffian was undefeated in 10 races against other fillies and the movie leads up to a match against Foolish Pleasure. In other words, male against female. I won't say more because you deserve to see this film and experience the thrill of entering the world of racing, trainers, jockeys, etc. In any case, I was riveted. There were some slow parts, but mostly it was pure joy to watch.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Barbaro-A-Nation-s-Horse/dp/B000PC704M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Barbaro - A Nation's Horse</a>

2793784,5,B000OCY7KI,I followed the career of Secretariat the year before this filly came into the picture.  I loved watching her run and hearing news about her winning races and I was looking forward to seeing the race between her and Foolish Pleasure.  I honestly thought she could and would have beat him.

This movie is a testament to a great horse, caring trainer and wonderful owners. The only downside is it is a 4 handkerchief movie......................but worth every tear.

So if one wants to nitpick they will find them in this movie as well. But if you look past that and take the movie on a whole, I thought it was very good. It showed and told what a wonderful horse she truly was. It showed the glory and pressure of owning and training a great one. Also showed the tragedy that can befall.

In the movie and in real life there were some opinions that her bumping the starting gate, the track course and a pigeon that flew up, any of which they thought may have caused her breakdown. However i went back and viewed the real footage, and the horse broke down before the pigeon crossed her path. She was a very refined horse and it just does not take much with all that weight landing on one leg to cause it to break. It is certain that this horse was truly one of the Great ones. She was to fillies was Secretariat was to colts. The perfect horse. Secretariat was big, bold, beautiful and had just as wonderful disposition as good looks. The same for Ruffian, she was tall, elegant, refined and had a good disposition. Both were a sight to behold whether standing or running. And will forever be remembered.",1388620800,,1335,4.34

And there weren't any putdowns about her like there was Phar Lap or Seabiscuit. She was put in only filly/mare races until her last race when she was to face the fastest colt and she sadly broke one of her legs. She was nearly able to be saved when the vets were able to correct the breakage in/on her leg. They should have put her in a horse sling after surgery so she could be standing. But instead, she was struggling too much and broke another leg and it left them no other option but to put her down.

Ruffian's death was very sad. But it did inspire the horse racing industy to not let anymore match races happen. She could have had some great foals if she had lived.

It is a great movie, wonderful acting, wonderful story, etc. I highly recommend it to any horse people...scratch that. I highly recommend it to ANYONE, horsey or not.

If you watch this you should know that in the match race at Belmont they have a grueling scene where Ruffian is running and then they zoom onto her legs and her front leg LITERALLY SNAPS in half. Younger children should not watch this scene. It is very sad. Also later on in the movie Ruffian shatters her other leg (though they don't show it) and it is heartbreaking.

SPOILER:  *(Ruffian DOES end up needing to be put down at the end.)*

WARNING: This is not like the Secretariat story. (Which i recommend as well!)
It doesn't leave you with a warm, feel-good feeling at the end.

However, I, loving ALL that has to do with horses and horse racing, wanted to know Ruffian's story. I'm glad I watched this movie.",1299456000,3,894,4.487654320987654

His NAME was FOOLISH PLEASURE.  He sadly from what I understand did not do well at stud because for some absurd reason a prejudice against him because he was the horse Ruffian raced against when she broke down.

But the film is well worth seeing and the storyline is very good and down to earth. Still remember watching the race with my father. Acually thought the colt would beat her--but when the race started-I knew I was wrong. The dvd even shows Ruffian's races. Great footage. She never beat a colt but I don't think there were many at that time that could have beat her! After watching this film, I thought, why not make a film of Secratariat. and now i understand they are!

I didn't get to view the race, but heard the terrible news the next day. I actually knew very little about Ruffian, but was intrigued by the little I had heard, that she was incredibly fast, but also very high strung and wild, and that was what caused her to self-destruct when they tried to save her. I satisfied my curiosity in the last year by purchasing the movie. Not knowing the details of her life, I found the movie to be both engrossing and heartbreaking. I cried for the last half hour, as knowing the end of the story made it even more difficult to watch. Not long afterward, I bought Jane Schwartz's excellent book, Burning From The Start. She filled in many of the details the movie wasn't able to cover, and I found that I cared even more for this incredible filly who had won so many hearts in her short life.

2793980,5,B000OCY7KI,"This was a fantastic movie and deserves to be shelved beside the greatest of horse race movies (Seabiscuit, Phar Lap...). This is the story of Ruffian, a filly who won every race and was always out front. She broke every track record with blistering speed and beautiful style. Even the trainer of the great Secretariat said that he thought she was better than him. It's too bad that a match race was set for Ruffian to run against Foolish Pleasure, a colt who won the Kentucky Derby and got second in the Preakness Stakes and the Belmont, to see who would win on the grueling Belmont track to attract the people to the tracks again and to see who would win, the race of the sexes. After coming out of the starting gate she hit the side of it, injuring herself but still kept on running. When she was drawing away from Foolish Pleasure, winning the race to the wire to broke down, while Foolish Pleasure kept on running and ""won,"" the race...
I won't tell you more, but this is a wonderful movie showing us the spirit of these wonderful thoroughbreds at their best! If you love horse racing, and enjoyed watching Dreamer, Seabiscuit or Phar Lap, this is a movie to see. I've read the book Ruffian: Burning from the Start by Jane Schwartz before I saw the movie, and it is very similar and keeps to the story except for the interactions/conversations between Frank Whiteley and the journalist Bill Nack. Bill Nack wrote a book on Ruffian, stitching himself into the story so ESPN could have the rights to make the film, despite the trainer/jockey themselves refusing to give them permission to make a movie on the famous filly... well, that's Hollywood for you.

2793984,4,B000OCY7KI,"I'm like many other reviewers in that I remember watching Ruffian's match race.  The beauty of watching her race and the horror of watching her not only breakdown during a race but also refuse to stop racing are indescribable.  Did the movie capture that emotion?  No.

I found the movie to be too melodramatic and overly sentimental.  As some other reviewers have no doubt mentioned, they didn't get horse racing exactly right, but I am always willing to forgive them that.  What I regret is that they never seemed to manage to capture the spirit of Ruffian - her fire, her drive, her incandescence.  That was the essence of Ruffian and why she was not just another fast horse but a legend, even before her death.

But if you have any fondness for horses or horse racing, you should buy this CD any way for two reasons.  One, it includes a Sports Century Flashback of the match race, including interviews with Whiteley, Vasquez, Janney's son, and exercise riders who were around Ruffian.  The Sports Century show hits all the notes that the movie some how misses.

Second, if the pain of losing Ruffian leaves you in tears, you can ease the pain by watching the video of her races and appreciating just how special she really was.

If you want to read more about her, I strongly recommend Schwarz's excellent book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ruffian-Burning-From-the-Start/dp/B000XUAD1S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ruffian: Burning From the Start</a>",1208736000,4,1497,5.243697478991597

The third and final jewel of The Triple Crown. I remember hearing of Ruffian's story when I was a child, but was never well informed of her story from its humble beginning, to its tragic ending. I thoroughly enjoyed this film, and purchased it when was first released on DVD. It is a film that I continue to enjoy every time I watch it, and Ruffian is a horse that I grow more fondly of as a result. My grandfather loved horse racing, and if he were alive today, I am confident that he would have enjoyed the film the same way I have. Though Ruffian has long since passed, her beauty, as spoken of in the film, will never fade. She did make a lasting impression on not only the sport, but upon all of the hearts and minds of the people who love and adore these creatures just as I do. Her career was as Mr. Nack stated, ""An Unfinished Symphony"" I know that he spoke of ""The Great Match Race"" as the unfinished symphony of horse racing. However, I feel that Ruffian's breakdown and subsequent passing transcended the sport.

2794008,3,B000OCY7KI,"As these ESPN Original Entertainment productions have gone over the years, this is arguably the finest, though with several controversies, which the movies seemingly cannot run away from.

Originally airing June 9, 2007, on ABC, Sam Shepard does a commendable job portraying Ruffian's trainer, Frank Whiteley. With much of the focus on Ruffian's performances, the staged racing shots are good, especially with then Belmont Park race announcer Dave Johnson - portraying himself - recreating his work. But with the availability of most of the actual racing footage - used as part of a wealth of bonus features - would have been a major plus.

The story-telling element is strange, as it evolves into the relationship between Whiteley and reporter William Nack (played by Frank Whaley). Nack penned an ESPN Books-published recollection on Ruffian, which was not a movie tie-in, entitled, Ruffian: A Race Track Romance. At times the script bogs down in scenes where Nack - who works on special projects for ESPN - seemingly towers over the trainer and racer.

There is rightfully heavy emphasis on the July 6, 1975, ""Battle of the Sexes"" match-race between Ruffian and Kentucky Derby champion, Foolish Pleasure. With more than 50,000 fans jammed into Belmont Park and an estimated 18 million TV viewers, Ruffian suffered a hideous breakdown of her right foreleg and was euthanized one day later when she broke the cast and another leg after surgery, which lasted 12 hours.

The bonus features puts the real story in its true historic perspective. It includes an interview (surprise!) with Nack and an important conversation with Jane Schwartz, who wrote the definitive biography on Ruffian, the 1991 release, Ruffian: Burning From the Start.

The movie alone does not tell the complete the story. The DVD bonus features and books by Schwartz & Nack will give a more complete picture on a phenomenal filly who ultimately was a victim of human ego and media greed.",1196640000,5,1958,5.087227414330218

2794010,5,B000OCY7KI,".......was the one where her life was at stake. Ruffian, the name inspires awe, love, respect and harrowing sadness in anyone who loves horses and horse races. Having owned a filly that came from the tracks myself my heart went out to this black, courageous and lovely filly who surrendered her life to what she loved most: Running like the wind

Nothing could stop her, she was always ahead, she beat anyone who crossed her path and she was always fighting.....until....the year 1975 brought the Big Match race where ""the battle of the sexes"" was to be decided. Foolish Pleasure vs. Ruffian, that alone promised the breaking of every single record. As usual, Ruffian got ahead rather quickly when.... To this day my heart feels like it's dying when I remember the awful SNAP that broke Ruffian's leg. In this movie this moment is so cruelly realistic that I couldn't help but scream out as if I could feel her pain..... The last twenty minutes of the film turned me into a sobbing mess, those twenty minutes made me forget whatever inaccuracies there were in this movie. Not her courage, not her big heart and not her spirit could save Ruffian's life, though she fought like a pro, of course. At merely three years of age (Still a baby in horse years) Ruffian was mercifully put down to end her suffering. And now I hope that this filly of all fillies is running free in heaven where there is no pain.

This movie may not represent Ruffian as gloriously as only the original Ruffian could have done but it keeps this magical horse's memory alive, and that's what matters. Rest in peace, Ruffian, dear girl. You are not forgotten!",1187481600,3,1630,4.6366782006920415

As long as owners continue to race horses as 2 year olds we will continue to see these 'breakdowns'. Horses are not ready to run that young.  I suppose this movie is just another way to make money, exploiting Ruffian yet again.",1185926400,4,397,4.563380281690141
2794013,3,B000OCY7KI,"If I said this movie was even adequate, I'd be lying. If I also suggested any film could ever be adequate as tribute to what Ruffian deserves, I'd be fibbing, so keep in mind I'm not the most impartial reviewer here.

Despite the inevitably tragic ending we all knew would come, I looked forward to this Ruffian bio-pic for many months, was glad the story of this great athlete was going to be told in tribute to her, and even urged people I know to watch it. Ultimately after seeing the film Ruffian back in June I felt let down and regretted sticking my neck out to be its cheerleader. Perhaps on the big screen, with a larger budget, flaws in this film would have been corrected, the races would have seemed more glorious and been given central billing in the plot, and the visuals would have done justice to the real footage we have of Ruffian leaving competitors behind in her dust.

As it was, while I have to admit filmmakers did their best and no doubt struggled within limitations of time and finances, I felt I was seeing a human interest story in which Ruffian was a background player. How long was the cumulative onscreen run-time of all her races? Two or three minutes out of two hours? Plus there were just too many inaccuracies to look away and let them go unnoticed. I won't point them out here because I don't want to dampen anyone else's viewing experience and know there are others who do like this film about thoroughbred racing's fastest filly (maybe fastest horse ever) but bear in mind both Ruffian's real life trainer Frank Whiteley, and her jockey Jacinto Vasquez, sued to stop this production. Both are on record as criticizing their portrayals and the facts as offered in the ABC movie, and that should tell you something right there.

I also must get it off my chest that the various geldings (and it was annoyingly obvious in a few scenes that these were male horses playing a female) who portrayed Ruffian failed to embody her. Yes, their coloration was right, as were the stars on their foreheads, but not one of the equine actors was anything like Ruffian's seventeen hands, and none came remotely close to displaying her build, which has frequently been cited for thirty years as proportionately perfect, the ideal for thoroughbreds, the standard for which breeders should aim. Ruffian had inner fire and spirited energy, and those horses were calm and dull. Was what we saw onscreen honestly the best casting could have done?

As I said earlier, I know the cast, crew, and everyone else who had a hand in putting this version of Ruffian's story on the screen did their best, but sometimes a person's best isn't good enough, particularly when this many lazy flaws were allowed to slip in uncorrected. This should have been entitled ""The Story of the People Around Ruffian"" because that's sure how it felt. Maybe someday we'll see a film that truly tells of Ruffian's brilliance.",1185235200,27,2911,4.668615984405458

I watched the match race... it was horrendous. Why make us relive it?  The last 30 minutes of the movie was just as horrible as it was watching it real time.

The best part of the movie was the ending credits where it actually showed Ruffian. (I only saw the movie when it aired on tv.) Maybe the additional clips on the DVD are worth it; not sure. I recommend instead purchasing the book ""Ruffian"" by Edward Claflin.",1182902400,8,550,4.425742574257426
2794078,3,B000OCY7KI,"This review is for the TV movie, which I viewed.  I haven't seen the DVD extras, so I can't rate them.  This movie was probably as accurate to the facts as one could expect for a TV movie.  It has the usual dramatic device of a protagonist (Nack) who is around for nearly every scene, even though in reality he wasn't.  I agree with one of the other reviewers that it's a little disappointing to see horses that look much older and heavier (probably quarter horses) portraying the tall, slender Ruffian, but I suppose it can't be helped, given the limitations of the filming process and budget.  Overall, this is worth seeing if you're a fan of Ruffian or horse racing in general.  The TV broadcast did include some very short clips of some of Ruffian's actual races.  I hope the DVD includes more of that.

As an aside, there are several mistakes in the description of the movie's story on the Amazon product description page.  Ruffian isn't the only horse buried at Belmont (she was the first), she was injured well before the mile marker, the date was July 6th, and she didn't fall hard on the racetrack.  Also, the second time Foolish Pleasure is mentioned, his name is listed as Foolish Pride.  Pretty sloppy on the part of whomever wrote that story description.",1182124800,4,1267,4.586666666666667
2794079,5,B000OCY7KI,"When I heard they were making a film about Ruffian, my first reaction was that I didn't want to see it and relive the emotions I felt back in 1975 while watching the match race on TV.

But by the time the movie debuted on ABC, I decided to watch it and I'm glad I did. Seeing the movie helped put it back in perspective and made me remember the glory of Ruffian and not just the tragic ending.

If you are too young to remember 1975 or weren't born yet, please watch the movie to see the cultural significance of the ""He vs. She"" match race. It was an indelible part of the 1970s decade, coming on the heels of the 1973 Billie Jean King vs. Bobby Fisher tennis match, and the rise of Women's Lib.

There are a lot of other things about that tumultuous decade that we'd like to forget (such as polyester!), but in horse racing, it was the best decade of all. Three smashing Triple Crown winners in Secretariat, Seattle Slew, and Affirmed; the rise of jockey Steve Cauthen as a household name; women jockeys breaking down the doors of the men-only club; plus Ruffian and other horse racing greats such as Spectacular Bid, Forego, and Alydar.

There are always inaccuracies that plague horse racing movies, and the Ruffian movie is no exception. Workout scenes show Ruffian alone with no other horses on the racetrack. I worked as an exercise rider for 20 years at Thoroughbred racetracks, and believe me, horses don't train alone. There are hundreds of horses on the track galloping and breezing during training hours, which really changes the dynamic of the scene.

The horse they used as Ruffian on the racetrack was a fairly decent representation of the real Ruffian, but the horse they used for the barn scenes looked like a Quarter horse, and just stood there like a nag. I'm sure it was for practical reasons, they needed a quiet horse to put up with all the filming, but I wish the barn-scene horse was more true to Ruffian's looks and personality. Ruffian was an extremely high spirited horse, she kicked up a fuss on a regular basis, and part of her allure and fame was due to her high voltage personality.

Even though in reality Bill Nack's character wasn't there for Ruffian's every move, I don't have an objection to him constantly being in and around the Whiteley barn as Bill Nack helped explain and drive the story. If the story was told from Frank Whiteley's perspective alone, it would have been a near-silent movie as he was cranky and didn't say much in real life.

In the 30+ years since Ruffian died, she has stood the test of time as an all-time great. Sports Illustrated included Ruffian as the only non-human on their list of the top 100 female athletes of the 20th century. The Blood Horse Magazine ranks her #35 in their top 100 racehorses of the century.

Real footage of Ruffian racing is shown at the end of the movie, it's a great addition as she truly was a dynamo. The inaccuracies I stated above don't detract that much from the real story, so I am giving it my top rating.",1181865600,96,3005,4.490842490842491
2794080,5,B000OCY7KI,"My late father worked in horse-racing in NY for 35 years,
and I grew up listening to horse stories. No horse ever
captivated my heart and mind in quite the way that Ruffian did.
She was the real life Black Beauty for millions of little girls,
and the day she died, I walked away from horse-racing forever.
I was seventeen years old.

While the film may not be 100% historically accurate,
it was accurate enough to break my heart all over again
and send me hunting through my drawers to find my old Match Race
pins so I could hold Ruffian one more time while I cried for her.

It was accurate enough to make my best friend scream and grab her own
bad leg (previously broken several times)when Ruffian's leg snapped.
I think Ruffian's story still has the power and the magic to make little
girls everywhere believe that anything is possible, and that they can
truly be Champions like the Magnificent, Tragic Ruffian.
I will be going back to Belmont to visit Ruffian's final resting place
one more time.

Sam Shepard and the rest of the Ruffian ""crew"" did an excellent job
of portraying both the love and the limitations inherent within
the close-knit support system of the beloved Heroine Filly.",1181606400,3,1193,4.591549295774648
2794081,4,B000OCY7KI,"I think the movie was humble, in that it did not credit Ruffian, rather, let the facts speak instead; it did mention at the end, where it listed who went on to do what, that it was the last match race in professional horseracing.  However, Ruffian's legacy may be much more:  For example, the Wikipedia (where they edit each other's writing mercilessly) article about her recalled that,
'Her breakdown and tragic death led to a public outcry for more humane treatment of racehorses. One result was that medications, such as Lasix for bleeding and corticosteroids for inflammation and pain management, came into common use in racehorses.'
The article goes on with the rather astute observations that,
'While helping the horses in the short term, the increased use of medications at the track had a downside, as many horses were raced while injured. It can be argued that thoroughbreds are becoming more delicate as a result; racehorses today run only half as many starts before retirement as did their counterparts 50 years ago. Some of this effect is likely also due to breeding practices that select for horses likely to have short, brilliant careers--like Ruffian's--instead of the traditional racing career which might have lasted several years. Indeed, Ruffian's bloodline may be considered at least partly to blame for her broken leg; her sire, Reviewer, suffered three breakdowns.'
The movie shows Ruffian's burial at Belmont, also mentioned in Wikipedia, but neither point out that she has been the only horse honored with burial there.  ESPN's coverage of the 2007 Belmont Stakes seemed complete, but failed to show Ruffian's grave at the pole or make the connection, upon the occasion of Rags to Riches being the first filly to win in over a hundred years, that their host, ABC, would air the movie Ruffian later that evening, about a filly who was leading to have won at the same Belmont Park, had a foreleg not broken, or anything about her.  Certainly the movie, much less ABC, has no responsibility for ESPN or Wikipedia content, so I plead guilty to being a Monday-morning quarterback (I am interested in contributing to Wikipedia, but feel that I would have to return to college in order to wade through all their rules and regulations, etc.).
Yes, I specified 'foreleg,' as both the movie and the article mention her other leg breaking, but which leg is her 'other leg?'  The article refers to Ruffian 'thrashing about wildy' coming out of anesthesia, so as to break the cast and her 'other leg' (front, presumably), but the movie only illustrated a running motion with her front legs, breaking the 'other.'  Also not shown in the movie is the description in the article of how far/long she ran on after her leg broke, 50 yards, or as one account put it, to the effect that, the ambulance was there by the time she quit running.  Perhaps the post-surgery running effort shown was chosen to illustrate this part of her  reaction, the story of which may have gotten better over time.  Without meaning to criticize the movie or the article based merely upon my own incomplete research, I point out these elements and the others as worth a look, because the running lame and fighting surgery, for example, touched the hearts of the country, I am sure, and are, therefore, important parts of her history/story.
The movie does show Ruffian's grave marker with epitaph paragraph, but in a flash like credits; to read it, I will have to buy this DVD and put it on pause, or else drive up to Belmont Park, in which case I could find out, too, if she is buried at the finish pole or the flagpole, or, maybe they are one in the same.

It narrates the story of what is almost certainly the greatest filly, and arguably one of the greatest racehorses of all time.

Even though I knew how the match race ended, it was very hard to go through the last half hour of the movie.  The director has depicted the end very well.  The scene of the vet administering the shot to put down the filly is shown as a reflection in the filly's eyes, and after the shot is administered, the eye flutters and slowly droops down, fading to black.  My own eyes filled up with tears as I saw that scene (and again as I am typing about it).

Instead it was flat and the characters had no real development.  The racing scenes were decently done but would have been better without the slow-motion bits chunked in seemingly at random. Sam Shepherd does a good job as trainer Frank Whiteley but the rest of the acting is fairly forgetable.

I was 15 when they had the match race.  When I saw this movie.  I fell in love with her again.  And I probably cried more during the movie then I did when I actually saw the race.
I didn't understand what happened during the race.  And thankfully I have never seen that happen during a race again.  I kind of lost interest in horse racing after that.  Anyway  this is a good movie and a good tribute to what I think is the greatest race horse I've ever seen.  Some of Secretariat's people said she maybe better then he was.  Which is also mentioned in the movie.  She broke some of his records.  She set records in just about all her races.
She was undefeated and never behind in any of races.  And was leading the match race against the Kentucky Derby winner.  Her jockey was the same as the Kentucky Derby winner.  And he chose to ride her because he thought she was a better horse.  Two questions could she have beaten Secretariat.  To be honest.  Probably not if he ran like he did in the Belmont.  But that was the only race he ran like that.  And even then she wouldn't have lost by thirty lengths.  And that was the only race he ever ran like that.  She was actually bigger then he was.  And he was huge.  He had been beaten before and I think she would have.  And would she have beaten Zenyetta.  I don't think it would have even been close.  Zenyetta was a come from behind horse with a strong finishing kick.  Ruffian went for the lead and said catch me if you can.  And no one ever could as they just saw her pulling farther away.  Zenyetta couldn't have let her get too far in front.  And there is no reason to think she would have beatern her when no other horse could.",1517356800,,1831,4.181556195965418
