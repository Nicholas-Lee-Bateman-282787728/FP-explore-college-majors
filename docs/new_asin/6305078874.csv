7882573,4,6305078874,"I got this for my Dad who was actually there for Operation Tumbler Snapper. Of course, the government left a lot out. Like how they did not have protective gear on, and swept the radiation dust off of each other with a broom. But it does show the bomb going off, and some tests. For those who were there and are still alive, they may want to watch this or not. Anyone who thinks this is a ""movie"" you are wrong! Real soldiers were in these tests. Remember who the heroes are here. Most who were there died of lung related illnesses. If you are interested in watching the real testing of atomic bombs , this is it. If you want a movie, go to Redbox.",1349481600,,648,4.150793650793651
7882574,1,6305078874,I Agree with all the lowest rated reviews. Just a typical propaganda film. A Real Letdown! 47 minutes of sanitization.,1343347200,,118,4.95
7882575,3,6305078874,"I expected more of this. It was more like a 50s documentary than a PBS / Discovery of the 90s, which is what I expected.",1026777600,7,120,3.84
7882576,1,6305078874,"If you are wondering, the worst DVD I've seen is ""The Ultimate Space Experience."" This movie is still pretty bad though. I bought it invisioning a lot of big atomic bomb explosions. How could I be more wrong. One. Only one atomic bomb explosion happened during the entire flick.  This DVD would only be useful for some kind of research paper, or maybe skeet shooting, not that I've ever tried that. Anyway, if you are planning on buying this, think twice, it's no good.
Unlike the Ultimate Space Experience, I give this a one star rating, as opposed to zero. Screw Flanders. End.",989539200,17,579,4.621359223300971
7882577,3,6305078874,"This is not a ""Produced"" documentary for consumers. The film ""Trinity and Beyond"" is recommended for that purpose. These are original military films produced by the armed forces for internal use,  documenting the effects and deployment of nuclear weapons.  They should be  viewed as such, as a historical relic of a terrifying time in our past. The  quality is that of a typical 16mm film, and some show significant wear.  This is to be expected, given their origin. If you have an interest in this  aspect of our cold war history, these authentic films are for you.",936316800,13,566,4.783505154639175
