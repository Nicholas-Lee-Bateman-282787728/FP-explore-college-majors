291631,4,6300249867,"I will never know why Teresa Russell did not become one of the most visible actresses in Hollywood after this movie -- she is wickedly spectacular in this stylish bit of suspense.  And Debra Winger plays the  good guy with just enough ambivalence to give the movie a real tingling  quality.  It features a suspense/murder plot that essentially involves a  serial killer, and is shot in some spectacular locations.

291687,3,6300249867,"Released in early 1987 and directed by Bob Rafelson from Ronald Bass screenplay, Black Widow stars Debra Winger as a federal investigator who goes after a gold-digging femme fatale (Theresa Russell) who moves from husband to husband, killing them and collecting the inheritance. Sami Frey plays a French lothario living in Hawaii, a target of the Black Widow and potential love interest of the heroine. Dennis Hopper and Diane Ladd have small parts.

The plot is akin to Columbo in that we know who the murderer is right away and its just a matter of the sleuth cleverly catching him or her. At first, I thought Winger was a newspaper reporter, but by the second half it becomes evident that shes a government agent. They shoulda been clearer on this.

This is one of those movies I can take or leave. I acknowledge its good points and enjoy it when I see it, but theres not enough oomph to make it a must-see. Like Columbo, the plot is decidedly made-for-television, but the location shooting distinguishes it as a theatrical film. Winger makes for a fine heroine and there are little things thrown in that smack of real-life, which I appreciate, like the poker game at the office and the colleagues mild flirtations with the protagonist. Russell has the requisite looks that kill, but whatever body double they used for the naked buttocks scene lacked any curves to get excited over.

Nevertheless, if you appreciate 80s period pieces, film noir and the two stars, Black Widow is worth catching, just don't expect greatness.

The film runs 102 minutes and was shot in Seattle, DC and Hawaii.

Both her and Debra Winger give great performances and the movie has some nice style too it which just frustrates me even more.

She gets the go ahead from her boss to pursue her hunches on the weekends. She does. She gets close to the woman. The plot unfolds.

This movie was a cheap knock off of ""Body Heat"". It was very much TV movie of the week caliber. The problem here is that I clearly remember this movie being advertised back then as it was a hug deal, Debra Winger, seduction, sexy, death, etc. It really isn't. There is zero chemistry built around the femme fatale. There is zero sex/nudity--not that I am calling for it. But if Hollywood ever had a reason this movie and they way that they sold it would be it given the subject. Nothing there. And if the fact it was an all around flop was not bad enough it tried to interject feminism into it. There was the boss that hits on the Winger character. There is the coworker trying to woo the Winger character. There is ""You are not taking me seriously because I'm a woman"" silliness. There is the dialog that goes something like "" . . . which is unbelievable . . . that she is a seductress or a killer because she is a woman""? It is factual knowledge that the underpinning of feminism is lesbianism. And they tried to interject that into this with winks and nods. And if you were going to make someone a femme fatale I would think you would  cast a sexy female actress. Theresa Russell just isn't that. And the men are all trolls. While ""Basic Instinct"" was an equally stupid movie at least it got the sexy alluring part right.",1464134400,,1789,4.3056379821958455

291859,4,6300249867,"If there is a word to describe ""Black Widow"", it's ""subtle"". And yet subtlety is what is lacking from most ""suspense"" thrillers made today which really means taking the ""suspense"" out of suspense films. However, this film relies heavily on almost pure suspense for its main thrust and makes for a very satisfying viewing experience, especially for those who saw it 20 years ago and have not seen it again since. The other plus for this movie is the two outstanding female leads who keep the interest constantly high, not through conventional action sequences, but through a dynamic in which the viewer is quite in the dark regarding what they will do next. It is nice to see a suspense drama that relies on the feminine sensibility, which you rarely see in Hollywood today. You have to go back to the film noir days of Hollywood in the 1940s and 1950s to find movies centering around the ""femme fatale"", such as ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"" or ""The Maltese Falcon"".

The plot is relatively simple. A beautiful young woman, presumably in her early 30's, consciously courts older rich men in order to later dispatch them and inherit their money. Theresa Russell in the best role of her acting career plays the ""Black Widow"" with much understated deviousness coupled with seductive femininity. Somehow Russell makes it work. It is never over-the-top which would have ruined the whole dynamic. She finds that fine line where, in only certain moments, do we see her take on a darker cunning expression to hint of her ulterior motives. The rest of the time she plays the role of the perfect female spouse to whomever she is either courting or married.

The best feature of her portrayal is when she assumes a new identity for each of her potential victims to trap her men in a relationship that, as one of her victims put it, ""seems too good to be true"". She researches her intended victims with the veracity of a graduate student preparing a PhD thesis. Another element that is left up to audience speculation is why, other than for the money, she engages in these seduction-murder episodes. Her motivation is never fully explained which, for some reason, works best for the film, leaving the audience to ponder her inner psychology. I feel the only shortcoming of the film is that sometimes the seduction sequences seemed a little rushed where they maybe needed one more scene. Russell does such a good job of transforming her character into someone who would be attracted to her intended victims that I wanted to see just a little more of it. Dennis Hopper and Nicol Williamson each play victims of the ""Black Widow"" and I would have liked to see their segments extended just a bit longer.

Debra Winger plays a federal data clerk at the Justice Department who, during the course of her inputting myriads of computer information, presumably of a criminal nature, starts to notice an unnerving trend of rich men dying shortly after having married younger women. She begins to ponder whether these men were seduced by the same woman. She asks her boss to allow her to investigate further into the matter and overnight she becomes a field agent. The unstated rhetoric is that a male investigator might be unable to go inside the head of the ""black widow"" in order to stop her. At one point, Winger says ""If you want to catch her, if you have to think like she does."" But even Winger admits that no one knows why anyone does anything. She might be able to understand the black widow's schemes but not her motivations. Winger is a perfect compliment to Russell as she projects less sexual allure and more the work-a-day woman. Now the black widow is being pursued.

Overall, a great suspense movie of the ""femme fatale"" variety that is currently an under-explored area of film storytelling. Since about 1990, we have been in the age of the male dominated screen persona which makes a lot of Hollywood's offerings too cookie-cutter. Filmmakers could learn from ""Black Widow"". The female point of view is equally worth exploring as its male counterpart. For some reason, female centered stories are often characterized as not being universal. Which seems strange when you consider that 55% of the world's population is female.",1432684800,,4220,4.792582417582418

292069,4,6300249867,"Thrillers tend to be more driven by plot than character. Not the case here. As good as the plot for ""Black Widow"" is, the characters give it greater gravity.

Here's the scoop. Theresa Russell plays a gorgeous, sexy woman, who befriends rich men, marries them, then kills them in ways to not arouse suspicion. As she does so in widely separated areas of the U.S. she doesn't arouse suspicion. Almost. Enter dowdy Debra Winger from the Justice Department. She has a hunch these deaths might be related. She talks her boss into letting her switch from inside researcher to field investigator so she can head to Hawaii and ensnare the Black Widow.

The plot here is good enough, but the juxtaposition of the two characters is what gives it its resonance. On one hand you have the sexy black widow. She treats her ensnaring of men as a job. She studies the guys she wants to marry. She studies the things they like to show compatibility so as to heighten her chance of becoming the lover, then wife. Then there's Debra Winger. All she has is her job. Her hair style is low maintenance. Her clothes are nondescript and fit her like potato sacks. Her boss wants to get into her knickers but she's more like one of he guys. She's intrigued by Russell and, at some level, admires her....sexuality(?). She gets a taste of that life. And, though she keeps her eye on the ball, she's not the same gal at the end as she was in the beginning.

Bob Rafelson helmed this outing. It's directed well, shot and cut well. The music is good and it has that slick, Hollywood sheen all over it. I like how I was sucker punched in the end. They led me down the path and I followed. I liked it and thought it was clever. If thrillers are your poison, this will satisfy you.",1363824000,3,1749,4.425465838509317

Bob Rafelson, who directed FIVE EASY PIECES (one of my all-time fave films), had a real change of pace with this Hitchcockian story. A mousy federal investigator (Debra Winger) gets on the trail of a glamorous, stunningly beautiful serial killer of rich men (Theresa Russell), and soon the two very different women are pitted against each other in a fight to the...death? A whole lot of swanky houses in several photogenic locations--including the Pacific Northwest and Hawaii--give us a lot to look at, and Rafelson gets stylized, old-fashioned ""movie star"" performances from his two wonderful leading ladies. It's a real pleasure to watch Winger and Russell go at it with such obvious enjoyment, and the cast of male victims is really impressive, too (Dennis Hopper, Nicol Williamson, Sami Frey, etc.). The Fox DVD is crisp and vivid, with excellent Surround sound. There are no extras, which would have been nice. Still, this is a welcome addition to my library.

292073,4,6300249867,"I had to borrow a line from the movie to put in the above title. In full, it went like this: ""A complex series of seductions and murders, that's not something you see a woman do,"" says the boss of Alex Barnes. How wrong was he? Not only was he wrong, but quite sexist. Women have been seducing and murdering men for centuries, and by the late 1980s I'm sure it would have been realized that a woman was more than capable of doing that sort of crime.

I won't rehash the plot. That has been done elsewhere. What I will say is I loved the storyline and the script. Having two female protagonists duel with one another was a fantastic twist that one rarely saw in the 1980s, to say nothing of today. But 25 years later, this movie still enthralls me. I remember seeing it as a little boy when it was in theatres, and let me tell you it mesmerised me. I also loved the locations--like the now defunct parking lot (Site Of The Reagan Building Today) that was prominently used in the movie Manhunter the previous year.

Despite being 25 years old, Black Widow holds up very well. This movie could be remade today and not lose a beat. There are a few plot holes I'll bring up. Was Barnes' scuba tank sabotaged by Catherine? This was never explained after her near fatal drowning. What was Catherine's real name? Who was she? Where did she originate from? Why did she allow Barnes to stick around when she began to suspect her being a federal agent? Why didn't she stop her killings after William McCrory in Seattle? She had more than enough money, and there was no indication in the movie that she was a sociopath so much as her killings were for greed. Indeed, she even cries herself to sleep after the first of her husbands (On Screen) dies, which shows some guilt on her part. How many others had she killed before the events of the movie take place? Could there have been other killings or was her first murder the one shown to us at the beginning of the movie? It would have helped and added more detail had some or all of these questions been answered for the viewers.

Leonard Maltin said there was no payoff at the end of the film. Well, to me the payoff was somewhat faulty and contrived. Why would Catherine have admitted to the attempted murder? Also, would she not have attempted to see the ""body"" of her husband before attempting to claim his money? I mean there was plenty of time and one would have expected her to wait until at least after the funeral before going after poor Paul's money. Yet she does not even attempt to see Paul's body. That to me was/is the biggest flaw in this movie's plot. Despite this, I'm giving it Four Stars.

I only wish they would make more movies like this for women.

292074,4,6300249867,"This film has not made it to Blu ray as of this writing, but I was anxious to see it again.  My only copy is on the nearly extinct laserdisc so I decided to rent the DVD.  This isn't the only movie or character with the black widow in the title.  There is one from 1954 that has nothing to do with this iteration.  There's even the most recent Black Widow character in the new ""Avengers"" film.  That character, played by Scarlet Johansson does have something in common with this film's invented name.  Here she is played by Theresa Russell.  What do they have in common?  They are both beautiful and are very good actors.

In 1987 Debra Winger was the superstar however and plays a geeky FBI agent who works in a building with green windows.  Alexandra (Winger) stumbles upon a series of mysterious deaths involving wealthy men dying in their sleep.  With help from a flirtatious co-worker and an ancient IBM computer she draws a bead on the widow played by Russell.  She uses numerous names but for now we'll use her last alias, Catharine.  Alex gets the OK from her boss (Terry O'Quinn) to do some field work.  This leads her to Hawaii where Catharine has taken up with her next victim, Paul (miscast Sami Frey) a hotel baron in the state.

Alex and Catharine meet and become friendly although Alex is ultimately trying to save Paul who she has quickly fallen for.  If you're seeing this for the first time you might think Alex and Catharine might be right for each other.  I would have liked for the plot to follow that interesting twist, but another turns the film in the direction of the more traditional.  Director Bob Rafelson gets some excellent performances from Winger and Russell and a few of his usual tribe (Dennis Hopper, Lois Smith, and Diane Ladd) but almost blows it with Sami Frey who is a real dud as Paul.  I don't know if it is his French accent, his mannerisms or just his acting style but he isn't very convincing and certainly develops no chemistry with either actress.  I will admit this is certainly a sexy guilty pleasure and yet a worthy, if imperfect, member of the genre.",1336262400,,2101,4.507936507936508
292105,5,6300249867,"This is one of those brilliant films which does not get as much recognition as it should. The performances of Winger and Russell are captivating, as well as those of the relatively minor characters. The setting and the dialogue also add to a flawless piece of work.

Synopsis: Winger, an ambitious federal agent, doing paperwork on a Mafia boss' death, and sick of her desk job, becomes intrigued with Ondine's Curse, a painless, nonviolent, death that occurs when sleeping. She then stumbles on a couple of similar cases where the now-wealthy widow suddenly disappears afterwards. She follows up several leads. One of them goes to Seattle, where she meets a potential victim, a good, shy, and kind wealthy newly married anthropologist. He dies soon thereafter and Winger blames herself for his death. She then follows the black widow to Hawaii to her next victim. The rest I leave up to the viewer in order not to spoil the movie further.

Both women are portrayed as being very intelligent and driven. Winger is at first obsessed with leaving her desk job and later in catching the black widow. Russell is a master (mistress?) manipulator (who could have been a chess champion), but who nonetheless is ""cracked."" She repeatedly states that she truly, honestly, loved all her previous husbands and her facial expressions accent her declarations.

Many of the other reviewers tell almost the whole story, stopping short only just in time to avoid giving away the ending, but few of them mention the extraordinary sexual tension between Winger and Russell, each beautiful in her own way.  Apparently not quite clear to several of the reviewers here is the fact that Winger's character is quite sure almost from the time she stumbles across accounts of several suspicious deaths that Russell's character is the killer.  It's not about finding it out at all -- it's about proving it.  When the two finally meet they are drawn to one another in spite of the suspicions each has about the other. Their supposed friendship is a device that each tries to work to her advantage, but the erotic pull between them as they play cat and mouse is real and can only be called delicious.  The minor roles are well played, especially by Nicol Williamson and the mannered, strange Dennis Hopper and Lois Smith.  If there is a weak link here, it is Samy Frey, who speaks his lines as if he learned them phonetically and wishes he were back in Paris.  Beautiful as the Hawaiian scenery is, the brief time spent near Seattle is just as beautiful. ""Black Widow"" is a movie that can be enjoyed many times.",1313884800,,1297,4.588744588744588

292112,2,6300249867,"Black Widow (Bob Rafelson, 1987)

I seem to be one of the few people who never quite got the obsession film viewers had with Ken and Theresa Russell. I'd heard Black Widow, in which Theresa plays the title character, bandied about for years as the height of sexy thriller-dom, so I finally got around to checking it out. While it's not a completely awful movie, it's not all that great, either.

Russell plays Catherine Petersen, a very rich lady who got that way when her previous husbands died under very mysterious circumstances. On the opposite side of the fence is Alexandra Barnes (Debra Winger), a Federal agent who, as the beginning of the movie progresses (and as we see the mysterious circumstances under which her latest late husband, played by Dennis Hopper, meets his end), becomes obsessed with tracking Petersen down and bringing her to task. Her boss (Terry O'Quinn) is worried that her obsession is clouding her judgment, so he orders her to take a vacation. She chooses Hawaii, which just happens to be where Petersen is wooing her potential next victim. Things get more comlicated when Alex falls for him as well.

And really, do we need more complexity than that? Whether we do or not, Ronald Bass' script gives it to us in spades. (Wait'll you see the climax, which is just beyond silly.) But despite all that, it's quite a pretty thing, as you'd have to expect from any film that's half-set in Hawaii (to be fair, it's probably more beautiful because Alex's office is so dingy), and both Winger and Russell overact this thing halfway to heaven. Oh, so stupid, but it's the kind of empty-calorie movie that once you've started, you just can't stop. **",1243814400,9,1672,4.738831615120275

292148,4,6300249867,"This sly, underrated 1987 crime thriller from Bob Rafaelson is carried by the excellent work of its two protagonists, played by Theresa Russell and Debra Winger.  While its premise hardly breaks new ground in either the broader genre or its subset (films in which the identity of the killer is known from the beginning), the sexual innuendo that emerges between the hunter and the hunted feels fresh because of the charisma of the two stars.

The film opens as Catherine Peterson (Theresa Russell), is heading back to New York City from a trip because of the sudden death of her husband of only two months, Sam, a wealthy publishing magnate quite a bit older than she. Catherine is beautifully and stylishly dressed, a real ""Fifth Avenue Blonde"".  Although she hugs a photo of her dead husband to herself as she weeps on their bed when she returns home, the first thing she has done is empty the remains of his brandy bottle into the bathroom sink and wash it out.  The viewer sees just enough to be initially uncertain as to who and what Catherine is, as she seems genuinely overcome with grief.

However, the viewer is not left in doubt for long, because Catherine is next seen as a blowzy redhead in a tight dress with long red nails, speaking with a southern accent, charming Ben, her latest, older husband (Dennis Hopper, in a brief but hilarious cameo) - a wealthy toy manufacturer. Within two months, Ben has mysteriously died of unknown causes (although by now the audience knows that his bride injected a hard to detect poison into his unopened brandy bottle).  However, this time ""Catherine"" runs into trouble in claiming her rights under her husband's will: his sister (Diane Ladd) threatens to contest it, claiming she has investigated the young widow's claims of her family's origin, and found them to be false.  Catherine buys the sister off with a large cash gift from the estate.

It is at this point that Alex Barnes (Debra Winger) comes into the picture. An analyst for the Justice Department, Alex is very good at what she does, searching for patterns that may point to criminal activity, but she does it in a little cubicle, sitting at a computer, in an office with windows that are blacked out with green paint.  Alex is bored and desperately wants a field assignment that will get her out of the office.  Although Alex is pretty, she doesn't date and it is hinted that her lack of a private life and her persona as ""one of the boys"" has raised questions about her.  At the least, we see that she lacks confidence in her femininity and has submerged all her longings into her job.

One day Alex tells her boss that she has tagged a series of deaths of wealthy older men that have been diagnosed as ""Ondine's Curse"" (apparently healthy middle-aged men dying in their sleep for no reason).  But Alex has connected what she thinks is the same woman with two such recent deaths (the film's first two dead spouses), and thinks it's murder, not Ondine's Curse.  Alex begs her boss to let her take the field assignment and see if she can find the woman and prove the cases were murder.  He grudgingly consents, and Alex heads first to Manhattan, where, after a visit to her quarry's first ex-sister-in-law, she obtains a photo of ""Catherine"" (the real name of Russell's character is never revealed).  Alex's next visit is to the greedy sister-in-law whose suspicions about Catherine were silenced by that large gift, although the gift does't stop her from repeating her suspicions to the lady from the Justice Department.

Next Alex tracks ""Catherine"" to Seattle, where the tacky redhead has morphed into ""Margaret"", a sedate, intellectual, quietly dressed, brown-haired woman interested in the Native cultures of the Pacific Northwest.  Of course, what she is really interested in is William McRory (Nicol Williamson) the retiring, shy, middle-aged millionaire who curates a museum devoted to the Coast Salish peoples, and who leads its Board.  Catherine/Margaret, through a million-dollar gift to the museum, gets herself a place on the Board, and in no time at all she has seduced and married McRory, a charming man who also happens to be allergic to penicillin.

At this point, Catherine/Margaret suddenly becomes aware that someone is on her trail.  Alex has managed to get to talk to McRory by posing as a free-lance journalist who wants to do an article on his wife.  When McRory tells Catherine/Margaret this, she makes a quick call to her erstwhile sister-in-law in Manhattan, who says that yes, a young woman from the Justice Department has been asking questions.  Frightened and infuriated, Catherine/Margaret decides it's time to get out of Dodge, and asks her doctor for some penicillin for the tonsillitis she is so susceptible to in Seattle's damp climate.  Soon afterward, the gentle McRory is dead and no one finds the traces of penicillin crushed into his toothpaste - the diagnosis is heart failure brought on by anaphylactic shock, from unknown causes.  Alex's enraged accusations to the local police fall on deaf ears - they refuse to reopen the case.

McRory's death is the final convincing evidence for Alex that Catherine/Margaret is indeed her serial murderer - what is more, Alex liked the scholarly curator and she feels guilty for not warning him of his danger, unlikely though it is that he would have listened to her.  Now, her need to capture the Black Widow is driven as much by a sense of guilt and responsibility as it is by the thrill of the chase and ambition.

Alex then tracks Catherine/Margaret, now calling herself ""Rennie Walker"", to Hawaii, where she already has her fangs in her next victim, an international hotel tycoon, Paul Nuytten (Sami Frey). It is here that Alex and ""Rennie"" finally meet, in a scuba diving class, as the intricate, final phase of the dance between Alex and the Black Widow begins, and the charged, ambivalent relationship between the two women begins to emerge.

It is unclear whether Rennie knows immediately that her new friend ""Jane"" is Alex the investigator.  But they become close friends very quickly.  Rennie lends the unkempt Alex a cocktail dress and sends her to her own hairdresser, and Alex shows up that evening at a party at Paul's palatial estate looking transformed. It becomes clear as she gets to know Rennie, that even in the full knowledge of Rennie's crimes, Alex is wistfully envious of Rennie's sexual confidence, style, and skill with men, and that on some level Alex wishes she were more like Rennie.  In one scene, when it becomes clearer that Rennie suspects that she is talking not to her new ""friend"" but to her hunter, Rennie tries to explain that she loved all her husbands deeply and that the problem is, no amount of money is enough money to make her feel really safe.  Russell handles this ambiguity well: conveying admirably that her character has enough insight to recognize the potent forces driving her but not enough sanity to challenge them.

Rennie next encourages a brief fling between Alex and Paul - she has seen that Alex is attracted to Paul, and that Paul is intrigued by Alex's innocence and reticence, although he has been pressing Rennie to marry him.  Paul obliges Rennie by making love to Alex, while Rennie hires a sleazy private detective (James Hong) with a heroin addiction to photograph Alex and Paul together.  As soon as he gets the photographs, Rennie murders the detective by holding a gun to his head while forcing him to take an overdose.  Then, Rennie finally agrees to marry Paul, who breaks off the affair with Alex.  Remembering what happened to McRory, Alex tells Paul who she is and tries to warn him about Rennie, but Paul refuses to listen, and indignantly points out that with Rennie's agreement, their estates have been left to the Cancer Foundation.

By this time, Alex is aware that Rennie knows who she is, although Alex also knows that Rennie knows there is still no substantive proof of Rennie's actions that would stand up in court.  After her marriage to Paul, Rennie feels reasonably secure, but Alex comes to Rennie and Paul's wedding and gives the bride a brooch in the shape of a Black Widow spider.  Rennie murmurs that she's enjoyed their relationship, and that ""Truth is, I'm sorry it's over.""  Alex replies, ""The truth is, it's not over yet.""  Rennie knows then that she has to get rid of Alex and springs the trap she has prepared: Rennie plants the poison she will use on Paul in the cheap cottage Alex has rented, and goes off on one of her ""trips"" - sure enough, she is called back suddenly when Paul is found dead, another victim of Ondine's Curse.  The police find the body of the detective and the photographs of Paul and Alex embracing, and Rennie insists that the only person who really had reason to murder Paul is the rejected Alex, and the police search Alex's cottage and find the poison.

After utilizing a little-known testamentary clause that allows her to cancel Paul's bequest of his entire estate to the Cancer Foundation, all signs point to the Black Widow having trapped Alex, rather than the other way around.

This is a stylish, well-played story, and this reviewer has watched it several times over the years with the same enjoyment.  It is not so much the actual plot (which has some quite far-fetched moments) as the work of the actors that is so engaging, as they shape their portrayals of two women who are so different yet so oddly in sync with each other.  It is particularly pleasurable watching Russell shift identities as she stalks her victims and adapts to their tastes, interests, and cultural backgrounds.  The supporting players are excellent, with Dennis Hopper very droll as the toy manufacturer and Nicol Williamson sweetly attractive as the chair of the museum Board, William McRory.

Try it some rainy Saturday night - this is a highly entertaining neo-noir effort!",1207180800,3,9878,4.805670407560544

292151,4,6300249867,"Time has shown this 80s thriller to be a more durable, intriguing film than first it may have seemed. Debra Winger is at her most gorgeous, and the chemistry between her character and Theresa Russell's 'black widow' is palpable. I loved the colourful locations and the sense of glowing health of the cast. People who haven't seen it before will notice the 80s-style male chauvinism, but it doesn't detract from the movie.

292152,4,6300249867,"BLACK WIDOW is a sexy and stylish thriller, mainly notable for the always-reliable Debra Winger playing a gutsy female investigator.

When several rich older men all die in sudden, bizarre circumstances, government investigator Alexandra Bates (Debra Winger) becomes convinced a common link will lead to one individual.  Alex's theory later leads her across the path of Theresa (Catherine Russell), a woman with untold fortunes and several husbands.  Determined that she is the 'Black Widow', Alex befriends her in Hawaii, and later becomes part of a sordid love triangle with the next intended victim of Catherine's plot.  BLACK WIDOW is filled with enough chills and thrills to hook any audience.

Debra Winger, in one of the rare times she doesn't play the dying tragedienne, delivers an excellent performance as Alex, a woman trying to exist within the male-dominated world of government intelligence.  She is the only one who truly holds this movie together.  Catherine Russell brings a chilling, glacial quality to the role of Theresa/Rennie, the black widow of the title.

292154,5,6300249867,"You can just about forget everyone else in this film other than Debra Winger and Theresa Russell. This sexy film is basically a two person film noir shot in bright colors, some of it in Hawaii. It is filled with excitement and seduction. Both the leads are wonderful to watch, their chemistry magnificent in this Bob Rafelson (Man Trouble, Five Easy Pieces) film.

Debra Winger is Alex Barnes, bogged down in a government desk job dealing with statistics. But when she sees a pattern of deaths that lead to Theresa Russell, a dangerously beautiful woman with ice in her veins, she becomes obsessed with catching a killer. Theresa Russell, who has used more names than Jason Bourne, is just as smart as she is sexy, and almost the entire film is one long seduction scene as Russell spins her web around Alex.

It seems a lot of rich men have suddenly died on Russell and Alex knows why. She is what is called a Black Widow, a woman who mates and then kills. No one has found any evidence to prove it, however, and Alex's attempt to catch her at it becomes murky as a seduction begins to take place.

The locations and the stars are beautiful and as Winger and Russell circle each other in this game with deadly stakes you can't take your eyes off them. Winger's Alex is smart and determined, but vulnerable, and Russell gives a flawless and sexy performance as a smart and icy beauty with a heart full of venom.

The electricity between the two characters jumps off the screen. The pool scene where they first meet gives us an indication of what is to come as Alex attempts to get close to Russell, with some unexpected twists. The formost of these is a scene when Alex gives Russell a Black Widow pendant, a spider who mates and kills its lover. Russell's response plays with the fragile but determined Alex as she begins to doubt herself.

You don't want to miss this one. It's gorgeous to look at and has two riveting performances from Winger and Russell. You can't find a better one than this.",1119744000,73,1996,4.518005540166205

The movie world needs them. Russell, as an actress, generally lacks Winger's inner-fire, but some of her close-ups are more revealing than her dialogue anyway(watch for the scene on the beach after the scuba diving accident). In 1987, this was considered a modest hit which got generally good reviews(Roger Ebert panned it, however). So it's fair to say the movie is highly underrated and should be seen by anyone who loves a good mystery or a great acting match between two top-flight stars. Supporting performances are also very good, and the direction is tricky & tight right up until the final scene(which seems a little rushed).

292196,4,6300249867,"What ever happened to Debra Winger's career? Was it all the gossip about how difficult she was to work with? Or was she simply a victim of the public's changing tastes? Coming to prominence in 1980's *Urban Cowboy*, followed by the smash hits *An Officer and a Gentleman* and *Terms of Endearment*. Even though she was nominated for Oscars several times, it was downhill from there, but Winger was in peak form for what has been regularly described as ""a stylish thriller."" Paired with Theresa Russell (a most intriguing actress with a score of bad films behind her - think *Whore*), Winger plays a federal agent on the tail of a chameleon-like young woman (Russell) who marries wealthy men and kills them. The plot is gripping and relatively fast-paced and Winger and Russell are excellent counterpoints to each other - Winger is earthy and likable and Russell is sexy and sinister. There is an interesting array of men playing Russell's victims, including Dennis Hopper in a cameo, with a deliciously calculating Diane Ladd playing his sister. The locales and interiors are suitably lush, though the inescapable hallmarks of the 80s regularly remind us that, though the film is almost 20 years old, it was done with enormous style - then and now.",1106438400,16,1248,4.8915094339622645

Debra Winger is perfect as feisty Government agent, Alex, who notices a pattern and sets out to find the Black Widow-Theresa Russell, who reminds me a lot of Kathleen Turner in ""Body Heat"".
I would like to see more of her movies, as her portrayal of the woman Alex hunts down, is complex and compelling.

Black Widow was buried on a shelf of books and other movies for the traveler. So I popped it in at 2 a.m. and was taken into this world, like having fallen into a magic drain pipe. Not many people have heard of Debra Winger's co-star, but Theresa Russell proves, like in The Razor's Edge, with the appearance of the right script, her character will stand on the edge looking down, then she's your woman. Winger had the movie ripped from her mouth in a scene at a Hawaian party. She told Russell she was on to her husband-killing game and presented her with a gift-jewel widow. R's retort: ""She kills, but can she love."" Cornered she grabs Winger and kisses her on the lips- a little improve?..oh yea, definitely. The plot is fairly simple: Russell crawls under the richmans door and into his fortune with her eyes closed, counts the money and executes whistle-clean homicide. Winger then leaves her FBI office to a field chase; she is sexy as hell after breaking her menagerie, you know, her new haircut. Pure escapism. The gambler wants action, not money.

292201,4,6300249867,"Okay, the story is preposterous and technologically dated, and some of the dialogue is melodramatic in a retro kind of way.  That said, BLACK WIDOW still makes good viewing because it remains true to itself and the premises it has set up, and Debra Winger and Theresa Russell do a smashing job on their characters.  It also has an interesting style, managing a noir atmosphere even while filming a considerable portion of the story in the bright sunshine of Hawaii and dressing the leads in the blues and red-oranges of '80s fashions.
Debra Winger plays a bright young unattached woman in a drab, stultifying life as a statistics accountant for the federal government.  She does not openly indulge in self pity, but when she identifies a wisp of a possible crime in the statistics she compiles, she sells all her possessions and quits her job to pursue the case on her own.  The case surrounds Theresa Russell's character who Winger believes marries older men and somehow precipitates their deaths to reap their inheritances, what is called a black widow.  This is all established with swift efficiency, as is the guilt of Russell's character.  The suspense lies in if and how Alex will corner her black widow, who is equally intelligent.  The two make a sensational pairing, circling around each other, getting closer and closer.
Leonard Maltin's movie guide says the film doesn't deliver the big pay-off.  That depends upon what kind of pay-off you are looking for.  I happen to think it did deliver.",1006819200,50,1502,4.881889763779528

She is pursued by a woman from the Justice Department who is equally smart. She, and only she, is able to see that the husbands have been murdered. All the men she speaks to think she is mistaken.
