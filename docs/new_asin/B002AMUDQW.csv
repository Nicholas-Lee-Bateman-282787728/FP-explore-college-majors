8359775,5,B002AMUDQW,"I bought it as soon as I found it listed on Amazon because of all the legendary DJ's listed.
David Morales, Frankie Knuckles, Judge Jules, Goldie.... The list goes on, and on...it's a good paragraph long.
These are not people you often hear being interviewed, but they ARE legends in the electronic music industry. Like Little Louie Vega, Tall Paul, Victor Calderone, D:Fuse, Roger Sanchez, DJ Rap, Dave Ralph, Tedd Patterson, the list goes on.
I was expecting the standard dry commentary about the club scene or the music scene but the director/producer-Taylor Neary who interviewed the people has an exceptional ability to get people to open up about their personal experiences. These people/artists/producers/DJ's were telling her their deepest most personal ,emotions, experiences, inspirations and desires. What made THEM tick, what inspired them or their personal outlook and perspectives. It was really more about getting inside their inspirations, desires, ambitions, and experiencing the scene from their point of view in that era of time all the way up to the present day. If you like ""It Might Get Loud"" or other good music documentaries you will absolutely LOVE this one.
The other thing I like is that the bonus footage shows the newest development in the music industry and how it affects their careers and styles, for example, Carl Cox talks about Ableton Live and how he's incorporating such tools and how downloading has affected how he and others approach things.
It's a great DVD!
If you have a friend who's into this kind of music BUY IT! It's a GREAT gift of music history, culture and an incredible inspiration. Thank you Taylor for putting your heart and soul into this documentary, it really shows. It was worth it! Good job, I'm looking forward to seeing more of her work.",1366416000,,1797,4.993333333333333
