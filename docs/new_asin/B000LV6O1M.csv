2714595,5,B000LV6O1M,"This DVD is full of great shows. Great variety. My 2 1/2 yr old can't decide which one to watch - she loves them all.

2714601,4,B000LV6O1M,"I love the variety this DVD has.  My 3 year old daughter loves the fact that she can choose what show she wants to watch.  Of course we can't sit through an entire DVD but we get through a few shows at a time. And she gets to watch a couple shows she doesn't normally watch.  We bought this when we were going on a camping vacation so it was great to have it along in the car, camper, etc. with a portable DVD player.  I didn't have to pack lots of movies - this one had alot of variety so it worked out great.  A few of her favorites are on it and a few new shows so it's an enjoyable DVD for us.",1184198400,19,597,3.744
