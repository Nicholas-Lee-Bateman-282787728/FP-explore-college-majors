Yes, Napoleon and Ilya weren't together as much as we would have liked, but when they were it was magic.  The scene when Napoleon's pen starts beeping is priceless . . . watch the look on Robert Vaughns face.  I think this movie was better than ANY 3rd season episode.  If you liked UNCLE, you'll enjoy this movie.  No rocket science here, just good old 60's style entertainment.  No computer gimmicktry, no CGI, and no 3 frame cuts that leave you with a headache after a car chase or fight scene.  Get some popcorn, ENJOY!",1102982400,2,599,4.372727272727273
2163042,3,B00062J076,"I have always been a big fan of the Man from UNCLE, and I own the VHS version of this recording.  I was excited to see that it was released on DVD, and preordered it when I saw it was about to be released. I just watched the first 20 minutes, and was really disappointed.  The video quality is very poor.  It appears to be a recording from an old VCR, as the picture shakes back and forth enough to be really annoying.  When Janice Friday is introduced, we are all introduced to the new ""enhanced sound,"" whatever that means.  Problem is, there is no sound at all for about five seconds.  I may never watch the rest of the DVD, as the tape is actually superior in quality.

The video is not clean, and the sound is certainly less than advertised.  I believe they made this in someone's garage.  The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because it is ""The Man from UNCLE.""  My advice to all of my fellow fans is to try and find a VHS version and make your own DVD.",1102550400,60,959,4.080213903743315
2163043,4,B00062J076,"A long-awaited sequel to one of the most popular shows of the mid 1960's.  Robert Vaugh and David McCallum reprise their signature roles as UNCLE agents Napoleon Solo and Illya Kuryakin.  In this ""affair"", the guys have come out of retirement to stop THRUSH from setting off a bomb that's hidden under a nuclear reactor and capture an escaped madman (Anthony Zerbe.)  Patrick Macnee co-stars as Sir John Raleigh (the new head of UNCLE) and there's a cameo appearance by George Lazenby as well.  The acting is good, the storyline is decent (but IMO the plot could have been a bit more complex)and there should have been more scenes in which Solo and Kuryakin appared together.  However, it's still a good film.",1097539200,14,709,4.778688524590164
8037541,2,B00062J076,"Sometimes it's just nice to have a copy of a favorite film or TV movie you remember fondly. I set my alarm for 3 a.m. years ago to put in a last-minute eBay bid for ""The Sound of Music"" that was being sold by a guy in Hong Kong. I won. The resultant DVD was obviously duped from a bad TV format 16mm print. The color and sound changed from reel to reel. I mention all this to emphasize the totally crappy quality of this DVD. As others have mentioned, it looks like it was dubbed from a bad VHS copy, which, I suspect, was probably made from somebody's homemade recording when this otherwise fun and enjoyable romp was first aired. As for the packaging, I've seen better efforts by high school kids at producing something ""professional"" in PhotoShop. Bad scans, mottled background, and cheesy layout do not make the box an added asset to my DVD shelves. It's sad that either the collection of UNCLE movies available in the U.K. or the excellent 40-something-disc DVD ""Man From UNCLE"" set (available only from Time-Life until this fall) doesn't include ""Return of..."" as an ""extra."" Until it comes out ""officially,"" staunch fans are stuck with this shoddy piece of clabber, much as I suffered through that lousy Asian bootleg of ""The Sound of Music"" until it was officially released.
UPDATE: A legit version was released in March 2009. Channel D is open once again, in a much better, professional release. Anyone wanna buy a bootleg?",1213574400,,1432,4.641732283464567
8037542,1,B00062J076,I too am looking for The Man from UNCLE tv series on DVD. I agree that the studio is missing the chance at making money by not offering this series. Hopefully Mr. Vaughn or Mr. McCullum are not the people responsible for blocking the sale of this great show.,1143244800,2,258,4.285714285714286
8037543,1,B00062J076,"I never saw this movie.  But if Warner Home Video (which apparently now owns the rights to the series) wants to make a pant-load of money off The Man From U.N.C.L.E., they'd better get on this stick.  Nobody under 40 remembers this show at all, since it never went into long-term syndication.  The first Baby-Boomers, who are the real fans of this show, and remember it nostalgically, are ready for the dvds before we get too old to see!  Just make sure it's a quality release, not the miserable quality this dvd lays claim to.",1138665600,5,527,4.515789473684211
8037544,5,B00062J076,"Release the whole series of ""Man From U.N.C.L.E."" on DVD! ""The Flying Nun"" is being released next month, for goodness sake!

You can't tell me the prospective market for ""The Flying Nun"" is greater than that for ""U.N.C.L.E.""",1138665600,7,224,4.894736842105263
8037545,2,B00062J076,"The series was great, the Return is okay, but the DVD is terrible. If they're going to re-release this series (and they should) then the DVD should be of better quality. What did they do with this one, record it off a TV screen? It's awful.  Whoever thought fans of the series wouldn't notice is way off base. I'd really like to see the entire series come to DVD, but not like this. Get a clue, and do it right!",1111795200,25,411,4.1375
8037546,1,B00062J076,"I bought this DVD because I liked the movie and I can't find it on videotape. Unfortunately, the sound disappeared twice, the extras were a joke and the trailers were disgusting. I won't buy it on DVD until some other company puts out a better copy of it.",1110499200,18,255,4.333333333333333
8037547,1,B00062J076,"The video was poor & the audio dropped out in 2 scenes.

The DVD includes some ""Trailers"" for other programs which are, at best, soft porn. I don't want this product in my house.

I have returned the DVD for a refund.",1109894400,12,217,4.142857142857143
8037548,3,B00062J076,"For years, U.N.C.L.E. fans have been anxiously awaiting the release on DVD of the U.N.C.L.E.TV series...after all, if it can be released on DVD in Britain, surely the US can get it, right?  Wrong!  What we do get is this poorly manufactured, pathetic excuse of an issue of what could have been a fun movie although it does pale in comparison to the original series.

I was pleased to see in another review that the sound blanks out for 5 seconds at one point - at least I know it wasn't my copy.  And if you haven't gotten this yet - be prepared - the sound will go out again later in the movie as well.

From a technical standpoint, it seems a first-year college film student could have done a better job.

Technical goof-ups aside, what we have here just merely whets the appetite for all the U.N.C.L.E. fans who are waiting for the original TV series and it's better than nothing.  Here's hoping that when the powers that be do get around to issuing the original TV series on DVD (make it soon Lord, make it soon - those of us who were in our late teens/early 20's when the original series aired aren't getting any younger!), they'll also re-release this movie.  U.N.C.L.E. fans deserve better.",1107734400,28,1197,4.458715596330276
8037549,1,B00062J076,"I watched this made for television film which aired roughly fifteen years after the original show went off the air. In this poor hack of a reunion movie, the two agents are asked back by a new UNCLE chief (who would ever guess uncle would still be alive after 15 years after the spy craze?) to recover an escaped THRUSH criminal (who the agents never met in their old days); why would they need two retired agents who never knew the criminal they are after????????????????????????????????

Why take two tired older men, one fairly out of shape, reunited them only to send them in opposite directions???????????

What a hoot!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This is clearly a remake to end any and all remakes. I can understand teeny boppers who still lust after aging RV and DMC still think they make their juices flow, but this is ludicrous.

The appearance of a former 007 actor (a one-film man) in the flick makes this a mediocre rag of a film ever the more! No way!!!",1104278400,5,973,4.739644970414201
8037550,3,B00062J076,"Being a huge U.N.C.L.E. fan I eagerly awaited this release. The storyline was as I remembered, but I was looking forward to a DVD quality release with extras. The quality was worse than VHS recorded off of broadcast TV and the extras consisted of the cast. The cover had a misprint 350,000,00.00(sic). In all the quality of the print is less than I would have expected from an Ebay purchase. If the regular season shows are ever put on DVD I hope that a professional does the transfer.",1103068800,11,485,4.5227272727272725
