8355557,2,B00282GZIY,This is a tipical lesbian boring movie the kind you can rent anywhere. I can assure you there is absolutely nothing special in this movie that you did not see in any other lesbian movie. If you find something exciting in this movie it's because your at your fist xxx movie.,1262736000,,273,4.372549019607843
8355558,1,B00282GZIY,"I bought this out of curiosity.  What I got was a surprise home video sex tape.  It is sooo bad in so many different ways I don't know where to begin.  And to add insult to injury, the sex sucked.  Lesbians or not if you want porn this ain't it.  If you want a film, like one that you can actually watch, this ain't it.  But if you are a film student and want to see how bad, bad film making can get, then use this as a guide for what not to do.",1261094400,2,445,3.6808510638297873
8355559,2,B00282GZIY,"'Glacial' is probably generous, as at least they move in a constant direction unimpeded by bad--and torturously unnecessary--editing.

There are, admittedly, several minutes of mildly interesting lesbian sexual activity. But, Oh, dear gawd, the slogging price one must pay to get there AIN'T worth the admission.
Just buy a porn video--they're at least honest about their reason for existing.
Horrible stark direct lighting.
Acting? We'd have to move up at least three levels simply to get to 'acting'.
The constant cutting to the 'spooky' inserts of one face defies logic, and is unsupportable by anyone's attention span.

This is the first 'movie' I've ever seen when fast forwarded to 2x doesn't even seem to go faster.

It's not the money--I'd pay ANOTHER $9.99 if I could go back and erase the non-sex part of this film out of my memory.

I gave it 2 stars only because there are a few minutes when 3 women are naked and in focus--what MUST be the cinematic height these 'film makers' will ever rise to.

Oh--the long moments of dark between scenes are the film makers being 'arty'. Do not attempt to adjust your dvd...",1258761600,3,1124,4.833333333333333
8355560,2,B00282GZIY,"Erotic if you like somewhat overweight girls being screwed by a post-op transgendered wearing a strap on.  This is a good piece of film work and visual ideas are interesting compared to many items in this genre, but I feel it would only be shocking or new to someone who had only seen R rated films before. As usual acting skills are completely absent, but at least it is a very good quality strap-on (wonder where you could buy one like it...?)",1251676800,11,445,4.426829268292683
8355561,5,B00282GZIY,"First, the erotic scenes: These are like nothing else in any movie you have ever seen. ""The Shattered"" runs the gamut of every type of lesbian scene in ways that you have never seen, no matter how much erotica or porn you have watched. The scenes are much more than enough to justify the price, IMHO.

The plot: A lot better than ""Pirates"", this one will appeal strongly to fans of dreamlike hentai and magical realism. It's not ""Casablanca"", but it's engaging enough to make it a worthwhile experience.",1241654400,15,503,4.651685393258427
