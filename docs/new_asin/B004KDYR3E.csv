8432898,4,B004KDYR3E,I enjoyed this disc too. It presents the Antarctic in all its fragile glory with excellent photography and an interesting subtitled dialogue. Not as scientific as the Frozen Planet but it looks at the problems there very much from an on the spot perspective. Good value.,1341964800,2,270,4.891304347826087
8432899,2,B004KDYR3E,I have seen better Blu Ray on this subject matter. It does not live up to the Planet Earth standards by no means.,1341619200,,113,3.9565217391304346
