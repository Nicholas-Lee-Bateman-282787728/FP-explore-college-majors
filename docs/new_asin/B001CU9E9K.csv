8289546,4,B001CU9E9K,"Had I not read the book (there are two) I would not have enjoyed this documentary a much as I had. Still, it is brutal recounting of Americans caught in the dessert deploying stamina and a shrewd intellect against conditions very few could survive.",1490832000,,248,4.659090909090909

8289550,5,B001CU9E9K,"Amazing Amazing Amazing!!This is one incredible true story set in the harsh terrain of the Sahara desert. You can just feel the agony and the heat throughout the entire story. If you want to see and drink in an amazing story that is true, then this one is for you. I recommend this one for lovers of adventure and lovers of History. Excellent for history class and for history buffs.",1390435200,3,383,4.485714285714286
8289551,2,B001CU9E9K,"Let me say up front that both my husband and I read and very much enjoyed Captain Riley's account of his harrowing adventures on which this is based, so one part of this rating is based on our assessment that this is not a good book-to-screen adaptation; while the other is based on the limitations of the commercial-TV form.

AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE PRODUCTION AS BOOK-TO-SCREEN ADAPTATION: We expected some of the detail to be truncated, which it was, significantly. What we didn't expect was that some of what is shown is simply inaccurate and slightly confusing. For example, Riley landed with at least twice as many men as are ever shown in this film, even when we are supposedly looking at the full complement. I suppose that using the smaller number and not being too precise about what happens was a way of cutting production costs. Unfortunately, this means that some of the statements made during the piece about the outcome of the survivors of the shipwreck that began this nightmarish epic don't make sense.

The re-use of the same staging of scenes (from different angles) is probably attributable to cost-saving as well. Clever angles help to conceal the fact that the actors playing Riley and those with him when he reached safety weigh about three to four times as much as Riley describes. Viewers don't expect actors to become actually emaciated for a role, but a couple of times an actor described as being close to death from starvation and dehydration is shown from an angle that gives away the fact that he has a bit of a pot belly, plump legs, and well-developed, healthy-looking arms.

The suspense found in Riley's account is mostly lacking. Instead, we're left with a more-or-less linear, here's-how-we-got-from-here-to-there approach more akin to what would have been found in a 1950s Hollywood movie (but without the production values).

There's more, but that's enough quibbling about the general approach. There are two things about this film that are superior to the book (which is why I give it two stars instead of one): (1) we learn (and see) more about the interrelationships between the desert dwellers; and (2) Riley's description of the Sahara is brought to life by the visual images of the great sweep of this forbidding landscape.

AS TO THE LIMITATIONS OF THE COMMERCIAL-TV FORM: Like many documentaries made for TV with no thought of after-the-fact distribution of the DVD, this film is extremely frustrating to the viewer in that it retains the pacing and scripting of a piece that must accommodate commercials. In practice, what this means is that a brief segment is wrapped up with a suitably cliff-hanging or interesting moment, then the film goes immediately to a usually generic scene with a voiceover saying something like, ""When Captain Riley and his crew were shipwrecked off the coast of Africa, in a dangerous no-man's-land, they endured many hardships that led to their becoming slaves and being forced to throw themselves on the mercy of a humane master to rescue them. They're now into their forty-fourth day of captivity, in the middle of the Sahara Desert, the largest desert on earth, trying to make their way to the place where they hope rescue awaits."" This, or some version of it, is repeated at the end of what would have been every commercial break. I realize that re-editing is an expensive proposition, but we found this repetition very clunky.

TO SUM UP: Riley's narrative is a terrific read, but this is a so-so adaptation. At $29.95, it's certainly not good value.",1327449600,2,3534,4.881666666666667
8289552,4,B001CU9E9K,"This is a very good documentary about a subject not well-known. I throughly enjoyed watching Capt. James Riley and his crew endure all of the hardships they encountered. After watching this by chance on History Channel a year or so ago, I knew one day I had to own it. This is one of the best documentaries I've ever seen.

My only complaint is that there are no subtitle options. This is the 2nd History Channel documentary I've purchased that doesn't have subtitles. Even though I love many of their documentaries, I'll have to be more careful in purchasing a documentary w/o subtitle options in the future.

Still, overall this is a good product. I recommend to everybody that loves history to see this at least once.",1318032000,2,720,4.661417322834645
8289553,5,B001CU9E9K,My family and I thought the video was very interesting as Captain James Riley was my great-great-great grandfather's brother so it had special significance to all of us.,1302307200,,169,5.071428571428571
8289554,5,B001CU9E9K,"I was flipping through channels, when I happened upon this documentary on the History channel. I don't normally watch documentaries, but this one was exceedingly well done. It was almost as though I were watching a story unfold--and what a story it is! I was hooked, and could not stop watching. I immediately went out and bought Captain Riley's book after watching this documentary, and it was equally fascinating! This documentary is a must buy for any history lover, particularly anyone interested in early American or 19th century history, or anyone interested Northern African culture during this period. It is truly an eye-opener!",1293235200,8,636,5.184466019417476
