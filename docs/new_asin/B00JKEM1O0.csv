8651737,4,B00JKEM1O0,"An excellent CBC production using some of the same cinematographers and similar distinctive quality that you would expect to see with BBC nature documentaries like Frozen Planet and Planet Earth. Wild Canada focuses mostly on some of the wildlife of Canada, yet still reveals some beautiful panorama's of the habitats where the animals are found. Just don't expect to see a ton of landscape work here. In fact, iconic regions like the Canadian Rockies are pretty much glossed over at best. Overall, very well done-frankly, I think it screams for more! Wild Canada-II perhaps!

The only negatives: I felt the script Dr. Suzuki had to read from was a little weak or at least the delivery could have been cleaned up at times. Some of the background music was excessive or simply not needed. Personally, I would rather not see humans in a nature documentary, only in the special features category, although I understand what they were trying to achieve with the historical connections.

Amazon could do a better job of listing the Blu-Ray version as you really have to look specifically for it to find it.",1424476800,,1101,4.882352941176471
