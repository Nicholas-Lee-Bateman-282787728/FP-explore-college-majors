8515836,4,B007FQDO9Q,"Tokyo is my second favorite city in the world after London. In a pleasant irony, an English chef went on a tour of Japan. I wasn't really interested in the culinary aspect of the DVD. I just wanted a guide to Tokyo. Nevertheless, I still watched this on YouTube (and will likely purchase this). Even though Tokyo is one of the largest cities in the world, there aren't that many decent DVDs pertaining to Tokyo.

Although this DVD focused more on cooking than traveling (it was roughly 70% cooking, 30% traveling), I still enjoyed it. Merrilees went to various restaurants in Tokyo and Kyoto. She also went to the Tsukiji Fish Market and a farm in rural Japan. She even prepared a meal with a Japanese family. I liked how she incorporated Japanese culture into her exploration of Japanese cuisine.  In addition, Merrilees has a pleasant personality- she's not like one of those other obnoxious Globe Trekker hosts who tries who make themselves the center of attention and crack jokes. Merrilees is the female Rick Steves.",1425081600,,1021,4.795454545454546

8515838,4,B007FQDO9Q,"Japan is said to have more people over the age of 100 than any other country on Earth. The secret: their diet - which is mostly based on seafood. I journeyed to Japan for the first time in October of 2013 and was blown away by all of their food choices, snacks, dishes, etc. This is an excellent introduction video for those preparing to travel to this magical, enchanting culinary paradise!",1388102400,3,391,4.52112676056338
