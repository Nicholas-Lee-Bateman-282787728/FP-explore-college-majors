I liked the episodic approach of the first movie, Too! gets away from that format and is more a continuation of the ""What I believe"" episode from the original (IMO the weakest of the three episodes in Route 30). While I love the actors and the job they do the story is a bit of a let down, and to be honest by the end I was quite tired of hearing ""Top Poppie"" (watch the movie, you'll know what I mean). The movie seemed to me to want to be more goofy than humorous/funny this go round.

I will gladly continue to support John Putch, I love movies like the Route 30 series and look forward to his third installment. Also, I went to college not all that far from the area this was filmed and I enjoy seeing the area being brought back to life on the screen (even if it is just my 60"" plasma screen).

Lastly, one thing I did NOT like is that the blu-ray disk came in a cardboard sleeve instead of plastic case. I know with low budget Indy movies like this costs are everything, but I am a collector and like my movies in the plastic protective cases.",1366588800,2,1181,4.0212765957446805
8539423,5,B009BBD0QK,"The second film in the trilogy is totally different. The first one was like a chamber piece. This one is like a symphony composed by Daffy Duck! For this kind of low-budget film, it's got a lot of actors and special effects, which is nuts! I am particularly interested to see how he winds it up.  The first movie can be found here: [...]",1347753600,,337,4.265625
8539424,5,B009BBD0QK,"John Putch, auteur of this totally wacky, tour de farce, has enjoyed a wonderful career as an actor, director, writer...and now he gives us the sequel to his lunacy calling card, ROUTE 30. His cast totally buys into the concept and the result is one of the weirdest escapades in filmdom. You owe yourself a trip down Route 30, Too!",1347753600,,331,4.533333333333333
8539425,5,B009BBD0QK,"Have watched the DVD, Route 30, Too! four times already and I love it. The acting is strong and the look of the film from director, John Putch and cinematographer Keith Duggan is appealing. The story is clever and funny. Putch has taken the area where he was raised, Chambersburg, PA (on Route 30, The Old Lincoln Highway) and created characters, some are composites of friends he grew up with and introduced them to a, how do you say, ""Out of the World"" character. I'm giving this film as stocking stuffer this year for sure.....",1347753600,,530,4.589473684210526
