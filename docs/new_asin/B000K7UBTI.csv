2683426,1,B000K7UBTI,"Iron Man is more of the same drab animation & is a bore to watch.  Why this film is getting such good ratings is beyond me.  Have these people watched the same movie?  I don't understand how these films continue to get so much praise.  Are peoples standards so low that this is exceptable to them?  When I think of stellar animation, I think Disney, Dreamworks, & Miyazaki.  This crap Marvel has thrown at us is uncomparable.  You say those are all top of the line studios, well Lions Gate wants you to believe that's what you're getting with these releases & that just isn't so.

I've wanted to love these movies so much everytime one has been released, but every time I've been disapointed & let down.  The animation isn't state of the art, to the contrary I'd call it little better than a Saturday morning cartoon.  The story again like ""UA"" 1 & 2 is horribly long & drawn out which is a shame.  Given the source material there's really no excuse for this to happen.  Like another reviewer has already asked ""How do you screw up Iron Man"".  Well in answer to that question, watch this & you'll see exactly that.  Avoid this movie & all the others & send Marvel & LionsGate a message that we don't like the sloppy rush jobs they're doing on our characters.",1167955200,11,1258,4.3896103896103895
2683427,2,B000K7UBTI,"Is it so wrong to expect high quality out of these movies?  Am I the only one who expect's these movies to be true to their respected books?  Why do these big shot movie exec's need to mess with the stories?  I say if it ain't broke don't fix it.

I understand that in live action films things don't always translate from the page to the screen & things need to be tweaked here & there to look & fit right; I understand that, really I do.  What I don't get is how you go to make some big budget(or call it that anyway)animated feature & then change around the story.  Why!?!?!?  You're animating, you're simply bringing those characters to life with movement.  It ain't the story that needs to be fixed obviously since the character has been alive & well for 50 years now.  How do you screw up something like ""Iron Man"" for gods sake?

Once again Marvel (Avi Arad) has given Lionsgate permission to take a beloved character & run it through the mud.  They've slapped a PG13 rating on something that at best a toddler might need a couple minutes of parental guidance.  The story is so dull long & drawn out a child probably wouldn't sit through the movie, that's probably where the PG13 came from.  We get the same shotty animation we saw in ""Ultimate Avengers 1 & 2"" mixed with poor CGI to try & cover up the shotty animation.  The animation is so bad that when there's character movement the picture blurs, that's how inconsistent this ""state of the art"" animation this really is.  I felt like I was watching a 90 minute episode of that god awful ""Iron Man"" cartoon from a few years ago.  Why was it necessary to make this film?  We're gonna get what I can only guess will be a much more superior live action film in '08 starring Robert Downey Jr & directed by John Favreau.  Why would you go and ruin a much loved property like this?  I know, it's because Lionsgate is all about money with no respect for the public who watch their films.  That's plane as day after watching this film.  Shame on you Marvel & good ridance Avi Arad.",1167868800,16,2033,4.325396825396825

Well unless you are buying a hundred thousand movie tickets then don't think that way. I thought this effort was entertaining, creative and had a great comic book spirit.

Super-hero movies have more often than not needlessly tweaked the hero's origin. This one did little more than move it forward in time. If you watch close you will catch on that Stark had built a whole slew of Iron Man suits before having to make the more primitive one to escape. Which kind of makes the ""origin"" irrelevant. The Mandarin was on-point as a classic villain and his minions were top notch as well.

The target market for animated comic book series is generally pre-teen and teenage kids. They didn't buy the first Iron Man comics fifty years ago, they just want an action film. I thought this one was fast moving and well made. And I thought the Iron Man portrayed here was more than consistent enough with anything ever in comic books.",1433116800,,1031,4.5675675675675675

When billionaire Tony Stark accidentally awakens an ancient evil while raising an old Chinese city, he must develop the means to stop it. Creating an exoskeleton armored suit, Tony becomes Iron Man and faces off against the Elementals, four supernatural beings that can control earth, fire, wind and water. Not only that, but he must face the evil emperor, the Mandarin. Can Iron Man stop the foe he inadvertently helped create?

You know, I might be in the minority, but I just couldn't get into this flick. I found it really slow, had not much Iron Man, and wasn't big on the animation.

From a story standpoint, the what-it-was-about, it was fine. It showed Tonys origin in creating the Iron Man armor, had him go up against one of his biggest villains, and had high stakes. Just wasn't really my thing. I like Iron Man, don't get me wrong, and am a fan of the live action movies, namely the first two, but this one wasn't really my thing. To each their own.

If you're an Iron Man and/or a Marvel junkie, Im sure youd really enjoy this or at least like it more than I did.

2683584,2,B000K7UBTI,"Never again will I be seduced by a film's cover. This 2D animated flick is a mismatched, generic little thing that's neither a satisfying story nor does it actually give us its main selling point - Iron Man. I'll elaborate.

This film is called The Invincible Iron Man, but a more accurate title would be Iron Man vs the Elementals. Set in China for the most part, our hero Tony Stark has to stop four elemental spirits from collecting a set of rings before they raise an evil deity, the Mandarin. Gee, sound familiar, doesn't it? Meanwhile, he must also contend with S.H.I.E.L.D., who are after him on a false lead of weapons trading with the Chinese. Tony's first and foremost ambition is to save a woman who has an uncanny connection with the whole thing.

The story of this movie is a generic mess that falls apart messily in the third act. It's a weird mishmash of Iron Man's origins (kidnapped by an organization and builds a suit to escape, this time when Iron Man ALREADY EXISTS!) with some supernatural jargon that Iron Man really feels awkward being in the same pot as. The most severe problem is the fact that Iron Man, as Iron Man, barely even appears. His classic red-and-gold armour? It appears in one scene only. That's right, the rest of the time he appears as prototype, grey or yellow Iron Man. Yet even they are very thriftily spared to the audience. This movie promises us Iron Man, then doesn't deliver.

Not even the Mandarin can save things. A force to be reckoned with in the comics and Iron Man animated series, here he barely even appears and, to add insult to injury, is amazingly easy to defeat!

The Invincible Iron Man is a poor, mismatched movie that looks especially sloppy and uninspired following the release of The Avengers (which, even though it is a live action movie of which Iron Man is only part, features twice as much Iron Man as this film does). Not even Iron Man's biggest fans can be guaranteed much here.",1335657600,4,1950,4.562857142857143
2683585,5,B000K7UBTI,"I really enjoyed this film. I thought it told the story rather well. The animation used CGI for a few parts, mainly covering the suits. Tony is a bit of a jerk at the beginning, but he comes around. I thought it had a good ending.",1334793600,2,230,4.021739130434782

First of all, this movie is deadly dull. Incredibly boring. It is also full of ""funny"" racist jokes, such as a Chinese man working with Rhody being unable to say his name correctly. Tony is portrayed as a pathetic, petulant whiner. There is literally nothing in this movie that you would want to expose to a kid- or yourself. I am both a cheapskate and a nerd but I still threw this thing in the garbage bin.

With the plethora of high quality animation coming out of Warner Brothers for their DC line, I decided to give some of Marvel's stock a crack.  I found this movie on Ebay for 99 cents (seriously, thats all I paid.) and I still feel as though I was ripped off.  The earlier reviews give a good overall gist of this terrible plot so there is no point in me rehashing.

2683601,2,B000K7UBTI,"This movie is a real tragedy.  The story and character development is above-par, but the absolutely horrible computer graphics bring down the entire film.  It starts with Stark Industries, despite having been warned against doing so, using breakthrough technology to raise an ancient (and cursed) city in China.  This fulfills an ancient curse and releases elemental demons.  Tony Stark is captured by Chinese rebels and forced to design a weapon capable of leveling the city once again.  Following Stark's origin, he builds Iron Man armor to escape.  In order to defeat these mystical monsters he is responsible for releasing, Tony Stark must become the Invincible Iron Man and find a way to save the world.

As it stands, Invincible Iron Man has strengths but some serious weaknesses. Tony Stark is well handled pretty well here, though still cannot touch the amazing work done by Robert Downey Jr.  The female lead is quite good and her story arc is touching; introducing an Asian cultural theme of family duty that most Americans, especially Tony Stark, cannot comprehend.  The overall plot is serviceable, but the villains rather underwhelming, especially because of the terrible inconsistency between animation and cgi.  Most of the film is traditionally animated, but the villains, (and Iron Man himself during some of the fights), are done with very cheesy cel animation.  Maybe it would've been impressive in, idk, the 90's?  Saying it looks like a cut-scene from an original X-Box game would be insulting the X-box.
This honestly could have been one of the better films, but the animation is just so horrible that it hijacks the entire film.  There's some great character work with Tony Stark and the overall storyline is serviceable.  If you're a hardcore fan and don't mind your fight scenes looking like something out of The Sim's, then you'll probably enjoy Invincible Iron Man. But if you're a normal human being, there's no way you'll watch this over the 2008 Iron Man starring Robert Downey Jr.",1278720000,,2011,5.054545454545455

So, I decided to give this 5 stars, to offset all the negative ""reviews"".  First off, I know this is animated.  I can clearly see that it says it is animated on the box, twice even on the front!  Also, I do not see the names of Downey, Paltrow, Bridges, Favrue (?).  Third, I do see animated/cartoon picture stills from the movie on the back of the box (for those that can see it live).  That being said, it was a good movie, not only for an animated Iron Man story, but for one of Marvel's early attempts at the direct to video animated market (trailing behind DC, but quickly catching up, and maybe even surpassing).

In my opinion, Marvel tried to re-introduce Iron Man for the modern age.  This isn't a Silver Age or Ultimates storyline.  I still enjoyed it, and looking forward to a sequel.",1265328000,,1164,4.443396226415095
2683604,2,B000K7UBTI,"I can't say I am an IRONMAN afficionado, but I do like the cartoons and can even remember the 1960's animated show growing up.  The 1990's series was well-done and even the youngster version on now (IRONMAN: ARMORED ADVENTURES) are both worth seeing.  Unfortunately, that's not the case with this DVD/Blu-Ray (I have the regular DVD).  Considering how well the IRONMAN movie did, this animated version was a big disappointment.

First, the origins of Ironman theme is slow building.  Second, the main battle in the film seems to be corporate subterfuge.  Third, you really never see or hear from The Mandarin, just a ghostly apparition at the end.  I'm not even crazy about the animation/artwork in this film, although that was the least of my concerns.  Their just isn't enough of Ironman or action in this DVD/BR to make it worth the purchase.  Rental?  Maybe.  Or maybe best to just wait for it to show up on one of the cartoon channels on cable/satellite.

I have yet to check out some of the other MARVEL Comics DVDs/BRs but the reviews there seem to be much better.  But I can't see this DVD as one that either IRONMAN fans or MARVEL fans will be happy with.  I think it is the classic DVD that you watch once and then watch it collect dust for the next few years.  If you want some recent animated releases that will have you watching and re-watching after you've seen it initially, try the SUPERMAN/BATMAN PUBLIC ENEMIES or GREEN LANTERN:  FIRST FLIGHT Blu-Ray's.  Both have plenty of action, good storylines, great story arcs faithful to the comics or recent animated shows, and animation that is translates very well for HDTV/Blu-Ray.  Alot more features on the Blu-Rays than on this DVD, but even if the IRONMAN BR has alot of extras, it won't make up for the mediocre movie product.

Doctor Strange and the Avengers have also been put out this way on blu ray.  But I can understand if you bought this without seeing the box that you would be upset. Anyways the live action movie was closer to what the comics where than this movie is and that's not a good thing.  The mandarin is a classic iron man villian, who is not some ancient creature with powers but a man from asia who leads a crime organization and has powerful weapon rings. This animated story goes off into a mythological story that would have fit doctor strange better. Iron mans foes are more down to earth types like the crimson dynamo and others; not mythalogical creatures.  In spite of that the movie is entertaining and on blu ray it looks great.  I just wish that they would stick closer to the original comics and not stray from what made the iron man stories so classic.  Iron man fights solid powerful villians who use technology to make weapons and armor mainly.  At least that's what he mainly fought!  The Mandarin used technology to battle iron man not magic.

2683614,2,B000K7UBTI,"After having seen the live action version of Iron Man, I figured I would check out this animated feature released in 2007.  I wasn't aware upon renting THE INVINCIBLE IRON MAN that this film was going to be a revised telling of Iron Man's origins and those of his arch nemesis, The Mandarin.  The action of the film is set in modern day China.  Billionaire Tony Stark is raising an ancient Chinese city from below ground, against the advice of the board of directors of his company, Stark Industries.  In doing so, he inadvertently awakens some evil ancient magic that starts to cause chaos.  Tony's best friend and leader of the excavation, James ""Rhodey"" Rhodes, is kidnapped and disappears.  Tony travels to China in search of his friend and to oversee the end of the excavation.  However, the armored unit that Tony is a part of is attacked and Tony is taken prisoner by the Jade Dragons, the same people who kidnapped Rhodey.  In the attack Tony is mortally wounded.  He is saved by the magical powers of a Chinese wise man and the medical quick-thinking of Rhodey.  The Jade Dragons want Tony to build a weapon to destroy the Chinese city.  Instead, he crafts a suit of iron armor that he uses to help himself and Rhodey escape.  When Tony and Rhodey return to the U.S. agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. attempt to ""arrest"" the duo.  They escape and they plan on how to get into Stark Industry headquarters to get the equipment they need to bring down the ancient Elementals awakened from the excavation site who are now causing havoc across the four corners of the globe.

I was disappointed by THE INVINCIBLE IRON MAN.  As I mentioned at the beginning, I was not aware that this was a updating and revision of the Iron Man origins story.  I don't have a huge problem with updating the story.  As times change it sometimes makes sense to update a character's origins, ala the recent IRON MAN live-action movie.  Therefore, I didn't have a problem with moving the main setting of the Iron Man's origins from Vietnam to China.  Also, the action sequences were okay, especially the battle between Iron Man and the elementals below the ocean and inside the volcano. It was all the other little things that the filmmakers did to the story.  For instance, having Rhodey with Tony and being one of the people responsible for saving his life; the iron suit Tony makes while a prisoner is not his first and is really just a improved version of many he has already created; Howard Stark did not die in a car accident and is still alive and well and is chairman of the board of Stark Industries; the rather lame ""appearance"" of The Mandarin; etc.  Overall, the animation is a typical action-animated piece with nothing that really stood out in terms of style, tone, or appearance.  There's also an incredible amount of time spent with the person of Tony Stark, yet there is very little development of his character at all.  I don't have a problem with Tony being the focus of the feature, but if that's going to be the case there should be some real character growth and there's just not.

Viewers are better off watching the live-action version of IRON MAN instead of sitting through this dissatisfying mess.

The DVD includes several extras including an alternate opening sequence, the origin of Iron Man featurette (which is a making of piece), the Hall of Iron Man Armor, sequence of concept art, the first scene from a Dr. Strange animated movie from the same company who made THE INVINCIBLE IRON MAN, and several trailers for other films.  The Hall of Iron Man Armor is very interesting.  It has pictures with detailed information about almost every different Iron Man suit that Tony Stark has worn over the years.  I learned some things about the character from the Hall of Iron Man Armor.  I also really enjoyed the DR. STRANGE preview.

That being said, this was disappointing. The Invincible Iron Man purports to tell the story of the origins of Tony Stark and Iron Man and his first adventure, much like the movie. It doesn't - it almost completely skips over any setup, any character development, any comic relief, and jumps straight into the his first ""adventure"".

This adventure, also, was problematic. Dragons, warriors, non-corporeal beings...not very compelling, and a complete mismatch stylistically with the rest of the film.

Additionally, there was way too much romance, too much drama, and not nearly enough action. I thought the major advantage of making an animation movie was that the action sequences are more affordable. Why, on earth, would so much of the film be devoted to boring dialog?

It did have some good qualities. The few action sequence were fun. The animation was good, decent production value. But overall, unless you're a huge fan who must see every Iron Man installment, I'd say skip this one.",1221523200,3,1226,4.936893203883495

From Marvel Comics and Lionsgate, ""The Invincible Iron Man"" is another direct-to-DVD film in Marvel's new line of animated features, this one conveniently preceding a new live-action film starring Robert Downey, Jr. which comes out tomorrow (as I write this review). Both Marvel and DC have gotten into the direct-to-video animated features arena, and for many fans of their classic characters this is a great thing. Of course, modernizing these beloved characters and stories and recreating them a bit for a new, wider audience doesn't sit too well with some of the diehard comic fans (who should really watch Mark Hamill's ""Comic Book: The Movie"" if they haven't already) that are set in their ways about how they feel these characters must be portrayed. To a certain degree, this is understandable, but then you have the folks who gripe about every little change and update. Anyway, another problem had, particularly with animated features here in the States, is this desire to cater to a more adult audience, but at the same time, the notion that animated features must be targeted to kids too (Fact is, here in the States there are still a lot of dummies who think that if it's animated or comic book related, it should be totally aimed at kids and adults should have no interest in it). There is a difficulty in figuring out how to make something that is in that middle area for action and violence oriented subject matter, largely because kid material nowadays is expected to be so unthreatening and cheeseball. And this film, like so many other American animated features meant to be edgy the way so much Anime is, suffers from that problem a bit. Though the plot has some adult angles to it (which sometimes feel rather forced), the whole ""get the rings before the bad guys do"" has a sort of kiddie Anime feel to it (even though I admit they do that sort of thing on Smallville all the time), and the lack of explanation of Tony Stark's anti-gun attitude gives the impression that he just feels that way because he's a ""good guy"", and good guys have to be anti-gun. It's also a bit convenient that Tony has been developing his Iron Man project for years before the real ""origin"" in this film. Elements like this do make one feel they are watching a film aimed at kids. But then you have implied sex and a hostage being shot in the head in the same film, so it's all rather unbalanced. It seems the filmmakers wanted this movie to be for young adults, so I just wish they'd worked on the story and writing a bit more to be more consistent with that idea. I also was bothered that a lot of this film's take on Stark gives me various Batman flashbacks, including boardroom scenes that feel they are right out of ""Batman Begins"" (my favorite superhero movie, by the way). Still, overall, this is a decent superhero film. I don't think folks who are new to the story of Iron Man will have much to complain about except that maybe it drags a bit. In other words, there could/should be a lot more Iron Man action. It's a bit slow to get going and the characters could be a bit less wooden. To me, DC still holds the crown when it comes to animation, and they have since the fantastic Batman the Animated Series of the '90's. As for the animation of ""The Invincible Iron Man,"" it has good moments and bad moments, but the integration of CGI is excellent and used on just the right things (I've long wanted to see some Star Wars animated films with a 2D/CGI mix along these lines, and we sorta got that with the Clone Wars, though I was more interested in post-Jedi stuff, but now they are going to go entirely with goofy looking CGI). I thought the music here was pretty good most of the time, as was the voice acting, but the characters could have been more likable and the plot a bit more involving and less condescending. It was pretty good nevertheless, but I have a feeling the bigscreen, live-action film is going to be much better. This is one worth owning if you are an animation, superhero, or Iron Man fanatic, but it's not likely to blow you away, and clearly many comic fans had a problem with the villain, Mandarin, only appearing for the final battle and only in a spirit form inhabiting one of the characters.

The DVD is decent in the extras department, by the way. It gives us the Origin of Iron Man featurette (which is a making-of program), a great informational gallery of Iron Man's various suits of armor, a concept art show, and a pretty cool alternate opening sequence. There is also quite a lengthy look at the opening of the new ""Doctor Strange"" animated feature. If you like this one, you'll surely want to pick up Ultimate Avengers and Ultimate Avengers 2, plus that new Doctor Strange flick, which I haven't seen but looks to have even better visuals than the previous titles. I also highly recommend Superman: Doomsday and Justice League: The New Frontier, not to mention the upcoming Batman: Gotham Knight (though be forewarned, that one is real Anime).",1209600000,,5743,4.5964912280701755

I was excited when I heard about not only the live action Iron Man film coming next May but an animated Iron Man film coming to DVD. I just watched it last night and I'm very, very upset.  I've noticed that the American child audience is in love with Japanese Anime cartoons. You see it every day on the Cartoon Network and now, Marvel followed suit with the animated Iron Man flick. Oh, how the mighty have fallen, Iron Man has become Anime. Even the story takes place in China! It's not about Iron Man and War Machine, it's Iron Man and ancient Chinese spirits! The only notable thing about this movie is that the basic origin of Iron Man is here but this time, a Chinese gang has kidnapped him and he has to battle Chinese elemental gods. Wow. Nice going Marvel. Ruin a great superhero. Even the special features aren't worth it. There's a feature called ""The Origin of Iron Man"" which leads you to believe it's about the true origin of Iron Man but it's actually about the origin of the movie. It's basically the making of the movie. They mention a bit of the real origin(Tony was a munitions dealer in 'Nam, stepped on a mine and a piece of scrap metal gets him right in the chest...we know the rest) but it's not what you'd expect. They wanted the movie current, so they went with ancient China! C'Mon! How many times have they reverted to the trite plot of ancient Chinese spirits?!!

Let me say that these past recent years, I've been utterly disgusted with the heads currently in charge at Marvel. Much like the crappy Spider Man 3, Iron Man is yet another assembly line mediocre attempt by marvel to cash in off die hard fans nastalgia.
I won't go into detail concerning the plot of Iron Man, simply because its predictable, unbelievable, and just crappy all across the board.

As a kid, I hated D.C. comics, for reasons only die hard marvel fans can understand. Those cardboard cutout plots, the cape's, and generic goodguy badguy lines in the sand. While marvel represented a rebelousness, gen X, characters who were neither good nore bad, but existed in shadowy shades of gray. Yet thats how I felt as a kid.
Today, I cant pull myself away from the brilliance that is the Justice League cartoon series, Batman cartoons, and other D.C. projects. Simply because they go above and beyond creativity, allowing the artist to stay true to the characters while boldy pushing boundries.

2683629,4,B000K7UBTI,I am old school too.  Iron Man was born in Vietnam not China.  In the interest of making the story more today that was okay.  The story line was decent too.  The ending was out of character.  Are you an Iron Man fan?  You know the movie is taking liberties with the character too.  A bit overpriced at the moment.

2683630,1,B000K7UBTI,"I am clueless how anyone can claim to enjoy The Invincible China-Man (I mean Iron Man).  This movie was just pure garbage.

Where to begin?  How about the box that clearly shows a Red-Yellow Armored Iron Man battling the Mandrin.  YEAH!  That never happens any where in the movie.  Instead we get Iron-Man trapsing around the globe gathering up the rings of the Mandarin before his Elementals (the weak excuse of a lazy writer to choose 4 villains with element powers) can reach them.  I think I saw this exact same plot in one of the G.I. Joe cartoons from the 1980's.

So much of the movie is spent on the completely unimportant story of Li Mei that I was beginning to question whose movie this truly was.  The movie is 80-minutes.  About 77-minutes leads to the build up of the appearance of the Mandarin.  And when he shows up does he battle Iron-Man?  Not really.  He throws him around until Li Mei has the power to defeat him.  PLEASE!  Did the makers of this movie want us to feel it had much of a connection to Iron-Man?  THE Iron-Man!  Marvel Comic's Iron-Man!

I could rant all day long but suffice to say that the movie is PG-13.  Now understand it is NOT for kids.  Unless you want your kid to see Tony Stark in a hot tub with a woman (naked), Tony showering (naked) in front of Pepper his secretary, Li Mei remembering the time she tried to commit suicide by looking at her wrist scars, and a man slapping a woman around because she's not a Man-Child.  Of course, the movie isn't really for an adult with any semblance of intelligence because the plot is dull, the music LAME-O, Iron-Man battling a dragon shouldn't be the focus...fighting the Mandarin should be the focus, most of it feels childish, and it's just NOT a good movie nor one that should be connected to the Marvel Comics character.  Marvel needed to make a simple decision is this for KIDS or ADULTS.  They failed for both markets.

I hated this DVD!  Shame on you Marvel for allowing junk like this to pollute the shelf of my video store and tarnish a good character!

By the way. Why does every film about a superhero have to recap the origin of the superhero? Why can't we just say; ""He's a millionaire, he wears an iron suit, he blows stuff up.""

Afterwards, there are few moments in the storyline that could really leave you in awe.

For my taste, the only parts where I liked what I saw, was some (not all) of the CGI-induced animation, where some of the movements were very life-like.

2683653,3,B000K7UBTI,"This is the third direct-to-dvd effort from Marvel/Lions Gate, and rather than giving us another superhero team, we get an origin story treatment on everyone's favourite shellhead. An ancient evil called the Mandarin has been unleashed, and only Tony Stark can stop it before it destroys the world.

I like this one better than the two Ultimate Avengers efforts, though it's still lacking in certain respects. On the positive side, I like how the film doesn't feel compelled to show us the modern Iron Man armor until late into the movie. It's a gutsy move, and ultimately makes me respect the character history just a little more. The Mandarin is also an interesting choice for a first villain in that old 'science vs. magic' way. The elementals make for cool visuals.

Really though, I just don't find myself caring for Tony Stark much. The script's attempts at giving him character come off as forced, and overall I just found Stark and his problems kind of bland. It seems to be the trend with all of Marvel's animated features, especially compared to the stronger DC Justice League material. When the character is weak, the story is weak. And when the story is weak, the bland animation doesn't help much either.

The DVD comes with some featurettes that cover Iron Man's history, and also some interviews from the creative team. This is worth a rental for all comic book fans at the very least, but it lacks the re-watchability of Hellboy, Justice League, and the 90s X-Men/Spider-Man shows.",1176422400,2,1497,4.83984375

(At least I enjoyed an unplanned sleepy time about 3/4 into ""Iron Man"".) The CGI reminded me of the old anime ""Lensman"": used mostly without flair, and totally lifeless compared to the regular animation.

2683657,2,B000K7UBTI,"I'm going to take the con side of this debate.  Having not really read many comics in the past 20 years or so I really haven't followed any of the Ultimates stuff.  I have had it explained to me by a co-worker that's a big comic buff.  It seems to make sense to update some heros' origins.  After all Nick Fury and Dum Dum Dugan would be in their ninties these days.  I understand that they are also keeping the original origins in place which is fine.  Having said that, I don't know if this is an Ultimate storyline or not but I didn't care for it at all.

Taken as a stand alone movie, if viewed by someone with no idea of who Iron Man is, this is really run of the mill.  Tony Stark wasn't a very cohesive character.  As far as alter-egos go this one is kind of a hypocritical milksap.  He makes a big deal out of not building weapons but has an entire room full of indestructible power armor.  If the suits are for research why the need for powerful lasers and missles?  The writer's seem to face the same dilemma most of Hollywood finds itself in these days.  It's politically incorrect to endorse violence but you still have to give the audience a good action packed fight scene.  As a result you get unrealistic portrayals of altruistic millionaire industrialists and pacifists with more weapons than Dirty Harry.  I may be reading a little too much into a cartoon but the level of some of the violence here (one person gets executed with a gunshot to the back of the head) suggests this is for a mature audience.  If this is the case the writers should have given the actions and motivations more depth.

The biggest problem is the time it takes to actually get to Iron Man.  Once there the fight scenes are few and far between.  The film suffers from the same problem a lot of live action superhero movies suffer from, too much screen time for the alter-ego.  The action sequences are lacking visual impact.  I think that is partly due to the mediocre quality of the animation.  The CG doesn't mix too badly with the hand drawn but it's all just servicable at best.

In the end the movie seemed overly long and convulted with the end being a less than satisfying resolution.  Even if I weren't aware of Iron Man before this I don't think I would recommend it as anything more than a rental.",1174780800,42,2300,4.357647058823529

2683660,1,B000K7UBTI,"I watched this movie in hopes that it would somehow stand above the lackluster and manic Ultimates animated films but instead found something far worse. I'm not going to go into much detail, but suffice it to say Iron Man is a terrible movie wrought with cliches and unnecessary amounts of exposition.

The Chinese characters are all stereotypes who talk in obnoxiously cryptic manners and inherently know martial arts. The worst of which being the update of Professor Yinsen from Iron Man's origin, originally a brilliant physicist who assists in the construction of the original armor, now reduced to a yellowface, monk cliche who practices calligraphy whilst describing ancient Chinese legends to Stark.

The blend of CG and cel animation is ugly and reminded me of the nineties Silver Surfer cartoon when the techniques were first being practiced. Movements for CG characters are stiff and awkward and the graphics themselves look dated and videogame-y. The CG characters also appear to be always hovering over the cel animation, looking as if they're skating when they're supposed to be running.

Also, this really isn't a film about Tony Stark. This is a movie about the legend of The Mandarin and how the world is suppose to stop it - Tony just 'happens' to be there when it takes place. Except for the original armor; updated as an absurdly over-designed, weapon strapped tool for escape, all of his armors are already built, their existence treated with the simple explanation of, ""These are exo-suits I've been building in secret!"" They're also displayed with the utmost fan-service in mind (The audience is treated to glimpses of the Hulk-Buster and Ultimates suit to name a few) and seem to only fail, having absolutely no impact on the events of the film.

Beyond that, Tony's character is the victim of a seen-it-a-million-times father/son relationship and the over-arching theme of Tony learning to conquer his ego-centric personality goes nowhere. At one point he does actually announces that he's aware he needs to be a better person, blah blah blah, but the film ends with him more self-involved than before.

Anyhow, this movie sucks. Hopefully the live-action film will take what is certainly a rich character and do it justice.",1174262400,9,2248,5.048517520215634

The ninjas are trying to stop a Stark Enterprise-funded raising of an ancient Chinese city and, potentially, the re-animation of a fabled evil-doer named the Mandarin.

 People are taking their comic book heroes very serious nowadays, and this shot-for-video includes a helpful ""The Origins of Iron Man"" featurette that more or less clears up the things I'd forgotten about ol' Shellhead.  Just in time, too, since a big screen, live-action movie is planned for release in the summer of 2008 - a little over a year from when this review was written.  Anyway, in the original origin story Tony Stark was injured while in Vietnam, shrapnel in or near his heart or something like that, and he needed an iron lung-type medical device to stay alive.  In INVINCIBLE IRON MAN they drop Vietnam, keep Asia, the chest wound and the custom-cut iron suit.  The other big change in the story, according to the featurette (and some less-than-happy blog postings I've read recently) is the Armor Room, hidden deep in Stark Enterprise's headquarter, which holds the Underwater suit, the Outer Space suit, etc.  Apparently the suits changed slowly over time, and the Armor Room represents a type of heresy - Tony Stark did NOT create all those suits at once before he was even Iron Man!  Which may be true, but the multitude of suits allow Iron Man more costume changes than a Follies chorus girl during a Saturday matinee, and if they aren't true to the comic book history they probably make the action figure manufacturers happy enough.

  Fidelity to the source, in this case, doesn't matter that much to me.  When they raise that Chinese city, with inflatable steel, no less, four Elementals are awakened.  They, in turn, must locate five rings to awaken the big boss Mandarin.  All that stands between them and that unimaginable horror is Iron Man.  What does matter to me in an animated action comic book is plot and action.  The plot, they have to find five rings in five distinct quests, would fit well in a video game (really, this feature is a marketer's dream) and otherwise does adequate, if not spectacular, service as a plot.  The action - Iron Man battling the Elementals at each stage before squaring off against the big boss - were pretty well done.  I didn't know they were mixing CGI with 2-D animation, but they do so here with middling results.  The Elementals, representing Earth, Ice, etc. are your typical air-borne meanies with the special ability to control different elements.  Some of the footage of the Elementals was computer generated, and it shows.  I'm not the target audience for a movie like this, but as someone who remembers Iron Man from his 1960's and 1970's comic book incarnation, I am someone the film makers hoped to appeal to.

The animators used more CGI here than in the Avengers animated movies, but it meshes well with the cell animation.  The lava animation in the underground battle scene is excellent.  The pacing is fairly good and the changes made to both Iron Man's and the Mandarin's origins were clearly wise decisions.  Changes are good as long as they make sense.  The changes made here certainly do, especially in today's day and age where viewers tend to be more sophisticated.

It's a cartoon, gee whizz. Even the brief 'woman in the tub' snit, she was covered at all times, steam, towel, behind glass, not like there was any nudity for 'kids' to see.

The animation is awesome, they blended CGI and 2-D animation very well.

The Engineer was o.k.,I mean, I didn't see much fault. He does honestly point out to Tony some bad char traits of his. Some STARK board members were total creeps, but hey, thats Corperate America.

We do see Tony change into a more thoughtful person after his accident. There's only so much char developement you can do in one show.

The action was great and movie had a twist at the end.

As to the 'original Armour being used a lot', this movie IS an ORIGIN story. You get to see Tony use various models as well. I like this DVD and am very happy to own it. I hope MARVEL makes another!",1172188800,2,895,4.266272189349112

Lets say this Iron Man is not the Iron Man you see on the cover of this DVD. That is for future DVD animated releases

This is classic Shell Head from the 1960's with the basic grey suit. The origin story changes from Vietnam (as it was in the 1960's comic) to China. However most of the original story line stays the same  in this animated feature

This is visually one of the better comic cartoons I have seen, better than the avengers that Marvel did earlier. The voice talent is slightly lacking, but it is better the 1990's cartoon version with the voice of Robert Hayes as Stark/Iron Man

On the bonus features, animators and comic artists discuss Iron Man, the DVD is worth that alone for a true comic fanboy. Also as a bonus, the future released Dr Stange is previewed..wetting your whistle for it

2683700,2,B000K7UBTI,"This is almost exactly what I hoped it wouldn't be. I could have tolerated a little tinkering with the standard origin, but what they came up with runs so contrary to what the Iron Man comic has been about that it's almost a slap in the face. For a hero and comic that's so concerned with the technological, to watch the storyline just kind of decompose into hokey mumbo jumbo while almost 44 years of history aren't just tossed to the side, but into the dirt, that's hard for me to swallow.

The fact is, the story wasn't just different, it was BAD. The pacing was awful, and honestly, the only parts really worth watching are the battle sequences (minus the awful non-event that is the ""Mandarin"" face-off). I was pleased with the Ultimate Avengers movies, I thought they portrayed Iron Man well, and while they didn't really portray either Ultimate Iron Man or classic Iron Man exactly right, as the character was more or less an amalgamation of the two, he was much closer than this take on him, which basically has him with this emo-angst, I have to prove something to daddy thing. Howard should have been left DEAD.

So to sum it up. What I thought was WRONG about Iron Man:

1) Hokey, mumbo-jumbo filled story that ignores Tony Starks genius and reduces him to merely a reactionary shell of the comic character.

2) Howard Stark...alive.

3) Rhodey...a wimp (Army medic? COME ON!!!).

4) Pepper Potts...BRITISH?!? Was that to add a touch of class?

5) Mandarin...a GHOST?!? An emperor from some obscure Chinese Dynasty? Bleh...

6) A dragon that ISN'T Fin Fang Foom...

7) Iron Man using a sword (BTW, the 'prophecy' angle is tired and lame)!

8) A final 'battle' that is a non-event. Tony's whining throughout was particularly grating...

9) Too much time in the clunky origin armor (with all those other armors supposedly already made, including the Ultimate armor, and we get the Shellhead?).

10) Ignoring Tony's character. Now everyone thinks if you do a few cheesy pickup lines and have him drink some booze, you've nailed him. Where is the intelligence? Where is the wit? Where are the one-liners and critical thinking from the past? He's a genius (except when it comes to women)...treat him as one.

I'm stopping at 10...

This movie is poor. I'll give it an extra star for the battle sequences, which are at least entertaining, but the rest is boring, almost painful in some places. Hopefully the 2008 live-action film will fare much better.",1171670400,23,2457,4.737089201877934

Like I said before in my Avenger reviews, Iron Man was my favorite character, so how could I not check this one out and see how I liked Tony Stark flying solo.

Well, my reaction was a little mixed.  Tony has a great personality and sense of humor about him, so I would never say he's a boring character.  However, it seemed like they couldn't quite fill in the rest of the movie around him.  Jim Rhodes appears, but not as War Machine.  The love interest is forgettable.

The thing I found surprising is this is an origin story.  I figured this would take place after the events of UA 1 & 2, but instead takes place before.  Why not make this movie for fans who need no introduction, when the live action Iron Man movie is getting released next year which is sure to have yet another origin story.  It's seems like a little overkill.  I don't know if the Mandarin, Iron Man's archnemesis, will appear in the live action version or not, but he does in this installment.

The same can be said here where we get to learn all about the characters before a fateful situation causes Tony Stark to build the first Iron Man armor.  The CGI used on the Elementals and all the Iron Man armors is cool.  It really adds to the fight scenes.  What I really found interesting was the whole technology vs. magic theme.  It was always weird to me that The Mandarin, a mostly magic using villain, was Iron Man's nemesis in the comics.  But I think this was Marvel's chance to show this kind of a story.  For the Iron Man live action movie due out in 2008, director Jon Favreau has stated that his take on The Mandarin will be more tech than magic.  So this animated movie is a good way to show the tech vs. magic theme that will be absent from the live action movie.

An origin story, Invincible Iron Man finds billionaire industrialist playboy Tony Stark in over his head after restoring the buried city of an ancient Chinese kingdom.  Soon enough, Tony is critically injured, not to mention a fugitive, evil spirits are afoot, a prophecy is to be fulfilled, and the evil Mandarin is about to be resurrected.  Yeah, Iron Man is filled with the typical comic book trappings of an animated feature, but it is undoubtadly a fun ride while it lasts.  The action scenes are well done and the animation is crisp, clean, and uses the blends of 2-D and 3-D animation better than the Ultimate Avnegers DVD's did.  The voice talent is good as well, and while it may be longer than it should have been, it's still very entertaining and enjoyable.  Ignore a majority of the negative reviews here, just know that there's nothing great here, but you're guaranteed to get at least a bit of fun out of this.

I was quite please with art work, and layout of many stories that could be followed if the DVD sells. It was so amazing to follow the transition of Tony Stark (Iron Man) as the story unfolds. It is an animated film though the details were so life like. I believe the film was made for the adults than the youth audience. That's my only disappointment was the fact my six year old couldn't watch it. The storyline has covered so many previous comic books plots to present the modern version of the Iron Man within 83 minutes. The film feature the many different suits as a reader would follow through the comic book trail.

The idea of magic VS technology was the perfect conflict for Iron Man. The ancient world VS the modern world. Awesome.

2683718,2,B000K7UBTI,"*Sigh*

Origin stories are all well and good, but the title character doesn't even appear in the film until it's half over.  The focus here is on the flawed Tony Stark, rather than his heroic alter ego.  With a changed origin, this could have been an interesting film, but it was just so incredibly tedious.  Yes, Tony Stark is a jet-setting playboy and yes, two of the three females presented in the film are naked (hidden by steam or fog), and yes, the Stark board of directors is filled with evil, money-grubbing lawyers.  We get it.  Move on.

The animation when *not* in the battle sequences is quite good.  Unfortunately, the 4 evil elementals, the dragon, and Iron Man himself were rendered using an incredibly unrealistic CGI.  The characters themselves look stiff and wooden - like they were rendered on a home system and not a professional unit.  The characters actually bounce through the scenes, rarely having any meaningful relationship to their environment or actual gravity.  They moved like a collection of characters from an old video game, rather than state of the art animation.

*Sigh*

At least, when Iron Man did *finally* make an appearance, we were treated to several versions of the armor.  It was interesting to note just which version of the armor was the most powerful and durable.

So - if you love Iron Man more than life itself, or you are a completist who needs every bit of Marvel animation ever created, by all means buy this DVD.  Otherwise, rent it.  Or better yet, find someone else who already bought it and pick it up from them - cheap.",1170288000,3,1575,4.689781021897811

Yes they did change some things about his origin but so what.  It shows that Tony/Iron Man is just a very intelligent man in a suit.  He is a knight for all this movies shows.  I think marvel has a great thing goin with these animated series.

This movie has the feel of everyday, run of the mill, cartoon network type program, I mean why couldn't they use better animators, and have better designers for characters. The whole movie feels like it can't wait to finish, too much of a big rush to end it all.

For one the Jade's Dragon army looks like ancient Japanese then Chinese, one reason is the masks they are wearing.
And the Elementals as well, for example, the Earth Elemental is from Japanese mythology and not Chinese.  Watching the interviews of the people that worked on this movie, I wonder how much passion they ""really"" put in making this movie.

2683722,5,B000K7UBTI,"First, I'll admit I am not a fan of Marvel's Ultimate line of Comics, in fact, there are very few curent comics I want to read. They lack the sense of fun and adventure that comics are supposed to have.

But, this DVD does have the sense of adventure and is definately fun to watch. Yes it is ""modern"" re-telling of the origin of Iron Man, but not only does it keep the original ""Grey Knight"" suit, but also explains how he could manage to build it so fast (hint: he has had some practice in armor building, just has not played superhero yet).

The main villain is the Mandarin and his five elementals. Mandarin has also been re-imagined a little, he only has five rings, four with elemental powers and a surprising fifth ring. The elementals are vey well done and provide an excellent enemy to show off the abilities of Iron Man's classic Gold & Red suit and the Aquatic suit.

There is violence and some implied nudity (this is Tony Stark), but it is a very good DVD and I am looking forward to the next Dr Strange DVD, which I do hope is not the last Marvel DVD we see in this series.",1170028800,5,1087,4.241545893719807
2683723,4,B000K7UBTI,"Purists will no doubt be perturbed with the changes in the origin story. I enjoyed it, however.  It's fun, true to the spirit of the characters and has excellent production values.

The story uses the juxtaposition of the high tech world of Tony Stark against the ancient world of China to tell the origin of Iron Man. In about 83 minutes of movie, we get to see the beginnings of the character and a great battle against his enemy, Mandarin, using at least 4 Iron Man costumes. Rhodey is well featured and Pepper gets a few good scenes.

The film will probably change the way I read Iron Man. My imagination didn't have his suit being so noisy. It probably will, now.

The animation style is more subdued than the previous Ultimate Avengers films. Traditional 2D animation is used for backgrounds and people, with some CGI used for the Iron Man suits and the 5 elementals he fights. The CGI is not too overt, it just provides them with the capability for more dynamic special effects and better rotational motion.

The DVD also features a brief documentary about the origin of Iron Man, with interviews with the films creators and Joe Quesada. There is also a 2-3 minute clip from the upcoming Dr. Strange animated film. I'm not even sure Dr. Strange was in the clip, but that film looks pretty intense. Speaking of intense, the Iron Man film is PG-13. I'm guessing this is because there are a couple of characters that are shot and killed and there is a mild scene of Tony and a bimbette in a hot tub. Nothing that will prevent me from sending a copy to my 7 year old nephew.

This is not at the level of the Bruce Timm produced animations, but it's still a very nice script and the adaptations to the Iron Man mythos are not objectionable.  Without giving away any plot information, Iron Man's origin story is generally preserved but Rhodey and the Mandarin play central roles.  It was actually quite clever the way the Chinese setting is worked into the story since Stan Lee's original origin story would be politically incorrect and dated today.  The usually tedious process of presenting an origin story before you can start the movie story is completely eliminated here.  The ""new"" origin is actually an interesting story itself and drives the plot.  My take here is that the old comics fans will like this and new comics fans will like it too.  Pleasing both extremes is a tough task but I think they have accomplished it.  I hope the next movie has as tight and complete a script as this one.  I'd love to see a big-budget animated project, but with good writing, this level of production is just fine.

From this movie alone, I was able to see many different sides of Iron Man including his romantic relationships, his tense relationship with his father, his treatment of friendships, and his will when behind the mask. Although this is not a true-to-form representation of his origins as depicted in the comics, it is a very compelling story of his origins nontheless. At first I was a little dissapointed to know the main setting for confrontation was going to be a Chinese setting (it is becoming overused). However, the further into the film I got, the more quickly I decided there was an involving enough story being told here that the seemingly overused setting didn't matter.

It soon became clear to me why the main confrontational setting took place where and how it did; contrast. What better contrast to a technologically advanced flying iron man than an ancient civilization that goes as far back as the Chinese civilization depicted here does?

For someone like me, a non-Iron Man fan, this animated feature allowed me to see little bits and pieces of Tony Stark's and Iron Man's life. Because the entire story of his origins had to fit in one film instead of a series, I only get glimpses of each side of him. But it is enough to get a clear picture of him and understand him as a whole. Along the way of discovering who and what Iron Man is, I get to see it be told with a contrasting but fitting storyline.

Overall, this movie has let me know enough about Iron Man that it has turned me into an Iron Man fan. Maybe this animated film is not for hardcore Iron Man fans, but it is certainly a story worth appreciating and seeing.",1169683200,7,1858,4.455882352941177
2683763,3,B000K7UBTI,"I collected comics as a kid (and now that they've been releasing the collections on DVD, I've bought those as well), so I really enjoyed the two Avengers DVDs.  I was looking forward to this Ironman DVD.  All in all, I enjoyed it, but the whole retro vibe didn't work for me.  The cars look like they're from 1950, and the China setting--everybody looked like they came out of some Fu Manchu movie from 1930.  I would have rather seen them do a complete modern update.  I really liked the use of CGI though.  I thought it looked really cool and worked well.",1169596800,3,557,4.359223300970874
2683764,5,B000K7UBTI,This was a great addition to the Marvel Animated films. This did a good job of going over the history of Iron man and bringing in a great villain like Mandarin. A great film and a must buy for  comic book fans. Its a bit slow in parts but hey you gotta have character development. Cant wait for Dr. Strange,1169510400,2,306,4.1
2683765,5,B000K7UBTI,"I'm gonna keep it short and sweet because for the most part, I'm agreeing with the positive reviews/posts on the long-awaited Iron Man animated flick. I picked this one up as soon as it hit the rack and I must say that I was mind-blown...the 21st century upgrade, the storyline, the animation, the sci fi, the mysticism, the action, and the suspense were all there. This is yet another awesome Marvel Entertainment answer to the slew of DC Comics animated series/movies that have been dominating the media for the past decade or so, as a matter of fact, I recommend this one over the Ultimate Avengers 1 & 2(even though both are keepers just for being the 1st 2 Marvel animated movies). This one'll leave you all the more in anticipation of the live action Iron Man movie, the Doctor Strange animated movie, and many more(I'm hoping to see an all-new Incredible Hulk animated movie). Fundies may not agree, but this is a perfect example of a 21st century upgrade(via the Ultimates series) done right. Much respect to Marvel for giving us a HOT project featuring one of comicdom's most underrated legandary superheroes. Give us more!!!",1169510400,7,1134,4.790816326530612
2683766,3,B000K7UBTI,"I was looking forward to this movie as I have been a big fan of Iron Man for years. It started off really well.. the story was updated to modern times ok... I was disappointed in thier decision to waste a lot of time on the four elementals with so many great characters in the '5000 character library' that Marvel keeps bragging about... the dragon could have been Fin Fang Foom.. but it was't... Mandarin was some bizarre gender bending mystical spirit.. and where were the 10 rings? Overuse of the clunky gray armour, not enough red and gold...

They took too much liberty with the history. Maybe its my fault for having been a fan for too long and knowing too much of his history.. but so much change just for the sake of change isn't always a wise choice.

I can only hope it does well enough to warrant a decent sequel.. (not a disappointing one like Avengers 2) Focus on proven fun story lines like the Armor Wars, or some decent espionage stuff.. c'mon guys.. don't let us down.

Good attempt... hoping for way more from the live action movie.

thanks :-)",1169510400,6,1062,4.430769230769231
2683767,4,B000K7UBTI,"THE INVINCIBLE IRON MAN retcons the Iron Man mythos to a degree.  Given that Tony Stark was originally wounded in Vietnam in the 1960s and he would have been in his sixties, something had to be done.  So the creators brought the story into ""now"" and still maintained an Asian flavoring by setting Iron Man up against the Mandarin, one of Shellhead's oldest and coolest foes.

Die-hard purists are going to be disappointed in some aspects of the film, but it delivers enough action and characterization to get the job done.  Strangely, though, we don't really get to know that much about Tony or his relationship with his dad, Howard Stark.  We don't even get to know anything about why he created the Iron Man armor when he plainly states in the movie that he's never invented weapons.  The Iron Man armor has been compared to a human-sized F16 fighter jet loaded to the gills with munitions and destructive power.  Not to mention all the other cool, on-board technology.

The plot centers on Tony's efforts to help China raise a sunken city to engender goodwill that results in very profitable trade agreements.  However, the Jade Dragons -- a local group -- have attacked the dig site on a number of occasions to stop the city's recovery.  But Stark's technology is successful and the city returns to the surface.  Unfortunately, that return also heralds of the mystical forces that will ultimately resurrect the Mandarin.

I'm not sure if pitting a technology-based hero against the supernatural was a good idea for a first Iron Man movie.  For the fans like me, it wouldn't have been that much of a reach bccause we'd all be familiar with the Mandarin (though I'm pretty sure the comics alluded to the fact that the Mandarin's rings were alien tech at one point and not mystical).  But newcomers might be expected to see a technology versus technology battle, and that's really lacking here.

I didn't like the fact that S.H.I.E.L.D. was onstage mainly as the bad guys, or at least an opposing force, without any face time to put a more positive spin on them.  Nick Fury and his agents are some of my favorite characters.

There was a lot to like about the straight-to-DVD presentation, though.  The use of CGI animation throughout the film was good, and so were the action sequences.  One of the other BIG pluses was that a LOT of the other Iron Man armor was shown.  The specialized deep-sea armor took center stage during one battle.  And many of the other suits were on display.

Some of the scenes felt rushed, and plot development was thin.  The Mandarin was late in getting into the mix, though the four Elementals working on his behalf were there, and never quite came to fruition as a real threat.

But the chance to see Iron Man onscreen in your living room is just too good to pass up.  Buy this one for comic geeks' night, or for the kids.  Then have a seat with your friends or your children, and get down to a night of superheroing Iron Man style.",1169424000,17,2965,4.6106870229007635
2683768,4,B000K7UBTI,"I liked it.  My wife and I watched it last night (advance copies are sometimes available before the ""official"" release, a point for the gentleman who doubted anyone had actually seen it to consider) and we both enjoyed it quite a bit.  Neither of us are fans of the comic.  She's hardly read any (she is a serious comics fan but her reading of Marvel titles centers mostly on the X-Men).  I was a fan back when the character first appeared but quit reading in the mid '70s.  So we are not burdened with a deep knowledge of all that has happened to Iron Man in his decades-long existence.  We took the story as presented and thought it was well written, well acted and well animated.  Sure, it's not up to Pixar standards but the animation was as good as the best TV supehero animation (I'm a big fan of the animated Batman, Superman and Justice League series) and better than most.  If you don't compare it word-for-word and scene-for-scene with the comic, I think there's a good chance you will enjoy it, too.",1169337600,8,1010,4.451086956521739

2683770,4,B000K7UBTI,"It appears that the big wigs at MARVEL want to get as much wattage out of their product and produce merchandise that continues to ""re-vamp"" their cannon of characters.  This foray into the ""Invincible Iron Man"" is more in the vien of what we've seen with the recent ""Ultimate Avengers"" line and is really very dramatically portrayed.  It's not great...the animation stands to be tweaked still...but the combination of computer-wizardry to bring to life Iron Man is quite engaging.

If you're a fan and anxiously awaiting the upcoming big screen venture, this is for you, but the real nugget here is the sneak-peek into the next MARVEL animation release: DOCTOR STRANGE!  Now that's one property they can evolve into a fantastic series!",1168128000,12,735,5.0
