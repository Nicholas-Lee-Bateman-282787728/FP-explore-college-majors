7996871,5,B0000ADXDM,"Apparently, each volume of the Orange Island set is going to be released within a year of each other, so we won't have a complete set until 2004. Oh well. Anyway, Ash's jaunt into the Orange Islands continues, and starts off with a bang with:
#240 - Navel Maneuvers: Ash makes it to Navel Island, where he faces the gym leader Danny in a three part take all match! Tracey is rooting for Ash, but it appears Misty has developed a crush for Danny!
#241 - Snack Attack: After Ash wins his second badge, the crew stops by the Grapefruit Islands, where they find a giant Snorlax is on a feeding frenzy! Can they help Ruby the grapefruit farmer fend off Snorlax? Or can they find some help from everyone's favorite musical pink puffball?
#242 - Shipful of Shivers: An ancient artifact is recovered from a wrecked ship, only to have it stolen by Team Rocket! But when they and Ash find themselves on a haunted ship, they've got more than they bargained for!
#243 - Meowth Rules!: Still considered to be one of the best episodes of the entire series, the focus is put on Team Rocket, as they crash land on an island where Meowth is assumed to be the ""Great Meowth of Bounty"", a Pokemon God that will bring great wealth to the people!
#244 - Tracy Gets Bugged: The kids find a battered Scyther when they stop on an island, and discover it has been kicked out of it's hive! Also, Jessie gets a haircut.
#245 - A Way Off Day Off: Everyone decides to take a day off, except for Team Rocket, who attempt to steal Ash's Charizard!
#246 - The Mandarin Island Miss Match: Ash is getting a little arrogant until he meets Lorelei, one of the Elite Four.
#247 - Wherefore Art Thou, Pokemon: Two trainers hate each others guts but their Nidoran seem to love each other. Naturally, Misty has to butt in.
#248 - Git Along, Little Pokemon: The crew meets Pancha, a Magnemite rancher who uses his Magnemite to gather electricity for all the towns on the island.
#249 - The Mystery Menace: Bulbasaur is kidnapped by a mysterious Pokemon that lives in the sewers under the town. But when Ash tries to rescue Bulbasaur, he find that the Mayor of the city is doing everything he can to prevent anyone from discovering the mystery Pokemon.
#250 - Misty Meets Her Match: Ash makes his way to Trovita Island and it's musical Gym Leader, Rudy, who is immediately smitten with Misty. As the battles progress, Misty has to make a choice... Ash or Rudy?
#251 - Bound For Trouble: Team Rocket finally captures Pikachu! At least, until a giant Pigeot carries away Pikachu and Meowth. Chained together, both have to work together to get back to their trainers.
As I've stated in earlier reviews, the Orange Islands series is considered by many to be the best of all the Pokemon series. This collection of episodes is great, since you get lots of comedy and lots of action packed episodes, with only a couple of lesser episodes. This is a must have for any Pokemon fan.",1059264000,31,2930,4.478504672897197
