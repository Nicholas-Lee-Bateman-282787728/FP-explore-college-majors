5731149,1,B003G47HY4,This is a movie about a collection of maniacs and has nothing to do with actual vocations or the lived experience of Catholic nuns.,1470268800,4,131,4.5

5731151,3,B003G47HY4,"Joannas family and friends are not the church-going type. So you can imagine the resistance to her announcement that she has been called to become a nun. She is determined to find out for herself whether or not this calling is authentic.

Some may not like this movie, as it appears to be quite sacrilegious and even irreverent at times. I like to think of it as merely human, maybe even truthful. There are many humorous characters here, and some funny scenes as well, but Joanna is determined in spite of all the nuns and priests failings. Joannas sincere and serious determination doesnt quite fit in with all the slapstick, creating an uncomfortable feeling of incongruency. However, it is inspiring in its own way.

If you are looking for realism and theologically-accurate or even a reverent film, this is not for you. But I think it has value, in that it shows the importance of believing in and trusting yourself enough, and things will finally work out in the end.",1469750400,2,973,4.7176470588235295

5731153,1,B003G47HY4,They shouldn't list this movie among the Catholic movies. Horrible movie.,1468627200,2,73,5.7272727272727275
5731154,4,B003G47HY4,"I enjoyed the performances in this quirky, but unrealistic depiction of a young nun's attempt at religious life. A mix of comedy and tragedy, it may not be suitable for ardent Catholics who are easily offended by the antics of less-than-perfect representatives of their faith.",1468627200,,276,5.155555555555556
5731155,5,B003G47HY4,Excellent story!!!,1467590400,,18,8.5
5731156,2,B003G47HY4,"I gave this movie two stars because it has a great deal of entertainment value, which is quite good for such ugly anti-Catholic propaganda. If you are a Catholic who has chosen this film for a dramatization of that very real calling to religious life, you will be rather disappointed.

If you think the Catholic church is an object of ridicule in our evolved society, then this film is for you. It will confirm all the general attitudes the popular culture propagates about Catholicism.

Unfortunately,because the movie is entertaining and well-written, it does a great deal of harm to anyone who might be called to a contemplative life of prayer.

Every character in the movie is deeply flawed, just as every fallen human is deeply flawed. But the flaws of the Catholics in this movie are viewed as what is evil--and too many scenes suggest that no one takes her faith very seriously, although all of the nuns take the convent very seriously. The two male Catholic authority figures are presented as heavy handed, angry, and pompous. The nuns in the convent, however, are not Catholic nuns. Catholic nuns who live out their vows do not read The Gospel of Mary for spiritual guidance. And a vocation to serve in the world is NOT the same as a vocation to a cloistered life of prayer.",1464566400,10,1283,4.693333333333333

5731166,2,B003G47HY4,"REALLY. STRANGE. MOVIE. Really strange. It started off kind of cute and funny, but quickly began to go down hill. A young woman (good actress, bad part) who thinks she might have a calling approaches a convent of nuns to see if they can help her, and from the start she is treated rudely and callously. Yet she persists, and the rudeness and strangeness just continues to spiral out of control in ways that are just too absurd and overly done. I cannot imagine anyone staying in that convent. I understand that people are human, but the sheer amount of things going on in this movie amongst so many different people is hard to believe when given in so many doses. Plus, the film lacked any real spiritual quality, so it was sort of like a farse gone bad. I do not understand the reviewers who felt this was realistic. Yes, maybe some of these things could have happened, but focusing on all of them and cramming them into a two hour film made it look something like a surreal nuthouse. Highly unrealistic in that regard, and a disappointment. A film that could have had great depth and meaning ended up looking like a fake romp through a very dysfunctional bunch. They also could have explored her so called ""visions"" and ""voices,"" which would have been highly intersting and given the film a lot of meaning, but they never went beyong letting you know that she had them. Really a let down, but the lead actress was a good actress nonetheless.",1444003200,8,1443,4.532567049808429
5731167,4,B003G47HY4,Great!  Very realistic and human tratment if religious life!,1440633600,,60,5.666666666666667

5731169,4,B003G47HY4,"The usual misconceptions are present in this film regarding the teachings of the church, particularly in connection with human sexuality.  However, the treatment of this girl, trying to swim against the tide to give her life to God, is spectacularly honest.  For this reason, I would recommend the film, with the caveat to ignore the portrayal of the church as ""evolving"" into modern social thinking.",1433721600,,400,5.138461538461539
5731170,3,B003G47HY4,"While not everybody in a convent is a saint, there are some, and many who do not have a secret past. This movie is heart warming, but not really
inspirational.",1432166400,,159,4.333333333333333
5731171,1,B003G47HY4,Not a movie that I liked at all.,1431043200,,32,3.125

5731173,4,B003G47HY4,Better plot and acting than I initially expected.,1430524800,,49,5.25
5731174,1,B003G47HY4,"This film tries to put every extraordinary situation in the religious life into one convent and one film. It's just too much and makes the convent something of a madhouse. Any one or even two of these adventures and situations could be found in a religious house but not all of them.
In fact, even the exterior events of brain tumor, suicide, friend carrying around a liquor bottle in the convent,  mother's death , baby adopted are just too much. The whole story is just over the top and lacks all verisimilitude.
Acting quite good..",1427414400,9,534,4.621052631578947
5731175,5,B003G47HY4,Excellent film from Poland. I understand why it was foreign film of the year at the Oscars. Bravo to this well done black and white film.,1426636800,,137,4.3076923076923075
5731176,3,B003G47HY4,I thought this movie showed some of the struggle found when trying to respond to Gods calling. The part I struggled with in the movie was the ending. It was not straight forward on what was going on. All you get are glimpses and then you have a struggle in your mind as to what is actually going on.,1426464000,,299,4.084745762711864
5731177,5,B003G47HY4,"It was really a good movie, very real, not what I expected at all, we are all still in the flesh until we reach glory whether a nun ,priest, or anyone else, no one has the market on holiness, we are saved by Grace through faith in the messiah, not through ascetic practices or separating ourselves from the world.",1426291200,,313,4.322033898305085
5731178,5,B003G47HY4,"The Calling is a beautiful film. The actors know their craft and the story is well written. It is a story of love and compassion. I watch is over and over. I simply love it, love it, love it.",1425859200,,191,3.923076923076923
8583611,5,B003G47HY4,"Great storyline. With real life events. The movie is nonstop. It has real life events from humor sad frustration anger confusion and etcetera to become a nun
Well worth watching!",1527033600,,178,4.966666666666667
8583612,1,B003G47HY4,"I liked the idea of the main character having a desire to seek God.  But this movie is not orthodox to the Catholic faith, uses the F word, has some brief sexual situations but no nudity, and seems to support the pro-choice position on abortion.  I don't recommend this movie, but if this movie is accurate of many orders it would help explain why people are not interested in joining Catholic religious orders.",1525046400,2,411,4.616438356164384
8583613,2,B003G47HY4,"This movie does a good job drawing you into it; however, it seeming condones and embraces several heretical teaching that the Catholic Church as a whole condemns. I found this movie did a disservice to the religious order of the Benedictines. I would get into details, however, I have already been disapproved for one review on this so I will end it at that.",1509926400,,358,4.609375

8583616,2,B003G47HY4,The plot was all over the place.  The climax was hurried up and stories were unresolved.,1484265600,,88,4.5
8583617,1,B003G47HY4,Started off cute and interesting but the agenda of the creators came through loud and clear. Every stereotype that is negative towards anything Catholic is used in this film. It is pretty much predictable. Disappointing because it really had some potential to explore the transcendent calling  of a person to explore the contemplative life for God in the modern world. The film just became a sounding board for liberal ideologies.,1481414400,4,430,5.142857142857143
8583618,2,B003G47HY4,"It's weird... it was enjoyable?  But I agree with everyone else, this was really kind of ridiculous (and I'm a buddhist atheist.)  Nearly everyone in the movie is an antagonist to this young girl trying to join the convent and fulfill her heartfelt desire for the experience of a deeper meaning and purpose in her life.  Usually in a movie you have 1, maybe 2 antagonists.  Not 10-15.  And the storyline of each of the antagonists was just utterly ridiculous - nun raping priests, promiscuous nuns, alcoholic nuns, rude nuns, venomous atheists.  It was just too much.

When you choose to watch a movie like this, you want a gentle movie that touches the heart with a little bit of someone's struggle toward a greater experience of life.  But I feel like I just left the audience of a Maury Povich episode.",1478131200,4,805,4.619718309859155
8583619,3,B003G47HY4,"I gave you something to think about, regarding the way we look a religious life. The script had too much going on, to go deep enough into some of the subject matter.",1475020800,,165,4.1875
8583620,1,B003G47HY4,This movie is insane its no wonder people think that religious life is a joke. This movie more the once goes against what the vocation there trying to portray. I don't even know where to start so all I am going to say that this movie is not at all catholic and if anyone thinks watching this will help with their discernment to religious life forget it. This is not what it means to be a nun or any religious for that matter do not watch this mockery of the catholic church/religious callings.,1471132800,2,493,4.311827956989247
