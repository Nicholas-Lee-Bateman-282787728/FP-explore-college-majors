8728666,3,B013S28ATO,"*I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest review

Ive always been intrigued by the Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde story.  Aside from being an interesting character study between refined society and bestial nature, the tale also shows the repercussions we face when impulse-control is denied.  As such, this story makes a great basis for just about any type of genre film, but especially horror.  So when I heard the fine folks at CAV Distribution were releasing HYDES SECRET NIGHTMARE, I jumped on the chance to check it out.  And while the film is not perfect, its still fun and worthy of watching.

Before I go any further, I need to post a warning:  this film contains graphic nudity and sex scenes, as well as disturbing and realistic gore.  This is an Adults Only film that boasts a XXX rating, so make sure you realize this before you watch.  If this doesnt bother you, then read on.

HYDES SECRET NIGHTMARE looks ok from a production standpoint, but the film quality leaves a lot to be desired in some places.  Most of it looks fine, however there are a few scenes that look as if they were shot with a VHS camcorder from the 80s.  Thankfully, these are few and far between, so it doesnt detract from the film too much.

The acting is pretty standard, and nobody really stands out from the cast.  Claudio Zanelli and Roberta Gemma portray the lead character(s), and both do a fine job.  Andrea Autullo gives a semi-humorous performance as Abdul, and veteran actor Venantino Venantini does a fine job as the barkeep.  Most of the performers are cast in bit parts, with very little screentime, so its hard to judge their portrayalsbut they all seem decent.

The special effects in HYDES SECRET NIGHTMARE are horrific in their realism.  Theres a few bashed-in heads and some other carnage, but what I found most cringeworthy are the penis-injection scenes.  When Henry decides to use the serum hes created, my stomach started hurting at the thought of what he was about to do.  But when the film shows him actually doing it, I almost had to walk away.  The scenes are that gruesome.  I commend the special effects team and their ability to create such memorable and haunting images.

The story in HYDES SECRET NIGHTMARE is very curious.  It is part horror, part mystery, part erotic, and part public-service announcement.  Yes, thats correctthe filmmakers throw in some PSAs and even some philosophical commentary.  I found this odd and yet refreshing at the same time.  The film is not so much preachy as it is informative, and this is a nice change of pace from some of the more in-your-face type of movies.

My biggest complaint about the film is its length.  It clocks in at over two hours long, however the editors should have shaved at least 30 minutes off of that.  This isn't enough to try and dissuade you from seeing the film, but I do have to make a mention of it.

Still, HYDES SECRET NIGHTMARE is entertaining and weird, an almost surrealistic trek into a modern-day dark fantasy.  If you can handle graphic sex depictions and hardcore gore, this is a movie youll want to check out.  It is available now.",1446681600,5,3137,4.625
