6244689,2,B00I01PGNC,"This movie was a bit of a disappointment.  We weren't expecting a complex plot, but we had expectations in terms of acting.  Instead, the cast was really mediocre as the actors, both young and adult, seemed almost to read from their scripted parts.  At one point, we thought the dog was also reading the script...The best actor was the wild bear.",1395273600,2,346,4.639344262295082
6244690,2,B00I01PGNC,"We always try to find family-friendly movies for our kids. That usually means watching movies that are made by small studios with smaller budgets. So we've come to expect that some of the movies will have lesser-known actors and less production value. But many of those movies make up for it by having a good story. This movie was just dumb. Very dumb. We watched the whole thing, but my kids started playing on their tablet after about 5 minutes.",1395273600,,447,4.6

6244693,3,B00I01PGNC,"Family adventure, survival tale from mostly kid's point of view with nice outdoor shots, cute actor bear and dog.

The storyline(if you want to know): Brother and sister with their 'Husky' dog, Chinook, have to survive the elements after their floatplane crashes.  The pilot is knocked unconscious, so the youngsters head out to get help facing raging river, wolves, bear, and a firestorm.  Their parents, including Natasha Henstridge, frantically search with rescue group to find them; however, the focus is on the kids and especially the dog.

Nice outdoor shots, the children actors do a good job, and the animals kept our children mostly interested.  They present the story from the kid's perspective, having to make the decisons, e.g., ""What should we do next?"", ""Stay here and help the pilot or go for help?"".  The animal shots are obviously set-up- well-trained, nicely cleaned up bear growling and chasing after them.  The handsome Husky is the star, warning the kids, chasing off the predators, and pretty much saving the day, some time in slow motion, in each scene.

PG, Dove approved, pretty much ok for the whole family; although, there are some moderately stressful scenes with the plane crash and less so with the threatening animals.  Our 7 & 10 year olds were not bothered in the least because all turns out well and no animals are hurt.  A bit slow for us adults.",1394928000,,1381,4.888412017167382

6244733,2,B00I01PGNC,"Against the Wild is watchable but it's also forgettable. It's basically a kid survival tale where realism is thrown out the door because it simply would be harder to write and film and probably cost more money to make. Even flying in the plane at the start of the film clearly looked like a green screen was in the background. A film where kids show courage, as does their dog, with parents who never give up even though the highly trained and experienced search team does. I really don't like how the only way to make characters look better is to make professionals look stupid, yet it is the mother who comes up with the idea hey you know we should look in between the plane wreckage and the camp where the kids' dad worked. You know that's a really good idea says the search leader. You're shaking you're head at this point as you do constantly throughout the film. Although not as much as when the boy keeps dropping fish that aren't even moving.

The movie is also very badly made script wise and none of the animals look like they've spent a second in the dirt making you wonder and feel so sad for them as you watch the film knowing their lives have been spent in cement cages and only getting fed when they do their trick right to make the movie.

A lot of spoilers here so if you don't want to know and plan on watching maybe stop reading now - A scene with a bear pretending to have a soar foot and limping on its other three legs while looking back (likely at its trainer) after a fake leg is put in the dog's mouth is really disturbing to watch. How many hours of mental torture did this animal have to undergo to learn this trick and get it right? The dog and bear never appear in the same camera shot. The two kids and their dog after being in a plane crash that supposedly left their pilot unconscious also after spending multiple days in the woods always looked freshly groomed in clean clothes the whole time. They don't even get bed hair after sleeping rough. Bugs also show no interest in them. The fact the girl at one stage hurts her leg and needs to be dragged by the dog is just forgotten about after a while and she walks fine after that. They never seem to have had to come up with what leaves to use for toilet paper or any other decisions of survival. The search light from the helicopter on their first night is constantly on the two kids yet the searchers don't see them. Surely the script could have had them chasing the light and never getting in it or something better and more realistic. Even though these kids are very photogenic, and heaps of volunteers have come to look for the kids, meaning the word is out there, the media never shows up to cover the search.

A fire that deters searchers from going on and threatens the kids mysteriously disappears when the boy somehow ends up halfway down a cliff face hanging onto a ledge. How this implausible situation for him happened is not shown. A pack of hungry wolves run off when a domestic dog lightly growls without even clashing together at least once. Later in the film somehow these wolves familiar with environment can't catch that dog or jump a ravine it can. Obviously a stolen golf buggy type vehicle can also later make this jump that these wolves can't.

Supposedly these raised right kids left the common sense lesson you always hear to stay with the wreckage to get help for their pilot, yet when their parents turn up they don't even mention him let alone tell them he needs help.",1407888000,,3479,4.3724884080370945
6244734,1,B00I01PGNC,Reminded me of a very poorly made Hallmark show.,1407801600,2,48,4.444444444444445
6244735,1,B00I01PGNC,"Overall the story is fine, however...The acting was so bad, you were cheering for the wrong side.  You wanted the kids to just die off and take their parents with them.  People were trying to help them and the parents were rude and in real life, would have been told to get lost a long time ago.  The parents mock eachother in front of the kids, you can't tell which child is older, and even the dog doesn't bark well.  The girl looks older but acts younger.  Animals just run away after looking at the dog.  It looks bad and fake.  Basically the acting killed the film.  Children might like it, but adults will not.",1400544000,5,616,4.2956521739130435

6244737,4,B00I01PGNC,Decent film with really nothing objectionable.  Our family really enjoyed it. Reminded me of the old Disney films when I was a kid.,1398816000,3,131,4.695652173913044
6244738,2,B00I01PGNC,"Long story short I originally wrote a more strongly negative review.  Upon discussion, I am going to in rare form edit my review:

This movie wasn't for me.  I had problems with the strength of the story line.  I admittedly do not know a lot about how Canada operates its missing persons cases.  One of the main characters I had a problem with was the ranger.  He all but gives up before a day passes by when looking for two small children.  It is also confirmed they survived the crash and he tries to pull his search teams from the woods .

I also thought the parents acting left a lot to be desired and parts of the childrens acting.  Overall I would give 2.5 stars.",1397952000,,669,4.246031746031746
6244739,3,B00I01PGNC,"I saw this movie on demand, and first off what's annoying about movies is how it seems like all live action movies nowadays always have to at least be rated PG.  There was nothing really PG about this film, except maybe the plane crash or a scene where Hannah mentions to Zach that it's the breeding season for the salmon, but those scenes seem G appropriate.  The movie does not have any bad words and despite kids in the middle of nowhere for 2 days, there is not one mention of them having to pee, peeing in the woods.  So, this movie is completely child friendly.
A couple of other things to mention about this movie, when I go camping I normally think about how dirty I'll get.  These kids in the movie walking around 2 days were never that dirty.  Only towards the end of the movie were their clothes a little dirty.  Their hair also was always looking straight, making it unrealistic.
There also isn't that much action in the movie.  There are a few action scenes, but they mostly aren't long and not a lot to make a very entertaining movie.
However, what I liked about this movie.  It's nice to see scenes of nature in movies, it might make you almost feel like you're out there.  I liked how the main characters in this movie are brother and sister.  You could tell they get along, and especially care for each other during their adventure.  Hannah was the one that seemed to get annoyed more, Zach seemed more laid back and he used his survival camping skills to good use when they ended up in that situation.  It's nice seeing the survival skills and adventures kids had, so even though the movie was a little slow, it kept me entertained.  However, one more thing to criticize about the film is the ending.  The movie ending was too quick, I was expecting a better ending.
I'll give this movie 3 stars, it's not like a movie I'd watch again.  Maybe one more time.  It can entertain you a little for one time, but you'll notice how much the movie with a plot like this is missing to have made it a little better. This might be a good movie for your kids if they're in scouts and talking about wilderness survival.",1397865600,2,2124,4.366412213740458
6244740,5,B00I01PGNC,I so much enjoyed watching this with my grandkids.. More of these family movies need to be made.. Other negative comments are do to lack of age.. I'd highly recommend this..Thank you,1396569600,2,182,4.71875
6244741,2,B00I01PGNC,Very cute story line. Would have to say that the best acting done in this movie was by the animals though. Could have stood to have better actors.,1396224000,,146,4.25
6244742,2,B00I01PGNC,"I give one star each for my boys who said it was okay. My wife and I thought it was terrible. One of those movies that is so bad you actually laugh. It is hard to find family movies these days (ones we haven't seen). The acting was not very good, the plot was predictable, and the cinematography was so-so. I realize it was a low budget film but just not for us.",1395964800,,362,3.9726027397260273

6244744,2,B00I01PGNC,"Dad (Ted Whittall) works at a remote mine. Family doesn't see him that often. Mom (Natasha Henstridge) and dad are separated. Kids fly up in plane to visit dad. CG planes catches fire and crashes with token black guy pilot (Rainbow Francks) injured and unconscious. Kids with random blood marks and uninjured dog go for help. Zach (CJ Adams) uses his Cub Scout survivor skills to save his sister Hannah (Erin Pitt) as they do some sibling bonding.

One would think they would conduct an air search which would easily locate the plane along its 2 hour flight path or at least see the smoke from all the campfires the kids start. The film was boring. Kids discuss if their fighting is causing their parents to split up while wolves circle round. (A dog is no match for a wolf.) The film was overly formulaic. It has a made for TV feel and sound track. Very lame for adults.

Might work for the younger crowd.",1395532800,3,906,4.484848484848484
