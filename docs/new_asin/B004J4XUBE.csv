4390545,2,B004J4XUBE,"If you've been acting for a while, you probably have already considered most of these suggestions. This ""method"" was nothing new to me and I was disappointed. Perhaps if you are really new, you'll get something helpful here.",1381017600,2,224,4.921052631578948
4390546,5,B004J4XUBE,I'm impressed. Great process. Just watched it through for the first time--these guys know what they're talking about! Looking forward to using it!,1376870400,,146,5.391304347826087
4390547,5,B004J4XUBE,"This is creative, fun, great new approach for me to learning lines.
I've been struggling with memorizing for years. 3 months ago I began an aggressive search for ways to make this easier on myself since I have to memorize weekly for commercials, auditions, and shoots.
I was skeptical at first, but easily willing to spend $20 to give it a try.
I am completely impressed.

You watch through the video first, about an hour long.
The hosts explain and demonstrate the techniques using NY actors (im in LA).
It's a lower budget production, as you would expect, but this didn't bother me at all... and its actually much better than what I was expecting production value wise.
I took notes using a mind map on my iPad, and after watching through once, I had a grasp of the exercises.
When using them for the first time, I had questions, and referred to their website which answered my questions so that I didn't have to watch through the video again to find the answers.
The exercises are structured in a way that is better to do all of them rather than to pick and choose, which was great for my ADD mind to use the structure.

I have memorized a monologue and a scene using the exercises. There's a website with FAQ that I've found handy as I've been learning the process. mocksides.com
I had a shoot yesterday, and after going through the techniques once for about 20 minutes (lots of back and forth, but not heavy dialogue), I had my 5 page scene memorized. More importantly, after I learned them this way I was confident and relaxed about the lines in a way I haven't been in years. I also found it easy to improvise additional dialogue on set without being locked into a pattern or routine of lines.

Bottom line, it works for me. It's a really fun and creative process, the exercises (some of which seemed silly at first) actually give additional insight into the scene and creative choices. At $20 I find this the cheapest and most effective tool I've added to my film and tv arsenal in a long time. I realize the exercises may not work for everyone, but for me they've been great.

4390548,5,B004J4XUBE,"This technique works!  It takes me less than a half hour to memorize a 3 page scene with amazing recall.  You not only memorize your lines, you unconsciously extract the truth of what you are working on.",1366848000,4,203,4.45945945945946
4390549,5,B004J4XUBE,WAtched the video once already and found it very interesting. Would purchase more products like this to help me in my acting experiences.,1342828800,4,137,5.0
8431654,3,B004J4XUBE,"This method may well be worth a try for you, though I didn't find anything ""magical"" about it.

The method described in the video is pretty much repetition with a few twists that *may* assist you in learning your lines. As others have said in reviews, there is nothing truly ""new"" here, and you may well already know these methods and/or can find them easily on YouTube.

I would go a step further to say that this method may be better-suited to learning a 30-second or one minute advertising script than it would be a full-length play or movie script. I think it's also fair to say that a method that is ""fast"" will not have good long-lasting results, and you may find that what you ""learned"" in 30 minutes yesterday is 90% forgotten by tomorrow.

Others may get more out of this method than I did, so it may be worth the $20 for some folks. Personally, I would not recommend this DVD to another actor or any actors being cast in a play I was directing.",1510704000,2,954,4.348314606741573

8431660,3,B004J4XUBE,I ordered this? Probably ended up under something in my apt. Not a good sign. I have a vague memory of learning something potentially valuable.,1423180800,,143,4.76
8431661,3,B004J4XUBE,Item was OK.  I needed a quick lesson because I was to be in a play.  I think the DVD was more toward being in a commercial.,1413936000,,124,3.5555555555555554
8431662,5,B004J4XUBE,"Good practical steps to improve memorization.  Tried it, and even after only one try I could see the difference.  I am going back now to practicer, practice practice.",1411776000,,166,4.892857142857143
8431663,5,B004J4XUBE,"My wife and I have both really benefited from this DVD!  As actors the biggest hurdle when you find out that you have an audition with three monologues the next day is getting into character, and that is hard to do if you're stuck on the lines.  The method is kind of a head scratcher to me.  It doesn't seem like it should work, I mean, it's a series of exercises that by when done by itself just feels like that.  An exercise, but done in sequence we really did learn these lines.  RECOMMEND!!",1405555200,3,495,4.223404255319149
