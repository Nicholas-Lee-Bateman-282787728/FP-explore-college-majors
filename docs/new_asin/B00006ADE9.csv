7966364,5,B00006ADE9,"If you enjoyed the first 3 movies, here are the next 3. The last 2 are the ones the Up All Night never showed, so they made for a good first time showing. Still just as funny and politically incorrect as the others.",1412985600,2,215,4.023255813953488
7966365,4,B00006ADE9,"If your a big 90's comedy fan of high school/college/beach movies, then check this one out!  The vice academy movies are basically a combo of Police Academy and Charlie's Angels, except much sluttier and with a low-budget, but this is what makes it great. Part 4 and 5 are the best of the series, but Part 6 simply overstayed it's welcome. I highly recommend getting Volume 1 as Part 1 and 2 are even better. These movies are entertaining and funny! :)",1370476800,3,452,4.512195121951219
