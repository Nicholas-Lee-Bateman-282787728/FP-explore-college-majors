366564,5,6301798643,"This movie is an excellent remake of the Jack Benny movie of the same name. Mel Brooks is very funny (as usual) in this movie. However, just about every actor comes close to stealing the show - especially Anne Bancroft. The Mel Brooks lunacy takes a back seat to the storytelling. The director proves that he knows when the story is just as entertaining as the punch lines and gags. Similar to Young Frankenstein, the actors play their roles ""seriously"" and the dialogue and situations showcase the humor.
In addition, just as a good drama has a touch of humor, this comedy has a little drama. That is one of the elements that make this one of my very favorite Mel Brooks films.",1132963200,8,678,4.520325203252033
366565,4,6301798643,"This film is a combination of laughter and good drama.  We need more artists like these who can see the good - even in the midst of difficulty.  I've been looking all over town for this movie, and I would heartily recommend it.  If you're not a Mel Brooks fan, this is a different kind of comedy than he usually does - and with spectacular results.",1132963200,5,348,4.242424242424242
366566,5,6301798643,I love this film and would be first in line to buy it on DVD. Only Mel Brooks could have pulled this off so brilliantly; it remains one his best comedies. I'll keep hoping to own it one day.,1123027200,,190,3.8974358974358974
366567,5,6301798643,"I love this movie I thing it is Mel Brook's best comedy. It is such a shame that the studio haven't released it in DVD format. Maybe in the near future as a tribute to Ms. Bancroft.

Or it would be cooler if it were released in a double pack along with the Producers.",1119484800,,267,3.9444444444444446
366568,5,6301798643,"This is one of the funniest and most clever films Mel Brooks has ever made. The late Anne Bancroft was so beautiful, glamourous, and hilarious as first lady of the polish stage Anna Bronski. Mr. & Mrs. Brooks work so well together it's a shame they never starred together in another film. Excellent supporting cast including Oscar Nominee (for his role in this film) Charles Durning. Look closely in the scene where Bancroft and Durning's characters first meet, Durning moves to sit on the edge of the desk and misses, you can clearly see Bancroft has trouble keeping a straight face. The outtakes must be equally as funny as the movie itself! The outtakes could be a great bonus feature however, they're not available on the DVD. The bonus features included are a behind the scenes featurette from 1982 as well as the original theatrical trailer and other trailers from Mel Brooks' films now available on DVD from FOX. I owned the VHS tape for years and viewed it regularly plus I watch it everytime it's on TV! I so happy to have this film on DVD looking so clear and in widescreen. I can now retire my well worn VHS tape! Also of interest, the 1942 Jack Benny & Carole Lombard film of the same name is on DVD from Warner Bros. Although, I prefer the Mel Brooks version better! Enjoy!",1118188800,,1286,4.547413793103448
366569,4,6301798643,"This is, for me, the best of the Brooks films.  How often does one enjoy a re-make as well as the original?  Jack Benny and Carol Lombard are wonderful in the 1942 original, a must-see, but I love this version just as much - Jos Ferrer steals the show along with a host of great modern character actors.  This is a more refined, less raw Mel Brooks comedy, with a wonderful homage to the original.  Charles Durning is fabulous as well as the entire well-cast cast.  I have been patiently waiting to replace my VHS with a DVD version.  Hello?  How much longer do I have to wait?",1105920000,18,577,4.287037037037037
366570,4,6301798643,"Mel Brooks is off again, this time taking us to Poland as it is invaded by the Nazis.  Even the title makes fun of an earlier spy movie produced during world war two.
The cast is brilliant, spearheaded by Mel Brooks himself.  Its pretty much a roll call of 1970's comedy and is just brusting with Brooks's usual silliness(silliness is used in a good contex here)
My impression-Great movie, but at times doesn't measure up to some of Brook's other films.",1052956800,2,453,4.580246913580247
366571,4,6301798643,"When I see the name Mel Brooks on a film title, I think bawdy gags, double-entendres and a bathroom-humor punchline. (But that's me!) This movie was a pleasant change from the usual Brooks offerings with crisp dramatic direction, a good dramatic cast (Ann Bancroft was perfect as the wife with a wandering eye) and a bitter sweet plot. Watching Mel Brooks interact with some accomplished actors, you realize the depth of his talent - he holds his own very well and has a strong screen presence. Although this is a remake of a wonderful 1942 Jack Benny film, Brooks does a great job updating the script for today's audiences. It's not Young Frankenstein or even High Anxiety but it is a nice little movie that any Brooks fan will thoroughly enjoy. As an aside, I think Mel must lay awake at night thinking of ways to poke fun at Nazis in general and Hitler in particular (think Producers, Blazing Saddles...). He does it so well, I hope he never stops.",1040860800,47,951,4.6
366572,5,6301798643,"Okay, this movie is HILARIOUS! Alot better than most of the commidies the movie-people have been turning out lately.  It isn't as crude as many of Mel Brooks movies, and that helps alot.  The humor is the good solid kind that will leave you smiling after the movie is finished.",1012262400,4,277,4.52
366573,4,6301798643,"Mel Brooks' remake of TO BE OR NOT TO BE doesn't improve on the Ernst Lubitsch classic, but it's a very enjoyable film in it's own right.  Perhaps wisely, the script follows the 1942 original very closely, but the  comedy is broader this time and the thriller aspect lessened. Brooks and  Anne Bancroft play stars of a Warsaw theatrical troupe in 1939 (A highlight  is their duet of ""Sweet Georgia Brown,"" sung in Polish).  When  Bancroft discovers she is the object of a pilot's affections, it begins a  chain of events that has the troupe working to save the underground  movement after Hitler invades Poland. Brooks gives one of his very best  performances as an actor who uses his skills to outwit the Nazis, while  worrying whether or not his wife is having an affair.  Bancroft matches him  every step of the way, and comes closer than anyone in the cast to  achieving ""the Lubitsch touch.""  Charles Durning is also a  standout as the notorious ""Concentration Camp Ehrhardt.""While  this film is well worth watching, I also STRONGLY recommend the original  Lombard-Benny classic, if you've never seen it.  But you won't hear Jack  Benny and Carole Lombard sing ""Sweet Georgia Brown"" in Polish!",944524800,26,1198,4.841584158415841

366732,2,6301798643,"I'm not a Mel Brooks fan. This movie, To Be Or Not To Be, does not alter my view that Brooks' comical skills are vastly overrated. There is a fine line between a funny spoof and plain silliness. Brooks' method typically lands the scenes in the second category. There were very few occasions where the goings on made me crack a smile, and a lot more where I just groaned. The busload of famous stars making an appearance did not manage to save the show. If anything, the virus of bad acting that plagues Brooks seems to have spread to many of the celebrities as well.",1471564800,,566,4.349056603773585

366767,4,6301798643,"It's 1939, Warsaw, Poland. The bombastic Frederick Bronski's theater has a new extravaganza, ""The New Bronski Follies.""  For a couple hours, the audience can forget that their city and country have been overrun by the Nazis. The show has it all, comedy, singing, dancing and flashy costumes. And the still beautiful but past-her-prime star, Anne Bronski, Frederick's wife.

But apparently not TOO past her prime, because during intermissions, she's been getting huge bouquets of yellow roses. The last has a card, ""I must see you, Lieutenant Andre Sobinski."" Frederick would be on his way to being seriously jealous except there's something else to worry about. Dr. Boyarski, of the foreign office, accompanied by German soldiers, has shut down the show. Something about Frederick's impersonation of the Fuhrer being ""a direct insult.""

How the Bronskis get involved with espionage is a total farce with some laugh-out-loud moments. Underneath it, though, is serious commentary, such as saving someone with a pink triangle. Anne Bancroft is really lovely in her turn as Anne Bronski. She and Mel Brooks were happily married from 1964 to 2005, when she died of cancer. I get a kick out of the photo I've attached. It replicates the days when cinematographers filmed their stars through gauze to soften their features.

""To Be Or Not to Be"" was issued in 1983, the 8th movie Mel Brooks directed for Hollywood. He directed twelve films in all, acting in all but one of them. Eight of his movies, including ""To Be or Not to Be"" are collected in a slipcase in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mel-Brooks-Bx-Sm-Cb/dp/B000EBIONA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mel Brooks Bx Sm Cb</a>

The threat of Nazi invasion on the horizon does not deter a group of performers at a theater in Poland from doing their thing each night.

It's more along the lines of The Producers. If you liked The Producers then you'll like this. Even though this is a remake of an old Jack Benny movie, Mel Brooks puts his own spin on it and makes it funny and enjoyable. Anne Bancroft is just wonderful as Mel's straying wife.

It seems overlooked and is surprisingly not written or directed by Mel but feels very much so. The chemistry between Mel and Ann Bancroft is unparalleled for a real life couple on screen. It's got an 80's over the top comedy feel at times but it's charming to the end and the ensemble feels like a cast that has toured together forever.,1456531200,,471,4.619047619047619

This is a copy of the 1942 movie of the same name with a slightly different plot. Is it good taste to make a comedy about life in Nazi-occupied Poland? The 1942 movie at least had the excuse of ignorance about the real purpose of the relocation program. There is a list of resistance fighters that has fallen into the hands of a Gestapo agent. Can it be retrieved before the persons on that list are arrested? Can something go wrong with their plan to retrieve it?

There is shooting in an empty theater. Can an imposter replace a Nazi professor? Only if he is a good actor. Will Vronsky give the greatest performance of his life? A performance is stopped when Sasha is arrested on stage. Later they find a body in a trunk in the middle of a road! [Plausible?] Will an imposter be uncovered? Dont move! [This may be funny if you know little about the history of that era or can forget about it.] That night they put on a show for Adolf and other Nazis. There are skits. Funny or not? Can they escape in an airplane? Were on our way!

Where will they land without a compass? Will the show go on? Yes, there is a happy ending (for some). There are more realistic movies about this era, they don't have singing and dancing. For a real history read a book.",1422144000,,1283,4.228571428571429

This movie also is the ONLY time that Mel decided to have his wife take on a role in one of his movies.  Anne Bancroft [may she rest in peace] gives a strong performance as the wife of the owner of the theatrical troupe [Brooks].

Jack Benny plays the role much better than Mel Brooks.  It has neither the humor nor the suspense of the earlier film.  The story is not as detailed nor well-developed.  In fact, if one weren't familiar enough with the Jack Benny-Carole Lombard film to fill in the gaps, the Mel Brooks version would leave one cold.

367180,5,6301798643,"This is a movie which has quickly become one of my favorite Mel Brooks comedies. A remake of the 1942 classic starring Jack Benny & Carole Lombard, ""To Be Or Not To Be"" is a sparkling production starring Brooks & his late great wife, the wonderful Anne Bancroft, in the title roles of the Bronskis. Running a popular theatre troupe in 1939 Poland, their idyllic existence is shattered by the Nazi invasion. It's ultimately up to the troupe to outsmart the Nazis & flee Poland for sanctuary in England. Brooks has gotten a lot of comic mileage out of making fun of the Nazis (especially here, with the ""Naughty Nazis"" sketch, and the somewhat bumbling officers put in charge). But the film also has flashes of the grim realities of war as they stand by helplessly & watch the German soldiers take over their quarters & their beloved theatre...even later nearly sending Bancroft's gay dresser to a concentration camp.
Brooks passed on directing this one (he took a critical drubbing for the recent ""History of the World"" comedy), but does produce it. And the cast is terrific: Tim Matheson as a handsome young soldier flirting backstage with Bancroft; Charles Durning delivering an Oscar-nominated comic performance as a loud-mouthed boob of a Nazi colonel; Jose Ferrer is perfection as a shifty-eyed traitor working for Hitler; and Christopher Lloyd submerging himself (as usual) in the role of an unflinching Nazi subcommander. Not to mention many dead-on supporting performances from the Bronski troupe. There's many terrific comic moments to relish here. Brooks' character is usually one step behind the plot, and he's fun to watch as his head spins around. The glamorous Bancroft tosses out juicy one-liners as if they were bon-bons.

367182,4,6301798643,"TO BE OR NOT TO BE is classic Mel Brooks with a few jabs at political commentary as only Mel Brooks can do!

It's fun and magical with even a running Shakespearian joke and a musical duet that cracks a lod laugh when you realize what there singing about.

Hilter, Gays in the Military, Circus Acts, Theatre, Life in the 40's and many more genre's were directly satired.

This was the last performance with his wife Ann Bancroft as his leading lady and their chemistry was amazingly electric. (She did appear with her husband again in a small part in Dracula: Dead and Loving It.) A film not as well received - but it was good to see them together again.

Other cast members who gave tremendous performances included Tim Matheson, Christopher Lloyd (Back To The Future)  and the always amazing Charles Durning (Mrs. Santa Claus, Best Little Whorehouse In Texas.

Director Alana Johnson was going for a ensemble piece, but with key cast like Mel, Anne, Charles and Timothy it's hard to let everyone shine all the time.

Overall - I found this ovie extremely funny and inventive, however, just a little bit slow in the middle. Id on't know if kids will find the humor as entertaining as the adults - but it is definately Mel Brooks. 3-26-09",1238025600,,1237,4.595454545454546

A great performance from the late Ann Bancroft also;  playing alongside her husband in a comedy role lets you see her in a different light.

367218,5,6301798643,"Mrs. Robinson has grown up and turned to comedy.  Anne Bancroft (Mrs. Mel Brooks) is an outstanding comedienne.  Don't let the beginning put you off-stick with it.  And Best Supporting Actor Oscar winner Charles Durning.  Mel for once in a STARRING role, although George Gaynes steals the show (Police Academy commandant Lazard).  Wonderful musical, treats a serious subject with extreme slapstick and zaniness.  Almost a visual political cartoon--dancing, singing, romance, mystery, spies, Nazis, Jews in hiding, clowns.  Must see--must collect.",1207353600,,546,5.75
367219,4,6301798643,"This is a slightly more serious side of Mel, which is to say, madly funny; and I found it absolutely hilarious.  Taking on a suspenseful WWII drama in Poland, probably the last thing you think of is slapstick.  The comedy had its perhaps poignantly cheesy moments, which are the only detractors in the entire film, and I'm sure most viewers will recognize them, and yet also has some classic, mad hilarity.

Having not seen the original, I think I will have to now.  Mel is surely one of the greatest American comedians, and I also agree with other reviewers here that he displays his acting skills more strongly than in other films.  There is, BTW, no raunchy humor here, and some of the best slapstick I've seen for a while.  From the first moment, Mel and the stunning Anne Bancroft as well as all supporting roles are well done and tasteful.  Any references to or portrayal of homosexuality are well done and not lewd or offensive.

Because as you may well know, Bronski, played by Brooks, is a director determined to rescue family and friends from his theatre from certain death in the Nazi occupation, and at one point says, ""without Jews, gypsies and qu66rs, there would be no theatre. [paraphrased, but very close]""  I imagine this film is the inspiration of the 90s synth-pop band choosing the name ""Bronski Beat."" In this film one of Bronski's gay employees is forced to wear the imfamous pink triangle, and it is remarkable that Mel should portray that historical fact in this film.

But that is just a side-note, as the film is larger than that one issue, and Mel's taking on such a serious drama armed with slapstick, and one absolutely gorgeous co-star, is testimony to the power of humor, (And Anne's beauty) to redeem and enliven, and help us through moments too grim to bear otherwise.  And because of that I'd recommend this film strongly.  Mel is the man.",1186358400,3,1874,4.6626139817629175

367221,5,6301798643,"To Be or Not To Be is not one of the more well-known Mel Brooks films, but is rip-roaring slightly naughty fun. It sets itself apart from other Mel Brooks films by having a superb, well- structured plot with even some serious social commentary.

Mel plays the lead role and opposite the stunning Anne Bancroft, his real-life wife. Their personalities add a real acting chemistry to the film.

Charles Durning got an academy award nomination as best supporting actor for his role as the Gestapo commander.

I really like the ""Naughty Nazis"" number - hysterical.",1168300800,3,560,4.873684210526315
367222,5,6301798643,"My children, now ages 12 and 9, have loved this film for the last six years, since the day we allowed them to watch it.  The Nazis are not the bumbling dimwits of ""Hogan's Heroes,"" but they are not quite as smart as Mel Brooks's Fredric Bronski.  The characters are enjoyable and ultimately lovable: Brooks as the self-absorbed and not-quite-successful head of a rag-tag Polish vaudeville troupe; Anne Bancroft as his aging but flirtatious (and much better received) performing wife, and a wonderful ensemble cast to support each other.  There is adventure, excitement, subtle and highbrow comedy, and as one might expect from Mel Brooks, victory over the Nazis.  The theatre troupe is ultimately successful in its mission to stop a traitorous Polish spy, but when Brooks disguises himself as the spy to complete the mission, the movie really takes off.  There is some sexual innuendo, as well as some slang references to homosexuals, so parents: be cautious.  But as an introduction to Brooks, as a glimpse into the Nazi preoccupation with the conquering of Europe and the Final Solution, it is a winner.",1154736000,8,1105,4.978260869565218
