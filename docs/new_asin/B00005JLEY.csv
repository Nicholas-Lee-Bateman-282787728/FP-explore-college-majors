1448878,5,B00005JLEY,"I've only seen a few episodes of Miami Vice, but I know that I want to see more! It's a fun show and interestingly reflective of the 80's. I was too young to experience the show when it was first out, and I missed it on TNN since I only get broadcast channels. I'd love to see it come out on DVD in a box set and would buy it ASAP. Don Johnson was great in Nash Bridges, and I'd like to see more of his earlier career. Fight for all five seasons of Miami Vice to be released on DVD!",1054166400,11,482,3.782178217821782
1448879,5,B00005JLEY,"Ohhhhh Please release in DVD! This show was so phenominal when it was on TV... the music, the color, the characters, the CLOTHES. I remember my friday nights were so special just because I knew MV was going to be on. The first night it aired on TV, I was speechless after watching it. I was like ""What the heck was that?, I want more!!!!!""
Please release!!!!!!",1053561600,4,360,4.388059701492537
1448880,5,B00005JLEY,"i love this show. i wish it whould come out on dvd because i really miss it. i whould buy copies for my friends and family because they whould really enjoy it.it has everything a show needs humor,action,dramma,and fast cars.",1050105600,2,224,4.625
1448881,4,B00005JLEY,"I was a big fan of miami vice during it's release in the 80's. It's great to see it on dvd but it's such a shame that the episodes are not in order on the dvd release. I wish they would also bring out the rest of series so I can collect the lot.
Miami vice is still as good as it seemed in the 80's cool music, fast cars and wow! Don Johnson yea, He's still very tastey.",1041724800,5,370,3.6962025316455698
1448882,5,B00005JLEY,"I grew up with Miami Vice on it's initial run here on the BBC in England. It's combination of music, photography and locations made such a strong impact on me, even to this day. I have all the episodes on VHS but am desperate to get them on dvd, if only the first 2 seasons which were the best.
I have recently contacted UNIVERSAL PLAYBACK in the UK, and they told me that they are trying to put together a season one release, but that it was proving difficult to gain the rights to include all the original music from so many artists in each episode. I was told that it would be a year at the earliest, so let's keep our fingers crossed.
Miami Vice was a groundbreaking show, and I advise anyone who ever watched it to get the DVD should it be released.",1036713600,39,754,4.171232876712328
1448883,5,B00005JLEY,"I found it interesting that Jan Hammer would release the Complete Collection for the soundtrack before the studio not officially releasing Vice on DVD. Let's see, the feature film should begin preliminary stages soon, Don Johnson continues to be hot with Nash Bridges, the new CD is hot.",1036627200,5,287,5.0
1448884,5,B00005JLEY,"Michael Mann's ""Heat"" is my favorite movie, therefore it should be no surprise that his ""Miami Vice"" is my favorite T.V. show. The show is more stylish and swanky than any other ever made, with its assorment to fast cars, fast women, pastel suits, cocaine, guns, 80's music and of course, Crockett and Tubbs! I'm a big fan of of the crime genre, and I also watch ""NYPD Blue"", ""Law and Order"", ""The Shield"" and others, but this is my favorite, despite the fact that its least realistic when it comes to how the criminal justice system works. However, the sheet ""coolness"" (for lack of a better word) more than makes up for it. However, im not writing this just to inform readers on the show. I'm hoping that some DVD producers will read this and get up off their butts and release the show on DVD, hopefully each complete season. Seeing as how this was the ""CSI"" of the 80's (and maintained its popularity for years), there is obviously a huge market in potential DVD collectors who watched the show. The demand for it will leap through the ceiling in a few short days when ""Grand Theft Auto: Vice City"" is released. Also, attention TNN: What the hell are you guys doing? You show idiotic shows like ""VIP"" 10 times a day but cut off Miami Vice? C'mon! Get it back on the air already! Maybe you guys and Rockstar games can scratch eachothers backs or something.",1035590400,7,1359,4.483870967741935
1448885,5,B00005JLEY,"Ah Miami Vice.. As a young boy I used to watch the show weekly when the BBC was running it back at the tail end of the eighties.
Now as a nostlagic 20 year old I can't wait for a full season DVD release. The show has everything you could  want,Ferrari's,speed boats, guns, beautiful women, eighties music, white suits etc. The first season was a strong one with some great episodes. The pilot episode was brilliant and the chemistry between Don Johnson and Philip Michael Thomas was there for all to see.""Hit list"" and ""Calderon's Demise"" was a fantastic two parter which saw Crockett and Tubbs sail off to the Bahamas to nail drug kingpin Calderon.""No Exit"" saw the debut of some actor called Bruce Willis. Other classic season 1 episodes include ""Smugglers Blues"" ""Evan"" and ""The Maze"". A wish list of extras would include archive interviews with the cast and crew,Music videos for Jan Hammer's hit single ""Miami Vice Theme"" Phil Collin's ""In the air tonight"" Tina Turners ""What's love got to do with it"" and Glenn Frey's ""Smugglers Blues"". Featurette's on the shows music and fashion and new interviews with the likes of Don Johnson,Philip Michael Thomas,Edward James Olmos and Michael Mann on there thoughts about the shows success.
If Universal listen to the fans they could make the ""Miami Vice"" series one of THE Television dvd sets that everyone would want to own. It would be a success, C'mon Universal make us fans happy...",1025049600,6,1433,4.801619433198381
1448996,5,B00005JLEY,"The show is still finding it's formula in this season, but this makes it all the more interesting and the more worthwhile purchase.  There's more growth in the characters here, as well as in the styling/execution of the show.  This makes Season 1 so good; I also recommend Season 2.  Unlike many other shows, Season 1 came right out of the gate knowing what worked and consistently delivers good stories, guest stars, music, characters and locations.
For me, Miami Vice is a show that I love to have on: whether I'm closely or sparingly watching.  If you like 80s pop music, 80s Miami, people sweating, some humor, cops in the underworld, explosions and gun fire...search no more!",1504569600,2,680,4.786324786324786

1449154,5,B00005JLEY,"When the first episode of Miami Vice aired in September 1984, few people were probably prepared to anticipate the kind of cultural phenomenon that this show became in the mid-1980s. It started out as a humble two-hour pilot with virtually unknown lead actors, in a run-down American city that had long seen its heyday, and buried in a deadly 10PM Friday night timeslot. But from the start, it packed a punch, it was different from anything that was on televison back then. It was bold, it was brash, it was glittering and fancy, it was ""in your face"". It was culturally relevant. Even the earliest episodes felt more like 48-minute feature films, and had the production budget to boot.

With acclaimed executive producer Michael Mann at the helm and a team of hand-picked writers, episode directors, casting agents and costume designers, little could go wrong. And nothing did. By the summer of 1985, Miami Vice had morphed from being just another new cop show to the hottest new thing on television. And even if you disregard the hype it caused back then, watching practically any season 1 episode will make you realize that it wasn't just all style over substance (if at all), as its detractors claim still to this day. You had gripping storylines, many of which were tantalizing takes on the best of Film Noir elements, for example ""Calderone's Return"", ""Golden Triangle"", and ""Lombard"". You had very good acting by the entire cast. And you had well-dosed light-hearted and comedic elements that were testament to the easy living which could be had in tropical southern Florida. The famous pastels were present in season one, but not as dialed up yet as in season two. The music selection beyond argument offered up the finest of early to mid-80s chart  and rock music - songs like ""Relax"" by Frankie Goes To Hollywood or ""What's Love Got To Do With It"" by Tina Turner, which weren't just hits back then, but are still remembered as quintessentially ""80s"" today.

For anybody who is a fan of the 80s and 80s pop culture, this season box set is a must to own. Not only does it show you how it all began, but it is well and truly an indispensable piece of 80s pop culture and television history.",1467417600,,2196,4.698701298701299

1449490,5,B00005JLEY,"""Miami Vice"" was one of the most unique and influential television series of the 1980s.  Viewers were attracted to this police drama that was filmed in Miami with its tropical scenes and that integrated popular songs into the storylines as no other show had before.  This DVD set contains all 22 episodes of the first season of the series that were originally broadcast on NBC from September 1984 to May 1985.

Don Johnson vaulted to fame for his portrayal of lead character Sonny Crockett, a vice cop who with his partner, Ricardo Tubbs (Philip Michael Thomas), solved crimes involving drugs, murder, gambling, smuggling, arms dealing, prostitution, kidnapping, burglary, home invasion, and organized crime.  Sonny dressed as no other TV policeman ever had, sporting Caribbean pastels that matched those of some the architecture seen in Miami.  Edward James Olmos played Lieutenant Martin Castillo, the taciturn, no-nonsense head of the vice department.

Bruce Willis, Glenn Frey, and Pam Grier guest starred during the first season, and the aforementioned music was stellar, with Phil Collins, Russ Ballard, Tina Turner, the Pointer Sisters, Steppenwolf, The Animals, Autograph, ZZ Top, Glen Frey, Peter Gabriel, Foreigner, Sheila E., U2, and others accentuating the storylines with their songs.

The bonus material on this set looks at the filming, style, and music of ""Miami Vice"" as well as the effect that the series had on the Florida city.  The show was one of the most iconic of the whole decade, and even the theme song was one of the best in television history.  Gen Xers who saw the show and who purchase this set will enjoy remembering some of the classic episodes, and those in younger generations who are fascinated by the Eighties will be treated to one of the most memorable contributions to that decade's pop culture.",1428019200,,1835,5.09
1449491,5,B00005JLEY,"This show changed the way things were done on TV and perhaps no other entertainment series better personified the 80's than Miami Vice.

I heard that there were certain episodes in various seasons that were ""edited"" I would love to see the ""unedited"" as a special features or something!

I also thought it was odd that there were not any interviews in the recent years available as part of any of the 5 Seasons Disc set from the 7 main core cast! That would have been nice too. All of them but Don have usually appeared on various Miami Vice specials discussing the show, why not be a part of the Miami Vice DVD release?

I know these DVDs were released I think from 2004/2005 to 2006/2007 but at that time it was during the 20th anniversary. I would have been great for a re-release for the 30th, with this time more available special features such as ""unedited"" versions of certain episodes and actual interviews with the main 7 cast!

1449682,5,B00005JLEY,"Happy 30th anniversary Miami Vice!
Season one was pitched to execs as MTV Cops  Michael Mann's 1984 Globe and Emmy winning lightning in a bottle by scored by Jan Hammer featuring pastel wearing Floridian cowboy Don Johnson a.k.a. Sony Crockett and his reluctant NYC transplant Philip Michael Thomas a.k.a. Rico Tubbs. The pair of super cool super vice-cops are lead by a steely enigmatic captain
played by the great Edward James Olmos.
Miami Vice is where the Phil Collins (and other great 80's selections) montage is as much a character as Florida itself. Seriously, Miami Vice was one of the 1st American network-tv show broadcast in stereophonic sound. A strong enough opening season to keep
running 5 years and living on through syndication and a feature film 2006 reboot (not including the original cast members).
It was a super-stylized cop show that perhaps influenced the MTV music video movement as much as it was influenced by it. Not to mention fashion  influences, Hell, I can remember the exact point that I stopped wearing socks with my sneakers!
The genre is sometimes referred to as Neo-noir, the best episodes, in my humble opinion, were the series signature darker ones totally free of stereotypical cop epilogue ending abruptly after some tragic violence and no denouement. Cut to Crockett and/or Tubbs yelling ""no!"" In slow motion, freeze-frame, fade-to-black...

Season one opens with ""Brother's Keeper Emmy-winning pilot (best cinematography) episode and an impressive intro it is to the Miami Vice universe. It's singular  weakness is the lack of James Elmos, quickly amended in episode two.
Pilot villain gangster Calderone returns in excellent early season one two parter aptly named Calderone's Return, in which His daughter tests Rico's loyalties. This season has Sony struggle with putting his broken marriage behind him. It has Vice break up a home invasion ring, a trip the Florida everglades to recover a star witness, a off shore power boat racing smuggling ring, Gina and Trudy go undercover as prostitutes,  Crockett and the Captain Castillio have old flames return in need, and Pam Grier also returns as Tubb's NYC love interest Valerie.

Over its 5 year run lots of amazing guest stars, Musicians trying they hand at acting and future celebs: Liam Neeson, Steve Buscemi Viggo Mortenson, Michael Chikis, Bill Paxton,
Glenn Frey, Sheena Easton, Pam Grier, the late Dennis Farina, Helena Bonham Carter, Miguel Ferrer, Iman, Ted Nugent, Ian McShane, Ving Rhames, Mr James Brown, Bruce Willis, Wesley Snipes, Little Richard,  John Glover even ex-Mrs Johnson Melanie Griffith.
Recurring gangster Calderone's avenging son is even John Leguizamo.

They are a trip back into the 1980's, yet strangely ahead of their time all at once.  The 80's were a great decade for its unique styles of fashion and music, but primitive in the technology used to make TV shows compared to today yet these do not seem outdated when viewing them.  1984.  Wow.  Seems so crazy that 30 years have gone by since gathering on Friday evenings to wait and watch these episodes.  VCR's were not even in all households yet.",1397347200,,542,4.424242424242424

Guess I got nostalgic and starting watching it on Amazon videos ( I guess because I now live in South Florida and wanted to see some of the shots of the area and heard the stories of the Cocaine Cowboy days of Miami).

1449833,5,B00005JLEY,"A famous scene from Miami Vice is the Crockett and Tubbs car trip while Phil Collins's ""In The Air Tonight"" plays (""Brother's Keeper,"" Season 1 Episode 1).  For more than a decade, I wanted to know where the famous scene was filmed.  I discovered the filming locations after I moved to Miami in January 2013.  My enjoyment and interest in Miami Vice has increased since I became a resident of Miami.

During the ""In The Air Tonight"" scene, I paused the DVD at the elapsed time of 1 hour 23 minutes and 35 seconds (1h:23m:35s).  I saw a lighted ""Ocean Bank"" sign.  The building in the scene also has two large white columns that are illuminated at night.  I used the satellite view and the street view on Google Maps to look at every Ocean Bank location in Miami.  I went to the building that looked like the building in the scene.  When I saw it in person, I confirmed that it was the same building shown on Miami Vice.

My trip to the Ocean Bank building allowed me to identify five buildings that are in the famous scene.  There are two Miami Vice buildings at the intersection of NW 42nd Avenue and NW 7th Street in Miami: the Ocean Bank building (1h:23m:35s) and the Shell gas station (1h:23m:34s).  The Shell gas station in 2013 was a Gulf station in 1984.  There are two Miami Vice buildings at the intersection of NW 42nd Avenue and NW 3rd Street in Miami: Le Jeune House (1h:26m:31s) and the International House of Pancakes (IHOP) (1h:24m:05s).  The Management Resources Institute building is between the Ocean Bank building and the IHOP.  The Management Resources Institute building is at 550 NW 42nd Avenue (42nd Avenue is also called Le Jeune Road) (1h:26m:27s).

Some of the ""In The Air Tonight"" scene was filmed in another part of Miami (the Omni area).  I made a trip to the Omni area.  There are two Miami Vice buildings on Biscayne Boulevard in Miami: Carnival Tower (1h:26m:49s) and the Omni buildings (1h:26m:41s).  Carnival Tower is at the NE 13th Street intersection.  Carnival Tower is the small part of the Sears Building that was not demolished after Miami Vice was cancelled.  A better view of the Sears Building is shown later in the show (1h:34m:24s).  The Omni buildings are at the NE 15th Street intersection.  The Omni buildings used to be the Omni International Mall.

The information that I gave in the previous paragraphs came from just one scene.  Miami Vice was on television for five seasons.  The five seasons of Miami Vice are described in five titles in the bonus material menu: The Vibe Of Vice (How Miami Vice changed television), Building The Perfect Vice, The Style Of Vice, The Music Of Vice, and Miami After Vice.  The Miami Vice Season One DVD has six single-sided DVDs or three double-sided DVDs.  The bonus material menu is on the first DVD of the six DVD set (and the three DVD set).",1379548800,,2831,4.619238476953908
1449834,5,B00005JLEY,"Don't ask ""why"" but I missed ""Miami Vice"" when it first came out in the 1980's. I didn't  think I would enjoy it, but a commentary accompanying ""Basic Instinct"" or ""Twin Peaks"" -- I forget -- mentioned ""Miami Vice"" as break-through television and that's how I ended up viewing the first season. I will end up getting all seasons (I don't know how many there are).

The plot devises used in this series which today seem dated and cliche were NOT dated and cliche when this show came out.  This show was ground-breaking.  We tend to laugh at the clothing styles and dismiss this show as being ""typical 1980's""... but I challenge you to sit down and start watching this series again.  It's not silly... it is captivating.  Having said that... the producers did do several episodes that were decidedly more a ""comedy"" episode, such as those featuring Phil Collins as a character actor... and those episodes were not the finest hours of this series.  When the producers again returned to the serious dramatic episodes, that is where this show truly shines.  Also, I cannot count how many stars made appearances on this series when they were just in the infancy of their acting careers.  This show was an incubator for many well-known actors and actresses today.  Watch the pilot episode ... and the first two or three following episodes... and you will be drawn-in to the dark, melancholy, nail-biting, underbelly of Miami's Vice Squad... and you will be hooked, again.",1352505600,5,1254,4.952153110047847

1450093,5,B00005JLEY,"I snagged this in 2011 as got a little nostalgic for the whole ""Miami Vice"" vibe. I will say the series holds up pretty well on DVD. First of all, kudos to the people who put this out as they throw on five different extras all of which give us a good look at how music and fashion were an integral part of the show as well as how the show incorporated its setting (Miami and all of South Florida) into the show. There's also some great interview clips off the ""Today"" show with the cast. Toss in bits with Jan hammer who did the signature soundtracks to each episode and the extras really are worth the price of this DVD.

The transfer to DVD is very good. The series still oozes that ""pastel and art deco meets the dark underbelly of Miami"" feel to it. At times some of the episodes do suffer from the wrap it all up in an hour arc of network TV.

On this set you get the two-hour pilot which has Jimmy Smits (say what?) as Crockett's partner. I won't give anything away but Tubbs shows up in the pilot. Also, Crockett's boss in the pilot is Gregory Sierra. James Edward Olmos takes over later in the first season. Anyway, just FYI, guest stars that first season included Bruce Willis (with hair!), the Eagles' Glenn Frey, the aforementioned Dennis Farina, Joan Chen, Hawaii 5-0's Keye Luke and Pam Grier.
There's also the famous Switek and Zito (the other two less-sartorially splendored cops in the vice squad) episode which is as hilarious as I remembered it.

You may not be into watching the entire season as it does have its excellent and duff episodes and I found myself picking and choosing. Even so I'd say if you're a fan of the show, it's worth at least having a gander at. You won't be disappointed.",1322438400,3,1712,4.360501567398119

Homosexuality
Government corruption
The military industrial complex and its support of third world dictators.
PTSD among Vietnam Veterans
Sexual Assault
Prostitution
Domestic violence

This series was also ahead of its time in terms of visual design, editing, soundtrack production, and character exposition over the five seasons.  Now that does not mean that this series did not have its faults.  The show had its share of lame and cheesy moments.

Unfortunately, people make the glamour themselves. In the movie you can see criminals, but you don't even notice them while looking at the detectives. In case of Al Capone is, like, opposite. People mention Capone more than Eliot Ness, the detective who fought against him. That's shame for the society. I love the fact that movie has a message to all of us to look at the beautiful things around us to feel better, and continue living despite all the bad things that happen in our lives. Too bad that way you don't even see the poor people living in misery, and trying to feel the same. That's the life. I recommend people watch this movie.",1320451200,,776,4.358620689655172

I wish I would have watched more Miami Vice as a kid growing up in the 80's but I'm sure I had good reasons at the time not to. I've always loved the look & feel of the Miami image but I have never been there, although my times spent in Florida are similar to the scenery I see in this show.

Johnson, Thomas, Olmos, and their cast mates are superb in their roles as Miami Vice detectives, working to shut down criminal operations, drug deals, stopping murderers and armed robbers, and more.  Olmos is particularly effective as the steely man of few words, Lt. Castillo.

Some of the best episodes occur towards the end of the season, such as ""Nobody Lives Forever"" and ""Evan.""

1450164,5,B00005JLEY,"It's interesting that a majority of the reviews for this show are based on people who grew up with it, or have a fondness for seeing it when it originally aired.  I don't have that as the show aired when I was too young to watch.  But given the things I've heard, I gave it a try.  I'm glad I did.  This show stands the test of time better than most shows.  The action is top notch, and I can't help but love the characters.  The soundtrack is pretty awesome too.  Now don't get me wrong, there is some serious 80s cheese on the show.  I don't blame the show, as I'd guess this show defined the stereotypes of the 80s rather than followed them.  But this show has plenty of episodes that transcend time.  For instance, I think Evan is a suprisingly good episode, tackling subjects such as homosexuality as well as redemption.  Lombard is also a great episode, where a symphathetic mobster has to decide whether to testify against his mob friends, or betray his code.  These episodes aren't just good for the 80s, but just good television.  I think their a misconception that Miami Vice is a great 80s show, but their wrong, its just a great show.

A wonderful dimension to Season One is the pleasure of watching those episodes filmed when the spectacular success of program was being realized and experienced in real time by the cast.  The terrific acting that Crockett and Tubbs bring to Vice takes on an added measure of easygoing and very shining confidence.  So too do the parties that are incorporated in those episodes.  There is an energy to them that is very special, hinting of newly discovered greatness in the air.  Vice Season One is the inauguration of an extraordinary storyline that, from my view now into Season Three, brings excellent elements along the way, much like fine yet varied selections of choice wine.",1249171200,,725,4.909836065573771
1450166,3,B00005JLEY,"This 1984-85 Season of MIAMI VICE is the season that started it all and the season that made Don Johnson(Crockett) a superstar and a sex symbol when this police drama made its debut on NBC in September of 1984, which reminds me that it just so happens that Don Johnson had also auditioned for the role of Michael Knight on KNIGHT RIDER in 1982, but Don Johnson obviously didn't get the part, since it was given to David Hasselhoff.

Fortunately, when Don Johnson got hired for the role of Sonny Crockett on MIAMI VICE and this show became an instant hit in the Fall of 1984, Don Johnson became like the new sex symbol of the 1980's and joined Tom Selleck, David Hasselhoff, and Pierce Brosnan as part of the sexiest actors of the mid 80's.

MIAMI VICE's 1st Season also takes me all the way back to memory lane when NBC's motto was ""Let's All Be There"" and when MIAMI VICE was on NBC every Friday night at 10PM following HUNTER at 9PM along with the fact that this was the season when this police drama led to the cancellation of the detective drama MATT HOUSTON in the Spring of 1985 since MIAMI VICE's 10PM time-slot on NBC conflicted with MATT HOUSTON's 10PM time-slot on ABC which resulted in MATT HOUSTON taking a nose-dive in the Nielsen ratings since MATT HOUSTON started losing a lot of viewers through MIAMI VICE which basically beat MATT HOUSTON to a pulp.

In addition to what's so awesome about this MIAMI VICE DVD; it doesn't have any of the episodes with all those deleted scenes and added commercials in between like they were when they were converted into reruns on USA, FX, TNN,  TV Land; and Cozi-TV, they were all shown complete and uncut just like they were shown on their original air-dates on NBC with the exception of no commercials of course.

As a matter of fact, I like the way Universal had shown a brief summary of each episode with their original air dates on this MIAMI VICE-SEASON 1 DVD, just like Universal did with KNIGHT RIDER-SEASONs 1,2,3; MAGNUM, P.I.-SEASONS 1,2,3; THE A-TEAM-SEASONS 1,2,3; AIRWOLF-SEASON 1 DVD, but for some reason Universal had decided to stop showing a brief summary of each episode with their original air-dates all of the sudden in the Spring of 2006, just like they did with MIAMI VICE-SEASON 4, KNIGHT RIDER-SEASON 4, MAGNUM-SEASON 4, and THE A-TEAM-SEASON 4.

For instance, the original air-dates to each of these 1984-1985 Season episodes were
9/16/84-BROTHER'S KEEPER#Aka The Pilot Episode#
9/28/84-HEART OF DARKNESS

*Ed O'Neill in the ""Heart Of Darkness"" episode before his co-starring days as the dysfunctional and perverted(Al Bundy)on MARRIED WITH CHILDREN

*Keye Luke in ""The Golden Triangle"" episode after his co-starring days on KUNG-FU

*Singer Glenn Frey formerly from The Eagles guest starring in the ""Smugglers Blues"" episode

The only problem I have with this DVD box set of this police drama is each disc seems to have a problem with freezing up and skipping which is perhaps what has prompted Universal to make and release the MIAMI VICE-The Complete Series DVD box set recently in order to make up or compensate all the flaws and discrepancies that Universal had with the first few DVD season box sets of MIAMI VICE despite the fact that Universal has decided to make a complete series DVD box set of MIAMI VICE in todays faltering economy.",1230508800,3,4120,5.005847953216374

WKRP in Cincinnati cant seem to get their music fees in order and most of those songs are only 7 seconds long, so Kudos to Universal. Now the price in Best Buy and Circuit City or any retailer is still $44 for season one EVEN with NO DVD features, so that tells you that the retailers got the word that this DVD will not be underpriced ...EVER, to recoup their money. If only WKRP was willing to sell their seasons for $44 bucks, we could get by all this garbage and down to business.

1450220,3,B00005JLEY,"If you haven't seen the pilot of Miami Vice, its worth the price of these discs.
Sonny Crocket knows that a bad cop is in his department, but he can't seem to convince anyone else.  He needs to hunt down a drug dealer that's responsible for the deaths of several cops.  He's been undercover for too long, and he and his wife are going through a tough divorce.
Tubbs is a detective from New York after the same bad dealer.  He shows up in Miami and teams up with Crocket.

This simple plot culminates in one of the best-filmed scenes ever done for television, as Phil Collins ""In the Air Tonight"" plays, and the front wheel of a fast car spins in the foreground of the frame while the pavement flies by.  The music tells the story along with some really great acting.  The song only fades long enough for Crockett to pull over to a pay phone and call his ex-wife.  Working undercover has taken its toll.  Crockett had just found the bad cop, and he's questioning everything.  When his wife answers, he asks her a simple question:  ""What we had... not now, but before.  Was it real?""
She's taken aback by the question, but in an instant, you can tell that she knows he's troubled.  ""Yeah.  You bet it was real,"" she reassures him.

This is what made Miami Vice the brilliant show it was.  It recognized what it took to work undercover.  Crockett and Tubbs weren't two perfect cops, but basically good guys with real flaws, who made mistakes along the way.

Not every episode of Miami Vice was as good as the pilot.  But its still pretty damn good, and most of modern television owes something to Miami Vice.
If you're a fan of the show ""24"", watch for hints of that show here.  Joel Surnow was the story editor on many of the episodes of Miami Vice.  On some episodes, you can see the early flavor of ""24"" developing.

Even more interesting are the guest apparences of actors who weren't as famous at the time.  Bruce Willis, Jimmy Smits, and Ed Oneil all play small parts.",1208822400,7,1971,4.401662049861496

The pilot and the two episodes dealing with Calderone's comeback to Miami in this season are the highlights along with ""Smuggler's blues"", ""Rites of passage"", ""The maze"", ""Evan"" and ""Lombard"" (the sequel to this episode comes in season 5).

The bad news - Universal probably transcribe the episodes over from the vhs prints all the episodes looks grainy and colors bleed (especially red), I have play the discs on a regular crt & my 1080p hdtv - the picture looks worst on hdtv all of the grain shows. Even more puzzling its that other Universal titles (which I own) like Columbo, McCloud which are older looks better than Vice (!)

1450305,5,B00005JLEY,"This dvd edition ,of the first complete season of "" Miami Vice "" is an absolute must have for the tv show fans. In case you're totally in the dark about this show, "" Miami Vice "" was one of the most revered and watched shows in the 1980's. It has absoutely no resemblance to the flagalant 2006 , Michael Mann film. Starring , a young ,  Don Johnson and Phillip Michael Thomas as lead detectives (Sonny Crockett and Ricardo Tubbs),this show quickly went from nightime police drama to cultural icon. "" miami Vice "" is based on a fictional police vice squad in Miami, Florida , and showcases their efforts to infiltrate the ""unground"" drug world from Miami to Cuba ( and occasioanlly New York ). To say, that the show was good, is an understatement , since it defined a generation and permenantly re-shaped television shows. The true magic,in this tv series, still resonates through it's music , breathtaking cinematography, and imagery. Compared to today's standards ,it might appear as old school. However , "" Miami Vice "" was the first predocessor and broke the ground , providing new ways for future programs and features , like "" NYPD Blue "" , and ""CSI "". In a small twist of irony , the original pilot was written by a writer who wrote another hit NBC show , entitled "" Hill Street Blues "". Both of these two shows had an incredible character development,realism and gritty integrity, that collectively won a staggering, 120 Emmy Awards. Watching this dvd was like reliving my teenage years again. Honestly, I put it in my dvd player to check out the first episode and ended up watching most of the dvd for an entire day. The first season is uncut and re-mastered and is an excellent choice for your dvd collection. However , the dvd itself doesn't have that much to offer , if you like alot of extra features. Whereas , the dvd does have special features , they're very generic , dated , and extremely short. Aside from that , it was a sheer pleasure to see old episodes and enjoy cameo appearances by some of today's top actor's like Bruce Willis , Jimmy Smits ,Gene Simmons ,Benicio Del Toro ,Viggo Morteson , Phil Collins , Miles Davis , Ed O'Neill , Lou Diamond Phillips , ect..  The episodes are easy to seperate and the sound is very crip and clear. As a whole , this dvd is a very worthwhile purchase. So , cut off your sleeves , take off those socks, slip on some white penny loafers and stop shaving. It's time to break out those old pastel shirts and  relive the excitement of "" Miami Vice - Season One "".

1450306,4,B00005JLEY,"Great show, great video quality, great sound quality. The issue: where is U2's ""Pride (In the Name of Love)""? It was used on Calderone's Return Part 1 (also known as The Hit List) during the scene where Tubbs was racing in the Ferrari to Crockett's house in the lead-in to the climactic final shootout. It is on the VHS version, but NOT on the DVD version. The song in question was used in ""Prodigal Son, Part 1,"" but it is only played as background music in a nightclub very  briefly. So I question the DVD's cover assertion, ""With a sizzling soundtrack of all the original hit songs remixed in 5.1 Stereo Sound, including music by Phil Collins, U2, The Who and more...""

Something is amiss here.",1157932800,2,697,4.523809523809524
1450307,5,B00005JLEY,"Without a doubt the first two seasons of this series are the best. It's really hard to realize just how innovative this show was at the time...think about it. The songs, clothes, styles, cars, story lines, etc, set the show apart from the rest of the bilge on television in 84-85. (Later on the show sort of sank from its own weight.) I mean, how many d***, boring CSI shows can one watch now?

In my humble opinion, Philip Michael Thomas was the best dressed one in this series. Don Johnson, well, he'll always be known as the sarcastic (and troubled) Sonny Crockett. Just think of his roles in the awful movies he did later (Marlboro Man, Tin Cup.) His characters exactly match Sonny.  Anyway, Season 1 and 2 are well worth the money.",1157673600,4,736,4.485074626865671

'Vice' broke new ground, something TV can't seem to do anymore, maybe they can copy it as a reality show, 'Real, Live, Miami Vice'. If you loved the TV series, buy the DVD, no B.S. commercials to sit through.",1156204800,2,294,4.175438596491228
1450309,5,B00005JLEY,"The crime series, ""Miami Vice"" not only spawned a revolutionary change in men's apparel (white linen jackets, t-shirts, no socks) but forever altered the appearance of the typical crime series on television with a gritty and uncomfortable realism that has now become the norm.

Someone once said ""Miami Vice was like watching a variation of Brian DePalma's ""Scarface"" every week.""  And it is easy to make that comparison with its emphasis on drug runners, drug kingpins and narcotics. ""Miami Vice,"" with its popular theme obviously moves with the fluidity of an MTV video with action sequences orchestrated to popular tunes by Phil Collins, U2, Glenn Frey, and Peter Gabriel to name a few.

While ""Miami Vice"" may not have always been the most realistic crime drama on TV (For example, how many cops do you know drive a Ferrari Daytona as their pursuit vehicle?), it was an aborbing, tense, riveting, edge-of-your-seat weekly drama that defined the 80's.  One only needs to look at other lesser-known crime series' like ""Silk Stalkings"" to see the similarities--the good looking, stylized  central characters, the pastel-colored sets, and the fatal attraction to depicting the ugly underbelly of organized crime.

This is a terrific set as is Set 2; however, I saved approximately $20.00 purchasing Sets 1 and 2 shrinkwrapped together at Costco for only $39.99 as opposed to the full list price of $43.99 for each set thru Amazon! All episodes are remastered to crystal clarity with Dolby 5.1 enhanced audio.  Needless to say, both Don Johnson and Phillip Michael Thomas were well-cast in their respective roles as Detectives Crockett and Tubbs.

Some great extras are included as well including 5 short documentaries on the series and its influence in music, fashion, and even the city of Miami itself.",1154822400,3,1803,5.108843537414966
1450360,5,B00005JLEY,"I loved this series when it was on television!!!  It was so much fun to watch!  I was attending my first year of college when this show was well on its way to becoming a great cult classic.  But something funny happened. It actually got ""cool.""  And people caught on to the Vice clique!

I can remember even buying two ""Miami vice"" style jackets, a grey one, and a black one.  Okay, I stopped short of wearing no socks, and pull on shoes.  But actually I take that back.  I did have the pull on shoes.  But I did wear socks!

Okay, enough about me!  I loved this freshman season of the Miami Vice franchise!  It was AWESOME!  It was so much fun to watch Pen Jillete and Phil Collins, and even that father from ""Married with Children"" in surprise roles.  A surprise, because these ""character"" actors were early in their prime, and all have established careers now.

I would recommend this for any hardcore Vice fan, and as a rental for all others.

Two thumbs up!

1450361,5,B00005JLEY,"Miami Vice was never as good as its first season. Sure, everyone talks about the clothes, Don Johnson's stubble and the Ferarri Daytona, but what made the show for me was its offbeat quality.

The early episodes had a quirkiness, a looseness, about them that didn't seem as forced or pretentious as later seasons did, and the overall chemistry of the cast was perfect.  Take the characters of Crockett and Tubbs for instance.  There was the sense of a somewhat easy-going, equal partnership in the inaugural season that became more unbalanced in later years with Crockett becoming the focus of the story 99 percent of the time. Tubbs gradually went from being ""Tough, Unique, Bad, Bold, Sassy"" ( Hope fans get the reference) to a boring stiff.  The show started out as  Miami Vice and became  The Don Johnson Show.

It was too bad.

There were some excellently written episodes in year 1  that not only focused on the two leads but highlighted the supporting cast as well, i.e. "" Made for Each Other"" featuring Switek and Zito, ""The Golden Triangle,"" pts 1 and 2 with the foculs on Lt. Castillo and ""Give a Little, Take a Little,"" a story highlighting Gina and Trudy.

If you don't believe my praise of the Crockett and Tubbs partnership in the first year, just take a look at episodes such as the series pilot, ""Heart of Darkness,"" ""Cool Runnin"" ""Return of Calderone 1 (aka 'Hit List') and 2"" (aka 'Calderone's Demise'), ""Glades,"" ""Smugglers Blues,"" ""Milk Run,"" and ""Evan."" Compare the writing, pacing and the chemistry of the leads in the first season to year 2 and tell me if I am wrong.

The second season wasn't as bad as later years, but it paled in comparison to the inaugural year where Vice hit TV like a shot from Crockett's Bren 10 and influenced everything from clothes, to shaving habits.  But, that's my humble opinion.",1151971200,6,1833,4.67601246105919
1450362,4,B00005JLEY,"Miami Vice makes cop shows of today look boring...and they are. Seeing Law & Order re-runs advertised all the time on TNT like they are something exciting makes me wish Miami Vice was still on. I was only little when it was on but now that the dvds got me into it, I see what I was missing. This is a good season but not even the best, from what I've seen from TV Land marathans this show got even better. Plus since I own season 2 and saw it recently, that's a great season too. This isn't bad at all though. You have appearences by Ed O'Neal, Bruce Willis, Dennis Farina, Jimmy Smitts and others. With music by Phil Collins and U2.

  Of couse since this is the beginning of the hit series, it's about 'Sonny' Crockett (Don Johnson) and Tubbs (Philip Michael Thomas) meeting and bonding through-out the season. At first Sonny dosn't want to team up but eventually agrees to. In the first episode they Tubbs is trying to track down the man that killed his brother. While Crockett is mourning his dead partner ""Jimmy Smitts"", who gets killed when the two are under-cover. I think 3 or 4 episodes into the series, ""maybe  more or less"" Crockett's boss gets killed and replaced by the stone cold Lt. Martin Castillo (Edward James Olmos). Olmos is great as Castillo and probably the most memorable character. Although I'm still having nightmares of the episode where he's wearing a tiny bathing suit ""shivers"" lol.

  Plus while no one can replace Olmos as Castillo, no one could play Crockett and Tubbs as well as Don Johnson or Philip Michael Thomas either. Oh wait they are replacing them in a new movie....lol. Colin Farrell as Crockett and...the Predator as Tubbs....oops I mean Jamie Foxx ""he just looks like the Predator lol"". I doubt they casted him on looks since...he has nothing on Philip Michael Thomas look wise and he's not like him period. Terrence Howard (Hustle and Flow) probbaly would've been a better choice although I don't think anyone would be as good as the original actors. They all grow on you and the 80's music and style grows on you too. I doubt we're gonna be hearing Phil Collins or U2 in the new movie, we're most likely just gonna get an all rap sound track.

This was years ago, then I was in a video store and saw a copy of season one and I got it right on the spot to see how well the videogame was compared to the TV show itself. I opened the box and I saw my first pet peeve of DVDs. They were double-sided. That is just something I really hate because you have to watch out on either side of the disc. Second, the DVD loaded well and I started to play the first episode. The editing wasn't good at all the frame would freeze and somebody would still be talking or finish their sentence. Other than that annoyance (which goes away as the season goes on) the show gets better and better. The plots are kind of repetitive (cocaine, cocaine and more cocaine) but since cocaine was really big in Miami in the 1980s, I can understand that repetitive plot. The special features aren't really worth it, but they have a few interesting points. All in all, Miami Vice: Season one is worth it for fans, and people interested in seeing the real thing before the remake movie comes out.",1140566400,2,1173,4.241071428571429

I have longed to have this on DVD.  Season 1 is Incredibly Awesome.  The DVD  I have some glitches which are very annoying but over all the TV show in Season 1 is just how I remember.  The story lines, styles the music and Don & Rico, the rest of the Miami Vice Crew are just like I remember.  My Excitement as I watched it on DVD and when I watched it on TV is just how I remember it.  I do have my favorite episodes.  The Pilot, Evan, Were No Buses Run, Smugglers's Blue, Golden Triangle I & II.  Every espisode is Wonderful.

If you are a Fan of the series I would encourage you to purchase this DVD.  Although I am giving this DVD a 5 Stars because the Series is Worthy of that.  Even with the minor glitches with the DVD it is worth it.  I am going to purchase Season 2.  I am eagerly awaiting that arrival soon.  In hope that the Studio will release Season 3, and all the other episodes.

1450369,5,B00005JLEY,"When you think of the 1980s, you think of Miami Vice.  No other television program epitomized the flashy, fast, and over the top nature of the ""Decade of Greed"" than this show. Fortunately, we now have the first season captured in a boxed collector's set.

Miami Vice: Season One is a must-have for any fan of the series, fan of the 1980s, or for fans of police/action dramas in general. The picture quality remains pretty true to mid-80's form, but the soundtrack has been digitally remastered into 5.1 stereo surround which sounds fabulous when connected to enhanced speakers (the pulsating soundtrack, screeching wheels, and high-powered shoot-outs all come to life).

Don Johnson and Philip Michael Thomas play detectives Sonny Crockett and Ricardo Tubbs as part of a southern Florida undercover unit called Miami Vice. Each episode is packed with action, drama, and suspense...and does not disappoint. Special guest actors make frequent appearances, including Jimmy Smits, Ed O'Neil, and Bruce Willis. Altogether there are over 20 episodes from Season 1 (1984-85) contained in this set, including the original 2 hour program pilot that served as the Miami Vice promo that aired during the summer of 1984.
Aside from the episodes themselves are five mini-documentaries on the production of the show, it's music, it's cinematography, it's fashion, and the impact that Miami Vice had on American culture at large in the 1980s. Also, this collector's edition set is packaged in a beautiful fold-out case decorated with silhouttes of palm trees along the Miami sunset and profile shots of Johnson and Thomas.

I remember watching Vice as a child, and looking back 20 years later, it is remarkable to consider the lasting impact that this show has had on the popular culture. Miami Vice has had a huge influence on video games (a la the Grand Theft Auto and True Crime: Streets series) and helped usher in a new era of prime time police dramas (such as NYPD Blue and New York Undercover).

I highly recommend this DVD set to both fans of the show when it aired during the 1980s and also the younger generation who may have never had the chance to see Miami Vice when it aired, but who are fans of the crime drama.",1134950400,7,2212,4.888

Definitely changed TV and the way shows looked.

I am looking forward to season 2 - much more of what I remember.

The atmosphere, the lighting, the colours, the (luckily original) MUSIC...! It's just never ever boring or out of fashion. The producers of Grand Theft Auto Vice City already did a good job to copy the atmosphere for a PC game and that just kept me longing more and more for a DVD set of Miami Vice. And now it's out!

So that's only 4 months, but they better bring out season 3, 4 and 5 right away. I'm definitely sure they would please a lot of fans around the globe! Thanks Universal and Michael Mann for this brilliant piece of work!",1123804800,,1140,4.210045662100456
1450461,5,B00005JLEY,"Purchasing this 3 disc set of the first season of ""Miami Vice"" was indeed the best investment I could have made when collecting vintage TV shows since I was a big fan of the series when it originally ran on NBC.  Each episode is clear and vibrant as it was when it first hit the airwaves over 20 years ago.  Although the fashion may be outdated, the music score of the series will always be memorable and nothing less that classic mod 80's sounds.  I even enjoyed all those bonus features about the inception of the series and what Miami looks like present day.  My only question is when will season 2 be out???",1123545600,2,611,4.333333333333333
1450462,5,B00005JLEY,"This was one of my favorite shows in the 80's and proves to still have what it takes today.  It took a couple of episodes to get rolling, but it takes off into the 'cool' we remember when the character 'Castillo' comes into light.  Along with the character comes the boats, updated entry clip, and the sultry theme we love.

The cars, the women, the boats, and the music tracks.  I can't imagine anyone not being satisfied with this DVD set.  My only question is, ""Why aren't the other seasons out yet?""  Get a move on, people!",1123372800,,527,4.381443298969073
1450463,4,B00005JLEY,"I expected to be disappointed watching Miami Vice after all these years.  I figured that the show, which was awesomely cool when I watched it as a teenager, would seem cheesy and laughable as an adult.  I was wrong.  Miami Vice is still as thrilling now as it was back then.  And for those of us who live in Miami, it is like opening a time capsule.  It's great fun to see what Miami looked like in 1984 and realize how much it has evolved since then.  This will be obvious to everyone when the movie comes out.  What hasn't changed is the cutting edge nature of the show.  The music is every bit as fabulous as it was then.  The clothing (well, at least the men's clothing) is still as cool as it was then.  Even the club scenes evoke fond memories of what it was like when people actually dressed up to go out at night.

What isn't so cool is the quality of the DVD (the reason for 4 stars instead of 5.)  I thought the producer could have done a much better job with the color and clarity of the image and sound.  It looks like an old videotape, not like a new DVD.  I hope that they put more effort into Season 2 and 3.  They owe it to the many Vice fans who have been waiting for a long time for the DVD.",1123200000,2,1209,4.0
1450464,4,B00005JLEY,"So after a long wait, ""Vice"" is finally on DVD, all with original music. It's well worth the wait. The first season had some of the series' best episodes, such as the stellar pilot, the superb ""Score""/""Golden Triangle"" 2-parter, and ""Evan"", an episode so perfectly written and acted, and so far ahead of its time, that it could easily fit onto any prime-time drama currently on the air.

So why not 5 stars? Well, the problem's not the series; it's the DVD set itself. The ""featurettes"", which combined add up to less than 20 minutes, are thin and uninformative, but I won't quibble. The picture quality is sometimes grainy and scratched, but I won't quibble. The packaging is intensely irritating, and now I'm quibbling. First of all, the DVD holders are the most brutally tight I've ever had to use. It's damned near impossible to remove the discs without either scuffing them up or cracking the centers. Why on earth did Universal use these? The holders for my ""V-The Complete Series"" set are a snap to use. These are a nightmare. And doubled-sided discs? I understand the impulse to try to keep packaging and manufacturing costs down, but if you're gonna use such tight disc holders, then you're asking for trouble with 2-sided discs. I just keep mine separate in empty CD jewel cases, but if Universal had done a better job, I wouldn't have to. I read that the next season set is in the works, and I applaud Universal for licensing all the original music (because ""Vice"" is nothing without music) and hope they do the same for the next season, but I also hope they'll improve the packaging for the next set. I know a lot of fans would appreciate it.",1123200000,3,1654,4.625850340136054

There has never been a show like this that had it all.  The music, the cars, the look and of course fantastic characters.  How can you not like Noogie or Izzy?

Universal did a great job with this set. (I'm not a major fan of the 2-sided dvd's but that's a minor quibble.) There are three things that separated Miami Vice from the pack in terms of cop shows that preceded it. The constant lack of happy endings, the cinematography, and the music. I'm so glad that Universal released this with the original music and I hope and pray that they do right by the 2nd and 3rd seasons. Vice just isn't watchable without the original soundtrack.",1122249600,,626,4.648648648648648

The British might be the specialists in charm, but Miami Vice invented the word and meaning of 'cool'.

Sonny and Crockett, a perfect duo, in ridiculously expensive and fashionable clothes and vehicles, the GREAT music, the action, the mysterious chief, the fantastic filming technique used by Michael Mann that also made Manhunter such a great classic: I will never get over that horrible last episode with the shaking of hands and the driving off of Sonny in his stolen Ferrari...But thank God this is the first part of this series that set the standard for all good looking and slick films, series and music videos to come.",1120780800,2,838,4.985714285714286

And then it hits you--This is the same guy that made that hit show Miami Vice! I've only seen some of the debut show, but the filming is excellent! The cutting edge shots, the strong acting by Don Johnson and Philip Michael Thomas and strong assists by Edward James Olmos, Jimmy Smits, Ed O' Neill and others.  The filming in Miami and South Beach are fabulous.  This show really exposed many viewers to the drug trafficking that went on in Miami and south Florida in the '80s.  The show's mix of music and action scenes intertwined so very well.  It's had an impact on today's dramas like CSI and other drama shows.  Some '80s stars have a reluctance to look back, all caught up in the present. But they need to understand that there are loyal fans of their shows.  Miami Vice is still remembered to this day and the show still looks fresh.  Some people do wear the pastel suits in the show to this day, but they are very caught up in the conservative fashions of now. This is a phenomenal show for its time in the '80s and I hope that future DVDs of the next four seasons come out soon!",1117411200,2,1219,4.367256637168142

I hope the sales have been and continue to be strong for the first season so that they'll release the rest of the seasons and I hope they do it soon.

After while I was allowed to stay up and watch it. It was something that I shared with my late brother. It was a good time. Growing up there were many references to Miami Vice between us.

1450589,5,B00005JLEY,"I was a bit nervous about getting this.  Sometimes shows we remember from our youth turn out to be awful when we watch them as an adult.  Not so with this show.  It's still great, beyond just the memories of youth.

Consider Michael Mann's recent films - Collateral and Heat - and you'll trace the same thing back to Miami Vice.  Everything is meticulously choreographed and filmed.  It still has a hip feel to it, even though it is very much 80s (wait 'til you see the dancing at the parties!).

It's great in retrospect to watch the development of the characters and the actors in those roles.  You can literally watch Don Johnson and Philip Michael Thomas become Crockett and Tubbs.  The minor characters also develop into their irrespective roles, especially Edward James Olmos as Castillo.  Olmos is the one who added the dark edge to what was potentially riding the cusp of taking the comic edge just a bit too far.

And the music!  Come on, let's face it, the music made the show.  Along with Phil Collins' 'In the Air Tonight' in the Pilot there is Russ Ballard's 'Voices' as Crockett and Tubbs head to the Bahamas to take on Calderone and Glenn Frey's 'Smuggler's Blues'.  The big deal in school on Monday was to talk about what song was on Miami Vice and how it was used.

Riding on the tails of MTV and the video generation, Miami Vice defined a generation of television in the course of its too brief life.  Hard to believe it's been twenty years.  It still looks and sounds as hip as it was then.

It's a reasonably priced boxed set.  There are a few extras but nothing overly special there.  Buy the boxed set for the shows alone.  It's one worth owning.",1112918400,11,1668,4.456953642384106

1450592,3,B00005JLEY,"Pretty much everyone here recognizes that Miami Vice is one of the great TV shows of all time.  So with the amazing episodes already made, you'd think it would be a simple task to clean up the audio and sound, and present the discs in nice packaging.  Apparently not for Universal.

The video quality is in general good, but the grain is definitely noticeable and sometimes there are specks, dirt, etc.  I am not that picky but if I can watch movies from the 30's and 40's that have cleaner video than a show from the mid 80's, then somebody is definitely not doing their job.

On sound, again it is generally good but there seems to be synchronization problems.  During some episodes, the words don't match the actors' lips.

The packaging irritates me as well.  The DVD's are held incredibly tight in the packaging.  I have no problem removing DVD's from standard cases.  However, I have caused hairline fractures in the inner plastic rings of these DVD's trying to remove them from the case because they are held so tightly.  Standard DVD holders work fine.  Why not stick with them?

These issues don't detract much from my enjoyment of the show but they are annoying.  If I shell out $40 for a product, I expect a little effort to be put into it, not some cheap job.

CSI: Miami), the short-lived series Fastlane (still irritated that Fox cancelled it, but I digress), and most dramas are the way they are now due to how Miami Vice was produced back then by Michael Mann. The look he gave was distinct and slick. The background music, from Jan Hammer's trademark theme song and underlying score thoughout, and the use of well-known (and even some obscure) music artists throughout the series. The writing was top-notch, so this show was more than just ""gloss"". My only quibble is that I wish they had cleaned up some of the grime I see on transfer, though the quality is much better than the reruns you see, and the use of 5.1 surround is a definite plus.

1450594,4,B00005JLEY,"Before I got Season 1, I was all hyped up because I couldn't wait to see the greatest season of Miami Vice finally on DVD. Well, the hype is over and I don't look at Season 1, as that great or as the greatest season now. It's a great season, but it feels kind of empty now. The problem is that there just wasn't enough action or thrills. Most of the episodes have very week endings where maybe a few bullets would be fired and that was that. Not enough intensity or powerful drama. With the exception of Milk Run or Smuggler's Blues that provided both. Season 1, is by far the quietest season of the three. Let's face it Miami Vice went on for three sensational seasons and after May '87, the show was cancelled and turned into a spin off, called Dade County Cops that explored the supernatural and bizarre on goings on planet Earth. A show that sucked more than anything in this world. Now back to Vice.

  The greatest season of Miami Vice is definetly Season 3. It's the season that consisted of constant plot, action, drama, and that it never lost it's touch all throughout it's 24 episodes.

  Season 1 had a lot of thin plots and the energy of the show wasn't quite up there yet as Season 2. The season did feature some of the greatest episodes of Vice such as the superb pilot and the exciting two two-parters of Calderone's Return and Golden Triangle. Out of all 22 episodes, there was only one episode that I didn't like and that was The Maze. Here is a list of the five best episodes of Season 1.

  1. Pilot

  2. Calderone's Return- Part 1

  3. The Great McCarthy

  4. Smuggler's Blues

  5. Milk Run

  I can't wait for Season 2 to come out on dvd. I have heard rumors that it will be released in December. Season 2 has the greatest Miami Vice episode of all time. The very exciting action packed season opener The Prodigal Son.

  The overall quality of Season 1 on dvd, most of the episodes look very crisp and clear. Only about a few are a bit grainy.

There is though a problem with the 5.1 surrond sound in a few episodes. Especially, in The Maze which has terrible sound in the opening sequence. Let's hope that Universal get's it right for Season 2 and throws away the idea of double sided disks and more stronger packaging.",1111363200,4,2246,4.321342925659472
1450595,5,B00005JLEY,"What can I say, VICE defined a decade and a generation. 1984, I was fifteen years old and never spent much time in front of the tube. Who had time? To much was going on outside, especially on a friday night after the week was over. Then It happened. Not a soul was outside one Friday night, the buzz earlier that day was that some new TV show was coming on that night. I really didn't pay it that much attention and didn't care! (Had girls on the brain) So I went in the house, jumped up on the bed, kicked back and tuned in to see what the hype was all about. When the end credits rolled and I picked up my jaw, an impression was made forever. I just purchased this DVD set and there was just one scene I had to see first which appeared in the Pilot, not an episode, a scene! The one and only scene that defined VICE for decades to come. A scene where not much at all was said between Philippe Michael Thomas and Don Johnson because of an eerie song pumping in the background followed by Phil Collins haunting voice (In The Air Tonight) that put you right there with them. Their faces, serious and cold, two vice cops with two separate vendettas but one gold, cruising down the Miami strip at night with one thought in mind, Calderone. Tubbs loads his shotgun while Crocket whips the Ferrari Daytona Spyder in and out of traffic.

For awhile I feared it would never see the day of light, because the heavy use of original music. I had read not that long ago 'Vice's DVD debut would be long in coming due in part to the issue of music licensing that would have to be paid out.
Glad to say, all 20 episodes have remained intact as I recall them. Each and every episode brings back a lot of memories. I know some people ""goofed"" on the show but in my opinion the first season of Miami Vice ranks up there as one of the best ever on television. Exotic locales, fast cars, shoots outs, beautiful women, great fashion and great music. Don Johnson, Philip Michael Thomas and Edward James Olmos were complimented by a great supporting cast. Fleshing out the cast were the recurring roles of character actors, Martin Ferrero and Charlie Barnett as Izzy Moreno and Noogie respectively.  Both actors gave the show comic relief to offset the frequent dark storylines.
Miami Vice will be forever etched in my mind. Like clockwork, I recall watching the show on Friday night's, while getting ""dressed"" up to go clubbing. I still have many of these originally aired vice episodes from season one on VHS. Now I can toss those to the trash to make more room on my DVD shelf. I eagerly await for season 2 to be released (soon I hope). To gear up for that I just watched the season 2 premiere ""Prodigal Son"" on VHS.",1109980800,4,1494,4.374100719424461
1450661,4,B00005JLEY,"Season 1 of Miami Vice on DVD deserves praise for getting the most important aspect of the show - the soundtracks that made this (as NBC head Brandon Tartikoff put it) ""MTV Cops"" - licensed and in their original places in the series.  I'm taking off a star for less-than-robust features, so-so video transfer, and a Dolby Digital 5.1 remastering that seems only halfhearted, but this is a must for any child of the 80s.

It's hard to believe its been 20 years since you had a choice of going to a lame high school party on Friday night or staying in and watching Miami Vice.  As they discuss in one of the DVD features, what's striking about season 1 is how just how bad the first 5-6 episodes were - when the show nearly got cancelled.  (I'd fortunately forgotten the highlight of them - the Sonny Crockett-Gina Calabrese relationship.  Awful.)  Only after Edward James Olmos brought his taciturn presence to boss unrestrained supercops Crockett and Tubbs and the writers started getting more outlandish with the bad guys did the pace here start picking up.  Thus, for most fans only Discs Two and Three contain the 'real' Miami Vice that you remember so fondly.  While 20 years later some of the fashion simply makes you laugh, some of the characters (the informants especially) are very non-PC and could easily make you cringe a bit.  But it's ok, that was television in the 80s; I guess the vast wasteland has progressed on some fronts.

What's more important is that unlike several recent TV-to-DVD transfers (Keen Eddie being the most heartbreaking of them) the heart of the show - the soundtrack - is completely intact.  Phil Collins ""In the Air Tonight"" and Glenn Fry's ""Smuggler's Blues"" give the full aura of the chase sequences.  Unlike later years, though, the soundtrack to season 1 is mostly top 40 and didn't take a whole lot of chances.  (The Pointer Sisters ""I'm So Excited"" is not exactly cutting edge, although watching the Solid Gold dancers is worth the laugh factor.)  But props to the producers to get the licenses without a problem.

The reason this is 4 stars rather than 5 is because there are a number of things that could have been better for the DVD production.  First, the three features aren't particularly meaty and it's probably worth taking off a star alone for the 'feature' that is an ad by the Miami Chamber of Commerce.  Commentary by actors or writers (several of whom certainly could use the work!) would have been cheap and easy.  Second, the video transfer is so-so.  I would have expected at least a token effort at digital cleanup, which clearly didn't take place.  Finally, the DD 5.1 remastering wasn't particularly well done.  Only in a few episodes (and the annoying race car during the video menu) do we get sound effects like gunshots and crickets out of the rear speakers where dialogue is always center channel and music always L-R.  Wouldn't have taken much effort to improve that.

as Crisp and clean as when I first saw it back during the 1980's.
Don Johnson and Philip Michael Thomas are perfect match for
each other. Edward James Olmos is the perfect authority figure
as the LT.Olivia Brown and Saundra Santiago are sexy yet firm.
Visually the Cinematogrphy is superb. Miami and all its Beauty
are brought right into your living room. I like the fact that
they utilize a different Director and writer for each episode.
It gives the Series a new look for each and every show. Musically
the Dolby 5.1 surround sound is very good. I do recommend that
you try to run your DVD player through a good Stereo System
with good Speakers to really appreciate the DVD set as I did.
I have Polk audio speakers which are digitally ready operating at
over 22,000Hertz. So I hear all sounds on the frequency spectrum.
Miami is the closest we have to a pice of Paradise here in the
United States,this series was way ahead of its Time,and still
comes accross that way after all these years. With guest stars
like Bruce Willis,Jimmy Smits and Pam Grier. And Musical guests
Phil Collins and Tina Turner,and Jan Hammer this is a Classic
Collectors item. Buy this DVD set,it also has Extras that you will
enjoy. Philip Michael Thomas Jamaican accent will make you laugh by the way,the Don Johnson Crocodile is very funny.",1109894400,,1382,4.59919028340081

The 5.1 is pristine, and the soundtrack is COMPLETELY in tact as I remember the show.

I was a little miffed at the two sided DVDs, but that is negligible.

I was taken right straight back to summer of 85 (rerun season) when I watched the second part of ""Calderone's Return."" The opening montage with Crockett and Tubbs on the Scarab with Russ Ballard's ""Voices"" thumping in the background just gave me goose bumps... Thank You Universal

Unfortuatly, he used the same production values in both.  In Manhunter, boom mics can be seen in two or three scenes and problems in the editing room show highly noticable mistakes.  Concerning Vice,  the digiatal transfer on this set is, let's face it, sub-standard.  Grainy title sequence, color changes, etc...all problems that could have been fixed before the dvd's were pressed, we're not.  The show, while entertaining as hell, had its share of problems too.  Horrible editing, plot holes, and some of the worst acting ever. Tubb's Jamaician accent still kills me to this day!  That still doesn't deter me from loving this show then and now.

1450732,3,B00005JLEY,"I have been a Vice fan from show 1 in 1984, so I was quick to get out and buy a copy. I am happy with the box set, overall, as I enjoy the show, but have a few reservations about the DVDs.

First off, the transfer from film to DVD is a bit shoddy on this one. There is no clean up of film stock that has been lying around for quite some time, which is evident in the color shifts from time to time. This will probably not be very noticeable to most viewers, but caught my attention. (I have a degree in film and video, which causes me to start paying attention to technique when I lose the moment - an annoying habit, according to my wife).

Second, the gaps for commercials should have been reduced or eliminated (not always possible, due to fade in). There are times when the couple of seconds feels like an eternity.

About the show: Looking back, I can see I was enamored with a show that had a few logical leaps. :-) After all, how can Vice cops continue to bust such high profile people and not get fingered? But, you quickly get into the world of Vice and forget that some of it does not make perfect sense. The chemistry between the actors is what really made Vice anyway.

In the first few episodes, you get to see actors' flubbed up lines make it into the show. I venture a guess that the budget was much tighter during the first season, forcing a few allowances. It gets better as the season continues, however.

The episodes on the disk:

1. Pilot episode (2 hours) - one of my favorites. Tubbs comes in as a New York street cop who is carrying a large sum of cash and sporting a Jamaican accent. The show has one of the better chase scenes in the season and shows how Vice's mixture of cinematography and pop music was a hit. Guest stars a very young Jimmy Smits as Crockett's first partner. Watch for the hitman, who is resurrected as Izzie, an informant, later in the season.

2. Heart of Darkness - One of the weaker episodes, dealing with child pornography and a possible rogue FBI agent (played by Ed O'Neill - Married with Children).

3. Cool Running - Interesting story about a group of Jamaican's knocking off buyers at drug deals. Contains one of the most annoying, yet endearing characters from the first season: Noogie.

4-5. Return of Calderone I & II - Some people absolutely love this episode, but I find it rather banal. In this one, Calderone is knocking off people who have crossed him and Sonny is on the list. Crockett and Tubbs end up in the Bahamas where Tubbs falls in love with Calderone's daughter, in one of the weakest plot twists.

6. One-Eyed Jack - The episode that introduces Edward James Olmos as Lt. Castillo. Denis Farina also costars.

7. No Exit - A dealer is selling Stinger missles and Crockett and Tubbs must get together with the FBI to stop him.

8. The Great McCarthy - Neat boat action in this smuggling story. This is the one that introduces Izzie Moreno, Crockett and Tubbs favorite informant. Fun story.

9. Glades - Crockett and Tubbs search for a witness who escaped from protective custody when his daughter was kidnapped. Interesting ending in the middle of the Everglades.

10. Give a Little, Take a Little - Crockett is thrown in jail for refusing to name an informant. Gina and Trudy must take down the crime boss to help get Sonny out of jail. Return of Noogie in this episode.

11. Little Prince - Crockett works to give a drug dealer's son a new lease on life after Vice arrests him to get to the father.

12. Milk Run - Two naive college kids get thrown into the middle of the action when they smuggle drugs into the country for a high volume dealer.

13 - 14. Score and Golden Triangle - Castillo (Olmos) is brought to the forefront in this story which deals with a drug smuggling Vietnamese general who kidnapped Castillo's wife many years prior. One of the better shows of the season.

15. Smuggler's Blues - Watch for Glenn Frey (singer of the song) in this episode about a group of guys who are hijacking smugglers. One of the better music blends of the season.

16. Rites of Passage - A Tubbs centered episode, in which Tubbs tries to help the sister of an ex-girlfriend out of the drug and prostitution business. Look for John Turturo in this one.

17. The Maze - Hostage crisis in an apartment building. Tubbs is one of the hostages and Sonny has to barge in to save his life.

18. Made for Each Other - A Zito and Sweitek episode that features both Izzie and Noogie.

19. The Home Invaders - The detectives get transferred to robbery for a short stint to investigate a string of home invasion robberies. Features a young Esai Morales.

20. Nobody Lives Forever - Sonny's new girlfriend changes his lifestyle and almost ruins the team.

21. Evan - One of the best episodes of the first season. This one deals with an over-the-edge ATF agent (former Vice cop) who nearly messes everything up in a Vice arms deal.

22. Lombard - Sonny and Rico must keep an informant alive to testify.

Extra Features:

The transfer quality is weak, even weaker than the show, with noticeable pixelation in some of the pieces. A true Vice fan will excuse it, as the extras detail how the show came about, the music, etc.",1109116800,9,5178,4.411764705882353
1450733,5,B00005JLEY,"This package is exactly what I hoped for.  I was a huge Miami Vice fan and I've been waiting for this set for years.  I'm glad they took the time to do it right.

I have only one complaint, but it's something that bugs me.  They changed the names of the 4th and 5th Episodes.  This was done back then they started showing them on cable, but I hoped this would be fixed on this set.  For the record, the titles are NOT Calderone's Return Part 1 and Part 2!  The first episode was called 'The Hit List' and the second was called 'Calderone's Dream'.  This shows up in two places - the easiest to find is Jan Hammer's 'Escape from Television' CD in which he referes to 'Crockett's Theme' as having first aired in 'The Hit List'.  The other is the novelization of these two shows (titled Miami Vice - The Vengance Game).  That book also referes to the two episodes in question by their original names.

I don't know if any other names were changed - I don't think so, but it annoys me that these two were.  But that is not enough for me to take a star from the rating.  Miami Vice deserves all the credit it gets.",1109116800,2,1109,4.1745283018867925
1450734,5,B00005JLEY,"I have waited 20 years for Miami Vice to arrive to DVD. After watching all the episodes on this DVD (Season 1), I almost shed a tear. The music sounds brilliant if you have surrond sond with a sub. If you have a larger TV with HD/Digital inputs you will notice dirt/flakes during the theme song. Universal/MCA obviously didn't consult George Lucas on how to digitally correct an old film ( See Star Wars Episode 4). Also, some episodes are crisper then others.

My favourite episodes are Smuglers Blues (Glen Frey rocks) and Rites of Passage ( where we see some model/hooker on the show do enough blow to ski down).  I did find it hard to stomach watching Al Bundy kick the crap out of some deadbeat in episode 2 or 3.  My biggest complaint on the original show is how wimpy the guns sounded.  Crockets Berretta and Tubs shotgun sound like firecrackers, thankfully Universal has enhanced the sounds on some of gun battles.

Also, some of the scenes are longer then the rereleases to cable in the 90's. Don Johnson is the coolest hetrosexual male ever to wear pastel shirts and  pants. And,  if all of Crockets clothes are seized from Govt drug seizures, whose the drug dealer that had like 40 Versace/Gucci outfits that fit Crocket exactly.

to reply bening that we cannot dupe 2 posts for 1 item reviewed..There was a post about a DVD pause or skip in the Pilot episode, ...Yes there is a pause right before Crockett unloads on Wheeler for betraying his trust, but on my PC DVD ROM and my DVD player it is a non issue...it is a brief slowdown and does not give any read errors or unrecognized disc on both my DVD ROM on my pc and my DVD player on my home theater system, by far not an issue that would deter me from having bought the series. and it won't ruin anyone else's in my opinion

if you are playing this on a PC's DVD rom I have 1 suggestion, as i took it from someone that offered me advice when i got a Bond movie with a horrendous skip..if you are using this DVD on your PC ..GET UPDATED software of your DVD player, i got WINDVD 6 & Power DVD's most updated releases..solved alot of issues i had with other DVD's when they jump to other layers on the disc.

i also have no issues with Phil Collins song , while crocket & tubbs are driving to get calderon...

**now back to my original review..

everything that was wronged by the LIMITED VHS set that Columbia House had a few years back is rightfully RIGHTED with this DVD SET!!!

1. originally i thought columbia house was gonna put out the entire series on VHS...they never did and only had a few choice episodes..Ironically none from the $h**i*t 5th season that was the only plus . Was upset with the limited set.

2. the music was altered, episodes on the VHS SET killed it without the original tunes.

on the the present--MAKE NO MISTAKE for every VICE fan out there that has their NBC / USA Network / and TNN tapes depreciating THE DVD SET IS A MUST accept no other complaints from pet peeves, this set is great....the only drawback is

****NO WIDE SCREEN**** its all full screen..but what the hell it is finally on DVD!!!

THE DVD season 1 was a joy to watch the episodes again remastered, and beat any VHS copy i still have in my closet. EVEN those from columbia house..as they say on music CD's
""the remastering is limited to the quality of the original source tape"" to me this is a very acceptable series on DVD that they are putting together.

For the record Year 2 of Miami Vice was its most sucessfull run and that alone will be worth its weight in gold when it hits DVD.

Year 1 : showed its sparks of brilliance !!

Year 2 : by far the Series Best!! the New York episode is a part of year 2 ..Another Calderon Episode.

Year 3 A few sparks in some key episodes, otherwise a darker tone. Including the New Car, Larry's Death Crockett getting into the mind of a Cat Burglar and yet 1 more Calderon episode.

Year 4 Some good episodes i'd say handfull of good episodes , money was lining the stars pockets as their bellies began to gain weight!! an episode on Trafficing Bull Semen and another one that featured a Reggae Star in cryogenic freeze were hillarious!! Crockett Marries here..and The stalker episode here was good, made the VHS cut from columbia house.

Year 5 FORGET ABOUT IT!! DOWNWARD SPIRAL HERE!!only the recovery from Memory loss and the Series Finale are the episodes I remember.

Get the DVD, feel the Hype all over again!!! I await SEASON 2 !!!",1108857600,,3321,4.279552715654952

1450738,2,B00005JLEY,"There is a problem with disc 1 side A at 1:22:56.  It occurs right when Sonny glares at Wheeler while they are sitting in the car.  The picture freezes for half a second and then resumes.  More disconcerting though is that after playing it a few times, the video would freeze for a few seconds and then skip to where Calderone reaches for the gun in his waistband.  I could no longer position the disk anywhere in the skipped area.  Reinserting the disk did not fix the problem (this is on a high-end Sony player).  On a DVD player from a different manufacturer, the DVD gets a media read error at the problem spot.

I returned the DVD set as defective and got another one.  The freeze again occurs at 1:22:56.  It resumes, but I'm worried the disk will eventually exhibit the skip problem.  I also don't like that this defect occurs just before my favorite part of the episode, when ""In the Air Tonight"" plays while Sonny and Rico are driving.

How widespread is this problem?",1108857600,10,977,4.463276836158192

The biggest plus to this collection is that the original music is featured and it sounds better than ever now that it is on DVD.

In the pilot episode, Crockett and Tubbs are on there way to the showdown with Calderone and the song ""In The Air Tonight"" by Phil Collins is playing. This sounds so great on DVD, its like your in the car with them, with the radio blasting. I don't have surround sound but for those of you who do, it will sound even better.

I am pleased to say that everything lives up to the bill. While a few minor scenes were cut, most of that had already been down for the networks upon reairings.

The music, 80's and pastels rock! ""Smugglers Blues"" is my fav!

Some bummers: Bonus material is pretty scarce, and the set up sucks..front and back of three cds, with no way of figuring out the episodes until you get into it. Nice packaging, but the CDs and formatting of order need some work!",1108684800,,586,4.457943925233645
1450791,4,B00005JLEY,"Hard to believe it has been more than 20 years since this show debuted.  And now, 20 years later, it still has much of the same freshness and reality to it, though it is unquestionably sanitized in comparison to the newer police dramas.

The wait was worth it, as they've remixed the shows in 5:1 sound.  Hard to beat that!  All the original songs from the original tv show have also been carried over so you get your Phil Collins and your U2 and your Peter Gabriel and your one-hit wonders like Russ Ballard.  The colors are still vibrant and the picture quality is mostly very good, though there are times when the shots are a bit fuzzy.  As for the shows themselves?...

The pilot movie is still a good watch.  It's well acted and filmed, and sets the early benchmark for the ""cool factor"" that would dominate the show's 5 year run.  However, the first few shows after that come across more as your standard cop show only with style.  Mostly, you come to realize that this is the result of having a stereotypical lieutenant who is always on Crockett's (Don Johnson) case for not going by the book.  How completely unoriginal.  There is also the overuse of the novelty that is Crockett's ownership of Elvis the Alligator.  Fortunately, once the lieutenant is killed and replaced by the new guy Castillo (Edward James Olmos), the show really starts to find its own place.  Castillo is unlike any police lieutenant or captain in any tv show before Miami Vice.

Season One is anything but perfect.  There are no less than 4 episodes that concentrate too much on the love lives of Crockett and/or Tubbs (Philip Michael Thomas).  For such a seeming playboy, we learn that Tubbs takes about 5 minutes to fall in love with any girl that speaks to him and looks good, and that gets pretty old pretty fast.  Fortunately, one of these episodes (Calderone's Return Pt. II) relegates the romance to a subplot and results in a thrilling climax.  We also have one episode that focuses on Switek and Zito's personal misadventures.  It has its moments, but is mostly just an episode that blows over.  Yet some stumbles are to be expected in a first season because you have to develop your characters and you have to experiment to find out what works and what doesn't.  In that respect, Season Two should offer more.

One of the funny things to watch for throughout Season One are the cameos and guest stars.  Bruce Willis, Ed O'Neill, Pam Grier, Dennis Farina, John Turturro, and a nearly unrecognizeable Ving Rhames are among those who star in these early episodes.  Willis and Farina in particular really sink their teeth well into the roles.  Another thing you're sure to notice is that rarely is there a scene where Crockett is without a cigarette.  He smokes like a chimney, something that is oh so taboo on the TV in this day and age.

The acting in general is pretty solid from the top guys.  Don Johnson is just the epitome of cool.  What's amazing is that he pulls off the manliness thing in spite of usually dressing like a ""fashionably conscious"" (i.e. extremely gay) male.  Tubbs' character is a bit too one dimensional, but more than adequate as the supporting guy.  Castillo steals the show with his understated performances.  There are times when episodes are bogged down by the poor acting of bad guys or secondary characters like Crockett's girlfriend, but these can occurances can generally be overlooked.

The plots were often redundant, yet I didn't grow tired of them then and don't tire of them now.  The seedy drug smugglers were an element that was truly unique to Miami, particularly in the 80s, and this show capitalizes on that.  It offered TV an entirely new line of possible plots as a result, and more importantly comes across as believable.  You just can't do a good South American smuggling plot if your show is based in Mayberry or Chicago or even NYC or LA.  It fits much better in Miami.

And on that note, that's about as much as can be said for Season One.  It is imperfect, it is sometimes hokey, but it is, in the end, Miami Vice.  It is its own show and remains original.  Highlight episodes are the pilot, Calderone's Return Part II, No Exit, Smuggler's Blues, Lombard.  Less than stellar episodes include Cool Runnin', Golden Triangle Parts I and II (Castillo in a speedo!), and Nobody Lives Forever.",1108684800,,4328,4.639473684210526

1450793,5,B00005JLEY,"Overall, this long awaited season set, is awesome!

The picture quality is 8 out of 10 (as an owner of a big TV screen I can't complain) bearing in mind the age of the series. Colors are also well transferred-there are no fading edges. As the first season was a training field for the crew and colors were not driven to perfection yet as in following seasons two and three, one can only imagine how impressive later episodes must look on DVD.

The sound is good although it's of course remixed 5.1 and does not fully match the latest 5.1 movie releases on DVD.

The menus including the short episode summaries are not perfect but satisfying and much better than those of other TV series (come on, who bought this set for the menus?).

Now, the few minor flaws: apart from the thin bonuses (that are too short and mostly stock footage or old news for real fans), the double sided discs are annoying. Not only that they are more problem-prone than usual one sided discs, you have also check back with the cover all the time to see where a specific episode can be found. 6 one sided discs with a nice design and the episode titles on the surface would have been better and would have left more data storage per episode. In some episodes, camera sweeps are a bit jerky sometimes. That may be a result of the fully crammed discs. Bottom line: my expectations (I'm hardcore fan and episode master of the German VICE fan site) have been met fully. If the other seasons come out with the same quality, I'm gonna be the first to buy gladly.",1108684800,,1531,4.418439716312057

Excellent production and packaging, good extra features, no commercials, the visual quality is pristine, and ALL THE ORIGINAL MUSIC.... in 5-channel stereo.... However, all that stuff just made 'Vice good, not great.

Miami Vice's greatness is how a group of (face-it) average actors happened to find the roles of their lives and crafted unique and complex characters and relationships. This took a while and did not happen in Season One, with its run-of-the-mill ""Bad Guy"" plots. I am really looking forward to Seasons Two and Three, the best in my opinion, when Vice's commercial success attracted creative writers, directors and guest stars, and when the main characters really found their groove and plumbed some psychological depths that you rarely see on TV. For an unconditional-Vice fan like me, Seasons Four and Five were a bit painful, the team was burning out, but I will still line up to buy those DVDs as soon as they are available.",1108598400,3,1071,4.820652173913044

1450797,3,B00005JLEY,"PROS: If you are looking to get your groove on Miami Vice will really stimulate your senses both visually and audibly. This was a television breakthrough from a technology perspective. This series also had a huge influence on fashion in the 80's. If you want the nostalgia or the history of the 80's you will like this series.

CONS: On the other hand, if your looking for deep, interesting characters and interesting screenplay writing this is not for you. Don Johnson is a sub par actor and his character is not believable. Even worse is Daniel Day Lewis who barely utters a word and is hardly given any dialogue to work with. He looks stone faced most of the time and never changes expression or gets too excited. One bright spot is Jimmy Smits. The screenplays seem to repeat themselves. Another drug bust, corrupt government, business, the quick buck, a broken heart, lots of violence and boat chases.  Yawn!",1108425600,,913,4.735849056603773
1450798,4,B00005JLEY,"I am referring to the video transfer.  Clearly, Universal was quick to release this thing after clearing the music rights, and it shows.  #1, most of the bonus material is simply clips of old interviews.  The last 'bonus' is just an advertisement for Miami tourism.  COME ON GUYS!!!  Give us a break -- the Moonlighting DVD is coming out soon and it's going to have TONS of new features, including audio commentary from Bruce Willis!

#2, they barely cleaned up the negative before the digital conversion.  I have an extremely large television, therefore every flaw is that much more prominent.  You can clearly see a lot of dirt, scratches and degradation in the film.  Luckily, the sound (given equal billing as the action) has been beefed up to Dolby 5.1 and the music has never sounded better.

The cars, the clothes, the action, even the occasionally cheesy dialogue, are all present!  It's great to see those guys back in action.  The leads work off one another so perfectly, that you never doubt their commitment to their job, or each other.  This show is just so much fun to watch, that it's almost addictive.  Imagine the best 45-minute music video you've ever seen and you have some vague understanding of this show's appeal.  I recently had a friend over who'd never seen the show.  We were talking and weren't paying particular attention to the television, but I had one of the DVDs playing.  She kept stopping every 5 minutes to say - ""this music is awesome.""  And she was just talking about Jan Hammer's score!  To say nothing of all the great popular songs that got used to their fullest effect.

The show really hits its stride in the second season.  By then, the producers were extremely confident that Don and Philip's charisma could carry the show.  So the episodes got more self confident and somber.  Let's PRAY that the great sales of Season 1 encourages Universal to spend some real $ on Season 2 before releasing it.

But I can't really complain too much - I am happy just to ad this groundbreaking series to my collection.

There is a scene missing in ""calderones return"" (originally called HIT LIST ON NBC)between a drug dealer and his girlfriend about parachute pants. The episode called ""the great mccarthy"" also has cut the sex scene between Tubbs and Vanessa. That episode was controversial in its first airing in 1984; it was deemed to ""sexual"" for prime-time tv. It was too provacative. When the rerun came up; it was cut back dramatically and Tubbs barely touches her and only kisses her. The cut scene is the one on the dvd release. I'm dissapointed by this; this is not prime time. People don't have to watch this; they choose to buy it or not; so why not release the series on the dvd format the way it was first broadcast. I'm curious to see what else has been cut.

1450853,2,B00005JLEY,"The best cop show of the 80's was 'Hill Street Blues'. 'Miami Vice' was ground breaking in terms of production values. The nostalgia of the Miami Vice music videos - which like it or not seemed to dominate my life in the 80's as I couldn't get away from Vice and MTV jamming some no talent bums like 'Asia' or 'Men at Work' down my throat - is the only value I see in this set. As far as characters and story lines forget it. Miami Vice was weak on acting, writing, directing, producing but big on music videos and explosions. Look elsewhere. Hill Street Blues is the cop show with the most award winning writers, actors, directors, producers, everything a great TV show is supposed to be. Miami Vice was 80's excess, fluff, MTV. Yuk! Watching this stuff again makes me sick. Most of the pop music chosen for Miami Vice is horrible. Glen Frey's 'Smuggler Blues'? Phil Collin's 'Something in the Air'? Gimme a break. Two of the worst songs ever written. That is not the best the 80's had to offer. These songs were incorporated into the show long after they became hits on the radio. Pete Townsend's 'Face the Face' for example, was hardly his best effort. Don't waste your time reliving this garbage.",1108425600,4,1200,4.509174311926605

This set comes with no supplemental text - no hard-copy episode summary, no list of guest stars - nada. There IS an on-screen summary of episodes on the first screen of each, but for those of us without 20/20 vision or ginormous televisions, this is next to impossible to read - AND it's just not detailed enough.

Michal Mann stikes Gold here and if you have never seen this Television trend setter before then you have really missed something. The DVD will make you an addict immediately and you will want to see more. The transfer is very good and the series appears to be timeless despite fashions that are no longer in vogue. The music is of course, the main ingredient in setting atmosphere to party scenes and private thoughts. It is also one of the only series that had criminals who are memorable because they represent the dangerous, hidden, and seemingly untouchable element of society that is always the true source of the supply and demand world of drug culture. Perhaps this fact, along with all of the other things mentioned, make this one of the best cop shows ever to run on television. The series had a pattern. Generally season one had investigative pursuits that had mixed results, criminals were arrested but some got away or got off in light sentencing. Season two had criminals who committed suicide rather than be arrested and later editions featured criminals who went out in a glorious hail of gunfire much to our delight! Get it! Buy it!

1450856,5,B00005JLEY,"Thank you to the powers that be for releasing the greatest cop show in the history of cop shows, in its original form, WITH THE ORIGINAL MUSIC INTACT.  The picture transfer and sound are above average, and the extras(interviews and documentaries) and menus are outstanding.  Michael Mann (Heat, Thief, Manhunter, The Insider, Collateral) created this groundbreaking series(1984-1989) that still leaves its mark on all cop shows that came after it.  Shot and edited with an MTV flair, with music supplied by top stars(U2, Peter Gabriel, Tina Turner, Phil Collins) this series defined the edge of style both fashion, music, and most importantly...cool.  The central character is Sonny Crockett, played by Don Johnson.  Crockett is Miami's premier undercover vice cop, living life precariously on the edge of the law....all while wearing $3000.00 suits, living on a million dollar sailboat, racing a speedboat, and tearing up the streets in a black ""Ferrari"" convertable.  His rival-turned partner-turned best friend is Ricardo ""Rico"" Tubbs, played by Phillip Michael Thomas.  Tubbs is a New York Police Detective who comes to Miami in search of his brothers murderer, and winds up finding a new calling and home in the Miami-Dade area.  ""Crokett and Tubbs"" together become the bane of all criminals existance, and the darlings of GQ.  There is also a great supporting cast of characters.  The incomaprable Edward James Olmos is the stoic, stern, and ultra cool Lieutentant Castillo.  Saundra Santiago, and Olivia Brown portray Det. Gina Calabrese, and Det. Trudy Joplin.  Gina and Trudy serve as female counterparts to Crockett and Tubbs, and lend a female perspective to several episodes.  And last but not least, Michael Talbott, and John Diehl as the Laurel and Hardyesque Detectives Zito and Switek.  Add all of these components together and you get a viewing expereince that has to be experienced to be believed.

Aside from the style, cool, and flair the show exhibited.  One aspect of the show where it never received much recognition was the ground breaking social issues that the show seemed to tackle every episode without coming across as gratuitous, or exploitative.  Running the gamut from homophobia, sex crimes and their aftermaths, child abuse, crooked cops, to the IRA, the show did its part to crack the social walls that where well in place during the 80's.  The look, and the topics may be dated or passe, but this show helped make them that way.  Please release more seasons soon.  So break out you white linen blazer, your brown loafers(no socks necessary) and your purple sleeveless shirt, and enjoy this viewing experience until Crockett and Tubbs peel away in the Ferrari for  the last time.",1108252800,5,2714,5.122727272727273

  The picture quality varies to some extent, but overall is very good and crisp.  There are some major artifacts on the master used, but its not too distracting.  There are definitely a few spots of dirt that should have been restored.

  The most important thing is that all the music is here and these episodes are totally uncut.  I watched the extra of the music of Miami Vice and the interviews with Jan Hammer are excellent.

The biggest points are 1) It's great that Universal put the money into securing the rights to all the original music from the show; 2) The video NEEDS to be cleaned up -- it's very dirty and gritty; 3) An episode guide insert ABSOLUTELY should be included -- this is the first TV show DVD set I've ever bought that didn't have one, either as separate printed matter or right on the packaging; and 4) Universal should either do one-sided discs in the future, or they should configure them so they run sequentially without constant flipping.  For instance, this set is sequenced:

Disc 1, Side A  ep. 1-2

Disc 1, Side B  ep. 3-6

Disc 2, Side A  ep. 7-10...which necessitates flipping discs constantly to watch in sequence.

A more convenient configuration would be:

Disc 1, Side A  ep. 1-2

Disc 2, Side A  ep. 3-6

Disc 3, Side A  ep. 7-10...then one flip of all three discs gets you to...

Disc 1, Side B  ep. 11-14, etc.  This would work a hell of a lot better for those who have multidisc carousel players, which I suspect is most DVD owners.  Owners of single-disc players don't have much choice about it, though.",1108166400,4,1158,4.480769230769231

The pristine episodes, in full movie stereo sound (stereo sound only can in the middle of the series) shown at their full running speed, not compressed for time so they can get more commercials in.

1450913,4,B00005JLEY,"Though I've only watched two episodes on this DVD set thus far (the pilot episode and ""Smuggler's Blues""), I think I can safely write a review for ""Miami Vice:Season One"". There's no doubt that ""Miami Vice"" was an influential slice of 80's culture; however, Season One is by far the best season of the show. As much as I loved the first season, the second season quickly became formulaic, and by the third season, I had stopped watching altogether. So, should Universal Studios decide to release subsequent seasons of the show, I doubt I'll buy them.

Which brings me to other issues. First, Universal has once again done a poor job with the video transfer. Of the two episodes I've watched, neither look great, though nighttime scenes appear to be clearer. Universal just seems to rush the product out for a quick buck, without much concern on video quality. If anyone has seen the DVD's of ""Animal House"", ""The Breakfast Club"" or any other pre-90's film or show distributed by Universal, you know I am correct in my arguement. I will say that keeping the original music for each episode intact is a major coup-de-gras, though Universal probably recognized that the DVD wouldn't have much selling value without it.

Another problem, again probably demonstrated by the make-a-quick-buck mentality at Universal, is a complete lack of interviews with cast members. I'd like to know the opinions of Don Johnson, Philip Michael Thomas, and Edward James Olmos, among others, and what it meant for them to be part of such a groundbreaking program. No such luck. What is offered are a few words from series creator Anthony Yerkovich, and some old ""Today"" show interviews. There are a couple of nice nuggets, though. I was surprised to learn that the show was nominated for 15 Emmys in it's first season, and also that NBC did not want Don Johnson to be part of the show, as he had previously starred in six failed TV pilots. Nonetheless, the bonus material could have been much more comprehensive.

""Miami Vice"" is rumored to be returning to the big screen in 2006, so it's obvious that it's appeal has sustained for the last 20 years. This DVD of Season One will hopefully introduce a younger generation to it's ""coolness"", though I hope Universal will do a better job with later seasons. I'm rating the DVD four stars for the show content, but the extras need help. Universal, are you getting this?",1107993600,8,2393,4.77536231884058

1450919,4,B00005JLEY,"Like it or hate it, Miami Vice was a show, perhaps THE show that best defined the excesses of the 1980's.  Produced in the heart of that period from 1984 to 1989, Miami Vice would become an influence in music, film, and fashion...much to the chagrin of those men who will refuse to admit to wearing pastels themselves.  The show ffocused on the Miami Metro-Dade police ""Vice"" department and it`s continued battle against the illicit drug, prostitution, and firearms crime underworld of the city of Miami.

Of course it's most well-known for it's two chic stars Don Johnson as Sonny Crockett and Philip Michael Thomas as Rico Tubbs.  They had the usual, sourfaced boss in Lt. Castillo played by Edward James Olmos.  The first season features 22 episodes beginning with the series premiere ""Brother's Keeper"" in which NY Cop Tubbs comes to Miami to team with a reluctant Crockett to solve a series of murders surrounding a Columbian Drug kingpin.

Other first season episodes of note:

""One Eyed Jack"" this episode introduced Olmos as Lt. Castillo.

""Glades""  Crockett and Tubbs have to journey into Florida's everglades to find a prosecution witness scheduled to testify in 48 hours.

""Give a Little , Take a Little""  Crockett is thrown in jail for refusing to identify an informant.

""Smuggler's Blues""  Crockett and Tubbs pose as drug smugglers in order to nail the person responsible for killing drug dealers and their families.  Of course features the hit song Smugglers Blues by Glen Frey.

""Lombard""  Crockett and Tubbs must protect a crime boss who is scheduled to testify against the mob.

Miami Vice is one of those shows that while great in its time, doesn't age well.  It certainly isn't as gritty as some of our more modern day cop dramas like NYPD Blue or Law & Order.  It was perfect for the time however, a big, loud, colorful, over-the-top action drama with two good looking guys and a lot of eye candy.  One disappointment is the minimal special features on the DVD set.  Couple of short featurettes, but nothing to write home over.

A Classic 1980's show!",1107907200,7,2072,4.810198300283286
1450920,5,B00005JLEY,"As a long-time Miami Vice fan who experienced the original shows in the 80's, then in syndication, the two Pilots on laser disc, and the overpriced Columbia House VHS set, it's great to finally experience it on a digital format like DVD in all it's authentic glory.

It was worth the wait for Universal to track down the rights to the original music. Russ Ballard's 'Voices' on 'Return of Calderon Part II' is a pivotal song that was replaced on the Columbia House tapes that makes all the difference in the world having it reinstated on these DVDs.

There have been reports comparing these DVD's to tapes of the original NBC broadcasts that there might be some slight discrepencies in missing incidental dialogue in 'Heart of Darkness',  'Calderon's Return' and 'Smuggler's Blues' which only die hard fans familiar with the original broadcasts would notice. I can appreciate such concerns, especially if a favorite bit of dialogue isn't present as you've experienced it in the past. But that's a can of worms that can be opened and explored on Miami Vice forums more appropriately and in better detail.

At $1.3 million per episode in the 80's, the show was shot on film, so the popular episodes and most of the opening titles are worse for the wear in terms of dust and scratches, but along with the increased resolution and crystal clear remixed surround track, it gives the First Season a grittier, authentic, cinematic feel that was lacking in previous releases. The color is filmlike while the pastel hues still come across as vibrant but not overly saturated, which produces a appropriately realistic feel. The overall effect complements Don Johnson's portrayal of Sonny Crockett as a world-weary troubled character continually struggling with upholding the law while living an undercover lifestyle associating with criminals as a means to a moral end. It seems like rediscovering Vice all over again, or at the very least seeing it in a new light, and appreciating it more as an historical artifact for attempting to bring cinematic sensibilities and creativity to the medium of TV. It's more apparent now what creative chances it took and how it succeeded. Each episode feels more like a movie than a TV show which is striking, and occasionally makes one wish it could have been 35mm widescreen despite the fact the compositions still work extremely well in a 4:3 frame.

True, it might be nice if they had cleaned-up the film (the looped clips used in the main menus are perfectly clean while a bit overly saturated) but in my home theater experience if they get the sound and music correct, then the picture can suffer a bit, as long as the inherent deficiencies are a result of film and not a digital video transfer, as would be the case in edge enhancement or pumped-up color saturation, so that's why it feels appropriate and doesn't bother me.

'Smuggler's Blues' looks almost like a misguided attempt at the bleach bypass technique they use with films today. Not sure if blown-out highlights and deep dark loss of shadow detail was intentional, but it's the only episode that looks that way, and it's hard to watch. My guess is they tried the technique in the early days and just didn't quite work. But those are the chances Vice took and it's all the better for it. 'Evan' was always a dark-looking episode and the DVD is also.

With so much time, effort and cost Universal probably put into securing the music rights, completely remastering the picture for an 18 hour 25 minute runtime would be understandably time consuming and expensive. Vice is 20 years old and has been run in syndication quite a bit, and other shows of that era may not have been shot on film or had as many prints struck for syndication, so in comparison other shows may look better on DVD. It probably would take quite a while to complete a restoration of the original film.

The only downside to increased resolution in the picture are the cheesy extra actors in the background they have to use for practical reasons in TV shows, which detracts from an otherwise cinematic attempt at taking TV up a notch.

But the setting of the city of Miami as a study in contrast of beauty and grit has never come across better than this DVD set.

The new 5.1 surround mix is crystal clear. Even though they remixed the surround to 5.1, technically they have to work with what they've got in the original source recordings. Dialogue stems are expectedly lower in volume than the music, since I believe the first season used a mono dialogue track whereas other seasons used stereo, but it works. It might turn you into a volume jockey but it's a nice mix. You get some discreet gunfire, panning car and helicopter sound effects from the rear channels in some scenes. It's an immersive mix.

The Foreigner song 'I Want to Know What Love Is' sounds a bit strange in an episode rarely played in syndication, 'Rites of Passage'. The vocals are perfect, but the accompanying music track sounds as though the tape wasn't running smoothly, like when you listen to a cassette tape that wants to run slower and then back to normal speed and slow again. Really odd. Perhaps that's why I never saw it on TNN in syndication. I suspect it's a defect in the source tapes, so this DVD transfer uses what was available after all these years.

The packaging and menu graphics are well-done. The episode list and descriptions are welcome. Universal's double-sided discs aren't the best. It does save space, but they can scratch more easily and attract more dust and hence are harder to clean. Disc art for a visual show like Vice would be welcome, however I did get a kick out of the appropriately hot pink silkscreen ink used on the inner text on each disc. An insert with a little bit of behind-the-scenes or critical commentary text would have been welcome.

The bonus features are short but informative. New interviews from the creator, and Jan Hammer, casting director and costumer are brief but informative. Those are complemented with concise archival interviews with Don Johnson, Philip Michael Thomas and Michael Mann. It's interesting to hear the costume designer talk about Don Johnson initially not wanting to wear pastels in favor of blue jeans and cowboy boots, until he appreciated how hot an humid it can get in Miami. Jan Hammer's score was created each week in a loft studio in upstate New York as shown. A little promo for Miami Tourism is expected. No new interviews with the cast, but Universal was probably working on a budget, not the least of which likely went into securing music rights. What bonus features they have presented is welcome.

Might not hurt to email Universal and let them know the inclusion of original music is appreciated by fans, and hopefully they will continue the effort for subsequent seasons.

Bottom line for this viewer and fan is that the overall enjoyment and experience is very satisfying. I can accept the inherent deficiencies for what they are, and appreciate Vice on DVD at long last. Overall it was worth the wait. This DVD set is effective to the point that I was wanting to pop in a disc and watch Season Two. I hope Universal takes their time and secures the music rights for at least the Second Season. If it's anything like this Season One set, it will also be worth the wait.",1107907200,20,7301,4.7377952755905515

An image of the cover on each disc would have made this set much cleaner. This is what kept me from giving it 5 stars. Stretching the discs to 5 or 6 would not have been any big deal.  The sound quality is great.  The 5.1 ratio is utilized to its full extent.  Only the opening introduction that displays the episodes in play all , or by scene is done in 2 channel stereo.  The rest is all 5.1 .  The only flaw I really noticed in the video transfer is the opening of each episode.  There is a small black splotch in the upper right corner during the overhead pan of the water.  I would like to see Universal release all the remaining Seasons not utilizing the double sided DVD and really cleaning up the transfer to not show any flaws.  For me it adds to the quality of the set. Putting the image of the cover on each disc would be great. It looks more complete and less like a DVD burn.",1107907200,7,1003,4.150259067357513

1450984,2,B00005JLEY,"I am a big fan of this TV series, and was waiting with great anticipation on this DVD release. While the content is as expected, the video and audio quality is nowhere near acceptable, I would assume there are millions of Miami Vice fans out there and Universal would expect this to be a big seller. As such, the time and money should have been spent to put out a quality product. The technology exists today for a quality cleanup of the existing prints to ensure a good transfer to DVD. If you have a nice system and/or a HD TV you will probably be disappointed in this release, Lots of grain and dirt/garbage in the transfer, Detail is soft. The DVD looks as if they transfered the originals with no cleanup or enhancement. I would have expected much more, as I assume this release to sell very well, DD 5,1? The sound is almost entirely located in the center channel alone, gives the effect of a mono release. I have seen DVD's of older movies, that video and audio quality wise blow away this release. Maybe we will get lucky and sales will still be strong, prompting Universal to do a better job if subsequent seasons are released. It's great to see these old episodes on DVD, but I was hoping for a quality that would bring this show back to life and give it the treatment it deserves,",1107820800,8,1291,4.383333333333334
1450985,5,B00005JLEY,"Wow, What a show. What A season!:)  MV Season One lives up to all the hype I read about the DVD release.  It was definitely worth the wait to have all 22 episodes with original music included in the episodes along with episode synopsies and original air dates.  Hard episodes  to find such as  The Great McCarthy, One Eyed Jack, and The Maze ar all here for the Vice fan, like me, to enjoy. It can be Friday night at 9 PM whenever I want  I am only disappointed with the set in two ways.

First, I wish Universal took the time to track down the original actors or other crew to do commentary on the pilot episode  It would have been nice to hear their thoughts & behind the scenes stories almost 20 years later.  I wish they had done in depth interviews with Switek(Sp?) and Zitto, or the actors who played the confidential informants Noogie, and Izzy.

Second, the Special Features don't really add much to the set, except for the featurette with Jan Hammer, the musical genius behind the show.  It's definetly worth the extra shipping money I spent to get it here.

According to an article I read on tvshowsondvd.com Universal might swap Vice's music for cheaper tracks in subsequent seasons to cut costs.  Columbia House did this with a few episodes when I bought them on tape, and they weren't the same episodes.  Let's all hope and pray that after the revenue from the sale of the Season One DVD comes in that Universal DOES NOT! cave in to the cost pressure.  My world is now complete.  I can enjoy all 22 uncut episodes with orginal music unedited.  If your a fan of Miami Vice, buy this set! :)",1107820800,7,1602,4.394557823129252
1450986,5,B00005JLEY,"Remember when quick jump cuts weren't used in television shows, or when the music was just background fodder for the characters to talk over, or when camera angles were always normal run of the mill shots? Yeah the storylines were great and the list of guest stars was amazing, but for sheer technical out-of-the-box thinking, nothing even comes close to Miami Vice. Almost single-handedly it changed the way action/drama television shows were shot, edited, and scored. Bring on Season Two!!",1107820800,4,491,5.15
1450987,3,B00005JLEY,"I've been waiting a long time for Miami Vice to be released. I loved the show back in the 80's and look forward to watching it again whenever I want. However, I do have a couple of complaints about the set.

First, no booklet to break down the episodes. Major goof there. All television show releases should have the episode breakdown so you know what is on each disc.

Second, I hate the double-sided disc. They are just a headache and I wish they would have put out six discs instead of three.

If your a fan of the show, this is for you. It's just unfortunate that they didn't make the set a little nicer.",1107820800,9,608,4.224137931034483
1450988,5,B00005JLEY,"When Dvd's first started coming out I started thinking about what television show I would most like to see on DVD?

The answer came quickly...MIAMI VICE. I couldn't think of a better show that could take advantage of the DVD's superior picture and sound than a show like MIAMI VICE. The show incorporated so many elements like music, action, and beautiful cinematography, and I couldn't understand why MIAMI VICE wasn't one of the first shows to be released on DVD. So I waited patiently. Now the wait is over... MIAMI VICE is on DVD and I couldn't be happier.

MIAMI VICE SEASON 1 went beyond all expectations. For starters, all of the original music has been aquired for this release. This was vital in making this a sucessful release. For anyone who has purchased 21 Jump Street or Wiseguy on DVD you know what a difference not having the original songs can make! I couldn't imagine Crockett and Tubbs not driving the Daytona to any other song other than Phil Collin's "" In The Air Tonight"". Now this classic scene is presented in Dolby 5.1 Surrond. AWESOME!!

I had previously bought the video releases of MIAMI VICE which had substituted some of the songs with different ones which was highly dissapointing. On this collection, all of the songs are the originals. THANK GOD!

Many fans agree that Season 1 of MIAMI VICE is the best, although some of the shows in later seasons I feel were even better. It was great to see how the VICE phenomonon all began. The pastels look brighter than ever on DVD. Michael Mann's awesome vision and cutting edge cinematography can be seen in these early episodes which are now echoed by his films like COLLATERAL and HEAT. Mann is a genious!

MIAMI VICE SEASON 1 has guest stars galore like Bruce Willis and Glenn Frey. There are also some outstanding performances from a few unknowns at the time  such as William Russ playing Evan in the episode of the same name. His performance in this episode is riveting! Russ would later play Roger Lococco in WISEGUY,a role which people stil remember him for to this day. And who can forget Ed O'Neil of Al Bundy fame in the episode HEART OF DARKNESS.

The extras on the DVD are great but a little too short. I would have enjoyed some audio commentary by Michael Mann or even

Don Johnson and Phillip Michael Thomas, but you can't have everything. You do get an interview with the shows creator, Anthony Yerkovitch which was great and also a piece on Jodie Tilden, the show's costume designer who Michael Mann still uses for his movies. Her eye for fashion changed the way we dressed in the 80's or at least for me.

Overall this was completely worth the wait, the only problem now is I have to wait agonizingly  for Season 2.",1107820800,6,2707,4.58592132505176
1450989,5,B00005JLEY,"The set just hit today, and I started to watch it.  First of all great value.  $40 for 22 episodes is a nice deal.

After watching reruns on USA Network, FX and TV land it is refreshing to see a nice clear picture.  The picture is just great.

The disks are double sided which holds all episodes on 3 disks.  You do have to flip them, but that is okay, every 4 hours you can get up from the couch to do that.

If you are a fan of the show, this is a great value, and outstanding set.  If you have never watched the show, it is a great way to see a slice of popular culture from the 80's.  Current fashion (sometimes really bad), most popular music from the time, and current and up and coming movie and television stars of that time, and even now.

The list of known stars, and famous songs is endless.

Great set.",1107820800,6,814,4.025

I'm definitely glad it's been released with ALL of the original music but for a DVD that's been in such high demand as this...I expected a lot more in regards to the video quality.  One of the best (worst?) examples of the poor video transfer is the opening credits scene for the pilot where you can see huge splotches of gunk from the original print.

1451041,5,B00005JLEY,"An innovative 80s icon, Miami Vice had it all...gritty police drama, adventure, a terrific soundtrack of current hit music, great costumes and actors who looked good wearing them. Vice cop and former football star Sonny Crockett lives on a yacht in the harbor with his pet alligator Elvis and busts drug dealers for a living while coping with both his ex-wife and his coworker girlfriend Gina. Rico, a rogue cop from New York bent on busting the evil Calderon, a drug lord responsible for the murder of his beloved brother, is the perfect partner for Sonny's sometimes loose-cannon actions. Every episode delivered thrills and sometimes unusual twists. And who can forget Rico and Sonny on their way to the showdown with Phil Collins' ""In The Air Tonight"" playing in the background?

For those who love the Grand Theft Auto: Vice City video game. Where do you think they idea came from? Don Johnson and Philippe Micheal Thomas play undercover narcotics cops in Miami. Also there are some special guess stars that came on the show like Bruce Willis, Wesley Snipes, etc...

1451046,5,B00005JLEY,"About time this comes out on DVD. This show was different in a lot of ways. First, the majority of cop shows have always taken place in NY, Chicago or LA. Miami looks totally different and has a little different scope of the crime that takes place there. Also, this show empahsized the thin line of 'friend and foe' far more than any other cop show before or since. And the fact that the bad guys sometimes got-off or got away a little more often puts a little twist on the show. I agree with other reviews though; if they substitute out the original music and put in generic music I am going to be very upset.

ANALOGY:

This show without the music is like a woman with a great body, beautiful face, and pretty smile but is bald. It just would not be the same. All of the components (Florida sun, cigarette boats, fast cars, intense storylines, and MUSIC) put together made this show what it was.

I hope they come out with the first 4 seasons on DVD soon. This show was the best cop show ever for it's first 3 seasons. The 4th season started its decline a little and the 5th we knew it was done.

We should also give Starsky & Hutch a little credit as partially a pioneer for this show: Two young(late 20's/early 30's), street-smart cops, who could blend in with the bad guys,(although this show didn't have the subtle humor). They too had to deal with that thin line of friend/foe as well.",1101427200,,1392,4.32183908045977
1451047,5,B00005JLEY,"I am a Miami Vice musicologist of sorts (not something I'm necessarily proud of); I have all of the music of MV memorized. I applied the acid test to this set which was to check and see if Russ Ballard's ""Voices"" was included in the episode ""calderone's return part II"". This was the song that was taken out of the original Columbia House VHS release. This is the hardest song to get, either by downloading or buying the cd. IT WAS THERE. So was the Tina Turner song at the end, which was also taken out of the VHS tapes. If these songs are there, IT MEANS ALL THE MUSIC IS THERE.

The transfer to dvd is awesome. There were a few artifacts in some of the scenes, but barely. Otherwise, it's crystal clear. Nice menus with the MV theme in the background are great. This set is AWESOME.

I can't believe they really got the rights to all the music. BUY THIS SET NOW. I don't give 5 star reviews easily...",1100476800,10,903,4.244186046511628

It is really ironic, or moronic that the RIAA has all this power to regulate what they sell and causing so much trouble that a classic like Miami Vice won't ever make it to DVD.

It is my sincere hope that they release the DVD with= ALL THE ORIGINAL MUSIC!  The music played a major factor in the plot and theme of each episode.  To edit that would completely defeat the purpose of releasing the DVD.  I have spent many hours building and creating my own Miami Vice mix's on CD.  In my opinion, this is some of the best music of the century.  Miami Vice is still my favorite TV series of all time.  I am a Public Safety Professional who has great respect for Michael Mann and company for the fantastic job they did on the 111 episodes. Miami Vice was one of the first police series that showed the reality of "" the good guys do not always win "".

In most cases of Miami Vice, in some way or another, one of the good guys usually lost, just like in real life.  Granted hollywood played a big part in the series as well, but that's the television business.  The last I have heard, Miami Vice 1st. season could be released as soon as January 2005.  I, for one, will be waiting patiently until then.  I hope they realize how important the music is for the show, and to keep it all original as this is the way it should be released.

Recent statements from the show's producers said they are dying to get this series on DVD, but considering the current demands from the original artists and the soundtrack, the cost of a single season of Miami Vice would sell between $900 and $1200!
What is being considered is to replace the original soundtrack with other songs or equivalent like music. This was done with the TV series Roswell and personally I believe they pulled it off quite well in that case. I don't know if I could accept a new soundtrack with Miami Vice though, as in most cases it is what made the episode.

1451157,5,B00005JLEY,"Miami Vice was ""the"" defining TV show of the 1980's.  Cars, clothes and film techniques abound in Michael Mann's stylistic cop drama.  The show had a tremendous influence on American cultural habits.  The guest stars and musical choices were always ""A"" list caliber.  In addition, certain episodes were outstanding and had great dramatic impact.  ""Evan"" from Season One (William Russ) and ""Out Where the Buses Don't Run"" from Season Two (Bruce McGill) were two such episodes.  ""The Home Invaders"" is also very reminiscent of Michael Mann's outstanding film ""Thief"" (James Caan).  This series MUST be released on DVD as soon as possible.",1083801600,3,636,5.176470588235294
1451158,5,B00005JLEY,Miami Vice was my favorite show when it was on and still is. Various cable networks have shown episodes periodically but not for long and always in bad time slots. This is the real thing with Sonny and Rico. CSI Miami can't touch it. Makes me feel like I'm there when I watch it. DVD's have been released of some mediocre and downright stupid shows. How about a real good one for a change. It's South Beach before there was the new South Beach!,1083628800,2,444,4.2976190476190474

1451243,3,B00005JLEY,"TV1 has released a 2CD set of Miami Vice which starts with the pilot and continues with the Colderone story arc. It's a great reminder of how, unlike so many other shows, a happy ending was never guaranteed. Despite the slick production, this made MV slightly more real for me. The DVD footage is TV quality, ditto the sound. I had forgotten just how large some of the logic leaps are in the show. Supporting casts' fashion has not dated well, but the film-clip style remains intact. Hopefully this is a tester and enough customer support might swing a full-season, remastered release. It appears other shows are receiving similar treatment: Knightrider, A-Team, Magnum PI... MV's my pick of the bunch though.",1078444800,,709,4.867768595041323

1451245,5,B00005JLEY,"I work for Universal Music and suggested 2 years ago to put out a CD with all of the songs that were on the Miami Vice series and got the same answer, that it was to hard to get all of the artist to agree and figure out how to distribute the royality fees. So trying to get the series on DVD is the same thing, it's all about money. If I had any clout they would be working very hard on getting this done. I was and still am a great fan of that show and believe it was the best of the 80's. I have 10 VHS tapes of the series and then they stopped producing them. Trust me, if they wanted to do it, they could and would. Come on Universal, put out the DVD series and combine all of the music on a CD box set. You know you can. Let's just keep the pressure on and hope for the best. Since the 80""s style is coming back in vogue, maybe they will produce it.",1073347200,52,854,3.776536312849162

1451247,5,B00005JLEY,"This show was everything the 80's were about, and then some! It combined timeless pop/rock music, Versace, exotic cars, Miami's art deco district, pretty people, and the Tony Montanas of the ""business"", an amazing list of guest stars, and ""true"" drama, with innocent victims and/or heroes often meeting their fate (not a standard practice on T.V.). I went as far as driving my convertible to Miami, during my '88 spring break, with the top down, and Miami Vice's soundtrack blasting, with hopes of living beyond the already explosive buzz I'd get watching the show from my dorm room. I can't wait for the release. The show, and ""on-the-edge"" portrayed lifestyles were as tempting and addictive as the drugs Vice tried so hard to keep off the streets.",1070841600,,750,4.913385826771654
1451248,5,B00005JLEY,"In one word eighties. Produced by the director of HEAT (a remake of his own T.V. pilot LA TAKEDOWN) and if you like his style look for VIOLENT STREETS also known as THIEF.
Some how Mr, Mann, leaves a strong stamp in style and the use of sinthesyser music widely used throughout the production he credits.
In the eighties the serie was like SEX IN THE CITY but then for guys. Fashion, Cars, and Drama(tic action).
If your looking for a party theme, this is your answer.
Highly enjoyable.

1451249,5,B00005JLEY,"Miami Vice was such a stylish and influential show in the 80s and a major part of it was the use of popular music of the time.  I have heard rumors that Miami Vice will not be released on DVD because obtaining licensing rights to all the different songs is impossible.  I for one only want this show if it contains the classic soundtrack music that was there in the original episodes.  I hope that releasing this classic show on DVD with new music will not be a reality because if it is released this way I won't be buying it.  The songs in each episode of Miami Vice usually played a role in setting the mood for a particular scene and removing any of those songs would be not only disrespectful to the shows integrity, but also to the countless fans who watched the original episodes and even reruns.  Miami Vice was directed somewhat toward the MTV generation and utilized popular music to great lengths - that was one of the coolest aspects of the show - gimmie a break!  There is only one way to release Miami Vice on DVD - with all those cool songs and in season sets - uncut!  Otherwise I'd rather just watch the reruns on TV.",1062374400,63,1133,4.291079812206573
