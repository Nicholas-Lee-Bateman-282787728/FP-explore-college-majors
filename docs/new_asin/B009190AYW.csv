8533869,5,B009190AYW,"Awesomely isolationist, Klagger is a no BS approach to the horror genre, a minimal yet truly effective film that pits man against ghoul in an abandoned factory for one loathsome day on the job. Tightly paced and relentless, with great practical effects and wonderfully atmospheric sound design, Klagger is a killer addition to the horror canon utilizing some of the best elements of ghost and slasher films; Klagger is one man who can't be put down.",1346284800,,449,4.921052631578948
8533870,3,B009190AYW,"The crispy fried KLAGGER in his own way tells how he became Southern Fried! No spoilers. This little fried morsel is but a taste of what could be one hell of a crispy delicacy; that will leave you hot around the collar and thirsting for more.

I liked the short-film for KLAGGER. Without giving too much away, KLAGGER reminded me of Stanley Kubrick's THE SHINING with its haunted building similarities and surprise ending. A long time fan of the THE SHINING, I could see myself and others getting excited to see KLAGGER in a longer format.

This was my first Casey Crow film and I was quite impressed with his direction. His slow, but steady pace of filming the factory, used the time allowed for this movie wisely. All the viewer has to do is pay attention to the bread crumbs, placed strategically to unravel the mystery surrounding KLAGGER.

Actually I gave it a 3.5 out of 5!
