1256910,5,B000034DDU,"As someone who could care less about the write and wrongs of the issue, I was fascinated by the brutally honest interviews he managed to get as well as the protrayal of his own reation to these people.  After watching this  documentary about Heidi's hellish relationships, I was very thankful for  the simple, honest, and decent people in my life.",951782400,6,347,4.75
1256911,5,B000034DDU,"I loved the intellectual twist to this documentary by British director Nick Broomfield! In an earlier review, escorts were mentioned, but Heidi was in no way connected to the escort business, although some of the  clients were the same. She did direct referrals, like Madam Alex.",947116800,6,279,5.065217391304348
1256912,1,B000034DDU,"long and repetitive. Hard to keep my interest. It took me 3 days to complete this movie. BORING!!!

1256913,1,B000034DDU,"The worst documentary every made.  This idiot needs to get some training in the film industry.  Poor camera technique and ridiculous questioning of mostly inaccurate targets. He should have stayed in England and got some training.
Don't waste your money or more importantly your time.",1442620800,,284,5.288888888888889

1256915,3,B000034DDU,"An insightful look into a tiny piece of history that obviously was not what the mainstream media reported, but a bitch fight between a bunch of megalomanics, with Heidi caught in the middle of their enormous egos. Not that she was a naive victim...",1441152000,,248,4.659090909090909

1256918,2,B000034DDU,I know the person doing the documentary had a hard time getting the info that he needed from Heidi but it did seem that he was asking the same people the same questions over and over,1428624000,,182,4.083333333333333
1256919,3,B000034DDU,"This is a reasonably accurate semi-biographical film. It's main interest-telling the story-but it's main attraction-is about watching a train wreck in slow motion. While this woman looks on camera to be attractive-she is NOT sexy and seemingly has no connection to anything real or even realistic. I ended up gaping at this film the same way I would look at a super wreck I was passing on the highway. The local media is portrayed-also accurately I believe-as a bunch of blood sucking content-less/non journalists.

But hey that is just an opinion-I could be wrong. Bad weather outside-nothing much else to do when I watched this.",1425600000,,630,5.0
1256920,3,B000034DDU,"Ewww, you'll feel like you need a shower afterwards. That and you may be the only person in the universe without a drug problem. If you like watching pathological liars talk in circles, this is the documentary for you. The only interesting feature was taking the 3 main characters narrative's and match them up to play ""Catch the Real Liar."" All I kept thinking was how Fleiss get so screwed up that she was vulnerable to these people. Then again you get the sense that she was out looking for adventure and found it.",1422144000,,517,4.51063829787234

1256922,4,B000034DDU,"i'm rather fascinated with her so i enjoy just about anything the illuminates the stories centered on the original players and conviction. if you want to get a feel for the time period, the odd characters and twisted story line, it's definitely worth your time watching. if you want a polished reenactment this is not for you.  this documentary draws no conclusions or reveals famous clients.  it's a gritty attempt to gain insight into the triad relationship that launches Heidi as a household name.  Pretty remarkable how many (male) pimps are out there that never do time or experience the impact that Fleiss does even though we know they are abusive, destructive and general dregs of society.  The hardest part of this story is knowing that where it ends on this film is just the beginning of her self-destructive path.",1406073600,,823,4.857142857142857
1256923,3,B000034DDU,Reveals how sick all the players are in this case.,1404777600,2,50,4.1
1256924,3,B000034DDU,This is an okay documentary. It doesn't come across as that professional and is disjointed in the fact that things seem a bit chaotic and out of order. You can tell that people interviewed are putting their best face forward. No one will really name any names. I watched it once and that was enough. There are some photos from Heidi's childhood and a bit of background into her being raised into a hippie type of lifestyle as she was a child in the 60's.,1403308800,,454,4.352941176470588
1256925,1,B000034DDU,It was so boring I didn't even finish it.  I think I shut it off after ten minutes.  Don't bother.,1399161600,,98,3.85
1256926,3,B000034DDU,There was so much more to tell that wasn't told..I was sorely disappointed that more was not revealed about who her customers were. That was such a key part of the mystery that surrounded this case. It was a shame to leave it out. Major let down.,1396051200,,246,4.25531914893617
1256927,2,B000034DDU,"Hey, she's a deadbeat, let's not glamorize this.

If you are not going to discuss each tangent or cannot do so, perhaps the project should be dumped.",1390089600,,149,4.518518518518518
1256928,5,B000034DDU,"I remember the press at the time, focused on who would be included on the list of customers. Hollywood is a very small town.
This documentary tells the story of a manipulator in the company of fellow manipulators. A tale that is timeless.",1389398400,,238,4.558139534883721
1256929,5,B000034DDU,I gave this documentary for stars or five stars on purpose because Johnny Irish has learned that if you write a negative review of an Amazon.com product and there are positive reviews out there they will post your review all the way in the bottom. This is a woman who belongs in jail she is a sleazy slut the quality of this documentary is far from desirable this documentary was made before Heidi was sent to jail it should not be surprising that her last voyage into the entertainment industry was on Dr. Drew's I'm a drug addict and I need help show which I forget the name of it was especially interesting when the episodes with her ex-boyfriend Tom Sizemore were being shown she's a drug addicted slut who doesn't deserve a second look so never mind the five stars on the low low Johnny Irish says do not buy this product respectfully Johnny,1377734400,2,846,4.464516129032258
1256930,2,B000034DDU,"There was too much effort trying to make it sensational, rather than looking objectively at the business. I suppose it was easier to sell that way, but, I found it rather disappointing. I only watched a small part of it.",1376870400,2,220,4.525
1256931,2,B000034DDU,"I didn't get all the way through this with its cheesy interviews.  Title looks more like an excuse to hang out in red-light districts and say, ""Hey I'm making a movie baby, you wanna be in it?""",1375401600,2,193,4.216216216216216
1256932,4,B000034DDU,"The dark side of show business is revealed in the video. Greed, jealousy, manipulation, and back-stabbing are some of the human traits that come alive when money is the dominant driving force.",1375315200,3,192,5.03125
1256933,4,B000034DDU,"Good documentary. Within the first five minutes of the video, I became totally engrossed. It's mesmerizing.  The main players were so sleazy that taking a shower after watching was extremely appealing.",1370736000,,201,5.483870967741935
1256934,3,B000034DDU,"Much of this otherwise well done documentary is redundant. So there was conflict among Ivan Nagy, Madam Alex and Heidi. Important but belabored. Victoria Sellers was the best interview in the movie because having been Heidi's roommate, she had the most intriguing information. I would have focused on Ms. Sellers and downplayed Nagy and Madam Alex.

I was also expecting (hoping) for much more interaction between Heidi and her customers and girls. The beginning of the movie teased with the mention of movie moguls and Arabs as Heidi's foremost source of clients. Couldn't the writer have found at least one Client #9?

The questions not answered: If prostitution and pandering are undesirable, why was tax evasion such a big part of her prosecution? And what justifies one panderer being held harmless in exchange for information?",1368748800,4,832,5.155555555555556
1256935,2,B000034DDU,"I couldn't get through the entire film - just a bunch of hangers-on capitalizing on the story. Nothing about Heidi, no revelations - not even a thoughtful analysis of the event. Can't recommend.",1366070400,,194,4.909090909090909
1256936,3,B000034DDU,"Anyone from the mid '90's would remember when the story broke that Hollywood's ""Black Book"" could be exposed when young ""Madame"" Heidi Fleiss was arrested for pandering to the ""Millionaire Row"" of Hollywood's elite.

Nick Broomfield's BBC documentary gives you insight into the three major players in this scandal;Heidi Fleiss,film director and boyfriend Ivan Nagy and former Hollywood Madame Head,Madame Alex. Everyone has their own versions of the events,NATURALLY.They all may be lying and they all may be telling some version of the ""truth"".You will gain some insight, but the documentary is extremely repetitive in it's information and interviews and ultimately quite dull.",1199404800,2,678,5.58252427184466
1256937,3,B000034DDU,Never got any clear cut picture of what really went down with Heidi's operation. Still parts of was entertaining.,1189987200,,113,5.0
1256938,4,B000034DDU,"Nick Broomfield professes a journalistic style you either like or hate. He works not unlike Michael Moore, apparently bursting unexpectedly into places with his crew, and you never know how much he manipulates you. In this case the style serves its purpose well. The viewers are allowed to catch a glimpse of the ""reverse side"" of Hollywood, where dreams might well turn into nightmares. Some protagonists get occasions to air their views ... I could not say they smell like roses (neither protagonists nor views). But the apparent spontaneity of their comments makes you feel that you get some insight into the more sordid corners of Southern California.",1140393600,2,655,5.074074074074074
1256939,5,B000034DDU,"A interesting view into the seedy world of prostitution, slimy pimps and the lies and dysfunction that is part of that world.  It gives a good overview of what Heidi Fleiss is about.  It was very interesting to view her parents and background which to the trained eye, explains how she ended up being who she was.  Entertaining and well done.",1095897600,8,342,4.573770491803279
1256940,4,B000034DDU,"It is awful difficult to summarize my reaction to this film.  On one hand, it was thoroughly entertaining.  On the other, I don't feel like I have any better understanding of what went on in the world of Heidi Fleiss.
From the entertaining perspective... step aside Ms. Fleiss.  Madam Alex and Ivan fighting absolutely takes the cake.  They act like two 5 year olds as the fight back and forth about who screwed whom out of the hollywood hooker business.  One has to wonder how Ivan was able to direct a number of television shows and film after watching him in this.
On another entertaining front... the mysterious man ""Cookie.""  Who was he?  Is he real?  The interview with Porn Star Tina was interesting.  She genuinely shut down the second his name was mentioned.
On the other side, Heidi comes off as being very sympathetic.  I mean, what girl is given $1,000,000 as a 21st birthday present, and then runs off to become a leading madam?  She was very interesting, but not fully explored.  I still don't feel like I have any sense of what made her tick.
Overall, I enjoyed the film.  I do feel that I wanted to hear more about people that were her clients.  I felt I wanted to know more about how the operation worked.  Ultimately the documentary sort of digressed to the lowest level by centering on the three-way fight between Madam Alex, Ivan & Heidi.  Worth watching... but not too enlightening.",1003708800,24,1403,4.596774193548387
1256941,5,B000034DDU,A straightforward and distinct look into some twisted and singed people.  I've never before seen a documentary that so accurately answers the question: But what are they really like?  This is especially impressive in  the shadow of the fact that the subjects don't always seem to be able to  answer this question for themselves.,957657600,12,328,5.018518518518518
7916530,5,B000034DDU,"This isn't a documentary about Heidi Fleiss. This is a documentary about Nick Bloomfield desperately trying to make a documentary about Heidi Fleiss in Wacknoodle Fleiss World, struggling to pry information from a series of flim-flam artists (including Daryl Gates). I think the only person who told him the truth was Ron Jeremy (yes -- THAT Ron Jeremy.) At times this film was really funny -- as when Nick is so desperate he hires a prostitute off Sunset Boulevard -- to talk about Heidi Fleiss and the hooker is appalled that Nick doesn't want sex. I also loved when Nick gets confronted by an American film crew. ""Who are YOU?"" the Channel 5 bimbo sneers at the award-winning, highly acclaimed British documentary filmmaker (and director of ""Monster in a Box"" which I loved). GREAT STUFF!!! I now want to watch every Nick Bloomfield film I can get my greasy little hands on.

For more Heidi Fleiss weirdness, I recommend ""Heidi Fleiss: The Would Be Madam of Crystal"" by HBO Films (not Nick Bloomfield, but still really good.)",1502323200,,1028,4.807909604519774
