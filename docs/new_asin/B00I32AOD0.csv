But there's no organizing theme or through line. other than a vague chronological progression from past to present. One minute we're in Russia, another we're in Denmark. Interspersed, there are some interesting observations about the challenges, limitations, and benefits of filmed dance. But if you're looking for a coherent thesis, you're going to have to come up with one yourself.

The creators of the film probably went too broad with their concept, also as the vague title implies. Are we talking about Hollywood dance? Archived historical performances? Dances created specifically for film or video? Yes, yes, and yes. A little more discernment and focus would have been wise. That said, there's some valuable stuff here, and it's certainly never boring.",1527292800,,883,5.35251798561151
