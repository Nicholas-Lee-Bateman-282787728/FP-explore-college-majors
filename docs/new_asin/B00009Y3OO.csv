7994307,2,B00009Y3OO,"This thing was just dreck. Mindless. The only thing worse than the plot and most of the acting was Billy Drago's haircut. Billy, I love you, but, put down the Flowbee.
The only good parts were the scenes between Drago and Richard Lynch--two old pros who know their way around thin plots and amateurish film making. If you're a fan of either man...well, I'm sorry, there's not much to recommend here. They do what they can with what they have. Otherwise, stay far away.",1299456000,,468,4.583333333333333
7994308,5,B00009Y3OO,"While the acting, directing, and plot and everything else sucked. I will always think of this movie fondly",1206403200,,106,4.944444444444445
7994309,2,B00009Y3OO,"While it's true that it goes downhill after the beginning. The movie goes away from the basketball player Jackie Stewart and focuses more on the coach. The coach is so desperate to protect Jakcie that his own family sufferes with his wife getting raped and his son holding the bloody remains of the family dog.
I would probably say that this movie sounds more like something that would be a Law & Order plot.",1079654400,,408,4.527027027027027
7994310,1,B00009Y3OO,"This is definately the worst movie ever.  I can't believe I watched the whole thing.  It keeps getting worse and worse as it goes on.  The plot goes from OK at the beginning, to down right horrible at the end.  The soundtrack has got to be one of the worst ever also.  Don't waste your time on this movie.",1076457600,2,305,4.101694915254237
