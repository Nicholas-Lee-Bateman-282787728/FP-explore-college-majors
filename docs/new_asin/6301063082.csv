8215296,5,6301063082,"""Two laps on the 400-meter oval...at a pace that's almost a full sprint. Dave Wottle, Tom Courtney, Peter Snell, Alberto Juantorena, Steve Ovett and Joaquim Cruz are among the champions featured in this fascinating look at The 800 Meters, the Olympic event that's synonymous with close finishes and upset victories. Using rare competition footage and personal recollections of the athletes, The 800 Meters (from Emmy-winning sports filmmaking master Bud Greenspan's The Olympiad series) captures the glory of Olympic triumph...and the dramatic human stories behind it.""",1255737600,2,569,5.705882352941177
