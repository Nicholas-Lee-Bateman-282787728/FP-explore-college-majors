5013446,5,B006QMOMZ0,"I love this DVD! The different play options allow me to pick a practice or meditation based on what I feel like and how much time I have. It's easy to follow along and Sura's voice is warm and soothing. The flowing practice is gentle yet energizing and I feel calm, strong and present when I'm finished. This is truly yoga from the heart. Thanks Sura!",1325980800,3,351,4.333333333333333
5013447,5,B006QMOMZ0,"I love this video, it is calming, easy to do, but makes you feel like you have really moved, stretched and worked your body. Easy to do and enjoyable.",1360108800,,150,4.206896551724138
5013448,3,B006QMOMZ0,Not sure Sura Flow is my style of yoga. Program was filmed in beautiful location and instructor was very clear. Personally I prefer more traditional Hatha and could not really get into this style of yoga.,1356739200,,204,4.694444444444445
5013449,4,B006QMOMZ0,Nice yoga disk. Very relaxing. I recommend this for beginners. Nice if you need a relaxer and cant leave the house.,1354665600,,115,4.523809523809524
5013450,5,B006QMOMZ0,"Sura Flow Yoga:  The Complete Integrative Program for Beginners.  Includes ""Yoga, Energy Healing & Life Skills"" and ""Deep Relaxation and Guided Meditation"".

This is a meditative, mostly gentle yoga practice which focuses on the mind/body connection and movement of the spine. There are no standing poses.  All poses are done seated, on hands and knees or lying on the floor.  Sura is an excellent  instructor with a quiet, calm voice.  The production quality is very high.  The dvd was filmed at a mountain lake in Boulder, CO and the background scenery is gorgeous.

While billed as a yoga dvd, there are elements of tai chi/qi gong.  Many of the poses incorporate circular  or wave like movements of the spine and limbs. I use Lee Holden's Qi Gong dvds frequently and feel that this dvd has a kinship with his practices.  People who prefer more active vinyasa style yoga might find this too slow.

Most of the poses would be accessible to someone who is new to yoga, but several require some upper body and core strength.  For example, one pose takes you from down dog in a circular motion to the side and down through up dog, and around the other side back to down dog.  There are several poses that will help you develop core strength.

Sura uses a great deal of guided imagery and visualization, particularly in segments 1, 5 and 6 listed below.  In the 5 Elements of Healing, she has you visualize yourself connected to various elements of nature ( a stream flowing through you, the sun warming you, etc.).  In the guided meditation, the focus is on the breath, observing stillness, observing yourself without judgment and peace.

I really appreciate the versatility of this dvd as you can use one of the premixed practices or design your own.  There are 6 different segments and you can mix and match from the following:

1. Centering and grounding (6 min) (seated)
2. Sura Flow seated (30 min)
3. Sura Flow full practice (53 min)
4. Sura Flow active practice (20 min)
5. 5 Elements Healing (11 min) (lying down)
6. Guided meditation (10 min) (seated)

The premixes are:
Full practice (1, 3, 5 and 6 for a total of 80 minutes)
Seated practice (1, 2, 5 and 6 for a total of 58 minutes)
Active Practice (1, 4, 5 and 6 for a total of 48 minutes)
Centering and Grounding practice (1, 5 and 6 for a total of 28 minutes)",1352332800,20,2322,4.557971014492754
5013451,5,B006QMOMZ0,Sura has created a truly wonderful series to let your energy flow in a transformative way.  Her instructions were clear and precise and I could follow along easily.  I practiced along with the DVD and definitely felt better as she guided me into an extremely relaxing sivasasana.  Great work!  Would highly recommend!,1340236800,,317,5.038461538461538
5013452,5,B006QMOMZ0,"Sura Flow is gentle yet invigorating.  Sura takes us softly through these unique low impact exercises to stretch the body, center the mind, and slow down our heart rate - in short to promote the relaxation response.  It works!

Her techniques are simple enough that ANYONE can do them, yet most of us will be able to feel so much better while doing them, and after.  Sura's calm demeanor and clear expertise shine through.",1338249600,2,422,4.662162162162162
5013453,5,B006QMOMZ0,"A beginner at yoga, I've tried a few programs before and immediately lost interest.  This program is much, much different.  Sura guides you through exercises that stretch your body, but more than that, stretches your consciousness.  Somehow she helps put you in tune with yourself and your place in the universe.  Very peaceful and relaxing.  Enlightening.  The motions are low-impact in nature and feel natural.  The production qualities are excellent, with great music and beautiful scenery (not to mention Sura herself).  The modular nature of the multiple programs allow you to piece together your own session, allowing you to select which ones you want to do in what order.  Makes it easy to accommodate changing available time and interest.  Do yourself a huge favor and get this DVD.  It's a huge bargain, especially for those seeking the elusive peace of mind.  You won't regret it!",1329955200,14,890,5.062068965517241
5013454,5,B006QMOMZ0,"Sura is a gifted teacher of meditation, of yoga, and of a way of being.
SuraFlow is a lovely and wonderful way to get in touch with movement, and self without having years of training or the flexibility of a yogi...

I highly recommend SuraFlow!",1329264000,2,245,4.444444444444445
5013455,5,B006QMOMZ0,"Within a few minutes of starting this DVD, I felt instantly better.  Sura's voice is gentle, non-intrusive and soothing to the ears.  The background setting and location of Sura's yoga is simply gorgeous and easy on the eyes.  The music doesn't get in the way and I felt instantly relaxed and ready to let go into my inner world.

What I love most about Sura's yoga practice is how simple it is, and yet, I experience a deep opening in my heart and stillness in my mind that is so familiar with meditation, all the while the practice is active, but not busy or demanding.

She is a very feminine yogi and her practice is a great find in this world of 'power' yoga DVDs as they push their way into submission.

Sura invites you into your own surrender without the need to knock you over the head or exhaust you first.

The overall production value is the best.  I really like the different options to select which part of the yoga I want to do, so if I only have 20 minutes or if I have 1.5 hours, or if I only want the meditation, or any other option, I can tailor the DVD to fit my needs.

You can not go wrong with Sura's DVD",1327968000,8,1127,4.15668202764977
5013456,5,B006QMOMZ0,"I really love this SuraFlow DVD. The yoga sequences are gentle and I love the circular flow to the movements. I resonate well with the grounding, healing and meditations segments, and I really appreciate being able to select a different custom practice from day-to-day depending on how much time I have and what my body needs. Sura's voice and manner are really soothing and encouraging, and the visual backdrop is stunning - adding to the meditative experience of watching the DVD. I highly recommend it!",1326067200,6,505,4.952941176470588

8503044,3,B006QMOMZ0,"Advertised as for beginners as well as experienced, but maybe I'm too much of a beginner...couldn't get through it.  Beautiful setting, though.",1504137600,,143,5.5
8503045,5,B006QMOMZ0,Absolutely love this Yoga/Meditation dvd! Beautiful scenic mountain lake setting making it very relaxing. She is amazing!! So glad I made this purchase!,1486339200,,152,5.6521739130434785
8503046,4,B006QMOMZ0,"I really, really like this DVD. It includes yoga, meditation, and what they say is energy healing. I don't understand the latter much yet to comment on whether that is or isn't a valid claim. All I know is that this offers very soothing, grounding meditations, as well as yoga with unique poses.

First, however, an important note:

There are three Sura Flow DVDs on Amazon at the time of this writing (the other two of which are currently out of stock). Note that this ""Complete Beginners Program"" DVD INCLUDES the full contents of the other two DVDs.

I couldn't find anything at all useful online before buying this: no video clips, nothing. Even on her website, the descriptions are exceptionally vague, there are no screenshots... no indication of what differentiates one DVD from the other. I hope they fix their marketing and presentation because Sura (from the interview on one of the DVDs) seems charming, grounded, focused, and honest.

AND I really, really enjoy both the meditations and the yoga on this DVD.

Back to it, then.

See my pic of the back cover, and you'll understand even further that this includes everything from her other two DVDs.

I've already reviewed Sura's meditations -- Grounding & Centering, 5 Elements Healing, and Guided Meditation -- so I won't rehash those. Please see that review here: https://www.amazon.com/review/R32MDQBP5YD8PZ/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006SKP9B6 (That's the DVD I bought first -- and returned, because it was NOT YOGA.)

For this one, I'll speak only about the yoga... which, again, has several very unique poses and movements. For instance:

- In one, she has you move in a continuous wave, from a very extended child's pose, through hands and knees, through to upward facing dog, through to Bhujangasana, then down to fully prone, resting on your forehead, sort of ""cobra'd."" Then, again in one continuous wave, you move all the way back through the poses smoothly, to child's pose. I *love* this one. Very meditative movement for me, but still using a good amount of strength, and still focusing on your breath.

- In another, she has you sit in a sort of hero's pose, but with your toes pressed into the ground -- because we have a lot of acupressure points in our feet, she says. Then you raise your arms parallel to the floor, with elbows at 90-degree angle, out to the side (like you'd do lateral raises in weight training). Then you lean backward a good amount, and twist your body from side to side, incorporating the breath as you move from side to side. After that, you get on hands and knees and gently beat the tops of your feet on the ground to ""get the energy flowing back into your feet.""

There are many movements like that that I've not seen before, but that aren't TOO off-the-wall or unusual. This provided a moderately good stretch for me, though with such tight hips, I must do another 20-minute segment on another tape later in the day if I want not to feel clinched up at all, and feel completely relaxed.

The music is soothing and appropriate, so much so that I honestly can't remember it. It's not super notable, apparently, which is fine with me. I'm supposed to be focusing on my body, not on annoying, sappy, too ""new age,"" or crazy music.

Her voice is relaxing, and the voiceovers are pretty fairly timed to her movements. She leaves herself behind a few times, but nothing super glaring. In ""voiceover yoga tapes,"" I find that I use either one or the other -- the visuals, or the music -- so I'm not bothered or distracted by synchronicity issues.

The scenery is BEAUTIFUL. I have no idea how they got her wooden block floating out in that like like that, but it's utterly incredible. Visually striking, sunny, and fantastic, I wish I was out there to do yoga with her. (Well, maybe not, due to all the bugs there'd be over the water. ;/)

Finally, I should note that I've done every part of this DVD except the seated yoga. I may update after I explore if there's anything notable that needs to be shared. For now, I've watched it, and it's more than just ""seated."" It also has lying down poses. I can't remember if there are hand/knee poses, but you're certainly on the floor the whole time.

I gave it 4 stars (Amazon's ""I like it"") because I do really, really ""like"" it.

I don't ""love"" it, meaning it's not one of my absolute favorites of all time; however, it IS one of my most frequent choices in my small, but growing # of 20-minute yoga DVDs. I do definitely recommend it. I like that you can get both yoga and meditation on one DVD, AND that they're both enjoyable and effective.

Enjoy your yoga-tations. (And for heaven's sake, remember to only buy this one DVD -- NOT either of the other two here on Amazon!)",1467849600,8,4725,4.658653846153846
8503047,5,B006QMOMZ0,It's pretty good I liked it,1464566400,,27,3.6666666666666665
8503048,5,B006QMOMZ0,This is a perfect gentle yoga program for someone getting back into an exercise program or when you just want a slower calming pace. I had been sick and wasn't able to exercise for quite a while. This DVD was just what I was looking for to get back into physical activity. The instructor has a calming (non annoying) voice which is very important to me. The outdoor locations were also beautiful and relaxing. You will feel great after either the yoga or meditation programs.,1463270400,,475,4.6
8503049,5,B006QMOMZ0,Great intro for both yoga and meditation. Very calming and relaxing for mind and body... Love it!,1456876800,,97,4.764705882352941
8503050,5,B006QMOMZ0,Very good video. Very soothing and relaxing. Audio and vizuals were amazing. A very gentle and stimulating journey both physically as well as mentaly.,1430697600,,150,5.291666666666667
8503051,5,B006QMOMZ0,I love Sura Flow.  I've tried out a lot of yoga DVD's and always find it frustrating when the voice and instructional aspect of the presenter is too loud or detracts in other ways from the movements.  This was the perfect blend of calm and exertion.,1369958400,,249,4.391304347826087
8503052,4,B006QMOMZ0,I chose this because I wanted something easier with more focus on meditation. This is great and easy to use.,1365033600,,108,4.45
