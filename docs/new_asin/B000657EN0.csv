8185990,5,B000657EN0,Watching this DVD makes you realize how much has gone wrong in the middle east over the years and how many vast treasures and beautiful cities were lost. All of the footage here comes from the begining of the 20th century before war raged over the Middle East and back when the Arab countries were still open societies. The footage is breathtaking and makes me yearn for times gone by.,1152835200,,385,4.514285714285714
