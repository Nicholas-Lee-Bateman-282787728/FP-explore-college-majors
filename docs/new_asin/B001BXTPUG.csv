8285176,5,B001BXTPUG,"The program takes you back to a China of long ago.  It explains the history of China which most Americans know nothing of.  The documentary footage is excellent.  I highly recommend it with the understanding that it was created during the Cold War. Theodore White explains the China he knew in the 1930's nd 1940's.  The film compliments his books, Thunder Out of China and In Search of History",1462752000,,394,4.666666666666667
8285177,5,B001BXTPUG,"""Ours is a century of blood and terror, and yet of all the convulsions of our time, the one we heeded the least was the revolution in China, bloodiest and most terrible of all - an entire civilization blown apart."" So begins this marvelous documentary produced by David L. Wolper and narrated by Teddy White, he of ""The Making of the President..."" fame. Yes, it's dated, and, yes, the opening line quoted above is missing (at least from my copy); but the rest is pure historical gold. It features some amazing vintage films, an interview with Pearl Buck, and well conveys the upheaval that brought the Communists to power that remains in place today. The dynastic China, The Empress Dowager, Sun Yat-Sen,  Chiang Kai-shek, and of course Mao - they are all there in living black and white, including some sound film. If you want to learn about China's past, and how the nation came to be in its present state, this is the DVD to see.",1361836800,,932,4.580838323353293
