The Spanish version comes in both Spanish and English, English by default from my experience with the first disc.
Sadly the product is in a poorly made case which breaks easily, giving me damaged discs. I've never had this happen before. So while the show itself may be good, it seems to keep costs down cuts on the case were made.",1422748800,,386,4.450704225352113
