7969282,4,B00006II56,"SOS Coast Guard, 1937 film

This movie serial of twelve episodes was shown in theaters to draw in people each week to see the entire story. Magazines and newspapers had serial stories since the 19th century. They stopped this by the 1950s for movies. There is a lot of action but not as good a plot or story. Model boats are used a lot. Melting a still film provides special effects. Note the use of a radioactive substance as a novel technology to provide a scientific interest.

Chapter 1 ""Disaster at Sea"" starts at the Coast Guard base. A medal is awarded to Lt. Terry Kent. His next task is to watch a private yacht outside the twelve-mile limit. There is a new secret weapon - disintegration gas! It dissolves solid rock! Is Dr. Boroff behind this? This secret weapon will be shipped on the SS Carfax. But the ship hits the rocks and sends an SOS. They shoot a line to rescue the crew. Boroff escapes by firing a shot. Will the Carfax sink into the sea? There is action and suspense as the ship founders. Chapter 2 ""Barrage of Death"" begins with the escape of Terry and his girlfriend and reporter Jean. Thorg works for Boroff. Silver nitrate recovers washed-out ink. Lt. Kent visits the address. Can he send a message in code? The Coast Guard is alerted. Chapter 3 ""The Gas Chamber"" shows how a Kelp Plant will be used to recover the boxes and make the gas. A hurt man is brought ashore to the hospital. The photographer ""Snapper"" is put in a box! Chapter 4 ""The Fatal Shaft"" shows the gang escaping, and the chase to the factory. Jean keeps her pocket automatic handy, but loses it to the smooth-talking stranger. They analyze the gas. Jean is rescued.

Chapter 5 ""The Mystery Ship"" has the police there while the villains flee. Terry flies on a Clipper Ship to Hawaii to inspect the cargo for Zanzoid. The villains get aboard the ship `Adamic' and take control. The radio operator sends a message. Kent frees himself and saves the ship. Chapter 6 ""Deadly Cargo"" brings the Coast Guard ship to their rescue. Will Boroff's men talk? Terry figures out the shipping method and flies there. The plot is discovered. A shot hits the glass bulbs! What will happen next? Chapter 7 ""Undersea Terror"" has Thorg retrieving the amatite from the sunken ship. The ""Sea Wolf"" has a job. Terry will check the Carfax. Will Thorg stop Terry? Chapter 8 ""The Crash"" has Terry's escape. Jean asks to write a report on the Kelp Plant. [Boroff could shave his beard for a disguise but his accent remains.] Can Terry sneak back to investigate? Can he escape on a motorcycle? Will a flat tire send them off the road? Chapter 9 ""Wolves at Bay"" shows their escape from Boroff's men. Terry asks for a raid on the Kelp Plant. Boroff's men fire on the Coast Guard. Will a lit fuse blow up the plant?

Chapter 10 ""The Acid Trail"" shows how they survived the blast. The glass bulbs are brought to a hiding place. Boroff's men are watching and capture Terry. Then they go for chemist Dick at his laboratory. Terry rescues him. Chapter 11 ""The Sea Battle"" shows Boroff's plan to escape across the border and ship the gas. A medical machine can detect a radioactive substance like the disintegrating gas. Can Terry defend his boat against a rifle? Or escape Thorg? Chapter 12 ""The Deadly Circle"" has Terry finding Boroff's hidden island, but being captured. Boroff offers to save Terry's life if the Coast Guard stays away. [No Deal!] Terry escapes again! Coast Guradsmen land with fixed bayonets to attack Boroff. Will they be trapped? Can a counter-gas neutralize the disintegration gas? Will Boroff escape or become the last victim for poetic justice? There will be a happy ending for Jean and Terry.",1412208000,,3676,4.599085365853658
7969283,5,B00006II56,"There are two classic Republic serials contained in this set. Undersea Kingdom (1936), which is a fantastic Flash Gordon-like serial was one of Republic's first. S.O.S. Coast Guard has a more standard setting, but boasts Bela Lugosi as the bad guy. The prints and sound quality are very good, and you really can't go wrong for the price.",1378166400,4,337,4.827586206896552
