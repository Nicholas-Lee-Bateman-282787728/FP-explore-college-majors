8073329,3,B000A2XC6M,"Back in the mid-1960's, a NYC TV station (WPIX-11) would broadcast a Saturday night show called CHILLER THEATER. The films in the MONSTERS 20 MOVIE PACK are precisely the kind of fare once featured on that weekly program. All it took was the family TV, a darkened living room and CHILLER THEATER to frighten many an over-imaginative child right out of his wits. The funny thing was-- we all loved every minute of it!

If you apply adult sensibilities and sophistication to such films, naturally one may find them lacking in plot, in quality of acting or special effects. However, if one were to approach these scarefests with the necessary childlike innocence . . . the chills, thrills and frights are here to be had. Relive your youth, or better yet-- share these movies with your own little monsters, and just maybe you'll see a bit of your long-ago self in your children's wide-eyed astonishment.
