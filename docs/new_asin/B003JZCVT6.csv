Three cops in Brooklyn on different paths eventually converge onto the same crime scene. Bloopers after the credits and I purposefully chose silly music to go with such a depressing film.

4132061,3,B003JZCVT6,"As a British viewer I found it hard to believe that Brooklyn's finest are this violent, corrupt and bigoted.  The film is as described by another reviewer a depressing slog with no humour whatsoever and sporadic outbursts of violence.  The cast do an excellent job and the settings of New York's seedier side give the film an authentic atmosphere but its hard work to watch and I got the overall impression that the director worked a little too hard to make it so.  I'll be amazed if Brooklyn's real finest gave any assistance to this movie because it does not paint them in a good light.",1270252800,8,588,4.528301886792453

4132063,1,B003JZCVT6,This movie has no redeeming or inspiring quality. It is just a two hour marathon of depression. If you want to spoil your evening and experience depression this will do it. All you see is the disgusting side of things. Nothing good.,1269475200,11,232,4.5476190476190474
4132064,5,B003JZCVT6,"""Brooklyn's Finest"" is a remarkably entertaining and well-acted police drama from director Antoine Fuqua, who also directed the also outstanding police drama, ""Training Day.""

The film focuses on three very different Brooklyn cops over the course of a week. Richard Gere plays Eddie, a hardened veteran just a week away from retirement. He has nightmares, he's separated from his wife, and he's just biding his time until his retirement. Ethan Hawke, the hero of ""Training Day, plays a narcotics detective desperate to finance a new home to give a better life to his wife, children, and twins on the way. Don Cheadle plays Tango, an undercover cop, who is so deep undercover that he forgets who he really is, and to make matters worse, he now has to setup a high-level drug dealer who saved his life while he was undercover in prison.

These examples of Brooklyn's Finest are all living on the edge, and they all go over the edge one way or another. The acting from these three is superb. Their performances along with Wesley Snipes as the drug dealer, Brian F. O'Byrne as Hawkes' best friend and partner, Shannon Kane as Eddie's hooker with a heart of gold, and a number of others, make this a very enjoyable, but powerfully sad and tragic film.",1268438400,44,1246,4.7373271889400925
4132065,4,B003JZCVT6,"Brooklyn's Finest is about three cops working in different units in the NYC police department, who struggle with the perils of the crime-infested streets, particularly the drug trafficking operations.

Ethan Hawke delivers probably his best performance to date. He plays Sal Procida, a NYPD narcotics officer who's a devout Catholic with mostly good intentions, but is plagued with his own demons as he chases after ruthless drug dealers while struggling to support more kids at home than he can afford on a cop's salary.

Don Cheadle plays the role of ""Tango"", an ambitious undercover cop working double-duty on a drug sting operation. He's burned out and wants out of the game before it's too late, but he's in too deep and the powers that be on the corrupt police force won't let him escape. Ellen Barkin plays the hard-ass boss lady in charge of the sting operation. She has Cheadle by the balls and couldn't care less about his survival.

Richard Gere plays Officer Dugan, a washed-out, suicidal veteran cop who is just a week away from retirement. His goal (aside from enjoying the services of a certain ""professional"" whom he likes more than he should) is to maintain his sanity, keep his nose clean and keep his rookie cop partner under control for just a few more days so that he can cash in on his pension with a little pride. But as it turns out, his last week on the job is probably the worst of his entire career.

Wesley Snipes returns to the big screen as the smart, ruthless drug lord ""Caz"" running the streets of Brooklyn. He's been in the game for too long as well and appears to be losing his ""street cred"", as he doesn't know who to trust anymore.  His most trusted partner however, happens to be Tango who, unbeknownst to Caz, is working undercover to bust his operation.

Brooklyn's Finest tells a graphic story about each of these characters and the double lives and personal struggles that each one has to deal with on a daily basis. All three are ""fine"" cops in their own way, but the demands of their dangerous jobs, in a corrupt world, gets the best of them. Neither cop knows the other one, but their fate is ultimately intertwined.

This movie starts out quite slow but it eventually progresses into a very good film. This is a serious cop drama that is very raw in its portrayal of crime and corruption on the mean urban streets. It contains certain elements of other movies, such as ""Training Day"", ""New Jack City"", ""American Gangster"" and ""Crash"" all meshed together into one powerful movie.

The casting and acting are superb, but the story leaves nothing to the imagination and exploits stereotypes to the max. Highly recommended, nonetheless.

WARNINIG: Contains graphic sexual content, extreme violence and profanity. Not for the easily offended!",1268006400,30,2782,4.767151767151767
4132066,4,B003JZCVT6,"It's been almost a decade since Director Antoine Fuqua treated us to Training Day, and Brooklyn's Finest proves that he still has the goods.  While not destined to become the fan classic that Denzel helped deliver, Brooklyn's Finest offers up an excellent cast and an explosive ending.

Don Cheadle, as an undercover cop, gives a terrific performance while continuing to prove himself as one of Hollywood's most underrated actors.  It was also amazing to watch Ethan Hawke as a corrupt officer, but unlike Training Day's Alonzo, you really feel his vulnerability.  He's thrown into a pressure cooker early into the film, with tension so real that you can almost touch it.  If you're a diehard fan of HBO's The Wire like myself, you're going to love the casting of Michael K. Williams (Omar Little) and Hassan Johnson (Wee-Bey) as Brooklyn dealers, and Isiah Whitlock Jr (Senator Clay ""Sheeee*t"" Davis) as a city investigator.  Wesley Snipes gives a great New Jack City throwback performance as drug kingpin Caz.  Richard Gere plays the role of a weathered cop to perfection, despite being handed a script filled with one too many police flick cliches.

Brooklyn's Finest starts especially slow, but really picks up steam past the film's halfway mark.  The cinematography and directing are both on point, and Fuqua's use of lighting is excellent.  Brazilian composer Marcelo Zarvos (Sin Nombre) did a great job with the score, and the rest of the soundtrack fits perfectly (particularly the Busta Rhymes track during a stash house raid).  And like The Wire, police bureaucracy is exposed, corruption is revealed, and the streets take no prisoners.

The film gets four stars instead of five, simply because there are one too many cliches, and the ""Crash"" concept isn't anything new.  But while the plot is at times implausible and not terribly exciting, the intertwining of characters leading up to the film's conclusion is grim and powerful.  Not the best film of 2010, but don't miss this one if you enjoy The Wire.",1267747200,17,2015,4.994011976047904

4132078,3,B003JZCVT6,"There were 3 different stories going on at the same time.  One was a joke and it was the part Richard Gere played, who I feel ruined the movie the most, another was a corrupt cop needing money who went rogue to get it, and another was a cop in the drug world undercover.  Richard Gere made me feel sick every time there was a scene showing his story.  He was totally boring and like someone on downers the whole movie.  There was so much violence and death that it overtook the movie.  The porn made the movie seem cheap and did not add to the story attempting to be told.  There was constant confusion as to what was going on.  I gave it 3 stars because some parts kept me engaged as long as Gere was not in them.",1524096000,2,714,4.057142857142857

4132099,5,B003JZCVT6,"It was a slow starter and I almost backed out of watching what turned out to be a very good movie. I thought it was just going to be a long sad story about a retiring cop, but it turned into a fast paced thriller that followed three cops with issues as they come to their conclusions. Gritty and dark, with cutting that got better and quicker as the movie progressed. I love Richard Gere but I felt he might have been miscast. The other two cops, one troubled about a family to support and one undercover, were perfect. I think these two guys took it out of soap opera to thriller.
I was perplexed about why the Richard Gere cop was such a lonely guy but there wasn't the background on him and connection with other characters like the other two cops had.
I was fascinated by the dark music. I swear it was stolen and re-used (very effectively) for Black Mass with Johnny Depp as Whitey Bulger. I guess it's a theme worth repeating in this kind of film/",1501200000,,953,4.2707182320441985

4132170,4,B003JZCVT6,"When a video chain closed several years ago, I picked this up on Blu-Ray.  It took me awhile to get around to watching it.  I put it in the garage sale bin afterwards, not because it isn't a good movie, but just because it is so dark.  This is a film filled with drugs, sexual abuse and crooked cops.  After the movie, I wanted to take a shower.  It is powerful, but do I really need this in my life?  As far as the performances, Don Cheadle and Wesley Snipes crackle in their scenes on screen.  Very subtle strong performances.  Ethan Hawke as Sal, a cop trying to pocket drug money to buy his wife a nice house, breaks your heart.  You see him making the wrong choices for all the right reasons.  It's so sad.  Ethan Hawke's buddy and police partner Ronny Rosario played by sterling character actor Brian F. O'Byrne is perhaps the shining light of the film, always trying to do the moral thing, but somehow managing to screw things up.  Lili Taylor plays Hawke's sick wife Angela, bringing depth to a small role.  Richard Gere plays Eddie, a police officer about to retire, worn out by a job that has cost his personal life.  Will Patton as Lt. Bill Hobarts that handles Hawke and Ellen Barkin as Agent Smith turn in strong performances.  Director Antoine Fuqua does an excellent job at weaving these competing story threads together.  For me, it was too much -- which is not to say it isn't a good film.  It is.

4132203,4,B003JZCVT6,"Antoine Fuqua Keeps churning out solidly crafted movies that are well worth remembering. A film like Training Day represents his best work. Or Tears of the Sun, a movie I have seen 7 times and absolutely adore. His latest effort, Brooklyns Finest doesnt dissapoint at all. Here Fuqua does a bit of Sidney Lumet in the tradition of Prince of the City. While not as compelling as that film or as remarkable it does pay a pretty impressive homage to the genre of films that deal with police corruption. This film is filled with a lot of violence, but not a lot of action. Even when there is action it seems to be played less for thrills and more for realism. As a whole the film is strangely somber and slow, but never dull. Over all this story is pretty familiar territory which brought to mind a lot of other similar films. Numerous movies like Serpico, We own the night, and Narc came to mind, to name a few. Over all an impressive film that handles its subject matter believably. Never utterly predictable, but not what I would consider Antoine Fuquas finest work. Still a pretty great movie. A solidly crafted film about police corruption that features excellent performances from Hawke, Cheadle, and especially Wesley Snipes who was unusually brilliant as a drug lord. Definately above average film, just don't expect this to be oscar territory and you should be pleased with the results.",1367884800,,1391,4.704918032786885

4132207,5,B003JZCVT6,"A large war is being fought in the New York City borough of Brooklyn, a borough much smaller than the war being fought in it.

Does it sound too good to be true? It is both good and true, believe it or not! Brooklyn's Finest is a ""love it or hate it film."" Director Antoine Fuqua (Training Day) claims in his commentary that he looked to the opera as his guiding force for his job as the film's director. This is the cause of the opposition that Brooklyn's Finest has gotten, but if you can observe the suspense, the characters, and the performances aside from Fuqua's ""opera"" method......they ALL override it, at least in my opinion....

Below, I give you as much proof as I can, supporting my own opinion with the psychology of Brooklyn's Finest, psychology executed brilliantly not only by Fuqua, but also by the actors working under him (most notably the picture's three stars: Ethan Hawke, Don Cheadle, and Richard Gere).

Hawke, in a role that mirrors his first role under Fuqua (Training Day) *****only***** in the fact that both pictures find him as a family man, is a good cop turned bad. His character, Salvatore ""Sal"" Procida, has a good intention in going bad: he wants to earn money that he needs for his whole family to remain in the same house with him. Fuqua and screenwriter Michael C. Martin give Sal the benefit of the doubt in the fact that, if Sal does not get the money he needs, he will have to tell one of his children that they have to move out of their house with Sal, their mother Anjie (Lili Taylor), and their fellow siblings. You feel for Sal, of course, but you know that you can't support him when it comes to the way that he breaks not only the rules of his job, but also the law to get the money that he needs. Fuqua and Martin ask us; what is the line between right and wrong, morally right and unrealistically restrictive? The internal conflicts surrounding this question are brought to life impeccably by Hawke in his performance as Sal. The reason why Fuqua cast Hawke in Training Day (Hawke being a husband and father who could understand his character of Jake Hoyt's struggles in keeping his fictional family in Training Day safe) shines again beautifully here. As Hawke becomes his character, Fuqua throws at him one challenge after another, and Hawke always lives up to the challenge (as an actor) as his character continues to fall farther and farther behind...

With Cheadle, his performance is the most simple, but his challenges are by far the most complex. His character, Clarence ""Tango"" Butler, struggles not only with his job itself, but also with many internal conflicts surrounding the job. These conflicts surround his relationship with Cassanova ""Caz"" Phillips (Wesley Snipes), a drug dealer he agreed to infiltrate many years ago. Tango has not only gotten in too deep with Caz...he has also had his life saved by Caz! And, meanwhile, he knows that Caz is about to reform him himself (this may be hard to see, but Fuqua confirms it in his commentary). Now, it is up to Tango to choose between mercy without justice or justice to a man about to become innocent. It doesn't help that his lieutenant (Will Patton) is working with a special agent (Ellen Barkin) who knows how to send him to Hell if he does not complete the job he first signed onto...

Last, but not least, you have Richard Gere's character of Edward ""Eddie"" Dugan. A police officer only seven days away from retirement, Eddie is about to meet his worst days on the job....his last days. As Eddie finds himself up against young, new, and ""difficult"" partners, his morality is challenged, and will either bring him about as 1) a disgrace, 2) a hero, or 3) a disgraced hero. In his performance as Eddie, Gere teams up with Fuqua as both put Eddie in continuous physical and emotional danger. As both put Eddie in danger from one moment to the next, Gere turns his character's internal conflicts into his own and masterfully pours drama into suspense, and suspense into drama (just watch his character's situations and you'll know exactly what I mean...)

Together, Gere, Ethan Hawke, Don Cheadle (alone and in the very rare onscreen moments that the three actors share with each other; Gere alone with Hawke in one scene and alone with Cheadle in another; Hawke and Cheadle coming face to face themselves without Gere), and Antoine Fuqua (next to the powerful ensemble cast surrounding them, including Vincent D'Onofrio in a cameo appearance with Hawke) bring the hostile and vulnerable streets of Brooklyn to life.  How they did so is revealed in Fuqua's commentary for the film, next to the DVD's five featurettes (one about the life of ***any*** New York cop, one about the real BK housing projects in Brooklyn, separate writer and director featurettes, and deleted scenes).

Highly recommended!",1363046400,,4814,4.715814506539833

4132220,3,B003JZCVT6,"I'm liking director Antoine Fuqua's movies even though they can make me wince, grimace, and feel real uncomfortable.  ""Brooklyn's Finest"" is an example.  I would not recommend this to the squeamish, timid, easily offended, or casual viewer.  It is a bleak, demanding, brutal, and drapily realistic hardboiled cop movie where nobody, and I mean nobody, comes out clean.

It is a coalescing story about three New York cops (Richard Gere's burnout on the verge of retirement cop Eddie; Don Cheadle's deep undercover agent Tango; and Ethan Hawkes' haunted, sanity-is-slipping-away vice officer) who witness tragedy, experience some debilitating personal pain and trauma that feels all to real, and who meet with brutal ends (save for one but I won't give that away).  It's enough to make you almost want to be a gangster as it seems that their lives aren't that hard or messed up!  I'm just saying that this movie won't do anything for police recruitment.

That acting is very good and believable, the movie maintains a singular intensity (Hawke is spectacular), and the ending is a firm conclusion though it may not satisfy.  I'd encourage you to avoid this if you're in a depressed mood.  Otherwise, if you like hardboiled, bloody, hardhitting and hardbitten cop features then this one is for you.

4132222,2,B003JZCVT6,"I wanted very much to like this movie. So many of my favorite actors are in it but all for nothing. This film was more like a two-hour pilot for a new CBS crime series. (Poor Lili Taylor--how does she get such thankless roles? And Vincent D'Onofrio was wasted. He took time off from Law and Order for this? I hope not.) Gere, whom I like, just seemed to sleepwalk, but who could blame him? The role is so filled with cliches, any TV actor could have played the part. (His attempt at redeeming the ""fallen woman"" was an embarrassment all around, but especially for him.) Don Cheadle does his usual efficient job, but he seemed as eager to be out of this film as his character wants to get out of his undercover assignment.

I have to admit the first 15 minutes or so had my interest piqued. Then it lost me. Here and there, usually when Ethan Hawke was on the scene, my ears perked up. His character, with its bow-legged morals, came across as the most credible, both in its writing and Hawke's performance. The rest had me sighing with boredom--it's all been done before.

4132224,4,B003JZCVT6,"When Brooklyn's Finest first hit theaters, I couldn't understand what all the hate is about. I felt like it was every bit as good a film as Training Day. Only think lacking was that Denzel Washington tour de force. Nonetheless, this is a good movie in its own right. What else do you expect from a gritty Antoine Fuqua cops vs. drug dealers drama? Brooklyn's Finest proveded everything it should have. The cast is good and well-rounded, even if no one gives a career performance. No, Richard Geere did not phone in his performance! He played a veteran beat cop named Eddie, on his way to retirement, and he did so pretty much as one would expect him to. He was tired, which translates to calm and laid back, and thust seemed like he was ready to hang up his uniform. Tango/Clarence (Don Cheadle) was the star of this one though. He gave the best performance of this film as an undercover that was really deep in the drug game, with a fresh-out-of-prison partner, Caz (the return of Wesley Snipes...and then disappearance again).

They shared a chemistry on screen that felt real to me. Rounding out the great actors was Ethan Hawke as Sal. His was my second favorite performance after Cheadle's. He was just hard working family man that got dealt a bad hand in life. I really felt sorry for his character. He showed that desperate side of crooked cops that doesn't get the attention it deserves. A lot of those guys have a lot on their plates, and for the most part, ploice salaries ain't what they should be for the amount of danger those guys are put in. That's what drives them to do the things they do. The best part of this movie is definitely the atmosphere though. The sets don't vary much though. It's basically project housing, titty bars, more project housing and New York streets. Not much else, but it remains gritty and grimey like it should. The sets and cinematography actually set the dark tone wonderfully. And the transfer does a very good job of translating that to our flatscreens.

Overall, Brooklyn's Finest is nothing you haven't seen before in any of the cop dramas that came before it, but still I think this movie is definitely worth giving a chance, despite the less than stellar buzz it recieved, and its eventual fizzling out.

4132225,4,B003JZCVT6,"Last night's bargain-rack movie was ""Brooklyn's Finest."" There's a bit of irony in the title, to say the least. Do You like to have your face pushed into the nitty-gritty of down and dirty big city life? Try this. Do You enjoy a high percentage of the dialog to be in loud, angry F-speak? Well, here's a movie for you. Do you like your gore to be so realistic that when a bullet strikes a body, you can not only see the blood gush out, you can hear it? I'm not kidding. Do you like a really, really depressing police environment where no one is working for the common good? You may enjoy the ""Brooklyn's Finest"" DVD.

The movie follows a unit of the Brooklyn (New York City) police force for a couple weeks and I suppose Richard Gere would have to be the lead character. He's a totally burned out street cop who only has one week to go before retirement after 20 years and he's not exactly looking to get involved in anything. He's associated with the 65th Precinct, the worst precinct in a notorious part of badly decaying Brooklyn. Hoods and drug dealers are everywhere and the police have undercover cops who are among them. Well, this is about the worst collection of cops I've ever witnessed and everyone follows his own rules. Cops are openly stealing money and dope and murder hoods who are into the same thing. Everyone is suspicious of everyone else. It's an open brawl between the good guys and the bad guys and, except for the uniforms, it would be hard to tell the difference between the two.

It's an interesting story and is well done. You might expect to end up depressed and wonder where our nation is headed. Well, some people enjoy  this entirely negative view of the world. If you're not one of them, don't say you weren't warned. In any case, it's a well done movie.

4132226,5,B003JZCVT6,"Don was the initial appeal for me in this movie to begin with. He literally carries the backbone of the whole movie. But thats just my opinion. The movie of course as you already know takes place in Brooklyn the one and only. And this movie takes on a trinity sight theme where the movie revolves around the points of view of three men all living working and interracting amongst each other without actually knowing of each others' existance (to a point anyway). There is a build up of little moments where one person's actions are shown and involve an effect on another character's actions.

Theres a lot of action in this movie. To the point where it is ruthless and it definitely delivers at the end. The characters are very deep, emotional and complex ( while still remaining their sense of masculinity(sp). Within the storyline) You can actually feel for these men and their problems and their agendas. there is the undercover, the hasbeen, and the religious crook .

Each actor delivers their role excellently.",1337817600,4,1016,4.767045454545454
4132227,2,B003JZCVT6,"<strong>Brooklyn's Finest</strong> (Antoine Fuqua, 2009)

After making a couple of not-widely-seen-but-critically-acclaimed thrillers, Antoine Fuqua stunned the world in 2001 with <em>Training Day</em>, a tense, tight, completely solid thriller that won Denzel Washington a slew of Best Actor awards, including the Academy's. Fuqua had been Washington's choice to direct, and it looked like Washington had been right; the world was Fuqua's oyster. Then, in quick succession, came <em>Tears of the Sun</em> (forgettable) and <em>King Arthur</em> (are you kidding me?). Four years later, <em>Shooter</em>, which I have been told is actually a very good movie; like almost everyone else, I haven't seen it. Given that track record, the idea of doing <em>Training Day 2</em> must have haunted Fuqua daily. Enter <em>Sleeper Cell</em> writer Michael Martin, who had a script that begs every possible comparison with <em>Training Day</em>, albeit deconstructed--in the same way that you can go to a swanky restaurant and order deconstructed cheesecake and get a smear of cream cheese, a glass of milk, a vanilla bean, and a graham cracker, all artfully arranged on a plate five times the size it needs to be. Which, now that I think about it, is a fantastic way to describe <em>Brooklyn's Finest</em>. And to put the cherry on top of the deconstructed cheesecake, Fuqua returned to the well, brought Jake Hoyt back, and moved him across the country.

Jake Hoyt 2's name is Sal, and he is of course played by Ethan Hawke. He's trying to keep his head above water on a cop's salary in Brooklyn. Not an easy thing to do; some would say impossible, if you're an honest cop. And there are all too many opportunities to become corrupt in his day-to-day existence. Then there are the older, more experienced, guys who kind of act as the angel and the devil balancing out Sal's neutral path: Eddie (Richard Gere), a straight shooter a few days from retirement who finds himself obsessed with a missing young woman, and Tango (Don Cheadle), a guy who's been undercover so long he's starting to identify with the criminals--and who a shady FBI agent (Ellen Barkin) wants to send back in to inform on, and possibly kill, Tango's childhood friend Caz (Wesley Snipes). The three stories run in parallel (and as far as we know, these guys do not know each other), all converging on a single point in time and space.

If that cast list, save Cheadle and (arguably) Gere, sounds like a who's-who of nineties movie stars whom you've been wondering about the status of for the last ten years, let me also mention Will Patton (whose career was killed by <em>The Mothman Prophecies</em>, which almost destroyed Gere's as well), Lili Taylor (the execrable 1999 remake of <em>The Haunting</em>), and Michael Kennneth Williams (<em>Bringing Out the Dead</em>). There is a <em>lot</em> of talent in this movie, though it never quite coheres the way it should. This is a function of the movie's pace, which in the metaphor above is the five-times-too-big plate; the movie stretches almost two hours and fifteen minutes. While this can be done, and done well (viz. <em>Army of Shadows</em> elsewhere this ish), it's not here. Fuqua and/or Martin never seems quite sure what to do with all that space, so instead of utilizing it wisely, we get five-minute scenes to illuminate a single character point that could have been illustrated as easily, and as richly (while still avoiding emotional shortcuts), in a single minute.

Somewhere inside this movie is a brilliant, award-winning thriller waiting to burst free. <em>Brooklyn's Finest</em> is not it, though on the upside you get to watch a lot of very good actors, some of whom you may not have seen for years, do what they do best. **",1333065600,,3755,5.022471910112359

4132237,5,B003JZCVT6,"This 2009 cop film stars Richard Gere, Don Cheadle and Ethan Hawke.  Each one has his own personal melodrama going on and each one is prone to lots of gun violence.  The film is rife with action, emotion and inevitable conclusions.  And it moves so fast I couldn't keep my eyes from the screen waiting to see what would happen next and how it would all turn out.  I wasn't disappointed.  The screenwriter put all the right pieces together and directing and special effects made it all seem real.

Of course though it wasn't real. Everything was quite a bit larger than life.  Richard Gere was the soon-to-be retired cop with one week on the job.  He's lonely and depressed and even contemplates suicide. Don Cheadle is an undercover cop implanted in the middle of a drug gang.  His good friend, played by Wesley Snipes, has just got out of jail and Cheadle has a moral dilemma about setting a trap for him, especially when Ellen Barkin, in an exceptional performance as a hard boiled drug agent, pushes him too hard.  He sprouts a lot of dirty street talk which gave a certain authenticity to the role.  And then there is Ethan Hawkes.  He's a religious Catholic who is overburdened with too many mouths to feed and a pregnant sick wife.  He needs money badly and cash seems to be around when drug busts happen.  How this all plays out includes lots of gunplay and blood.

This film certainly kept my eyes glued to the screen and satisfactorily transported me to an imaginary world that was pure entertainment, the ending being all tied up in a neat little predictable package.  If you like cop films, you'll love this one.",1296345600,3,1623,4.56401384083045

4132239,4,B003JZCVT6,"Having moved to upstate New York a few years ago, I was feeling nostalgic for my native New York City, right around the time this film debuted.  So even though I am not an action fan, I decided to check it out.  Expecting the standard shoot-`em-up action flick, I was pleasantly surprised to find some unexpected twists and a generous helping of genuine suspense among the usual gun battles and stereotypical violence.

Don Cheadle, who has made a great impression on me in the past 15 years or so, plays an undercover detective who, after infiltrating a gang of drug dealers, has been asked by the police brass to help take down an associate (Wesley Snipes) who once saved his life while he was setting up his undercover alias in prison.  Richard Gere is completely convincing as a career officer on the cusp of his retirement and pension, whose greatest achievement appears to be staying alive in one of the worst precincts in Brooklyn, while never firing his gun or distinguishing himself in anything but detached survival.  And Ethan Hawke rounds out the trio of ""good cop/bad cop/indifferent cop"" as a dedicated family man who is not above delving into the sinister side of corruption to try and find a better life for his ailing wife and adoring kids.

The plot to Brooklyn's finest was a bit confusing on first view, if only because the juxtaposition of the numerous characters made it difficult to sort out who was who, what was what, and even who was up to what, on the first sit-through.  But repeated viewings of the DVD have served to clarify some of the more confusing moments, and the film holds up well to the scrutiny of multiple screenings.  I have watched the film several times with friends, and all have found it to be very good entertainment.  More importantly for me, it satisfied my craving for a piece of home; I found it very vividly brought back the sights and sounds of the city for this transplanted New Yorker.

Sadly, the movie does not live up to its potential. The dialogue is clichd and predictable. The story, even though it has multiple intersecting threads, is one-dimensional. Worst of all, there is very little exploration of what, deep down, motivates and drives each character. All this has the result of making it difficult to care about what happens during the course of the film, even for the characters who are meant to be sympathetic.

Each story features a policeman, and they all are in some sort of trouble: Salvatore ""Sal"" Procida (Ethan Hawke), a corrupt detective who really needs money for his family; Eddie Dugan (Richard Gere), a tired veteran officer, just one week before his retirement; and Clarence ""Tango"" Butler (Don Cheadle) an undercover officer who thinks he has been working undercover for too long. They are all in desperate situations in different ways, and they are all in need of some help.

""Brooklyn's Finest"" benefits from strong performances from the actors (including Wesley Snipes as drug dealer and Bran F. O'Byrne as Sal's fellow officer), and the real Brooklyn locations give credibility to the film, of which screenplay (by Michael C. Martin), however, suffers from all too familiar storylines and stock characters of the genre, as well as the underwhelming climax that look contrived.

Antoine Fuqua did a better job in ""Training Day"" (with Ethan Hawke as a rookie cop), a taut thriller in which human morality plays a vital role.

But I can't blame them because the scripting was questionable. While there were some gems in the writing, the dialogue also felt stiff, sometimes random, and incongruous throughout. Pacing was sluggish and editing left many gratuitous and protracted violence and sex scenes. (Note that I have no problem with sex or violence as long as it advances the story or character(s) in some way.)

It wasn't all bad though. The mood set throughout the film--accomplished by the excellent lighting, coloring, and angles--dug its way into me and refused to let go.

4132253,3,B003JZCVT6,"Training days Antoine Fuqua returns with a cop story (actually three) but this time on the East coast. The title is a misnomer because the cops are anything but the finest. Ethan Hawke is the first cop who is corrupt and wants enough money for the down payment for a new house. Richard Gere is a cynical veteran who is hated by his colleagues and has seven days left until his retirement after 22 years on the job. Don Cheadle the third cop wants to be away from the action and is looking for a desk job in the department. The movie follows their lives and incidents until the climax where they all meet. I thought the writing for the most part was very weak. Richard Gere was IMHO completely miscast and Don Cheadle looked indifferent. Ethan Hawke acted and looked the part of a desperate cop without reason well. The movie is about Brooklyn and so the locations are new and different, not the same old ones from Manhattan. I thought I would get some new Brooklyn sights but the director could not entirely resist shooting the Manhattan skyline. The movie was bearable for at least one viewing.

It's too bad the NYPD can't sue for libel. Almost nothing in this stupid movie was even a slight exaggeration of the reality of working as a police officer in New York city: in this movie senior police officials are all busy covering up shootings by police officers, police officers enter drug dens armed but without wearing helmets, every officer is a racist....

Not necessarily the first group of actors you'd think of when considering the genre, Gere, Cheadle, Hawke, and Snipes all impress, both on their own and as an ensemble. Supporting roles are also incredibly well performed, putting this film at the top of my list of this year's standouts.

4132260,3,B003JZCVT6,"First, I have to say I love all the actors in this movie. They really did a great job with their characters and gave them depth and conflict. This movie is about a bunch of Brooklyn cops who struggle with being a good cop while circumstances and society pulls them in the other direction of being a bad cop. While these four cops are not all together and have their own struggles, somehow they are all linked together and end up causing the big final ending of the movie.

Overall, the movie didn't reach what it was looking for. While it tried to provide connection between the character's situation, it felt disconnected and parts and disjointed. The editing was not the best as it jumped from one scene to another. While the movie kept me throughly entertained and focused, it is not something that I would watch over and over.

Furthermore, I find that the DVD quality isn't at its finest. I am not sure if it is the DVD itself or the movie but there would be a lot of parts where it got super quiet so I had to turn up the volume, followed by a sudden loud noise and then the movie is super loud again and was not consistent throughout. In fact, I believe the music was a lot louder than the dialogue so it was difficult to hear everything.

The ending was also totally rushed. It did a good job building up to the ending but then, it just happened in a pretty predictable pattern and then I thought to myself, that was it?

This is a movie that definitely makes you think and question morality. It shows that cops are only human and did a good job of attempting to tie the different stories together. However, the ending was pretty rushed and overall, I felt it could have been so much more.

There is absulutely NO redemptive value to this piece of trash. Good actors, with of course the usual exception of limited-brained Gere, exploiting their box office appeal and thus degrading themselves to the level of ""has-beens"" looking for a place to die.

The acting was superb with Westley Snipes, Ethan Hawke, Don Cheadle and Richard Gere playing convincing roles. The story was depressing and one that I would call a ""slice of life"" type of movie. There were several stories about the individual cops that brought them to the same physical place toward the end, but not a real central plot that had a beginning and end. It was like looking into the lives of the cops, lives that were pretty depressing to begin with and didn't get much better as the story unfolded. It was a movie where you could see the possibility of a way out or a resolution, but they somehow always missed the mark.

The movie was more of a character study of the cops with glimpses into what made them behave in the ways they did. I felt sympathy and some respect for each of them by the end, but felt pretty depressed at their situations. The movie was over 2 hours and seemed a little long at times, but there was plenty of action throughout, a few times shocking enough that it made me jump in my seat.

The movie is very well done with a great cast. It was good to see Wesley Snipes back to form; he's been a bit ""off"" since the last&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blade/dp/B002HFWAYU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blade</a>&nbsp;movie (hopefully he'll be just as good in the upcoming Gallowwalker). But Wesley is really only a costar in Brooklyn's Finest; the real standouts are Ethan Hawke, Don Cheadle and Richard Gere.

In Brooklyn's Finest you follow three cops through some very trying times in a very bad neighborhood. Hawke is a down on his luck narc detective; Cheadle does an outstanding deep cover detective struggling to get his true life back; and Gere is a depressed and unmotivated beat cop within days of retirement.

But Director Fuqua intertwines enough action into the story to keep the viewer interested during the ups and downs, and then ultimately connects all of the dots brilliantly by the credit-roll.

Set in present-day Brooklyn, we follow three separate then later intertwined stories of three cops, two at their wit's ends and one at the end of his career. Don Cheadle (solid performance as always) has the best role out the three. He plays an undercover cop who struggles with crossed loyalties. He's excellent at what he does, but he wants out -- and can't.

Ethan Hawke is a cop also waist-deep in personal conflict. His wife's pregnant with twins, their house is a health hazard, and he's barely got enough money to make it. Temptation abounds in the drug bust trade, and his soul is up for grabs.

Richard Gere (surprisingly good in this role!) is a cop about to retire with barely nothing to show for save for a painfully mediocre career, and he doesn't necessarily see anything wrong with that.

Brought to you by the same guy behind ""Training Day"", ""Brooklyn's Finest"" suffers from a ""been-there-done-that"" feel. The basic storyline follows 3 police officers and how they cope with the day-to-day grind of the job, and how some bow under the pressures where the only difference between the crooks and cops is the uniform.

""Brooklyn's Finest"" tackles corruption in the police department, racism, class warfare and a variety of today's ills. And I think that's where it's problem lies. Instead of telling us 1 story really well, it tries to tackle too much and because it introduces so many storylines and elements, none are given the depth they should have received.

Still, this isn't a bad film, it's definately worth a rental, but I don't recommend a purchase as I don't this there is much re-watch value with the film.",1282176000,3,1057,4.96045197740113
4132280,2,B003JZCVT6,"With big names like Richard Gere, Don Cheadle, Ethan Hawke and Wesley Snipes, it comes as no suprise that ""Brooklyn's Finest"" has no shortage of good acting.  Add to that some nice work from Ellen Barkin, Will Patton, and an excellent cameo by Vincent D'Onofrio and there is no way to fault the cast.  Antoine Fuqua directed the movie; he was also the director of 2001's ""Training Day"".  With such an array of talen, it is highly unfortunate that ""Brookyn's Finest"" isn't a better movie.

It might seem easy to blame the screenplay.  Michael C. Martin is the first-time screenwriter responsible for what seems like a collection of cop action/drama cliches.  His only other writing credit is an episode of ""Sleeper Cell.""  But it's very difficult sometimes to say what changes were made to a screenplay throughout the production.  Often a solid screenplay gets chopped up, rewritten, and just generally messed around with by the time we see the final product onscreen.  What ends up as the final cut of the movie is very often something considerably different than what was written on the page.

The deleted scenes, included with the special features, are fairly illuminating as there are a few sequences that probably deserved to be left in.  Some strong acting and character-deepening scenes can be found with Gere and Hawke.  Fuqua's director's commentary is interesting and insightful.  The featurette I appreciated most was ""From the MTA to the WGA"" which focuses on screenwriter Martin and his journey from being a subway worker turned screenwriter.  They say the writer gets screwed, and in this case that is sadly true.  I think that Michael C. Martin wrote a good screenplay - heck, how could it not have had something of interest to attract all these top notch actors?  But along the way, the thing got gutted.  What we're left with is another, seemingly familiar, story of good cops gone bad.",1282003200,2,1902,4.89375

However, this film was trying so hard to be gritty, it just ended up being boring for me.  None of these usually talented actors showed any spirit - it was like they were being beaten down by the violent, depressing story amid a dark and gloomy setting.  Most of the film is quite literally dark, and muddy looking.  There are sporadic scenes of intense violence, but no real emotion.

4132282,4,B003JZCVT6,"I enjoyed Brooklyn's Finest, although I did have a few complaints which I will list first.  The three storylines were rather distinct, and other than by location, they were not linked.  I would have preferred to see more interaction between the characters other than random chance meetings on the street, but I think the storyline still works in the manner in which it was presented.  Additionally, the movie didn't need to be set in Brooklyn, and Brooklyn played no significant part in influencing the storyline, other than providing public housing projects for the drug-ridden backdrop.

Onto the movie itself; it's a melancholy drama, depressing and dark.  The cinematography underscores the gritty nature of the BK projects, and the lives of those affected by the drug trade.  The three main characters, Gere, Hawke, and Cheadle, are effective in portraying their respective characters.  Some have said that Cheadle's character was the most sympathetic, but I found all three storylines to be engaging.  Wesley Snipes makes a welcome addition- I think this was Snipes' first movie following his tax evasion sentencing.

**SOME SPOILERS FOLLOW**

The DVD contains a few deleted scenes, which in my opinion, were rightfully deleted.  One of the scenes shows Don Cheadle's confrontation with the NJ State trooper in more detail.  The deletion of this scene better enhances the tension in Cheadle's character when he describes his inner conflicts to his superior, Bill.  Another one of the deleted scenes ties up some of the loose ends.  Snipes' character is shown alive (unbelievable glad they deleted this) and Richard Gere's character is shown enjoying his retirement in Connecticut.  I prefer the ambiguous ending of the original.

This dark cop drama is so gritty that I could feel the urban dirt collecting on my skin, and my mind recalled the peculiarly sour-sweet dieselish stink of uncollected trash common to the city's hardest neighborhoods.

This is the story of three individual cops in Bedford-Stuyvesant whose fates intersect one night in a crime-ridden housing project. Ethan Hawke is a cop with a family rapidly outgrowing his tiny mold-infested house. Desperate to get his pregnant wife and his two kids into a better place, he shows no compunction in stealing from thieves. Don Cheadle is an undercover officer gone so deep that he has to step out of line to protect a gang leader. Richard Gere is about to retire. He's also about to eat his gun.

Eddie is on the final days of his job.  Sal is struggling with his job and family life and Clarence is conflicted in his position as an undercover and the problem of betraying his best friend Caz (Wesley Snipes) who just got out of prison and is looking to reclaim his spot on the streets of Brooklyn.  All three of the characters are suffering from mid-life crises and are seeking a way to make life easier from themselves in their respectful lives.  But the daily grind of work, the decaying environment and the uneasy aura of death hanging around their lives along with personal guilt makes it harder and harder every day.  Can these three survive the mean streets as solid members of being Brooklyn's Finest?

A grim and gritty film that has it's fair share of annoying cliches but don't let that deter you from watching this interesting film.  I liked how the film focuses on the mid-life crises of these characters instead of trying to make them younger than they actually are.

After hearing that Antoine Fuqua was making another thought provoking crime drama, I couldn't wait to watch this movie.  I assumed he was going to apply the same gritty ultra-realism that he did in Training Day, and he did.  The only thing, I didn't see Brooklyn's Finest as quite as a compelling story as Training Day.  So, I guess I had my sights set too high for this one.  As good as it was, I didn't seem to appreciate it much on the first viewing.  Upon a second viewing though, the movie began to grow on me.

Snipes, Gere, Cheadle, Hawk - they all give first rate performances.  Scenery and story play well to the performances given.  I think this movie will never reach the status of a Training Day caliber movie, but if you liked that movie - then you will want to watch Brooklyn's Finest also.  To be fair, Brooklyn's Finest should stand on its own without comparison to be appreciated.  Fuqua's style as a director is so natural and realistic and with this genre, it pays off.

All this does is increase confusion and waters down whatever one is trying to tell in each of the independent stories etc... I'm surprised that the writer for this movie doesn't understand this basic concept.
  b.  This is another typical Hollywood  (ie liberal) film in which cops are depicted either as corrupt, lazy and burnted out, and thugs.  It's ironic that the title is ""Brooklyn's Finest"", which would give one the impression that this film is actually about the best of the NYPD.  Rather, it's a highly negative view (ie what most liberals think) of the police in general.

3 reasons
Grier - Love
Cheadle - Honor
Hawke - Family

Richard Grier, a veteran cop, days from retiring is asked to train new officers. Disillusioned and bitter, Grier doesn't want to do more than he has to. Looking for love in all the wrong places (he is sleeping with a coke using prostitute), he seems like a drunk and lazy cop who really doesn't care about justice or policing anymore until he sees something he just can't let go. When the death of his ex-trainee pushes him to take a stand, we aren't surprised, nor are we encouraged.

Cheadle is an ambitious undercover narcotics officer who has sacrificed and lost his wife to the job. Desperately wanting a promotion, Cheadle is willing to do anything including setting up his drug dealing friend (played by Wesley Snipes). As they struggle to maintain status in the drug community, things soon get wildly out of hand and a drug war is underway.

Ethan Hawke plays a struggling drug officer who is just trying to make ends meet for his ""ever growing"" family. Hawke, feeling pressure to get a new house (because his wife has asthma and is having pregnancy complications related to mold), plans to do the unthinkable. And no, murdering drug dealers to buy your family a new house isn't a good enough reason to kill even if they aren't any loss to society.

As the three officers converge in a semi-spectacular finale, we are not too surprised about their outcomes. Would I recommend this movie? Not really, there was nothing too original or different about the plot, no surprises. In essence, Cheadle, Grier and Hawke have played these characters before (or something close to it) and didn't do anything new with the roles, but what merits the 3 star rating was the fact that there were veteran actors who tried to do a decent job with what they had (a script that lacked luster). And while the film was dark and attempted to offer the gritty side of law enforcement (which I enjoy), I am not sure that this film delivered. So while the views of Love, Honor and Family appeared on the surface to be good reasons for the decisions they made, they didn't justify in my mind, their actions.",1280966400,,2158,4.6266318537859

The action scenes are well done but its hard to develop much rooting interest for the 3 cops portrayed because each becomes 'corrupted' in his own way so their virtues no longer matter. Richard Gere's character as an example is totally unlikeable, yet he winds up the only one with any sort of 'redemption' at the end but he's still unlikeable.

4132300,5,B003JZCVT6,"The intermingled stories of three cops with his fears, deceptions and ambitions are depicted through this notable script.

Eddie (Richard Gere) is a self-destructive officer whose date of jubilation is very close: just seven days. He is not precisely a good model to follow and so he is motive of mock by most of his colleagues and forced to make the last crusade in order to dictate instructions to the new generations of cops to guide them in these dangerous locations. Sal (Ethan Hawks) is a corrupt cop with many hidden secrets, extremely worried about the health of his wife and so, disposed to get some resources to leave his neighborhood, specially when his doctor makes him the crude warning. And Tango (Don Cheadle) works under covered into a drug affair and he will have to betray a drug dealer Cox (Wesley Snippes) who eventually has become his best friend.

Well narrated with admirable insights worthy of the great Noir genre, the role of Don Cheadle is by far the most complex of all given the circumstances. And Hawks assumes role with many resemblances of a modern Faust.

4132301,4,B003JZCVT6,"The story line of Brooklyn's Finest is actually a good one.  Excellent plot with some great support and scenery in and around inner city Brooklyn.  Here you have three officers at various stages of their careers with their own personal issues regarding family and life.  Each one is left to sort out his problems in their own way.  And although you sense they want to break rules to get over some very difficult situations, they also have some very positive qualities that only tends to make this is an even more intense story.

I am simply amazed at how quickly you come to know each character and what each faces.  Gere plays a beat cop nearing retirement, a bit of a loner and an outcast who has values but seems very lost.  Hawke plays an intense detective who has a family and some loyal friends and who has some major choices to make.  Cheadle plays an under cover officer wanting to become a detective and to get out of the line of fire.  His life is also in turmoil.  But you cannot help but like these three characters for their passion for their lives.  Although grim, life goes on and they keep at it trying with hope beyond hope that something will work out.

Cheadle is working on the gang that is lead by Wesley Snipes.  This is a different character for him to play from my limited Snipes perspective.  I have always seen him playing more of a hero type.  When I first saw him in the movie, I thought he was someone else.  Pretty cool.  He has his own intensity and does a great job of acting.

There is enough to keep you going in the movie, it is rated R and the rating bar relates the reasons why.  Yet, the plot is overall a plus.

One treat is Vincent D'Onofrio appearing in one scene with Eathan Hawke, if you saw the movie Staten Island it is a pretty cool reversal of roles.  D'Onofrio does a good job in his dialog and is just excellent.

I think there are some suprises for sure, where it falls a little flat is where you are not surprised at some of the outcome.

Still and all, this is a picture worth viewing knowing that there is more of a melancholy mood to it.  Knowing some who are officers and some who have been, for sure, the surreal nature of the movie is an attempt to show the edges of life on the force.  Brooklyn's finest could have done more to show officers at their best as well.

4132305,5,B003JZCVT6,"Brooklyn's Finest is an outstanding, gritty thriller with lots of action, suspense and superlative acting. This is not for the faint of heart with all of its violence; but if you can stand it you will be amazed by this film. While some people have written that the film starts out slow and builds up the pace toward the end, the film grabbed me by the throat from the very word go and it never let go of me until the very final frame. The plot moves along at a very good pace and there's plenty of solid, well done character development. The cinematography and choreography shine all the way through and the script was well written. The casting was well done, too.

When the film starts, we soon meet three New York City police officers working in a very high crime section of Brooklyn where there is a public housing project, an incident of a cop killing a kid and drug dealing as well. Eddie has worked for 22 years on the force and he is now only 7 days away from retirement with a pension he has longed for even though by the time we meet him he's a shell of a man with a drinking problem, interpersonal difficulties with his estranged wife and few friends. Indeed, the only person Eddie truly connects with is a hooker named Chantel (played wonderfully by Shannon Kane). In addition, there's Tango (aka Clarence, played by Don Cheadle) who's been working undercover with drug dealers for so long he's having trouble remembering who he really is; Tango is desperate to get off the assignment with its street work and have a desk job as a detective. We also get to know Sal (Ethan Hawke) who is also desperate to get his wife and kids out of their dingy, moldy home into a much better one--so desperate, in fact, that Sal has actually been grabbing some of that drug money for himself, not caring what rules he breaks or who he harms in the process.

You may think I've given too much of the plot away but I assure you that I haven't. The only other thing I will tell you is that for quite some while in this film, the three principle characters (Eddie, Tango and Sal) lead separate lives but near the end they all converge with some degree of interaction at the troubled housing project in Brooklyn. The last 25 minutes or so of the film are both powerful and memorable; but there is quite a bit of violence so I wouldn't suggest this for young children.

In addition, the DVD comes with some great bonus features including deleted scenes; the theatrical trailer and featurettes including ""Chaos & Conflict: The Life of a New York Cop;"" ""Boyz N the Real Hood;"" ""An Eye for Detail: Director Featurette"" and ""From the MTA to the WGA: Writer Featurette."" Look also for superb performances by Brian F. O'Byrne as Officer Ronny Rosario; Lili Taylor as Sal's wife Angela and Ellen Barkin as Agent Smith.

Brooklyn's Finest paints a bleak picture of life both on the New York City police force and in the public housing projects of Brooklyn but a lot of what we see here is tragically all too real. I don't think poilce corruption and severe burnout is wide spread; but these are topics that deserve consideration. I highly recommend this film for fans of the actors in it; and people who enjoy gritty crime dramas and thrillers with dark themes will want to add this to their collections.",1279238400,4,3286,4.489966555183947

4132309,4,B003JZCVT6,"From Training Day and Tears of the Sun director Antoine Fuqua, Brooklyn's Finest revolves around three different cops who have habitually neglected not doing the proverbial right thing.

For Tango (Don Cheadle), his deep undercover work and bevy of empty promises from his superiors make him start questioning his loyalty to the badge, or to the drug kingpin (Wesley Snipes) who has befriended him.  For Sal (Ethan Hawke), corruption has become a necessity as his sickly pregnant wife (Lili Taylor) and family depend on him to move them into a bigger home, and his descent into darkness only proceeds to get deeper and deeper.  While Brooklyn's Finest offers nothing we haven't seen plenty of times before in various other cop dramas, what it does well is provide three separate character studies, leading them all to a shocker of a finale that manages to bring them all together.  Gere is more than solid, but its Cheadle and Hawke who truly shine in their roles, while seeing Wesley Snipes back in a theatrically released big budget film is a welcome sight indeed.

To this day, I have to be honest and say I've had very little, if any respect for police officers. They appear nice so they can fit the bill as civil servants, and it's re-assuring to believe they're doing something to ""protect and serve."" But when it comes down to it, more often than not, it feels like most officers (the common ones for traffic violations and domestic disturbance) lack any kind of subtlety, tact, and real ability to make judgment calls for the greater good when it truly matters. I'm sure I speak some truth for a good majority of people who've gotten tickets or witnessed a ticket being given for some stupid or asinine reason that only resulted in ill will toward the officer, his quota of tickets being met, and a ruined day for the victim. A few movies spring to mind when addressing the issue of corruption within the police force, but most often for me, Lakeview Terrace and Antoine Fuqua's last effort in Training Day. We all know crooked cops are out there abusing power, bullying people, and making lives miserable, but Fuqua creates an amazing inverse effect here in Brooklyn's Finest. The film is essentially about 3 cops with 3 different paths and all of the hardships they've faced to their eventual breaking points. It's a dark, gritty, and emotionally-charged piece of work that really opened my eyes to just how hard it is to live with the scrutiny of being a cop, doing what's right, and the fine line that exists between good and bad, all while being on some sort of proverbial edge, be it poverty, loss of identity, or the desensitization of life in general. The movie itself starts off with a bang and literally just builds up the tension from there till all 3 cops cross each other by the end. Thanks to some fine writing by Michael Mitchell and a great cast in Gere, Cheadle, and Hawke, the movie results in a great layout. But I have to say my biggest surprise is in the return of Wesley Snipes. Making his first theatrical appearance since Blade: Trinity, it's good to see he's still got some screen presence and that he can really perform when given a good script and director. Kudos to Fuqua for handpicking him and making such an incredible film that has certainly earned my respect for only the finest men in law enforcement, but also raised my hatred for the bad ones.

Video - 4.5

Brooklyn's Finest looks quite excellent on this BD by Starz / Anchor Bay. I've never actually been to Brooklyn, but a lot of the colors and imagery captured in the cinematography give the entire movie a very lifelike, yet visceral quality. It's a very vibrant and sharp picture that I personally feel reflects the story, characters, and film's progression very well. Flesh tones look especially natural, and surrounding colors within the settings and props do a great job adding a sense of depth and dimensionality that really gives it that HD pop. Black levels are deep and inky with a good amount of shadow delineation amongst the more darkly-lit scenes, providing for easy discernability between people, objects, and backgrounds. Contrast is perfect as well and makes for a particularly resolute image in a lot of the closeup shots of actors' faces and their attire. Being the character drama that it is, it may seem strange, but my favorite scenes are the solo shots of the 3 cops with their faces directly to the camera in some for or another. Just seeing their facial expressions and reactions in such clarity really made the acting and story that much more powerful and articulate. The only problem I have with the presentation is the heavy amount of red lighting during Gere's scenes with his lady-friend. Not that it's a bad transfer, but the lighting itself can kind of irritate your eyes after a while. Other than that, the video quality is nearly flawless.

Audio - 4.5

The audio quality, much like the video, is near-reference. For a cop movie, there's actually not a whole lot of shooting till around the middle and end. With that said, the majority of the movie with its dialogue is clean and free of any distortion from the center channel. Ambient sound effects do an admirable job separating and panning respectively from the fronts and rears adding more of that Brooklyn immersion. The film's score and music supervision from the various night clubs offer an equally immersive experience and even pack some healthy LFEs from the heavier bass pieces. High and low ends are handled well between the background noises of the projects, the inside of apartments / complexes, and occasional vehicle racket. Gunshots and fisticuffs come off accurate with a very nice oomph and are probably the best aspects of the audio to compliment the corresponding intensity of the photography. This is another excellent effort from Starz / Anchor Bay.

Extras - 4.0

There isn't much in terms of extras other than a commentary by director Antoine Fuqua, about 30 minutes of behind-the-scenes coverage, and 30 minutes of deleted scenes. First off is the great commentary by Fuqua. He basically covers all the characters roles, their motives, what he was trying to convey through them, and what he ultimately wanted to show in this film's depiction about the hardships I mentioned above. It's a very informative commentary that shed a lot light, and he's quite the film-maker you can really tell is passionate about his work. The b-t-s footage more or less covers the film's premise, its inception on paper, how Fuqua came to direct, and the filming process. It makes for some pretty basic, bare-bones explanation, but makes you appreciate the attention to detail taken by Fuqua and his crew to actually go through the trouble of filming in Brooklyn and as close as they could to the projects without getting into trouble. He even went out of his way to cast people and civilians living around the area to add an extra level of authenticity, which is cool in my book. The deleted scenes, however, caught me by surprise the most. Normally, deleted scenes compose of snips and edits that probably just didn't make the movie flow as well. Here, it actually adds to the story and even makes for some very revealing plot points that, for whatever reason, I think should've been left intact. I won't spoil them, but I do recommend you give them a watch after the film, as there are some really good scenes not being used, there.

Overall - 4.5

I love what Antoine Fuqua did in Training Day: showing hopeful naivety, the rotten state of the world, and the thin line that separates a cop from doing great or terrible things because of those circumstances. He takes somewhat of an inverted approach here in Brooklyn's Finest by showing audiences that genuinely good cops do exist and that, even at their finest moments, don't get the respect they deserve because the world is indeed as jaded and messed up as we think it is. Brooklyn's Finest is a tough movie, and even a little disheartening if you think about it. But whatever you decide to take it as, it's still another finely-crafted film by one of my increasingly favorite directors. Presented with near-reference A/V quality and a deceptively sparse, but informative set of extras, Brooklyn's Finest comes highly recommended for cop movie fans.",1279065600,3,7238,4.760956175298805
4132311,4,B003JZCVT6,"""Brooklyn's Finest"" stars Richard Gere as burned-out veteran cop Eddie Dugan, just one week away from his pension and a fishing cabin in Connecticut.  Narcotics officer Sal Procida (Ethan Hawke) has discovered there's no line he won't cross to provide a better life for his wife and seven kids.  Clarence ""Tango"" Butler (Don Cheadle) has been undercover so long his loyalties have started to shift from his fellow cops to his prison buddy Caz (Wesley Snipes), one of Brooklyn's most notorious drug dealers.

When the NYPD's Operation Clean Up targets a drug-ridden housing project, Eddie, Sal, and Tango find themselves drawn to the same fatal crime scene.

Though the plot is overly familiar and the script often cliched, the three leads elevate the film with superb performances.  They believably convey the stress each is under as a working police officer, though the source of the stress differs from one to the other, and director Antoine Fuqua captures the grittiness and danger of a day in the life of a cop.

Bonus extras on both the Blu-ray and DVD versions include audio commentary with director Fuqua, the featurettes ""Chaos & Conflict: The Life of a New York Cop"" and ""Boyz N The Real Hood,"" and deleted scenes.",1278892800,,1223,4.912621359223301
4132312,2,B003JZCVT6,"""Brooklyn's Finest"" is one of those films where the trailer is better than the movie.  How can a movie with an all-star cast (Richard Gere, Don Cheadle, Ethan Hawke and Wesley Snipes) fail?  There is a business theory that suggests that if something worked in the past; it will work in the future with a little tweaking.  Not always true!  ""Brooklyn's Finest"" attempts to fuse the conceptual plots of ""Fort Apache: The Bronx"" and ""Crash"" into one seamless masterpiece.  What invariably happens is a convoluted montage of the two movies poorly conceived.

Although, Antoine Fuqua of ""Training Day"" fame directed ""Brooklyn's Finest,"" I was interested in discovering the screenwriter?  Upon further investigation, I discovered the screenwriter was Michael C. Martin, who revealed on an online blog that this was his first feature film.  Everything made sense!  You can have an all-star cast with a world class director, but if the writing is poorly written and developed, nothing can save the movie.  Martin could have been influenced by ""Fort Apache: The Bronx"" and ""Crash,"" but to blatantly rip off the concepts and under-develop the characters is a travesty.  It demonstrates a lack of thought into developing the high concept as well as ""lazy Intellectualism.""

This was an excellent opportunity to go into the inner sanctum of law enforcement and the underworld in ways that had not been done before.  With the cast and director set, the movie could have been a true blockbuster.  Instead it hopes to be a ""sleeper hit"" by going straight to DVD.

I recommend renting this movie from a ""Red Box"" kiosk to compare it to other crime dramas.  A Blockbuster or NetFlix rental would not be worth the money.

4132314,4,B003JZCVT6,"This movie hits all the right switches!
It's a gritty, dirty and unflinching police drama
set in one of Brooklyn's toughest crime precincts.
It's really the tale of 3 police men:

Richard Gere--The jaded, burned out, seen-it-all
veteran policemen who is only a week from retirement
and doesn't really have alot to live for outside of
being a police officer. No real love or family life.
Gere plays his role with both tenderness and sadness...
By this time, he is such a skilled veteran actor that
he can bring so many emotional nuances to a role
simultaneously with seemingly effortless flair.
He really captures the emptiness/loneliness of
his character to a tee!

Ethan Hawke--Plays the quintessential bad cop who will
do anything, and I mean ANYTHING!!--to bring in extra money
so he can give his family the better things in life that
a mere policemen's salary cannot afford in these tough
economic times. His character is completely amoral,
shady, ruthless, and will rob and kill anybody who gets
in his way! He is basically a criminal with a badge.
That opening scene in the car was a mutha! (-:

Don Cheadle--Plays the undercover cop who has infiltrated
the underworld of a ghetto crimelord, played by Wesley Snipes.
The two go back in history with each other from childhood,
but apparently Snipes character got locked up some time before
the story starts and is just getting out and back into the
streetlife again. Cheadle's character chose to join the side
of the law, yet at the same time keeping his nose in the streets
as to gain crediblity among the thugs who have been running
Snipe's criminal operations in his absence.
His conflict lies in his betrayal of Snipe's character
who he obviously has respect and affection for, and his
dedication to his job and duties as a member of
Brooklyn's Finest. He also wants that big promotion! (-:
He really plays his character with an edge that you don't
usually see Don Cheadle play, save for his role in
the very underrated ""Talk To Me"".

In the climax of the movie, these 3 main characters,
who have no personal knowledge of each other,
wind up in close proximity to one another as the
pendulum of fate swings in it's unpredictable path
and deals with them as it will.

Okay, now the downside of this movie is the fact
that the story is kind of disjointed in places (IMHO!)
I had to watch it twice to really feel it.
The ending is kind of anti-climactic really,
save Richard Gere's character's scene were he
inadvertenly saves the day for the women being
trafficked in sex slavery!
But the saving grace of this film are the stellar
performances of the actors and supporting cast who
bring an authenticity to this story can't be denied.
I enjoyed it and give it a four star rating overall.",1278633600,2,2744,4.6846473029045645

4132317,4,B003JZCVT6,"BROOKLYN'S FINEST as written  by Michael C. Martin and directed by Antoine Fuqua ('Training Day', 'Shooter') provides an intense study of the live of three Brooklyn policemen and details how they are all on the brink of being burned out by the grisly requirements of their work in one of the most crime infested areas in the country.  Richard Gere is Eddie, a veteran cop with seven days to go before retirement who is assigned to a couple of Rookies to be a role model: Eddie's only moments of tranquility come from alcohol and from steady encounters with hooker Chantel (Shannon Kane in one of the film's finest roles).  Don Cheadle is Tango, an undercover narcotics division cop assigned to a sting operation driven by the only female detective Ellen Barkin that involves a old friend Caz (Wesley Snipes): Tango is consumed by conflict and is mentally worn thin by his work.  Ethan Hawke is Sal, married to diabetic Angela (Lili Taylor), pregnant with twins: Sal has tried everything (even dirty cop tactics and maneuvers) to get enough cash to move his growing beloved family to a better home.  These three stories weave simultaneously  throughout the film and finally come together in a surprising twist at the end.

The film has the look of the subject of the movie: everything is dark, dirty, infested with vermin and all manner of crime, and intertwined with mean streets.  It captures the grit of the story and manages to allow us to understand each of the main characters.  There is a point of contention in the writing: a vast portion of the script is written (and subsequently delivered) in street talk so foul that it becomes annoying. Most of the dialogue within the gang scenes is not understandable: turn on the subtitles and the mystery of what is being said is not clarified at all.  This may make the film more realistic but it hides the simple ability to communicate verbally in the slang of the streets.  There is a considerable amount of unnecessary, sycophantic brutality and violence, but then that is what the film is about. There is some fine acting here, but be prepared for a lot of noise and violence.  Grady Harp, July 10",1278547200,,2151,4.721925133689839
4132318,4,B003JZCVT6,"Though many compare this policier as the French would call it to ""The Wire"" which I thought was a little over-rated, this drama despite flaws in the writing is saved by a great cast led by Richard Gere as a world weary cop counting the days to his retirement, Don Cheadle as a conflicted narc cop out to nab close friend/savior Wesley Snipes who saved his life in prison, and Ethan Hawke who out of desperation because of financial stress sets out to steal drug money from a bust. The latter two characters are fairly well drawn but Gere's character as written is un-developed to the point that we're left asking why is he in the first scene, ready to shoot himself.  We know he's in a dismal state of mind but the writer who's a first timer doesn't fill in the blanks as to why he's so suicidal. For instance is it guilt over a partner's death, the loss of his kids over a bitter divorce or the disappointment that he didn't make detective?  All these could've been a reason for his anguish if the writer wrote them in the script.  Gere has proved himself to be an excellent actor if the script is well developed as he showed us in ""Internal Affairs"" where he played a corrupt cop but here the writer and director have left him stranded.  Anyway the acting of the whole cast which includes Ellen Barkin as power-hungry D.A. is without reproach so on that basis I would give this a 3.5 or 4 but one wishes it could've risen to the level of Fuqua's ""Training Day"".  Ethan Hawke, by the way, is the standout of the three main characters in his portrayal of Sal, burdened and stressed out because of his wife's illness and the desire to move out of his neighborhood.",1278374400,,1663,4.386363636363637
4132319,2,B003JZCVT6,"First off, I hate The Wire. It is profanity laced nothingness with no humanity and watching the exact same plot season after season just didn't appeal to me at all! That being said as I had heard this film compared to The Wire which I did not I just could not get into it. I did find it quite depressing and just not believable.

The Director: I think Fuqua is Amazing. I enjoyed Training Day, Tears of the Sun and Shooter. I did not think this film was at all like Training Day...

Actors: I like all but Snipes who has done so many low budget cheesy martial arts wannabe flicks I had completely forgotten about him. Richard Gere, his character just depressed me.

The plot: I am not going to put spoilers and ruin it for anyone but I just did not feel like it all came together. It was a bit too dark with no light at the end of the tunnel...",1278374400,4,844,4.134146341463414
4132320,4,B003JZCVT6,"It takes a gifted director to weave together three different stories into one cohesive tale. Director Antoine Fuqua (TRAINING DAY) is just such a director. And this week's release of BROOKLYN'S FINEST proves that.

Taking place in the current streets of Brooklyn, the story focuses on three different policemen who work there, each dedicated to their job but also taking divergent paths as a result of the day to day struggles they face.

Ethan Hawke plays Sal, a family man who would do anything to protect and take care of his family. Unfortunately this includes stealing money from thieves that he busts or killing bad guys and taking their money. Sal has 4 kids, lives in a house filled with mold, has a wife who is pregnant with twins and ill due to the mold and is looking for a new place. All it takes is money. As a top cop in on numerous drug raids, this puts Sal in a position to take dirty money.

Don Cheadle plays Tango, a deep undercover cop who is perhaps the best of the three depicted here. Tango has gone undercover enough that he spent time in prison posing as a street hustler and drug dealer. But life on the inside is ruining his life on the outside. And with each passing day, Tango finds himself drawn deeper into the seedy world he now inhabits, changing his perception of reality from what he knew to what he is experiencing.

Lastly we have Richard Gere as Eddie. A street cop who has seen it all, Eddie is one week from retirement. Exposed to the worst that humanity has to offer, Eddie courts thoughts of suicide but carries forward looking forward to his last day. Eddie has tired of fighting the good fight only to see something worse replace it. He has given up hope for humanity. He just wants to move on.

As the movie progresses each of these characters never interact, but they do run into one another briefly. Sal is facing the temptations of selling his soul in an attempt to fulfill the family dream of a new house. With only days left till their dream home is gone, he must make that final choice of whether to pass over to the side of semi-villain or not.

Tango is trying to finish his turn undercover. Done in an attempt to make gold shield detective, his plans are disrupted when the FBI steps in and tries to force him into one last operation. They need a symbol of the drug kingpin world to go down, replacing the public's current image of the police as thugs after the shooting death of an innocent young man in the projects. And their target is Caz (Wesley Snipes), a man involved in drug transportation but also the man who saved Tango's life in prison. While on opposing sides, Tango still feels a debt towards the man.

Eddie is forced to work with the rookies just starting in the precinct. Unwilling to make it a pleasant experience, he still focuses on just making it through the day. Ignoring obvious crimes not taking place in his precinct, leaving a new partner in a touch situation, it is day by day for Eddie. But a moment will change all that as he leaves for a new life.

Fuqua does a tremendous job not only of making us care for each of these flawed characters, he moves from one story to the next with ease. Each tale reflects the other, each story focusing on policemen and how the temptations arise, how the stress of the job affects their decisions and how those decisions may not always be the right one.

No one is to blame in this world. Each character is driven by forces they have no control over. And each one takes a different path. And it is this tremendous job of storytelling that shows in the work of Fuqua and first time feature writer Michael C. Martin. As viewers, let's hope that both continue to offer films like this. Movies that make you think, that make you care and that entertain at the same time.",1278288000,6,3785,4.426724137931035
4132321,5,B003JZCVT6,"You would think that director Antoine Fuqua has a problem with cops. At least, that is the impression that you get when you watch his films about police matters. He was responsible for ""Training Day"" (2001), which won Denzel Washington a well-deserved Academy Award for his portrayal of a corrupt cop. Now, Fuqua returns with ""Brooklyn's Finest,"" another penetrating and unforgettable look at what goes on behind doors at police precincts.

If ""Training Day"" examined the behavior of a truly bad cop, ""Brooklyn Finest"" does the same with three policemen that are honest, but with flaws. Eddie (Richard Gere) is a 22-year veteran patrolman in the police force, who has just seven days left before retirement. Unfortunately and unexpectedly, and against his will, he is assigned to train rookies in some of the city's worst neighborhoods. As expected, those seven days will not go smoothly. On the other hand, Tango (Don Cheadle) is an undercover cop that is desperately trying to move away from this assignment, which is stressing him out. The only way out, as ordered by his superiors, is for him to deliver Caz (Wesley Snipes), a drug lord, to justice. Caz happens to be a Tango's good friend from the old days. And then there is Sal (Ethan Hawke), a vice cop with too many kids and two more on the way, and who is suffocated by debt. Out of desperation, it seems that his only way out is through some questionable acts. The movie slowly takes us to a dramatic end, in which the future of these men will be defined.

""Brooklyn Finest"" is dark, dramatic and sad, and it hits you hard. It is real life stuff - as it should be --, and makes you take a closer look at how stressful a cop's life can be. Gere, Cheadle and Hawk shine in their roles, supported by a superb cast that includes Will Patton, Ellen Barkin and Lili Taylor, with a small cameo by Vincent D'Onofrio. The DVD also features audio commentary by Fuqua, deleted scenes, and shorts on the life of cops in New York City, the director, and more. (USA, 2009, color, 132 min plus additional materials)

4132323,4,B003JZCVT6,"Director Antoine Fuqua (TRAINING DAY), with a script by first-time writer Michael C. Martin, delivers another gritty, violent and riveting cop drama about three officers facing life-defining crises.

There is really nothing new in the basic set-up of this picture.  We've all seen these kinds of cops before: the veteran uniformed officer, counting the days until is retirement, the undercover cop and the narcotics officer who has crossed over to ""the dark side"".

What makes BROOKLYN'S FINEST interesting is that these three overly familiar ""types,"" who never really interact in the picture except in the most inadvertent manner, are constantly surprising us by their actions.  We do not know how these individual stories will end until the final credits roll.

Officer Dugan (Richard Gere), separated from his wife, drinks on the job, visits a prostitute at night and does his best to avoid dealing with the rampant crime around him.  However, once he has actually retired, he puts his life at risk to redeem his career of indifference.

Officer Butler (Don Cheadle) has been working undercover to bring down drug gangs (even in prison) so long that he has lost all remnants of his personal life.  His wife has divorced him, and now his superiors want him to set-up former drug kingpin Caz (Wesley Snipes).  Butler must now decide where his true loyalties lie, with the Department or with the man who had saved his life in prison.

Officer Procida (Ethan Hawke), on the other hand, is doomed right from the movie's opening scene.  Tragically, with a large loving family, he has more to live for than the other two cops, but there is no hope.  His story has to end badly.  We just don't know how it will happen.

Director Fuqua's location filming brings s strong, frightening sense of reality to the proceedings.

The actors, particularly Hawke, deliver remarkable, award-worthy performances, and a fine cast of players, including Will Patton, Lili Taylor and Ellen Barkin, supports them.

My complaints on this film are minor.  The running time could have been a bit shorter and, like with most movies these days that deal with drug gangs, it's often difficult to understand what these particular characters are saying.
