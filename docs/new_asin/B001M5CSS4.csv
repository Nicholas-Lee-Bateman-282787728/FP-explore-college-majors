This is one of the training exercise routines that the Kuomintang (KMT) used under Chiang Kai-shek. Many of the finest Martial Arts experts in China (that were nationalist and fighting for China's freedom against the encroaching Communist threat) contributed to developing this drill. It was intended to develop fitness and preparedness for battle. It became the 'first form' taught in T'ien Shan P'ai by Master Wang Jyue Jen, the founder of T'ien Shan P'ai. Master Wang Jyue Jen was a Martial Arts instructor for the Kuomintang (KMT) under Chiang Kai-shek.
