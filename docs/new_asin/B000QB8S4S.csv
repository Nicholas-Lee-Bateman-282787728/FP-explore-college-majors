8195304,1,B000QB8S4S,the dvd had potential. but my version was in poor shape. i tried cleaning the dvd. it paused and skipped in areas. the dvd potential was good. if the quality would've been better!!! there were good areas that saved it. i would've paid more for a professional version if one was available. i am conspiratorial and checking the possibilities that we did not go to the moon. the dvd did help in some areas. i wonder if the dvd was altered. i have seen other versions with bigger view???  i will look for a better copy.,1233792000,,515,4.364583333333333
