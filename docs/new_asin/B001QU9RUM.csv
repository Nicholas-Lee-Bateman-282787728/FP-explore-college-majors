8398511,2,B001QU9RUM,"I love almost all of the Secret Chiefs 3 albums, with the sole exception of First Grand Constitution and Bylaws. Sadly, this dvd is largely reminiscent of that cd. Some of the songs/sets are great, but far more of them are just strange, self-masturbatory noise.",1337472000,,261,4.822222222222222
8398512,5,B001QU9RUM,"The music is excellent. The performance is excellent.

The problem for my taste is all the jerking off the editors did to this performance.

It's like the MTV music videos with 7 second scene changes. Once you get focused the scene. It changes and the camera actions does a swipe or zoom in or zoom out. One second scene here, two scene there, WOW now a actual SCENE got 9 WHOLE seconds.

The editing ruined the experience for myself.

Hey, you HOLLYWOOD HARD ONS!!!

Go back and learn something from the Lester Flatts and Earl Suggs Grand Ole Orpy show !
They actually focused on the Music!

The editors/producers/directors love to feel important these days.",1330214400,2,659,4.6869565217391305
8398513,5,B001QU9RUM,"Secret Chiefs 3 is one of the most criminally underknown projects in the music sphere.  Their name is a reference to Avatar-like beings, residing in the astral plane, who disseminate evolutionary spiritual and vibrational influence to receptive humans.  Trey Spruance-guitarist and ringleader-in particular, as an artist has a dearth of official film material to go alongside his colorful career(Mr. Bungle never released a live recording or video).  This is a fitting document for the Chiefs and for capturing their awesome stage presence and musical communication.
  The audio is outstanding whether you are listening in the stereo or surround settings.  The film is nice and moody as it should be for a band that plays in cloaks and is well edited.  I like the way they set up the flow of the show with different themes and various acoustic and electric instruments adding color.  Their seamless use of diatonic scales and odd time signatures is some of the most inventive, yet entirely groovy, music around.
  In addition to the live show, there is an eerie and surrealistic stop-motion animation film that you can watch with the Chiefs playing live as the soundtrack.  The filmmaker went to great pains to make the movie coincide with the circular logic of the music.  It is an awesome way to experience the music, it hits you completely different than when watching the musicians.
  There are one or two moments where the band seems to lose the beat and descend into a bit of chaos, but I can't fathom how they keep up with the countless, amazing turns in the music as well as they do.  That's the beauty of the live concert document.  Reminds us humans are behind great art, or in this case, Secret Chiefs.  Highly recommended.",1278979200,,1734,4.863481228668942
8398514,4,B001QU9RUM,"I've only watched the live show portion so far,but the multi angle cam shots are great! minus one star for the choppy digital remnants on one of the cams that got a bit annoying.can't wait to check the stop-motion part! i think i counted maybe 2-3 ""mess-ups"" during the live set but hey,as you all should know,a few missed notes are absolutely forgivable in return for such audio-superiority in presentation and execution! the world is in dire need of more bands with the musical approach SC3 has:not necessarily more world music hybrids, but more musical creations without artistic restrictions. SC3 can get away with almost anything because they do it with style and integrity. geah.",1242259200,,685,4.965217391304348
8398515,5,B001QU9RUM,"This DVD is absolutely ridiculous. I went into watching this with the hope of recreating the night I saw them a year ago, and what I got was that and much more. Just like when I saw them, it takes a bit for the band to loosen up, or warm up. But once they get going, especially after the Halloween theme song second set opener, they cook with rocket fuel. These guys fuse surf rock, middle eastern dirges, and metal into a molten lava eruption of sound. There is nothing like this!",1237593600,2,481,4.239130434782608
8398516,5,B001QU9RUM,"The live music performed and recorded here is amazing- 5 stars, easy. There's a great selection of songs: classic material, variations and extensions of previous recordings, along with some of the best mixed rare and unreleased music available. The audio alone would have made for a very strong CD release. However, I don't believe the stage performance is an essential component. Trey Spruance's SC3 always put on a great live show- I'm just not sure if it translates well to DVD. That said, at times, it is amazing to watch these musicians execute this beautifully idiosyncratic music. I suppose if fans are yearning to catch a glimpse of what a SC3 performance is, they will enjoy watching this. This is not to say that fan-made videos aren't abundantly accessible. What separates this DVD from fan-based content is its production. Furthermore, I have to insert a small criticism about one of the performers, Timb Harris. No doubt he is a talented multi-instrumentalist, even capable of playing Eyvind Kang's brilliant leads. However, there seems to be a great amount of camera time dedicated to him. His stage presence comes off as a bit egotistical and self-absorbed. Sort of like trying to watch Jeff Buckley perform. Smirking, smiling, and swaying in delight to your own playing is awkward to watch- let the fans take care of that. Jerry Lee Lewis transformed the perception of a piano and its player. I don't think Timb Harris is the person to do that for violin.  Anyway, that's all nitpicking. Again, I don't believe the visual footage is what matters. The music here is phenomenal; Spruance composes fantastic music and surrounds himself with incredible musicians. I just wish they included some Masada songs.
I'm not going to get into the stop-motion animation film by Tawd Dornfeld. Hopefully someone else can do a good job of critiquing it.
The DVD layout and artwork are beautiful. Altogether, this WOM release is a must own for fans.
A great live recording.",1236124800,4,1973,4.960725075528701
