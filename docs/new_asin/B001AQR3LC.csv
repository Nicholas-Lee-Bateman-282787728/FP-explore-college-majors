3462449,4,B001AQR3LC,This DVD is wonderful.  The entire series of Tudors is great.  And of course Jonathan Rhys Meyers is not bad to look at..haha...especially his eyes...Just a great DVD.,1251072000,,167,4.928571428571429
3462450,5,B001AQR3LC,The series just gets better every year.  It's good to see that the makers haven't ever taken too much dramatic license and stuck to the facts of history.i would recommend this show to anyone.  Such a shame there won't be a season 5.,1250726400,,232,4.372093023255814
3462451,5,B001AQR3LC,"My favorite season so far! Even with only 8 episodes as opposed to the average 10, The Tudors continues to 'Wow' me! Season Three introduces The Seymours, a ambitious family now royality, are a treat to watch! Queen Jane, portrayed by Annabelle Wallis, is a lovely character who you really become attached too. This season also welcomes back Mary Tudor, portrayed by Sarah Bolger, who's struggle is portrayed beautifully, and is often heart wrenching. The cast is packed with it's all stars, JRM, Henry Cavil, and James Frain, who give wonderfully portrayals. Frain and Meyers stepping up inparticular.
While the show is still as innacurate as ever, it's beyond entertaining and fun to watch, besides it's not a documentary, it's a drama, and it's chalked full of it! I definately recommend buying this season!",1249948800,4,810,5.052238805970149
3462452,5,B001AQR3LC,"For those of us who refuse to pay through the nose for cable, does anyone know when the Season 3 DVD set will be released?",1249862400,2,122,3.92
3462453,3,B001AQR3LC,"*This review is based upon the series as shown on cable network Showtime*

After the superlative season 2 of 'The Tudors' (which featured outstanding, Emmy-worthy performances by Natalie Dormer as Anne Boleyn and Jeremy Northam as Sir Thomas More), I was completely prepared for a ""letdown"" of sorts for series 3. After all, the true story (Henry VIII's marriage to Jane Seymour, birth of Prince Edward, death of Queen Jane and marriage to Anne of Cleves 2 years after that) goes at a relatively quick 4 years in English history. I was UNprepared for the economic downturn and PeaceArch's (the production company of 'The Tudors') decision to only have 8 episodes for 2009. If you thought seasons 1-2 were a whirlwind, prepare to be whip lashed by season 3.

Queen Jane's (Annabelle Wallis-in a replacement role from season 2's Anita Briem) relationship with Henry is so chaste and ""pure,"" and he swears she is his most ""beloved"" queen (which he also claimed toward Catherine of Aragon and Anne Boleyn). Unfortunately, Queen Jane dies of peripureal fever after giving birth to Prince Edward. Wallis's acting is measured-so measured in fact, you almost forget she is in the scene. She blends too well-unlike the performance given by Anne Stallybrass in the PBS production of 'The Six Wives of Henry VIII,' who captured the proper spirit of meekness and servitude necessary to BECOME Henry's 3rd wife.

Joss Stone as Anne of Cleves is a treat-although she is not featured enough in the series. Her scenes are few and far between, but she makes a fantastic impact (witness her scene with Lord Privy Seal Cromwell). There is a passion and fervor in her acting that is nothing but natural ability and talent. I look forward to seeing her more and hopefully she will be back in a guest starring role in season 4.

The gentlemen actors do acquit themselves beautifully. James Frain has been a purposeful, manipulative, charming and insecure Thomas Cromwell. His fall from grace is swift, merciless and ultimately degrading (spoiler-his execution is the MOST brutal and vindictive of any on 'The Tudors'). Henry Cavill is glossing into a solid actor-although the aging process for his Duke of Suffolk is not believable (he looks as though he is in his late 20's still-although the actor is only in his mid-20's). I have a complaint about Sir Francis Bryan though. Alan Von Sprang's portrayal is too lascivious, too voluptuous and thusly, mildly irritating. One can only hope he will not feature prominently for season 4.

Ultimately this season belongs and is owned by the king himself. I am continually amazed at the transformation Jonathan Rhys Meyers takes on as Henry VIII. Episode 5 (directly after Queen Jane's death) shows Henry and his Fool, Will Somers, locked in his chambers, drinking and reminiscing. The heartache, devastation and to some degree, hopelessness felt by Henry is palpable. This actor takes risks, doesn't hesitate to muck it up and make emotional vulnerability ""ugly."" Season 4 will end with his death, but Rhys Meyers has put his stamp on Henry VIII.

I have purposely not mentioned Katherine Howard (Tamzyn Merchant) because her story will be told in depth in season 4 (plus the portrayal was atrocious in the 3/4 of an episode she was in). This season was unsatisfying because it was too rushed, too condensed, too compacted. We can only pray for a return to the strength shown in season 2 for series 4. Overall, a 3-star effort ***.",1243900800,102,3454,4.915951972555746
3462454,5,B001AQR3LC,"I thoroughly enjoyed Season Three of ""The Tudors."" In my opinion, Jonathan Rhys Meyers gives his best performances ever as King Henry VIII. (Warning: the next few paragraphs contain details that some people may consider spoilerish, but seeing as how this is a retelling of British history, I'm sure most people know what's going to happen this season.)

At the start of Season Three, Henry is married to Jane Seymour, a gentle woman who thrills her husband by giving him a son. Unfortunately, Jane's reign as Queen of England is short-lived, and Henry soon finds himself mourning the only one of his wives thus far who he has truly loved (or at least been able to appreciate at the very end). The impertinent Thomas Cromwell then convinces Henry that a new marriage to Anne of Cleaves would benefit the country. Henry reluctantly goes through with the marriage, but never consummates the union because, according to him, his new bride ""looks like a horse."" It doesn't take long for Henry to tire of this marriage as well, and he passes the time in the company of the ditzy young Katherine Howard.

As all these romantic entanglements are taking place, England is threatened by rebels, Princess Mary becomes even more disenchanted with her unfortunate circumstances at court, and Thomas Cromwell becomes less and less popular, as members of the court desperately try to find a way to bring him down.

Overall, this was a fast-paced and entertaining season. I still miss the Anne Boleyn years, but ""The Tudors"" has managed to stay fresh and engaging. I don't see how this show can go on for more than another season, unless it continues after Henry's death, which would be a very interesting twist. Let's hope Showtime decides to go that route, because ""The Tudors"" could continue to reign for a very long time.",1242518400,165,1809,4.829032258064516
3462455,4,B001AQR3LC,"I am more than half way thru watching the 3rd season on Showtime. Although I am well aware that this is not necessarily based on historical accuracy I feel that a little more care could have taken in making the actors, especially Henry VIII character look their age and historical appearance in that particular time period. Henry, as well as his best friend look like they are stuck in a time warp being eternally in their 30's. Also it is well known that Henry VIII's weight already started to balloon after Jane Seymours death, whereas the actor as shown in the nearly nude scenes still has his perfect trim youthful body. Still an enjoyable and entertaining show -I wonder if it will end with Henry VIII death or will include further installments of Edward, Mary and Elizabeth I - after all they are Tudors, too.",1242259200,47,815,4.627586206896551
3462456,4,B001AQR3LC,"While I love The Tudors and fully expect season three to be excellent, I must refute nearly everything that has been said in the previous review.  The actor who plays Brandon is Henry Cavill, not Ryan Gellert.  While this person may be distantly related to Jane Seymour, the actor Henry Cavill is not.  Many people connected with the production of this television series (not film) admit that while the events they depict are based on history they are in no way an accurate portrayal of history, nor are they meant to be.  Also, sorry to call you out, but spell check your reviews before they are posted.  Incorrect spelling immediately discredits anything you say.  I was able to fact check your comments in just a few minutes.",1241913600,31,728,4.692913385826771
3462457,5,B001AQR3LC,I have somewhat set oppinions on the show as I can trace my family line to Jane Semor and am the actor who plays King Henry VIII's best friend Brandon in 'The Tudors'. As a historian I feel it to be the most accurate dipiction of this time period!! This is in my view to be one of the best period film ever made and the most accurate to the people and events as they accured. I give 'The Tudors' it 5 stars all the way!,1238544000,13,419,3.883720930232558

3462545,5,B001AQR3LC,"Entertaining & based on history. Even though one is taught the reign of King Henry VIII, the story of this era is interesting and addictive. Also, it reveals the breakdown of the Catholic Church revealing where Lutheran/Protestant faiths were born. Lastly, I do not recommend watching the series with children or tennagers as most episodes have nudity. Mistresses of the king and his court was common place during this era. In summation, I recommend watching the Tudors.",1483401600,,470,5.116883116883117

3462645,4,B001AQR3LC,"Season 3 seems weaker than the others because it focuses on Catherine Howard who is portrayed as a very silly young girl, no fault of the actress that the role obliges her to be a total air head.  This season includes the bloody Pilgramage of Grace and the torture of Anne Askew on the rack, scenes I absolutely could not watch or listen to.  The high point for me was Henry taking Catherine to view the newly completed Nonsuch Palace, the most magnificent palace ever constructed in England.  The scenes of fifteenth-sixteenth century music and dancing at King Henry's court are beautifully done, and seem true to the period.  Aside from clothing details that are not true to the time such as attached sleeves, this series is fascinating for anyone, not just history buffs.  Keep in mind that beneath the grand, glittering facade, danger lurks and that Henry is a brutal, paranoid tyrant who executes his most trusted advisors as well as two queens.  Like his father Henry VII, the eighth Henry does not sit easily on the throne, and between the two of them, they executed nine Plantagenet heirs.  Although The Tudors may seem like fiction, in's not.  You can't make this stuff up.",1464048000,,1182,4.7317073170731705

Brings perspective to the real truth to the Monarchies. Their world of nobility, elegance, wealth, glamour. The reality is there is not a Snow White prince, no Cinderella and Rapunzel with the nice long hair would have been beheaded. These were ruthless people. Either have noble blood or you a maggot servant. Step out of line your dead...Mankind at its worst.

Admittedly, there were historical inaccuracies in places, but overall it is very well done.  There is a real reason that so much has been written or put on film about the reign of the Tudors, they were quite simply great drama kings and queens. The world will never tire of them and this production is one of the best I've seen.",1438992000,,497,4.488888888888889
3463135,3,B001AQR3LC,"As many others have said, Season 3 doesn't measure up to the excitement of Season 2.  I had decided just to quit since it seemed that with the death of Anne Bolyn, Thomas More and Wolsey there was not much reason to continue.  Lady Jane was lovely to look at but seemed totally lacking in the passion and fire of Anne.  However I was eventually drawn back to it, as I really did want to find out what would happen next.  I suppose I could have just read a book but this was more entertaining.

From a historical perspective the Counter-Reformation moves in the North were interesting, although it was dreadful seeing so much carnage.  It was hard, too, to see Charles Brandon's complicity in the acts, although at least he had some qualms, and his wife was definitely on the side of sanity.  Lady Jane, too, although lackluster, was something of a relief in that she had a conscience and actually worked to bring about reconciliation with Henry's two children.  One wonders what would have happened if she had lived; if she would have changed the course of history by continuing to humanize Henry or if Henry would have tired of her and sent her to the Tower, too.  Maybe she was lucky to get out of there the way she did.

The political actions are balanced by the amorous ones, but as another reviewer mentioned, it becomes weary to see Henry in bed with yet another new body, just as it becomes horrible to see repeated torture and killing, even if the subjects deserve it.  In most cases it's the good men of conscience who get the axe but even when deserved  torture is never fun to watch, at least for me.

The interval with Ann of Cleves is interesting and it's nice to see another decent looking woman on screen.  They don't last long in Henry's world and soon we see an airhead extraordinaire, a 17 year old filly, frolicking around court.  At this point Henry seems not just to be a brutal, selfish tyrant but not very smart either.

One good thing about the Season is that it was mercifully short and I feel I can survive one more without doing too much damage to my psyche.

As I've already said in earlier reviews and other reviewers have commented, the casting of Jonathan Rhys Meyers is a big mistake.  He has neither the stature nor the presence (nor the voice) to deliver a true picture of Henry. He is a very good actor, and he conveys the arrogance and general mean spiritedness well.  It seems to me that the real Henry must have had more innate charm and sexiness as well as sense of genuine fun than JRM conveys.  That would have made the incredible loyalty that so many of his friends and wives showed somewhat credible.  True they were all fighting for their survival but it seems that some of them genuinely loved Henry.
What a much better series this would have been with a more likable Henry.

The guy who plays Sir Francis is a scene stealer and perks up some dreary moments although he, too, is so devoid of innate decency that I soon tired of him and wished him a speedy trip to the Tower.  Who coined the phrase, ""the banality of evil?!""

One good thing is that the season was short and I can quickly move on to #4 and the end of Henry!",1438992000,,3167,4.392795883361921

3463152,2,B001AQR3LC,"Acting was excellent and sets and costumes were superbly authentic.  Unfortunately there was an opportunity to present great history and this fails on most accounts.  The focus of the series was on sex, innuendo and the lesser important aspects of Henry VIII's reign aside from his six marriages.  Of a 60 minute episode, there was maybe 12 minutes spent on history as detours from the incessant theme of the sexual intrigues.  Aside from Henry's obvious penchant for beheading people, he also did some great things that stood for hundreds of years...which is part of the fascination and paradox of his story. Also, compelling valuable stories to understand context for situations were completely abandoned...such as Anne's trial where her father sat on the jury and condemned both her and her brother to death.  A later scene with a hostile interaction with her father and one of the King's close advisors makes no sense absent of the background context.  Henry's weight is completely left out of the story, a short skinny Henry is projected throughout abandoning the potential life-long implication of earlier jousting injuries on his psyche, health and his generally bizarre later life behavior.  One of the more truly colorful and impactful times of history is treated by Hollywood as a Victorian Peyton Place.  Four years and forty episodes of what could have been a masterpiece.  Shame on Hollywood!",1437436800,,1405,5.12719298245614

3463166,4,B001AQR3LC,"Since the series is historical, of course it's predictable. But that doesn't take away from quality of the production, the acting, the cinematography and the drama, What does diminish this series, in my opinion is Michael Hurst's penchant for graphic violence, blood and gore. It takes up a disproportionate amount of screen time in every series he's created. This one is no exception.",1437177600,,385,5.126984126984127

3463185,5,B001AQR3LC,King Henry's longing for son come to an end but with death of Jane Seymour as his most loved wife. King suppresses rebellion against him making Brandon kill thousands of people of North of which Brandon sees nightmares all his life with guilt because in the course many innocent people might also have got killed. Henry gets mad with the death of his wife Jane Seymour becomes seclude only to enjoy the insane behavior. To avoid war Henry has to marry Anne of Cleves whom he can not make love with and later to find her a good friend. As a combined effect of wounded leg for life and troubled life Henry goes mad and speaks ill words in the court sometimes. To the surprise Henry reconciles with Mary and Elizabeth but can not get daughter Mary married because of political reasons and Mary's preference to Catholic Groom. In the effort of making amendments to the laws of court Henry repeatedly makes mistake of playing god and shows no mercy but in light of the law enforcement it seems necessary to do that which is actually confusing to the audience. May be this is because death and torcher is visible on screen. But at the end of the season Henry becomes successful in bringing peace at court. Definitely 5 star and best performances by all actors and actresses!,1436832000,,1268,4.565789473684211

3463513,4,B001AQR3LC,"This is one of my favorite shows right now. The first two seasons were the best, with this one following them very closely. I have found that King Henry has gotten more and more angry with time. He has a darkness surrounding him, a coldness that has developed as a result of everything he's been through, especially all that happened with Anne Boleyn. The first two seasons showed him as happier and more carefree and understanding, but with time he has become so angry and cold. He has an almost blackness surrounding him and it's shows on his face, especially in his eyes. He has become so hardened to the world around him. He is now so quick to anger and doesn't think twice about violence against people, especially the ruthless killing which has gotten worse with every episode, being magnified in it's brutality and horror by Thomas Cromwell, an almost devilish person, who only cares about himself and his needs and wants.

3463599,5,B001AQR3LC,"Henry takes a break from chopping heads to mourn the death of his wife, Jane Seymour. Granted, the shift in gears isn't completely believable -- in the episodes that precede it, Henry acts pretty cool towards Jane (in those moments when he leaves his mistresses long enough to eat lunch with her) and by episode 6, he's looking for a new wife and has returned to his old habit of killing anyone who disagrees with him. But ignoring all that and taking episode 5 on its own: it is by far the most moving of the season, thanks to the chiaroscuro scenes between the grief-mad Henry and his fool, Will Somers (played by the brilliant David Bradley). At first I thought Henry was simply imagining Somers, because Somers' lines are so biting and so on point. But no, for once someone tells Henry what he truly is, and even though Henry furiously scribbles out charcoal castles and doesn't want to hear it, it's clear that his past decisions weigh more heavily on him than he will admit. It's a dark, quiet moment, in which this glittering series pauses to assess the damage it's done.",1422057600,,1078,4.561855670103093

3463681,5,B001AQR3LC,"After the amazing emotional drama of season 2, one can be forgiven for expecting a tepid season 3.  Jane Seymour and Anne of Cleves weren't the most fascinating of personalities, nor was Thomas Cromwell a much loved or revered figure.  Yet, I found this season compelling, if in a quieter way than its predecessor.  Henrys deceptive and vindictive reaction to the Pilgrimage of Grace evokes sympathy for the sincere Robert Aske, who trusted his prince to honor his agreements, while casting Henry firmly in the role of tyrant, even if the pain of his leg might have been a contributing factor to his irritability.  The persecution of the northerners and later the Pole family further condemn Henry.  But after all the cruelty, viewers are treated to the incredibly moving scenes at the close of episode 4, when Jane Seymour lies dying.  The look on Henrys face, the tears in his eyes, and his pleading prayer for her survival tug at the heart, while the transition to her lying in state and the solemn singing of the choir as the credits roll bring the episode to a graceful and somber close.

But that wasn't all.

We see the further debacle of Henrys marriage to Anne of Cleves.  Whether we feel sorry for Henry or not, we can certainly sympathize with Anne, a young woman thrust into a sophisticated foreign court, trying her best to please her new husband and baffled at his neglect.  Joss Stone does a lovely job of conveying Annes confusion, abashment, and fear that she will share Anne Boleyns fate.

And throughout the season, we see Cromwells slow fall from grace, from the first cracks during the rebellion to the fallout from the Cleves union, cunningly nurtured and furthered by his enemies, led by the Duke of Suffolk.

Charles Brandons character ranges this season from the conscience-stricken general enforcing the kings vengeance on the north to the calculating courtier forging alliances bent on Cromwells destruction.  Its an unsavory side of him that emerges, but perhaps understandable in that Cromwells policies provoked the rebellion in the north and now Brandon sees a way to avenge those deaths and atone for his own involvement.

Cromwells increasing unease and concern come through beautifully in Frains facial expressions, especially his eyes.  However we may feel about the man, his final speech upon the scaffold and grisly execution are difficult to watch.

As much as I enjoyed the season, there were still a few quibbles I had with it.  My biggest complaint concerns the physical portrayals of Henry and Charles Brandon.  If only aging really were only a matter of longer hair and wearing different clothes!  Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Henry Cavill both look far too young to believably portray men in their mid-40s and mid-50s, respectively.  The failure to depict Henry as corpulent is inexcusable; if Rhys Meyers preferred not to gain the weight, his costumes at least could have been padded.  And why isn't his hair red?

Also, the inclusion of Reginald Pole and Sir Francis Bryan as recurring characters this season seemed unnecessary to me:  Pole did write an attack on Henry, which prompted the reprisal against his own family, but otherwise didn't really deserve so much screen time.  He could have been referred to and the story would have gone on.  Bryans sudden inclusion was also a mystery.  Yes, he was part of Henrys court for many years, but why make him a prominent character now, and with not much significant to do?  The story really didn't need these two men.

Even though the series takes liberties with history, it still is a sumptuous visual feast and compelling depiction of Henrys reign.  Season 3 carries the story forward admirably.",1417737600,,3688,4.903225806451613

3463768,3,B001AQR3LC,"This is still a high quality series with outstanding production and careful attention to historically accurate details.  However, I felt the acting was not up to par with the first two seasons. Jonathan Rhys Meyers either chewed the scenery or looked like he'd rather be anywhere but on the set.  He has no chemistry with the actress playing Jane Seymour, yet this was supposed to be the great love of Henry's life.  The character of Lady Jane was very dull after the fascinating Anne Boleyn, portrayed so vibrantly by Natalie Dormer.  Worth watching, but this season I found myself more drawn to the Duke of Suffolk played by Henry Cavill as the true star of the show. Some of his performances are heartbreaking.",1412899200,,713,4.772357723577236

3463840,5,B001AQR3LC,"This is the season where Henry Cavill as Charles Brandon particularly shines. He's got a complex, complicated role where he carries out the orders of his King against the dictates of his own religious scruples, and those of his wife, and portrays this quite well. (Also, he looks hot when he's a little bit scruffy.)  I also felt that Jonathan Rhys Meyers really grew into the role of Henry VIII this season, making the ever-changeable Henry in turns tender and terrible.  We see a bit of Cromwell (yummy James Frain) as a father and Reformer, who goes out on a limb to match Henry with a Protestant Queen (history says she may actually have been Catholic, but whatever).

The sexytimes are dialed back a bit, but filling in the gap is Alan Van Sprang as Sir Francis Bryan, and Charlotte Salt as Lady Ursula Misseldon, in turns his mistress and that of the King. A certain spark is missing with the absence of Natalie Dormer as Anne Boleyn, but Sarah Bolger as Mary Tudor is regal, lovely, and lonely.  Annabelle Wallis as Jane Seymour and Joss Stone as Anne of Cleves are much lovelier than history has portrayed them ( we won't go into all the many historical inaccuracies); all in all, a very enjoyable season to watch, though with only eight episodes, it's shorter than the previous two.",1408233600,,1291,4.6244541484716155

3463922,4,B001AQR3LC,This is a very good series but it took me a while to get into it. There is a lot of adult content but once you see past that it's great. My daughter and daughter-in-law told me they thought I would like it because I love the series Reign. My daughter researched it and it is pretty historically accurate.,1403308800,,304,4.169491525423729

3463924,3,B001AQR3LC,Emphasis too much on the bedroom and executions & gore rather than the history or relationship clarity leading up to major changes.  Could spend more time clarifying characters.,1403049600,,177,5.321428571428571
3463925,5,B001AQR3LC,"Henry the VIII is a fascinating figure.  A man of great learing and even greater passions.

3463926,5,B001AQR3LC,"Having  come all the way from Season i and his ""great matter"" with Anne Boleyn, I've been totally entranced by Henry's story and the break with the Catholic Church/Rome.  As an avid follower of my faith, Roman Catholicism, and holding a degree in Religious Studies from a Catholic College, the schism was nevr really as clear to me as it has become reliving the Tudor Dynasty through this series.  I watch it over and over again - I just love it.  ""Truth is stranger than fiction"" and I don't believe there's a writer alive who could have conceived such an interesting tale of love and intrigue.",1402444800,,595,4.584905660377358
3463927,5,B001AQR3LC,"I thought that The Tudors third season was fantastic. Viewers start to see Henry age which makes his relationships with everyone more interesting.

3463928,5,B001AQR3LC,"They did a good representation of Henry the 8th.  Though Henry the 8 got so big throughout his reign that they had to widen the castle's doors.  The costumes and Jewelry were outstanding. The actor were great and did outstanding performances.  Henry the 8th was a complex character who executed a number of his wives and ministers.  Though many of the ministers deserved their fates for their greed and pushing their own agendas. He forced his wants and desires which were his to force.  In some ways Jonathan Rhys Meyers made Henry the 8th as an almost likeable character.  I almost felt sorry for him.  Henry the 8th was a deadly man who ruled his kingdom with an iron fist and many many deaths to his subjects. Because he wanted, what he wanted, when he wanted it.",1401667200,,767,4.554744525547445

3463931,4,B001AQR3LC,"Although I knew about wives 1-3 from World History classes and what happened to them, but I somehow didn't remember about wives 4 & 5.
The fact that I was unaware of their marriage to Henry VIII didn't surprise me because you can't learn everything and expect to remember most of it and it kept my interest because I didn't know what was coming with these relationships. Love all the costumes and how they change with what country Henry is trying to sway to increase his power and prevent war. Does the No Such Castle still exist?",1401408000,,530,4.474226804123711
3463932,4,B001AQR3LC,"I think most of us in the corporate grind should thank their lucky stars, the climb to the top is perilous and if you fall, at most you may lose your job and your professional reputation may suffer. In the Tudors, if you fall, you may perish... Such were the times...

I like how The Tudors stays (somewhat) true to the timeline of Henry VIII's reign, although I have a few quibbles with the portrayal of Henry (by the time he married Anne of Cleves and starting pursuing Catherine Howard, he was VERY obese) but Jonathan Rhys-Meyers portrays a very charismatic Henry, with the ruthlessness and megalomania typical of an absolute monarch that Henry VIII was. Supporting cast is great, sets and costumes are wonderful. Looking forward to watching Season 4 & bringing The Tudors to a conclusion!",1401321600,,793,4.746376811594203

3463936,4,B001AQR3LC,"Season 3 is a bit slower than seasons 1 and 2 so I found myself losing interest during 3-1 and I took a break from the series for a few weeks. The next few episodes were still a bit slow but it's kind of hard to out-do the season 2 drama of Anne Boleyn. Keep with it though, season 3 ends stronger than it begins.",1400457600,,313,3.830769230769231

3463939,5,B001AQR3LC,"The full series, The Tudors, is a compelling entertainment.  King Henry, of course, is the centerpiece, but, as his character develops, attention is drawn to the other people in his court.  As Henry is impulsive, passionate and strong, the story becomes, as well, the fates of the individuals on whom he relies, who rely on him and whom his policies affect.

It was particularly interesting how these characters were developed in contrast to Henry's strengths and weaknesses, having to respond as their personalities drove them against the fear of Henry's power and his willingness to use it.  At one point or another, each of these characters came to feel Henry's power and to fear the worst, knowing that Henry was completely capable of turning away from them and turning them out.

If you know the history, you know what's coming, but it's great to watch it unfold, creating both empathy and revulsion for all of the characters as their fates unfold.  Like a book you can't put down, this series makes you want to keep going on to the next installment and the one after that.",1400025600,,1078,4.768817204301075
3463940,5,B001AQR3LC,"The Tudors, Season 3, like the prior two seasons, is a masterful piece of historical re-creation. I cannot stop watching episode after episode. This is beautifully produced with great actors portraying the key players in British history almost five hundred years ago. My only crtique would be that Henry V111 was a large. overwweight manwhile the actor portraying him. is lithe, trim, and always youthful. Other than that, I give high praise to the writing, acting, casting, and historical accuracy of the reign of a tyrant whose conflict with the Catholic Church is rendered in the harshest terms for Henry's subjects who had to choose between their fidelity and devotion tto the Church of Rome and their king. Brilliant, and irresistible to lovers of history and brillint acting.",1399852800,,781,5.109375
3463941,5,B001AQR3LC,"I love this story. It shows you that no matter how loved and respected a king is there is always sorrow, betrayal and sadness. Jonathan Rhys Meyer did an awesome job.",1399852800,,166,4.387096774193548

3463953,3,B001AQR3LC,"This season of the Tudors seemed somewhat muddled. The scenes jumped a bit and characters I liked were left at the wayside and not because Henry the VIII killed them. Henry is pretty much a whiney brat here. He is completely unlikable and seems off balanced. This is not a poor reflection on the writers and director as they have captured the nature of this rich, spoiled, king. Things just seemed rushed in this season and the back story that was built around some of the supporting characters seems to have been left in favor of rush through choppy scenes with the king. While he was a central player, there were other things of notable mention going on during history as the result of the craziness in England that were just given a quick nod.",1399593600,,746,4.533333333333333
3463954,3,B001AQR3LC,"Somewhat historically incorrect and obviously made for a male audience 40 years of age or younger.  As the episodes went on one could reliably predict at least one sex scene and one bloody torture in each episode whether or not it supported the story line.  We'll be very skeptical of ""ShowTime"" productions in the future.",1399334400,,322,4.836363636363636

What a story, I cannot believe that people lived with all that hatred, betrayal, immorality, etc. Blows the mind and makes me glad we got out from under the British rule here in America. But the storyline is amazing. I wonder if there are any plans for a ""Bloody Mary"" sequel. I did watch ""Elizabeth the Virgin Queen"" It was fabulous as well.",1397952000,,474,4.588235294117647

3463974,4,B001AQR3LC,Again a stunning cast.... The scenery and costumes amaze me. I've learned more about the History of this family here then when I was in school!

3463983,5,B001AQR3LC,Love this show action packed from the word go. Intrigue is the main focus while at court on issues that concern the crown and country of England which John Rhys Myers plays beautifully as well as the rest of the cast. I thoroughly enjoyed this series so far from the start and hasn't quit on me yet therefore I must say this is a godsend to the Tudors fan nation out there.,1396483200,,373,4.194444444444445

This season is really gory, though, and you may want to fast forward through the beheadings and stake burning. Interesting to see Henry become more despotic. Makes you wonder why anyone would go willingly to court, especially women.

The only reason that I didn't give it five stars is that the characters speak pretty low at times, especially when conversing in confidence with another and the background music or noise from the action in the scene tends to drowned out that dialog.  Turning the volume up doesn't help.  I've considered turning on the closed caption but then you miss seeing the sets and screen's action.",1394668800,,560,4.802083333333333

3464026,5,B001AQR3LC,I like the era of this series. This was a great period in history and the actors who are in this drama do a great job. I would be careful with the younger generation it's a little R rated. Watch it you won't be sorry.,1393200000,,217,3.8444444444444446

3464028,3,B001AQR3LC,"I watched the series when it originally aired on Showtime back in 2007 and I just watches the complete series again.
This time around I had better knowledge of the true story of Henry VIII. The overall quality of Season 3 and the overall series is top notch. The attention to detail of the wardrobes was and scene settings were amazing and even more stunning in HD.
If you love history and the story of Henry VIII you will appreciate the Tudors Season 3. However I believe they could of did a better job in ending Season 3 by adding more detail to the storyline. You had to do a lot of assumptions in watching the last 2 episodes.",1392595200,,630,4.302521008403361

3464030,5,B001AQR3LC,"The sets and costumes are exquisite, the acting is well done, and the history is fairly accurate. The cast puts life into what could be a dry history lesson. There is quite a bit of mature content, but it did not seem gratuitous because those times there were public executions, and a lot of nobles had mistresses. Overall I am enjoying watching these episodes.",1392508800,,361,4.65625
3464031,4,B001AQR3LC,This was a great series even though not all factually correct.  It kept the viewer interested and the actors were great.  So sorry the series ended.  Could be great following the offspringss of Henry 8.,1392422400,,202,4.714285714285714

3464041,4,B001AQR3LC,"The acting, the writing, the photography, the directing are all superb.  And each episode is a cliffhanger!  The only downside, if there must be a downside, is there might be a tad too much nudity--and although the women are beautiful, it's not always artful.",1391731200,,259,4.863636363636363

3464043,5,B001AQR3LC,I read all about King Henry VIII and they pretty much got the story down to a tee. Pretty incredible in my opinion.,1391472000,,115,4.043478260869565
3464044,5,B001AQR3LC,Interesting third season to the second and the first seasons.currently watching the fourth season as time goes on and on.,1391385600,,121,5.1
3464045,5,B001AQR3LC,Can't say it enough as to how much I love this series (even though they added extra to the actually history).  Hate that I'm about to start the last season of the series. Would definitely recommend this series especially if you are a history lover.,1391299200,,248,4.511111111111111

3464052,4,B001AQR3LC,"Again, the production values for this series have been stellar.  I don't know a lot about this period in Henry VIII's life, but I do know that there were major historical gaffes in the previous sections, so I don't feel I can trust the accuracy of this.  Perhaps some fact checking on my part is in order.  It does bother me that Henry doesn't seem to age, that Jane Seymour is gorgeous.  This speaks more to marketing than fact.",1390867200,,429,4.3924050632911396
3464053,5,B001AQR3LC,"Although Johnathan Rhys Meyers would not have been my first choice for King Henry, he won me over during the course of the series. All the actors gave great performances and I would highly recommend The Tutors.",1390867200,,210,4.702702702702703
3464054,5,B001AQR3LC,"I absolutely loved this entire series and have watched most episodes more than once!  I've recommended it to all my Downton Abbey fan/friends.  The series is so perfectly casted and the actors are engaging and very easy on the eye!  What struck me most is the effective portrayal of the huge financial gap between the monarchy and the commoners by use of decadence and lack thereof in the sets, props and most definitely the exquisite costume design.  I see a new detail in the costumes every time I watch. With the exception of initiating me into the world of Downton Abbey via the first 3 seasons, this series has been the best use of my Kindle Fire to date!  I can't think of anything I would change - other than a couple of liberties the writers took with historical facts, but that's TV drama for ya!  Enjoy!",1390867200,,813,4.496598639455782

3464056,5,B001AQR3LC,"It's like Dallas of the 1500's.  Very entertaining.  Not sure why Henry VIII is not a bit heavier, but other than that I would recommend.",1390867200,,137,4.44
3464057,5,B001AQR3LC,"This entire show is very good.  Some of the historical facts have been altered slightly, but for the most part it's very accurate.  However, most of the deaths of the traitors and heretics are difficult to watch.  I watched this series for free with my Amazon Prime membership.",1390867200,,277,4.729166666666667
3464058,5,B001AQR3LC,This was fantastic and I've watched this whole series two times. Loved Henry Cavill as the Duke of Suffolk and Rhys Meyers is awesome as Henry VIII. Whole cast is fabulous.,1390867200,,172,4.580645161290323
3464059,5,B001AQR3LC,Entertaining show. Recommend. Nice that it's included with amazon prime membership. Once you start watching its a little addictive and makes you want to watch the entire series.,1390867200,,177,5.357142857142857

3464068,5,B001AQR3LC,"That was a crazy series with the last season being the best in my opinion.  Great acting, and that man was crazy.  I never saw it on Showtime and it was great to watch one show after the other as if I was watching a movie.",1390003200,,222,3.8043478260869565
3464069,5,B001AQR3LC,I enjoyed watching the show very much and the way they provided history to see it come alive to watch,1390003200,,101,4.1

3464074,4,B001AQR3LC,Good series. A little too violent for me.  I enjoyed the fact that the episodes were not too long and they reviewed what happened in the previous episode.,1389830400,,154,4.5
3464075,4,B001AQR3LC,Fictionalized I am sure but learned a bit about the marriages of Henry the Eight. Good personal viewing but not for families.,1389830400,,125,4.7272727272727275

3464079,4,B001AQR3LC,"I chose 4 stars because I enjoy the Tudors, but season 3 isn't as exciting to me as season 1 was.  I loved season 1 because it was new and the story lines were fresh.  After watching all of season 1 & 2, season 3 isn't as fresh, though I still really enjoy them.  It seems a bit repetitive to kill people and outfit them politically (ie: who has the ear of the king today), but I guess that was just how English politicking was back then.  The cast is very good and scenes are well-acted.  The costumes and sets are great to look at.  The story lines are fun to watch.  I miss Ann Boleyn's antics - too bad she got beheaded at the end of season 2!",1389657600,,647,3.9689922480620154

3464084,5,B001AQR3LC,"I have enjoyed the intensity of this show so far.  The costumes are simply fantastic.  Some of the scenes are a little disturbing and tend to stick with me, but this time in history was not all pleasant.  Overall the show is a ten for acting, costumes, writing, everything.",1389398400,,273,4.530612244897959
3464085,5,B001AQR3LC,"...well done in telling the story of King Henry Vlll..even though a bit romanticized..but we all need that at times. For those who don't like to read history, this is a great substitute and highly entertaining with good actors, scenes, sets and more...",1389398400,,252,4.883720930232558
3464086,5,B001AQR3LC,This season as with the others documents King Henry VIII and his exploits while king. These shows grab your attention and really give you a taste of what it would be like during this point in time! Very fun to watch and at the end of each episode it leaves you wanting more!!,1389312000,,275,4.2075471698113205
3464087,4,B001AQR3LC,Interesting series on the British monarchy. The performances are all very good. Amazing how the wives of Henry the 8th come and go so quickly,1389312000,,141,4.68

3464090,5,B001AQR3LC,Loved the entire The Tudors series and it didn't hurt that Johnathan Meyers as Henry VIII is HOT!!! Highly recommend checking this show out.,1389225600,,140,4.875
3464091,4,B001AQR3LC,"I love the sets, actors, and attempt at accuracy. The series seems to try hard to stay accurate though some things are understandably changed to enhance the emotion of events. The costumes and sets are amazing also. And King Henry is deliciously handsome. :)",1389139200,,258,4.886363636363637

3464093,4,B001AQR3LC,I thoroughly enjoyed all of these seasons but the only thing that was a bit difficult was the gruesome burnings and be headings etc but they were certainly very realistic and sure makes me grateful that I live in a so called democracy without a half crazy king running the show.,1389052800,,278,4.470588235294118
3464094,5,B001AQR3LC,"Riveting, brutal, and sexy portrayal of the King Henry VIII's reign.  Watched the complete 4 seasons uninterrupted via amazon prime video  on demand.",1388966400,,149,5.434782608695652
3464095,5,B001AQR3LC,"The Tudors Season 3 shows King Henry the VIII in full glory and with temper tantrums.  Being the founder of the Church of England, he doesn't appear to be the best example of spirituality.

The beautiful setting, the castles, the common folk, the energy of the characters throughout, and the costumes, make The Tudors a delightful way to learn history.

3464096,5,B001AQR3LC,Non stop action.  If you like Game of Thrones you will like Tudors most likely.  I see some of the actors and actresses are now in the Dracula production on NBC.,1388707200,,161,4.161290322580645
3464097,5,B001AQR3LC,By far the best season of The Tudors. This is an amazing show and the actors couldn't be any better. Jonathan Rhys Meyers is incredible. Perfect for the character of Henry VIII. Joss Stone as Anne of Cleve's is also great. I reccomend it for anyone who is interested in this time period.,1388620800,,287,4.433962264150943
3464098,5,B001AQR3LC,"Then again I haven't subscribed to this premium channel to know.  Great if your interested in that specific time in history.  Great storyline, and a nice looking king.  No complaints. On my nights when I can't sleep, I indulge in this gem of a show.  Sometimes too indulgent.",1388534400,,275,4.666666666666667

3464100,4,B001AQR3LC,"For season 3, you can tell that Harry is a ticking time bomb but no one knows when he'll explode nor on whom. No person is safe at this point. I really miss seeing Anne Boelyn. She was so pretty, such a good actress, and now I realize how much of the show relied upon her. It's quite a risk to continue a show after killing off many of the main characters. I miss them. Season 3 is like starting over and Harry (that crazy hunk) is the only thread that connects it to the previous seasons.",1388448000,,489,4.051546391752577

Only sad part it that they did not make more of them. Hope maybe they might add on the childrens reins at some point.,1388361600,,278,3.7288135593220337

3464119,4,B001AQR3LC,"My husband and I watched all 4 seasons of this show in a few home marathons. We enjoyed the entire series, but keep in mind this is a TV drama and not historically accurate in many instances. In fact, there is a whole website out there devoted to all the inaccuracies if you're interested. If you're looking for history, find a good biography. If you're looking for entertainment and a general timeline for things that happened, this is pretty good. There are some torture and execution scenes in this entire series that are very difficult to watch, but we used our Roku to blip through the awful parts and didn't ruin any continuity in the story line. It doesn't bother some people, I'm sure, but it was more yucky than I wanted to watch through dinner and disturbing emotionally. The scenery was pretty and the costumes were pretty (and much cleaner than any originals, I'm sure). We enjoyed it enough to watch all 4 seasons. I took off a star for brutal torture scenes.",1385683200,,972,4.591954022988506
3464120,5,B001AQR3LC,Fantastic series with amazing costumes and acting. This is my 3rd time watching it and probably will watch it again sometime.,1385683200,,125,5.0

3464122,4,B001AQR3LC,"Love the Tudors.  First season is still the best.
The only issue is by the time Henry married Anne of Cleves he was overweight. In the Tudors, Henry stays the same size.",1385596800,,169,4.28125
3464123,4,B001AQR3LC,"Not true to history - I kept having to double check my facts becasue somethings did not make sense as I knew it and sure enough I was right.  Some facts were changed and I'm not even sure why the real facts did not fit with the story line.  King Henry VIII does not even really age much - nor do the other main characters.

Over all it is a good series though - too much real s-x and torture for my tastes even if that part is real ;)  The s-x part was hard to deal with when you have family around.  It will go several episodes without and then very graphic for almost entire episodes, difficult to skip because of the vital pillow talk.",1385164800,,638,4.031746031746032

3464126,3,B001AQR3LC,"This season is very violent. The new characters were not introduced and expanded upon. They were just thrown out there for you to figure out. I was disappointed that Jonathan Rys-Meyers refused to wear a suit to expand his slim frame. HVIII was morbidly obese and couldn't even mount a horse without a special crane. So you see a slender faced HVIII with the wide shouldered garments of the time. That said, the acting by the main characters is superb. Henry's temper is quick and fierce. Brandon 's weariness and love for the king makes you sympathize with the character. As long as you are not a stickler on history and don't mind scenes of torture (I can't look at a fireplace poker), you may enjoy this season.",1385078400,,714,4.5859375
3464127,5,B001AQR3LC,"Wonderful historical drama. Acting is great, scenery wonderful, costumes spot on. I have always thought Henry the VII to be a most interesting  monarch. His determination to have what he wanted changed the face of the world.",1384819200,,224,5.054054054054054
3464128,5,B001AQR3LC,"If you are a history geek, and love drama - this is the series to watch!  Rich, lush, bloody, sexy, religious conflict - Henry the 8th was the man who you will love to hate...",1384732800,,175,4.0

3464130,3,B001AQR3LC,Season 3 was okay. I love the show but it really went downhill (not the quality) it just wasn't as fun to watch after Anne Boelyn was killed,1384214400,3,140,4.035714285714286
3464131,5,B001AQR3LC,Great educational peace and entertaining but a bit violent at times! My wife and I really enjoyed the whole series.,1383696000,,115,4.8
3464132,5,B001AQR3LC,Well done. Of course artistic license was taken a bit but it was a dramatic series and not a documentary.,1383436800,,105,4.3

3464134,3,B001AQR3LC,Interesting way to learn (or be reminded of) some important European history. -Though much of the drama (and script of course) is inflated for TV effect.,1383091200,,153,4.923076923076923
3464135,4,B001AQR3LC,"In season three Henry was back! He was the head of his country and church.  I was waiting for this part of the story, which to me was too long in coming. While Anne was a great character, her time slowly brought the show to a standstill.
Cromwell had to go!  The Church of England was a catholic type of church minus the Pope. Cromwell tried to make it a true Protestant church. With his demise, Henry built his church, his way.
Season three returned Henry to his status as one of the most interesting, though for the wrong reasons, characters of English history.",1383091200,,563,4.403846153846154
3464136,5,B001AQR3LC,"What can I say? The first 2 seasons were spectacular and season 3 is no exception! It has everything you could want from a series TV show.

3464142,5,B001AQR3LC,"I have actually watched the whole series at least 4 times, and could watch over and over, love this series.............The actors are amazing, and good-looking might I add.  There is a lot of sex, so if you don't like that don't watch, but the sex is not really explicit, so not porn.  This is one of my favorite series of all time, once you watch you can't stop!",1381795200,,363,4.323529411764706
3464143,5,B001AQR3LC,"This 3rd season of the hit Showtime series, ""The Tudors"", finds Henry VIII at his most paranoid.  He has divorced Catherine of Aragon, his first wife and executed his second wife Ann Boelyn because she did not provide Henry with a male heir.  His brutal repression of the Pilgrimage of Grace is graphically depicted in Episode Three (not for the squeamish) and the subsequent extermination of the last of the White Rose (including a young boy) leaves one shaking his or her head with disgust.  The accomplishments of the writers would be remarkable under any circumstances, but when one considers that the season was shortened (and almost canceled) by a labor dispute, they become extraordinary.  This season of, ""The Tudors"", provides great insight into the workings of Henry's mind, and is highly recommended.",1381708800,,811,5.075187969924812

3464145,4,B001AQR3LC,"This is a cool, interesting series that, despite having a dramatized and selacious side, is fairly historically accurate. The characters are interesting and the dialogue is fantastic. I particularly loved the episodes featuring Sir Thomas More and Anne Bolyn.",1380931200,,259,5.666666666666667
3464146,1,B001AQR3LC,"This video has a logo on the cover--CC within a conversational balloon--advertising it as closed captioned for the hearing impaired.  It also has gold letters to the same effect on its setup menu.  However, cycling through the various items on the setup menu skips over those gold letters, making it impossible to turn the captioning on.
Fast-forwarding through the video engages the coding in the synch bars from time to time, so that every now and then a caption is displayed.  The original production crew did install those captions at some considerable time and expense, which is now vitiated because the disk manufacturer did not include a simple software switch to turn it on.",1380844800,,682,4.964912280701754

3464149,5,B001AQR3LC,"The Tudors is absolutely the best historical romance I have seen.  From what I have read in my study of English history it is true and accurate most of the time.  It is an accurate portrayal of the English reformation and how those who were pro and those con would stoop to any level necessary to get their own way.  The brutality of that period of history is absolutely mind boggling.  Henry VIII was a tyrant and often shows his brutal non-caring side.  Women back then were possessions to be used and abused then thrown away.  The show shows the abuse the manner in which they were used and then finally thrown away.  That period of English history was violent and at times sadistic.  Thus the show contains beheading, disembowelments, and other atrocities so it is not for those who have a weak stomach.  If you have an interest in seeing a fairly accurate representation of the history of the English reformation and English history in general then this show would have appeal.",1380499200,,982,4.630057803468208

You couldn't be Lutheran or any other type of Protestant.  It was ironic that his Catholic daughter eventually became queen and sat on the throne for 40 years.

Other than that, it wrapped up the entire story fantastically. Younger and middle aged Henry was very convincing. His best friend ''Duke of Suffolk"" aged nicely in his acting, I only wished the actor who played Henry took some acting tips from his fellow ''aged'' actors.

3464187,5,B001AQR3LC,"I was blown away by the unbelievably accurate costumes! As a Brit myself I expect high standards and got it from this series. When I first heard Jonathan Rhys Meyers was to play Henry I thought they had made a casting error but he was superb! As was Henry Cavill throughout the series. If your a history buff then you need to understand it his slightly Hollywood-ised but that's tv right? Also if your a little prudish there is quite a lot of sex involved, especially in the first and second seasons. This didn't bother me (lol) but for some it might. Rhys Meyers evolves brilliantly from young and virile King to the older, grumpy turkey leg eating, off with your head kind of KIng you visualize when thing of Henry Viii. I watched the series twice and would definitely recommend it, it's entertaining, shocking in part, heart wrenching and mind boggling as to what went on back in the Tudor era. They also include Mary Tudor and Elizabeth the first quite a lot in the later seasons, I'm hoping that means they will be continuing on! Doubt it though as it seems Rhys Meyers and Cavill are in blockbuster movie mode now, shame :-/",1376352000,,1130,4.517073170731707

Also, I am amazed at the person who designed the cover photo for this season - a throne made out of naked human bodies, both male and female? Incredible season with Henry Cavill's character the Duke of Suffolk's hair longer so he can tie it up into a short ponytail haha, just a thought.

3464237,4,B001AQR3LC,"England, 1536. Anne Boleyn has been executed and King Henry VIII has married Jane Seymour. Henry is incredibly happy with his new wife, who soon bears him his much-longed-for son. However, Jane is also keen for Henry to reconcile with his daughters Mary and Elizabeth, and Henry is concerned that Jane is meddling in affairs beyond her interest. Such matters become less important when the north of England rises in rebellion against the crown, furious with the dissolution of the monasteries and what they see as the corruption of the king's chief minister, Thomas Cromwell.

The third season of The Tudors covers the period running from 1536 and the immediate aftermath of the execution of Anne Boleyn, to 1540 and the king taking Catherine Howard as a mistress. In terms of wives, it's the busiest of the four seasons as it has to get through three of them whilst also addressing the popular rebellion known as the Pilgrimage of Grace, the downfall of Thomas Cromwell, the rise to prominence of the Seymour family (who would retain some power even beyond Henry's death) and the religious opposition of Cardinal Reginald Pole, who stirs up opposition to Henry VIII in Europe. Furthermore, it only has eight episodes to do all this in (as opposed to the ten apiece of the other seasons). They even fit in a somewhat bizarre episode in which Henry has a mini-breakdown and works through it with the help of his fool (a great performance by David Bradley).

The third season is therefore quite impressive in that it manages to pack all of these storylines into a very short space of time and explore them quite thoroughly without feeling rushed. It's a fairly dynamic season, complete with more action-adventure subplots as the would-be assassin Sir Francis Bryan chases Reginald Pole across Europe and as the Pilgrimage of Grace marches across England with Charles Brandon leading an army against them.

The performances range from the excellent to the okay. James Frain's Thomas Cromwell is probably the season highlight as he loses control, but Henry Cavill improves yet more as Brandon is ravaged by guilt over the deaths he causes. Jonathan Rhys Meyers, again, is fairly neutral in his performance, but there's a nice turn from singer Joss Stone as Anne of Cleeves. Giving an unproven actress a tricky role with a German accent was quite a challenge, but she handles it reasonably well. The season also benefits from Sarah Bolger coming more to the fore as Mary Tudor, a difficult character to get right. Mary was a woman of principal and authority, but one who became increasingly ruthless when she herself became queen, and Bolger combines those traits quite well. Unfortunately, the loss of Natalie Dormer's Anne Boleyn is more keenly felt, with Annabelle Wallis's Jane Seymour being rather unmemorable in comparison, despite an odd attempt to draw parallels between her and Diana, Princess of Wales.

The season is also let down a little by the arrival of Catherine Howard at the end of the season. Though Tamzin Merchant (probably better known for almost being Daenerys in Game of Thrones, playing the role in the unaired pilot and later being replaced by Emilia Clarke for reasons that have never been divulged) does a good job with the material, the writing never really explains why Henry would fall for such a flighty creature. That has to wait until Season 4, when the suggestion that Henry is having what we'd now term a mid-life crisis is better-explored.

Season 4 of The Tudors (***) maintains the show's run of being watchable, entertaining, historically interesting (though not hugely accurate), slightly trashy but lacking in depth.",1372723200,,3653,4.962418300653595
3464238,5,B001AQR3LC,I wish I could give this series more than 5 stars. It's quite possibly the most entertaining and addicting show I have ever seen.,1372550400,,129,4.416666666666667

3464254,4,B001AQR3LC,"I suggest not buying all of them and trying to watch them in some sort of TV marathon. At first, it is visually stunning and captivating. The acting superb, etc. But the body count in Season 3 really pushed my tolerance level. It's absolutely awful, and becomes unbearable. And any attempts to make Henry empathetic do not work - because he keeps slaughtering people with such earnest convictions. There really is no one to root for - it's endless scenes of watching innocents hunted and slaughtered. It becomes depressing.",1371340800,,523,4.887640449438202

3464265,3,B001AQR3LC,"This season of the Tudors is very different from the others. That's appropriate. Henry and the gang are older. He's starting to get more mentally and physically diseased. He doesn't have the challenges that he did before. This season feels more settled, slower and gives more depth to what is going on with the country as a result of Henry and the plotters in court's influence. From that perspective it was really interesting. I liked that ""ordinary"" people and their concerns was a bigger part of the show. Henry VII made an INCREDIBLE impact on England and the world. In this season, you really start to see that. I love the focus on history.

Rhys-Meyers (Henry VIII) does his finest performance in this series. He has a much larger range of emotion (so more to work with). Cavill (Charles, Duke of Suffolk) does a convincing job of maturing. Fraim (Cromwell) is realistically creepy. The cast overall is fine. The sets continue to be top notch.

I almost didn't watch this. I had gotten bored with the previous seasons. It is a refreshing change of pace. I would have liked to have seen Henry get fatter, older, and increasingly diseased (just for realism), but it's otherwise interesting.",1369440000,,1194,4.79126213592233

I was concerned I might be a stickler for more accuracy in the casting of Jonathan Rhys Meyers as the lead, but I quickly got over the casting of such a young, handsome actor as the king.  He portrayed the petulant and spoiled monarch well enough that the disparity in the age and the lack of corpulence was a pleasure to overlook.  I frequently loan out the entire series to friends and family and it is always a hit.  The torture scenes are unfortunately very well done and I often have to turn away as they are tragic and disturbing. (spoiler:  I am referring to you, poor handsome violinist!).

We visited London shortly after watching the entire season and it made visiting the Tower of London so much more enjoyable and meaningful.  Standing precisely where so much history occurred and where poor Anne Boleyn met her fate was much more intense for me.

As much as I enjoyed J Rhys Meyers in other films I believe him to be wildly miscast as Henry VIII. I found some of the scenes overly explicit.

I think some of the history is a bit muddled in the lives of Henry's sisters Margaret and Mary, which casts doubt on the accuracy of the rest. However it is not a documentary, and it does not claim to be a history lesson. I watched and enjoyed every episode, still enjoy the wonderful soundtrack, and have Catherine of Aragon and her daughter etched firmly in my mind forever with the faces of the excellent actresses who played those roles so well.",1357603200,,754,4.424460431654676

3464459,5,B001AQR3LC,"He was about as good a slave as any demon king could hope for, and it's amazing he lived as long as he did.  Cromwell was given all the blame for that pig King Henry's policies and when people hated a policy they blamed Cromwell - but from this series we mostly only see Cromwell passing the king's wishes along, and going through great pains to do so. Only then to receive the blame for the policy itself. He's actually kind of a sympathetic character.  The real b.s. was always coming from the king but as no one dared criticize him, Cromwell became the scapegoat.  Henry was despicable, Cromwell merely his hand.  His greatest fault was to have started working for that madman in the first place.  While he could be faulted for too much servility, there was a light and a decency to his character all the same (in this Showtime portrayal) that shone through at times such that i couldn't help feeling sorry for Cromwell.

As some have said before the high points of this season don't quite match those of the first and second, but there is no doubt the performances, writing and production of the show continue to mesmerize all the same.",1341792000,2,1140,4.509708737864078

While the merchandise was below cost, I regret not having bought the same product through another vendor.

I was quite suprised after purchasing the materials, how very long they planned to take to complete the order.

There is simply no reason in this day and age that it should take four weeks to ship.

I ordered other blue-ray DVD through another seller on Amazon the same day and received those materials within a week of ordering.

Never, NEVER, use these guys.

As for the Tudors series - Fantastic!

I have viewed Seasons One, Two, and Four (all ordered the same date as the above through different vendors (Deep Discount DVDs was not one of them).

There is no ""hero"" in these episodes, as the character flaws and human vices are portayed and personified.

The bonus features which address the historical side, are very informative as well.

At times a bit graphic, but not overly gorey or prurient, a well done series that is very informative and closely follows the historical accounting of the era.

I enjoy the series very much.  I don't expect complete historical accuracy unless it's a documentary.  PBS and other networks can better be expected to be historically accurate than Showtime.  That having been said, most people will enjoy the story, characters, and plots in this series.  If you like renaissance festivals, you will likely enjoy this as well.  If you like a series of programs rather than a movie - this is for you.  I'm glad I have the seasons on dvd.

3464464,4,B001AQR3LC,"I love the whole Tudor series however without a doubt this season was indeed the weakest of the 4, however with no fault to the writers or actors, it's just the way history goes.  Part of the reason is the departure of Natalie Dormer as Anne Boleyn.  Although we have Jane Seymour, Anne of Cleves and Katherine Howard, none of them have the presence/longevity Anne Boleyn did.  As a result there is no consistent female presence on the show as there was in the first 2 seasons.  The second reason is things don't really begin happening until mid-way through the season with the crushing of the Pilgrimage of Grace and the beginning of Thomas Cromwell's downfall.  The first part deals with Henry's marriage to Jane and the birth of Edward.  Despite all this, the series is still one for all Tudor-fans and the acting, writing is top-notch.",1330732800,,839,4.673469387755102

3464469,5,B001AQR3LC,"The Anne Boleyn story in the Showtime series The Tudors was good but always seemed a bit stiff and uncomfortable to me.  It was as if the makers of the series were too self conscious about the show and how it would be received.  By the third season and the death of Anne, the show really gets going.  There are no expectations on how the subject is to be covered and in past shows and movies, the story of Henry VIII becomes dull as if nothing happened to him after Anne's death.  Somehow this series hits the bar in making the Jane Seymour story much more moving than I have seen before, is able to cover the time when he was in mourning and make the brief marriage to Anne of Cleaves very interesting.  This is the season where I went from liking the show to loving it.  Jonathan Rhys Meyers does an excellent job as Henry VIII and the women who portray his wives are wonderful.  Another gift to the story of Henry is that the series covers not just his wives but the political conflicts he dealt with beyond the court.  Most of this history is ignored in favor of the wives story.  I appreciate the history and the show.",1322006400,,1123,4.259433962264151

3464474,2,B001AQR3LC,"I can write a five page review, however I won't because I do have a life. This is an interesting take [inside view] in the life of the infamous Henry VIII. We get to see Henry have many tantrums because he does not get his way. From a historical perspective, of course, it is from a British point of view- thus I do not know how accurate it.  None the less, it is an entertaining series.  Although it could have been done in one season, rather it drags too many seasons. I give it one thump up!
ps  the first season is the best",1302220800,,527,4.048076923076923
3464475,4,B001AQR3LC,"Season three does a good job at holding up the Tudor promise, but even so is less spectacular than the prior two seasons. Once again it ends with a dramatic beheading of a key figure (as frequently happened in the real Tudor times), and we have a continuation of the queen-for-a-day motif for which Henry VIII was so well known.

Jane Seymour, played well but not excitingly by Anita Briem, is a continuation of the character by a new actress from season two. However, in terms of the plot (and the actual history), she doesn't last as long nor does she have the same spark as the now-absent Anne Boleyn. The intrigues of the Seymours are not as gripping as those of the Boleyns, and the main political figure, Cromwell (played by James Frain) doesn't cut the same figure as either Wolsey (Sam Neil) or Thomas More (Jeremy Northam). There feels like there's too much arcane politicking in his downfall for it to be truly exciting. The introduction of the figure of Pole (premature and out of place politically) seems almost pointless, alas.

Jonathan Rhys Meyers continues to do a great job as Henry, and Henry Cavill as Brandon turns in a servicable performance, but one feels that the writing is letting the Brandon side down. At one point Brandon remarks to Henry that they have both lost their youth, and there is that sense about the series as whole to me. It is still good, but it is no longer remarkable and new.

The brief marriage (historically speaking) to Anne of Cleaves was dealt with very quickly in the story lines as well. We barely get to see Anne (played by Joss Stone) before she is pensioned off, an unconsummated match (and one can't really understand why the lusty Henry wouldn't find Joss Stone alluring).

This is an abbreviated season, with only 8 episodes, but (and perhaps this is not a good sign) it felt as long as the prior seasons, which each had 10 episodes. I give five stars to each of the earlier seasons, but this one feels at best a four-star experience for me. But, there are two more wives to look forward to in the upcoming season, and who knows what will become of The Tudors after that.",1300320000,9,2128,4.5483028720626635

3464488,1,B001AQR3LC,"If you're deaf or hard-of-hearing and rely on closed captioning to read who is saying to who, don't buy or rent the 3rd season of The Tudors.

The closed captioning was non-existent in the first episode and the second episode, so I skipped to the third episode, but captioning was awful. By the fourth, it was bad. Words jumbled up, misspelled, or missing. Half of the times when the characters were talking, the captioning skipped out some wording, making me not sure to understand what was that about between characters talking.

The closed captioning was pretty bad in Season 2, but it is atrocious in Season 3. Season 1 has subtitles but Showtime decided to skip out better-quality subtitles for inferior closed captioning quality coded in the DVDs in Season 2 and Season 3. I will not be watching the Season 4 of the Tudors because of this.

In fact, I decided to remove any prospect of purchasing the Tudors series in the future. Showtime/Paramount will not be getting my money. Screw you, Showtime.

I highly recommend the first 3 seasons of this series (I haven't watched the 4th season yet) to anyone who enjoys the history of this era, as well as to anyone who doesn't because they think people weren't as interesting back then.

Although, it's not the perfect account of Henry VIII's reign, I enjoyed the sex appeal and drama added. Of course, it would be totally boring if it wasn't ""made for tv"". So, if you're watching the series for the sake of history, then you will be a little disappointed. If you like good drama television, this is the one for you. I have seasons 1-3 and will get the forth (final) season when available. Initially, I couldn't remember who Jonathan Rhys-Meyers was, but after a few episodes I was drawn in to him. (He is the sexiest king ever!) The acting was pretty good too :-) I googled him and watched some of his movies from recent past (Match Point, August Rush, Gormenghast, Children of Haung Shi, Elvis the series, Bend it like Beckham, and others). The ones mentioned were great movies. He was fantastic and committed to his role in each. He's not perfect but definitely one of my favorite actors, now.

3464516,3,B001AQR3LC,"I had planned to see the entire visually stunning THE TUDORS series before remarking on them, but after viewing Season 3, I had to speak out.

In the first 2 programs the youthful exuberance of a very sexy Jonathan Rhys Meyers is set to a visual symphony of the highest production values. Acting, set, costumes, script (more often than not), all of the highest quality. Ok, watching some Brit monarch running around yelling ""I am the King of England"" or ""I Am the Queen of England"" gets a bit fraying on the nerves, but one can a least tolerate it when it's part of a dramatic whole.

One thing I liked about Seasons 1 & 2 is the slant it gives to the main female characters. Princess Mary, usually depicted by British history as inherently sinister, is given a less propagandized role in this movie. She is more balanced, even attractive. Another case of this approach is seen in the character of Queen Jane. History usually paints her as a kind-hearted simpleton. Again, not in this flix. Not only is the actress who plays Jane ravishingly blonde & beautiful, her acts of charity in trying to reconcile Henry to his 2 daughters are based as much on a thoughtful, diplomatic overview then a simple, kindly nature. Little Princess Elizabeth is adorable

All good stuff, right? So what went wrong?

The elements of physical torture & sexual manipulation that were more or less intrinsic to the storyline, become increasing cruel & even grotesque in Season 3. This could be overlooked but for one simple fact: Like movie stars in old Hollywood, romantic, historic characters (especially women) were not allowed to appear to age from teen to middle age. This is how Jonathan Rhys Meyers is presented. Oh, he's a little rough around the edges in Season 3, but he doesn't essential age, not his face, not his character. In short, he is completely out of his depth.

There is a totally ridiculous scene thrown in where the bitter, aging Henry is approaching madness (in part probably physically caused by disease) and has a sort of artsy-fartsy dialogue with his ""Fool."" Where the hell did this ""Fool"" come from? Not from any preceeding scene in the series. The actor who plays the Fool is a veteran of British drama, but for all his technique he cannot do anything but appear completely out of context. It is an embarrassing & unnecessary interlude

Well, enough said--but my last remark is this: Look at the cover art of each program. From 1-2 to 3 is a descent from class to sleaze. What began as a potential masterpiece degrades to the level of Caligula...well, it's not THAT bad.

I was confused by some of the new character who were acting as if they were always on the show.  Also there were just some plain boring episodes.",1278288000,2,344,4.276923076923077
3464518,5,B001AQR3LC,"Outside of the very little I learned in school, I didn't have a lot of knowledge about the Tudors and Henry VIII's reign, however this was such a compelling series that I've since bought the books to study more on this period. I think this was the whole point of creating the series - to bring it to a new audience and to entertain us at the same time, which they've done a remarkable job. I'm not going to knock the show for historical inaccuracies nor even for JRM's appearance. I would rather use a stretch of my imagination than see unrealistic make-up or Jonathan Rhys Meyers have to pack on the pounds. I think wardrobe has done well adding bulk to his frame and it's only when he's shirtless that we see those beautiful abs.

I also don't understand those who put down Season 3, don't blame it on the show. Blame it on the history! Anne Boleyn (remarkably portrayed by Natalie Dormer) was a force of nature that brought vitality and passion to Henry VIII...of course their courtship and marriage, and all of its reprecussions, are going to be more compelling! Their relationship got two whole seasons, while the writers and producers are having to cram four years from her execution to Cromwell's execution into only 8 episodes this season. His ""beloved,"" which he also called Catherine of Aragon and Anne Boleyn this as well, Jane Seymour did deliver him a son at her own peril, I failed to see the chemistry and love between the two actors...was it just her gift of baby Edward that she got this coveted role as his truest love? And like others have pointed out, Joss Stone is such a lovely young woman and did wonderfully portraying Anne of Cleves, who I'm glad she was able to walk away from Henry. Such compelling history, I'm glad Showtime has taken on this endeavor and looking forward to the final set of DVDs.",1278201600,,1825,4.547112462006079

However, with ""The Tudors"", as with the series ""Rome"", what is added only makes for a fantastic viewing experience leaving the viewer wanting more.

3464524,5,B001AQR3LC,"As I mentioned in my review of The Tudors Second Season, I am an American who knew virtually nothing about the reign of King Henry VIII before I watched this series.  I think it is safe to say that from an American perspective, we Americans can thank our Founding Fathers for making a clean break from the institution of monarchy and founding, instead, a form of government the prime directive of which is the will and welfare of the people.  Lest I be accused of jingoism, Britain too, found its way, a slightly different way, towards this goal by later establishing the supremacy of Parliament as sovereign, at the expense of the monarchy.  In the twentieth century, when the mutual affections of our two peoples was reestablished, it is safe to say that this was facilitated by both countries having rejected monarchism, albeit in different ways.  The value of ""The Tudors"" is that it really does show the viewer why monarchy as a system of government was ultimately shown to be unsatisfactory.  King Henry is shown in this series, as he has been judged in real life, to have been a self-indulgent and selfish ruler who was indifferent to the welfare of his subjects.

King Henry VIII is shown in Season Three in his full maturation as an arbitrary and unreasonable tyrant.  He quashes his subjects' rebellion with a complete disregard for justice or compromise, and the strange conventions of European monarchy make it difficulty for the King to establish a dynasty, threatening governmental instability and lack of continuity.  King Henry himself is impossible to please or serve.  A great line from the series which is quite true is that ""King Henry never makes a man without then unmaking him.""  All of the King's intimates seem to come to an arbitrary bad ending.

I have to say that the King's German wife seemed fine to me!  Perhaps the makers of this superb series simply could not find it within themselves to cast a homely actress for the part!  A minor nit, I freely admit.

This series is great fun and I have enjoyed every second of it!  This is addicting and grand entertainment.  Highly recommended.  RJB.",1274572800,,2123,4.756830601092896

While Henry was supposed to slim and athletic in his younger years, after a jousting accident, he becomes less athletic and starts to become the very heavy Henry that most people think of him as.(He was also quite tall, and Rhys Meyers is somewhat slight).  So...when are they going to make this Henry start to gain weight and stop having a six pack?  Also, when is he going to start aging??  That is something that really nags at me while I watch, but other than that, I love it.  I just have to remember that this is Hollywood's version, and let that go.

3464536,4,B001AQR3LC,"This series takes the story of henry the 8th into his later years.  The series is very good and well acted. However following the death of Jane Seymour (a decent queen by any standards) henry began to deteriorate in body as well in mind. Gone was the most handsome prince of europe, a giant of a man who stood 6.5 feet when the average man was 5.2! HE was A true renaissance man who was willing to promote commoners for the good of the kingdom. he could be ruthless and kill people : but until his last seven years he can be said to be no worse than any other prince of his day as far as the average citizen was concerned. in fact he served his better than most,  but by the time of this series he was on his way to becoming the rotting mugwarp monster. so by the time of 1540 and of anne of cleaves  he was  obese and this just the beginning. his last seven years were even worse. This is the next series and hopefully they will allow the main actor to protray that moral and physical decay.
Henry's last five years or so were when he was a huge rotting man.  He was in agony and the people called him the mugwarp and everyone lived in terror around him.  This series however is the start of that process, his wound on his leg hasn't spread into a huge painful rotting mess that could be smelled far away from him yet.  however it's already reaking havoc on him and causing him pain.  This series is less about a great king but instead about the kings beginning slide into the monster mugwarp he would become.  His slaughter of the northern rebels is vengeful but standard for any kingdom of that century still the younger Henry wasn't as bloddthirsty and would have settle with a smaller number of dead. And this series shows his three years of mourning very well. His leg becomes worse and his mind more angry and this is going to get worse.  This show is
 a good show but I like ""the six wives of henry the 8th"" (this is available on dvd too)  better in it's realistic showing of the post 1536 decline.
You get a good view in here of cromwells demise too and he was a far better administrator than Henry himself even realized so his loss only hurt the kingdom in the long run.  The Tudors is fast moving and even though by the last episode henry should be shown as obese this still doesn't make this too bad a historical romp.",1273968000,,2330,4.2207207207207205

3464577,2,B001AQR3LC,"This season was weak. I loved season 1 and 2. In this season there is too much importance given to sex (scenes with King jerking off in bed are not necessary and greatly cheapen the overall effect of the Tudors saga). Also Catharine Howard is portrayed as a simple minded slut. In reality she was a living breathing woman with a brain who was forced into marrying the king who was double her age in order to elevate the Howard family in court. She  was charitable (she sent blankets to prisoners in the Tower), she tried to promote mercy in the king's judgements against others, she faced her destiny bravely. This was portrayed much better in King Henry VII starring Emily Blunt.  It is quite frankly degrading to women and history to turn the tragic story of a beautiful, naieve but brave queen who was forced into a marriage with an old man (king henry Vii) and turn it into a story about a mindless, giggly, stereotypical slut. No one is that one-dimensional.  I hope Michael Hirst lowers the sex craze and increases the depth of character to create a memorable and moving character as well as storyline.",1266969600,3,1108,4.585858585858586

3464581,3,B001AQR3LC,"OK--I'm a pushover for anything about the Tudors, and I enjoyed season three.  There are lots of problems, though, and very good points have already been made about them here, most usefully (in my opinion) by Jay Dickson in his three-star review. He and others have noted, for example, the irritating characterization of Sir Francis Bryan.  True, the actual historical figure was nicknamed ""The Vicar of Hell,"" but his portrayal in this series as a smirking, sex-obsessed, piratical bad boy was--well, boring, when it wasn't acutely annoying.

And no, it doesn't help that Henry VIII had the bad habit of beheading the most interesting, complex people in his circle one by one, so that by season three we've lost Sir Thomas More and Anne Boleyn and will, by the season's end, lose Cromwell too--a particularly fine performance by James Frain given the schizophrenically conceived part he was given to play, but of that more later.

First, though, I'd like to second Dickson's comment about how ""awesomely miscast"" Jonathan Rhys Meyers is as Henry.  Indeed.  This judgment is not a reflection on Meyers' acting talents, but rather his body type and ineradicable youthfulness, which are just plain wrong for the role.  Of course, it's obvious why he was cast anyway:  in this ratings-obsessed age, who wouldn't be able to predict the winner of the battle between an actor's six-pack and historical accuracy?

I wonder, though, if there isn't another reason many of us would prefer to watch a handsome, slim Henry than an aging, obese one.  Could it be that we are less likely to be revolted by someone's deeds if he, or she, is good-looking?  What difference does it make that, as they commit ever-more horrific crimes against humanity in this season, Henry and Suffolk are played by such stud-like actors?  Here, by the way, I differ in one respect from Mr. Dickson, who says that he did not find the representation of the Pilgrimage of Grace compelling.  I was riveted; I was also outraged.  Watching the brutal repression of what was probably the largest populist movement in England prior to its civil war was downright agonizing at times.  (I am happy to report, though, that the reality wasn't quite so horrific as portrayed; there were reprisals in villages, but as far as I can tell these targeted adult males, not women and children as depicted here.) Would we be more likely to turn off the TV in disgust if the perpetrators of such outrages were aging or unattractive?

I guess this is an inherent problem with dramatizations of the life of Henry VIII, not just with this production.  If one doesn't present him as a monster--which, admittedly, is rather boring--then how does one present him?  One needn't, of course, always ""relate"" to characters one watches, but it is harder to care about the rocky love life of tyrants than about those of more sympathetic folk.  As Meyers bedded yet another mistress in the aftermath of the Pilgrimage, I found myself asking ""Who cares?""

And what are we to make of Cromwell?  I'm as shallow here as anyone--I found myself far more sympathetic to Frain's handsome Cromwell than to the actual historical figure, who, judging from his Holbein portrait, looked like a toad.  A toad with cold little eyes.  Here, too, we have a historical conundrum that extends beyond this production.  Was Cromwell a heartless Machiavellian henchman or a sincere, even noble, reformer?  This script tries to have it both ways, and Frain gamely gives the role his best try (and a very good try it is too).  But it's hard to reconcile the contradictory evidence:  in one scene, Cromwell is praying and sounding like a proto-democrat about the need of the common people to have direct access to God, and in another scene he's ordering Suffolk up north to slaughter as many common people as he can.  Oh, and let's not forget that Cromwell was the master-mind behind the judicial murder of Anne Boleyn and those accused with her, and that he also circumvented jury trials to get convictions--an innovation that ended up recoiling on him, as he was condemned by the type of Act of Attainder he helped develop.  So which side are we on, anyway?  Or should I ask, which side of any one person are we on?

A few notes on the women.  Joss Stone is a standout as Anne of Cleves, though of course much too pretty.  But Stone does a wonderful job of portraying the fear and humiliation the historical woman must have felt.  As for Jane Seymour:  the problem is not, in my view, Annabelle Wallis's performance, but once again the conception of the role.  Evidently the makers of the series had no idea how to interpret the character, so they resorted to a common stereotype by turning her into a paragon of saintly sweetness.  This is hard to swallow.  How do we account for Jane's behavior prior to Anne Boleyn's execution, when she was waiting in the wings for her rival's decapitation?  The real Henry was said to have told Jane on the morning of Anne's trial that Anne would be condemned by afternoon--making it clear, just in case Jane had any doubts, that the whole thing was a farce.  As the historian David Starkey says in his superb book _Six Wives_, Jane ""showed no compunction in stepping to the throne over the headless corpse of her rival.  Anne might _talk_of killing Catherine; the gentle Jane went further and was an accessory-after-the-fact to the judicial murder of her predecessor"" (p. 591).

And Catherine Howard, dear heavens.  I join with Mr. Dickson in fearing greatly for season four if it continues the outrageous caricature of this poor girl, historically a victim both of her families' greed and her culture's sexism.  Yes, Catherine may have been, in Starkey's words, a ""good-time girl,"" but she could not possibly have been--no one outside a porn movie could be--the airhead played by Tamzin Merchant.  I was also appalled by the depiction of the Duchess of Northumberland's residence as a bawdy-house for illegitimate girls (a bawdy-house, unsurprisingly, to which the ever-annoying Sir Francis Bryan is sent as procurer).  Of course none of this is accurate.  Catherine did fool around, but the reason it was remembered was that not all the other girls did.  And being sent away from home to a household like the Duchess's was not the plight of poor abandoned wenches but a standard part of training for boys and girls of the nobility; Anne Boleyn was sent as a young teenager to the continent for training.  Finally, no one dangling Catherine before the king would do so with a known good-time girl:  given the king's predilection for marrying English girls, one with a tarnished past could get into a lot of trouble after the fall of Anne Boleyn--and, moreover, take her patrons with her.  As I remember, the Duke of Norfolk, Catherine's uncle and a major court player inexplicably excised from this series, was not in the king's good books after his niece's execution.",1266537600,8,6917,4.824427480916031

3464627,3,B001AQR3LC,"With Cardinal Wolsey, Thomas More, Katherine of Aragon, and Anne Boleyn all dead by the end of the second season of THE TUDORS, the best actors who did most of the heavy lifting for the series (Sam Neill, Jeremy Northam, Maria Doyle Kennedy, and Natalie Dormer) are all gone and unable to help the awesomely miscast Jonathan Rhys Meyer as Henry VIII with any of the heavy lifting, which bodes pretty dismally for the start of the third season of THE TUDORS. Unfortunately things aren't much helped by the casting of the inexpressive Annabel Wallis as Jane Seymour, the third of Henry's wives, or by the addition of a new important character by Alan von Sprang, named after--and only extremely loosely based on--Sir Francis Bryan, here conceived as a kind of studly head thug in the king's service who brutally chases down his enemies and couples with various court wenches in palace alcoves. The suppression of the Pilgrimage of Grace doesn't create much narrative interest, either, nor does the persecution of the family of Cardinal Pole (mostly we see lots of suffering people being executing in multiple creative ways with little explanation as to why, say, one should be sodomized with a red-hot poker, or why another should be hanged from a castle's walls wearing heavy chains). Frankly, I wouldn't have stuck around had I not been waiting to see how the Anne of Cleves marriage would be handled, but when Joss Stone enters as that German princess, everything comes to life again because of her great dignity as the awkward and poignant ""Flanders mare"" whom Henry rejects for not being attractive enough. Stone and Sarah Bolger, as the complex and careful Princess Mary, are the only two actors who deserve any honors for their performances: we can be grateful they will figure importantly into the fourth and final season of this series. (On the other hand, we have much to dread given the already annoying performance of the simpering Tamzin Merchant, who plays Henry's fifth wife, Catherine Howard, as if she were playing Nomi Malone in SHOWGIRLS.) The series suffers more gravely than ever by this season from the producers' ghastly decision to envision the Tudor court as motivated entirely by lusts for sex and power (in that order), and Rhys Meyer is pretty much a complete embarrassment by this point. When his Henry VIII confers with his bishops as to the central tenets of Anglican doctrine, or designs Nonesuch Palace while sequestered after the death of Jane Seymour, it's simply unbelievable. By this point we're pretty much just ticking off the wives one by one until they're all gone; one wonders whether the producers will finally have the common sense to make Henry VIII obese and old by the final season (there are many displays here even still of Rhys Meyer's perfect sixpack).",1264204800,5,2801,4.8989473684210525

Something everyone including himself noticed. This would humble him slightly but by then he was somewhat finished. Anne of Cleves was the only one who would take him. The others found him now unappealing and he had earned the reputation of a tyrant who kills off his wives. He was however not used to such a physically low-caliber woman compared to what he was used to getting. This must have been a shocking realization to him. She was known to be hideous with a fat ass but sharp as a whip and very much beautiful inside full of inner beauty, compassion and love. He couldn't stand her. This is an important part for them to ice over. In this fat stage Henry I believe goes through alot of life changes....Its kind of making me want to throw Season 3 in the garbage...

On That note can you ALSO please start casting Romans in movies about the ROMAN EMPIRE instead of blond haired white guys saying stuff like 'I dar say Ceasar, you shall call me Sir~ ma lord'

3464632,1,B001AQR3LC,"Season 3 was just awful.  JRM isn't much of an actor anyhow but his so-called transformation as Henry VIII is laughable.  He thinks if he screams and sprays spittle one minute and then gets in someone's face and whispers the next, we might actually think he's passionate.  His acting is calculated and takes me out of the story and into his caricature of Henry VIII.

The actress who plays Jane Seymour, Annabelle Wallis, is so wooden that she doesn't even appear real.  She tried to act queenly and instead she gave the impression that she was auditioning for a high school play.  Anita Briem did a much better job in Season 2.  Even in Wallis' childbirth scene, they dubbed in Natalie Dormer's cries from HER childbirth scene.  Pathetic.  There was no chemistry whatsoever between JRM and Wallis.  Dormer made JRM look good and his poor acting was overlooked solely b/c of her.

Both the men and women have been stunningly attractive throughout all three seasons and yet, judging from artists' rendering, they were anything BUT attractive in reality.  Of course, we want to be swept up in the romance of the era but to have JRM shriek ""She looks like a horse"" about his wife Anne of Cleves is ridiculous when someone as pretty as Joss Stone is playing the part.

The focus on fictional characters such as Lady Misseldon is also objectionable.  Why spend so much time on them when there is so much history that could have been covered?  The actress portraying the part also made her appear cocky, especially when entering a room and yet we know that women were to keep their eyes lowered and assume a subservient manner especially when dealing w/royalty.

James Frain is the only worthwhile character in this season, although he, too, was made to evoke our sympathy for Thomas Cromwell in the end but given his participation in the execution of so many, it would be difficult to feel anything but revulsion for him.  Still, Frain's acting was solid throughout all three seasons.  His execution scene was over done.  The axe man was hung over and chopped away at Cromwell until someone took the axe away from him and finished the job.  In reality, the axe man was an axe ""boy"", a young boy who had to swing the axe three times.  It's the unnecessary exaggeration and gore that adds to the unlikeability of Season 3.  I'll watch Season 4 only because I want to see how Michael Hirst butchers history and panders to JRM's ridiculous acting.  Maybe if JRM had worn some padding to indicate the tremendous weight gain that Henry experienced it would help but his acting isn't strong enough to make us forget history.  Can't wait to see Henry VIII get his but given how history has been treated throughout all three seasons, it's doubtful it will be accurate.  No matter that it's ""historical fiction"".  It's more fiction than history.",1263427200,13,2830,4.701219512195122

3464636,5,B001AQR3LC,"This costume drama features England's splendid Renaissance dynasty under King Henry VIII. Beginning in Season 1 when Henry VIII was growing desperate for an heir and growing distant from his first wife, the series moves quickly to the period when Anne Boelyn became his obsession. During this time Cardinal Wolsey rose to become the power behind his throne, ruling ruthlessly and nearly absolutely while Henry (played by Johnathon Rhyes Meyers) for the most part followed the Cardinal's advice, maneuvering through a series of betrayals and plots against him. When Anne Boelyn plays much harder to get than any woman ever has, Henry begins to search for a way out of his marriage to Katherine of Aragon, so that he can make Anne his wife. Needing a divorce, Henry turns to Wolsey, who promises to help him create waves of backlash from the church, as well as the Spanish Habsburg dynasty and its overseas empire. The Tudors is a fantastic show which showcases the life and times of King Henry the VIII. The first four episodes have been phenomenal works of cinematic art which I hope will continue on for seasons to come.",1262563200,,1121,4.84375
3464637,4,B001AQR3LC,"Season three does a good job at holding up the Tudor promise, but even so is less spectacular than the prior two seasons.  Once again it ends with a dramatic beheading of a key figure (as frequently happened in the real Tudor times), and we have a continuation of the queen-for-a-day motif for which Henry VIII was so well known.

Jane Seymour, played well but not excitingly by Anita Briem, is a continuation of the character by a new actress from season two.  However, in terms of the plot (and the actual history), she doesn't last as long nor does she have the same spark as the now-absent Anne Boleyn.  The intrigues of the Seymours are not as gripping as those of the Boleyns, and the main political figure, Cromwell (played by James Frain) doesn't cut the same figure as either  Wolsey (Sam Neil) or Thomas More (Jeremy Northam).  There feels like there's too much arcane politicking in his downfall for it to be truly exciting.  The introduction of the figure of Pole (premature and out of place politically) seems almost pointless, alas.

Jonathan Rhys Meyers continues to do a great job as Henry, and Henry Cavill as Brandon turns in a servicable performance, but one feels that the writing is letting the Brandon side down.  At one point Brandon remarks to Henry that they have both lost their youth, and there is that sense about the series as whole to me.  It is still good, but it is no longer remarkable and new.

The brief marriage (historically speaking) to Anne of Cleaves was dealt with very quickly in the story lines as well.  We barely get to see Anne (played by Joss Stone) before she is pensioned off, an unconsummated match (and one can't really understand why the lusty Henry wouldn't find Joss Stone alluring).

There are a few DVD extras, including episodes to another show (United States of Tara -- not quite The Tudors), and a few interviews and timeline features. This is an abbreviated season, with only 8 episodes, but (and perhaps this is not a good sign) it felt as long as the prior seasons, which each had 10 episodes.  I give five stars to each of the earlier seasons, but this one feels at best a four-star experience for me.  But, there are two more wives to look forward to in the upcoming season, and who knows what will become of The Tudors after that.",1262390400,3,2295,4.5634146341463415
3464638,5,B001AQR3LC,"From my wife Sarah: Having read some of the other reviews, I must add that despite the few ""flaws"" written about, this lavish series is totally captivating. Certainly there are some weaknesses as noted by the other reviewers. Regardless, season 3 was totally fascinating and so well done on so many levels.

Not only does the writing tell the story beautifully, it reveals the complex personalities, relationships and motives of the main players. The movie also explores the religious battles and changes that were happening at that time. This was amazing to see, especially in light of the fact that what happened then still impacts Christians today. This was facinating! It also explores how the King's lust and love life impacted world politics, which of course had long lasting effects.

The majority of the acting was outstanding. Of course Jonathan Rhys Meyers is amazing as King Henry, and so believable. He is clearly, utterly commited to the role. James Frain as Lord Cromwell was fantastic. He's a fine actor and I always enjoy his performances, such as in the Count of Monte Cristo. I must disagree with another reviewer when it comes to Annabelle Wallis's performance as Queen Jane. She was real in the role, projecting a kind heart, humility, a submissive attitude and total devotion towards her husband the King - even when he was cheating on her. I think she did a wonderful job. Joss Stone as Anne of Cleves was so effective. However she's very attractive and I just had to wonder if that was realistic, since Henry seemed to find Anne of Cleves so unappealing. It seems they should have chosen someone more plain. Lastly I want to mention that the young lady who played the princess Mary did a beautiful job and was so believable.

Lastly, the sets and costumes are absolutely amazing. The realism of this series is top notch. I think anyone who's seen season 1 and 2 will certainly want to see season 3. If you haven't seen this series, it's highly recommended. I'm looking forward to season 4.

I must add a caution - there is nudity. However it's cable and they're trying to get ratings. There's always fast forward.",1262304000,3,2136,4.780487804878049
3464639,5,B001AQR3LC,"This is the most gripping dramatic historical series I've ever seen. As I finished each episode, I could barely wait for the next one, and there were occasions when I watched two or three episodes back to back, getting me to bed late and leaving me tired the next day -- but it was worth it. It's said that time flies when you're having fun, and some of these episodes felt like only 5 or 10 minutes. My wife had the same response.

The power of this series is a result of achieving excellence in all facets. The actors are uniformly convincing, the scenery is authentic and transporting, and the pacing and dynamics of the plot have a perfect ebb and flow. Many key dimensions of the human experience are represented, such as romance, (hot) sex, power politics, attempts at justice, friendship, revenge, religious conflict, glimpses of ordinary life, and violence so brutal that we tender Americans can scarcely comprehend or stomach it.

As to historical accuracy, I'm not qualified to judge with expertise, but I suspect that they got the general contours reasonably right, even if some details are debatable. Moreover, none of us were actually there and reconstructing the past always involves much inference, so a useful approximation is all we can aim for anyway. I would hope that anyone watching or reading a historical work will know to take things with a grain of salt, especially the details.

Some lessons I drew from the series are: (a) I'm glad I don't live in the England of this period, (b) being King isn't all it's cracked up to be, and (c) check your ambition and stay away from highly powerful people, lest you fall out of favor and wind up damaged or worse.

Highly recommended to anyone interested in the European history of this period (particularly that of England), or to anyone who just enjoys great drama.

Note: I've watched all three seasons and they're all equally excellent, so I've posted this review for all three.",1262131200,2,1947,4.7485207100591715

3464644,5,B001AQR3LC,"I admit I had to fast forward through some of the more gruesome scenes--I just can't bear to watch an execution even when it's fake.  King Henry's cruelty seemed to know no limits.  And yet I couldn't stop watching the series altogether; I would have missed all the other great material:  the actors, the amazing costumes, the sets and scenery, music, dancing, sex, plotting and scheming and subterfuge and manipulation.  It's a fascinating look at the world of several centuries ago, with a tyrant on the throne and his people subject to his whims.

Rhys Myers seemed to do better this time around in terms of his acting, while the others were as wonderful as ever.  Henry Cavill is especially good as Henry's friend Charles Brandon, the Duke of Suffolk.

3464645,4,B001AQR3LC,"First, I LOVE this show but this season I felt was weaker than the previous two. The previous two seasons had left me drooling for more--this one however kinda left me wondering how the next seasons will be. On another note though I kind of feel like there is a lot about to happen based on all the introduction of the new wives and other characters. As usual the cinematography is high quality and acting is great. I still have to give this 4 stars for being such high quality-I'd give a 3 1/2 for it being a ''filler'' season.",1261526400,,528,4.29
3464646,4,B001AQR3LC,"While the first two seasons presented King Henry VIII as a young, hedonistic king, Season 3 gives viewers a unique opportunity to consider, historically, what may have been if he had been a less capricious and more morally serious and intellectually-principled statesman.

 What sort of king could Henry VIII have been if the gentle, tolerant and politically savvy Jane Seymour had remained long enough to exert substantive influence on her husband? Perhaps he would have been compared to a middle-age Solomon as opposed to a Dionysian - ""Neroesque"" figure.

What would have happened if the King hadn't eventually turned on his trusted advisor, Thomas Cromwell (and ultimately engineered his economic and political destruction)? Conversely, what would have happened if Henry had rid of himself of Cromwell sooner? Would there still have been an uprising against the king? Would the bloodshed that resulted from those uprising been averted?

 For those of you who have watched Seasons 1 and 2, it is interesting to contrast Cromwell's gradual and humiliating fall from grace with the swift, cool and profoundly dignified dismantling of his intellectual, philosophical and political rival, Sir Thomas More.

Jane Seymour and Thomas Cromwell are presented in the season 3 as Henry VIII's super ego (his always self-conscious angels) and id (the demons which seems to grow ever stronger as the King's youthful vitality slips away).

 King Henry's story is quickly coming to a close. Cumulatively, the King had six wives. The fourth and fifth wives of the King are introduced in this season--- there is Anne of Cleves who makes a brief and powerful impression on the viewer (she is essentially the Protestant version of Catherine of Aragon -- which may explain the King's visceral reaction to her) and Katherine Howard, who is presented as such a cipher that she makes virtually no impression at all.

I am extremely impressed with this series. Even those who are not well-versed in history know what transpired during the Tudors' reign. But this show somehow manages to maintain a fresh perspective on said events.

Season 3 is a must-see.",1261353600,7,2135,5.144508670520231
3464647,5,B001AQR3LC,"As a history buff, I find the series extremely fun to watch.  If you slept through history in school, this series will interest you, as it is a sanitized way to learn history about Henry. Henry VIII's role taking a nation to break away from the Catholic Church, and his wives show how one person can forever change the course of history.  The artistic license from the writers makes it a fun series, although it is filmed at a castle in Ireland- a country he could never get to fall in line.",1261008000,,491,4.326086956521739
3464648,3,B001AQR3LC,"While I like the show and would buy all threee seasons, I don't buy non-high def DVD's.  I'll never purchase this series until it is released on Blu-Ray.  It was shot in high-def and is shown that way..  Why wait???",1260921600,2,215,4.325
3464649,4,B001AQR3LC,"I thought season 3 did an admirable job of covering a lot of ground in a short time. I say short, because it is the shortest season yet with 8 episodes instead of the 10 episode seasons 1 & 2. I kept waiting for the last 2, until I finally accepted the fact that they ended the season with the dubious introduction of Katherine Howard.

In season 3 you begin to more fully see the transition of Henry from an energetic youth of passion and intellectual promise to an irritable tyrant. His ego, always his greatest obstacle, becomes more pronounced as he dismisses Anne of Cleaves as looking 'like a horse' and refuses to fully recognize her as his queen, ultimately dissolving the marriage. His leg injury continues to grow more septic, lending to his lack of athleticism and irritability, and with Thomas Moore dead he has no one close to him to temper his passions. Cromwell's fall from favor is rapid and severe, largely due to his self-interested advocation of Anne of Cleaves.

The Tudors is , first and foremost, good entertainment, and should not be embraced as historically accurate (a common criticism that I've seen). It paints the history of Henry VIII with broad strokes, capturing the spirit of the events with dramatic license. I look forward to seeing the continued transition of Henry into the gluttonous despot he is widely remembered as, as well as the continued parade of failed marriages.",1260748800,4,1408,4.766393442622951

3464651,3,B001AQR3LC,I don't have Showtime. I have obtaining my copies of the Tudors through Amazon Canada. The American has pilot episodes of other Showtime series and very little on the Tudors.

3464652,5,B001AQR3LC,"Season three of ""The Tudors"" continues with King Henry VIII being married to Jane Seymour who finally gives the King what he has always hoped for: a male heir to his Kingdom. Like his other mistresses and wives, Henry soon gets bored with Jane and turns his attention to other whores, most notably Anne of Cleves, then the King finds himself involved with the most dangerous woman he has ever enountered, Katherine Howard. This season also documents Henry's suppression of The Pigrimage of Grace and the destruction and downfall of Thomas Cromwell. An entertaing year with impeccable and oustanding production values, ""The Tudors"" will satisfy the most ardent of history buffs, especially those who have a fondness for European history. This season, however, only contains eights episodes, unlike the first two years that featured ten shows each. The fourth season will be ""The Tudors"" last and it will be interesting to see how the writers and producers will wrap up the series.",1259020800,,979,5.049382716049383

8278775,5,B001AQR3LC,"The discs come in a plastic snap case. The discs play fine.

This is the kind of show I really enjoy watching. Wonderful locations, excellent characters, and coherent story and character arcs. The beheadings begin in the first season when Buckingham loses his head, proving no one is safe from the crazy king. The smart characters run for the hills and stay far away from the king. In the second season Sir Humphrey, Ann Boleyn's brother, several other men, and then Ann Boleyn all lose their heads. Cromwell loses his head in season three. In the fourth season Culpepper and the king's skinny blonde wife lose their heads. Before losing her head the blonde wife looks up at the clear blue sky and whispers a memorable line. ""Life is beautiful.""

Like the Merlin series the Tudors featured many actors that went on to have wonderful parts in Game of Thrones.

If you're looking for good stuff to watch consider miniseries like The Astronauts Wives Club (2015), Band of Brothers (2001), Frank Herberts Dune (2000), Frank Herberts Children of Dune (2003), Into the West (2005), Lonesome Dove (1989), Manhattan (2014-2015), Return to Lonesome Dove (1993), Pride and Prejudice (1995), Taken (2002) and The 10th Kingdom (2000), which are all terrific because they have clear beginnings that establish an objective, then strong middles and conclusive endings where the goal is achieved, like a good novel.

Other shows Ive really enjoyed include Battlestar Galactica (2004-2009), Breaking Bad (2008-2013), Cowboy Bebop (1998), Downton Abbey (2010-2015), Firefly (2002), Game of Thrones (2011-2019), Granite Flats (2013-2015), The IT Crowd (2006-2013), Jericho (2006-2008), Merlin (2008-2012), The Prisoner (1967-1968), Rome (2005-2007), Spartacus: Gods of the Arena (2011), Spartacus: Blood and Sand (2010), Stargate: SG-1 (1997-2007), Stargate: Atlantis (2004-2009), Star Trek (1966-1969), Star Trek Voyager (1995-2001), and The Tudors (2007-2010). I didn't list any contemporary series Im following that don't have an end date yet, not conducive to binge watching from beginning to finish.

If you like reading try some of my favorite fantasy and sci-fi authors: Richard Adams, Palo Bacigulupi, Suzanne Collins, Abe Evergreen, Diana Gabaldon, Hugh Howey, George Martin, Brandon Sanderson, John Scalzi, and Andy Weir.",1520985600,,2312,5.428969359331476
