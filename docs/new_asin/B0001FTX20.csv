8011861,5,B0001FTX20,I watch this movie back in 80s I want to know when you going to get this movie back in on regular DVD so I can buy it.,1418428800,,118,3.25
8011862,3,B0001FTX20,"The movie seemed scarier when I watched it in the dark at 16 years old. Still a good scare, not an overwhelming amount of shocking loud bursts of startling sounds and things jumping at you. Not a great physiological thriller, but not all the way in the other end of the spectrum either.",1387843200,,286,4.415094339622642
8011863,3,B0001FTX20,"I first watched this movie at a slumber party in the late 80's. I had forgotten all about it until some recently mentioned it, and I remember how much it scared me as a little girl. I tried to rent it, but no luck. I just bought a used VHS tape on amazon.com, probably for less than the rental would have cost. This movie has great 80's style, and a creepy soundtrack. Tawny Kitean was striking in this movie, which almost made up for the horrible acting. There are ton's of cheesy one liners, and some of the murder scenes are pretty grusome. The ending sucks, but the rest of the movie almost made up for it. If you like 80's horror, and can rent or buy this cheap, why not give it a try?",1184284800,,690,4.118518518518519
