7159974,1,B00X797LUS,The first 3 seasons are sensational. I really really enjoyed them but one of the plans was for it to end after season 3 but ABC just hired a different show runner and kept going. I would very highly recommend you stop at season 3 and call it a day. The season 3 finale works very much like a series finale except for maybe two unanswered questions. The last season is not worth it.,1438732800,5,381,4.162162162162162
7159975,5,B00X797LUS,This is the best drama show since Melrose Place loved it and even tho it came to the end I will miss watching it.,1438041600,,113,3.75
7159976,5,B00X797LUS,Awesome show with an awesome finale!,1437350400,6,36,5.166666666666667
7159977,5,B00X797LUS,"This fourth season was just as addicting and juicy as those before it. Although things have changed, we still get that juicy drama that we crave. David's ""resurrection"" was genius, and it opened up so much more for the series. Revenge is such an amazing show and I will truly miss it. There aren't many good shows like it today remaining. You will definitely not regret giving into this guilty pleasure ~ it's so good and absolutely addicting!",1435968000,9,443,4.6923076923076925
7159978,3,B00X797LUS,Will there be a complete series box? I think it would be appropriate. Disney should release a boxset with the shape of Emily's infinity box and the cases of each season should have the shape of David Clarke's diaries. It would be an amazing and appropriate collectors' edition. I hope they already have it in my mind!,1435708800,7,317,4.578947368421052
7159979,5,B00X797LUS,"I was instantly addicted to this show when it premiered back in 2011 and I watched it until the very end. I waited to see the final episode which aired tonight and I gotta say I'm going to miss it! It was such a unique series, and I'm sure I'm not going to find other show like this one. ABC did an amazing job with this one.
""Revenge"" is such an amazing show that kept the fire from the beginning until the end; and with the final and fourth season, this is not the exception. With amazing performances by Emily VanCamp, Madeleine Stowe, Gabriel Mann and the rest of the cast, the show still brings twists and shocking turns that kept me at the edge of my seat from week to week. It's sad to see it ending on season 4, but it seems like it was the right time to end it.
In some episodes, the plots seem to struggle to evolve, and it has some fillers here and there, but, season 4 was a good season overall, delivering some of the best episodes of the entire series, that's why I decided to give it 5 stars anyway. If you haven't seen the ending yet, you'll not be dissapointed!
And I can't wait to get it on DVD in order to complete my Revenge collection, and I'm probably watching the whole show again when I get this box set! Goodbye Revenge, you were amazing.",1431216000,22,1263,4.159183673469387

7159982,5,B00X797LUS,"Love it, Love it, Love It!!! Just make sure that if you live in the United States that you order the right format. READ READ READ, I read the reviews first and knew what format to order first and everything was fine, so just be aware of that. If you live in the USA you ""can not"" order the box set, as it will not play in our DVD / Blue-Ray Players because it's in a different format. You have to order each individually in the United States.  I ordered ALL of the SEASONS as they are ADDICTING. It's one of  those shows where you can pull a marathon to watch!

7160027,1,B00X797LUS,"I don't know why I kept watching this when it clearly should've ended with season 3. I rarely ever leave bad reviews, but this season really bothered me.

*SPOILERS**

What was the point of killing Daniel? So his baby mama could have her own vengeance spree? She's the least threatening person on TV. Boring!!

And Nolan? I thought he and Emily were best friends? They hardly interacted this season. He was too busy hanging out with the woman who spent way too much time trying to convince us that she wasn't crazy. But she kinda was. Then he married her? What the hell? Did they not know what to do with him?

Emily's dad? Wow. We spent seasons wondering what kind of guy he was, and the truth was beyond disappointing. He is revealed to be alive this whole time and never told his daughter! What a great dad!! Then he practically worships Victoria to the point where he almost kills his daughter!! I know he's probably been lonely, but he still needed to act like a man. Like wake the hell up.

And lastly, Jack and Emily. I'm not gonna bash them because I already knew that they were going to end up together. But the way they did it was annoying. They waited too long to stick those to together, and the show got cancelled. But married? Wouldn't it have made more since for them to end the show dating? You can't stick a couple together and then have them get married an episode later! Especially when she just finished dating someone else. Obviously, she wasn't ready for marriage.

I love Revenge and I will rewatch it at some point. But I'm not going to bother buying this season.",1451865600,3,1587,4.436426116838488
