7776479,4,B01H49VL66,"Brings back so many memories. The quality is a little poor on the episodes, but I think all of our eyes have gotten use to viewing HD content that when we go back and view non-hd content we tend to notice. Plus the master tapes they used to transfer the series to digital probably had some wear and tear. With all that said the its still very watchable and will take you back. If you're a fan of this series than snatch this up now, as the price is right!",1511308800,3,455,4.066666666666666

7776481,2,B01H49VL66,"So, so strange.  I guess curiosity and nostalgia got the better of me. I bought it from a nice seller, opened it right away and started remembering many of the episodes I saw in endless reruns in the 80s!  I think it was the only after-school cartoon we had on local tv way back when. I had forgotten how deadpan or businesslike Dennis was about his big impulsive ideas.  His voice cracks me up.  The music is AMAZING and gets stuck in my head. Some of the segments have weird titles like ""Dennis Destroys Dallas""... yeah.. I'm glad the entire series is available because I haven't seen many of them.  Looking forward to more weirdness.",1506211200,,636,4.495652173913044

7776493,4,B01H49VL66,"""Hey, Mr. Wilson!"" One of the most popular comic strips in history has also been a live-action TV series, a live-action movie trilogy by the WB, and especially an animated series from DiC, alias Cookie Jar Entertainment! Now, all 78 episodes of the animated series is now in 1 DVD set, at an ""Amazon"" low price, by Mill Creek Entertainment; and it has lackluster packaging to prove such dirt-cheapness. Good thing they can all fit in 1 normal-size 6-disc DVD case, with 3 sleeves for discs 7 to 9, without bulging a lot! Same way with Heathcliff's DiC series; it too is a 9-disc DVD set by Mill Creek with lackluster packaging, and can also fit in a 6-disc DVD case with 3 sleeves for the last 3 discs! At 3 shorts episodes per show with Dennis, you never know what Dennis will get into trouble for next, in good predicaments AND bad ones! What a way to celebrate the comic strip's 65th anniversary in 2016; with this very 9-disc DVD set!",1485388800,2,938,4.459302325581396

7776501,5,B01H49VL66,I grew up with watching the cartoon of Dennis The Menace every day after school when I was in elementry school & its a good show & it's always funny when Dennis gets into trouble or doing his pranks to make George Wilson or the neighbors or his parents ticked off for goodness sake.,1478304000,,282,4.2407407407407405

7776505,2,B01H49VL66,"This was one of my favorite cartoons as a kid and this set is at best blah! First off the packaging is terrible given its 2016! Maybe it would be ok back when DVD's first began to break into the market but paper sleeves?!?! Really? Originally they had the wrong intro on the first DVD they released but if you are releasing the entire collection as box set you have no excuse not to correct your mistake. So again this set has the incorrect intro which is so lame and a complete Nostalgia Buzz kill. I'm passing on the lack of care to their product in the form of this review, no thanks Mill Creek, please try harder next time. You tube has you beat.",1474243200,12,650,4.208

7776508,5,B01H49VL66,"Sometimes I see reviews that might delve a little too deep into a topic- especially when dealing with a children's cartoon.

Well, this awesome DVD collection serves its purpose- a fun nostalgia filled watch from a popular early 80s cartoon. I used to watch Dennis the Menace as a kid all the time and loved it. So I ordered this so that from time to time I can watch a little as I'm relaxing and feeling nostalgic.

You get the entire series for only $20. You can't beat that. Plus, as I understand it, this is the first time the last 13 episodes are released.

If you have kids, this is a great attention grabber with TONS of cartoons on it.

Really fun buy.",1473638400,6,660,4.298387096774194

8764639,4,B01H49VL66,I'm really happy to have all of these episodes. I wish they included chilly Willy and the other little short cartoons that the original had. The quality is around 380p not bad for the price.  I just wish it wasn't spread out over like 8 disks cause it didn't need to be.  Each episode is about 50mb quality but streched to 600 700mb each cause it's on disk. Still ok if you're trying to actually watch them on a DVD player. Overall I'm pretty satisfied just wish it had everything the original had. Not as good as I remember the show being but worth 9.99 if you really want to watch them again.,1538265600,,594,4.247787610619469
