8667706,4,B00LPPA1BM,"This is six episodes about an auto restoration shop in Oregon that specializes in Chrysler products. Too much time is spent aspiring to create different characters in the shop akin to Orange County Choppers. A little bit of time is spent restoring vintage muscle cars which when they dare to actually do it is pretty interesting. I think they determined that to be entertaining they could not just work on cars, who wants to watch people WORK! Occasionally binge worthy. A seasoned watcher can soon figure out when to use the FF button.

Extras share how the show came into being. RARELY mentions prices which I think would be insightful!",1529712000,,638,4.8
8667707,2,B00LPPA1BM,"This show is really great---but NOTE!!  The early seasons are NOT good!!  I started watching right before they got rid of a couple of the guys that Mark was always fighting with. The show is hugely improved since then!  I think season five is where it is just Mark, Royal, Will, Dave, and a few others including his daughter.  The focus is much more on the cars, and the work that the team does is incredible.  Just amazing that they can bring back pieces of junk that in some cases have been rotting for decades, and they bring them back to better than the day they rolled off the factory floor!  On the side, Mark is good for keeping things light, and I find it funny, others might not, but again, show is 100% better than what it was in early seasons,  Cheers!",1513209600,3,763,4.293706293706293
8667708,3,B00LPPA1BM,"Just received Graveyard Carz season 1 and was expecting....like 4 episodes per disc on three discs?!?
A total of two episodes per disc? C'MON!  TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED!!!! The least Amazon could do is
include an 'online download' of the actual twelve episodes along with the poor representation on DVD.
I don't subscribe to cable either!  I've heard a lot of bickering went on but this is ridiculous!?!?
I'm thoroughly ""MOPAR OR NO CAR!"" I own a dozen classic Chrysler products so I anticipate Mopars!
It's as though the producers DON'T think MOPARS will keep anybody's attention so they throw-in an
OVER-dramatization of shop sarcasm and silly tirades....with a spec or two of actual cars.  Unbelievable!",1489795200,3,702,5.140350877192983
