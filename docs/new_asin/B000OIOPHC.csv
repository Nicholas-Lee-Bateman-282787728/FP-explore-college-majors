2796522,5,B000OIOPHC,"Season 8 did not disappoint.  It was very well written and the final two episodes are so well written and the final scenes of the final episode are beautiful.  It was such a joy to see the sisters finally get a happy ending after all they have endured the last 8 years and seeing familar faces in the final episode was just wonderful.

I have no complaints about season eight of the final episode.  Through Prue is mentioned, it was a little sad not see a photo of Prue anywhere in the house in the end when so many photos of the family were shown.  But again, thats all a legal issue between Shannon and the producers.

This is a must have season!",1175472000,64,648,4.227642276422764
2796523,5,B000OIOPHC,"Well where to start....I was a little worried on how they were going to end season 7, and they ended it wonderfuly.  So waiting patiently to find out if there was going to be a season 8 and 'blessed be' there was.  Now the question was how were they going to end the series...and they came to the most phenominal ending ever.  For all true Charmed fans, I don't think we could have asked for a better ending.  This truly was an AMAZING series, missing Pru, finding Paige, and loving Mom and Grams, this show will always keep a smile on your face.  I recommend getting all 8 seasons, season 8 is an absolute must have, just for the extras alone its worth the money.  Enjoy!

2796591,3,B000OIOPHC,"I love charmed. Its my favorite show to ever be on tv. I have laughed, and I have shed some serious tears. However, I have to agree with most everyone else, as time went on, the show got worse. I didn't mind the introduction of Paige, in fact I came to really like her. I hated what they did to Cole. The inner conflict of a half demon being in love with a ""source"" of good made for an excellent story, but the writers turned him into a crazy stalker and killed him. Cole was probably my favorite character overall, but in order to keep the show going, I'll let that slide. What I hated was Billie and Christy. Just why? Why did you introduce them? They were like one giant big lipped alligator moment that served no purpose at all.
I don't really care about spoilers, but spoilers coming, even though this show has been off the air for nearly ten years--SPOILERS AHEAD.
the finale-- why did it boil down to Billie and Christy? Christy with the triad (even though Cole destroyed them), and the charmed ones killing her. That's a bit out of character, but I hated Billie and Christy so much that I didn't shed a tear when Christy died. I think Billie should have been taken with her, but whatever.
But-- the ending. Everything about the ending was wonderful, all the way down to the music. (Unless that changed in the dvd version. I haven't got that far yet. I saw all the episodes on their original air date, and then in syndication. ) the charmed ones growing old, living happy lives, their children growing up and having children of their own, all the way to the scene of an elderly piper and Leo ascending the stars, past a wall of memories. Combine that with the musical accompaniment and it was a very beautiful moment that I shed authentic tears over.
Charmed is a great show overall. Season eight... it had a few moments, including the ending, but overall was meh. I blame Billie.",1464652800,,1887,4.425287356321839

2796617,3,B000OIOPHC,"The seventh should have been the last season .

Charmed was a great show in the beginning magical charming cute funny hilarious even at times and sweet.

It was heartfelt emotional and enjoyable as well.

The first 3 seasons it was at the top of its game period.

When the unbelievably hunky Julian McMahon was added to the show it was a very good fit at that time.

But then they screwed up royally destroying his character and essentially turning Phoebe into a cold heartless insensitive monster towards Julians character Cole.

When Shannon Doherty left the show struggled a LOT but there were still a lot of very funny charming cute sweet heartfelt episodes nonetheless even without Dohertys presence.

I always loved this show up until the regretfully bitter end.

Season 7 was pretty good and ended the way a series finale would have ended.

Yet the cast and crew found out not long after they had been renewed for a final 8th season.

Unfortunately many of the decisions they made going into the final season were a huge mistake and ultimately a BORING mistake .

I hated how the final season implemented some new character and while I love Kaley Cuoco on Big Bang Theory she sucked so bad on this show period.

At times she was funny and interesting but for the most part? Nope an unnecessary character that just did not fit at all.

Then we throw in that bitter vindictive rotten sister of hers Christy and that made the storylines even worse.

The 8th season paid more attention to some new character and less to the characters that we had gotten to know and care about over the years.

That was a HUGE mistake right there.

Leo played by Brian Krause was also taken off of the canvas for a LONG time basically up until the shows series finale which was also a big mistake.

He was only on the show for a limited amount of episodes then disappeared until the very last episode.

The concentration on the 2 unbelievably boring bland and totally uninteresting sisters was the biggest mistake of them all.

They did concentrate on Paige Piper and Phoebe in the last season but nowhere near enough as they should have.

The storylines were not that interesting and didn't really pull you in like a lot of the other ones had beforehand also a BIG mistake.

The actors at times even seemed like they were sleepwalking through their roles and not making a lot of effort at times and that was also a BIG MISTAKE.

It seemed like in the last season that the actors were simply burnt out and didn't have much oomph like they did in the beginning.

The writing in the last season was also terrible I remember some stupid episode where Billie played by Cuoco was haunted by some demon from her childhood and kept wanting to confront him.

She used some kind of magic spell to become super strong but every single time shed get scared and run off .

It made no sense a lot of the final season didn't make sense.

The only thing that really helped the final season for me anyways was the finale itself.

Now THAT was beautifully done and so was the confrontation I won't ruin for those who haven't seen the final season yet.

I found myself tearing up when the finale ended it was satisfying sweet and made sense the way they ended it.

I loved this show still do I own every season thankfully but unfortunately the last season was one of the worst in a lot of ways.

I try to focus on the positives though like the finale and how it ended the entire show and the awesome confrontation that was so dramatic and well done.

Granted the final season did have some pretty good episodes.

The opening of the 8th and final season was for example hilarious and interesting the way they did it.

I also have to say the eye candy really helped the last season Victor Webster Ivan Sergei and Brandon Quinn as Agent Murphy were just phew such a nice distraction from the abysmal quality of this season.",1429142400,,3888,4.4772727272727275

2796656,2,B000OIOPHC,"The last season really didn't do the entire series any justice at all. Billie was far too big of character. If they intended the final battle to be against a friend like that they should have brought Billie in a few seasons ago and had a minor side SL for her all along. It all felt very rushed. It started off all wrong to begin with when the sisters were shielding their identities for demon free lives.

I think the first half of the season should have been all about the sisters having to make up and explain what they did with the avatars. The first half of the season could have been about the sisters gaining back the elders trust, and also dealing with the exposure fall out, with the help of agent Murphy, and he should have been the Henry that Paige would fall for. Coop also should have been brought in early season and that love story should have been told all season, not summed up for us by future Wyatt and Chris.

The end battle I didn't like at all. It was ooc for the sisters to want to kill Billie and christy. It would have made more sense if the sisters found out the triad was behind it by the end of the season and it was the sisters VS the triad to try and get Billie and christys power on their side.

The final episode was literally done before when piper went back in time to save her sisters. I'd rather them have fought a final battle and sadly one be lost. (piper i think since she had her kids already) Ending the charmed ones reign. But the triad loses too and the battle is over... For now until evil regenerates and the charmed kids take over.",1410825600,,1577,4.198019801980198

2796692,1,B000OIOPHC,"I have always loved Charmed. As a totally straight woman I had the biggest crush on Alyssa Milano. The series should have ended with season 7 with the sisters faking their deaths. How insane is it to fake your death, change your identity and everyone remain in the same house? I will say pretty insane! That is the point where you leave town or at least move to a new house. The demons and the elders are not stupid and they also have magical powers. Ever since Wyatt was born every demon wanted him for various reasons. If the demons believed Wyatt's magical family was not around to protect him they would have been coming out of the woodwork to get him and the charmed one's powers would have been revealed protecting him. The elders wanted to take Wyatt but Victor said no. The elders would have taken him anyway. Chris coming from the future was all about protecting Wyatt.  This is insulting to loyal fans. Since the day Wyatt was born all evil wanted him but in season 8 barely anything. Billy and her sister were an unnecessary addition. The season finale was pretty good. I will re-watch the first 7 seasons which were great but I will not be watching season 8. It was pretty bad and that's too bad because it was such a great show.",1403913600,,1241,4.419213973799127

2796719,2,B000OIOPHC,"I watched this series from seasons 1- middle of 6 in the original run and the remaining half of 6, and seasons 7 and 8 from the reruns on TNT and WeTV.

Season 8 was not the best.  It seemed like a spinoff, really, focusing on two characters that felt out of place, Billie and Christy Jenkins, who have nothing to do with the Warren line/Halliwells.  They should have been guests in the series, not major characters.  Only the season finale, which also was the series finale, was worthwhile for me in this season, mostly because of the excellent special effects.  The appearance of Billie and Christy warped the overall order of the story, so that after many years of watching Charmed, I could not believe that a so-called ""Ultimate Power"" would come from one of these two instead of the Halliwell sisters.  It felt like an afterthought.

Since this was the final season, please allow me to make this review:

It was in the first three seasons that Charmed shone.  Seasons 1-3 were faithful to the original concept of ""three sisters who happen to be witches.""  The family theme was very much intact.

Prue's character ended with Season 3, and in season 4 Paige was introduced as the new youngest sister to complete the trio.  I did learn to like Paige, and by the end of the series she had become one of my favorites; however what Prue brought to Charmed was a void that was never completely filled.  Prue was a solid and dependable presence in the lives of her sisters.  She was successful and confident, dutiful and very family-oriented.  Phoebe became successful and confident eventually, but she had so many personal issues that she struggled so much with duty to family.  Piper was able to cover for it, but unlike Prue she also had a life beyond taking care of her sisters.  Whereas in the beginning, Prue was very serious and more motherly than sisterly, come Seasons 2 and 3, she was progressing nicely toward a more ideal balance.  Hers was a character with great development.  Now that I think about it, what Prue embodied in one person (dutiful/family-oriented and successful/confident), Piper and Phoebe shared in making up for her loss.  Still it was a case of the whole of Prue being greater than the sum of the parts.  I guess many viewers would miss her several times throughout the series, just because this character was quite heroic.

Piper was the original selfish sister of the series when she was caught up in her love life, but she did take on the responsibility, achieving a measure of success, when her time had come to be the oldest sister.  This was a well-developed character that displayed a good range of emotions in dealing with themes of loss, fear, feelings of inadequacy, and finding courage, among others.  The actress playing this role was very good, in my opinion.  For example, when the story called for bitter and heart-wrenching, she was able to deliver convincingly, just as she knew how to be comical.

Paige was able to step successfully in the role of the youngest sister who made (sometimes humorous) mistakes and learned from them.  It always seemed like Phoebe was the ""sensual"" character in the series.  Even though Paige did not have as much of that, she had her own likable charm.  She messed up the power hierarchy from having some admittedly cool and useful abilities stemming from her nature as a half-whitelighter.  However, she became one of my favorite characters, because she was the least selfish of the sisters.  She was, all in all, dutiful towards a destiny and, more importantly, a family of which she had even only recently become part.  In her care for family, she actually rivaled Prue after all, but she did not enjoy the same authority over her sisters, being youngest.

Phoebe is the unfortunate one as far as growth is concerned.  She had the worst character development throughout the series. The good thing about her in the context of her character's life was her thriving career as a kind of local celebrity advice columnist and her ability to become financially independent.  In the context of the family dynamic, however, she had transformed from a lovable, beautiful, concerned, funny, unemployed girl in Seasons 1-3 into a self-centered, successful, rather shallow career woman beginning in season 4, who was at times willing to give up on family.  Her great love, Cole, who appeared in season 3, was a complex character, a half-human/half-demon whose dual nature constantly pulled him apart.  Phoebe did try but could not contend with this complexity and later just wrote him off as a case that could not be helped.  Cole was my favorite character for his depth, but if the writers meant to make him a basket case eventually anyway, they could have ended his stint much earlier, as his story with Phoebe went in circles later.  After the ordeal with Cole, Phoebe became more selfish and projected a semblance of independence, but in truth she always seemed to be looking for male validation, going through a slew of men who conveniently but also inconveniently and embarrassingly came from the workplace.  Paige had her share of men, too, but somehow Paige more often seemed to place her sisters above her men.  Phoebe became the ""successful"" sister after Prue left, but she did not have the same sense of duty to her family, which was supposed to be the overarching theme of Charmed.  She was the most emotionally distant from her family, when Charmed is really about drawing strength and capability from the family rather than from the self.

The quality of Charmed diminished some time towards the close of the fourth season.  The fifth season marked a new era in which appeared all sorts of zany magical creatures like leprechauns, a unicorn, titans, goddesses, and, in a later season, a Hogwarts-type magical school; these would have never fit in with the first three seasons.  Think back to the time Inspector Andy Trudeau detained Prue by the museum for taking a feather in the 1st season episode 'The Witch is Back.'  It will seem like a distant memory of a supernatural event occurring in a backdrop of the world of regular city folk.  I always loved that contrast.  Here in the 5th season, the sisters stopped being people who happened to know magic but still lived in the real world.  Charmed had become a sort of fairytale storybook at this point.

Season 7 featured the return of the importance of innocents, and it was good in that regard.  Some drama from the Wyatt/Chris (Piper's sons) story arc in season 6 also returned the drama after the childishness of season 5.  Some time towards the close of the 3rd season until the 7th and somewhat the 8th, as a fairly regular viewer of this series, it felt to me like there was a preferential treatment of Phoebe in most of Charmed.  She became ""the star"" of the show, and, while she was meant to be a focal character in the series after all, there really had been times when Phoebe's being a star felt overstated.

To me, the greatness of Charmed ended in the 3rd or the beginning of the 4th season, but it did remain watchable and maintained some good episodes for the length of time that the show was on air.  I believe this series will always be associated with some good memories of my childhood, something for which I am thankful.",1377129600,,7274,4.72107765451664

Some major things happened this season with Pheobe finally meeting her future love/father of her child/children. It was nice to see Paige also find love and watch her continue to grow as a whitelighter. My only real gripe was Brian Krause not being used wisely in few episodes that he was in during this season. (for example, Kill Billie part 2 and Forever Charmed) I not only love Piper and Leo together, but I love them with there kids.

So shocked that I felt compelled to write this review and warn others. Sure, watch the season if you're a completist (like me). I watched this when it originally aired on TV 6 years ago, and then one more time now, and I can honestly say that the next time I rewatch the series, I'm ending it on the season 7 finale, which is by far the more superior ender to the series.

There isn't a bad word to be said about Holly Marie Combs, who once again is the shining actress on the show who constantly performs, even with crappy scripts and ludicrous plot twists. It's ridiculous how quickly Billie chooses to turn on the sisters, after a season spent with them... same with the Leprechauns turning on them so quickly even though they've done good for them for about 3 seasons now. Bad writing all over. What an embarrassing season.",1332892800,,1003,4.421621621621622

I watched until episode 10, then skipped to the end. The middle is just crap.",1325548800,2,353,4.253731343283582

2796766,5,B000OIOPHC,"One of many great shows from the late 90s in my opinion. ""Early Edition"" and ""Charmed"" being two of my favourites. Shows combining everyday life and something supernatural, which I think is an awesome and very entertaining combination. That was a very popular trend in TV shows created between 1995 and 2000 (""Buffy"", ""Angel"" and ""Touched by an Angel"" are other examples of that kind of TV series). For those who don't know what this is all about, it follows three witch sisters living in San Fransisco. They have three different powers (bring time to a standstill, see the future and move objects using only the mind), but (almost) no one except them know they have these powers or know they are witches. They have to use these powers to deal with everything from demons to more regular stuff. You can probably imagine how entertaining it is. I also happen to find Holly Marie Combs and Alyssa Milano VERY HOT! Highly recommended. I have always just really liked the atmosphere in this show.",1310256000,,992,4.7398843930635834

2796769,3,B000OIOPHC,"While I love Charmed, Season 8 wasn't exactly a highlight of the show for me.

By the time Season 8 comes around, the Halliwell sisters have outright abandoned their identities and their magical role. As far as Piper, Phoebe and Paige are concerned, they've done their time policing the magical world and that hasn't changed, even as they come to realize that their old lives weren't all that bad and take back their identities. Enter Billie Jenkins, an overeager young witch who conveniently offers to handle the demons and give the sisters the ""me-time"" they wanted in exchange for tutoring. But when Billie finally recovers her long-lost sister, held captive by demons for fifteen years, events are set in motion that will

There are some good moments. I actually liked Paige's romance with parole officer Henry Mitchell, even if I think the show rushed it and didn't do much more than a surface job. An over-the-top obsessive magical suitor for Paige nonetheless cracked me up. Piper's competition with another pre-school mom in Desperate Housewitches was hilarious. I enjoyed the episode Vaya Con Leos and Wyatt's subsequent reaction. I did love seeing some beloved characters again--older Wyatt, older Chris, Grams, Patty, Victor, the Angel of Death, just to name a few. There are some fun call-backs to prior seasons.

I also had my quibbles. I was sad that Leo was cut out of a large chunk of the season. Whatever bad blood may have led to Shannon Doherty's separation from the show, surely everyone involved could have buried the hatchet enough to give a satisfactory acknowledgment to the role of Prue in the show. Many of the episodes or situations had been done before, even multiple times, so the lead actresses (and particularly the writers) often didn't seem as engaged as they might have been. Plot holes and inconsistencies with prior cannon were rampant. (Piper freezing Billie, time-travel shenanigans, Power of Three potions, etc.) The Phoebe-finding-love plot line was highly unsatisfactory. Coop never engaged me in the least as a character or potential love interest for Phoebe, and their interaction didn't have a smidgen of depth from what I could see. Not to mention that I was sick and tired of Phoebe going through guys right and left and was pretty exasperated when the show blamed that all on her Charmed responsibilities instead of acknowledging the considerable role her attitudes and behavior played. Maybe her marriage would have been meaningful to me if I'd been able to see Phoebe learning and growing beyond her old patterns and if her groom had been a more interesting character. And the less said about Phoebe's baby craze and the sisters' feelings of entitlement to whatever life they want, the better. Further, while it is understandable for the sisters to want out and the issue of selfishness and duty had potential and has been part of the show from the start, the 8th season really dropped the ball at the end. It never forced the sisters to, once-and-for all, face up to whether they're willing to make peace with their legacy and the sacrifices and hardships it imposes or whether they're going to continue to neglect their responsibilities and pawn them off on others and reap the results of that approach. I was very much disturbed by the coldness of the sisters in their later dealings with Billie and Christy; whether the Halliwell sisters like it or not, Billie and Christy are human and you'd think the ""good guys"" wouldn't be quite so gung ho about killing them when they know Billie is deluded and Christy has been manipulated and brainwashed by demons for years. Most of all, the Billie and Christy stuff grated on my nerves. Ultimate Power my foot; I was tempted to excuse vanquishing them just on the grounds that that much credulity and naivete combined with magic is just a nuclear disaster waiting to happen. If you can stomach the idea that a pair of vacuous, foolish novice witches can go up against the Charmed Ones and win to begin with, of course. (After some reflection, I've concluded that Billie may not be as dumb as I initially considered her, but that doesn't necessarily mean she uses the brains she was born with.) The characters were flat; Christie less so, but still utterly shallow in the end, and the conflict between the Jenkins sisters and the Halliwell sisters was (literally) utterly contrived and senseless.

Still, there's a reason this show survived this long. I just wished its final season had been more satisfying.",1275264000,4,4502,4.904199475065616

There has been and always will be something amazing about this show that just draws me in, no matter what the plot. I'm aware that the acting is not the stuff of Academy Awards, and I just don't care. There is just something so special and endearing about this show that I consider it a part of my life.

That being said, I have to comment that The Final Season (sob!) of Charmed is worth the purchase for the special features, alone. They are all excellent, but I especially loved ""To The Manor Born"" -- ""a behind -the-scenes look at the central role the Holliwell manor played in the series."" Looks like my fantasy of living in the Charmed house will have to remain a fantasy, since it actually had no roof!

If you're a Charmed fan, these twenty-two episodes will make you very, very happy. It's just too bad that it's the end of the series.",1266969600,,957,4.370786516853933
2796773,5,B000OIOPHC,"I'm still waiting for my new copy of the final season to be delivered, but I can say after watching the whole series several times, it's another one of those shows that's like a favorite book - you can't read it just once.  I was sorry to see when Shannon Douerty Quit after the 3rd season, but Rose McGowan did a darned good job of making up for our loss.  Holly Marie Combs & Alyssa Milana (Meelano) are great actors & do a super job, not to mention Brian Krause (sp).  My sister & her fanily have the series as well, & I hear my nieces talking about it's greatness when I happen to call & their in the middle of watching one of their Charmed disks...talk about excitement!!!  :-D

  Instead they threw together and it really looked it a series full of recycled stories, plot holes and  a few celebraties.  It ignores so many of the rules and cations  writen carefully into other seasons  until it made an absolute hash of what was a great seris instead dragging it slowly through alot of stupid Sh-t until it was too painful to watch.

While I understand the writers wanting to move the sisters into more of an advisory role to new witches and whitelighters after years of kicking demon butt themselves, the addition of the whining Billie and her snarky sister definitely jumped the shark for me.  Boring and repetitive, the writers seemed to forget the history of their own show. For example, in previous seasons they drum into our heads that Wyatt, the heir of Excalibur, is the ""ultimate power"" and then suddenly they declare that Billie is.  What???  Not to mention the ""give her the benefit of the doubt"" treatment of Christie, even though the Charmed Ones knew that firestarters are trained from a young age to be bodyguards for the Source (Season 4 ""Lost and Bound"".)  Knowing that Christie was in the hands of evil for over ten years, it made no sense at all that the sisters would ignor her until things got critical.

2796801,1,B000OIOPHC,"I've been a fan of Charmed since I began watching it mid-season two, and faithfully followed the show...that is until mid-season five. I still consider myself a huge fan, but for me the show really ended when Shannen Doherty departed. Yes I am a HUGE Shannen Doherty fan but her leaving wasn't the only reason I stopped watching this show. Yes that was part of it, because I never stopped missing Prue, and her absence was always noticeable in the episodes, but I did actually enjoy season four, and even warmed up to Rose Mcgowans character ""Paige"" I was quite happy that they chose to make a new sister instead of just choosing a new actress to play Prue. And the season four episodes were actually quite good and well done.

But then in season 5 they just started getting extremely lame and I stopped watching the show. Every once in a while I would tune in to an episode just out of curiousity, if only to see what the Halliwells were up to, but every episode was a disappointment.

Which brings me to this season...season 8. I've probably seen a total of 2 episodes from this season, so it may seem unfair of me to be reviewing it...but seriously, this is Charmed at its worst. Just from seeing a few episodes, it felt as if it was an entirely different show.

I didn't follow this season while it was still airing, but did decide to tune into the series finale, and was HUGELY disappointed. Granted, I obviously knew that there was no chance of Shannen Doherty making a guest appearance, but I still feel that they could have given more of a tribute to her character Prue. Its true that it may seem that Paige was a bigger part of the show, seeing as how Rose Mcgowan was part of the show for 5 seasons, while Shannen was only on for 3 seasons, but still. Prue was part of the orginal power of 3, so I feel her character should have been given more credit.

And aside from that, the series finale just wasn't good. I've imagined a million different ways that the show could have ended, and each idea was way better than what the actual result was.

If you've never seen this show, please do not base your opinion on this season, or any of the later seasons, as I feel that they don't do the show justice. Atleast start with season one, and go from there.

I'd only advise you to buy this season if you are a die-hard Charmed fan, and feel the need to have the entire series on DVD.

As for me, I will settle for having the first four seasons on DVD, and to occassionally tuning into the re-runs of the later seasons on TNT.",1214438400,5,2529,4.334038054968287

From the time when Prue was alive and the discovery of their long lost sister Paige, Charmed was the most entertaining show ever being produced. With their slapstick dialouges, special effects and great fashion statement, its no wonder it survived for 8 years. Its a feat.

Well, Season 8 is the closing season ever for the series and the story was all well-written and great twist to the story line. Who could have expect that they will be battling one of their own during the climax episode. Overall, Charmed deserved a spot in my own ""WALK-OF-FAME""

We endured lots of howlingly bad acting and serious fashion misstatements - but we stuck with it, figuring that 7 seasons worth of time and $$ shouldn't be wasted.  We bought season 8 and anxiously finished up the other series we were watching (season 5 of Stargate).  We watched the first episode and my husband, 14-year old daughter and I all just looked at each other and said ""Can it really be this bad?  Are we missing something here?""  The answers were, unfortunately, yes to the first question and no to the second question.

Okay, we figured, let's try episode 2.  Mistake.  We couldn't even get through it - cleaning the catbox and taking vitamins were a better use of our time.  Okay, okay - there actually was value for our entertainment dollar - we were highly entertained commenting on their atrocious outfits.

It was fun searching for them. Here they are...On the Season 8; Disc 6 DVD there are three easter eggs. #1: On the Main Menu, from the words 'Bonus Features' hit the down arrow, there should appear a purple triquatra on Phoebe's arm. Press play. #2: In the Episode Selection section, from the words 'Main Menu' hit the left button, there should appear a purple triquatra on Phoebe's arm. Press Play. #3: In the Bonus Features section, from the words 'Main Menu', hit the left button, there should appear a purple triquatra on Billie's wrist. Press Play.

I did like the way the story wrapped up at the end. I did not get to watch this show when it originally aired on T.V. (long story). So I was only, finally, able to get caught up when I sat down this week and watched the DVDs. By the end, I was bawling like a baby. There are lots of things I hated about season 8, but after listening to the commentaries on the episodes that had them, some of the things I hated made sense.

I don't ever think we will have more shows like Buffy and Charmed, with strong positive female roles models, that aren't cookie cutter-cheerleader-straightlaced-tight wad robots. And that is what made these shows good. Even though the Sisters wanted a regular life, it was always on their terms, not on the terms or ideals of what someone else thought was right. And they were always willing to fight for who and what they loved. I don't see anything on T.V. currently filling that void, for all the females out there. (and don't say Desperate Housewives, yuck, suburbia). The Sisters were strong in spirit and body. They were also just odd enough, that those of us out here who are just a little odd could relate. That is a big part of what made this show a huge success, (same with Buffy), the oddballs felt like maybe they had someone to relate to finally. And those of us that believe in alternative faiths had a show that had some references to them.

But the thing that saddens me the most, is that the talks of spin-offs didn't go anywhere. It would have been wonderful to see Drew Fuller and Wes Ramsey do a spin-off that showed the boys taking over the fight. These two finally got to interact in a positive way in that last episode and looked like they would have made a great pair for their own show. That would have at least kept some part of the Charmed Ones around for a while longer.

Oh Well, maybe some day in the future there will be movies or something to ease the pain of losing friends that feel almost like sisters.

Leo's loss made me sad and the death of the sisters, even though they had died before it could have been final this time, made me wonder what was going to happen next.

The Charmed magazine give's more detail on the show.  If the fans' are as important as the producers, directors, paramount, whoever....say, then what's the deal?

I was happy that they finally decided to include some special features, but EXTREMELY upset to find the theme song changed and Kaley Cucuo located in front of Brian Krause in the line up, what a disservice to the fans and to him for his years of very hard work and dedication to the show. I feel like season 8 was a kick in the teeth to everyone envolved. They should have had more notice that they were coming back instead of having to re-write a beginning only to have the show ripped from under them a second time ( I know their contracts were up, but still I don't agree). I thought it risky to replace Shannon when she left, but Rose came in and filled the void. I thought Billie was given to high a rank in the beginning, especially considering how small her role was in the first few episodes, and she wasn't really meant to fill a void just there to fulfill Studio Execs. pockets with cash. I would rather have had them take the extra money she cost and put it into more episodes with Leo. I'm not by any means saying Kaley wasn't a great asset to the show, I just think it was too late in the run to add her as an important character. Also, in the commentary they metioned on the first episode that they were trying to confuse the audience into thinking she could be a threat, but yet they placed her into the main title before Brian, obviously she wasn't a threat (at that point anyway), because Cole has been the only other so-called bad guy to be placed in the main title.",1190073600,3,1672,4.687074829931973

2796860,3,B000OIOPHC,"Bringing on a new character that takes on a major role... and suddenly becomes an equal to the main characters is tricky. I felt that the level of betrayal portrayed by Billie's character was unforgivable. I also felt that her character added way too much tension to the table. To bring on a character like that and leave fans unable to escape the drama she caused? There were very few scenes devoted to the sisters. I felt like the developers were trying to say once you're old you can't keep up or something. Are you serious??

I was also disappointed to see Cole disappear. I liked the passion that Pheobie and Cole shared. I didn't get the same satisfaction from Cupe. That resolution was okay.. but not fabulous.

I did enjoy the family history-- seeing all the generations together. It did seem like a last minute sloppy mess where the directors didn't have enough time to wrap everything up. I think they should have gotten rid of Billie and Christy eons ago and moved on with the plot involving the charmed ones.

They should have left the theme song for which it was highly a point of the show, that is what the Halliwell sisters were looking for, I am human and, I need to be loved just like everybody else. To put in a new theme as the final season made no sense at all. Also, it is to bad Shannen Dohery (Prudence) could not have come back to help wrap up things with her sisters, this would have given all of us avid, loyal fans who have watched the show since day one a sense of real closure, this would have made a little more sense then bringing on a total new character. I am not saying the character of Bille was not good, for in the end that is how the sisters were able to lead normal lives and live happily ever after. I, too wish the show would have gone on, but all good things must come to an end. They did a fine job, and went out still on top, which is the way to go. My only hope is one day we can have a Charmed family reunion show, that would be great for the fans. In magic anything is possible right? Again, buyers should have been warned the theme song they were used to hearing would no longer be there.

And hearing that song, chopped up though it was....it is actually a H&(( of a lot better as the show's theme song than the song they chose for the frickin' dvd edition !!

I just wish they would have told fans ahead of time about this change so we can put our feedback in, and know we're buying a new theme song so we can adjust ahead of time for crying out loud.

This is my first view, and yes I will watch the show,but because I hate skipping the music, I just might put up with it.....I will talk about the the bonusses and so forth in another post.",1189555200,3,951,4.361581920903955
2796874,2,B000OIOPHC,"I have been a big fan of ""Charmed"" for years. I especially loved the first four seasons. However, I felt the show went downhill a bit, particularly after season six. Season seven was a decent season, especially with Charisma Carpenter guest-starring. But season eight?? Completely unnecessary!

Season eight introduces Billie Jenkins, a blonde, young witch who the Charmed Ones take under their wing. I liked Billie a bit but when her sister, Christy was introduced, my hatred for both of them soared. Why would some long-lost sister be able to persuade Billie to kill the Charmed Ones? Unless Billie is some gullable twit with no mind of her own, which she was.

Anyway, season eight had no real direction except bringing Leo back after defeating the Ultimate Power (Brian Krause was cut for financial reasons). That's another thing. Are we, the audience, really supposed to believe some new witch (Billie) is the Ultimate Power? Highly unlikely.

The series finale was the only saving grace. It felt rushed but was still 'good.' Actually, I only liked the ending. Billie crying was not something I wanted to see.

Overall, a useless season of ""Charmed."" The only reason I gave it two stars was because of the series finale. Unless you're a die-hard fan who wants to complete his/her collection, I'd skip this final chapter of the Power of Three.",1189468800,4,1347,4.920704845814978

There characters were so well portrayed by the actresses (Holly Marie Combs, Rose McGowan and Alyssa Milano) that they made the characters their own, gave them identifiable funny quirks and great personalities.

The eight season does not disappoint. With the addition of a new character.

Now they must deal with the guilt of not fighting s well as with the responsibility of training a new witch, Billie (played by Kaley Cuoco), who is also Paige's new charge. The season progresses as the Charmed ones reveal they are alive, deal with the repercussions of faking their deaths and settle their personal and work lives.

Although I don't think that the ""Ultimate Power"" was very convincing (they did fight the source of all evil!!!! how can 2 girls and an already defeated Triad win over them?!), the plot was pretty well developed.

The character of Billie is very interesting. She may be a combination of many characters all rolled into one. She shares Prue's power of telekinesis (and possibly a variation of Prue's astral projection), and Wyatt's power of projection. She is pretty powerful indeed. Yet, she is a bit gullible and believed her sister Christy when she accused the Charmed ones. Still, her character was a good and fun addition to the show.

It was a good time to end Charmed, they had explored every avenue, every storyline and destroyed thousands of demons; honestly, they have done it all.",1187913600,5,1830,5.278350515463917

I agree with what everyone has said so far, highly disappointing but at least it didn't leave us up in the air like the ending of season 7, the first series ending.  I was happy to see that they showed the sisters having the lives they always wanted and that they were all happy.  However, the whole Billie and Christy thing was just insanity.  Not worth it.  They could have done so much more.  Will I buy it?  Probably for my husband just to make him happy.  Will I watch it?  NO!

2796889,5,B000OIOPHC,"I always feel, when it comes to watching ""Charmed: Season 8"", that I am watching something I shouldn't be. What with the drama and finality of the Season Finale of Season 7, and then the rumours that were spun in the summer of 2005 (that ""Charmed"" could very possibly NOT be returning for an eighth season), it really seemed like that was going to be it - the sisters had defeated one of their deadliest enemies, fled The Manor and relinquished their lives as Halliwells and The Charmed Ones. They had faked their deaths, left it to the next generation and disappeared off, in disguise, with Leo. Daryl's reaction to this appeared to be a satisfied one, and Prue's ghost - it is believed - had shut The Manor door one last time (an apt end to the series).
This, however neatly tied up, just didn't seem right though. Of all the endings, renouncing their heritage and giving up on life as they knew it was just not satisfying enough. When I watched the finale to Season 7, although it was not confirmed that the show would continue, something inside me knew that it would. The feel that episode left the viewer with was an uneasy one...like this was not the end, regardless of what the network was saying. It never really felt that ""Charmed"" was to conclude like that.

And indeed, it didn't. As Season 8 opens in ""Still Charmed And Kicking"" you feel almost honoured that you are allowed to see what happens next, after the threat that The Halliwells would not return as The Charmed Ones again. The viewer gets to see HOW the characters get out of the mess that they seem to have created for themselves.

Season 8 is not the best of seasons, but it is yet another superb one. It begins by revealing The Halliwells are back in The Manor, living with their father Victor. Only they are posing, in magical disguise, as The Bennetts, pretending that they are three cousins and that Victor is in fact their uncle.
The opening episodes of Season 8 hold a nostalgia that reminded me of Season 1 - the music and themes of it. ""Charmed"" has always had an underlying tragic feel to it, with the constant loss and sacrifice the sisters have had to experience over the years, both before and after they were witches; and a season that opens at the funerals of the three principle characters dwells on this further. Although we know that they are not really dead, there is a morbid feel to it - a morbid fascination nonetheless.

Season 8 carries the ""faked death"" theme throughout the first few episodes, not simply throwing the plotline away. And to great effect too. Their reasons for returning to their old lives are believable and well-planned, as is the way in which they eventually reveal to the world that they are still alive (the excuse that they have been working for the government). The best part of it is that they return to being Halliwells, allowing us to feel satisfied that ""Charmed"" will not end with the sisters forsaking their legacy.

This season introduces the character of Billie who seems unnecessary at first. She does, however, grow on the viewer and becomes integral to the outline of the season. Her story progresses into a great one and her character is worthy of the magnitude it markets. She is essential to the final battle that the girls have to face, as is her sister, Christie, who is forever shrouded in intrigue.

I shan't divulge exactly what happens, though shall reveal that Season 8 contains plots that involves Paige and marriage, the brief return of The Source and ANOTHER separation of Piper and Leo (probably the most tantalising of the entire series).

The finale of the season is spectacular! The battle The Halliwells have to face is superb, incorporating an assortment of various different elements from plotlines-past, such as The Hollow and The Triad. These are not used repetitively though, only to highlight the weight of this ultimate fight.
The explosion in the basement of The Halliwells' home, which occurs in the Season 7 finale, seems minuscule in comparison to the event that takes place in the penultimate episode: The Manor actually totally blows up! This occurrence is literally phenomenal.
""Charmed: Season 8"" is a terrific final season. There are, indeed, ""silly"" episodes, such as ""Mr. and Mrs. Witch"" and ""Battle Of The Hexes""; and why the writers insisted on throwing a leprechaun-related episode into every season since Season 5 is beyond me!
The title track that plays to the opening credits has also been inexplicably altered, which may displease fans (although it does grow on you actually). I was also irritated that, although discussed, Prue was not given nearly enough acknowledgment as the series she helped found came to a close. But aside from these minor flaws, Season 8 charts a perfect end to a show that risked throwing in the towel when one of its leads left the series at the end of Season 3. Not only did ""Charmed"" survive the death of Prue and the introduction of Paige, it endured the uncertain finish to Season 7, only to pave the way for a touching, enjoyable and rewarding end to the show. ""Forever Charmed"", the final episode, is the perfect mix of action, nostalgia, characters old and new and, most importantly, it renews our faith that The Halliwells will continue their birthright on into the future.

Highlighted by DVD extras (including an exciting look at the original unaired Pilot which didn't feature Alyssa Milano as Phoebe) this season is outstanding. From the gratifying turn of events of ""Forever Charmed"", to the glimpse into the future at the very end (something which is much more satisfying to see than The Charmed Ones faking their deaths) to the inspired last-ever closing of The Manor door - Season 8 is quite simply the perfect end to this radiant series.",1183507200,32,5755,4.731804586241276

I loved the fact that new characters were introduced and new ideas. I thoughly enjoyed it.  Yes, it was sad to see that there was no photo of Prue.  No one will ever know the real reason for that, but it's ok.  This season was a perfect ending to a great series.",1182988800,3,436,3.909090909090909
2796902,4,B000OIOPHC,"Having watched this show from the very first episode, I was very disappointed in the final season. I know I am repeating everyone else, but having to watch Billie and Kristy just made me not want to watch my favorite show. The ""ultimate power""? I thought that the ""Power of Three"" was the ultimate power - not 2 teenage blondes. Budget cuts ousted Darryl and Leo from the show, but they found money to pay these 2 girls (not to mention FBI agent whatever his name was, the Triade and Dumain). The fans did not need Billie to draw them to the show the same way they used Chris in season 6. Was this done to keep younger people interested in the show as the 3 sisters were aging themselves? OK, so maybe they were going for the possible spin-off idea with a show about Billie. But still.....the whole 8th season? All the fans ever wanted was the 3 sisters. Billie could have been added at the start to get the sisters back into their destiny after the end of season 7. But the whole season did not have to be devoted to these 2 new sisters.  The best part about season 8 was the final show - showing the lives of Piper, Phoebe and Paige going on. That was done rather nicely. I never was a fan of Prue as so many were BUT I did feel that on that wall of pictures there should have been that one photo of the original 3 sisters that Grams took in the yard that magicaly pushed the sisters together. Buying this boxed set means I will have all 8 of them. I am buying this set for that reason. Other than that I would not purchase this season as I have the last 2 episodes already recorded on a DVD. My ranking of the seasons is: 4,5,6,2,1,7,3 and then 8.",1182902400,7,1650,4.172413793103448
2796903,4,B000OIOPHC,"When I first saw the series finale, I was most moved by Billie's grief over her lost sister.  Billie's final scene, so I had thought, was when the spotlight focused on her alone, on her knees wailing in extreme grief.

The thought occurred to me: Was there ever a reconciliation between her and the sisters thereafter?

I had to watch the series finale three times on TNT before I got my answer.  And the answer was -- YES.  Billie was shown briefly in the final scene with Phoebe's voiceover reminisces, helping to take care of the growing brood of kids.

In a Charmed episode which must remain to our imaginations since it will never be written (save in a future novel?), I can vividly imagine the poignancy of the reconciliation and forgiveness that had to have occurred so that Billie could be included into the final scene.

It was a MARVELOUS ending to an overall great series.  So much to be left to our imaginations!

As a number of other correspondents have noted, it's regrettable that Prue (Shanon Doherty) could not have participated in the series finale, not even as a photograph on the wall.  One wonders why.  Did Aaron Spelling ever even contact her to raise the possibility?  If so, did she decline, and if so, why?

Well, that's show biz!

2796904,3,B000OIOPHC,"Worse season of Charmed and even more tragic since it was the last season and it all comes down to two people Billie and Christy. I don't care about them I don't want to care about them I have not spent seven years watching Charmed to watch sisters who were not the Halliwells. I hated every moment that was filled with Billie and Christy and not Piper, Phoebe and Paige. I hated all of the time it took away from Piper, Phoebe and Paige's storylines.
I liked the sisters trying to lead normal lives with the world thinking they were died. There were a couple very interesting stories from Paige's difficulty to find a life outside magic or Piper's new look being exactly like a woman wanted for murder. I also liked how they came to decide to take their lives back it was very good.
I didn't like the enemy being the Tirade which we all know Cole vanquished in season three. Did they really expect us to believe there just happened to be another tirade out there? There was no way I was going to believe that.
I also found it Phoebe's marriage to Coop and Paige's to Henry to be too forced. I didn't feel any of the love or chemistry that I did when Piper married Leo. Neither men were particularly interesting or had much of a personality.
I liked the seeing Grams again this season and Patty, Chris and almost the entire Hallwell family in Forever Charmed.  I also liked  when we got to see the sisters going on with their lives, their children, Old Piper and Old Leo and their granddaughter. It was very nice to see how their lives turned out and I liked how they showed it to use with each sister writing the Book of Shadows and narriating their lives. The pictures on the walls replaced with all new family pictures. It was very good and touching.",1182384000,10,1753,4.374233128834356

But me personally I think Charmed ended after Season Four, because from Seasons 5-8 you could obviously tell that the budget for the show was highly decreased as all demons looked human, the writing grew steadily worst and worst as many episodes seemed to contradict previous episodes/seasons and I attribute that to the departure of Constance M. Burge the creator of this universe. My problem with Season Eight is if the Charmed Ones are suppose to be so powerful how in the world are these witches their match? Also this is suppose to be the LAST AND FINAL season and all Prue gets is a casual mention? I mean there are plenty of ways to truly honor her character without Shannen Doherty to have actually appeared. And I just really miss the old Power of Three moments that the show really lost after a while. But yeah if you want all the seasons of Charmed then sure get this season, this Season isn't as bad as the AWFUL Season Six.",1182124800,11,1072,4.41919191919192

To see the Power of Three mature (in so many ways) over the years was a TV series feat.  I always felt Leo (Brian Krause) wasn't given the recognition he deserved until much later in the series, and enjoyed his journey of ""enlightenment"" from Whitelighter to Elder to Avatar and full circle back to mortal; only to be lost and brought back to Piper yet again in Season 8.  Although bringing in Kristie and Billie Jenkins took some getting used to, it served a purpose in creating something other than the usual Underworld against Charmed type of armegeddon.  Bringing us to a form of closure by showing us how Leo, Piper (Holly Marie Combs), Phoebe (Alyssa Milano), and Paige (Rose McGowan) finally have a ""normal"" life with everything they had dreamed was filled with all the emotion of losing loved ones.  The ""picture wall"" was a great thought, and it truly was a shame that Prue's (Shannon Doherty) picture wasn't among those characters we had grown to care and with whom we shared so much for all eight seasons.",1181692800,5,1182,4.663461538461538

I also really missed Darrel and the regulars we all got used to seeing.  Getting rid of Leo for a time was irritating too.  However, the season ending was really cool.

It had the heart-tugging moments (i.e. Vaya Con Leos) and it also had the fun light-hearted moments (i.e. Desperate Housewitches).  Each of the main three women brought their A-game to the final season of this series.  Adding in Billie also made it nice because it reflected back to when the series began and the girls were learning about their powers.  Also, the build up to the final showdown was a great progression through out the series.  Highlights in this season are Piper and Leo saying bye to each other in 'Vaya Con Leos,' Paige and Henry's relationship, Phoebe meeting Coop, Phoebe saying goodbye to Piper when she moves out of the manor and into her own place, and the big showdown between the Charmed Ones and Billie and Christie.

The biggest reward to the fans of Charmed has to be the final minutes of the series finale where each of the main girls reflects on their lives and we pass a wall of pictures of the Halliwell family, and with the final shutting of the door we end on what was a great 8 year ride.",1180828800,11,1125,4.458536585365854

""Kill Billie Vol. 1""

""Forever Charmed""
After the death of their respective sisters, Piper and Billie go their separate ways, both determined to get their families back together.

  What an excellent season to close out the series. The series finale was absolutely incredible, especially the ending, with the sisters writing down everything they had experienced in the last eight years (eight years for Piper and Phoebe, five years for Paige), where it then shows an elderly Piper reading their legacy to her young granddaughter, who is named PRUDENCE (after Prue). As an elderly Piper and an elderly Leo ascend the long staircase in the old Halliwell Manor, they pass many photographs taken of the Halliwell family, including Penny Halliwell (good ole Grams), Patty Halliwell, Paige, Leo, Piper, Phoebe, Wyatt, & Chris. This show was, in so many ways, very amazing, and I still find myself heartbroken that it is now all over.

After Prue was killed off, I was sure that the show wouldn't work and it would go downhill. It took me awhile to warm up to Rose McGowan as a new ""Charmed One"", but once I did, I realized the show was better than ever. It wasn't just scary, but funny too. It showed the humanity in the sisters as they forged their sisterly bond. Also, I know that budget cuts supposedly made them cut out a lot of special effects. I think the fact that the later seasons demons looked more human than before made it even more spookier because you couldn't tell the good guys from the bad guys anymore. It was more realistic. My kids said so anyway. Loved the plotline with Cole, was so sorry to see him go. I also thought that Prue would've appeared as a ghost throughout the series once in a while to counsel the sisters, but I guess since she was fired from the series she wasn't willing to come back or they weren't willing to bring her back. I enjoyed the episodes when they brought back Grams or Mom for whatever reason, or time traveled. It's what made their being witches being cool. I would have liked seeing more of what their futures would be like, but with the series ending I guess we will never know. I thought the whole Billie/Kristy/Triad thing dragged on a bit, and I missed Leo.  I did like the ending and knowing that all three sisters are happily married and having children with powers etc. It would've been nice to have shown pictures of all the characters who have been in the ""family"" as they went up the stairs. They could've shown pictures of Prue, (she was their sister after all), Paige and her family, Phoebe and her family, Grams, and the parents, etc. That way everyone could've been seen one last time as the series ended.

2796919,5,B000OIOPHC,"I give this season 5 starts.  It was superb from beginning to end.  I do feel that a few mistakes were made.  First of all, budget cuts that resulted in less use of the sister's magical powers.  I would have loved to have seen Phoebe get all her active powers back (I guess you just have to assume she does).  The second victim of budget cuts was Brian Krause (who was axed from episodes 11-20); this was a huge mistake.  My third gripe: the Triad/Kristy/Billie thing.  I do like that Billie and Kristy were the big bad (and that the Triad plucked Kristy so they could turn them to their side).  Why did the Triad look different in season eight (more human) than in season three?  Was there not enough in the budget for the make-up?  Also, Paige's wedding was totally overlooked.  If they were going to resurrect Sam at all, it should have been in that episode.

Having said all that, the writing this season was top-notch.  The sisterly bond was tested as Phoebe and Paige moved out of the Manor (again).  Piper struggled as a single parent.  Each sister struggled with their careers.  I feel that Alyssa, Holly Marie, and Rose performed above and beyond in this final season.  The character of Billie was often a tad annoying, and entirely too much screen time was given to her whining.  I do wish they had shown more of the relationship between Paige and Henry.",1175904000,13,1364,4.497959183673469
2796920,5,B000OIOPHC,"I have been a Charmed fan since the show premiered in 1998, faithfully watching every episode.  Being a fan of Shannen Doherty, Holly Marie Combs & Alyssa Milano,I felt that the show was destined to be a hit.

In 2001, I was rather disappointed when Shannen left and felt that the show should be cancelled. It took me a little time to warm up to Paige played by Rose McGowan.  As time progressed, I realized that her character was not a replacement for Prue, and I was able to accept her.  Rose proved to be a great asset to the show in her own right.

In the Season Finale, I was rather disappointed that Shannen was not brought back for a cameo appearance, or even shown in a picture. I know that there were legal issues, but it would have made many faithful viewers very happy.

The Finale was done superbly.  The jumping back and forth made me a little dizzy, but it all made sense and tied up any loose ends.  The last five minutes of the show was excellent.  I think everyone was glad to see that Leo and Piper finally ended up happily married. It was also great to see that both Paige and Phoebe had achieved happiness.

This was one of the best Finale episodes that I've seen in ages.  It reminded me a little of the Six Feet Under finale.  It was also great to see Grams (Penny), Patty, Victor, Wyatt & Chris, all together again for one last family reunion.

8185191,5,B000OIOPHC,"All good things eventually come to an end. After 8 years--and numerous ultimate evils and final battles--the last one finally arrived for Charmed. Of course--after Season 7's finale--an explanation for the Charmed Ones sudden reappearance had to be explained. Magical new identities to cover up their own faked deaths, until a helpful FBI agent helps them come out of hiding--so to speak.

The arrival of a new character in Billie (Kaley Cuoco) makes for an interesting plot-twist, as we find out she has a long lost sister, which leads to the arrival of the latest threat--the reborn Triad, who are ""evil incarnate"" and can never die. It all ties into the latest great threat and new power which leads to the ultimate battle which sends the show out.

It's tough to debate whether the show loses anything in its final season--as most tv series tend to do--but Charmed remained solid until the end. I don't think ""jump the shark"" would apply here, if anyone still says that.",1510099200,,974,4.826347305389222
