7848919,5,6303501206,"Wonderful movie - too bad it was never made officially into a DVD or in a ""widescreen"" format! I actually found the politics behind the scenes to be well done and fascinating, which I normally don't care for - in this case, however, the scenes were balanced well between all of the various factions trying to ""cover their asses"" with B/S, excuses, and lies. I would've liked to have seen more of the Exxon Valdez's story herself - her launching, her career to that point in time, and a little more of Hazelwood, her captain. Some underwater scenes of her resting on Bligh Reef underwater would've really made the move also - I understood from some accounts that divers did get some underwater footage in an attempt to better understand the damage and the exact position of the ships hull on the reef. All-in-all, however, it was a great film - my opinion! ""Rare DVDs.biz"" will get you into a decent DVD copy of the original VHS tape in its entirety! Get the ""8.5 dual-layer"" version for best copy results. A wee bit pricey, but well worth it in my opinion!",1500163200,,1056,4.534031413612565
