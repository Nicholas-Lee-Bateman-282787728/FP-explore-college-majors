1741612,5,B00006CXHZ,"Rainbow Randolph (Robin Williams), the corrupt, costumed star of a popular children's TV show, is fired over a bribery scandal and replaced by squeaky-clean Smoochy (Edward Norton), a puffy fuscia rhinoceros. As Smoochy catapults to fame - scoring hit ratings and the affections of a jaded network executive (Catherine Keener) - Randolph makes the unsuspecting rhino the target of his numerous outrageous attempts to exact revenge and reclaim his status as America's sweetheart.",1014422400,24,478,5.561643835616438
1741613,5,B00006CXHZ,"I gave this two viewings during its theatrical run. This is a black humor film that alienated most of its audience. It looks at the dark side of both the human ego and fame under incredible scrutiny and desperation. Rainbow Randolph is a foul-mouthed, washed-up children's television icon whose greed kicked him to the curb after an FBI sting exposes a bribery ring where he was caught taking money from parents who wanted their kiddo's to be on his show. Robin Williams is brilliant in his portrayal of the tragic and desperate Randolph. Not every character clicks, but the characters that do, overshadow the ones who don't seem to have a point or purpose in being there.",1504310400,,672,4.752136752136752

It's not a movie about a kid show, it's a kid show about a movie about a kid show, but for adults reminiscing about kid show through the filter of adult cynicism. Like Miracle on 47th, It's A Wonderful Life, etc., this is Xmas miracle story about the victory of sentiment over cynicism. Edward Norton and Robin Williams have rarely been better.

When I was younger, I only saw him in roles where he was of a child appropriate humor, so I loved the turn I saw in this. The dark humor was amazing to me. Edward Norton was great with his ""I'm going to change the world"" character. I think it was truly predicting the future with the new food trends.",1428796800,,386,4.22972972972973

1741761,5,B00006CXHZ,"I absolutely adore this film.  It's a massive, dark, sparkling comedic masterpiece.  I loved it from the day it hit the theaters and I've loved it more with each subsequent viewing.

It got terrible, short-sighted, reviews when it was  first released.  Roger Ebert gave this film half a star when it came out. He said, ""Only enormously talented people could have made Death to Smoochy. Those with lesser gifts would have lacked the nerve to make a film so bad, so miscalculated, so lacking any connection with any possible audience. To make a film this awful, you have to have enormous ambition and confidence, and dream big dreams.""  As with many things made by brilliant, forward-thinking people, it's taken well over 10 years for society to grow into this film.  Watch it and you'll see what I mean.  It fits perfectly into now, but shewn too bright for its own time.  Thank goodness it's still around.",1424131200,,905,4.75
1741762,5,B00006CXHZ,"Undoubted a classic masterpiece! I had always felt this film deserves more respect than I have seen it given.

Terrific comedy! This is one of those films that contains an endless amount of replay value. I have seen it several times and I am very proud to have it.

Favorite scene's: The phone call Rainbow Randolf makes to Smoochy! (You better grow eyes in the back of your head you horned piece of s*** cause I'm not gonna sleep till worms are crawling up your foam rubber ass. I'm 'goin on safari MOTHERF***ER, SAFAAAAAARRRRRRI!!!!) yea, a scene I have memorized from watching several times and sharing with many friends. LMMFAO!

1741763,2,B00006CXHZ,"Quick story recap: Kids Television star, Rainbow,  is busted in a sting operation and fired. A new star, Smoochy, is hired and tries to stop the corruption among his own corporation while the former star stalks him.  Maybe I just didn't feel like laughing tonight but I didn't laugh too much during this movie which is supposed to be a dark comedy.

The idea behind the movie is funny, but I think this movie is like those jokes that are funny in your head but when said out loud - fall flat.  I won't deny there were funny moments, especially some of the things that come out of Robin Williams mouth. I'm sure Robin got to adlib most of that but he delivered on it. But overall,  unimpressive.

As far as acting though everyone plays it over the top. I guess you have to when you are selling a farce comedy.  I'd say Edward Norton and his opposite Catherine Kenner did the best acting.  Probably not going to be something I need to watch again, glad I only rented it.",1420243200,,968,4.338888888888889

1741863,5,B00006CXHZ,"I saw Death to Smoochy when it was released in movie theatres. I had seen the trailer on TV, and it looked so oddball, out of the ordinary, with a nice cast, directed by Danny DeVito, I decided I had to see it. I wasn't missing this. When I saw it, the theatre didn't have many people in it. I went with a friend, who was somewhat interested in seeing the movie, he didn't mind the cast, and when he heard I was going, he didn't argue, he figured he'd give it a shot, and we went to see the movie.

The first few minutes of the movie, I was a bit worried, with Rainbow Randolph dancing around on the kiddie show... That didn't last too long, until the comedy picked up, and the tone changed. We had a great time, from start to finish.

The basic plot is Rainbow Randolph loses his well paying job as a kid's television host (Not the same way Pee-Wee lost his), the network has problems finding a replacement since all the other stars are elsewhere or have their own problems, so the network decides they have to start with something fresh. The rest of the movie involves Rainbow Randolph trying to get his show back, and Smoochy, new to TV, figuring out exactly how kid's TV really works behind the scenes.

I can't say I'm surprised the movie did poorly at the box office, however I'm surprised it did as poor as it did. The subject may have turned people off, or had been a bit too odd for someone to even want to give it a chance. About the only time I hear people have heard of Death to Smoochy, is because Henry Rollins has talked in stand-up and such about how he auditioned for a role in the movie, but didn't get the part, and how he felt he would have done the role better.

The movie is full of great writing, lots of memorable lines, most from Williams, ""SAFAAAAAAAAAAARI!"", ""It's small but it's fierce!"", ""It was an accident"", ""You bring the hammer?"", ""Somebody touched my ass!"", etc..

The movie is not perfect, it has a few lulls here are there, but not many movies can keep such a pace. The characters in the movie are all pretty well thought out, and they're over-the-top in a way that's fitting for a movie titled, ""Death to Smoochy"".

Death to Smoochy is one of a kind. It made a big impression on me in 2002. It's one of the better movies I've seen in the past 15 years.

I am surprised since Robin Williams died, no place, that I've noticed, has mentioned this movie. It's a shame, too. I think it's a great adult comedy that he starred in. The movie allowed Robin Williams to do his thing with the character, and I can't imagine anyone else playing the part of Rainbow F^#$@** Randolph. It wouldn't have been the same film without Robin Williams.",1408320000,2,2667,4.311377245508982

Edward Norton's delivery is superb; Catherine Keener has never been more sharp and lovable; Robin Williams has a terrific role with some great lines (""Alright you spud sucking f*&ks""... ""don't you take a particular glee in...spitting on his miserable corpse, as it were"" in a great Scottish accent; and so on. There are excellent performances from the talented and really engaged supporting cast--Danny Woodburn, Pam Ferris, Harvey Fierstein, Vincent Schiavelli, Michael Rispoli, Danny DeVito (who also directed this film). I haven't seen some of these guys in years, and really miss them on the screen. There is so much physical comedy provided by the editing of the film; it is such a pleasure to watch. Rainbow ""f*7#ing"" Randolph is one of my favorite roles for the dearly departed Williams; God bless him on the next part of his journey! One less flower on this planet now.

1741972,4,B00006CXHZ,"""Death to Smoochy"" is not funny in the way that a standard parody film is. It doesn't go for cheap laughs, and it doesn't make a bunch of poorly thought-out jokes revolving around standard cliches of children's television actors. Instead, director Danny DeVito has crafted a tale that attempts to cut right into the heart of our corrupt society, and for the most part, he's succeeded. Very reminiscent of films like ""Bad Santa"", this 2002 dark comedy will make you uncomfortable more than it will make you bust a gut laughing. Which is exactly what it's trying to do.

""Smoochy"" chronicles a struggling actor who plays the titular rhinoceros on a children's show, played with charming innocence by the reliable Edward Norton. This popularity wasn't earned, however; his show is intended to fill the timeslot previously inhabited by the clown ""Rainbow Randolph"", who was recently caught in a bribery scheme. Randolph, played with nasty glee by Robin Williams, is pushed off the deep end by Smoochy's popularity, and makes a vow to end his life. This parallels Smoochy's struggle to keep the message of his program devoid of advertisements for soda and sweets, much to the chagrin of his sinister new agent, played by DeVito himself. Soon, the dark side of children's television is brought to light, which includes ties with the Irish mafia and deranged crackheads.

What makes this movie work isn't its attempts to shock us with how evil such a benign organization truly is, but instead its lack of attempts to do so. DeVito knows trying to be ""edgy"" and ""cool"" doesn't equal good entertainment, and so, his film takes everything with a very matter-of-fact tone that's very refreshing. Everybody except for Norton has some dark kink to them in ""Smoochy"", a stark contrast to some of the other characters he's played. That makes for a great central conflict to the whole experience. Norton is coming to grips with the fact that he's not perfect, while everybody else has discovered their demons long ago and simply gotten over it. A worn trope, true, but with the right actors and subject matter, it's fairly compelling.

Some may find that this is less of a gut-buster than other comedies, and hence, some critics have smashed it for being ""unfunny."" I don't think this is true. The funny thing about ""Smoochy"" is its fearlessness to look a large industry in the eye, then hock a giant wad of phlegm and spit. There have been many instances where higher-ups in kids' television and charities get busted for their corruption, and this movie acts not as a dramatic expose', but as a wry pop in the face to an industry that lets such people thrive.

That being said, I felt that the point of this movie could have been sharpened a bit more. Norton laments the current state of kids' advertisements, emphasizing that many of the products being sold have addictive traits and could be harmful for anybody to consume. While I understand part of the emphasis was to show how powerless he was against those corrupt practices, seeing more of an attack against the companies who produce those products might have made for a more scathing and poignant film. However, perhaps DeVito knew which battles to pick and which to let slide. After all, how many advertisers would've pulled funding if the film attacked the very people that helped finance the movie?

There are some other nags to be had with the script, such as the under-utilization of a pre-superstar Jon Stewart, whose character kind of falls to the wayside when he, in fact, is the prime instigator behind some of the movie's major conflicts. Catherine Keener's character as Norton's love interest was also underdeveloped. Her sour personality shifts when she opens up to the protagonist, yet it really has no reason to given her turbulent past with other mascot actors (I'll leave that part for the movie to explain.) That being said, she gave a charming performance with the material given. One final complaint should be directed at the score by David Newman. He's turned out better work in films such as ""Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure,"" ""Anastasia,"" and ""Matilda"", and while this is his third DeVito-directed film, the music comes across as bland and forgettable. However, props are to be given for the infectious ditties sung during the children's program segments, which are benign and trite enough to feel realistic.

""Death to Smoochy"" is by no means a perfect film. What it is, however, is a smart film, and a film that's not afraid to upset more than a few people. With some great performances and a solid script, there are a lot worse ways to spend 107 minutes of your life, and you might even start looking a bit harder at the kind of tripe your kids are taking in.

Great camera angles and effects, too.

1742010,4,B00006CXHZ,"I'm embarrassed to say it but I really enjoy this film. I say that because of the humor is sick, mainly the tirades spouted by Robin Williams (especially with kids nearby).

Otherwise, this black comedy offers a really wonderful character as the lead good guy: ""Smoochy the Rhino,"" played well by Edward Norton. How Norton could deliver some of these lines with a straight face is beyond me. He must have required numerous takes. He's a real hoot in here.

Despite what you might have read from national critics, there are a lot of laughs in this film. I also thought the cinematography was interesting with vivid, fascinating colors and some nice closeup shots. For a comedy, I don't expect photography to be as good as it is in here. Kudos to the director and cinematographer.

At any rate, you have to appreciate black comedy and this kind of almost-perverse humor, to like this movie.

1742016,4,B00006CXHZ,"I still can't believe that up until last night I had never seen `Death to Smoochy'.  It stars one of my all time favorite actors working today (Edward Norton) and yet it slipped right past me for some reason.  I remember a few years back I caught part of the movie on HBO and watched for a minute (it was the hilarious cookie scene) but then turned it off since I loathe catching movies in the middle.  My wife, knowing that I love everything Norton, called me from our local video store last night and asked if I had seen `Death to Smoochy' to which I replied ""no"" to which she retorted ""great, I'm getting it"".

While `Death to Smoochy' is not the funniest film I've seen in recent years it served up just what I needed after hearing of Heath Ledger's untimely death; laughs.

Danny DeVito gets behind the directors chair to take pot-shots at the world of children's entertainment and for the most part it works, at times even gloriously.  The film revolves around a rivalry between network stars.  Rainbow Randolph equals scandal and trouble and so the network drops him in favor of Smoochy the Rhino, a clean cut children loving man who wants to send a positive message to his viewers.  Once Smoochy (aka Sheldon Mopes) is hired though, he finds out that not everything is for the children.  Despite his efforts to provide a wholesome environment he is challenged by each and every bigwig in the place to do what makes money.

Edward Norton fits magically here as Sheldon.  His performance is superb and only adds to his already magnificent resume.  His co-star and onscreen nemesis Robin Williams is not so wonderful.  There are many times here that I felt Williams went a little too overboard with his hysterics and delivered an uneven performance.  It was funny in scenes (I just love his prank call to Sheldon) but all too often it was over the top and unfunny.  Catherine Keener does a nice job here as the catty Nora Wells who was against Smoochy from the beginning.  She plays this type of character well.  Her character is a little underwritten but she does her best with it and it shows.

Like I said `Death to Smoochy' is not greatest comedy out there but it plays to its strengths and delivers a satire that is funny because it's probably true.  Like `Wag the Dog' (a film that is in my humble opinion superior) it takes a behind the scenes look at something we probably don't give a second thought to and exposes an exaggerated look at what it quite possibly the truth.  I mean, the mob has ties in everything right?  Why not children's television?

Ever wonder what went on behind the scenes at a `Barney' taping?

Watch `Death to Smoochy' for an idea.",1201046400,,2669,4.53765690376569
1742017,4,B00006CXHZ,"Crazy movie.  another one we saw on TV and wanted to buy.  As much as gets through on TV we knew we were missing good parts.  And we were.  Robin is great as Rainbow Randy.  Edward Norton is just a good actor and Danny Devito is perfect as usual - type-cast as a short, rotten dude but he does it so well.  Heil Smoochey.  just crazy.",1193961600,,334,3.9696969696969697
1742018,5,B00006CXHZ,"If any of us truly knew what really goes on behind the scenes in politics,movies,television,radio and corporate advertising, then we would all probably run for the hills and bury our embarrassed heads from the the shame and disillusionment. Thus we come to the dark and twisted DEATH TO SMOOCHY,a roasting of children's t.v. shows and the people that are involved with them,on screen,behind the screen and way off screen.
Sheldon Mopes (a brilliant and positively convincing Edward Norton) believes in his mission to children;to be an honest,upright and do everything for kids to be healthy, happy and safe. His on screen character is the lovable and cuddly fuchsia-colored rhino Smoochy;Smoochy has just replaced the corrupted,bribe-taking Rainbow Randolph (a wicked Robin Williams)who had been #1 with kid's television,but now joins a long list of fallen children t.v.show stars. Sheldon a.k.a. Smoochy endeavors to keep pure and innocent in a world that is full of corruption and want of control.
This film is positively brilliant in what it has to say: we all want to believe what we see on the screen. We are dazzled,cullied and diddled into a trance and mesmerized by actors,celebrities,all the while not realizing that these people may be deeply infected with a very dark side that could bring us all crashing down in a moment. The comedy that is displayed in this film is a very clever guise to make us look at this very flawed and gullible fantasy that we all seem to have with celebrity status and the screen.
I have yet to see a better film that tackles such a prevailing problem in such an interesting way. Also featuring Catherine Keener, Jon Stewart, Danny DeVito, Vincent Schiavelli ,DEATH TO SMOOCHY is as ""black"" and disturbing a comedy that has ever been made. The humor is first rate and is full of one line zingers,but the darkness of this movie always prevails.",1190678400,2,1882,4.94006309148265
1742043,5,B00006CXHZ,"I read the reviews in the newspapers when it first came out. They were nearly all negative, with one of the main criticisms that the market for this movie is very narrow. However I always thought the plot sounded funny, even when described within a bad review.

It turned out to be one of the funniest movies I ever saw. Other than the Nazi bit, the script is terrific - ""Rock bottoms a college education kid"" ""Sorry I smell like piss."" ""How could you whack the wrong rhino?"".

I recommended it to some friends and they hated it. In my opinion the performances are great, Robin Williams is completely unrestrained and hilarious, but none of that will make a difference if you find the plot toxic. My recommendation - read the synopsis. If it sounds funny to you then give it a try.",1181865600,,781,4.454545454545454

1742045,2,B00006CXHZ,"How bummed out was I by Danny De Vito's ""Death to Smoochy""? When I finished the movie on DVD, I saw that the disc contained a ""Bloopers and Outtakes"" section on its menu. I passed it by, even though those bloopers and outtakes featured not only De Vito but also Robin Williams, Edward Norton, Catherine Keener, Harvey Fierstein and Jon Stewart. Though Norton's performance and a few scattershot funny scenes prevent the movie from becoming a total disaster, the film as a whole is so sour and abrasive that it makes ""Bad Santa"" look like ""Mary Poppins."" De Vito and screenwriter Adam Resnick never find the right tone; they mistake frenzy for laughs, and the events on display rarely even make sense-- particularly not during the last twenty minutes, which try to combine ""Holiday on Ice"" with ""Godfather III."" A cynical comedy about behind-the-scenes backstabbing in children's TV could have been delightful in the hands of a Billy Wilder or a Christopher Guest, but De Vito's sledgehammer approach pounds to dust whatever humor there might have been. Norton at least is likable as Sheldon Mopes, a/k/a Smoochy the Rhino, and he retains his dignity as a performer even while wearing a hideous fuchsia rhino suit. The same cannot be said for Williams, who prances around like a poisoned troll as Norton's disgraced rival, the scheming, venal Rainbow Randolph. His change of heart at the end is simply not believable, and neither is that of Keener, who punches up her cynical persona from ""Being John Malkovich"" to new and unpleasant heights. De Vito phones in his performance, while Fierstein and Stewart just stand there and screech. The film, I must admit, held my interest enough for me to watch it in its entirety, but at the end I felt nauseated by a surfeit of Smoochy, Randolph and their noisome friends.

1742046,4,B00006CXHZ,"With reviews this polarized, it must come down primarily to taste. Personally, I loved Death to Smoochy.  When my husband brought it home from the video store, I groaned because I knew how bad the reviews had been.  But I watched it and loved it so much that I rewatched it the next day.

It is a dark comedy and a satire, but one that takes us to a very sweet and uplifting conclusion. It is a story of the loss of innocence, but also of the rediscovery of childhood's faith in the goodness of others. It is both disarming and touching, all the more so for the dark routes it travels.

Perhaps the expectation of a feature-length Barney satire is what leads to such a disappointed reaction in many of the reviewers.  Lampooning Barney (who is already a perfect study in self-satire) is not really the focus of the movie. My advice is to watch it with as few preconceptions as possible. You might just be as pleasantly surprised as I was.",1158883200,2,938,4.398843930635838
1742047,4,B00006CXHZ,"ok i spent alot of time reading through the reviews. i read alot of the good ones and then i realized that they were all saying the same thing, or just telling you the whole story so why watch the movie right? then i skipped through to the bad ones and there were more points to be made.

the truth is like others have said before me either you think this is a good movie or not. first off let me say that there are many types of comedys and this is not like a caddyshack or adam sandler movie.this is a movie that makes you think, but only if you are willing to look at the movie as a whole.i'm not going to sit here and break the movie down for you frame by frame, there are a whole lot of other people to do that for me.

i'm not gonna say that this movie is awesome thats why i gave it 4 stars. but it was a movie that i am glad that i saw.i think that danny devito showed a different side to him. i always knew that robin williams was a loon and i have been a big fan of edward nortons for a while despite some of his upsets but i relate those to needing to work. you cant have a primal fear , fight club , or american history x every day of the week you know. i do think that this movie is classic edward norton though. i can't imagine anyone else playing the role as well as he did and i think that it showed just how suited he is to this type of genre.

the film isn't funny to everyone because not everyone looks at our world in the same way. i find it ironic that most of the people who wrote a negative review to this movie either mis-spelled a word or were looking for something witty that they could sit back and chuckle to. well thats exactly what i think this film is attacking. you have to be a little dark yourself to truly appreciate this film,the cast and danny reflect that.

This movie is one of the reasons I don't listen to the critics. (They are so arbitrary and random and stupid. ) No one should base an opinion of a movie on what the critics said.

He plays a purple rhino(Smoochy) and acts in a kinder way to the children and is alot better offstage then Rainbow Randolph ever was. Randolph soon becomes wacked in the head and soon attempts anything to get his role back. Leading to some hilarious moments on the stage and off the stage and all about the city.

The fact that the movie itself was good but slightly stupid, and then any scene with Robin Williams in it makes you think that you will die laughing... His irradical hatred for the rhino ""Smoochey"" is blown ridiculously out of proportion and is just downright hilarious.

There was a scene where Robin Williams, (Raindbow Randolph) is watching TV and is seeing Smoochey on every channel and the dialouge is just hilarious.

""Die!!!!!!!!""

""Die!!"" all the while smashing the Tv into tiny pieces with a lamp, and there's just this crazy look in his eyes that makes me laugh for hours.

Not that the flimsy plot calls for much understanding: One TV anchorman on a Cartoon Network type channel gets replaced by another and thereby spends the rest of the film trying to cobble together a scandal that will ruin his rival's cred.

A smattering of characters is squeezed into the comic blitz that follows. Some of these have sparks: a jaded producer (Catherine Keener), an Irish gangsteress, a corrupt charity executive. Most of these don't: Robin Williams is tiresome after his first act, Jon Stewart is barely noticeable as a cringing network yes-man, and Ed Norton, well some people just don't cut it in comedy.

An unpleasant flip-flop between social commentary and slapstick, neither of which it succeeds at. Instead it ends with a flaky ice-show sequence. Hardly the kind of fare you expect from DeVito.",1108080000,3,991,4.993939393939394

Sure, it's not the best film I've ever seen, but its continuous laughter/smile value makes it worth adding to your collection, to be enjoyed again and again.",1106784000,5,563,4.755102040816326

1742083,4,B00006CXHZ,"I remember that this move was decreed a flop of a movie and therefore failed at the box office.  In retrospect, I believe the movie was a lot better than the critics thought.

The story is about a new Kid Costume character named Smoochy, played by Edward Norton.  He becomes the new big shot in the kid business, but he realizes that he is the squeaky clean spot in a dirty showbiz world.  Now the plot comes down to whether or not he will clean the world or whether he will be swept up by the corruption.

This is a dark comedy; that is just fact.  Now people may have thought this was too close to a barney mock-up but it is actually spoofing more stuff than just him, the whole business in general really.  What I really like about it is that Edward Norton plays Smoochy.  I mean here is an actor who has played in movies (before and after Smoochy) such as American History X and the 25th Hour.  The fact that he can play a vegetarian child role model (Smoochy) and a gangster-like character in other movies is just impressive.

He and Robin Williams are the actors that make the movie, although it is good to see Jon Stewart doing well too.

Look, the movie may be dark but it is funny satire.  If one looks at it from a laid back view then they can see the humor.  It is not a perfect film, but the movie is funny.",1101686400,5,1319,4.16600790513834
1742084,5,B00006CXHZ,"This film was robbed by most of the national critics which once again tells us; don't skip an interesting movie based on a bad review in your local paper. The critics missed the point on this one which is a real shame. It was a flop at the box office and even director Devito on the DVD commentary refers to the aftermath of the film's release as ""the mourning period"".

What the critics failed to see is that this is one of the finest ""black"" comedies to come along in years. It is dark, snide, satirical, unrelenting, and hysterically funny. Devito's brand of physical direction is absolutely dead on. The film is filled with unbelievable energy and panache and he gets superb performances from a very talented cast. Williams in particular delivers a scathing, in your face performance. And Harvey Fierstein as a charity fraud crook is a stitch!

The kiddie songs are hilarious; the list characters from dancing midgets to the Irish mafia are straight out of a Tim Burton nightmare; the ice skating sequence accompanied by opera arias is inspired, knee slapping lunacy! The screenplay is deliciously twisted and crude. Yes, the movie assaults you with lots of foul language, but the nastiness is part of the dark hilarity of the proceedings.

What's even more impressive is that director Devito never wavers. This movie has an utterly consistent tone. It is devasting in its relentless, unflinching satire of sweet kiddie shows. I'll say it again. This movie was robbed by the local and national know nothing critics.

The sort of rampant dark humor that makes Death to Smoochy so fantastic isn't to everyone's taste.  The film is vulgar, violent, sarcastic, peculiar, and ridiculous.  In short, it's brilliant.  I believe that the only two reasons that it works so entirely well are: a)the perfect direction of Danny DeVito and b)the performances of a very talented cast.  Robin Williams is just plain hilarious, as per usual.  I think that much of his dialogue in the movie was improvised, which works so well for him.  Edward Norton is just naturally silly enough to make us believe Smoochy- not many actors could have pulled off such a character with as much charm and believeablity as he.  Catherine Keener, as always, does a wonderful job, and all the rest of the cast deserve commendation as well.  Hats off to this delightfully (and naughtily) funny movie, it will always be a favorite of the few.",1099353600,7,967,4.74251497005988
1742086,4,B00006CXHZ,"One of the most unfairly bashed directors working today is Danny DeVito.  People avoid his films like the plague, or modern Woody Allen movies.  Critics are not much kinder to him, and so both ""Death to Smoochy"" and ""Duplex"" died horrible deaths at the box office.  I'll admit that DeVito is no longer making films as good as ""War of the Roses"", but I can still count on him to give me a consistently amusing film, and that's exactly what ""Death to Smoochy"" is.

Perhaps all of the backlash to ""Death to Smoochy"" came from its failure as a satire.  DeVito takes the easy way out and is fairly soft on children's television programming, instead turning the film into a more simple mob parody.  There are some jabs at the marketing system behind kids' TV, but these come in the film's first third and aren't nearly mean enough.  As I heard one critic point out, a good satire would have been making the audience hate the Smoochy character and root for his death (which Norton and DeVito certainly don't do, or, to be fair, even try to do).

However, what's important is how FUNNY the film is, and ""Death to Smoochy"" scores here.  This is a breezy way to spend a couple hours, and while there's few laugh-out-loud moments (almost all from Williams), I found myself chuckling throughout most of the film.  The ending is kind of bizarre and surreal, but then again, this is a Danny DeVito film.

All of the actors in ""Death to Smoochy"" are at the top of their game.  I've never seen Edward Norton give a bad performance, and he shines here as the clueless saint Sheldon, who's always just trying to help out the kids.  Catherine Keener's range may be limited to playing pure sarcasm and malice, but she's in her game here (especially in the first half).  Of course, the real star of the show is Robin Williams, who goes over-the-top as the psychotic Rainbow Randolph.  His charatcer's so bizarre as to be almost surreal, but he has all of the best lines and steals almost every scene he's in.  Not since the 80's has Williams been so unleashed.

So, while ""Death to Smoochy"" is not a great satire, it's a funny comedy that deserved far more praise than it got.  If you haven't seen it yet, it's worth the price of a rental, if only to check out Robin Williams and the twisted but brilliant mind of DeVito.",1094601600,,2300,4.487980769230769

1742089,4,B00006CXHZ,"Death to Smoochy (Danny DeVito, 2002)
Death to Smoochy is sick, twisted, wrong in every conceivable way. It's also the meanest, ugliest, and downright funniest comedy I've seen since Being John Malkovich.
While the movie initially got a great deal of bad press, that is slowly being rectified as more people who shied away thanks to negative critical reviews at first are discovering this gem. I should have known better, as I'll watch Ed Norton in anything, but it took even me this long to finally see the thing.
Rainbow Randolph (Robin Williams) is a kids' TV host with a weakness for bribes; he accepts them to get kids on the show. He is arrested immediately after the movie starts, leaving his network with an empty time slot. The show's producers, Mona (Catherine Keener) and Frank (Jon Stewart) need a replacement with integrity. They find it in Sheldon Mopes, aka Smoochy the Rhino (Edward Norton). But you get the inevitable question: what happens when you put someone with a strong sense of ethics and principles into a field as corrupt as television, especially when dealing with the kids' market? Nastiness, and hilarity, ensues. Not only does Randolph want his slot back and is willing to do anything to get it, but the shadowy head of Parade of Hope, Merv Green (Harvey Fierstein), is after Smoochy to do benefit work once the show takes off. All Smoochy wants to do is help the kids understand that organic food is good and step-parents need love, too (and other such things, in a series of songs that are worth the price of admission alone). Excellent supporting roles by DeVito, Vincent Schiavelli, Michael Rispoli, Pam Ferris, and many others make this simply a joy to watch.
I'll warn you now, though, Death to Smoochy seems to inspire love-it-or-hate-it reactions. It's obviously not for everyone. But I think if you liked Very Bad Things or thought Being John Malkovich was one of the funniest things you'd ever seen, this is probably going to be right up your alley.

I don't know if this was Danny DeVitos directorial debut but certainly this well known actor has managed to capture the crazy world of children's television and their caricature hosts. Certainly Pee Wee herman, and for the more mature among us, Soupy Sales will come to mind ......
In a nutshell, Robin Williams is a very successfull kids show host 'Rainbow Randolph' that get uncermoniously canned the minute they catch him taking bribes from parents wanting kids to get on his super popular show. The network then in a bind quickly hires the antitehisis of Rainbow a super squeaky clean Smootchie played by Edward Norton. This of course is the premise of the show that Ranbow Randolph wants his old job back and he has to kill Smootchie to get it
Robin Williams was absolutely fabulous and I was very happy to see that the director managed to hold him back from just plain domieering any show or movie that Robin appears on.

1742091,4,B00006CXHZ,"This hilarious skewering of kids television is refreshing even among dark comedies.  Rainbow Randolph (Robin Williams) has lost it all - television show, penthouse, reputation - when his network producer (Catherine Keener) finds Sheldon Mopes (Edward Norton) singing in a homemade costume in a methadone clinic.  She brings him aboard KidNet as Smoochy, dresses him up, gives him an elaborate, colorful set, and launches a career.  The trouble is, Sheldon is naive, and wants only  to teach children about the benefits of organic food, tolerance, and anti-consumerism.  And Rainbow Randolph has dedicated his every waking minute to orchestrating his downfall.  Throw in Danny DeVito as Smoochy's corrupt, power-hungry agent, a Irish mob protecting a lovable, brain-damaged boxer who loves Smoochy, the head of a children's charity capable of murder, and a string of has-been children's television performers - and you've got a twisted, laugh out loud black comedy that is like nothing else I've seen.
Even Barney-haters will love the clips from Smoochy's show since Sheldon believes so completely in goodness.  He really wants to change the world, in his politically correct, strict vegetarian way.  When he sings, ""Your stepfather is not mean/(chorus of kids) He's just adjusting,"" it's hilarious.  His wholesome image contrasts dramatically with the foul-mouthed, cynical, and even murderous characters around him.  Robin Williams turns in an excellent grungy performance as Randolph.  Edward Norton is completely believable and lovable as Sheldon/Smoochy, even when the corruption around him begins to affect him.  Catherine Keener has just the right mix of hard-nosed corporate greed, cynicism, and the ability to be won over by a good children's song.  Danny DeVito is the kind of seedy character he always plays; his real contribution to this film is as its director, and he does a fabulous job.  The set and costume designs are notable as well.
You need a twisted sense of humor to fully appreciate this film.  Oddly, despite the premise, this is not a mean comedy.  Randolph's murderous impulses, while ugly, are off-set by Sheldon's honest attempts to protect the sanctity of children's television.

I can tell from the average rating that my opinion isn't shared lol I think people tried to take this movie more seriously than necessary. It was over the top. It wasn't believable.

I mean... Edward Norton... as Barney basically. I love how the characters all seem at least a little insane. I mean, don't you think the people doing those shows are a little insane? I know I do. This movie is all about poking fun at that notion.
Just watch it without trying to psychoanalyze everything. While it doesn't pop into my mind as one of the most entertaining films of all time... I can't help but watch it when it comes on HBO. It comes on, I stop what I'm doing, and watch the rest of it. Every time. And every time I laugh. And there are lots of movies that come on that I'd say are better, but yet they don't stop me and cause me to sit down and watch them for the umpteenth time.

The kiddie network run by John Stewart, needs to find a new character to put in the slot. So they hunt down  Sheldon Mopes playing Smoochy at a local drug addict clinic.

As hard as this is for me to admit, I really enjoyed Death to Smoochy. Before I watched this film, I was sitting in the same boat as everyone else. I thought that there was no possible way for this movie to be any good at all. However, after I finished with the movie, I was literally stunned at how great it turned out to be. The movie has to be one of the most underrated films ever made. The reason that it has not been received better, is because people skip the film all together. The film really made me laugh and you actually stay involved in the story. Robin Williams gives his best comic performance that I have seen in awhile. In fact, it was very similar to his performance in ""The Fisher King"". He is twisted, demented, and mentally unstable. Edward Norton, Catherine Keener, Danny DeVito, and the rest of the cast are all good as well.
The only piece of advice I can give with this movie is to give it a chance and ignore what you have heard. If you give the film a chance, you might actually end up liking it.

1742106,4,B00006CXHZ,"Danny DeVito's blacker-than-black comedy went straight to video in most countries after famously tanking at the US box-office.  Maybe American audiences started having unfortunate flashbacks to ""Pee Wee's Playhouse"" and thought they were being subliminally corrupted.  Who knows?  The film's fundamental ""problem"" - that it's a daring kind of ""screwball noir"" fusion of kids' television, mob violence, foul language and artful satire that skewers big business right where it hurts - is also the best thing about it.  Adam Resnick's tightly plotted and wonderfully acerbic screenplay fell into just the right hands with DeVito who realises its misanthropic vision with an almost maniacal flair.  If you have no sense of humour, or think it's sacrilege to suggest that kids' television is made for profit (gasp!), or simply can't accept that the stuffed foam suits prancing around your kid's TV screen contain real human beings with as much call to be bitter and twisted as the rest of us, then ""Death to Smoochy"" probably isn't for you.  If, however, you appreciate cutting satire and the immense comic talents of DeVito, Williams and Norton, then bring it on.  Williams, in a refreshingly nasty turn, has never been better that when he's spitting out the vicious one-liners Resnick gives him.  In a scene where he's being harassed by reporters about how it feels to be the most hated man in America, he replies:  ""In a country of Neanderthals, I wear it as a badge of honor.""

A star of a children's television show is caught accepting bribes and loses his job.  He's then replaced by another who is 'squeaky clean'.  The entirety of it is based on a consipiring agent and a washed up TV star's obsession with revenge. It wasn't the worst movie I've seen, but it is lacking too much to mention.  This is not a movie for Robin Williams fans.  His character is the complete opposite of the usual quirky, humorous ones he's known for. I was amused with the fact that nearly every other word out of his mouth was foul. He pulls off the insanely jealous, psychotic nature of his character very well.  Edward Norton also does a great job playing a love all veggan whose primary goal in life is to make others happy and give them hope in humanity. Over all, I'd say this movie isn't worth the money. It was nothing like the previews made it out to be.  There was scarcely any amount of quality in it. I find dark, demented humor amusing, yet in the end I loathed paying the 4 bucks to rent it.

1742110,5,B00006CXHZ,"Let me begin this review by saying that, as you can probably tell by most of the other reviews here, this is a movie you'll either love or hate. There are a lot of people out there who slammed ""Death to Smoochy"" when it came out, unfortunately including a large number of critics, and it hasn't done all that well as a result. But if you have the right sort of sense of humor, this movie will make you laugh until you've got tears in your eyes.
Robin Williams plays the star of a children's television show (whose television persona couldn't be more different from what he's like in his real life) who is replaced by Ed Norton, an impossibly nave do-gooder of a fuchsia rhinoceros, and vows to have revenge. Everyone in the cast does an excellent job, but it's Robin Williams who provides most of the many howling, tears-in-your-eyes laughs you'll find in this movie. He is as hilarious as he's ever been in ""Death to Smoochy,"" and shines in every scene. There are a few points in the film where it seems to slow down a little, but for the most part, it's great fun from start to finish.
If you're the kind of person who thinks it can be hilarious to skewer unlikely targets such as nationwide charities and children's television, if you often laugh out loud at jokes that many others consider to be irreverent, or if ""twisted"" is a word you can easily apply to your sense of humor, chances are that you'll find this DVD to be worth its weight in platinum. If you're a more conventional type, or think that Robin Williams giving a child a cookie in the shape of a phallus isn't amusing, you should probably stay away.",1071878400,2,1617,4.429530201342282
1742111,5,B00006CXHZ,"Directed by Danny DeVito (War of the Roses) and written by Adam Resnick (Larry Sanders Show, Get a Life), Death of Smoochy tells the story of a homicidally bitter kids' show has-been, Rainbow Randolph (Robin Williams), and the object of his loathing, Smoochy, a fuschia rhino played by genuinely nice Sheldon Mopes (Edward Norton). Based on the premise that kid shows are run  by greedy corporate marketers who don't care much about kids at all, this dark satire manages to throw barbs at the media, entertainers, executives, the mob, charities -- even ice shows!

The supporting cast is stellar  -- Catherine Keener, Harvey Fierstein, Jon Stewart, Danny DeVito, Vincent Schiavelli, Pam Farris and more. Everyone does a GREAT job. I watched this despite horrid reviews because I really enjoy the work of so many of the participants, and upon viewing it I have to say that I think the critics were absolutely wrong. I kept waiting for the plot to fall apart, for the pacing to slow, some fatal flaw -- but it stayed funny throughout the film. Not every comedy makes me laugh out loud, but this did several times, and I wanted to watch it again the next day.

The climactic ice show is surreal good time -- watch for the Chinese characters spelling out ""dead rhino"" on the ice! It's a shame that this gem didn't get the audiences it deserved. If you like satire, dark comedy, DeVito's previous work, an unrestrained Robin Williams, OR if you are suspicious of Barney and corporate media, you will probably get a real kick out of this film. Caveat: Inappropriate viewing for kids due to violence and foul language.

DVD extras are excellent and exemplary. There is a very good commentary track with DeVito and DP Michos; a largely unnarrated 7-1/2 minute behind-the-scenes documentary; 10 additional scenes; bloopers; 3 trailers; lots of stills, including Smoochy's post-production vacation; crew & cast info; and an interactive ice show, in which you can watch the  film's ice show scene using 4 camera angles.

As with most satire, you may judge it by how offended the skewer-ees were, and these were plenty upset! Even though the critical buzz is bad, you should take a chance on this film. Essential for fans of comedic satire.

Robin Williams' career ended after ""The Fisher King.""  He hasn't been funny in quite some time either.  Danny DeVito directed ""The War of the Roses.""  That's only one of the funniest movies of our time and then he directs this piece of crap.
How could they think this movie was good while making it?  It's pathetic.  The humor is very raunchy and not funny for that matter.  The songs on Smoochy's shows are very emabarassing and I can't believe Ed Norton acted like that.  What was he thinking?  Someone explain this to me.
Harvey Firestein is in this movie as a mobster!  Nuff said.
Yet some of you people still like this movie.  Maybe I'm missing the boat, but I was under the impression that movies were supposed to have plot, acting, and direction.
This doesn't seem to be the case here.  The screenplay is almost as funny as ""Attack of the Clones.""  The acting is a hair below that of any Kevin Costner movie (YIKES!!!)  And I imagine a boston terrier directed this movie (I wish that were true).
Awful awful awful.  Can't describe my hatred for this movie enough.
Don't see it ever!  You'll thank me saving your mind the torture.  If you're a glutton for punishment....go ahead.

A lot of the humor is really off beat and just weird, like jon stewart describing edward norton's character as ""he's a bottle of pancake syrup with legs!"" but that's what makes it so good.  It's different and original.  They didn't bother using the same tired old sitcom type jokes, instead going for something that actually takes humor to enjoy.
When so many movies now go for sophmoric laughs, I found Death To Smoochy a welcome change.  It's a black comedy...so don't expect it to fall into the normal, repetitive and cliche territory of things like rob schneider's 8 million films.",1065225600,,725,4.6328125
1742127,3,B00006CXHZ,"This is an odd little film. It's funny, but in an off-center kind of way. If you found Fight Club funny (which I thought it was in parts), then you'll probably find this movie funny as well. Not that they are the same in context, just that their humor is similar in the oblique way at which they approach it.
This is clearly a dark comedy that envelopes itself into a style that is much like the children's television shows they produce. In fact, I'd venture to say that the style of this film is almost comic book in nature. The lighting is very stark and solid in it's choice of colors and the characters are almost ripped from the pages of a Dick Tracy comic book, albeit a more modern one.
Robin Williams gives a very funny performance as a homo-repressed over-the-top children's TV host and delivers his comedy in his characteristic rapid fire delivery. It's classic Robin Williams. Edward Norton shows us yet another side to his character acting skills as a meek and mild, cleaner than clean wannabe children's television host. His opening scene performing at a heroin clinic is just classic, ""Let's face it. Big junkies come from little junkies. We gotta nip this in the bud, Burke!"". Yet Norton plays Smoochy with a bit of a hidden dark edge that keeps you thinking he's going to pop at any moment. It just keeps the energy of the film always at a high rev.
Another notable performance was Jon Stewart. He plays Marion Frank Stokes, a producer and overall sleaze. He did surprisingly well considering he was acting opposite Edward Norton and Robin Williams! Some of the best parts though are in the out takes at are in the ""Special Features"" section of the DVD. I encourage you to watch the out takes if for nothing else than to see him hold is improv ground again Williams. I always knew Jon was fast, but he's really able to go toe-to-toe with one of the masters of improv. Some really funny stuff.
Overall, Death To Smoochy is Mr. Rogers, meets The Simpsons, meets Ren and Stimpy. It's a farcical romp through a very distorted view of children's television that will have you laughing in that fun, but un-comfortable way. Especially when you hear Smoochy sing...
Smoochy: [Singing] He slams the door He stomps his feet He sends me to bed with zilch to eat But my stepdad's not mean he's just adjusting.
Smoochy: [Speaking] So you see, kids, a stepfather is just like a new puppy. He needs love and care. Remember though, if your stepdad is EVER abusive towards YOU or MOMMY, what's the magic numbers?
Kids: 9-1-1!
Smoochy: Thaaaaaaat's right!""",1063929600,,2554,4.615384615384615

1742152,4,B00006CXHZ,"For a nation that supposedly loves satire, I just don't understand why so many satire-loving people didn't enjoy DEATH TO SMOOCHY. I can understand why many parents would be opposed because this definitely isn't a movie that children should be watching; it's an R-rated film and even though most ""teenagers"" probably have seen and heard darker things in the halls of their schools, most are too young to understand the humour of this brilliant picture. However, I just can't understand why so many others seem to dislike this film unless it's because the movie is such a good satire, too many people see themselves in the film.

Basically, DEATH TO SMOOCHY is a dark comedy (satire) about children's entertainment in America. It illustrates everything that is wrong with the business of children's entertainment, mainly the whole business part of it. And contrary to what some people believe, there is a message here, though a very subtle one and may not have even been intended. That message being that it's only the purest of hearts that really succeed and make a difference and be sure to never loose sight of your ideals, otherwise you'll either be crushed or corrupted.

Robin Williams and Ed Norton are great in their roles and for once Williams' maniac comedy doesn't stick out; he actually seems normal in the twisted realm in which his character exists. The script is great and there are some really great scenes and lines. Danny Devito did an excellent job at balancing the cartoony/bizarre parts of the film with the real-life situations it is satirizing.

As someone who briefly worked in the children's entertainment industry, I can attest to how accurate the film is. Everything is an exaggeration of what actually occurs, but this brilliant satire does illustrate everything that is wrong with children's entertainment in America.",1053129600,,1845,5.022875816993464
1742153,3,B00006CXHZ,"Think of the ""Kill Barney"" songs that a 6 yr old sings when Barney is no longer funny.

Mr. Williams does wonderful when you can let him go and just free associate the jokes and like in ""Good Morning Vietnam"". But here he barely gets going and the scene cuts away from him.
Also hardly deserving of its ""R"" rating. Most kids will have heard the language on the playground even if they don't understand it. The violence happens mostly off camera or its a set up and then a camera cut. As in we see the axe, we hear the scream but we don't see anything. It happens in a very cartoonish way.

I honestly would like to see the attempts of some of you reviewers.  This film has amazing performances by all involved, an offbeat, yet interesting plotline, and midgets (which, let's face it, make any movie just a little bit better).  For the random reviewers whose reviews I've read: yes, there is an Irish mafia, the contrast between Randolph and Sheldon was very much intentional, and he was supposed to seem annoying, to a degree at least.
I know this isn't much of a straightforward review, but I want to address the idea that this movie isn't for kids.  This film is rated R.  It never said anything different than R, which means Restricted Viewing.  If you're a parent who took your kid to see this movie based on the fact that it had a pink rhino in it, you are a terrible parent, and you should be ashamed of yourself.  This is most definitely not a film for kids, and it never claimed to be as such.  It is a film for adults who can appreciate very black humor, and can tolerate fun being poked at the industry of child's entertainment, whose influence on our children we severly underestimate.

Williams is brilliant and gives me hope that he can still be edgy and dark.  His Disney type films of late have been lackluster and generic.  It is wonderful to see him in this arena again. Remember The Fisher King?  Smoochy is a winner. ***1/2 Stars.",1051401600,2,536,4.418367346938775
1742156,3,B00006CXHZ,"Those of you who are used to Robin Williams playing straight forward comedy roles (Mrs. Doubtfire and Jack) may be a bit shocked with his performance here.  You first see Williams as the lovable, kid-friendly Rainbow Randolph.  On screen he appears amiable, but once you see him cutting a deal with the parents of a child (who wants to dance on his show) he instantly becomes the bad guy.  From the start, Death To Smoochy is a very unique movie.  Im not too sure if its supposed to be a comedy or a drama or both; which in turn confused me on the seriousness of the film.  Alongside Williams is Fight Club star Edward Norton.  In this role (as the title character) he really steals the show.  He, unlike Randolph, is a pure childrens entertainer.  And that spawns for quite the war between Randolph and Smoochy.
Once Rainbow Randolph loses his primetime TV spot, studio executives (Catherine Keener and Jon Stewart) scramble to find a replacement.  They stumble upon Smoochy.  Smoochy is basically a latter day, 2002 version of Barney.  The man behind (inside) Smoochy is Sheldon Mopes, who is the epitome of nice people.  Everything he does is pleasant; even though everyone keeps putting him down and trying to change his Smoochy routine.  The plot of the film is based on Randolph getting his revenge on Smoochy... hence the title.  The comedy within the plot is pretty much hit-and-miss.  And the drama/action sequences are very weak as far as actions and dramas go.  Had it not been for the acting of both Williams and Norton, this movie wouldve been horrible.  I have to say that Williams using the f-word about a millions times did become a little uncomfortable, though.  It might have actually been better if the movie was PG-13.  But thats neither here nor there.  There are too many aspects of Death To Smoochy that make it shaky as a film.  At times, Danny DeVitos plot and direction seemed to want to be too original.  Everything about the movie--the plot, Jon Stewarts haircut, Williams vulgar rants, the drama--was out of place to the point of disturbing.  I really had a hard time getting into, and enjoying, the film.  But as I said the comedy was hit-and-miss, so a few spots were bright.  I did enjoy the young girl who approached Randolph at the point of him trying to kill himself.  That part was actually funny and smart; I won't ruin it for you.  The ending was also superb; and probably made this movie worthwhile.  I will say I thought DeVito shouldve kept his name out of the cast list.  His appearance was unmemorable and probably couldve been played better by someone else.  Nevertheless his  many fans will probably enjoy it.
By this point I think Ive said enough about the movie.  I don't like to ruin things for people.  I think its safe to say if you enjoy dark, twisted comedies that youll like, maybe even love Death To Smoochy.  The acting by Robin Williams and Edward Norton give the film some noble appeal.  But its really only those two actors who stand out as good performers.  The plot is definitely original; you will not find another movie even comparable to this.  Id classify it as a mix between those infamous Barney TV shows and, well... Psycho.  Scratch that.  Whatever my opinions, you should certainly watch this movie.  Only then can you decide if its perverse, sickened comedy clashes well with your movie tastes.",1050710400,,3364,4.674061433447099
1742177,4,B00006CXHZ,"Death to Smoochy isn't going to win any awards for best script, best actor or best anything. It's a dark comedy that doesn't push messages down your throat nor cue you into laughing as so many comedies do. Actually, the lack of telegraphing humor makes Death to Smoochy more enjoyable.
Danny DeVito films are usually a bit twisted with humor tending to be dark by nature and Death to Smoochy is right within this niche. Edward Norton again shows his acting chops by playing what amounts to against character as the almost clueless but good hearted hero. Robin Williams delivers a good performance with a nice balance of his non-stop comedic blitz versus a desperate character who just happens to say ugly things that are funny within the context of the film.
But more importantly Death to Smoochy is fun to watch and lacks the flaws of straight out comedy. The plot and subject matter is actually interesting as are the multitude of situations found in the film.
I would recommend this to DeVito fans that enjoyed ""The Battle of the Roses"" or ""Throw Mama From The Train"". The laughs here are not bellyaches but more things that make you smile and chuckle. Non-stop humor is not here and central to enjoying this film is whether you can deal with the children show scenes. They are very well designed in a Mel Brooks kind of way, nowhere as elaborate as some of Brooks' musical numbers but of interesting complexity and surprisingly catchy rather than annoying songs.
The other interesting choice was the balance of sweet humor against some very dark humor and a bit of smutty humor added for good measure. Danny DeVito plays yet another slease-ball character and does a fine job with the films look and direction.

I saw an interview with Danny Devito when he said, ""Death to Smoochy is a mix of Barney and Pulp Fiction,"" and you bet I kicked myself ... when I bought it. I truly believed I was going to see that mix and was very interested. Not only the statement that Danny Devito made, but also the great cast of Edward Norton and Robin Williams. These are probably one of the best actors of today, but what this movie made me realize is that great actors don't always make great descisions.
To begin with, the main character, Edward Norton's character, was the most annoying main character I've seen in a movie. He wasn't so annoying that it made him funny, he was so annoying that he was.....well, annoying. The writers tried to make the annoyingness into laughter, but it just didn't work. I probably only laughed once in the movie and it was when Robin Williams sang a corny song. There were two things I remember clearly about what I didn't like also. I had hope that at least SOMETHING cool would happen in this boring movie. Like Edward Norton with a gun in his hand. I said to myself, ""Ok, maybe it starts to get cool here."" But before I knew it, Edward Norton's character says, Why am I doing this, this isn't right. Every single part I felt that it would start to be cool, something really stupid happens. The other clear memory I have about the movie is how embarrassed I was to take my girlfriend to a movie I had chosen and recommended. I was so embarrassed, I don't think I chose a movie after several other movie dates. So, if you think you are going to see a clever, funny and very dark humored movie with Death to Smoochy, are you in for a surprise.

The guy who played the rhino was stupid and should have been killed, but of course, he becomes the main character once the girl goes to bed with him. The Irish mob would have been cool if they were also trying to kill Smoochy but they help him throughout the movie(who ..wants to help a a guy who dresses like a purple rhino for kids anyway?). If this movie didn't have all the bad language in it, it would have gotten a PG rating or even a G rating! Death to Smoochy is suppose to make fun of children's shows but all it does is support it. If someone is going to make another movie about the dark side of children's shows, it should be all of these:
1. Bad Language
2. Lots of violence
3. Dark humor
4. Robin William should star in it. He did a good job of playing the enraged Rainbow Randolph. (Okay, maybe not!)

Soon Rudolph begins to hatch a plan to get Smoochy off the air by disgracing and killing him and get everything he lost back, and it results in some disturbingly hilarious results; while Smoochy juggles the mob, overbearing tv execs (are there any other?), and a mentally slow fan who used to be a boxer (a role that Henry Rollins was passed over for).

I enjoy just about every movie I see, and only later bother to find the plot-holes and inconsistencies. However, I -do- know what 'good' is, and this movie is 'great', period.
Not everyone will understand or catch the fleet-footed dialogue, or giggle at the really dark physical comedy. 'Death to Smoochy' has already relegated (or should I say elevated) itself to -cult- status. There are two aspects that stand out in this film that make it something I want to own, as follows:
1. Brilliantly written dialogue. Simple as that, almost -no- awkward jokes (almost), excellent delivery from nearly -everyone-. I laughed out loud, brayed even!
2. Robin Williams. Yes, he's been something of a type-cast lately, what with all these 'we need harmless-seeming insane guys' roles, and after seeing Isomnia and One Hour Photo, I wasn't convinced he could do it. Now I realize how much they held him back. He is truly whacked in this role, and in my opinion, I don't remember being more impressed with him. As with Jim Carey in Cable Guy though, it will probably go largely unrecognized because there wasn't a giant Hollywood budget pushing this flick. But here it is anyway, and you can watch it for yourself and revel in how truly maniacal and with apparent relish he pulls this character off.
Hats off to you Mr. DeVito. Just my kind of movie, and you did it with a truly sick sense of class and style, something most movies today don't dare try, for fear of not appeasing the herd. You, and others in your position, should continue to make movies that are off the beaten path.",1035158400,3,1698,4.625827814569536

Robin Williams takes a brief hiatus from his kind-but-misguided roles (see Mrs. Doubtfire, Patch Adams, etc) to sink his teeth into a comedy with bite, and back-breaking laughs (I fell out of my seat laughing).  The always spectacular Edward Norton (American History X, Primal Fear)takes on the good guy role for a change.  And Danny Devito returns in fine form as a wise-cracking, well-meaining but unscrupulous manager of the whole show...
The Plot
Rainbow Randolph (Williams)has just been fired from his old job at KidNet, since he was caught accepting bribes from parents to put their kids on his show.  The network, in an attempt to salvage its reputation, hires Sheldon (Norton)and consequently his squeakly-clean, vegan, and politically correct purple rhino alter-ego Smoochy to replace Rainbow Randolph. Randolph, of course, will have none of it, and after crashing in fit of despair and depression at the home of a former castmate, decides to bring into fruition the demise of Smoochy.  His methods will have you on the floor with aching jawbones, as his antics run afoul of the Irish mob and other seedy characters.
I absolutely loved this movie,(and I don't beleive in any kind of censorship, which is what the film-rating system is all about) but I could not, in good conscience encourage anyone to take their kids to see it.  So LEAVE THE KIDS AT HOME, get some water and tissues and prepare for a delicious laugh-fest.  YOu might just die laughing....",1034812800,3,1656,4.833922261484099

Without the singing and dancing this movie would have been about forty minutes.  Not much can be said for the movie because I can't put my finger on anything that stood out dramatically. The worst part of the movie was robin Williams Mrs. Doubtfire and his lack of impressive or believable insanity. If you want a great Robin Williams move watch One Hour Photo or Insomnia.  Ed Norton was good but with a set of movies like his this was definitely a misdirected choice.

Anyway, rainbow is fired for accepting bribes. He is replaced by the earnest Sheldon Mopes (Edward Norton; FIGHT CLUB) and his persona of Smoochy the Rhino. This doesn't bode well for Rainbow Rudolph and he plots revenge on Smoochy. Sound ridiculous? It is.
 But it's meant to be. This isn't a great comedy but it has its moments. However, I expected more from the talent involved.

1742263,4,B00006CXHZ,"Death to Smoochy is a dark and demented comedy about 2 kid show stars. One in Rainbow Randolph (Robin Williams) is a dancing man in a colorful outfit and a top hat that entertains kids on his show but is foul mouthed low life in person. Randolph loses his job when the F.B.I. arrest him for accepting a suitcase of money. He goes literly insane when a newcomer who's his total opposite in Smoochy the Rhino (Edward Norton) takes his time slot.
  I'm sure Death to Smoochy will be on a lot of critics top 10 worst movies of the year list, that's because they have no idea how to take a movie like this. They say they want an original movie and when they get it they have no idea what to do with it. Mean hello!, it's not meant to be taken seriously and most of you that hated it made that mistake. As for saying 2 talented actors like Norton and Williams give bad performances I totally disagree. Think Norton is great as the innocent Smoochy who gets lurred into corruption by his crooked agent (Danny Devito). Williams is hilarious but in a different way than usual. For instance when he attacks this innocent guy trying to save Rhinos, you can't help but howl with laughter. He really takes his wackyness to a whole new level with this movie.
  Whatever you do though don't mistake the film a kids movie and rent or buy it for them as it has a lot of cursing, twisted subject matter and is pretty violent too. Other than all I have to say is just sit back and enjoy and be ready for a twisted and unusual film.",1032912000,2,1512,4.2578397212543555

Overall-If you want a comedy that makes you think, get this now",1032739200,,524,4.494736842105263
1742265,4,B00006CXHZ,"This movie is a prime example of why I never listen to professional critics.  Most of the time, they hate movies that I love and love movies that I hate.  Of course this movie isn't going to win any Acadamy Awards.  Of course it isn't the best film ever.  It's not trying to be.  I found ""Death to Smoochy"" to be a dark and entertaining comedy with a really creative story.  Robin Williams and Edward Norton star in this off-the-wall freak show directed by Danny DeVito.
Williams used to be ""Rainbow Randolph;"" a kiddie-show host who children just adored.  That is, until he was busted for taking a bribe.  Now the not so rainbow man is out of the job and is homeless.  Out of an act of desperate measures, the company decides to hire Edward Norton; a dorky self-righteous dweeb without a single skeleton hiding in his closet.  A new kiddie-show host is born, and his name is ""Smoochy the Rhino.""  Well, Rainbow Randolph is not pleased at all.  In fact, he's willing to take the rhino down for good.  Because he's going hunting!  The story unfolds with some of the most outrageous twists and turns to be seen in a comedy in a long time.
The acting is really good, and is right for this type of movie.  Williams is over-the-top as always, and Norton really gives us the impression of such a moral imbecile, he makes Ned Flanders look like a no good hoodlum!  The cast also inculdes Jon Stewart, Catherine Keener, and Danny DeVito himself.  They all do this movie justice.
The directing by DeVito really shines in this movie.  Had it been given to anyone else, it could've been a disaster.  He knew when to have the actors take it up a notch and then tone it down when the time was right.  I also really liked how the movie was filmed.  At one minute, the movie would be bright and colorful, and then dark and grim the next.  It really keeps the viewer's attention.
The DVD is quite good.  Very surprised with it.  As I said before, Warner Bros. usually likes to hold back when it comes to special features, but there's a lot on this one.  Some of the features include commentary from the director and director of photography, additional scenes, bloopers and outtakes, trailers, and many more.  I especially got a kick out of the bloopers and outtakes.  Just wished it was a little longer.
So, if you're looking for an artistic movie or one that's going to win a few Oscars, then skip this movie.  If you're looking for an off-the-wall dark comedy with a creative plot and story, then ""Death to Smoochy"" just may be the movie for you.  Yes, I feel there could've been things done to make the movie better, but I was really pleased with the overall product.  A very strange and bizarre movie it is, but that's the kind of movie I love.",1032652800,39,2732,4.438631790744467
1742266,3,B00006CXHZ,"Death to Smoochy starts with a great premise, an excellent cast and a wonderful sense of humor. But the rushing pace of the first half hour and a plot that doesn't seem to know where it's going hurts this dark comedy.
When Rainbow Randolph (Robin Williams) is caught in illegal doings behind the scenes of his children's television show, he's canned, and producers quickly replace him with Smoochy, a rhino costumed Edward Norton. A jealous Randolph takes matters into his own hands and tries to end Smoochy's life.
Sounds outrageously funny? Yes, it is. But all the above takes place in the first four minutes. It feels so rushed, we don't get to know Randolph at all before he's down on his luck in the street. In fact, we never feel like we know Randolph nearly was well as Smoochy.
Eventually, the pace slows down to a digestible level, and you can settle into the film, but it's about this time that Randolph loses almost all of his screen time. The plot suddenly shifts away from his attempts at ruining Smoochy's career and takes other avenues.
Don't get me wrong, this is at times a hilarious film, taking that unique view of children's television like Barney that adults often voice around the proverbial water cooler. Death to Smoochy is thoroughly enjoyable, acting out our imaginations on those kiddie favorites. It is just unfortunate this film doesn't seem to know exactly where it wants to take us, and suffers because of it.
Even though I only gave this one 3 stars, its still a must-see and highly enjoyable. The faults are just too glaring to ignore. It had so much more potential.",1032652800,3,1599,4.693950177935943

You'll scar them for life! As for the adults, you'll laugh until you wet your pants. I love rhinos, and it was worth the price of admission just to see Ed Norton in a Fuscia rhino suit strumming a guitar in a methodone center before he's ""discovered"" and replaces the disgraced Rainbow Randolph as the ""King"" of kid T.V. Willams has been exploring his dark side in his last three films (this one, Insomnia, and One Hour Photo), but he's over the top evil in this one -- manic in every sense of the word. Norton is ever-so-innocent, a country boy who just loves kids. Too bad he's drawn into the meat grinder of kid T.V.

Rainbow Randolph is a corrupt, selfish, greedy, manipulative degenerate person, while Sheldon Mopes is honest, kind, caring, and a sweet person, but even these qualities don't exactly make him perfect either.  but regardless of their rivalry and all the other circumstances that threaten to destroy them both...this is one of the coolest and funniest films I've ever seen...",1030924800,,1061,5.034285714285715

Especially when these great actors are involved in a concept that seemed so witty in previews.
However, Death to Smootchy was a crushing disappointment. None of the characters had personalities with any depth whatsoever, and you almost have to think whoever wrote the script said to him/herself: ""okay, this character uses lots of obsenities, this one doesn't swear at all... ... ...and I'm done."" Every single line of dialogue feels absolutely forced and is an embarassment to the art of scripting. It only makes things worse when 99% of the jokes aren't actually funny. Add to this that every corny plot device and cliche love interest in the book are used in the most cheesy way possible, and you have a train wreck on your hands.
This is one of the few movies I have watched that literally made me feel embarassed for both myself and the actors involved as I watched it. I can't in good conscience give this movie any more then one star, not only because it was awful, but also because it had so much potential to be great. It would have been so easy to make this movie shine, yet director Danny DeVito failed horribly.

1742322,5,B00006CXHZ,"Is it just me, or has America's sense of humor gone so far into Bizarro World that only by reading into the exact opposite of a major Hollywood review can I be led to a movie as wet-yourself funny as Death to Smoochy?  Have we completely missed the point here?  Audiences for A Midsummer Night's Dream and As You Like It threw garbage and food and spit gobs of phlegm on Shakespeare's casts, but effete film critics today don't consider that a signature of the plays as comedic failures.  They count them among his finest.
  Is Death to Smoochy tasteless?  Absolutely, but it is a lampoon of a tasteless genre of American Info-tainment, so the more exaggerated its lack of couth, the better.  Is it loud, dark, and over-the-top?  Completely, but not so much so that it ever flies off-balance and stops making sense.  I question an industry which raves over Snatch but trashes Smoochy.  This is loud, sick, disturbing comedy that should make us question who those heroic little purple role-models we saturate our children with REALLY might be.  It's an attack on the mindlessness of juvenile commercialism and the banality of both kiddie entertainment and its accepting, fawning public.  Randolf doesn't lament the loss of his JOB, he weeps and plots over his TIME SLOT.  And why IS there always, for every kid-oriented show or movie, a version ""On Ice""?  Because kids like ice shows?  Or because ice shows are a relatively cheap way to cash in through ticketing and concessions on what otherwise only generates income from advertisers?  I wonder... ...

1742323,5,B00006CXHZ,"This is one of the finest black comedies to come out in years.  Director Danny DeVito plunges into a dark and corrupt world of children's television in New York City.  Robin Williams gives an intense performance as a popular performer for children who loses his throne in disgrace, and is supplanted by an arrogant hippie who tries to clean up the way business is done.
The caper soon involves multiple plots against the life of  ""Smoochy,"" the mealticket with a conscience.  Involved in the intrigues and counter-intrigues are cynical network executives, the Irish mafia, a villainous charity organization, and a disgraced performer who is now homeless and deranged with anger.  Meanwhile, the granola-brained Smoochy (played by Edward Norton) conceives of a narcissistic and horrendous ice show that completely sends up our culture of spectacle and self-involved commercial ""art.""

Having two children of my own, it is a rare occasion to see a movie and I have to be picky-choosy. Well, I ended up seeing it even with low expectations, and I can honestly say that I was flabergasted to see negative reviews for this film.
First off, if you couldn't guess by looking at the poster for the film, this is not a children's film. With this in mind, if you have ever had to sit in front of the TV watching some ridiculous show with your children, which they seem to love, this is the movie for you. Be forewarned however, if you are offended easily this is one you may want to miss. Devito doesn't hold back on anything in this one.

The cast had Robin Williams(Mrs. Doubtfire)Edward Norton(Fight Club,Keeping the Faith)and Danny DeVito(Throw Mamma from the Train,War of the Roses)
The Story:Rainbow Randolf(Robin Williams) was the star of his own children show on KidNet called Rainbow Randolf. Everybody loved him untill he was accused of bribary. When KidNet was trying to replace him they decided to use a purple rhino named Shelden or Smoochy(Edward Norton) who plays at hospitals etc. A worker at KidNet named Nora(Caraline Keener)meets Shelden and Shelden is so happy to be on tv. His way of life is too eat healty and donate money and make people happy about life. Nora and him have some sort of a disagreement about everything. Shelden gets an agent(Danny DeVito)and he tries to get profits because he has been involved with a mob scheme that wants Smoochy's money from an ice show that Shelden never agreed to. Meanwhile Randolf has been homeless and living with a former co-star of his show. He decided that he has to take down Smoochy and become famous again.

In order to enjoy these types of movies, a person has to find humor in satire.  This movie is a classic in my mind.  I felt like it was well put together and has terrific cinematography.  It's definately a lot of fun to watch and has a lot of memorable lines.  Edward Norton is right on with his prissy naive character and Robin Williams in brilliant in his fowl-mouthed, dark, and as usual, his insane role.  However, Katherine Keener's role was not impressive.  She seemed to drift in and out of her character and gave little to nothing to this movie. But she didn't ruin it.  It still succeeded to entertain!  With a great cast of minor roles as well: particularly Michael Rispoli as the dim-witted ex-boxer!  He was more memorable to me than Williams or Norton.  I laughed until I nearly cried.  Keep an open mind and if you enjoy satire--this film is for you!",1018051200,6,1036,4.505376344086022
1742339,5,B00006CXHZ,"I don't think I've ever laughed harder than at ""Death to Smoochy.""  The critics really missed the boat on this one - I guess only indie films are supposed to be dark and twisted.  Danny DeVito has an all star cast (Ed Norton, Robin Williams, Catherine Keener, Jon Stewart, and himself), an enormous budget, and a script that's far too good for Hollywood.  Between Keener's one-liners, Norton's naive saintliness, and Williams' breakneck insults, it's almost too much to handle.  There are so many clever comedians here that the film suffers from a joyous excess.  DeVito has also managed to do something that no one before him could - he normalizes Robin Williams.  Within the gleefully insane context of the movie, Williams is as normal as anyone, or at least reasonably cracked, rather than completely out of place.  A warning: this is not a movie for A) anyone who can remember having been offended, B) anyone who thinks that satire has to have a moral, or C) children.  This is slapstick of the highest order.  It exists solely to make adults laugh.  Imagine the Coen Brothers directing a Tex Avery cartoon, and you'll begin to get the idea.",1018051200,18,1145,4.766497461928934

  This movie, about the dark side of childrens entertainment, is funny as hell and I think that Danny Devito is really growing on me as a director.  Robin Williams is excellent in it as Rainbow Randolph, a drunken childrens show host that has been fired for taking paola.  Williams really shines in this role and gives one of his funniest film performances since Terry Gilliams ""The Fisher King"".  Edward Norton is one of my favorite actors, and he is great in this as a happy go-lucky barney wannabe.
  Now let's get back to the funny as hell remark.  The comedy isn't for everybody.  It's not that gross out comedy nor is it a laugh a minute comedy.  It's just a flat out good comedy, which I think have been running in short supply theese days.

1742376,2,B00006CXHZ,"Robin Williams, who once again plays an odd big kid, has given up on challenging himself. He proves this in Death to Smoochy. Although it was entertaining at certain parts, and Edward Norton once again played a wierd part (a la Fight Club), the acting and humor could have been much better. Robin revisits some of his past accents from Mrs. Doubtfire and his flambouant brother from Mrs. Doubtfire (Harvey Fierstein) plays a mob boss/kids fundraiser director.
The costumes in the movie, although imaginative, were a throwback to ""Barney and Friends""and ""Captain Kangaroo"" Danny Devito directed this film and I belive he wrote it also.

1742378,5,B00006CXHZ,"Robin Williams in perhaps the single most vicious, despicable, and possibly the very funniest role of his entire career. Edward Norton as a soy-dog devouring ""bottle of pancake syrup with legs"". Danny Devito as a low-down greaseball. Okay, two surprises and one standard role. All three shine in this Devito-directed self-proclaimed 'black comedy', which has sparked protests from parents nationwide. Why? Don't ask me. Despite the R rating in the US and the equivalent rating of AA (Adult Accompaniment) in Canada, there actually seem to be some twits out there who will take their kids to see this simply because kiddie shows happen to be the subject material. Therefore, I will warn you now: THIS IS NOT A CHILDREN'S MOVIE. That said, it's a hilarious satire of the world of children's television and a very satisfying parody of Barney the Dinosaur. (At last!) It's also just a thoroughly enjoyable story that only gets better the second time. It has a bumper crop of corrupt, nasty villains, including the gravel-voiced Harvey Fierstein. It has enough platitudes and slipped-in health tips from Norton's free-spirited character to make anybody sick. It even has a costumed Elvis Stojko doing what he does best-- figure skating. In other words, this is one movie I may not let my kids see, but I'll be staying up late to watch it myself again and again.",1017532800,14,1356,4.951754385964913
1742379,3,B00006CXHZ,"I saw Robin Williams on David Letterman, and he plug his new movie ""Death to Smoochy"". Great. Robin William is FUNNY. So, Why not go and checkout this movie. Well, I can only say one thing ""Disappointing""! Robin Williams said in the interview that Danny Devito directed the movie and compared him to ""a troll without a bridge"". Yea, without a bridge to the audience. I took a date with me to watch this movie. HUGE MISTAKE. We watched the first thirty minutes or so. BORING AND ANNOYING! If you have ever been tortured by your five year old brother or cousin or relative watching Barney or any other stupid, annoying sing-a-long bullcrap. Well, brace yourself because that is what your in for most of the first thirty minutes. The only semi-funny part is when Edward Norton is being scouted by a women to replace the reject Robin William character, and he is singing to drug addicts to help keep them from relapsing (the lyrics are some what ironically funny). I had no problem with Robin Williams acting or Edward Norton's acting, but the movie itself. After thirty trying minutes, we left and watched another movie. The date drastically improved!
Quick over run of the first 30 mins.: Robin is the star of the children's network tv. He does a show like Barney or something along those lines. He gets busted taking bribe money to get kids in the show. The parents pay a lot of money to get on (the more air time and the closer the more they pay I assume). He's in this restaurant, and he gets stung by the FBI via a sting operation. The news gets a hold of it. He gets kicked. They (this corporate board) tell the producer to get a squeaky clean guy. The have a hard time going down the list. The come up on Edward Norton. They scout him. He is singing to drug addicts, and is doing a good thing. This guy is too good and clean. He ends up annoying the regular people at his new work place but does the show perfectly without a hitch. He takes over the show, and the show goes on. The kids love it. Robin is without a job and money. He begs the producer (who meets him in secret) to give him some money for old time and sake and begs for his job, too. He recieves nothing and gets mad. Norton's character is good that he doesn't want to sell to all the toys and tie in junk they usually sell. He wants to send out a good message. Basically when we left. Norton was a good guy on top of the world, and he is getting on the nerves of his money grubbing co-workers and bosses. Robin William's character has hit rock bottom with no money or home. He has lost his golden ticket to the good life of women, money, and luxaries. He sets out to get back on top.
Enough of the chit-chat. Wait to rent this movie and checkout some other movie at the theater. Beware of all the annoying barney sing-along .... Sorry, Robin Williams and Edward Norton. This is the first movie that I can recall that I didn't like or hold in high regard. I have to say it's not they're fault. It just the movie itself. Maybe, If they cut out all the annoying singing stuff then it would be better.",1017532800,,3067,4.298791018998273
1742380,2,B00006CXHZ,"There's a scene about halfway through ""Death to Smoochy"" in which Robin Williams and Ed Norton are cruising in a car through the streets of New York City.  Judging by the fullness of the foliage and the ways in which the people are dressed, we can ascertain that the scene was shot sometime in the spring or summer.  Yet, by the time the car has arrived at its destination, the setting is engulfed in a full-on blizzard, appropriately enough since the film does indeed take place in a wintertime Manhattan.
This seemingly minor technical discrepancy is actually emblematic of the carelessness and cluelessness that have gone into the making of this black comedy misfire, written by Adam Resnik and directed by Danny De Vito.  Pity the two unlucky stars who are stuck playing rival kiddie show hosts who find themselves involved in a battle from which only one can emerge victorious.  Williams portrays Rainbow Randolph Smiley, on camera, a beaming, saccharine purveyor of upbeat lessons in morality and life, off camera, a foulmouthed, amoral moneygrubber who gets busted for taking payola from some undercover agents posing as parents desperate to get their child a coveted spot on Smiley's TV show.  Norton plays Smoochy, a down-on-his-luck, wannabe star whose moral mtier is the exact opposite of Smiley's.  He is decent, kind and honest to a fault, a man who balks at all the corporate exploitation of children done in the name of entertainment and profit.  When Smoochy is hired to be Smiley's replacement, the mentally unbalanced has-been launches a diabolical crusade to undercut the rising star's ascent to the top and to regain his own lost position of prominence in the hearts and minds of his adoring fans and the corporate execs and sponsors who happen to pay the bills.
It's sort of hard to know what exactly those involved with this enterprise really thought they were doing.  The corrupt world of so-called ""children's entertainment""- where more money is spent trying to get the tykes and their parents to buy tie-in products than in trying to instill strong moral values into the intended audience - is certainly rife for some clear-eyed deconstruction.  ""Death to Smoochy,"" however, fails at every level - the prime problem being that there is not a single laugh to be found anywhere in the movie.  Any attempt to bring pop-eyed gangsters, hired hit men and Nazi storm troopers into a satire about a kiddie show in crisis had better know what it is doing from the outset.  ""Death to Smoochy"" never gets a sure footing.  Smiley and Smoochy are too broadly drawn to be very interesting or effective as characters and the humor generally consists of people cussing at one another while an innocent, angelic Smoochy looks on in finger-wagging disapproval.  The low point of the movie occurs when a deranged Smiley waves a giant cookie made in the shape of a penis right in the faces of a group of astonished children while he enumerates each and every one of the terms commonly associated with that object.  This seems to be a new low even for Hollywood, which obviously no longer acknowledges the existence of any line separating what is appropriate for adults from what is appropriate for children.
Typical for a mainstream film that presumes to dabble in the area of ""dark"" comedy, ""Death to Smoochy"" turns all soft, cuddly and righteous at the end.  Yet, what a film of this sort needs is a hard edge, a willingness to go all the way into the realm of iconoclastic satire and not want the audience to pat it on the back as it leaves the theatre...
