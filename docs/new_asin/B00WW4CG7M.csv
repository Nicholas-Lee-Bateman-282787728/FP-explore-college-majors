8714506,5,B00WW4CG7M,"Sweet Old World is a film about overcoming one's own ghosts and starting a new life, without forgetting your old one. I was moved by the journey the characters had to go through in order to become whole again. It is a hard theme to talk about and even more so to make a compelling film out of. I recommend it to everyone that is going though a period of grief and wants to feel supported!",1449446400,,388,4.118421052631579
