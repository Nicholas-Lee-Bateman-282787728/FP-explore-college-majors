3850518,5,B002612S4W,"If you know who she is, you need to get this. If you don't know who she is, you need to get this! Lola Falana does a wonderful job on these four specials. Her cast of guests captures a specific time in American history and her showmanship is amazing.
Get this before someone tries to tell you it never happened!",1357430400,4,311,4.2
3850519,4,B002612S4W,I purchased this for my mother who was a good friend of Lola's and she loved it. Sometimes you have to be reminded of the wonderful life you've lived and watching this DVD took my mother there.,1315526400,,193,4.243243243243243
3850520,5,B002612S4W,"I remember Lola Falana from when I was a kid in the 70's, and knew she was a great dancer and singer, but I don't think I ever realized how fabulously fantastic this multi talented lady actually was. She is what I consider the ultimate triple threat. She can dance, sing, act, and her comedic timing is pretty good.

These DVDs captures her 4 legendary specials which exploded on network television in 1976.  Among some of her guest stars are: Bill Cosby, Hal Linden, Billy Dee Williams, Sonny and Cher, Redd Foxx, Dick Van Dyke, and relatively new comedian at the time, Gabrial Kaplan.

The dance numbers are fantastic, most notable ""I Am Love,"" and an African dance which appears on the second DVD, choreographed by the late Lester Wilson.  Among the dancers, who are exceptionally strong and rhythmic, you will see the late Micahel Peters, who went on to later choreograph ""Thriller"" for Michael Jackson.

Miss Falana belts out timeless classics such as ""Lady Marmalade,"" ""I Wanna Be Where You Are,"" and ""Stop In The Name of Love"" to name a few.  Although, Diana Ross had hits before Lola Falana and was a star in her own right, you can't help but see how much stronger Lola Falana was in comparison as an all around performer.

The Lola Falana show aired when prime-time varitey shows were all the rage.  Once you check this DVD you will see why Lola, an eloquent but unpretentious consummate performer, was once the highest-paid female performer in Las Vegas.",1282348800,11,1464,4.713725490196079
3850521,5,B002612S4W,"This was a very nice venture back in time and to enjoy the youthful looks of such artful guest.  We certainly have enjoyed the talents of  Mr. Cosby and others throughout the years. Although Lola is into a different blessed world today, she helped set the bar for many to follow.",1271116800,4,279,4.450980392156863
3850522,5,B002612S4W,"I have always loved and admired glamorous Lola Falana dating back to her small role in the 1970 movie, ""The Liberation of L.B. Jones.""  During the early 1970s, if you saw a black woman on a television, it was probably Lola -- it seemed like she was a guest on all the top-rated talk and game shows, as well as various other popular television variety shows.  Because of Miss Falana's extremely high popularity, ABC first signed her to do two variety show specials.  I was very excited to see her television specials when they debuted in 1976 and enjoyed re-watching them again on this DVD. At the time, ABC already had hugely popular prime-time television shows like, ""Happy Days,"" ""Laverne & Shirley,"" ""Welcome Back Kotter,"" and ""Starsky and Hutch.""  Miss Falana's first two specials were such a hit, ABC decided to re-sign her to do two more shows.

The DVDs contain all four variety show specials; the picture and sound are crystal clear. If there was anyone who could be epitomized as a triple-threat in the entertainment business, it would have to be Lola Falana. I particularly enjoyed the acting skits she did with her guest stars. Ventriloquist Willie Tyler and his dummy Lester, along with Pat Morita (""Happy Days"" and ""Karate Kid"" fame) were regular cast members on the specials. Other celebrities shown during the shows are: Dinah Shore, Art Carney, Dennis Weaver, Gabe Kaplan, and Hal Linden.

I agree with a previous reviewer's comment concerning Diana Ross.  I'm sure over the years, a lot of people have compared her to Miss Ross.  I had thoughts of Miss Ross while watching this DVD; however, Miss Falana has always been my favorite between the two stars. Miss Falana really knew how to mesmerize audiences with her non-stop energy. She would routinely leave the stage and go out into her audience to give them an up-close look.  The colorful wardrobe she performed in were absolutely stunning and very extravagant.  Miss Falana is diminutive in stature; however, when you watched her perform, she was head and shoulders above her contemporaries. This was further validated when she went on to become the highest paid female entertainer in Las Vegas.  If you are a fan of Miss Falana, this DVD two-disc set would be a great addition to your collection.",1265587200,23,2268,4.849740932642487
3850523,5,B002612S4W,"Lola Falana is fantastic! She is the ultimate performer who can sing, dance, and make us laugh. Sexy! Sexy! Like any true diva Miss Falana embraces her gay fans by giving us just what we want...like the Ikettes in drag or when she plays a drag queen lawyer in a funny jailhouse skit. Hilarious!

Her face, voice, mannerism, and style sometimes make me think I am seeing and hearing Diana Ross, especially when she's singing ""Ain't No Mountain High Enough"".  It's uncanny...and a bit unnerving!  I have always wanted to see Lola perform since she was crowned Queen of Vegas, so I am very grateful for this DVD.  Thanks!",1265414400,2,618,4.6422018348623855

She was as good as Diana Ross, and that is high praise. If you love 70s this is superb.
