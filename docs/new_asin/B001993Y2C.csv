3429728,5,B001993Y2C,"This isn't a big long review, because I don't do many. But this series is a must see, especially those who are Trekkies and Star Wars fans. I watched the entire series from day one 'with few eceptions' and I could not stand to hardly miss a new episode. The SciFi channel almost ruined it by their off again, on again presentation methods. but I prevailed. So watching from the beginning without all the breaks and commercials will be ""Great"". So I can hardly wait for it's release. For Blu-ray the price is not that bad, regular DVD would save us all a lot of $$$'s though. Whether you wait for a while OR buy it now is up to you and your budget. But you won't be disappointed whenever you do buy The Complete Series.",1240876800,6,718,4.286764705882353
3429729,5,B001993Y2C,"Im writing this review on the series and not specifically the Blu-Ray release (as I have not seen the product myself). Of all the shows and series Ive watched over the years, this is by and far one of (if not THE) best I have seen. Its a wonderful series start to finish, even if you didn't end up quite where you thought you would in the beginning. One of the best things about this show was that its a great character study of the human condition. The story truly transcends being a ""scifi"" show and becomes something much more. Even my girlfriend (who tends to dislike scifi simply for being scifi) ended up loving this show. This is a must see series.

And if all that wasn't enough of a reason to watch it, the series finale was. Rarely does a series with this much following end in a truly satisfying manner. It may not have ended exactly as I had hoped, but the quality and depth of storytelling in the finale MORE than overcomes any disagreement in the end of the story. I cant say that Ive ever actually enjoyed a series finale before this one, and this one was so good I actually was ok with the show ending. All in all 5 stars isn't enough of a rating for this series.

The addition of The Plan to this collection fixes the complaint I had about the original release of the ""complete series"" as it hadnt even aired at that time.  Ive read a number of complaints about how ""unwieldy"" the box is to this set, but from what Ive seen it isn't any bigger or ungainly than the boxes for other collections like The Matrix trilogy, Band of Brothers, Rome, or Generation Kill.  In some ways thats neither here nor there, but I thought I would point it out.",1240531200,,1658,4.287539936102236
3429730,1,B001993Y2C,"I really enjoyed the series.  BUT, how can anyone rate a product that hasn't been released and doesn't tell you what you're getting? The advertised run time is only 180 minutes.  That's 3 hours.  I certainly hope it's a typo.  if it includes all 4 seasons and the movies, then it's worth it.  Otherwise, it's hard to tell what they will give you.  Remember what they did to us for season 2 and season 4?  I won't consider this product until they list what's really included.  Besides, is it just me, or has the cost of Blu-Ray movies  jumped up about $5 this past year (about 30%!)?  Somebody is getting awfully greedy out there ... and corporate greed is why our economy is nearly collapsing.",1240358400,6,693,4.472
3429731,1,B001993Y2C,"a real kick in the arse to the fans who made them rich. this set should LIST at no more than $200 tops

3429732,5,B001993Y2C,"Those that read my pre-review for the ""Star Wars Trilogy on Blu-ray"" (if you haven't read it yet, by all means, please DO...it's right at the top of the respective page...and it's pretty darn funny too...) know that I'm not one to *not* speak my mind on Sci-Fi stuff...

...but this time I'm going to do you a favor...a big one...

I'm going to simply say, that as much as I am a fan of the original BSG series of the 1970's (and yes, I really do love it, and yes, it's OKAY to like BOTH series), and this newer BSG has just about nothing in common with it, as it's a complete re-imagining of the series, I'm going to say as both a fan, and a TV professional, that based on my love of Sci-Fi, Fantasy (and comic books for that matter), as well as a huge appreciation of great acting, great casting, great special effects, and above all, great writing and consitantly excellent production values, that if there was ever ONE TV series that I can recommend to fans without question, it is this newer version of Battlestar Galactica.

Without  hesitation...without question...without an afterthought of regret...

Best...series...ever.

I know it's not cheap, but I assure you, you'll thank me.

If you have a beautiful daughter between the ages of 18-27 with questionable moral values, you might even send her over to thank me.

If you have nobody in your family to leave a large cash/real estate inheritance to when you pass-away, you might even put my name in the will to thank me.

If you're in the casting-department of any future Battlestar Galactica-related shows, you might not throw my headshot/resume in the garbage and actually consider me for a role in a future project as a way to thank me.

If you accidentally hit the ""buy it now"" button twice, and now don't know who to give your extra set of BSG-The Complete Series (Blu-ray) to as a gift, you might just send it to me as a way to thank me.

So...Have you added it to your Amazon shopping cart yet?
Hurry up...pure bliss awaits...

I'll be at Comic-Con...and I'll save a seat for your beautiful daughter...

3429733,5,B001993Y2C,"Like so many people on line at the moment, I was one of those people that grew up through the STAR WARS era.  And like those ones I remember watching BSG on ITV here in the UK at the weekends.  I really enjoyed it as a boy.  It was full of exciting action, brilliant models, FX that looked like STAR WARS FX, a sense of loyalty and friendship that my emerging personality was starting to experience in real life as well as really pretty girls in tight military uniforms!

Now, 30 years have passed and new BSG has been and now gone.  The one of the differences on this occasion is that the show was allowed to run its course.  The whole story was told from start to finish, thank you BABYLON 5.

And like BABYLON 5, the new BSG demonstrates that not everything is quite how it seems.  The very clear blacks and whites of the original BSG are nowhere near as clearly defined as they once were.  There is alot of grey in there, wherein most of actual real life seems to take place.  There are freindships tested to the limit, there are peolpe who feel inadequate to the jobs but have to do them anyway, there is a huge amount of bad decision making as a well as out-and-out back stabbing betrayal and murder.  There are conflicted interest and personalities as well as insanity and despair.

But the thing that binds it all together is the story.  Over four years, the story has had us (us being my wife and myself) excited, angry, disappointed, amused, happy, sad, confused, let down, depressed, enlightened, shocked, surprised, baffled and amazed.  All the things that real life does to a person.

Like all good SF, Mr Moore and his staff have taken all the elements of life and the things that affect us as people and wrapped them in an SF cover.  He has woven a story that includes those affectations and given us four years of great TV.

If you took all the SF elements away from this show (and I think the aforementioned BABYLON 5), it would probably still work as a war drama, because the show is about the people being affected and NOT the actual space battles or how big the explosions were, or how good the costumes looked.

From now on, there is a third all-time-favourite show in my mind to share equal billing with CLASSIC STAR TREK and BABYLON 5.",1240099200,8,2258,4.4
3429734,5,B001993Y2C,"My title says it all.  From start to finish, the scope of the story line, the casting, the direction, the special effects (although the CGI could have been SLIGHTLY better on some of the cylons - it's some of the best we'll ever see), the intensity, the drama, the dynamics between characters, and everything else, this is simply the best series that has been on television.

You don't buy Sci-Fi?  No problem.  I know MANY people, including my wife (who is also a professional actress and particularly critical of actors and film in general), was mesmerized by the whole series from the pilot miniseries on.  She watched with me, thinking she was humoring my inner geek, and was blown away.  She was not a fan of the original series, and neither am I.  The earlier series was trivial; especially by comparison.  Every episode left my stomach in knots!

If you don't watch this show somehow, somewhere, you're missing out.  I heard many television critics (who do not favor scifi) who also referred to some of the single episodes as ""the best episode of any television series I've ever seen.""

Seriously... 5 stars isn't nearly enough.  I can NOT exaggerate this enough, because no matter how impressive I tell you it is, you won't only be disappointed but you'll be AMAZED at how great it is when you do see the show.",1240012800,4,1318,4.658008658008658
3429735,5,B001993Y2C,"From the first frakin scene, BSG has provided us with a consistently interesting, well written, superbly acted, and thought provoking Sci Fi TV Show.  Yes, the Battlestar was a huge spaceship however, as a Veteran of the US Navy, I can tell you that every time we were treated to shots inside the Gallactica, I was reminded of my old ship.  I know from listening to interviews, this was what the producers wanted.  They wanted Gallactica to resemble an Aircraft Carrier, in space.  They succeeded.

The writing, was always top notch, as the team on BSG produced one terrific show after another.  I grew to care about the characters.  As I watched the series, I grew more and more interested in the plight of  the last of humanity.  The series began with just under 50000 humans as they searched the galaxy for their new home world.  All the while, they were running from the Cylons.  Cylons were robots built by humans who turned on their masters.  Some resembled walking ""Toasters"", and others were nearly perfect copies of human beings.  This group of models were known as ""Skin-Jobs"".  A couple of them even looked like cat walking models......  Earth was a planet written about in their scriptures.  Religion was based upon Greek Gods and Goddesses, making this portion a lot of fun for those of us who enjoy the mythology of the past.

Unlike other shows I have seen to their end, BSG left many unanswered plot twists and questions.  This will allow for specials, movies and other BSG dramas as the years fly by.

I am looking forward to buying the final 1/2 season once it's released on DVD. After all, I own seasons 1-4 and REALLY enjoy re-watching the shows.  This is a major point to be considered.  Not every show is written so we actually enjoy seeing it several times, BSG is not one of these.

If this is the first time you will be watching BSG, buying the DVD is a great way to get to know this show.  In fact, it's how I first became acquainted with this show.  I was told about the show by a friend at work, so I bought the first and second seasons in order to ascertain my interest in the show, as I had never watched it on TV.

From the first few minutes watching the DVDs, I was hooked!  I've since purchased every season, and enjoy them still.

If you have even a passing interest in Sci Fi, BSG will rock your world.  Take the plunge!  Learn all about Cylons, Capricans, knuckle-draggers, skin-jobs and Viper Jocks.  I promise you, this is the BEST Frakin show to date and well worth the money.",1238112000,6,2515,4.487858719646799

I still have to spend more money elsewhere to get the complete episodes.  If it wasn't for the missing episode it would have been money well spent.

3429753,4,B001993Y2C,"If you are looking for a cost-effect way to watch this series, then this is a good value. Remember that this TV series was at the dawn of the blu-ray era, so at times, you get enhanced images of broadcast quality. This means that on newer TVs you will see all the warts of the broadcast version in detail. It's not a big deal when you consider the historical context.

As for the series itself, it is definitely for adults and it lacks the charm of the original series. The difference between this series and the original series is that the original series was optimistic. This series by contrast is dark and puts forth a view of predestination. Each is good in its own way, but I prefer the original series.",1523664000,,708,4.404580152671755

The show itself was ok, but to me it was always about what could have been.  The creators were more interested in doing things that other sci-fi/fantasy shows can't do, and forcing the story to do what they wanted, that they seem to have forgotten that the best stories themselves are the ones that seem to be natural.  There were way to many places where the show obviously did something because a writer wanted it that way, but it made no logical sense within the mythology or even within the show.  I will admit though that they kept the whole thing going pretty well.  There were only a few times when I found that I couldn't get into it enough that I had to force myself to keep watching.

I enjoy many of the syfy channel's series where the is a long arc story vs. self contained 45 minute shows. This does NOT include The Plan, but appears to be the mini-series and all of the series episodes. The Bluray transfers look excellent although I see the rare occasional transfer issue, not sure if that would be on the more expensive silver packaged box set, but it is rare and not even noticeable.

Specifically, there is a U that stays in the lower right hand corner of the screen constantly, and an 'oracle' icon that appears above that.  Added to this annoyance, interactive 'character profiles' constantly appear in the upper left hand corner of the screen with large and distracting icons that constantly have to be dismissed.

3429870,5,B001993Y2C,"This review is for the Battlestar Galactica: The Complete Series Blu-Ray in the Black Rectangle Box with the ""Blue"" Blu-Ray band around the top. Bar code # 5 050582 708691 1080p HD Widescreen with Eng DTS-HD 5.1 master audio. This came with the entire series, including Razor. Their is also several Extended Editions to some of the Episodes, including an Much Better Expanded and Longer Version of the Final Season ending Episodes.
I selected the Seller; A-B-C Titles & Media and paid $40. I was skeptical about this for such a low price, but was absolutely amazed at the deal I got.
Received my order on Dec 12th  and just completed watching all the discs by Dec 20th, I had no problems with any disc. They were played on my PS4 Pro system with an LG 65"" OLED TV and played the DTS-HD 5.1 Audio Via an Optical link thru my Onkyo THX 7.1 Surround system. I did read some reviews complaining about some slight ""Grain"" effect on the first couple of episodes and knowing that, I did noticed the same thing. So I will have to assume that this was part of the production, as it was not the fault of the disc or his player. However, its not that noticeable and I probably would have not really known it had I not read that review. The surround was very good, but not really Theater quality, as i'm sure most made for TV shows don't really put a lot of time and money into it. Overall and especially for the price I am completely satisfied with this box set.",1513900800,2,1451,4.374074074074074

Main characters here are JERKS AND ONE DIMENSIONAL NO BALANCE!

Too much soap opera not enough space,battle or stars!

Everyone has BUNNY SYNDROME, HOPPING AND SCREWING ALL OVER THE PLACE.

NOT ENOUGH ORIGINAL CHARACTERS RICHARD HATCH NEEDED A BIGGER PART,WOULD LOVE TO HAVE SEEN DIRK BENEDICT AND BOOMER!

TERRIBLE ACTING AND DOESN'T HAVE THE CHEMISTRY BETWEEN CHARACTERS, UNLESS YOU CONSIDER ALOT OF  VAN WILDER  MAKE OUT SCENES, CHEMISTRY!

WHERE IS BOOMER?OH A GIRL NOW ,HATE IT! SCREWING SOME GUY MECHANIC NOW! WTF

STARBUCK OH A GIRL NOW, OVER COMPENSATING AS STARBUCK NOW,BASICALLY TRYING TO ACT LIKE A MAN! SOON TO BE SCREWING APOLLO, WTF!

Finally got it to play with another laptop. No issues playing all other disks in all players. Thirdly and most irritating was the fact that the words ""Battlestar  Galactica"" (in their trademarked format) appeared randomly in the bottom righthand corner of the screen - taking up at least 10% of the screen.

3429880,4,B001993Y2C,"Great series, but you may have to upgrade your Blu-Ray player to watch it. It wouldnt play in any of the three players in my house, so I bought a $69 player to be able to try to watch it before returning the discs to Amazon.

My older players were continually updated on the internet, so it wasn't a software version issue. Also, I couldn't find the discs in a store, and since I loved the show when I saw it originally, I was reluctant to return it before trying everything else first.

It does play on a Sony player made in 2017. Just be aware that this compatibility issue could affect you if you have an older player with an older operating system.

The whole pain in the rear factor makes me long for the old days of just shoving a tape in a VCR and hitting play. (Not really, but it is a shame that plug and play is such a rare event as technology progresses.)

The second version of the Battlestar series sparked a new-wave of gritty, realities sci-fi... for better or worst.  If you don't like high drama, with less of an emphasis on sci-fi, this isn't the show for you.  This is more about human drama over morality and cool gadgets and space battles.  That being said, Battlestar was revolutionary in bringing more sci-fi properties into the mainstream, and for that it deserves some credit.

I have had a cheap, dvd quality set that just looked garbage and I wanted to upgrade to Bluray. This set is probably the best priced for the series, and looks great too.

Disc navigation is easy to use, except I would have liked a 'play all' button on the main menus. You do have to navigate to the 'episodes' page to find it. The box set does have standard sized Bluray cases inside, just in case you don't want to use the box to store. An included booklet gives you a quick synopsis of each episode, and some other little tidbits.

3429923,5,B001993Y2C,"An awesome series, of course. The BluRay is excellent. Interface is pretty dated in functionality, UI and design. Loads slowly and you have to page across episode groups, which has a very 2001 feel to it. With PS4 you can scene-skip all of the loading screens, studio into and even the ridiculous FBI-warning screen. Press R1 5 times.

Some slight confusion is in the season 4 case. It contains, 3 total discs (as labeled directly on each disc):
Disc 1 (first 5 episodes)
Disc 2 (last 4 episodes)
Razor Disc (Razor epsiodes, unrated, extended)

The box lists these as:
Disc 1: Razor
Disc 2: [Episodes 1-5]
Disc 3: [Episodes 6-10]
These are incorrect as noted above. For some reason the Razor disc was also in the second disc page, just to make matters even more random.

3429950,5,B001993Y2C,"""Battlestar Galactica"" (2004) is one of those rare cases where a reboot more than matches up against the original (classic).  By now, most people are aware of the series and the high quality production and storytelling that it contains.  Thus, I won't focus so much on recapping the whole story but mainly focus on the package itself as well as a small list of why I particularly enjoy this series.

CONTENT ISSUES:
One thing needs to be said though, there are moments of love making in a few of the episodes (it's not a huge focus [nor long]...but it helps set the some of the character relationships as well as the social mindsets of the period...and in one instance is an important plot point).  So just a fair warning...Oh, and some coarse language is involved as well.

WHAT I LIKE ABOUT BSG:
1.  One of the things I like about the series is, like it's original source material, that it deals with multiple themes about loyalty, fear, divinity, humanity, touch choices, and tons more.  And it deals with it smartly and often with great character development.
2.  I also appreciate how it presents tough choices having to be made.  In times of great strife, it's not always possible to make the ""perfect choice"".  But in the end, people have to learn to make the best choice...and the choices that they will not regret and line up with a strong moral compass.  And I appreciate that we do feel the weight of these decisions through the characters making them since they present and act it so well.
3.  The fact that this isn't a ""science-saves-the-day"" (a la star trek) kind of show is somewhat refreshing as far as sci-fi shows go.  This is a tale about humanity fighting for survival suddenly after a period of complacency and peaceful ""softening"".
4.  This show seriously has some of the most epic space battle sequences seen in both film and especially television.
5.  And along with the above, the attention to detail on the ships and overall setting is really immersive and amazing to behold.

THE PACKAGE:
So, since there is some confusion about packages and imports, I included pictures of the edition I have so that we're clear.  There's photos of front and back, as well as the Blu-ray contents inside.  But basically, with all the different packages for the series, I chose this one largely because of the price.  This is not the ""American"" released edition but an official import from Europe (not quite sure which countries specifically) distributed by Universal.  So you don't have to fear...this is the real deal in Blu-ray.

What's included:
1.  All episodes (with both ""broadcast"" and ""extended"" versions for the episodes that have them) from all seasons of BSG
2.  Unfortunately, of all the BSG movies, it only has ""Razor"" (both broadcast and extended versions).  ""The Plan"" and ""Blood & Chrome"" are not included.
3.  There are tons of special features on each disk...too much to really list.
4.  Has a small booklet with brief summaries of some of the key characters and and episode list with brief episode summaries and special features listings.
5.  This is an ""ALL REGION"" set, so it works in pretty much all players.  I used a player from the USA and it worked perfectly.",1498003200,15,3197,4.722021660649819

3429980,3,B001993Y2C,"I enjoyed this show back when it was on and finally decided to spend the money to purchase it on bluray.
Haven't watched them all but picture looks grainy sometimes during dark scenes and many interior scenes on Galactica. I don't recall that when it was on TV. Don't understand why they couldn't have done a better transfer.
Some of the discs fell out of the case too due to broken locking tabs. That sucks when you open a case and they just fall out.
Enough about the quality but that's why I dinged this set two stars.
I got into this show big time when it came out. Being a fan of the  original I was somewhat skeptical of this reimagining. Didn't take long to get over my skepticism.
Bringing the late Richard Hatch on to the show  was brilliant. Tom Zarek was a great character that had a great arc and a great ending.
I only wish more actors from  the original Battlestar Galactica would have made an appearance.
Battlestar is dark and gritty sci-fi that dealt with subjects of the day like torture and over reaching executive powers. The moral dilemmas faced by characters on the show were handled brilliantly. When Tigh poisons his own wife that's one of the most powerful morally ambiguous moments of the show. This version of Battlestar Galactica reset the bar for science fiction shows that have come after. It told a large and complex story that does have an ending. There are lots of areas where more story could be told. Lots of unanswered questions too. Such as just where did Starbuck go and with who? What was she in the end?
Truthfully those are just minor quibbling points.
LOL.
This particular set includes the pilot miniseries. Also has Razor, The Plan,  and several extended episodes. The Resistance webisodes are here too.  Lots of deleted scenes.
Overall, the amount of content included with this set is impressive.
Set is highly recommended despite the quality issues. It's not as if there's another way to get Battlestar Galactica in high definition so you have to live with it.",1491004800,,2005,4.636619718309859

3430003,3,B001993Y2C,"Battlestar Galactica is a fantastic series and anyone who considers themselves a fan of science fiction should watch it. This being said, the quality of this set is certainly lacking. First it should be noted that this is an imported version but I have had no trouble playing any of the discs on my North American Xbox One or PS3. I am a big fan of the box in which all the blu-ray cases are contained as it is made of sturdy cardboard and looks good on a shelf. However, the blu-ray cases themselves are of poor quality. They feel flimsy and cheaper than the average case and any case which contained more than two discs had a broken spine. I was able to easily repair this using a small piece of duct tape and some superglue on each case and you wouldn't even know until you looked at the inside of the case. The other issue with this set is the video quality. While it is described as being 1080p resolution, the picture is often ""grainy."" For me personally this is not a huge issue except in the miniseries (the first two extended episodes of the series) as some parts were exceptionally bad looking. While I have not yet watched every episode in full, from what I can tell the rest are considerably better but still not what one might expect from a blu-ray set. In conclusion, anyone purchasing this set should not expect the highest quality product. I paid about $33.00 at the time of purchase and overall I am not dissatisfied with the quality given the price I paid.",1488067200,5,1474,4.422794117647059

3430009,5,B001993Y2C,"I will attempt to split this review into two parts, one for packaging and another for actual reviews.

A) Packaging(Which Blue ray set to purchase)
If  someone is looking to buy Battlestar Galactica Complete series on Blue-ray, they would be inundated with a variety of choices.
There are various blue ray sets available ranging from $36 to about $116.
So which version should one buy while not sacrificing quality of the discs, also saving some considerable money at the same time?
I highly recommend, the $36-$39 Black color ""Import/United Kingdom released, Blu-Ray/Region A/B/C "".
Even though it says Import version, it is region free and plays in the US.
I think since it supports regions A/B/C, it can be played in most of the countries in Asia,Europe and North America etc.
I had no issues in playing this on a Blue-ray player in the USA.
For about $36 the this set is a real deal. It includes the miniseries, all the four seasons.
Special features include, Behind the scenes, Booklet, Box Set, Commentary, Deleted Scenes, Interactive Menu(U Contrrol as marketed by Universal Company).This version costs about $36 to $39 on Amazon and beats all the other versions

There are two other versions available which I think are very expensive
1)Silver Box costs $116
2)Blue-ray Box set costing $114 (with Collectible Cylon)

I paid $36 for the black package, I think the price went up by $3 to about $39 as I write this review, but its still worth it.
The picture quality is great, and I do not see any issues with grainy picture like some other reviews on Amazon suggested.
Now, coming to may be why this box costs less than other versions
This box does not contain the Razor or Plan. It also does not contain Spin off series Caprica/Blood&Chrome.
Most of those expensive Blue-ray sets has these included in it.

But do not fret, one can purchase the Blue-Ray double -feature of Razor/Plan for less that $8 on Amazon.
And as to the spin off series, I don't think its fair to be clubbed together with the simply astounding re imagined series.
If you think you will really like the Spin off series, you can purchase it separately.
Personally I am not planning to purchase the spin off series, but I may watch it if it becomes available for free on Netflix/Amazon Prime etc

B)Reviews for the Series:
All I can say is, if you like science fiction, good thought provocative entertainment and hate all the garbage mindless shows on TV/Movies, this show is for you. One of the greatest shows ever to grace television and frankly, mind blowing.
Watch it already and you will not regret it.",1487635200,6,2583,4.716186252771618
3430010,5,B001993Y2C,"Can't believe the whole series plus the ""season 1"" three hour episode on Blu Ray for this price!  I ordered it and have watched about half.  Yeah, it's all here :)  If you're a fan then grab one of these.",1487635200,,204,4.05
3430011,5,B001993Y2C,"This is a great sci fi series, definitely one of my favorites. In fact, my girlfriend/fiance loved it too, despite the fact that she is not a huge sci fi fan. It combines riveting space battles with character drama, as well as addressing moral/ethical quandaries, such as those a certain Jean Luc Picard might have faced; though the situations in this series were definitely darker than those in ST:TNG.

In regards to the discs themselves, it was hard to navigate the special features. The enclosed booklet reported in which season certain features, such as webisodes, were located, but it did not report which disc to find these features. Finding them required searching through several discs to find the feature we wanted to see.",1487376000,2,732,4.951219512195122

I kept watching hoping it would get better--NO. Boring drivel,the humans were so whiny,I rooted for the Cylons which is ironic,but I won't say why. I'm ashamed that I had to give 1 star.

3430013,5,B001993Y2C,"First of all this is just a review of the product for the UK released region free boxed Blu-ray set, I won't review the series because if you are thinking about watching it and love science fiction the only thing I can say is watch it if you consider yourself a fan of science fiction.  I got this based on the great reviews.  I have wanted BSG on disks for a long time now, but they were always so expensive and I couldn't justify paying the amount per season or the boxed set price they were asking for.  I figured after time the price would go down but it never really has.  With the new release of the complete edition I was hopeful it would be more reasonable but I was again disappointed.  Then I found this UK release.  Why pay $150 for the new boxed set when this one is under $40?  Plus the UK version has the disks very well protected in actual Blu-ray jewel cases instead of the cardboard sleeves.  You heard that right people, actual Blu-ray cases!  It is region free meaning it works with US Blu-ray players, and though I have only binged through season 1 so far, I have had no problems with any of the disks playing in my Sony player.

Some people have posted about the grainy picture quality.  First of all this series began filming in 2004.  It was shot with HD digital film.  Yes film cameras.  The technology for HD was still in its infancy and no amount of re-mastering will be able to perfect a film that was shot in the past.  Also they stylized shots to make it look gritty, this was a cinematographic choice by the makers of BSG to capture the gritty nature of the subject matter and was intentional.  Its much the same thing as HBO did with Band of Brothers.  I have both the original DVD boxed set and the Blu-Ray versions of Band of Brothers, it was intentionally made to be grainy the Blu-Ray re-master is true to that intent.  If it was crystal clear and free of the intentional ""artifact"" in the shots it wouldn't be the same.  BSG's re-master is also true to the original intent of its cinematography.  And on my 55"" LED this copy of BSG looks amazing.  You have to remember that in 2004, almost everyone watching this series on the air was still using a CRT standard def TV.  Its now at the date of this review a 13 year old series.  Its not going to look as crystal clear and fully HD as Game of Thrones, and its not supposed to.",1486944000,8,2361,4.2561797752808985

3430025,1,B001993Y2C,"I love this show, which was shot 2005 to 2009, but I'm only rating the product which is the Blu-ray release. Honestly, it looks like a drunk child threw this BD set together.

The first thing you will notice is that EVERY time you stick in ANY disc you are forced to watched the same speech ""Hi, I'm the Executive Producer and I'm going to force you to see me because I didn't get to be on screen."" Literally the same speech on every disc. Thank the 8 this PGC is skippable but seriously, can't you just be happy being rich? Are you that insecure that you have to trick us into seeing you ON EVERY DISC?!?!?

He continues to go on about how the show was shot in 1st gen hd TAPE as if if were worth bragging that it was shot in 720i which is barely passable as HD before they add all the grain to make it look like trash. He even brags that the broadcast couldn't support their format so this is the first time anyone can see what it's supposed to look like... garbage apparently. After all the grain that was added in post, it seems the aesthetic he was going for was 10th generation VHS bootleg. The scenes that aren't washed in grainy filters still barely pass for DVD standard quality, definitely not BD. There was no attempt to remaster it to BD, it was just dumped onto the discs. The lines are dull where they should be sharp. Even the CG is pixelated! It doesn't even meet the standards for fake HD that cable and streaming services use. Skipping straight to season (4.5) the picture quality improves SLIGHTLY. In fact, the only thing in HD are the menus and screen saver. Given the upconverting quality of DVD players, you actually get a worse picture with the Blu-ray then the DVD. It's really pathetic.

Th next thing you'll notice is that all the menus have 4 episodes but some discs have a 5th one hidden on a different screen if you notice the fine print on the menu

As you continue to watch, even more problems pop up. You watch an episode, stick in the next disc, and the first episode on the next disc is the extended unaired version of the one you just watched. By the time you find out the episode exists, it's too late - you've already watched it once, you don't want to watch it a second time in a row. You are never given the opportunity to see the extended version first. This happens multiple times and the extended version is always on the next disc where it is too late.

Once you get to season 4 THE DISCS ARE LABELED WRONG!!! The cover of S4 case 1 says ""Disc 1, 2, 3"" however, when you open it, Disc 1 is labeled ""Razor"", the movie, disc 2 is labeled as Disc 1, 3 is 2, etc. This is actually the correct order but what happened to the label?

This release is truly embarrassing. It is unbelievable that this is a professional production of a major hit. I would recommend anyone not get this, buy the US release that costs 5x more.",1485734400,14,2859,4.2559852670349905

3430036,5,B001993Y2C,one of the best sci fi series EVER,1484784000,,34,3.375
3430037,5,B001993Y2C,"The original BATTLESTAR GALACTICA from the late 1970s was pretty straightforward:  the humans were the good guys & the machine race known as the Cylons were the bad guys.  The recent Sci-Fi channel reboot series was anything but straightforward.  In fact, if you miss an episode you're bound to get lost;  it is imperative that you watch the episodes in chronological order.

In both series, the humans are descendants of a planet called Kobol.  There are 12 colonies, all on different planets in a solar system.  There is also a legendary 13th colony that is outside the solar system;  a mythical planet known as Earth.  In the original series, it is never divulged as to who created the Cylons, but it was not the descendants of Kobol.  In the reboot, it is clear that the Cylons were created by people.  Ultimately, the Cylons rebelled against their human masters in the style of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Terminator-Blu-ray/dp/B00AJER3SE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Terminator [Blu-ray</a>].  To return the favor, the Cylons create humanoid versions of  Cylons.  There are 8 cloned models and 5 other models which are not cloned.  Like the Tin Man from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wizard-of-Oz-Blu-ray/dp/B00CNW9ZEU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wizard of Oz  [Blu-ray</a>], the Cylons have a grand wish to become human themselves.

The humans have a polytheistic religion which has a large amount of overlap with Greek mythology.  The Cylons, on the other hand, have their own religion that is monotheistic.  The GALACTICA characters have been re-arranged:  Starbuck (Katee Sackoff) is a woman and her version of Starbuck is far more complex than the happy-go-lucky Starbuck portrayed by Dirk Benedict.  Starbuck has a great many demons that she wrestles with.  The most radically different character, however, would be Colonel Tigh.  In the original series, Tigh is an honorable officer who is very by-the-book.  In the reboot, Tigh is an alcoholic and impulsive officer who would not be in the military if not for Commander Adama's pull with the brass.  We find out that Apollo, Starbuck & Boomer are call signs (like with Navy fighter pilots) rather than actual names.

Technologically, the BG humans are similar to us:  they drive Humvees, they shoot guns with bullets, they listen to the radio and they drink coffee.  There is, of course, one salient way in which they are technologically far superior to us:  the BG humans have mastered the art of interstellar space travel.  Their ships have Faster-Than-Light (FTL) drives that they use to ""jump"" from one quadrant in space to another.

A Battlestar is like an aircraft carrier in outer space.  It's primary weaponry is a fleet of fighters known as Vipers.  The interior of a Battlestar is not so very different than the interior of a naval vessel.  The inside of the GALACTICA lacks the futuristic looks of a spaceship from, say, STAR TREK.  The producers even make the terminology for take-offs & landings identical to the verbiage used aboard aircraft carriers.

Socially, the BG humans are very familiar to what we humans on Earth encounter.  They have their flaws, they have a nosey media, they get frustrated with their leaders and they tend to fall in love with people they're not supposed to fall in love with.  The BG reboot paints with a very wide brush and in doing so they struggle with a great many issues that are all-too-human:  fraternization between officers & enlisted folk, military coups, mutinies, class warfare, the role of religion in politics (rightly or wrongly), rigged elections, racism, the treatment of prisoners-of-war, the difference between a lawful order & an unlawful one, etc.

The new series offers us a glimpse into more layers of human interaction /  human ranks than the old one.  Mary McDonnell portrays the head of the Department of Education.  After a Cylon sneak-attack, she is the highest ranking member left in the government, so she becomes President of the colonies.  Mary has a subtle but powerful screen presence.  Unlike the original series, where we only see officers, the reboot has enlisted characters that we get to know, many of which are something akin to Aviation Boatswains Mates on carriers.  Edward James Olmos turns in the performance of his remarkable career as the dignified, introspective Commander Adama.  In the original, Baltar was a typical Benedict Arnold type;  in the reboot his character is far more ambiguous.

The Cylons, too, are far more developed than the robots wandering around in the original.  The Cylons have human-like traits and an affinity for bubble baths  Some Cylon models acquire a distaste for genocide & end up going rogue.

Fans of the original series may love the reboot....or they may hate it.  Keep in mind that the 2 series are not mutually exclusive.  It was an act of pure genius to incorporate Richard Hatch (who played Apollo in the original) as a minor but important character in the new one.  For nostalgia, I just re-watched the original tonight after finishing the box set last night.  Lastly, the original pilot was written by Glen A. Larson and he was also deeply involved in the reboot.  So, for those BG skeptics out there  I would just say to give it a whirl.  The new BG world will seem strange @ 1st but in the end it will seem familiar.",1484784000,,5418,5.146788990825688

This series came out at the very beginning of HD video (I also have season one on HD-DVD) so there are some grainy picture issues, especially in the beginning space station scene, but over all it's not too bad.

Also, the manual/index book thing spoils one of the main cast members being a Cylon!

3430043,5,B001993Y2C,"I'm writing this review in case it is useful to someone, especially due to all the confusion here.
I purchased the ""cheaper"" set in the black box (photo inserted). The set I purchased was new. (https://www.amazon.com/Battlestar-Galactica-Edward-James-Olmos/dp/B0027UY8B8)
I tested one disk from season 5 and one disk from season two on TWO different blu-ray players
1) a PS-3 with all the firmware/system upgrades
2) a 6-year old Sharp TV with built-in Blu-Ray player that has never been upgraded (as far as I know).

The main menu screen took a few seconds to come up (but I think that this is typical of blu-rays disks in general).
Both the episodes as well as the Extras played just fine on both machines and looked beautiful.
When I originally watched the series, I did not own a HD television, so you can definitely see the ""graininess"" that some people mentioned in other reviews. However, with this set a notice is displayed on the screen stating words to the effect of ""the stylized effects are intentional and are true to the broadcast edition"". Now, I can see why people who don't know this may initially think that there is something wrong, but once you know that this is intentional (and it is more noticable in some scenes and barely noticeable in others), it really adds to the beauty of the show.
There is also a second notice displayed stating that if all features do not play, you may need to update your player's firmware.
As mentioned, I did not have any problems with either player (one updated, one not).
Now, I have no way of knowing if the set I received has been ""updated"" from previous reviews and these two notices were added because of the concerns people were having.
I'm not going to list all the contents, but RAZOR is included (two editions - broadcast edition and extended edition).
The movie THE PLAN was not included.

3430044,5,B001993Y2C,"This is one of the best series I've watched. I seen it on Netflix a couple years back before it was pulled off the site e by Universal. The 'grainy' visual effect that some reviews point out as inferior to blu-ray is simply not true. The quality of the video on this set is far superior to the quality on Netflix even at the highest setting. The 'grainy' effect was added as part of the production to help soften the environment and make scenes seem more realistic. Try watching Stargate SG1in high definition and it's almost laughable at times because of the obviousness of the cheap props which weren't apperant back when everyone was watching it in standard definition. Although I like Stargate, the addition of the grainy effect in this Battlestar series makes it far more immersive and realistic even in high definition and despite others complaining of quality loss, I do not see any loss. In fact, I can see every detail in blu-ray quality with the added effect of a soft, barely noticeable grain overlay from time to time.",1484438400,,1030,4.664835164835165

The video quality of this set is really lacking. Very grainy. Some reviewers claim the grainy tone was intentional, and if so whoever made that decision was a moron.
If you have a 4K t.v. this effect is magnified. I didn't pay 2 grand for a state of the art (LG 4K OLED) T.V. so I could watch blu-rays that looked like I was watching T.V. over the air on a '50's T.V. and a cheap set of rabbit ears.

3430054,5,B001993Y2C,"Firstly as most Sci fi fans will agree Battlestar Galactica is the pinnacle of the genre. Gritty and realistic, a space navy soap opera with loads of violence. The reason I'm dropping this review is only on the quality of the blu ray discs. Any of the other reviews can help you decide whether you want to watch or not. I admit after reading some of the reviews after purchase I did sweat a bit. People complaining it's misrepresented and missing discs. People complaining about low resolution, etc, etc. This box set is absolutely top notch. It comes in a really nice glossy cardboard box. Upon opening all the discs were in the correct order and it came with a beautiful glossy booklet that showed the main characters and all the episodes by disc. The episodes are also listed on the back of each disc. Whoever said they weren't is full of it. Upon pulling the discs out they are standard blu ray discs that you have seen a million times. There is nothing cheap or low rate about them. So people complain about low resolution in the video and disc skipping or episodes missing. Because I don't want to be surprised and I'm showing this whole series to my Sci fi loving daughter I meticulously went through each disc. I loaded them into 3 players. My ps4, ps3 and Xbox one. Each disc loaded as quickly as any other blu ray. The menus are loaded with content. Deleted scenes, extras and commentary on each disc. You do have to be vigilant for the extended episodes. Often times they will be on the next disc and I think I speak for most people that are fanatics you would rather watch the extended version so keep an eye out. There is one in season 2, at least one in season 3 and a few in season 4. This set includes the miniseries that started it all and the movie razor in both the aired and unaired version. It also includes the Webisodes from the razor sessions only. The face of the enemy is not on here. I did find it on you tube so you can watch that series for free on there. Also someone mentioned that the movie the plan is on here. Sadly it is not included. I already had it so it was not that big of an issue for me. If you don't have the plan I do suggest picking it up. It's the first couple seasons from the cylons perspective. Also blood and chrome is not included as it came out well after this show wrapped up. Also for the complainers about the grainy film this was the technique they used. The regular dvds have the same film grain. I did not encounter any low res parts or any disc skipping. It's not unheard of for discs to be bad but my set was as advertized. So the bottom line of this review is that the negative reviews are unjustified. I have no earthly clue why this set is priced so low but damn is it a value for one of the best TV shows ever aired. Purchase with absolute confidence and if you do happen to get a dud just make sure to return it within the amazon time window. Thank you for reading my review.

3430094,5,B001993Y2C,"I don't do reviews except for the really important items, and this is one. We purchased the Battlestar Series from Megahit Records a few months ago, and recommend them without reservation. The set was new, pristineand everything a Battlestar fan from any era could wish. All discs were without defect, except for some portions in the first disc containing the mini-series, likely encoding arifacts from the original digital master recordings, when the mini-series was filmed then later reencoded for transfer to Bluray. The series was filmed at about 2K, not 4K, which has lead some fans to gripe about the set, no matter which edition of the set they buy. I worked on various settings until I realized what the problems was, and then received best viewing results from setting both our Samsung player and Samsung 4K/UHD curved screen TV to dynamic, allowing them to sort out the encoding between themselves. YMMV depending what brand of player and/or TV you watch, or how bright or snappy you want to 2K material to appear. Having the same brand helped, as playback on a different Blueray player to the same TV was not satisfactory. It's too bad that SciFi/Universal couldn't (afford to) film the show in 4K in those early days, as it's usually done now, but that's what resulted in sometimes 'muddy/grainy' appearances, especially of many interior scenes. Better to have the series made at the budget they provided than not. Owning this set allows you to see the glory of of the show as it should've been seen if it had been possible at the time, had we all enjoyed having 'HD' during the series run, but even in 2009 Blueray and 4K were pretty expensive for many people. The special effects on a 4KUHD set are great for the way the show was filmed then, unless they try to reimagine the reimagining some day. The extra features are great, so now you can explain to your grandkids so they can understand why we older fans still like the show so many years after this and the original series came and went. A great cast and epic show. Mega Hit records was quick to respond tp my contacts and gets an easy 5 star rating.",1480291200,5,2120,4.656

And well, cylons happen too. Lots of plot twists to keep it interesting through the 4 years. Warning on nudity for parents with little ones. And they say ""frack"" ALL of the time. All in all, very well done. Happy to have bought it and watched it.

3430098,5,B001993Y2C,"This reimagined Battlestar Galactica series was at least a decade ahead of its time. Those spotting the contradictions between what humanity needs to do to survive -- as well as to deserve to survive -- and what humanity chooses to do instead, will instantly recognize the sophisticated, desperate angst of this now classic sci-fi series.

BSG's unsettling yet ever-timely conclusion is that our future as a species involves letting go of our identity as a species. Starbuck is the Hero archetype recast in postmodern characteristics: attractively but unwisely confident; strong through injury; outwardly courageous as a facade for interpersonal fear; awakening to fatal weaknesses only in time to succumb to them; triumphant only in transcendence. She is like us -- one day, ghosts on a quiet planet.

Critics initially underrated BSG as simply weaving post-Matrix ""gritty sci-fi"" with Gen X nostalgia. But the premise was always more than that. BSG was conceived just as science was showing us both the unique perils of global technoeconomy, and our catastrophic evolutionary tendency to ignore those perils. The Cylons represent any existential hazard created out of that contradiction. A decade and a half of squandered opportunities later, for example, we are irreversibly headed for as much as a 7 spike in global temperatures within 100 years. (For comparison, the worst extinction event in Earth's history, worse even than what killed the dinosaurs, involved 10 over 300,000 years.) Even climate deniers subconsciously know that our civilization, and very possibly our species, is soon doomed. Humanity's children are consequences.

So how does a society develop awareness of doom, already set in motion? As in the playtimes of traumatized children, it emerges first in fictional narratives ostensibly set far away from ourselves, but which actually mirror the imminent. That is what great sci-fi has always done for us. And in that respect, Battlestar Galactica is easily among the greatest such series ever aired. It was not so pretentious as to be a warning, like so many others. BSG knew its audience and its context well enough to simply illustrate and comment on the classic, eternal dance of hope and mortality. That's why the Battlestar Galactica story arc touches us so deeply. It is less like a sermon, more like a eulogy.",1479081600,2,2340,5.234666666666667

So, you do feel like you know these people and actually care about them.  The special effects are done well enough, especially for a TV series.  The set includes all 4.5 seasons, plus extras.

The version I received contains a booklet with episode listings, and each disc is stamped with the episodes it contains.

The picture quality is exactly what it is supposed to be. It is no different from the US Blu-ray version, or any broadcast versions. In absolute terms, the producers made some of the dark scenes, especially early on, to look grainy. This is just like some movies being shot 16mm for effect, for example the first part of the movie Steve Jobs. It is actually aesthetically pleasing once you accept that it is a grainy look chosen for special effect. It is not pervasive, and many of the scenes, especially as the show progresses, are quite pristine. (Another factor is that this was shot on early digital. But they did that in part to achieve the effect.)",1474070400,12,978,4.752941176470588

He'll love it. I'll get a phone call about how awesome it is. Why? Because it was extremely well thought out. It is also dark - It is not the 1980s show at all.

3430171,5,B001993Y2C,"Those are fighting words in that headline, but it has been 7 years since I binge watched this over the Winter 2008-Summer 2009 and to this day I still think about this peerless series or some aspect of it, a quote, an image, an interaction, on an almost nearly daily basis. Yes I've watched The Wire, Sopranos, Breaking Bad and many others, and while excellent, in my opinion they have all been living in the shadow of this. It takes a bit of your soul after you finish BSG, the story is complete, but you never feel it leaves you as it gives you something greater, something beautiful. In my case it did. When we get down to brass tacks, what reason do we listen read, watch, play fiction other than to look for an experience that makes it that more enlightened to ourselves and the rest of of humanity that we may never have thought about. It why storytelling came about in the first place around campfires in prehistoric times, to pass on what is and always will be important, those things that make us more complete if we contemplate them.

It's probably the most powerful story I've ever watched and I include film in that and I've (supposedly so they say) good taste. It starts off like a rocket and morphs quickly from a rather thrilling, gritty science fiction saga to an honest to god life changing (if you let it) study on what it means to be alive and human nature and how best to respond to the trials life throws at us and how we all are striving to get/stake out a small measure of peace. The show starts white knuckle and then gets wider/deeper than you could think of and soon realize this is one of the greats and how little known it really is. You'll feel like you're found hidden pirate's treasure and want to share it with someone else.

The less you know the better. I began watching in late 2008 because I was standing in a store with a friend in 1st year of college and he said try this. I had never seen a trailer, a review, how many episodes, NOTHING. To say I was pleasantly surprised is an understatement that is equal to saying what they dropped on Hiroshima was a grenade. It's now my favorite show of all time and I'm not really a science fiction fan. To put it mildly:

It had everything I liked from various other great fiction mixed together but in perfect concoction. I never had a felt a series so made for me, but here it was: Politics, scenic planets, resource depletion, mental exhaustion and desperation, PTSD, life after the military, a navy style military, but transplanted to a beliveable future society, characters of great warmth and duty but also questioning and self aware enough to learn from their mistakes and others. I loved how old and young characters interacted with each other across age gaps. The feeling of living in a tin can, after losing everyone you know and THEN being hunted across the universe after a total genocide is palpable. Strong and weak male characters that are allowed to be men and strong and weak women characters that are not trying to be men, but women, just humans keeping themselves from the brink all set in an atmosphere of cabin fever and paranoia.

Its one of the truly great stories, ordinary people being forced to cope with a situation inflicted upon them as they get put through the most harrowing odyssey to find some small contentment (surrogate families become a subtle underlying theme of the series). The characters are so well drawn and so flawlessly and naturally acted that even by the end of the first season, you will feel like you understand, empathize them all even when not fully agreeing with their decisions, No show will make you feel more conflicted than BSG or put you in another shoes, and despite all this it never becomes a story of anti heroes, they really are trying to figure a way out of the mire and be decent people. They will remind you of people you in real life know and inspire you to be better; I know this sounds cringey but this series was one of the reasons behind my choice of career I'm currently pursuing and changed my beliefs in some aspects of democracy and even religion. This is the kind of TV that makes you wish you had the chance to have some of the characters a part of your own life. It does all this while by being incredibly compelling, introspective, adventurous, immersive and having one of the finest thrilling and beautiful soundtracks you will ever hear in all of cinema/TV. It is godlike and I find myself listening to it whether its speeding dangerously down a motorway, typing out an Excel sheet or loading the dishwasher. Bear McCreary take a bow.

It is a series both under seen and under heard, both intelligent, probing and life affirming. What does it mean to be human, to be alive, what do we fight for, you'll have to answer that for yourself, but this series will give you signposts and unearth some parts of yourself we rarely get in touch with. It is a show not of anti heroes, but of real people being tested far beyond what life had intended for them, revealing itself to have huge dramatic heart to match its vast brains. People and what's left of civilization are left holding on to each other and their sanity/identity, living in close proximity, in a facade of democracy, at the end of everything. What is there to live for?

It has been seven years since it ended and to this day I have never seen characters (dozens of secondary and primary) and an overarching storyline feel so real, so true and despite the darkness, inspirational. It combines the intimate,cosy and the epic and does so with equal skill. J.R.R Tolkien would be proud. It is a treatise on the human experience that feels and looks like a 60 hour, 6 year cinematic film series. It is a universal fable which compels us to reflect on our own world, our own lives, our own choices, since all of this has happened before, and will happen again. Nothing is left untouched, and you'll feel that journey, oh lord you'll feel it. You'll live it.

So enough of the hyperbole, I just felt that a lot of these reviews undersell it, and I do think that years from now it will be regarded in the same way Blade Runner, Lawrence of Arabia or Alien is now, some of the greatest productions of all time and one with the longest legs; I believe it will age fantastically for it has a timeless setting.

I wasn't at all excited about several of the ongoing characters in the show and overall, it has a real ""Canadian"" feel to it, which in sci-fi, makes for a different kind of viewing.  However, there some really great performances in the series that draw you in.  I guess it just really depends on viewing preference.  I'm not running out to grab the latest season of Lost Girl, but if that is your thing, this might be up your alley.

I couldn't say if the Blu-ray version is that much better in quality than the DVD version that I already owned.  The Blu-ray copies stopped working at disk 3 and damaged several of my Blu-ray players to the point that they no longer function.  Something to be mindful of, as it may not be an isolated case.

It's quite a nice jump in viewing quality vs the standard DVD we used to own. It was certainly worth the money we paid here ($51.49) vs the more expensive U.S. version. For what it's worth, we've had no issues playing this on our Yamaha BD-S477BL Blu-Ray player, if that helps (being in Region 1 U.S.). I believe it's region-free.

The writers and directors went out of their way to make this series as believable as possible while maintaining a futuristic setting that involves space flight at faster than light speeds.  Furthermore,  the characters and their back stories are all highly developed.  This show brings an air of excitement and drama that's rarely seen in such shows.  The quality of the acting, writing, and storytelling are equal to anything shown on the big screen in movie theaters.  The series flows amazing well from episode to episode, making binge watching a practical must.  Being a far cry from the original (which looks incredibly cheap, especially by today's standards), this show looks like it was produced with an unlimited budget.  If anybody interested in this is former Navy, than even the sights and sounds of the interior spaces throughout the Galactica will have a familiar ring to them, right down to the sound the closing of a hatch makes on board the ship.",1456876800,,1107,4.978260869565218

It has been confusing to determine what exactly this set includes because it's not part of the official product description, but while it has each season's episodes as well as the pilot movie and ""Razor"", the big disappointment is that it does *NOT* include ""The Plan"" (the season 4 packaging indicates that it has a sneak peak of it as part of the extras).  Also, I've not seen any references to any of the online webisodes being included, so no idea yet about those.  Not sure why something advertised as ""The Complete Series"" would leave out some content.

Update: I think it might be that the Blu-ray set includes ""The Plan"" but the DVD version definitely does not ... bummer.  Also noticed an odd thing in that the season 4edgroup (each set of DVDs for each season are groups together in a sleeve within the box) includes a separate disc for ""Razor"", four discs for season 4.5 (labeled Disc One thru Disc Four), but season 4.0 are labels Disc Two thru Disc Four.

Also, this is not a US region disc set, and that was not clearly advertised. However, if you rip them, this does not matter. Otherwise, you can only switch your region on a player a few times and this is a problem.",1448841600,,529,4.422680412371134
3430497,5,B001993Y2C,"One of my favorite television series of all time along with 'The Wire' and 'Breaking Bad'.

Like 'The Wire' this is a complex, Dickensian study of human nature, not afraid of asking big questions, and meticulously plotted like a great novel, so that each episode is a chapter in a much larger whole.

Just as 'The Wire' used the overly familiar clich' world of the cop show to jump off from and shatter our preconceptions, and 'Battlestar
Galactica' uses the sci-fi series, and the idea of human versus robot wars the same way.

This is thinking person's sci fi, in the tradition of Arthur C. Clarke, or Isaac Asimov. It's about why we are how we are, what it means to be a human being, morality under constant pressure in times of war, fathers and sons, impossible loves, metaphors for modern and recent
politics and real world situations.

My wife, far from a sci-fi fan was hooked after 3 episodes, and we tore through 5 years of shows in just a few days. It's that addicting.

The acting is all at least quite good, and some cast members are remarkable, creating characters full of depth, complexity and
contradiction. The writing is terrific, allowing the characters to change and grow, but always in ways that make sense, creating seemingly
inexplicable conundrums, only to find surprising, sometimes shocking - but ultimately logical and satisfying - ways to explain where they've
taken us. The special effects are generally very impressive for TV, even if they're not really why you watch this show.

It also has some of the most tense episodes of television I've ever seen, and some of the season enders left me completely wrung out and
blown away. I was sad to get to the last episode, just as one is sad to finish a great book.

Speaking of ending, the one serious let down for me was the very last episode. Certainly no disaster, but for perhaps the only time in the series, some of the answers felt disappointingly flat and simplistic.

But that wasn't enough to take away from the tremendous esteem with which I hold the show. One that is surely worth your time.

This region free box set seems to match the US box set for quality, although it does leave out 'The Plan'.  But you could get that separately and still be ahead on price.",1448668800,,2248,4.611528822055138

3430504,5,B001993Y2C,"First and foremost, I think this is the most engaging and significant science fiction series of the past several decades; Firefly or ST:NG and others form a line behind this one.  Second, despite concerns over the finale (which I was fine with) I think it balanced good storytelling and social criticism more expertly than most shows of its era regardless of genre.  The acting was top-tier, the production values were remarkable, and the writing and direction were superb.  Overall, if you've never seen the series, or perhaps engage in a massive binge once per year like I do, then this box set is definitely worth the investment.

Regarding this imported Blu-Ray set, I did a test viewing of all the discs upon receipt and they all worked flawlessly.  The ""All Regions"" designation is accurate and it played on two different Blu-Ray players (a Sony and a Samsung) without any issues.  The packaging was compact and professional, with an insert booklet with an overview of the series.  As this box set is a fraction of the price of the US version I think it's a bargain; yes, it does not include ""The Plan"" and yes, it has the UK theme song but these are in no way ""deal breakers"" for me.  Audio and video are consistent with the original broadcasts (as well as HD streaming via Netflix) so I wouldn't worry about the viewing experience.

3430720,5,B001993Y2C,"I've had this for several years now and I have loved every minute of the series having missed it when it was actually being aired. I'm a product of the 70's and 80's and I watched the original Battlestar Galactica with Dirk Benedict and the original cast. I was a bit skeptical when I heard that Starbuck was being played by a woman and so was Boomer. Thankfully, this was not a problem at all and it actually enhanced the experience.

I was a little surprised by the direction the new series took compared to the original, as the reimagined series has more religious themes (thankfully the word ""frak"" made the cut! LOL)

One word of caution when viewing the new series, at least on the Blu Ray version: If you want to watch the extended versions of the episodes, make sure to check the episode listing on the cover. There are several episodes that have these options, but the options are split between discs or menus. In other words, the last episode on one disc is the original episode then the next disc might have the extended edition. So check the episode listing! I can't tell you the number of times I smacked my forehead with the heal of my hand because I watched the regular episode not knowing the extended episode was on the next disc.

The story and characters are complex, and actually make you care about the characters (even the ""bad"" ones who are also complex, and not just bad guys for the sake of being bad.

3430741,5,B001993Y2C,"Excellent series that I have re-watched 4 or 5 times now. Insanely better than the 70's version of the show. Acting is excellent. It's an exciting drama that anyone will enjoy, you do not need to be a fan of science fiction, or a fan or even familiar with the original 70's BSG.  I put this show up there with Breaking Bad, X-Files, Lost, ST:TNG, as some of the best TV ever made.

Comparing this set to the US set: The content on the discs is identical. The audio is identical: The menus are in Dolby Digital, the episodes themselves are DTS-HD Master.  I own both the Original US blu-ray release that came in the collector packaging, plus this set.  The original US set did not include Razor, this set does.  The Disc with Razor is the same as the disc sold here in the US that came separately (and later included in the repackaged silver box set), it contains the broadcast version plus an extended version of Razor.  The packaging is excellent, and uses normal 2 and 3 disc 14mm blu-ray cases, vs the paper sleeve crap that the collectors version came with (which I subsequently re-packaged into normal cases.)  The artwork on the discs is different between the US release and this one. As far as that goes, I prefer the US discs, as these appear more generic in design, but for the price you can't complain, at $65 this set is a steal. The US set split season 4 up into season 4 (2 discs) and season 4.5 (3 discs).  In this set they just call season 4.5 ""The Final Season"".  Razor is packaged with Season 4, The disc case is labeled Season 4 discs 1, 2, and 3.  The discs are labeled Razor, Season 4 disc 1, Season 4 disc 2.

It does not include The Plan, which of course the US set does not include either since it hadn't been filmed/released yet.  It comes with a booklet that goes over each major human character, each known cylon model, lists each discs' episode contents, and has a glossary of the terms used in the show.  It also mentions The Plan and Caprica: ""The Story Continues.."" but keep in mind neither of those come with this set. It makes no mention of Blood & Chrome which was created after this set.

To make this amazingly affordable set complete, just buy The Plan, and Blood & Chrome, both of which can be found for under $10 each. Adding the Caprica show would complete the modern set of Battlestar Galactica, but that so far has only been released on DVD.  If you bought just a single, 14mm 4 disc standard blu-ray case, you could fit both Blood and Chrome and The Plan into this box set. The Plan would go in the new case along with the Final Season (4 discs total, place The Plan as the final disc), and then the original 3 disc case for the Final Season could be used for Blood & Chrome plus discs 1 and 2 for Season 1. Blood & Chrome is a prequel to BSG the fits chronologically between Caprica and Season 1, the Plan came out after the series finale, and would be considered a spoiler unless viewed last, so it would be the last disc in the set.",1441411200,22,2977,4.300536672629696

3430791,2,B001993Y2C,"This show started off brilliantly. The cast is amazing. The writing was great at first. Seriously 5 stars almost every episode for the first 1.5 seasons and some of the earliest episodes are honest-to-god my favorite TV in all of sci-fi. I was a N-E-R-D for this show. But then after that it slowly but surely becomes painfully obvious that if there was a plan, it was to intentionally and willfully jump a massive pile of dead, burning sharks in an exploding semi. I'm not going to hit you with spoilers. I'm just going to tell you what doesn't happen.

* No plan is ever revealed or explained

* All the hinting and suggesting and speculating by fans was never justified or made worthwhile. They clearly did not have a path for the show mapped out before they got to the end and they drop so many threads going all the way back to the first season, it's not even funny.

* Kara Thrace doesn't end up making more sense by the end of the series than she did at the beginning (and I'm talking strictly character development, not that disgrace at the very end that neatly explains away everything). Seriously though, Ron Moore's increasingly one-note-of-crazy handling of Kara is embarrassing to me as somebody who has even attempted to write characters and you could tell from interviews the actress was struggling to find anything nice to say about her role in upcoming seasons.

* The show doesn't stop reinventing itself away from a compelling action/thriller/drama into different flavors of bad soap opera.

It had so much potential but then the producers got obsessed with tinkering with the meta and theme over... well, basic tenets of good fiction. And once that big giant sci-fi axe inevitably showed itself before they could get a fifth season, they were completely out of gas and obviously completely out of ideas. Seasons 3 and 4 are overrun by pointless and annoying standalone episodes and very long stretches with almost no action, all strung together by a chain of teasers and completely pointless ""revelations"" that mostly made me feel like I was being taken for a ride.

And ultimately it's because I was. Seriously folks. No plan. There really wasn't one. I haven't watched ""The Plan"" (lol) but the fact that they even felt they had to make a separate mini-series to explain there really was one is of no interest to me. I couldn't care less about any work the producers of BSG do in the future. That's how bitterly disappointing this series ultimately proved to be. I watched an episode of Caprica and found it interesting, but never followed up because I knew the Cancel-Bait Channel (or SyFy as they now like to be called) wouldn't (and of course they didn't) and I just didn't trust the series' creators anymore because they clearly have a basic taste problem that prevented them from squandering their own successes time and time again.

I wish I could blame Sci-Fi for this one but the show's creators seriously made so many awful choices, I don't think the execs get the rap for this one. No season 5 was a mercy-killing.",1437436800,3,3045,4.701688555347092

Yes, as many have pointed out with the first two episodes (the mini-series), it is grainy. Then some other episodes can look that way in some parts as well, mostly during the space sections.  Well, I hate to burst all of those 1 star ratings's bubbles of this purchase, BUT THAT WAS HOW IT WAS MADE back then. I remember watching a blu-ray copy of the show through the Netflix disc days way back then and I even said it was grainy. 5 episodes into the first season, the show looks great to me for the price I paid. I have no clue if the American version is actually remastered or better visual quality. I ended up watching the rest of seasons through Netflix streaming services. I put in a random blu-ray disk of this collections and went straight to a random episode. The result? It looked and sounded fine to me. Oh, how I missed hearing those drums boom on my surround sound!
So knocking this product down to 1 star because the mini series episodes were grainy is pretty dumb if you ask me. Regardless, the price I paid for was on sale, but currently $64.95 for this wonderful show is a steal! It's also convenient too because I wanted to re-watch all of BSG again....and I found out that Netflix just took it off their service. Anyway, I'm going to enjoy watching the rest of my box set!

3430836,5,B001993Y2C,"This is one of the best shows ever made!
This is a review of the refreshed silver Region 1 Blu-Ray ""The Complete Series"" set (current as of 2015).  This is a nearly perfect set.  The box is nice, the discs are not mounted in the most easily accessible way... but they are secure and are not going to fall out any time soon.  My only real complaint is that it is missing ""The Face of the Enemy"" web miniseries, which are 10 episodes that have yet to be published/released.  My understanding is that they can only legally be watched via Hulu in the US, but I am sure that will not stop most people interested in watching them.  It is just annoying when publishers don't include everything.

This series Includes 5 cases in the set:

Case 1: Labeled ""Season One"", it includes the Mini-Series Parts 1 and 2 on one disc, and Season 1 Episodes 1-13 over the next 3 discs.

Case 2: Labeled ""Season Two"" is just Season Two Episodes 1-20 over 5 discs.  Do note that Disc Two ends with the originally aired version of Episode 10 ""Pegasus"", while Disc 3 starts with an extended version of that same episode.

Case 3: Labeled ""Season Three"", it includes Season Three Episodes 1-20 over 5 discs, and ""The Resistance"" webisodes as an extra on disc 2.  Similar to season two, disc 2 ends with the originally aired version of Episode 9 ""Unfinished Business"", while disc 3 opens with an extended version of the same episode.
A word of caution; the webisodes of ""The Resistance"" are extremely poor quality, not even proper SD quality.  It literally looks as if they lost the original footage, re-downloaded a 360p stream from youtube, interlaced it, and slapped it on the disc.  Still, some interesting story points and world building, so it is worth seeing at least once, but if you can't stand the quality then you are not missing much.  All 10 webisodes are set as a single title on the disc separated by chapter breaks and title cards.

Case 4: Labeled ""Season Four"" Includes the Razor movie, the ""Razor Flashbacks"" minisodes (because calling them 'webisodes' would be too consistent) on one disc, with Season 4.0 across 2 discs, and Season 4.5 across 3 discs.  Episodes 12 ""A Disquiet Follows My Soul"", and 18 ""Islanded in a Stream of Stars"", have the original episodes followed by their extended versions; but this time they are each on the same disc rather than being split across discs which is much less confusing.  Also, the last 3 episodes (Daybreak parts 1, 2 & 3) are all cut together as a single 150 minute episode with extended content at the very end.
Lastly, the minisodes, while still interlaced SD footage, are of much MUCH better quality than ""The Resistance"" webisodes.  They are all strung together as a single title with fades and chapter breaks between each minisode.  Certainly worth watching as part of the series.

Case 5: Labeled ""Battlestar Galactica, The Plan"" is merely the retail box version of ""The Plan"" made for TV movie included in the set.

As stated before, the only thing missing are ""The Face of the Enemy"" webisodes/minisodes/web miniseries that takes place between Seasons 4.0 and 4.5.

Viewing Order for the BSG universe:

Outside of this BSG collection there is also the 2 season show Caprica, and the web series turned movie Blood and Chrome.  With that said, this is the order that I would suggest watching things:
1) Caprica, Seasons 1 & 2.  To be honest, the show is not great, and it is completely understandable why it was canceled, but it does fill in some back story and is not entirely awful.  It is unfortunate that it is only available on DVD as (for all it's faults) it is a pretty show that would have looked good in 1080p.  While made after BSG it is simply not as good, so watching it after BSG just makes it seem even worse than it really is, and it is chronologically first.  It just makes the most sense to start here if you are going to watch it.
2) Blood and Chrome movie or web mini series.  This takes place between Caprica and BSG during the first war.  Fun show, and it is unfortunate that they did not turn it into a full series as they intended.
3) Battlestar Galactica Season 1, and Season 2 Episodes 1-17.  Nice simple chronological viewing order.
4) Razor movie and Razor Flashbacks.  Razor Flashbacks were released first, but a lot of the content is in the Razor movie, so it is optional viewing.  There is a bit at the beginning and ending of Flashbacks that are not in the movie that make it worth watching once, but otherwise I would just watch the movie and be done with it.
Also, the Razor movie is technically the first 2 aired episodes of Season 4, and there are some minor spoilers for Season 4 at the end, but at the same time it makes more sense to view this as history from Season 4's perspective, so it makes a good deal more sense seeing it here so it feels older when it is finally referenced.
5) Season 2 Episodes 18-20.  Finishes up the Season 2 story arc.
6) The Resistance webisodes.  As mentioned earlier, these are horrible quality, but it is a good little story arc that sets up Season 3 so it is worth watching at least once.
7) Season 3. Nice and simple, nothing to break up here.
8) Season 4 Episodes 1-11.  To be clear, this is ""He That Believeth In Me"" through ""Sometimes a Great Notion"". Note that if you are looking at an 'aired' order then these would be episodes 3-13 as the Razor movie is technically Season 4 episodes 1-2.  Also, if you are going to watch the Razor movie 'in order' then it would be right before Season 4.
9) The Face of the Enemy webisodes.  While difficult to find (only legally available in the US on Hulu) they are great and set up Episode 12 very nicely.  Certainly worth finding and I wish it was available on DVD or BluRay (though I would not repurchase the entire series just to have this as an extra).
10) Season 4 Episodes 12-15.  This would be ""A Disquiet Follows My Soul"" through ""No Exit"".
11) The Plan movie.  This is essentially a recap of the first few seasons from the Cylon's perspective.  Rather than watching it after Season 2 where it is placed chronologically, it acts better as a recap of the series and a reveal of what the Cylons have been up to just before the series climax and finally.
12) Season 4 Episodes 16-19.

It was never shot in HD. It was meant to tell a compelling and emotional story with great action scenes. However the amount of action is limited but when they do have battles...amazing. Also it preferred story over quality. So don't be dissapointed its not shiny and dazzling. But its good quality.

I didn't see a disc 1 for Season 4. Turns out that there is no disc 1. The Disc 1 is RAZOR, Disc 2 is where the episodes start so be careful when you get it.

3430904,3,B001993Y2C,"seems several of us are in the minority  with this series and not caring for the changes made.  Like V  I was thrilled to hear BSG was making a come back until I tried getting it.  Even tried Blood and Chrome when it came out at the rental box. I just felt like this re- launched series was like Star Trek Enterprise meet The Terminator.  Sure it was sci-fi  was a lot of people are happy about.  This isn't Battlestar 1980.  Where are the cool laser weapons and alien leader of the Cylons the original series had.  Why is the picture so washed up as some reviewers put it as they also compared the ship to those of World War 2 in I guess more military and less sci-fi way.  One of my favorite things with 1970s shows like BSG and Buck Rogers were the cool  scifi uniforms, cool bridge designs and great laser fights while these new people clothes look too 21st century earth. Could Adama at least have a similar 1978 outfit look as taking away from him is like taking Superman father Jor-El on Krypton out of his alien sci-fi clothes and putting him in three piece suit.",1421884800,,1071,4.278606965174129

We watched every episode over about 4 days and finally watched the last 4 episodes never seen. Picture quality was not true HD; but was very good and with a very slight grainy presentation. Well worth the sale price and this collection is one for all Battlestar followers. Buy it, you will enjoy it all.",1421798400,,424,4.743243243243243
3430907,5,B001993Y2C,"When this series was announced, fans of the original series were vocal in their anxiety.  Could it possibly match and respect the original?  Luckily, they didn't really try.  The original series was terrible 70s schlock. The new producers tossed everything but the general outline and built a new series from the ground up.  It's gritty, relying on hand-held cameras for an urgent documentary feel (even the CG looks handheld). Technology on the ships is worn and clunky (if you've ever been on a WWII battleship, this will feel very familiar). Even colors and contrast are occasional pulled into washed-out realms. The whole thing looks and sounds great on Blu Ray.

Casting is almost always just right.  Characters are compelling, all with their flaws.  There are no saints on this show, but one of the high points is the way they wrestle with their own imperfections. The viewer with no interest in sci-fi can still enjoy this character driven series.

This series originally ran on a very stretched-out schedule and suffered because of that. There were many character arcs and a lot of connections that could be lost during the long hiatus between chunks of episodes.  Watching straight through helps to keep those connections and to increase the appreciation of the good work of both actors and writers. Be prepared to give up your free time for a month or so.  You'll plan on watching only a single episode, but it's hard to resist just one more.",1421539200,26,1452,4.865853658536586

3430909,5,B001993Y2C,"I consider ""Epic"" an overused word. A often misused word.  But in this case, epic is the right word.  The story has such a broad scope as to deserve the term epic.  The story is about survivors.  It's about war.  It's about humanity.  It is a story also about non-humans who are all too human and for once it is appropriate that they should be.  It's about a single journey and the misdeeds and consequences of an entire race over thousands of years.  It's about God and faith.  It's about redemption. It has a dog and (spoiler) the dog lives to the end.  It's about hope.  It's often agonizingly hopeless.  But just as you decide that it is too depressing to watch a single moment more it recovers.

You should watch it.  Find out what it is about for you.  You may love it.  You may hate it.  But I bet you will agree that for once it is true, this one is epic.",1421193600,3,863,4.164634146341464

3430922,5,B001993Y2C,"The Blu-ray is wonderful, but this review is for what you get since a lot of people are confused.
As other reviewers stated, the gray box Blu-ray set is the one to buy. You get all 4 seasons in tact, none of this half a season nonsense that was set up in the original DVD set. Also included is Razor in the 4th season and The Plan in the 'normal' Blu-ray case apart from the rest.  For the seasons, the packaging is season separate that unfolds like a book with the discs firmly in place with a plastic nub. I probably didn't describe it very well, but nothing is on a spindle and the discs are packaged excellent. Other DVDs and Blu-rays are packaged this way so nothing new there and one has probably seen this type of packaging before. Lots of extras are included and the outer box that holds everything will fit nicely on a shelf, nothing crazy bulky.",1420588800,2,855,4.3105590062111805

3430933,5,B001993Y2C,"Was hesitant to buy the Black Box (Imported) due to previous reviews.  But, I have to say, it's absolutely great.  Just so you are aware:  1) The Mini Series is included, 2) It comes with Razor (both the televised and unrated editions).  3) But, it DOES NOT come with The Plan (but for < $9.00 I picked up the combo Razor/The Plan blu ray) ... you can also get just The Plan on Blu Ray for a similar price.  4) The seasons are broken out into individual plastic blu ray cases, each case has a list of the episodes on the back (typically 2 cases per season).  5) The minisodes are also present (nothing has the Face the Enemy minisodes, but The Razor Flashbacks and The Resistance minisodes are included with this set).  I have the US DVDs and the only major difference I saw was that Season 4.5 in this set is called The Final Season (does it matter???, it's the same episodes).  The import cases and discs do have the European Rating System markings on them (but who cares for around $70.00!!!! ... I picked up mine for $65).  In addition, there is a nice insert/book that has Episode listings and additional disc content listings.  This is NOT the set with cardboard holding the disc, the discs are well-protected in the plastic cases and easily accessed.  If you look at the customer images, this is the set that movie guru ""BSS"" provided images for.  My copy arrived in perfect condition.  I don't know how you could be disappointed with this set.  Note: I didn't pay a lot of attention to what's available for subtitles, because I don't use them.  But, if it's something that's important to you I'd recommend investigating this set a little further to make sure it has what you want/need.  In addition, these are Region Free blu rays (I didn't have any problems playing them in my inexpensive Sony blu ray player(s)), but again, make sure they will work for you.",1419724800,9,1867,4.511904761904762

3430987,4,B001993Y2C,"I bought this BD set to replace my DVD version when I got my 4K UHD Samsung and Oppo player.

Cons:
1) Maybe that is what bothers me the most about this...  The producers left many of the scenes ""grainy"" (it actually looks like Photoshop's ""noise"" effect if you know what that is), and many of the scenes with a grayish ""cast"" to them.  They mention on screen that these were left in for ""artistic"" reasons, but on good equipment, it is way too much.  They really should have cleaned it up for the HD version. In the commentary, it's even mentioned that much of BSG was never seen in studio in HD (no wonder there).  Many scenes look no better than the DVD,

2) They have a number of episodes on the discs, immediately followed by the ""extended version"" of the same episode.  If you are watching episodes in sequence, as one long story, this is very frustrating... Do you re-watch an episode you have just seen for a few extra scenes, or do you skip the extended version?  Bad planning, they should have put the extended version first.  Anyway, just keep your eye on the episode listings for the NEXT disc to see if the last episode on the one you are playing is not duplicated with an extended version.

3) The packaging is the old ""hard clear plastic DVD"" cases, in a cardboard fold-out sleeve.  Better than the worst I have seen, but I worry a bit more about disc scratching.

Pros:
1) The scenes shot ""clean"" are REALLY CLEAN, Some are even better than my ""Mastered in 4K"" BD discs.

2) The price is really reasonable, especially compared to the original DVD's where they sold Half-seasons at full price.

Overall, definitely worth buying, if you are replacing your DVD's remember you can either turn someone else onto the series, or get a great write-off by donating them to the Salvation Army or Goodwill.",1410048000,10,1811,4.4984709480122325

Adama is replaced by a Latino who is not a member of the Council.  There is no council.  One already existed in the 1978 series and Adama was a member and the Commander of BSG.  Instead we get a Sec of Education Female that is dying of Breast Cancer. Where is ANY male dying of Prostrate Cancer???  We get an elected council.  We get a Black Male named Boomer replaced by a Female of what looks like a Black-Asian mix.  We get Starbuck, a White Male, replaced by a GI Jane type Female.  We do get two Token White Males.  Apollo that is in no way of Latino descent and mostly playing second fiddle, and of course the Drunken Executive Officer.  This is just like Star Trek with the Female Captain replacing a White European Male (Jean Luke) and the only white male ships engineer in the very first episode being depicted as a bumbling idiot replaced by a half human, half Klingon FEMALE.

I am all for getting along and don't give a hoot about your gender or ethnicity (my daughters are American-Asian) BUT I completely detest PC garbage.  Yes they could have shown diversity in the 2004 to 2009 BSG but they didn't have to do it with denigration of a gender known as males or an ethnic group known as Whites.

I have watched it end-to-end including the standalone Razor DVD that was bundled with the pack.  The 5 stars are for the fact that it is bundled as one complete series with nothing missing - a fact i appreciate greatly.

The series is a somewhat creative and interesting re-imagining of the original BG show which i watched as a kid, especially with the human Cylon angle and the whole spiritual ""angel"" thing.  I'm not sold on the more overt quasi-religious slant of the re-imagined series but as long as you look at it as simple entertainment and not try to read too much into it or analyze it from a religious standpoint, it is a decent sci-fi story.

While some parts of the show are essential for storyline continuity, they may be a bit slow and you need to watch it all at one shot as much as possible in order to have any sense of continuity.  If you stagger viewing over more than a couple of months, it becomes a bit disjointed in memory terms.

The packaging of the DVDs is as expected, shrink-wrapped with the DVD cases fitting snugly inside.

I threw this set of  4.5 seasons of episodes and a couple of extra blu-ray disks in the dumpster before finishing watching them.  I collect movies but had not seen Battlestar Galactic on TV stations.  I found the Battlestar Galactica series to be an excellent sci-fi theme enveloping low-grade soap opera.  It is listed on a popular movie database as ""TV14"".  So, 14-year olds should watch these?  Not mine.

I catalog my DVDs and I like to list the actors with major parts in order to make easy the viewing of movies by a particular star.  If it is not obvious which actor performed which part, I use Google to search images for the actor/actresses name to determine who the person is.  I honestly never expected to encounter images of copulation for some of the 'stars'.

Too much violence and sex, as usual. A pretty dark story. Too much relationship drama and religious mumbo jumbo.

The writers seem to have started to lose control a bit of their story after season two. The story as-is would have been better if they had made it a more concise three seasons - the four seasons seemed a bit bloated. If they had wanted to make more seasons than three, that would have been great but not by adding the type of stuff they did. I would have liked more standard space opera content in that case.

Why do I call it a sci fi fantasy instead of just sci fi? I don't like to give spoilers but let's just say that strictly speaking sci fi requires a plausible scientific explanation and background for events.

The finale was not as satisfying as the show deserved.

For this reason they tend to dumb down the dialogue and storylines, they avoid controversial views instead favoring shock value or cheap laughs, not so with Battlestar Galactica. The producers and writers of this show dug a deep pool trusting that a highly educated sci-fi audience would be able to follow and appreciate it. This gamble paid off ten fold.

I just completed watching the entire series for a second time. For most shows the second lap reveals flaws, especially if it's built on suspense. However, watching Galactica twice was like getting a repeat class in the struggles of humanity. Beyond the prima facie of the war between cylons and humans are countless episodes that address our inner struggles concerning prejudice, classism and democracy. Battlestar explores the complex relationships between people and the powers, desires and faults that run and sometimes ruin our lives.

The second time around I fell in love with new characters, I connected the dots that previously eluded me and I now have favorite episodes.

implies this also contains ""Razor"" and ""The Plan"".  If you notice, Amazon is currently saying that frequently bought together is the complete series and also:
Battlestar Galactica: Blood & Chrome - Unrated Edition
Battlestar Galactica: Razor / Battlestar Galactica: The Plan Double Feature [Blu-ray]

""Razor"" is included (but it is ""hidden"").  It is in the ""Season Four - Discs One, Two & Three"" case.  The case cover says disc one is ""Razor"" (including the unrated extended edition), but the disk is really marked ""Razor"" and there is no disc ""Three"".

Note also that this does not include ""Caprica"".

Now for my personal opinion on the series.  I think ""Battlestar"" started out fantastic, the miniseries was great but somewhere along the way (seasons 3, 4 and 5) it became inconsistent.  One episode would be great and the next would be poor.  All in all, if you enjoy great drama set on a starship then you should enjoy most of Battlestar Galactica.",1396569600,13,1495,4.951807228915663

So to watch all four seasons in marathon sessions in true HD on a newer TV is a great way to do without overpriced cable bills. The price I picked it up for on Amazon was well worth the money.

This is way, way better.

The characters are more engaging, the plot is more developed, and everything just feels richer.

My dad, who really isn't an original BSG fan like I was, had a sort of reluctance about watching this one. I sat him down and we binge-watched the first season together and now he's hooked.

My wife really isn't into sci-fi shows and she liked it, too.

3431050,5,B001993Y2C,"I am writing regarding the silver colored dvd boxed set of BSG-- The Complete Series.
The advice others have given about which compete series set to buy is right on -- the silver box is the way to go.  The miniseries, the four seasons of the series, Razor, and The Plan, are all included.

I'm a Star Trek fan and I've always enjoyed the optimism that Gene Roddenberry put into Trek.  It may be unrealistic, but it's still uplifting to envision a humanity that has evolved and improved in the centuries to come.  That being said, I also truly resonated and fully entered into the realism of Ron Moore's reimagining of BSG.  The special effects are visually effective, the acting is top notch, and the story compelling.  By the second season, they finally got it figured out how much hand-held camera to use, but the realism goes deeper than that.  The issues faced by the remnants of humanity as well as the cylons are real, the characters are real, the struggles are real, the failures are real.  The show has politics, it has the military, it has ethical and social issues similar to many we face today.  It portrays some very real, albeit flawed people doing the best they can, or truly screwing up.  It's all there.  There's religion and spiritual themes -- done with layered complexity.  Sure, there have been many who have complained about the ending - - but by the time I got there, I had thorough surrendered disbelief.  Something beyond ordinary reality was going on as the story went on, and I saw the ending as an extension of that.  Probably the only thing I felt was a bit overly contrived was Moore's insertion of ""All Along the Watchtower.""  But that's no big deal.  BSG was a great series, and it's great to watch it from the dvds in the original order, which the silver boxed set provides.  Did I say that the acting was truly great?  BSG is sci-fy reimagined, and I fully recommend it.",1394755200,6,1903,4.547058823529412

Now, that we can watch in it's full 1080P glory on huge sets, it really looks bad. I listened to the producer's message on the first disk, but never imagined that was what he was talking about. I thought my HDMI cable was bad and even tried replacing it.

They should really re-master this series and turn down the grain, way down. Some scenes look like a badly DIVX compressed DVD rip.",1392595200,3,581,4.321100917431193

3431064,5,B001993Y2C,"I own the Blu-Ray box set that came in the ""silver"" box from 2010.  There is a blu-ray set with a black cover (2011) with characters on the cover, one with a silver cover (2010) with characters on the cover, and an older black set (2004) with bad ""Cylon"" figure packaging.  The silver and black box sets are available on Amazon, but the silver one is more expensive.  I'm not sure why.  I don't see any obvious differences in the content besides the packaging.

The silver box-set has some labeling issues.  The box set includes 5 mini-sets.  Season 1, 2, 3, 4, and ""The Plan.""

The labeling is a little misleading.

Season 1 has the Mini Series and all the regular episodes, and extra bonus content.

Season 2 has all the regular episodes and bonus content, along with the extended version of the ""Pegasus"" episode.  It is labeled as ""Season 2"" but appears to have all the Season 2 and 2.5 content.  I looked up the Amazon description of Season
2.5, and compared it to the features listed on the physical box set, and they seem to have the same content listed.  All the blu-rays in this set are just labeled ""Season 2"" even though they include the 2.5 content.

Season 3 has all the regular episodes and bonus content as well as the extended episode of ""Unfinished Business"" episode and ""Battlestar Galactica: The Resistance"" webisodes.

Season 4 includes all the Season 4 and Season 4.5 content as well as Razor.  HOWEVER, the labeling is really weird. The spine on the box just says ""Season 4"" but the back of the box lists Season 4.5.  If you open the box, the first thing there is the Razor blu-ray, then the Season 4.0 blu- ray, then the Season 4.5 blu rays.  These are all in the Season 4 box.

The labeling on Season 4 is not done very well.  But, Razor, Season 4, and Season 4.5 are there.  This is similar to Season 2, where the box is just labeled ""Season 2"" but 2.5's content is included as well.  The biggest difference in labeling between Season 2 and Season 4 is that at least the Season 4 blu-rays are properly labled as Razor, Season 4, and Season 4.5, whereas all the blu-rays in Season 2 are just labeled ""Season 2"" even though they contain Season 2 and 2.5 content.

""The Plan"" is also included as this set, in a separate little case that fits within the box set along the seasons.

""Blood and Chrome"" and the ""Face of the Enemy"" webisodes are not in this set.  To the best of my knowledge, ""Face of the Enemy"" is not available on any disc, but is available in streaming form in various places.

Overall, I am very, very happy with this set.  It seems to include lots and lots of bonus content - all the stuff you would get from buying the sets individually - as well as ""The Plan"".  The hardest part was figuring out exactly what was in the box!",1392163200,5,2766,4.381139489194499

I am pleased to say that the set is 178:1 (widescreen) 1080p with DTS Master Audio; DTS Digital Surround and Dolby Digital all from Universal Studio's. The packaging that holds the disk is just like every other Blu-ray disk I buy inside and out. It is a 20 disk set and includes a booklet that gives a short bio of the main characters, episodes on each disk, and glossary of terms used in the show. Just like every other review I have read, it starts out grainy, especially the darker scenes. The cg  (computer graphics) are much better. Also, the overall quality seems to get better the more I watch it, as I am going through the set. I do not have the silver boxed set for a direct comparison, but I saved a lot of money and have added the complete series to my Sci Fi collection. I recommend this product, especially at. this price.

3431099,5,B001993Y2C,"BSG was never a bright and shiny show. Visually speaking it's cinematography was every bit as dark as many of the themes the show explored. This works to great effect in keeping with the tone of the narrative itself. From the mini series pilot and the very first episodes I tried to compare it to the original show from the 1970's or some other Sci-Fi show and realized that I was being completely ridiculous.  This show stands out on its own and in my opinion is a definitive exploration of the human condition.  There is definitely something for everyone with this show its not only a very engaging drama but it is backed up in every episode by exciting action sequences and is presented by an extremely talented and sexy cast.  I don't give this kind of praise out to just anybody nor do I do it regularly but I have to give this show one of my highest recommendations.  If you love great stories, great performances, great cinematography, you'll thoroughly enjoy the series.
The disc in the Blu-ray box set is laid out from beginning to end in the exact sequence to watch the show for maximum enjoyment this set also includes; THE PLAN, a final BSG movie that not only wraps up the franchise but makes you re-examine certain notions you might have had while watching the show.

I am still working my way through it and about half way through season 3.

Technically it seems well mastered with great audio track and fantastic use of what sound like Japanese or Indian drums during conflict sequences. If you have a sub woofer in your set up, you'll know it.

The image is a little grainy but pin sharp. But the set design is well captured and the gradually improving production budget is apparent.

While it is set in a sci-fi set up complete with fun stuff like faster than light drives and explosions in space, at heart the series is an allegory about the impact of terrorism on western democracy with a side order of religious fundamentalism and pragmatism.

If you substitute the dreaded cylons with extremist muslims/ WWII Nazis, you'll stay with this occasionally goofy soap opera at times.

I was a bit upset to discover that the entire series is available on Netflix, so the $85 dollars spent on the blu ray package seemed too steep. I'm happy to report, however, that the presence of HD Master audio and 1080p video actually makes me quite happy that we own the series rather than merely stream it. We haven't gotten into all the extra content yet, but it is also quite thorough and seems to provide even more entertainment value. We watched one extra segment describing the cgi evolution of the Cylons in season one compared with the original Lorne Green TV series. Rather comical to see circa 1970 men in Cylon suits compared to what modern CGI can produce. Each disc is stuffed with extra content like this.

Granted the Blu-ray is superior in sharpness and color but you can definitely tell the difference when the change goes from sharp to grainy.

Most of the Blu-ray DVD  was crystal clear about 75% I do not know if it was me my flat screen or my DVD player so I put in a DVD of  Battlestar Galactica (not Blu-ray) to see if there was a difference and it was fine there was no change in the movie that I could detect. I might have gotten a bad series if there is such a thing. I do not blame Amazon they are just a distributer but if you as a buyer think you can live with a detectable screen change then buy all means buy it, I am not bitter well maybe just a tiny bit but I will get over it and move on.

3431175,3,B001993Y2C,"Battlestar Galactica is an entertaining series, with a lot to like but unfortunately, some short-sighted decisions made by the producers show a decided contempt for the science fiction audience while cynically attempting to lure the general audience to the series.  It's a case of insulting the core audience in order to appeal to the general audience.  Never a good idea, and one that I'm sure many science fiction fans resent.  I just watched the BG episode Fragged, which contains many of the constant problems I have seen since watching the series after purchasing it from Amazon.com.

Episode Title: Fragged
Warning: Spoilers

This episode contained plot holes big enough to drive a tractor-trailer through.  It's a shame that the people behind this series, especially Ronald Moore, made the incredibly audience-insulting decision to have these people who have never had contact with earth utilize 20th & 21st Century colloquial English, along with slang, military acronyms and tactics (like the 5 paragraph order) in an effort to appeal to a mass audience.

On the surface this may make the reimagined Battlestar Galactica seem more realistic, but not to anyone who understands just how ridiculous and insulting this obvious pandering is.  The show seems to go out of its way to include something every episode.  I cannot help but notice use of terms like Giddyup, She shoots, she scores, and a multitude of others.  This makes the new BG less realistic than the original, not more.  A real shame, too, since the acting is excellent, the writing often very good, and the look and feel more apparently realistic.

Another complaint I have is the decision to use current military technology and uniform styles for the Colonial Warriors.  Not only is this another absurd abuse of the audience's intelligence, but the Colonies are clearly well in advance of early 21st Century earth military technology.  The equivalent would be making a movie in 1920 that is set in the 1990's amidst a fictional war in Iraq.  Naturally, the American troops attacking Iraq are dressed like doughboys and use their equipment, terminology and 1920 colloquial English.  Not only is this unimaginative, it is downright foolish.

One: The Cylons are machines.  However, the humans stranded on Kobol maintain a constant surveillance on them, and the Cylons remain oblivious to this.  Multiple scenes show the humans watching the Cylons, who remain ignorant of their surveillance.  There is a reference to the likelihood that the Cylons will launch a barrage to cover their entire area, indicating that the Cylons haven't the ability to detect the humans heat signature or motion.  The Cylons are less-advanced than the United States Armed Forces was in the year BG was produced.  Ludicrous.

Two: Laura Roslin seems to be guarded by the same soldier around-the-clock, and he is conveniently a religious man who places his oath to the military a distant second to his religious oath.  He also leaves his post to get drugs for President Roslin, but conveniently we don't see his replacement guard while he's gone.  Assuming that Roslin's press secretary gave her the drugs, this indicates that people are let in to see the prisoner without being searched.  Ludicrous.

Three: Just before assaulting the Cylon position, an argument with raised voices breaks out among the humans.  It gets very heated, but the Cylons are also apparently hard of hearing, for they don't react until Baltar fires his gun.

Four: The weak manner in which Apollo convinced Tighe to allow him to continue at his duty station is unconvincing.  Since Adama ordered Apollo's arrest, it's unlikely Tighe would countermand that order, even if he had been drinking and was a little disoriented.  It was foolish for the producers to go to the extreme of having Apollo pull a gun on Tigh during the arrest of President Roslin.  Apollo had no right to interfere and his criminal action would have to be punished regardless of the outcome of Roslin's arrest.  Everyone present witnessed Apollo's mutiny.  No military can survive if an officer mutinies and is not punished.  It's not a question of whether or not Adama's decision to arrest Roslin was correct, fair or legal.  Apollo's recourse was through the military legal system, not a personal mutiny.

Let's add to this the fact that Starbuck mutinied, too.  This is the second recent example of mutiny, which shows Adama to be a weak and incompetent commander if he allows this to go unchecked.  Shows do this all the time.  They set up a character to be intelligent, resourceful, and worthy of respect, then do things that make the character look foolish and incompetent.

The presence of Number Six in Baltar's mind has become tiresome.  If the producers couldn't find another way to include Tricia Helfer's character, they should not have made her a regular on the series.  And why would the Cylons stop at creating just six human models?  This hasn't been explained, and it is illogical.  Why make copies that would obviously be identified easily?  Why couldn't they make millions of versions?  They wouldn't worry about expense, but the producers have to.  This is why placing this limitation was ill-advised.  It is unconvincing and seems like a contrivance unworthy of the people behind this series.

The Cylon belief in a single God is unconvincing as well.  Regardless of the genesis of this belief that was shown in Caprica, these machines would be far less likely to believe in such juvenile, primitive mysticism.  Just as humans don't all believe in the same religion, Cylons wouldn't either, or they'd be just machines.  The show goes out of its way to make them human or human-like, but the constant harping on the one true God is extremely tiresome.

Science Fiction has long been enchanted with robots with human emotions.  Personally, I feel that the concept has been done to death.  Too often sci-fi makes the machines more human than the humans, whose characters are often two-dimensional.  The new BG is certainly not guilty of that, as the writing and acting for the characters is well above average for a TV series.  But there's nothing new in BG's treatment of machines with human feelings, other than, perhaps, their belief in a single God.  This belief is irrational, and it seems likely that these machines would realize that this primitive yearning has no basis in fact and is illogical and defies everything known about the universe.  I know that the Cylons have a plan, and maybe this God-belief is a ruse, but it's tiresome.

And Number Six's comment in the episode that Humans invented murder is insignificant when compared to the genocide that God committed when he set loose the Flood. God as an all-knowing, all-powerful, ever-present, loving force is patently false.  There are so many inconsistencies and outright lies in all of the major religions that the idea that a race of machines would believe in a God is not believable.

That said, I like the show.  The acting was excellent and the special effects were well-done.  At the end of the day, however, I still prefer the 1970's Lorne Greene, Richard Hatch & Dirk Benedict version.

Not only did the original have a fantastic theme and outstanding music score, especially compared to the non-descript, elevator music of the new version, but Glen Larson realized that, despite some mistakes, the Colonials who have never had any contact with Earth should not dress like our military and not have names like Earth humans.  It's too bad that the general audience cannot grasp that names like Apollo, Starbuck, Sheba, etc., might be common among another race of humans, and that their arrival on earth thousands of years ago would have been viewed as the arrival of gods.  A great concept that the new series eschewed in favor of capturing the non-science fiction audience.  To quote Lorne Greene's Adama, What a pity.  What a great, great pity.",1388707200,,7931,4.974164133738602

3431181,1,B001993Y2C,"I bought this collection several years ago and I'm only writing this review now because I see it up on the current deals and I don't want people to get duped into buying this collection.

First off, the show is great-- 4 stars easy.  It has pacing problems but whatever, if you're looking at this collection you already know you like the show.

The reason why I give this 1 star is because of the packaging-- it's atrocious.

First, the box is huge and will not fit on most shelves. In general, I'm fine with this since this is a special edition that you buy to show off. Just be warned it's huge.

Next, the toy Cylon. It doesn't fit well in its home I'm one of the few lucky ones that didn't come broken. It's cheap and not really something you can display.

Now for the really bad-- the individual season packaging.  It's in cheap cardboard sleeves that are very tight and make it hard to get a grip on the disc. The only way to get the discs out is to press down on the disc and then drag them out while pressing them against the cardboard. THIS IS TERRIBLE FOR THE DISC!  To add to the bad, there's no episode guide for the seasons either. Do you want to watch episode 12 from season 1?  Take a guess what disc it's going to be on!  Even worse, say you watch the final episode on the disc, pop in the next disc, and then see there's an extended episode for the episode you just watched!

3431241,4,B001993Y2C,"I bought the series because of two reasons: I loved the original series - watched it every week, and Lucy Lawless.  And both of those reasons didn't fail this series.  I found it to be very good.  Remakes are always hard, but this one had enough differences that you didn't feel you were just watching a remake.  Lucy was great as Number 3.  I just hated the way they ended her storyline. It would have been nice had they brought her to the new Earth somehow.

But I found there was more there, as well.  Katee Sackhoff as Starbuck was completely different, in a good way, loved Jamie Bamber as Apollo - thought he was great, Edward James Olmos is almost always amazing in his roles and this was no different, Mary McDonnell made you hate her and love her at the same time - which is very difficult to do, and all of the Cylons were good and bad throughout.  When you find yourself rooting for the same people at different times to win AND lose, it's a good show.

Bad things: They don't really explain some things in a good enough way, which leaves confusion.  Mostly it's okay, but not always.  Examples: Bringing Number 3's back just to further someone else's storyline, and leaving that model stranded alone - which is odd because that was where she was anyway; a few times, they went overboard on the violence, in my opinion, but then I'm not one for too much gore; couldn't stand the way they ""explained"" Starbuck's return.

I loved it.  If you're not into spirituality or sci-fi at all, you probably won't like it.  But if you like a little sci-fi, a lot of drama, some great lines, and a ton of action - then you'll love it.  Honestly, the last scenes of the series make it worthwhile to watch the whole ""frakkin"" thing.

The box set is well done and well thought out. The quality of the Blu-Ray discs' picture is incredible. BSG has never looked better.

Production values and acting very high quality, most episodes feel like movie quality. Doesn't fall into the sci-fi trap of having a ""planet of the week"" episodic content structure or whatever, doesn't feel like a soap opera like a lot of American TV where nothing much changes from season to season. Characters die, they develop, and they deal with ethical issues directly relevant to the real world and in particular American politics and society. A must watch. Just brace yourself for the disappointing 4th season and conclusion.

Also, as other reviewers have pointed out, make sure you get the right version of the box set, as amazon lists a few under the same page. The one in the picture, with the silver box, is the one you want.",1379376000,,914,4.573170731707317
3431297,5,B001993Y2C,"I grew up watching the original in the late 70s and loved it, and to me this is the best version of both. If you haven't seen this one but have experienced the original, then you owe it to yourself to check it out and you are in for a treat. Is a far more absorbing story than the original in every way. I had bought all the seasons of this new alternate version separately on DVD so I can give firsthand experience on both formats and this boxed set.
Pros; The clarity of picture and sound of Blu-ray (BD) High Definition goes without saying. It also includes the movie The Plan which is a nice addition to the set (not included in the DVD format versions within the individual seasons).
Cons; If you have this series on DVD and an LCD screen with an HDMI cable connection and a good home theatre sound system, then just stick with it and save your money. The picture and sound are about as good with this set up so you don't need to go for the extra mile to enjoy it.
There are grainy scenes every so often in all the episodes (which I understand where deliberate to give it a more gritty feel to the overall aspect of the story), and those are equally transferred to the BD version.
The packaging is nice and is set up as seasons 1 thru 4 with a book type case holding each set of disks for every season, with the movie 'The Plan' on a BD case by itself. Aside for a few extra details which are standard on most BD discs (navigation options, opening commentaries, etc), and the inclusion of the movie The Plan, there isn't any difference with the episodes, added interviews, commentaries, and deleted scenes which are the same as in the DVD version. If the set had included the movie Blood & Chrome and the Cylon figurine from the original special edition set, it truly would be the definite BSG series collectible. In short, if you don't have this series and can find it on BD at a decent price, I highly recommend it, hence my rating of 5 stars.. If you have it on DVD you can find The Plan and Blood & Chrome (either pre-owned or at a discount at many online and movie stores) and add them to your set and then your collection will be complete.",1379030400,3,2150,4.246341463414634

While not for everyone, it manages to pack the emotional punches of a well written drama series, as well as the intellectual and moral quandaries of classic science fiction television. If you're looking for a straight remake of the original series, you may be disappointed, as this is a fair bit darker and just a bit more twisted.

3431325,1,B001993Y2C,"After watching the entire Battlestar Galactica series I felt an acute need
to express my revulsion. It's probably too late for anyone to ever read
this review, but if you are out there - Save yourself!
Read on and put the remote control down.

This series is not ruined by plot holes so much as it is nothing but a
super-massive plot hole riddled with fractal plot holes seamlessly
descending on ever-smaller scales down to the smallest observable
level. Whereas many good stories are ruined by glaring plot holes,
Battlestar Galactica is more plot hole bonanza made all the more
irritating by occasional glimpses of interesting plot concept. But fear
not, Dear Viewer. All morsels of quality are wrung out of the show by
the later seasons arrive.

Early on in this reboot we encounter some big plot holes, but they are
the sort of thing we can overlook if they lead on to good
story-telling. For example, the Cylon ""skin jobs"" are said to be
indistinguishable from humans even under medical examination such as
X-rays, CAT scans, DNA tests etc. Yet the ""skin jobs"" can communicate
with one another and their base ships with some sort of radio
transmissions. (Which, by the way, travel over interstellar distances
immediately.) This is just to name one super-power which they do w/o
any detectable special organs or mechanism to accomplish such feats.

OK, fine. We can overlook that sort of stuff if it leads to a gripping
drama of what it really means to be human vs robot or some other
interesting slice of life. But we are not allowed to do so, because
this series commits the fatal sin of having plot holes shoot dead other
existing plot holes. If a scene in an episode needs a ""skin job"" to
overpower a human, the Cylon does so. Pow! Of course the Cylon has
super-strength ... they're machines! But if the next scene needs a
drag- out fight suddenly human and ""skin job"" strengths are evenly
matched. Because ... well ... you weren't supposed to ask that
question.

The refugee humans have only five nuclear warheads left in one episode.
in another the humans rain them down on the Cylons. In one episode
ships are ""built to withstand nuclear blasts"" and do so several times.
In another a single nuke blows up its target as well as 2-3 nearby
ships for good measure.

Well, you get the idea.

Now apply the same flaws to character motivations. Never agree to play
a drinking game where you must chug every time a character pulls a gun
on a fellow crew-member or friend. If you watch an episode where a
character stubbornly insists a certain thing must be done, be assured
at at the 38 minute mark that character will abruptly decide to do the
opposite thing. Keep an eye on the DVD clock and amaze your friends.

Most every single character the writers needs the viewer to like, isn't
likable. It's not the fault of bad acting - usually. There's enough of
that to go around, but mostly it's the fault of cheesy writing and the
aforementioned plot lurches. Put simply, these characters are idiots.
How they avoid piloting their ships into a star is a mystery. Actually
by the time it's all wrapped up they manage that too.

But the worst part of all is this sci-fi story has no sci-fi in it at
all. It does not even qualify as science fantasy. As the series goes on
the finite number of monkeys hammering randomly upon their finite
number of typewriters rely more and more upon visions and divine will.
It's hard to stay mad at the monkeys. There was really no other way to
extract the series from the preposterous mess it had become.

One of many odd, perplexing, gratuitously violent and annoying vanity
cards runs after the end credits in every episode. These provide the
perfect wormy cherry to top off every excruciating viewing experience.
Which allows me an opening to praise the production team. They miss no
opportunity to be bad.

What's that? Praise from me for some aspect of Battlestar Galactica? We
must be at the 38 minute mark in this review. Were your friends
impressed with your predictions?",1377734400,4,4014,4.640845070422535
3431326,5,B001993Y2C,It is a great blu ray disc set to watch the new Battlestar Galactica The Complete Series. It took me a month to watch all of it & it was worth it. Great sound on a surround system & HDTV system. Caught it on sale for a  very reasonable price.,1377561600,2,242,3.84
3431327,5,B001993Y2C,"BSG is one of the best TV series I have ever seen with very good acting, serious making and very neat plots.

The 20 Blu-ray discs are well packed into 8 hard plastic cases, each case holds 2-3 discs neatly with clear labellings of the various episodes at the back.  With such an excellent packings and rather low price, I can hardly complain.

Also the supplier and Amazon did a very good job for processing and delivery (it took just over a week from ordering to delivery to my home in Hong Kong).  I would strongly recommend it to anyone who is interested in serious TV series.",1377475200,4,580,4.392523364485982
3431328,4,B001993Y2C,"The series itself easily rates five stars but the packaging doesn't. Reason being Universal opted for the clear hard plastic disc holders glued in a cardboard folder instead of the soft blue plastic clamshell holders like most other blu-ray titles. Even the Lord of the Rings Extended blu-ray boxset uses blu-ray/scaled-down DVD soft black plastic clamshells which hold four discs each (one inside each cover and one on each side of an internal page disc holder) would have been most prefered above all others. With the current setup you're forced to keep the top disc out until you finish viewing the bottom disc because they're nested/stacked unless you don't care about keeping them in order; even the slim clear soft plastic DVD cases would be preferable to the plastic/cardboard format.

Also, the current setup is just as bad as the old DVD hard plastic holders when it comes to getting those discs out because you have to put more torque on the discs to pop them out which will eventually result in teeth breakage on the holder and possible disc damage/scratches since they won't be secured anymore.

The picture is absolutely awesome on a widescreen LED TV! Even the miniseries which was actually filmed not digitally recorded looks better than DVD, but you can tell the difference in the grain of film they used because it's not razor sharp like HD video but the clarity is high enough to shown every detail and flaw which unfortunately is unforgiving especially to older women like Mary McDonald because she really shows her age on blu-ray unlike DVD or VHS where her turkey neck wasn't so obvious but she's no doubt a great lady and the perfect actress for her role in this series. Unfortunately I've only just started watching these since I just received them yesterday so hopefully they started using HD video early on because I remember an interview with Edward Olmos and he's commenting about the transition from film to HD video sometime in the first or second season.

All the discs where included including the unrated Razor in the Season Four boxset and The Plan in a normal blue soft plastic blu-ray case.

It was cheaper and less aggravating to buy this complete series boxset instead of trying to buy the individual boxsets due to the prices where all over the place for new ones and you couldn't get them all from Amazon at a super discounted price like Season 4.5 and I try to only buy from Amazon when possible because I have been burned by other Amazon sellers but either Amazon or the seller fixed them but I'd rather not go through those headaches again.

3431345,5,B001993Y2C,"Ok I must admit I was a bit confused on exactly which box set of Battlestar Galactica Complete Series Blu-ray to purchase. One of the reviews I read mentioned that the silver box set included Razor (in the same case as season 4) and The Plan (also mentioned as being in the same case as season 4).  I purchased the silver box set with the Blu-ray stripe around the top and it just arrived today. I opened it right away to make sure everything I thought was included was, in fact, there. Yep. Here is what I found and I hope it helps someone else who is a bit confused on what to purchase.

My box set, again in the silver box NOT THE BLACK BOX, had Razor included as a separate Blu-ray disk and was found in the season 4 case.  The Plan was included in a separate case all by itself.  So everything was there but whomever packages this series has changed it up a bit again as, in my set, The Plan was not included in the season 4 case.  But The Plan was there albeit in a case by itself.

I have not started my Battlestar Galactica marathon yet so I cannot comment on the quality of the picture and/or sound. But since it's Blu-ray I'm expecting it to be up to Blu-ray typical standards.

In closing I will say that I must have purchased this when Amazon was having a special sale day because I paid only $89.99 for my Blu-ray series set. I had put this in my wish list back in the summer of 2012. Last week I logged into Amazon in order to purchase some other items and I saw the tremendous drop in the price so I ordered this right away.  I noticed today in writing this review that the price for this Blu-ray series set is back up to $178.99.  If you want this set, and are willing to wait a while like I did, you may want to put this item in your wish list and keep a daily eye on the pricing.",1376265600,4,1797,4.053672316384181
3431346,2,B001993Y2C,"I know I am going to offend many people.  So I hate to do this.  But I just can't help it.

I don't deny there were novel and, maybe, some original, ideas in the writing.  That's why I give it at least more than 1 star.  But the entire screenwriting is so sloppy, so lame, so simplistic, so superficial, so unconvincing in development, so naive, so unbelievably dumb that I can hardly comprehend why so many people love it in craze.  Perhaps this is a reflection that we just don't see extraordinary talents often.

As one example, the (future) intelligence depicted in the series is just lame and dumb.  The plot and story development is non-existing.  It is complete lack of imagination to write fighter dogfights at an age of space jumping in wormholes.  We understand our intelligence grows exponentially.  We know where we are now.  Perhaps it simply points out that when the series was made some 10 years ago, we were exponentially dumber (not stupid though).

I made a point of also reading the Amazon reviews. They were at best misleading.

I am more than disappointed. The writers of BSG Galactica have turned out one of the worst series I have ever seen. The plots are amateurish and plot turns are clumsy at best, The characters are caricatures and bad caricatures at that. When a character departs from type, it is not for character development but because the writer desperately needs a plot twist and is not bright enough to achieve it honestly. Some of the actors are highly skilled but they have nothing to work with. The others are beyond hope. The best of the scripts are moronic. The rest descend into idiocy. By the end of season one, the writers have telegraphed the ending so obviously that there is no suspense about the outcome.

The sexual fantasies of Galactica are geared to an age twelve audience. The same goes for the constant use of the euphemism fracking.

Galactica did clearly demonstrate why men and women should never serve together in combat conditions. I doubt that was the intent. The current news reporting about sexual assault problems in our newly integrated military forces is exactly what would be expected.

Just a final thought. It would be nice if a writer using a military context would take the time to learn at least a little about how the military actually works. But then that would require intelligent writing.

3431406,5,B001993Y2C,"As someone who was born in the mid-1970's and was a child of the 80's, I grew up knowing about ""Battlestar Galactica"" as a short-lived, sort of cool science fiction show that was also very campy and corny (a hallmark of most tv series from the mid-70's to late-80's).  It was entertaining to watch whenever it was on, but there was no great motivation to make it `appointment television'.  So, in 2003, when the Sci-Fi Channel decided to launch a re-imagined version of ""Battlestar Galactica"", there was no great pull for me to watch it.

  Now, fast forward to 2011, a couple years after the re-imagined show concluded.  Amazon had the complete series on DVD available for a great deal.  So, I decided to take a shot and get it.  I can say, without a doubt, that where it applies to my television viewing history, this is probably one of the best decisions I have ever made.  From the moment I put the pilot mini-series in my DVD player, I could not stop watching it.  I would go on marathons where I would watch anywhere from 4-6 episodes in one sitting.  Then, a year later, I did it all again.  As I'm typing this review, I'm craving a third run through the series.

  Rebooting ""Battlestar Galactica"" was a risky proposition, at best, because of the small, but extremely committed and vocal fanbase that developed over the years (not unlike the `Browncoats' for ""Firefly"").  They were fiercely loyal to the original series and wanted to see it brought back to television with all the same people.  At the vanguard of this movement was actor Richard Hatch (not to be confused with the first winner of ""Survivor""), who portrayed Apollo on the original series.  He kept interest in the show going with BSG novels that he wrote and frequent appearances at science fiction conventions.  When the re-imagined mini-series was announced, Hatch (and the original loyalists), were bitterly disappointed.  How could so many changes be made?  How could Starbuck be a woman?

  Fortunately, for all parties involved, creator Ronald Moore knew what he was doing.  He kept the very essence of the show intact, which was about humanity's struggle for survival after a brutal holocaust brought about by the evil, robot Cylons.  In the re-imagined series, the attack was much more shocking and visceral and it set the tone for the intensity of the rest of series.

  In addition to keep the core plot of the show similar, Moore also made a clever tactical move by reaching out to Richard Hatch at a convention following the airing of the mini-series.  He explained his vision for the new series and how it was still honoring the old one.  The result was that Hatch accepted (meaning many of the loyalists did, too) and even took the role of the Tom Zarek in the new series, with a seminal moment being a scene between him and Jamie Bamber (the new Apollo), which served as a metaphorical passing of the torch.

  Still led by Commander Adama (played with fierce dignity by Edward James Olmos) and partnered with President Laura Roslyn (Mary McDonnell, in a truly elevating role in her already considerable career), the `ragtag' human fleet staves off extinction at the hands of the Cylons while addressing many internal issues that also threatened humanity's survival.  Aired only a few years after 9/11, and as the Iraq War started, ""Battlestar Galactica"" did not shy away from the tough storylines:  survivor's guilt; imprisonment and torture; the cost and method of war; the role of civilians during times of crisis.

  Each of the characters, from the humanoid Cylons to the varied military and civilian humans, is a well-developed three-dimensional person.  They each have to fight the battles within themselves while also fighting the battles outside.  This series is full of top-notch drama, sci-fi action sequences that top many you will see on the big screen, and some of the most shocking (yet honest) plot twists in TV history.

  I have thoroughly enjoyed watching this series and talking about it every chance I get.  Come to think of it, after writing this review, I may just start watching it again!",1370995200,4,4101,4.8040057224606585
3431407,5,B001993Y2C,GREAT SERIES TO OWN. THANKS WATCHED IT WHEN I WAS A KID THEY DID A GREAT JOB OF REVIVING IT.,1370995200,,92,3.65
3431408,1,B001993Y2C,"First off, religion is the driving force behind BSG as it was in the original series. In fact the creator and executive producer of the original BSG and one of the writers of the remake, Glen Larson, is a Mormon. With only a basic understanding of the history of Mormonism, one can see the parallels between major events that occurred in BSG to those that took place during the early years of the LDS Church. I only mention this so you can appreciate the ""inspiration"" behind the series.

Now, on to the review:

The Props: I don't understand why 20th century technology is incorporated into the highly-advanced technology used by the Capricans. The person in charge of props should've demanded a pink slip for himself and one for the director and called it a day. Who uses 1950s microphones for meetings? Why are doors made to look like those used in submarines? Why does Adama use a common razor to shave? I could go on but the damage has been done. Even the original Star Trek got the doors right and that was back in the 60s.

The Acting: For the most part the acting was solid. I don't think you'll find anyone who came across as ""amateurish"". Some do a better job than others but everyone held their own.

The Backstory & Character Development: The Latin term ""ad nauseam"" comes to mind when I think about the excessive use of backstory and character development. In fact, I'll go so far as to say there are more episodes concerning the past than there are of the present and future. This is what slowed down the series to a painful crawl and what made it a bloated mess in the end. Yes, like anyone else, I want to care about the characters but I didn't sign up to be their biographer. I don't need to know the minutiae of their lives. Do you?

The Characters:

  Admiral Adama: How was this tyrant allowed to get away with half the stuff he pulled off and not answer to anyone for his crimes is beyond me. He was just a thug in a uniform who made more bad decisions than good. His famous lines are ""I'm done here"" or ""I'm through talking"". Wow! How enlightening. And this coming from a fleet admiral. I had to shake my head whenever Adama exercised his twisted version of morality. What was the rationale for allowing this despot to continue past the first season?

  President Rosalin: Now this woman annoyed me to no end. First, I had to get over that stupid face of hers. She looked like a ""surprised catfish"" in certain scenes and a dumbfounded hamster in others. I just wanted her to die already. Like Adama, she was a control freak who made bad decisions.

  Gaius Baltar: How the frack did this guy end up surviving is beyond me. He pretty much screwed billions of inhabitants and screwed a few more on New Caprica and then gets off for his crimes. To what end? He contributed nothing to the larger community. I'm supposed to feel sorry for this twerp? I have another pink slip and this time it's for the writers.

  Starbuck: Her annoying laugh made me want to put her in front a Cylon firing squad. She's an in-your-face character that got on everyone's nerves on the show and eventually mine as well. Throw her out of an airlock.

  The Cylons: The machines believe in one god. The production team couldn't come up with something better than this. Must machines have a sense of religion to make a failing show interesting? My hands are going up in the air right now.

There's more but what's the use. I'm a hater in a sea of BSG fans. I admit the show had great potential but it was handled by the wrong people. Way too much drama for my taste. I guess it was way too much of everything that killed it for me.

Good luck.",1369180800,7,3639,4.4

Manufactured & packaged in the UK, this is CLEARLY THE version to buy. It comes in a sturdy box containing not flimsy cardboard sleeves but regular Blu Ray/DVD containers, each holding 2 discs. Both versions of Razor are there, The Plan is not. A glossy booklet describing the major players & what episodes are on each disc accompanies the package.

Everything that appears on discs manufactured on this side of the Pond are there & play as well. However, keep in mind not all Blu Ray players are created equal, especially 1st generation. Mine is Oppo's latest BDP 103D. I've heard tell Region Free discs (not necessarily these) won't play on certain models. If this bothers you, I recommend contacting Amazon to see what their policy is on this particular matter. Normally, once the cellophane is removed from the package, it's yours.

At it's current price (some $20 below the price a year ago), it's a steal, especially considering the price we pay for our Region's version. If owning rather than renting is your ticket, but you've held back because of price, get this before it goes away.",1366848000,2,1219,4.8

Except that I must make one correction:

C. Mayo says:
""-Battlestar Galactica: The Complete Series (with COLLECTIBLE CYLON) [BLU-RAY] or the gray box [BLU-RAY] set. Recommended. I do not own this. Seems to include some extras, but not significant. It also has an episode list, according to the reviews. It might be worth buying if you wanted to get everything together.""

Not true. The SAME issues of the DVD packaging are still present. I just bought this collection because I imagined it was solved, based on the revieW, BUT NO.

There is no episode guide or list. Also THE PLAN is not included on this collection. These are the two downsides I see in this collection. Instead, I'd buy the gray box and a collectible Cylon apart.

I hope this is helpful to all of you, after all, the show is one of the best science fiction character guided series ever.

3431431,5,B001993Y2C,"First of all let me say that this not the original series; they made a LOT of changes to the show that some fans may find irksome. I actually prefer Lorne Green over Edward James Olmos as Adama. Suprisingly the character I seem to like the most in this series is President Roslin. The fact that they changed Starbuck into a girl still bothers me, but I am getting used to it. I will not even atempt to explain the character change to Boomer and Athena. This reimagining of the series has a vibe of its own, and it is GREAT! The stories are incredibly well written. This is not telivised brain candy; this is a show geared towards those who crave epic story arcs, and many multiple sub-plots. The sense of storyline continuity, and emersive sets makes you feel like you are stranded in space on the Battlestar Galactica along with the other characters. All the charachters are well rounded and developed. Like I said this is an extremely well written show.

3431439,5,B001993Y2C,"I was a bit skeptical at first, but this is truly a region-free set. It played fine in my player, no hiccups of any kind. Someone was kind enough to load up the pictures here on Amazon so I could see what this box had to offer. It's a very nice box, and includes a great booklet that gives a brief description of each episode and on which disc it is located. It also lists the bonuses for each disc. I haven't had a chance to watch everything yet, but so far it seems that the extras are the ones that are on the regular DVDs of the show, i.e. David Eick's Blogs, deleted scenes, etc.

There has been some talk about the picture looking grainy, but the fact is that's how they shot the show. There's actually a little intro thing from Ronald D. Moore in which he explains that this is 'the way it was meant to be seen'. Hokey cliche aside, this is absolutely stunning in picture and sound.

If I had anything to 'complain' about it would be:

1. The first season has no haunting female vocal over the opening credits, it's the alternate military sounding one. The rest of the seasons have the vocal.
2. They didn't put 'The Plan' in here. That would be truly the entirety of BSG
3. The booklet that comes with this has great pictures of the key characters and various info on them. However, this gives away info on who the Cylons are! If this were a gift for someone who'd never seen the show, there be spoilers in there!

None of these are not dealbreakers in any way. I am in love with this set, and I will be able to enjoy one of my fave shows in all its glory! Frakkin' A!",1361232000,71,1576,4.157377049180328

After watching Stargate Universe I gained a greater appreciation for this show. Like SGU, the makers did not pull any punches when it came to killing a popular character for the benifit of the plot and story line. The special effects were second to none. Concerning the contents of this set. You get the entire 4 Season run of the show including the Pilot, Razor and The Plan. Razor is easy to find included in the 4th Season (though it takes place during the 2nd Season. The Plan is 'hidden' in a 2 DVD Case in the 4th season, so you'll need to look for it to find it. Most of the 1st Season Episodes has audio commentaries. After that there are audio commentaries on all of the remaining season's episodes.

I was just wishing they would have showed us some bloopers that the actors made during the filming that would have made the package so much greater. Watching these episodes I was in shock and couldn't believe some of the things happened when they did. A friend of mine sent to razor to watch and I loved it so I had to see the rest of the series.

3431469,4,B001993Y2C,"Update(May 13, 2014) Four Stars:
Still a bit frustrated with the graininess of the quality, I researched and found this was intentionally done in post-production. WHY?!?!!? Don't add artifacts to ""simulate"". If you want a film look, record in film. The awful graininess only seems to be in the first few episodes and isn't as much pronounced in following episodes. Still, the series is phenomenal and best watched in BluRay. Upgraded to four stars after discovering the graininess was intentional rather than accidental.

Original Post(Feb. 1, 2013) Two Stars:
I've not watched many Blu-Ray movies, but the few I have watched had great clarity and definition to the video. The edges of objects are crisp and clear. Colors are vibrant with plenty of saturation. I'm still using the same Sony Blu-ray player with HDMI.

The only time I see the great characteristics in the BSG Blu-ray set is on CGI graphic logos/titles/credits. The rest of the video looks like slightly improved DVD quality. The audio is certainly bright and crisp which is great. Most Sci-Fi movies/shows tend to be shot with less light to create a mood. Perhaps the cameras had issues working in that environment. Being somewhat disappointed in the video quality, I'm not sure if it was worth the $125. If the quality was there, the price would have been a bargain.

I agree, the packaging is a bit sub-par. The disk carriers are glued to a piece of thick printed stock which fold over. In time, this will not hold up to any sort of regular use. The product managers should be fully aware how discriminating Sci-Fi fans can be when it comes to product delivery.

If the packaging had been better and video quality where it should be, no doubt five stars.

Overall, I will enjoy the extras and deleted scenes as well as continue to enjoy Baltar's perpetual self-delusional state of mind. :)",1359676800,,1857,4.827044025157233

I was correct in this series not being suitable for young kids thus I do not permit him to watch it alone; I sit through every episode with him with my finger on the remote ready to forward through inappropriate scenes.  The good news is we both like the show a lot & it is very entertaining.  It is a shame they made the show sexually suggestive because it could have appealed to young & older viewers both (in my opinion) without it.

3431495,4,B001993Y2C,"Ron Moore, one of the brains behind Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, took his darker view of sci-fi to the new Battlestar Galactica series with generally positive results. This isn't Star Trek by any stretch of the imagination. In fact, it's tough to compare BSG to any other sci-fi show. It combines an in-depth story arc, top-notch acting, realistic special effects, and a pseudo-documentary cinematic style to create a unique experience.

Unlike Star Trek, BSG tries to depict a gritty, realistic vision of humanity's future. In the first few episodes, a race of evil robots called the Cylons attack 12 human colonies, leaving only a few tens of thousands of humans left in the galaxy. The humans band together in a convey of ships to search for Earth.

Amongst the main characters, the acting ranges from good to excellent. In particular, Edward James Olmos as Admiral Adama is absolutely amazing at conveying the burdens of command. I first saw Olmos as Detective Gaff in Blade Runner and never could have imagined him as the star of a TV series, but he really shines. Mary McDonnell as Laura Roslin also wins plaudits as perhaps the most convincing female president ever portrayed on TV.

As much as I like individual episodes, the meta-plot as a whole is somewhat ridiculous. My eyes glazed over whenever the show ventured into pseudo-religious nonsense. I have nothing against religion, but the use of religious metaphors in BSG was always a bit too on the nose. Oddly, the show doesn't use religion to talk about morality, in the way that Star Trek was often a series of morality plays, but rather as plot devices. By Season 2, the president is running around looking for Earth based on religious prophecies. Meanwhile, everybody proclaims that the baby of a human and Cylon is the ""sign of things to come"" without ever explaining the baby's significance to the audience.

Unfortunately, the Cylons just don't work as the main villains. To put it bluntly, they're boring and not particularly threatening after the first few episodes. The idea of biological machines is never really explained satisfactorily - the Cylons appear to be exact copies of humans, even feeling human emotions, and act nothing like machines. Yet, they're supposed to be machines bent on conquering humans? The male Cylons are portrayed as boring and dull while the female Cylons are either slutty or overly emotional. As the series goes on, the Cylons are shown to be a bunch of goofy religious fanatics and the threat factor is almost completely eliminated.

Cyborgs or machines impersonating humans can work to great effect when they are used as a plot device to talk about the human condition, as in Blade Runner or with Data in Star Trek, or about the dangers of technology. However, BSG doesn't take either approach - its Cylons are just a bunch of emo thugs oddly obsessed with religious prophecies.

Overall, I love individual episodes of BSG, but I don't like the larger story or the Cylons. Individual episodes can have great character moments or engage in deep moral questions. However, when character and morals take a backseat, the series flounders. Still, it's definitely must-see television for sci-fi fans.",1356480000,3,3200,4.949720670391062

And of course, there is the fact that the show expects you to develop emotional sympathy for the Cylons, who are by definition inanimate objects.

It isn't even really a re-make of Battlestar Galactica (although it tries to throw a bone to fans of the old series in Season 3); most of the parts of it that work are ripped off of Babylon 5 (especially watch the battles in the first couple of episodes; you will literally see B5's ""self-defense grid"" come online).

3431535,4,B001993Y2C,"In the beginning (2003), this had two major strikes against it -- it was a show coming from that godawful channel (which is still pretty awful, btw), and it was --to judge by the title-- a re-make. So I ignored it during its run, although rumors and recommendations piled up, but I waited still more, despite the intriguing nerve of some friends to actually compare it to the all-time SF great ""Blade Runner."" Then the entire show was done, and released to DVD and Blu-Ray. I read the glowing detailed review over at thedigitalbits.com, decided to let it wait even more, until I made the switch to Blu-Ray. Besides, the first release had bunches of notorious packaging issues that have since been resolved by the second release. Then I did switch to Blu-Ray in Sept 2011 (for Star Wars, my template). Finally, after trying to haggle with the local Best Buy and Barnes and Noble, I actually got the set this spring.... here.... on Amazon.com. (It's a bit of a tragedy that we are less and less able to get things off-line anymore....)

I had watched the original series a few years ago in ""preparation"" for this -- the new series jettisons most connections quickly. This is as hardcore and as serious as SF drama can get, and that's no light praise -- I can be Very critical, especially of recent (ie, last 20 years') attempts at SF. While there are inevitable stumbles that effect any TV show, BSG Redux is so busy with great plots and characters that most such mistakes will be quickly glossed over, or turned around, or changed into a much improved scenario. Any characters that I had a hard time appreciating or taking seriously at first usually improved over time, either on his/her own, or through the miracle of Cylon replica(n)tion.

Dynamic visuals, set decorations, good props: check

Complex interactions and issues, dealt with realistically and with dramatic flair: 90% of the time, and always enough to keep people talking, guessing, speculating; quick n' easy spoon-fed solutions are few and far between here. It's all about the questions, not the answers.

Sound design: mostly really good. For some reason, some of the dialogue is strangely a little bit off balance, but hey, that's partly what subtitles are for.

Music Score: Well, at first, and a lot of the time, it's just drums...you know....*military*, complete with vaguely Irish-Scotch anthemy-type stuff. Then, starting with the vaguely ""Bolero""-type piece from the first season finale, the score grows.....and grows ever more complex and beautiful and engaging. Even ""All Along the WatchTower,"" so strangely and awkwardly forced into Sn 3's finale, grows into an engaging plot point later on.  Season 4 is full of great scoring, and everyone pitches in during the final episodes, pulling no stops, as documented in that season's documentaries about the music. (Compared to the really weird parody of a doc about music for Sn3)

Extras: Commentaries, a mass of deleted or alternate scenes for most episodes, silly (but kind o' fun) games, ok vid-blogs, behind/scenes stuff, mostly a fairly standard selection, with a few standouts, including the infamously funny ""What the Frak"" recap of Sn.s 1-3.

In some cases there are extended versions of a handful of episodes -- always watch the extended versions.
Most of the webisode sets are here, except for ""Face of the Enemy"" (mid season-4), but I had no problems watching it on Hulu.

Also, a quick note about viewing order. I've seen others' recommendations (you can do a search and see those lists, too). Here's my take:
1) The 2003 miniseries, and Season 1
2) Season 2
3) ""Resistance"" webisodes (Sn3, Dc2)
4) 3x9 ""Unfinished Business"" extended episode -- very much a flashbacky story anyway
5) ""Razor flashbacks"", then ""Razor"" (Sn4, Dc 1)
6) Season 3
7) Season 4, with ""Face of the Enemy"" webisodes between episodes 10 & 11
As for ""The Plan,"" there are many options. A lot of the story takes places before and during the first two seasons of the show -- however, just after Sn2 is still too soon to watch this. The best time to watch this is any time between mid-Sn3 and mid-Sn4. Sure, there's a risk of still spoiling a major Sn3 finale development, but not very muchly. To watch ""Plan"" after the series just exposes it for what it really is--- a bit of an anti-climax.",1348358400,2,4294,4.831292517006803
3431536,5,B001993Y2C,"I had never watched an episode of the original Battlestar, nor had I watched an episode of this one when it was actually on the air.  I just bought the blu ray set after hearing how good the show was.  I am glad I did.

Given what I said above I cannot really compare the two series.  I know that when this series was initially planned fans of the original series considered it almost a sacrilege.  I am honestly not sure if you were a fan of the original series how this one holds up.  My guess is by now you have already made that determination.  I really like the story that is presented in this series.  The human vs cylon, humans being enslaved, then eventually having to work with some of the cylons was presented extremely well.  There were a lot of twists in the story that could make it difficult to follow at times.  I definitely think watching the entire series from beginning to end without any break actually helped in that regard.

I am also one who liked how the twist at the very end of the series worked out.  I am not going to spoil it here (even though most people who are reading this by now know how it turns out).  I managed to stay spoiler free and did not see it coming.  I thought it was creative and well done.  I have not really heard of many people being in the middle on how the series end.  Most I have heard either like it or hate it.

Battlestar is a show that touches on a lot of subjects.  Religion, ethics, betrayal, love, prejudice and class systems are just a few of the topics the show delved into.  The acting was top notch, with a mix of well known actors and relative unknowns.  And then there was also the plus of lots of Tricia Helfer and Grace Park gratuitous nudity throughout, which was definitely not a bad thing.  This version of the set is not packaged all that well.  Some of the later ones have incorporated episode lists into the packaging to make it easier to follow.  Although I did not find it all that hard to figure out what the sequence was.  I definitely recommend the series for any fan, or someone who likes the sci-fi genre and have heard about how good the series is.",1347840000,,2130,4.241293532338308

3431561,4,B001993Y2C,"Okay, the Short Version:

In a nutshell?  Skip the complete set and go for the individual (Blu Ray) sets of Seasons of 1 - 3.  There isn't a huge price savings to be made by buying the complete set, and by sticking with seasons 1 - 3 you can skip the fourth season.  (Okay, I'm biased against Season 4. Not my favorite.  But I'll get to that later.)  The visual quality of all Blu Ray discs is solid - not great, mind you, but solid - and as good or better then the DVD's.

The Long Version (In Which I Discuss the Content itself):

The first 2  seasons of ""Battlestar Galactica"" earned my unreserved attention and respect.  The writing and acting were always solid, at the very least, and often reached the rarified level of great - a minor miracle, considering the show aired on the Sci-Fi Channel.  (Even the smaller parts, parts that on other shows would be anonymous - like the deckhands - were given distinct personalities.)  ""Battlestar"" managed to take many of the usual trappings of science fiction and genre fiction (killer robots, spaceships, space battles, square-jawed guys in uniform and ""babes"" in red dresses) and balance them with a keen interest in the nature of political systems, military life, and a pragmatic view of what life might really be like after genocide.  Indeed, I've rarely seen a fictional show as interested in politics as ""Battlestar"" was in its first 2  seasons.  And I usually don't like political shows; I think that they have a tendency to become a little too strident and preachy.  (And, regardless of whether I agree with the political points being made or not, I don't like to feel as though I'm being preached to.) But ""Battlestar Galactica"" usually managed to avoid this trap.

And though shot on the Scifi Channel's budget (which is proportionately small compared to what other channels can shell out), the show's camera and effects work was polished. It routinely looked like a show with a much bigger budget.  The interior shots of the Galactica rarely looked like they were shot on a soundstage, and the space battles were grand, clear, and coherent (despite the use of the shaky cam).

The production design and exterior photography were handsome as well.  One particular example: the look of New Caprica in Seasons 2 & 3 - the people and their environs - is exactly right.  Everything looks thoroughly hardscrabble and lived in; oddly enough, making a positive visual comparison to a film like `McCabe & Mrs. Miller' would not be uncalled for here.

And, lest I forget, the musical score by Bear McCreary was often much richer than standard TV fare, perfectly underscoring and complementing scenes.

Yep.  The first 39 episodes are absolutely fantastic - worthy of five stars. (Again, that's about 2  seasons worth of episodes.)

But somewhere in the midst of Season 3, things seemed to start going sideways.  I'm not quite sure why - perhaps it was because the writers didn't know where to go after the epic `New Caprica' storyline - but the show began to veer too far into melodrama.  Whereas before the personal stories and romantic subplots were balanced by the writers' seeming dedication to unsentimental realism, in later episodes they let the former aspects dominate the latter.  And so, by season four, this once great show had been undone by its own melodrama and mythology.

In Season 4, we get Dr. Baltar as a vapid messiah in an underwritten subplot that never really goes anywhere. We get an increasingly overheated and yet curiously static Final Five subplot that made me regret ever wondering about their identities. Characters behave out of character, and the acting has suddenly gone down the drain. And instead of a show that tempers melodrama with a hard spun, pragmatic view of life after genocide, we get a bunch of soapy drama and yelling.  It's this last season and a half that pull the show down from a five star rating.

Bottom line?  Grab seasons 1 - 3, and skip Season 4.",1343865600,3,3950,4.753303964757709

BSG is my favorite TV SciFi .

But, there are too many ?unnecessary?  ""extras"" in this set. Leave out the extended versions and cut the number of disks. Leave out the commentary, that drives me nuts when I am starting a new episode, and though I did NOT select to hear it, it comes on. But not on all disks!

When viewing the ""setup"" procedure, commentary is NOT selected by ME. I must be the Cylons!

What ""ruined"" the BluRay version for me, having seen the DVD, was ""The Plan."" It revealed many of the ""secrets"" about humans and Cylons that you had to wait and anticipate by watching the entire series. Now the miniseries did some of that but it wasn't as detailed as ""The Plan."" And, I watched the miniseries after viewing the entire series, though they recommended that one watch it first.

3431590,4,B001993Y2C,"Science fiction television is an interesting bag; one where all it takes a brief look at the multitude of space-centric serials and films throughout the years to realize that almost any genre of entertainment can be accomplished within the confines of a ship traversing the void of the universe.  I'm a huge fan of the latter Treks, Babylon 5, Farscape and even the (original) Star Wars films.  Naturally the reimagined Battlestar Galactica has been on my radar for some time now and I actually waited to purchase the complete collection rather than to piecemeal the odd seasonal releases.

Last night represents my completion of the program from miniseries on through to series finale and I have spent the past 24-hours attempting to sort through the experience so as to assemble a review containing (hopefully) not quite as much drama as the series itself.

To begin at the beginning, the 2004 miniseries/ pilot of Battlestar Galactica is one of the finest pieces of science fiction television in recent years.  The pacing is spectacular, the acting top notch, the plot epic in scope and it leaves the viewer anticipating, no craving the series that would follow.  I was especially impressed with the special effects; as it was extremely difficult to tell if the space scenes/ battles were CGI, miniatures, or some combination of both.  Camera work that included wild pans and off-timed zooms added to the realism and unlike so many contemporary space opera pieces, avoided the tendency to show scenes from a perspective that could not be achieved with an actual physical camera.

Couple this to a score that is mournful and haunting and top it all off with some major motion picture acting and what results is the formula for a show Time magazine would hail ""the best show on television"".

The first season picks things up quite seamlessly and introduces a whole new set of problems for our primary cast of characters to work through.  All the while the viewer is treated to a believable and interesting unveiling of the mysterious Cylon attackers who dropped humanity to their proverbial knees in the beginning of the miniseries.

The second season carries on this tradition of excellence but the third takes a slight dip.  The fourth and final season starts out nearly as strong as the pilot then fizzles out- horribly.  Without giving up spoilers, let me do my best to justify my opinions.  The miniseries was solid space opera through and through but as the show gained momentum it took a decided turn for the dramatic.  That interesting and purposely-unstable camera work I praised in the miniseries becomes heavily overdone by about the midway point of the show, particularly in moments of close-cropped character interaction.

There is no denying that character development is always in the forefront here but oftentimes to the point where the fact that the show takes place in space with technology that can allow matter to surpass the speed of light are totally irrelevant in favor of political squabbling, odd religious overload and sexual escapades that could make a college frat house jealous!  Individuals who fear technobabble need not be afraid to invest in Ronald D Moore's Battlestar Galactica so long as they are willing to accept a whole lot of tragedy-driven prime time television drama.

I mentioned my ranking of the seasons and to that end, by the third season space and technology had all but faded entirely in favor of an Indiana Jones/ Allan Quartermain style adventure of piecing together prophesies from ancient texts and visiting booby-trapped abandoned temples in effort to piece together a map to find the planet earth.  What follows is a bit of messiness- again I will avoid direct spoilers in this review but will say that when the show reaches its ultimate conclusion, it does make one wonder what the point to some of this section actually was.

The fourth season starts off with renewed vigor; laying down all sorts of layered mystery and prophecy amidst some pretty intense battle sequences.  The problem, in my opinion, is that the show's finale fails to live up to the intrigue presented.  There are multiple instances of unsolved mystery, foreshadowing that never pans out and strong evidence that the show's writers did not have an entire story arc mapped out ahead of time.

Especially troubling is that the heavy-handed religious integration that is so overwhelmingly force-fed to us throughout the span of the show ends up fizzling out by the end.  Considering its implied importance all along, one really starts to suspect that it will play a crucial role in the conclusion of the series yet its significance is never fully fleshed out.

In all, despite was looks like a laundry list of complaints, BSG is undeniably entertaining television.  While many of the writing choices are odd at best, the viewer can consistently count on wonderful acting, amazing visuals and some intense drama from start to finish.  When compared to campy and predictable entries to the genre like Stargate Atlantis, Battlestar Galactica does manage to achieve a sense of grandness typically associated with big-budget motion pictures rather than weekly television.  The tragedy, as far as I'm concerned anyway, lies in thinking what the show could have been had it not become bogged down with political and religious agendas; a true continuation of the vibe established in the miniseries.

The material certainly does nothing to discredit the original series and in fact adds several welcomed layers of depth to the human versus our artificially intelligent robotic creations (a theme visited in everything from The Terminator to The Matrix to Captain Power).  Time magazine wasn't too far off in their assertion but there was still a bit of room for improvement.",1337558400,2,5790,5.019853709508882

It is easy to figure out, however, when you're trying to get a movie to watch everything falls out of the package, like you're holding hot potatoes.  The little Cylon is awesome.

in germany you get the whole series, all 4 Seasons, all webisodes, and all the following movies, like razor etc, in one complete box, for just 50 bucks, with english language too, it is just Region Code 2 , sorry",1336435200,,223,4.333333333333333
3431595,2,B001993Y2C,"First off, for all you frakking Toaster lovers out there, do not buy either the ""Battlestar Galactica: The Complete Series (with Collectible Cylon) on Blu-ray or DVD.  This is not a review of the TV show itself, which is a shining example of science-fiction at its best, nor is this a review of Amazon (they were perfect as always), but this is a review of the packaging in which Universal Studios atrociously decided to place this angel of a series.  The only reason I gave this product 2 stars instead of 1 is simply because the boxed set is visually quite cool; it would look excellent on display in the living room.  Unfortunately, appearance is the only thing going for the packaging.  The box is immediately difficult to open to access the individual seasons, and once it is fully open the individual seasons have to be removed at an awkward angle that requires a gentle hand in order to not tear the cardboard.  All the disks are housed not in the typical plastic cases that suspend the disks and prevent their delicate surfaces from being scratched, but they are tightly squeezed in CARDBOARD sleeves.  Removing the disks a few times will scratch them and eventually render them useless.  Also, the disks were out of order: 1, 4, 3...  That is inexcusable.  There is no episode guide, which is a pure lack of foresight on Universal, and to top it all off, The collectible cylon's right foot was broken off.  It seems as if they put all of their energy into designing an awesome looking box, then said, ""whatever,"" to everything else.  So, to reiterate, this is an awesome show, but DO NOT buy either the Blu-ray or DVD versions that come WITH the Collectible Cylon, the packaging from Universal Studios is horible.  INSTEAD, buy the newer Blu-ray or DVD versions that come in the smaller silver/grey boxes WITHOUT the cylon.  From what I have read of these, the packaging is much improved and simplified, and an episode guide is included.  One last note, Amazon is golden.  The package arrived so well packed I could not imagine a human baby being better protected.  I hope this clears things up about what to buy.

P.S. I would like to add that since buying and returning this item, I have bought ""Battlestar Galactica"" on Blu-ray per each individual season. Each season was well packaged in traditional plastic holders that suspend the discs and I was able to watch each disc with plenty of time to check everything for errors (in case I had to return the set).  It was also much cheaper.  Each season I bought was only about $20.00, and since there are only four seasons I spent far less than I would have for the entire series in one boxed set.  So, bottom line, buy each season individually.",1335398400,11,2704,4.628930817610063
3431596,2,B001993Y2C,"The Blu-Ray disks themselves are great - the visuals are very good and the sound track is great. The collectible Cylon version of the series is a complete mess from a packaging perspective. The outside box is flimsy and mine arrived with a broken corner (like everybody else). The individual season packaging is a flimsy paper box with a fanfold insert holding the disks themselves. The opening is too tight for my hand to pull out individual disks without sliding out the whole fanfold organizer. When you do that, the disk go everywhere because there is nothing holding them on the sides. Several of the fanfold inserts were coming unglued. I just put all of the disks in paper sleeves and will look for some sort of box to hold them. If it wasn't $115 on a Gold Box special, I would return the whole mess. And to add insult to injure, the Cylon is a cheap 10$ toy and there is no episode list or book or anything else to distinguish this set from the reglar complete series set (which would at least have usable packaging).",1335139200,,1026,4.491978609625669

Unfortunately, one of the things that prompted us to buy this series in this fashion was the inclusion of subtitles.

The subtitles are invaluable, but are nowhere to be found on the final episode - exactly where we wanted them most.

3431605,5,B001993Y2C,"I was 13 when the miniseries first aired. I watched it, got bored, and never continued past that. Now, at the ripe old age of 21, I decided to try it out again and found it to be the most intense, thrilling, and enjoyable television experience I've ever had. This is science fiction for adults - no black and white morality, no good guys or bad guys, no easy, comfortable lessons. It's raw, gritty, character-driven story telling for grown-ups. And it's frakking fantastic.

I blew through the entire series on Netflix in about two and a half weeks over winter break. After two weeks of withdrawal, I went out and purchased a Blu-Ray drive and this series, which I'm now in the process of re-watching. I've never re-watched anything so soon, and I'm planning to watch it a third time with commentary right after. My only complaint about this set is that, like others have said, the extended editions are on different discs. I don't quite get why they just didn't include the extended episodes as the default. Additionally, the video quality is good, though the grainy effect can be quite jarring in some places. Of course, this isn't anything to do with the Blu-Ray, but it's more noticeable in full HD than it was on Netflix.",1328918400,2,1226,4.649769585253456

3431615,4,B001993Y2C,"First let's get this out of the way.
If you're thinking of buying the Blu-ray version expecting to have some nice visuals don't bother . . . seriously.
Even a regular old DVD can provide better visuals/picture than what they ended up with here.
They shot this series in 1080p, but they've gone with this ""Artistic"" grainy effect that really just ruins it - it's like buying a Super Computer to do Word Processing.
This is a prime example of ""Artistic"" gone absurd - pretty much like the whole ""Politically Correct"" thing.

I watched most (if not all) of the original BSG series way back, so I expected this to be pretty much an updated remake.
It is, and it isn't.
The Cylons are more varied, as there are both Mechanically and Human-like versions.
The plot varies quite a bit from the original BSG line, and it's definitely a bit darker.

There are a few boring episodes, the spiritual aspect is a bit puzzling, and the ending is a fair bit different, but overall it a pretty good series.
I took off a star for the visual quality, and considered taking off even another since it (visual) is so disappointing.",1326240000,,1109,4.54
3431616,5,B001993Y2C,"Someone I know suggested that I watch this show.  He's a huge Star Trek fan, and while I don't mind the show, I never really followed.  This gave me some preconceived notions of what Battlestar Galactica might be like.  I'm glad I got over those notions!  Battlestar is a gritty, intense character and story driven series.  All the main characters and even some of the more important minor characters well be fleshed out and in great detail.  I also thought that the characters were very deep and multidimensional, so it added a fair amount of realism (on the personal level.)  The story will keep you on the edge of your seat while you watch the fleet suffer through its journey (some good times will be had, but there is a lot of crazy things that happen to everyone involved!)  I really like how most of the questions one might ask are answered (or resolved) by the time the show ends.

When watching this show, one might find him/herself  questioning ideas about politics, religion and social/ethical values.  I certainly did, and for me, this was a very attractive aspect of watching Battlestar.

At any rate, experiencing Battlestar Galactica for the first time should be about surprises.  They do a great job playing their hand close to their chest, and you definitely are made to wait to find a lot of things out.  You might be curious to read up on it on Wiki or hit the forums for more information, but chances are you'll ruin some surprises.  Also, the ""webisodes"" are quite boring.  Save'em for after the show, if you're interested in watching.  (they might be a little less annoying if they stitched them all together so you didn't have to load a 4 minute clip 10 times over to complete them.)",1326153600,2,1706,4.614617940199335
3431617,5,B001993Y2C,"Science Fiction is my favorite genre. I love the genre because unlike a lot of other genres it's able to speak to the world's problems while giving us awesome gadgets! Fantasy can try, but it's not quite the same. Science Fiction often has major scale, amplifying our own circumstances in a futuristic age allows us to distance ourselves from the action on screen but recognize the similarities within.

Of course a lot of Science Fiction these days throws out the subtext in favor of popcorn flavoring. While I'll watch some Sci-Fi that lacks subtext, it's always better when it means something. Battlestar Galactica automatically had subtext built into its core. The Cylons, man-made machines who have gained awareness believe in one god, and they are trying to eradicate the polytheistic humans. Ah, yes, proselytizing starts off what becomes many instances of grand subtext.

The thing about Battlestar is that it doesn't prize one side over the other, recommending in the end that each side come to grips with the other; learn to live with one another. It touched on a lot of other issues we find prevalent in the modern world though: genocide, terrorism, the role of the military, diplomacy, etc. It did all of this in such a way that it never felt preachy nor did it particularly ever really choose one side over the other in certain cases, it just presented the options. In others it opened up about the atrocities, reflecting a light back at us showing society as it is, warts and all.

The writing on the series was always brilliant, and as cheesy as using words like ""frak"" to replace modern day curse words may have sounded at first the replacement curses feel organic and are used to great effect. The tension throughout most of the series is palpable, and the writers and creators walk a fine line between sci-fi and fantasy, but they do it masterfully. Special effects on this series bear out the brilliance of the writing, even on a SyFy budget the series looks amazing for an epic space-set series.

Battlestar also has an amazing cast that unfortunately always seemed to get looked over when it came time for the Emmy's. Mary McDonnell does a spectacular job as the Secretary of Education who recently found out she has cancer and is thrust into the position of President when everyone else in the government is killed. Edward James Olmos is perfection as a nearly retired General Adama who finds himself back in action after a massive Cylon attack. For my money, though, Katee Sackhoff tops the cast as the tortured, reckless, and brilliant pilot Starbuck. She hits every note of her nearly bipolar character with utter passion and conviction.

Unlike many I had no qualms with the way the series ended. Many felt that it copped out in its ending, but I felt that it greatly expressed many themes of the series. In the end the humans feel as though they're finally able to start over, but then there's a moment that gives us all a sense that this happened before and it will all happen again. There's a sense in there that if we do not learn our past, do not pass down what we see now, we are doomed to repeat the same mistakes over and over again. They did this with a bit of fantasy play, and not all of the questions are answered in the end which turned off many viewers, but in the real world not all questions are answered.

Battlestar Galactica lands on my top 10 list for these reasons, and because in the end it's still a story about people trying to survive. All of this from a show that is also a remake. I also appreciate the fact that the producers of the show did this on their own terms. While the show was still popular and a critical darling they opted to end the series after four seasons, something that's unheard of in American TV that prides itself on profitability over creativity.

5/5

As to the blu ray set, the quality is superb, the packaging is excellent, and there are so many extras I'll probably never get through it all. Besides adding my rating to the pool, I wanted to create this review to speak to a couple of other issues I read about in previous ones.

In my set, ""Razor"" is included in the season 4 case as the first disc, and ""The Plan"" has it's own case, and is placed at the end of the 4 seasons, so it appears that issue has been fixed.

Also, I haven't had any audio sync issues at all. Everything is crystal clear and awesome, so I guess that issue has been fixed as well.

My only gripe is that the ""Resistance"" webisodes are on the second disc of season three, and it seems like they could have put them on disc 1 since they should be viewed before the start of season 3. It was annoying having to swap discs around to watch chronologically, but not enough to take a star away.",1323993600,2,993,4.134715025906735
3431623,5,B001993Y2C,"The five star rating is for the series, and if you're browsing this page having never seen the show before I highly encourage you to check it out. But if I were to rate the product by itself, I'd drop it down just a tiny bit for a small, but fairly huge, packaging flaw.

This box set does, fortunately, include all the movies associated to the show, which are the original Mini-Series (otherwise known as the 2-part, 3-hour Pilot film, and it's labeled as Season 1, Disc 1), ""Razor"", which was released before the premiere of Season 4, and it appears in the Season 4 box as Season 4.0, Disc 1, and finally, ""The Plan."" However, the inclusion of this is very flimsily done and feels like an afterthought. Even though ""Razor"" gets its own DVD case, ""The Plan"" is lazily shoved in the same DVD case as Season 4.0, Disc 4 (in other words, placed right in the middle of the entirety of Season 4). This isn't a huge problem if you've already watched the show, but this could be an issue for new viewers.

NEW VIEWERS, DO NOT WATCH ""THE PLAN"" UNTIL AFTER YOU'VE SEEN THE END OF THE SERIES. Even though ""The Plan"" does take place, chronologically, mostly in the earlier parts of the series and is designed to fill in story gaps from the first two seasons, I'm pretty sure there are a couple spoilers mentioned in it that might ruin the end of the series. So if you're confused on the placement of this disc in this set, it's probably best to avoid it until you finish the rest of Season 4.

Despite this design flaw, the set is still perfect. The silver box looks very nice and the individual DVD sets are all great. Word of advice, though: make sure, when you pull out a season box from the set, that you pinch the sides. You'll see what I mean.",1323216000,4,1739,4.328220858895706

Now to my WARNING, if you are like me you want to see everything from the series including both of their movies The Plan and Razor, well they are included on the blu-ray collection a + for the product, but nowhere on the amazon product description does it says so. So I ended up ordering Razor blu-ray separately as to have a full collection, at this point I had forgotten about The Plan movie and now I have made an unnecesary purchase and thats a double - in my book so thats where my 4 star rating comes.

show to jump off from and shatter our preconceptions, and 'Battlestar
Galactica' uses the sci-fi series, and the idea of human versus robot
wars the same way.

This is thinking person's sci fi, in the tradition of Arthur C. Clarke,
or Isaac Asimov. It's about why we are how we are, what it means to be
a human being, morality under constant pressure in times of war,
fathers and sons, impossible loves, metaphors for modern and recent
politics and real world situations.

My wife, far from a sci-fi fan was hooked after 3 episodes, and we tore
through 5 years of shows in just a few days. It's that addicting.

The acting is all at least quite good, and some cast members are
remarkable, creating characters full of depth, complexity and
contradiction. The writing is terrific, allowing the characters to
change and grow, but always in ways that make sense, creating seemingly
inexplicable conundrums, only to find surprising, sometimes shocking -
but ultimately logical and satisfying - ways to explain where they've
taken us. The special effects are generally very impressive for TV,
even if they're not really why you watch this show.

It also has some of the most tense episodes of television I've ever
seen, and some of the season enders left me completely wrung out and
blown away. I was sad to get to the last episode, just as one is sad to
finish a great book.

Speaking of ending, the one serious let down for me was the very last
episode. Certainly no disaster, but for perhaps the only time in the
series, some of the answers felt disappointingly flat and simplistic.

But that wasn't enough to take away from the tremendous esteem with
which I hold the show. One that is surely worth your time.

I haven't bought it in other forms, so I can't compare, but generally
this blu-ray set (the non-Cylon box) is quite complete, and well packaged.
However, I have read accounts that quality control was a bit of a problem
and I didn't escape the bugs. On a couple of my discs there was
a slight 'pulse' to the image at times. At first I thought perhaps
it was a strange, but intentional, lighting effect, but looking at it carefully
it seemed more a reproduction problem.

This isn't just the intentionally added grain, a look I don't love, but accept
as an artistic decision.

Since then, I've read similar comments from others, so I'm not crazy
(or at least not in this case!). So, if you do order this, you might want
to make sure it's returnable, and try to do a quick quality check the best
you can. Of course, if the problem is intermittent, and mostly in the later
discs, as was in my case, by the time I saw it it was way too late
to ask for an exchange.

None-the-less, for me, the quality of the content way over-rode the
occasional image problems (and I'm a perfectionist - my wife
never noticed the pulsing until I pointed it out.).

Also, right now a region free blu-ray box set is selling on Amazon
UK for about $140 with shipping. It seems to have all the same
extras. A better deal (for as long as the price lasts...)",1320796800,,3408,4.521951219512195

3431634,1,B001993Y2C,"As a sci-fi buff and huge fan familiar with a variety of shows in this genre, I genuinely fail to understand all the positive reviews about this show. This was a tedious series, with tedious, insipid plot lines populated by equally tedious, two-dimensional characters who, worst of all, are unlikable too. Throughout the run of the show there was not one person I could sympathize with. Let's forget for a second that they completely ruined the dynamic of the original show by turning ""Starbuck"" into a woman who acts like a man who is wondering how a woman would act like if she were acting like a man, and that ""Boomer"" turns out to be a (very annoying and lame) Cylone, but contents wise the show also left much to be desired. I can certainly live with the gender change had it be done in a believable way creating actually likable characters. But that is juts one of the issues with this show.

The premise is pretty interesting and I had some serious hopes for the series but after the whole Nip/Tuck-Melrose Place interludes we got of the hot, six-foot tall sex kitten seducing that man (Dr. Baltar) against the wall it was pretty clear that this show was never going to be anything but a lame space version of some day-time soap, relying more on flashy, stylized scenes and equally flashy deliveries than actual contents and character development and with it quality. I believe that if they had cast Star Trek: Voyager today, they wouldnt have picked a middle aged Kate Mulgrew for the part but some 25 year old hot chick with an impressive rack. It is pretty obvious that the role for the ""Model SLASH Actor"" bimbette in this show was written in there for ratings; something which took away from the quality of the show and its contents, by appealing to cheap marketing tools and male hormones to tell a story basically. I am all for attractive leads but not as a substitute for contents.

Here are the other serious shortcomings of the show:

+ The enemy is vague and uninspiring and we never find out their reasons for this bloody vendetta of actually going after and hunting down BSG to eradicate human kind. We also never find out what happened in those forty years they were away, why they sought revenge and came back and what else their motivations are - or even _who_ they are. Four seasons passed and all that was untouched and remained unresolved. Instead, the show spent a lot of time involving the characters in petty internal conflicts where they bicker back and forth and connive against each other in a typical soap-opera fashion. If there hadnt been spaceships flying around and if the characters weren't wearing uniforms and reciting sci-fi jargon, you'd think you are in The OC.

+ Another annoying element was the whole NYP-Blue/unsteady cam thing that was employed a lot when they were showing the bridge crew and other things. It just gave the show the feel of some cop show a la SVU or The Closer.

+ As mentioned above, the characters themselves are uninspiring and annoying, which makes it really hard to root for them or empathize with their cause even. At some point i was seriously hoping someone would punch Starbuck in her fat face and throw that lame president woman, played horribly by Mary McDonnell - who is apparently only capable of the same three expressions - out of an airlock.

+ One important element of good movie making is creating characters that are not only believable and who inhabit their roles but also characters people can identify with; BSG failed on all accounts as it created fundamentally unrewarding, dull characters. Certain themes in the human consciousness are universal regardless of actual settings - be it sci-fi or film noir or a Western. Even villains the audience can ""like"" if done right. The stories here were just all over the place, silly and boring, not very intelligent and just too soap-opera-ish, caught up with the minutiae of the characters' petty issues and side tracked by insincere melodrama instead of focusing on the story and the adventure.

+ As someone mentioned earlier, the cast uniformly looks like they're acting and you can almost tell when they called ""action"" a minute ago. It is also frustrating to see that these last human beings who are chased by a genocidal race waste so much time and energy fighting and sabotaging each other over completely trivial crap too. You get to the point where you feel like there really is not hope for humanity and that maybe they all seriously deserve to die, given the sheer worthless people they are - in and out. Not a single character is convincing and believable as a real person - be it through their actions or words or personality - and as stated above, the cliches are being employed in the plenty as well, with each character fulfilling one role, namely that of leader, hero, warrior, tough girl, disturbed genius, seductive siren, angry drunk.  It is almost as if the network took the producers and writers aside and gave them a laundry list of plot devices and factors that had to be included in the show before it got the green light. Just pil'em up boys.

What gets me is that this could have been sooooo good. These people are going through half the galaxy on a space ship to find Earth or a home. Imagine all the possibilities that could have been created such as encountering strange spacial phenomena and landing on different planets and making all sorts of contacts with alien species. An adventure. Instead it just morphed into some overtly politicized soap opera taking place in space. They dumbed the whole premise down to fit the attention span of the MTV generation (and I am in mid 20s, so it's not like I am some nostalgic old person who cant get over the past).

+ Also, since the Cylones already had control over everything and didn't need to infiltrate anyone, the whole story line about Dr. Baltar and his imaginary Cylon bombshell, said hot chick from above, who was just a computer chip implanted in his brain, for all these years seemed superfluous. How did that contribute to the story?  Why was it relevant other than every now and then inserting some stylized sex into the plot to distract from the otherwise bland, boring plot. Again, obviously just kept in to make up visually for what the show lacks in substance and contents.

+ Speaking of which, aside from being all over the place, lousy acting and two dimensional characters, there was also nothing intelligent ever tackled in the story lines. No attempts were made at science, philosophy, the human condition, regret, redemption and just answering the tough questions - nothing. There was a huge potential there frankly requiring a stellar and creative writing team, not these comatose drone of writers who are just working on orders for the networks and allow marketing strategies and the bottom line dictate the art.

+ And let's not even talk about the ending where they land on this new Earth and decide to destroy their technology and basically be what? Nomads living in caves? Spread out, no technology, no medicine, no supplies, no tools. ""Oh look there is a mountain, I'd like to trek there."" And then what? What happens when you break your leg or get malaria maybe or have a kidney stone? It was just silly. It didn't make sense how these people were imagining to work things out - reverting back to cave-man standards? Without anything? Everyone who camped in the woods knows there is nothing easy about it. And did any of the people actually mate with one of the native apes? Seriously? I like the premise of the cylone/human hybrid being the Mitochondrial Eve but the whole story about how they decided to just settle on the planet without anything seems unrealistic and bizarre. Truth is that these are in fact NOT primitive caveman so 1) you cannot expect them to live and intermingle with the natives and 2) I doubt they'd have a great life there after 2 or 3 years of hard work where their lives consist of looking for berries to fill their stomachs, and shelter while hoping they can dodge the next illness. There was nothing romantic and liberating about it really and thus just not very convincing at all. In a way I feel sorry for them having to live out their lives on an essentially empty planet.

In summary, under the guise of the label ""sci-fi"", this show was nothing but an unintelligent, boring and trite tech savvy version of something like Melrose Place or 90210. They just piled up all the cliches they could, thinking this would be a sure win-win situation ratings wise. I would say skip this boring, dumb piece of garbage that is trying to pass as a sci-fi show, unless you enjoy day-time soaps or Lifetime movies while at the same time also being tolerant toward some sci-fi elements interspersed in between for show.",1316390400,17,8778,4.691558441558442

3431638,2,B001993Y2C,"Love the series, that's not the issue.  If you are considering the box set for purchase, you are probably already a fan of the show, so nevermind that.

I want to echo the comments here about the lame packaging.  After shelling out so much money for this collection, the customer should at least have some confidence that their purchase can be preserved in some way: not this hodgepodge of paper packaging that not only leaves your discs vulnerable, but actually accelerates wear and tear from their flimsy design.  The simple act of removing a disc from the package is a risky challenge.

But none of this compares to the shoddy compression of this entire set.  I work in this industry, and recognize that what people are complaining about in their reviews is not the ""realism"" of shaky cameras and grainy film stock, but rather the glitchy compression that poorly adapts for low-light, high-contrast scenes.  With the combination of shooting with fluorescents and smoke, what should have been highly tuned compression settings were apparently not even bothered with, perhaps opting for faster adaptive mechanisms.  Please note that even some vfx shots (actually many in the course of an episode) are muddy, noisy, and flicker.  The color grading on the entire series was rather unique, probably shooting under exposure for more creative options in post-production.  However, as wild as much of the grading is, you would have thought somebody in the post pipeline had notes on final compression.

Not all of it is bad--if it were, somebody on the distribution team may have noticed and corrected it.  However, the sloppiness is apparent enough that it contrasts starkly with the gorgeous images that were properly treated.

Very disappointing.  I don't know if they made fixes in other releases, but this Blu Ray collection is a slapdash treatment of an elegant product.",1315180800,4,1871,5.032467532467533

My wife wound up watching it with me too, so it cannot be that dorky, right, although she is shy to admit it to anyone - again I think because of the name.

After each episode I wanted to find out what was going to happen next. There are a lot of twists throughout the seasons.

The characters were really what made it for me, I loved some and loved to hate others. It was entertaining and different than the usual that is on TV right now.

After you watch this you should start saying ""Frak"" and ""So Say We All""",1314748800,,764,4.046357615894039
3431640,5,B001993Y2C,"I never watched the re-make of Battlestar Galactica when it aired. I watched the original 1978 series for a while until it got too silly and then gave up on it. Robot dogs, kids and everyone had names of the gods, it got too Lost in Space like for me.

BBC America started running the new Battlestar Galctica series and I had nothing better to do so I figured I would check it out. Within an hour of the two hour opener I was hooked. The characters were good, the acting was good, nice special effects and the gods name were just call signs. Anyway, after a couple of weeks watching on BBC America I decided I couldn't wait a week between episodes and purchased the series from Amazon on Blue-ray. Now I find it hard to limit myself to one episode a night as I work my way through the series.

The Blueray discs have all sorts of nice extra features, commentaries, video blogs, games and other internet related stuff I haven't figured out yet, but the series was shot to look like a documentary, so the video is a little grainy at times with wobbly cameras to give you the feeling you are there so don't look for exceptional video quality. Do look for good action, good writing and characters acting like real people. This is not a Star Trek like universe where it is 'All for one and one for all' type of mentality. The characters cheat, lie, go on strike, try to save their own rear ends at the expense of others, somtimes to the point that I miss the Star Trek type attitude.

Can't say enough about the actors. Everyone is good in their role. I like Mary McDonnell as the president. She has this smile when dealing with other characters that makes her look like she knows more than they do and no matter what she'll get her way, kinda like a real politicians attitude. I also like the kind of retro feel to the overall design of the series. The ships look  like they have been heavily used. Nothing is too high tech. The CGI cylons are great, no actor in a costume here. There are plot holes that sometimes make me think, what are they doing, but it is a TV show and they have to create drama somehow.

My major complaint about this disc set is they have extended versions of some of the episodes but they don't really alert you to this unless you read the back of each box. It is annoying to watch an episode and then find that the next one is the same one you just watched with 16 minutes of additional footage. The episodes to watch out for are,

Season Two-- Pegasus
Season Three-- Unfinished Business
Season Four-- Battlestar Galactica Razor

Just a note on the shipping quality from Amazon here. This is a big box set and Amazon ships it in a box twice the size of the set with packing material that doesn't cut it. There was shipping damage on both ends of the box. It was primarily cosmetic, but still, you are paying some bucks here.

3431654,5,B001993Y2C,"Recently, Battlestar Galactica has started to show on the cable channels.  Problem is it will take four to five years to ""relive"" the series, getting only one new episode a week.  You also have to sit through commercials, this is what happened previously, and this is what will be happening next week kind of things.  The quality of the picture is superior to what is being aired on TV, and though it still has a  brief ""previously on Battlestar Galactica"" and an intro with credits, it sure is nice to get full episodes, uncut, uninterrupted, and the ability to watch three or four in a row.  Excellently packaged, with a number of ""extras"" discs, I love it.

The only negative there is, is quite common among movie DVD's or collections.  There is an ""imbalance"" between the conversations of the characters and the background noises.  First time I ran into this, I thought something was wrong with my DVD or the TV, like the channels got switched.  The background noise drowns out the voices.  After some research, I found this is really common.  The studies boost the background for ""realism"" and theater-like effects.  If you have a home theater, boost the ""center"" channel to fix.  If you do not, you'll have to play with the TV and DVD settings to find something to rebalance the sound.  For me, I use remote, powered speakers running from the audio-out plug of the TV.

I'm hoping this may serve as a good reference for others like me. I came this close to returning the product because I could not find The Plan. Other than a sticker on the outside of the packaging that says (basically) Razor and The Plan are included, there is no other mention that I could see on the packaging with reference to The Plan. Razor has it's own jewel case and the slip case seemed to have a gap with just enough space for another disc. Naturally, I thought I had a bad package that was missing the final disc. Luckily, I searched these reviews and found a reference to The Plan that it is in Season 4.0, Disc 4. However, that jewel case label has no mention of The Plan.

However... I did open the case and lo and behold, there was my little gem neatly tucked away on the opposite side of Disc 4. Naturally, I was happy. I just wish there was some sort of obvious clue as to where this disc was.

3431659,5,B001993Y2C,"Hello,
I ordered the Silver Box Collection of the complete series on Blu-ray Disc on June 8th, and received it at my home on June 13th, 2011 (Free Super Saver Shipping). The Disc set was well packaged in the shipping container. I ordered my collection set during a ""Gold Box"" 1 day promotion from Amazon, so I got a fantastic price for the collection. Thanks Amazon for the heads up e-mail the day of the promotion. The ""product description"" and photo's at the Amazon web site/page matched 100% what was delivered to my home.

The ""Silver Box"" series does ""not"" include the Cylon action figure, nor does it come with a separate reference Disc sheet for each season. That info is printed on each season's discs' jackets'. I am currently reviewing each disc to be sure each one is OK.

My general impression with the ""Silver Box"" series is 5 stars. As for the packaging of the discs in their season by season jacket/cardboard container(s), it seems to me that I will need to find a different way to store these discs. The removal/return from the cardboard container and the opening/closing of the paper/plastic jacket that holds the discs, are not durable enough to stand up to a lot of use, even with care taken when doing such actions. For me this is ""not"" a deal breaker. I intend to purchase the 3 ring DVD Disc holder sheet-jackets that will go into a 3 ring binder notebook. I have done this with every TV series collection of DVDs that I own. I will cut out the ""Disc Description Sheet"" that is on the jacket of each season's set of discs, and mount it in the 3 ring notebook to index the collection of discs. I wrote this as a suggestion to an alternative way to store and maintain this collection. Otherwise, count on investing in individual Blu-ray Disc containers' for each Disc.

The only other comment I can add is to watch for another ""Gold Box"" deal of the day/week promo offered by Amazon with this set. It's an awesome price, and this was an awesome series--""So say we all"".",1307923200,,1989,4.519444444444445
3431660,5,B001993Y2C,"I was 15 years old when the original ""Battlestar Galactica"" had its one-season run in 1978. Even at that tender age, an age when my present criteria for what comprised good science fiction was not yet fully formed, I detested that show. I thought it was ludicrous, forced and cheesy. I think if I had been 8 years old at the time, I would have loved it, because it really was that simplistic.

So, when the remake started airing on the Sci-Fi Channel in 2003, I totally ignored it. I thought ""Why would anybody remake such cheesy 70's dreck? Does nobody have any original ideas anymore?"" and then totally forgot about the existence of the new show for years.

Fast forward to 2010, when I bought a Wi-Fi streaming Blu-ray player and started a Netflix account to go with it. In these days of lowest common denominator television replete with horrid reality shows, Netflix has been a great refuge. When I noticed that the entire BSG remake was available for streaming, I thought, ""OK, I'll watch the pilot miniseries, what's the harm?"" And three hours later, I realized that I had been missing out on some fabulous sci-fi. I subsequently watched every episode on Netflix, and caught the ""webisodes"" on Youtube. I've had this box set in my wish list for a while now, hoping the price would drop to a point where I could justify purchasing it. Then one day a week ago or so, Amazon listed it as their ""Deal of the Day"" at a hugely discounted price. I snapped it right up, and now have it as a centerpiece of my video collection.

The show itself is a masterpiece of televised science fiction. As a small child, my idea of good sci-fi was pretty much ""the more spaceships and aliens, the better."" As an adult, my preference is that science fiction concentrate on strong character development and good storylines. BSG is the first sci-fi series I have seen in a long time that passes my litmus test of ""Take the sci-fi elements out of the story and replace them with equivalent non sci-fi counterparts. Does the series/movie still succeed on its own merits""? If you don't get what I mean here, think of the movie ""Avatar"". Take out all the wild effects and sci-fi elements, replace the Na'vi with regular Native Americans, but keep the plot and script as much the same as possible otherwise. What you end up with is a standard-issue, mediocre cowboys vs. Indians flick. Strip away the sci-fi glittering prettiness, and ""Avatar"" is absolutely nothing special. As I applied that litmus test to BSG, I realized that this show easily stood on its own as quality television. That's because the show is all about people.

Character development was very important to Ronald Moore and the other people behind this series. There's a large cast here, and care is taken to flesh out all the various characters. The main characters - the Adamas, Col. Tigh, Starbuck, et. al. - were perfectly realized as deeply complex, deeply conflicted people who were portrayed as flawed human beings under the hottest of fires. It was a brilliant decision to make the main Cylon antagonists biological machines - it was a great way to force the viewer to look at the universe from their perspective and gave the Cylons some much-needed multi-dimensionality that was sorely missing from the original series.

In this remake, you'll see all that makes humans human - nobility and bravery mixed with pettiness and cowardice, politics, many parallels with our current ""war on terror"" (complete with suicide bombings from unexpected sources), political strife, religious conflict, the abortion debate, the often uneasy alliance between civilian governments and the military, and on and on. The people behind the show do not take the easy way out and blindly  portray the humans solely as the good guys and the Cylons as the one-dimensional bad guys. As in real life, the good guys are not all good and the bad guys are not all bad. BSG does a great job at providing a frank and honest perspective of both sides. The series has a dark, technologically primitive (for sc-fi) and grungy look to it that is a refreshing change from the hi-tech sterile, bright and shiny feel that most sci-fi has these days. The cinematography nicely enhances the mood of desperation and despair that goes along with trying to save the human race from total extinction.

About the only thing I was mildly disappointed with was the grand finale to the series. It wrapped the show up more or less neatly, and the ending made sense, but it was uninvolving to me. Apparently, it is very difficult to make finales that are on par with the overall series, as my experiences with the finales of other shows such as ""Cheers"", ""Seinfeld"", ""Star Trek: Voyager"", and others have shown me. However, overall, my tepid reaction to the finale is a relatively minor nitpick compared to the overall brilliance of the series.

As I got deeper into the series I found myself scouring the internet for reviews by reputable sources. I found plenty. Even publications like the New York Times, Time magazine and Newsday raved about it. Time magazine even called BSG the best show on television in 2005, and I can see why.

As far as the physical box set itself goes, it is packaged well. In the main box are sub-boxes for the individual seasons. Each disc comes in a slimline plastic case for adequate protection. The set includes the made-for-TV BSG movies ""Razor"" and ""The Plan"" in appropriate chronological order, and indeed contains everything but the ""Face of the Enemy"" webisodes (Maybe I missed seeing them, let me know if I did and I will update my review). One thing I recommend to anyone who buys this set: when you get it, immediately check to see that the correct discs are in the set. I have seen reviews here where people have received sets that include two Season 3's and no Season 4, and also some who have noticed individual discs missing and/or duplicated within seasons. I was lucky enough to have everything correct in my box set, but I'm glad I checked.

This is the rare science fiction series that you don't have to be a fan of sci-fi to enjoy. No television series is perfect, and BSG has its share of uneven and inconsistent moments, but I really can't recommend this brilliant show enough.",1307836800,11,6235,4.717171717171717

If you watch only one episode at a time, every time you start an episode, you are accosted with the ""I'm Micheal D. Moore"" intro.  I could see this once per season or even once per disc, but it gets old with every single episode.

BSG is a series that starts off brilliantly, maintains a decent pace, and offers a satisfactory conclusion that works with the entire body of work, which is not an easy thing to do.

There are the occassional plot holes but truthfully, it is impossible to do a project on the scale that BSG plays on without an occassional plot hole coming up.  However, the plotholes aren't glaringly bad.

Towards Season 4 and 4.5 the writers go to the well one too many times with a few of the plotlines and actions, but not to the point where you want to stop watching.

Overall, this represents a definitive work of Television Sci-Fi and is a must have for anyone who is a fan of Sci-Fi.

Also, it should be noted that BSG will appeal to many who aren't fans of Sci-Fi since the majority of the storylines and plotlines are character centric.

The ending is a little anti-climatic but it works and is satisfying.

Good job guys, well done.  Writers, directors, actors, and fx guys should be proud of what they accomplished.  Well done...

3431677,5,B001993Y2C,"This review is specifically for the new packaging of the series on DVD, not the show itself. (That's already reviewed enough.)

I had been watching the complete series prices because it was too expensive for me, so was figuring I'd need to wait another year or two to buy the set. I happened to check one day when it was on sale for only slightly more than a hundred bucks, so decided to go for it. But I was a bit hesitant because of all the complaints about the cardboard disc holders. (I've experienced scratching problems with other shows in cardboard slots.)

I was delighted to find that they are now packaging the series in plastic cases! So here's how the set is presented and what's included:

A very sturdy cardboard case holds the entire set. Each of the four seasons are separated into their own lighter cardboard slip cases. Each season case holds plastic slim cases in which each disc is stored.

Season One:
* 5 discs
* Includes the original mini-series on the first disc

Season Two (Includes season 2.0 and 2.5):
* 6 discs
* Includes both the aired and extended versions of the Pegasus episode. (Note that the extended version is on the first disc of season 2.5.)

Season Three:
* 6 discs
* Includes aired and extended versions of Unfinished Business episode

Season Four (includes 4.0 and 4.5):
* 8 discs
* The Razor TV movie is on disc one
* The case for 4.0 disc 4 also includes a disc for the TV movie The Plan. (You can decide to watch it then or save it for after you're done with the regular series episodes.)
* Includes aired and extended versions for A Disquiet Follows My Soul and Islanded in the Stream of Stars
* The last disc has the aired versions of the three part finale (Daybreak) and also includes an extended version of the three as a single episode you can watch like a movie.

There are bonus features scattered throughout the discs, so check that menu item on each disc (or the back of the slim case) to see what is available. Even if you're normally not into DVD extras, you gotta watch What the Frak is Going on With Battlestar Galactica on season 4.5 disc 1. It's the most hilarious series recap I've ever seen.

The set does not include a separate episode list, you just get the info listed on the back of each slim case.

If you're like me and choose each episode individually to watch as you go along, pay close attention to which discs contain the extended episodes if you want to watch those versions. On some case listings they're included in the main episode list on the back, in some they're only listed down in the bonus features section. I didn't notice that change in the season four discs so missed seeing there were extended eps so only watched the aired versions.

This new packaging of the complete series gets a big thumbs up from me. Though I'd rate it as 4.5 stars, the half star taken off for not including a complete episode and TV movie list booklet.",1302134400,7,2913,4.436329588014981

The Box is decent if not wide for shelf space, but the 20 discs are organized into Seasons that are individually packaged within their own ""binders"" and packaging.

Each Season features a Episode Guide that is specific per disc number.

I grew up watching the original series. Yes the ""disco"" one. So I was a bit miffed when I saw the new version at varying times, on the SciFi/SyFy channel, and almost always seeming to turn it on during a Skinimax/soft porn scene. (THIS IS A MAJOR REASON why I couldn't give the Series a 5-star rating- some of us do care about content and other alternatives to portray love-making and the like artistically do exist.) Thus I did not regularly partake of the Series while it originally aired on TV. So for me this is mainly new territory in the long run.

My other gripe is due to the religious over- and under-tones that seem to permeate the story arc of the Series.

Had it not been for the above, and mostly the sexual scenes, this would be a TREMENDOUS offering to anyone's sci-fi catalog.

Make no mistake the Story Telling, the re-hashing of a childhood favorite, is BRILLIANT !!! I am taken aback by the profound intellect and thought that has gone into such a vivid tale. The religious over- and under-tones do serve a purpose but there are moments when I do feel a bit offended as the dialog skirts the edge of blasphemy or sacrilege. However I get it: the gods vs. The God and the elements which make ""us Human"" are clearly what is displayed here.

If you are a Family person, as I am, I warn that this is NOT for ""the children,"" perhaps teens and the such, but young ones DO NOT need to be bombarded with so much sexual content.

For us older, mature folk, this is a massive ride that will reward one with sparks for conversation and thought.",1301443200,,1936,4.540229885057471

3431683,1,B001993Y2C,"Let me start off by saying the show is 5 stars, the review is for the packaging. I can't say enough good things about the writing, the cast or the gritty realism of the show (especially as a long-time pan-geek from an early age). Unfortunately, content is only pleasant if it's viewable.

It's been said before, the big Cylon head version is terrible. The discs slide around in the cardboard sleeves and arrive damaged. That's old news at this point. New information is that Universal has decided (as of May 31, 2010) to stop replacing their defective packaging. Without recalling their shoddy workmanship, which is a nice touch.

They will replace damaged discs if you get them the disc number and chapter and timecode when it skipped. So be prepared to watch the whole series in 30 days to make sure it works at all. Universal, of course will replace the defective discs in 2-4 weeks, so they're not nearly as rigid about their own timelines as they are about the customer's. :) I haven't yet, but take my advice, buy the new version. It can't be any worse. It's not defective, and you won't have to deal with Universal's questionable customer service practices (unless something goes wrong-in which case best of luck).",1300492800,7,1221,4.727699530516432

3431685,3,B001993Y2C,"I bought all the series before seeing any of it earlier. The first and second seasons beats any previous Sci fi TV serie I have ever watched. Talking about Star treks; however starting the middle of the third season and up to the end of the fourth, the writers of the script were somehow lacking the right ideas and it became a mess.
Glad I watched it however ""Star Trek Enterprise"" beats it by far.",1300147200,,399,4.333333333333333
3431686,5,B001993Y2C,"This box set contains the core of the new BSG:

The mini series pilot episodes, all four seasons, Razor & The Plan.

There are some extended episodes and extras as well, such as context specific extended information.

Menu navigation and configuration options are presented in a very clean, highly usable interface.

Amazon fulfilled this order quickly and efficiently- priority international shipping meant I received this in Australia in four days. Outstanding.",1299456000,,463,5.47887323943662
3431687,5,B001993Y2C,"THIS is the one to purchase.  I did enough sleuthing, but was nervous about whether I had purchased the box with the ""cardboard"" inserts over the dvds or the set with the plastic cases for each dvd.  THIS is the right one!!  Am hooked on BSG and am enjoying the quality of this product.  Now have parts of my family hooked on it too!!  hahaha",1299456000,2,342,4.2
3431688,5,B001993Y2C,"Ok, so the show isn't perfect.  In fact, it stumbles quite a bit during season 4 and it was obvious things needed to be wrapped up before things got too out of control story-wise.

Amazon needs to have what is included in this set on its main page.  You get:
Season 1
Seasons 2 & 2.5
Season 3 + The Resistance Webisodes (10 webisodes chronicling events before Season 3 started totaling 27 min)
Seasons 4 & 4.5
Extended Versions of Razor and The Plan
Hours of bonus featurettes

It would also help to note there are a number of episodes scattered throughout that are extended and were never aired on TV, some by quite a few minutes:
Season 2: Pegasus (not listed how many mins extra)
Season 3: Unfinished Business: The Ronald Moore Version (25 minutes of additional footage - the boxing match episode)
  As mentioned before - 10 Webisodes
Season 4: Razor (16 minutes of additional footage)
  A Disquiet Follows My Soul (8 minutes of additional footage)
  Islanded In A Stream Of Stars (19 minutes of additional footage)
  Daybreak (15 minutes of additional footage.  The Daybreak episode presented here is Daybreak Pts. 1, 2 & 3 combined into one long 2.5 hrs episode)

As for packaging, this set is handled well.  The individual seasons are packaged in glossy cases that you can take out and stand separately or you can just put the big box on your shelf.  Easy to bend the corners of the individual season boxes, but if you're like me and handle with extreme care, there shouldn't be any problems.  All in all, it's a beautiful package, and when taken into account every episode/webisode/extended version/movie/bonus feature that is included, this is the perfect set for true fans.  The bottom of the box says it all: Approx. 69 hrs 31 mins.  Of pure awesomeness.",1299369600,10,1764,4.687296416938111

Anyway that being said, great series, good action, great drama, it's not a 5 but damn close.  Acting was very good, plot was kind of the same line as the original series, but they tweaked it a lot with the cyclons it wasn't just about the humans.

discussing:

-torture
-suicide bombing
-do we have any particular right to survival?
-what does god or the god(s) think of us?

Even at the current price, the complete series on Blu-Ray is an excellent deal.  The picture during these early seasons that I've watched so far has generally been fantastic, although there have been some cases in brightly lit seasons where there is a lot of visual noise in the background.  However, these have been few.

There are very few cases when I will by a television series like this.  This collection is one worth owning and one that I look forward to experiencing again and again over the years.",1294704000,,723,4.645669291338582

3431713,5,B001993Y2C,"Grabbed this on Blue Ray in anticipation of the visuals looking more amazing than when they blew me away on broadcast TV & DVD (bought the miniseries on DVD long ago).  I am not disappointed.

Look, this show probably has a million lengthy reviews here where regular folks, hard sci fi fans, and uber-nerds of various stripes have gone on and on about how incredible this series is.  Count me in, but here's the quick version:

The rebooted Battlestar Galactica is at once extremely careful to honor the spirit of the original and yet absolutely unafraid to take true risks.  Switching characters' sexes, adding layers of psychological intrigue (that are arguably not truly original but are still extremely well-executed), changing or updating designs for ships and costumes, and wrapping the show up neatly enough at the end of a run that turned on a dime and on its ear more than once--all of this works amazingly well.  The risks pay off, and the true fans of the old show will see the send-ups and nods to the original everywhere they look.  But the cheese factor the old show is often accused of harboring is absolutely gone, and everything is played straight and dead serious.  The show is undeniably hard sci fi but yet remains completely accessible to people who just like intense story.

I haven't wanted to keep hitting play simply because I didn't want to get off the adrenaline rush a show offers since I sat down and watched 24 for the first time (which was actually on DVD--what a ride!).

If you haven't watched this show through before, man, do I envy you.  You are in for quite a wild ride.",1293840000,,1607,4.6431095406360425
3431714,1,B001993Y2C,"I love the scifi genre and was looking forward to watching this series.  It is very well produced and looks good, but that doesn't overcome the horrible acting or the incomprehensibly bad writing.  If a show decides to take itself seriously (as this one clearly does), then there needs to be a high level of consistency within the story as well as coherent story lines that maintain the integrity of the story line.  The story is chock full of holes, the acting and writing is campy and I find my self saying ""who writes this crap"" regularly during each episode.  The story lines force most every character to be ignorant, foolish, or both (because none of the plot-advancing devices would work if the characters were not idiots) and treats the viewer as if they are 12 years old and have no grasp on human behavior or character.  Perhaps that was the target age group.  Few, if any, of the characters behave in a consistent fashion with their role or are consistent from episode to episode.  The story fails in just about every way possible.  It isn't riveting, there is almost no action, those in the military don't behave as if they've spend more than a day in training, petty infighting and lame superstition-based narratives replace what should be the focus of the stories (struggle for survival related to direct and indirect effects of their mortal enemy).  The Character of Gaius Baltar may very well be the worst written, acted, and actualized character in the history of television.  Rather than focus on any of the endless possibilities at the disposal of a scifi show, the story focuses on petty politics and shallow, inconsistent characters.  The flaws in the story lines are too numerous to list and rife throughout every single episode to the point of distraction....assassins shoot their targets in the stomach, stomach wounds are referred to as chest wounds, and apparently the spleen is located in the chest...if just goes on and on.  Just a horrible show.",1293840000,12,1974,4.824925816023739

It includes the asides, Razor and The Resistance (Unfortunately, due to the writer's strike of '08, the Face of the Enemy webisodes are not on the DVD, and most likely never will be.)
And, I don't know if the set has been updated since most of these reviews were written or not, but the set I received INCLUDES ""The Plan"" direct to DVD movie. Inside of the boxed set, it's in the case with Season 4.0 Disc 4. I was putting in Disc 4 of Season 4.0, looked over and HEY! There's ""The Plan"" next to it! Certainly a nice surprise, in addition to a brilliant series.",1293494400,,680,4.27906976744186
3431718,4,B001993Y2C,"I'll keep this short and to the point. This set includes the the pilot miniseries, all four regular television seasons, the long version of Razor, The Plan, and most of the webisodes. It is missing the ""Face of the Enemy"" webisodes. That's the only missing story material I've (not) found so far, and I really had to look, because the slimline case inserts don't have complete catalogs of the disc contents, and the box descriptions aren't entirely trustworthy (one promises an extended edition of ""Islanded in a Stream of Sars [sic]."" Perhaps this is a followup to The Woman King in which the Sagittarons get yet another respiratory disease). The Plan was unfortunately packed in Season 4.0, Disc 4's case, with no notice of this on the packaging at all. It will, of course, spoil you terribly if you watch it at this point in the series. This is what I suggest:

Acquire the ""Face of the Enemy"" episodes through whatever means available to you. (I am sending my duplicate to seduce Ronald D. Moore and access the NBC Universal video mainframe.) Once you have done this, burn them to a disc, and do some disc-shuffling. Put Season 4.0 Disc 4 in a case by itself, and use the double case to pair your new Face of the Enemy disc with Season 4.5 Disc 1 or 2 (it takes place between these discs). Put The Plan in its own slimline case and stick that in the big box after Season 4. There's just enough room to do this; in fact, it's pretty obvious that's what the manufacturers intended before they rushed their product out the door. You can probably find a fan-produced insert to make this case match the others, or make your own if you're feeling creative. Then you will have a complete, if partly fan produced, edition of Battlestar Galactica.

Bonus material junkies will find a wealth of commentaries, podcasts, deleted scenes, promotional material, and retrospective material. I have only seen the smallest fraction of these features, but they were pretty enjoyable as far as these things go. The bonus materials produced for the miniseries are not included; you must purchase the miniseries separately if you wish to see these.

The series gets an A. The DVD set production gets a B for incomplete disc descriptions on the case inserts, missing material, and a spoilerific epilogue movie inserted in the middle of the final season. If this were a lesser series I wouldn't mind so much, but when you're so close to perfection every blemish stands out in stark relief.",1293321600,6,2469,4.710648148148148

I wish I had waited for a less expensive box set to come out. This one was kind of cheesy and disappointing. The boxes containing the actual discs seem designed to scratch them, and I felt the need to be very careful extracting them. Also, a 'collector's edition' type of box set should be something you want to display, but I put this one on the back of the shelf behind other discs.

These are the first Bluray DVDs we've bought and I was surprised that the whole set was so small--I expected to have to clear a huge space on our shelf for this. The packing looks fantastic, and the plastic inserts for the DVDs have a small lip on them to hold them in, which I like--the plastic center on my Office DVDs have broken over the years, and the disks fall out constantly (hello scratches!). The deleted scenes are great (and pretty helpful at times, too); loved the extended versions of episodes. We haven't played around much with the other features (again, these are our first Blurays) because we are just eager to watch the series right now, but we definitely plan to on our next run through.

My wife does not like sci-fi. She passed on the mini series but sat down with me half way through part two of the mini series and was hooked. We loved the series when it aired and could not wait for Saturday nights!
The Blu-ray looks awesome. The sound is incredible in DTS-HD Master! This new packaging (which I waited for) is better than the original release and fits inline with the rest of your movie collection.

I am running a brand new panasonic blueray bd 605 and a 32inch lcd sylvania 720P tv(with great sound that sounded same as my stereo), with an older stereo system, and on the last part of the miniseries at Radnar Anchorage, the cylons are saying it may take decades to get the rest of the humans, then the Asian woman in colonial uniform(for you rooks out there to follow), she walks up and says it won't be so hard or something like that, and a NUMBER SIX EXCLAIMS ""BY...COMMAND"", and I did not hear the ""By YOUR Command"" like I know I did, when it was replayed on television the multitudes I rewatched it, or that is what I believe to be true to how I remember it, the way it was said by the cylons in the 1970's original series by the cylons to their centurion leaders of ""By Your Cammand"", its like they muted the ""YOUR"" part, the sounds just hits a temporary sinkhole.  It just sounds like By Command, only, I know it sounds like a little thing, it aint my equipment, maybe that catch phrase is copywrited intellectual property of the producers of the original show in the 70's, and they couldn't use it on blue rays and dvds after there was a court fight, I dunno.  This is all I've watched of the blue ray edition so far, it doesn't detract much from everything else, and I just hope I don't have a defective copy somehow, but I doubt it, the rest of the sound is spotless, so in my opinion it must be the way it is.
Later on, I will likely upgrade to a higher star rating if I am set straight, that I could somehow be wrong, it was always like this maybe, etc etc, but the only other detraction is that the blue ray package was well packed in a larger box but it still seemed to receive some sort of banging around with some dog eared edges an minor crumpled corners, I notice that alot about some of the movies sets I receive, and I am beginning to think my state or local postol folks are responsible for rough treatment in my area only, but I have the wierdest bad luck on stuff that is supposed to look like it rolled off the line last week or last month but looks like it was sitting on a shelf somewhere and knocked around.  And no, I don't send back stuff for minor things like that, considering I give alot of my favorites plenty of shelving and reshelving wear in the first couple of months I get my new ""toys"", errr, movies and shows anyway.
Great stuff, really, transfers are great, there are grany scenes that were shot that way intentionally, the introduction by whats his name said that all BSG was shot using high definition equipment to film from the start.  You will not be disappointed, I was lucky to get this for 60% off on a lucky one day sale recently, glad I went with the blue ray instead of 60% off on regualr dvd that day, though I am a blue ray newbie, only my favorite movies and shows when applicable to blue ray will be bought on blue ray.

3431728,2,B001993Y2C,"Well I waded through all 6 seasons (2.5 + 4.5 make six), and if they cut out all the sex you would have to remove an entire season.

The show is composed of episodes that move the plot forward and are very good, and episodes that I call ""soap opera"" episodes that go and don't contribute anything.  If you also took out all of the soap opera episodes, you would have only have one season left.

The exodus from New Caprica (season 2.5 I think) was fantastic...probably the best episode of the series.

The end of the last season (4.5) was a huge disappointment.  Some of the questions they left unanswered which is fine, but the questions they did answer, which they had been building towards the entire show, where such a huge disappointment, one being the opera house and the dream of Rosalyn, Caprica 6 and Athena.  The other was Starbuck, somehow she was the Harbinger of Death, and the end-result of the song she heard/felt as a child was disappointing.

It seemed the entire point of the show was to make it as morally grey as possible.  All of the characters were extremely inconsistent.  For instance the President has a citizen tortured, and then afterwards says to the effect ""of course we're going to give him a fair trial.""  It was then I realized that this show was written during G.W. Bush's first term in office and the president apparently mirrors him and Admiral Adama mirrors Rumsfeld who answers valid press questions with ""I don't answer hypotheticals.""  The exception is that the show tries unsuccessfully to make them seem like good people at heart instead of the evil conspirators bent on implementing a New World Order.  The show takes good characters and has them make incredibly bad decisions and bad people and try to make them seem good, the characters are extremely inconsistent.  An oft heard line in the first couple of seasons was ""That's a line I can't cross.""  Well, those lines they refused to cross were always moving.

The one exception was HELO, but he was such a bad actor (or shallow character) that you don't really care about him.

The show tried hard to be more like our current society, abandoning the laser guns for 9mm rounds.  Freedom was a privilege instead of a right.  They sword an oath to defend the Articles of Colonization (Constitution), but defacto Marital Law was in effect.  If you produced and didn't exercise your right to speak freely in a way the president or Admiral didn't like then you were ""free"".  Otherwise you risked being boarded and shot by the military.  One example was the Tillium ship.  They pretended to allow them freedom, however once the ship decided to leave the fleet the sent the marines after them and commandeered the ship.  If they wanted to take the morally conscionable path, and since this ship was so critical to the rest of the fleet, they should have exercised eminent domain and given them a fair market value for what the fleet ""public"" needed.  What exacerbated this was the military was not directed by civilians.  Often you would hear Adama take random questions and declare ""It's a military decision.""

Another example the grey-and-freedom issue was the mutiny/rebellion of Gaeta and Zarek.  What started out as a legitimate right of the people to rebel and assert their natural rights as human beings when their freedom was being trampled on by the arbitrary decisions of tyrants turned very sour.  Both Gaeta and Zarek tainted what they did with poor choices.  The show glorified Adama as this god-like figure who all good people hallowed as The Old Man.

The military in general was glorified as it is in our day.  One member snuck into the military, did a great job, and when her history was found out, Starbuck excoriated her for trying to steal her way into the company of ""good people.""  My wife and laughed out loud, and for a long time this was a funny joke between us.  These ""good people"" were portrayed on-screen as the dregs of humanity.  Yes they defended the fleet against the Cylons, but as Adama queried in the first season: ""Is what we're fighting for worth saving?""  You could ask the same of our society while we pretend to fight for ""freedom"".

The question of religion is always there, and they never completely answer the question as to whether it is real in this fictional world or not, but it is clear that the writers are atheistic.  They portray religion as something vain people spout to gain a following, and of course some are ""duped"" and believe they are really following ""God's Plan.""

They used the word ""frack"" all of the time instead of the real f-word.  At first it was comical, until they used it so much and just like usage of the real f-word that it became disgusting itself.

In the end I watched every episode to find out what the answers to the questions were, and I was disappointed.",1291593600,4,4823,4.6548463356974
3431729,5,B001993Y2C,"When they say the ""Complete Series"", they mean complete.  You get the mini-series, seasons 1-4, the unrated extended version of Razor, and The Plan.  The Blu-Ray transfer is quite good.  Certain scenes still have some grit in the background but not many.  When you see simulated film grain, it's what RDM wants you to see.  Otherwise the Blu-Ray set has some excellent video detail.  When the Colonials land on Kobol, you can see the forest in verdant detail (the greens are so vibrant, it's like you can count the leaves on the trees).

The Blu-Ray extras include deleted scenes and bonus episodes like the extended version of ""Pegasus"".  But the real jewel is the retcon broadcast version of the series.  BSG is edgy.  It draws you in with dynamic characters that grow evolve over the course of the series.  The good guys aren't always good, and the bad guys aren't always bad.  Rather, the characters constantly drift into the gray zone of ethics and morality.  Sometimes they cross the line, and sometimes they hold to their ideals.  It's a roller coaster ride throughout the entire series.  The viewer's sympathies are tugged back and forth.  You like this character; you hate this character.  Then you like him again.  There's action.  There's intrigue.  There's a philosophical meditation on the nature of human condition.  In short, there's something for everyone.  There is a richness and depth for sci-fi fans and non-fans alike.",1291507200,2,1439,4.933054393305439
3431730,5,B001993Y2C,"Ok, so some people have written about the bad quality of the blu-ray DVDs on here but I have to disagree with that. The grainy/scratchy visual shots really make you feel what the characters feel - they are dirty, tired, and full of despair, and that comes through so well in HD!

The audio of this set was amazing. I've watched the finale probably a million times at this point and every single time the combination of beautiful pictures on screen, especially the fly-over shots over grasslands at the end, with the haunting",1291507200,4,970,5.830985915492958
3431731,5,B001993Y2C,"My wife and I are long time Battlestar G fans and had much of the series on DVD. But when Blu-ray came out, we yearned for the better sound and picture offered by that format. Recently we found the entire set on serious sale and pulled the trigger. The upgrade is substantial! The series still rocks with great writing, plot and acting, but you probably already knew that. What is amazing and fascinating is the insight that the higher fidelity video gives to the photography and directing choices.

Many scenes in the series are either shot in a lower resolution or are manipulated to look as if they were. You could kind of see that with the dvd, but the blu-ray lays these directing decisions bare and makes them more dramatic. They influence the feel of the series, and the mood is enhanced by the greater contrast between the straight and manipulated scenes. The blu-ray makes it more so, because the changes are more evident.

OK, a few of the special effects are easier to spot on Blu-ray, but that is always the case and it does not reduce the joy and intensity of this work. If you love the series, you need to get the Blu-ray set. If you love sci-fi and are not familiar with the series, this is the way to go.",1291420800,,1220,4.417777777777777
3431732,5,B001993Y2C,"This was worth every single penny of the $120.00 I paid for it. Superb sound quality, best picture you can get for the series, OMG sound quality, and the packaging is fine. I got the silver box version and although it's not made out of bullet-proof plastic, like some reviewers seem to expect, I'm sure it will endure with no problems. Couple of less-than-positive points however:
1. When I received it, there were some minor dents in the packaging most likely occurred during shipping [thanks alot UPS]
2. In the blu-ray cases, the presentation looks fashionable but I'd much preferred if they kept each disc in its own separate sleeve instead of mounting it on top of each other; minor inconvenience however.
3. I understand they intentionally made the picture grainy as an effect, but sometimes I get the feeling like I'm watching an upscaled DVD, but then the next scene will come on super detailed and then I'm like ""oh yeah, bluray..."". At the very least you'll have the full comfort of knowing that you'll have the best damn looking grainy effect in 1080p.

If you haven't seen this show yet, get this. If you've already seen this show, get this. If you already have the DVD, sell those and get this. Unless you're the type that only likes westerns/oldies and despises anything with CG or w/ SFX or Scifi-related, this will probably be one of the best shows you've ever seen, if not the best.

Bottom line, I highly recommend it and think $120-150 is a good price range for it. It's like what..$5.70 per disc? For those patiently waiting for the price to drop lower, best of luck :D I'll just be over here watching some BSG RIGHT NOW hehe.",1291161600,,1646,4.614334470989761
3431733,5,B001993Y2C,"I admit I also liked the 70s version, so perhaps I'm not the best judge of quality SciFi.  This four-year journey reinvented the idea with just the right mix of humor, mystery, action, drama, and detail.  Sure, the second and third seasons bog down in soap-opera storylines once in a while, but overall, this bunch of hard-drinking, hard-fighting, hard-living, desperate, heroic, and tragically flawed humans (and cylons) are so engaging that you enjoy the ride.

The premise is well laid-out, the characters are well developed over time.  The music is stunningly appropriate, the effects are never overdone, the acting is a little over-the-top sometimes, but never descends into drivel.

Sometimes this show is so raw, it hurts to watch.  The agony, desperation, despair, and betrayal are sometimes so well portrayed that it just wrenches the viewer's viscera.  But ultimately the conclusion pays off.  And does so in a way that's far more satisfying than virtually all of the other space opera that gets produced.

Most peoples first knee-jerk reaction to sci-fi dramas is ""nerd alert!"" but this show was more of a human drama centered in space.  The special effects are great, but they weren't the show.

Personally, I never had the chance to follow the series on TV, so when this pack came out, I just had to buy it. I watched the complete series in less than a month and I can recommend this to every fan of sci-fi. Wait a minute, if you are not into sci-fi, it's ok, I'm pretty sure you will love BSG anyway. It has political intrigues, a lot of action and fighting, lawyers drama, medical drama, moral ambiguities, religious fanaticism, philosophical contrasts and a strong background storytelling.

Everyone else really covered the series. I loved every minute of it, though I could do without the useless throwing about of the word ""Fr*k"" and the gratuitous sex.

The bottom line is that the show was a masterpiece. I bought the Blu-Ray boxed set (no Cylon figure) and was VERY disappointed at the grain in every episode. I thought there was a problem with the Blu-Ray set and was going to send it back as defective.

When you buy Blu-Ray, you expect images that are smooth as glass...

Well, don't expect that here.  When you watch this, you will wonder why it's such  poor quality.  As it turns out, the producers actually shot the show with intentional grain to give the show a ""gritty feel.""

I was not pleased.  For that, you can watch the show on DVD and get essentially the same quality.  In our day and age, who in their right mind ADDS GRAIN when the public is screaming for Hi-def??? Stupid.

So, if you think film grain will drive you mad, DON'T buy the Blu-ray set...just stick with the DVDs.

Discs are held securely in plastic trays within.  I'm very pleased overall.",1286409600,,367,4.417910447761194
3431752,2,B001993Y2C,"It's a show with some very interesting concepts but it's too far fetched.  Basically we created the Cylons to be our robotic servants and finally they rose up against us and left Caprica.  So 40 years later Cylons have developed Cylon models that look human in order to infiltrate the human race and destroy Caprica and all living humans.

The idea to destroy the human race was to assure the Cylons that humans would never enslave them again...but obviously that would never ever be possible because the Cylons are so much stronger and so far technically advanced that the human race would never be able to catch up.  So it starts off on a ridiculous idea.

Then you have Captain Adama (which is my favorite character) in charge of an old falling apart battleship with the responsibility of finding the last remaining humans a place to resettle and rebuild their lives...which is of course the planet Earth.  The story of their journey is so unbelievable that it takes away from the series.  And the most annoying character of all is Kara Thrace...an alcoholic pilot fighter that defies everyone and everything but of course she has a special relationship with Captain Adama as she was engaged to his son before he passed away so she basically gets away with anything.

Something that could have really given this show interest and a more believable story line would be if the humans encountered other aliens along the way to have joined forces with.  It's hard for me to fathom that Cylons and humans are the only living beings in the universe and that in their long journey they did not encounter any other life forms.

Also the ending of this show was a disappointment too.  When they finally reach their destination they all branch out into different groups and some even go all alone.  Their chances for survival would be very minimal...again it doesn't make much sense.

If you like sci-fi it's watchable...just wait for the price to come down to like $75.00-$100.00.  And the packaging is terrible...the discs are very difficult to get out and back in.  The box is also big and bulky...",1286323200,2,2094,4.745856353591161

3431764,5,B001993Y2C,"Simply the finest science fiction I have ever had the pleasure of watching. I grew up in the early 80s eagerly watching reruns of the original Battlestar Galactica. I feasted on Buck Rogers, ST TOS, ST TNG, I remember the miniseries 'Something is Out There' and even Moonbase Alpha. So, I am an unapologetic, huge sci-fi nerd who fiercely believed that no show could ever do equal to or better than 'Babylon 5'.

Battlestar Galactica consists of the four-hour pilot miniseries and then four seasons followed by 'The Plan' (not included in the DVD collection). I highly recommend watching it at least in HD if you can. We watched if the first time through on an old-fashioned tube TV and are now watching the entire series again--in HD. It really is a whole new show--visually--if you watch it in HD. While Bear MacCreary's enchanting soundtrack is worth listening to all by itself.

Let's get right to the ***Spoiler Alert***

As a fan of the original BSG, I had certain standards that needed to be met. Two of my favorite things was the actual structure of the Galactica and it's commander, Lorne Greene's Adama. So, the new BSG right away had a hard act to follow, and I knew I would be uncomfortable seeing a different ship or Adama.

They could not have done better than Edward James Olmos as Bill Adama, who, hands down, remains my favorite character of the series. You got to love those sad droop-dog eyes of his that he gives everybody. His face is just legend.

Then you get some of the old characters revisited, Starbuck, Apollo, Tigh, Baltar, Boomer, and a whole new set too including, Billy, Helo, Dualla, Gaeta, Leoben, Cavil, Sam, Doc Cottle, etc. Maybe I am just easily impressed but--I thought everybody's acting was amazing throughout most of the series. It's hard to think of a character I could have done without. Everyone who gets screen time is game-on and convincing.

My spouse and I watched this straight through over the course of about two weeks--and almost needed some therapy for mild PTSD. Reality never lets up for the crew of the Galactica, starting with the first post-miniseries episode, '33', with the Cylons jumping after the ragtag fleet every thirty-three minutes. Knuckle-biting. The stress hits everyone--even the viewer.

One of the things that I love so much about Babylon 5 is that the cast is flawed. There are no Mary-Sues in Babylon 5. Subjects like rebelling against the State, addiction, family loss and prostitution were broached and played with a little. It was a very refreshing change of pace from the good, clean-cut characters of Star Trek.

BSG takes that to an entirely different level. Like in real life, everyone in BSG has a problem. They may be gifted, talented, attractive or successful, but they are -all- flawed. From the Admiral and the President on down to the lowliest knuckle-dragger.

Issues tackled in this show include but are not limited to:

Alternative medicine. Kamala extract fills in for medical marijuana and is useful for treating pain.
Addictions to or recreational use of an assortment of substances including stims, booze and tobacco.
Homicide for varying reasons.
War crimes tribunals.
Labor unions and workers rights.
Maintaining government and freedom in times of extreme crisis.
Birth control and access.
Love, lust and recreational sex.
Marriage and divorce.
Right to refuse medical treatment.
Guerrilla insurgency, sabotage and patriotism.
Blatant military recruitment and government propaganda.
Peace movements and civil disobedience.
Depression, suicide, psychosis and other mental illness.
Religion--at least two different religions are presented in this show, along with agnosticism and atheism.

--All handled amazingly well in my opinion. I wanted to serve on the Galactica before the miniseries was over.

Other thoughts. Doc Cottle is the coolest doctor in science fiction--ever. Show includes some amazing father-son tension between not-so-goody two shoes Apollo and his old man. The chemistry between Roslin and Adama is one of the most precious interactions in the show. There  is a moment when Starbuck is being kept by the creepy psychopathic Leoben in a doll house and she is eating her steak while glancing over at the recently deceased copy and she wipes her mouth with her bloody hand-- if you've seen it, you know about the scene. It's really just amazing.

It should be noted that the CGI is topnotch and although heavily used--never abused. The backdrops and ships are lovingly detailed. There is something totally steampunk in how the venerable and aging Galactica relies on it's old model Vipers and corded phones and lack of computer networks yet we still have some classic sci-fi devices like FTL jumps, anti-gravity that is never discussed and some pretty good futuristic technology--but no energy shields, turbo-lasers or transporter-beams.

They really downplay the tech parts making it seem like the culture and reality of the people of the Twelve Colonies could very believably be us in the not-so-distant future. Throughout most of the show, there is this pressure of Cylon extinction overshadowing everything--but it quickly becomes obvious that the remaining humans may not be able to survive themselves.

BSG makes people act like they do in real life and one of the overarching themes is--do we humans really have the right to inherit the earth and the galaxy for that matter? What makes us so good? There are more than a few times when you want to root for the Cylons when you see the survivors make one blundering, self-defeating mistake after another.

After we watched the ending for the first time, my spouse said ""I'll never be able to watch Star Trek quite the same again."" --I agree. This show will spoil you for other sci-fi which will seem quaint and innocent if not naive after watching BSG.

Oh yea, the packaging is bad, blah blah, We didn't buy it for the packaging.  We made our purchase the week after the Universal's new packaging deal expired. Frak! So we put our DVDs in a plastic DVD binder in order of the seasons. It prevents the DVDs from getting scratched up as happens when you take them in and out of the stupid cardboard DVD holders that came with the box.

I've lectured enough--gods damn it. I frakkin love this show. You will too.",1283299200,5,6279,4.961904761904762
3431765,5,B001993Y2C,"It seems most of the negative reviews on here are in regards to the packaging and lack of organization in the discs, as they don't have an episode list. Also, the discs are kind of cheaply put in the case. But this should not detract from the real reason you should be purchasing this...FOR THE FRAKKING TV SHOW! If you are only concerned with the packaging in this purchase, you have more problems than I can help you with here.

So where to start? I have watched this series twice. I watched it once by myself while deployed at my unit. Then after falling in love with the show, I felt compelled to spread the love and show someone else. So I showed it to my fiance. She doesn't play video games, doesn't like SciFi shows, etc. But after watching the first 10 episodes, she was hooked. She was dragging me out of bed to continue watching the show to finish it.

The acting, the story, the surprises, the soundtrack, just EVERYTHING about this show rocks. In Bluray, it looks amazing. It also sounds amazing. If you have a subwoofer, expect to have the entire room shaking. Bear McCray, the composer, uses a lot of drums and bass in his music...and it really gets you immersed in an audio scale..

So there you have it, this show will immerse you with its beautiful images in high def, immerse in full 5.1 surround DTS which sounds amazing, and terrifically put story line. There is a reason this show is award winning throughout the world...and you NEED to add this series to your shopping cart. It is well worth the purchase.",1283040000,,1528,4.469534050179211

I usually love sci-fi, firefly, brisco county, terminator, but this show takes itself far too seriously and is stupid. I actually enjoyed Caprica which is the spinoff of this show, and the original which is pretty bad is about 1000x better.",1281052800,9,672,4.56198347107438
3431771,2,B001993Y2C,"So far, I like the show - grim and gritty space opera with little flashes of humor. This is my kind of thing, at least so far. But the disks are not well packed and we've already had to clean some to get them to play properly, and the box they came in, while very ""cute"", is annoying to handle and store. At this point I am going to have to check and clean all the disks, put them in proper cases, and index them episode by episode - there's just no excuse at this price point.

As for the ""collectible cylon"" - collectibles should have intrinsic value, in my opinion. This is a grey plastic doll with a few movable joints. It's not a selling point.

The show is fun and deserved better packaging - better meaning simpler. Buyer beware.

Addendum: one thing someone unfamiliar with the series may want to know: this is not hard sci fi or even close. Given a choice between a dramatic moment, and sticking to anything that holds up to the most basic science we teach in high school, the writers went for the dramatic moment almost every time. This is only a bad thing if you like your sci fi firmly grounded in factual reality; BSG is much more about myth and legend and psychological angles. I enjoy that aspect, but there *are* a handful of moments where anyone whose got a layman's background in biology, comp sci or physics is going to have to suspend their disbelief with a shiploader's crane. Much more fi than sci. It's more noticeable in this series than in Babylon 5 or Firefly. On the plus side there's not much Star Trekkian pseudoscience; no overt dwelling on the magic di-lithium crystals that make the ship (or any plots) go. Just be aware that if you're analytical by nature, there's going to be a few oh-please moments. Still very worthwhile, though.

Addendum: the oh-please moments shoot through the roof in the last season; the writers apparently lost their way and had no idea where to take the story. It's noticeable enough to be annoying.

I originally posted it for the combined Seasons 4.0 and 4.5 set, but someone kindly suggested I post it elsewhere as well. I hope you find it helpful.

DVD CONFUSION
-------------------------------------------------------
The show is incredible. However, the whole DVD thing has been a disaster. They released it in the worst way possible (see below), Amazon compounded the problem by lumping together reviews for DIFFERENT PRODUCTS, and the DVD manufacturers seem to be changing the contents of some products. I cannot imagine how someone who is not deeply familiar with it is supposed to purchase this wonderful show. Certainly, they would hesitate to give it as a gift! Let's hope this solves your problem.

In one sentence, I can say that here is what you want to get: Seasons 1, 2.0, 2.5, 3, 4.0, 4.5, and The Plan. I have links to them below. If you get these, then you will be sure to have it all.

Occasionally I come across things like ""Battlestar Galactica: Season 4.5 - Limited Edition Gift Set (2009).""

========================================

OPTIONS FOR PURCHASING THEM ALL TOGETHER: BAD TO GOOD
-------------------------------------------------------
-Battlestar Galactica: The Complete Series (with COLLECTIBLE CYLON). Not recommended. I do not own this, but according to the reviews, it is packaged poorly WITHOUT AN EPISODE LIST. That seems like a horrible idea for four seasons of a tv show. Apparently, it contains the same DVDs as the ones sold separately (explained above).
-Battlestar Galactica: The Complete Series (the one in the GRAY BOX). Recommended. I do not own this. Good reviews of it so far. Packaging problems were fixed.
-Battlestar Galactica: The Complete Series (with COLLECTIBLE CYLON) [BLU-RAY] or the gray box [BLU-RAY] set. Recommended. I do not own this. Seems to include some extras, but not significant. It also has an episode list, according to the reviews. It might be worth buying if you wanted to get everything together.

BOTTOM LINE:
-------------------------------------------------------
As far as I can tell from the reviews, I think there are two choices:
(1) Buy either Blu-Ray set or the DVD set in the gray box.
(2) Purchase everything separately (make sure to get all of the stuff mentioned above).

NOTE:
-------------------------------------------------------
-The ""Face of the Enemy"" webisodes (episodes shown only online) have not been made available for purchase in any of the sets as far as I can tell. What a shame!
-Also, if anyone sees any mistakes in this review, please tell me and I will edit it. Frustratingly, the manufacturers seem to be changing the contents of some sets, so it is possible that my information has become outdated.",1280707200,"2,784",5577,7.069565217391304

This is by far the worse packaging I have ever encountered for Blu-Ray releases.

To add insult to injury, some of the episodes did not play correctly at all. They would stop working and then skip ahead.

The blame must go to the manufacturer. I am aware of a new Blu-Ray version of Battlestar Gallactica: The Complete Series is now available, and from what I can tell it is packaged correctly with hard plastic instead of cardboard and should be easier to remove to play.

One set is a large silver box and the other is black and comes with a collectible cylon. This review is for the silver box set. This box set includes all of the episodes from the series and also the miniseries. It also contains Razor and The plan. The Plan is sometimes missed because it is in the same case as disk 4 of season 4. On the outside of the case there is no mention of it at all but it is there. I didn't even know it was there until I opened the case to watch disk 4. Each disk also has lots of deleted scenes, commentary, and other special behind the scenes features. This is a great series and box set.",1279584000,602,718,4.027972027972028
3431778,5,B001993Y2C,"I have the ""newer"" box set (you know, the one in the picture), and as others have pointed out the packaging is no longer a concern.  So now that that's out of the way, how does the set actually hold up?  Very well actually, and at times admirably.

BSG was never a bright and shiny show.  Visually speaking it's cinematography was every bit as dark as many of the themes the show explored.  This works to great effect in keeping with the tone of the narrative itself.  The only problem, if you consider it such, is that this style of photography doesn't necessarily lend itself to high defnition video.  Don't get the wrong idea, BSG looks gorgeous on Blu, and at this point I refuse to watch it on any other format.  Just keep in mind that the artistic goals of the shows creators was not to present the most clear and crisp visual presentation available, and you'll be happy.

What these vagaries mean in real world terms is that video quality will range from jaw droppingly-crisp to painfully muddled.  This variance is visible from season to season, episode to episode, and even from scene to scene in any given episode.  Is this a bad thing?  Hardly.  I've watched all of the broadcast episodes, most in HD, and all of the dvds(by the way the season one dvds look phenomenal), and there is a noticeable up tick in clarity on every single episode.  In short this is the best version of BSG that you will ever see, it looks the way it is intended to look ... period.

If you're familiar with Universal's ""U-control"" interface, then you know what you're getting with this set.  I'm not a big fan of U-control, but the layout of the menus is very clean, easy to navigate and understand, and minimalist.  If you pause a disc a Universal screen saver will appear on screen, which is actually a nice touch, although as is the case with all java-enabled blu ray discs stopping playback means you will have to search for your resume point (java people get on this already, very annoying).

This set includes all of the same bonus features as the DVD box sets.  That said, some of the commentaries leave something to be desired.  I was never a fan of the podcast commentaries while the show was on the air.  I've always felt that they lacked, some more than others, the kind of in depth analysis that commentaries recorded after the on-air run of a show possess.  Still, there is more good here than bad, but it would've been nice to see some new commentaries recorded specifically for the full series set.  Who knows, with BD-live functionality maybe someone will finally put it to good use and we'll see some new commentary tracks down the road.

All in all this set is going to be tough to beat.  It has every single episode accurately presented in HD, many special features that will occupy days (weeks?) of your life if you so choose, and it all comes in a sensible easy-to-store box that doesn't look garish and won't damage your discs.  I waited for a long time to pick up this box set, and I'm even more pleased with it than I anticipated.  This is a must buy.",1279584000,107,3063,4.472072072072072

After that happened I was glad about one thing: Amazon standing behind the product something not every DVD seller will do.... Do yourself a favor and buy each season separately.... Yes, it will be a little more money but you can avoid the aggravation of out of the box brand new damaged DVDs....

3431789,5,B001993Y2C,"This review is for the new and improved packaging.

This is a repackage of the Battlestar Glaactica Complete series. The older set had complaints about discs being scratched by the sleeves. This new and improved set does not have that problem. They are in plastic holders and I have not noticed a problem yet. There is no cylon figure included, but the plan is included this time. Face of the enemy webisodes are still missing, but I heard this is due to licensing disagreements. Caprica is not included either, but that's it's own show.

Personally, I like this box better. My own complete opinion here - the older box reminded me of the 1970's battlestar - more cheesy childish looking - that box is suited for a shelf in some kid's room with his action figures, unfixed bed and clothes all over the floor. This box shows the characters in black and white, is much more mature looking and more suited for this show. This box belongs on a shelf in Adama's quarters next to his books. I prefer to have this on my shelf rather than the other set.

Episode lists and synopsis are included - this helps in keeping track of which disc to put in to show which episode. One issue that I dislike is the habit of having extended episodes fleshed out on separate discs. For instance, the boxing episode on season 3 - on one disc has the original airing, and the next disc has the extended version that has additional 25 minutes. If you were watching it sequentially without reading the episode list beforehand, you would end up seeing the shorter version and then have to rewatch to see the extended scene.  Yes, this is a minor issue, but it can be annoying.

The custom menus and disc structure is very nice though - I like how the menu can be brought up while a episode is playing in the background, rather than other shows where the menu pauses the show and comes up - pulling you out of immersion. Features like bookmarks and the progress bar when you pause and unpause is awesome. There are tons of extras, commentary, bd live stuff, they really go all out on the extras, which is a definate plus. I even like the screensaver when you leave the show on pause for awhile. I'm not that knowledgeable in bluray authroing, but with the awesome menus and controls this disc has - why can't they make chapters out of the extended episodes in a way that if you run a episode, you can click the normal version aid it would just skip over the extended scenes, but if you click extended, then it plays all chapters?  Surely that would save disc space which can be used to push up the show's bitrate higher?

The show has a grain effect to it - this is part of the art form that is battlestar galactica. Dark and Gritty, just like the box art. Theres multiple warnings before some of the episodes indicating this, and on every episode of the first discs of season 1-4, theres commentary of Ronald D. Moore explaining this too. It would be great if he talked about it on the first episode of each season, but on every ep on the first discs of each season is a bit much.. With all that said - the 1080p quality is still better than the dvd version, the audio is better and the extras rock.

The show itself is awesome. I have been following it since the miniseries in 2003, and have watched it through to the end. I am going through it again now that I have it on Bluray. This show is dark, gritty, dramatic and not cheesy at all.",1276646400,16,3414,4.373817034700315

At the time of purchase none of the on-line renters had Blu-ray for Seasons 3 and 4.  The packaging is cute:  all the seasons are held in a Cylons helmet. Plus there is an action figure.  It needs a poster of the cast.

Now in this time where people are exchanging videos on the internet you would think it would be in the distributors best interest to give the consumer a great product to keep them happy. This disc set proves the axiom wrong.

Box is horrible - I put them in a DVD case anyway, no biggie. The cylon toy is worthless - I don't care. The disks don't have episode labels - you can print a list.

My complaints: The episode menu was designed to show four episodes. A few disks have five, and I found it hard to see the little arrow pointing at a screen for a single fifth episode. I finally realized I had skipped a few episodes when the ""Last time..."" recap showed stuff I hadn't seen. Now I know to look, and it's not as big a deal.

I wish they didn't show a sequence of scenes from the current episode in the opening credits. Shut your eyes when the drums kick in in the music if you don't like spoilers.

What I hate more than anything... I bought the entire set. I don't need the lame welcome by the producer every time I hit play for any episode that is on the first disk of any season.

3431807,5,B001993Y2C,"Hello,
  I see by many earlier reviews there was great concern over the original packaging of this set. This review addresses that issue only.
  I recently bought the new repackaged complete Battlestar series and found the packaging to be perfect. Each DVD comes in its own plastic case. The plastic case is durable and made of good quality and has a brief description of the specific episodes on the back to help you locate the specific episode look are looking for. Each of the four seasons the show ran has its own box that contain the DVDs for that season. Example -5 DVDs in the season 1 box. The box for season 4 also has the DVDs for season 4.5 for a total of 8 DVDs inside.
  I understood that the original complete series main box was large and ackward and didn't well well into normal shelf space. The 4 season boxes all fit perfectly ( not too tight or too loose) into one sturdy main box. So it is easy to remove an individual seasons while leaving the other three seasons inside. The main box that contains everything is 8 inches high by 8 inches wide by 5.75 deep.
  So you don't buy the wrong set here's how to recognize the original package from the new and greatly improved package. The new package is gray and has the 5 principle characters on the front. It also has 3 secondary characters on each side. The back of the box is where you remove the 4 individual season boxes.

  My guess is that the head honcho at Univeral saw all the negative remarks on the poor packaging of the original set and kicked some butt. ""Do it right"" is probably what he (or she) demanded and they did. Hopefully this new, complete series, packaging will become the industry standard.",1273968000,17,1681,4.425324675324675
3431808,5,B001993Y2C,"Someone recommended this show to me a few months ago so I decided to pick it up. My preconceptions of it was all based on the awful name of the show, so I never thought to watch it. Plus, all the SciFi channel makes is Stargate or B-movies.... but they insisted it was awesome.

So this particular BluRay version is cheaper than the DVD set. Why? This version has awful packaging. And it's not so much the packaging that ticks me off, it's the lack of a pamphlet explaining what episodes are on what discs. I watched ""Pegasus"" twice in a row... first I watched the regular version and then I watched the extended. I didn't do this on purpose, I was just putting the discs in and pressing play. I didn't realize that that is how they put in the extended versions of episodes.

Still, this was the best scifi series of television ever, no question, and it's just amazing television period.

If you're looking to watch it, I wouldn't waste the extra 60 bucks on the ""better packaging"" BluRay. The point of the blurays isn't the packaging, it's the show itself, after all. Just be aware that there is no list of episodes and deal with the packaging you get here.",1273795200,,1158,4.427230046948357

It is an interesting series with beautiful CG special effects, excellent actors and actresses. Unfortunately the sub-story lines got stretched at places and cease to make sense.  Whenever the plot gets stuck it brought in ""gods will"". I will not list the inconsistencies here because it is not the purpose of my review. The inconsistencies became more obvious when you watch the entire series continuously, as if the writers made up the main and sub plots only as the series progressed. The entire series is full of confused human and cylon trying to find themselves.  Throughout the series you see human and cylon hallucinate as if they were all on dope. The series tried to take on too many serious issues and had too much preaching. There were so many sleeper cylons living among the humans, the entire Galatica fleet should have been wiped out before the 3rd season ends as I think it should. Vulgarity was taken as being cool to the extend it is affecting some of the reviewers. The mood of the series is too dark for my liking.  The only way to enjoy this series is to shut off one's logic. I do not find this series entertaining. If you are into dark science fiction type of stories, you may like it.  Just do not expect it to be like Star Trek, Dune, Babylon 5, Stargate or even the original Battlestar Galatica.

A word on the DVD set picture quality.  The picture quality overall is good.  My dvd player is a Pioneer BlueRay BDP-51FD.

Can't speak for the old packaging but the new one is darn near perfect.  Each season comes in it's own case just as if you were to buy a single season from the store.  All 4 seasons plus the movie ""Plan"" are packaged in the box that you see above.  It also contains an extended version of the episode Razor.

Overall it's very nice and I have little to complain about.  The outer box is cardboard and got dinged up a little bit in shipping but other than that it's a fantastic set.

I have only seen this show on blu-ray so I can't really comment on how it compares to unconverted DVD.  Since it was produced to have a grainy look to it anyways, you might be able to get away with saving some money and getting the DVD set.

3431842,5,B001993Y2C,"So one of the things that prevented me from initially buying this complete series from the original release was that packaging.  The main reason was it was released years before the individual seasons began to be released, so I feared perhaps it wasn't re-mastered.  So I sprang for this newer release of the complete series.

Everything's already great and such, so I'll clarify the packaging:

It's exactly the sort of packaging you'd get from the individual season releases.  One of my main gripes actually is that the Season 2 Blu Ray release was released the same time as this one, with an individual Season 3 and Season 4 coming in some dim and distant future.

Instead, this release has the whole series, with each season in its own cardboard container.  Season 1 and Season 2 are exactly the same as the individual season releases, with season 3 and 4 likely going to end up being the same design as this one.  It also comes with ""The Plan"" in its own individual plastic case

As for the series: No movie, TV show, song, any work of art has ever drawn me in so intensely, made me care so much for the people and the objects and the world, and made me cry so intensely, virtually on cue with the musical cues in ""Daybreak"".  It's a series I watched through over a month's time, and went right back to watch it over again because I found myself missing it so intensely.  Even after a second runthrough, I cannot stop thinking about it.

Battlestar Galactica is not a science fiction program.  Calling it such is painfully weak and limiting in describing what it is, like calling a living person a bag of meat.  It's a drama about people, propelling a story that is deeply personal, pseudo-mystical, painfully compelling, and blissfully free of the sorts of things that made Star Trek Voyager and Enterprise, and even some episodes of The Next Generation insufferable: pointless technobabble, broad, one-dimensional characters, little to no continuity within a show or even the same episode, bland, boring, generic visuals and worse music.",1270598400,7,2044,4.753541076487252
3431843,5,B001993Y2C,"This series seems to be plagued by packaging issues. ""The Plan"" is in fact in the set but hidden in the last season 4.0 box.

Other than that, all of the horrible packaging stories I've read seem to be negated with this set. The episode description/listing is on the back of each slim case. As far as I know there are no webisodes.

This series in many ways is like one long epic miniseries rather than just a TV show. There is a clear beginning, middle, and end. If it stands the test of time it will possibly replace Star Wars as my favorite sci-fi series of all time.

------------------------------------------------

Original Post:

The DVD set released on April 6, 2010 DOES NOT include The Plan.

The show is great, my 1 star review is simply due to The Plan not being included. I was really excited about this, but the failure to include The Plan in a ""Complete Series"" set seems...wrong. I will just buy in separately, but hopefully folks will read this and not be as disappointed as I was.

Sadly, there was no real information on the product page. It does say 26 discs. The set actually has 25. I may contact the manufacturer and see if they can do anything, perhaps I was shipped the wrong item.

3431847,5,B001993Y2C,"WARNING: This review made by an Australian, so my take on the series may be different to what the American audience would highlight (without making any assumptions).

I love Sci-Fi as a genre, and was around to watch the original series of Battlestar Gallactica in the 1970s with Lorne Green and Richard Hatch (more on him later).  It therefore was with some trepidation I purchased the remake 'complete series' edition.

I am halfway through Season 2.5 and I can honestly say I am glued to the screen (having a 46-inch Sony Bravia LCD TV sort of helps - keeps the room warm too). You will not appreciate this series nearly as much if you are watching via a cheap DVD player and a smallish TV - folks this series screams 'make it big!'.

The series is easily the most complex and riveting work, truly a work of art, I have had the pleasure of watching in many, many years.  It definitely is not for the kiddies - the 'MA rating' (for Australian audiences - 15 and over) is well-deserved but there is not gratuitous violence or sex (and hardly any of that so far, which to my mind just reaffirms the heights to which the team who made this series aspired).

A cast of thousands, with superb casting - many actors I had never heard of before are perfect for their roles.  It is a grand and bold vision - the survival of 'civilisation' (We know Ghandi had a thing or two to say about that concept - well, start watching...).  The themes covered are too many to mention and I don't want to give away the plot, suffice to say the twists and turns are magnificently wrought and more than occasionally shattering.

The quality of the production is extraordinary including the stunning and beautiful special effects which personally I do not think have been surpassed (just goes to show what you can do with the right crew in place).

A comparison with the Star Wars prequels is called for (here I go, brave or what?) - the writing in the prequels was, in my humble opinion, often risible, and the acting wooden, although many of the special effects sequences were breathtaking in scope and execution.  In Battlestar Gallactica, the writing and acting also is first-class and pitch-perfect, the storylines complex, the many themes definitely intended for an adult audience and, I think, would serve very well as a starting-point for a discussion with the teenagers of the household after each episode - many moral and ethical issues are covered.

Courage and audacity are hallmarks of this production, along with honouring the ideas of the original series. In that respect, Richard Hatch's appearance in a supporting role was both a great surprise and brought back memories of the original series - a perfect bit of casting.  I won't spoil it by revealing his character's role in the unfolding events, but he shows himself to be a highly capable actor who has a tremendous presence on screen and is (again) a perfect fit.

I could go on, and on, and on, but to delve into the many deeper issues explored by the writers of the series would be unfair.

A word on the packaging of the complete series - I think some reviewers are getting more than a little carried away.  For goodness sake, this is one of the stellar achievements of our time, and they complain about the design of the box!  My only concern is that (a) the box did not seem to have an environmentally friendly focus uppermost in mind when it was designed and (b) there appears to be unusual opportunities for dust to get in.

But it isn't that big.  However, here's a tip for the downhearted - buy your own plastic DVD holders for storage and chuck the original packaging.  If your bookshelf isn't tall enough - buy a bigger bookshelf, and perhaps a few bigger books.

All you Sci-Fi fans out there wanting to escape for a while from everyday existence and let your imaginations soak in the awe-inspiring vision of this series - hand over the money and grab the series while you can - a remarkable achievement all round and definitely a series worthy of 'Collector' status.",1269043200,6,4029,4.606993006993007

My only beef is with the packaging. The outer box is fine, and it's really cool how the top lifts up to reveal each season on each side of the square. The problem is the box for each season. Each disc is in little cardboard slots, and its very difficult to get a specific disc out of there without getting fingerprints all over the disc. I'd suggest anyone who buys this set to take out the disc they are currently watching and put it in a separate jewel case, or something, to avoid having to keep going into the box.

3431857,4,B001993Y2C,"First off, if you've watched the series you know it is an excellent drama full of action, intrigue, betrayal, moral dilemmas etc.  I've always said that the biggest problem with the series is that they called it Battlestar Galactica. They should have called it something else and even stated that it was based on the series from the 1970s. Then they would have gotten away from the preconceived notions of the cheesy, yet enjoyable original.  The series combined with the extras (commentaries on every episode so far, deleted scenes, mini docs and yes the Resistance WEBISODES ARE INCLUDED ON S3D2 on the blu-ray discs)and video transfer gets five stars from me weighted most heavily.

The packaging looks cool but it's crap.  It's huge but with a big empty space in the middle. The internal disc holders aren't even the digipacks, included in most collections, as many pointed out.  Usually,large collections like this would included books and such as well as the normal booklets that accompany the discs with the episodes descriptions.  This collection doesn't even have an episode list ANYWHERE.  That is particularly problematic when several episodes precede extended episodes on the next disc with no warning.  Someone else wrote up a full description of this mess but in a nutshell don't watch Pegasus it's extended about 18 minutes on the next disc. Skip the last episode on S3D2 for the same reason as well as S4D3 shows four episodes but the last one combines the first 3 into an extended one.  I know I missed one in there but you can find it in another review. Three stars for packaging.

Lastly, I haven't seen it mentioned but the menus are cumbersome in not intuitive.  You're left to guess what the circles do as well as other features.  I don't know if it's the fault of the discs or my PS3 but the machine doesn't remember disc position even if a press stop by accident.  So don't bump you remote. Menus are below average, two stars.

The last two items are superfluous to the series; however,  while one cannot give it five stars the content overcomes its shortcomings.",1266796800,,2087,4.790502793296089

It contains all of the aired shows, the mini-series, and the additional ""Razor"" series that came between the 3rd and 4th season.  It does not, however, contain ""The Plan.""  The packaging, while it seems pretty neat on the outside, is pretty cheap.  All four seasons are packaged separately in their own cardboard containers, however, the interior of the package has each Blu-Ray in a little pocket that is very flimsy, and allows the discs to slide around inside.  I would prefer to have traditional cases that fold out and have the plastic piece that holds the disc stationary.  This should not be a reason against purchasing the package, though.  Since Blu-Rays have a scratch resistant coating, this type of packaging should be fine for storing them.  One could always purchase separate cases for all of the discs if s/he is concerned about the packaging.
Coming from someone who did not see the series on television prior to ordering this series, it is clear to me that this is the best way to view the series.  Each episode is a cliffhanger, so you will really have a hard time not watching ""just one more episode.""

3431874,5,B001993Y2C,"Fifty years ago, humanity's robotic servant Cylons suddenly turned on their masters, and vanishes off into space after a terrible war.

But of course the story doesn't stop -- and it turned out to be a rare case of a remake becoming spectacularly better than the source material. ""Battlestar Galactica - The Complete Series"" is a grimy, dark, violent and hopeful sci-fi adventure saga -- and while it has its ups and downs like any series, it's a brilliant and powerful piece of work.

Forty years after the war's end, the Cylons unexpectedly return to the Twelve Colonies and start wiping out ships and cities. The Battlestar Galactica (an aging warship about to be turned into a museum) is forced to flee the world of Caprica with a collection of refugee-crammed ships, commanded by Commander William Adama (Edward James Olmos) and the new President Laura Roslin (Mary McDonnell).

Now the people of the Twelve Colonies must find a new home -- their goal is Earth, a legendary planet with other humans on it. Unfortunately, they have been infiltrated by the treacherous scientist Gaius Baltar (James Callis), and a group of Cylons who are almost indistinguishable from human beings -- they even have emotions and can interbreed with humans.

And their journey has its own perils: sabotage, assassination attempts, betrayals, shortages of water, food and fuel, the introduction of cruel martial law, religious conflict, the discovery of another surviving Battlestar called the Pegasus, and the overhanging fear of infiltration by the humanoid Cylons. And though they find a habitable (but miserable) planet, soon the ragtag fleet is forced to flee again -- and eventually discover that their goal is not what they hoped...

Anyone expecting ""Battlestar Galactica"" to be a copy of its predecessor is going to be horribly disappointed. This is sci-fi at its most compelling -- a gritty, bleak, dark story of war and desperate escapes, and there are plenty of moral dilemmas (Roslin ordering the death of a baby Cylon/human hybrid). And it explores the truly compelling questions about what it is to be human and alive -- and to deserve to be.

The writers wrap together hard SF with threads of mystical science fiction, and undertones of religion and philosophy. The writing is solid and snappy (""Old gods die hard""), but frequently lapses into dramatic, powerful speeches that barely manage to dodge being cheesy.  And each character is given an intricate and complex journey to follow, filled with pain, death, sorrow and slowly moving beyond their own personal problems. Friendships are pulled apart, alliances are formed, and lots of horrible and morally questionable choices are made. Some of these people are redeemed, some are destroyed, and some discover that they are not even human.

Olmos and McDonnell are the powerful leaders in this story, and both actors do a brilliant job -- especially Mcdonnell with Roslin's breast cancer, and Olmos with his tragic past. The entire cast is pretty much brilliant -- Callis as the ever-changing Baltar, Michael Hogan as the unlikeable Saul Tigh, and Grace Park as a humanoid Cylon whose love changes her goals.  But the best ones are Katee Sackhoff as Kara ""Starbuck"" Thrace, and Tricia Helfer as the ethereal Cylon Number Six -- both women are deeply entwined with the search for Earth.

The previous ""complete series"" release angered a lot of fans because it didn't include the ""Plan"" movie that shows some of the series' events from the Cylon point of view. This new double-dipper WILL have ""The Plan"" and new packaging added in -- but it apparently still won't have the ""Face of the Enemy"" webisodes. I don't know WHAT they are doing, honestly.

""Battlestar Galactica: The Complete Series"" is a stunning and powerful story that transcends the sci-fi label, and deserves to be praised to the skies. As for this new release, buy it if you don't have it.",1265587200,,3905,5.001540832049306

3431877,2,B001993Y2C,"BSG in the beginning looked like it could have been a worthy contender to match or even outdo JMS's epic 5 year story arc 'Babylon 5' B5 made us invest emotionally in the characters and their journey of development, an investment which was ultimately worthwhile. BSG in the beginning offered something similar but failed to deliver. It also failed to deliver a coherent story arc - the so called 'plan' was never realised - but was instead a massively wasted opportunity.

Ronald D Moore was given the task of turning a turkey of a TV series from the 70's into a relevant, highly watchable and engrossing contemporary show with an overarching story arc. In the first 2 or 3 seasons it looked like he was going to pull that 'miracle' off.  But no from the 3rd season onwards with a couple of notable exceptions story wise he turned it back into a turkey.

BSG has been an infuriating roller coaster ride. Often it has been a truly great TV series and at other times it has lost the plot completely.

What could have been a truly great show has fallen flat on its face with the fourth series and the final episode. The plot threads we all hoped would be at least partially explained have been written off as the work of God.

RDM has used ""deus ex machina"" to tie the series up. This plot device is the ultimate sin of any writer and has to be ultimate cop out in a show of this stature.

Basically this means that RDM can finish off the story using the absurdist teleology ""God did it in his mysterious way.""

As H.G. Wells himself said regarding the deus ex machina, ""If anything is possible, then nothing is interesting.""

Well, with God, anything can happen. Aristotle also said something similar way back when- and i think we can agree HE was a wise man.

The story was much richer and open to more interpretation when the gods were portrayed through faith as metaphor, but the Gods are cast as real and cannot be really interpreted in any other way.

Season 4's religious infatuation was a huge indicator of the direction this whole thing was falling into. The religious cliched chocolate box picture lid dreams of cancer victims sailing on the boat over the river to meet the loved ones on the other side etc. Surely a program of this stature could add more substance and pragmatism to such dark occurrances of dealing with terminal illness?

Many have said that the religious content was implicit from the start. This is true, but one can criticise the way the religious subtext has been handled throughout the series. Galactica's God is an interventionist God whose machinations and interference only devalues all the great work put into the characterisations and great acting. The motivations of the characters loses all meaning in this deterministic universe. The characters lose all responsibility for their own actions...remember this is God's plan. So 4 years of brilliant character driven plots and motivations gets flushed down the cosmic toilet.

Even earlier prophecies made by the Cylon Hybrids were ignored or just passed over without further mention.

Any reasonably explained scientific rationalism has been ditched completely, so those looking for any self consistent rules to be played out will be disappointed. Hard SF fans will be disappointed. Especially those wise enough to understand that the universe is not a deterministic clockwork one in the Newtonian sense but intrinsically indeterminate in the quantum paradigm/chaos theory..

If you try to analyse the show through the religious route it fails even more spectacularly and shoots itself in the head throughout the whole 4th series. There are far too many variables where God has to work in mysterious ways to get the characters to where they finally end up. This just confirms the lack of a truly coherent and consistent story arc.
The final hour of this tragedy dismantles anything built up over the 4 years of hard graft. The only way the religious theme worked at all was that the Cylons belief in the one true god gave them motivation to ethnically cleanse the immoral humans and their false gods (sound familiar?)

There are also many bad mistakes along the way. The major one being the position of stars in the constellations in the tomb of Athena way back in season 2. The constellations (position and names of the stars) indicate they are the same ones we see in our night sky. The constellations on scorched earth matched these. This meant that scorched earth should have been our Earth. When our Earth is eventually found the constellation idea has been quietly dropped. And this was supposed to be a major event.

The references which places BSG to our culture like greek gods mythology, telephones, radar, turns of language etc is ignored by placing the finale in the deep past. There is no way these references could have survived to have an effect. RDM uses the ridiculous unprovable idea of collective consciousness to cover that one. Anyhow God wrote ""all along the watchtower"" (not Bob Dylan sorry)and implanted it in various characters over the series.

The 7th Cylon was also an error and had to be hastily passed over. (whoops someone forgot how to count to 12!)

The evidently important opera house vision was passed off lamely in an ill thought out couple of minutes. It therefore became totally meaningless. This too had been built up to be a major event.

Even if the constellations matched our earth's or any other, the position of the stars would be very different (not even close)because Moore decided to use Earth 150,000 years ago. It just doesn't pan out at all. By using the star patterns depicted this should have meant that the end of galactica should have been in our future - not in our past as presented here. There are many, many other examples of these kind of mistakes littered over the 4 seasons.

The ending using Mitochondrial eve idea was cliched beyond belief. The Mitochondrial Eve of 200,000 years ago is NOT our common ancestor, or even common genetic ancestor. She is the most-recent common ancestor of all humans alive on Earth today with respect to matrilineal descent. That may seem like a mouthful, but without even a single one of those qualifying phrases, any description or discussion of the ME reduces to a lot of nonsense. ME is an ill named genetic based mathematical model and nothing to do with Adam and Eve pseudo scientific creationism as depicted by this show.

Basically it was stated that the 12 colony humans were highly compatible with the early humans found on ""Earth."" This meant that Hera's DNA,Cylon DNA and 12 colony DNA was practically identical. This is absurd as the 12th colony was stated (inaccurately) to be a million light years away from earth. This would mean that for the 2 species of Earth and 12 colonies the DNA being so close was well nigh impossible. And there is no way that the evolution of both worlds be so convergent (or as in this case identical) This is at least openly admitted by the show but swept under the carpet with the ""God's will"" magic wand. Basically this just smacks of pseudo scientific creationism. If the DNA was different enough to Earth mitochondrial DNA it would mean that we would not now be related genetically to our primates or anything else in our evolutionary past. We would be genetically tied to Hera instead. This is absurd. The main point is that if Hera's DNA was so close to human DNA there would be no importance or reason whatsoever for her to be the basis of our own human-ness. It is totally pointless. So why bother at all?

The rest of Galactica's crew from the pragmatic view of human history must have been wiped out completely anyway. The galacticans ironically all agree in a consensus never seen in all 4 conflict filled series to destroy all their technology and settle all over the globe.... to die out with a whimper. maybe RDM thought he was still writing for Star Trek and invoked the ridiculous concept of the prime directive subconsciously? The Hominids didn't leave Africa until 60,000 years ago. and modern humans evolved there 150,000 years ago. So how do the galacticans help humans and give them the best part of them for the future? No records, no archeology, no technology etc. mass suicide...yes.

The survivors suddenly just become thoughtless consensual drones of a religious god as in Python's satirical warning in ""the life of Brian.""
The weekly conflict between factions is swept under the carpet.

One of the main themes of this show was ""are we worthy to survive?"" and this brought in many valid questions as well as answers to this in a religious context. The religious content WAS implicit from the start, but there was a better balance between gritty stark reality and religion in the first 3 seasons. The series has really gone off the rails since mid way through series 3. The last season taken as a whole had few highpoints and it wasted a lot of precious time on nonsense which was never expounded consistently. ie: the final 5 cylons, who was the 5th cylon? (who cares? It didn't matter a jot anyway to the plot) How did Starbuck return from the dead? Why did they find her body/viper many light years from where it met its end? Why write her out and then bring her back? A lot of these elements felt like mere dramatic plot devices and didn't go anywhere. This just devalued Starbucks meaty role into that of a mere pawn.

When the show was good it was the best there's ever been. The mini series, the episodes about the Pegasus, the New Caprica plot lines, the rise of Tom Zarek, the collaborator witch hunts, the black market, the insurrection, scorched Earth et al.

The final episodes are entertaining in a superficial way but just fall apart under any kind of scrutiny.

The cast gave exceptional performances, some of the writing was excellent, some dire and the cgi was of feature film quality.

Many episodes in this final set felt like mere padding. It would have been a much better ending if they had finished the series half way through when they found scorched Earth. It would have been BRAVER. But no the ending RDM used renders the actions of previous seasons pointless. Re watching the series becomes a redundant act - knowing what you know at the end.

It became ever more apparent as season 4 imploded in on itself that they were just making it up as they went along.

I know this review may upset some fans, but after checking out the BSG blog sites a lot of fans feel let down. I have been a big fan of the show and found it to be at its best when it was most pragmatic/political/sociological/psychological. But this is my opinion which i have a right to exercise.

If this is the best RDM can do i feel inclined not to buy the final season and will probably give the forthcoming ""Caprica"" and ""The Plan"" a wide berth. If RDM can incurr a miraculous creationist interventionist God here there's no reason he won't use it again down the line.

BSG had great potential which it failed to recognise. Like many TV shows before and i suppose many more which will follow this will happen again and again and again.....

The real tragedy of BSG is that the series was built upon great characters grounded in a real world political social context. The first 3 seasons and part of season 4 built strongly upon these compelling themes. The final season dismantled these great themes and made them utterly pointless. The finale is probably the most disappointing end to a series i have ever seen. It is all the more disappointing because the show WAS so brilliant to start with.

BSG will sadly be remembered as the show that started off great but had the stupid ending.",1265241600,12,11629,4.698280098280098
3431878,5,B001993Y2C,"Universal is repackaging the series to include the telefilm ""The Plan"" and in all new slim packaging.  The only thing known at this point is that the discs will be in ""slim packaging"" surrounded by an outer slip box cover.  I'm guessing they'll be four 6-disc blu-ray cases (similar to the Sarah Connor Chronicles) in an outer box.

3431880,3,B001993Y2C,"Presumably if you're going to spend this much money for a TV show, you've seen all or most of it already and you know that the show is well-written and directed with very real, three-dimensional characters.  So I will refrain from reviewing the show except to say that it is well worth a watch.

I wrote this review to warn you about the packaging:  it's horrible.  The actual box is 22 cm tall and ~19 cm wide on each side.  That means that it will almost definitely not fit in your video shelf at home.  In order to remove the discs, you will probably need both hands to lift the gargantuan top half of the box up.  You can do it with one hand, but you will be uncomfortable.

Once you open one of the four disc boxes for the first time, don't be surprised if the internal packaging is slightly damaged.  This is because the boxes are made from thin paperboard packaging -- thinner stock than a box of cereal.  It's sad to think that a box of cereal is designed to be used perhaps a dozen times before being discarded whereas DVD/blu-ray boxes should theoretically last a lifetime.  Out of the four boxes in my packaging, only one was pristine.  The other three had crease marks in their sleeves, indicating folding at some prior point.

With the sleeve system, removing a disc without touching the data surface is very difficult unless you turn the entire box upside-down and hold the other discs in the box in place.  If this sounds awkward to you, well...you're right.  Note that if you hold the box upside-down when closed, the discs will slide around inside though not fall out of their sleeves, but I would still not recommend doing it.

Another reviewer pointed out that there is no table of contents telling you which episodes are on which disc, nor is there a list where you can find special features.  If you want to watch a specific episode in the middle of a season, gods help you.  (By the way, on the topic of special features, I will say that there is a commentary track for nearly every episode.  Cool!)

Oh, and I really don't care about the Cylon action figure on the top of the box, either.

The packaging is a clear case of trying too hard.  The only thing they would've had to do to impress me would be to present it in a colorful box with the corners cut out of it, put each season into its own box and list the episodes and special features on the back.

Here's what I recommend:  if you can, spend more money and buy the entire series season-by-season.  Unfortunately, as of this writing, some seasons aren't available on blu-ray on Amazon.com.  Hopefully these lists, below, will help you assemble your collection without this packaging abomination (note that neither ""The Plan"" nor ""Caprica"" are in the ""Complete Series"" collection, so I didn't list them below).

It tells a complete story from beginning to end that is a wonderful ride.  I got this as a Christmas gift.  After reading many complaints on here about the various problems with the content and packaging, I decided to chime in with my two cents.

The production quality in the blu ray format is a little lacking.  Some scenes look absolutely gorgeous.  Others look very grainy.  But I guess over all I watch it for the content.  There are things that I missed the first, and second times around, that I am enjoying this time.  As for the packaging, it is a bit one the poor side.  Although I did go out and spent a whopping $5 on a cd case to put them all in to save them from being scratched.  It is a huge oversight to not have a booklet that describes the episodes that are on the discs.  I can not believe that they did not include that.  Not that you can't find the blu ray episode guide somewhere online, but they should have included one.  No excuses there.  That would be my one big complaint.
Those are my only complaints though.  I do think that the series is well worth the money, even with poor packaging.  I plan on getting every penny out of this as I watch it over and over again.

3431883,4,B001993Y2C,"Hi,
Most important issue is the show is true Sci-Fi, not just special effects like Star Trek 2009.  Storyline is fantastic (no giant plot holes like why Spock wouldn't go back in time to save his people from genocide, how cadet Kirk can jump to captain military status, how Nero can have 30 yrs. of advanced technology but refuse to save his world and instead seek revenge - hopefully the next movie will have Spock going back in time to correct the timeline now that new fans are on board so old fans don't refuse to stay on board.  Sorry - I digress)

It's true that box is distasteful and plastic casing should have been present, but the show is great.

Below are ""pearls"" that many will find helpful to maximally enjoy the fantastic BG series.

One star lost b/c TEN webisodes omitted from Face of the Enemy as poor decision akin to rotten cardboard boxing.

-Season 2, disc 2 ends with ""Pegasus"" - don't watch it like I did, b/c disc 3 starts with the extended unaired version.
-Season 3, disc 2 ends with ""Unfinished Business"" - don't watch it b/c disc 3 opens with the extended unaired version.
-Season 4, disc 3, the last one - the menu shows 3 'episodes' - 1st- Daybreak part 1, 2nd-Daybreak parts 2&3, and 3rd-Daybreak extended unaired. Maybe I'm a dolt, but it appeared to me the extended unaired covered parts 2&3 - so I watched the broadcast version of part 1, then chose the extended unaired option for 2&3 - WRONG. That option covers ALL 3 PARTS. So I watched the first part all over again, minutes after just completing it.
-Hidden Deleted Scenes (SD, Season 3, Disc 5) V On the 'Colonial Military Assignment Quiz' (fifth disc of Season 3) a hidden deleted scene can be viewed upon completion of the test. It looks like there are seven scenes in total.

- Movie Razor is included.
- Does not have Face of the Enemy webisodes.
The 25 DVDs in this set are the same DVDs available in the 6 season sets (1, 2.0, 2.5, 3, 4.0, 4.5).

HD Bonus Content: Any Exclusive Goodies in There?
h U-Control: The Oracle V Most, if not all, of the episodes (including the miniseries and Razor) come with this interactive guide to characters, starships, the twelve colonies, and more.
h U-Control: Picture-in-Picture: Miniseries (Season 1, Disc 1) V This interactive feature is composed of notes and interviews for the making of the miniseries. It's the same one found on the previously released HD DVD.
h U-Control: Battlestar Blips (Season 3, All Discs) V An optional viewing mode with a pop-up trivia and factoid track. This feature is a Season 3 exclusive.
h U-Control: Battlestar Actual (Season 4, All Discs) V When activated, this viewing mode displays a pop-up guide to the terminology used in the show. This feature is a Season 4.0 and 4.5 exclusive.
h U-Control: What the Frak Happened to You? (Season 4.5, Disc 3) V Another picture-in-picture track similar to the one for the miniseries. This one is exclusive to the series finale - 'Daybreak: Extended Version.'
h Are You a Cylon? (HD, Season 1, Disc 4) V Take this interactive quiz to see if you are human or a Cylon. It looks like I may be a sleeper toaster that hasn't been activated yet.
h Battlestar Galactica Career Assignment Quiz (HD, Season 2, Disc 5) V An interactive quiz to see what your job would be in the Galactica universe. I've been assigned XO.
h Colonial Military Assignment Quiz (HD, Season 3, Disc 5) V Another interactive quiz to determine what your rank would be in the Colonial fleet. I'm a Lieutenant (that's what I get for being a little rusty on the trivia questions).
h Battlestar Galactica: Ultimate Battle (Season 4.0, Disc 1) V A BD-Live card game. I was expecting a poker-style game like the one from the show, but it's actually more along the lines of a collectible card game. I couldn't get it to work for me, though. The game can be found on the first disc of both 4.0 and 4.5 half-seasons.
h The Musicians Behind Daybreak (SD, Season 4.5, Disc 3, 31 minutes) V In this documentary, composer Bear McCreary gives viewers an inside look at the creation of the music for the series finale.
h Exclusive Deleted Scenes (SD, Season 4.0, Discs 1 & 2, 23 minutes) V Just in case you haven't had enough deleted scenes, there are a few more exclusive to this Blu-ray from the following episodes: 'Six of One,' 'Guess What's Coming to Dinner,' 'The Hub,' and 'Revelations.'
h My Scenes V Bookmark and save clips of favorite scenes and send them to your friends.
h BD-Live Download Center V Lastly, the disc is BD-Live enabled. The area has the usual option to register and a collection of previews, and as of this writing theres also the Battlestar Galactica: Ultimate Battle card game. I was expecting a poker-style game like the one from the show, but it's actually more along the lines of a collectible card game with Cylons vs. humans. I couldn't get it to work for me, though. The game can be found on the first disc of both 4.0 and 4.5 half-seasons.
The Cutting Room Floor: What Didn't Make the Blu-ray?
While the extensive supplemental package is more than enough to make any 'Battlestar Galactica' fan run circles around the room giddy with glee, there are few items noticeably absent from this Blu-ray collection:
h Battlestar Galactica: The Lowdown (40 minutes) V The featurette originally included on the miniseries DVD release isn't included in this set. However, parts of it have been incorporated into the U-Control features so technically it isn't really a total loss.
h Battlestar Galactica: The Series - The Lowdown (20 minutes) V This ""making of"" featurette included on the Season One DVD is also absent, although like the previous featurette, some of this seems to be recycled into the interactive content.
h The Making of Battlestar Galactica: Razor V This behind-the-scenes featurette for the 'Razor' special was included on a bonus disc as a Best Buy exclusive for the DVD release. Too bad that it isn't part of this set.
h 'The Face of the Enemy' Webisodes V A series of ten webisodes 'The Face of the Enemy' is MIA from this set. It's disappointing that Universal couldn't find the room for these segments, but hopefully they will be available at some point perhaps as a download via BD-Live or part of the upcoming movie 'Battlestar Galactica: The Plan.'
Easter Eggs
There are a few Easter eggs reported so far in this set:
h Sharon Audio Quote (Season 2, Disc 5) V On the setup menu, highlight the French option and press RIGHT to hear this audio quote.
h Hidden Deleted Scenes (SD, Season 3, Disc 5) V Technically this might not be considered an egg, but on the 'Colonial Military Assignment Quiz' (fifth disc of Season 3) a hidden deleted scene can be viewed upon completion of the test. It looks like there are seven scenes in total.
h Music Editing Clip (SD, Season 4.5, Disc 1, 2 minutes) V On the setup menu, highlight the ""Evolution of a Clue"" option and press RIGHT to access this short featurette.

3431884,5,B001993Y2C,"After hearing all the gripe about packaging, I explored the UK Blu-ray version.  Including shipping I paid only $152 (152 dollars).  Also, the UK page has incorrect details about the region.  The UK Blu-ray WILL PLAY on a US Blu-ray player; mine is actually a PS3 and it plays perfectly.  So save yourself $40+ bucks and get the better packaging, unless you really, really want the toy.

P.S.  For some reason the UK page shows it for 101.88 but when you check out it's really 86.71. Maybe it's a glitch, but it's true!  Shipping to us is only about 3. At this price, I can re-sell on eBay when I'm done watching and break even, if not make a little money.",1263513600,3,656,4.371900826446281
3431885,1,B001993Y2C,"It is a pleasure to finally watch a science fiction series that is willing to portray the kind of future world I want.  Here we have all the minorities represented and playing roles of consequence:  the commander is Hispanic, the president is a woman (authoritative, too!), as is our crack fighter pilot (no pun intended); and, heck, you've got no shortage of blacks and Asians bringing up the rear.  Pleasingly, the chief villain is a blonde -- that hussy!

My problem, though, is that the series totally lacks an Eskimo!  Although, as we all learn in school, the Inupiat of Alaska's Northwest Arctic have played a significant role in American history, an Eskimo character is nowhere to be seen in this film.  What a pity.  I really wonder how these filmmakers can consider themselves progressive in the face of such a troubling omission.",1263513600,9,839,4.825174825174825
3431886,3,B001993Y2C,"Battlestar Galactica is in my opinion, one of the best shows to grace our viewing screens for a very long time. Interesting story lines, compelling characters, splendid effects, out-of-this-world performances by many world class performers and of course, the soundtrack. All of these solid ""A""'s. Then this collection comes out.

I'll admit, the packaging concept is very creative; perhaps even inventive. As a practical matter, it is a disaster. The disk folios are hard to use. It is impossible to gets disks in and out. It is impossible to see which disk you have unless you pull the disk out to look at it. In these regards this collection is a disaster. Perhaps they were more interested in creating a collectible than a user friendly presentation of this show?

I also must speak up about the transferred quality of the episodes. The DVD image quality is at best fair and too often poor. Not to mention, if you hate being forced to watch FBI warnings and copyright notices and previews and long drawn out artistic menu lead-ins, you're going to hate using these disks. Many, not all of them force you to sit through such things.

The disks themselves do not appear to have been mastered for this set. It seems as if they used whatever they did previously and then stuffed them into this package. There is inconsistency in how the different disks are presented.

As to the picture quality, I would have much preferred disk space be used to provide the best possible image quality and less space wasted on ""extras"". While the extras are nice, they are certainly not necessary.

I have not completed watching it yet, so I can't tell you more at this time, but the only problem I have had is, it is very, very difficult to get the disks back into the cheesy cardboard sleeves.

The boxes that the individual seasons come in are flimsy and the folded cardboard that holds the DVDs came apart for two of the seasons.  Getting individual DVDs out of the box is quite difficult unless you don't care about getting fingerprints all over the DVD. There is no documentation whatsoever.  Not even a Episode guide.  You have to load each DVD to see what is on it.

And, as far as the Cylon figure, several joints don't move at all so it won't stand.  I guess mine is a dead Cylon.

I am half way through season one and could complain about the non bluray type grain on certain scenes and perhaps the lack of extended versions that could have been added to get away from the tv like fade ins and outs (more movie like presentation) but I'm not. Form the very first second of the pilot I was drawn into this story both sonically and visually, this series is the bench mark for all sci fi/drama, Star Trek 2009 being the other. The bluray adds the imperfections of an ageing Galactica, its almost aircraft carrier look, the battle scenes loose their cramped tv like feel and most importantly Caprica 6 is perhaps the most beautiful/sexy bad guy ever.

Flimsy and seemingly bad housing for the DVDs.  And NO episode guide?!  Looks aside, its terrible packaging.

BUT, then I saw the UK version of the box set and frankly it looks a THOUSAND times better.  Much more space efficient and packaging conscious and from the photos it looks like it has a booklet etc. This leads me to believe that the UK import is the way to go, my only concern was whether or not it would play on a fairly new American DVD player.

3431896,5,B001993Y2C,"I think enough has been said about the packaging so I am going to move on to the show itself since it is what makes the packaging of any value at all. I watched BSG from the beginning on SciFi. Although the show was only ""four"" seasons it took years to see the whole thing on television. The show took the dark premise (the destruction of human civilization)of the original series and kept that tone throughout the series as opposed to the original series which used the premise as a jumping off point for galactic adventures in the vein of Star Trek. The show was very different  in the way it developed its characters. BSG characters were flawed, tragic,and more Shakespearian than the noble characterizations in series past. There will be times you despise ""the good guys"" and sympathizing with ""the bad guys"".
The series had many controversial story arcs that forced you to really think about some of the issues of the day. **Spoiler Alert** For me, the most memorable story arc was the Cylon occupation of the new human homeworld. Although, the creators said it was based on the Nazi occupation of France it did speak to the war in Iraq. It reminded me of the science fiction of 1970's that spoke to issues like Vietnam and it was something I haven't see very often in science fiction television.
The DVD extras really help you get into the creators' head on how the show evolved. I like listening to Ronald D Moore podcasts and the little gaffes where you can hear the phone in his house ringing, the neighbor's gardeners or his kids yelling. It reminds of listening to the podcasts when they first came out. There are lot of deleted scenes you can watch to get even more of the story.
The picture quality improves as the series progresses and there are many shots that will make your jaw drop and the sound mix is great.

BSG is one of my favorite televisions series of all time and the Blu-ray really does it justice.",1260230400,,1925,4.544668587896253

Knowing what happens next (and Finally) makes the plot even more exquisite.  This set is a MUST-HAVE for any one who has journeyed with BSG!",1260057600,,410,4.746478873239437
3431898,5,B001993Y2C,"I can hardly recall why I started watching this show, but what a great decision that was. It is the most intriguing, smart, rewarding series that I have ever seen. I rented each disc of each season before purchasing. It is a rare show which pays off so handsomely in the finale. It is a journey to the end, but it is worth it. Like Seinfeld, the show decided to end--it was not forced to do so. As such, it ends deliberately and with satisfying closure (though the rumor is that there is more to follow).

Much has been made of the box in which the discs are contained. Truly, it leaves much to be desired. There is a good amount of seemingly wasted volume at the center of the box, which serves only to add bulk. The discs are protected with nothing more than thin cardboard. However, with 20 discs to be enjoyed, I was never going to leave the discs in this box to begin with. A cheap, vacant cd holder works just fine. What's more, one of the purported benefits of blu-ray is the scratch-resistant coating. The decision not to utilize the native sleeves had more to do with convenience than fear of damage. As attractive as the overall package may be from the outside (that is, before noticing the scant protection), I did not purchase the Battlestar Galactica series for the box. I purchased it for the content. You should, too.

My recommendation to you is to make a decision to experience the series. If the unfortunate packaging keeps the cost low, this is a good thing. Indeed, Universal appears to be planning a season-by-season blu-ray release. The cost of purchasing all seasons individually would multiply the cost of the collection. Also, watch the price. I purchased for less than $180, and there was no indication that this was part of any sale (and this was not through a third party seller). In other words, keep it in your wish list and when the price drops, buy it.",1259280000,3,1884,4.505847953216374
3431899,2,B001993Y2C,"Space not the final frontier but the soap opera frontier.  The old Battlestar Galactica was corny and bad acting; at least some people in the new BG are good actors (but definitely not most).  But the writers are terrible, couldn't you have been more imaginative and not reused plots or themes from the original crummy series?  Women in high heels and short tight skirts in space?  A supposedly smart woman gets breast cancer because she never got mammograms?  Not very smart and very soap operatic.  She also wore high heels and short skirts; she was a really stupid person.  Gimme a break.  Lots of talk, over the top acting or really bad acting (like the woman who played Kara).  The action scenes were repetitive, but then again when you're stuck on a group of crummy space ships and hardly land anywhere, there's little room for imagination.",1259107200,,846,4.739726027397261
3431900,5,B001993Y2C,"Ok, I am going to gush about Battlestar Galactica because I believe that is was the best show written for television, hands down.  I can't believe that we got the priviledge of watching this on free tv (sci-fi network or now know as syfy).  Well, not so much free as nothing is cheap about cable companies these days.  Anyway.. the packaging, as people say, could have been much much better. They should have given us options on the packaging because most people, like myself, just really only care about the DVD and I would have like to have seen it in traditional dvd packagaing.  But the DVDs were hard to get to and you can't see what disc is what unless you physically remove it from it's package.  Enough about the package, on to the show.

Ok, the mini-series, first 4 episodes looks grainy and people say it is on purpose.  I own the first season on HD-DVD as well as Standard Def and I don't see anything that makes it look any better in blu-ray.  I figure that because it was release so long ago maybe they use inferior cameras to film it and the whole HD and Blu ray craze hadn't kicked into full gear until after the miniseries.  But starting with the episodes 33 1/3 until season ending, everything looks and sounds great.  The clarity is great and the sound is fantastic.  Plus on blu-ray you have U-Control and for a fan, its cool to watch the series with that on and you get to see interviews with the cast, crew and writers.  So the blu ray is packed with TONS of bonus features.

What is missing in the description of this box set is that fact that RAZOR IS INCLUDED!  It's in the fourth box set i think, also the WEBISODES are included also.  So you get the complete package and you don't have to purchase anything further (except the Plan with came out much later).  Not included in this is Caprica but that is a completely different series-to-be.

As far as the series, it is the best writing, with wonderful acting by all.  Edward James Olmos is great as Adama and gives the series validity because of his past work as an actor and you have 2x Oscar nominated Mary McDonnell as the president. But it is the newcombers that makes the series work.  (I am only going to name characters here), Starbuck, Apollo, Dee, Chief, Gauis, Gaeta, Six, Boomer, etc... where did these people come from.  They are amazing and I was initially upset that the previous show was changed so much.  But what they did is what convinced me that I was watching something special. One thing I must say for sure.  You must watch this series from episode one through the end.  Its not an independent episode type of show.  It is one long engrossing story that is unfolds like a great book.  Be forewarned also, once you start to watch you may have a tendency to watch the show back to back to back.  This is story first, sci-fi second.

For me, BSG (Battlestar Galactica) Blu-ray DVD is a multi-viewable, meaning you will find yourself watching the series over again on blu-ray and still be fascinated about it all.  Unfortunately I bought it during the pre-sale and it was more for me than the current $200.00 and change price tag. This would make a fantastic gift for people you know who were fans of the show and who has a blu-ray player.  And it is so complete, I can't stress that enough.  Not even the standard def DVDs have the webisodes.  Plus you have somewhere in the neiborhood of Season 1, Season 2.0, Season 2.5, Season 3, Season 4.0 and Season 4.5 to purchase, plus you have to purchase Razor.  You get it all in one package with this set.  Buy it if you are a fan and buy it for fans or for someone who you think will really like this show.",1258588800,2,3649,4.382440476190476

3431902,2,B001993Y2C,"This set contains all the seasons of BSG and including the movie Razor, but not Caprica or The Plan. I thought that the inclusion of Razor was a nice bonus, since I only thought the regular episodes were included.  The box is quite large and overly done.  The top of the box lifts up exposing the central core of character photos, kinda like your opening a futuristic computer core. There is the plastic Centurion action figure on top, it's average quality and can barely stand up on its own. The bottom part of the box is quite drab as the colorful cardstock piece falls off once the plastic wrap is removed.  The blue blu-ray band and red dress of Caprica actually gives a nice contrast. The episodes are contained in four containers one on each side of the box's perimeter.

My main problem was with the containers for the episodes.  The blu-ray discs are are staggered in a flip top like holder.  I could barely get them out, at first I thought that the packaging was damaged as the cheap cardstock that holds them in place seemed smashed, but realized that they were all that way.  The flip top lid is also held in place by an odd ""rubber velcro"" with is hard to secure in place.  It all felt very cheap and unfortunately I didn't feel that I could store them safely on a shelf without the elaborate box.  I ended up returning it for the reason of being unable to easily access the discs and the fear of scratching them since you almost need some needle nose pliers to remove them.

3431903,3,B001993Y2C,"Luckily I caught the series on sale much cheaper than the Amazon price. I would not have paid the higher price knowing I would have to repackage the set into proper DVD cases and throw away the junk packaging. It was easy to search out the BD contents on the web and piece together my own booklet containing the contents of each disc. It just took a bit of time.

The gritty grain however is just plain annoying. Very dissapointing to ""dumb down"" my HDTV settings so the grain isn't overwhelming. Many scenes I was looking forward to viewing in spectactular HD were so grainy and pixelated that it detracted from the viewing experience. Ron Moore in his comments actually states that he didn't get the chance to watch much of the HD version and his statement about how now we get to watch the show as it was actually meant to be seen doesn't sound convincing.

On a positive note the space battles were some of the best I've ever seen in Sci-fi tv unlike many shows and movies that cram so much action and confusion into the scenes that you can't figure out what is going on.",1257465600,3,1075,4.396984924623116
3431904,4,B001993Y2C,"I remembered how awful the original Battlestar Galactica series was and really had no interest in viewing the new series when it aired.  Oh, the original series had a great concept, but atrocious acting, horrible scripts, completely inane and laughable dialogue, along with amateurish special effects (or should I say one cheap special effect repeated ad nauseum) sunk it for me very early on.  And the only reason I tried out this new series (via Netflix) was because of all the positive reviews.  Then again, the original series also got plenty of positive reviews ... which I find impossible to even comprehend.

Let's start off with the good.  The acting ranges from decent to excellent (mostly excellent, especially James Olmos).  The special effects are indeed movie-worthy, the concept (obviously taken from the original, which I thought very highly of) has been refined and improved, while the scripts and dialogue are generally quite good, even thought provoking.  I guess the most important thing is, this series throws many curves and sometimes shocks (at least I was shocked more than once ... and I do mean shocked!).  It's certainly a far cry from the silly, cliche-ridden original, thank God.  I also liked how the new series paid homage to the original by showing the older cylon robots in a few episodes.  It cracked me up when I heard them say, ""By your command"".

Now the bad.  Normally, I feel a series can sustain high quality for about 2 or 3 seasons before it begins to melt into milk toast, so I wasn't surprised that this 4-year run had several episodes that were fairly mundane ... and a few that were simply weak throw-ins.  There were several times I thought I was viewing a soap opera, so it began grating on me.  I'm far from being a prude, but I began to tire of all the sex, and to the point that it simply bored me.  But the worst part of this series ended up being the Lee Adama character.  I felt it was the weakest writing in the series ... here we have a ""hero?"" that is an insufferable whiner that probably should have been thrown out the airlock before the second season.

While all that does sound pretty bad, the quality episodes (and that is most of the episodes) far outweigh these negatives.  This is an impressive series with some rich characters and brilliant ideas.  For science-fiction (usually considered non-science, just dumb fiction), Battlestar Galactica breaks new ground, especially for television.  And while I think the short-lived series, FIREFLY, was one of the best that this genre has to offer, in many ways I feel that Battlestar surpasses it (although FIREFLY was a heck of a lot more fun ... it had some really excellent and witty writing, and is still my favorite).

I bought the blu-ray version, so I feel I also need to rate the video and audio quality as well.  I watched this on a Samsung 40-inch LCD with an Oppo blu-ray player.  My sound system is only a 2.1 system, but high quality (a Zvox 550).  That said, here are my impressions:

Video:  Between 1 and 10, I give it a marginal 7 (barely 3-1/2 stars).  Generally, I thought the video was very good, but it does get far too grainy at times.  I understand the feeling the director wanted to convey, but this is not a series to show off stunning blu-ray quality (although there are certainly scenes that are pristine).

Audio:  Between 1 and 10, I give it a marginal 9 (or 5 stars).  Mostly excellent, especially the powerful drum work (while I certainly liked the entire score, I felt the drum beat was supremely effective in the scenes that used it, and added greatly to the suspense of the moment).  The music and sound effects resonated and helped immerse me into each scene, and some scenes, like the creaking of the ship as well as the ""back-breaking"" moment, totally captivated me.

The Series:  Between 1 and 10, I give this series a very solid 8 (or a high 4-star rating).  The difference between this new series and the original is like a clear, sparkling stream versus a mud puddle littered with trash.  Had the series not meandered around in several episodes, I would have gladly given it a 9 or higher (or a 5-star rating).  As it stands, I still consider this a must-see series for sci-fi fans.  I have to say that this series surprised me so much that I stopped renting after the first season and purchased the entire series.

One more note.  About the packaging.  If one thing is consistent in all these reviews, it is the complaints about the packaging.  For me, it didn't bother me.  I simply threw away the big cardboard construct and have the individual season packages on my shelf.  And while it is a bit difficult getting some of the dvds to slide out, and I would have preferred protective sleeves, it really is a non-issue for me.  What is an issue is not having a booklet that describes what is on each dvd.  It's hard to understand why this was MIA.",1257379200,3,4898,4.60392609699769
3431905,3,B001993Y2C,"The show, Battlestar Galactica, will go down in history as an incredible phenomenon that inspired a new generation to love science fiction and the word ""frak"". I can say nothing bad about the series, I LOVED Battlestar Galactica and I cannot wait to watch the episodes over and over.

****Note: I purchased ""Battlestar Galactica: The Complete Series"" from FYE.com, but it is the same product. I did have one issue with my FYE order- the fourth season was missing one of the discs. I hope that was a one-time occurrence and would not be an issue to anyone who buys this. I returned the product and decided to purchase the seasons separately here on Amazon, instead.

My one issue resides with the packaging. It is poorly designed, so you will have problems finding proper placement in your media area for it. The package would appear to have a lid, but it is not really a lid. You cannot actually remove it; you can only slide it up, just enough to extract one of the season packages. The individual seasons are exactly that. The seasons are in poorly made cardboard cases, which house the dvds and nothing else. There are no episode guides (which was VERY FOOLISH, considering most people probably do not know which disk will have which of their favorite episodes, etc.), and like I've already said, the packaging is poorly designed. The Complete Series does come with one interesting item: the Centurion Cylon figurine (which, I must say, is difficult to remove from the plastic packaging on the top of the box) which didn't seem worth the purchase, but was interesting to look at.

I hope that those who love Battlestar Galactica or want to watch the show, having never seen it, will buy the dvds, but I would not recommend this product.

This is a series that is shot in HD, and needs to be viewed in HD.  The color is incredible, and the action scenes/effects shots look amazing!  I was fortunate enough to watch all of Season 4 in Digital HD, but the practical effects shots (i.e. when humans are shooting guns, strobe lighting, etc) were very pixelated.  I'm thrilled to finally see the ""clean"" HD presentation of this series.  The writing, acting, directing and music scoring on this show are second to none, and this show has set the bar extremely high for modern sci-fi programming.
The transfers of the episodes look great, and the lengthy extras are also cool.  I've seen a lot of it on the DVD's, but some of the season 4/finale stuff was nice (I especially like the two features on scoring/recording the music for the show).  I mainly bought this for the HD episodes.

The absence of any kind of index for the content really complicates getting at the stuff you'd be interested in seeing (or even having a convenient way to remember where you left off). Menus leave a bit to be desired and the sleeves are a terrible way to store a disc (beyond being unsuitable for protecting the discs' surfaces, it can be difficult to get the discs out of the sleeves).

None of these things are deal breakers, but they are frustrating to the point that I would consider buying seasons individually if I had it to do over again.",1254528000,2,831,4.4183006535947715

Why can't it be packaged in a normal DVD case instead of giant cheap cardboard paper that scratches the CDs every time their taken out and put back in?  Instead of a fancy package to sell the TV show, why not market it based on how well the show is?

--Also, I have not received my ""Katyn Forest"" DVD ordered around 28 August 2009.  Is there a refund policy for not receiving a product?",1253923200,2,415,4.282051282051282
3431915,5,B001993Y2C,"There has been a lot said already about the dreadful packaging for this box set. mostly about the size. It is big, but here are the real problems you should know BEFORE you start watching. I assume like me you will watch the episodes in order. The fist mistake they made was the 4  accordian style boxes that house each season. The discs are so tightly packed, with no expansion room, that you will have no choice but to jam your fingers in, pinch the disc and try to pull it out. This will leave fingerprints on the readable side of the disc. Keep a cloth handy that is used for cleaning eye glasses, and wrap it around your fingers before trying to remove a disc. Check & wipe the disc before playing.

The 2nd mistake was NOT including a slip sheet showing what is on each disc. The back of the box gives 'some' indication, but doesn't say where things are. Therefore - go online and print an episode guide, there are lots available, and make your own notes as you go. I also will assume like me, you would watch any of the extended, unaired episodes rather that the broadcast version. Make note - Season 2, disc 2 ends with ""Pegasus"" - don't watch it like I did, because disc 3 starts with the extended unaired version of ""Pegasus"" and you won't know this from the packaging. Also in Season 3, disc 2 ends with ""Unfinished Business"" - don't watch it because disc 3 opens with the extended unaired version. Finally, Season 4, disc 3, the last one - the menu shows 3 'episodes' - 1st- Daybreak part 1, 2nd-Daybreak parts 2&3, and 3rd-Daybreak extended unaired. Maybe I'm a dolt, but it appeared to me the extended unaired covered parts 2&3 - so I watched the broadcast version of part 1, then chose the extended unaired option for 2&3 - WRONG. That option covers ALL 3 PARTS. So I watched the first part all over again, minutes after just completing it. A few more words on the menu could have better defined the content, or better still, that simple slip sheet explaining what's on each disc.

These mistakes are just plain dumb for a major release such as this. Shame.",1253836800,43,2072,4.4188481675392675

The downside.. if you hit ""play all"" It plays the ""aired"" version, then the ""extended"" version of the same episode. I found this annoying, I would have preferred to have the episodes sequential with an option on which version to watch.

The RDM Battlestar Galactica truly set new standards as well as expectations.  The series has been unprecedented in so many ways, from the quality of directing, filming, sound and acting as well as the recognition, acknowledgment and awards received.  Some of those involved were even guests for a topic of discussion at the United Nations.

The entire series, as RDM notes in a brief introduction, was filmed entirely in HD format.  If anyone watched the series on the old television format, there is so much that one missed, no matter the quality of tele you had.  Watching the Blu-ray version is truly amazing as you will see so much more that previously would not have been seen.  It is literally like watching the entire series on the theatre big screen.

The series is fantastic, as anyone will tell you. However the blu ray edition is absolutely horrid. As most of the other reviewers have already noted the packaging is possibly the worst I have ever seen for any product I have ever encountered (especially disc based media).

As far as the blu rays themselves are concerned, the High def is really not that impressive. The series was shot in high def but was intentionally made fuzzy and even blurry to achieve the look the producers wanted. The high definition transfer retains the original look and it literally doesnt add anything to view it in HD, and even may be a detriment.

When you get to season 3 and 4 there are some episodes that leave you with such a great feeling and others that are more forgettable.  It's just like the stock market, it goes up and down consistently.  I may have likes 4 episodes in a row than maybe disliked 2 and so on.  Just because I didn't like a certain episode doesn't mean it was bad, it just went off course.  I see a lot of complaints about season 3 and 4 and that is simply because if you don't like the direction season 3 and 4 go than you simple won't like those seasons.  In my opinion season 1 and 2 would be gold, 3 is silver and 4 would be a bronze.  It still throws every curve ball at you and the acting is excellent and get to be the best in season 3 and 4.

3431935,4,B001993Y2C,"Battlestar is a show that stepped up the quality of depth and storytelling in science fiction beyond what has been done before.  The show was gritty, realistic, and the characters were largely complex and unique individuals.  The show caught on very quickly for these reasons, which garnered it a lot of critical acclaim.  One of the factors that made it so popular was its use of modern political and social issues being directly relevant to the story.  Not since the original star trek were so many prevalent issues handled so directly and so well.  Given the great writing, acting, and effects, the show is called great with good reason.

The show chose to end in its fourth season, as it is alleged they wanted to end on a high note, and did not want the show to go on beyond its prime.  While the show as a whole was great, there were some flaws which keep it from being perfect.  For instance, the show provided the audience with a series of questions which were supposed to be answered but never were.  For instance, what was it that triggered all of the four (4) cylons at the end of season three to be pulled to one place, and what triggered them hearing the song?  No answer is given.  Also, why is that tigh and ellen, as cylons, continued to admittedly age, as addressed with adama, though the other final five (5) cylons remained young?  Who caused the nuclear fallout of the cylon home world.  Why when Starbuck returned did she have a brand new ship that showed the way to earth.  The list goes on and on.

Possibly knowing all of these questions couldn't be answered in the final season, including how Starbuck returned, the answer that was given to us was trust in God, though he apparently doesn't like being called that.  While this adds an air of mystery to the show, it also feels a little like a cheap way to wrap up the series but pretend the questions can all be answered.  What about the relics that transported everyone to earth for a brief moment? God.  Why did the star collapse at the exact moment they were at some other relics that showed the way to earth? God.

Though there is a lot unsaid, with some new mysteries added at the last minute, the show was still very good and worthy of being in anyone's collection.  The Blu Ray is great, though the packaging is overly large, and the discs being kept in cardboard seems like an odd choice.  Luckily there are plenty of special features beyond the episodes to watch (though I do not understand why all the webisodes were not included).

3431945,3,B001993Y2C,"Battlestar Galactica is a great series!

Since this is a fairly new series, and after reading that the entire series was filmed in high definition, I was expecting a really clear sharp picture and great audio. I was imediatly disapointed when I began watching the first disc. The picture quality is not good. It is grainny and the colors are less than brilliant. Others have justified this by saying that the series was shot this way on purpose and that the poor film quality was an artistic expression. Whatever the reason, it is so grainy and dim that is slightly distracting. I have season three on DVD and have compared the two formats. The DVD is definetly less sharp which masks some of the grain. I am not really sure which format I prefer, not a big difference.

The packaging is another issue. At first I thought the box looked cool but after a few days I decided it was just too big. It wastes a lot of space on the shelf. In fact it partialy hangs off the front of my bookcase. It is at least five times bigger than it needs to be. There are Four individual boxes, each containing a season. I thought about throwing away the big box and just displaying the four smaller ones on the shelf. The big box is sturdy and well put together but the small boxes are cheap and crappy. Its hard to get the discs in and out of the cardboard sleeves. It seems inevitable that the discs will begin to get scratched over time and with repeated uses.

The discs are not labeled so searching for an individual episode could take a while. ""Caprica"" is not include, nor are the webisodes.

On the good side, the audio is very good. The Blu-ray discs have more episodes than the DVDs which means less changing disks. ""Razor"" is included. It is nice to have the whole series all together, especially since I did not previously own all of them. You also get a toy Cylon figure which is only cool if you wanted it. I would preferred to let them keep the figure and knock ten dollars off the price.

In conclusion I would recomend that you buy this set if you are a Battlestar Galactica fan and if you don't already own it on DVD.

3431957,5,B001993Y2C,"This show is excellent.  I am brand new to it.  I bought the Blu-Ray set based on recommendations and curiosity.  My wife and I have watched the first disc and we were not disappointed.  The show is quite addictive.  One ends, and even though we risk staying up too late we find it hard to resist watching the next episode.  Good stuff!

I have seen complaints about the packaging.  Yes, I feel they should have provided standard blu-ray cases (ones that can hold enough discs for each season). After all, the cost of this set is quite a premium price.  The main box is also too big to put on a DVD/Blu-Ray shelf.  This is not a problem for me since I put all the discs in a jukebox type holder anyway, and the box will just go into storage.

Some have complained about the cardboard disc holders.  Mine are fine.  They will not scratch the discs!  Blu-Rays have a strong protective coating.  The discs are easy to remove and put back.  I really don't see a problem with the cardboard disc holders other than they are not preferable Blu-Ray cases.

Don't let packaging complaints prevent you from this great series.  Right now this is the only way to get them all on Blu-Ray.  Highly recommended.",1250208000,9,1196,4.453703703703703

For one thing, I have been watching DVDs of one type or another for 8 years and the only ones that had a problem playing back had a gouge or crack that was significant (they were Netflix or some other rental company).  I didn't see any scratches on this set, but even if I did it would be no big deal.  Secondly, this series is amazing and Blu-Ray is the way to go if you have the equipment.

3431959,1,B001993Y2C,"First, let me make clear that my rating and review are for the packaging itself and NOT for the show. I think BSG is an all-time Top Ten -- if not Top Five -- show.

But, the packaging is just awful! As others have commented, the individual boxes holding each season's disc are horrible. In order to remove any disc other than the top/first one, you have to remove all the others above/before it. Otherwise, it's just not going to come out without tearing the packaging or damaging the disc. And, you have to do the same thing to put a disc back, unless it's the top/first one.

I honestly can't believe that this package design was approved.

Unless you're looking to save money by buying the complete series, I strongly urge you to buy each season individually.",1250035200,8,763,4.5144927536231885

The box itself does look rather large and clunky, however the lift-up top is an original idea and it does look quite futuristic, so I can't blame the designers for it.
As for the cardboard sleeves, they are a bit awkward, however the blu-rays are packaged in snugly, and as far as I see there is no way the discs could be scratched or broken inside the box. The only ""risky"" moment is when you try and take the actual discs out of the sleeve.
No episode lists or brochures inside is a definite minus, though - rifling through disc menus looking for the needed episode is no fun.

And the holders for the individual discs are these bent cardboard pieces.  It's really lame.  Not easy to get the discs in and out of the set.  I am really thinking about buying seperate cases to hold the discs since the cardboard sleeves suck so much.  Universal should be ashamed.  Considering how expensive this set is... I expect the cases to hold and PROTECT the discs.  Even if the blu-ray discs have a protective coating... the case should not possibly cause scratches.

I love the show, and the picture and sound quality on these discs are great!  So in conslusion... I love the show, love what is on the discs, but hate the packaging.",1249862400,,857,4.529411764705882

3431963,1,B001993Y2C,"THIS REVIEW PERTAINS TO THE DVD RELEASE ONLY -

The show, as covered quite extensively, is a phenomenal drama that truly touches on humanity's reaction to virtual extermination in a sci-fi setting.  I highly recommend the TV show.

However, the packaging for this release is abyssmal at best.  Everything that you have already read, from the stacked configuration of the discs that make them difficult to remove to the fact that the discs are free to slide around at will are true.  I ordered one set from Amazon and, to Amazon's credit, it was protected well in its shipping container.  However, the discs were free to slide within Universal's poorly packaged product resulting in several, BADLY scratched discs.

Amazon was happy to oblige with a replacement.  Once again, Amazon did a superb job in ensuring that the product was well protected.  Once again, however, Universal's poor packaging resulted in several scratched discs and one of the cardboard containers had somehow managed to get squashed despite the pristine condition of the box that it arrived in.

Fed up, I asked for a refund and Amazon did not disappoint.  I decided just to get the individual seasons and the extra $20 I paid was well worth getting the entire show in flawless condition.  I highly recommend spending the extra money to buy the individual seasons because this particular packaging, as cool as the concept was, was not remotely practical.  Any DVD packaging that requires the owner to SLIDE their discs out of glossy cardboarding should be rejected immediately.  There are far better ways to package something like this and this CUBE is not one of them.  Shame on Universal for trying to cash in on a superb show with the cheapest, most frustrating packaging ever.

As most of you know this series is by far an excellent show so I'll quickly talk about the Bluray aspect of the show; it is true that the show has ""digital"" noise added to it to give it a rough gritty look which I think gives the show a little extra life- not every show has to be crystal clear, bright vibrant colors devoid of any artifacts.

3431977,1,B001993Y2C,"I was all set to buy the Battlestar Galactica: Complete Series Blu-Ray release, even though the thing is so expensive I was practically going to have to take out a second mortgage on my house to afford it. But for whatever reason, Universal has chosen not to include the Face of the Enemy webisodes on the Blu-Ray or DVD releases of Battlestar Galactica: Series 4.5 or Battlestar Galactica: The Complete Series. Since I want a complete story, not just the parts Universal arbitrarily feels like sharing at the moment, I no longer intend to purchase the set. While this turn of events is actually to my financial advantage, I am disappointed nonetheless, as I was really looking forward to owning this show on Blu-Ray.

I know some would argue that the webisodes are still available online and I can watch them there. While that's true, why should I have to pay hundreds of dollars for a high-def Blu-Ray product that I'm going to watch on a large, flat-screen TV only to have to watch what is a (to some more than others) critical part of the story via a low-def YouTube clip on a tiny computer monitor? That seems to sort of miss the mark...

And to those who would say that the webisodes were not part of the series and therefore Universal isn't required to include them in a Complete Series release, you are technically correct; Universal can still slide by with calling this a ""Complete Series"" without the webisodes, since it includes every episode of the TV series proper. But that doesn't make it a complete story, which is what I'm looking for. Note that a few years ago, when Twin Peaks: Season 1 was released without the pilot movie (which was unavailable due to some really bizarre international licensing issues and not technically part of the first season), the set's packaging and promo materials were up-front about the pilot's absence; Universal has made no such concession, as they clearly want folks to be suckered into buying this without knowing that they are missing what equates to about a full episode's worth of story and some rather critical information about a character (particularly as it relates to actions that character takes later in the series, which some argue seem a bit out-of-character without the context of the webisodes).

So, Universal, thanks for saving me all that money, but maybe next time, instead of using so much of your own money to come up with that ridiculous disc packaging that so many people on here seem to despise, you'll put some of it towards overcoming whatever (I'm guessing) minor obstacles arose that precluded from including the webisodes and giving fans a complete story.

Just sayin'.

(P.S. I've heard rumblings that Universal plans to make the Face of the Enemy webisodes avaible via another means. I remain skeptical since the correct time for them to release this part of the story was with the Complete Series and 4.5 sets, and they've given no concrete evidence that they are really going to do this; if they were too lazy to do it when people were paying hundreds of dollars for a Complete Series set release, why would they do it for anything else? However, if Universal really does find a way to provide those who purchased these sets with Blu-Ray copies of the webisodes, I may change my opinion.)",1249689600,11,3272,4.753521126760563

- Open each season's box from the bottom
- Pull the carboard insert (and discs) out
- Carefully open the cardboard sleeves to remove the disc

Advanced Tip:

- I actually removed all 20 discs and moved them into a more suitable (albeit less pretty) storage unit.  If you have something (like empty jewel cases) that won't scratch the discs, you can store the discs there and keep the box as centerpiece

3431982,1,B001993Y2C,"What was Universal thinking...

The blu-rays may be alright, but I've never seen something that costs so much money packaged so badly.  You get this big ungainly box that won't fit on most shelves, but I'm thinking ""hey, I'll just take the individual season boxes out and store the big outsized box.  But then you discover that you get the dvd's in these cheap cardboard boxes that are in loose sleeves... and there's no booklet of any kind with it. I could live without the booklet except THERE'S NO EPISODE LIST.  ANYWHERE!  What if you want to watch a particular episode.  You'll have to remember or guess what disc it's on... for all four seasons.  And there's no list of extras, either.  Are there extras?  Where are they?  Does anyone know?

I think this is the most negative review I've ever written, but I feel like I've been suckered.  This set costs a lot of money, and to get so cheap on the packaging is just condescending.

3431984,3,B001993Y2C,"This is a GREAT series - perhaps my alltime favorite TV series - and it is nice to have it all in one place.  There are two problems however.  First, the grainy look to the series makes differences between the DVDs (which I also own) and these new Blurays fairly small.  It is really only on the outdoor shots, or on a really big screen that the Blurays distinguish themselves (delete one star). Second, and more significantly, the packaging is terrible (delete another star).  Not sure who thought it was a good idea to include a telescoping box that doesn't fit on most shelves: IT'S NOT!  Further, and this strains credibility, nowhere in the set is there any indication of which episodes are on which discs - beyond deliniating the different seasons. Without disc contents, finding a particular episode with current bluray player load speeds is tedious.  Sure, you can print out your own 'cue cards', but on a $200 set the ommission is significant.",1249430400,5,952,4.739393939393939

As soon as I opened it up I figured I'd toss the big box and keep the four smaller DVD boxes included.  Then I opened them - HORRIBLE.  DVD's are in heavy cardboard sleeves virtually guaranteeing scratches every time you take a DVD out or put it back in.  Oh and there is no list of what extras are included in each set.  I can't believe any studio would release such a horrible design.  Do not buy this set.",1249430400,47,636,4.1735537190082646
3431986,4,B001993Y2C,"I think a lot of people are getting too held up on the box. Yes, it's bulky but it's hardly the first case of a series set that looks cool but a bit hard to fit on the shelf (the ""Family Guy Stewie Head"" and ""Charmed Book of Shadows"" come to mind) and a lot of shows are pretty large in size (West Wing, Sopranos, Gilmore Girls, Stargate). It may be wider but length-wise it's about the same as all six season sets together so it's not a huge push. BSG always stood out so why not a set that does the same?

The disc sets are nicely done with each season in its own seperate holder and nice to have seasons 2 and 4 all together. Yes, it's annoying that Universal couldn't put in a guide but it's hardly a dealbreaker. Simply get a couple dozen inexpensive DVD envelopes, label each with the disc contents and problem solved. When ""The Plan"" comes out, just slide it into its own envelope to fit as well. For those who think that the lack of ""Plan"" and the ""Face of the Enemy"" webisodes is proof that Universal is putting out another set later this year, that's a bit of a leap. Sure, they've double-dipped before (""Razor"" on the 4.0 set) but these things aren't exactly cheap to produce and putting out a second box set would be a bit much. Edward James Olmos has said ""The Plan"" won't be the last BSG movie so likely they'll put out more.

The fact is, it's the content that matters and we get plenty of it. Sure, it'd be nice to have additional bonus stuff like some of those nice Sci-Fi specials or cast interviews but what we get is still terrific. All four seasons with commentaries for every ep, extended eps at several places and more. BSG remains one of the single more brilliant and inventive shows ever created and that alone makes this set worthwhile. The acting, the effects and more, all in pitch perfect picture and sound If you've waited, like I, to get it all together instead of spread out and split among a half dozen boxes, this is the perfect set for you. A bit bulky yes but to get to such genius, it's worth a bit of effort.",1249257600,2,2046,4.25706940874036
3431987,5,B001993Y2C,"This series is superb, and rates up there with other excellent TV dramas such as ""The Tudors"", and the HBO series ""Rome"".

This set includes all four of the aired seasons, including the extended version of the series finale along with two other extended episodes, and the Razor movie in HD 1080p  Blu-ray, and 5.1 HD DTS Master Audio. And it looks great, but don't expect everything to be in sharp focus because this series was often shot in a gritty, grainy manner in order to accentuate the harsh life being portrayed, or in a softer manner when presenting the idyllic, convalescent other-worldly, Cylon environment on board their base ship. The images have more punch,  vibrancy, and richness of color than the DVD, because of the greater range of darks and lights offered on Blu-ray. The scenes seem to sparkle in their detail like a Vermeer. And with the HD sound one hears with a clarity one didn't before. Unaired extended episodes include ""A Disquiet Follows My Soul"", ""Islanded in a Stream of Stars"", and ""Daybreak"".

The only downside here is the labeling which fails to list the contents of the episodes on either the discs or the individual boxes for each season, as well as the awkward packaging which has the discs slotted into sleeves instead of the usual type of solid DVD, Blu-ray holders. The box set is a robust and clever design with the image of the Cylon peeking at us from inside the box. The box isn't as tall as I expected and it fits easily on my bookshelf only a bit higher than my DVDs. The plastic Cylon figure seems to be a bit of an afterthought resting as it does on the top side of the box as if in a sarcophagus.

All in all it's an excellent series which I'm glad to finally see in Blu-ray. Perhaps this series will soon come out in Blu-ray with all of the individual seasons so that one doesn't have to deal with the faulty packaging. And in November the next Battlestar Galactica movie ""The Plan"" will be released so the fun doesn't stop here.

Interesting footnote: the word Cylon comes from the name of an Athenian. Cylon is mentioned in Thucydides' book ""The Peloponnesian War""(the war between Sparta and Athens: 431-404BC). Cylon was an Athenian noble, and victor at the Olympic games who attempted a coup in 632 BC. The coup was thwarted and Cylon and his supporters took refuge in the temple of Athena on the Acropolis. Cylon and his brother got away but many of the others did not. The ""curse of the goddess"" comes about from the killing of the suppliants who had been persuaded to leave the temple believing that they would be unharmed, but they were put to death, some of whom had taken refuge in among the altars of the Dread Goddesses. It was the killers and their families that were accursed and guilty before the goddess of Athena. The Spartans asked the Athenians to drive out the ""curse of the goddess"" meaning to ask the Athenians to stop their aggressive ways so as to detour a war between their people.",1249257600,4,2957,4.559322033898305
3431988,2,B001993Y2C,"This is a review of the Blu-ray release, not the series as a body of work.  We all know that it's incredible.

I bought the series.  I popped it into my Blu-ray player.  I cranked up my HDTV.  Excited much?  You bet.  I had already read a few reviews of the Blu-ray box set online, and everyone was raving about how the series has never looked so good.  I must confess, I am now a double-dipper.  I already own the complete series on DVD.  I am a BIG fan of the show.  And ever since I heard that the series had been shot in HD from its beginning, I have been drooling to see it on Blu-ray. The plan (no pun intended) was to buy the Blu-ray set and trade in my BSG DVDs.  Sadly, in my opinion, the show looks worse on Blu-ray than it does on standard DVD.  Yes, I know:  ""This is how the show was really intended to look.""  I mean, this is a message that has now been drilled into my consciousness.  Ron Moore is on every disc talking about how great the series looks in HD.  Interestingly enough, there is even a message that pops up on each disc that tells (or should I say ""warns?"") the viewer that the Blu-ray represents the show as the creators intended.  They wanted a ""gritty, documentary look.""  If that is true, then why in the world bother shooting the show in HD at all?  I honestly think my BSG DVDs look better than these.  But everywhere I look, everybody is still glowing about how incredible the image is.  I've been back and forth multiple times between DVD and Blu-ray.

Bottom line, were it up to me to do over, I would just enjoy my SD DVDs of the show and skip the Blu-ray release.  I mean, if the image was intentionally designed to look flawed and grainy, then why bother spending a couple hundred bucks to get the best picture of how bad it was intended to look?

I have a huge sense of buyer's remorse ever since this monstrosity arrived at my doorstep.  I mean what is this thing, a diorama?  It's maybe three times bigger than it needs to be and takes up an entire tier on my bookshelf.  Honestly, to whatever team of chimpanzees at Universal came up with this packaging: Number one, you are not fans of the show nor are you by any stretch of the imagination serious collectors of DVDs/BDs.  Number two, what's with the clumsy carousel-esque pop-up top?  Number three, that Cylon figure is lamer than lame and does not smooth over this design calamity.  I'll stop counting now.  Alright, so no extra pocket for the eventual release of The Plan?  Come on people.  Get your heads together and offer alternative packaging on your website for the price of shipping and a proof of purchase.

With themes of humanity taken to a new extreme and deep philosophical explorations of the deepest issues we as humans face and dark character studies played out over the backdrop of the potential extinction of the human race as they flee across the galaxy from their own creations -an AI race known as Cylons- this is a show that fired on all cylinders all the time. It began in 2003 with the epic 3-hour miniseries that packed in more disturbing and racy imagery then any adult science fiction film I've seen while we watched our race get systematically wiped off the face of the galaxy by an AI that has evolved themselves to look like us. Four harrowing seasons followed that pushed the limits of what is allowed on television and continuously expanded in width and depth. The made-for TV film ""Razor"" brought us back in time following season 3 to explore concurrent events to the first season from the experiences of one of season 2's villains, a mad battlestar commander who made some inhuman choices in the name of survival, and even back to the first Cylon War . All of this and a large amount of extras are included in the Complete Series set.

So, political issues. BSG tackled humane treatment of prisoners, the extreme flimsiness of our electoral process (both from our ability to vote with a clear head and the simplicity of skewing the results), unions, terrorism, genocide, human rights from all over, the significance of religion -both positive and negative- in society, holding leaders accountable for their deeds, torture, and all of the other things we pretend wouldn't matter in a survival situation, but are wrong. And most of all, this show is about humanity. Early on we are asked why humanity is even worth saving. A glimpse at our history books will make that a hard question to answer truthfully. But what really pushes this show into the stratosphere in the later episodes is the fact that the formerly mechanical race whose goal was to replace mankind begin to become us instead and seem to not even know why they want to kill us anymore. After all, there is nothing more human then meaningless war. Then they've got to question what makes them any better. BSG never rested o it's laurels, it was always pushing forward, opening up new questions and debates, and offering the characters choices where there simply was no correct answer. Our world is a world of wrong, and when you are on the verge of extinction, it is even more so. The options offered to our heroes are few and terrible and we do not get spared the consequences. When the Secretary of Education becomes President after the 40+ cabinet members ahead of her in the line of succession all perish in the attack she is promptly forced to decide whether or not to abandon thousands of lives to save the rest of the fleet. She makes the ""right"" call, but we are still forced to watch as a little girl we met earlier on one of the ships left behind sits by herself on a bench, blissfully playing with her doll as the sky lights up behind her and the entire image vanishes in a flash of light. It's all about consequences.

This is quite possibly the best cast ever assembled on television. Edward Jame Olmos is absolutely electric as Commander Adama. To me, this is the most memorable character in sci-fi television history since Captain Kirk himself. Olmos's performance is commanding and nothing short of spectacular, as is his female counterpart Mary McDonnell as President Laura Roslin. The fact that these two didn't clean up at every Emmy wards show in the past 4 years only proves beyond a shadow of a doubt how useless that institution is. Tricia Helfer is the ultimate vampy/trampy object of nerd lust, Katee Sackhoff's cigar-chomping tomboy Starbuck is the most lovable character for the first couple seasons, and there are dozens more unforgettable performances and characters. Every character does good, every character does bad, and every single one of them has believable motives for their actions. The difference between heroes and villains is almost imperceptible at times and the roles are often reversed. This is what adult science fiction should be all about.

I'm trying to keep this shot, but believe me, I could heap praises on this show for days on end. But at this point, I'd like to get back to watching it. BSG is something that anybody who enjoys riveting and thought-provoking television NEEDS to see. You will learn more about politics then a lifetime of cable news and talk radio, you will learn more about what makes us human then a degree in psychology or anthropology, you'll learn more about the real role faith plays in our lives then if you attended every sermon in every church on every Sunday for a lifetime, and you will have a great time doing it. Even if you aren't into science fiction, if you give this show a try you will love it. It's that universal and it's just that good.",1249084800,7,5838,5.302375809935205
3431993,4,B001993Y2C,"Battlestar Galactica (2004) is probably the best Television show the Sci-Fi channel has ever produced. It's got great special effects, convincing performances, a non-stop feeling of suspense (not always action-packed), and at least some thought-provoking and socially relevant ideas put into every episode. It wasn't perfect especially with some major social issues (like abortion) given too convenient resolutions and some unconvincing characterizations and relationships (I don't care what anyone says: Apollo and Dualla have ZERO chemistry) but overall it sets the bar pretty high for science fiction storytelling.

In this collection there is every single episode of the series plus the original mini-series, Razor (uncut), and extended episodes (including 25 minutes added to my favorite episode ""Unfinished Business""). So pretty much everything you got in the original boxed sets if you bought them individually. If you've got the show collected up to this point, you can probably just skip this boxed set and buy season 4.5 without missing out on any extras.

The box the DVD's come in is HUGE. I'm talking at least 12""x12""x12"". Personally I was hoping for something ALOT more compact. Also the discs are sleeved in individual pouches. I'll never understand why ANYONE would do this to their discs other than to save space, but the box itself is needlessly big as it is. I'm glad I got the show in one collection but for the most part the box is a waste of space. I actually just purchased a specialized DVD case and threw away the original Box and DVD sleeves. I would almost recommend just getting the series in individual seasons if the prices are comparable (which I believe one reviewer pointed out).

The video transfer on DVD is also unchanged. Again not a bad thing because the show looked great to begin with, though the original mini-series still looks washed-out compared to everything else. I personally don't think there's any excuse for this considering it's over five years old, but again nothing's different either.

I am overall satisfied with the DVDs in this set and it's still the same great show, but I guess if they were planning a big release with this I would've hoped for some more extras (maybe the webisodes, Caprica pilot?). If you can try opting for the collection without the Cylon action figure which I believe is JUST a box containing the original jewel cases (which I prefer) PLUS the prequal movie: The Plan.",1249084800,,2449,5.024630541871921
3432004,4,B001993Y2C,"The bad news is that I agree with the majority, the packaging stinks.  It stinks in a lot of ways.  I wonder if the discs can become damaged over time by the silly sleeve system that they use and the difficulty in getting discs in and out.  The packaging does take up too much room.  Also, there is no way to know what is on each disc.

The good news is that the Blu-Ray looks and sounds great.  The first season is reportedly grainy and not as well done as subsequent years.  My observation is that the first year looks and sounds great.  Because I have a hearing loss this series has always contained dialog that has been difficult for me to hear.  The Blu-Ray discs are easier and clearer for me then the original series was to hear, at least to my ears.

This would have been a 5-star rating but for the packaging.  I would much rather have had packaging similar to that used in the Star Trek Boxed Set for Star Trek 1-6.  Those thin boxes were a bit skimpy, but were a far better option then what came with this set.",1249084800,,1021,4.17948717948718
3432005,4,B001993Y2C,"Amazing show.  I've only seen the first season, and have only watched the first disc of season 1 since I got this box set today, but I knew I had to buy this to see all of the episodes.

I'll agree for the most part with other reviewers about the box.  However, I think the main box is great.  It's the boxes that hold each season I have a slight problem with.  The DVDS slip into very thin cardboard (or thick paper) sleeves, each one offset from each other so the discs stagger upwards.  Good concept, except each time you take them out it slides against the cardboard, causing scratches if theres any sort of dirt or dust in there.  Another VERY MINOR annoyance to me was the very front flap would fold in the improper spot, again, very minor, and hard to describe, but it did it for every season, so I'm sure others have noticed what I'm talking about.  The holders are made from 1 long sheet of paper, folded several times.  Then, when placed in the box, the discs can't leave from the side, so they just sit in there.  The front of the sleeves goes all the way to the bottom of the box and the back flaps do not.  This weight causes the front flap to be pulled down and re-fold at a different spot.  Again, this sounds minor, but it is very noticeable to me.

The following couple of paragraphs go into detail of the fixes I had, if you don't own the boxset, It will be difficult to know what I'm talking about because you need to understand how the discs are held (its hard to explain.....)

However, I have made fixes for both of these.  For the first problem, I took an old DVD carrying case that I no longer used and cut off the plastic covering, leaving only the soft material used for the back.  I cut out 25 of these (1 for each disc) and taped one to where the disc would sit (I took out the cardboard slips of course).  The size I cut makes it so you can't see the white (in my case) soft material that protects the back of the disc when all of the discs are in, and you can see a tiny bit of each one when the disc is absent.  This makes it look nicer/normal in the case, however it doesn't protect the very top of the disc.  I am just careful every time I put a disc in to make sure it gets in front of backing and make sure the backs of the discs don't hit any of the paper of the sleeves.  I'm not sure how much this helps, but figured it couldn't hurt.

NOTE:  I taped it with Scotch tape, folded it on top of itself into thin strips so it essentially was double sided tape.  I just did 1 thin long strip across the top.  If it becomes a problem with the bottom not being taped, I'll fix it later, but so far it works fine.

For the second problem, I just took duct tape (because its stronger) folded it onto itself, making ""double-sided"" tape, and placed it behind the first flap, near the real fold, and just stuck the 2 pieces (the back of the first disc holder, and the front of the 2nd disc holder) together.  This holds the weight of the rest of the discs/sleeves up and makes it so a new fold cannot be created.

Sorry if this is hard to understand... hopefully  people understand what I'm talking about.... if not, I'm only out about 10-15 minutes.

Anyway, besides these slight annoyances, I really enjoy the case and I like the look of the box.  The cylon figure is kinda cheap, and looks a lot better just sitting in the box than on my shelf.  I am not disappointed at all with my purchase.  Also, I would not decided to not purchase this based on the packaging.  However, it doesn't warrant a purchase if you already own some of the seasons on DVD.",1248998400,,3580,4.149492017416546
3432006,3,B001993Y2C,"I won't belabor this, but there's no way to know what is on each disc.

The packaging I can get around merely by moving the discs to a DVD book. But a year from now, how am I going to find individual episodes I want to watch without an index booklet? Even the discs lack a label telling you what is on the disc.

However, the Blu Ray is sharper than the DVD version.

OK. Now I've finished watching all the discs, here's my final review.

The Blu-Ray results are spotty. In some of the CG space scenes it is fantastic. In some of the gritty realistic scenes it looks like someone is waiving cheese cloth in front of the camera.

But my big problem remains the packaging. After I watched the episode Pegasus, I popped in the next disc and found there was an extended episode on the next disc. So I wasnt' about to immediately watch it again. I'd go back and watch it now, but I have no idea which disc it is on.

Similarly, the episode menu displays four shows with a fifth hidden. I watched a fourth show and then went to the fifth, only to discover again a hidden extended episode. Again, I'd go back to watch it now, but don't know which disc it was on.

So as much as I'd like to raise the review because of how much I like the show, the review stays at a 3.",1248998400,,1261,4.080971659919029
3432007,3,B001993Y2C,"The show has been reviewed before.  It's awesome, enough said.  I'd like to review the horrendous packaging done by the folks at Universal which stresses design over functionality.  This box is beautiful, it really is.  The Cylon figure on top is a huge waste of cash, but it still helps it stand apart from other sets... which it will already do if you place it on your shelf with the rest of your TV shows on DVD.  This sucker sticks out a lot.  I do like the design aspect of lifting the top to access the season sets, but I feel like once I have done so I should be greeted by some cool little slim disc cases like the ones that were used in the standard DVD sets.  Those were so great.  Functional, kept the disc safe, and it had an episode and bonus feature listing on the back.  How thoughtful to let us know what is actually on each of the 20 discs.  This new set?  Not so lucky.  Each season comes packed in a Cylon head.  Again, a cool idea that may have worked with some slim cases inside or, gasp, a steelbook vase to justify the high price tag of the set.  But no, these Clyon heads open from the base with velcro.  Yes, velcro, and open to reveal the discs within which rest loosely again slick cardboard.  Yes, cardboard.  You will more than likely need to remove the entire Cylon head and tip it upside down to get anything out.  And when you do you will get everything out... at least two discs at once.  This is the source of much pain for the viewer.  Some will like this setup and that's great for them, but I couldn't stand it.  I offer a possible solution.  I went to a local store and picked up some CD/DVD sleeves.  Not the cheap paper ones with the clear circular front, but the nicer ones that have slots for a disc on each side and support them with soft, non-scratch material.  I placed each disc in its own little sleeve, which still fits the current box design width-wise, and printed labels on the back of each sleeve that describe, gasp, the contents of the disc.  Yes, in this whopping 200-dollar set Universal included no list of what is actually on each discs.  There are no episode listings, descriptions, or locations listed of bonus content.  Good luck.  There's a great DVD review website out there that I will not advertise for fear of why review being omitted, but the editor there was kind enough to type out these printable inserts for us and offer them free as downloadable files.  Grab them, they're pretty.  So yes, there is some work involved with my storage offering but it works and once you've got your protected, labeled discs in the master case it all works quite well.  Worried about the upcoming 'The Plan' movie making your complete set incomplete?  No worries, pick it up when it's released, slip it into another little disc protector at the back of Season 4 and no worries.  You can even remove the worthless Cylon coffin figure from its perch atop the set and slide your new disc in there if you'd like.  The series is over, it had a final episode.  'The Plan' is a TV movie which is how I am chosing to justify its omission from the set.  would I have liked it to have been included as a reward for those of us who shelled out the cash for the whole thing?  Of course.  But Universal chose not to include it in an obvious effort to helps its individual sales soar so this is what we get.  Aside from my many packaging complaints, and I have so many, the discs themselves are beautiful and the show has never looked or sounded better.  If you're an audio/video nut like me who wants the best possible presentation for the shows he loves, especially if you're going to devote as much time as it takes to watch an entire series' run, this is the way to go.  Universal, lousy packaging aside, knows how to put together an awesome Blu-Ray set which unmatched quality.  For this I do thank them.  Shop around, wait for the price to drop if you can, and rest assured another box set will see the light of day sometime after the upcoming release of 'The Plan'.  It's called double-dipping and most of you already know this business move well.  My hope is that Universal responds to our packaging complaints.  I would love to ship off the useless Cylon head packaging for a nice set of slim disc cases... with labels... and maybe this will be done for us in the future.  However, if you can get past the temporary inconvenience of making the set more accessible it truly is worth it.  I actually feel an odd sense of ownership having modified the packaging on my own... extra-ownery ownership, I suppose.  So there you have it, a possible storage fix.  Spectacular series from start to finish.  Lousy interior packaging.  Two-star reduction for this design snafu, which as it turns out is quite a big deal.",1248998400,,4756,4.401836969001148

I give the set 1 star not for transfer quality (excellent) or any misgivings about the series itself (also excellent) but to make a point about the packaging.

The packaging for this box set is an industrial design major's wet dream, and a collector's nightmare.

I'm someone who likes keeping all my DVDs on a shelf in a neat row. I loved when DVD packing went super-thin. This mess is 1' x 1' and won't fit compactly on a shelf. I assumed I'd be able to take the boxes out and display them separately, throwing out the monster box they came in (that I probably wasted a good 20% of my money on).

While that is possible, the boxes are flimsy cardboard filled with flimsy cardboard sheaths folded in on themselves housing the 4-6 discs inside. These sheaths are already bending under the weight of the discs and distorting the paper boxes. Without a booklet, it's impossible to find the extras - which are the reason I purchased the set - without searching or going on the internet, which shouldn't be a requirement. And without any form of ""housing"", I can already see the discs falling out as I flip between them.

The Cylon - another 10% of my purchase price - is a ridiculous extra that I already have plans for a youtube parody of its ""other uses"". Great for collectors, but for someone who simply wanted a thin, FUNCTIONAL set of all the discs to enjoy the series, I wish there had been a ""non-collectors"" option.

It's too bad there isn't a way to purchase the individual seasons on Blu-Ray or I would be returning this set to buy them separately.",1248825600,31,1759,4.430340557275541

3432029,4,B001993Y2C,"THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE BLU-RAY BOXED SET.

Seasons 1-4 deserve anywhere from 5 to 4 stars depending on the season. The extras deserve 4 stars while the packaging deserves 2 for the bigger box 1 for the cardboard sleeves.

Edit: FYI, this includes the mini-series in addition to ALL the seasons of ""BG"", ""Razor"" is included but ""Caprica"" and ""Face of the Enemy"" webisodes are not.

During its four season run ""Battlestar Galatica"" produced some of the best episodes for ANY television series whether it be a mainstream drama or science fiction. While some fans of the series were disappointed with the conclusion quite a bit was hinted at in previous episodes and it doesn't detract from the quality of the previous ones. The image quality varies from exceptionally good to fair but the show retains the ""look"" the producers wanted; some shots are meant to be not only extremely grainy but also a bit soft so you'll forgive the studio and makers for going with their artistic vision. Either way the image looks terrific but don't expect this to look like a smooth high def show designed to look slick. Detail is sharper regardless of the ""look"" of the show.

Audio sounds terrific throughout with an active 5.1 lossless soundtrack that highlights the level of detail that went into preparing the show.

The extras for seasons one through three are more or less the same as on the original DVDs the only new extra (aside from the new extras for season four which I'll address in a minute)to this set is the BD-Live ""Battlestar Galatica Card Game"". So far there isn't anything else on BD-Live (as of the release date) available but I'd also note that the season one Blu-ray and DVD as part of this boxed set includes the deleted scenes from the first season something missing if I recall correctly from the DVD (I sold mine to upgrade to the Blu-ray so can't look at it).

It appears as if most of the extras are exactly like like the previous sets with one exception the deleted scenes for the first season. I'm going to focus on the extras for the fourth season because most of the special features are ported over from the previous DVD boxed sets. We get extended episodes for ""A Disquiet Follows My Soul"", ""Islands in a Stream of Stars"" and ""Daybreak"" as well as 13 commentary tracks, David Eick's Video Diaries and deleted scenes for the fourth season set. There's also pip's that allow you to watch behind-the-scenes stuff while watching the show as well as an explanation of some of the jargon used by the characters on the show.

The packaging is a bit more problematic. While the big box is sturdy enough and looks extremely nice, the smaller boxes that hold each season set holds the discs in cardboard sleeves. It will increase the chance that these could get scratched and I am disappointed that Universal didn't design this set for a more traditional DVD or Blu-ray holder. The good news is that each season comes in its own compact box and they will stand up with other Blu-ray and DVDs on the shelf. I personally think it is nicer in concept than execution and wish it was designed similar to the UK boxed set coming in September but that's me.

Let's not forget the toy Cylon that's on the top of the cardboard boxed set it looks kind of cool but I haven't opened it to examine yet.

In conclusion there's good and bad with this set with the good outweighing the bad. ""BG"" receives a handsome looking Blu-ray transfer with great sound and some terrific extras. A terrific series where Gaius Balter redeems himself and Cavil proves to be everything we believed him to be from the first introduction of his character.

3432030,4,B001993Y2C,"The complete series box set is a *big* box, not something that will fit easily on a shelf.  The box is quite sturdy, with each season's discs packaged in their own sleeve (four in all).  These sleeves are cardboard with flip up covers; inside, the discs are nested in a folded cardboard separator.

Some have claimed that this set would include the movie ""Caprica"", but it is *not* included.  The 25 DVDs in this set are the same DVDs available in the 6 season sets (1, 2.0, 2.5, 3, 4.0, 4.5).

The series was produced in HD, which means a wide-screen presentation; however, it was deliberately shot with a grainy look to give it a 'gritty' film quality.

Why get this collection instead of the six season sets?  You get a neat Cylon Centurion figurine (and it's good sized!), but no booklet, a huge box, and inferior internal packaging.  I bought the series this way mainly because it was (slightly) cheaper than purchasing the six season sets individually; nevertheless, I'm experiencing a bit of buyer's remorse.",1248739200,360,1015,4.7272727272727275

Has anyone purchased this (FOR BLU-RAY) and can they attest to the picture and audio quality?

I watched it on Sci-Fi (SyFy) HD and enjoyed it but I would say it was 720i, far from paying the extra money for the Blu-Ray version.  I can save $100 and buy it for on DVD for my upconverting player but if it is a true 1080i or 720p version then, for me, it is worth the extra money to by the Blu-Ray version.

3432033,3,B001993Y2C,"Just got my boxset in the mail, paid $137.00 for it. Great packaging and overall sturdiness of the main box. However the individual boxes for each season hold the discs in an awkward fashion. The front cover is a flap that is closed via a little Velcro tab, inside the box the discs are held in slots cut out from a cardboard insert. This insert moves up and down within the box making it annoying to try and pull a disc out let alone put the disc back into its cutout slot. To put the disc back in you have to spread the slot apart with one hand and slide the disc back in with the other otherwise it is quite a pain to stick the disc in. Also when putting the discs back I cant help but feel like i am going to scratch the disc since they are sliding against cardboard.

The Cylon figure is nice, nothing too special. You can pose it, however the plastic feels cheap like it could break. The figure is housed in a plastic sleeve on the top of the main box in a cutout hole. Once you take it out there is a big ugly hole on the top of your box which looks really bad when its empty. The plastic sleeve can be put back into the hole on the top of the box but it still looks hideous. I'll just be leaving the Cylon figure inside the box.

My rating is not for the show, but for the false advertising and obvious eventual double-dipping once Face of the Enemy and the Plan will be released as part of the 'Complete' set in the future.

Battlestar Galactica is, in all honesty, one of the best shows I have ever seen. But this set is not Complete.",1247961600,11,611,4.648148148148148
3432048,5,B001993Y2C,"Fifty years ago, humanity's robotic servant Cylons suddenly turned on their masters. After a nasty war, the Cylons retreated into far space and a tense truce was maintained.

But of course the story doesn't stop -- and it turned out to be a rare case of a remake becoming spectacularly better than the source material. ""Battlestar Galactica - The Complete Series"" is a grimy, dark, violent and ultimately hopeful sci-fi adventure saga that isn't afraid to dip into philosophical and theological matters. And while it has its ups and downs like any series, it's a brilliant and powerful piece of work.

Forty years after the war's end, the Cylons unexpectedly return to the Twelve Colonies and start wiping out ships and cities. The Battlestar Galactica (an aging warship about to be turned into a museum) is forced to flee the world of Caprica with a collection of refugee-crammed ships, under the command of Commander William Adama (Edward James Olmos) and Secretary of Education-turned-President Laura Roslin (Mary McDonnell).

Now the people of the Twelve Colonies must find a new home -- and their new goal is Earth, a legendary planet with other humans on it. Unfortunately, they have been infiltrated by the treacherous scientist Gaius Baltar (James Callis), and a group of Cylons who are almost indistinguishable from human beings -- they even have emotions and can interbreed with humans.

But the journey is the real test: sabotage, assassination attempts, betrayals, shortages of water, food and fuel, the introduction of cruel martial law, religious conflict, the discovery of another surviving Battlestar called the Pegasus, and the overhanging fear of infiltration by the humanoid Cylons. And though they find a habitable (but miserable) planet, soon the ragtag fleet is forced to flee again -- and eventually discover that their goal is not what they hoped...

Anyone expecting ""Battlestar Galactica"" to be a copy of its predecessor is going to be horribly disappointed. This is sci-fi at its most compelling and transcendent -- a gritty, bleak, dark story of war and desperate escapes, and there are plenty of moral dilemmas (Roslin ordering the death of a baby Cylon/human hybrid). And it explores the truly compelling questions about what it is to be human and alive -- and to deserve to be.

And the writers brilliantly wrap together hard SF with threads of mystical science fiction, and undertones of religion and philosophy. The writing is solid and snappy (""Old gods die hard"") and even manages to pull off dramatic and powerful dialogue without being cheesy (""She chose me. Chose me over all men. Chosen to be seduced. Taken by the hand. Guided between the Light and the Dark"").

And each character is given an intricate and complex journey to follow, filled with pain, death, sorrow and slowly moving beyond their own personal problems. Friendships are pulled apart, alliances are formed, and lots of horrible and morally questionable choices are made. Some of these people are redeemed, some are destroyed, and some discover that they are not even human.

Olmos and McDonnell are the powerful leaders in this story, and both actors do a brilliant job -- especially Mcdonnell with Roslin's breast cancer, and Olmos with his tragic past. Other standouts: Callis as the ever-changing Baltar, Michael Hogan as the unlikeable Saul Tigh, and Grace Park as a humanoid Cylon whose love changes her goals.

But the true standouts here are Katee Sackhoff as Kara Thrace (aka ""Starbuck"") and Tricia Helfer as the ethereal humanoid-Cylon Number Six. Both women's fates are intertwined with the search for Earth, and it's fascinating to see how they shape the show. Sackhoff's character in particular comes across as annoyingly more-macho-than-thou at first, but the slow evolution into ""harbinger of death"" and destiny makes her the most compelling of all.

The complete box set is going to apparently include relatively few extras -- it obviously has all the seasons included along with assorted extended episodes, promotional stuff for the prequel spinoff ""Caprica,"" deleted scenes, behind-the-scenes stuff, interviews, and so on and so forth. It also includes the ""Razor"" spinoff and obviously the original miniseries... but NOT apparently the forthcoming ""Plan."" Basically don't bother if you already own the seasons -- and until the price drops, it isn't terribly economical. And expect in a year or two to have the complete ""complete series,"" which will include ""Plan.""

""Battlestar Galactica: The Complete Series"" is a stunning and powerful story that transcends the sci-fi label, and deserves to be praised to the skies. Definitely a must-see.",1247270400,,4663,5.179282868525896

3432052,2,B001993Y2C,"It really shouldn't be surprising that the wheel has turned though.  Back in 79 or 80 when the original Battlestar Galactica ran for one season, it was a hard-nosed sci-fi action series set in the deep of space and aimed at males.  And yes, there were a couple of cheesy episodes, but for the most part the shop was pretty hardcore sci-fi.  (Now, Battlestar Galactica was actually re-done a year or so after the original 79 season with a few of the original case members but set on Earth, that 2nd version of BSG was huge mistake and was absolutely horrendous).  Why do tv shows completely change concepts when they have a successful show? Who knows?  The same thing happened with Buck Rogers, great 1st season, then  the show is completely re-written and, viola! terrible season 2.

As for the newest version of the show (the 3rd version) with Edward James Olmos, in keeping with the new concept of making it primarily a show designed to attract a primarily female audience, the role of Starbuck was re-written as a female character, who surprise! acts just like the male version, (ie: likes to fight, play poker, beat up the male characters, chew cigars etc).  The special effects are very solid, and the ships look pretty believable, the show does exchange the old shows sense of adventure and exploration, for numerous romantic encounters though (you might begin to think you are watching Desperate Housewives).  I do think the show made a big mistake in changing the origin of the Cylons.  The new show has revised their origin, and instead of mankind encountering a machine race out there in the depths of space desiring to eliminate all non-machine life (a pretty cosmic idea), the new show suddenly decides that the Cylons were simply invented by humans!  What a boring idea, how common.  It also doesn't help that they have essentially taken away the alien-ness of the Cylons and instead they have completely humanized them.

At any rate, I found myself, having to fast forward through long swatches of soap opera in this show to get to anything resembling science fiction, and what is the most important thing about sc-fi tv series, (it is not two people going ""how do you feel?, ""No, how do you feel"", or everyone's hormonal urges), great sci-fi is about great ideas, and great visual images.  This show doesn't quite cut it, but, overall, I will give it 2  stars, mainly for the production values and special effects.",1246320000,4,2429,4.763723150357995

  ****************************************

  Friends,

  The wait is over, UPS delivered my boxed set a few hours ago.  The first thing I looked for was, ""Caprica"" which was supposed to be included.  Well, apparently they decided at some
point to NOT include it.  There is NO excuse for this GLARING FRACKING omission.
  The individual season boxes are just as reviewed by someone else.  You cant take a disc out without getting a finger-print on the edge of the data surface, which means an immediate
wipe with a disc-safe cloth.  I'd have been happy with this type of packaging if they'd lined the sleeves with velvet, or at least felt.
  As to the BIG box... it's... attractive I suppose.  I'll have to put the geekoid in me to bed for awhile at some point and clean up a place on my video-shelves to store this thing.  Yeah,
RIGHT!!!  As to the CYLON CENTURION FIGURE that comes looking like it's in hibernation on the top of the box... best to just leave it.  I had to man-handle it out, and I was NOT impressed.  This
thing would sell for about [...] at a dime-store, and that would be pushing it.  The plastic seems to be a bit... rubbery.  The figures long slender fingers FLEX a LOT, which is good because that will keep them from breaking too quickly.  Keep your kids away from this thing.
  I'm now beginning to watch the first season, after having just finished the original mini-series.  I thought I'd check on the status of, ""Caprica"" and you already know about that.
I'm sure that what we do have here, will be what we wanted from it.  But it looks like, ""Caprica"" will constitute ANOTHER expenditure.

3432061,2,B001993Y2C,"Many viewers have sung the praises of the remade BSG for years.  They love the intensity of the performances, and the Byzantine plot twists of this series.  The 1978 version, while visually dazzling, was expanded into a series from a TV movie at the last minute.  Consequently, it failed to offer well-written stories. Obviously there was room for improvement.  With all of that in mind, I tried to give the remake the benefit of the doubt, and to like it. I really tried...but I can't.  Here are some reasons:

The Look:  Too grey, with a dull, washed-out look that was reminiscent of the bleach-bypass film process of the 1990's.  Sets and costumes weren't just low-tech, they were often ""no-tech.""  This show was as visually dull as its inspiration was visually appealing.  No wonder the resolution of the series was a Luddite refutation of technology.  And if I had to see yet another hike through dark British Columbian forests...

They Look Like Us: What a hoary cliche; countless sci-fi shows over the years have had alien infiltrators. Besides building suspense, it works because it saves production costs.  Sightings of the truly robotic Cylons were rare. Even Ron Moore's old show ""Deep Space Nine"" had infiltrating ""Changelings."" So next time, give originality a chance.

The Tipsy Cameraman:  I hated the drunkenly-bobbing handheld cameras of ""NYPD Blue"" years ago.  This BSG slavishly copied that technique.

""Perhaps You Don't"":  Everyone (and thing) reeked of rotten attitudes here.  Humans were preoccupied with mistreating each other rather than surviving their enemy.  The only solace was that the Cylons eventually proved equally self-destructive.

Machisma:  This series (which had a producer from Xena: Warrior Princess) had the females strut, scowl and bluster incessantly.  Starbuck was the most obnoxious example. Most of the male characters (Apollo, Billy and Baltar for example) seemed strangely emasculated.

The Music:  Where have you gone, Stu Phillips?  His rousing orchestral sound was replaced by moody blues.  The new sound was appropriate, but tedious.

Oh So British:  America doesn't even make TV series anymore; this show seemed to rub its British/Canadian nature in our Yank faces.  The final insult for American viewers was putting up with the show's British TV schedule.",1242259200,8,2310,5.23224043715847

8272961,5,B001993Y2C,"Best show ever at an amazing price, certainly amongst the cheapest I have ever paid for a boxed set of blu ray dvds. This set even includes the episode ""Razor"" which I was surely that it did not, but then I saw that it did and was pleased. It also opens at the top, like a shoebox and the blu rays are in durable plastic cases inside, per season, which is nice! Not like those expensive blu rays that have cardboard sleeves that seem as if they are going to scratch the discs. No issues playing at all,so far! And as everyone has said, the first few episodes are grainy, but that's the way it was shot, just the Miniseries episodes. With this set, I'll never go back to VHS!!!",1526774400,,676,4.207692307692308
