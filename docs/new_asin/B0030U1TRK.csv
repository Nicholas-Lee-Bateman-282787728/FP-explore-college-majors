8386054,4,B0030U1TRK,"I liked this 4 disk video set.  It contained footage of arieal bombings and dogfights, troop movements in europe and asia, naval battles and coastal shelling as well as commentary and narrations which I had not seen in other WWII type documentary films.  A good buy for under ten dollars.

8386055,4,B0030U1TRK,"If you are a WWII Buff you will recognize the title is a bit of a stretch, however at the time the films were prepared they may have been confidential. All that aside, my lady is a WWII History Buff, and she did enjoy the films.

If you have watched many of the documentary films you may find these will add little to your knowledge. Since these were for Generals and Staff viewing, the films must have been confidential/restricted. Must confess I will not watch the films of the Death Camps. I know they existed, they were horrible, but can not watch them. My BIL was in one group that freed some of these prisoners and he spoke very little about them, too horrible. My BIL was empathic as am I.

Glad we purchased them for my lady to watch and cost was reasonable-- particularly for 5 DVDS -- good buy for us.",1302998400,5,811,4.294117647058823
