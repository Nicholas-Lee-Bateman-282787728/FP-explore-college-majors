1231897,5,B00000JGE6,"One of the most popular writers of the roaring 20s was ""Madame"" Elinor Glynn--a middle-aged and decidedly matronly-looking woman who fancied herself as the arbiter of all things pertaining to sex-appeal.  Madame Glynn called sex-appeal IT, wrote a book by that name, and then made considerable money informing the public who had IT and who didn't.  And Madame Glynn declared that the little known actress Clara Bow had IT, and that Clara would star in a movie called IT.
It was a put-up job, of course, with Madame Glyn handsomely paid (and given a cameo appearance in the movie) for her trouble.  But it would have all been naught--except for the fact that Clara Bow really did have IT.  She turned in an extra-charming performance and shot to stardom as the ""IT"" girl.
Make no mistake about it: Bow is a LOT of fun to watch, a doll-like beauty with an infectious smile and bubbly energy.  And IT, the very slight story of a shop girl smitten with love for the big boss (Antonio Moreno), is tailor-made to display her charms; comic actor William Austin also has several good moments as Bow's would-be suitor.  Clara Bow would appear in considerably more sophistocated films later in her career, but IT provides a great introduction to one of the most adorable actresses to grace the silent screen.  Recommended.",1021593600,12,1312,4.778761061946903
1231898,4,B00000JGE6,"One of the most brilliant publicity campaigns in the history of the movies surrounded the making of Clara Bow's most famous vehicle. Elinor Glyn, an author of heavy-breathing romances during the twenties, announced that Clara Bow had IT (i.e. massive sex-appeal) whereupon Paramount's propaganda department flooded the media with ""WHAT -IS- IT?"" items, Bow's press agent disclosed that Bow's next picture would be simply entitled - surprise! - ""IT"", written and produced by Mme. Glyn (who wrote the sensational novel of the same title). The whole gimmick was so effective that a little comedy about a shopgirl who chases and captivates the store-owner became a smash-hit and zoomed Bow to superstardom. Look briefly for Gary Cooper (with whom Bow would have a red-hot affair in a couple of years) Incredibly, Josef Von Sterberg was handed a few scenes to direct!",1005955200,,862,5.164285714285715
1231899,4,B00000JGE6,"This is a review of the Kino DVD release of ""It"". Let's start by saying this is one of the most enjoyable silent films I've seen. This is entirely due to the presence of Clara Bow, whose dynamic performance never lets up for a second. This makes ""It"" one of the few silents that still works as entertainment rather than just an interesting slice of history. The reasons I think this DVD could have been even better lie with the fact that Kino has used the 1978 restoration version of this movie rather than the improved 1992 restoration. Whilst this 1978 restoration is still very good, the picture is slightly cropped. In other words, a small part of the picture at both the left & right and top & bottom of the screen is missing. This blemish is barely noticeable and does not really affect your viewing pleasure, especially as the picture quality itself is very impressive. Sure, there are marks and scratches here and there, but far less than you'd expect for a film well over 70 years old. The picture is generally quite sharp with decent contrast that only occasionally seems a little too harsh. I would rate the picture as being in the top 5% for movies of this age. The second reason this DVD could have been better is the music score. The 1992 restoration features a Carl Davis composition which is quite simply the best music score for a silent film you will ever hear...Unfortunately this DVD features a totally different score by William Perry. Whilst William Perry manages a perfectly adequate piano score that fits well with the movie it isn't a patch on Carl Davis' version. The ""only"" extra on this DVD is a documentary entitled ""Discovering The It Girl"". This only covers Clara Bow's life and career in a superficial way but we are treated to a wealth of movie clips. Contributions from people who knew Clara Bow also help make this a very enjoyable documentary. It's also worth noting that Kino previously released the movie and documentary on two separate VHS tapes. By buying them both on this one DVD instead of two videos you're actually saving yourself a few dollars! Notwithstanding the minor shortcomings, I definitely rate this DVD as a worthwhile purchase.",988070400,92,2183,4.702349869451697
1231900,5,B00000JGE6,The uncredited Josef von Sternberg is presumed to be responsible for one of the sexiest and most haunting images in movie history:  Clara Bow lounging while her once and future lover tries to summon the will-power to reject her.  As if anybody could.,983750400,3,250,4.790697674418604
1231901,4,B00000JGE6,"This is a really happy, light film featuring the original ""It Girl"". There is a basic storyline, but the picture basically follows the carefree exploits of Clara Bow and her attempts to snag the rich owner of the department store where she works.
The best part of this movie, in my opinion, is the peek into the culture of the Roaring Twenties. There are some wonderful shots of this lost world, including Coney Island (complete with some rather dangerous looking rides!) and an old-fashioned department store with clerks (it quite resembles Macy's in New York).
Another interesting aspect of the film is the acknowledgement of the stark contrast between the free-and-easy existence of the affluent and the struggles of the working poor. Bow's roommate in ""It"" is an ill, out of work single parent. She certainly doesn't have dinner parties on her mind: she is desperately attempting to keep her infant out of the clutches of the Child Welfare authorities.
All in all, this is a fun film and a great introduction to the work of Clara Bow.",982627200,8,1038,4.837078651685394
1231902,4,B00000JGE6,"Until I saw this film recently, I never thought I would be able to sit through a silent film.  I had read about Clara Bow, and was interested to see how she performed on screen.  Although it is silent, her personality  and vivaciousness shines. Her eyes just have so much expression...
The  other actors are fine and the story line is all right, but Clara just takes  this film and runs with it.  No wonder that she became the It Girl upon the  release of this movie!
Clara Bow was and is truly a film legend and  deserves much more notice than she has received.  What a wonderful film -  worth watching again and again!",947203200,18,620,4.3130434782608695

What an amazing documentary, Clara Bow was definitely the sex vamp from the silent era of the 20's with so many of her films lost due to the nitrate process however, I would have to say that Theda Bara was the original sex goddess from the early 1900's with only a few films to be found to include ""A Fool There Was"" from 1915 with ""Cleopatra"" being the true holy grail if found and only a few surviving seconds of footage from this true rare silent film.  In all Clara Bow went on to win the very first Academy Award with ""Wings"" from 1927 and was the eras favorite ""IT"" girl who went on to do a few sound films in the early 30's to include ""Call Her Savage"".

Clara Bow will forever be known as The It Girl after her saucy performance in this 1927 feature where she plays Betty Lou Spence a sales girl who pursues her boss.

Her boss, Cyrus Waltham (Antonio Moreno) has a steady girl who is hoping he will soon pop the question.  Betty Lou doesnt let that stop her and manipulates and connives to win him.  Will anyone stop her?  Can anything come between them?  Cyrus right-hand man Monty (William Austin) cracked me up all through this movie.  He, too, likes Betty Lou.  How does this work out?

CLARA BOW: DISCOVERING THE IT GIRL

This 62 minute documentary on Clara Bow is narrated by Courtney Love.  (Well, split my britches and kick my butt!  She does a very good job.)  It tells of mental illness in her family, molestation, multiple affairs, broken engagements, personal scandals, attempted suicide, marriages, movies, etc.  At the height of her career she was receiving 8,000 fan letters a week.  She can have all the fame Ill take sanity any day.

It, directed by Clarence Badger (Red Hair), is 72 minutes long and was made in 1927 at the height of the silent movie era.  It deserves all the fame it has garnered over the years.  William P. Perry provides a catchy piano score as music for this prize of a movie.  Clara Bow had it.  I recommend 'It' for everyone.",1414281600,,1397,4.560483870967742

When people say ""from rags to riches"" that's very close to Clara Bow's life except that there was a lot more rags than riches.

Watching her on film is hypnotic. Even though I like Clara Bow: Discovering the It Girl I'd advise saving it until you have have watched some of her movies. She make make you a Silent Movie Fan but she will definitely leave you with an impression that will linger for a long, long time. If you have Amazon Prime or Netflix you can watch several of her movies free.

One word of warning. She lived a wild and reckless life. So be prepared for a little shock value.",1394409600,,762,4.359154929577465

1231990,3,B00000JGE6,"It (Clarence Badger, 1927)

The term ""It Girl"" has become a cultural artifact; you say it now and pretty much everyone in America knows what you're talking about. However, Clarence Badger's 1927 silent film It, which coined the term, has faded into obscurity. I got a chance to watch it recently and, to be kind, I understand why.  Which is not to say it's a bad film in any way, but it's quite generic.

The plot is simple as can be: Betty Lou (the ravishing Clara Bow), the ""It Girl"" of the title, sets her sights on Cyrus Waltham (The Searchers' Antonio Moreno), the handsome, rich son of the owner of the department store where she works. Yep, that's it, no pun intended; she spends an hour and twelve minutes trying to get her man. (And since it's a comedy, you know how that's gonna turn out, right?) Needless to say, if you're a Clara Bow fan, it's worth watching because you get to see her do her thing. And while I'm more of a Lillian Gish guy, you gotta admit, Clara Bow is hands down one of the sexiest women ever to appear on film.

Prior to purchasing, I read other reviews which said the contrast is better on the Milestone edition, the cropping isn't as tight, the picture quality is generally better and the music is far superior.

The only edition at present that I've seen is the Milestone, but I can tell you that it lived up to its hype. The musical score by Carl Davis is brilliant and supplements the film beautifully. The picture quality and restoration are both first-rate; it's easy to see why audiences flocked to see Clara and her co-star, Antonio Moreno. Incidentally, I enjoyed seeing Moreno in this very-different role from the one he played opposite Greta Garbo a couple of years before in THE TEMPTRESS (available in the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/TCM-Archives-The-Garbo-Silents-Collection-The-Temptress-Flesh-and-the-Devil-The-Mysterious-Lady/dp/B0009S4IKG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">TCM Archives: The Garbo Silents Collection (The Temptress / Flesh and the Devil / The Mysterious Lady)</a>).

IT, in case you're wondering, is (or at least *includes*) 'sex appeal.' This was a more polite way of talking about it...and sometimes subtlety doesn't hurt. It certainly doesn't injure THIS film.

Even though this edition is out-of-print, it's worth pursuing. Kino makes a great product and I have a great many films from them, but if you can lay hands on the Milestone edition, do it.",1344124800,9,1493,5.777272727272727

Fans of ""It"" face a tough choice when buying it on disc.

The picture quality is considerably better on the Milestone/Image disc (though they should have digitally fixed the loose splices on the intertitles). On the downside, though, Carl Davis's score sets the wrong tone in many of the early scenes. Davis is one of the best silent film composers of recent years, but I can't stand much of what he came up with for this film, especially in the first 16 minutes. Once Betty starts getting ready for her date, Davis finds the right tone most of the time.

The Kino disc has William Perry's jaunty piano score, which I prefer, but the picture is less sharp and there's less detail in the graytones.

1231994,5,B00000JGE6,"This is the film that forever immortalized Clara Bow as the ""It Girl"" - ""it"" being that desirable quality of sex appeal, something which Bow possessed in abundance, along with her genuine talent as an actress. In 1927, Bow was at the peak of her fame, eclipsing every other major star's popularity. Her striking beauty and vivacious, down to earth personality connected with audiences so strongly that she came to represent the entire era known as the ""Jazz Age"".

Directed by Clarence Badger, IT is a spirited, romantic comedy about a salesgirl in a department store (Bow) with eyes for her boss (Antonio Moreno), and the misunderstandings that ensue in her attempt to win his heart.

The film is a total delight from start to finish, and while most of this is due to Bow's captivating screen presence, IT also perfectly captures the carefree spirit of the 20's, especially in the fun Coney Island sequence.

There's two DVDs of IT that I recommend: Kino's 2001 release with a piano score by William Perry that also has the documentary, ""Clara Bow: Discovering the 'It' Girl"", and Milestone's 2003 restored version featuring a great orchestral score by Carl Davis, commentary by Jeanine Basinger and a stills gallery. Both versions are from the same source print, but Milestone's has a slight edge in sharpness and is the one connoisseurs like me will prefer. I got the Kino copy mainly for the documentary. I also have a soft spot for William Perry's work, as he scored so many silents from the Killiam Collection back in the day.

Whichever version you decide on - Kino or Milestone - this is a ""feel good"" movie that's very easy to watch and enjoy, thanks to the charming, effervescent Clara Bow. I guess if I had to pick one title to introduce newcomers to the unique pleasure of silent films, it would be IT.",1328659200,4,1814,4.731012658227848

isn't all that sexy, given that the film proclaims her the 'it' girl, she

It shows the way both the rich and poor lived in the 20s and gives viewers an excellent idea of what people considered ""sexy"" almost a hundred years ago. The definition of 'it' still holds true today!

1231999,5,B00000JGE6,"1927 and after the premiere of the silent romantic comedy ""It"", actress Clara Bow would become the sexiest silent movie star in America during the roaring '20s.

Having done well in films such as ""The Plastic Age"" and ""Mantrap"", ""It"" was as if the film was created just for Clara.  The film was inspired by Elinor Glynn's (who pioneered women's erotic fiction) self-titled novel and she would coin the term ""It"" to erroneously describe sex appeal.  And Clara Bow definitely had sex appeal.

Bow who would become one of the popular female stars of the Flapper era ( a term from the 1920's to describe liberal young women who defied the norm of acceptable behavior by sporting short skirts, bobbed hair, listened to jazz, wore a lot of makeup and drinking, smoking, driving cars and even being sexual.

And Clara Bow embraced her flapper character of Betty Lou Spence in ""It"".  A timeless classic romantic comedy from the Killiam Collection and released by Kino Video via a Deluxe Edition which contains the silent film and also the Clara Bow documentary ""Clara Bow: Discovering the ""It"" Girl"".

""It"" begins with Monty Montgomery (played by William Austin"") reading an issue of ""Cosmopolitan"" about who has ""It"", an article about Elinor Glyn's popular book on sex appeal.  As new department store owner Cyrus Waltham Jr. (played by Antonio Moreno) is busy at work and trying to please his childhood friend Adela Van Norman (played by Jacqueline Gadsen), Monty goes to search for a woman that has ""It"".

And sure enough, Monty discovers an employee who works over the counter who has ""It"".  A flapper named Betty Lou Spence (played by Clara Bow) who is just enamored by the new owner Cyrus Waltham Jr.

Betty Lou dreams that one day she will be Mr. Waltham's woman but for now, she can only dream.

Meanwhile, Monty pursues Betty Lou as the ""It"" girl and Betty Lou looks as Monty as a way for her to get to know Mr. Waltham.  Meanwhile, at home, we see that Betty Lou is a woman who doesn't have much money and lives with her friend Molly (played by Priscilla Bonner) who is ill and has a baby.  It appears that because of Molly's illness, the child protective agency wants to take the baby away from her.  But Betty Lou does all she can to calm her nerves and reassure her that things will be OK.

As Betty Lou uses her sexual charm on Monty, she has him taking her out to a posh restaurant that Mr. Waltham attends and immediately uses her charm to get his attention, despite Waltham sitting with his fiance/friend Adela.

All Betty Lou needs is that short moment in order to use her sexual appeal on Mr. Waltham and sure enough, from the moment Waltham meets Betty Lou, he is enamored and likes her.

Everything seems to be going as planned for Betty Lou as she seems to have Mr. Waltham in her grasp but when the child protective services try to take the baby away from her friend Molly, Betty Lou steps in and tells the agency reps that the baby belongs to her.

Now Monty and Mr. Waltham try to cope with the news that Betty Lou is a mother of a baby the best they can.  Will Betty Lou now lose her dream man?

As for the documentary ""Clara Bow: Discovering the ""It"" Girl"", Courtney Love narrates the documentary featuring interviews with Clara Bow's family and friends and film critics and biographers.  The documentary goes into Clara's turbulent life from having a grandmother and mother who suffered mental problems (note: epilepsy a the time was considered a severe mental disorder), her mother upset that Clara was pursuing acting and one night waking up and seeing her mother standing over her with a butcher knife to her neck to other situations that affected her upbringing.

But what was most damaging was because she was such a sex symbol, there were many slanderous false rumors about her which the public believed to Clara Bow being the ""It"" girl during the silent era and during the year of the ""talkies"", having mental breakdowns due to her fear of the mic and going from Paramount's darling to an actress they would literally cut out (unfortunately, a sad story that is attached to many once popular silent film stars).

And then ending with her life outside of entertainment with husband and popular Cowboy actor) Rex Bell and hearing her son Rex Bell Jr. talking about the mother he knew during the final stages of her life.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

It's important to note that many silent films from the 1920's don't fare that well.  Being filmed on nitrate (which deteriorated or caught fire), many silent films are lost or destroyed and what we are left with are classics that range from being good prints to some having massive scratches, debris and flickering.  ""It"" is a film that is more towards the middle.  Some of the scenes show scratches, debris and minor flickering and aliasing.

Fortunately, the print quality is definitely watchable and unless there are many other reels out there to create a restored print, this DVD from Kino Video is probably the best we are going to see of ""It"" for now.  Considering this film, is over 80-years-old, I'm not going to complain, I feel that it is fortunate that this film was not lost and that we can watch this film today.

As for the documentary, the documentary was made in 1999 and picture quality is very good on DVD.

AUDIO:

As for audio, although the film is silent, there is music via a piano score by William Perry.  The music works well with this film and captures the mood of the characters.

Intertitles are in English.

As for the audio of ""Clara Bow: Discovering the 'It' Girl"", Courtney Love did a very good job in narration for the documentary and interviewees and everyone is heard quite well.  No problems whatsoever when it comes to the documentary's audio.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

There are no special features included in this release.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""It"" was a satisfying, enjoyable and delightful romantic comedy from the silent era.  Clara Bow exudes beauty and sexiness through her flirtatious eyes, pouty lips and if anything, she knew how to work the camera to with magnificent results.  She embodied the title of ""It"" Girl and it was evident throughout this film that Clara Bow was America's sexiest superstar at that time.

I laughed throughout this film because the comedy was well-played.  From Clara Bow's character playing hard-to-get plus an enjoyable date scene between Betty Lou and Mr. Walther in Coney Island.  You can tell the two had a lot of fun and overall pacing and cinematography was fun to watch.

But along with this enjoyable film is the documentary ""Clara Bow: Discovering the `It' Girl"".  I had no idea that Clara's life was so turbulent.  From hearing how painful her childhood was, to knowing now that when she sheds a tear on film, those tears were genuine out of grief of a friend who died in a fire in her building and the boy dying in her arms.

And what was even more damning was the gossip coverage of her during the 1920's and 1930's.  Way before anyone was suing people for inflammatory accusations, Clara Bow had the worst treatment.  Yes, she was Hollywood's sex symbol and had her share of flings but the rumors about her were so terrible that she was literally beaten.  And the transition from the silent film era to the talkies was not exactly easy for her either.

It's unfortunate and heartbreaking that a woman who would be regarded as the ""It"" girl would suffer so much pain in her life but when the camera was on, she made all who viewed her film that she was confident, sexy and happy.  She was a true actress who knew how to give a magnificent performance despite the demons that she faced within her.

""It"" and her later film ""Wings"" (which was the first Academy Award winning film) are just two of the films that she's known for but if anything, this DVD release from Kino Video has inspired me to seek out more Clara Bow films.  Her performance on ""It"" was magnificent, the film was enjoyable and fun.

Overall, this is one DVD release that silent films want to own and have in their collection.  Watch the magnificent Clara Bow and you too will realize why she was definitely ""It""!

1232003,5,B00000JGE6,"Yes, I know it's Clara Bow's most well known film, but E do honestly think it's her best.  Many of her other movie characters were written in such a way that sometimes I think ""why the heck is she doing that?!""  but not with Betty Lou Spence.  And Clara Bow just takes Betty Lou and makes her so real and likeable.

I know that Elinor Glyn's definition of ""it"" included the statement, ""IT is self-confidence and indifference as to whether you are pleasing or not..."" and that in the movie, Betty Lou does care whether or not she is pleasing to Mr. Waltham.  However, she still definitely has ""it"" - she's attractive, she's vivacious, she's well-liked by both men and women, and she has a great personality.  Clara Bow just makes Betty Lou someone you wish you could be.

The Clara Bow documentary is very interesting, but doesn't go deep enough into her life story.  And why the heck did they pick Courtney Love to narrate it?  I would have preferred someone connected with classic movies or at least an anonymous voice over person.

Clara Bow is beautiful and complex and compelling.  She radiates sexuality and draws you in like a magnet.  The story is a bit far-fetched as I doubt a department store magnet would fall for a shop clerk in today's times, but cute nonethless.

Her personal life as a child was horrible but I believe that is where her ""edge"" came from.  She had nothing to lose.  Clara has been gone over 40 years but she is so alive in this film that it is hard to imagine her
being gone.

Clara Bow plays Betty Lou Spence to perfection with her wide eyed beautiful stare and her overall charm and natural appeal. Antonio Moreno plays Cyrus Waltham, Jr., the boss, with his very convincing acting abilities even though in a silent movie he didn't have too many lines!

Betty wants to date Cyrus Waltham, Jr. badly--she even daydreams of asking Santa Claus to give him to her for Christmas! Although the other salesgirls laugh it off, Betty means business. They don't realize that Betty has plenty of ""It."" ""It"" generally refers to Betty's self-confidence coupled with her good looks and natural appeal. Betty displays a good ability to plan things out when she accepts a date with Cyrus' buddy Monty--on the condition that they dine at The Ritz because that's where Cyrus is having his own dinner that evening. In addition, the scene in The Ritz dining room gives us a wonderful cameo appearance by ""Madame"" Elinor Glynn, who tells Cyrus--and the audience--what ""It"" is.  SMILES

Of course, Cyrus finally gets a good look at Betty and almost immediately he begins to lose interest in his current lady friend as he gains interest for Betty. They do go out and have a marvelous time together.

But a complication involving a baby with an absentee father arises. When Betty rushes to the aid of her friend so that the social workers don't take the baby from the apartment Betty shares with her roommate, the newspaper sends a reporter and races to print that Betty is the mother.

Well, IS Betty is the mother? Cyrus can't stand even the mere thought of this and cuts off Betty without even giving her a chance to explain. How can Betty work things out so that Cyrus regains his interest and love for her? Can Betty beat out Cyrus' current girlfriend to win Cyrus' heart? No spoilers here, folks; you'll have to watch the movie to find out!

I agree with the reviewer who writes that the quality of the film print is exceptionally good for its age. The clarity of each image is excellent. The sound of the musical accompaniment is good, too, even if the score was not the original.

The DVD has few extras besides the documentary with director Clarence Badger on the making of It. Unfortunately, I must take off a star because it did not work in my computer DVD-ROM drive! (Thank goodness this was a rental.)

Overall, fans of classic silent movies should watch this film. The DVD extra probably just malfunctioned on my rental DVD and I encourage you to buy this DVD anyway if this type of film appeals to you.

The edition of ""IT"" I got is the IMAGE-MILESTONE one and I must say it's GREAT!!

The films tells the story of a salesgirl's infatuation with the son of the owner of a Department Store in which she works.

Clara Bow's is just short of magnificent in a role that really defines her screen personae; that of the mischievous, sexy, bold, magnetic, electrifying, ultramodern and yet sweet girl/flapper.

She was 21 or 22 years old when she made this film and she looks so fresh and contemporary than other Silent Stars of that Era; and if you compare her looks and ways, even her acting, to that of the other women in the cast (Priscilla Bonner, Jacqueline Gadsden, Julia Swayne Gordon), you'll see what I mean.

Antonio Moreno is good as her Love interest, although he looks much older than her (he was 41 when the film was made) but then, considering this was 1927, he does not look as old as 41 year-old men of that time used to. Also, Moreno works well with Bow and their love scenes together are believable.

William Austin is great as Moreno's sidekick, funny and ever-partying.

Elinor Glyn, the authoress of the book upon which the film was based, makes a cameo in a Restaurant scene, making a grand entrance.

A young Gary Cooper has a small role as a journalist.

1232009,5,B00000JGE6,"Even though Clara Bow had been a star for a few years before this film came out, there's no denying it's her most famous and best-remembered today (except maybe for 'Wings').  Watching this delightful story, it becomes obvious why she really did have ""It"" in spades, such effortless sex appeal, spunk, charm, personality, charisma, and presence, the kind of traits that rivet one to the screen.  This film could have been made with any actors, but Clara makes it really come to life and makes you want to watch it, because of her strong screen presence and personality, in a way not just any old actor was capable of doing.  And part of her appeal is how she was like the girl nextdoor (albeit the very sexy girl nextdoor), from a solid working-class background and lifestyle, and that makes the audience root for her and sympathise with her over the snobby rich girl Adele, who is also vying for the affections of Cyrus.  Even a lot of the title cards are charming, fun, cute, and sweet, all serving to elevate this beyond the level of your ordinary date movie or lighthearted romantic comedy.  Times may have changed somewhat (for example, the subplot about Betty Lou's roommate Molly and her presumably illegitimate child and how the nosy spinsters want her to turn the baby over to social services may no longer mean anything to modern audiences who have no problem with an unmarried woman having a baby), but just because some parts of it might seem like products of an earlier time now doesn't diminish from the underlying charm, fun, and delight.

I loved this, it's so timeless.  This whole Silent Film from start to finish is Playful, Very funny and Smart. Clara Bow gives an incredible performance. I couldn't think of anybody else pulling this role off with such quality. Clara Bow is beautiful and just a marvel to watch. The Dialogue written by Elinor Glyn for this film is also spot on, the funniest one liner coming from Bow after being asked if the baby she's holding is Monty's (rather camp looking guy) Bow reply's ""Him, He couldn't give birth to a Suspicion"" that line for me is a classic. The whole cast really made it their own you also have Gary Cooper in his first small role as a reporter.

Discovering the 'IT' Girl

A documentary has been added to this DVD which is a real treat, David Stenn who also wrote Clara Bow 'Runnin'Wild Biography looks at the life of a Star. One of Clara's sons Rex Bell Jr. talks about his mother with affection and many old friends who knew her personally, tell us about her background, her life and what made Clara Bow just who she was. There's some beautiful photo's of the star, and also film footage of her in the talkies. This is a terrific and well put together documentary great for fans.

I really can't tell enough people what a great biography the book 'Runnin'Wild is by David Stenn.

To top it off, the Image release also boasts an informative commentary track, a remarkably clean print and a modern, custom-built score.

  They had to play it coy back then, but today we can step out from behind the euphemisms and reveal the definition of ""It"" as sexual attractiveness.  Even by modern standards the perky Bow had ""It"" in spades, especially when compared to such grotesque contemporaries as the ghoulish Theda Bara and the vulgar Mae West.  After all these years Bow still looks cute and modern, while her rivals have faded into obscurity and decades of exaggerated parody.

  I haven't the finer sensibilities needed to fully appreciate female-centric tales of the poor girl getting the rich boy.

When she first sees her boss, the handsome Cyrus Waltham, Jr. (played by Antonio Moreno), she falls for him and decides that he is to be her husband.  But  Waltham barely notices the shopgirl until his friend Monty Montgomery (comically played by William Austin) spies her at the counter and determines that she has ""It,"" a certain type of sex appeal.  With the help of Monty and her own ""It"" factor, Betty tries to win the man of her dreams.
This is a delightful romantic comedy, based upon the short story by Elinor Glyn -- who also makes a cameo appearance in the film.  the acting is spot on, so much so that you don't even need the title cards.  You can tell exactly what's going on.  Clara Bow is amazing as Betty, with just the right charm and sex appeal.  The great music accompaniment on this DVD was written by Carl Davis and matches the film perfectly.
A classic romantic comedy from the Silent Era.",1079308800,28,1019,4.5

1232015,5,B00000JGE6,"A first-rate romantic-comedy sensation of its day, this precious little gem of a movie shows actress Clara Bow at the peak of her short-lived career. This is silent cinema at it best, showing the lighter side to the silent era.
Clearly, Clara Bow is the star here, front and center, but the supporting cast is fantastic as well. The story isn't particularly original, brilliant, or surprising, but then it doesn't have to be. In fact, it probably shouldn't be.
This Kino DVD is a fine transfer, with little grain, and looks sharp, clean, and wonedrfully clear considering its age. The soundtrack score is clean and fits well.
Clara Bow looks so adorable in this film that its hard not to fall in love with her as you watch this film. It's just such a charming little romantic piece full of cuteness and playfulness, just like Bow herself.",1035158400,11,838,4.707482993197279
1232016,5,B00000JGE6,"For a few brief years in the mid 1920s, Clara Bow stood above all Hollywood as the new kind of female lead.  All other actresses may have been beautiful, sexy, or even talented, but their talent was used only to bounce off their male leads.  These females could radiate only a virginal sort of charm, one that could be accepted or rejected by her suitor.  Clara Bow changed all that. In her very first film, Bow, looking like a twenties combination of a zesty Cindy Lauper with a sizzling Marilyn Monroe, bounced all over the screen, radiating from her face that she was a woman who was not bashful about getting what she wants.  By 1927, Bow, only 22, was already a star.  Hollywood was determined to use her sexual presence to elevate her to unheard of levels.  The problem was that the word 'sex' was a no-no; however the word 'it' was not.  The would-be producers of Bow's next film looked to a hack writer named Elinor Glynn for a lead that would let them sell sex, even if it meant using a pseudonym.  For an unspecified large sum, Glynn gave them permission to use her copywrighted 'it' as the fulcrum to build the first female smoldering superstar.  The name of the film, of course, was IT, and so Clara Bow was forever associated as the girl who had 'it.' The plot was rather simple.  She plays a shopgirl who has to explain the unwanted presence of a baby in order to snag her boss.  During the film, all of her trademark techniques are used: huge smiles, hair fluffing, direct pursuit of her man, rapid-fire dialogue, and a willingness to tell the Establishment to go to hell.  By the end of he film, she has her man, and Hollywood had its superstar.
  Even today, watching IT is a lesson that eternally repeats itself.  Talent,in whatever medium, will showcase itself.  Clara Bow had that and it as well.  It took Jean Harlow to pick up the baton that Clara Bow held out for the next worthy contender for her title.",1024617600,14,1927,4.46

The story line was simple but entertaining. This film put Clara Bow in the limelight.  She had a fresh and fun acting style. Had the ability to touch the movie going public. Bow was the ""IT"" girl in the late 1920's. Clara Bow another great John Gilbert both suffered the same fate. Their acting styles and poor scripts destroyed their careers in the Sound Era. They made some good sound films but could not recover the glory. We now can see their best films and judge for yourself.
