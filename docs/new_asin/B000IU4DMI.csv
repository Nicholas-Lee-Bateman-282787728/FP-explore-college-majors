2663455,5,B000IU4DMI,"I remember when this came out originally I was on Netflix waiting list for months, and when it finally came I watched it for weeks. I had forgotten about it till it showed up on Netflix streaming recently, and keep watching it over and over! Just a great balance of new and old songs, chatting with Neil and band members. I see some reviewers have been disappointed in the overall country quality of this--I would put this more in the folksy category than country, but you have to realize these 2 concerts were performed at the Ryman Theatre in Nashville, home of the Grand Old Opry, and the title of the actual cd is Prairie Home. So hard driving rock and roll they ain't. Just a beautiful concert--typical Neil storytelling, wonderful backup musicians--think I'll buy it so when Netflix gives it the ax I can still enjoy it.",1451692800,,826,4.587837837837838

2663474,5,B000IU4DMI,"I never understood the Neil Young music attraction until I watched this performance. It is almost trance inducing. I can't believe this concert was captured on film in a way that conveys the experience of hearing it the way it was performed. Then again, it might be my home theater surrounded sound set up that really made this the experience that it was. This is a must own performance!",1440979200,,387,4.6231884057971016

2663479,5,B000IU4DMI,"LOVE this concert video....so much good music from Neil, starting with Prairie Wind songs and then hitting some of his oldies but goodies. I especially love ""Four Strong Winds"", a song near and dear to my heart for over 45 years. For some reason that song always puts a smile on my face and a lump in my throat. A wonderful video of a fantastic concert by a favorite artist. I only wish we could get this WHOLE concert on CD as well as on DVD.",1439424000,,443,4.162790697674419

2663484,5,B000IU4DMI,"Been a Neil Young guy since 1969 starting with Everybody knows this is nowhere thru Decades and getting near the end of the road with the Prairie Wind strait to the heart performance I like to think was done for us long time loyal fans.  From the Army in March 1971 thru surgery at the Miami VA, mister youngs music has sustained me more than any other entertainer with his words and notes of wisdom and down to earth music.  Thank you sir.  Long may you run",1437264000,,458,4.241379310344827

2663490,5,B000IU4DMI,"This DVD was purchased to show at a nursing home as part of our ""Rock Concert Series"".
At first they thought we had ""Neil Young"" at our facility to perform live.
Age groups from Vietnam Era, Korean Conflict, and WWII really enjoyed this DVD.
Most stayed to the very end- even thought it ran longer than our regular hour programs.
They enjoyed the history of it at Ryman, and the stories Neil shares throughout the DVD and especially the misc. stories he shared.",1435708800,,461,4.566265060240964

2663497,5,B000IU4DMI,Mostly all new ( and very well written ) music performed with a lot of heart and passion by Neil and a host of other fine musicians and singers. Neil has done such a large body of great work. This will reach you and touch you in that special way that only Mr. Young can do.,1432339200,,273,3.892857142857143

2663500,5,B000IU4DMI,Huge Neil fan so maybe a little bias but this SO good. Neil and his many musicians and singers are all really in to it in this performance. I have watched it again and again. Well edited too. None of this bouncing around to a different camera shot every 3 seconds nonsense. You actually get to see them perform instead of a million little glimpses!,1430956800,,348,4.369230769230769

2663506,5,B000IU4DMI,"What a great show. For any one thinking about getting this and if you like the softer side of Neil, such as Harvest Moon then this is for you. You won't hear Powderfinger or Cinnamon Girl or any other Crazy Horse type of Neil here. So if that is all you like then this will not be for you. I personnelly like both aspects of this classic and very talented musician.",1429315200,,365,4.154929577464789

2663515,5,B000IU4DMI,"What a great performance by Neil Young and his band. Most of the tracks are from his ""Prairie Wind"" album, the one where he used Hank Williams' old Martin dreadnaught for most of the tracks. I'm a big fan of his acoustic stuff and this is some of his best work.",1424736000,,261,4.137254901960785

2663522,5,B000IU4DMI,"Concert films have a tendency to be hit or miss affairs; too often they rely on gimmicks such as gratuitous crowd shots, seizure causing jump shots, and other flash in the pan camera techniques that distract from the performance at hand. The difference between ""Heart of Gold"" and many other concert dvds is the fact that it was directed by a truly accomplished director with an eye for detail and using various different techniques to capture subtleties and nuances in each performance; for a performer as expressive as Young is when delivering his songs, Jonathan Demme is the perfect match for capturing the visual aspects of the concert. There are no cheesy MTV style jump cuts or split screen, just simple, beautiful camera work that doesn't distract from the nearly 20 beautiful performances featured.

The concert itself is just magnificent; I'll admit that I'm not the biggest fan of ""Prairie Wind,"" but the record really does come alive in this particular setting; ""It's a Dream"" is the highlight of the first set, along with ""Falling Off the Face of the Earth"" and ""No Wonder."" It's the second set, however, that really makes this a truly special performance, with extremely touching renditions of ""Harvest Moon,"" (maybe the best version ever), ""Heart of Gold,"" and ""The Needle and the Damage Done,"" among others. The closing performance of ""One of These Days"" is a joy to watch and listen to, a perfect summation of a job well done.

The musicians assembled hold their own against the very best outfits Neil has ever worked with (he's arguably never had a bad backing band), including longtime ""Harvest"" stalwart Ben Keith, keyboard legend Spooner Oldham, and of course Emmylou Harris; an accomplished vocalist, songwriter and musician in her own right, Harris gets almost as much facetime as Neil and elevates each performance where she is featured prominently, particularly on the jaunty ""Old King.""

""Heart of Gold"" is a touching, entertaining and wholly successful concert film combining the talents of two truly special artists at the top of their game.",1422144000,,2069,5.026239067055394

The best parts are the duets with Emmylou Harris. The older material was  the best part for me maybe the only part I liked .Exceptions being the duets with Emmylou Harris. Great musicians all. Great production. Just mediocre performances. I did Love the ending where he played The Old Laughing Lady, one of my favorite songs. He literally just wailed on it.

2663552,5,B000IU4DMI,"It seems hard to call this ""classic"" as it is modern day Neil. But that's what it feels like to me.  The thing I love about this film and it's music is that it is the Neil that I love; the folkie Neil. Not the 80's grungy rock Neil which I don't appreciate much. Heart of Gold chronicles the forming, rehearsing and performing of some of Neil's newer acoustic/folk music like Prairie Wind (along with some of the classics like Old Man, Heart of Gold and even some Buffalo Springfield) at the Ryman Auditorium in Nashville. The band consists of some great musicians like Spooner Oldham, Ben Keith and Emmylou Harris.  Production values are high thanks to filmmaker Jonathon Demme.

When I realized it would not play on our DVD player, I wrote the vendor and asked about the format. They replied that the information as to the format was in the *Comments* section, and that they did not have a copy in North American format. Well, the comments section is not where I go to see the basics of what a vendor is selling. I rely upon the item description to reveal all I need to know to make a purchase. The vendor did offer a return option, but I opted to buy a ""region free"" DVD player so my husband could have his concert.

I noticed he used Sony for his Journeys DVD.I give it 3 stars because I liked many of the songs and the concert in general. The concert should be done over even though it is rated over 4 stars.

The words speak volumes, as we have all come to expect from Neil, but are more mature and insightfully than ever. His guitar playing is amazing, the cords exciting, haunting and will make you ask, HOW THE HELL DOES HE DO THAT!!?  He rocks it still.
It's wonderful to see the ease within the relationships of all the performers on the stage, and love to see him perform with his wife.

As the band plays through Prairie Wind, and then cuts loose on a choice cover song or two, the comfort level is obvious.  Many of the artists sharing the stage that night in 2005 have been with Mr Young for upwards of 20 years, and the flow of the set shows it.  If there is a hit that wasn't covered, it might be Cinnamon Girl, but with songs embellished by multiple guitars, pedal steel, two keyboard players, The Memphis Horns, and a choir, virtually every base is covered.  Johnston Demme did a magnificent job directing this film, and I would say that if you're a Neil Young fan, this is essential viewing and listening!",1358208000,,706,4.484375

This was done in Memphis at the home of the Grand Ole Opry----not my favorite genre. Some beautiful old songs were played, but not enough. The first half is his attempt at a country thing. But, I like watching and hearing him. Hence, the 4 stars. There is a second disc with interviews and history. The mood of this performance has something to do with issues and circumstances of his life and health at the time. He's allowed. I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND THIS UNLESS YOU LIKE COUNTRY AND REALLY LIKE NEIL YOUNG. I really like NEIL YOUNG.

2663586,5,B000IU4DMI,"This album is a classic. Neil Young, while no philosopher, is one heck of a song writer. He evokes images that stir tthe memories, good and bad. He puts these images to beautiful music with top musicians and singers.
  Unfortunately there are gratis ""coming attractions"" for some truly degenerate movies before the Young album starts; but they can easily be skipped through using the right buttons. It's as if the producers refuse to let normal people go without THE revolutionary message.
Along with the entertainment, is a supplimentary album which focuses on the performers and how the album came to be. Everyone recognizes the greatness of Young's talent and I have to agree.",1344729600,,679,5.0

This film was too much for me.  Too long, too whiny, too precious.  Give me that 'old time music' that Young did when the time was right.  Nothing wrong here, just reminds me of Muhammad Ali when he should have quit boxing and didn't.  All these recaps that most performers come back to do give me that.  But on the other hand, fans want to see the performers like we all want to see an old friend, so no harm.  Go Neil Young and friends with your ""Heart(s) of Gold"" and everbody's ""Cinnamon Girl"" etc. that we'll always remember.

2663590,5,B000IU4DMI,"Neil Young is who he is, has never pretended otherwise, nor suffered pretence easily. If you like his falsetto tenor, and you respect him as an artist whose honesty won't be restrained, you'll like the concert film. Demme uses no tricks, no fireworks - he just lets the music and musicians speak for themselves. My habit is to attribute qualities (that may not exist) to those people/artists I like, and I'd like to be able to say Young is a genius songwriter, but, in truth, his genius lies elsewhere. It lies in one of those ephemeral places that are known to creative folks who, without fear, open themselves up to whatever experience comes next and then interpret it for the rest of us.

Neil Young is my favorite singer, and as always, him and his music was great. His friends who joined along with him were also well worth the price of Hearth of Gold. Great DVD.",1316649600,,337,3.6301369863013697
2663595,2,B000IU4DMI,"I guess you have to measure the final product against your expectations, so given that I expected something closer to actual history, Heart of Gold was a miss for me.  Plainly, Young wants to be remembered as a writer of Important Songs and as an Iconic Country Artist, which is only part of what he's been.  He's also been a totally sincere arrow-through-the-heart rock & roller, and that truth has been ignored here in favor of a more flattering legacy.

This is more or less a church service for 2 hours, understandably because he had a brain operation coming right up.  So there are a lot of hymns, pious sentiments, family and friendships on display, plus some gorgeous vocals (from HIM of all people!) and excellent musicianship.  He's all cleaned up, wearing a nice suit with a good haircut--no cocaine boogers or hey hey hi hi in evidence.  That's a relief, sure, but the music is overly polite and in one or two cases downright soporific.  I know he had to tailor his program to a Nashville audience, but just one bust-loose moment would have improved this snore-a-thon enormously.  Or at the very least, it would have adhered to the truth a little closer.

Neil Young has always been the crazy man who made sense despite his excesses.  And now that he's deliberately un-crazied himself he's lost the dangerous edge that made him unique.  I'm glad for his sake that he's done so, but I really miss the guy who wrote Cinnamon Girl.",1313971200,,1439,4.648221343873518

2663598,5,B000IU4DMI,"Wow ... what a treat for those lucky fans who got to see this concert in person.  And a wonderful experience as well for those of us who only get to see it on DVD.

I'll just say it up front.  Neil Young is by far my favorite musical artist.  And his mellower ""Harvest-type"" acoustic singer-song writer music is what I like best about him.

Young is one of the most prolific and versatile artists of the rock era.  Because he has made so much music in such a variety of styles, if you go to one of his concerts in about 90 minutes, you are liable to hear everything from the lilting acoustic sounds of ""Helpless"" on is old Martin, all the way to the sensory bombardment of ""Cinnamon Girl"" shaking the rafters on his vintage Les Paul.

But, what you won't hear anymore, is Neil settling down to an entire evening of his most memorable folk/country classics in which he leaves out almost nothing that his fans have come to hear.

That's why this concert was so rare and why it will probably never happen again.

In the ""Heart of Gold"" concert filmed at Ryman Auditorium in Nashville, it's obvious that Young is content to pay homage to the tradition of the venue and the expectations of his audience ... just this once.

So what you get, is a veritable greatest acoustical hits concert that covers the highest points of his entire 30+ year career up until the ""Prairie Wind"" CD ... and in the end, as if you needed a bonus, you get one of the most memorable moments ever.

Stick around through the credits as Young performs a haunting version of the obscure ""Old Laughing Lady"" completely alone on the stage before an eerily deserted Ryman.  And I suppose this is where viewing the DVD is better than the concert itself, since apparently none of the audience got to hear this.  Could this possibly be the only time he's done this particular version?  Usually this song is done in sort of an upbeat country-fied form that I don't particularly care for.

Maybe so, I don't know for sure.

What I do know is this is the very best moment of what this Neil Young fan considers the very best concert ever!",1307577600,,2097,4.407792207792208
2663599,5,B000IU4DMI,"All i can say is Neil Young still remains the same today as he was 35 years ago.
He is very gifted and talented and has a way with his associate musicians, that makes the ordinary person like me, want to get up there and join him in singing and playing right along. His patience is great and he has a way of making you
understand what he expects from you in various songs.  The Special Features in the DVD set was truley inspiring to watch. To see the groundwork and how it was laid all the way up to the live performance was wonderfully put together. All his singers and musicians are real down to earth people. Thats what was so special about the whole DVD set. I will continue to watch this masterful Perfomance over and over again. Neil Young shows you in this production that after all these years of giving of himself,in his own way, truely still has a ""Heart of Gold. Thanks so much for this Neil.",1305676800,,904,4.255813953488372
2663600,5,B000IU4DMI,". . . And that's exactly what Neil does in this splendid 2005 concert filmed by Jonathan Demme, in which he plays selections from PRAIRIE WIND and a mix of older material. This concert, performed at the legendary Ryman Auditorium (venerable home of the Grand Ol' Opry), has the close, warm intimate feel of an early-1960s coffeehouse gig.

Neil opens HEART OF GOLD with a series of talented renditions of his then most-recent work. Somewhere along the way this show suddenly transcends itself; the confessional asides to the audience, the mellowness of the acoustics, the cathedral-like setting, all coalesce into a seamless whole. Exactly when and why this happens is impossible to pin down. Perhaps the fact that Neil was facing an imminent potentially life ending brain surgery for an aneurysm brought a depth and an honesty to the performance that it might not otherwise have had. Perhaps the fact that he had just lost his father put him into a reflective state of mind. Perhaps the fact that Neil Young is an effortless musician with absolutely no affectation allowed the fourth wall to melt away.

Who knows? Who cares? Simply be in the moment with Neil and his family and friends.",1301443200,,1188,4.876237623762377

2663617,5,B000IU4DMI,"Neil Young debuted his 2005 album Prairie Wind in special performances for friends, the press, and other insiders at the historic location of Nashville's Grand Ole Opry. Director Jonathan Demme, a frequent collaborator, filmed the results, yielding the magnificent Heart of Gold. An intensely personal, close-up view of Young as well as a great film and performance in itself, it is essential for anyone even remotely interested in Young.

Fans will of course be mostly curious about the performance, which is superb. Young plays all of Prairie Wind plus a generous sprinkling of his other country rock-esque cuts with Prairie's excellent band and other long-time partners. He is in top form, singing his proverbial heart out as only he can do and playing great guitar, piano, and harmonica. Very few singers even rival his emotionality and phrasing, and he is as good as ever here; he has lost very little of his voice, especially compared to other singers his age, and certainly none of his intensity or stage presence. This last comes in part from frequent comments delivered in a sincere, seemingly spontaneous manner; some are surprising, even disarming, while others are humorous or revealing, and all are tenderly charming. The band - including standbys like Ben Keith, Spooner Oldham, Rick Rosas, and Chad Cromwell - is also top-notch and gives a truly great performance. Emmylou Harris fans will be thrilled to see her in a prominent role. Prairie is overrated and really only decent but truly seems to come alive here; Young's profound emotion and concentration bring out unexpected subtleties, making several cuts go from decent to good and others from bad to decent. The backing vocals, a prime album defect, are also noticeably improved. Perhaps more fundamentally, Young is the kind of artist who is simply mesmerizing to watch; he has that indefinable but all-important ""something"" that only the best performers have. Reciting his laundry list would be engrossing, and this certainly is. Even better, though, is the encore, which consists mostly of songs from the beloved Harvest and Harvest Moon plus a few from Comes a Time and elsewhere. Young performs some of his best and most popular songs (""Heart of Gold,"" ""The Needle and the Damage Done,"" ""Harvest Moon,"" ""I Am a Child"") as well as lesser-known ones that are often nearly as good. Highlights include ""No Wonder,"" ""It's a Dream,"" ""When God Made Me,"" ""Four Strong Winds,"" and ""One of These Days."" This is quite simply one of Young's best latter-day performances, and having it for posterity is a great treasure.

The film is also very well-done as a film. Demme understands Young as few do; he knows how to record his music, and his visual elements are sympathetic. Befitting the songs' simplicity, he keeps things very simple with minimal scenery and avoids distracting effects. He basically lets the music speak for itself, as it always should; unlike so many directors, he does not interrupt or truncate songs. Interviews with Young and other principals are used, and there is a significant amount of footage showing Nashville, the auditorium, etc. However, it is tasteful and respectful; Demme never lets it overwhelm the music, instead accentuating it. The interviews are interesting and informative, revealing much about Young and others, and the additional footage is valuable both as background and on its own often visually arresting terms. Demme's cinematography is also spot-on; he of course focuses on Young but knows when to show others and when close-ups are needed. The few special touches that he does add are first-rate and very fitting. It is worth noting that neither he nor Young refer to Heart as a concert film, and indeed it is atypical. The crowd is never shown, which makes things seem all the more intimate; we feel as if we are watching a very personal rehearsal even with Young's crowd comments and its slight noise. The main effect is lighting; coupled with apparent crowd absence, it gives a very strong dream atmosphere reinforced in the final song. Wardrobes are also very appropriate and even stunning.

There are also substantial extras, most of which are high quality. The main feature is the ""Rehearsal Diaries"" narrated by Demme - a fascinating inside peek at every aspect of show preparation. It gives a good idea of Young's notorious perfectionism and thus great insight into him as artist and bandleader. A shorter ""Finishing Touches"" segment does much the same. We also get additional interviews with him and others that are often as good as what was used. Less intriguing but still worthwhile is a segment where long-time Young guitar tech Larry Cragg gives a tour of Young's instruments and a short bit of Young warming up with the legendary Fisk University Jubilee Singers who add their distinctive vocals to ""When God."" Finally, we get Young's famous 1971 Johnny Cash Show performance of ""The Needle"" - a fine take and interesting contrast.

One simply could not ask for a better concert film of Young's Nashville songs. The performance is immaculate and the film well-done in every respect. Anyone interested in Young - and not just in these songs - must get it, as it transcends apparently self-imposed limitations and moves into true greatness.",1269302400,,5264,5.040183696900115
2663618,3,B000IU4DMI,"I have listened to Neil Young a lot since the Springfield days, and between Stills and Neil, they have been my favorites in music. They still are today.
However this DVD was a let down to me. I guess I knew what it was going to be like, but wanted to hear more of the 'old' Young sound, and of course, a fairly new DVD is not going to have that.
I recently got the Young CD/DVD set, called ""Young"", (about 8-10 CD/DVD's), that has Neil from Canada as wanna be (Not singing) to the Massey Hall concert and a lot more. GREAT!",1265587200,,523,4.087378640776699

2663622,4,B000IU4DMI,"Jonathan Demme called these performances by Neil Young a dream concert and I would agree. Filmed at the Ryman Auditorium in Nashville (also called the mother church of American music) over two nights in 2005 Heart of Gold presents the debut performance of Young's acoustic Prarie Wind album.

Working with musicians who are more of a family than simply players the interaction between the people on stage sets this show apart from most of the recent concert documentaries I have seen. Every song is lit specially for maximum effect. The shots linger longer than the quick cuts that we have become used to and Young and the band shine on each song.

There is no denying that Young has had an influence on today's music. The thing here is that Young truly seems to enjoy his performanve and that is a great thing to behold.

The two disc set includes a six part making of feature and a narrated Rehearsal Diary that are well worth the price of admission. While there is no per se commentary track we get many comments from Demme, Young and the bad members on the importance of the project and what the music means to them.

2663627,4,B000IU4DMI,"First of all the DVD is packed with annoying commercials for other Hollywood movies, at the cost of sacrificing sound. Dolby Digital 5.1 is only average, compared to the much richer PCM on Neil Young's other products.

This video is very polished. The stage performance is perfected in every little detail. It is glossy and expensive, and every musician and singer delivers precise rehearsed moves, feet in exact position, and every single step calculated. Which makes it a little dull. Neil Young is clearly the emperor in total control. Ben Keith though, seems to have his own thing going on steel guitar. And Neil Young's wife Pegi has a nice voice which can't be completely controlled. Overall the Prairie Wind songs sound more or less exactly the same as on the cd. No surprises, aside from the talk inbetween.

The best performance, I think, is The Old Laughing Lady, where Neil Young delivers wonderfully creative guitar playing.
One Of These Days is also good, even if Young is overacting his singing here, which makes it a bit contrived. But he really gives it all in this song, and that is enjoyable to watch.

From all other raving reviews below, I get the impression that people have a tendency to easily become lured by the flashy and expensive, and have a difficult time separating that from the genuine of depth and quality.

The Silver And Gold dvd is much better. It's not as commercial, and free of ads. Has PCM sound. The stage is simpler, Neil is alone, without a fancy suit. But every song is alive with creativity and rapture. And that's what counts.",1238112000,,1572,4.726277372262774

The new material presented here blends perfectly with the older songs in style and quality. His writing is unique and poetic and his voice is as mystical as ever. He has mellowed well and sings to those of his generation of experiences we can associate with. The performance is brilliant and moving. The sound is perfect. I had chills running down my spine.

Technically speaking, this dvd could be a ""how to"" guide for film students. The direction, camera work, editing, staging, auditorium, recording, musicians, interviews, ambience, et all, are perfect. It appears that every aspect of this production was well conceived and well rehearsed. Emmylou Harris and the Memphis Horns were two of several special touches added to some of the performances.

If you are an Eagles fan, I would give this a slight edge over the Farewell Tour DVD and that is saying a lot for me. Some talented people found a spot where all the stars aligned this night and really nailed it.

2663641,5,B000IU4DMI,"I have been a Young fan since my days in high school in the 1960's. This film blew me away. The songs are from a man who is realizing his own mortality. We are all growing older, especially those of us who grew up with Young. Young is singing songs about family, his daughter, wife, his father who passed away right before the concert, his dog and dreams. Growing older makes you think about all of these things and I believe Neil is looking at his life in retrospect. The filming of the concert was first rate, the band was unique and wonderful, the sound was well mixed. The songs brought tears to my eyes as I related some of the songs to my own life.
Neal, if you read this, thank you for all the music you have brought into my life. I have loved most all of it. Young has not been afraid to change styles through the years and I praise him for that. He is one of a handfull from the 60's and 70's still performing and writing new material.
Bottom line, buy this video. You will watch it over and over. It's that good.
Neil has never been afraid to go where the music has taken him, from the tearing up of ol Blackie to the songs that are the little short diddies that stick in your head.
Neil is a perfectionest in his own way, hears every note played by every instrument, every nuance.

I have to rate this as one of his best. It's an album I have to watch every couple of months. It makes me smile, brings a tear and makes me wish for the time when life was so much simplier. A time we will never get back to.
God Bless you and Your family Neil. Somehow I don't think this will be the last we will hear from Neil. I don't know how it could get any better, but Neil always surprises me.
By the way, the rendition of ""The old Laughing Lady"" during the credits was increadable, you made the gutiar do things it was never meant to, it was awe inspiring.
The album takes me back to the better days in my life and I think in the lives of all who were here during Neils entire time spent adding so much to our lives. Music is one of life's greatest pleasures, Neil is and has always been a huge pert of that during my 58 years. What a fantastic tribute to ""Daddy"" also. Mine is still alive, I thank the Lord for that, but who knows how much longer, only God.",1210723200,,2258,4.074157303370787

Neil Young and his family are at their best - a wonderful contribution of short and very meaningful dialogue interspersed between some of the most incredibly heart-felt music ever recorded.

2663649,5,B000IU4DMI,"I was amazed by this DVD. A friend let us borrow it and we watched it three times before returning it. Then I ordered it from Amazon and we watch it all the time.

In the beginning you learn that Neil is going in for an operation soon and his friends are all coming to help record this video. By hearing all of them talk about Neil, you know the friendships are strong and longlasting.

The music begins with the Prairie Wind album, every song is meaningful and touching. I love the looks between Neil and his wife. He talks about the guitar he is using, how it used to be Hank's. The entire video is moving. Neil also talks about his father, who he lost shortly before the project started, and about different memories in his life. He seems to be reminiscing about his life and it is all so heartwarming. The second half is marked by a change of clothes and songs, no longer from the Prairie Wind album.

The cinematography is fantastic... it's as if the cameras aren't even there. The few times Neil looks directly at the camera it's as if he's looking right at you.  It gave me chills. Sometimes I still get teary watching the last few songs. The special features are amazing and informative, a delight to watch.

I don't know what I would do if anything ever happended to this dvd... it is my favorite one. I like to have the music on in the background while I work or play games with my fiance.

If you know the background of this concert, then you know that Neil Young was soon to have brain surgery for an annurism when he opted to stage this event at the famed Ryman Auditorium. The players and singers he gathered for the event perform flawlessly and Jonathan Demme's direction is seamless. As for Neil himself, his singing is in top form and because of his life threatening condition, there's an aura of being 'in the moment' in his eyes and in some of his comments between songs. The first half of the concert is a showcase for songs from his new recording, PRAIRIE WIND. The second half is made up of many of his best songs from his acoustic repertoire, including HEART OF GOLD, OLD MAN, NEEDLE AND THE DAMAGE DONE, HARVEST MOON and even I AM A CHILD from his days with Buffalo Springfield.

I am very happy with my purchases from Amzon, the timely manner that they arrive, and my sheer enjoyment.  thank you I also want to mention the way Neil tries to explain some of the reasons he rote some of his songs and that is sweet, sincere and sometimes very surprising.

2663656,5,B000IU4DMI,"First, a confession:  I was a big Neil Young Fan when I was young.  I am now 59.  Over thirty years have passed, and I lost touch with him as a musician while my musical taste led me to classic jazz and Delta blues.  (For over five years in the 90s I was the Executive Producer for Robert Parker's Jazz Classics In Stereo weekly one hour radio programs on Public Radio International.)

Neil Young recently came back to my attention as one of the owners and  developers of a fantastic new electronic control system for Lionel O-gauge model trains called the Legacy system.  As a model railroader, I was impressed with the product and especially by Mr. Young's attention to his customer base and commitment to improving the product through direct customer feedback.  He is completely open to criticism and inculcates all valid issues into product optimization.  Who does that these days?

Since his music was important to me when I was young and stupid, would it still be, I wondered, now that I am old and stupid?

So I started digging around to see where his career had led him, and I came across this DVD, Heart Of Gold, and I bought it to reacquaint myself with the man and his music.  It is a film of Mr. Young's 2006 performance, with friends such as Emmylou Harris, in Nashville, and it was directed by Jonathan Demme, famous for movies like Silence of the Lambs.

I was unprepared for my reaction to Mr. Young's performance.

Simply put, it is stunningly beautiful music that comes across, as my title says, utterly sincere.  Mr. Young's youthful eclectic creativity has grown and matured.  His instrumental and vocal deliveries are deeply emotional without being in the least affected.  His songs are tone poems.  His on-stage fellow performers are all close friends who share his inner rhythm and his dreams, and it shows.  Their musicianship is as perfected as Mr. Young's, and in absolute harmony.

The result is something rare and difficult to describe.  The music and the performances are ethereal and deeply moving.  It comes directly from Mr. Young's heart without filters or distortion.

I recommend this DVD without reservation or qualification.",1201046400,,2161,4.8125

Usually I will like maybe 2-3 songs out of say 10 on a regular CD. This is much better. The new songs from Prarie wind are terrific. Jonathon Demme's work with the movie end of it is excellent. The sets are beautiful and there are no super quick cuts from one shot to another. I have sent one of these to 4 of my friends. Every time I play it I keep thinking don't end, don't end.

Singing folk-country songs about mortality, empty nests, and aged parents, Young's choppy rhythms and images of swaying Canadian cornfields harken back to his early '70s work on ""Harvest"" and ""Comes a Time."" It's obvious he's enjoying himself, and his between-song banter is tart, concise, and utterly charming. If you don't come away from ""Heart of Gold"" humming, you better have your ears checked.",1185148800,,650,5.445544554455446
2663675,3,B000IU4DMI,"I'll make no friends critisizing HEART OF GOLD as a dull concert movie. I liked the modern Nashville insight centered around the historic Ryman Auditorium, where Young and friends gather for a concert to premiere the album, PRARIE WIND, but the strength of this film is dependent on the success of Prarie Wind as an album, given it is played in it's entirety, and the music falls short of being outstanding, a sort of lesser, ""Harvest"", with routine Young acoustic melody, sentimental, less than profound lyrics, and war protest songs lacking inspiration and artistry. I'm glad Young is alive and well but Praire Wind is less a wind than a gust of crudely simple ideas and songcraft.",1184889600,,683,4.846153846153846
2663676,4,B000IU4DMI,"In the Prologue of Neil Young's beautiful concert DVD, 'Heart of Gold' key players, which are ample, reminisce over the highlights of concerts past.  Each musician is alone except interviewer and camera, and the feeling is eager but laid back.  Neil Young himself explains that the people he's chosen for this special concert are friends and not merely studio musicians, setting up a feel that Roy Orbison enjoyed for his magnificent 'Black and White Night' DVD.  There is the same sense of intimacy, and, while I suspected a retro act, the scope and splendor of the chosen material is great.  Although about two or three songs are familiar hits, he breathed real life into this concert at Reiman Auditorium in Nashville where the acoustics resonate with perfection.  Besides a great repertoire of songs, his styles draw from country, bluegrass, folk, gospel, blues, and rock.  Each song seems so singularly crafted and find Young switching from guitar to harmonica to banjo to piano.  Distinctively, he proves to have many friends who back him up with vocals, brass, guitars, fiddles, and, even, a broom.  Misguided casual fans like me are immediately struck by the economy of words that come in a stream on this ""Prairie Wind"" harvest.

More specifically, theme song ""Prairie Wind"" opens with words ""It's a long road behind me...It's a long road ahead of me.""  Indeed even with his weathered, tan face he sings enraptured in his own music which translates the wisdom of his years.  Whether singing about 9/11 (""Falling off the Face of the Earth"") or ""King, the best hound dog,"" (""He Was King"") he connects in spare language.  At one of his intimate moments he shares before ""This Old Guitar"" how he acquired the worn guitar he uses onstage from Hank Williams.  Highlights are for every song, but ""When God Made Me"" so eloquently scotches any argument for chauvenism or bigotry known to man.  In too few words to measure, he bridges the gap to every gender, race, and creed.  Alone with his harmonica he adds to the mellow sweetness with ""I'm Still in Love with You"" and the lovely, wide-eyed ""Harvest Moon"".  Oddly, ""Heart of Gold"" and ""Old Man"" seem anti-climatic, but are marvelous nonetheless.  His explanation for the latter song is worth checking out.  Seven guitars serenade ""Four Strong Winds,"" (which, incidentally, was one of the tracks on Johnny Cash's last C.D.). Neil Young goes out with big brass on ""One of These Days,"" but not without a couple of intimate moments:  One is ""Needle and the Damage Done,"" (which despite the movie warning, doesn't doing anything but deter drug use).  Then, I believe, it's ""The Old Laughing Lady"" that finds Neil on stage to an empty auditorium.

There's little to criticize.  Jonathan Demme deserves credit for capturing this ""golden"" event.  While I would have preferred more shots of supporting players, no one will argue about the focus of this film, and many fans may find that assessment all wet.  The small auditorium and the silent awe for this performance gives the whole affair the intimacy of Orbison in a nightclub setting.  This DVD is a must for fans and the uninitiated alike.

  In the added features DVD there is a film diary of the 10 days of rehearsal leading up to the concert. I showed it to some of my middle school students.

Reaching one's limitations and going beyond. Love. Grace and forgiveness. Friendship. Doing your best. It is all here in Demme's cleanly filmed movie. With Neil Young right at the center. Cast and crew move around him - music and life central - and the camera catches everything. Loving glances, extra wrinkles (those age-given gifts we boomers are more and more sharing), smiles, and the absolute sheer joy of making music.

When so many performers seem to sell out, take the money and run, Neil has taken our money. But he never ran from anything in his whole life. When you get Neil you get it all: heart, an sharp-edged irony, imagery that can still blow you away, and a prophetic anger that seems more pointed and more focused than ever before in his career. The protest has always been there but now it is mature and powerful.

The band is incredible and having Emmylou there is a gift. This is what music can be. Thanks, Neil, for allowing us access, no mess, no fuss, just that straight-forward honesty in the presentation that's exactly the same as the music. A lot of times directors can't find the heart or the gold. In this case, the music, the man, and the movie vibrate to the same harmonies.",1173571200,,1368,4.695833333333334

2663689,5,B000IU4DMI,"We don't need yet another person telling you that this DVD is a fantastic, intimate, look at Neil Young.

The passion in his music is clear, and I can not add anything to what nearly 100 other reviews have said.

HOWEVER, I happen to also like the ""CSN&Y"" Neil young, and remember seeing CSN&Y as the very first

concent I ever went to at the Roosevelt Raceway, Long Island, NY. (The stage was on one side of the inside of

the oval raceway, and I was not far from the front stage left on the field.  There were people of course in the

stands, hanging off of anything they could.  They performed much of what was to make it on to the 4-WAY Street Album,

which is the album I feel in love with CSN&Y. The break up was devistating to me. Looking back, it was another side of Neil,

as was his Electric side which is not represented here. So if you happen to only like Neil's Electric side, this DVD is not for you.

I myself enjoy all of Neil, but I indeed do prefer his electric side.  He has provided us with many DVD's of live

concerts for his electric side.  He is multi-talented and hence has multiple sides, and he knows how to express

 them in music. How lucky we are!  I wish some other artists I grew up with in the 70's as a person born near

the tail of the baby boom would come to life like this on DVD.

Sadly they are not all around anymore, or the technology during the 70's does not do justice to Hi-Def

780/1080 video and 5.1/7.1 or DTS audio encoding. :(  With Neil, we are lucky his career has extended

over 3 decades.

I love acoustic neil, but I will always remember Rocking in the free world, when even us New Yorkers were

Southern men, and won't forget the Vietnam War, Kent State, or the four that died in Ohio on the electric side,

and when I hear the acoustic side remember those 4 guys up on stage, nervous, knees knocking,

when they performed at Woodstock.

I can never help but wonder what would have happened if CSN&Y had

stayed together. Would we have missed all the great sides we have seen of Neil? Or would they have still

come out only along with the added talents of David Crosby, Stephen Stills and Graham Nash??  I wonder....",1171843200,,2172,4.229268292682927
2663690,4,B000IU4DMI,"I recently purchased this item on Amazon and felt compelled to point out that it is not a documentary or a movie so much as a performance DVD. I was expecting more information on his life and career, but the only back-story is short, in the beginning and vague.

This is without doubt one of the best rock music films I've seen, better than The Last Waltz and a whole lot of others.  Despite having misgivings about Neil since reading the biography ""Shakey"", this man comes across as sincere and humble, and a great music maker to boot.  I bought Harvest when I was 12 (when it came out) - it was the second LP I ever bought, and it remained one of Neil's best IMO despite some pretty impressive output since.

2663712,4,B000IU4DMI,"It is indeed a wonderful performance, as we see Neil Young's heart laid bare in a number of songs drawn from ""Heart of Gold,""""Harvest,"" and most recently ""Prairie Wind.""  This is a more subdued, contemplative Neil Young playing to a Nashville audience at the historic Ryman Auditorium, and at one point introducing ""This Old Guitar"" as the same one played by Hank Williams back in 1951. He covers a number of interesting tracks including ""Four Strong Winds"" by Ian Tyson, recalling his Canadian home, and a fun duet with Emmylou on ""Old King,"" with Neil playing banjo.  The band is an interesting mix, including his mainstays, but also featuring Emmylou Harris, his wife Pegi, the Memphis Horns and the Fisk University Jubilee Singers.  The concert is beautifully filmed by Jonathon Demme with plenty of warm tones, closing with Neil alone on stage singing ""The Old Laughing Lady"" as the credits roll slowly by.  The extras are fun to watch as well, especially a piece from the 1971 Johnny Cash Show, in which a young Neil plays ""Needle And The Damage Done,"" which he also plays in the concert. However, the concert as a whole doesn't measure up to some of his past performances, especially the live version of ""Rust Never Sleeps.""",1162598400,,1231,4.819905213270142

I have seen Neil Young in concert more times than I can count--from ""those bad boys of rock n'roll""--Crazy Horse to the Blue Notes to Unplugged and loved them all but this is really the cream of the crop. It is a heartfelt look back on his life featuring new songs about his family (especially his father and daughter) to the old songs such as ""Comes a Time"" and the song he listened to repeatedly on a juke box in a small Canadian restaurant (""Think I'll go down to Alberta, Weather's good there in the fall ..."") when he first set off on his own as a teen.  Pegi and his good friends surround him in this performance and the warmth and joy they share performing together is apparent. Old friends having a good time making some great music.  Neil converses with the audience, as always, but shares many more personal items and smiles a lot more.  I loved the longer face shots of Neil, Emmy Lou Harris, Pegi and others.  A definite all encompassing summary of Neil's career as he performs new music as well as classics and talks about his roots.  You've gotta see this one.",1161734400,,1112,4.45320197044335

The camera is steady and clean all the time, even using steady track for moving shots.  What I ended up with on this concert was total immersion.  The camera didn't interfere with the songs and therefore allowed the viewer to just sit back and enjoy.  There was no need to try and follow some complicated scenework.  The actual Quality of the Video is superb.  There are no bad lighting shots, no jerky shots, just clear, movie quality video.

The Audio is supreme.  I have appr 50 music concerts on DVD/VHS and the Audio on this DVD would be up there with the top 5.

If you are a fan of Neil's softer side, you will absolutely love this DVD and fringe fans will at the very least appreciate the show for what it is.  A tribute to one of the best folk/Songwriters of our times.

Besides the music, which I thoroughly enjoyed, the commentary by Mr. Young and his associates was a pleasure to hear and enjoy as well.  I found the second dvd very interesting and informative.  It was also very touching to see Ms. Pegi Young on stage with her husband participating in the musical work.  Truly one of the best entertainment dvds I've seen and own and will continue to enjoy, from time to time.

2663725,4,B000IU4DMI,"Neil Young presents his characteristic childlike tracery of tunes here. Sometimes these new songs he wrote seem almost too simple and improvised. I was reminded of a five-year-old, wanting attention, standing in the center of the room singing, adding stanza after stanza to avoid having to leave the limelight. ""And then you said... and then you went to the door...""

But as you let these songs seep into you, you realize they really aren't something your five-year-old could have or would have written. It's like some modern art. No, your child couldn't have painted these pieces. Neil Young is the Paul Klee of song. His music may seem like the separate colored pieces of a child's mobile dangling overhead. But the best of them, the ones that are not political but are deeply personal, are the product of a mature adult looking back with the innocence of a child. And these tendrils of song end up being capable of climbing the stoniest of walls, taking root there, and surviving.

This movie is a photographic record of Young's inaugural presentation of his Prairie Winds album before a live audience at the Ryman Auditorium in Nashville. It's an adult movie in that it would appeal to a viewer who doesn't require lots of special effects, lots of teenage blast and bluster from a concert. It's a concentration on individual faces, on an individual voice.

The photography is pure gold. Neil Young, his back-up singers, and his band members are shown in close-up, bathed in warm, buttery light. It's beautiful to behold.

There are two discs in the DVD release of this movie. The one disc is devoted to extras. It includes footage of rehearsals, and various commentaries from band members as they are being driven around Nashville to jog reflections on their long careers with Neil Young. Some of these commentaries tend to be a little reminiscent of This is Spinal Tap. Aren't all pop band reminiscences? It's always a reaching for some profound biographical insights that don't exist. ""Yeah man, I remember how he came into the store that day... I'll never forget...""

It is interesting to see the old Ryman Auditorium restored to its fully glory and to hear something of its history. But perhaps the most interesting segment among the extras is the run-down of the various guitars Neil Young and the other band members use in their concerts - and the biographies of these guitars. The guitars seem to have more personality outside the concert performance than the humans do.

So in general, stick to the music in this movie. And if you don't require an MTV fracturing and flash with your music, you will be rewarded with a treasure trove of gold.",1155859200,,2653,4.8197802197802195
2663726,5,B000IU4DMI,"Neil Young remained relevant for thirty years.  And he still is relevant, and vibrant!  His life is relevant--singing a song to his daughter, who is finishing up college.  His politics are relevant--a song in opposition to George Bush's policies.  Much opposition, but why can't a Canadian say something sensible in these times of trouble?  I wonder--is wisdom the unique asset of the USA!  And relevant to his career.  He offers here not only his new muses, which are great, but his old--a flawless rendition to ""Heart of Gold"" and ""Old Man"" from Harvest, but also ""Four Strong Winds"" from his youth.  All in all, a very strong package of music and  more.",1155686400,,656,4.785714285714286
2663727,4,B000IU4DMI,"This concert DVD was recorded in Nashville after Young recovered from a potentially dangerous brain aneurysm, and recorded the emotional semi-acoustic Prairie Wind album. The first half of this film features some brief comments from the participants (quite a large band akin to the Springsteen's Seeger Sessions group) and then they jump right into the music, playing the album in its entirety. The film, directed by Jonathan Demme (of Silence of the Lambs fame) looks great, with vivid color and multiple camera angles. The sound is fabulous as well, especially if you have your DVD player hooked up to your stereo. The second half of the concert is made up of favorites from the mellow side of the back Young catalog like ""Old Man,"" ""Harvest Moon,"" and ""Four Strong Winds."" He's joined by guests like Emmylou Harris (my goodness, is there a more beautiful nearly-60-year-old woman than Emmylou Harris?) The interviews and extras are a little on the skimpy side, but the main concert is so well presented and recorded that you won't miss it. Good stuff, definitely worth checking out.",1155513600,,1085,5.0
2663728,5,B000IU4DMI,"There are plenty of people who just don't get Neil.  Crazy concept albums, wild style swings, lyrics about spaceships and Marlon Brando.  You know, from a distance, he has given plenty of justification to his naysayers.  I love Neil, but I haven't embraced his full body of work.  I am partial to his acoustic stuff.  Having said that, maybe it was my mood or the lack of time to invest, but the CD ""Prairie Wind"" just did not grab me when it came out.

I watched Heart of Gold the other night-how can you go wrong-Neil with his finest friends (on the acoustic side of his life), the Ryman, and Jonathan Demme (strange to think that Stop Making Sense and Silence of the Lambs are two of my favorite movies)...  The results of this formula? Stunning, emotional, eloquent magic.

The Ryman Auditorium-been there, stood on the stage, got shivers from the ghosts of music and lives past.  Neil and his band playing on this stage bring reverance and breathe life into many of the ghosts.

The music of Prairie Wind gets the added jolt of Neil's song introductions, the stories of his father, his ranch, his daughter and his life (don't forget Hank's guitar).  There is great humor and poignancy in the introductions that had me choked up as he sang these songs.

The camera work, staging, sound and editing (beautifully explained in the DVD extras) are all incredible-complex logistically resulting in a simple beauty very appropriate for the man and his music.  The incredible finish with Neil singing to an empty auditorium is THE best use of credits I have ever seen-

Now Prairie Wind really means something so much different and I will dedicate the time and ears to hear it all over again.

Neil is a great performer, as I've always known from his superb live releases such as Rust Never Sleeps, Live Rust, and Weld. What one gets from this film though is more than just live performances. Neil himself is very endearing; he is passionate about his craft and his songs really mean a lot to him. Neil Young has never been in it for the money or fame, he is in love with the music. Many great artists seem to take on the aura of a God or mythical creature or such; Neil does no such thing in this film though, he looks utterly human and vulnerable, yet in his case this is not a shortcoming but rather something that makes him all the more vital and gives his songs even more impact. We've always known that Neil makes great music, but seeing him perform in such an intimate setting significantly enhances the experience.",1155513600,,931,4.450292397660819

The camera work and editing is wonderfully relaxed, especially compared to much of today's MTV-influenced frantic editing style (see U2's ""Vertigo 05 Live from Chicago"" - that DVD gave me motion sickness). It almost doesn't seem like a concert...you don't see the crowd but a few times. Almost like you're eavesdropping on old friends playing the music they love.",1155340800,,471,4.9

  This DVD captures Neil receiving his life-time achievement award from the Creator. You will be honored, as I was, to witness Neil accepting his award with humility, grace, and humor throughout the film.........Look closely.......you won't see any golden trophies.  The award is WISDOM.

  A man who has traveled as many roads as Neil has, has truely earned his knowledge. What sets him apart from the rest of us travelers is that he can sing, play guitar, and write about his travels.

  The biggest nugget of wisdom I found is also the title of my review. How many people out there right now are chasing too many dreams?

  Thankyou, Neil, for sharing your wisdom, for showing how important friends and family are in life, and for sharing the road.",1154563200,,945,4.825

2663736,5,B000IU4DMI,"As I write, the ""Heart of Gold"" DVD plays in the background for about the twentieth time. I have thusfar been unable to tire of it. Neil Young, surrounded by good friends and family, delivers two superb concert performances. The music is symphony-like, with the accompaniment of background vocals( Emmylou Harris),stringed instruments, and brass instruments. As he discloses the genesis of his music, Young sings of things with which we can all relate( e.g.,the passing of his father,and his love of his daughter). This DVD is a must for fans of Neil Young. As a son of the Prairie, the ""Prairie Wind"" songs captured me. With the addition of earlier music such as ""Comes A Time"", ""Harvest Moon"", and "" One of These Days"", this makes for great viewing and listening. Neil Young delivers the music with heart-felt emotion. This excellent DVD introduced me to Ian Tyson's music as an added bonus. Don't let this pass you by.",1153526400,,921,4.8354430379746836

2663740,5,B000IU4DMI,"Since Neil first began shooting 8mm shorts he has been looking for a place to meld his alter egos Cinemagraphic efforts.  From Journey through the Past to Greendale capturing snippets to infer dramatic element has been sketchy.  With Heart of Gold thanks to Jon Demme and Bernard Shakeys insightful collaboration an epic was born. Mr. Shakey contributed some of the opening Nashville sequences which gave the movie a triangulative magruder feel.  The films house concert style gives the feeling that he is at peace with his mortality and desires more intimacy with his audience. He should be, he has been mining for years and his fans are among the most loyal ever born.  The opening special effect in the movie where the viewer is literally dropped off at the footlights to share the audiences perspective was trancendental. This will be especially evident on a large widescreen.  This movie does not get caught up in the star power trip or pity party for Neil Youngs near death experience but a payback to all who have influenced Neil and been involved in the machine that has helped sustain this Canadian American musical icon.  He has delivered on the wishes of music fans who desire moving pictures of their favorite artists to go with the words.  Heart of Gold is such a film!
P.S.  The bonus DVD with Neil premiering Damage Done on the Johnny Cash show is priceless and makes the whole package a must have if not to finally learn the correct fingering on the song!!(G)",1153180800,,1475,4.756862745098039

2663742,5,B000IU4DMI,"I was fortunate enough to first see this movie in a small theater in Pleasantville, NY. It was advertised that Jonathan Demme would introduce the movie himself, so my wife and I headed down to a sold out showing. Mr. Demme came out, and shyly gave an all-to-brief explanation of how he came to make the movie, and what his objectives were. He wanted to capture Neil in a very natural state, and was pretty nervous, since he only had two perfomances to use for the film.

Well, the nevousness doesn't show, but he certianly captured Neil Young in his most natural state as a performer. It probably would have been quite simple to pack on the makeup, adjust the lighting, and have Neil appear 20 years younger. Hollywood does it all the time. But not here. Neil appears now as the elder statesmen, having nothing left to prove, only ""inviting the muse"" as he calls it.

And the music (the muse) does the real talking here, and the performace is superb. Relaxed yet intense, Mr. Young and company glide through a timeless collection of songs that are not out of place on the old stage of 'The Grand Ole Opry'. His vocals are perfect, at times defying his age, and the backing musicians all are in tune to exactly what Neil is doing.

And a big thank you for releasing this DVD in DTS 5.1 surround. I find it superior to Dolby 5.1 since it is not as compressed. The rear channels bring out the acoustics of the hall very well.

One of those rare occasions where everything is perfectly aligned - the performers, the sound, the song selection, the presentation - this is a music DVD for the ages. I remember thinking Mr. Demme's personal introduction of the movie was disappointing, but his skill behind the camera more than make up for this minor shortcoming.",1153008000,,1755,4.526813880126183

I don't care if he looks old and makes me feel old what Neil does, nobody does and that is move me like none else.  This is wonderfully done like you're in another time period.  You get totally sucked into the video and forget everything else that is going on in your life (isn't that the point).  I always smile when I listen as he seems to be going through what all of us are at this age and can express it so beautifully.  I could listen to ""4 winds"" forever.  Neil you just keep up with us old hippies, you're the king of them.  buy this and  enjoy the experience!  (p.s. I'm glad we didn't lose ya' Neil - we need you!) ....tryin' to remember what my daddy said...

2663744,5,B000IU4DMI,"I remember reading that a film (Heart of Gold) was being made with Neil Young and my first thought was, ""Incredible, I will see it."" It was definitely worth the wait. If you're a fan of Neil's work you're doing yourself a great disservice if you've not seen it yet. It's a great movie. We see Neil in a way not many have before, he lets us in a bit more and we see a true genius. There are, for me some really emotional moments also. The incredible song ""It's A Dream"" just grabbed me and said, ""are you listening?"" I was.

He talks a bit about his father's passing and gets a bit emotional, but he overcomes it with some light and well placed humor, as he kicks into another great song from Prairie Wind, ""Far From Home.""

The entire movie had me both anxious for the next song, yet at the same time not wanting the one on to end. The special features are great as well. A performance from ""The Johnny Cash Show"" doing ""The Needle And The Damage Done"", some cool interviews with Neil, the band, and of course Jonathan Demme who did a fantastic job on this film.

I've been a Neil Young fan for as long as I can remember. I grew up listening to Neil Young's music. It's been a part of me. For that I have to say, ""Thanks Neil.""

For everyone else I say, ""Heart Of Gold"" is a masterpiece.",1152921600,,1287,4.156626506024097

as his music from the early 70's(better according to my spouse!)

If you love Neil's softer side of music, this is a must see.  Cinematography was superb, I felt like I was sitting in the front

row at the concert.  You can see the love between the rock legend and his musical co-horts of many years. This is truly a Young classic.",1152835200,,394,4.2

The thing that was most striking to me about the whole program was how emotionally charged the music was.  I mean, Neil is sharing is heart with us all, his Heart of Gold, which is worth more than money can buy.  As I watched this (I've watched it several times,) thoughts about what he was singing about, and how it related to my own life drifted through my mind.  Maybe that's because Neil and I aren't that far apart in age, so I feel like we may be kindred spirits.  Anyway, if you aren't sure whether you want to buy this movie or not, I'd suggest going out and renting it first.  Either way, you will hopefully find out for yourself, first hand this wonderful show, and you will get to experience, Neil's heart of Gold.",1152835200,,881,4.271084337349397

There were 2 things I didn't like about it: 1) I wished I'd been there at the concert 2) The film didn't last as long as I would have liked. To see Neil Young and Emmy Lou Harris along with all the other talent, to hear Neil talk about songs and how they came to be and the feeling of family within the talent singing was extremely entertaining. It is a great inside of the man behind the words. When ""Heart of Gold"" came out on DVD I purchased 3 copies, one for myself and 2 as gifts. It is a must see for anyone who has enjoyed Neil Youngs music.",1152835200,,629,3.9606299212598426

The location chosen for filming the concert was excellent. It just transmitted an easy going atmosphere, & it made you feel like you were a part of the audience.

We need you now more than ever.",1152662400,,365,4.6
2663750,5,B000IU4DMI,"Visually excellent, musically stunning.  His performance of ""It's A Dream"" literally brought me to tears.  While I've always been drawn in mostly by the laid back material from Young's catalog, it used to be I could take or leave him, but this film convinced me of his genius for both composition and performance.  What a film by Demme.  Like ""The Last Waltz"" in some ways, only much more refined images and sound.  Please Lord, may the music film community learn that holding a shot is what the fan wants.  What a band with Emmylou, the horns, strings, and Hank's Martin. Man!.  While the guys playing drums and percussion were excellent, as a long-time drummer I couldn't help wonder if he would've had Harvest's great Kenny Buttrey on hand if he were still with us.

If you are a fan of great music and the excellent documentation of same, don't miss this film.  Watch the ""extras"" DVD completely first as it really sets up the main event well.",1152489600,,947,4.622754491017964

2663752,5,B000IU4DMI,"I was pleasantly amazed by how ingeniously this film comes together. It is more than simply a ""concert DVD,"" which are plentiful and often quite good.  This takes the separate, yet equally appealling (When done properly) audio and video arts and masters them.  The music; the actual concert, is brilliant.  Sometimes, it's breathtaking.  Neil Young is more than a mere rock star, performer or entertainer.  He is the ancient tribal story teller.  He's the philosopher who examines his soul on a daily basis and then translates it to words and music.  This gift allows us to connect to him, not just because some music may be autobiographical, but because he digs deep down and shows us we aren't all as different, or alone as we think.  I once had aspirations to write, but it was the tight, succinct, poignant voices of the great troubadors of our day that finally humbled me to where I finally gave up. People like Young and Dylan have the ability to say more in a sentence than the rest of us could in an entire book!

I'm rambling.  If you've every enjoyed Neil Young at all, then just get this.  Order it here, buy the used copy at your local video store, or down at your local Stuff-Mart.  Just buy this DVD.  It is outstanding, full of wonderful surprises and it has given me a much greater, more meaningful respect for this artist I've loved for so many years.  The cinematography; the placement of cameras at the venue, the other elements beside the music and the way it was all put together was ingenious.  I can not say enough about this movie.  So I will shut up now and hope you enjoy it as I have.",1151971200,,1611,4.484536082474227
2663753,4,B000IU4DMI,"Face it, there's no one else who's godfathered artists as diverse as Kurt Cobain and the Dixie Chicks, no one else who's a master of both introspective country-folk and primal scream garage rock. The 2003 'Greendale' soundtrack put us on notice that Young was back from his latest decade of wandering in the woods. Like most Young\Crazy Horse albums, 'Greendale' was ear splitting social commentary reminiscent of classics like 'Rust Never Sleeps' and 'Freedom'. But when Young wants to talk about himself as opposed to the world his medium is carefully crafted country tinged folk like 'Harvest' or 2005's superb 'Prairie Wind'. Jonathan Demme's 'Heart of Gold' chronicles the Nashville premiere of this biographical acoustic masterpiece and soon we'll look back and mark it as the moment of Young's ascension from legend to Willie Nelson like icon. Demme understands and appreciates music more than any mainstream director. The intimate cinematography is perfect for the material and the sound absolutely shimmers. Prairie Wind is presented in it's entirety but the highlight is a sequence of songs performed by Young, his wife Pegi, Emmylou Harris and an army of acoustic guitars which create a jangling wall of sound not heard since the 60's Byrds. In Young's country folk classic 'Comes a Time' and Ian and Sylvia's early 60's hit 'Four Strong Winds' the craftsmanship of  director and performers comes together in a manner that's almost transcendent, especially on a good pair of headsets. My only regret is the absence of 'Powderfinger', a song that's been covered by almost as many country artists as 'Heart of Gold'. That song's moving Band-inspired Americana would have been remarkable over the backdrop of all those guitars. And an auditorium rattling encore of 'Rockin' in the Free World' would also have been cool but it just wouldn't have fit. If you have a heart and a pair of ears you're going to love this.",1151798400,,1923,5.066246056782334
2663754,5,B000IU4DMI,"You've probably heard it as many times as the title song, but every word is true: ""Neil Young: Heart of Gold"" is sensational. A hall of fame concert film. Jonathan Demme, a shameless fan, filmed Young and his extended family of musicians as they premiered ""Prairie Wind"" in Nashville. The documentary material mostly is left to the DVD extras, making ""Heart of Gold"" a purely musical affair.

Demme fashioned his film ""as a dream concert ... being dreamt by Neil ... a narrative of the heart."" The stealth emotional impact was by design, Young says: ""They think they're watching a concert and they come out wondering what happened.""

The songs (and film) were touched by Young's near-fatal aneurysm and his father's death. But the overarching vibe is one of family, musical tradition and rebirth. Once the heavy lifting is done, some serious fun breaks out as Young reprises his famous songs recorded in Music City.

Images (1:85.1) and especially audio (DTS, Dolby) are first rate. Guitar players should get out their acoustics for the second half -- it's all in standard tuning and Demme likes to show the fretboard.

The main bonus feature is a three-part rehearsal diary narrated by Demme, who was ""really nervous"" about running afoul of Young, whom he calls an ""exacto but compassionate general.""",1151625600,,1301,4.954128440366972
2663755,4,B000IU4DMI,"Wonderful Ryman auditorium is an equal star along with Neil Young.

Shot one continuous shot like older rock films.

The intellectual geeky Demme pulls off a good film. His others are far better but different.

But don't run atop the mountain and tell us you invented thunder Jonathon;

As he gushes in the DVD extras. ""revolutionary?""

Since Johnny Cash's organic Rick Rubin records everyone wants to make a homey stripped down product. And this does it well too.

The new Young material stands up with his previous work of last 15 years.

He's a wonderful musician.

Demme plays uber fan and is intimidated by Young...so he just shot the concert with zero concept which was probably a good move as Young isn't fond of cameras.

Good rental.

2663756,5,B000IU4DMI,"The good thing about Neil Young's DVDs is that they are way more than a music DVD. It shows so much more than the actual concert. The behind the scene footage is wonderful. What I probably love most about this DVD is the interviews with band members, especially Ben Keith. Ben has played with Neil off and on for over thirty years. Ben is famous for his steel guitar on Harvest, ie ""Heart of Gold"". I love these perspectives from these band members because a person is only as successful because of who he has around him. Now the show. What better place to shoot a DVD than the ORIGINAL Grand Ole Opry. His choice of music is outstanding, especially the live performance of Heart of Gold. A live performance of Heart of Gold is rare, unless you are fortunate enough to have a copy of Austin City Limits, or the BBC performance. Neil will be forever associated with that song and for some reason he doesn't like that. So I am very glad to see HOG available for purchase on DVD. The only problem I had with the DVD was the bonus live performance. The Needle and The Damage Done is abundantly available on video. The Johnny Cash show version might night be, but it is available on just about every Neil concert video, plus Live Aid, SNL, among others. I just believe for a ""Archive Release"" they could have come up with something better. Even though it doesn't stop the video from getting 5 stars.",1151193600,,1394,4.428015564202335
2663757,5,B000IU4DMI,"To be perfectly honest: I'm not THAT much of a Neil Young fan. Yeah he's got some good songs and records but for me they tend to be few and far-between. For every great record like Zuma or Harvest he's got tons that simply don't work like Trans, This Note's For You or Are You Passionate. His latest record, Prairie Wind has been hailed as his return-to-form, a classic Neil Young record. He debuted it at the Grand Ole Opry and it's certainly a breath of fresh air from the other concerts available on DVD.

Performing his Prairie Wind album live in its entirety as well as some hits, Neil Young takes the stage with his band as well as some guests. No stage trickery like pyrotechnics and laser shows, it's just straight Neil Young and he's quite captivating. Even if certain songs don't gel, there's a aura he is where he's like a calmer kind of intense, he's not energetic or dynamic like most but you almost can't keep your eyes of him. Again, his voice is one of those love-it-or-hate-it deals and while I do like Megadeth and Rush who don't have the most range-y singers, Neil's I can tolerate too.

One nice thing about the show is that the editing has finally been given a shot of morphine. Unlike the hyperkinetic cameras of other DVD concerts, this often has loooong shots on Neil or the band and there's a more relaxed feeling about the show and it works because of it. As for the music itself, I don't mind Neil Young but he's not really an artist where every single song he does I'm a fan of, it's more like ""I like this one and that and that but all this? No"".

Should you buy this? If you're a Neil Young fan yes. If you're not and want to get into him? Hm, maybe buy Harvest first and if you like what you hear, get this but since this concert is the full Prairie Wind album with only a handful of hits, it may not be the best ""cherry popper"" so to speak.",1151193600,,1872,4.252808988764045

I have so many Neil Young songs I love that I never convinced myself to buy `Prairie Wind' in 2005.  The concert on this DVD was filmed before the CD was available, and people like me were right to wait for the DVD.  Instead of just hearing the music, you get to see who is playing and singing.  Comments by Neil Young about his father having dementia are as touching as the Bridge School Concerts on a 1997 CD that had notes thanking ""the audiences who have made the Bridge School Concerts possible.""  People who get the DVD `Heart of Gold' have the opportunity to observe first performances of songs that were written as the recording was underway in a public performance that was prepared in the ten days before the musicians took the stage of the Ryman Auditorium in Nashville.  Even if the music is not going to be your favorite song ever, because your mind is now too old to be captured by the complexity of new musical creations, the opportunity to see an old master and his henchmen turning out new songs, remembering all the words, and playing them for an audience which has a sense of the history of the music that has been played on some of the same guitars that are right there on stage, for the first time since 1951, for instance, ought to be appreciated.",1151020800,,1402,4.271698113207547

I must say that I have not at all been disappointed with the music or the recording or the camera work or how it has all been integrated, but I have been astonished at the poor rendition to DVD. Contrast and brightness are exaggerated and there is some pixelization. Overall on brightly lighted subjects, especially Mr. Young, there is a  pronounced diffraction sparkle, as if the post production had been done at someone's home on iMovie 2. Its as if the Star Trek crew were preparing to beam up the performers.

Its a marvelous concert, beautifully rendered on audio. I'd have bought it even if I'd seen the final product. But I am truly disappointed in the rendition of this

extraordinary audio recording to DVD.

Oh, I knew the hits that played on AM radio when I was a teenager, but the depth of his artistry had not taken root in me until more recent years. Given my personal history that is probably just as well, since I'm not sure I'd have known how to appreciate him as much as I do now. It has taken some time for me to experience the kind of love, regret, and gratitude that Niel Young's songs speak to so well.

So for me this concert film was a moving experience. It renewed my appreciation of the ""Prairie Wind"" album as a significant milestone in Neil's discography, providing much more personal context from Neil's life. And, re-experiencing those older songs in light of my older age (and his) also helped them to say new things.

The simplicity and beauty of Neil's singing ... the love that you sense on-stage between Neil, his band, and the backup singers ... the level of respect from the audience ... the editing that avoids MTV-style quick cuts ... all of these combine to make this a profoundly beautiful experience.",1150416000,,1159,4.488151658767772
2663764,5,B000IU4DMI,"There are two Neil Youngs.  One is the hard,loud,caotic,screaming electic rocker.  The other is the intimate, vulnerable man who remains amazed by the simpler softer  moments in life.  ""Heart of Gold"" is, thankfully, all about the second Neil Young.

Anyone who has gone through the Buffalo Springfield years or the Crosby, stills and Nash years or the solo alblum years already has their own special relationship with Mr. Young.  This is not a man to disregard or to take lightly.  There are too many of his compositions that make you stop and ponder a small speck of light in an otherwise darkened world.

Do yourself a favor...get this DVD and spend an evening listening to this incredible performer and then go out and buy Harvest, Harvest Moon and Praisie Wind.  Then find yourself a comfortable chair on a warm summer evening and...listen.",1150416000,,845,4.894366197183099
2663765,5,B000IU4DMI,"I am an old time Neil Young fan, and own all his LPs, CDs and DVDs. I pre-ordered Heart of Gold from Amazon and received it on Monday (one day before the official release date).  I listened to it as soon as I got home from work and listened to again late that night.  It is the best Neil Young DVD yet and maybe the best performance by him I have ever heard. Maybe we are both getting old, but I was really touched by the way he and his longtime friends just came out and played and sang like they were really enjoying themselves. No arrogant, loud mouth rockstars here. The music was softer, smoother and more touching than any of his previous work. I had assumed that this would be a DVD version of his recent Prarie Wind CD, but it wasn't.  A lot of the songs were the same, but he also played a lot of old stuff that I love, like ""Heart of Gold"" and ""Old Man"".  The most beautiful piece on the DVD is the old folk song ""Four Strong Winds"" with all the guest musicians on stage harmonizing and at least a dozen acoustic guitars all playing together. The cinematography was excellent and you could tell this was being directed by a pro, Johnathn Demme.  If you are a Neil Young fan, you must have this and will love it.  If you are not a Neil Young fan, watch this and you will be.

PS:  The DTS soundtrack is incredible and if do not have a DTS surround sound system, get one.  It would be worth it just for this one DVD.",1150156800,,1424,4.093525179856115
2663766,5,B000IU4DMI,"The movie is still doing a limited cinema season in Australia and is not listed for release here on DVD until mid August...have been twice to the cinema, once with a very good friend, and a couple of weeks later with my wife.

There is no doubt to me that this movie is (at least) 5 stars......I felt more emotion from this movie than most.

A young lady on a local Movie Show was disappointed that the movie did not reveal more on Neil Young's life......comment was the movie was only of a concert and comparison was made to Martin Scorsese's film on Bob Dylan.....

I think Heart of Gold revealed much about Neil Young's life... life, death, family, friends, childhood, illness etc...... it's a shame that the young lady missed all that.

The movie is so lovingly filmed and Neil Young is in the best of form, and looked great after an obviously trying year... the supporting cast was also outstanding....

The Painter, No Wonder, Falling from the Face of the Earth, Only a Dream, He for You, This Old Guitar......man, what great emotional songs......tears in my eyes at times...so much genuine love and passion....and the two songs less enjoyable for me on the album, Far from Home and the title track were seen from a new perspective and very enjoyable....

From Prairie Wind to some of the better known acoustic songs, Old Man, Comes a Time etc.....hey, what can you say......and the closing song....not a noise in the cinema......everyone was absolutely spellbound...

This is a rare movie worth watching many times...the movie does express the richness of life....",1150070400,,1571,4.796296296296297
2663767,5,B000IU4DMI,"I've never been a big Neil Young fan and I went to this movie with an expectation that it would be OK but nothing special.  I was pleasantly surprised.  The songs are touching and tuneful, Young himself is pleasant and amusing, and the back-up players have a time-worn character -- as does Young -- which appeal to my aging self.  I loved the fact that the players all had instuments that seemed as old and beat up as they are.

Young takes the stage at the Rhyman theater, the old home of the Grand Ol' Opry in Nashville.  He displays the proper amount of reverence for the place and plays a guitar once owned by Hank Williams.  He's got a whole crowd assisting including a Black church choir, three horn players, and half a dozen backup singers, including Emmylou Harris whose crystaline soprano could make a wildcat wailing on the back fence sound better.  On some of the songs it's just him and his guitar.

The emphasis is on country, reflective songs played on traditional acoustic instuments. There's little dialogue except for an brief introduction in which other players talk about Young.  So, it's all music, filmed and recorded artfully as a visual record of an important composer/singer.

2663768,5,B000IU4DMI,"because that is what this is - some top notch musicians who have played together for years - practising their craft.  The old timers just stand and play, no histrionics, not leaping around the stage - they just play - and they play WELL.  Everyone looks so relaxed that at times it appears they are almost not doing anything - but the sound is superb and the band so tight it sounds like this came out the studio.

It is a meausure of how well everyone plays together that Emmylou Harris - no mean performer herself - can be seen watching Neil's chords like a hawk while she duo's (extremely successfully) on her guitar alongside.  The rest of the guys - they don't need to look - they just play.  Watch for the pan down a line of 6 guitars in a row as all the fingers move together through the chord sequences and the occassional gently angled shot to give a laid back, guitar to the fore look.

Think of this concert as a sort of ""MTV Unplugged"" (but plugged in) piece in terms of people sitting down and just playing together.  Only WAY better.

Sharp hats Neil.....

It's on my wishlist for release day.",1147305600,,1107,4.334951456310679
2663769,5,B000IU4DMI,"NEIL YOUNG--HEART OF GOLD THE MOVIE:
THIS RELEASE IS ONE OF HIS BEST.
Neil Young has always been a conumdrum; part genius, part guitar hack, part poet, part flack. He has played many roles;a Canadian-born singer songwriter, child of the late fifties, darling of the sixties and spokesman for the seventies. Then later, Reagan supporter in the eighties and grandfather to American grundge in the nineties. Now in the twilight of his career, Neil Young remains one of a handful of voices that can generate industry-wide attention just by releasing a new cd or heading out on tour. He has produced some of the most memorable and occassionally the most forgettable music in popular culture. So while it's no surprise that diehard fans continue to line up whenever the venerable rocker releases new material, many others check in sporadically to see what the old man is up to.
Well,diehards and estranged fans alike should be ecstatic. And they should check out Young and a cast of nearly forty as Jonathan Demme's Heart of Gold captures the singer-songwriter in at one of the most pleasing sonic moments of his four decade career.

This is Young at his best, backed by a host of top level players including Ben Keith, Tim Drummond,  and Spooner Oldham, among others. These are all veteran musicians that Young has collaborated with several times over the years, most notably during his Harvest session and during his occasional reprises to that genre which produced Harvest Moon, Silver and Gold, and the recent Prarie Wind. Here under the watchful but never intrusive eye of award winning filmmaking Jonathan Demme (The Silence of the Lamb, Philadelphia, Stop Makin Sense)Young plays the part of a gracious host, welcoming his compadres and his audience alike to bask in the glow of nearly thirty songs from his prodigious catalog. The setting is appropriate-- Nashville's Ryman Auditorium, once the heart of country music and still one of its most nutritious arteries. As celestial light shines through the stained-glass windows of the sacred hall, Young and his castmates glide through almost the entirety of his recent release Prairie Wind, along with acoustic gems such as Old Man, I Am A Child, Harvest Moon, Four Strong Winds, Comes A Time, and of course the title track Heart of Gold.

Young has never sounded so good or so relaxed. He should be so satisfied.

With the recording of this series of concerts coming so soon after his subject had recovered from surgery to repair an aneurysm,Jonathan Demme has captured the artist at his most reflective. Youngs songs stand as testimonials to his family, his friends, and perhaps even his fans, many of whom have entered into middle age along with the singer. The sound is incredible --largely acoustic and there is so much of it. The voices soar toward to the heavens but thank God Demme was able to capture the waves before they sailed out into the Nashville night and onto the prairies.
Young has never cottoned to categories or to cliches. His reunions with country music have always been his most commercially successful, which for Young often meant they were shortlived, the better to move away from quickly lest he be bored or repeat himself.
Still, Heart of Gold records for all history or at least for anyone that calls themself a Neil Young fan that sometime during the last half of the twentieth century and early into the next one, there was a singer-songwriter who loved Hank Williams, loved his family, and loved to play sweet,haunting, celebrations and salutations of life and love. His name was Neil Young and he did it right.",1146096000,,3593,4.894909688013136
2663770,5,B000IU4DMI,"There is a lot to recommend this film - Young's best music in a very long time, the twin passionate motivators of his father's passing from dementia and his own brush with an aneurism, the brilliant musicianship of all the support players, and perhaps most importantly, Emmylou Harris. (hopefully there will be some additional material on the dvd)I can't think of any better pairing in music than these two, and it has always been that way. More so than with CSN, CH, whatever garbanzo group he cobblers together, the moment he and Harris collaborate, whatever the song, it takes on a majesty that is unsurpassed in my ears. In all honesty, in this film, Harris is riveting. It is as much her film, in a supporting role, as it is Young's, and that is without attempting to grandstand. It is the pairing that does it.

The first half of the film is devoted to PRAIRIE WIND, its recording and presentation on stage. Demme delivers as impressive a tableaux for Neil as he did for Talking Heads. You'd forget altogether the coked stumble bum of THE LAST WALTZ, or even the crazed Dylan uber-fan from the Zimmerman tribute. Demme gets up close with Neil and lets his sardonnic humour shine through. To Young's credit, he knows the camera is there and slyly mocks it, and the whole genre of concert footage. At the opening he explains he never asks for any particular musicians and just goes with the flow of who is assembled. Then all of the supporting players tell how he has explicitly asked for them. It is just a perfect example of an extraordinarily dry wit who, as he explains in the background of the story about Louis Avila, ""I'm just lucky, I guess.""

The second half of the film reminds you just how powerful his country-folk-rock material is, be it the incredible take on ""Four Strong Winds"" (any Canadian kid worth his salt knows this better than O Canada), the aforementioned ""Old Man,"" the acknowledgement to Nicollete Larsen with ""Lotta Love,"" or the show stopping tour de force song to his dog with Emmylou matching him rif for rif and harmonizing like her life depended on it. The instensity of these two locked in on this song especially, but in nearly every song she's featured in, takes this concert to a place almost no other Neil Young concert I have ever seen reaches. There is a point in STOP MAKING SENSE where you wonder can the band can be any more incendiary than it is. You'll hit that same point with Young's canine ode. In fairness, everyone in the band is on fire by that point, it's just that Harris and Young take this terrific tune to the temple of the gods and offer it up to Music itself. The audience in the movie theatre stood and applauded.

The film ends with a solo, empty theatre version of ""The Old Laughing Lady."" And that profoundly reminds you why Young put both this concert and this record together. This early metaphor of death haunts the screen as Young packs up and walks off the stage, his boots knocking on the Nashville floor, his face clearly brooding, tryin to remember what Daddy said...",1146009600,,3040,4.594843462246777
2663771,5,B000IU4DMI,"If you like Neil Young, I think you'll love this film.  Neil's getting older, but he hasn't lost a thing.  If anything he's better then ever.

I'm over 55 now and my wife and I have listened to Neil's words and music for over 30 years now.  My wife Pat and I got interested in Neil's stuff in '71 before we got married.  I brought ""After The Gold Rush"" when it came out in vinyl.  I actually got hooked on Neil when he came out with ""Everybody Know This Is Nowhere"" which came out a few years earlier.

The movie was rated by the ""Baltimore Sun"" with an A+.  The reviewer talked about the technical details of the film.  I don't know nothing about that.  I just thoroughly enjoyed the movie and recommend it to any Neil Young fan.

Be careful.  The movie might break you heart!",1145836800,,777,4.210884353741497
2663772,5,B000IU4DMI,"I think that Neil Young is one of the finest artists that I know.  I grew up really liking his music and following his every move.  He has tremendous amount of push.  He has been sick and came up with this beautiful Heart of Gold film.  I saw the movie and I cried when I found out it had moved on.  I ordered the dvd which is to be released next month.  He is the same Neil Young that I saw when he played and sang in The Last Waltz with The Band. (I have that concert too)  I watch it at least once a week to get my spirits uplifted.  That was a great concert too. I love to hear his beautiful, meaningful, music.  Every song has a story. This has been such an inspiration to me that I cannot explain, only it was wonderful and the music is to pure that I cry during each session.

I hope I can find his schedule and more than likely, I will go.  Thank you and God Bless the Young Family and Friends and Team.

There are many moving moments in this journey filmed at the historic Ryman auditorium in Nashville.  Neil is finally talking after all these years and we get some grins between songs. This is about music per se with minimal narrative at the beginning.  Incredible close up photography allows abundant,intimate face time with Mr. Young as he strongly strums on Hank William's old guitar.

2663779,5,B000IU4DMI,"Having seen this twice on screen with a theatre audience, we viewers shared our comments after the movie. I found viewing this to be an absolutely religious experience. I quite agree with Neil Young who describes his music (not as country and western, but) as American Music. His tone-poems that he has presented here are no doubt influenced by his serious medical problem from which he has returned to life to give us his thoughts about The Prairie, Alzheimer's Disease, This Old Guitar, and many other aspects of life.",1144022400,,520,4.853932584269663
2663780,5,B000IU4DMI,"When I heard this was being done with Jonathon Demme, I knew it was going to be outstanding.  Neil surrounds himself with Pegi, Spooner, Ben, Emmylou, and other old friends. He plays Hank Sr's guitar, which hasn't graced the stage of the Ryman since 1951.  They run through most of the songs on Prairie Wind, and Neil gives very personal reasons for writing some of them...I'm not going to spoil that for anyone reading here.  After that, they do some older material: I am a Child, Harvest Moon, Old Man, Needle & the Damage Done, Old King, 4 Strong Winds, and an incredible One of These Days.  I probably missed a song or 2, and then...the lights go down, and it's just Neil on the stage, no crowd, no bandmates, playing The Old Laughing Lady thru the credits.  Was the whole show just a dream of Neil's?  Thank you Mr. Demme.",1143936000,,827,4.443708609271523
2663781,5,B000IU4DMI,"Anyone who saw Johathan Demme's groundbreaking concert documentary Stop Making Sense (1984) should have an eerie feeling of having been there.

This Film continues the tradition of letting the music speak for itself.  One simply forgets that they are in a movie theater and simply grooves on musical talent that is nothing short of remarkable.  Young recaptures the musical genuis that we've come to know and love.  His simple approach to creation of a song, with the help of those who bring out the best in him, make this a musical journey worth taking.  The addition of Emmylou Harris and other friends just add to the depth of this performance.

From the opening interview snippets to the final scene of Neil Young alone on stage, Jonathan Demme, as one would expect, has created a masterpiece, a film suitable to its subject.  No two-second ADD camera work here, this wonderful film was shot with the same grace, intelligence and intimacy as the music Young and his friends--including Emmylou Harris!--perform.
