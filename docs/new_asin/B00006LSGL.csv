7971959,5,B00006LSGL,"One of the finest Christmas films ever released. I am baffled why there never has been an NTSC release of this film on our side of the pond. I remember the film was a staple on American TV during the 60s ad 70s, but now has pretty much disappeared.. I did manage to secure a PAL DVD of it and had it transferred over to our NTSC. It was a rare privilege to finally have a DVD of this holiday classic. It is uniquely British, and I enjoy it even more having been born in Britain and have added it to my icreasingly enlarging library of British films. The film is slow at times, but it increases the impact of the film. My favorite holiday film.",1502236800,,643,4.111111111111111
7971960,4,B00006LSGL,Interesting holiday movie.  We had never seen it before.  It's very British.  Gives an interesting perspective on the early post-war period.,1485561600,2,140,5.571428571428571
7971961,3,B00006LSGL,"I found this film in Region 1 format on another website and so I finally got to watch it.  My verdict?  It's good, it's solid, but nothing spectacular.  The editing right at the end is terrible, but the acting is good enough.  The plot is basically a family of inwardly messed-up people who finally boil over and bare their souls to each other one Christmastime.  And given that this movie's from the black-and-white era of British film, the culture at the time was probably psychologically constipated enough thanks to common culture that people being shown how to live lives of greater catharsis by being more honest with each other was probably a step in the right direction.

Even today such a film still has that lesson for us all.  But for today's audiences that message would have to be updated for the times, with characters trapped in poverty by student loans, addiction to pharmaceutical drugs, and those sorts of more modern things.",1480723200,,943,4.783950617283951
7971962,5,B00006LSGL,"It took me years to find this wonderful British movie. While not a conventional Christmas movie, substantially is simply one of the best ever.",1390780800,3,142,4.958333333333333
7971963,5,B00006LSGL,"This is one fantastic video.  I have been trying to get it for over a decade. Finally found it on Amazon. The discription plainly stated that it would not work on USA region 1 players and the DVD even had a warning label on the outside. Never the less I ordered it and hoped I would find someone who could convert it from region 2 to region 1.  Luckly there is are two easier answers. Either buy an ""all region"" dvd player or google your old dvd player with the word ""hack"" and you may find as I did by simply opening the tray and hitting some numbers on the remote that your DVD player will now play all regions!
The video and sound quality are outstanding and my family is thrilled to see this clasic once again.",1358380800,8,714,4.166666666666667
7971964,1,B00006LSGL,"I had ordered this DVD because we really like this movie.  It played only 6 of 8 chapters then it froze and wouldn't work.  So I ordered another one.  It did the same thing in the same spot. I assume the master to make this dvd was bad. I would really like to get a copy of this movie. As expected, Amazon made this experience a good one by taking care of the returns.  Amazon is the best.",1325980800,5,389,3.948717948717949
7971965,5,B00006LSGL,"The movie is a wonderful, nearly forgotten and very hard to find [Turner Classic Movies recently had it on its schedule but for some reason did not televise it] Christmas classic about a family reunion of a vicar, his in-laws and grown children at Christmas in post WWII England. If you love well-acted adult drama in the best sense this is for you. Yes it has been on VHS [currently not available] but I've been looking for it for some time now on DVD, and have finally found it at Amazon UK in a recently released good image/sound Region 2 dvd version [although you'll need an all-region dvd player to view it.] Hooray!  If you have Region 2 capability, buy it, you'll love it.",1257379200,13,679,4.475806451612903
7971966,5,B00006LSGL,"This is one of the movies we used to look forward to seeing on an annual basis along with the likes of other classics such as Holiday Inn, Christmas in Connecticut, We're No Angels, The Bishop's Wife and of course White Christmas. But it seems like it has now disappeared among the relics.  I'm glad I found a copy.  If you see one, grab it! The resale alone is worth your efforts.",1244160000,11,381,4.277777777777778
