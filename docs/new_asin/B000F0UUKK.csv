2547702,4,B000F0UUKK,"Okay, a little disclaimer up front folks.  I'm not going to write and say that this movie is brilliantly acted or that it even completely makes sense.  And, I'm not going to declare that it is a masterpiece for the ages.

What I am going to say is that it grossed me out, made me laugh my back-side off, and was a helluva lot of fun!  Not necessarily the faithful Lovecraft adaptation it's promised to be, but it's certainly a lot closer than others - especially the much vaunted ""Re-Animator."" (Another love of mine, BTW.)

But, speaking of Re-Animator, this one has the same essential elements that make that film great.  Style to burn, over-the-top, unforgettable characters, bizarre gore to satisfy the most blood-thirsty viewer, and a guaranteed future in the cult movie hall of fame!

You get the sense that a lot of this was rushed in the writing and in the making.  But, you also get a sense that, like Stuart Gordon or Sam Raimi, the guys who made this sucker are just finding their footing and could make something really awesome in the future.  Definitely some folks to keep an eye on.

Now, that's not to say that you're gonna see something great in the future from all involved.  The MTV-adled editor who never met a distracting flash cut he didn't like might not be catapaulted into the big leagues by this sucker.  Also, some of the actors are like community theater rejects that have been exposed to radiation.  But, hell, the rampant over-acting and broad delivery actually make most of them pretty endearing, nonetheless.

I'm recommending this because I'm a person that loves cheap horror movies that not only wear their budgets on their sleeves - but wear their hearts there as well.  You can feel the geek enthusiasm and unbridled excitement that this project was made with - and that alone makes it worth a viewing.

I suppose it says something that I've written this whole review without delving into the plot.  But, let's face it, you don't rent a film like this because of the plot.  You rent it because there is a good chance you're going to see a woman having her brain exposed and experimented on while still living.  (And yes, this film has exactly that in one of the most twisted sex scenes this side of ""Blue Velvet."")

If you're willing to suffer through some slow parts and endure some low-budget inadequecies - you'll be glad you did.  The score and direction definitely set it apart from the pack.  It certainly looks a lot better than it should!  Anyway, this is a fun freakin' flick that ain't too bad to look at, pushes all the right buttons and will be the perfect addition to any late-night movie marathon.

Watch it in a double-feature with ""From Beyond,"" some hardcore horror fanatics, and a big, ole', tasty block of cheese!  You won't be disappointed!",1148256000,8,2795,4.643584521384929
2547703,1,B000F0UUKK,"Horrible acting and an attempt to shock us with bad camera work leaves us wondering if there was a budget to this.  Even Ed Wood would have passed this one up.  H. P.

2547704,1,B000F0UUKK,"I will start by noting I love bad horror movies. I have seen Killer Tomatoes a dozen times. I once bought a horror DVD solely because it starred Alice Cooper. That said, this is possibly the worst acting I have ever seen, and I include in this assessment every kindergarten school pageant and poorly-conceived Nativity Scene with live animals I have ever attended. To fully heighten the experience, the audio track appears to have been recorded in a men's room of a major international airport, wherein no one is in the same stall with the mike. I can only guess the creators saw ""The Elephant Man"" at some point, and thought removing all budget, talent, and production value would improve the work. Everyone in the picture seems to be wearing a wig, but they're of the $2 Halloween variety, and none sit correctly on the respective skulls of the wearers. The final thrill is that in the various ""medical"" scenes, the property man clearly just bought a number of doctor's items without understanding what they are for, and laid them out to look impressive. I made it ten or fifteen minutes into this before giving up and turning it off, which apparently means I have seen five minutes more than the average Netflix viewer.

2547705,3,B000F0UUKK,"I would encourage you to rent this movie, but watch it with the commentary. The commentary by the film makers is hilarious! The movie commentary transformed what could have been a waste of time for the evening into a fun and quite enjoyable affair. The film makers definitely have a sense of humor about their work (and more than one vodka while creating the commentary, I suspect) so you get uninhibited flowing humorous commentary throughout the whole thing. Plus, it did increase my empathy for low budget film makers and the problems they face.
1 star movie -- 5 star commentary -- I'll give it a 3 star for average. Definitely fun and enjoyable to watch with commentary.",1211760000,6,675,4.728813559322034
2547706,1,B000F0UUKK,"First and foremost, if you have epilepsy, skip the first five minutes.  No need to check your DVD player - it's not skipping.  That's just how it's filmed.

The back and forth staccato filming techniques, while accompanied by a monologue of sorts, are nevertheless incoherent, and reminiscent of a film school dropout's failing project.  It's completely random and pointless, and appears to be in the film merely to entice the viewer into waiting for an answer to the ""huh?"" beginning, which is inevitably insufficient and ignorant.

What follows is quite possibly the most painfully long credit montage in movie history, as if anyone cares who is associated with this bargain bin production.

Unfortunately, the mindless dialogue and 3rd grade script doesn't end with the intro to the movie.  Seconds after the credit montage, more pointless camera shots and film is wasted as no sort of actual story is in site.  Not until the arrival of the sheriff, played by that guy with the crotch pistol in ""From Dusk Til Dawn"", does any real acting take place.  When a movie has to fall back on the acting chops of someone whose big role was playing a groin-pistol-toting vampire killer, there is some serious trouble.

The rest of this idiotic movie is a collection of bad actors attempting to out-bad one another in a sea of stupidity, unrelated scenes, laughable special effects and makeup, and a script that deteriorates into something that makes Police Academy V look like Citizen Kane.

This is easily one of the worst movies ever made.",1199577600,4,1534,4.906976744186046
2547707,3,B000F0UUKK,"This film is, I think, definitely watchable. The viewer should just remember the One Rule of fantasy, science fiction, and horror: the suspension of disbelief. Just as with Lovecraft original writings it is necessary to look behind the words, or in this case the images, to find the true horror. I do not agree that this film is boring. In the film the boundaries between sanity and insanity, good and evil, reality and imagination are blurred at the best of times, and they are nonexistent most of the time! Even the difference between the home of the inbreds and the asylum is blurred to nonexistense - it is the same filth, the same loonies walking around unattended, and in the cellars unspeakable cruelties take place. In this the filmmmakers expertly captures what Lovecraft really writes about.
Of course, the framework, the police interview, hints that something is going to go horribly wrong sometime after the film ends, but that again is true to the spirit of Lovecraft. We cannot win, we cannot run, if we are lucky we go insane before the end.",1186876800,,1056,4.775956284153006

The hilarious evil lead doctor.

Both hilarious.

Everything else will make you want to stab yourself in the eye with a pencil.

Pretty much all I watch is bad (B,C and sub grade) horror movies and this is down at the bottom of the barrel comfortably seated next to other classics like 'The Pumpkin Karver'

2547709,4,B000F0UUKK,"If you're looking for a typical campy bloodbath, then this film is definitely not for you.  But if you've ever gotten into one of Derek Jarman's experimental films, this may well be an exceptional treat for you.  For my part, I found it to be the most truly nightmarish film I've ever seen.  Yes, the acting at times is amateur theater-style hamming.  But I got the feeling that the director probably encouraged that.  If it's not influenced by German expressionism -- and given some of the sets, I'd say it is -- then maybe it's just Brecht's alienation factor at work.  All in all, a refreshing and disorienting oddity.",1182124800,3,621,4.651376146788991
2547710,1,B000F0UUKK,I have to say that this is the worst movie I have ever seen.  Stay away from this one.  The acting is almost laughable.

2547712,1,B000F0UUKK,"First of all the cover art looks great, which is a shame as it has nothing to with the movie with the exception of possibly the door. I know William Sanderson can act better than this, I've seen him do it, so even the directing is terrible. Alan Smithee wouldn't even put his name on it. I really feel for the people who have to lose hours of their lives just to rate garbage like this. I had high hopes seeing that horror guru Tom Savini was in it but the effects, like the acting, seemed like something from a hogh school production. If you truly like H.P. Lovecraft check out ""From Beyond"", ""In The Mouth Of Madness"" or ""Reanimator"". This DVD makes a great coaster,incidentally, but at 20 dollars it's a bit excessive.

I'm a big horror fan and I really find the ones pertaining to insane asylums very interesting.  The cover of the dvd looked very interesting and the review on the back of the dvd lead me to believe this would be my kind of movie.  I was sadly mistaken, it was so bad that I just finally cut the movie off about halfway through.  I almost asked for my money back from the video store, it was sooo bad and sooo boring!

2547717,1,B000F0UUKK,"Hey, I'm an H.P. Lovecraft reader, and my expectations are high.  I'm always hopeful when the title of a movie `says' the film is inspired by HLP.  But . . .

The writer/director was really--really trying, but he lost control from the beginning.  The film began with a series of disjoined images and dialogue which were startling, but there was no suspenseful build up.

Okay, it's difficult to put Lovecraft on the big screen anyway, but the stilted dialogue didn't help.  The range of acting ability was uneven, and that didn't help.  Also, using black and white, well, why?  B&W can be used to build a great mood and suspense but this film had neither so using B&W footage was pointless.  And the blood and gore just for the sake of it . . . better luck next time.

If you want to watch Lovecraft on film, rent the `Resurrected' with Chris Sarandon or go back to `Re-Animator.'",1161561600,5,880,4.512658227848101

2547719,1,B000F0UUKK,"This is an atrociously bad movie based on a HP Lovecraft tale: ""Beyond the Walls of Sleep"". Absolutely horrendous, even if you can get past the first 4 minutes of strobe-like edits without having a seizure. I only rented it because it took place in Ulster County (the county where I live) and I'm a sucker for HP Lovecraft, but as far as I know, there were never any hillbilly's that would omit all pronouns when they spoke, and I'm pretty sure that polyester wigs were NOT the fashion du-jour for the 1930's time period, around here, at least. And the ""acting""...I have seen high school productions vastly better than this bag o sha.

And one of the cheesiest things about this dvd is that they put a cool cover on it that relates to nothing actually appearing on the film.

I think it is even worse than ""House of Cthulhu"" which was on my short list of all time worst movies, especially since that stinker had nothing to do with Lovecraft other than the title.

Honestly, avoid at all costs.",1157155200,2,993,4.475138121546961
2547720,4,B000F0UUKK,"Some of the other reviewers give synopses of the plot, so I'll skip that, and just make a few observations.

First, I have to point out that I'm a fairly big fan of H. P. Lovecraft's work, but -- and this is an IMPORTANT but -- I understand that it's fairly difficult to translate the written word into cinema, so, unlike some of the extreme purists out there, I don't expect a movie to be much like the story it's adapted from. If I expected that, I would hate most of the films I watch.

I liked the technique used in making this film, that is, the black and white alternated with color etc.  This might be old hat to some people, but I haven't seen much of it, and I at least like this sample of it.

What I really like about this movie is its relentlessly over-the-top quality.  I thought the gouts of blood, the exposed brains, the demented experiments being performed by the staff at the asylum, the electrodes to the brain, communicating with Amducious, everybody going out of their minds etc. was all REALLY COOL!!!!  I especially liked the movie's accurate portrayal of the psychological reality of the medical/psychiatric profession.

The film's main weakness was the barely adequate level of some of the acting; some of the actors seemed like guys off the street just reciting their lines from a teleprompter.  The good qualities of the movie (see above paragraph)mostly overcome this weakness, but not enough for me to give it five stars.

I highly recommend this film, especially if you enjoy movies about insanity, torment, and weird alien monstrosities from another dimension seeking to vivify themselves in our mundane reality.",1155945600,,1643,4.7368421052631575
2547721,1,B000F0UUKK,"Near the end of the commentary track of this movie, one of the film's creators says something like, ""And now all you HP Lovecraft fans out there can go on the Internet and mouth off about how much you hated this movie."" Then either he or one of his compatriots says that anyone who goes back to the original story will see that it's actually about as faithfully Lovecraftian as any movie ever made. Right on the first count, wrong on the second.

The original story is a short one: an intern at an asylum encounters Joe Slater, a subliterate hillbilly who sometimes, in sleep, talks of strange visions he can barely describe, and who in a disturbed state kills a neighbour. The intern becomes certain there's something inexplicable going on in Slater's mind and experiments with an old unfinished telepathic device to learn what Slater is encountering in his sleep. After months of effort it finally works and the intern/narrator learns that we have complete and different -- and much better -- lives as beings of energy that our human selves only experience in our sleep, and he discovers that Slater's alter ego is seeking a nemesis across space that he'll finally be able to destroy when the body of Joe Slater, his prison, is dead. Slater is indeed dying and when the narrator awakes Slater's alter ego manages to speak through him to the intern to tell him that he will soon be free and avenge himself on his nemesis, telling the intern to watch the sky for something near the star Algol, which he calls the Demon Star. Slater dies. The intern tells his supervisor, who is convinced it's all imagination and overwork, but within a day or two an astronomer reports the sighting of a previously unseen star near Algol.

The movie has Slater, the asylum, the intern, his telepathic equipment, and something happening when Slater sleeps. It also has a high quotient of gratuitous sex and grossness that seems to be swiped from the much more successful film Re-Animator, which is based on Lovecraft's shlock horror story Herbert West, Reanimator. It has a new backstory that you need to hear the commentary track to make sense of -- Slater's people are part of a bizarre cult, the Scottish Rite Freemasons, who worship a demon named Amducious. The demon apparently lives as the absorbed fetal twin in Slater's back. There's a zombie goth chick, there's a really bad wig on the intern (finally explained as a wig concealing his multiple self-trepanations), there are pseudo Blair Witch sequences, and a whole lot of blood, guts, profanity, etc.

Beyond... doesn't make a virtue of necessity in adapting Lovecraft on a low budget, the way the recent short film of The Call of Cthulhu, with its 1930s German impressionist feel, does. It doesn't provide any real chills or scares because the acting is so deliberately over-the-top awful. It doesn't make any sense. If you weren't one of the people who made this film there's just no reason to see it. Even a connoisseur of cheap crap movies is likely to be disappointed. This isn't a case of someone's reach exceeding their grasp; the filmmakers' commentary suggests they're pretty happy with how it turned out. It's not the work of a unique but deranged creator; too much of it is recycled from other, better movies. It's not even funny, intentionally or otherwise.",1155772800,,3312,4.786713286713287
2547722,2,B000F0UUKK,"In fifty words or less:  Geographically confused hillbillies inbreed for the glory of Cthulhu.  One such hillbilly has a fetal twin trying to claw its way out of his back.  This hillbilly kills his family, hears bad voices, and ends up institutionalized.  Wackiness ensues.  [Spoilers to follow.  Stop reading now if you'd prefer to avoid them.]

At the institution, there's an assortment of mad doctors performing a variety of appalling experiments on patients - none more vigorously and with greater manic glee than the intern Edward Eischel.  Edward keeps a brain-dead sex slave down in the basement, her skull hinged like a Tic-Tac dispenser for the easy application of needley electrodes. Down in the lab, Edward collects brains in jars, cackles wickedly, plots the downfall of his bosses, and wears what can only be described as the worst wig in the history of movie-making.  This is a wig with such godawful presence that it permits Edward to use editorial ""we"" without sounding like a schizophrenic.  Clearly, when he says ""We'll show THEM who's in charge!"" - by ""we"" he means ""me and this-here wig.""

At any rate, dear mad Edward decides that the fetal twin rearing up out of the hillbilly's back has a mind of its own, and he wants to use his wazzy electrical brain-probing equipment to make contact with it.  But as those of you who follow Lovecraft have probably guessed by now, the fetal twin is no mere biological anomaly - heavens, no.  Its name is Amducious, and it is the telepathically homicidal(?) physical representation of a hideous god-beast, who's just WAITING to burst out like a big tentacled pimple.

For reasons best left unpondered, Amducious requires nine brains in order to manifest fully in this world.  Luckily for the imprisoned god-beast, Edward has already drilled a hole in his forehead for easy uplinking purposes - which yes, explains the wig, for it covers his shaved scalp with the makeshift USB port.  Edward and his vegetable-minded, pop-top honey (Ardelia) wreak havoc on the asylum, popping off heads and arranging them on pikes until they form the world's most unlikely LAN party.  Once all the brains are connected via wires, needles, and electrodes, to Edward - bad things happen. Amducious crawls up out of the hillbilly's backside and what had previously appeared to be ""havoc in the process of being wreaked"" now looks like a tea party because oh God, here comes the REALLY bad stuff ... except that the only sane and surviving doctor in the asylum has showed up with a hatchet.

This doctor busts up the electrical equipment, which (a). floors Edward and Ardelia and (b). also topples Amducious, even though he's already out and walking around - which didn't make any sense to me, but whatever.  The next scene features poor Edward in a straitjacket and a padded room, while the hatchet-wielding doctor looks on and shakes his head.  Roll credits.

Okay.  There were a few things to like about this movie - let there be no doubt.  First of all, some of the direction was very, very good.  The use of black and white and the camera angles occasionally teetered toward brilliance; and Tom Savini did the make-up work (and drops by for a bit part), so that much was also laudable.  There were several good actors - including William Sanderson (who deftly portrayed the afflicted hillbilly), and Rachel Mellendorf - who was um, really good at looking brain-dead.

But by and large the actors you're forced to spend the most time with are flat to the point of being grating.  Edward was so bad as to be hilarious, and the foul-mouthed alienist had the worst dialogue I've ever heard.  Bully on him, for knowing the F word in 1911; but every forty-five-second, spittle-flecked spiel would have been more effective at half the length.  And let us touch upon the never-ending TOOL video, shall we?  Shocky, Silent Hill-esque pastiches of freaky footage are effective, like, once in awhile.  But ten minute stretches of them weary the eyeballs and strain the attention span, I'm just saying.  We get it - children are creepy.  Hillbillies are creepy.  Ring-around-the-rosie is creepy.

Actually, ""Ring Around the Rosie"" is about to achieve the same status as cornfields in horror movies.  We all know about corn, right?  Crop of the damned.  Ask Alfred Hitchcock, M. Night Shyamalan, or Stephen King - don't plant corn.  Nothing good will come of it.  If it's tall enough to hide YOU, it's tall enough to hide homicidal maniacs/aliens/demon children/etc.  Plant strawberries instead; or plant something knee-high, at any rate.  Remember, kids:  no one ever gets mauled by fanged, skinless dog-monsters in a peanut field.

But I digress.  ""Ring Around the Rosey"" is fast becoming the de facto signifier of wicked little children what ain't like they seem.  Perhaps it's because of the plague myth of the song's inception; or perhaps it's just because it's easily recognizable and easy to remember.  I don't know.  But regardless, I am instantly suspicious of any story that uses ""Ring Around the Rosey"" as an atmospheric shortcut.  It smacks of laziness.

So I say all that to say this:  Beyond the Wall of Sleep was not by any means the worst low-budget horror film I've ever subjected myself to - far from it.  But there was a lot wrong that would've been easy to fix (different actors, less epilepsy-inducing cut-scene tedium), and therefore, it disappoints me.  It's worth renting with a bottle of booze and a few good friends with a penchant for MST3K, but otherwise, leave it wherever you find it - and don't let it follow you home.",1155340800,3,5579,4.861081654294804

- Except for 2 scenes, the acting is City College or Community TV level through-out.

- The dialog is pretentious and hectoring.

The Good:

- Unlike the ""Reanimator"" spung off series of films, this film is Lovecraft in tone and exposition.

- The acting of Savini (gore-FX savant) and the lead are islands of convincing acting.

- The scene where a local seriff confronts a vigilante group of mountain men is really worth seeing... it captures Lovecraft's racist horror of inbreeding of human stock and an elitist's paranoia of the ""lower classes"" as intinsically evil.

It has no beginning, no development...and no ending either. It's kind of a surreal film but I thought it quite boring. The ""gore"" was very badly done. For example this one ""doctor"" had removed the top part of a woman's skull exposing her ""brain""...so he can put electrodes in it to stimulate her pleasure centers and make her orgasm (which I thought was a silly scene). Well the ""brain"" looks like a piece of cheap plastic replica more expected to be seen from a grade ""B"" movie. In fact, I thought of this whole movie as quite Grade B, and the ""B"" means BAD and BORING. I rented this movie and even now I feel quite ripped off. If I bought it I would have gotten extremely angry: This is yet another example of cheapo quality horror, which is more silly with its complete lack of plot, development, and very BAD acting. Ohh the actors sounded as though they were reading script from cue-cards! Overdone, and quite mechanical. I thought this whole production from script, to special effects, to acting could have been better acheived with high school students. I though HOW was it possible this passed through what, I felt, should have been put in the rejection heap of amateurish films, is beyond me. I was extremely unsatisfied.

I counted how many times I yawned due to boredom watching this: FIVE TIMES. And I almost fell asleep once. The only thing I remember thinking was I was glad it ended because throughout the movie I was wondering when anything exciting was going to happen. AT LEAST 15 or 20 mintues of it...well, it never did. It just ended as boring as ever and completely devoid of plot.",1151193600,13,1985,4.623229461756374

The actual camera work is good, lighting is good, but what is that worth when paying for a film?

I can imagine sitting through a film like this if it was pron, but this is not porn, it's just bad. Stay away.

If this is a first effort, then I understand that everyone comes from somewhere, a lot of artists I admrie did bad work early on and I wish the people involved in this well, but the fact remains that this is a bad film, badly written, badly acted, badly directed.

That said though, they did make it, there is passion in the production and I would be sad if the makers gave up. I just wish they would take a realistic view of their talents and try to get real.

A note to the filmmakers, just because your friend says he/she can act doesn't mean they can.

I am a huge lovecraft fan, to the point where I collect his actual letters and family photos. (Now that's scary) This movie though isn't. Might make a good drinking game though.

To the makers:

But, if you are a fan or corney B horrors, this will lead the pact of a new low budget films.

  This movie was just bad.  Descent storyline (based on H.P. Lovecraft) that just streached out to long. An intern in an asylum discovers a new way to harness human thought in those who cannot speak for themselves, sounds good, done poorly.

  The Gore factor got old within the first 20 minutes.  The acting was, well not there, some folks just reading there lines, some in bad inbred accents, others in bad German accents.  I feel it did no justice to the Psychiatric field, just riddled with horrible inaccuracies.  Tom Cruise would love this film, because he's use it as propaganda against Psychiatry.  Finally, just plain predictable, didn't hold my attention.

  Pluses: Neat camera work, intresting splicing of film and scenes.

  Minuses: as noted above.

Again, if you like B horror films, this would be up your alley, but don't be mislead that this may be a descent horror film because it has H.P. Lovecraft on it. Didn't give it a one because it is just a B film, and as expected, they are supposed to be corny",1150848000,6,1303,4.399159663865547

*******SPOILERS!!!

This movie revolves around an intern at an insane asylum in the early 1900's (?). This intern learns how to stimulate the brain thru electricity and has a pet project in his experiment room. An inbred from some nearby mountains comes into the asylum and the intern becomes infatuated with him. To make a long story short he begins testing the electricity on the inbred and eventually a creature explodes out of the inbreds back.

I REALLY liked this film. The last scene was terrific with the explossion out of the back. The creature, though obviously computer generated, looked cool and the doctor smashing the machine was great. Most low budget films give a lousy pay off but this one really was nice. The music was exceptional and I would love to find the sound track somewhere as I have never heard a scoring to a low budget film this good.

On the negative side some of the dream sequences left me guessing and I think I should have come out of them with more information then I went into them with. Or at least the feeling that there WAS more information in them and I just didn't get it.

The filmmakers really pulled of a gem. They seem to have a lot of possibilities with this film and I would love to see something else come out of it. The ending left it wide open to a second go at the story of the intern. lets see it!",1150848000,4,1361,4.384920634920635
2547740,1,B000F0UUKK,"I love horror films and this movie looked so damn promising. But, like almost every other newer horror film, it was a complete dissapointment.

First of all, the cover is misleading. That thing on the cover is nowhere to be found in the movie; Second thing is that the synopsis on the back of the DVD is more entertaining then the movie itself. The movie stars William Sanderson (HBO's ""Deadwood"") as Joe Slaader, a clearly inbred man who is placed in the Ulster County Asylum for killing his family. Problem is, we never truly see him do this. As the doctors begin studying Joe, they notice an odd and unique deformity on his back. One of the doctors who takes particular notice to Joe is Ed Eischel (Fountain Yount), who seems sane but turns out be almost worse than Joe. Ed does experiments involving brain waves, one of his experiments is a young girl who is strapped to a chair below the asylum...Did I mention the top of her head was cut off exposing her brain? Anyway, Ed discovers that the deformity on Joe's back is actually another being...One who happenst to be a lot smarter than Joe, so Eischel begins doing experiments to bring the being out of Joe and into the real world. Now, not only is the story really stupid and really boring...But the film looks horrible. The cinematography is just bad. The movie is in black and white, for the most part, but will change to color for random moments (kind of like ""Natural Born Killers"" except that movie was good). The plot almost isn't there, because the director attempts to use visuals at times to get his point across. I mean, there's things going on in the movie that I didn't even know about. Oh and then there's the monster that pops out of Joe's back (I forget it's name), but it looks like a cheap video game monster. It's excrutiatingly horrible. The movie isn't disturbing, horrifying, scary, or even funny. It's one of the worst horror films I've seen this year and one of the worst I've seen ever. It's right up there with ""Jason X"".

I wanted to take a class at his school last summer but couldn't afford it and get out there. would have loved that!)

The great thing about this film is the ending with the wig getting pulled off and the main actor going into the acid trip sequence where the little girl is telling him about whats going on. We watched that section a few times before we got it. It was very cool.

I think the writers and directors did a good job with making this movie. We are going to listen to the commentary sometime in the future and hopefully they are cool on their as well.

With that said in my opinion beyond the wall of truly bad acting & direction there is a great Lovecraft story here & this comes from a huge fan of the art of low-budget film making. You see you can have bad actors with a decent story as long as you have a good freshly creative Director/moveing picture story teller that will give the audience a labor of love outcome but when you take a great H.P.Lovecraft story a very bad Director & horrid acting along with ridiculously bad editing your outcome is a chicken with a good idea running around with it's head cutt off,so be very careful horror film fans & don't be fooled by all these phony good reviews like I was because this one is definetly not good & it is also not one of those it's so bad it's good kinda flicks it is simply all around horrible! Now with all that said if you could get a good up & comming Director Like Dante Tomaselli or Eric Stanze & some half decent actors & then start from scratch & try this one again you then might complement maestro Lovecraft rather then insult him.p.s. there is no character in the movie that looks like the character on the very creepy & misleading cover art!",1149984000,,1447,4.323529411764706

There is literally no low-budget adventure we won't go on provided we've got a couple of cases of Mickie's and a working DVD player.  This week's adventure was one we won't soon forget.  In fact, we watched the damned thing twice back to back. (well, everyone but Spanish Dave - loser!)

Holy mackeral!  This movie is hilarious!  The makers might not have intended this to be a comedy - but I am still laughing my backside off at this stuff three days later.  Besides the plaintive cries of Edward Eischel (the soon to be cult icon Fountain Yount), ""My brains!  My brains!"" there have got to be about a hundred more quotes in this thing that me and my friends will be saying from here on out.  Here's a sampling just from shuttling through the DVD...

""I can see that it might be some trouble for you to unlodge yourself from your desk.""

""Put simply, the subject is the product of gratutious inbreeding.""

""Whilst I drain this inbred hillbillys backside.""

""Interesting is hardly the term I would use for such a mutilation.""

""Do your loins ache for my synaptic impulses?""

""Just liike a woman to beg for more.""

""Such an insult is detestable to me sir.  More so than the acts of that inbred cornpoke we were admitting.""

""Don't presume for one secont that I am below f**cking you like a low-rent whore.""

""Oh, yes, yes, I know all about your manipulations!""

""I do not create monsters, uncle.""

""The people under your care here are mere scabs, better to be picked and tossed aside.""

""Are there even BALLS to cut here?!?!""

Man, I could go on.  Pure comedy.  The acting is so over the top and the style so crazy - that as insanely bad as the whole enterprise seems - you kind of gotta think that their winking at us a little.  Or a lot!!!!  Whether that's true or not, this thing has taken no time to enter the pantheon of quotable horror train wrecks that I will am proud to purchase now that it's pay day.

Anyway, rent this thing and get a six pack of the aforementioned Mickie's along with it or some other substance of your choice.  I can't believe this thing was even made.  But, I will be forever blessed that it was.

2547749,4,B000F0UUKK,"Despite what others have said Beyond the Wall of Sleep is a pretty faithful adaptation of the Lovecraft story.  People seem to forget that this is a short story.  Just over 4000 words or so.  Obviously if you are going to turn it into a film it's going to require a lot of padding to fill out 90 or so minutes.  Sometimes Lovecraft purists can be a bit insufferable in their whining about films remaining faithful to Lovecraft's original stories.  By nature they are not well-suited for the big screen and HPL would probably be the first to admit it as he relied so much on atmosphere as opposed to action and dialog.  That said most Lovecraft fans have tended to have low expectations of any films based on his works so that's why this one comes as a bit of a refreshing surprise.

Is it a masterpiece?  Heck no...but it is heavy on atmosphere and downright creepy in many spots.  It's low-budget does show up in spots but for what they worked with, they did a good job, especially in some of the gore-filled scenes which are quite twisted.  William Sanderson, best known as one of the trio of country bumpkin brothers from Newhart plays the crazed mountain man Joe Slaader who is locked away in an asylum.  Sanderson is pretty unrecognizable and one of the strongest points of the film.  Fountain Yount as the intern doesn't fare quite as well in his very first screen credit but he's not horrible.

There are editing glitches and a bit too much reliance on overused horror clichs but all in all Beyond the Wall of Sleep was satisfying.

The main lead was very weak. If this film had better actors it would have worked better. A Jeffery Combs [or an actor with his talent], from Re Animator could have carried the material better. Only a few actors were professional in their delivery. However when you buy a low budget film you must expect this, but that was the least of the problems.

I would call this a lackluster attempt at a movie, a attempt that failed miserably, if I believed the makers even cared about it when they were making it.
I love indie horror and H.P. Lovecraft influenced movies. I'm not a purist and don't even consider how close to a story the movie is. If a movie is only inspired by a Lovecraft story then that's enough for me. So nothing I'm saying has to do with that attitude.
I'm judging the movie only for what it is and it's bad. Really bad. A unrewarding waste of your time.

I'm a Lovecraft mythos fan and I have every B-movie that's Lovecraft related I could get my hands on. Some of the best have almost no budget but are made by creative artists with a vision and inspired by a sense of performance, a wish to tell in pictures and sound a story that entertains the audience. There is none of that here.

I tried listening to the commentary track to figure out why it was so wretched and when the makers aren't scoffing at the named actors they hired, they're rightfully berating their own work and laughing it up.
