8016158,5,B0001Q4BMQ,"I LOVED this show as a kid, and since coming across this on Amazon. I thought ""Ohh I must get that!"" And when it arrived in the mail, I got excited, ripped the package open like a kid on Christmas, then stuck it in the DVD player and relived the memories of being a kid watching this Fabulous Cartoon Series! A must for Bobby's World Fans alike!",1304035200,,345,4.164179104477612
8016159,5,B0001Q4BMQ,"This was an incredible dose of nostalgia. I highly recommend it to anyone who was a fan of the series. My only complaint is that its only 5 episodes long. What I REALLY want is the whole series on DVD. Oh well, maybe in the future...",1259539200,,233,4.086956521739131
8016160,4,B0001Q4BMQ,"I was very excited to find that Bobby's World was out on dvd. These episodes were great but the dissapointment came when there were no special features, but at least they released some episodes. More should be released.",1185494400,,219,4.7894736842105265
8016161,4,B0001Q4BMQ,"I loved this cartoon as a kid, and I would watch it faithfully whenever it was on (after-school & weekends). I saw this while searching through the discount rack ($5.99) at the Best Buy across the street from my school and picked it up immediately. I'm happy that I did as about a week later I got pretty sick and laid in bed all day watching Bobby's World and it allowed me to laugh and reminisce, making feel worlds better in the process.",1105315200,,440,4.313253012048193
8016162,5,B0001Q4BMQ,"My son watched Bobby's World as a child and we enjoyed it right along with him.  Howie is terrific as Bobby - journeying along with Bobby's imagination is quite a ride.  Its a cute show for kids (my 2 and 4 year olds now watch it), although some of things you could get away with in 1990 you can no longer say in most cartoons (eg - Derek calling his brother Bobby stupid and a dweeb).
I sit and watch the episodes over and over again - especially ""Swim By Me"" and the song ""I was at the bottom of the pool..."" and I'm not one to usually do that.
Its an affordably priced, enjoyable program.  I recommend it.",1089417600,2,608,4.092436974789916
8016163,3,B0001Q4BMQ,"I love Bobby's World :) For people who haven't heard of this wonderful show, it was created by Howie Mandel & is about this little kid (Bobby of course) who just does regular stuff w/ his family, but it's always more exciting to him because he has such a big imagination. It was one of my favorite shows as a kid & I was so happy when I saw the DVD in the store. I wish it was a whole season, but at least this way it's less expensive (around $10.00 usually), & there is going to be other BW DVDs coming out.
This DVD has 5 eps which are all really cute & funny, as I think every BW ep is. The eps include: 1) Uncle Ted's Excellent Adventure 2) Bobby's Tooth or Dare 3) Swim By Me 4) Fish Tales 5) Jets, Choo-Choos and Cars
The only thing wrong w/ this DVD (& the reason I only gave it 3 star) is that there are no extras whatsoever. I would've liked to know how Howie Mandel got the idea for Bobby, or they could've had maybe a behind the scenes thing showing the characters being drawn, but no, nothing like that. Also, there's no captioning. Hopefully there'll be stuff in the DVDs to follow. Other than that, the DVD's worth getting because it's very reasonably priced and this is a great show!",1087084800,14,1198,4.1239316239316235
8016164,5,B0001Q4BMQ,"This was one of my favorite cartoons back in the day.  They don't make cartoons this good anymore.  The only great cartoons left are Spongebob(legendary), the New Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and Dragonball Gt(My favorite cartoon of all time, which was made in the 80's.  So trust me Bobby's world dvd is great.",1084492800,,312,4.849056603773585
