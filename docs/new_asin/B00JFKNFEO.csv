6356560,5,B00JFKNFEO,"I wasn't prepared for all the self-defense techniques that this guy has to offer on this DVD set. I haven't had time to watch all 4 DVD's yet. But what I did watch, I was impressed. This guy knows his stuff. The way the world is getting these day. I wanted to take some self-defense classes. Seems like you can't go get a burger anymore with out being in some kind of danger. I feel a bit more confident going out in public with some training on how to defend my self, just in case.
I think this DVD set will benefit anyone looking for a course in self-defense. I Highly recommend it.",1404950400,8,584,4.176991150442478
6356561,5,B00JFKNFEO,"So glad I bought this. This set of dvd's is a must have for every woman. My husband and I have been watching them together and practicing the techniques. My husband is also learning lots of great stuff as welll. I used to feel very uneasy walking to my car at night when I get off work. That's why I bought these videos, but I feel much safer now. I feel as though I can handle my own. The videos are actually quite fun too. They are very specific and go over so many different scenarios. I would recommend these videos to all men and women as one can never be too safe out there. I will be lending it to all my girlfriends.",1404518400,9,624,4.040322580645161
6356562,5,B00JFKNFEO,Wow!  Just got through my first module and there is so much I didn't realize I was doing wrong!  I always wanted to learn the proper techniques for self defense and this is exactly what I've been looking for.  The instructor is no nonsense and gives clear easy to understand instructions.  Can't wait to get to the next DVD!,1410912000,3,324,4.440677966101695
6356563,5,B00JFKNFEO,"This DVD set is a great investment. Mtano's instruction was clear, to the point and told in terms that were easy to understand and follow along with. I liked how each of the different techniques being discussed and demonstrated were broken up by chapter to make it easy to go back to a specific section and review. The multi-camera filming helped show the different angles of view without interrupting the flow of the demonstration. This DVD set has hours of technique with the practical application. I found it helpful and a great resource to have. I would recommend this set for anyone looking for a realistic training set that you can work on from home.",1410739200,3,656,4.71304347826087
6356564,5,B00JFKNFEO,"excellent production and quality in the techniques. I'm very impressed. Highly recommended Great set, very well put together and easy to understand. Great, no nonsense, well taught DVD set, Highly recommend it to anyone interested in this pragmatic self-defense system.",1410652800,,269,5.75
6356565,5,B00JFKNFEO,"I am not a fighter. I am not a thug. I have been a business woman who leads a busy schedule who parks in garages and finds myself all over the place for meetings and events. At any given time, really anything bad could happen. But seeing these these self defense dvds really puts the world if violence into perspective.

My husband, on the other hand, was a NYPD detective at the same time as Frank Serpico. Yes, the real Serpico, not Al Pacino in the movie. He is also a Korean War Vet. He is still, to this day, an avid boxer and all-round ""tough as nails"" guy.

We sat down and watched these Battle Drill Combat Street training videos together and were both blown away - each in our individual ways. The instructor, Mtano Loewi, is truly top notch. The basics he goes over are exactly the training you need to protect yourself from the worst kind of violence there is in the world.  Furthermore the detail and information about what won't work, was just as well laid out.

If all you have is your own two bare hands, the techniques Mtano gives you will arm you. These videos will prepare you for an unfortunate encounter in which you must use force, at it's highest level, to protect yourself.

There is not much my husband hasn't seen in the way of violence. On the streets of New York, at a time when brutal street crime was at an all-time high, or on the battlefield of an absolutely gruesome war. There is also not much that he will raise his eyebrows at or give his nod of approval at. Mtano's instruction on these dvds caused him to do both, many times!

I found the training to be easy to follow, thorough, and very to-the-point. So for this and the approval of a man who has worn a both a badge and medals with honor, I give Battle Drill - Combat Street and it's instructor, Mtano Loewi, the highest rating possible.

If you are in the market for solid self defense information and want great product - THIS IS IT.",1410566400,4,1925,4.330555555555556
6356566,5,B00JFKNFEO,"My REAL Hollywood Martial Arts Action Endorsement.

I saw one of the other reviewers, Jack, make mention of Hollywood Martial Arts stunts and how this set of Self-Defense DVDs is not anything like that. Well, being that I am a real Hollywood action movie star and have headlined in pictures that a lot of you grew up watching, I'm here to tell you that he is right on! I just wished when I was acting that I had this DVD then, I'm sure it would've definitely help my stunts.

Mtano Loewi is the real deal, not movie make believe. You don't get to do second takes with real life violence and you don't get willing stunt people to take the fall from fake punches and flashy kicks.

I am glad my husband and I watched these DVD's and I'll be sitting my daughter down who is 20, to make her watch them, too!

Mtano is a genuine Combatives Instructor and he gets right to the point from the very first video. He doesn't spend time showing you a bunch of moves that won't work. He gets right to the stuff that you need to kick some serious butt - fast.

I highly recommend Battle Drill Self-Defense DVDs if you are serious about your own and your families safety and protection. You will not be let down by what you get and you won't be left swinging empty punches while the real life criminals take advantage of you!",1410307200,2,1311,4.291497975708502
6356567,5,B00JFKNFEO,"This isn't some flashy, Madison avenue produced ninja style program.  This covers basic, protective moves to keep your butt out of troubling situations.  Two guys in a gym demonstrate the simple steps to take when assaulted by an aggressor.  This is a personal protection program rooted in experience, not taken from a text book.  The instructors use the whole-part-whole approach to skills teaching.  They show you what it looks like, they take it step-by-step so you can practice the moves, then they put it all back together, sometimes with variations to meet the circumstances that could develop in an encounter.  Short, yet packed lessons really make this easy to learn.",1409443200,5,675,5.090909090909091
6356568,5,B00JFKNFEO,"These Battle Drill DVD's were clearly made for one reason only: preparing you for the absolute worst.  If you are ever caught in harms way and your life depends on it, what is found on these videos is what you should put into action.

There is no Martial Arts here, just straight Military Combatives.  If it worked for WW2 soldiers, agents, and spies - it will work for you, too.  Mtano, the instructor, does not mess around.  He shows you exactly what works and what doesn't.  Regardless of size or strength, he shows you how to leverage your bodies power and your weight to put everything behind these defensive techniques.

I wish you could find more training like this in the world to help us protect ourselves from all the craziness out there, but since you are here you are in the right place!

Get these DVD's without delay and let's hope you never actually have to use it... but if you do you'll be glad you got the real goods here and not some kind of fluff that won't work in your time of need.",1409184000,3,1004,4.360215053763441
6356569,5,B00JFKNFEO,"This is a really good self-defense training course.  It is good for absolute beginners like myself, and for more experienced martial artists who want to learn some new moves.

I am a 60+ woman, very out of shape.  I just wanted to learn some self-defense moves I could use if needed.  The course taught some moves that even I can use if am attacked.  And the instructor, Mtano, explaind which moves work and which ones don't work at all.  Mtano also gave clear explanations on how to use his techniques, and how to avoid injury.

I learn better from videos rather than books.  Especially when you are trying to learn martial arts and self-defense moves.  These videos were very clear.  You could see the moves from several angles.  Mtano's explanations were very clear.

I will be sharing this course with my sisters and friends.

I recommend this course to anyone who needs to learn self-defense.  We all could find ourselves in a dangerous situation someday, so pick up this course and learn some good self-defense techniques.",1408924800,2,1028,4.767045454545454
6356570,5,B00JFKNFEO,Right from the very first lesson Mtano makes you feel like you can protect yourself. I cannot believe how quickly I have gained the confidence I now have. I totally recommend these DVD's to all woman who think they may be past being able to defend themselves! Go for it!,1408924800,,270,4.42
6356571,5,B00JFKNFEO,"Mtano clearly explains, demonstrates, and walks you through basic fundamentals of self defense. These are tools to be used in a realistic setting when you have everything to lose.
The foundation he provides in his DVD's is solid and reliable. This isn't about quick fixes, or cool moves that impress onlookers, he gives the keys necessary to survive and attack, robbery, or anything else someone with malicious intent plans to do.

His explanation of why each move works gives you confidence that when you apply the techniques you will be effective. Law enforcement, military, and the average citizen can all benefit from this DVD set. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants a solid foundation to build upon when learning and mastering self defense.",1407888000,4,754,5.032
6356572,5,B00JFKNFEO,"I know watching the Battle Drill lessons is helping me. The other night I watched a television show where a berserk patient suddenly strangled his doctor.  The first thought that came to mind was that I knew what she should have done to stop her attacker. Instinctively, I knew what I would do if it happened to me, and I'm confident I would have won.

I shouldn't have been surprised because Mtano Loewi is an excellent instructor. Each step is shown in detail and thoroughly explained. It's a real testimony that I learned the lesson well enough to know exactly what to do without having to think about it.

As a homeschool mom, I'm using the DVDs for teaching self-defense to my son as part of his physical education course this year!",1407542400,,737,4.568181818181818
6356573,5,B00JFKNFEO,"5-stars.  Finally Mtano has commited some of his key moves to DVD and put it out there for the all the public to benefit from.  I train in several martial arts (Jeet Kune Do, Shooto, Muay Thai, Kick Boxing, Tae Kwon Do Kali etc.) and the self defense tactics Mtano employs is not just theoretical or for sport, they work in the environment for which they were designed.  that is..  is on the street, real-world encounters where no rules are the rules.  Several years ago, I was fortunate to have the opportunity to attend one of Mtano's impromptu classes and was amazed at how effective just the handful of techniques he showed in that class were.  I could feel immediately the intended pain and with seemingly little effort on his part.  I was even able to get a few of his techniques to work on him after just a few quick pointers. Mtano has obviously has invested a great many hours in both creating and testing his techniques.  Most of his techniques (especially the finger locks series) require little strength, but if applied properly really deal out quite a bit of pain to your opponent or attacker.  Several moves are simple and direct and like Wing Chun that was invented by a women an Aikido in their own ways utilize your opponent's strength against himself.  I also feel many of Mtano's teachings would be well suited toward women seeking effective self-defense tactics.  Well done Mtano!!!",1407369600,3,1402,4.681632653061224
6356574,5,B00JFKNFEO,"This was a nice little of DVDs with real practical information. We haven't gotten through the whole thing but I was impressed enough with the quality to take some time out of my day and pop on here and write a review.

I like that it's broken into categories by DVD. I like the breakdown of information into modules within each DVD.

So far, I've learned more confidence from what I've watched...",1406505600,2,396,4.486111111111111
6356575,5,B00JFKNFEO,"There is a bunch of horrible martial arts stuff that's been put out out over the years - from crappy ""training"" that looks like it's been copied onto DVD from old VHS tapes to the cheesy Hollywood B-movies with ""martial arts moves"" wouldn't work to fight your way out of a wet paper bag.

Do some people really think that would actually work in a real life fight? I saw another reviewer comment about the Karate Kid and how movie goers ran out to sign up for karate after seeing the flick. I have to laugh, but it's so true! People just can't tell the difference between fake fighting and what would actually happen on the street in a real fight.

Thankfully, Battle Drill - Combat Street can fill in the details on what it really takes to defend yourself from real violence - like an ambush style street attack or home invasion. One of the things that I love about the videos (which there's 4 of them in the package!) is that the instructor, Mtano, goes over the details and angles of every movement with a fine tooth comb.

If you are used to seeing crappy martial arts ""instructional"" videos where you can't even see what is really going on, or the action goes by so fast that you have to rewind it a million times just to see what happened, then you will be really excited by the quality production on these DVD's!

Every technique is shown multiple times and from different angles. Mtano does them slowly at first, then faster, then at full speed. Well, maybe not actually at HIS full speed or his training partner would have been wasted by the end.

You won't be sorry when you pick up these training DVDs. The training content you get is world class. It is definitely military grade, with very clear and accurate demonstrations so YOU can learn it.",1406419200,2,1755,4.454828660436137
6356576,5,B00JFKNFEO,"WOW... That's the first thing I have to say about these self-defense DVDs!!! They sure are a lot different than everything else that's on the market. Let me tell you that there is absolutely NO FLUFF on these discs just straight combatives training. The instructor, Mtano, is all business when it comes to realistic self defense. His techniques for getting out of chokes are like no others I have seen before. In fact, it makes me question the validity of everything else being taught out there by other instructors... If you're in harms way, do you really want to feel like what you have been taught might not work? Do you really want to put your life in question -- Not me!

I can't stress enough how great this self defense training is. I intend on going through these again with my son as soon as we can. I also think I'm going to convince my wife to take a look as well. There is something to be learned from novice all the way to advanced on these discs. Mtano goes over nuances and details that just don't seem to be found elsewhere.

Overall I give the Battle Drill - Combat Street DVD series my highest recommendation. This world we live in just gets crazier and crazier everyday. With all the robberies, home invasions, muggings, and violent attacks, don't put into question the welfare of your family!  If you truly care about the level of training you get to protect your family and home - BUY THESE DVDs NOW!!! You won't regret it, but you might if you don't.",1406246400,11,1472,4.4646840148698885
6356577,5,B00JFKNFEO,"These DVDs are great! It is so easy to follow the instructions and see what each move is supposed to look like. I wasn't sure at first if these would work for women, but after watching and doing a little practice, it's actually quite easy to do. Highly recommended!",1406246400,3,265,4.428571428571429
6356578,5,B00JFKNFEO,"I felt like I was right there in the gym with Mtano. The instructions were easy to hear and Mtano did a great job of demonstration with his assistant. I picked up lots of valuable knowledge from watching these DVDs. Posturing, stance, movement, striking, and different takedowns and escapes provides even a beginner with actions they can take if ever placed in a defensive situation. I recommend these DVDs for anyone concerned about what they would do if threatened with bodily harm. Get this now while you're thinking about it.",1406160000,3,529,4.888888888888889
6356579,5,B00JFKNFEO,"Over the years I have seen a lot of fads come and go.  I have seen Kung Fu movies drive the notion that it is the ultimate Martial Art.  I have seen a single movie about Karate make kids go out in droves and put on headbands and fight themselves in the mirror.  There was even a little movie in the 70's about boxing that made everyone want to fight a slab of beef hanging from a hook and drink raw eggs to show their manliness.  One thing is for sure, though, none of these displays of art or sport ever truly found their way to be used in the pure defense of a man's life on the battlefield.

Mtano Loewi's DVD product, Battle Drill Combat Street, encapsulates William Fairbairn's military training that has somehow all but been lost.  Mr. Loewi shows live and in full motion what was, up until now, only available in a book or, if you are lucky enough to have as many years under your belt as I do, live and in person.  Fairbairn's fighting manual was a classic, but now you can get to see it live and direct on these DVD's.

This guy really knows his tactics.  Clearly, Mr. Loewi trained for years in what is real self-defense (vs what is unusable fairy dust) and it really shows.  If you are in the market for some realistic combatives and self-defense training that could save your life, rather than further the possibility of getting you killed, this is it.

Don't hesitate in buying these things.  They are a far cry from your average B.S. martial arts training videos.  Even if you think you ""know it all"" already in regards to unarmed combat training, the nuances and explanations regarding technique found on these discs is instruction at it's finest.  I found myself picking up more and more from watching them over again.

If you're one of the many people that has gotten caught up in the latest mixed martial arts fad, then it's time to check out the first real MMA. Only this stuff was developed for combat, not the ring.  When you are in harms way your life depends upon your split reaction to potentially extreme violence.  Follow what Mr. Loewi shows you on these discs and you will be successful.  It's not art and it's not pretty, but it's really damn effective and that's exactly what you need.

I cannot recommend this product enough.  I have seen enough people put their beliefs into ineffective training and, unfortunately, costing them their lives.  I hope I see more from Mr. Loewi and his Battle Drill program in the years to come.  The world needs more of it.",1405814400,24,2487,4.45575221238938
6356580,5,B00JFKNFEO,"The techniques demonstrated in this self defense series are practical, fast and effective. There is also a focus on hand injury prevention by the utilization of ""open hand techniques"" that prevent the usual knuckle and wrist injuries sustained from punching with a closed fist. These techniques can be easily utilized by anyone with or without prior martial arts training.",1405209600,15,372,5.322033898305085
6356581,5,B00JFKNFEO,"These Battle Drill Combat Street videos put military combatives training into a whole new light. Unlike regular martial arts stuff, there is no fluff. These aren't about art or form- just straight kicking ass when you need it most. I'm glad I got these, they are a refreshing change after wading through all the crap instruction out there!!! These dvds are top notch. Mtano comes across as a genuine instructor and doesn't pull any punches as to what he thinks is effective vs. something that can get you killed. There is a lot of detail in his instruction. Also, the videos have been shot with different camera angles so I could see everything that was being shown. Most of the self-defense training videos out there have really bad sound and are just shot in some class where you can't really see or hear what is being taught - these dvds aren't like that at all. Get these videos. Period. They are well worth the money and Mtano is wealth worth learning from! Awesome stuff.",1404950400,21,977,4.620689655172414

8650572,5,B00JFKNFEO,"On the path toward getting my black belt in Karate, Ive seen a lot of different training techniques and styles of self defense. Some have been more traditional artistic Martial Arts, while others more practical and functional, such as ground defense workshops and gun and knife defenses Ive learned. Mtano Loewi's Battle Drill - Combat Street training DVD series sits firmly on the side of being both practical and functional. As its creator claims, it's all the ""Martial"" without the ""Art.""

Mtano's way of teaching self defense is direct and to the point. He pulls no punches (pun totally intended) on educating you on what won't work in defending yourself in real life, and backs it up with showing you exactly what WILL. I think this is important because theres just so much misinformation being taught today!

What I liked about the DVDs is that they are well labelled on the boxes and indexed on the individual discs so that you can easily find specific segments if you need to go back and review them again while training, or if you want to jump around.

As an instructor, Mtano clearly knows his stuff and teaches it in an easily understandable way. The multiple camera angles give you a better view of everything that is being taught.

If you're looking for some good, solid, effective self-defense training videos, look no further. Battle Drill - Combat Street delivers everything it promises to, and more!",1432252800,3,1416,4.838842975206612

8650578,3,B00JFKNFEO,"First off, a bit about me. I'm an experienced martial artist, and have studied karate, Taekwondo, JDK, and Muay Thai. I mostly bought this video because I was looking for a video to help me diversify my skills, and because I read some of the glowing reviews.

While I think Mtano has a lot to offer, I cannot in good conscience recommend this video to anyone without at least a year of formal training. With all due respect to my fellow reviewers, the idea that this guide could make one ""confident in their abilities to defend themselves"" is laughable at best. Throughout his entire presentation, Mtano does not offer a single counter to a straight-up punch in the gut. Yes, I'm serious. And while knowing how to break a choke is great, I think violent opponents are far more likely to punch you than choke you unconscious. Even if this were not true, teaching a novice how to put an opponent in a submission hold before teaching them how to avoid all types of incoming blows is highly irresponsible. Additionally, while the moves presented in this video are excellent for someone about the same size and strength as an attacker, they are much less effective against a bigger and stronger opponent. I'm sure Mtano can do it, but a 120lb woman shouldn't expect to floor an attacker with a single strike to the head.

Now, to those of you who have had some training. I can fully recommend this guide to anyone looking for some good grappling/infighting tactics and moves. Mtano speaks very clearly, takes his time demonstrating his moves, and never moves too fast. Excellent content, very well presented.

TLDR: If you're a fighter experienced with the basics looking for some good infighting or grappling techniques, this is your DVD. If you aren't, don't buy this, and above all, don't try to grapple with a violent attacker just because you saw a professional do it. Invest in a personal alarm or some pepper spray instead, it will serve you much better",1413936000,18,1955,4.7105263157894735
8650579,5,B00JFKNFEO,"These Battle Drill Self-Defense DVD's ROCK!!!  Although, I am one of the LUCKY people that has got to train with Mtano in person, these videos show his instruction from angles you just don't always get to see live.  Depending on where you are standing at an event when he's showing techniques, you can't always pick up everything that is going on.  Well, let me tell you - on these DVD's you can see EVERYTHING.  The videos were shot from a bunch of different angles and Mtano goes through each move multiple times, so you really get your money's worth as far as seeing every little detail.

Also, Mtano is truly a world class instructor.  I can't imagine anyone who could be better.  The precision and accuracy that he gives his students is by far and above everything I have witnessed out in the marketplace today.  Furthermore, he never wastes your time.  There is absolutely NO FLUFF in this stuff.  He just doesn't spew the B.S. that most martial arts instructors do.

There's no bowing. No pajamas. No chicken dances. No battle cries. No wishy-washy concepts.  Just the cold hard facts and AWESOME training skills to back it up.

Battle Drill is based on William Fairbairn's techniques, but SERIOUSLY enhanced by modern day science and technology.

Although I can't say enough good stuff about this program, I think I've given you enough of the picture - now go get get your hands on these DVD's!!!",1412812800,3,1404,4.700819672131147
