4934789,3,B00632KUNG,"""It's all coming back to you"". You may think of that tagline for Cartoon Network's Boomerang channel when you watch these cartoons. They may seem familiar. Not because you remember them from childhood, although you may. Not because you're one of the lucky few to have Boomerang on your cable TV. Rather, it's because you recently watched Saturday Morning Cartoons, 1960s vol. one, and, as one reviewer astutely noted, this is unaccountably the same set. No place does it say on the cover it's a reissue, but Warner Bros didn't have to hire a writer for the copy, as the copy is copied from the other set. Open the box, and there are the same two DVD discs, and they both say ""Saturday Morning Cartoons 1960s Vol. One"".

Do the many fans of classic Hanna-Barbera cartoons who advance ordered this set and waited for its arrival feel ripped off? You bet we do. But the good news is, if for some reason you didn't already get Saturday Morning Cartoons 1960s Vol. One, it's really a great set of 33 cartoons, and not just the four characters shown on the 4 Kids cover. It's too great to go into here.

Maybe Jerry Beck knows why this happened. Regardless, these are the cartoons that built H-B into the giant studio it became in the '60s and ensuing decades. These were what you raced out of bed Saturday morning to watch, when there were only three networks, and at one time all three were showing H-B 'toons. Many of these cartoons hold up remarkably well, and in the golden age of Cartoon Network, the late '90s and early 2000s, many of the artists and animators working there took their design cues from these H-B 'toons from three decades before, and many, like Scott Shaw, made their 'toons in tribute to the leading lights of H-B's early days.

But now some suit has decided no one wants to see these, and all the later shows are being sold as DVDRs, custom made, and at a premium price. The downside of that is that the price probably won't go down, and it's far out of pocketbook range for anyone who'd want it. Exactly backwards. My idea would be to put out all the old H-B cartoons under the Boomerang banner, which is what these two sets (which are the same set) actually are. If you missed the boomerang on its way out as Saturday Morning Cartoons, don't miss it on its way back as 4 Kid Favorites. But you only need to grab it once.",1327449600,13,2574,4.7797752808988765
