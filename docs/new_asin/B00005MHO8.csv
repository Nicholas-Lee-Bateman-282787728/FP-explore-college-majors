8376242,4,B00005MHO8,"This is an amazing DVD containing two great DJ's of Reggae Music. You can choose between an old concert of Tiger in England which really is a part of Dancehall history and an incredible performance of Capleton in Club Amazura NYC. I Just say `The Prophet` ago bun di place.
This is a must have for all fans of Reggae music and personally I don't get tiered of watching it again and again.
(Capleton concert doesn't have the best sound quality that's why I rated just four stars for the whole DVD.)",1028160000,,497,4.413043478260869
