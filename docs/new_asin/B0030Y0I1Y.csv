4047396,5,B0030Y0I1Y,"I'm a fourteen year old girl, and I LOVED THIS!!! I went into the theater thinking this was going to be some lame teen vampire romance movie- it wasn't!!! This was kind of scary, and hilarious at the same time. It's all about a boy who is turned into a vampire and(duh) becomes the assistant to a vampire in a travelling freak show. The main guy, Darren, never wanted to be a vampire, but his best friend Steve did. Steve becomes jealous and joins the ""bad"" vampires, and they have a really cool fight scene at the end. The special effects aren't cheesy, and didn't make me laugh during all the fight scenes like the ones in Twilight did. Not to mention the two main guys are really cute! Me and my friend were glued to the screen the entire time, and didn't even leave the theater for a free popcorn refill! I LOVED THIS MOVIE!",1258848000,11,828,4.314102564102564
4047397,5,B0030Y0I1Y,"I did not know what to expect from this film.  My wife really wanted to go and the trailers looked good - so we went.

The film had been out for only two weeks and was now showing in very few places which was not a good sign.  When we got there, the theater was almost empty which was also not a good sign.

The movie was outstanding.  It held my attention for the whole time.  It was at once funny and serious.  The thread of morality that ran through it was very thoughtful.  For me, it had the sense of a European ""art"" film - perhaps a little too subtle for a few critics.

If you can get to see it, do so.  If not, rent it when it comes out.  I doubt you will be disappointed.",1258416000,7,681,3.86231884057971
4047398,2,B0030Y0I1Y,This neither makes it as a shock movie or a thinking piece. I realize that this is for a teen market. I don't think the people who made this movie knew that. I can enjoy most teen marketed movies in this genre. I was frankly bored.,1257638400,,231,4.043478260869565
4047399,5,B0030Y0I1Y,"After seeing the commercials and the trailers, I honestly thought nothing of it, I didn't think it would be that good. Just a Twilight copy just like everything else right? Boy was I wrong. I have watched many Vampire movies in my day and this had to be one of the most original! I was blown away! This is a definite must see; especially for all of us vampire fans out there!",1257638400,3,375,4.222222222222222
4047400,5,B0030Y0I1Y,"yes, it was creepy.
yes, it was not for the faint of heart.

but it wasn't gory. and it wasn't ultra violent. and it wasn't without heart.

it was just superior film making. the opening credits made me excited for the film, and the creativity carried through.
the acting was believable and the special effects kept my eyes glued to the screen.

it was good silly fun to see on halloween. This is much in line with what i always wanted the ""Goosebumps"" series to be...

it isn't making a load of cash at the box office, which makes me sad due to the introduction to a world that could spawn other films with even larger budgets based off of the other books... and i'm amazed at the critics poor reviews!

it was somewhere between Wizard of Oz & Big Fish

4047401,2,B0030Y0I1Y,"Cirque du Freak is based on the first trilogy of The Saga of Darren Shan, a set of twelve books (four trilogies) by the Irish writer Darren O'Shaughnessy. These teen/young adult oriented novels have a worldwide following and been translated to over 25 languages.

Darren is a teen with a charmed life: popular, smart, from an upper class family, he is destined for a productive and orderly life of college-job-family. This order however is disrupted one night, when, after some prodding from his troubled best friend Steve, Darren attends a late night performance of Cirque du Freak. When Darren's actions put Steve's life in danger, a vampire performer from Cirque du Freak is the only one with the power to save the young man. And so, Darren strikes a deal: in exchange for his friend's life, Darren will abandon his family and become the vampire's assistant; a half vampire himself. Unbeknownst to him, a war has been brewing between the two fractions of the vampire world. Both Darren and Steve are destined to be major players in the coming events...

Even though, clearly, I am beyond the teen/young adult years, I found the story compelling enough to investigate further. I am pleased to report that most of the film's production values, including CGI, were impeccable. John C. Reilly as the vampire Larten Crepsley was surprisingly convincing. The number of big name actors who made an appearance in the film was astonishing. So, why only two stars? Well, there were two major problems:
1) The actors chosen to portray Darren and Steve not only lacked chemistry, but lacked the abilities to emote deep feelings. Consequently, what should have been a dramatic decision to leave his family comes across as nothing more then a minor blip on Darren's schedule. What should have been a complex feud between two friends who go on to become leaders of the opposing vampire fractions, seemed as nothing more then two silly characters bickering at one another.
2) Secondly, even though the story was great, the script was poor. Despite the fact that we learned of the events in a chronological order, their lack of clarity was unacceptable.

The film ended with many unanswered questions. Counting on audience support, there were three sequences planned, one for each trilogy. I suppose those plans must be on hold at the moment, given the poor turn out at the box office. Shame really. I think the books disserved better...",1256601600,3,2423,4.919315403422983
4047402,5,B0030Y0I1Y,"Darren Shan (Chris Massoglia) buys his freedom with perfect school attendance and straight As. But deep down inside, he's not ready for the College-Marriage-Family scenario his parents are preparing him for.

He likes spiders and imagines werewolves.  His best friend, Steve, (Josh Hutcherson) convinces him to cut class for the first time.  Then, to attend a freak show.

Big surprise, these freak are real.

One particular freak, red-haired Larten Crepsley (John C. Reilly) has the most beautiful and deadly spider that Darren's ever seen. If asked, he couldn't tell you why he stole the highly poisonous Madame Octa, but the consequences force him to become a half-vampire and become Crepsley's servant to save his family and his friends. Unwittingly, he steps in the middle of a war between two differently evolved species of vampires.

The film's suitable for an audience of 9 or above.  Some gross and dark elements, but about on the level a young adult story.  Arachnophobes will probably only be uncomfortable when a real spider is depicted.

The situation just gets odder from here. The film is directed by Paul Weitz, working for the first time without his brother, Chris, and is based on the Little Brown Books for Young Readers series by the same name written by Darren Shan.  At present, this is the first book in a series of four with hopefully more films to follow.

It rattled a bit when shook and when it was opened today we discovered that part of the center plastic had broken and had been moving all around and sratched the disc up severely. It still played mostly ok but a brand new disc shouldn't be scratched up like it was several months old.,1514160000,,380,4.291666666666667
4047428,3,B0030Y0I1Y,"If you're interested in this movie because you enjoy the books, be warned: this isn't the books. At all.

Major changes to the story line were made. Events in the books appear out of order, some events never even happened in the books, and yet even more events from the books never made it to the movie. They left the ending as though they were going to do a sequel, but never followed through. I imagine that's because most of the viewers were fans of the book series and were disappointed by the movie.

I would love to see this remade with the care and dedication that both the Lord of the Rings trilogy and the Harry Potter series received. This film has a lot of potential, as do the books. If only someone would bring to life the books in a way that would appease the readers.

The reason I've decided to give this 3 stars is because, as a stand-alone movie, it's not bad. However, the supposition that it's based on the books is more ""loosely based"" that actually based. I adore the books and the entire story it weaves. Although, I admit, they shouldn't have ever been considered to be ""teen"" appropriate. I read the books as a teenager, and have collected them as an adult, and I still find parts of the books to be disturbing; and I avidly binge-watch The Walking Dead.**

The pg-13 rating numbs the blood and gore scenes where there's no blood and guts. The ending is too happy and it kills the ominous feeling of what's to come from the bad guys in a possible future movie. I'm still waiting on a sequel that will hopefully be rated R.

I'm not usually one to have high hopes when it comes to movie adaptations from books, but this movie did a decent job. Obviously, it isn't going to be exactly like the books. I mean, it's a 12 book series. Come on, now. But, there are bits of loyalty to the source material threaded through. I loved John C. Reilly as Larten. I wasn't too thrilled with the portrayal of Steve in this movie, but it wasn't terrible. I don't expect a sequel.

All in all, it's a decent weekend movie. Nothing too special. Fans of the book series should check out the manga adaptation. Now, that's interesting.",1498435200,,690,4.390625

The books are rather short and only around 250 pages so combining 1-3 made sense, however, the writers jumped to book 9!!!  This movie eliminated one of the final twists, essential, characters, added random characters that did nothing for the plot or for viewing pleasure. The cast selection was also atrocious, John C. Reilly as Crepsley is an insult to the character. Not that Reilly has not enjoyed success in other films this is NOT one of them. I've read these books as they came out and usually finished that singular book in the same day. I am an avid fan and have read them multiple times and this movie is an injustice to the craftsmanship of Darren Shan and his Novels and therefore, this monstrosity of a movie should just endure a ""Fahrenheit  451"" moment.",1483574400,2,844,4.657718120805369

Larten is a serious, honest. trustworthy, honorable vampire, but they managed to turn him into this joke. Mr. Tiny's actor is not tiny whatsoever, he does not have white hair, nor does he wear his signature yellow, and gold suit. I don't even recall seeing his heart shaped pocket watch.

The end left you wanting to see a sequel, which we all know sadly did not happen.  I am currently reading the third book.  The movie does not do the books or the author justice.  The books are a lot darker and more thought provoking.  Some great actors in this film, but the move was competing with the Twilight series that was never portrayed as a comedy, and did stick more to the books then this film did.  Of course the author of the Twilight series was on site when her books were turned into scripts, then movies.  Perhaps if that had happened in this movie there would have been sequels.",1441929600,4,699,4.364341085271318

4047641,5,B0030Y0I1Y,"Finally saw this movie, and want to specify to anyone who's read the books- these are very much two different entities, and if you go in expecting them to closely follow the events of the first three books that it was based on, you're going to be disappointed.  To be fair, this was in part necessity; the books were too short on their own to provide enough compelling material for an entire movie, but seeing as the first three books take place over the span of several years, there is no way they could've done this without changing things.  The key plot points were all hit, but the stuff that happened in between them went from kind of different to radically so as the story progressed.  I do think they changed more than they necessarily had to, but in all honesty, I can't really say it was a bad thing that they did.

The story was clever and funny, and the characters were all very enjoyable.  The only thing that I can say I was disappointed about was the freak show itself- being a very intriguing part of the book and one that I was really looking forward to seeing, I wish they had just left it alone in terms of how it was staged and paced.  They moved through it too fast and didn't focus on the individual characters enough!  That said, though, they do focus more on the characters later on, add a few, and overall give some of the individual characters more personality than they had in the book.

All in all, I think I'd say I'm a fan of the books and the movie for different reasons, and I'm glad to have been able to experience both these aspects.  They were both enjoyable in their own right, and despite being the same story, aren't things I would necessarily want to compare, as they feel like they were intended for different audiences.  If you enjoy this genre of film/literature as I do, I definitely would recommend.  If you're a fan of the books... enter with an open mind, and don't expect a retelling of the first trilogy.  You might be surprised to find this movie, while different, has definite charm.",1410825600,,2032,4.418230563002681

4047662,1,B0030Y0I1Y,"This movie is complete and utter garbage. I started reading the book some time in '04-'05, as I had always loved vampires. I was three years old when I was introduced to ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" and I completely fell in love with the idea of vampires.

Anyway, I read the entire series pretty quickly; it's a riveting tale of a young man who, through a series of basically just unfortunate events, becomes a vampire's assistant. He is then forced to join a vampire on multiple epic journeys. There are battles, hearts are broken, people die, and all-in-all I found this to be a pretty serious book. I laughed, I cried, I reread the series so many times, the covers on every copy are worn.

I heard the movie was coming out during my freshman year of high school. Kids were calling it ""The Twilight Spoof"". (Twilight came out FOUR YEARS AFTER ""The Vampire's Assistant"") First of all, the trailer alone made me want to gouge my eyes out; Crepsley is completely wrong. He's not supposed to look comical and he is not a comedian. Everything in this movie was wrong; it didn't follow the book nearly as well as it could have and it turned it into a stupid kid's spoof movie. I understand movies are never as good as the book, but this really never should have been released. From the moment I started watching this movie to the moment that it ended, I felt embarrassed for Darren Shan.

I guess if you haven't read the books, it's an okay movie, but even then, it's not even that funny. Not to mention, there's no way they can make a second movie with all that they left out in this one; the second book focuses on things the first book introduced, but the writers of this movie apparently decided these ""details"" were unimportant.",1395100800,4,1728,4.496815286624204

This may be a Young Adult movie but we Older Adults will enjoy it,too. I know I did, so much so, in fact, that I viewed it twice in two days, the second time with my granddaughter. The story treads that fine line between scary and funny, with just enough of each to keep it entertaining. Larten with his fright-wig red hair is a refreshing change from the usual dark foreboding vampire, The dialogue is tongue-in-cheek, the method of becoming a vampire (or a half-vampire) is definitely different. Salma Hayek as a bearded lady in love with Larten and Orlando Jones in the cast add interesting cast characters.

4047729,5,B0030Y0I1Y,"When Darren and his troubled best friend, Steve, visit a traveling freak show, they soon find themselves caught up in a world of supernatural creatures and a prophesied war between two breeds of bloodsuckers, the life respecting Vampires and the murderous Vampaneze. Each of the two teens finds himself recruited to one side. Darren is our good guy, becoming assistant to the vampire Crepsley and moving in with the Cirque Du Freaks, and also forming a relationship with a very cute girl who just happens to have a monkey tail. Steve, on the other hand, is taken in by the mysterious and clearly evil Mr. Tiny, who plans to use him to kickoff a vampire apocalypse.

There's no mistaking when watching ""Cirque Du Freak: The Vampire's Assistant"" that it was one of many attempts to imitate the successful Harry Potter franchise by selecting a young readers' book series and making a big budget movie about it. Though these films/stories can be rather formulaic, they also can be entertaining (and always have at least one gorgeous, upcoming starlet). So, it's a bit sad that they rarely have success in kicking off their intended franchises. Percy Jackson is another great example, though that one seemed more of a Potter copycat attempt than this one (keep in mind that I'm basing this on the films, not the books, as I haven't read any of them). While I still found Percy Jackson entertaining, especially Alexandra Daddario, Vampire's Assistant is a far better film/story. Yeah, it's aimed at a young audience, and that is pretty clear at times, but it's also got some humor and general situations that are a bit more adult, which was surprising, and then there's John C. Reilly, who is constantly amazing me. Of course, you've also got some characters and some actors here who are a bit less likable. Salma Hayek, for example, still can't act, and seeing her grow a beard is so nausea inducing. And, Josh Hutcherson is at his least likable. I guess he is supposed to be, though. Oh, by the way, Willem Dafoe was in this! That was a surprise. I guess they really were trying to make this the American Harry Potter here. Again, a shame it didn't hit. I found this film to be lots of fun, never a dull moment,  and I LOVED Jessica Carlson's ADORABLE monkey girl, Rebecca. I could totally learn to love her tail. Oh, I do have to comment on the film's werewolf though. Very offensive. Not so much the ugly werewolf design they used, but the fact that he was depicted as just a circus animal, like an old lion or something. No human side to him at all.

The Blu-Ray has a lot of deleted scenes, which are very cool. It also has some good ""Making Of"" featurette material, and there's a virtual tour of the circus's camp grounds that introduces some of the characters. I didn't find any trailers or commentary or anything though, so that's a bit lame. Still, this Blu is generally going for a really nice price lately, so not much to complain about, really. I highly recommend it if you find you enjoy these kinds of films. Even though the sequels will probably never be made, it is still entertaining and worth watching on its own. It will leave you wanting more, but it tells its first story completely enough. Plus, monkey girl is sooo cute!",1340668800,,3238,4.627826086956522
4047730,3,B0030Y0I1Y,"I haven't read the books that this movie is based on but I wouldn't be surprised if this film fails to convey the spirit, mood and atmosphere of the written word.  This movie falls just a little bit flat.

The protagonist is a teen named Darren, played by the very pleasant Chris Massoglia.  Through a series of fairly freaky events, he becomes the half-vampire assistant of a vampire circus leader portrayed by John C. Reilly.  Everybody knows that Reilly is an outstanding actor, but my impression is that he never felt comfortable attempting to breathe life into this role and I have to assume that his casting was a mistake.  Reilly never succeeds in being menacing or in being comical.  He seems rather lost.

Another bit of poor casting comes with the young actor who plays Steve, Darren's best friend who ultimately transforms into a nemesis for the teen.  I've seen this actor in other movies, and he always comes across as sullen and smirky and dull.  His limitations as an actor do great harm to the film as a whole because his character should have been quite potent and exciting.

Salma Hayek and Willem Dafoe have very small parts in this film and their appearances are essentially merely cameos.  But each actor is fun to watch and so their brief time on screen does enhance the enjoyability of the movie.  Of course, it would have been nice if they had been given more to do.

All of these negative factors are balanced by the rich, colorful, weird visual appeal of the film.  Although the film portrays a circus of freaks, the freakish stuff never descends into true ugliness.  Young teens should be fairly comfortable viewing what transpires before them on the screen.  The grotesqueries that this film offers will probably be very appealing to male teens, especially.  They may groove on it quite a bit.

Chris Massoglia does a good job in the lead and it is fun to follow his weird adventures for the entire length of the film.  The film has definite flaws and it isn't nearly as entertaining as it should have been, but there really aren't any slow spots and there are always garish images to feast upon.  So, for the right price and for the right audience, this movie isn't a bad choice at all.",1330905600,,2215,4.616368286445013

4047733,3,B0030Y0I1Y,"Based on the novel by Darren Shan, ""Cirque du Freak: The Vampire's Assistant"" is a lively, though decidedly minor, addition to the bloodsucker-mania that's been sweeping through pop culture these past several years.  As the title suggests, the story is about an all-American small town boy (Chris Massoglia) who is turned into a vampire - and then a vampire's assistant - when a mysterious circus freak show comes to town.

The tone of the film is upbeat and sunny despite the inherent darkness of the material, making it an ideal diversion for the teen and pre-teen crowd.  For adults, there are some fun performances by John C. Reilly, Willem Dafoe, Salma Hayek, and Jane Krakowski (""30 Rock"") to make the work at least watchable and palatable, if not exactly a riveting experience or required viewing.",1326758400,,804,4.940740740740741

This movie is a delicious blend of freak show, carnival, humor, Vampires and how the strangest conglomeration of people (living or dead) can still be a family.
No, it is by no means a typical Vampire movie and that's a good thing. The plot is consistent but takes sudden side roads to where you never know what to expect.
The overall effect was a fun ride and is on my special treat shelf for movies I like to watch again and again. I wish there were many more movies like this, that

I could see nod to Fright Night and The Lost Boys and many other vampire films. John C.

I can't give this film a full 4 stars because it is one of those serial type films.

4047749,2,B0030Y0I1Y,"*Note: Review may contain spoilers.

Boy am I glad I didn't go to see this movie in the theater! Cirque du Freak: The Vampire's Assistant  was just not good. Sure, it had a few redeeming moments like some of the vampire special effects and a surprisingly decent cast (John C. Reilly, Salma Hayek,  Ken Watanabe, and Willem Dafoe), but overall it just fell flat for me. It wasn't a comedy, it wasn't a horror, and even though it had a smidgen of romance, I wouldn't quite call it a romance either. It felt like a giant floundering mess that well...sucked, and not in a good way.

To recap, two best friends, Darren and Steve, sneak off to see the visiting Cirque du Freak with its very special line-up of freaks, the least of whom are a vampire, a snake-boy, a bearded lady, a monkey chick, and a bunch of some Gollum-looking little creatures reminiscent of the Dinks from Spaceballs. Remember them? One boy has an affinity for vampires, the other spiders. One boy is perfect, the other not so much. Good versus evil set-up? You betcha. But I'm getting ahead of myself. Darren, the spider-loving boy decides to steal a mesmerizing and beautiful spider from the show, only to have it fatally bite his best friend, Steve. To save Steve from certain death, Darren makes a deal with the head of the freak show to become his vampire assistant or a half-vampire. In a very weird manipulation of events by Mr. Tiny (the obscure and overly flamboyant fat bald dude who is supposed to be the epitome of evil), Steve and Darren find themselves pitted against the other, Darren the half-vampire versus Steve the evil vampanese (aka the bad vampires)...which by the way, doesn't even get resolved. See inset, where they are frozen by Mr. Tiny and the fight is postponed for another time. Ahem, enter the sequel(s) at some point (please...say it isn't so!)

The movie did have some good moments and funny one-liners which allowed me to get through it without turning the television off so at least that's a good thing.

Crepsley to the audience: Thank you ladies and gentlemen. I am so excited to be here in an anonymous small town that used to have character but is now just a bland suburb filled with chain stores and surrounded by slum. It really is a pleasure to be here. And I am SO honored that blah blah blah and so on and so forth and etcetera ad nauseum.

The fight scene between Crepsley (vampire) and Murlough (vampanese) in the cemetery was probably the most exciting part, although not a defining moment enough to salvage the whole film. The acting by the lead high-schoolers left me cold, and completely undermined some of the better acting by the more seasoned cast members like Salma Hayek and John C. Reilly, who were both pretty awesome. This film could have been a lot better than it was, which is disappointing since there seem to be so many fans of the book series.  In the end, The Vampire's Assistant just didn't have any fangs whatsoever and offers very little bang for the bite. Instead it turns out to be a bloodless blahness that is embodied by the film's final somewhat clichd and unoriginal message - ""it's not about what you are, it's about who you are."" Um, ok thanks.

I would rate Cirque du Freak: The Vampire's Assistant 1 and a half out of 5 stars. Just for the record, the half-a-star is for Octa, the blue and red spider that made me giddy with delight and throw up in my mouth at the same time.

The pressures and conflicts the two teenage boys go through are remarkably reflective of real-world teen realities, in spite of the supernatural forces that are driving them.

4047762,3,B0030Y0I1Y,"I tried to like the film. I really did. ""Cirque du Freak: The Vampire's Assistant"" has many good things in it. This is a slightly dark fantasy world with nice special effects and talented actors such as John C. Reilly, Ray Stevenson and Ken Watanabe. Nothing particularly new, you might say, but still attractive enough. What I really don't understand is the film companies (including Universal) hired Paul Weitz as director. I have nothing against him, but obviously he is not the right choice for the job.

The story is about Darren Shan (Chris Massoglia), a young boy living with his perfect family in his perfect community. One day ""Cirque du Freak"" a traveling show with remarkable attractions arrives. It's a spooky night and the red moon is rising. Darren sneaks out of his home and watches the show with his best friend Steve (Josh Hutcherson). However, Darren does one stupid thing there and because of that Steve gets seriously ill. To save his life, Darren meets mysterious Mr. Crepsley (John C. Reilly), who proposes a deal.

Like ""The Golden Compass"" (directed by his brother Chris Weitz), Paul Weitz's fantasy film lacks story, character development and imagination. We are told about the warring fractions of vampires. We meet lots of characters - bearded lady Madame Truska (Salma Hayek), Mr. Tall (Ken Watanabe), Evra the Snake Boy (Patrick Fugit) and Rebecca (Jessica Carlson), a cute girl with a tail. OK, I like the cute girl with a tail, but frankly, well-acted as they are, we don't know who they are, and not many of them are very interesting, including the two boys, Darren and Steve.

I know this is only the beginning of the long-running series, but ""Cirque du Freak: The Vampire's Assistant"" looks like one long trailer for another bigger film. ""Cirque du Freak: The Vampire's Assistant"" looks great and is sporadically engaging. Not exactly a mess, but the film needs a better storyline and something that makes us really care.",1271462400,,1955,4.900302114803625

4047765,4,B0030Y0I1Y,"If you are planning to see any vampire film this spring, I think you should see the ""Cirque du Freak: The Vampire's Assistant .""  The movie is enchanting, entertaining, and visually stunning.  Based on the Cirque du Freak books by Darren Shan, the movie seems to encompass the first two books of the series.  Suspending reality for this movie is effortless with the help of John C. Riley as Larten Crepsley a 200 hundred year old vampire and a main attraction (along with Madam Octa) at the Cirque.  This fun movie, set in an anonymous town, tells the story of two high school boys representing two opposing forces finding themselves entrapped in the world of vampires, freaks, and the walking, talking dead.

Darren Shan, a straight ""A"" student at Beckham High School, and his best friend Steve, from the wrong side of the tracks, have been friends since at least second grade, find them invited to Cirque du Freak as it passes through town.  The boys, admonished not to go by their chalkboard scraping history teacher,Mr. Kersey, the boys go.  Both boys have a secret passion for the perverse.  Darren's, as he explains in a voice over, that spiders captivate him, while Steve, played by Josh Hutcherson, his best friend is fascinated by vampires.  During the freak-show we meet most of the cast, Gavner Purl, (Willem Dafoe looking a lot like a creepy Cesar Romero, during his Joker days), Hibernius Tall (Ken Watanabe), Madam Traska, a bearded lady, (Selma Hayek), Evra Von, the snake man, Rhamus Twobellies, a werewolf and the deceptively large and seemingly evil Mr. Tiny, played by remarkably fit Michael Cerveris.  Mr. Tiny and his henchman Murlough a Vampaneze, approach both boys, trying to recruit them for some evil scheme that he has in the works.  Steve, Darren's best friend, is from a broken home and wants to become a vampire, and interrupts Crepsley  and Gavner while they discuss the state of Vampire verses Vampaneze affairs.  Steve wants to be a vampire, but Crepsley rejects him, stating that he has, ""bad blood.""  All through this film and undoubtedly through out the book series, the author creates his own set of vampire lore.  Steve, rejected meets up with Darren, who stole Madam Octa and wittinessed the rejection scene while hiding in a closet.  At school, the boys get together and inadvertently let Madam Octa loose at school, while trying to catch the spider running amok through the halls, Steve is bitten and falls into a coma.  Darren, in an effort to save Steve's life, trades his life to become a half-vampire and Crepsley's assistant.  Crepsley saves Steve's life and fakes Darren's death, and Darren goes off to live with Crepsley at the Cirque du Freaks winter campground.  The Cirque, a haven for freaks claims neutrality from the two factions of vampires; receives a visit from Mr. Tiny as he requests Darren Shan be turned over to him.  Mr. Tall says he will consider it, setting the stage for the climatic showdown.  Meanwhile, seduced by the dark side and his lust for power, Mr. Tiny recruits Steve to the Vampaneze faction as their future leader.  Like joining a gang, Steve must be initiated and he does so by killing their history teacher, Mr. Kersey.

Oddly enough, Paul Weitz director of ""The Vampires Assistant,"" is the brother of Chris Weitz, director of the new ""Twilight"" movie, ""New Moon,"" the other vampire movie out on DVD.  Both movies focus on teenagers falling in love with the vampire lore, however, I find that ""Cirque du Freak: The Vampire's Assistant,"" fun, fresh, fast paced, and leaves the audience wanting more.  The casting of character actor John C. Riley in the part of Larten Crepsley was smart and refreshing.  Chris Massoglia plays 17-year-old Darren Shan, (pen name for the author Darren O'Shaughnessy) and I feel he does a superb job portraying Crepsley new assistant.  17-year-old Josh Hutcherson plays Steve, taking on the bad-boy role.  The special effects on this movie help the story progress rather than reveal themselves for their own sake.  Stephen Trask's film score, works well for this movie, creepy yet playful keeps the mood interesting.  I enjoyed Nick Cave's ""Red Right Hand,"" playing while Crepsley digs up Darren out of his untimely grave.

Overall, I enjoyed this movie better than the other vampire movie out on DVD and recommend ""Cirque du Freak: The Vampire's Assistant,"" for the whole family.  Note the PG-13 rating, but I think its worth watching.",1270857600,,4445,4.901069518716578

4047768,2,B0030Y0I1Y,"I will try to do this with the least bit of spoilers for people that have not seen the movie or read the books. If you have not seen the movie and are interested in the books, read those first. I saw the movie first and that's how I found the books, I enjoyed the books quite good true that they are for younger audiences but the author does a good job of developing his characters and immersing you on what Daren is going through.

I found a couple of problems with the film adaptation. The casting was plain old horrible, I don't know if its because I'm used to John C. Reilly as a comedian that his role as a vampire did not fit a all, at times I was just annoyed by his change in voice, kind of when Christopher Nolan changes his voice when he wears the batman costume, it just feels so forced and unnatural. I agree that there was no chemistry between Josh Hutcherson and Chris Massoglia, their scenes together were so forced that removed the element that would give the audience the much needed feeling that they were lifelong friends. Other casting atrocities were the casting for Gavner Purl and Murlaugh, honestly Ray Stevenson could have played a much better Gavner than Willem Dafoe (willem is best suited for villainous roles).

As far as the movie its self, its definitely rental material IMO the books are so much better but its still worth a watch. Even with the serious deviations from the books (they showed their hand way too early in the movie) it's a fun movie that starts slow but ends on a cliffhanger leaving you wanting more. I don't know if they will make the rest of the movies If they did I think they would wrap it up in one or two more but given the low turnout for this one I doubt they will continue. After watching the movie I got the books on my Kindle and I have to admit I'm a fan of the series. The story has potential to be an awesome movie but they need to work on casting and keeping the pace up without giving too much of the plot away too early.",1269993600,2,1986,4.251322751322752

There is no gore and little blood, unique for a vampire movie.  The movie carries several good moral messages, e.g. the acceptance of others and realizing that who we are is defined by the choices we make rather than our circumstances. The ending clearly indicates the need for one and I would love to see a sequel but it's doubtful that there will be one.

4047772,2,B0030Y0I1Y,"I just finished watching this film--luckily--before buying it. I will say this, the movie does have its pros as well as its cons, but I feel that the cons outweigh the pros. For any hardcore fantasy film lover like me, I would recommend you see this movie before buying it. I, personally, felt it was worth seeing at least once. Let me make a list of the pros and cons without giving too much away:

Pros: The film has a really good soundtrack. The music is very mysterious and dark, giving this hollow tale a bit more dimension. The beginning credits were animated and very well-sylized, and sets the audience up for a good ride, which, unfortunately, never takes off (the animation combined with the music gave me the same feeling I got when seeing the end credits for A Series of Unfortunate Events--If you see it, you'll understand what I'm talking about). Some of the film's visuals were also quite impressive, such as some of the long shots of the campground where the freaks live. Another positive aspect of this film is the casting of John C. Reilly as the vampire Larten Crepsley. When I saw the trailer for this film, I thought he looked a bit miscast, but I was very wrong. He was probably the saving grace of this movie and was the only character keeping the plot afloat. He plays his role with just the right amount of wit, charm, and sympathy; I wish he would have been used more, since he was the only seemingly three-dimensional character in the film. The special-effects were also well-done (except for the speed-racing colors they used on the vampires when they run at the speed of light), especially when the freaks are showcasing their abilities or deformities.

Cons: I felt there were too many for me to thoroughly enjoy this film. For one thing, I think everyone else, minus John C. Reilly, was miscast. Then again, I have not read the books on which this movie is based, but I have friends who are quite fond of the books and feel that the darkness, the foreboding, and the melancholy from the story, were not translated well onscreen. I would have to agree. I have passed by the covers of the books in my nearest bookstore, and I felt the cover art revealed a darkness and severity that lacked in this film adaptation. The directing is a little off when it comes to the characters. For one thing, the protagonist is as dull as a plank of wood (his animated counterpart in the beginning credits was more entertaining and convincing; they did him too much justice). He delivers his lines so unconvincingly that we, the audience, wonder if he cares about anything or anyone. His parents, on the other hand, seem too lively and caricatures of real parents. When they find out **spoiler** he dies, their faces show no signs of mourning or regret, or doubt **spoiler end**. They were caricatures while they're son was anything but that. In that sense, the film felt unstable. If it were left up to me, I would have cast either a better protagonist and antagonist, or I would have decided to stray from the book and cast college-age young adults to play them with better acting skills. That way, the stakes would seem more important, and, overall, severe. I am a big fan of a realistic approach to fantasy work, as can be seen in some of the latest Harry Potter films. It makes the world real to the audience, and gets them more involved. Sadly, this film did not achieve that. My guess is that the director wanted to make the protagonist and antagonist seem like real teens by making them use the word ""man"" and ""like"" every other sentence, but it only made them seem a little dumb and incapable of pursuing their intricate destinies. In fact, in trying to make them seem real, they came across as rather lame and empty-headed. I actually feel, however, that Josh Hutcherson did a better acting job than the main guy; but then again, he's had more acting experience and has showcased better acting skills in prior films.

Maybe I'm not one to give a valid opinion on this film since I have not read the books and, therefore, cannot compare. However, I do judge this movie as a fantasy film lover who wishes justice would be made to outstanding and iconic works of fiction. I feel filmmakers are at a constant rush to cough out the next big hit, that they forget to make a solid, worthwhile film. Yes, people will pay to see it, but they will not stand the test of time, unfortunately. While watching this movie, I felt myself reworking the tone and plot in my head to make a better film. In my head, I created a masterpiece, but I could not say the same for the crap I was watching onscreen. If they do decide to continue with the Cirque du Freak series, which I strongly hope they do, I hope a new director takes hold of it and truly understands the appeal of this story, which can really be a classic, but only if approached with the right mindset. Instead of watering it down, I say the filmmakers take a chance and make something truly dark, foreboding, and severe.",1268611200,,4988,4.527716186252771

Sixteen-year-old Darren is your typical adolescent; he spends most of his time with his best friend, Steve, earns decent grades, and generally manages to stay out of trouble. But trouble finds Darren when he and Steve make the acquaintance of a vampire named Larten Crepsley while attending a traveling freak show at a local theater. This movie is loosely based on the first trilogy, Vampire Blood. Watching this movie I tried to forget all the things I knew from the books. And yes, this movie experience turned out to be a very enjoyable one. The pace of the movie is pretty good: there's a lot to be told here. There's a lot of humour in it (the books were pretty serious) and the voice-over by Darren Shan works very well. Especially the first 20 minutes (with the actual freakshow) were well done.

When i first went to watch this movie i was expecting a flop. Most movies that i have personally seen that have books of their own have all turned out to be such. They ended up twisting the Cirque du Freak's first novel but by no means was it a flop at all. They took the book and twisted it but instead of messing it up turned it into their own. I must say this is actually my first time rating and reveiwing a movie.

Cirque Du Freak: The Vampire's Assistant is the film adaptation of the first three books of the book series ""The Saga of Darren Shan"" by author Darren Shan. It tells the story of teenager Darren Shan(the authors' pen name)who mistakenly breaks a 100-year-old truce between two warring factions of vampires(the Vampanese & the Vampire Clan) and is pulled into the lives of misunderstood sideshow freaks.

I wasn't expecting much out of this movie considering it's PG-13 but it ended up being a very entertaining movie that ranks up there with the Harry Potter and Percy Jackson movies.

4047784,3,B0030Y0I1Y,"When I caught the trailers for this movie at the local cinema I was rather intrigued. It sported a good cast and seemed to have quite a bit of flair. I was right on both counts but unfortunately that was about all it had. Truth be told this film is a bit of a mess.

There are a couple of things going on in the story but none are well resolved. You have the good and bad kid who are somehow best buds and their friendship is tested. You have a very freaky circus coming into town that is owned by a vampire. Now it turns out there is another strain of vampire known as a vampinese . The two factions are at odds with one another and war between the two is getting closer. It seems there is another ghoulish denizen of the darkness that is trying to make said war happen.

Part of the problem is the casting. I like John C. Reilly but he is mis-cast as the vampire kingpin. He doesn't have the necessary presence and his voice has no authority. I also like Willem Dafoe but his character barely exists. He's in a couple of scenes giving advice but nothing comes of it or him. What's not to like about Salma Hayek, but like Dafoe her character seems to serve no real purpose. She has strong psychic tremors when she's around Chris Massoglia's character but we don't really get what makes him so different and dangerous. (Unless it's the fact he refuses to take blood). Orlando Bloom is here and he's likable enough but he's just one of the freaks. He has no integral relationship to the story. Now....what about the war. We don't see the vampinese or their army so there is no real sense of threat. What about the ghoul dude and his henchmen trying to broker the war with the use of the Massoglia character? What does he gain in seeing this war happen? Too many loose ends for me.

It is a trait for a lot of films to resolve but also leave that little door open at the end in case it becomes a surprise hit and a sequel can turn more profit. But here, very little is resolved and the door is left so wide open you could run a 747 through it.

There is a lot of fun and inventiveness here and it it passes the time well enough but the script needed to be a whole lot tighter. Too many good people and ideas are laid to waste through being unfulfilled. Don't avoid it but don't expect too much either.",1267488000,4,2299,4.182844243792325

The story was enjoyable, and I was blown away by John C Reilly's performance, similar to Johnny Depp's Pirates of the Caribbean performance (admit it- he was the whole reason anybody went to see those movies).  My only complaint is that the script was reduced a little too much, even for the target teenage audience.

4047786,1,B0030Y0I1Y,"Let me just say I recently purchased this film thinking it would be funny and fun to watch. I thought that at worst this film would be decent to watch! Boy was I wrong! Where do I even begin on this movie??? All I can say is I knew I had to post this review because I honestly don't want anyone else making the mistake of wasting their hard earned money on this ""freak"" of a movie.
Anyone who might actually enjoy the movie (and haven't read the book) this whole review does have some spoilers in it (if you could actually spoil this movie any worse than what it already is).

Where to begin.... well....
Firstly, this movie had zero plot, I mean if you call that a plot, seriously people all he pretty much does is walk around with ole shake-n-bake and talk about how he isn't going to drink blood or some other vampire stuff. Then it switches over to his friend (has he ever had acting lessons?? I think not) who is bent on being ""evil"" suddenly! I mean does anyone really buy this whole crap as they are watching this movie???

Secondly as I breifly mentioned in the previous statement, the acting was completely horrible, I felt like I was watching my local school play on video or something. Although the two main boys were bad, the family had to be the worse! I realize they were a small part, but I mean gosh! I could have got out there and made a more convincing parent!!!! I mean none of the actors were even convincing in his/her emitions or otherwise.

Thirdly, this story was not believeible, and yes I know this sounds stupid because it's a vampire movie but it's true. THe way the actors react to horrible situations in this movie, the way the story plays out is so stupid! I mean I hope the book series was completely off from this movie, cuz I would hate to think a story this crazy got published. I understand this is a a vampire story, but still. I mean, firstly, if some guy told me that I had to become a vampire in order to save my friend (when all was needed was the antidote) I'd be like ""what the heck? Are you a freaking nut chase or something? Vampires? If I even believed in vampires, how is me turning into one going to help my friend??"" I mean his whole reaction was not believeible.... Instead he was like I'll do it, as long as you help my friend. I mean really????? Plus, I mean his handler or what ever shake-n-bake is, said you have to fake your death and leave your family forever. and the boy (darren) is like Okay, I guess I have to leave them forever, and he doesn't even shed a tear or put up a real fuss! I mean hello!! If somebody told me I had to do all that I'd be breaking down and have a panic attack!!! I guess ole Darren must really hate his family and friends or some crap... or perhaps, this whole movie just really really SUCKS!!! Then the whole part of how his best friends suddenly hates his guts for no apparent reason. I mean really people??? What the heck is up with this movie?????

Fourthly, don't even get me started on how this movie acted like there was going to be some big important battle at the end!!!! This whole movie lead up like it was Darren's destiny to be the good guy on the non-killin side and the steve boy was suppose to be the ""evil"" one for the killing bloodsucking side and they were going to have an all out battle in the end and somehow the vampire world be changed or something. Instead you get all the way to the end and the two main characters pretty much fight like two year olds and then get broken up by this werido dude (that no one knows who the heck he is or why the heck he's doing any of the crap he's doing, whom I might add randomly shows up for no apparent reason.) Then this werid guy turns his dead vampire dude into some shrunken werid creature. Then Darren goes back to the freak camp and lays down in the coffin... the end!!! I mean seriously people!!! WHAT THE HECKKK??? I mean I was expecting something you know that would actually have an effect on it all, instead you are left knowing less after the movie then before you started watching it. I actually thought after the fight scene that there was a good thirty minutes left and we'd be seeing the real show down. This movie was like stopping in mid sentence and then the rest was just left out there hanging somewhere.

Fifthly, this movie had way tooo much added stupididy!!!!! I mean really if the bad plot, bad acting, and all the other dissappointments weren't enough to make this one of the suckest movies of all time we had to add all this completely unnessary stupididty!!!! For example, we have this werid woman who's limps regrow if chopped or bitten off, kinda like a skink and its tail regrows. Okay, that's fine, but why do we have to watch some werid sexual scene where she rips her finger off then french kisses with the finger in her lover's mouth. I mean ""EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW"" doesn't even cover it. Not to mention the whole crap and extremely fake looking rotten muck thats in the wolfman's cage, and uhhh the werid guck that the shruken people have in their feed tub!!! I'd really like to know the shrunken peoples' purpose, besides bitting at people's hands? I mean really what do these people or the man that calls them his pets really have to do with the movie??? I mean the big guy that rides around in that car makes no sense!!!! I mean you talk about stupid. this guy just shows up outta no where and isn't a vampire, so what business does he have in their business, and talks about destiny all the time and then calls those shrunken people his pets. Which if they are then why the heck are they keeping them at the freak camp??? Because that means they would be knowingly keeping enemies that hear and see everything they do and would be telling their boss/owner??? WOWWWW this movie is so stupid!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I just can't believe it!!!

Need anymore reasons??? I mean really people do you need any more REASONS!!! I just want to scream thinking about how stupid and awlful this movie was. It most defintley makes the tops in the worse movie of all time!!!!",1267401600,4,6039,4.3351016799292665

4047788,4,B0030Y0I1Y,"The Vampire's Assistant is a widely popular series and this movie is loosely based on the first three books.  The books are entertaining and action-packed, but this movie adds multi-dimensional characters and stronger plot line.

The movie is about Darren Shan who becomes a half vampire to save his friend's life.  After that, Darren joins a circus of freaks where his mentor, a full vampire, resides.  John C. Reilly is perfectly cast as Darren's mentor and hopefully will be in any of the sequels that follow.  The rest of the cast is equally good.  The addition of the monkey girl as Darren's potential love interest and the extra array of freaks made the story more colorful and fun. This movie combines light humor, dark fantasy, colorful circus freaks, and action.

We've watched the movie three times, love the action, the freaks, the Little People, and the additions not found in the books.  We're looking forward to the next movie.",1267315200,3,941,4.8742138364779874
4047789,2,B0030Y0I1Y,"Nor do they need this glorified ""after school"" special!

Based on the first three novels in the ""Saga of Darren Shan"" series. It tells the boring story of a young man who makes a pact with an old vampire named Crepsley (John C. Reilly). He does this because he feels responsible for putting his best friend Steve in jeapordy. In this world, vampires do not kill to feed unless you are a vampaneze. Vampaneze? At first I thought this was a vampie of asian descent, but I was wrong. They are just skeevy vampires with bad attitudes. Steve is upset that his best friend stole his dream of being a vampire and winds up going to the vampaneze. Do you care yet? I don't! The two best friends now find themselves on opposite sides of an age-old war, which means there is more crap to come.

This movie fails on a few levels. The story is good enough to make you watch to the end, yet is predictable. The acting is shoddy and the casting is terrible. I didn't know if this was a comedy or a serious horror movie. Reilly is an excellent actor and does a good job, but I'm looking at him and all I can see is Step Brothers and Talladega Nights! The 2 young actors are horrible and convey nothing in their performances. This makes Twilight look like a great vampire flick (and it's not)! If you like vampire movies I suggest ""30 Days of Night"" or the Underworld trilogy.

I thought it was one of the more original movies i've seen in a long time. Sure, it's got some issues with choppy editing in parts, and the movie drags a bit in the beginning. But honestly, I couldn't NOT like it. It has a real charm to it; I can't really put my finger on exactly what makes me feel that way. There has been lots of negative attention paid to the lead actor, but I think that given his lack of experience, he did a fine job, and actually played the role in a very realistic manner, which is maybe why people harped on it so much. John c. Reilly was WONDERFUL...he stole the show. The movie really came alive when he came on screen. It's just a fun movie, plain and simple. It's dark when it needs to be, it doesn't employ unneccesarry amounts of blood and gore and sex. It was actually nice to watch a vampire movie that wasn't full of sweaty chests and heavy breathing.

There isn't much that I think parents would find objectionable; there is some profanity, but nothing worse than a couple instances of the s-word. The violence is kept to a minimum, and the gore is pretty much non-existent. I felt comfortable allowing my 9 year old to watch it. While it was marketed towards teens, I think that adults can certainly relate to the feeling of wanting to escape a life you don't quite fit into, and are just going through the motions of. All in all, a great little film.",1267056000,3,1540,4.273972602739726

The story is original, funny and entertaining and, unlike ""Twilight"", the actors do a great job. In the beginning I wanted to dislike this movie so much, but now I'm actually praising it.

4047796,5,B0030Y0I1Y,"Cirque Du Freak: The Vampire's Assistant took me by surprise more than any other movie last year, and I couldn't wait for it to come out on Blu Ray. Horror comedies, in my opinion, are hard to pull off because the director is trying to serve two audiences at the same time. The Vampire's Assistant pulls this off very well as it simultaneously creates a dark, moody atmosphere while never letting things get too serious.
  You can read about the story in the description, so I won't get into detail about plot elements. The main story moved along at a good pace with never really any down-time or uneccesary scenes. If anything the movie is probably a little on the short side. This film, I believe would have been more well received if some of the characters and plot points were fleshed out a little more. There is simply too much story to cram into just under two hours. Despite the time constraints the cast does an excellent job of creating a dark atmosphere, all centered around the delightfully absurd world of a freak show. The comic elements are subtle but work better than other horror/comedies such as Zombieland (which I also love).
  Visually the film is a delight, with excellent make-up and special effects, as well as sets that perfectly set the tone for each scene. Everything from the old theater, to the graveyard and the freak's camp are visually stunning. The wolf man was probably the most impressive character in the film, and listening to the director (special features) talk about his vision of the wolf man and how it came to fruition in the film was very interesting.
  I typically do not watch the special features, but I watched every single one and came away wishing there had been more. The tour of the freak camp was very cool, and each feature was presented in a creative manner.
  This is a highly underrated film that probably could have done better at the box office with over-the-top gore or slap-stick comedy elements, which have become the status quo for Hollywood blockbusters. I'm not saying this film is for everyone, but if you're into vampire films and don't mind a good bit of comedy to keep things from getting to depressing, then I think you'll really enjoy The Vampire's Assistant.

So, even if I hadn't read the books, I would have probably enjoyed this movie.  But I did read the books, and I thought that this was a very faithful adaptation.  Sure, a purest might quibble with a few plot changes, but they worked quite well.

  The storyline involves a teenager who becomes a vampire's assistant.  He is a really decent kid, and we follow him as he learns about the world of vampires and ""freaks.""  In many ways, the book is actually rather compassionate.  I liked the treatment of the ""freaks.""

  What I particularly liked about the movie was the way the world of the cirque was presented.  I loved the sets, the costumes, the intelligent design in everything.  Finally, while I loved the performance of the stars, I was amazed at all the fine talent in the support cast.  Orlando Jones, as the thin man, is fun, for example.  And I found the depiction of the snake boy very touching.  I thought Mr. Tiny was wonderfully done, along with the ""bad guys.""  I think the performer that played Steve was very, very excellent.

4047800,2,B0030Y0I1Y,"Cirque du Freak is based on the first trilogy of The Saga of Darren Shan, a set of twelve books (four trilogies) by the Irish writer Darren O'Shaughnessy (pen name: Darren Shan, just like his hero's). These teen/young adult oriented novels have a worldwide following and been translated to over 25 languages.

Darren is a teen with a charmed life: popular, smart, from an upper class family, he is destined for a productive and orderly life of college-job-family. This order however is disrupted one night, when, after some prodding from his troubled best friend Steve, Darren attends a late night performance of Cirque du Freak. When Darren's actions put Steve's life in danger, a vampire performer from Cirque du Freak is the only one with the power to save the young man. And so, Darren strikes a deal: in exchange for his friend's life, Darren will abandon his family and become the vampire's assistant; a half vampire himself. Unbeknownst to him, a war has been brewing between the two fractions of the vampire world. Both Darren and Steve are destined to be major players in the coming events...

Even though, clearly, I am beyond the teen/young adult years, I found the story compelling enough to investigate further. I am pleased to report that most of the film's production values, including CGI, were impeccable. John C. Reilly as the vampire Larten Crepsley was surprisingly convincing. The number of big name actors who made an appearance in the film was astonishing. So, why only two stars? Well, there were two major problems:
1) The actors chosen to portray Darren and Steve not only lacked chemistry, but lacked the abilities to emote deep feelings. Consequently, what should have been a dramatic decision to leave his family comes across as nothing more then a minor blip on Darren's schedule. What should have been a complex feud between two friends who go on to become leaders of the opposing vampire fractions, seemed as nothing more then two silly characters bickering at one another.
2) Secondly, even though the story was great, the script was poor. Despite the fact that we learned of the events in a chronological order, their lack of clarity was unacceptable.

The film ended with many unanswered questions. Counting on audience support, there were three sequences planned, one for each trilogy. I suppose those plans must be on hold at the moment, given the poor turn out at the box office. Shame really. I think the books disserved better...",1262649600,45,2469,4.916067146282973

4047802,4,B0030Y0I1Y,"I will preface my review of this movie by saying that I much prefer Blade, From Dusk til Dawn and Underworld type vampire flicks that all have tons of action, violence and gore in them. Whenever you get into the PG-13 world you are going to get a much more friendly and watered down film with less brutality, violence and language. Reality and financing dictates that the movie studios have to appeal to a broader audience when possible to make enough money to allow the films I mentioned previously.

I am not familiar with the book that this movie is based upon. That being said this was a fun 'teen oriented' vampire movie with no significant violence or gore. This is a PG-13 (unfortunately) flick; you know it's going to be in the vanilla spectrum so don't expect Blade or Underworld. The CGI animation and coloring of John C. Reilly's pet spider was amazing, but then again any quality CGI animation done nowadays should be and usually is amazing. The makeup effects, set design and costumes were well done and give the movie an interesting modern Gothic appearance and feel.

The characters were interesting and I found myself pretty involved in the story. Comparing this film to the wildly successful Twilight films, the two out so far any ways, Cirque is much more interesting. There are no moping or perfect looking Twilight characters and Cirque was just more interesting than both Twilight 1 and 2. I love John C. Reilly and vampire movies so this was my primary motivation for seeing this in the theater. Reilly's character was not in his usual comedic or musical roles so it was good to see him do something completely different. Willem Defoe has a smaller role in this film and plays a very interesting vampire character as well.

All in all this movie is worth seeing and if you are a genre fan it is probably worth owning.",1261526400,52,1839,4.6523076923076925
8386267,4,B0030Y0I1Y,"RELEASED IN 2009 and directed by Marco Brambilla, ""Cirque Du Freak: The Vampires Assistant"" is a fantasy/horror/comedy about a teen (Chris Massoglia) who is compelled to join a circus of freaks where he becomes (you guessed it) the assistant of a vampire (John C. Reilly) and learns of a war between two classes of vampires. Josh Hutcherson is on hand as his best friend while Michael Cerveris plays the mysterious Mr. Tiny. Ray Stevenson is formidable as a vampiric heavy.

After the mega-hit of Twilight (2008), producers naturally thought that another young adult book series involving vampires might be profitable. As such, this movie is based on the opening trilogy of the 12-book series Cirque du Freak: The Saga of Darren Shan by Darren Shan (pen name of Darren O'Shaughnessy). It mostly focuses on the first book with uber-fans of the books complaining about deviations. In any case, the film wasn't a hit at the box office (costing $40 million and making back $39 million worldwide with $14 million of that made in North America). Regardless, I much prefer it to Twilight.

For some reason I always enjoy stories that center around life in circuses and carnivals. The excellent Water for Elephants (2011) is a good example. While that movie was decidedly realistic, The Vampires Assistant is obviously rooted in fantasy.

The first act is a low-key introduction to the two teen friends, their situation in life, and their intriguing visit to the Cirque Du Freak, which in English means The Freak Circus. The film improves in the second act with the excellent character of Larten Crepsley moving to the spotlight. Reilly is commanding and fascinating in the role. The third act is also really good, centering on the war between the vampires and the vampanese. The plot is involved enough without being too complex and the movie is impressively imaginative on practically every front.

Salma Hayek stands out in the female department as one of the performers with a lame talent. But the creators don't really take advantage of her presence. In other words, don't expect anything like Salmas mind-blowing sequence in From Dusk till Dawn (1996). The striking Jane Krakowski is on hand, but her role is very small. Winsome Jessica Carlson plays Rebecca, a potential babe for the protagonist, I guess; she was only 15 during shooting and looks it.

THE FILM RUNS 1 hour, 49 minutes and was shot in Louisiana (New Orleans, Baton Rouge and Folsom) and Los Angeles with studio work done in Universal City.

8386270,4,B0030Y0I1Y,"If you don't know what to expect this film, think of it as Clive Barker's Nightbreed Lite - less budget on the make-up and fewer explicit scares or moments of weirdness, but definitely in that vein. I haven't read the actual books this was based on, but I've heard of them (from an old interview with ""Harry Potter"" star Daniel Radcliffe where he talks about being a fan of the novels). This review is therefore going to be from the perspective of someone who doesn't have the books to compare this to and is reviewing the movie on its own merits.

As for the film itself:

Our protagonist, misfit teen Darren Shan, ends up at our mysterious, eponymous circus freak show with his vampire-obsessed best friend, Steve. Little do they know vampires actually exist, and a couple of them are hiding in plain sight as performers at the Cirque. After uncovering the secret, Steve decides to become a vampire - and is recruited by the bizarre, Aleister Crowley-esque vampire ""afficianado"" Mr. Tiny - the trolling, cackling villain of our story - into becoming the ""bad"" kind of vampire: a murderous sub-species known as the ""Vampaneze"" (I'll leave how uncomfortably racist the similarity to the word ""Japanese"" feels aside). To right this wrong, Darren seeks out the circus vampire Mr. Crepsley in order to become a vampire's assistant and keep Mr. Tiny and the bad guy vampires - the Vampanese - from causing chaos.
Though this film is fun, there are some weak points: John C. Reilly, usually cast as a Fellini-esque freak in arthouse fare such as ""The Lobster"" and ""We Need to Talk About Kevin"", is under-utilized as the benign vampire Crepsley, in spite of his character having a central role in the plot. The stakes are never *quite* made believable with the comical, Joker-esque villain Mr. Tiny. The ultimately benevolent Mr. Tall is introduced as an outdated, racially charged ""yellow peril"" stereotype. Nothing is truly done to make us (or at least the adults in the audience) loathe the jerk-turned-victim teacher who obstructs and misunderstands our teen protagonists at every turn. One other issue with this film, speaking of which, is that it can't decide who it's for: the movie is based on a YA novel and contains many tropes of a film for a young adult audience, yet contains swearing (including some gritty sexual references) and a very dark and nasty off-screen murder that seem better tailored toward adults.

Over all, however, this film is good fun, in that genre of morbid dark fantasy that comes close to Tim Burton and could easily be confused for one of his movies until you put your glasses on. The plot and themes themselves are reminiscent of a lighter and softer version of adult horror/dark fantasy fare such as Clive Barker's Nightbreed, with a similar mix of dark quirkiness, dry humor, freak show aesthetics, and strangely inspiring themes of acceptance buried beneath the stylized weird worldbuilding.",1524960000,,2926,4.895161290322581
