7919945,5,B00004CJPW,I was at that show at Perkins Palace in Pasadena. It was totally awesome show. Phil really sang with the most heart. I wish he would release it on DVD.... Cheers to you Plil !!!!!#,1481760000,,180,4.171428571428572
7919946,5,B00004CJPW,"Before he hit the stratosphere with No Jacket Required, Phil was working hard to get noticed and this concert shows it. I wish this was published on DVD, but it was worth the trouble of transferring it to CD and mp3. This was the period when Phil's voice was the most soulful and he sang from the deepest pit in his gut. This concert features the most satisfying versions of I Don't Care Anymore, The West Side and In The Air Tonight you will ever find. Phil has even gone on record as naming the Pearl drum kit he toured with as being his ultimate kit. To top it off, he closes the show with a quiet cover of People Get Ready and stops you in your tracks - just beautiful.",1374537600,,673,4.145038167938932
7919947,5,B00004CJPW,"Speaking as a Phil fan (for 22 years and counting), I have got to say this is a very good show. If you're a new found fan, buy his latest DVD ""Finally, the first farewell tour-2006"" & this one. There's a bit of difference in the shows. The new
one has somewhat more of a stage production. Very very well established as a solo artist, producer, songwriter, drummer & percussionist. Highly recommended. But THIS one, ""Live at Perkins Palace"", is more of a humbled concert (although Phil
is humble no matter what). Not quite as many band members with him on stage & the set list (choice of songs - in Layman's terms)is not that large because he's only had two solo albums at the point of this concert.
I highly recommend anyone reading this review purchase this tape. Half these tunes on here, Phil hardly performs live these days. Tunes such as: ""I cannot believe it's true"", ""Behind the Lines"", ""The roof is leaking"" & ""Thru these walls"" are pretty much never performed live in the 21st century. The younger Phil fans have never even heard of those tunes, much less heard them. The point is, this is a classic, great show. And, Phil was & IS an incredible & phenomenal DRUMMER. And he does some awesome drumming in this video. Buy it. Thanks for reading this.",1163462400,8,1258,4.521929824561403
