8209955,5,B000TKRIVK,"I thought that all of the information in this 2 disc set was amazing! Not only was there a lot of information and things that I hadn't heard about before, but I really enjoyed the diversity of guests that included well-known authors and Ufologists, as well as UFO witnesses, a college professor and others. Together, this set represents an education on what you are NOT being told on all those cable Tv shows about aliens and UFOs.",1242604800,,431,4.6103896103896105
8209956,1,B000TKRIVK,"Old news...old local cable access shows from more than a decade ago, copied onto DVD. Production values low. Information very old. Unless you are completely ignorant on the subject, I would forget it...save your money. Update: please note only other reviewer is a certain C. Knell who gives it five stars. Bill Knell produced this DVD. Could C. Knell be related? I find five stars for this poorly produced, very old vhs transfer very suspicious.",1213747200,,445,4.946666666666666
