3723423,2,B001NVV7G6,I don't care much for Spagetti westerns and this was ok. not great.  It was tolerable to watch but I wouldn't order it again,1331856000,,124,4.166666666666667
3723424,2,B001NVV7G6,"I took a chance on this set, buying it used, at a really low price, through an Amazon Marketplace reseller. A few of the movies are old classics, and were OK. Most are suffering from poor image quality and sloppy, unprofessional transfer to DVD. There are sound problems, ranging from very weak to loud and crackly (from over driving the audio input while recording to DVD). Many of the movies are outright ridiculous, being too lousy to classify as a B or a C film to begin with, let alone with the image and sound quality problems. I watched the set once, then gave it away. If I hadn't found someone to take it, I'd have tossed it into the trash. Believe me, you DO get what you pay for with this set.",1319587200,36,704,4.3007518796992485
3723425,5,B001NVV7G6,"Sometimes I put one of these DVD's into my player and watch westerns all night long. I never get tired of watching them. Heck I can even do my own reruns better than Cable or Satellite's can do. Thanks for the great selections Amazon, and I already have more set up on my wishlist and will order along. I like everyone of the actors that I have checked below, I think they are all great. One of my all time favorite actors is Audie Murphy, he has always been an idol to me and I feel that he is one of the greatest Heroes that ever lived and I have gotten some of his movies from Amazon. I must have a collection of about 20 to 30 of his movies.",1298851200,4,645,3.9692307692307693
3723426,5,B001NVV7G6,"20 indeed GREAT westerns. Men were men. No need for heavy artillery in a fight. It was ok and expected that you did not bring a gun to a fist fight and if the gun fight turned into a knife fight the participants obliged each other. Can we please go back? The bandits were much better gentleman and proved worthy opponents more so than our ""heores"" of today.",1296086400,,357,4.264705882352941
3723427,4,B001NVV7G6,"After searching for episodes of an old TV favorite ""Bearcats,"" I found the pilot movie ""Powderkeg"" on this compilation and figured for the price, i couldn't go wrong.  That old TV movie with Rod Taylor (a pleasant trip down memory lane) looked fine, what you would hope for in this budget DVD offering, while others, such as ""Boot Hill,"" are as rough a version as there is.  Still, i found a few pleasant surpises such as To the Last Man (1933) - BusterCrabbe/Barton MacLane/Fuzzy Knight; an obscure low-budget Paramount release that takes the unique path of introducing each new character with their characters name and the actor playing them keyed over the lower half of the frame.  The old Hollywood westerns on this look fine, the Italian westerns, less so.  Still, no complaints.  i got what i paid for and am a contented western fan.",1265328000,13,839,4.758620689655173
3723428,4,B001NVV7G6,"The four DVDs of 20 GREAT WESTERNS: HEROES & BANDITS (issued: 12/08) offer an interesting mix of public domainers. Most here enjoy wide circulation, but the few good-quality rarer titles and a low price make ths set worthwhile.

NOTES:
Star of ""Cry Blood Apache"" is JODY McCrea. Joel appears briefly as son Jody's character in old age.
""To the Last Man"" is NOT the 1941 film better known as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THEY-DIED-WITH-THEIR-BOOTS-ON/dp/B0007OY2OY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THEY DIED WITH THEIR BOOTS ON</a>,  but a lesser '30s programmer.
Correct spelling of the excellent TV movie is a single word: POWDERKEG.
Euro-western ""Chino"" reunites director John Sturges and Charles Bronson, both celebrated for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-MAGNIFICENT-SEVEN/dp/B000059TFW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN </a>&nbsp;(1960).
Mickey Rooney is credible in a straight western in ""My Outlaw Brother"" as younger sibling of 'El Tigre,' Robert Stack.
""The Desperate Misson,"" a most-excellent made-for TVer, was directed by Ralph Bellamy (FDR in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/SUNRISE-AT-CAMPOBELLO/dp/B002BFCMNA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">SUNRISE AT CAMPOBELLO</a>).
Shot-in-Israel oater ""Kid Vengeance"" includes a role for Jesus of Nazareth.
In the cast of ""The Sundowners"": John Drew Barrymore, son of John and father of Drew.
Bill Shatner plays twin halfbreed brothers in ""White Comanche."" The peaceable one lives among whites, the other wars upon Euro-settlers.
