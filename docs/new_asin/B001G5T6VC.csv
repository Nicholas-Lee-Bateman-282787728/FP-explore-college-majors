3596106,5,B001G5T6VC,"Loved this movie!  I recommend it to anyone thinking of parting with their money to pursue the dream of owning their own business - any one of the many mlm opportunities.  I did sign on with several but usually to get the starter kit items at a great price - the minimum required additional 'sales' were always beyond my needs.

This movie introduces the viewer to the people 'caught' up in the dream, and the people who know better that 'the dream' - but keep pushing (using) everyone they know to share the opportunity.",1366329600,4,521,4.5212765957446805
3596107,2,B001G5T6VC,"Believe while attempting to depict the Network Marketing profession or MLM (multi level marketing sysem) fell short of the mark.  Although there were  accuracies that after being spoofed made the profession ""look bad,"" the real essence of those accuracies could have been addressed to balance the message in a humorous way to show that they were more inaccurate than accurate.",1358121600,2,376,5.25
3596108,3,B001G5T6VC,"In this story, Adam Pendon is laid off with no job prospects and a baby due any day now. He encounters Mark, who encourages him to get involved in ""Believe""--a network marketing company. Despite minimal effort on their part, Adam and his wife begin to make a lot of money and are named True Believers in the company after only three months. This rubs Mark, who has been invested in the company for 3 years but has yet to see a dime, the wrong way.

Adam's experience is the main storyline in this mockumentary, but three other couples' experiences are also followed through faux interviews. Overall, it's a good movie and does have some very funny moments. But, for me, it was also a tad depressing due to the fact that so many real-life people get sucked into these stupid pyramid schemes and lose money and relationships as a result. So, I found it a little bit sad for that reason. Still, for sheer entertainment value, it is worth seeing at least once.",1321228800,,956,4.526011560693641
3596109,5,B001G5T6VC,"This was a good funny family film. If you have ever been involved with a multilevel marketing scheme, or been bothered (harassed) by family members or friends involved in the latest and greatest multilevel scheme you will love this movie. I about died laughing during the movie. This movie is a mocumentary style movie like ""Best in Show"" and ""Waiting for Guffman"". I recommend watching this.",1280534400,,392,4.954545454545454

3596171,3,B001G5T6VC,Obviously meant to be a cheese ball movie so the acting isn't great. But overall it was pretty funny how accurately they portray the MLM market.,1447113600,,144,4.576923076923077

3596177,1,B001G5T6VC,"This movie was so confusing!  I didn't understand the purpose.  The message to believe. ..I thought it was going to be about believing in Jesus and His gospel,  but it was lost in the pyramid scan!  I would never recommend this movie nor ever but it!  I don't like giving this kind of review,  but itwould be unfair to say anything less than this.  Sara",1428537600,,353,4.338461538461538

3596210,5,B001G5T6VC,"This is eerily EXACTLY how Amway (aka Quixtar) runs their business.  They hide everything through marginal legality and making sure they abide as far from the letter of the law, without quite stepping over and breaking it.  Business ethics is not a pre-requisite to entering this ""business"" but then again, if you are ethical, then you would end up precluded from such a failed venture in the first place.  The level of cult brainwashing in these schemes is a lot more serious than what is portrayed.  To a third-person, most Amway reps are pretty much as confused, lost, and desperate as you see them caricatured in this movie.",1425945600,,628,4.787037037037037
3596211,4,B001G5T6VC,Good humor and nice balance between poking fun at multi level marketers and having compassion for those who get caught up in it.  We got some good laughs out of it.,1420243200,,164,4.290322580645161

3596213,5,B001G5T6VC,"By law, MLMs are required to disclose their distributor earnings. A math savvy look at them shows you that only a very tiny percentage make money, and usually far under 1% make nor than you'd earn with a full time $10/hr job. The thing is, the industry requires those at the bottom to invest and fail for those at the top to profit.

This film shows how this affects those climbing the ladder and the people they climb over. The real money in any mlm in generated by creating a huge down line. The down line will have people come and go who lose lots money investing in the product and inventory.

This film covers this, and it shows the techniques the industry employs, such as using celebrities wild success stories and greed. It also covers one very successful man who used his former coworkers to make his money and another bent on revenge after losing everything.

Very fun!",1411862400,2,879,4.515723270440252
3596214,5,B001G5T6VC,The movie makes fun of the Network Marketing industry and especially one of the oldest company in the industry.,1407024000,,111,4.894736842105263
3596215,1,B001G5T6VC,Could not get past the first few minutes watching such shallow people who were focused upon obtaining money through some kind of positive thinking scheme.,1391385600,4,154,5.2
3596216,4,B001G5T6VC,"If you've been in network marketing for any length of time, this movie pokes fun at just about any kooky character you'll ever see or meet in the business.

It should almost be required viewing for reps in every company so they'll know how ridiculous they likely being.

The absurdities and silliness rampant in Believe have much foundation in actuality.

Much fun. Lotsa laughs.",1389139200,2,379,4.890625
3596217,1,B001G5T6VC,"The movie was pretty funny. I have been in mlm for years, and have been successful at it (debt free, helping family, etc) I do think it is kinda cheesy that someone who failed at the business would make a movie mocking it. If he was successful at it, would he still have made the movie?? Hhmmm",1375315200,,293,4.157894736842105
3596218,5,B001G5T6VC,"I've known people who got suckered into MLM stuff, and I've had a chance to see the ""make money online"" gurus up close (they're not MLM but there are a lot of parallels). This mockumentary is absolutely hysterical, but it's also shockingly accurate. They do a great job of capturing the newbie enthusiasm, the lack of substance, and the generally icky feeling that goes along with the network marketing world.

I mostly watched this movie because I noticed that Graham Russell of Air Supply (and his wife) were in the movie. I was pleasantly surprised to find that this was one of the funniest, most under-rated films I've ever come across. If you've ever ""lost"" a family member to MLM, independent sales rep companies, the shadier side of internet marketing, etc. you will recognize a lot of what goes on in this movie. I highly recommend it.",1373846400,6,843,4.73469387755102

Clever and original, Believe skewers the crazy, cult-like world of Multi level Marketing companies such as Amway and Herbalife.

8303973,5,B001G5T6VC,"This was about a multi level marketing. But instead of being a documentary it was a mockumentary.
This has 'interviews' with people who have been in the program for a while and you can hear their bitterness as Adam Pendom rises to fame and riches. As he goes along for the ride he is taken on by the upper level of the MLM he learns what lies behind the scenes. There are lies and crazyness. The voice of reason, Adam's wife, is what helps him see how crazy it all is.... the marketing, the premise of selling to his friends something they don't need and so on.

I laughed but I think if you have ever been in one of these MLM businesses or know someone who is; this might hit a bit close to home.",1501632000,,697,4.125
