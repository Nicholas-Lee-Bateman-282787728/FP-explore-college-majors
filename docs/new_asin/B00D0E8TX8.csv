8592151,5,B00D0E8TX8,"This is part of my Alice in Wonderland collection.
I just love their idea of how they presented Betty putting together a puzzle of Wonderland and its characters.  When she puts the White Rabbit in the puzzle, he gets up, runs away, and Betty follows him.  A delightful cartoon.  Excellent for both Betty Boop fans and fans of Alice in Wonderland!",1397347200,,346,4.639344262295082
