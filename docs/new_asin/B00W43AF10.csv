7120086,5,B00W43AF10,"I got my first exposure to the fairly new ""Disneynature"" series last year with ""Bears"", and this one proved to be just as good.  I love the style in which they're done.  The photography is excellent, and the teams work really hard trying to capture spontaneous moments in these animals' lives.  The degree to which these Disneynature narratives are concocted or real is debatable, but regardless of that, they have authenticity in how they capture the essence of other creatures.  Disneynature approaches its documentaries like the creatures are a work of art which allows you to interpret your own self as well as admire external beauty.  All good art directs a person outward and inward.  Disneynature is great at finding a theme which has universal human appeal.  In ""Monkey Kingdom"", the toque macaque monkey kingdom in Sri Lanka is a lot like a human clan or tribe with arbitrary power and little worth for the bottom rung of society.  Our heroine in this, Maya, is treated poorly by her monkey superiors, but earns some respect from them by the end when she is able to navigate the wild better than the leaders of the monkey clan.  The flavor of the film is both serious and funny, just like real life.  The writing is so clever, filled with humor and deeply insightful statements which relate the monkeys' story to our human story.  My personal opinion is that without the clever writing, lively narration by Tina Fey, relevant theme (innate dignity being stronger than the bullies in authority over you), and awesome cinematography, ALL WORKING TOGETHER, it wouldn't be a great experience.  Because of the packaging of these essential elements, I love this documentary, and not even the somewhat creepy look of the monkeys diminished my delight.  (When their eyes look at the camera, they look kind of scary like aliens from outer space, and they look like deformed humans when they grin or when they are newborns.  But as you get to know our heroine on this, you fall in love with at least the nice monkeys in spite of their appearance!)  I wonder how the film team could legally get away with sneaking into someone's vacant house in Sri Lanka and filming the monkeys ransacking its kitchen?  Or was it staged?",1431388800,6,2219,4.784776902887139
7120087,5,B00W43AF10,"I know that I will be getting a quality film even though I haven't even seen it yet
All these Disney films that come out on Earth Day are money well spent
If you are an animal lover you will love any of these videos",1431043200,,215,3.8
7120088,5,B00W43AF10,"Disneynature presents a true-life G-rated documentary that follows a female monkey (actually a toque macaque) and her newborn baby as they struggle to survive in ancient ruins found deep in the jungles of Sri Lanka. This is the perfect opportunity for a child to see how the ""pecking order"" works in the animal world. From that, eventually they will see how it applies to humans, not only on the playground, but in the grown-up world as well.

We start with an inspiring report on the many contributions the eight Disneynature features have made throughout the world; a percentage of the money from ticket sales is earmarked for ecological and environmental concerns. They have, so far, contributed millions of dollars to various causes. After that report, we switch to ""The Monkees,"" a late '60s pop group which accompanies the title sequence. Other artists will follow....

Warmly narrated by Tina Fey, we watch:
  * Maya, along with her newborn son Kip, as she maneuvers her way from a low ranking semi-outcast, to become the mate of an alpha male which allows her to eat fruit from the top branches of the tree.
  * Raja, the alpha male of the tribe, is catered to and groomed by an adoring entourage. (A macaque's hair is right out of The Three Stooges!)
  * The Sisterhood is comprised of three sisters who, along with their offspring, enjoy the benefits of Raja's status.
  * Kumar is the macho newcomer who wants to challenge Raja.
  * Lex is the horribly disfigured villain of the piece. He's the leader of the tribe of challengers who attack and drive our friends from their home.

We giggle at the scenes in the springtime when all the creatures become ""twitterpated"" (it IS Disney) and the shots of Maya swimming underwater with Kip clinging to her are astounding. The mama sloth bear toting her cubs on her back (riding ""bear-back?) is fun and the leopard leaping up into the tree after the monkeys is chilling. We enjoy watching the youngsters tease the mongoose and the squirrels, the landscapes are breathtaking and the cinematography is the best.

Stay for the closing credits because then you will meet the production crew, hear of their challenges and discover how long it took them to make this marvelous production. You'll be astonished!",1429747200,5,2258,4.8311688311688314

7120090,3,B00W43AF10,"In 2007, the Walt Disney Company established Disneynature - a direct descendant of the classic and Academy Award winning nature series of the 1950s and 1960s: True-Life Adventures. Following closely in those footsteps, Monkey Kingdom (2015, Mark Linfield & Alistair Fothergill) follows a family or troop of macaques throughout the seasons in an ancient abandoned city in Sri Lanka. The documentary contains a substantial amount of indirect human-animal interaction; something noticeably absent in previous Disneynature documentaries. It almost seemed as if the macaques could not make ends meet without their good-natured stealing from the human world. Using human familial and dynastic traits and placing them upon animals is nothing new and for the viewer not familiar with the Disneynature style the narrative may prove simplistic at first, but it works as the documentary moves on. Tina Fey can add narration to her long list of talents; her role here is playful in tone and at the same time reassuring and honest (kind of like a mom). The kids seems to love it and be prepared for flying questions before, during, and after the feature.",1429315200,,1141,5.206521739130435

7120116,5,B00W43AF10,"A solid entry in the Disney Nature series. The picture is just amazing. The narration style is so so, too corny and clearly targeted for children. I liked the ""African Cats""'s narration more.

The storyline might also be forced/concocted but the way they focus on the life of a group of characters is definitely a pro for this (and other) Disney Nature documentaries. They focus in depth on some individuals instead of spanning among too many topics/animals without focus. It is more rewarding and memorable and it is clear that the crew had to work hard to get this done.

Some people bash on these documentaries, and while it's true that some aspects could be improved it's a trade off between simplicity and other factors, as they are targeting children and families to watch this. The work done by the crew is amazing and they are worth watching.",1452297600,,850,4.736486486486487

7120147,5,B00W43AF10,"My daughter loves monkeys. Ever since she found a stuffed monkey at a garage sale and basically walked away with it, she was hooked, so I knew that it was only a matter of time until we saw this movie as a family, and now I can say that we own it!

We have loved watching Disney Nature films in the past and are always so impressed by the care that they take and the unprecedented access that they get when it comes to the animals that they follow. This was the case in this film too.

We were continually amazed at how well the movie captured the world within the Monkey Kingdom and the narration really helped to explain what we were seeing and emotionally ties us to the story and what Maya was trying to do to keep Kip alive. You end up rooting for her the entire way through!

One of the other monkeys that my girls loved in this was Grandpa, I mean, what a character!

This was a very well made movie that truly transports you into the world of the Monkey Kingdom. You and your family will love it!

7120148,5,B00W43AF10,"First of all, thanks very very much to the producers for opening the film with ""Hey, Hey, We're The Monkees!"" This was a new recording performed by the great Micky Dolenz himself. It sets the mood perfectly, as this is going be a film with wit, warmth and humor as much as it is a story of the harsh facts of life. This Blu-ray/Dvd makes a great companion piece to Disneynature's unforgettable CHIMPANZEE.

The choice of Tina Fey as narrator is brilliant. She conveys a maternal, yet witty sense that is serious when necessary but always ready with a quip. While it would be easy to assume that such funny lines as ""Bambi is not on the menu"" might have come from the talented writer/actor, and well they might have in part, but assuming so would be a slight to Mark Linfield's script. (For more fine Tina Fey voice acting, I recommend Miyazaki's PONYO.) Are comedy bits appropriate? Walt Disney's True-Life Adventures had plenty (like a scorpion square dance: ""Stinger up with the stingaree/but watch out that you don't sting me!"")

There is also a fine score and offscreen songs. I cannot overemphasize the quality of all the Disneynature films and how necessary they are to share with young people. There are simply no bad films in the bunch.

(I received a complimentary sample of this product for my honest and unbiased feedback.)",1442361600,,1334,4.716738197424893
7120149,4,B00W43AF10,"Summary: A nature documentary that follows a newborn monkey and its mother as they struggle to survive within the competitive social hierarchy of the monkey kingdom, a dynamic group of monkeys who live in ancient ruins found deep in the storied jungles of South Asia.

This is a great nature documentary to buy for your kids. They show you the playful and human side of this group of monkeys and it's all narrated by a female voice actor who has a warm and gentle voice. The documentary has a very story-telling feel to it that I'm sure your kids will love. Do be careful though, there are deaths in this documentary. It kind of surprised me at first that they would put that scene in this movie, but in the end it kind of made sense. It was done in a respectful way to show the viewers what it was like in the monkey kingdom. They cover all the basis and provided some great shots of the environment around them. Overall, very informative and children friendly documentary.
