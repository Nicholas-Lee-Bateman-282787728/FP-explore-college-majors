We bought all 3 seasons and would have a True Jackson ""marathon"" to reward ourselves when we would get a project done or her room picked up!  Love, love, LOVE this show!",1345507200,,274,4.150943396226415

Unfabulous, iCarly and Zoey 101 seem to be more aimed towards little kids than teens. I have yet to see another Nickelodeon Non-cartoons since 2003 up until this show have not been anywhere near on the same level as Salute Your Shorts, All That, Kenan & Kel or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Clarissa-Explains-It-All/dp/B0007Y08LK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Clarissa Explains It All</a>. And While I still do not consider this show on the same page as those, It's pretty close

Then in 2008 comes True Jackson, VP - a show about 15 year old True Jackson (KeKe Palmer), who is hired to be the Vice President (Hence the title) of youth apparel Mad Style - a fashion and clothing company, after The owner notices and like True's modifications to one of his designs she's wearing. Anyone who liked 90s Nickelodeon might like this show. It's a HUGE improvement over what Nick has given us since 2003",1255651200,7,1723,7.881443298969073

I love True Jackson VP and am sad they don't air it anymore. I will be buying the whole series when I can <3",1437523200,,274,3.981818181818182

8365470,1,B002DMJMD4,This was the second time getting this movie. The first time the disc's were loose in the case and scratched up. The second time the case was broken on inside and 1 if the disc's were scratched up but playable.  It was also delivered to my neighbor instead of me.,1423785600,,262,4.24
8365471,4,B002DMJMD4,"Some people may have had a different experience then me, but I ordered True Jackson VP Season 1, Volume 1. The discs were supposed to be in ""New"" condition, but it's hard to say if it actually was new or not. The order was fulfilled by Amazon, but it came from another seller. I could immediately tell that that the set had been repackaged and there was a sticker on it that said the name of the set and the word ""NEW"" on it. I still wasn't bothered by this, but the case had also been replaced as it's supposed to come in a clear case to be able to read the inner cover and instead it was in a typical black dvd case. Still not a big deal for me. I was even able to get passed the slash in the barcode. Some factories do that to their liquidated stock. What bothered me was that this set comes with two dvds and they were both shoved into a single disc case with one disc bumping around freely. I kept the set because I have plenty of empty double-disc cases around and just switched it out. I just wanted others to be aware that this is what some people are considering to be ""New"" condition. The dvds in the set are great though and well produced. I'm happy I got them, just not how I got them.",1374192000,2,1197,4.0548523206751055
8365472,4,B002DMJMD4,this show is surprisingly funny and this dvd set is great! It's just a shame it doesn't include more episodes.,1360195200,,110,4.55
