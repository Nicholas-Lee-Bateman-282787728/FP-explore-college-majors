4104351,4,B003AOB41M,"Invader Zim is a very funny series for kids that is also amusing for adults.  Highly recommended for families with off-beat senses of humor.  Check out the Christmas episode, which was the last one that aired.",1272758400,4,209,4.777777777777778

4104354,4,B003AOB41M,The series itself is funny and entertaining. The weird thing about this copy is that Amazon burned the episodes onto a regular disk. The menu is basic (no special features) and I found it difficult to skip through episodes.,1474761600,3,223,4.743589743589744

4104369,5,B003AOB41M,"This is a good show to kick back to and relax, or have it on for background noise. I'd seen them years ago, but had to wait quite some time for the price to come down. But Gur is definitely worth it to buy, and Gaz is always funny.",1400716800,2,231,3.7346938775510203
4104370,5,B003AOB41M,"This DVD has some of my favorite episodes on it. It is definitely worth the money.
I wish that season 1 were affordable, because some of my favorites are on it as well. (I will keep looking until it goes down in price.)",1395878400,,219,4.116279069767442
4104371,4,B003AOB41M,"I'm glad I could have the ""entire"" second season of Invader Zim, but it's a little small compared to the first, since the show was cancelled. It would have been better with some bonus material, at least. Plus, subtitles would have helped with Zim's random ranting.",1395446400,2,264,4.760869565217392

4104374,1,B003AOB41M,discs did not have anything on them and the disc said disc error on them.  I tried 3 different DVD players in the house. Will attempt to send them back for a replacement.  Hope I don't have the same problem as the first set.  Paid a lot of money for them.,1290470400,3,255,3.9607843137254903

4104376,1,B003AOB41M,"The show is great and highly reccomended. However, save yourself some headaches and buy another version. These discs seem to be hit or miss. Our had two DVD's in the set and the first one, with most of the episodes, doesn't play at all and is a complete mess. Luckily we could watch most of the two episodes on the second disc. Unfortunately since we didn't watch them within 30 days of ordering them they can't be returned or replaced. If you do decide to buy, make sure you open them immediately and have the time and money ready to exchange them until they send you DVD's that can actually play and aren't smudged and scratched up.",1276041600,10,634,4.427350427350428

With this DVD you'll get ALL the season 2 episodes including the ones that didn't air, which, admittedly, is still shorter than season 1. Very minimal DVD. Not even an animated menu or any bonus features. But the show's still great and this is a good deal.",1522022400,,318,4.406779661016949
