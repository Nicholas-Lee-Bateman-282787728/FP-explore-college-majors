1030797,4,6305461872,"If you're a Peter Jackson's DEAD ALIVE fan, you'll love Frank Henenlotter's BRAIN DAMAGE. 50 % horror, 50% comic : that's the secret. Add an above average screenplay (OK ! that's not the difficulty for an 1988  movie...) and a dozen actors who seem at least semi-professional and you  obtain a B-movie that deserves to stay in your library.
Brian's horrible  friend is a vague cousin of E.T. but a little bit more symbolical ; Frank  Henenlotter, during the commentary of BRAIN DAMAGE, doesn't deny that he  was thinking of the most valuable attribute of the male when designing  IT.
Remember the sci-fi novel of Brian Aldiss THE GREEN WORLD ? Well, the  animal sticking on the hero's head in this book is the grandfather of  Elmer. It loves you but you have to obey it, it will make you happy but you  have to feed him first.
A terrific transfer in the DVD standard, a  commentary of the director and the trailers of the movie and BASKET CASE as  bonus features. Wow!

1030887,4,6305461872,"Most people will not have a clue who I am talking about when I mention the name Frank Henenlotter. Yes, fans will know and horror geeks in particular. But the average movie viewer would be hard placed to name a single film he made. And yet hes made some of the most interesting and originally creative films in his career, one of which Im sure youve heard of but maybe never seen. It was a low budget flick called BASKETCASE. See? I told you youd known something he made.

With only 12 films listing him as director (two of those shorts) on imdb.com you will always find his films to be something different and interesting. If you don't believe me look what they are and then watch one. Which brings us to this film, released in 1988 six years after BASKETCASE.

BRAIN DAMAGE tells the story of a creature that does indeed damage but offers something in return. The film opens with an elderly couple frantically searching their house for what appears to be someone named Elmer. Unable to find him they collapse and we are left to worry about what happened to them.

The film moves to nearby neighbors Brian and Mike. Two young brothers getting by in New York, Brian has a girlfriend named Barbara who needs more attention which Mike would like to provide. The same night as the old couple were running around their apartment Mike gets sick and has Mike take Barbara where they had plans to go. It turns out Brian has is more ill than he realizes.

What we thought was Elmer actually turns out to be Aylmer, a parasitic creature that has attached itself to Brian. Whats been described as looking like a cross between a penis and a piece of fecal matter shaded blue is actually in intelligent creature that talks to Brian. Yes, this is not your standard sci-fi film. Aylmer tells Brian that he can provide something unique for him, an opening of the mind. To display this he inserts a needle like appendage from his body into the back of Brians neck, injecting his brain with a fluid that enhances his senses like nothing anyone ever thought possible.

On the downside is the fact that Aylmer must feed. Worse yet is that he feeds on human brains. So Brian is suddenly enlisted to aid Aylmer in finding the brains the he needs to survive. This presents us with the chance to witness gore filled carnage in several scenes. It also offers a problematic issue with Brian as his craving for the fluid Aylmer provides has him battling with his conscience as he is killing people to feed him. The odds of Aylmer eventually wanting Barbara or Mike is bound to happen.

Henenlotter has said that this film was based on Faustian themes, the concept of someone selling their soul to the devil in return for something they desire with an outcome that they could not predict would happen. There is that but at the same time the obvious concept of drug addiction in todays world is there as well with Brians constant need for the blue fluid injected into his brain and his willingness to do anything to get it. The two themes work hand in hand here and offer a story that most low budget horror films are lacking.

Some have called the effects terrible but I found them to be fantastic. Most cant recall a time when CGI creatures were not used in films and practical effects ruled the day. To have someone, in this case Gabriel Bartalos and his crew, come up not just with a new creature but to animate it and give it a personality on top of everything is wonderful. The rest of the effects are great as well, even more so when you consider this film came out in 1988.

Having developed a cult following since its initial poor release (due mainly because the company behind the film was sold and the new owners just wanted to get it out there), the movie has seen the light of day on home screens, first on VHS and then on DVD. But the new Arrow Video version is perhaps the best offering of this film weve ever had access to. As is always the case, Arrow has brought us the cleanest and most precise visually arresting version of the film ever offered, a digital transfer from original film elements. Extras here are also top notch and include a new audio commentary track with writer/director Henenlotter, new interviews with cast and crew, a Q&A with Henelotter at the 2016 Offscreen Film Festival, the original trailer, newly commissioned artwork for the sleeve, a collectors booklet with writing on the film by Michael Gingold and more. As with all of their releases Arrow is offering the most bang for your buck.

My son has met Henenlotter and found him to be an interesting man and friendly to fans who have supported his visions for years. Its nice to see his movies getting their long deserved due. The two sequels to BASKETCASE were just released last year on blu-ray from Synapse, both of which I wrote about. To see this added to the available list is something worth cheering. Fans will want this on their shelves and horror/sci-fi fans will want to give it a watch. Expect something different like you would with all films Henenlotter. One last tidbit, something fans howl over, is the brief cameo of the two brothers from the BASKETCASE film seen here, an added treat.",1500163200,,5169,4.531618435155413

1030890,5,6305461872,"Director Frank Henenlotter looks like a normal guy.  But don't let that fool you; housed inside that nondescript head is the mind of a genius.  How else can you describe someone who has given the horror genre films like BASKET CASE and (my personal favorite) FRANKENHOOKER?

Henenlotter definitely reaches new heights with BRAIN DAMAGE, though.

While the premise of BRAIN DAMAGE might sound familiar, I can guarantee youve not seen anything like this.  Whereas many films rehash what has already been done, this movie will take you on a vivid and entertaining trip.  And when its over, you might have to ask yourself if it was all a dream.

BRAIN DAMAGE is the latest offering from Arrow Video, and its a definite must-have for horror fans.  Chances are youve heard of this film; but if you havent, then buckle in and get ready for a weird and crazy ride.

I went into this film knowing very little about it.  Sure, Id heard about it over the years, and I even own a rare DVD copy of it.  But I purposely ignored conversations about it and kept myself from learning too much about the plot.  As such, I think I enjoyed the film even more so.

BRAIN DAMAGE is shot well and looks great onscreen.  The HD transfer is solid, although there are a couple of scenes where a vertical line can be seen on the left-hand side of the screen.  This isn't very distracting, however, and I assume it has something to do with the original negative.  I do have to complain about the sound, though.  Most of the voices are very quiet for some reason, which made me keep adjusting the volume based on the action onscreen.  A minor annoyance, but I feel it worth mentioning.

The acting is very good, with Rick Hearst playing the main character, Brian.  Hearst does a great job, and he convincingly portrays an addict with ease.  John Zacherley offers the voice to Elmer, and he also does a fine job.

The special effects in BRAIN DAMAGE are outrageous, over the top, and excellent.  Theres a lot gore, and it looks great.  I particularly like the brain-pulling sequence, where Brian is slowly pulling his brain out of his ear.  This is extremely well done and looks brutally realistic.

BRAIN DAMAGE is a quirky and fun film, but it won't be for everyone.  Its a slow-burning horror comedy that emphasizes the grotesque, but it also offers an interesting perspective on addiction.  I highly recommend it to horror fans, particularly those who enjoyed BASKET CASE and FRANKENHOOKER.",1495411200,,2464,4.654292343387471

1030893,4,6305461872,"Despite the lurid titles and campy artwork adorning VHS classics like Basket Case and Frankenhooker, the films of Frank Henenlotter were always a cut above the usual home video cash-ins.  There was obvious affection for the genre, of course, but matched with an ambition to do something more than compete with the typical slashers and creature features.  Henelotter's work had wit and panache (at least as much as he could afford) along with the practical gore effects '80s fans demanded.  Brain Damage (1988) is all that and more, unraveling like a hallucinatory blend of David Cronenberg and Jim Henson as it introduces the world to Elmer, a brain-eating parasite who provides his host with a heroine-like ""juice"" in exchange for a regular supply of his favorite food.

The film opens with an elderly couple frantically searching their New York apartment for (what we assume to be) their missing pet.  But when they wind up on the floor foaming at the mouth from withdrawal symptoms, it's clear all is not as it seems.  Indeed, Elmer has found a new home...on the back of someone else's neck.

Brian (Rick Hearst) is an average guy.  But his life quickly spirals out of the control once Elmer (voiced by horror host John Zacherley) has him hooked on the drug injected directly into his brain.  Euphoric, Brian ditches his family and girlfriend to do Elmer's bidding, which involves luring unsuspecting victims to a gruesome death.  Once Rick figures out he's responsible for a string of murders, he tries to go cold turkey.  But as Elmer's previous owners can attest, getting that parasite off your back is easier said than done.

Henelotter doesn't play coy with his metaphorical intentions.  As a commentary on the perils of addiction, Brain Damage is just as powerful as those egg-frying commercials of the day.  Only this time the message is delivered by a turd-sized talking phallus brought to life with rudimentary, but still convincing, animatronics.  If you're still on board after that synopsis, then the film offers a series of show stopping practical effects (cranial chomping, medulla yanking and one sickening simulation of deadly oral sex) fit for a double-spread in Fangoria.  The acting, as with most Henelotter films, is amateurishly endearing.  It's the ideas that get most of the attention.

This time around, the opening scenes of Brain Damage are the most interesting.  The longer Henenlotter withholds information, the more we want to know.  And when Elmer's back-story is finally spelled out in a fascinating mid-film soliloquy, there's enough potential for a prequel about this all-powerful organism that's been passed down throughout history!  Unfortunately, Brian holds less interest.  His physical and mental decline make for a rather depressing character arc, interrupted by moments of Muppet-like levity.  Brain Damage can't help but feel like it's under the influence of its serious subject matter, culminating in a bummer ending that leaves the audience suffering some withdrawal of their own.

Arrow Video's Blu-ray / DVD combo is a whopper of a special edition, starting with a sweet-looking hi-def transfer packaged with new artwork and a collector's booklet illustrated with still and posters.  The extras are a bit effects heavy, including the brand-new documentary Listen To The Light:  The Making of Brain Damage, which focuses on the crew recruited by Henelotter to bring Elmer to life.  There's even more detail to come from featurettes Animating Elmer and The Effects of Brain Damage.  Henelotter himself provides a more general production overview in his audio commentary.  But there's also a good amount of crew reflection and fan adulation to go with the usual image galleries and theatrical trailers.  The synth heavy score is given an isolated track as well.",1494892800,,3806,5.151465798045603

1030946,3,6305461872,"Brain Damage,"" directed by Frank Henenlotter (Basket Case), is a bizarre film about a symbiotic relationship. Young Manhattanite Brian (Rick Herbst) becomes addicted to a peculiar psychedelic drug given to him by a slug-like creature that leads to highs and lows.

The monster, which feeds on human brains, escapes from the apartment of an elderly European couple (Lucille Saint-Peter, Theo Barnes). The oddball couple have named their talking pet monster Aylmer (voice of horror host Zacherley). Aylmer escapes because they feed him animal brains and he craves the real thing  human brains.

Aylmer makes his way into Brians neighboring apartment, grasps his neck, and injects him with a substance that causes Brian to see everything as beautiful. Brian likes the feeling and is soon hooked. The downside is that the drug causes mood swings that turn the young mans life into turmoil. Aylmer eventually becomes abusive, knowing Brian cant survive without him.

As in Basket Case, Henenlotter makes a special effects creation a major character. The effects are strictly low budget, but thats part of the appeal of this audacious film. As a horror film, its more comedic than scary, and comes off more as a cautionary tale about the pitfalls of addiction, though it never comes across as didactic. For fans of cult movies, Brain Damage will offer some jaw-dropping moments.

Bonus extras on the 2-disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo Pack include audio commentary by writer/director Frank Henenlotter; the documentary Listen to the Light: The Making of Brain Damage; interview with actor Rick Herbst; a look at the special effects work of Gabe Bartalos; a feature illustrating the contributions of visual effects supervisor Al Magliochetti;  overview of the New York City locations used in the film; interview with superfan Adam Skinner; Q & A with Frank Henenlotter; Bygone Behemoth, an animated short featuring a brief appearance by John Zacherle in his final onscreen role; reversible sleeve featuring original and newly commissioned artwork; and a collectors booklet containing new writing on the film, original archive stills and posters.",1494201600,,2128,5.318452380952381

1031224,5,6305461872,"Well, I have to admit that after I saw the sick BASKET CASE, I wondered what other movies Frank Henenlotter had made besides the BASKET CASE series. I found this sick, twisted film a few years ago and ordered the special edition DVD and finally got it days later. Nervous, I wondered how this film would stand up against BASKET CASE and how good it would be...and to my surprise, I was not at all disappointed.

BRAIN DAMAGE is a freakish tale of a young man named Brian (Rick Herbst), who happens to be the next to fall victim to a worm-like parasite named Alymer (voiced in Bing Crosby-type fashion by the hilariously over-the-top John Zacherle). We learn in the first frame of the film about Alymer (he prefers 'Elmer') and his past family, and how they have tried to wean him on sheep's brains. Well, Alymer is just plain sick of that, and he wants real human brains, so he gets in touch with Brian, showing up at his place. He explains his situation to Brian, and tells him if he gets him brains, he will inject him with a fluid drug that gives him the ultimate pleasurable feeling. Brian reluctantly agrees, and so now he and Alymer become ""attached"" to some degree. They go on a killing spree, knocking off people by cornering them in less-crowded places. The best scene involves a little sexual ""job"" that you will laugh your head off to, but it's also kind of sick in a twisted way. The trouble with Alymer and Brian's relationship is that it's interfering with Brian's relationship with his girlfriend Barbara (Jennifer Lowry, cute and competent in  her role). This creates real tension between Brian and Alymer, leading the ultimate showdown for control of Brian's mind. The ending wasn't as strong as it could have been, it was more weird and strange than satisfying, but the movie itself is a hoot and there are some decent chills throughout the movie. This is a comedy horror film, and you too will feel the same about it.

Without comparison to Henenlotter's twisted debut feature, BRAIN DAMAGE stands on its own as a own as a bizarre cult flick. While certainly not as successful as BASKET CASE, it's as much in touch with the strangely creepy and bizarre as the aforementioned film. Ever wonder what would happen if you had to help a parasite get brains and would fall victim to its addictive psycho-drug? Look no further!",1131753600,5,2339,4.617788461538462

1031226,4,6305461872,"1988's BRAIN DAMAGE is the second film from low-budget Grand Guignol writer/director Frank Henenlotter, his first being the grisly over-the-top cult favorite BASKET CASE (1982), and both films established him as the master auteur of bad-taste horror cinema in the 1980s.  But despite the excessive gore and crude sexual elements, Henenlotter's films are a cut above the average trash pics because his well-written scripts are weaved around a daedal subtext that offers wry comments and observations on certain elements or aspects of modern society.  With the visceral horror comedy BRAIN DAMAGE, Henenlotter is satirizing the Western propensity for addiction.

BRAIN DAMAGE relates the ""mind-blowing"" tale of the Faustian bargain made between a young man named Brian and an enigmatic, snake-like parasite named Aylmer (pronounced like the name ELMER).  Aylmer dispenses an addictive pleasure-inducing drug directly into Brian's brain, but as payment for each ""fix,"" Brian must transport Aylmer around the city so the parasitic pusher can obtain his favorite food--human brains.  Though Brian is generally a nice young man who wouldn't hurt a flea, he finds it impossible to resist the demands of the deceptively cute parasite because of his need and desire for the psychedelic ""juice,"" and he ultimately becomes Aylmer's accomplice in murder.

With a meager budget of circa $600,000, Henenlotter and crew have nonetheless succeeded in crafting BRAIN DAMAGE as a polished, professional-looking film.  Yes, the violence is graphic, sophomorically comic, and often over the top, and yes, the film has a crude, puerile sexual element (snake-like Aylmer is obviously a phallic symbol). But these elements actually enhance the film's earnest anti-addiction subtext, as they vociferously underscore the negative effect that addiction has on an addict's personality, his personal life, and the lives of others with whom he has contact.

The acting in the film is rather a mixed bag.  As Brian, future soap-opera regular Rick Hearst--then billed under his birth surname of Herbst--does a great job of portraying a boy-next-door type whose life is spiraling out of control due to his addiction.  And in an uncredited role, actor John Zacherle--better known to some horror fans as Zacherley, the Cool Ghoul host of New York TV's SHOCK! THEATER--does an outstanding job voicing the smarmy Aylmer.  Gordon MacDonald plays Brain's brother, Mike, and Jennifer Lowry his girlfriend, Barbara, and both do an adequate job.  Most of the other performances are a bit wooden, but they don't detract too much from the film's overall production quality.

Being a Juvenalian satire of sorts, the often biting humor in BRAIN DAMAGE is dark, off-color & often bawdy, and outrageously offbeat.  Much of little Aylmer's dialogue is sarcastically witty, and in one eerie but funny scene, Brian lies writhing on the floor hurting for a ""fix"" while Elmer sits by and jovially belts out the Glenn Miller standard ""Elmer's Tune.""  Also, in a hilarious homage to Henenlotter's previous film, BASKET CASE, the star of that film, Kevin VanHentenryck, gets on the subway with a familiar wicker basket in hand and takes the seat opposite Brian.

The Special Edition ""Limited Availability"" DVD from Synapse presents a high-definition transfer of BRAIN DAMAGE in its original 1.85:1 aspect ratio, and the transfer appears vibrant, clean, and relatively free of digital artifacts.  This is the unrated restored version, so all of the gore and innuendo that was cut for the U.S. theatrical release has been put back where it belongs.  There are also some cool extras, including a very witty feature commentary featuring writer/director Henenlotter, former FANGORIA editor Robert Martin, and filmmaker Scooter McCrae (who has worked with Henenlotter).  Also included is the theatrical trailer (in 1.85:1 aspect ratio), a ""hidden"" trailer for BASKET CASE, and an isolated-musical-score audio option.

To sum up, BRAIN DAMAGE is a movie with a somber subtext, but writer/director Frank Henenlotter doesn't let that get in the way of all the cheesy fun.  Sure, the anti-addiction allegory can't be missed, but Henenlotter also knows that the monkey on his antihero's back is an ideal springboard for lots of offbeat and bawdy gallows humor, and he milks it for all it's worth.  Admittedly, BRAIN DAMAGE will not appeal to every viewer's tastes, but those seeking a Family Film or a Chick Flick probably shouldn't be perusing the listings for the horror DVDs anyway.",1080518400,33,4519,5.3263009845288325

This film drops us right in the middle of some weirdness.  Feeling a bit under the weather, Brian (Rick Hearst; Warlock III) awakens to find a sort of brain monster parasite attached to his spine.  And this little brain snake has an anthropomorphous face and a name: Elmer (Aylmer).  Elmer injects Brian with some intoxicating blue liquid which brings about a euphoric state.  However, in exchange for additional treatments, Elmer demands access to victims so he may feed (on their brains)clearly an unsubtle social commentary on the desperate behavior behind drug addiction.  The dialogue and presentation are quite blatant, often depicted as a man (Brian) having a sober conversation with the very personification of his addiction.

Brian begins to act all sorts of weird.  He prefers seclusion, distances himself from his girlfriend, puts locks on the bedroom and bathroom doors, and seems to care about little more than his next dose from Elmer.  He doesnt even remember some of the things his done to earn his next fix.

Writer and director Frank Henenlotter (Frankenhooker, Basket Case 1-3) tends to produce a mix of stylized dark slapstick humor, very gory low budget effects, heavy allegory, and perverse sexualized themes.  Being no exception, this film parallels sexual acts in its horror (e.g., the alley scene behind the bar in which Elmer assumes an analogous role to oral sex).  But despite the disturbing themes, this is a dark horror comedy complete with a musical number and it does not rely on smut (theres very limited nudity).

Elmer appears to be a mix of puppeteer work and stop-motion, hes sufficiently slimy, his face looks kind of cute yet evil, and they have a lot of fun with his ever-widening mouth when administering Brians fix.  We also see plenty of him, even (in one scene) in the form of cartoon animation!

Although the effects are cheap, they're highly effective in this B-movie.  When the scenes merit gore, its gooey and chunky and exactly what you were hoping for given the silly movie posters.  Some highlights include the brain-eating sex scene, the deliciously gory withdrawal scene (yanking a brain through an ear) and the mouth-to-mouth kiss death scene.  When Elmer attacks its hilariousakin to the larvae in The Deadly Spawn (1983).

Voiced by John Zacherle (Frankenhooker), Elmer/Aylmer sounds surprisingly like Jeffery Combs!  Elmer gets so much screen time that Im left to wonder if Henenlotter or someone close to him endured a bout with addiction.  This work was clearly important to him, and it presents itself much more significantly than most random B-movies ever could.  We watch as Brian goes through every stage of addiction (including self-awareness).

This was surprisingly satisfying. The gore was adequate and silly and fun, the story actually worked and had something to say, and the title monster was quite likable.",1512172800,,3027,5.066666666666666

Basically an old couple in an apartment building have been keeping a worm like creature as a pet for years in their bath, they've been feeding it brains they get from butchers, the creature can survive on this but doesn't want these type of brains, it wants human. So it escapes into a neighbouring apartment where it finds Brian, a young guy asleep in his bed.  He's supposed to be getting up to go to a concert with his girlfriend but doesn't feel like it.  She leaves with the roommate/brother instead, and when Brian eventually gets up he notices he is bleeding. When he gets to the bathroom he discovers something has bitten the back of his neck.  Eventually he'll discover that something is Aylmer, a large worm like creature that can talk, and that he quite likes the feeling and the visual experience of colours he gets when it gives him it's juice from its fangs into his brain through the hole in his neck. Basically the movie is a parody on drug addiction.

Aylmer is a cool character but he never looks real, you're also from an early scene in a junk yard thinking, surely he'd get squashed and die if Brian escapes up against a car wreck as he's crawling through things . Or die from a jaw closing in another time.  If he did look more real though, I don't think the movie would be as much fun.",1502755200,,1486,4.385454545454546
7889513,5,6305461872,"The following review (with slight modifications) appeared first on my site Mindoftatlock.

From the Mind of Tatlock is back again with another review of a classically absurd Frank Henenlotter film by the name of Brain Damage. If that sounds familiar, that is because I have already reviewed the movie before on my site, so this review will mainly focus on the Blu-ray from Arrow Video, with a few quotes from my previous movie review. Without further ado, lets begin.

REVIEW

If you want to know whether Brain Damage is any good (it is), here a few quotes from my Brain Damage Movie Review.

""Chock full of sexual undertones, anti-drug messages and a weird talking slug monster named Aylmer, Brain Damage is a film that requires a certain taste to like it.""

""I now sit here several hours later and find myself feeling like I really enjoyed this one. Its chalk full of humour and never once takes itself seriously (I mean come on, a talking brain eating slug for petes sake). It also has some nice gory bits and a lot of bloody splatter""

""Brain Damage is most definitely a film which will only attract a certain group of people, who enjoy bizarre situations, with a lot of raunchy and obscene humour.""

""The only thing I can really say that may convince you to give this movie a watch, is if you happened to look up the definition of insanely insane, you would probably see a picture of Aylmer, the brain eating slug next to it and that my friends is how an unknown, but completely enjoyable film comes to be born. Born via a phallic-looking, suave-talking, brain-eating slug creature.""

As you can see, I enjoyed the weird absurdity of Brain Damage, which gave us a big helping of gore, humour and an interesting look at the dangers of drug use, in this case, a brain eating slug substituting for the drug.

Now with that out of the way, what do I think of the Blu-ray? Well, considering that this release is from Arrow Video, you can already guess that I loved the heck out of it. The transfer, for the most part, is fantastic, with a few drops in quality here and there. When comparing it to the DVD release, you can tell the film has benefited from the upgrade. Of course, some of the effects will appear dated on higher resolution, but that just becomes part of the charm of Brain Damage. I should point out that the Synapse DVD release of Brain Damage shows a bit more information on the top and bottom of the frame. In the included photos, you can see a bit more of the shower rod in the DVD picture. You are not losing any information with the Blu-ray release, but I thought I would point it out nonetheless.

Audio quality has also been increased with a choice between LPCM Mono and DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 tracks. Nothing jumps out at me as being terrible. No need to fiddle with the volume control with this one.

Of course, the real treat with this Limited Edition Blu-ray is the special features, in which this disc is overflowing with. You have a 54-minute retrospective, which is highly informative. You also are treated to a few other interviews that can range from 5 minutes (Karen Ogle: A Look Back) all the way up to 20 minutes (Frank Henenlotter Q & A). If you loved Brain Damage and wanted to know more, youll be a few hours diving into all the goodies.

VERDICT

I know this review comes across as being a bit on the short side, but there isn't much more I can say about this weirdly enjoyable 80s horror flick. Its got a certain style that will please some and displease others, but most that are looking to buy the Blu-ray know what they are getting into when popping in this movie. Having said that, the Limited Edition release of Brain Damage from Arrow Video is a no-brainer (no pun intended) pickup.",1501545600,,3729,4.4903988183161
