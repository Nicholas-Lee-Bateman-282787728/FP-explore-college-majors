2996469,4,B000X1ZPEM,"This is an excellent PBS documentary about the life of Woody Guthrie, the great American singer/songwriter (and godfather/forerunner of the folk music explosion of the early sixties). The film tells about his upbringing in a fairly well off family--a secure childhood abruptly ruined by his mother's descent into dementia and violence due to Huntington's disease. This tragic turn of events sends Guthrie into foster homes and eventually helps turn him into a prolific and original American hobo-gypsy songwriter. But Guthrie was a man of many talents; he was a gifted draughtsman, writer, radio host, comedian, ""ladies' man"", and actor (considering the poetic license employed when presenting his unsophisticated ""hick"" persona). The film is narrated by Peter Coyote and features interviews with Joe Klein (Guthrie's biographer), Pete Seeger, and Bruce Springsteen, as well as family members and friends of Guthrie. Conspicuously absent are Bob Dylan and Arlo Guthrie. Still, the film is well-put together; it features some great images and films of Guthrie as well as many priceless recordings of him talking and singing. The narration explains the social context for Guthrie's often very political songs. Most notably, we are informed that the song ""This Land is your Land"" was penned as an angry reply to ""God Bless America""--Guthrie feeling that it is up to Americans to make this country great, not God (Hallelujah!). Besides being informative, the film is moving in its portrayal of Guthrie's tragic last years as he succumbed to the same disease that had destroyed his mother. Ultimately ""Woody Guthrie"" depicts the songwriter as a flawed but heroic American musical genius.",1231459200,31,1682,5.375

8226601,5,B000X1ZPEM,"What a documentary!  Tells the biographical story of Woodrow Guthrie, America's most famous folk singer along with Leadbelly and Pete Seeger.  Great testimonials from the friends and family such as Bruce Springsteen, Pete Seeger, and Woody's wife and daughter.  Great photos.  Great music.  Sad ending to his life.  Yet it's an upbeat documentary despite Woody's slow and painful and sad end to his life.  I thought they could have told of Woody's influence on Bob Dylan more . . .",1498780800,,481,4.9375

8226603,5,B000X1ZPEM,Great documentary on Woody. An American icon and legend. Fabulous documentary. I'd encourage anyone who plays guitar or is interested in music to check out Woody Guthrie.

8226605,1,B000X1ZPEM,"I have been a Woody fan for 40 years and met his family and was a good friend of Will Geer one of his best buddies. There is a much better doc narrated by Billy Bragg that will tell his story well.. It is called ""Woody Guthrie:This Machine Kills Fascists' s The PBS is 90 min and this one 2hr 40 min with great loving detail,  The only thing for  Woody fans to have is a few extra minutes of home footage in this PBS doc. So i can only give it one star as the PBS lack a lot of key elements to Woody's story where the PBS avoids the core story with very little detail.",1466899200,,568,3.8461538461538463
8226606,5,B000X1ZPEM,"This is a documentary about the late folk singer Woody Guthrie made for PBS.  It is 90 minutes long, and is narrated by Peter Coyote.  It features interviews with Pete Seeger, Bruce Springsteen, Woody's daughter Nora Guthrie, his first wife Mary, and others.  Curiously, his son Arlo Guthrie is not interviewed.  Years ago, Arlo Guthrie hosted a documentary about his father, which was a lot like this documentary--except that one had more music and more people who actually knew Woody Guthrie were still alive then to be interviewed.  Since that documentary is out-of-print, this one will do just fine.  Given a choice I would pick Arlo's older documentary, but this one covers mostly the same territory",1466035200,,704,5.025862068965517
