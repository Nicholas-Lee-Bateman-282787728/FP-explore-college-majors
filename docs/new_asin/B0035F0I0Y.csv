8388937,5,B0035F0I0Y,"Sharp and sophisticated, this movie has just risen to my Top Movies of All-time list. I was not expecting much since I simply bought it to see the context of it's most successful song, ""Uff Teri Adaa"". But from the beginning I was hooked by the clever plot line and the endearing characters, none of whom I knew from other works. I won't spoil the Hitchcock-like fun of the plot other than to say that the resolution/conclusion is not in any way contrived or a cheat (like aliens are to blame or it was just a dream). If there is any shortcoming to the conclusion it's that it is too well explained. I immediately had to watch the movie again to find the subtle clues and with the director's commentary it was even more fun and entertaining. All the music is appropriate and fitting, the language clean (PG in my estimation with nothing remotely racy), and the characters sweet and charming. Cinematography is not something I typically notice, but the filming was superb. I show this movie over and over to new audiences who always love it and want to know more about it so I give it my HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION!!",1337126400,4,1111,4.532338308457711
8388938,4,B0035F0I0Y,"""Karthik Calling Karthik"" is a sweet and wholesome yet diabolically Hitchcockian schizophrenic love story. Not the sort of movie we Americans usually see exported from Bollywood.",1322092800,3,178,5.884615384615385
8388939,4,B0035F0I0Y,"Actually this was a really good move! I liked it! I think psychological thrillers are an underdeveloped genre. As far as Bollywood movies go, it wasn't just another stupid love story... It does bring to light some very important issues and that is psychological disorders. I think that mental diorders is still a taboo subject for Indians. This movie brings to light that ultimately, they are just people who are suffering from what can be a very debilitating and life threatening mental disorders. I thought that the acting on both parts was very organic and none of it was very forced. I liked their Chemistry together, I thought they were very believable as a couple.

My only criticism is that it bends the truthfullness of Multiple Personality Disorders quite a bit. It's not QUITE being untruthfull, but it certainlly streches the breaking limit!",1316563200,,852,4.958041958041958
8388940,4,B0035F0I0Y,"As the strange name ""Karthik calling Karthik"" forces you to think about movie, ditto with the well maintained suspense. It forces you or better says engages you for 2.5 hrs that most other bollywood movies never accomplished even for few mins. It's nice to see lot of bollywood movies coming up with tight script and engaging direction. Even most traditional film director/actor is coming with as bold movie as ""My name is Khan""!! . As bollywood is always blessed with powerful actors, but it's only since last few years we are seeing above par script and well crafted direction, and on top of that versatility of subject selection is like icing on cake. Let's hope this trend will continue.

As movie is suspense thriller, it's not worth to discuss story. At glance it look more like beauty and geek kind of material, but turns into more meaningful storyline that keeps you engaging till end. As for Deepika, she is still learning and did as expected to do but Farhan Akhatar is improving with every film. At first he started acting for fun, but now he seems more sincere about the same.

Nothing negative about this movie.

All in all KCK is one more movie from bollywood this year that is worth watching",1300579200,,1206,4.679245283018868
8388941,3,B0035F0I0Y,"Karthik Calling Karthik attempts a psychological mystery which to a certain extent manages to get the job done, keeping you entertained and guessing till the very end. Some of the more clever viewers would probably figure out the ending in advance. I did not and couldn't but that is just me as I just roll with the punches.
Karthik played by Farhan Akhtar is shy and introverted; he is picked on by colleagues and does not have any friends. He secretly pines for Shonali ( Deepika Padukone ) but ends up losing her to a more aggressive colleague. Things are dismal, until one day he receives a phone call. Life starts undergoing a change; he finds confidence, success at work and even manages to woo Shonali. Life is great, but one day he breaks the rules imposed on him by the secret caller.
I liked the movie and it was not just interesting but beautifully shot as well. The makers have managed to make even the most drab places look sophisticated. The music is quite catchy especially Uff Teri Ada.  The second half of the movie could have used some editing and better writing but ....
The movie belongs to Farhan Akhtar who acts well and delivers his best performance so far after Luck by Chance. Deepika manages to look pretty. Three stars. 9/24/10",1285977600,,1254,4.598214285714286
8388942,4,B0035F0I0Y,"I will avoid discussing the particulars, that would spoil the fun. In any case it's unusual to see a suspenseful psychological drama of this quality coming out of India (at least to be seen in the US). The script and plot were well constructed for the subject matter and besides presenting a quite realistic, well researched, portrayal of the problem it allowed for the audience to participate in identifying the source of this problem while maintaining our uncertainty and thus kept us guessing. The acting was spot on - not overwhelming and not insipid. The setting and camera work were effectively minimalist so as not to distract from the drama in the story. I would give it five but for the ending which I feel should have been as bold and dramatic as the rest of the film. Also, the flashbacks, normal for this genre, and are meant to help the audience finalize the ending and the events that led us there were a bit overdone.",1282003200,,932,4.620481927710843
8388943,5,B0035F0I0Y,"I was shocked by the previous review because I loved this film.  Could be differing expectations; mine were not only met but exceeded.  This psychological drama set among the professional world of young, educated up-and-comers in Mumbai is one of the most ""un-Bollywood"" of Bollywood films I've seen, and I've seen many.  Farhan Akhtar plays Karthik, a bright but painfully shy & insecure man who suffers regular abuses by his boss and is virtually invisible to all the other employees at the construction company headquarters where he works.  Out of the blue he begins receiving phone calls from another ""Karthik"" which offer him support and advice, improving his life. He eventually becomes completely dependent on his connection to the caller, and when the calls turn dark they threaten all he has achieved.

The screenplay and directing by 31-year-old, first-time writer/director Vijay Lalwani were taut and understated, which to me is far more effective at drawing the viewer into the story than the excesses of the typical masala Hindi films.  The music by Bollywood veterans Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy was spot on, not showy for it's own sake but lending uncannily perfect support to the story in every scene, even down to the incidental passing scenes.  Deepika Padukone is stunning as usual and her work gets better and better. She plays Shonali, Karthik's long-desired love interest, with a nice balance of vulnerability and coolness.  But it's Farhan Akhtar's film, and he's a revelation here, adding the perfect comedic and dramatic touches to Karthik to steal your heart and send you on an emotional rollercoaster.  At 135 minutes, it's also on the short side for Bollywood films, and as wrapped up as I was in it, it flew by.",1277856000,7,1731,5.066901408450704
8388944,1,B0035F0I0Y,"Oh my God! Another pathetic, stupid film from Bollywood. Is there no end to this kind of crap that this industry keeps churning out? Farhan Akhtar should stick to directing. I am not sure where he got the idea that he can act. One of the biggest flaws of this film is how it fails on its most basic level. The writer(s)didn't think it's important to explain how the main character played by Akhtar becomes so psychologically messed up! It's a painful two hour movie and I would suggest turning to a film from Akhtar's better days like, Dil Chata Hai. Karthik Calling Karthik is mind-numbing and a complete waste of time.",1272931200,,620,4.544642857142857
