8136808,5,B000H5U63E,"You can try this before you buy it by getting it from Netflix. That's how I saw the first 6 disks.  But they don't have the last two.  I had to get those here.  I won't go on about how much I like this series.  At this writing, I've watched it eleven times and nothing has even begun to get old.  So I definitely love owning the whole thing.

I do want to say something about the media itself.  It comes from China.  So --SURPRISE-- the quality could be better.  But this doesn't bother me and it shouldn't bother you.  The first six DVDs are usually okay.  The last two are spotty at best.  Blips of visual static from time to time. You'll have to live with those.  If you get big problems, the vendors will be happy to send you another DVD.  They sent me two extras because of this. Pretty nice.  So I have a #3 with one bad frame and a spotty #7 and #8 with no big annoying passages of that stuff that looks like bad satellite feed.  And I am plenty happy.  I doubt I could do better.

Keep in mind that the Chinese can't even make a decent mandolin nut which the West has been able to do for ABOUT 600 YEARS. (A mandolin nut is a little rectangular block of bone or plastic with eight shallow grooves.) So it will be a while before they master the burning of DVDs. If the Chinese video moguls are reading this, I can tell them that burning DVDs at about half the max speed on the burner helps a lot. I burn my media even slower because I'm paranoid. Maybe they'll take the hint.

EVEN WITH THE QUALITY ISSUES, I GIVE THIS 5 STARS.  NO, MAKE THAT 7.",1317686400,,1552,4.076158940397351
