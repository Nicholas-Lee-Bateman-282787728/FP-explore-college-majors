8311710,5,B001J136IW,"As was previously mentioned, this video assumes that you have a basic understanding of the technical aspects of slide style guitar.  This video is not for beginners but more of an intermediate level.  The first 10 minutes are of Johnny Winter talking and playing in various settings which illustrates his mastery of this style.
The video then goes on to give you a note by note breakdown of some of Johnny's licks which lasts over one hour.  This portion is in open D tuning with Al Eck demonstrating on electric guitar.  The final 20 minutes are devoted to open G tuning with demonstrations on a resophonic guitar.
There is no written tabulature booklet but I feel that this style is best learned by listening carefully and imitating the sound.  The video provides a practical and useful repertoire using the signature pentatonic blues style licks.",1294358400,,849,4.868055555555555
8311711,3,B001J136IW,My only complaint is that the DVD really only works on the TV DVD player and not my PC. It runs on the PC but you can't get jump to different chapters. I wish that this fact was advertised on all DVDs.,1277683200,2,201,3.8095238095238093
8311712,5,B001J136IW,"I gotta hand it to Johnny Winter for making this DVD available to us all. Johnny plays so fast it very challenging to learn his licks and style and this DVD breaks things down including the nuances that make Johnny Winter truly a National Treasure. John himself plays his licks (at about half speed) and the teacher breaks them apart and explains everything. Everything includes the tuning methods, picking methods, and the things that give each lick and riff that special Johnny Winter character. I am truly blessed because when Johnny Winter came through my town this summer he graciously autographed my DVD. Don't ask, NOT for sale!!! Ha ha...If you are a student of the blues or want to play like Johnny Winter, this DVD can make it all work for you.",1251936000,10,754,4.676691729323308
8311713,4,B001J136IW,"This DVD best suits an intermediate guitarist or above who is relatively new to slide.

Johnny Winter actually plays the slide guitar samples specifically for this disc - and that in itself makes the DVD a real treat.  Getting a close-up look at Winter's style, nuances and phrasing is very insightful.  After Winter demonstrates a few bars, Al Eck breaks down the phrases note for note.  Once you've worked through Al's lesson you can re-visit Johnny's tracks to practice along with the master.  Get ready for a challenge - if you're a slide beginner like I am this is NOT as easy as it looks or sounds, but very satisfying as you start to get your mind around it.

It's too bad Winter himself doesn't speak directly to the listener during the lessons, or just for a few moments - as there is probably much he could say that a new learner would benefit from.

If you want to learn slide guitar this DVD will more than get you started with an arsenal of incredible slide licks from one of the true masters of slide, Johnny Winter.",1233446400,8,1030,4.475935828877005
8311714,5,B001J136IW,"I've been playing slide guitar for twenty years, and have been a fan of Johnny Winter all that time as well. Over a lifetime of studying Johnny there has never been such a video as this, detailing many of his hard to transcribe slide guitar solos. After watching Johnny play (which alone is worth the $29.99), instructor Al Eck takes over and really lays out what Johnny is doing on this DVD, slowing the licks down and detailing every little thing. I must admit that if you are beginner, this DVD may not be for you, I think it is for a more experienced slide player as it does not go into basic slide technique. That being said, I would encourage the purchase of this DVD because it is so well done and could only improve anyone's playing. Al Eck does a tremendous job of hosting this DVD, I can't say enough about him, one of the best instructors I've seen in a long time. I own alot of instructional video's, DVD's, and books, and this one has to rank in my top ten all time.",1228521600,15,979,4.268817204301075
