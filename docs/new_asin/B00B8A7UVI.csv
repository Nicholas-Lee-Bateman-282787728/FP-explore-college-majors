8564069,5,B00B8A7UVI,"why did i choose this rating,maybe because Im from England,need I say more. If I had any problem,it is that it should be more on actual play but really ,with a highlights programme it is difficult,very good though,unless you are from the USA.",1381190400,,242,4.651162790697675
8564070,3,B00B8A7UVI,"I was happy to finally have a version of the 2012 Ryder Cup that will play on USA equipment, but at only 60 minutes, it's a disappointment.  Where are the behind-the-scenes moments, social events that lead-up to the Ryder Cup, the Opening Ceremonies, interviews?  The end was too abrupt and went immediately to a repeat (hence the 'bootlegger' aspect maybe).

Seve Ballesteros was the emotional pull to the turn-around story. There should have been highlights of the greatest Ryder Cup duo of all-time, Jose Maria and Seve.  Certainly don't need to see Brookline highlights.  I'm guessing the European version would be far superior at over twice the running time.

Of course if America had won, this would have been a much more complete DVD.  If you add up the total time spent on filler, rapid time-elapse of Chicago and Chicago crowds, it's even more of a disappointment.  Three stars because I'm a Ryder Cup fan.  I'm being generous.",1363996800,3,936,4.8734177215189876
