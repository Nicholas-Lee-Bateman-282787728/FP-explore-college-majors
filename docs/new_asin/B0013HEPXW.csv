I wish they would have focused more on the temple and its actual discovery, instead of the East India Company. But it's still a good documentary.",1528243200,,165,4.928571428571429
8502782,4,B0013HEPXW,Pretty good documentary. A bit slow at times but full of useful information.,1524441600,,76,4.923076923076923
8502783,4,B0013HEPXW,"If you're planning a trip to Indonesia then make sure you get to Borabadour - it's a mysterious, awe-inspiring temple in the heart of the jungle.  If you want to get a bit of background before your trip then this DVD is well worth taking a look at.  But, even if you're not heading to the far-east, you can enjoy a travelogue and history lesson rolled into one without leaving your armchair.  This film gives a really great sense of the place - the jungle, the bustling harbour and the history of this phenomenal temple.",1245801600,,520,4.4526315789473685
