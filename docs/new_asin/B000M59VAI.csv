8535792,5,B000M59VAI,"""African Sculpture"" is another fascinating documentary-style film by Dr. Christopher Roy. This particular film is one of my favorites, and is always enjoyed by my students. It includes two short (about 30 minutes) videos, both of which are visually stunning, and generate great class discussions. I must admit, while the mask carving is interesting - you get to see the entire process, which is normally overlooked when studying African art from textbooks or slides - the leaf mask takes the cake. It is unbelievable to watch the entire outfit come together, and literally transform the performer. Both videos are rich in contextual information, and the visuals can't be beat!",1210204800,,676,5.2110091743119265
