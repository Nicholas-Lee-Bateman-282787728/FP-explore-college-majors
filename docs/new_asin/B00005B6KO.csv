7936934,5,B00005B6KO,"A masterful visual representation of how an artist sees the world and the everyday objects in it.  This film purposefully marries the viewer's experience with the amazing eye of Robert Rauschenberg.  From the town of his birth to the architecture of a window behind him as he speaks, you experience how the artist transforms what he sees into art.  Thus, when you look at Rauschenberg's art, which incorporates these same elements into it, there is a sense of inner knowing, a comradery with his genius, that few viewers will ever come close to realizing in any other fashion.",1177113600,6,576,4.857142857142857
