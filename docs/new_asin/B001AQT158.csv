3464172,5,B001AQT158,This was a great show. But the way NBC is releasing this is appalling they have been disappointing me lately.,1215475200,7,109,4.5
3464173,5,B001AQT158,"Well at last there is some inclination that at least season 2 is gunna be released in the future.
I thought it was only down here in little old Australia that it hasn't been released,like everything else,we're last to get anything new down here,so this has made me at least a bit happier that other die hard 3rd watch fans are suffering just as much as us. Lets get every season out,what a great Christmas gift it would make,but then again we should be grateful with at least season 2 at the moment. UPDATE great to see season 2 is getting released 1 year to the day i posted initial comment. Role on July 7.",1215388800,6,608,4.2956521739130435
3464174,5,B001AQT158,I'm a huge fan of Third Watch and learned a while back that the reason it's taken sooooooooooooooooo long for them to come out on DVD in the US is because of copyright issues on the AWESOME music that plays throughout the show.  It's been released in Japan for years.  Sheesh!  I can hardly wait to get my copy!,1215302400,38,311,4.237288135593221
3464175,5,B001AQT158,Whoever makes the decision to release the Third Watch DVDs needs to realize that there are A LOT of people that will buy them!

3464277,5,B001AQT158,These are fantastic! One of my favorite shows all time. Why can't we get this fixed so that the remaining seasons are available? Obviously from the comments there is plenty of demand so it seems it would be profitable. Of course it seems that corporate america doesn't think they could make enough money to make it worthwhile. Even though the complete series is available overseas. Congrats to corporate america again for thinking about themselves and not their customers. Typical.....,1459555200,,485,5.151898734177215

3464311,5,B001AQT158,"Somehow, I missed this series when it was on.  I'm really enjoying the story lines that interplay through the series.  I am already on disc 3, and hate that there won't be more after I am finished.",1448064000,,197,4.297297297297297
3464312,5,B001AQT158,"This season is filled with a lot of memorable moments in the lives of the first-responders of NYPD and the FDNY. Unlike last season where most of the episodes were centered around the entire case, it seems that the majority of the episodes are centered around a singular character or sometimes even just of side of Camelot. Also Fire House 55 gets a new addition as Amy Carlson joins the cast as FDNY Firefighter and Paramedic, Alex Taylor. Also, sadly this is Bobby Cannavale's last season as Bobby Caffey, one of my favorite characters on the show. The heat intensifies this season both on and off the jobs for our emergency personal as they deal with their baggage from a first person perspective which ends up affecting their relationship with their loved ones and their co-workers. There is also a humorous gag reel included for poops and giggles. One of my favorite episodes from this season are ""After Hours"" which is about the first responders witnessing an accident and coping with the loss. It's a real powerful episode with an ending that'll leave you with some questions. And then there's ""... And Zeus Wept"" which is about a school shooting.

The only problem I have is that the series is that because of copyright issues, the rest of the seasons are on hold. So fans, i urge that you write to NBC or WB or whomever it may concern to release the rest of seasons on DVD or to have every episode available to stream for AmazonPrime members or to put on another streaming service. If it could be done for NYPD Blue, then why not another great television show?

If you admire or even aspire to be a first-responder, then you will like this show.",1447027200,,1654,4.58445945945946

I have to add my voice and review: THIRD WATCH may be the very finest TV series I've watched...ever. Exceptional cast, storylines, characters, settings, attention to detail. Not a single weak link in the production of seasons 1 and 2 that I could detect. Please, please, please...someone facilitate bringing the rest of these episodes to the many fans who still eagerly await them.",1419033600,13,573,4.857142857142857

I really cared what happened to them. I fell in love with them all immediately, and was devastated when Third Watch went off the air, especially considering the garbage that's followed.  I have seasons 1 and 2 (thank you Amazon!), and have loved getting the back story - but how long will I have to wait until I see those interim episodes? And revisit the last few?

When Season 1 came out on DVD, I eagerly snatched it up. Funnily enough, I found I actually enjoyed the show more the second time around. The continuity of Season 1 really holds up well under the watchful eye of a keen DVD viewer.

However, I am disappointed that the remaining seasons have not been released on Region 4 DVD (as I am in Australia). Whatever the reason, be it copyright issues or something else, I would really like to see the studio get it all sorted out soon. A lot of people are very eager to see the remaining seasons on DVD.

I've revisited ""Emergency!"" and still love it, but by comparison, it's squeaky clean, and a product of its time. Third Watch has soap elements, insofar as it spends time on the private lives of the regulars, but there's a method to it. It sheds light on their behaviour on the job. The characters are lifelike, and in most cases flawed, but they are still the ones whose sirens you want to hear if you're in big trouble. They work among real people, the characters of a big city (NY) and, compared with the old ""Emergency!"" show, it's dirty and often thankless work. I'm eagerly awaiting Season 3. The high point of that season was the very tasteful handling of 9/11 - which happened to be on the ""Third Watch"" beat. No jets hitting towers, no drum-beating or wringing of hands, just professionals in the field handling their tasks with no time to ponder the larger situation, and wondering why New Yorkers are holding up signs as they pass, calling them heroes.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Third-Watch-The-Complete-Second-Season/dp/B001AQT158/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Third Watch: The Complete Second Season</a>",1302566400,3,1365,5.413145539906103

3464502,5,B001AQT158,"This is one of my favorite show... and I would've love to buy the entire entire series.  But at this point, it seems unlikely the rest will ever be released.... :/

I agree with most reviews here and I just  want to add in my opinion, this is absolutely the best season of the entire show, so if the rest of the series will never be released, it's not a big lose.

Starting with season #3, especially the 2nd half, for whatever reasons, the show seemed to focus a lot more on the police side of the story.  The story from that point on just seems to focus way too much on the conflict between the police force, drugs and some kind of super crime lords or the corruption within the police force.  This might not be a bad thing, but these story line often made me wonder whatever happens to the characters in paramedic and fire unit.  The showed didn't just toss them aside... but they are just a lot less important later on in the series.

You can see that when some of the main characters that were written off late in the series, the story is a far cry compare to the main character that was written off in this Season#2 (Unfinished Business).

Speaking of that episode, I absolutely love watching ""Unfinished Business"" and ""The self importance of being Carlos""... these two episodes are very emotional and really handles the departure of character extremely well without overdoing it.  I must admit NONE of the any TV/Movies I had watched had such a huge emotional impact on me.  I still believe that even til now in 2011.. and these episodes were shown in 2001.

In conclusion, I highly recommend buying the DVDs for season #1 and #2.  The rest of the series is well worth a watch on A&E if they'd still show it.",1296950400,,1715,4.389240506329114

3464505,5,B001AQT158,"This is truly a great series. It makes NYPD Blue look like Sesame Street. Not a very fair comparison, but It's accurate! If you're sensitive to the sight of blood you may want to know in advance that there can be quite a lot of it at at times. It is very realistic and doesn't really ""read"" like a televised serial- it is very convincing and I found I cared about what happened to the characters.

Without realising, I ordered the pirated (full- up to a point) version. The program is so good that in spite of doubling the costs, I will be buying ALL of it as the genuine releases are eventually issued. A word of warning about the pirated version- it really isn't worth it- it isn't worth anything at all. The picture quality is bad throughout and there are several discs that didn't play at all. There were other discs that played to some extent, but it required constant struggling with the player controls to persuade to run without constantly freezing- a waste of time largely. In a number pf places the TV announcer's voice interrupted things with info on what was coming next. Most frustrating of all was when it appeared to be running but the sound was about ten seconds aheaad of the picture! Aaaarrrggh! You can find the pirated version on Google, but don't bother. Distinguishing features of the fake are that it has all (19) discs in one small square disc folder like you would buy for storing home-made discs, with an absolute minimum of text. The real thing LOOKS real, comes in nice glossy rectangular card boxes as is normal and has a quality look about the whole presentation. Caveat emptor.",1294444800,,1608,4.56401384083045

The characters were ""real"" with normal lives and personal problems. They were nt hot-shot super heros. Just cops, paramedics and firefighters in NYC. The situations were believe-able and the extent to which the writers allowed us to know each characters' heart and soul was great. I espcially like the episode where the team is touched by the deaths of several teens involved in a crash. It has a spiritual side to it that is truly touching.
Excellent show. Great characters. Sorry that it was not on longer. Highly recommend buying this if you love cops, firefighters, paramedic shows.",1281916800,,713,4.852459016393443

The second season has a few less perfect episodes than the first one did. However there are many improvements to make up for it. Many of the stories are even deeper to the point you might be in tears after watching. This show may truly be one of the best shows ever made.

If you haven't never seen Third Watch, I suggest the first season to start with as if you don't see it you will miss alot of the refferences in the story to previous events. Once you see that I'm sure you will definantly want to get your hands on the second season.

I just wish the 3rd season would come to dvd. If anyone knows if it is please let me know via e-mail at animefreak1983@gmail.com . I'm dieing to see it.

3464548,5,B001AQT158,"Third Watch es -en mi opinin- una serie que no ha sido an debidamente valorada, por conjugar  accin, emocin y reflexin intensa en cada captulo.

Por su puesto, la accin genera emocin. La construccin de los dilogos y las secuencias que incluyen la participacin de diversos personajes (bomberos, policas y paramdicos), despiertan intensas emociones. El ritmo es desbordante, aunque en el correr de los capulos va dosificndose, para dar tiempo a que la emocin decante.

Como el drama est presentado a travs de los ojos de esos personajes -no de las vctimas o de los victimarios-, y cada uno de ellos ""lee"" la realidad desde un ngulo distinto, la reflexin que hace el televidente es el corolario de su identificacin con uno o ms de ellos. Pero incluso si un espectador se resiste a subir ese peldao y prefiere quedarse en el de la emocin (o, an en el primer escaln, el de la accin)igualmente va a sentirse plenamente satisfecho.

Para muchos que descubrimos tradamente Third Watch, lo vemos como una joya que la abuela dej olvidada en un cofre, pero al encontrarla es imposible no apreciar su valor, desconocido por tanto tiempo.

La construccin de la trama y de los personajes es inteligente,",1265328000,,1189,4.8088235294117645

3464588,5,B001AQT158,"Now that I hear the music ""may differ"" from that of the televised episodes, I'm still happy but mostly, disappointed. My disgust for the Studios and Music Industry has reached a new level.

I have seen every episode, sometimes 4 or 5 times over. In season 2, the best episode in my opinion is ""After Hours"" - all the episodes are top drawer, but this one is my personal favorite. That episode has a very powerful and spirtual message - especially the ending - which actually begins well in advance of the normal time frame a T.W. episode will end.
(if that makes any sense) - this final sequence begins with a song that is played UNINTERRUPTED from begining to end - a beautiful song that I never would have heard if not for this show - and YES I did buy the CD
""Give Me Strength"" by Over The Rhine
This episode is the 1st reason on my list to buy these DVDS because I can't wait to share it with my family and friends who haven't seen the show. Now I fear some of that powerful imagery will not be as effective without the music. I hope that song I mentioned is NOT one of the ones they cut, nevertheless, all of the music used in Third Watch is so skillfully used it's almost as if the music itself is a character in the show. Studio executives need more ""boots on the ground"" to get a sense of what real people want and not some [expletive deleted] focus group.",1244246400,,1364,4.226053639846743

So WB, keep them coming and we will buy them.  I would buy ten copies of each season if that's what it takes to get to the rest.  One of the best ensemble casts in any drama on tv ever.

in fact the 2-part show ""Requiem For A Heavyweight"" where
Bobby Cannavale's character, Bobby Caffey, is shot and killed
by his childhood best friend, played by Kirk Acevedo.
That episode should've won an emmy because it is played by
all the cast (especially Bobby & Kim) so well and has great
emotional impact!--I actually shed tears when Bobby finally
sucuumbs to his chest wound and joins his once estranged father
in the hereafter as a little child. From that point on until
the show ended, I never missed an episode!
Of course, later on A&E, I saw the whole show from the first

Reporting about an online chat with Warner Home Video this past September, hosted by the Home Theater Forum, we passed along that ""(t)he studio...revealed that the second season of Third Watch is...held up because the 'music costs...are extraordinarily high'"". Nevertheless, fans can cheer up this morning, because Warner has apparently overcome the roadblocks that held this up (or else they substituted music), and are officially announcing that Third Watch - The Complete 2nd Season will come to DVD on July 7th.

The 6-disc set running 989 minutes will include 22 episodes: ""The Lost,"" ""Faith,"" ""Four Days,"" ""Jimmy's Mountain,"" ""Kim's Hope Chest,"" ""The Tys That Bind,"" ""After Hours,"" ""Know Thyself,"" ""Run of the Mill,"" ""History,"" ""A Hero's Rest,"" ""True Love,"" ""Duty,"" ""A Rock and a Hard Place,"" ""Requiem for a Bantamweight,"" ""Unfinished Business,"" ""The Self-Importance of Being Carlos,"" ""Honor,"" ""Walking Wounded,"" ""Man Enough,"" ""Exposing Faith"" and ""...And Zeus Wept"".

Video will be presented in full frame, and audio in English Stereo, with a Japanese Stereo option. Subtitles will be in English, Spanish, French and Japanese. Extras, if any, have not been revealed yet. Cost is listed as $59.98 SRP. Below we've got the studio description of the release, followed by the package art:

Sometimes it seems as if the world is crashing in on itself. It's the job of the first responders to hold it together. Police, firefighters, paramedics: The men and women of the 3-11 PM shift called third watch are ready to serve in situations ranging from small (attending to a frequent 9-1-1 dialer) to playful (a football match between fire departments) to harrowingly large and complex (tracking an elusive sniper who targets cops). The original team of heroes returns and an FDNY newcomer joins them in a 22-episode Season Two that combines the rigors of duty with compelling vignettes of life away from work. What kind of person defies a gun-wielding madman or rushes into a burning building? This kind - the people of Third Watch""

When I realized I was going to miss the last couple of weeks, I decided to purchase the entire series.  I can not believe this excellent show is not completely out on DVD! Now I am even more frustrated because I can't, and don't want to start watching it again on A&E after missing two weeks!  ""Hurry up and release the complete series!""",1219190400,3,501,4.252631578947368
3464660,5,B001AQT158,"Please, please, please, release the rest of the seasons on DVD. I used to watch this show with my ex-boyfriend who's a cop and I even got him turned on to this show. It was one of the best shows on tv. I too used to tape them but the quality isn't that great. I miss watching the cast in action as they fight fires and solve crimes and help put the bad guys away. If I was in trouble and needed help, I would want Bosco on the case. He doesn't take crap from anyone.",1218844800,,466,3.8645833333333335
3464661,5,B001AQT158,"Hurry up and get all the season's on DVD.  I am watching season 4 on A&E right now and I love it.  I never watched it when it was on, so Now I would love to see how it all started.  I just ordered season 1 and can't wait for it to arrive.",1217808000,,238,3.452830188679245
3464662,5,B001AQT158,This show was one of the greats.  Other shows that also used original music by the artists have been released much faster.  NBC needs to get moving and get the full series out there for the fans!!,1217462400,,196,4.27027027027027
3464663,5,B001AQT158,"I am also eagerly awaiting Season 2 (and the rest) of this awesome series. I have Season One, and I watch the other episodes every day on A&E. Third Watch had excellent writing, compelling plots, and complex, interesting characters. (My favorite character is Faith Yokas, played by the superb Molly Price.) There are so many eager fans waiting for these DVD's to be released.",1217030400,,375,4.875
3464664,5,B001AQT158,"I purchased the complete series on DVD through what I now know was a pirated version.  It is lousy quality.  Not in chronological order.  But, I guess better than nothing since Season 1 is all that has been released to date. (which I also purchased from Amazon)  I, too, await further seasons to be released.",1216166400,7,308,4.545454545454546
3464665,1,B001AQT158,"To whom it may concern:

I can't believe, with all the JUNK that's coming out on DVD, that, so far, they've only released Season One.

This series is by far, the best! I can't conceive why it's taking so long to release Season Two, and all the rest. The only reason I can think of is that they wanted to see how many people bought Season One, and if it was worth it to release the rest.

Whatever the reason, PLEASE, PLEASE, let us have the rest!

But this is still well worth anyone's time. I will forever be bitter until seasons 3-6 are released. Considering what a masterpiece this is and how much time and effort went in to making it, it is the least that WB can do.",1519516800,,389,4.6521739130434785
