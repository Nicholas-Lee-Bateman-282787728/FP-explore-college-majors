5273334,5,B0096EE47G,"Since I am a great fan of KDramas, I gave this series a try and ... I loved it ! Very critical story line about the wrongfulness of the  class system (lowly people and Slaves , upper Nobles and the corrupt politician).

This is about honor, love, loyalty and sacrifice ! The fighting scenes were out of this world !!!  Jang Hyuk as slave hunter Lee Daegil, Han Jung Soo as General Choi, Oh Ji Ho as General Song Taeha, Kim Ji Suk as Wangson and Lee Jong Hyuk as "" evil"" Hwan Chulwoong were outstanding !!!

This will be added to my collection !",1386028800,,544,4.152380952380953
5273335,5,B0096EE47G,I loved this series. It was so moving and beautifully done. I would recommend this to my friends and family.,1375660800,,108,4.45
5273336,5,B0096EE47G,"These characters will grab your heart and keep it too!  It has subtitles but you have time to read them as the action is taking place!
Lots of ACTION and DRAMA TOO!!!

I loved loved loved this series, wish it was longer than 24 shows!!!  I recommend this to anyone who likes well made television!!!

Thank you Slave Hunters for such a wonderful series!!!",1366675200,6,354,4.484375
5273337,5,B0096EE47G,"This series was my first experience with sageuk series. Was completely blown away by it. Even reading the subtitles, there were several moments that had me tearing up and a couple flat out made me cry. One of them did not even involve a major character. And usually the only thing to make me tear up in a movie or serious is a serious honorable death or heroic check out. The cinematography is great, the soundtrack is great, the fight choreography is fantastic. Jang Hyuk made me like a character that I doubted I would... how do you make a man who hunts runaway slaves sympathetic? Have Jang Hyuk play him.",1363996800,21,608,4.486486486486487
5273338,5,B0096EE47G,"The ""Slave Hunters / Chuno"" had everything! Costumes, Settings, Love Story, Adventure, Love Story. Oooops! I already mentioned that!  I highly reccomend it! It was our very first of many Korean Episodes! We are true fans of Korean Drama!!!!",1359504000,4,240,5.153846153846154
5273341,5,B0096EE47G,"This is one of the best k-dramas I've ever watched--characters, actors and acting, photography, music, plot, everything  (except for painful slowness in reflection scenes) was superb. The average American viewer would probably find much to criticize in K-drama, but if you understand the genre then you would know this is really an  outstanding piece of work, and as individual K-dramas are a mixed bag of everything from comedy to tragedy, and over a period of (in this case) 24 sessions, the dialogue and plot are not usually consistent, though in this case, the average is much better than usual and hence my five stars rather than, say, four. If they can tolerate the romance, fans of martial arts will also find much to keep them entertained. The characters are unique, colorful, memorable. The score is powerful. Many will not like the ending but it particularly Asian as it is highly symbolic, with a kind of poetic justice, and was probably the only ending that could bring adequate closure. The characters in melodrama are not supposed to change and grow, and I can't fully make my point without a spoiler, but one of the very last scenes,  in someone's lap (not the one on the rocks)  is evidence of growth, and of ultimately of justice. If you're a black and white thinker, you won't get it, but it is profound. This is the second time I've watched it and I got more out of it this time than before, and I enjoyed it a lot the first time. I hope you do do too.",1506729600,,1471,4.581749049429658

5273345,5,B0096EE47G,"What a fantastic epic!  Hollywood could learn from KBS.  Everything was clean, except for a few tavern scenes. As the show progressed, things got cleaner.  Amazon, please bring us more from KBS!",1501891200,,194,5.0
5273346,5,B0096EE47G,"I watched this on Drama Fever before I found out it's available here, too. The sound quality is horrendous sometimes, but it seems like the subtitles are better than on DF...why can't I have the best of both? That being said, it's the best K Drama I've seen. The characterization is just as great as the action scenes. If you're wanting HBO-shocking sex scenes, you won't find it here. (K Drama is kind of a refuge for those of us decent-minded folks who are tired of the dirty quagmire American TV series make us wade through.) Enough said...if you like the first five minutes of episode 1, you will like every single episode, beginning to end. Be prepared to call in sick to work, or else start watching this on Friday night.",1501545600,,727,4.515151515151516

5273351,5,B0096EE47G,"Oh this series is so well done. The story and characters draw you in and you just want to see the next episode till you have to go to bed to sleep some. I had to PURCHASE this so I could watch it once it is no longer a prime selection. The story, acting, costumes and scenery were EXCEPTIONAL. And I want to be able to SHARE this with other family members. So very thankful I stumbled upon this. Because this is not all special effects but acting that make it so very well done. You know when you see something so good you research and look for the actors and directors other projects? Well this series does that. I wish the DVD's were available at a reasonable price this is that good.",1500422400,,686,4.165413533834586
5273352,3,B0096EE47G,"Mushy melodrama infused with sword and martial arts fights. The series dragged on for 24 episodes and then it was rushed off to a quick conclusion in its 24th episode with many loose ends that were not addressed as if the producers did not know how to end this prolonged show. Heavily inlaid with flashbacks, memories, songs periods with no dialogue. Many occasions the music and songs are louder than the dialogue, a technical error. Unless you have the time to kill, don't waste 24 hours of your life on this campy tale!",1500249600,,522,4.623655913978495

5273354,5,B0096EE47G,I watched this a long time ago on Drama Fever.  I loved it.  The Koreans really are great at historical dramas.  I got addicted to Korean historical dramas and have watched as many as are available.,1500076800,,198,4.444444444444445
5273355,5,B0096EE47G,Excellent,1499990400,,9,9.0
5273356,5,B0096EE47G,"This  Korean series was,perhaps, one of the very few TV series where I watched an entire episode from the first to the last without skipping through anything. The slaves, the slaver chasers , the nobility , the royal family ,and the working classes were very well acted by just about all the performers. You saw seemingly hardened men cry over things that touched them most and women evolve and grow strong from adversity. What sticks in my mind is how the action revolved around the ""Royal Grandson"" who is only a child of 3-4 years and has so many people out to kill him. The Royal grandson steals many scenes and is a symbol of hope for the ""new world"" away from slimy politicians and the scheming nobility. A thumbs up to a thought-provoking series. The subtitles were not a problem with me.",1499558400,,795,4.559440559440559
5273357,5,B0096EE47G,"Korean soap operas have developed a formula for love-triangle stories that make you glued to the screen but this one was done on another level. Cinematography was top-notch in that each scene was thought out carefully with the best composition framed like a painting, showcasing the unique beauty of Korean landscape. Character development was fascinating. For example, I thought the director did a superb job to show how the son-in-law of the state councilor fell deeper into evil in each step and reemerged as an unfortunate assassin while experiencing disappointment and betrayal. Like how people are in real life, characters weren't completely evil or good. Lead actors were of course amazing but support actors brought this show to life even in the smallest role. This show started as a love story and morphed into a fight between different classes, a plot to take over the country and finally, international political tension while exploring human nature and greed. I ran into this show because I got sick and needed to kill time and instead I feel I just took a class on an important part of Korean history.",1499558400,2,1114,4.962566844919786

Thought I'd give it a try though and, by the time I finished the second episode I was thinking, ""oh my gawd, what is this!?!, who are these people?!?!,"" and I knew I was in deep trouble.  Seriously, seriously people, it is brilliant!!!  I know everyone can't like every thing, but to me it will prove exquisitely memorable.",1496966400,6,500,4.522222222222222

The story is very complex and keeps pulling me in:  there is political corruption, class tension, romance, ambition.

But there were some scenes that just did not make any sense at all, lack of fluidity between events.  For example, the characters (the two slave chasers) were killed clearly by the murderer (son in-law of second state counsel, he killed everyone) and suddenly those two came alive without any reasonable explanation; that leaves the viewer totally confused.  And the general Song, who is an excellent fighter, no explanation why he is captured by a slave chaser, who could hardly beat him many times before.

The acting by some of the actors could be improved but the main characters did a fantastic job.  The heroine played a damsel in distress but that was to be expected in the era in which the film was based.  I highly recommend this series,1455753600,,337,4.566666666666666

As they used to say i.e. The Ten Commandments, it has a cast of 'thousands'.  Every segment of the Joseon era society(so this is a period piece) is represented...royalty, politicians, scholars, merchants, law enforcement officers, military men, women of ill repute, criminals, and slaves.  I'm not certain that is a comprehensive list, but you understand the magnitude of the story.  It even included a physically handicapped wife who loved her husband.  Theme portrayals of loyalty, friendship, greed, self-absorption, betrayal, etc., are present.  It's very emotionally charged as well with prejudice, hate, and genuine love.

It has a combination of comedy, drama,  action and romance. Several of the secondary characters are endearing, which make watching it  much more enjoyable, at the times where the main characters  plot line is stalling.

5273607,5,B0096EE47G,"The Slave Hunters, a romp through medieval  Korea, is a great sageuk (period drama).  It has 5 stories interrelated:.  1)  The Slave Hunters: Dea-gil is a fallen noble and the slave hunter.  He and his gang heartlessly pursue runaway slaves for the reward money.  2)  The Love Story: Song Tae-ha, a defeated and framed general who is condemned to slavery but runs away, falls in love with Eonnyeon who was Lee Dea-gils former slave mistress and his life long obsession, but now she is  a lady of standing.  3)  The Slaves: The story of the brutalized slaves, their arrogant masters and the slaves efforts to revolt against the class system and exact revenge for the all of the injustices they have endured.  4) The Common People:  Two women running a tavern and road house trying to make ends meet, their hopes and dreams of true love; and their problems dealing with overbearing customers and the corrupt police.  5)  The Noble Class:  Finally, is the story of the upper and royal classes with its political intrigue, and what evils they perpetrate on the common and lower class people.  And here is where the real villains are!

I disciplined myself and did not cram-watch this series, but watched it over a period of two weeks.  Thus I was able to savoir and enjoy the anticipation and cliff hanging techniques of the episodes.  I have to thank Amazon for making this show available for prime members as I would never have discovered it otherwise.  I don't mind subtitles as I am hearing impaired and prefer them

This series has everything:  action, sword fights, martial arts, great chases, bawdy comedy, love stories, unrequited love, vicious villains, lovable villains, great and heart felt acting, and each story and character with their own theme music and with even a little poetic justice sprinkled in.  The filming and landscapes are breath taking.  Even the costumes are amazing, with the slaves dressed thread bear with their straw sandals to the nobles and the upper classes and courtesans adorned in silk with detailed embroider decorations.  The assassins ominously dressed all in black and purple attire sends shiver down ones back

The back stories and secondary character are as interesting and heart felt as the main characters, for example, Seol-hwa, the runaway prostitute who tags along with Dea-gil and his gang much to their irritation is one of the most fetching and endearing characters with her unrequited love and indomitable spirit.  She  just reaches out and grabs your heart.  I have to hand it to the Koreans, when it comes to acting, story telling and entertainment, they are second to none.",1446336000,18,2626,4.891156462585034

I was struck by the grittier bits in this story and I watched the whole thing. There were some good fight scenes, and some very nice and creative camera work and effects here and there - like the scenes (around episode 5?) where the character Song Tae-ha is fighting while carrying a baby. However unlikely that may seem there was an unusual bit of video editing I liked a lot. The music works, the starting and ending title and credit screens are well done and it still holds up even though it is a few years old. I also enjoy the characters with a mix of good, bad, flawed, good with bad traits, bad with noble traits, unrealized desire etc. Not perfect but there was enough to love that I gave it a 5.",1444867200,8,878,4.263473053892215

This has a everything romance, pathos, vengeance, action.  It is also great to watch for cool martial arts, guy bonding, sword fighting, and romance.  if you get a chance watch it.

It's smart and incredibly well written and conceived, the episodes justify themselves as an individual chapters, which is something many newer American shows, good as many are, still struggle with, while also moving along the greater story.

By the third episode, I was hooked. There was lot going on within the storyline which kept you interested. There were some minor storylines (the innkeeper ladies and related characters) which I thought would amount to something but in the end it didn't add any value to the overall plot.

The show did a great job in keeping you coming back for more and raising your expectations with all the plot twists and character development.  The writers did a great job in getting you to love and hate the various characters.  By episode 23, I was anticipating a grand finale with a great ending.  The writers spend so much time developing the story line and making you invest more than 20 hours delving into the plot that you wouldve expected the conclusion be a bit more developed.  But within 30 minutes, the 20+ hour story comes to conclusion with a mediocre ending.  It felt the director took all that plot development and then spend a few minutes to come up with the ending.

4.5 stars for making the show extremely interesting and for the great character development, but 1.5 stars for an ending that made all the character development and plot fizzle into an unsatisfactory conclusion.",1425254400,2,1331,4.6581196581196584

There are 2 main plots (with many great twists and subplots within) and the main characters in each of them are magnetic. There's a bit of a jolt after the beginning where you aren't too sure what is going on but once you realize it, the tragedy becomes clear yet as always in these dramas, the characters are true and must go where they are going. A Korean friend of mine doesn't like it as much as I do.  I'd put it up there with the original HaraKiri. 9.5 out of 10.",1418947200,,614,4.108333333333333

And although its states SEASON 1, 24 episodes are all that were ever made. The Slave Hunters combines drama, action and not too much of that slapstick comic relief that I think a number of people in the American audience finds to be a bit over the top. Each episode ends with a bit of a cliff hanger that I found to be incredibly frustrating...but in a good way.

I think of it more as a movie because it is so beautifully made with sweeping panoramic scenes,beautiful period costumes, and characters with so much depth and talent. Who puts this kind of quality into a tv series anyway? I came across it by accident on Amazon Prime and because I was raised on Asian shows, I thought I'd give it a try. At first it was okay, but soon I was hooked as each character became real. I actually get more from watching facial expressions and listening to the characters' voices than the subtitles. I love the action scenes with swords and martial arts, the romance, the out of this world comedy, the political intrigue is not much different than today's politics, and the cliff hangers make it impossible to wait for the next episode! It's wonderful to see that Korean men cry as easily as women and still remain masculine. General Song Taeya has stolen my heart with his looks, compassion, and sword fighting. How can anyone look so handsome in rags! Daegil is the most endearing slave hunter with his amazing physical abilities and obsession for Enyeonn. Enyeonn is so beautiful and progresses in her role from innocent, respectful, to courageous.  And the tavern crew are constantly cracking me up! I recommend this show for everyone to see.

She's annoying, totally non helpful, more of a human parasite, complains  constantly, is such a total looser than no slave hunters would every keep her around.

The leading lady was outstanding too, she is specially sweet and performed well to show the deep feeling of the role. The customs, make up and cinema-photography are the best. Specially in the TV shows, each film are well thought and designed.  This is one of the best Korean TV show I have seen. Even though I am not a huge fun of Korean modern life TV show.  But I LOVE to see more historical stories from Korea.",1403395200,,862,4.430379746835443

5273741,5,B0096EE47G,"Cons: The subtitles did terrible job on this gem (misuse of pronouns can be confusing if you don't follow the story closely as well as, leaving out some critical info in a couple of places) but that's was the only thing wrong with it. I fell in love with the two male leads and the respect they earned from their respective crews. The art direction, the locations, the beauty shots pulled me in while the complex and compelling soundtrack stayed with me. I wanted more and more of this 22 hour mini series. It won many awards in its own country. Also it says season one as if there is a season 2 but sadly for the viewers there's only one. Men will marvel at the action scenes. Women will love the romance. All will laugh at  the funny moments along the way. Do yourself a favor stay with this for 5-6 episodes one of the main stars doesn't appear until well into the story. Beautiful, well acted and much enjoyed. Makes you thankful at our freedom. This is listed as both ""Chuno"" and ""The Slave Hunters""on You Tube and has thousands of videos from the series.",1402617600,,1060,4.380710659898477
5273742,1,B0096EE47G,"My rating does not reflect the quality of the show, which I would give 5 stars, but the low quality of the DVD set. First, the DVD case is constructed from cheap plastic. For example, a piece of the case chipped off when I removed it from its cardboard jacket and one of the plastic clips holding the disc sleeves broke off. Second, the video quality is mediocre because the video was transferred from a 16:9 ratio to 4:3. Third, the English subtitles have many spelling and grammatical errors and are a simplified translation compared to other subtitles that I have seen for this show. Lastly, there is at least one scene where the background music has been dropped, an omission that diminishes the effectiveness of the scene.

Even though Chuno is excellent, the high quality of the show cannot compensate for the low quality of this DVD set.",1401580800,3,844,4.6644295302013425
5273743,5,B0096EE47G,"Loved it!  I was caught off guard at the level of enjoyment and need to continue watching until I completed the full series.  Much like reading a good book, I didn't want to 'put it down'.  After the first few minutes,  I thought maybe it wasn't for me.  But, I continued to watch anyhow, and couldn't stop.  I loved the characters, and each of their particular story lines. I watched all the seasons, and sad to see it end.  Now, I am the 'slave to my hunt' for a similar asian series.  (Some other series I enjoyed - (not similar to S.H.'s - different genres); The Tudors, Spartacus, Rome, The Borgias, The Walking Dead (not my typical type but surprisingly good) - (some I might have watched on Netflix free). I am currently watching Game of Thrones. Still looking for my next captivating asian series if anyone has suggestions..?",1401321600,,833,4.543624161073826
5273744,2,B0096EE47G,"This is a pretty low quality DVD set.  The original show was shot in 16:9 ratio,  but this is a 4:3 pan-and-scan transfer which looks horrible on a modern display.  The subtitles are also very generic and do not capture much of the ""flavor"" of the Korean conversations on screen;  for example,  the Hulu subtitles are excellent and provide a lot of context and capture the humor and disposition of the language,  this DVD set has very literal translations that drop a lot of the implied context (especially with respect to honorifics and nicknames).

All in all,  it's not the worst DVD set I've ever got,  but it is pretty terrible.  Would not recommend.",1400889600,7,655,4.666666666666667

The characters are engaging, the acting is just great, and the humor is over the top - I laughed myself silly in many of the scenes. I'm now on episode 6 and can't wait to get back to it today. Love the scenery - beautiful; camera work is well done; interactions between characters believable and a story line, as I said, that hooked me right in. I'll definitely be looking for similar shows - and hoping to find them. Highly recommend this - it's not necessary to understand Korean (I don't) to follow and whoever did the English subtitles used quirky slang that is pretty hilarious.

8536682,5,B0096EE47G,"Don't be put off by ""season 1"" .  That is all there is. There is no season 2.  One complete story.  This is not the best Kdrama, but it is close.  love, betrayal, action.  The way the South Korean's hook you is without explicit sex or violence or swearing.  They hook you with good acting and wonderful stories.  After a while of watching with subtitles, you almost forget they are there.  There are hundreds of kdrama's, if not thousands.  I have already watched this one twice.  Every now and then i re-watch a kdrama because it was that good.  Kdrama's are not like american soap operas.  They are more like 10,16,18,24,32,50+ hour movies. one (jumong) is over 100 hours!  I binge watch them.. as if they were one continuous movie.  stopping only for food and bathroom breaks.  and i watch till i drop.. wake up and watch some more.  The closest western media to a kdrama would be the series 24 with keifer sutherland.  Or le compt de monte cristo or jane austins pride and prejudice (mini series).  But Kdrama's blow those away.  This drama is about old Korea ""during the joseon dynasty"" (ended around 1910 after 500 years).  There were 3 classes of people rich/govt/royalty middle/respectable jobs and poor/disgusting/dirty jobs.  there were slaves who were essentially property of their owners. (if you were a slave at least you wouldn't starve to death)  Chuno is a slave hunter.  The slave hunters track down escaped slaves.  ""chuno"" is the story of one upper class man who became a slave hunter to avenge his family from the slaves who betrayed and killed them.
