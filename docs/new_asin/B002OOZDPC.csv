3962680,2,B002OOZDPC,"The plot is totally unbelievable. The idea that a group of ex-soldiers could pretend to be Black and no one finds out they are white until one of them is tortured is not too realistic. The dialog is someone's idea about how mobsters and police talk, someone who has never talked to anyone from either group. A close knit group of soldiers do not detect that the leader they served with in Vietnam is being impersonated by another unit member they served with is ridiculous. I served in Vietnam. The flashback scene in Vietnam did not look at all like anywhere in Vietnam.

As has already been said by others the copy of the video is horrible. You cannot even read the credits at the end.",1401667200,,687,4.4523809523809526
3962681,1,B002OOZDPC,"lousy picture, not worth the effort, no plot.  Waist of time viewing.  Skipped through it and didn't find anything worth watching.",1400198400,,130,5.142857142857143
3962682,1,B002OOZDPC,"I couldn't get more than 15 minutes into this via Amazon streaming before I realized it was time utterly wasted. The script must have been some film school student's first attempt at writing. It's hard to believe anyone was actually PAID for this schlock. To top it off, the video transfer quality is SO POOR that there were ghost images and pixelization. I know it's not my Sony HDTV or Roku receiver since the last Amazon streamed movie I watched only an hour before was crystal clear. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!!",1361577600,3,511,4.626373626373627

3962700,3,B002OOZDPC,"THIS IS NOT CODE NAME ZEBRA!!!  This is actually, ZEBRA FORCE (1976).  Mike Lane appeared, in both films, so that's how somebody, probably, made the mistake.  It's a typical, 70's, drive-in / grindhouse, exploitation film, nothing more.",1435708800,2,236,5.324324324324325
3962701,1,B002OOZDPC,"Digitally remastered? This release from Film Rise looks like the same crappy transfer everyone else is offering, maybe the color is slightly more vibrant but the image appears to be sourced from a vhs tape, probably in ep mode. Wish someone would offer this in a good quality transfer, but this ain't it.",1431734400,,304,4.754716981132075

8376269,2,B002OOZDPC,"a movie to be avoided. you expect Richard Roundtree to appear on the screen any minute, since the musical score seemed identical to his 70's drug movie. hardly visible, easily comprehensible since it has been repeated so many times in other films in recent decades. Read a book.",1465603200,,278,4.8125
