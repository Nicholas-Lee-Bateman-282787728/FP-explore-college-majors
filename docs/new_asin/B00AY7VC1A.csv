8559122,5,B00AY7VC1A,"This instructional DVD is better than I thought it would be.  The instructor goes at a rather slow pace while he explains what he is doing. He explains ""why"" and ""when"" each of the styles would be useful.  The camera work is excellent in that it shows the instructors finger positions on the fret board ""up close"".  It also shows the movements of his strumming hand up close.  If you are a complete beginner, you should learn to play a few chords before trying to follow this DVD.  I am very glad that I bought this DVD.  I plan to also get the DVD called ""Mastering Fret board Harmony"".  If you want to learn how to play rhythm on a guitar (ANY guitar), get this DVD.  At the current low price, it's a no-brainer.",1420675200,5,714,4.276119402985074
