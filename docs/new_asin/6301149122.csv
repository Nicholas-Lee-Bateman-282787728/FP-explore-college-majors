7809857,5,6301149122,"This movie is priceless!  It's about two best friends who are street musicians  (Helen Slater plays violin and her roomie plays cello) living the poor starving artist's life.  They're behind in rent and suddenly a friend shows up with a bag and asks them to watch it for her.  Turns out it's full of money!  This leads to a wild shopping spree when they get robbed and their instruments get stolen.  It's filled with laughter and fun and I'm STILL waiting for it to come out on DVD or BluRay! It's an 80's film that's one of my favorites!  If you have a vcr, I totally recommend getting this!",1417305600,2,592,4.376146788990826
7809858,3,6301149122,"Just like she-devil, I think i am the only person who really enjoys this flick. MM from thirty-something is always likeable and Supergirl plays a real Valley girl airhead. A drug dealer stashs thousands of dollars in a paper bag in the two girls' apartment. They discover it and ""borrow against"" the loot!!! Very likeable and entertaining worth a look on a rainy day. I also like L. divine a lot (the harried teacher from ""Boston Public""). A agree w/ previous reviewer: the 2 actresses have great chemistry (like the unappeachiated Outrageous Fortune) !!!! Cheque it out!!  Atomic Rooster Collectables (Rochester NY USA)",1211846400,3,620,5.019417475728155
