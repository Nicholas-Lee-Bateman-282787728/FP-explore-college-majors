8013183,4,B0001IXTVS,fun film especially since I'm in it,1445212800,,35,4.142857142857143
8013184,5,B0001IXTVS,"I thought the movie was great. I knew going into the movie that it was made with a low budget. I also knew that the martial arts in the movie is the real ""thing"". These are real martial artists doing what they do best, intense martial arts action. I looked up the lead actor D. Al. Jackson. As it turns out this guy has a few dojos in Florida and has been practicing martial arts for decades. He's the real deal for sure. I'm sure that the director had to slow down the film to catch his action. Honestly, he moves too fast to capture everything. If there was a category of the most leathal man per per pound, or per height I'd have to give it to this guy. He invented the whirling tiger style of kung fu.

If you can appreciate ""real"" martial arts (more so than the storyline) then the DVD is worth it.

That's pretty much what I think about the movie. Buy it, watch it.. then go on..",1203292800,2,885,4.109826589595376
8013185,3,B0001IXTVS,"Before watching this movie, I ask that you lower your expectations. Keep going. Down further. More. A lot more. Right there. That's good. Recognize that this isn't a ""B"" movie. It occupies a space somewhere between ""C-"" and ""D"". Those terms haven't been coined but I think you understand.

ETERNAL GANGSTAS is the story of two ruthless men who throughout time, through reincarnation, have killed one another multiple times. In the present, they appear once again as two rival assassins named Grey and Mongoose. This time, the setting is an urban gang war which leaves the two heartless men in the center of a deadly game of winner takes all.

As far as the other aspects of the picture... First, pretty much across the board, the acting is horrendous. The actor who plays the central character Grey is the only actor who's even remotely convincing and I'm being generous. Second, the cinematography is 4th rate to say the least. While the camera work wasn't too bad, the overall look of the picture was unsatisfactory. This film was most likely shot using mini-DV. If that's the case, it's obvious that the camera's stock effects were used along with a semi-professional edition of a special effects software program.

The audio is a mixed bag. The movie was done a great disservice with the use of stock sound effects that you can get off of any specialty cd. While the music chosen was excellent, the voices were low in the mix while also suffering from too much reverb. Also, the voice-over that's present throughout the entire film is overkill. The action scenes can't be compared to anything produced by Hollywood or upscale independent films but they were at least enjoyable to my eyes. There are a couple of scenes, involving fights between Mongoose and Grey, that indicate the performers are skilled.

Inconsistencies between scenes indicate that filming was interrupted for a stretch of time. This is most apparent with the hair styles of Grey's mob boss and peripheral character Rakeisha. While not particularly distracting, it's easily noticed.

While I enjoyed the direction of the movie, I recognize that the script is no better than ok. But the dialog for most of the characters is pathetic. While the movie has martial arts, it should be noted that this is a gangster flick. However, very few of the characters use curse words. The mob boss and Grey refuse to drop an ""F"" bomb while each character is guilty of using phrases such as ""Where the devil have you been?"" or ""Where the devil is this going?"". Completely unsatisfying. A gangster flick should be laced with ""F"" bombs and other curse words.

In spite of all the aforementioned, I still found this movie enjoyable to watch. I have a soft spot for low budget movies and this movie's was obviously miniscule. I liked the story, the bad actors and but most of all the intensity of the central character. If you're also a fan of low budget movies, Eternal Gangstas should bring you some enjoyment. It will make a great double feature with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Durdy-Game/dp/B00006LPHI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Durdy Game</a>. If this type of movie isn't your cup of tea, drink coffee.",1199664000,2,3208,5.009380863039399
8013186,1,B0001IXTVS,"This is the worst movie ever.  I bought this movie thinking what the hell could be so bad about it.  Well everything, the acting is so poor.  Trust me the only way you should buy this thing is if you are trying to prove to someone that there isn't a movie in existence that is worse. After making it, the producers and directors must have just had it sent out. There is no way that they could have actually watched it and still have it put on the shelves.  It should be banned.",1180915200,,477,4.096774193548387
