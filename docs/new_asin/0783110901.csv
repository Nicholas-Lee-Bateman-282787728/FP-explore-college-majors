46598,4,0783110901,"It's no secret that Hollywood has backed off of traditional socially conscious dramas.  Oh, sure, issues of race and class are often touched on in cinematic releases, but in recent years, it has been pretty much up to cable channels such as HBO and TNT to produce meaty fact-based dramas with socio-political heft.  We can only be thankful that someone has picked up the slack and that such work is still being done.  ""Miss Evers Boys,"" a dramatization of what has become the now-scandalous Tuskegee Negro Syphilitic Study, is a case in point.  It is as powerful an indictment of racism as you are likely to see.  It is also a nuanced and complex a statement on same.  It is hard to see how any viewer could remain unmoved by this film.
Much of ""Miss Evers'"" impact stems from Alfre Woodard's astonishing performance as the title character.  Had this actually been a theatrical release, she would likely have walked off with an Academy Award.  She had to settle for an Emmy, which was certainly well-deserved.  I have seen Alfre Woodard in roles in which she did not appear comfortable, but she inhabits the role of Nurse Eunice Evers totally (or perhaps, Eunice Evers inhabits her).  Her performance alone would be enough to recommend the film.  But it does indeed have much more to offer--including a great supporting cast (including producer-leading man, Laurence Fishburne, Joe Morton and Craig Sheffer), an intelligent and complex script, and capable direction.  Thanks be unto the heavens that someone is still producing powerful, fact-based social drama.  We need them now more than ever.",1022889600,57,1595,4.928838951310861

46600,4,0783110901,"I cannot attest to the historical accuracy of the story told in this film, but I would say that it offers a richer, less cartoonish account of this experiment than one usually encounters.  You are beside the physician and  nurse who run this experiment as they sort out the reasons for and against  cooperation with what is clearly a problematic experiment.  The result is  an account that requires a more thorough ethical analysis than most  students engage in when they condemn this experiment outright.  I found  it engrossing as a story and extremely effective as a case study in medical  ethics.",911779200,10,600,4.861386138613861

46725,4,0783110901,A look at one of the cruel and inhumane experiments that black people were subjected to in American History.  No wonder black men are historically skeptical of seeking medical treatment today and suffer from many treatable health related conditions.  The United States government has been complicit in what is tantamount to systemic torture and intentional genocide.  I recommend this movie to everyone as a true story and example of one of the many horrible crimes committed against people of African decent by governments throughout the world.  This is a story that has been swept under the rug so to speak because it is a story not widely discussed about in many communities as a learning experience.,1434844800,4,703,5.0344827586206895

The film made me angry, but the point is the film had the power to move me to anger. It put faces and stories to the men who were affected by the Syphilis Study at Tuskegee. It wonderfully portrayed the ethical dilemma that health providers faced in treating...or not treating...this man, though I personally feel the choice should not have been that hard.

46870,5,0783110901,"""For the greater good.""  This is what I'm left with after watching Miss Evers Boys; for the greater good.  The movie makes one feel as if he/she must choose sides.  Did Eunice Evers do what was right?

We know the government was wrong for funding such an experiment and denying the syphllitic men treatment.  Even the doctors reasons for carrying on with the study once a cure (penicillen) became available were questionable.  But Nurse Evers is the one answering questions at a congressional hearing in this movie and she is the one who cared most for the men. Watch Ms. Evers ""bare her burden in the heat of the day.""

The racist belief of the time held that syphilis manifested itself differently in Blacks as compared to Whites.

This movie is a very gripping account of the Tuskegee Syphilis Study conducted on unsuspecting black men for over 40 years.  The men thought they were receiving medical treatment for ""bad blood"" but instead were lied to and monitored by a medical program sanctioned by the united states government. It is as much a story of moral ethics in science as it is a travesty of social injustice.

The cast is brilliant, the story tragic, depressing and awfully real.  But as the good doctor Brodus says to nurse Evers as she battles with her conscience whether to climb up that next hill and continue with the study; ""where you gonna go, they don't just let us go where its nice and flat, its all hills for us, we either climb or we stay at the bottom, that's the only choice they give us.""

I'd like to think that this movie gives tribute to the real nurse Eunice Rivers, as well as the real black men who participated in the study.  Their sacrifice and contributions may or may not have been ""For the greater good."" And if so, then who's greater good was it for?  Its for each viewer to decide.

Actors Alfre Woodard and Laurence Fishburne are amazing!

46897,5,0783110901,"""Miss Evers' Boys"" is one of the best made-for TV films I have ever seen. The acting is superlative and so is the writing. The casting is well done, too; and the musical score enhances the film. The plot flows along very well even though flashbacks are mixed with Nurse Evers' being questioned in the early `70s by a Senate panel.

When the film begins we quickly learn of a program in Tuskegee, Alabama to treat African American men for syphilis. The men are told they are being treated for ""bad blood"" because the staff (including African Americans) doesn't want to scare them and they also aren't sure the relatively uneducated men will completely understand the physiology of their actual illness. Nurse Evers (Alfre Woodard) and Dr. Sam Brodus (Joe Morton) are eagerly on board to help these men. However, when Dr. Douglas (Craig Sheffer) tells Dr. Brodus that federal funding for the treatment program has dried up, the four hundred-plus men being treated are grossly and tragically misled--they are told that they are continuing to be treated when in actuality the government will now only pay for them to be studied, not treated and certainly not cured. Initially, Nurse Evers and Dr. Brodus are told by Dr. Douglas that they'll regain federal funding for more treatment inside of six to twelve months tops--but years go by and they begin to realize that they are participating in a horrific lie: These men will probably never be treated for syphilis and they will be studied until they die. Until they die--and this is all in the name of proving that the African American male reacts to syphilis the same way as the white man does.  The government purposely denies these men treatment because they are African American, poor and unimportant to the powerful people in Washington; that's disgusting, disturbing and horrific.

Some will say that Nurse Evers should have left this program on principle--it's highly unethical, to say the least; and she has a very good prospective husband in Caleb (Lawrence Fishburne) who has syphilis but who gets a penicillin shot and then spends time overseas during World War Two to fight for our country. Caleb returns to Eunice and wants to move North somewhat to make a better life for the both of them. Even Nurse Evers' father wants her to go with Caleb! However, Eunice Evers stays because she is deeply attached to the suffering men and thus she has too big a heart to turn her back on them; she truly wants to do what little she can by comforting them and bringing at least a little smile to their faces now and then with some humor and genuine empathy.

Alfre Woodard carries this film like a champ; what a performance she gives! Lawrence Fishburne's acting is superlative. Look also for fine performances by Obba Babatund as Willie Johnson, one of a four man group calling themselves ""Miss Evers' Boys"" because they all love her so much; Thom Gossom Jr. as Ben; Ossie Davis as Eunice's father; E.G. Marshall as the Senate Chairman and Von Coulter as Hodman Bryan.

Overall, ""Miss Evers' Boys"" is a fine dramatization of the real-life ""Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis in the Negro Male."" I highly recommend this film for people interested in this matter; and people studying ethics would do well to get this film. Moreover, the film will also appeal to persons interested in medical and African-American issues.",1339632000,4,3367,4.82842287694974

46920,5,0783110901,"This movie is a great one to watch. When I first saw this movie a few years ago, I loved it and it became an instant favorite of mine. Based on the true story of the infamous ""Tuskegee Study"", it is quite a shocker. Nurse Eunice Evers (played beautifully by Alfre Woodard) is invited to work with two doctors on a program that was federally funded to treat patients afflicted with the syphilis disease in Macon County, Alabama. The patients--who were men--were being given free treatment. But within a while, the program ended and was withdrawn by the government. When this happened, money was offered for what became known as ""The Tuskegee Experiment"", which was a study of the effects of the syphilis disease on patients who didn't get treatment. Immediately after, the men were being told that they were being cared for, when they were declined the proper medicine that would have fully cured them. Miss Evers was then faced with such a scary issue: she would have to abandon the study and inform her patients of the news or to stay quiet and offer nothing but comfort. The movie is mostly shown in flashbacks, starting in 1932 when the program started, up to the ""present"" in 1973. Laurence Fishburne (who also was executive producer of this movie) plays Caleb Humphries, who had known Eunice since childhood. This is a must see movie for anyone, whether they are going into the medical profession or not. Alfre Woodard won an Emmy for her performance, and truly deserved it (if this movie had been made for the big screen, she obviously would've won an Oscar).",1286928000,6,1565,4.7153284671532845

46939,5,0783110901,"Unfortunately, the ""Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphillis in the Negro Male"", which began in 1932 in Alabama, is strong proof that clinical studies were not created equal. In this experiment, poor African American males were not treated for syphillis and not told of their true condition.

When penicillin became available as a treatment, the subjects were not afforded the option of getting the shots. (NOTE:  Depending on the stage of syphillis, penicillin may not be a safe treatment option)

As a result of unethical treatment on the part of the experimenters in this study,  the US National Health Investigation Board was developed in 1979. This board promulgated Institutional Review Boards and ethical guidelines for the conduct of clinical research studies. None of the clinical staff of this study faced any criminal charges.

""Miss Evers Boys"" is a made for television dramatization of the Tuskegee Study from the point of view of Nurse Eunice Evers (Woodard).

The film details the RN's enthusiastic enlistment into the study because she believed The New Deal was for everyone and was going to help African Americans.

According to the film, the original study offered treatment for syphillis patients--who were told they had 'bad blood' because the doctors believed most of the men would not understand the physiology of their disease.

Later, when treatment funds dried up, researchers were encouraged by the National Health Service to continue the study to determine the effects of the disease.  At the time, they believed that monies for treatment would be available within six months to a year, tops. The experimenters were depicted as sympathetic and trapped in an unfortunate situation.  The Congressional Hearing panel who conducted the expository hearings on this study apparently felt similarly because no researchers were charged with cruelty regarding this study.

The film is an excellent study in medical ethics.  It's impossible to watch this movie without tears in your eyes and anger in your heart.

46968,4,0783110901,"This is a made for cable drama based upon true events. As such, historicity takes a back seat to drama. That being said, there is no real reason to complain about this film. It depicts a despicable human experiment that took place near Tuskeegee, Alabama, beginning in 1932 and continuing for several decades. In a government study, black men with syphilis were offered treatment and records were kept on their progress. They got better. Suddenly, the funding for the program was cut. Some time later, a new program was begun. In this one, the black syphilitic men were studied and treated but the treatments were placebos. They served as a control group. Originally, the promise was that, upon completion of the program, the patients would be given the real treatments. In actuality, so much data was derived from these men that the program continued and continued for years with no real treatment. Eventually, the men began to die off and their minds an bodies succumbed to the devastation of the disease.

One might well wonder why men would agree to take part in a study like this. The key was, they were never told that they were not being treated. They thought they were getting good health care but the system considered them expendable.

One might well wonder why caring medical practitioners would agree to be involved with this study. They did not think they had any real choice. If the study was not done, the men would get no care at all. At least with the study, other health care treatments were given.

Her responsibilities included recruiting African American subjects. They were screened for being syphilis positive and then brought into the research study without full disclosure that no actual effective treatment was being provided. Even when penicillin became available, ""Miss Evers' Boys"" would not be given the life-saving medicine. Only one of the ""Evers'Boys"", Caleb Humphries (who was expertly played by Laurence Fishburne) escaped the ravages of progressive syphilis by receiving penicillin immediately upon joining the military during World War II.
