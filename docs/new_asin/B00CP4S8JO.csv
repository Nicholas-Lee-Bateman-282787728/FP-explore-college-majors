8584211,5,B00CP4S8JO,"Always like to hear Neil! When the Harvest album came out in about 1972, I took the album off to play something I was more familiar with. Did I ever hear it from the rest of the folks there. Been a Neil Young fan ever since!",1388448000,3,224,3.891304347826087
8584212,5,B00CP4S8JO,"Nice DVD exploring the music that Neil Young himself took as inspiration for his own sonic experiments and compositional excellence. The film points out a lot of connections I was both unaware of and hadn't previously appreciated ( The Shadows, Bert Jansch, Randy Bachman etc), but played side by side this film makes one realize where this pioneering musician himself borrowed - although unlike others, never stole - from, a rich American & British musical tapestry. A good angle for a documentary and one not usually appreciated the man being such a unique composer  in his own right.",1385424000,6,586,4.979591836734694
8584213,5,B00CP4S8JO,This DVD focusses on Neil Young's musical heroes and does a good job of unearthing the artists and bands who have informed his work since the beginning. Includes some great footage and interviews as it trawls through the sounds and genres he has borrowed from while creating his own unique abilities. A very watchable film and thus highly recommended .,1385251200,4,352,4.883333333333334
