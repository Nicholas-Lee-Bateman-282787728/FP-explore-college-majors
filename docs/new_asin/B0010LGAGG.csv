3853997,5,B0010LGAGG,"Amidst a lot of controversy currently that Edward S Curtis romanticized American Indians/ Native Americans and ""posed"" his subjects...he remains the only photographer of this almost totally forgotten original US citizen group  who garnered the acclaim of Presidents et.al. for his staunch support and love of the Native Americans. His love of them shows through in his photographs. Even to the detriment of his family, he pursued his dream of attempting to chronicle Native American lives. I am Native American and feel extremely fortunate to be able to view Edward S Curtis's photographs and am so happy inside that someone took the time and dedication as he did to chronicle lives of our people. God rest his soul and in the words of a Native American blessing: Edward S Curtis: May the Great Spirit watch over you, and may you be at peace. I have several photogravure's and one of which I am extremely proud is a photo of the great Washoe Tribe basket maker Dat So La Li which I share with you here. This is hanging in my Living room. This video is a wonderful tribute to Edward S Curtis and it is true and well worth viewing.",1416441600,4,1129,4.645
3853998,5,B0010LGAGG,"Photos are fantastic, but the narrative is so very informative. I felt I got a 3 for 1 on this, because along with this biography and photograph show, you learned about the other photographers of the time and the political influence these hard working people had to deal with to do their jobs.",1392854400,,293,4.547169811320755
3853999,4,B0010LGAGG,"After studying a bit about Edward Curtis's life and his devotion to photographing Native American people, I watched this brief documentary.  It gave a nice overview, but could not begin to cover everything he did, or how much of an amazing struggle his life's work (his life) was.  Worth watching, but know there is so much more to this story.",1387929600,3,343,4.7
3854000,5,B0010LGAGG,"OUTSTANDING.  While the reactions of Native Americans today differ in their opinions about what was proper to publish about their culture and rituals, there is still deep respect and appreciation for Curtis' work.  Without it, the faces and humanity of Indian people at that poignant time in history would never have been known.",1386374400,2,328,5.169811320754717
3854001,5,B0010LGAGG,"For those who do not know the story behind Curtis' work, this is a must. Good research and beautiful oresentation of photographs.",1376524800,,129,4.909090909090909
3854002,5,B0010LGAGG,"To have known he was a photographer before it wasn't everyone's interest. I am happy that I picked this book for the photos and for the way he went about trying to get everyone else interested in knowing Native American's better and share his life. It's easy to love something when it brings so much joy to your heart. Sadness was also a part of this historical time, but makes it a well-rounded write and I am glad I didn't miss it. Not everyone of the time cared to embrace these amazing human beings.",1376006400,2,503,4.361702127659575
3854003,5,B0010LGAGG,Curtis produced a twenty volume photographic record of Native Americans that was both art and a record of a vanishing people.  This documentary tells the story of his life and how he went about taking these wonderful pictures.  There is also commentary by Native Americans on the work...both positive and highly critical.  This balanced video is well worth seeing.  It is actually streaming on netflix for free as of Feb 2013.  I definitely want to find access to these photos to get a bigger view of Curtis' works.,1362268800,2,515,4.806818181818182
3854004,5,B0010LGAGG,"Without Edward Curtis taking pictures a lot would have been lost about the Indians. I can't imagine living in those times and being an Indian who lived off the land and had strangers coming in killing off their food supply and not to mention killing them off! To bad the invaders of THEIR land couldn't see the good in them and worked with them, not against them. History of these great people, how they lived, died and survived should never be forgotten.",1361577600,2,455,4.560975609756097
3854005,5,B0010LGAGG,"Total awesome, informative, thought provoking, and inspirational! I wish you had it in DVD format, I'd buy it in a heartbeat.",1314921600,4,125,5.0

The narration of the story captivates you and I cannot say enough about the photography.....Oh my - ABSOLUTELY STUNNING.
