8294356,4,B000OTGYBG,"Some fighters who will never move past small shows on the regional MMA scene and obviously lack talent, mixed in with future legends at the early stages of their careers. This will not be UFC level production value obviously, but it is still more than enjoyable and the cost per fight is great.",1401580800,,294,4.566037735849057
8294357,1,B000OTGYBG,"Well first off. This is more street fighting than anything, the fights are terrible. While i was watching it you could see how bad these fighters were! No technique at all, just stand and throw bombs..thats not how you win fights. secondly...the camera view they have if just on the side and looking through the cage, terrible production, and if you pay $5 for this..you get what you paid for...CRAP!",1298937600,,400,4.728571428571429
8294358,4,B000OTGYBG,"Let's just go through the cons first. First of all, the case design is a wreck. It's far too easy to damage the discs with the system they have. Secondly, I really don't like two-sided discs. They're a pain in the rear. While it definitely saves both parties $$$, for quality's sake I really wish they would have done ten discs.

But, if you will notice, I never said anything about the fights in that section. That's because, for actual content, this is an absolutely amazing set. The full fight cards are huge; there are 117 fights in all. Inside those fights, here are the notables that you will receive: Joey Villasenor (former EliteXC title contender), Diego Sanchez (TUF 1 MW winner), Joe Stevenson (TUF 2 WW winner), Jeremy Horn (UFC veteran) vs. Dean Lister (UFC veteran & Abu Dhabi champion) in a Middleweight title fight, Mike Bourke (PRIDE veteran), Mac Danzig (TUF 6 winner), Jeff Curran (WEC veteran), Dan Severn (former UFC champion), & Jason Ireland (PRIDE veteran). The undercards are all amazing as well; very little lay and pray involved. This set will not disappoint you. However, if you do buy it, I would suggest getting a new case for it if possible.",1290816000,3,1172,4.717073170731707
