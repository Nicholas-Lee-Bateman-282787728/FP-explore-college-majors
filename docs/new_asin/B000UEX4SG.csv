2921709,5,B000UEX4SG,"I obtained this movie because Joanna Shimkus, the last wife of Sydney Poitier, starred in it and I was curious about knowing who she was and what was her appeal to Mr. Poitier.  The movie started rather slowly so I almost gave up on it even though Ms. Shimkus is a very strikingly beautiful creature.  It is worth getting this movie just to view the charisma of Ms. Shimkus.  But, the story eventually becomes more active and interesting.  It's about the sexual mores in conflict in 1920's England.  It's quite interesting actually if you can just ""stay with it"" until about the middle of the movie.  Recommended for Ms. Shimkus and the story as it develops slowly.  boland7214@aol",1196035200,8,681,4.720338983050848

8213197,3,B000UEX4SG,"Interesting movie! Film adaptation from the novel by D.H. Lawrence, starring Joanna Shimkus and Franco Nero.
Unfortunately this is not a remastered version,
and it's a full screen 4:3 presentation (only opening titles are ""widescreen"").",1312070400,3,236,5.771428571428571
8213198,3,B000UEX4SG,"Much like Women in Love with the atmosphere of the Midlands of England.

I am happy to have a copy of this.  But, they took a bad print for the DVD.  Or maybe this is the best that is left.  I don't know.  It has lots of signs of wear on the film.

I can deal with it.  A little disappointed, but the film is good.",1264464000,4,314,3.6666666666666665
8213199,2,B000UEX4SG,"This was a film I saw when it was originally released and I was swept away (no pun intended). I have waited patiently for a DVD release but was quite dissapointed in the quality of this print. It looks like a TV recording with awful sound.
  The film has a look and feel that is firmly anchored in the 70's but I don't think most Franco Nero fans will mind. The heroine (Shimkus) is trapped in the stultifying atmosphere of an English parrish house until a chance encounter with a bohemian couple and a gypsy on horseback sets her free.",1204934400,12,536,4.35
8213200,4,B000UEX4SG,"This is an excellent movie, that in its day was somewhat of an ""art house"" film, but is no less impressive now after finally being released in DVD form. This motion picture is filled with beautiful scenes and credible characters, all telling an enduring, timeless story. It is a visual treat and despite its ultimate seriousness, is filled with subtle humor. But judge for yourself.",1201046400,5,382,4.892307692307693
