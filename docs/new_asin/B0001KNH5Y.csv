So it is not really very good for beginners and really doesn't show anything special for more advanced turners.  You can get better video for free on YouTube.",1422230400,,334,4.807017543859649

8013738,1,B0001KNH5Y,"Date released is 2004, but watching it I thought it seemed old. Back said it was filmed in 1985, just remade to DVD in 2004. Very outdated video.",1389571200,,145,4.214285714285714
8013739,5,B0001KNH5Y,"As a newcomer to woodturning I have bought several books and videos to get a feel for the methods involved. Though good, most of them tended towards either too much fine detail or demonstrated too advanced methods with  inadequate detail. I was left a little frustrated, and couldn't easily turn  the information into practical work. This video gave (to me, at least!)the  perfect balance, presented with a friendly style that made me feel I was in  the workshop with him. At the end I felt I could go and use the methods  shown, but, perhaps more importantly, eager to do so. Highly motivating,  informative, and entertaining. I would very much like to meet the man. Are  there any more books and videos by this author?",939168000,20,720,4.712
8013740,5,B0001KNH5Y,"""You don't hear much talk, these days, of the dance there is in participation in any craft.""  So says Del Stubbs in his opening remarks. I have watched this video many times, often simply to share in the  obvious pleasure Del takes in turning and also manages to convey to the  viewer. There is the overture of introduction, the slow movements of  instruction, the melodic movements of demonstration and the sublime moments  such as his turning of a wafer-thin, translucent applewood bowl.  This is a  well designed video presentation. The instructional sections are  interspersed with turning demonstrations so that one does not feel weighed  down with facts. Del covers the whole range of topics required for bowl  turning, tool shapes and uses (including his first tool ground from a piece  of pipe!), sharpening, methods of mounting on the lathe, getting a blank  from a log, thoughts on bowl shapes, adding weight to the lathe to dampen  vibration, converting the drive to a foot operated clutch and, of course,  many example of the turning process including slow action shots that leave  no doubt as to how the tool is cutting. Thanks to Del, and thanks to  Taunton Press for producing this video.",912470400,18,1203,4.91044776119403
