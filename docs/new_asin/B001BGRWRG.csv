3491833,2,B001BGRWRG,"Definitely worth reading the reviews on this one.  ""julia ""bluebird1028"""" & ""feltonfan"" are on the money here.

The material itself takes its place among the greatest variety-comedy shows ever produced.  It's too bad the producers of this set didn't treat it as such.

It most certainly is NOT uncensored - the prior reviewers fleshed that out well.  BUT - there are some very jarring and puzzling edits here.  In several places a performer's line is actually removed (bleeped) - as in lips moving but no sound - which leads one to question what exactly was used as the source material.  There are a few awful edits - David Frye's routine has a particularly rough cut.

This is quite unlike the other DVD revisits to old series.  In those, all episodes of a season are presented in chronological order.  Not even close here.  For example, at the end of episode 1, the Smothers tell us the Beatles will be on the next show.  Great!  Except, that episode is nowhere to be seen (music rights?), as we skip from ""#202"" (season 3, episode 1) to ""#212"" (season 3, episode 10?).  Greeeeattt...

Quality is strange - vertical green sync bars on the left margin sometimes.  Other times arced lines at the corners, as though we were watching on a 1950's TV.  While it is reasonable to expect quality issues with material this old, compared to other DVD sets of the same era (e.g. ""That Girl"") the quality here is quite below average.

For those of us that grew up looking forward to the weekly installment of this show, unfortunately this will be a watch once affair.  I suspect most real fans will be thrilled to see the Brothers, their guests, and the vintage performances (the west coast company of ""Hair"" was particularly enjoyable) but quite disappointed with the final product.

2 stars here.  Shame on Time-Life for pulling the old tapes (or whatever they pulled), bringing in the Smothers Brothers for new comments and producing a product for mass sale that is basically half done.

After watching this disk, it is sadly apparent that, ironically, after 30 years, the Smothers Brothers are still getting screwed by their production company.",1224979200,14,2138,4.784153005464481
3491834,5,B001BGRWRG,"Other reviewers have covered quite well details of the Smothers Brothers TV series as well as this DVD set of the third season, so I won't repeat them here. I will though heartily praise this ground breaking program and say how happy I am that its third season is now available on DVD. I'll also add to the requests for the release of the first two seasons. Caustic and unfettered programs mocking politics and various human foibles are common on television these days but they weren't before the Smother Brothers pioneered such programing. Tom and Dick Smothers didn't just invent a new format, they showed that it could be hilariously funny. If you enjoy politically incorrect humor, please get this set and see how well it can be done.",1223078400,2,738,4.728682170542636
3491835,3,B001BGRWRG,"Have waited so long for this to be released and what a disappointment!
How ironic that the Smothers Brothers who faught with censors are now censoring what they release to us!  I'm glad they came out with this set. But most of the episodes were about 40 minutes. These are NOT the full episodes as aired.  The booklet insert talks about the first David Steinberg sermonette - the controversial one. Then it's mentioned on one of the shows when Tommy apologizes for it....but it's not included here!!  We are given the second, calmer sermonette entitled ""Jonah""(which of course is good).  On one of these episodes, the band comes out in the beginning of the show with the signs naming that night's guests.  They list Leigh French and she only appears for about 2 minutes in a very quick comedy sketch. She's not listed in the menu of the disc as a guest for that show at all. Surely she was in more of that episode than that!  They did leave her in one as the weather girl, so it can't be a rights issue.  She was on 18 of their shows.  6 in 1969 and 6 in 1968.  Why was she cut from this one!?  The menu on each disc lists only a select few guests that they warrant important enough to have included. i.e. big names like Tina Turner, Jim Morrison, Harry Belafonte.  There are other guests (as is shown in each week's introductory band sequence) but some have been cut out! I'd like to be the one to decide what the ""Best Of"" is.  Give me the entire series - whole episodes and if there's someone I don't want to see I am perfectly capable of skipping over it on the DVD.  The folks wanting these are mostly the baby boomers and I remember Biff Rose and Leigh French!  What an outrage that they've been cut out of this set.  There are four discs here and the entire 4th one is devoted to Pat Paulson!  What a waste!  Would much rather have had Pat as he appeared throughout the season in the full episodes and then they could've added in the one hour special as an extra.  The fourth disc should've been used for more episodes.  What they've given us is good, but I'm very disappointed in the way these were released.",1222646400,69,2116,4.324873096446701
3491836,3,B001BGRWRG,"Don't get me wrong. I'm glad they came out with this set. The bonus features are great. But, all I found was one uncut episode(at least I think it was) which clocked in at about 51 minutes. Other episodes were about 41 minutes. One show was 39 minutes! Even Tommy Smothers admits on the audio introduction that these shows are edited. Remember the ""This Is Tom Jones"" DVDs? So tell me. What is the difference between ""uncensored"",""uncut"", and ""unedited""?",1222473600,14,454,4.7594936708860756
3491837,4,B001BGRWRG,"Yes, this *is* the Smothers Brothers, and yes it is wonderful.

But not the complete season; only 11 shows.

Yes, the scenes are original and uncensored.

But the shows are not complete! Some scenes have been omitted.

As great as this is - and it is great - you should know that you are neither buying a complete season, nor complete episodes.",1222473600,11,344,4.5
3491838,4,B001BGRWRG,"I got this video at the recommendation of my father in law, who came to age at the time the Smothers Bros Show was on the air. Some dull moments, but it contained the Smothers' popular bits from their albums and the music acts took me back in time. The reading material warned that the show would seem downright tame today compared to 1969 and they were right; there was nothing that seemed controversial, which was mildly disappointing.",1221868800,,437,4.615384615384615
3491839,4,B001BGRWRG,"I wasn't even born when this show was originally on CBS. But I have been a fan of the Smothers Brothers for a long time, starting back in 1988 when they had a short-lived revival of their variety show. Having just purchased this 4-disc set (the Amazon.com information incorrectly lists it as having 3 discs), I have to say that I am really enjoying the show.

However, I have to wonder about the claims of all 11 episodes being uncut. I have only watched the first disc so far and am already noticing what I think are some cuts from the original broadcast versions. It would appear that these episodes are taken from a ""Best Of"" series that Entertainment Television did back in 1992. Each episode (so far) has an introduction and epilogue by Tom and Dick Smothers. In one of the episodes there are scenes shown during the epilogue from the 'Daily News' segment that were not in the episode I just watched.

I also have to wonder about the run time for each episode. If you take out the time for the 1992 intro and epilogue, you end up with about 38 minutes for most of the episodes. That seems pretty short for an hour-long variety show in 1968. Most hour-long shows from this time period were around 50 minutes. That would mean over 10 minutes cut from each episode.

There are some other editing issues that I believe have to do with the original CBS censors, but I'm not sure and can find no information online to confirm this. For instance, in one episode David Frye is doing some of his stand-up routine. It is pretty obvious that it has been cut. The segment is only 45 seconds long. And at one point there is a severe jump cut from an impersonation of William F. Buckley, Jr. to him taking his final bow with a hat that has suddenly appeared in his hands. But, as I say, I believe that this was the CBS censors' doing and not the producers of the DVD. Maybe someone else who has watched this set could let us know more about the validity of the 'uncut' claims.

Even with the possible cuts, this is still a VERY good set of DVDs. It is crammed full of extras and the show itself is funny. I'm quite impressed with the wide range of guest stars the Smothers Brothers brought on their show. I would recommend this set to anyone who is a fan of the Smothers Brothers or variety shows in general.",1221782400,33,2299,4.351981351981352
3491840,5,B001BGRWRG,"As everyone is asking, ""Where are The Best of The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour Seasons 1 and 2?"" I spoke directly to a Smothers Brothers rep and here's what I found out. There have been delays in producing the best of The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour dvd sets due to reasons unknown. I would guess that the reasons have something to do with getting all the approvals needed by the numerous guests on the shows, that is the cause of delay. Even this Season 3 is a few weeks behind schedule.

When I asked about certain musical groups appearing on this Season 3, I was happily told that The Who will not be on Season 3, but will be appearing on Season 2, which is right now in the making! I was so happy to hear that they are currently working on Season 2! This Season 2 will contain the famous performance by The Who, when Keith Moon used too many explosives and blew out poor Pete Townsend's eardrum!

Even though all 3 Seasons are being released backwards, starting with Season 3, I am still totally thrilled! The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour always had the best performers on their shows, along with great musical performances by the best groups of the time, not to mention all the political buttons they pushed for the politicians here in America!

It's certainly wonderful to hear that they are making the ""Best Of"" all three Seasons of The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour, even if they are being released starting with this last Season 3! Getting to see these shows again is certainly a rare treat!

The information I received on The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour Season 3 dvd set from Time Life, states that the following is included:
This 4 dvd set includes 11 star packed episodes from Season 3, that were personally chosen by Tom and Dick Smothers. These 11 shows (there were 26 shows made in Season 3, 26 in Season 2 and 20 in Season 1) are shown as they were  originally intended, uncut and complete. When these shows aired in 1968 and 1969, they had sketches and performances that were cut out by the network censors at CBS. These shows will now be seen complete, as intended back in the 60's, before the censors cut them up. Tom and Dick Smothers will comment with an introduction before each show on this set also.

The guest list includes some of the better known stars: George Harrison, Harry Belafonte (Harry sings a very rare ""Don't Stop the Carnival"" as footage of the police brutality and riots at the Chicago Democratic Convention plays behind him- this was originally cut by network censors, and is for the first time released on this set), Bob Newhart, Steve Martin, George Carlin, The Doors, Ray Charles, Jackie Mason, Cass Elliot, Jonathan Winters, Joan Baez, David Steinberg, Ike and Tina Turner, Judy Collins and more.

Also included is the infamous ""Pat Paulsen for President"" television special, which includes newly uncovered, a never been seen appearance by Robert F. Kennedy. This was originally cut from the broadcast because of the Senator's assassination, that was being mourned by our nation. This is a very rare clip that shows the Senator's humorous side. This also includes bonus footage when Pat Paulsen takes a trip to the White House.

Included also, is a rare interview which was originally intended to air on the first show of this 3rd Season with baby doctor, Dr. Benjamin Spock. It was cut by network censors due to Dr. Spock's anti war activist stance. There are also many extra's that include never before seen rehearsal footage and also included is the 1968 press conference following the abrupt termination of The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour by CBS. The Smothers Brothers had just signed their 4th Season contract, when CBS terminated them. Back then in 1969, everyone knew that this sudden cancellation of the show was due to the Smothers Brothers outspoken political humour and views. What we didn't know is how many sketches and performances were cut by CBS censors, which we now get to see for the first time ever!  This set is going to be a real treat with 11 uncut shows and lots of bonus material, and I can't wait to see the ""Best of"" Seasons 1 and 2, even if they are being released backwards!

UPDATE July 2009- After waiting a little over a full year, THE SMOTHERS BROTHERS COMEDY HOUR:THE BEST OF SEASON 2 is being released by Time-Life on October 20, 2009!! You can pre-order on Amazon now!",1218672000,85,4356,4.674934725848564
3491841,5,B001BGRWRG,"THE SMOTHERS BROTHERS COMEDY HOUR is perhaps the one hit series ever cancelled for political reasons.  Though political conservatives strive to see leftists lurking behind every bush shown on TV, the brothers Smothers wore their political beliefs on their sleeves.  Though Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert are leftists who mute their beliefs in political satire, Tom and Dick forty years ago provided a showcase for some of the most politically charged content in the history of television.  The show was also brilliant on nearly every level.  The acts were genuinely funny.  The musical performances were among the most stunning ever seen on television, with famous performances by Cream and the Who.  And as impressive a list of performers of all kinds as any show -- including Ed Sullivan -- could boast.

The show was one of the most widely watched on television.  I would have to double check on this, but THE SMOTHERS BROTHERS COMEDY HOUR might well have been the highest rated series in the history of television to be cancelled.  Why?  They stepped on too many toes; offended too many sensibilities.  In a decade dominated by racial issues, they featured a skit about the first interracial wedding in the south, the punchline -- after the couple has exchanged their vows -- being the minister asking not for the ring but a rope.

Though the political content was integral to the show, there is no denying that it was also brilliant.  Tom and Dick were a truly great act.  Dick was a near perfect straight man, with Tom one of the funniest gag men ever.  His act of being almost inconceivably stupid never grew tiring.  Show regular Pat Paulsen became famous during this season for running for president.  His campaign speeches were utterly brilliant.  And the guests!  Though not all will be included in this ""best of"" set, Season Three included a veritable who's who, including the Beatles, Nancy Sinatra, Steve Allen, Carl Reiner, the Everly Brothers, Glen Campbell, Rowan and Martin, the Jefferson Airplane, Donovan, the First Edition (with Kenny Rogers), the Doors, Steppenwolf, Ray Charles, Liberace, Victor Borge, Judy Collins, Jonathan Winters, the Righteous Brothers, Peter Paul and Mary, the aforementioned Mort Sahl, Jackie Mason, Joan Baez, and Ike and Tina Turner.  A very young Steve Martin also appeared in several episodes while a very young Jennifer Warnes was a regular musical performer.

I love that DVDs are resurrecting so many great shows from the past.  And this is without question one of the most popular and successful shows in the history of television.  Unfortunately we've not seen a single show since this one -- with the exception of THE DAILY SHOW and Stephen Colbert's show -- to put forward a progressive political position.  The cancellation of such an enormously successful show showed that prime time was not going to tolerate progressive politics.  This set is essential not merely because it represents a more hopeful time, but because it contains so much absolute brilliance.  It was ""must see"" TV before it was invented.",1217980800,23,3068,5.013833992094861

Their guests also included, among others, Bob Newhart, David Frye whose depiction of Richard Nixon was devistatingly funny,
Joan Baez, Ray Charles and folksinger Judy Collins.
These videos are a treat for everyone, if you were or were not there to watch them.  And if you did watch them during the 60's you will see much that you weren't allowed to see by CBS.

3491896,4,B001BGRWRG,"I have watched all of this compilation but the last DVD, repeatedly in some cases. The quality of the music & picture is quite good- not like a brand-new show, but excellent quality considering it's age.

The humor is left-wing, late 1960's derision, still touched w/ the idealism which hadn't yet faded into pragmatic realization about humanity's true nature, and was quite biting at the time. Numerous jibes at then-President-Elect Nixon & other sideways jokes about the people in the news apparently didn't go over well w/ the powers-that-be st their network. No surprise, after viewing, that the brothers were fired (their show was not cancelled due to low ratings, as is commonly mistaken) from CBS. I am betting CBS regrets the decision to this day, given the success of such shows as ""All in the Family"" only a couple of short years later. Interestingly, the copy of a 1968 letter from then-President Lyndon Johnson to the duo is included in the DVD cover, expressing LBJ's somewhat-surprising thoughts that a public figure in America should not be exempt from a comedian's humor or even contempt.

This is a variety program which should have been on the air for at least another good season or two- that is the feeling one is left with after viewing this series. I can say without hesitation that our culture is sorely remiss for no longer having shows of this kind on the air. And, no, late-night TV doesn't fill that void. To my tastes, it was far superior to similar programs for the day. The Smothers Brothers themselves were no slouches as comedians, singers & musicians. I enjoyed every one of their performances, which included lovely folk music akin to Peter, Paul & Mary or The Kingston Trio (no surprise, since they were all close in real life). Tommy, especially, is a great acoustic guitarist.

The standout episodes for myself (and my mother, who has similar tastes) were the ones w/ Harry Belafonte & a solo Cass Elliot in the same show (both phenomenal singers & in their prime here), & the one w/ George Carlin & The Doors. Harry Belafonte's beautiful version of Gordon Lightfoot's ""Song for a Winter's Night"" & standout ""Carnival"" (originally banned by CBS for it's controversial background video of the disastrous 1968 Democratic National Convention) enliven the DVD. A trio's version w/ the brothers & Belafonte of ""I Wish I Knew How it Felt to Be Free"" was a upbeat, touching, well-done & on-target song of the turbulent times. Elliot's terrific alto range & breath control was shown off in her single ""California Earthquake"", a tale of the hippie hope for a resurrection the lost Atlantis, as well as a funny rendition of ""Dream a Little Dream of Me"". She was a shining star that burned out far too early, but the talent which has never gotten it's full recognition is here for us to enjoy forever. Also educational & enjoyable was Joan Baez' performance, which was done at the time when her then-husband was about to go to prison for evading the Vietnam War draft, which was discussed live on the show.

George Carlin hadn't quite veered away from ""mainstream"" comedy of the earlier 60's yet, but you could see he was well on his way to becoming the future icon he was to be. A monologue of his own & a part in a humorous voice-and-music sketch about diminishing newspaper readership give a glimpse of the irreverent & genius comic we were yet to see. The Doors performed two songs, ""Wild Child"" & ""Touch Me"", & both were good. The episode w/ Bob Newhart was also decent, & watching his monologue gave me new appreciation for a comedian whose work I'd previously only seen as an actor in sitcoms. Ike & Tina Turner also did a good performance here, though for an even better glimpse of them, their own concert done in Holland from the early 70's is a better relic from those times. I would purchase this set again, even knowing a few of the episodes didn't feature people I cared for. The exemplary shows made up for the not-so-good. For those who watched & loved these when they originally aired, I imagine they may have an even higher esteem for the show than I do.

I can't even conceive of a time when one could view such quality programming for free, either as a part of a live studio audience or on broadcast TV. As I was not alive yet for the original viewings, I am grateful to The Smothers Brothers for making these episodes available on DVD. If you are a fan of the late 60's, you will appreciate the music, humor & decor/fashions of the time.",1284768000,,4483,4.648171500630517

Tom and Dick's skilled uses of their voices are much better than I remembered.  I Particularly enjoyed Jennifer Warren's rendition of Santa Monica Pier..outstanding!

A special thank you to Tom for his courage to take a stand on what he believed to be right ( I did/do too.)He opened the eyes of many of us who were too timid to take action against what came to be known a white collar crime.

So season 3 of the show is something I really wanted to see again.  In the first episode on the disc, the brothers sign off saying the Beatles will be on next week.  The dvd then skips two months ahead.  No Beatles.  No Hey Jude.  There is a brief chat with George Harrison in one episode, but that ain't the same.  The dvd is fun, and my pre-teen kids have enjoyed watching it with me (they have Donovan singing ""I Love My Shirt"" on an old cd of ""kid's music"" I made for them, and here they get to seem him sing it in person).  Tina Turner always rocks, the brother's faux arguments are still funny, but there are just a few episodes, and without the Beatles, this package is simply a rip-off.",1261958400,6,1016,4.195876288659794

3491923,4,B001BGRWRG,"Not sure what is missing, maybe some clips and some which are overlong could be shortened.  The added bonus features are quite good and the prolog introductions by the brothers are insightive.  I would also have liked to hear more singing by Tom & Dick and less of the guests.  Perhaps the Season 1 & 2 DVD's will be better.",1257638400,2,324,4.366666666666666
3491924,5,B001BGRWRG,I am so excited to finally be able to share the Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour with my grandchildren.  This DVD has brought our family hours of belly laughs together.  The seller and Amazon did an outstanding job quickly delivering the item in perfect condition exactly as advertized.,1255564800,2,283,5.0
3491925,4,B001BGRWRG,"Tom and Dick Smothers were two innovative brothers who challenged the CBS censors during a timultuous time in American history. Their hour variety show spanned three seasons when the brothers were not cancelled, but fired for offending too many viewers. However, their comedy talents were undeniable and during their short run on the air, they gave opportunities to famous names like Rob Reiner, Steve Martin, and struggling performers like Tina Turner and George Carlin.

This collection features plenty of great moments, and commentary by the brothers. They have handpicked which episodes they wanted to be included in the Season 3 set, and they have done a good job of presenting a cohesive group of episodes. Some of the later ones reference jokes from the first few, which makes use feel like we are in on the gag. The music is a slice of life from the 60s, sometimes with well-known songs and other times with b-sides from famous performers.

My peeve is not with the shows themselves. My peeve is with the lack of completeness of the DVD. Tom and Dick express concern that their show has not aged well, and that audiences would not be receptive to seeing all of the episodes of season 3. Shouldn't the audiences be the ones to decide? Obviously there is interest if these sets are selling 40 years after the show originally aired. Also, it is quite obvious that some of the skits are cut. It would have been nice to have an uncensored look at the work of the Smothers Brothers; after all, they are very funny and very talented performers.

Of course, the briefness of this collection only leaves one wanting more. And now, here comes Season 2...",1253232000,6,1652,4.7491289198606275
3491926,5,B001BGRWRG,"The political movement of the late 60's was fractuous. Dissent was everywhere and the Smothers Brothers brought us together for one fantastic hour each week. This DVD brings back a lot of memories of a youth not quite squandered. I hope that more of these episodes are released. If you want to see how television could make a difference then watch these episodes and enjoy the commentary.

  Wasn't a hippie then,but, could be today.

3491927,5,B001BGRWRG,I had forgotten how long ago these were on TV.  My kids were seeing them for the first time as they were toddlers when the shows were on.  they loved getting a look at the comedy and acts from the 60s.  They also commented that it was amazing that in forty years the political jokes were still right on the mark and not much has changed.,1243641600,3,337,4.075757575757576

However, it is not the complete season, as some episodes are missing, i.e. the one with Spanky and Our Gang and George Gobel.  Viewing the shows in todays context, one wonders what was so controversial at the time.  One of the bonus features is coverage of the Pat Paulsen Presidential Campaign which is priceless.  He was one of the great deadpan comedians of all time.  Had it been the complete season, I would have given it 5 stars.  If you are a Smothers Brothers fan, add it to your collection.",1241740800,3,575,4.524271844660194
3491930,5,B001BGRWRG,"Season three of the Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour was not only an interesting time for the hit variety show, it was a pivotal moment for television in general.  The Smothers Brothers were the first to use comedy as a political daggar, and they did so effectively and regularly.

The brothers would lose their berth at CBS at the end of this season, not because of low ratings, but because their ongoing battle with the network would reach the boiling point.  The shows may seem tame by today's standards, but there were plenty of raised eyebrows in 1969, including the eyebrows at the White House.

I watched the shows when they first aired as a 13-year-old, and seeing them again resurrected all of the headline producing controversy of my youth.  You have to forgive the brothers if they seem a bit preachy in these shows, but by this time they had a clear message:  the war in Vietnam was a bad idea, and it was time to call our government's bluff.

Watch and enjoy.  No one is doing anything like it today.",1235952000,3,1010,4.541436464088398

3491945,4,B001BGRWRG,"It would certainly be ironic and arguably hypocritical for the Smothers Brothers to censor their own programs, but I do not think that is the case here.  Granted, the episodes are shorter than they should be and not all of the guest stars appear long enough to justify being on the show.  But I think that the explanation comes from the fact that these were the dozen episodes that were rebroadcast on E!  Take into account that there are more commercials today and the shows would have to be edited down.  Then throw into the mix the introductions and conclusions with Tom and Dick, plus sundry interview clips with key figures, and you lose another healthy chunk of each show.  Consequently, I do not think there was any censorship; these episodes were edited down before being rebroadcast.  That begs the question as to why they could not go back and just show the complete episodes regarldess of what was aired on E!, but they did not.

I also have to assume that E! gets saddled with the responsibility for only picking a half dozen of the season three episodes and looking only at episodes from season three, as well as the credit for rebroadcasting them in the first place (or in showing them for the first time, as would be the case with the infamous episode that broke CBS's back).  I never saw any of these episodes when they first aired because my father was stationed in Japan.  But the last show I watched before we left the U.S. was ""The Smothers Brothers Comedy"" hour and I still have my autographed pictures of Tom and Dick from belonging to their fan club (although I did have to find a replacement for my ""MOM ALWAYS LIKED YOU BEST"" button).  I got to meet Tom Smothers once and was able to tell him how important the Smothers Brothers were to making me who I am today.  I had all of their records by the time I was in the 6th grade and I can clearly trace my love of satire and vocal harmony back to those records.

For the most part the music is superior to the comedy on these episodes, with performances by the Doors, Mama Cass Elliott, Donovan, Dion, Ray Charles, Judy Collins, the Ike & Tin Turner Review, Joan Baez, as well as Tom and Dick doing their lovely version of ""They Call the Wind Maria.""  The best comedy comes from the guests, from Bob Newhart and Jonathan Winters to Geroge Carlin and David Steinberg.  The banter between the brothers was always better than their sketch comedy, but they were certainly.  The politics is represented by such pieces as ""Don't Stop the Carnival"" by Harry Belafonte set to footage of the riots at the 1968 Democratic National Convention, David Frye and others doing ""A Fable for Our Time"" with medieval versions of politicians, and Mason Wiliams' poem on ""The Censor.""  Those certainly stand out the most, mainly because each one of them is another giant leap towards the precipice the brothers Smothers were heading for in that third and final season.

The fourth disc is devoted entirely to the late&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pat-Paulsen/dp/B001MZR4HO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pat Paulsen</a>, which is ironic given that he was on so rarely during the third season, but totally understandably given how important he was to the career of the Smothers Brothers (Paulsen was writing material for them before they made it to television).  There is the ""Pat Paulsen for President"" mocumentary that aired as Show 205 and a host of other pieces, from his appearance at the 1968 Democratic National Convention to an entire stand-up act at a comedy club in Anchorage, Alaska, from 1992.  They also uncovered raw footage of Bobby Kennedy talking to both Paulsen and Tom Smothers about Pat's candidacy.  Throughout the discs the bonus features usually find complete interviews with performers and writers from the show, from which excerpts were culled for the E! broadcasts as well as some assorted gems, such as a complete Jackie Mason routine from the show's dress rehearsal.

Yes, it would be nice to have all of the episodes from all three seasons of ""The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour,"" but apparently that is not going to happen.  I am still trying to figure out why we cannot get all of their albums out on CD (and also why they would do ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Aesop-s-Fables-The-Smothers-Brothers-Way/dp/B000N9H4GG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Aesop's Fables The Smothers Brothers Way</a>"" before ""The Smothers Brothers at the Purple Onion"" or ""Mom Always Liked You Best"").  It would be nice to think that down the road we might have companion sets with the best of the first two seasons of the show, but I have the feeling that this is all we are going to get and while it is a proverbial case of being better than nothing.",1231113600,4,4787,4.897277227722772

But this show only re-inforced my liberal base, and I thank Tom & Dick for that.  40 years later I feel the same sense of satisfaction as I watch Smothered on PBS.

It was a time when freedom of speech was obvious, you knew what you were getting and you could choose to watch and listen or turn to one of the other TWO channels.  This is back when the overt assaults on our constitutional rights in the name of National Security was just starting to take shape.

The last season of the Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour is an essential piece in every social studies teacher's repertoire.  Anyone who has ever looked at ""V for Vendetta"" or ""Watchmen"" or ""1984"" as contemporary social commentaries should get this DVD. It is a legacy for our children.  It provides one media lens through which our country's past can be observed and enjoyed, debated and integrated, laughed at and mourned for, it was the 60's.

Nostalgically, when it comes to The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour, April 4, 1969 marked a change toward an era where the individual's freedom of choice was replaced by the rise of the politically correct.  Pat Paulsen summed it up this way; ""The Bill of Rights says nothing about Freedom of Hearing, This, of course, takes a lot of the fun out of Freedom of Speech"".

Fortunately local educational channels united into PBS that November.  I digress.  IF you desire a challenge to your more secure and fickle 100+ channels of dribble and predetermined people's choice programming GET THIS DVD! IF you want to see REAL classic comedy including: George Carlin, Mason Williams, Mel Torme, and Don Knotts, GET THIS DVD! IF you want to see early footage of new comers to the music scene like: Simon and Garfunkel, Buffalo Springfield, Jefferson Airplane, etc. GET THIS DVD! If you're really adventurous show it to your friends.

Tommy and Dick,
I'd offer bubbles to the Champagne Lady and Polka to the Chmielewski Family Funtime Band if it would bring this kind of comedy back. I digress. Thanks again for the memories.",1401321600,3,2132,4.776566757493188
