8030807,5,B0002QTBG6,"Suspenseful romantic drama with Erika Marozsan, Joachim Krol and Stefano Dionisi. A woman inbetween of three men, a song with a dangerous fascination, a love in a murderous time. The movie is like the song, both beautiful and sad.",1135987200,2,230,4.923076923076923
8030808,5,B0002QTBG6,"The Chicago Tribune called this ""Marvelous...a throw back to classics like Casablanca"".  I concur.  Though I never thought I would compare a movie to Casablanca, this movie is a rival in excellence.  It has an awsome attention to detail, and an inspired use of resonance.  Details in the beginning resonate throughout the picture.  I was deeply affected by the ending, and I did not want to leave the theatre.  No movie I have watched in recent times has packed such a punch.  I saw it today, and I will be thinking of it for some time to come I am sure.",1117584000,10,554,4.425742574257426
8030809,5,B0002QTBG6,"Gloomy Sunday will haunt you with unanswered questions.  There is the beauty of a powerful love between three friends set against the ugliness and horror of war and greed. Pay close attention, every detail is important.  I wish it was on dvd here in the states.",1115683200,7,261,4.6521739130434785
8030810,5,B0002QTBG6,"Loved this film. But I especially liked the way that all the pieces fit together so nicely. In American films, the audience has to have everything spelled out so clearly for viewers to ""get it.""

Notice when Hans is rebuffed in the restaurant when he wants to play the piano. Lazslo tells him that there are two things that customers aren't allowed to do. Then see what happens later on.

Ilona sings only for herself, but...

These are subtle touches which requires ones full attention to appreciate.

Hint. Pay attention to what Ilona says in the bathtub with Lazslo. If you ""get it,"" then this will resolve a concern about the film's resolution. Lazy American filmgoers would/will need this explained to them.",1103328000,10,712,4.811475409836065
8030811,5,B0002QTBG6,"Gloomy Sunday has been playing in the cinema in NZ now for 4 years and still draws an audience. The movie has a similar theme to The Pianist and Schindlers List but balances the darkness of the era with a love story, while not pulling any punches. The movie is emotionally powerful and leaves you thinking about a number of issues well after the film ends.

Highly recommended.",1099699200,13,377,4.544117647058823
8030812,5,B0002QTBG6,"This movie

had been shown on European TV channels several times.

A beautiful woman between two men, beautiful music in a restaurant setting. A very european movie, if you like Europe you will like this movie.",1096243200,8,210,4.805555555555555
8030813,4,B0002QTBG6,The scenery and actress in the movie is beautful. They story is great. The song in the movie 'Gloomy Sunday' is great too.,1094256000,4,122,4.3478260869565215
