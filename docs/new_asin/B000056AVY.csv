1396272,4,B000056AVY,"Simon Schama is surely one of the more interesting and most intelligent commentators on the history of Britain, and his stories of death, destruction and outrageous suffering and heroics are guaranteed to hold the attention. He provides an interesting perspective on his country, analyzing the brutalization of one group after another,including the Jews.
It is ironic that Schama, who refers to himself in the film as ""a nice Jewish boy,"" would have been one of the victims in another era, but here he manages to communicate an intense fondness for  his country, a fondness born of his thorough knowledge  of the ways in which Britain has shaped and has been shaped by the many peoples who have settled there. This is a fascinating film.",976406400,3,737,4.935483870967742

1396277,3,B000056AVY,"The collection is good in its focus on what is happening internally in a period, but is very poor on the causes of the transitions between periods. It throws a spotlight on successive periods but doesn't show how or why the changes between them took place. Also, like most, it does not do a good job of showing what early England was like, which is necessary to show how each succesive phase in history changed what went before.",1373587200,4,428,4.5

1396279,5,B000056AVY,"Excellent documentary that takes you from the neolithic times to just after WWII. Very informative and watchable documentary. There were few if any dramatizations that I can recall, but it was presented in a way that kept my attention and was enjoyable. The only criticism I have is that they really didn't talk about WWI or WWII, really any of the more modern era wars. It is understandable why they did not get into those, the series would never end there is just too much material, but I'd have liked to see a little summery of England;s role in some of the modern wars.",1363564800,,573,4.519230769230769

1396281,2,B000056AVY,"After seeing part of the first episode on the BBC while deployed in Kuwait, I had high hopes for this series, but as the British would say in typically understated fashion, those hopes were unfulfilled. I won't dwell on the presentation or the script, which were frankly appalling. For me, it was the content itself which rankled. The series simply doesn't cover British history very well. Although the series includes many fascinating tidbits, particularly regarding the intriques of the succession to the British monarchy, it is disjointed and unfocused. It even stumbles in covering the history of the monarchy, by completely ommitting the War of the Roses.

Mr. Schama misses the mark in two ways which are intertwined. My first objection is with Mr. Schama's choices of which subjects to cover and which to leave out. A couple of examples will suffice. In the coverage of the reign of Elizabeth I, one might expect some detailed coverage of the Spanish Armada and William Shakespeare, right? There is barely a mention of the Armada, and none of Shakespeare. Similarly, during the times of the American and French revolutions, and the Napoleanic wars, one might expect to hear the juicy details of the battles of Trafalgar and Waterloo. Each receives only a single sentence in the narrative with no details whatsoever of these battles which were pivital to the history of Britain (the ostensible subject of this series). Instead, Mr. Schama focuses an entire hour on English Romanticism, dedicating about a quarter of that to the tragic story of one Mary Wollstonecraft. Admittedly, I had never heard of her, and the story Mr. Schama presents of her is indeed intriguing, but I'm sure Mr. Schama himself must certainly agree that her contribution to the pageant of British history was insignificant.

Along with the failure to separate the important stories from the sidenotes, the series - to my American mind - fails to properly target the audience. The series was produced as a joint venture of the BBC and the Discovery Channel. As such, one might expect that the American audience might be considered in addition to the British. It was not. Consequently, many subjects that might be taken ""as read"" for those educated in British schools and living in British society will simply go over the heads of average Americans. For example, at the end of the episode covering the reign of William of Orange, a brief mention of the Battle of the Boyne is made. In his annoyingly sardonic fashion Mr. Schama tells us that points will not be awarded for telling who won, saying (rightly) that nobody did. Then as the trailing credits begin to roll, we are treated to an audio clip of the Reverend Ian Paisley spouting his usual vitriol - no doubt at one of the annual troublemaking sessions held by the loyalists at the site of this famous battle. Having lived in Britain during the height of ""the troubles,"" and having been treated quite frequently during that time to both audio and video of Mr. Paisley's rantings, I was able to take Mr. Schama's point. Sadly though, the average American will surely be left scratching her head, wondering what the guy yelling bile into a megaphone has to do with an 18th century British ruler, and (hopefully) wondering what's missing in her education that left her unable to ""get the joke.""

I can't say that this series is a total loss, though. The coverage of the life and death of Thomas Becket was fascinating, as was the final episode comparing and contrasting the lives of Winston Churchill and George Orwell. The coverage of feminism during the reign of Victoria was also interesting, although Mr. Schama then failed to follow through on the lives and works of the British Sufferagettes. On these strengths, I've given the series a two-star rating, rather than the lowest.

Give this one a miss if you're looking for a well-integrated overview of British history. If you're looking for artfully entertaining vignettes that are marginally related to British history, and have $160 burning a hole in your pocket, then by all means...",1347667200,,4074,4.9085631349782295

1396283,4,B000056AVY,"Anything by Simon Schama is worth buying.  He is such a wonderful historian and makes History come to life, just like you were there. We loved learning all about Britain and it's amazing history.  We have watched it twice and probably will watch it again, all five DVD's.  It was so entertaining and after watching felt like I had had a college course in Britain!!  Also get Schama' ""Power of Art""!  FABULOUS!!!!",1314662400,,412,4.666666666666667
1396284,5,B000056AVY,"It is true that this DVD suffers from comparison to other, more recent, treatments, but my needs were for the content, not the presentation. This has given me an entertaining, thoughtful high level overview of the chronology of English history (from the English viewpoint) in an easily digestible treatment that I found satisfying. Best of all, I didn't feel like I was ""taking a course"" at all, and each year, usually around the Holidays or during a winter blizzard, I sit in front of the fire and watch the whole thing over a day or two. Just what I was looking for, but everyone is different.",1292025600,2,595,4.622641509433962
1396285,4,B000056AVY,"This is a different type of history, with more emphasis on the individuals concerned.  The author narrates the story, in a somewhat sardonic manner, but with an emphasis on the people involved, not just the dates and places.  Some of the players are well-known, but he also brings up some of the more obscure players, who never-the-less influenced history.

We enjoyed it.  Each part is about 58 minutes long, so they fit rather nicely into a TV schedule.",1284854400,,455,4.794871794871795
1396286,5,B000056AVY,"If you like British History, or would like to know more British History, this DVD set is an excellent source to go to. It is presented by an excellent, well-known historian who goes to the various places where historical figures lived and where historical events took place. He doesn't just tell you about Thomas Beckett's murder in Canterbury Cathedral, he takes you there to the very spot where the Archbishop was murdered. He takes you to Henry VIII's palace at Hampton Court and to the archeological site at Skara Brae. Schama really brings life to these subjects. As a Professor of History at Columbia, this DVD set is essentially a survey course in British History.
Histories of Britain tend to focus too much on power struggles between the Crown and Parliament. Schama presents these stories, but includes the experiences of the common, everyday folk as well. He gives the viewer perspective not only on what it was like to be William the Conquerer or Queen Victoria, but also what it was lie to be a soldier at the Battle of Hastings or a common laborer trying to make his way in the 19th century. He shows the stories of those fed by the silver spoon and of those in the poorest of conditions. The series probably weighs a little more heavily toward the monarchs and nobles, but its the fact that commoners are not forgotten that puts this above the rest, in my opinion.
I found Schama informative, witty, and generally interesting in his story-telling. The animal-themed imagery (trust me, I'm not talking about a fox playing Robin Hood) is more interesting to me than actors whom I know don't quite look like the historical figures they are trying to portray.
I highly recommend this DVD set. The first four discs (12 hour-long episodes) are particularly informative. The fifth disc (three episodes) did not strike a chord with me, nevertheless I give this five stars because of those first four discs. I have both a bachelor's and master's degree in history and I found myself learning from this presentation.",1280966400,2,2021,4.793696275071634
1396287,1,B000056AVY,Once again the History Channel disappoints with the lack of closed captioning on documentary DVDs.  Closed captioning is not especially difficult on dramatic productions but failing to close caption a narrated ducumentary is ridiculous and simply unforgivable.

1396290,5,B000056AVY,"God bless Simon Schama!

Look at my other reviews:  I'm a curmudgeon who dumps on virtually everything that passes his way.

But I have nary a slight for this masterful set of DVDs.  Entertaining, well-written, thoroughly absorbing.  And you find yourself not minding the nerdy intrusions of the almost spastic Schama throughout.

I've watched it over and over again.  Probably five times by this point.  Though the first installment on the neolithic guys is my least favorite, the rest of it is impressively gripping.

I plan on watching it many more times.  For me, the thing was as perfect as you could get on 6 disks.  But others might have these gripes:

1.  Schama assumes you already have a basic understanding of British history.  If you don't, many of his observations will seem cryptic or elliptical.

2.  Famous episodes and characters in British history, such as the Wars of the Roses, or Henry IV, can be given short shrift depending on Schama's judgment of how important they were for later events and institutions.",1245196800,,1029,4.861271676300578
1396291,5,B000056AVY,"This is a sweeping overwhelming history of Britain.  It is not THE history of Britain but one by Simon Schama, an eclectic historian if there ever was one.  Schama covers British history from the beginning to being the bastion of liberty of rights that we know it as today.  Perfect?  Definitely not but better than most countries.  I was drawn up in the history of Britain and was mesmerized by most of it.  There are the extraordinary stories that no one can beat.  William the Conqueror, Henry II, Eleanor of Aquitaine, Henry the VIII, Queen Elizabeth etc. right up to William Churchill are personalities no one can beat but the whole history is exciting. Guess I was able to get it before it was discontinued.",1243814400,,713,4.656

Simon Schama's speech is so literate it can go straight to be printed in a book.  Also contains some very interesting insights.

I like the episode about Elizabeth I and Mary Queen of Scots.  I found it scary like a horror movie.

By the way, you can download the subtitles online.",1234656000,,487,4.4772727272727275
1396298,4,B000056AVY,"An interesting film about the British history, not a timeline retrospective, but build around some key events, each detailed and presented as one of 15 series.

Two obvious drawbacks from my point of view:
1. Information about pre-roman history is very scarce. It would be interesting to know, who actually Britains were before invaded in turn by Romans, by Anglo-Saxons and by Normans. It is as if real history starts with Roman invasion.
2. I am not a native speaker and from time to time there happen to be words, difficult to comprehend by listening. It would be great to have switchable subtitles. Leave alone people, who have impaired hearing. It would be very nice if they could have access to such a nice film.

1396304,5,B000056AVY,"This 2008 repackaging of 2001's ""A History of Britain"", featuring Simon Schama as author and presenter, is not the standard history of Great Britain.  Schama is no slave to historical convention and his 15-episode retelling explores British history from a slightly different point of view.

Schama's famous BBC series traces British history from Roman Britain through the death of Winston Churchill in 1965.  His focus is not timeline oriented; many prominent players in British history rate no more than passing mention.  Even the iconic Churchill has to share the last episode with Eric Blair, better known by his literary name of George Orwell.  Instead, Schama seeks to identify the slow, difficult steps by which Britain became a constitutional monarchy with individual freedoms and the rule of law.  Those steps are found in Roman Britain, in the endless dynastic and religious wars that defined the powers of the monarchy and parliament, in the disaster of the Black Death, and in the long political and military struggles to build a united British nation and then a British empire.

The episodes feature important archeological sites, castles, ruined abbeys, and other locations where important events took place. We meet the prominent personalities of the narrative through pictures, paintings, sculptures, tomb representations, and, rarely, reenactment.  Schama narrates in person, stalking through ruins, landscapes and museums while delivering his rather blunt colloquial commentary.

""A History of Britain"" is not for everyone.  The thematic presentation may be hard to follow for those not already familiar with British history.  Those wedded to a romantic vision of a storied past may find Schama's blunt disection of power politics to be off-setting.  Schama's twitchy physical presence may be distracting for some viewers.

On the other hand, this telling of British history is engaging, realistic, and thought-provoking in getting at the heart of what it means to be British.  The story is as much Scottish, Irish, and Welsh as English in coverage.  Prominent personalities are shown in their full rounded humanity. The presention itself is polished work.  ""A History of Britain"" is therefore highly recommended to fans of British history looking for a fresh angle.",1229212800,52,2283,5.406779661016949

I would recommend this to anyone, who is interested in British History.
Even when you go back hundreds of years ago, you can see how much of that History, matches what is happening today.

1396312,5,B000056AVY,"Simon Schama's A History of Britain presents the epic history of the British Isles in a lively, engaging and beautiful manner.  I have a passion for history, and have been plenty of documentaries.  A good documentary gives both a thorough recounting of events and sheds new light onto them.  A great one can introduce ideas that one had not previously thought of, but delight as well as inform, and Simon Schama's work definitely falls into the latter category.

An art historian, Simon Schama includes and explains many beautiful works of art, explaining how they helped tell us of Great Britain's past.  It also includes plenty of panoramic views of the gorgeous English countryside, which one could make a whole seperate documentary out of.  As other reviewers have noted, Schama avoids a dry recounting of events, and prevents it in an amusing fashion that can almost make one laugh out loud.  By the time one is finished with the fifteen installments, one almost regrets it is over.

The episodes frequently revolve around the stories of great leaders and thinkers, and how they changed Great Britain for better or worse.  Some lesser-known figures are given a much-deserved highlight.  King Henry I, whose imposition of a common law upon the realm would inspire the barons to rebel against his gutless, blackmailing heir King John.  King Edward Longshanks, whose utterly ruthless wars against Wales, Scotland and Ireland inspired patriotic rhetoric centuries before the age of nationalism.  Finally, there is Robert ""Cock Robin"" Walpole, who envisioned and helped to bring about a modern Britain built around money, rather than violent sectarian fervor and the destructive wars it helped to bring about.",1203033600,,1709,5.1521739130434785

As for what is what in this noteworthy showcasing of times past on northern Europe's second greatest island, I found this a comprehensive, interesting, broad-based coverage of a subject that has engrossed me for most of my life. Beginning in the pre-historic past, continuing up to near present times, and giving us the expected as well as the atypical version of the who, what, when, why, and how from England's dramatic history, Schama is throughout a likeably unintimidating presenter who makes time to discuss the impact Britain's history has had not only on the British but on their neighbors in the outer world. Schama charmingly interjects with bold comparisons and statements now and again that jolt a viewer's attention in a ""Did he truly just say that?"" fashion.

""At his funeral the mortal remains of the corpulent William the Conqueror exploded in his casket..."")

Even the most boring elements of history ""come alive"" through a story book narrative style. If history could be taught like this, one would end up having far more history honors students. Besides the terrific narrative, this series also has excellent production values being a joint effort of the BBC and The History Channel. The other good thing about this series is that it focuses on the personalities rather than attempting to present history in the usual boring chronological fashion.

In other hands, this could be dry material, but Scharma's presentation includes facts, interpretation, and some drama that never develops into melodrama.  I've enjoyed this series even on the parts of history that I was familar with.  College students looking to learn more than the Western Civ survey, and adults who have forgotten the sequence of events and details will gain insight and be entertained by this series.",1189987200,,537,5.294117647058823

1396320,5,B000056AVY,"Schama's BBC documentary is nothing less than a masterpiece of the genre. Emotionally moving and containing a strong narrative tone, the work is a grand visual sweep from the earliest days of pre-history England to the 20th century. There is little to be improved. The video is gorgeous - sometimes lush - the narrative is as fascinating as it is informative, and even Schama's own physical presence in the scenes adds a level of humanity to the events of a sometime distant past. But it is Schama's own verbal discourse and his mastery of English prose, a hallmark of all his works, which really distinguishes this work from others. The storyline is so strong that it could easily stand on its own without video accompaniment, but coupling this verbal story with the BBC's ability to capture the beauty of the British landscape within the moving frame makes the piece a cornucopia of insights and delights. This is a work so well done, so moving, so fascinating, that it begs to be watched over and over. I'm sure that most people who own the set have just done that. I certainly have.

The work is centered around 15 primary events of British history, with the sections named just closely enough that if one has a basic sense of British history the topics can be guessed (Beginnings, Conquest, Dynasty, Nations, King Death, Burning Convictions, The Body of the Queen, The British Wars, Revolutions, Britannia Incorporated, The Wrong Empire, Forces of Nature, Victoria and her Sisters, Empire of Good Intentions, The Two Winstons). By limiting the scope of the series to these specific areas of focus, the length remains manageable, but the linkage from event to event is sufficient to propel us through the whole period. Of course, it would be foolish for us to think that all, or even the great majority, of critical events in British history can be covered: this would take a series easily ten times in length. But the selection of topics provides a panoramic view of the most salient events for an introductory history such as this.

There are moments of profound emotional weight in parts of this work. One example is the episode entitled ""The Body of the Queen,"" which examines the lives and relationship of Elizabeth and Mary in Tudor England. As destiny unfolds, we see in Mary a sense of her personal loss and a terrible illness that is with her until death. In Elizabeth, we see an ascent to the throne, but nevertheless loss in never taking a husband, and the continuing lament over her role in the fate of Mary. It's more emotionally powerful than most things you'll ever see in a documentary.

Another aspect of Schama's work that one may find enjoyable is Schama's ability to step outside ""the frame"" and take well-known historical events and critique them in new and powerful ways, often simply with a single sentence of dispassionate analysis. It's an approach sometimes too rare in parochial histories, but it certainly finds its way into the performance here. There is also little attempt to explain away things that are not yet understood. Some of the quotations from early runic scripts in episode one, for example, are as enigmatic as they are ancient, but that doesn't stop Schama from quoting them with a touch of humor.  In fact, if one watches closely, the understated and ironic sense of humor is never far from the discourse. This makes us think about what further unspoken thoughts Schama would like to add, but cannot due to time constraints.

It would be a terrible loss if Schama did not turn his skills, along with the BBC, in developing a similar series covering the history of France. His book, ""Citizens,"" already covers the French Revolution in his witty, knowledgeable style. Now to extend and merge that content with the development of France would make an incredibly interesting series, and one that might connect well with this British-focused work. But at any rate, this work is truly an outstanding endeavor, and if you like history, documentaries, or both, get it while it is still available.

The DVD-set does not stick to a strict chronological approach to history.  The narrator, Simon Schama, a university professor in history and author of several books, enlivens the traditional approach to British history by looking at the key personalities and cultural influences that have defined the history of Britain and its former possessions.  After the initial viewing, many viewers will feel compelled to screen one or another of the 15 episodes from time to time due to the usually high quality of these episodes.

I do wish more time would have been spent on the early history, but it is well balanced. 5 DVD's, 3 episodes in each makes this a very long series and well worth the money.

Simon Shama does an excellent job narrating this series, and can tell he is genuinely knowledgeable, and not just some paid actor. I think he is/was a professor at Columbia University, so he really does know his stuff. This collection goes over the complete history, so if you are looking for a specific period or location, look elsewhere. what he does cover he does well.

However, the series does a good job of offering pertinant information over what people find facisnating about English history - Edward III, Henry VIII, and Elizabeth I.  I especially enjoyed the juxposition of the story between Elizabeth and Mary Queen of Scots.

Quite frankly, I think they have missed the point. There must be empathy with people to have understanding of them, and instead I felt cynicism. Others, such as Ken Burns, have found how to show who people were, and yet leave you feeling you understood them, whatever their faults might have been. This series left me feeling agitated and actually revolted by how parts were presented. I, unfortunately, would have to say that I do not recommend it.",1152403200,12,922,4.494047619047619
1396328,5,B000056AVY,"One of the most interesting and intelligent documentaries I have seen in years.  Simon Schama possesses a love and understanding of British history that is clearly evident when viewing this work.  He also has an understanding of his audience, neatly walking that fine line between popular history and scholarly snobbery.  Assuming the viewer has a basic level of knowledge on the subject while at the same time not turning off those who may hold a much higher level of education on the topic.  His narrative is almost poetic and in a way the entire history is told as a series of ironies which facilitates a broader retention of the material.

Schama uses phrases such as, ""He was a real Plantagenet powerhouse"" when describing the look and stature of Henry II and he uses imagery that unlike most history channel documentaries is not repetitive and anachronistic (this one was actually made by the BBC2 but shown on the History Channel, which explains a lot about the higher than usual quality)

 I have had a History of England course and I wish this documentary would have been around back then as it truly would have served as great study material prior to examinations.

If there is one flaw in my opinion it is that Schama attempts to make each of his chapters of history fit into a certain context and more often than not it works but on some occasions it fails.

All in all this is a great documentary and I highly recommend it.",1140480000,9,1436,4.644268774703558

There are many, many movies and series available around the world that are not available here in the US. For example, The African Queen and the original and hilarious version of Bedazzled (with Peter Cook and Dudley Moore) (available at Amazon.co.uk). This leads, necessarily, to a discussion of region-free DVD players, which a person in the US (region 1) would need in order to play DVDs from around the world. There are plenty of inexpensive region-free players that also convert ""on the fly"" PAL (system used in Britain, for example) to NTSC (the system used in the US), thus you can plug-and-play discs from around the world with a player like and watch them on your TV. I have one and use it to watch the BBC (Region 2) version of Simon Schama's History of Britain. (Make sure you get a region-free player that converts PAL to NTSC, on the fly, that is, inside the machine). Once you have a machine and are looking for titles from around the world to watch on it, I suggest you browse and search at [...] You'll find a trove of extremely useful information on release dates and movies now available from here and around the world.

As ""dooby"" points out, the TV-ratio (4:3) (A&E/The History Channel US version) crops much of the expansive scenery preserved in the History of Britain set that is available from the BBC (Amazon.co.uk).

1396332,1,B000056AVY,"I was hoping that I had found a definitive, unbiased and honest history of Britain here. Unfortunately, this series is no more enlightening than listening to a dogmatic university prof. where you hear the same-old slant over and over again.

That is to be expected when enrolling in a uni course but this is telivsion - and it should be presented better.

Aside from this, the man is just plain wrong for TV himself as he is visually nauseating to watch for so many hours. Every time he speaks he circulates his shoulders (one forward and one back)and thrusts his chin toward the camera. Maybe this is a pysical deformity and I should be more sensitive. But I am sorry, for the money it costs to buy this thing I have to say it should be more watchable; it can make it really difficult to concentrate on what is being said. This visual annoyance is not at all helped by the high class tone and smugness of his speech in which his sarcastic delivery has the effect of talking down to the viewers and not, as perhaps he had imagined, win them over to his point of view without question.

Regretfully, low points for style are not made up for with outstanding substance. It's a good general refresher of English history so long as you are smart enough to listen for the missing facts. Some of my main criticisms include his presenting myth as honest history in the case of the whereabouts and final resting place of English King Harold's body after his defeat by Norman King William The Conqueror in 1066. He also refers to this period as ""early British history."" Just saying that reveals his historical ineptitude and/or basic arrogant attitude to the  earlier Celtic and Celtic-Romano British history. On that note he does even mention the word 'Celtic' once when he briefly covers that enormous period of history. Every thing is either Iron Age this or Ion Age that - even Queen Boudica is an Iron Age Queen - We are fairly certain she didn't speak English so I guess she could only have spoken 'Iron Age' as her first language. Of course, the words 'Anglo' and 'Saxon' are used over and over again to describe the next era of history following the Celtic and Celtic-Roman ages.

For anyone who misses the point here, answer this question: Why doesn't he (and other revisionist historians) simply refer to a Saxon king as a Dark-Age king or Dark Age Britain instead of Saxon Britain?",1115078400,14,2383,4.597647058823529

This documentary series is very well made and deserves all the 5 star ratings it get's at this site. However, no one seems to mention that this DVD set released by A&E/The History Channel is actually a cropped version, modified to fit a standard TV screen. This series was shot by the BBC in widescreen, as much to take advantage of the new widescreen medium as to project the panoramic grandeur of British history.

Both the Region 2 (UK & Europe) and Region 4 (Australia & New Zealand) versions are all in the original 1.85:1 widescreen (enhanced for widescreen TV). Only in America are we afforded the singular privilege of watching this show in a crappy Pan-&-Scan format courtesy of A&E/The History Channel.

The best buy right now would be to get the UK edition sold under the BBC's own label. Not only does it have 6 discs (1 disc of special features) compared to 5 in the American version, it is also much cheaper. You can get it through Amazon UK (at a 43% discount as of this date).

1396336,5,B000056AVY,"Sweeping from the dawn of civilization to the 20th century, A HISTORY OF BRITAIN: THE COMPLETE COLLECTION discards timelines and tiresome lineages for a lively look at the personalities and events that shaped the nation.

Disc 1

Beginnings

(circa 3100 BC - 1000 AD)

From Neolithic villages like Skara Brae to the arrival of the Romans and the Viking invasions of the 8th century,  A HISTORY OF BRITAIN opens with a whirlwind look at the forces that defined life in England in the years before the Battle of Hastings.

Conquest!

(circa 1000 - 1087)

The path of Western Civilization changed in nine hours. Without William the Conqueror's victory in 1066, Britqain might well have been a Scandinavian province. But the Battle of Hastings made Britain part of an Anglo-Norman empire that, in time, overshadowed even the kings of France.

Dynasty

(circa 1087 - 1216)

The great Norman empire tore itself apart over questions of who should rule. Out of this bloody struggle emerged a new dynasty, one that produced three of the most famous and misunderstood kings in British history: Henry II, Richard I, and John.

Biographies:

Simon Schama

King Edward the Confessor

Disc 2

Nations

(circa 1216 - 1348)

In the 13th century, the people of Britain found their voice: proud, defiant, and nationalistic. Its language derived not from idealism, but as a response to the subjugation in the campaigns of Edward I to extend his authority over Wales, Scotland, and Ireland.

King Death

(1348 - 1500)

The plague arrived in England in 1348 and killed over 1 million people - a third of the population - in just over a decade. But it also paved the way for a series of radical reforms that saw Britain stripped of its feudal remnants and ready to face the future by 1500.

Burning Convictions

(circa 1500 - 1558)

Under Henry VIII, loyalty to one's faith was treason and loyalty to one's king was heresy. Henry's break with the Church marked the beginning of an extraordinary period that saw a nation largely at peace with its Catholic soul bribed, tortured, and cajoled into accepting Protestantism.

Biographies:

Robert the Bruce

William Wallace

Disc 3

The Body of the Queen

(1558 - 1603)

Elizabeth I led a Protestant nation to greatness in a hostile, Catholic world, all the while deflecting intense pressure to marry and conceive an heir. Her success stands in marked contrast to the fate of her cousin, Mary, Queen of Scots.

The British Wars

(1603 - 1649)

Charles I ascended to the throne in 1625 with a firm belief in the Divine Right of Kings. This almost immediately put him at odds with the Parliament, and their struggle soon expanded to every corner of the British Isles.

Revolutions

(1649 - 1689)

England emerged from 50 years of civil wars a kingless republic led by Oliver Cromwell, yet the fighting was far from over. Cromwell sent troops to Scotland and Ireland, and after his death and the restoration of the monarchy, a brief period of peace came to an end during the reign of James II.

Biographies:

Mary Stuart, Queen of Scots

Queen Elizabeth I

Disc 4

Britannia Incorporated

(circa 1690 - circa 1750)

England in the 1690s saw the victors of the ""Glorious Revolution"" celebrating the dawn of a new era under William III, while in Scotland the Jacobites still supported the deposed King James II. The new Britain was built upon money and commerce, not God.

The Wrong Empire

(circa 1750 - circa 1800)

With political stability and commercial prosperity at home, Britain turned its sights outward. The Wrong Empire travels from the back streets of revolutionary Boston to the slums of Calcutta to chronicle the astonishing transformation that followed. It's a story of exploration and daring - but also of exploitation and conflict.

Forces of Nature

(circa 1780 - circa 1832)

Led by the radical intellectuals of the ""romantic generation,"" Britain experienced a flowering of political discourse in the late 18th century, based on an appreciation of nature and the common man. But while similar forces led to revolution in France, England avoided that bloody fate.

Biographies:

The Jacobites

King George III

Disc 5

Victoria and Her Sisters

(1830 - circa 1910)

In 1837, the 18-year-old Queen Victoria ascended to the throne in the midst of a radical transformation driven by technology and industrialization. The young queen paved the way for a generation of women to assume prominent roles in every area of British society.

Empire of Good Intentions

(circa 1830 - circa 1925)

As the ruler of the largest empire the world had ever seen, Britain hoped to deliver ""civilization"" while saving its subjects from famine and disease. But from Ireland to India, this noble purpose dissolved ina morass of blood, grief and broken promises.

The Two Winstons

(20th century)

A HISTORY OF BRITAIN: THE COMPLETE COLLECTION concludes with a comparison of two of the most influential 20th century Britons - George Orwell and Winston Churchill. Schama's compelling analysis of their lives and legacies illuminates fundamental questions surrounding the role of history in society.

1396337,4,B000056AVY,"As a historian, I find that it can become altogether too easy to rest contentedly in one's view of history, however cobbled together over time it may be.

I was pleased to see this well-told series and to consider Simon Schama's point of view. At first I said a few ""Nonsenses!"" and ""Not Quites!"" but then I settled down and realized that he was making me think about it all over again, and occasionally shifting my opinion.

It is always a good thing to expose yourself to a cogent discourse, whether you agree with all the opinions or not. His arguments are reasonable when he makes them and well worth hearing.

This presentation has a very powerful sense of touching the flow of events from the past, of how they affect us personally to this day. Simon Schama shifts history out of a 'frozen moment in time' and makes it move.

I do agree with some of the other reviews that mention annoyance at the endless nature-channel footage, particularly in the first few DVDs. I would have been far more interested in more images of petroglyphs, remnants of clothing and tools, more archeological digs, and other directly related material instead of falcons, foxes, and hazy footage of people singing used as a backdrop to Schama's lecture. There were definitely long stretches of what seemed to me to be wasted film.

Yet, I will be purchasing this set, and will watch it again. It helps me remember a flow of events outside my personal historical focus.",1107216000,6,1450,4.670588235294118
1396338,5,B000056AVY,I enjoyed this so much on the History Channel that I had to add it to my collection.  It is worth every penny and I highly recommend this.

1396339,4,B000056AVY,"To be perfectly honest - I do not really know what to do with Schama's History of Britain: Is it a piece of sheer genius, or is it just mediocre? I am happy to have borrowed it from our libray and seen it, but I am not so sure it would have been worth the almost eighty dollars to buy it.

Most episodes seem to suffer from time-constraint; since the topic is so wide it is difficult to weigh the need of detail with the need of a general overview. If you know a lot of English history, you will find few revelations. Schama does not include much new research. If you do not know a lot you might find it quite beautifully filmed and with a passable overview.

However, the final episode, about Winston Churchill and George Orwell is absolutely wonderful! It is a kind of summary of the entire series: they were both products of a special society that had been formed over the previous thousands of years. Without knowing British history you cannot expect to understand neither Churchill nor Orwell. Schama also, with obvious pride, describes how both of these men, diametrically opposite in political views, could work inside the system; British society can accept anyone that wants to work for the betterment of Britain.

One last word: Don't expect to see much about  Ireland,  Wales, and  Scotland, Schama's focus is mainly on England. This is a shame, since  all these countries  have played such vital roles in the making of Britain.",1101600000,7,1438,4.6117647058823525

Although, British royalty is a huge slice of the British history, I was looking for something which would be more of a socio-political history.  I was looking for the societal and cultural development of England in addition to the development of the royal family.

This set is like being in a lecture room with Schama (a remarkable storyteller) as the teacher using slides and pictures of old monuments, paintings, and actual places.  If you are expecting an entertainment(ish) storytelling, then you must find something else.  This set would be equally productive on an audio tape.

Mr. Schama's narrative of British history is erudite and graceful.  The appeal for me as an American is that this truly is ""British"" history without being overwhelmingly ""Anglo-centric.""  The Irish, Scots, Welsh and the rest of the world have a hand in the affairs of the realm.

One of the other qualities that I find appealing in his account is Mr. Schama's careful use of irony, which is often appropriate but never heavy-handed.

So much of his presentation seems to be ""on the fringe"" and not central to the mainstream of the basic history of Britain.  Also, as others have pointed out, Schama seems intent on presenting the ""gore"" of battles, tragedies, etc.  He also seems fascinated with sex and the eccentric too much.  We just felt that we were not getting the fullness of the basic story of Britain's history.  It was very disappointing, and we would not recommend it.",1088121600,23,639,4.7727272727272725

I suppose that the history would have been OK if it weren't so scanty.  This was very much a quick overview, which often left out key facts that would be vital to understanding the motivation for actions in later parts of the series.
I commend the idea behind creating a good series in the history of Britain, but I can only suggest that this one be avoided at all costs.",1086566400,11,607,4.45945945945946
1396347,5,B000056AVY,"A History of Britain is a wonderful but pricey treat for any fan of British history.  Some of the negative reviews complain that it is too superficial.  How, I would ask, can you give a COMPLETE history of a country that spans 5,000 years?  The collection consists of 15 hour-long documentaries starting from Britain's earliest past, five-thousand years ago.  We see the still-standing stone communities where the ancient British dwelled.
Of course, Simon Schama must be selective in what he chooses to discuss.  Each episode has a theme.  Although all the major points of British history are touched upon, Schama will focus on the most interesting bits of each event - how and why they happened and what they meant.  He tries to give us a sense of reasons behind historical events and not just dates and places.  My favorite episode deals with Henry II - arguably England's greatest and most under-appreciated monarch.  We see his troubles with Thomas a Beckett.  Schama re-creates, in vivid detail, what the ""Murder in the Cathedral"" was like: Beckett was not a plaster saint, but a street-wise tough kid from the wrong side of the docks who fearlessly faced down his murderers.
Visually, the series shows some re-enactments with actors.  There are many voice-over readings of historical documents.  Schama is the only featured performer.  He takes you to the various places and narrates in a very distinctive, clipped manner of speaking.  Ultimately, it is the shots of the timeless Britain that are the most effective - the hills, the meadows, and especially the sea.  These are the bits that have remained the same and convey the greatest feeling of history.
I can't imagine anybody not being fascinated by this program.  They are very re-watchable.  Having examined them, you will feel a much deeper understanding of British history - and indeed world history.  Perhaps no other country has a story as fascinating, as rich, or as varied as Britain's.  Watch this and you will know why.",1080172800,28,1991,4.960725075528701

Some monarchs are overdone by Mr. Schama while others, such as Richard the Lionhearted, are merely glanced over and brushed aside. Some aren't even mentioned at all such as Richard III or the current House of Windsor and its members, both past and present. Mr. Shama presents the history with an aire of objectivity and the conviction that his presentation is the last word, in fact the only word, that describes the History of Britain when in fact it is merely his own subjective interpretation. No other scholars or historians are quoted or interviewed by Mr. Schama. I guess who needs them when you already have the greatest expert doing the narration.",1075680000,8,753,4.890625

Simon Schama is obviously knowledgeable and put a lot of work into this presentation; I did gain value from watching it.  However, I found the tone of the presentation salacious (akin to British gossip rags), tedious at points, unecessarily gory (do we really need to know that a nefarious nobleman reportedly died from a hot poker up his bum?), a bit choppy in the editing and somewhat hard to follow chronologically.  More frequent use of maps would have been helpful for those who live outside England and are thus not familiar with British geography.  The best produced and most coherent part was the segment on Henry II and Eleanor of Aquitane.

But few bring it into focus, make it so accessible, and cut through the fat, so to speak, to give you a clean, logical, common sense approach to History of England 101 Crash Course as Simon Schama does.  Each episode is well-written, fast paced and thoughtfully crafted, with marvellous location work to support his tromp through the corridors of time.  He discards dates as the primary input and goes to the movers and shakers, makes you see the Kings and King makers with eyes that are fresh and vital.

WHAT I DON'T LIKE:
Why do we have to have that dramatic music and the slow-motion falcons, peacocks etc?  All that spoon-fed symbolism.  I think that re-enactments are unecessary too.  Plus they add so much to the budget.  I get all excited when I find out new documentaries are coming on the HISTORY channel only to have them all tricked up with blood running down the screen or some fire super-imposed over Hitler's face.  That's the chasm between most documenatries you see on The History channel as opposed to PBS.  I think every documentary film-maker could take a tip from KEN BURNS and let the events, paintings, photographs, period music, and interviews speak for themselves.
Of course, having said that, I highly recommend this DVD set.  SEE IT!",1071100800,2,918,4.877419354838709
1396353,4,B000056AVY,"...but pretty darned good!
Really, I do think this is quite entertaining, but a couple things are bothersome about this series.
First on the list is the cheesy dramatizations.  They talk about thousands of men in a bloody battle; what you see (a lot of!) is about 30 guys shouting and falling in slow motion.
Another oddity is the different qualities of the footage. Now it's video, now it's stock footage, now it's film, now it's video. It may be artistic, but it sometimes looks random; there are lots of shots which really don't look like they were done for this production.
Finally, in a huge sweeping project like this, of course there's going to be some picking and choosing.  But why spend 40 minutes talking about Thomas Beckett when there was so much more going on at the time?
Having said all this, it's still worthwhile - I'm just nitpicking.  Seems, though, that with such a monumental project they could have gone all the way and done it right.",1068854400,10,957,4.617647058823529
1396354,4,B000056AVY,"About the program:
I understand that there is, of course, no archival film footage of medieval England, so the visual aspect of these programs had to be created from nothing, but some of the choices are questionable. Yes, we get a lots of landscape pictures (sped up Koyaanisqatsi-style so we can see all the clouds go zooming by, over and over again), but we also get closeups of hawks flying, wolves fighting, etc--images that just don't fit with the content we hear.
About the DVD:
There are neither captions nor subtitles. This is unacceptable, especially for educational material.
There are no extras. The box has to list chapter selection and interactive menus to cover up its lack of bonus materials. The only actual extra is some biographical text screens on historical figures. This sounds better than it is. The first disc, containing the first three episodes, sports but one biography--hardly enough when many important figures are featured in the first three installments.
I might find this lack of extras forgivable (the series itself is quite well-done afterall, despite my annoyance with the visuals), except that the British version of this title has a whole 'nother disc filled with bonus material.

Just as an example, I had always heard a very one-sided view of Cromwell, with the result that I thought he was an evil fanatic. However, Schama brings him to life as a three-dimensional man with faults but who had a great vision of a better life for the common man.

It was just not for me, science please. After watching this series, I wish they had DVD's a few years ago!
As soon as I saw the first episode, I went out, took the risk and bought the set. Fantastic. Divided into nice bite size pieces, Simon Schama takes us through the years, actually giving me an understanding and perspective on what happened so long ago, in an entertaining and informative style. Somehow he seems to get huge amounts of information, without you even realising it. I began to understand Britain's role defining parts of world history, for right or wrong.
Boy can he tell a tale and keep you intrigued, it's hard for you not to want to stick the next DVD in, save for not wanting to get through it too soon. But then you do and rapidly get back to the beginning, watching it all again.
Simon has his own style of narrative delivery, twitching and jerking his way when on screen. Most amusing but you can't not be endeared to him and be in awe of his knowledge. Respect.

His prose is florid in the extreme and as a screen presence I'm sorry to say I found him terribly annoying. His melodramtic delivery is so full of gulping pauses and overwraught phrasing it's maddening. Since the bulk of the series covers a period well before photography we are subjected to animal imagery ad nausim. When Schama tells us Eleanor of Aquitaine spoon fed her feelings to her children, we see a bird regurgitating into the mouths of its young.

The upside of this is that series like this one are made.  Simon Schama gives us what I suppose could be best described as a ""Whistle Stop Tour"" through the events and people who wrote the history of England, Britain and consequently the world in the past 1000 years.  Presented in a sometimes irreverent and always entertaining way, Schama takes the dusty old ornaments of history down from the mantelpiece and gives them a good scrubbing.  Long dead Monarchs and everyday people seem less distant, their motives more comprehensible, the man truly has a gift.
In Britain, the BBC are often the subject of worry or doubts about it's future survival much less viability, with people looking back on a time when BBC was a byword for quality and lamenting a perceived decline in standards, but as long as she continues to produce this standard of programme auntie's health will never be a problem.",1042416000,19,1138,4.790816326530612

1396364,5,B000056AVY,"A must have for any teacher of AP European History.  Perfect for ""After-School Theater"" sessions.  This series is nearly all you'll need to highlight and review most of the events of British history which are crucial in the AP European History curriculum.

Undoubtedly, this very modern series was produced with an adult, British audience in mind, as Schama's (at times) over-dramatic use of metaphor often flies over the heads of my 14 and 15 year old students.  But generally, they have no problem following the basic storylines which Schama has laid out.  Most seem to rather enjoy the presentation - especially those who ""get"" Schama's subtle humor.

Overall, the series is informative, entertaining, and told from a very human perspective.  For much of the series, Schama is narrating from the very places where the events took place.  Add to this a good amount of historical reenactment, and you get a very different style from Ken Burns - fascinating and relevant in its own right.

Most noteworthy for AP European History use are the following episodes:

Disc II:
""King Death"" - the chapter on the 1348 outbreak of Plague in England.
""Burning Convictions"" - the Henrican and Edwardian Reformations.

Disc III:
""The Body of the Queen"" - the story of Elizabeth I and Mary, Queen of Scots
""The British Wars"" - covering the reign of Charles I and the 17th century civil wars.
""Revolutions"" - from Oliver Cromwell through the Glorious Revolution.

Overall, this series is a very worthwhile purchase - one of the best DVD sets I've seen.  Definitely the most complete set on British history.  Worth every haypenny!",1041638400,12,1616,4.95910780669145
1396365,4,B000056AVY,"This review covers Schama's History I and II.  I think the division is somewhat arbitrary.
Simon Schama's series is honest, in that it does not purport to be *the* history of Britain.  *A* History of Britain suggests, that this is a selective history - Schama omits major periods, events and personalities, such as Danelaw, the War of the Roses, Richard III and Thomas More.  There has been revisionist opinion about Shakespearian villains like MacBeth and Richard III, and I should like to have heard Schama's take on Shakespearian history as a reflection of popular perception or as pandering to received Elizabethan Court History.
Being selective is also being subjective, and Schama's History is certainly subjective.  One of the treats here is listening to an erudite scholar opine on those he considers to be his epic's heroes and villians.  In fact, I find Schama's ""subjective"" History to be a delightful complement to that of another ""erudite scholar"".  Kenneth Clark's monumental Civilization series, is subtitled, ""A Personal View"".  Those who have seen both find, that where Schama is rumpled and quirky, Clark is dapper and urbane; where Schama is wry and colloquial, Clark is lyrical and eloquent.  Despite these superficial differences, I suspect that Schama is an admirer of Kenneth Clark and that he modelled his History after Clark's Civilization.

Rather Simon Schama tells us stories about the people, struggles, causes, battles, and motivations of the people who shaped one of the most interesting countries and empires.

Two of the three parts in the series are completed and ran on the History Channel.  The first part goes thru Henry VIII and covers stories of some of the storied names:  Romans, Vikings, Saxons, Normans, Alfred the Great, William the Conqueror, John and the Magna Carta, the Edwards, the Henrys, the War of the Roses, the Hundred Years War among many others. Its great for dwelling on WHY and HOW did something happen rather than the WHAT.  Why were the Normans able to conquer England and why did William the Conqueror try?

The second part covers Queen Elizabeth up to Queen Victoria.  The stories Simon Schama particular focus on include Queen Elizabeth vs Queen Mary, the Stuarts vs Cromwell, Parliament, and William of Orange, the English vs the Scots, the French imperialists vs the British imperialists, and the American Revolutionaries vs Parliament.  A particularly interesting story covers the American Revolution from the British point of view.  Another covers how democracy developed in England bit by bit and struggle after struggle.  Why did it develop in England and not other places?

People can identify with historical names as people with real stories more than dates and events and Simon Schama uses this with great success in making history come alive in this excellent series.",1010275200,11,1630,5.063670411985019

1396370,4,B000056AVY,"I enjoyed this series immensely. Because of the vast period of time the series covers Mr. Schama is forced to brush over many events and individuals, but I don't believe that it suffers because of it.
I suppose one can quibble with the fact that he never mentions Sir Thomas Moore, breezes past the Hundred Years War, ignores Richard III, his brother Edward IV, and gives Mary and Elizabeth just a cursory look. Yet I never found the series to suffer because of it.
 Schama is telling the story of the evolution of the island of Britain into what we now call England. He looks at critical times and events that played such a major role in that evoution, such as the Reformation,the conflict between Henry II and Beckett and the Black Death to name just a few. It's an ambitious undertaking and I believe that Mr. Schama accomplishes the task with style.
As far as a documentaries go its reminds me of the productions from the seventies. Only a minmual amount of recreations using actors and a heavy amount of narration while we view cathedrals, crops in the fields,works of art and of course Mr. Schama. The impressive thing is I never felt my attention waver. I was engrossed by all six parts and I plan on watching them again one day soon.  Mr. Schama is a witty writer who enertains while he instructs and lectures. He's never dry and he does a nice job of balancing his history between the political and socio/economic schools of thought. Though I really didn't learn anything new from his survey of Britain I was entertained and challenged by his perspective. And that's what history is all about. Not just learning facts and dates, but constantly striving for a new perspective and understanding on events that have occured long ago or just last week. It's a good series and I recommend it to the seasoned history buff or the newcomer who's just getting his/her feet wet. Enjoy.",987724800,5,1884,4.637724550898204

Yes, A History of Britain is definitely a good overview and introduction to British history.  But it is strong in breadth, not in depth.  It also ends abruptly, and offers no coherent theory on how Britain has evolved and why.
I was extremely satisfied with certain elements of the video.  Schama's depiction of the inside of a previously Catholic church in England, and of what it might have looked like in England's catholic period, is extraordinary.  This is beyond a doubt the best use of computer graphics for historical purposes that I have ever seen.
I will also say that his brief overview of the War of the Roses is an easy-to-understand introduction to a complex period.
But ending where Schama did (an extremely brief talk on the persecution of Catholics after Mary), I was left unfulfilled.  I hope another historian will take up the cause of bringing British history to the television screen.  It definitely could use another try!",984096000,,1048,4.826815642458101

A thousand fabulous locations and silently 'dramatised' footage of events bring this history of Britain into visual context, yet it is Schama's chatty, polemic style of narrative which give this series its slightly 'revisionist' kick (Thomas Becket is described as a 'cockney', Eleanor of Aquitaine and Henry II are said to have 'fancied' each other.)
The history of the British Isles has sort of been 'done', and as a former history student myself, I knew it would take something pretty special to make this history 'exciting' and 'new' again. Schama's 'History of Britain' succeeds where so many similar series have failed; it throws a delightful and exciting new light upon a history we THOUGHT we all knew.

Like his later film on art, Schama's works are at first sight a delight just to watch, the filming is that good, atmospheric, often grand, moody; always appropriate-- as is the accompanying music. The music just moves with the film so well-- drawn out medieval bag pipes(?), looong oboe notes of impending doom, then up and down the scale into quite frightening bits-- time to run for the hills! Snippets of songs of many eras, dances, religious music. That beautiful high-note voice in the theme. Perfect. It all adds so much thickness to the film, and entertainment. I know about Black Death, have a dozen books on it. But during the episode on it, I was aghast and on edge, although I knew very well what happened next. But the music and film work were perfect. The dark, damp hills and bare trees; the man dying alone of plague, on dirty straw in a dirty dark hut, covered with buboes, spitting blood, while a welsh actor recited a contemporary poem about the ravages of plague. Sounds melodramatic, but it honestly isn't. We go back to Schama, the anchor, and move along in the tale.

Now, the filming: the film's makers, camera work, are geniuses. There is a lovely sense of place, quite solid, of Britain, beautiful and awful, and I've been there. The actors, or reenactors, are perfect (they don't speak on camera), and an array of British stars with wonderful voices read letters, quotes, documents and supposed speeches. ( You know, like the Paston letters and stuff )

Then, there's the narration, which is quite good. No talking down, just Schama sharing his ideas, views, knowledge. A few off-key phrases, but its very simon-schama-- he's always quite genuine and down-to-earth, and of course, the history is wonderful. And I like the History he chose to tell. At some point, he and his team had to pick and choose from 1000+ years. No long in-depth episode on Henry VIII and his wives ( one of my favorite subjects, and first I was upset ), but enough information about his reign, and the right information about it, to show where we (britain) were heading. I think Schama provides the right information throughout, so that this particular story of Britain, through show and tell, flows along. It feels right. It looks and sounds gorgeous. It taught me stuff. I re-watch it all, or certain parts, often. Because its fun and wonderful. Its flaw is the length: way too short. If only it had been twice as long...

Now, I've friends who just don't like it. They dislike Schama, his personal take, the lack of in-depth constitutional info. They don't like the atmospherics of the painting-like camera scenes, and the soundtrack. I've had people say that stuff takes away from the history and ask what's wrong with Schama, he jerks, lunges, jumps about. The wrong points were high-lighted, stuff left out, etc. You might think the same. Also, although its about 'Britain', people complain that Scotland and Ireland are not given enough play. That is pretty fair, and a few more episodes would have helped.
But me, I got pulled in.",1396137600,6,3387,4.745331069609508
7931629,4,B000056AVY,"This set has all 15 episodes of the original series on A&E.  I think the British series on BBC was better, so I would suggest trying to get a copy of that before this one.

That being said, this is still a very interesting history of Britain from "" Roman Britain, the Norman Conquest, the struggles of the Henrys and Richards, Elizabeth I, Scottish rebellions and the English Civil Wars, the American Revolution, the growth of the British Empire, Queen Victoria, the industrial age, and Winston Churchill""

Scam a does have a way of bringing the story to life.  If we had history DVD's like this I was in high school, I think I would have a lot more knowledge of many more things, I found boring just from a text book.  Great stuff!",1393113600,,732,4.432835820895522
