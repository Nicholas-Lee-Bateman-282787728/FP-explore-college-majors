529533,5,6302985307,"This is a pretty good comedy about the goings on at a backwater area of the Pacific during WW2 and the PR staff of the navy.  Good solid performances top to bottom with Glenn Ford holding things together.  I remember seeing this in the theater when it first came out and enjoying and I found that I still enjoy it today.  Not any sex, nudity or swearing in it so it could not be made today.  But if you enjoy a nicely made film from the era that has good acting and gentle comedy this is for you.",1320883200,6,496,4.030612244897959
529534,5,6302985307,"Thankfully, this outstanding WWII comedy is finally available on DVD. The plot involves the various escapades and travails of a navy public relations unit stationed on a remote pacific island. The star is Glenn Ford -- one of the most talented and versatile actors of the Golden Age of movies. Ford is ably abetted by beautiful Gia Scala, Anne Francis, Earl Holliman, Keenan Wynn, and even Eva Gabor. There is no way that real war can be truly funny, but this movie about naval personnel far from combat is hilarious.",1315526400,2,517,4.7555555555555555

529536,5,6302985307,"This movie was a ""fav"" of mine growing up, especially the story line about the typical US Navy sailor, Farragut Jones, that this PR unit wants to sell warbonds or something.  Turns out he is anything but.  The man has a salty mouth and the director made great use of a fog horn!  ""the Ankletooth is a great ship...that's a #@&#&! lie"".  A classic...someone HAS to put this out on DVD.",1283299200,10,384,4.366197183098592
529537,5,6302985307,I have watched this movie on VHS for years. It truly needs to be on DVD. I remember seeing it at the drive=in when I was a child.  If you want a good laugh this is a great movie.,1257897600,5,178,3.5641025641025643
529538,5,6302985307,This film deserves a DVD release. A very funny WW2 movie where a Navy PR Unit believes going to the front is the most grevious punishment to give out to any of their members. And the taking on the building of their own Officers Recreation Hall has lots of laughs.,1141603200,20,263,4.28

With all of the people, like me, who love Navy movies, this one was fun to watch.

529706,4,6302985307,"Here's a Glenn Ford movie that can be enjoyed more than once.  The premise of Navy personnel on an island and never getting into the war probably happened, but probably not this way, with enlisted men getting involved with officers and others hiding the fact.  And I doubt that any of the Gabor sisters showed up on the islands, either!  It's good for a laugh.",1405123200,,360,4.507692307692308

529818,4,6302985307,"Another movie created by Hollywood that takes you to a South Pacific Island with a guy who can get anything, do anything and take care of anything.  That is until a beautiful woman shows up to ruin his life and he falls in love with all the complications that are used in everyone of the movies like this.  It's been done with Jack Lemmon, Jerry Lewis and many others stars of the time.",1396483200,,386,4.273972602739726

529823,3,6302985307,"A favorite movie of mine arrived from Amazon yesterday. At the top of DVD case with a bright red background, it proclaimed, ""Remastered Edition"". As I said, the movie itself is great. But the quality of the DVD with MANY white spots (the ""digital remastering"") is very poor. So, if you want this DVD right now, Amazon's poor quality transfer DVD is the only game in town. If you don't mind waiting, you might want to write the studio (Warner) and have them release an official, truly digitally remastered DVD. Also, Amazon doesn't give you a break for poor quality; their spotty DVD is full price.",1340841600,8,597,4.6415094339622645
529824,2,6302985307,"Another example of Hollywood adopting a good book and turning out a poor movie. If you want something to entertain you for a few hours, buy the book instead.",1326153600,,157,4.448275862068965
529825,3,6302985307,"I have been waiting for this movie to become available on DVD for a long time and unfortunately this isn't very good. This very entertaining movie has received a rather poor transfer and apparently it needs a complete restoration, not just a remastering. The picture is very grainy, the brightness and color fluctuated briefly numerous times throughout the movie most notably before and after scene changes. Small artifacts were visible as well. Audio is reasonably clear, nothing remarkable, with no obvious audio sync issues which have been a problem with a few other DVD-R releases. I viewed this on a 67 inch Samsung LED DLP Hidef television using a Panasonic upconverting Blu-ray player. This combination usually results in very good viewing experiences, but upconversion didn't help this transfer one bit. On the positive side the picture didn't skip or freeze. Not an acceptable release as far as I'm concerned, but better than not having it at all. A marginal 3 stars because of the poor transfer.

In my opinion this is another poor quality on demand DVD-R release. I made this purchase with reservations due to negative Amazon customer reviews about poor quality issues on other DVD-R releases, The Student Prince and The Perfect Furlough to name a couple. This is my first and last on demand DVD-R purchase.",1324080000,5,1318,5.018264840182648
529826,3,6302985307,"This has always been one of my favorite movies. I was so happy to see it finally release on DVD.  However, Warner Brothers could have done a much better job on the DVD.  It is shown in a 2.35:1 widescreen format.  I believe that Amazon said 1.78:1, which is incorrect.  The case says remastered, but I found the quality of the picture way below what it should be.  The picture is grainy and the sound is only so-so.  For the price, I was expecting better.  There are NO SUBTITLES.  You would think if it was ""remastered"" they could at least add that feature.  Having said all this, the movie is still a hoot.  Glad to add it to my dvd collection.  They just don't make them this entertaining anymore.",1323993600,8,700,4.348837209302325

7833323,5,6302985307,"I admit that the movie of Dont Go Near The Water caught my attention after I saw some details involving what the plot would be like and the fact that there was a novel written by William Brinkley of Dont Go Near The Water that this movie is based on. The beginning of the film foreshadows the sense of light-hearted and carefree humor that this movie will have when the following quote is listed; A Great Naval Commander Once Said, Dont Give Up Our Ship, The Sailors In Our Story Arent Worried By This, They Have No Ships To Give Up and They Dont Go Near The Water. In charge of the command is the character of  a public relations officer by the name of Lieutenant Commander Clinton T. Nash. Lieutenant Max Siegel (Glenn Ford) is one of the leaders over the other military personnel stationed at a public relations command that is a seemingly quiet island (by military standards). Siegel falls in love with one of the local schoolteachers on the island named Melora Alba (played by Gia Scala).  Siegel also ends up mentoring but being careful to also to toe the line of his professional duties (metaphorically speaking). This happens when Adam Garrett (Earl Holliman) plays an important role (in terms of plot development) when he confides in Siegel as well asking for his advice/help in how to handle the fact that he (Garrett) is madly in love with Lieutenant J.G. Alice Tomlen (Anne Francis). One of the funniest scenes that had me laughing so hard was the acting  where Nash tried to get public relations military personal to do construction work that is actually meant to be done by trained navy construction personnel (a.k.a the Seabees).  Of course, there are more actors and actresses in Dont Go Near The Water yet I must avoid saying too much more out of consideration for other people who still want to see Dont Go Near The Water.  However, what I did find interesting is seeing online the details that life eventually imitated art for Glenn Ford when he became a public relations officer for the navy reserve some time after the movie was made and  Earl Holliman is listed to have also done some time in the U.S. Navy (except previously before the filming). Of course, I would also gladly watch Dont Go Near The Water again.",1471392000,,2235,4.61712846347607
