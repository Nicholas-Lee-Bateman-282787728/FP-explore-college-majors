8181177,5,6305107637,"As Christmas draws near and P.J.'s large family prepares for that special night that comes only once a year, this little Funnybunny can't wait to get his hands on the season's hot new toy, the Superblaster! But when the very last one is donated to a nearby children's home, P.J. despairs that he'll not get his Christmas wish. Fortunately, a certain jolly fellow arrives just in time to explain the true meaning of Christmas to P.J. and his animal pals. It's heartwarming with wonderful animation based on the illustrations found in the best-selling ""P.J. Funnybunny"" children's book series by Marilyn Sadler. This delightful animated Christmas story is the second in a series produced by award-winning Croatian-American animator, Marija Miletic Dail, for the ABC network as a Children's Christmas Special in 1992.",1099008000,,814,5.221374045801527
