8456590,4,B0054DPLTI,"There are 14 documentaries in this collection. They are all independent and not part of a full set describing the war. This is simply a collection of various History channel shows mostly from the 1990's. I would recommend that anyone using this should already be familiar with the war by viewing another multi-episode DVD set that describes the WWI from start to finish. Then this set becomes an excellent supplement that has a lot of value add in specific areas. For example the doughboys documentary does a good job of identifying the USA effort in the war, something that is minimized in many of the other war chronicles since most of them feature British efforts.

Since this is not a set you will get some well done documentaries that are on target and some that are not so well or not particularly about WWI. For example the Airships documentary only has a few minutes on WWI. Most of the others are targeted better. However, that said, I would highly recommend this DVD collection to get a details and perspectives that others leave out such as the climate and political opposition to the war in the USA. Each documentary is about 45 minutes.

The 14 documentaries are titled:
Most Decorated: The Doughboys
WWI: Death of Glory
Secrets of WWI
The First Dogfighters
Red Baron and the Wings of Death
Airships
Mystery U-Boat of WWI
WWI: Jutland
WWI: The Somme
Halt U-Boats in the Zeebrugge
John J. Pershing: The Iron General
Dear Home: Letters from WWI
Christmas Truce
Last Day of WWI",1339113600,,1487,4.7153846153846155

8456593,4,B0054DPLTI,"""World War I The Great War,"" a four-DVD set of History, introduces viewers to select events of WWI that are not necessarily well known, even among history buffs.  Think for example about ""Halt U-Boats in the Zeebrugge,""  ""Christmas Truce,"" or ""Mystery U-Boot of WWI.""  The documentary ""Secrets of WWI"" is a major disappointment compared to the other documentaries reproduced in the DVD set under review.  The loud soundtrack that goes with this documentary does not add any value to the narrative.  In summary, the DVD set will probably appeal the most to those viewers with an advanced knowledge of WWI.",1320624000,5,604,5.0
