860486,4,6304397925,"This television special of ALICE THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS, originally telecast in 1966, is a very delightful musical that is a joy to watch.
Judi Rolin plays Alice.  She has a remarkable singing voice and dances wonderfully, but her acting style is somewhat lacking, sometimes cloying and a little over-the-top.
Roy Castle, as Lester the Jester, has a ball, and also sings and dances wonderfully.  There is Tom and Dick Smothers as Tweedledum and Tweedledee, and Jack Palance as the Jabberwock.
In featured roles are Agnes Moorehead and Robert Coote as the Red Queen and King, and Nanette Fabray and Ricardo Montalban as the White Queen and King.
There's also the fabulous Iris Adrian as Tiger Lilly, Jackie Joseph as Daisy, Richard Denning as Father and Jimmy Durante as Humpty Dumpty.
The fantastic songs are by Moose Charlap (""Peter Pan"") and Elsie Simmons, and the highly imaginative costumes are by Bob Mackie.
The stunning television presentation is a must for all Alice and musical fans!",991267200,6,995,5.024242424242424

I always liked Though the Looking Glass better than Alice's Adventures Underground/Alice in Wonderland, and was hoping that this followed the story-line for it, but it did not. It had Wonderland elements (""Drink me"",pink flamingos, etc...) and added unneeded characters such as witches and a jester that ruined the story.

Use your judgement as it may not appeal to all but this is a classic and charming production with talented actors and singers. The sets and costumes are very nice like an artsy stage play. The lyrics and songs are so fun. I'm not even sure if there's a soundtrack but I would buy it. This is not the traditional Alice you are used to, but one where Alice is journeying to be a Queen of Wonderland which is being plagued by the Jabberwock. You have the Red Queen and King and the White Queen and King who greet her at the start and encourage her along the way. Add in a friendly and cute Jester. Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum are also priceless fun. It's a very sweet and entertaining musical. If that sounds like your cup of tea than you are missing out if you don't get this dvd.

860663,1,6304397925,"First and foremost, it's not Alice. It takes a lot of the pieces, loses too much of what was good, adds a lot of what's not, then changes the surviving fragments beyond recognition. (Carroll's Alice was hardly the sassy character seen here). Now, force the story into a Procrustean made-for-TV format, complete with odd jumps that might match intervals between episodes. Populate the cast with B-list actors and sitcom regulars from the 1960s, and rework the whole thing with inane song-and-dance numbers.

Then, when you thought it couldn't get any worse, add a laugh track. Because you wouldn't know what was supposed to be funny or what you were supposed to like without canned laughter and applause.

If, despite all the good intentions in the world, this somehow got into your collection, give it to someone you don't like.

860773,2,6304397925,"This is one in a series of reviews that will eventually be posted for every Alice in Wonderland title available on Amazon. When the Tim Burton rendition of AIW with Johnny Depp was due out in 2010 I thought it might be a good time to go back and watch the benchmark Walt Disney production from 1951, which I saw -or assumed I saw- as a child. It was a chance to get reacquainted with the many varied characters from the story as sort of a warm up for the Burton film. Upon viewing the Disney classic I was astonished to realize that I had likely never seen more than a few clips (at most) of that beautifully rendered Alice in Wonderland. So much seemed brand new. Nor did I have a memory of ever seeing any other ""Alice"" production. Then I realized that I had never read the book! Wait a minute. Where then did my memory of the Alice story come from? The curiosity sparked by that question ultimately led me over the next two years to accumulate every version of Alice in Wonderland still in existence. Well over 40 by the way!

This general commentary continues over in the review sections for both the 1951 AIW production from Walt Disney (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alice-in-Wonderland-Masterpiece-Edition/dp/B0000TG9E2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alice in Wonderland (Masterpiece Edition)</a>) and the 2010 production starring Johnny Depp (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alice-in-Wonderland/dp/B001HN694K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alice in Wonderland</a>). As these are the two most well known Alice's, rather then attempt to add yet-another-review for those two films, it seemed like it might be a more fun use of the provided space to muse a bit on the popularity and remarkable longevity of the story spawned by Lewis Carroll in 1865, as well as to share with you a bit of what I picked up while watching these 40 or so renderings of Alice in Wonderland. All other Alice productions listed by Amazon have a specific review for that title.

Review of this 1966 production of Through the Looking Glass...

In taking the chronological path through the Alice in Wonderland forest of filmography I have personally enjoyed nearly every telling of the story to date, starting with the first ever ""Alice"" film in 1903. I've hit two stinkers though, and this is one of them. But let's back up for a second...

It's 1966. While Jonathan Miller is in England completing his darkish B&W version of Alice in Wonderland for a popular British TV series, over in America cartoon production giant Hanna-Barbara (The Flintstones) is making an animated version of the Alice story. The former production is a masterpiece, and the latter is a fun kids version certainly worthy of a view.

Then we have this disappointing American TV special...

This is a purely theatrical musical version of Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland sequel 'Through the Looking Glass, And What Alice Found There'. I guess I should qualify myself (or disqualify perhaps) as a male who is not particularly tuned into ""musicals"" per se. I love music... and song... and dance, but not a non-stop every-bit-is-a-song/dance sequence, and that's what this 60's TV special is. What's more, the show really doesn't stick to the themes of the story at all. I found myself fast-forwarding just to get it all over with. The one sequence I was looking forward to was the Tweedledee/Tweedledum bit with the ever funny Smother Brothers, but even that part of the show fell through the cracks of this sappy, happy faced production.

If you are into the nostalgia of the 60's style variety entertainment shows this is a perfect example of that genre. Beyond that however I personally see little redeeming value. For the record Alice was played by 20 year old Judi Roland.

860774,3,6304397925,"There is a sweet naivete to this production of Alice.  The plot frequently is not well thought out (even by Wonderland standards) but the musical numbers are fun.  Nanette Fabray is playful and wonderful as the White Queen.  Agnus Moorehead as the red Queen (who was brought in to replace Bette Davis after Ms Davis dropped out- she saw Nanette rehearsing the White Queen on roller skates and feared she would be upstaged so suddenly developed a problem with her back) Agnus channels a sort of Bette Davis in her delivery.  (A friend who was there in the rehearsal said Bette Davis was pretty marvelous- ""What's one and one and one..... and one""  (Alice-""You go too fast!"")  ""She can't add!""  But Agnus was good and much easier to work with.  The scenery and costumes are fun- the actors are all having a good time.  It is worth a watch.  The extras talk a bit about the making of it and worth a peek if that is of interest to you.",1339804800,2,931,4.423529411764706

860777,1,6304397925,"This lightweight 60s TV musical has nothing whatever to do with Lewis Carroll or anything he ever wrote. In place of Carroll's immortal humor and wit, we have the pathetic (sometimes imitative) efforts of NBC hacks accompanied by canned laughter and applause. Lackluster songs that have to be endured rather than enjoyed, strained and unsuccessful efforts at humor, bad acting, all add up to something you might see on a bad night at your local high school.

The unusual performances of  major stars of the time are wonderful. Judi Rolin, in the title role, gives a magical rendition of Alice. She is a whisp of a girl, but her voice is powerful and she more than holds her own surounded by huge characters bigger than life. How lucky we are to have captured her rare performance. What a shame she didn't do a lot more. This rendition produced in 1966 is unusual and very different. It is not animation, but real actors. Bob Mackie's costumes are spectacular. The Moose Charlap score is lovely and the Don Costa musical arrangements are terrific. There are special added comments added by long time TV producer (The Judy Garland Show) Bob Wynn.",1295308800,5,821,4.701388888888889

860781,5,6304397925,"Perhaps inspired by the annual TV broadcast of MGM'S ""The Wizard Of Oz"", the three major television networks (CBS, NBC, and ABC) used to comission family-oriented Made-for-TV musicals. These were preserved on videotape and shown every year, usually around the November/December holidays; as truly ""Special Events."" Alas, these ""TV musical Special Events""  belong to a TV era that vanished long ago. Along with MGM's ""The Wizard Of Oz,"" there were also annual  broadcasts of Mary Martin as ""Peter Pan"" (NBC, preserved for posterity on videotape in 1960) and Lesley Ann Warren as ""Cinderella"" ( CBS; 1965). While NBC'S 1966 musical adaptation of ""Alice Through The Looking-Glass"" may not have achieved perennial status, aspects of it lingered in my childhood  memory. I remember  viewing this once or twice;  and being scared to death by Jack Palance as the ""Jabberwock."" I also recall an RCA Victor Soundtrack Album of the songs by Moose Charlap (co-writer of the songs for Mary Martin's ""Peter Pan"") and Elsie Simmons. The songs include ""Two Sides To Everything,"" ""Keep On The Grass"", ""Some Summer Day"", ""Who Am I?,"" ""The Backwards Alphabet"" and ""Alice Is Coming To Tea"". Stepping back through the Looking-Glass with Alice again was like re-discovering a lost gem from my childhood.
  The production, featuring extremely lavish costumes by Bob Mackie. unfolds very much like a live Broadway musical-- except it is on videotape. The canned laughter and applause aren't nearly as distracting as they might seem to be;  actually giving the production a bit more nostalgic value. The libretto  by Albert Simmons is more ""Suggested By"" Lewis Carroll's ""Through The Looking-Glass"" than directly ""Based Upon"" it. Alice (Judi Rolin)  steps through the looking-glass into topsy-turvy Looking Glass Land. After meeting the Red King and Queen (Robert Coote, from the Original Broadway Cast of ""My Fair Lady"" and ""Camelot"";  and Agnes Moorehead) ; and The White King and Queen (celebrated comedienne Nannette Fabray and  ""Fantasy Island's"" charming Ricardo Montalban).  Alice decides she wants to be a Queen herself. The inhabitants of Looking-Glass Land live in fear of The Jabberwock (a genuinely frightening performance by Jack Palance). Fearless Alice is determined to arrive at the Palace and be crowned Queen; thereby ending the Jabberwock's reign of terror. Simmons adds a character named Lester The Jester, (delightfully portrayed by Roy Castle)  who occasionally guides Alice through Looking-Glass Land and protects her from the Jabberwock. There is incredible chemistry between Judi Rolin and Roy Castle; resulting in a suggestion of romantic attraction between Alice and Lester. The final moments, where Jack Palance's  Jabberwock screams at Alice from  inside the Looking-Glass, still scare me. The perfectly cast production also includes Tom and Dick Smothers as Tweeledee and Tweedledum and Jimmy Durante as Humpty Dumpty.
  Judi Rolin gives an extraordinary performance as Alice, and she more than holds her own in a cast filled with show-business heavyweights; most notably Agnes Moorehead; (best-known for her role as the imposing grand-dame witch Endora on the TV classic ""Bewitched""). In other film and TV adaptations,  the very British Alice often comes across as snobby or-- much worse-- bland. But Judi Rolin's  American Alice, free of annoying affectation and  mannerisims,  is brave, authoritive, vibrant, and enchanting.
  On the DVD Extras, producer Bob Wynn shares his memories of the ""Looking-Glass"" cast and production; and also his memories of working with such show-business superstars as Judy Garland and Frank Sinatra.",1266969600,21,3639,5.411347517730497

""Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There"" (1871) is a novel by Lewis Carroll (Charles Lutwidge Dodgson), the sequel to ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"" (1865). Set some six months later than the earlier book, Alice again enters a fantastical world, when she ponders what the world is like on the other side of a mirror's reflection. Prompted in the 1966 NBC ""Producer's Showcase"" color television dream song and dance fantasy by the Red Chess King, Alice climbing up on the family's library fireplace mantel, Alice pokes at the pier wall-mirror over the fireplace and discovers, to her surprised amazement, that she is able to step through the mantle's pier ""looking glass"" mirror into an alternative magical dream fantasy world. In this imaginative room's reverse-reflected black and white version of the library-study she has just stepped from in her house, this time by climbing through a looking glass mirror into the world that she views beyond in the family library-study's pier looking glass wall mirror. The original Lewis Carrol ""Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There"" novel includes such celebrated verses as ""Jabberwocky"" and ""The Walrus and the Carpenter"", and the episode involving Tweedledum and Tweedledee.
