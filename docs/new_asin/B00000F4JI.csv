8201500,5,B00000F4JI,Wish there were more interviews and backstage footage but excellent video.  Uncut videos of LA Guns in thier prime.  One More Reason would be the highlight.,1385337600,,156,4.961538461538462
8201501,4,B00000F4JI,"This video is like a time capsule to this great band and this great era in rock music. All the tracks are from their self titled debut album and displays the raw energy of a young band on the rise. The videos for One More Reason and Electric Gypsy are standouts featuring Harley's out on desert highways, a homicidal vixen in a '60 Buick, and general rock n' roll mayhem. Tracii also shares some interesting thoughts, but at just 30 minutes long, it may leave fans high and dry yearning for more chaos. Like Motley Crue, L.A. Guns know how to knock out a killer music video. Highly recommended.",1124496000,,594,4.458715596330276
