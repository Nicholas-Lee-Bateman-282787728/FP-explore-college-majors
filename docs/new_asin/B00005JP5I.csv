1580061,4,B00005JP5I,"Anyone who fondly remembers the 1954 THE CAINE MUTINY should enjoy the made-for-television THE CAINE MUTINY COURT-MARTIAL.  Some might even prefer this one.
 Lt. Steve Maryk (Jeff Daniels) is being court-martialed for wrongly relieving Lt. Cmdr. Phillip Queeg (Brad Davis) of command while on active duty in the Pacific.  Lt. Barney Greenwald (Eric Bogosian) is Maryk's ambitious and divided attorney.  To win an acquittal for his client, Greenwald will have to convince the court that Queeg is unfit for command.
 Unlike Humphrey Bogart's CAINE this one, save for the opening and closing scenes, never leaves the courtroom.  I think that works well here.  That one was Queeg's movie, this one is Greenwald's.
 Brad Davis is effective in the demanding role of Queeg.  Michael Murphy, as presiding judge Capt. Blakely, does a lot with facial expressions.  His reaction shots during Queeg's testimony, reflecting a horrified realization of the depth of Queeg's dementia, work.  Queeg is cooked.  Jeff Daniels is excellent as the somewhat dense and manipulated mutineer.
 The show belongs to Bogosian, though, and it's worth the price of admission to see the final scene where he tells his client what he really thinks of the whole thing.  In the '54 CAINE this was a one-off line of dialogue by Jose Ferrer.  Here it's a rather extended scene that goes into greater depth explaining Greenwald's disgust with his courtroom victory.
 Fans of courtroom dramas will love this.",1083456000,13,1470,5.165254237288136

1580162,5,B00005JP5I,"First rate television drama.  I have always considered this to be a far tighter and more dramatic presentation than the film, excellent though it is.  That is because in this play, all we know is introduced via testimony and cross examination, so we do not see the actual events leading up to the relief of Captain Queeg.  Every portrayal is masterful, from Lt. Greenwald's canny setting up and devastation examination of Queeg, through Lt. Maryk's dogged insistence that he took the correct course despite it meaning the end of his dreams of a Naval career, to Queeg's own carefully constructed facade of normality and competence collapsing beneath the stress of testifying under oath.

Especially heartrending is Queeg's disintegration on the stand and the stunned, sickened reactions of the observers from the court martial board to Maryk himself.  In what at first seems an afterthought, Greenwald explains his reasons for accepting the case in a blistering indictment of Lt. Keefer, a hitherto peripheral character who assumes a monstrous dimension as a smug, selfish manipulator who orchestrated the entire affair and kept his own skirts clean, leaving his former friend and colleague Maryk to take the fall for his betrayal.",1463788800,,1231,5.196969696969697

1580168,3,B00005JP5I,"I know the novel well, admired the film, and saw this play off Broadway--in the 70's or 80's, I think.

Herman Wouk did a good job adapting his novel for the stage, but it was not easy, and not perfect. The background and slow development of the antipathy between Queeg and his officers evolved in the novel under the patient and knowing eye of the narrative persona and centered around Willie Keith's maturation; much of this is necessarily only lightly sketched into the screenplay of the court martial.

I have reviewed the novel elsewhere at length. My only disappointment with this interpretation of the derivative drama is with the culminating final scene, an objection I share with others. The film adaptation with Jose Ferrer as Greenwald was much closer to the book in tone, simplicity, and message, all of which were lost of diluted in this bizarre interpretation. The austere backstory did not prepare the viewer for Greenwald's dislike of Keefer (central in the novel and movie), and in the confused and haphazard party scene it was lost like jetsam in a ship's wake.  This stumble was finished off with Maryk's shrug and amused smile, as if the director simply could not take Greenwald's point seriously, or let Maryk, a basically good officer, swallow it either. This effete, smirking flourish betrayed the whole point of the novel, a yellow dye stain in the wake of Wouk's great story.",1420243200,2,1400,4.873949579831932
1580169,4,B00005JP5I,"I saw this production on TV after having read the book years before, which mentioned this play as a parallel project of Herman Wouk's. I had been wishing I could see it (or at least read the play--which I notice you now can also get here) ever since. I had been underwhelmed by Hollywood's Humphrey Bogart version, who'd based his portrayal of Queeg with the macho of his other screen roles in ""High Sierra"", ""African Queen"" and ""Casablanca"". Rather than the seagoing fuddy-duddy Wouk created him as to begin with. You're not going to find a Bogart character's four-striper immediate superior describing him as ""an old lady"" when speaking of him to the admiral (which did happen in the book). But Bogart always did put attitude and swagger into even his head case characters (e.g. his Cagney-esque tommygun-wielding  holdup man Roy Earle in ""High Sierra""). And anyway the movie had focused too much on the typhoon during which Maryk relieved Queeg, making it an Alistair MacLean-ish sea adventure story rather than the psychological war story Wouk had written the book as.

At least one other reviewer here takes issue with the way background noise at the ""party scene"" at the end steps all over the dialogue--including Barney Greenwald's drunken speech which in the past had only been available to those of us who are among the Wouk novel's readership. We did get the ""toast"" at the end of wine right in Tom Keefer's face, though. And we also get to hear Willie Keith's song ""Old Yellowstain Blues"" as an end credits theme to a movie otherwise without a musical soundtrack. Unless you count those snatches of drill marches overheard from outside the building between scenes. The Keith song has a not-too-bad boogie woogie Randy Newman-ish feel to it.",1417651200,,1751,4.87248322147651
1580170,5,B00005JP5I,"""The Caine Mutiny"" is one of my favorite war novels and movies.  This production solely focuses on the Court Martial trial, of course.  This film will make zero sense to a viewer who has not either seen the movie or, preferably, read the book.  The clear goal here was to portray the Court Martial as closely to the novel as possible.  Here, it largely succeeds.  This production deviates from the novel only in small, insignificant ways.  Unlike 99% of my reviews, this one contains spoilers so be warned.  The spoilers are allowed because, as I said, unless you know the story already this production would be very hard to understand and impossible to appreciate.

Jeff Daniels stars as Lt. Maryk and he is the only big name star in this production.  He does a stellar job as the honest, well-meaning, capable, but not terribly bright Executive Officer of the Caine.  One thing that this film should have brought out more was the fact that alone among the officers of the Caine, Maryk did not use the term ""Old Yellow Stain"" in referring to Queeg.  This omission was unfortunate in my opinion because in the novel Maryk was the one officer who tried to hold the ship together and get Queeg through his tour as skipper of the Caine.  In the novel it was Willie Keith's testimony that brought this out, and I was sorry to see this omitted in this much closer adaptation as well.

Erig Bogosian, the defense attorney, is competent in this key role but I will ask forgiveness for saying that no one could match the superb Jose Ferrar, who played Barney Greenwald in the original film.  The roles of prosecutor, presiding officer, and other supporting roles are all extremely well-done, better than in the original film in my opinion.  Further, the Court Martial itself is far more authentic than the movie, and of course far more detailed.  Those of us who are lawyers will appreciate the technical accuracy of the hearsay objections and other technical details of the Court Martial -- not least of which was the fact that this production returned the charge against Maryk to one of ""Conduct Prejudicial to Good Order and Discipline"" -- not Mutiny as the original movie did.  This is both accurate and faithful to the novel.

A special mention should be made of the actor (Ken Michels) who plays Dr. Byrd, one of the two psychiatrists who testified in the actual novel.  In this film he plays his role masterfully, and captures the role as portrayed in the original novel perfectly.  (He is left out of the original film altogether.)  In this film, as in the novel, Byrd's testimony is key, and here is superbly done.

The biggest quandry that I have in reviewing this film is deciding who is the better Captain Queeg -- Humphrey Bogart or (in this film) the relatively unknown Brad Davis.  Bogart played the role like a brilliant movie star (which he was).  Brad Davis, quite franky, nails the role of Queeg as contemplated by the novel.  By the time he is finished testifying the courtroom has no doubt that Queeg was deeply disturbed and had not (contrary to the testimony of the two psychaitrists)  ""adjusted"" to his paranoia in a manner sufficiently satisfactory to enable him to bear the strains of wartime naval command.  Which was the entire point missed by the psychologists.

In my opinion the closing scene in this drama, the party for Kiefer, was poorly acted and added nothing to the film.  The analogous scene in the original film was vastly better-acted and better done -- it was shorter and far more to the point.  This film frankly botches this scene, which was masterfully handled in the film and makes the essential point: had the officers of the Caine supported Queeg (who, despite his manifest flaws, was entitled to this loyalty) with compassion and loyalty the entire ""Caine Mutiny"" might not have been necessary.

Fans of ""The Caine Mutiny"" will not want to miss this one.  While the original movie is matchless, this is a brilliant portrayal of the Court Martial as originally contemplated by the timeless novel.",1417132800,3,4035,4.736389684813753

1580252,4,B00005JP5I,"This review is for ASIN: B004CZZZL8 If you are at all a fan of the book, movie and especially the stage play make sure you order this, the 121 minute version. It is not the truncated version originally shown on TNT (I think it was TNT) which was criminally paired down to come in at around 90 minutes to make space for commercials. This is the TNT version of the whole stage play with no expurgated scenes. There are no special features, subtitles or menu's. It just starts right in on the play. I had a VHS version in which the sound didn't quite sync up with the video but that problem is fixed here.

I have always thought the stage play was the most potent of the three versions of the story. The trial is pretty much the heart of the novel. (If you've only seen the movie let me just say that once you read the book or see the play the movie begins to seem kind of silly. Still a good movie though.)  The performances are all top notch especially Bogosian as Barney Greenwald. Bogart's performance in the movie was so good that it is a little hard to get use to Brad Davis as Queeg but once you do you can really see the pathos in the character. Its a powerful performance. It would have been nice to see this as a theatrical release which would have given it more notoriety as I think its message is still a relevant counter to those of the intelligentsia who look down their noses at the military and find the existence of it and the lesser beings who support it pathetic and pitiable. Unfortunately I fear this would likely be lost on a modern audience. But perhaps I'm being too cynical, at least I hope I am.

My only complaint is the direction by Robert Altman, who I've always thought was highly overrated. He has an annoying habit here of surrounding some stretches of dialogue with ambient crowd noise and chatter which is irritatingly distracting. But its a relatively minor point. All in all a very satisfying production. Is it even performed anymore? I'd love to see it on stage.",1404432000,,1996,4.37466307277628

1580255,4,B00005JP5I,"Glad to see this DVD is available. They haven't made a new film since Bogart played Queeg so this is better than nothing.

1580256,4,B00005JP5I,"This version of the Caine Mutiny Court Martial is interesting.  While the cast of this production cannot possibly compare to the original movie starring Fred MacMurray, Humphrie Bogart, Van Johnson, E. G. Marshal and the rest, it is an interesting variation of the Trial portion of the original movie.  Most of the dialogue was taken from the original movie.  Yet, the order in which it is presented is sometimes altered.  And the witnesses are augmented in an effort to clarify some of the things that were not fully described in the original movie.  While Eric Bogosian does a formidable job of defending his clients, the movie is good, but does not hold up to the classic quality of the original.  Still, those who are fond of the original ""Caine Mutiny"" will find this version of interest.  It is recommended for those viewers who have seen the original movie, particularly those who have seen it numerous times and have a good grasp on the first movie.  It is particularly recommended for that group of movie viewers who want to compare and contract the interesting and informative variations between the two versions.  I recommend it for those particular viewers and for others who have an interest in the story, especially if they have read Wouk's original book.",1379116800,,1269,4.865116279069768

The stageplay is fascinating to watch, although very close to the movie version. Isolated from the rest of the movie makes it more dramatic and not a conclusion.
  However,we measure our reading based on our present knowledge. And considering the enormous strides medicine and our awareness of mental illnesses - minor and major - this book and stage play are even more dramatic and can be expolated to our own armed servicemen of today.

1580259,4,B00005JP5I,"The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial was a made for TV that Robert Altman did in the late eighties. The film has all the good Altman elements and is a pretty good drama with good acting from Jeff Daniels, Peter Gallagher, and Eric Bogosian. The film is basically the trial being held for the court martial of Lt. Steve Maryk. The film is recommended for any Altman fans.",1322265600,,364,4.53030303030303
1580260,1,B00005JP5I,"Altman is great, but this TV movie really misfires in many ways. There are many good actors here, but they all seem to be playing the wrong roles, the dialogue seems scripted and phony, the tension never builds, the drama is missing. This version was a huge disappointment.

Watch the Humphrey Bogart version if you want to see how intense The Caine Mutiny can be.",1164499200,6,364,4.6
7942037,2,B00005JP5I,"While I deeply admire Robert Altman, this low-budget TV production was simply a mess--one of many during his long fallow time between ""Nashville"" (1975) and ""The Player"" (1992).

Yes, the acting is outstanding. Jeff Daniels plays a younger, cockier Steve Maryk than Van Johnson did in the 1954 film, and is thus slightly less sympathetic. The other players, to a man, give deeper, more nuanced interpretations of their characters than did their big-screen counterparts. A studio exec's motto from ""The Player"" describes the cast perfectly: ""No stars, just talent."" I would have liked to see this ensemble perform the play live.

But Altman, for no good reason, buried many of his actors' best moments with pointless gimmicks. Those begin in the very first frame, where he establishes a theme of interposing barriers that constrict the field of view, thus using only a small part of the screen to depict the action. That might make sense for a scene that needs to seem distant or indistinct--a dream sequence, an old memory, or an important juxtaposition of foreground and background action. But it doesn't work in filming a straight dramatic play. Theater gets its dramatic power from immediacy, which Altman's showboating cinematography repeatedly trashes.

And theater gets its power from the perfection of its dialogue, which Altman trashes even more. Throughout the film, important dialogue is submerged in background noise, or talked over. Of course, that's an Altman trademark. In his best films, the screenplay allows for such moments and makes them part of the story, rather than a distraction from it. Wouk's play doesn't have such moments; every word counts. If Altman had to have some crosstalk in this film, he should have adapted the play to make room for it.

That really comes to a head in the final scene, one of the weakest and stupidest Altman ever filmed. Eric Bogosian does a great job delivering Barney Greenwald's final speech--maybe. Who can tell? In Wouk's play, Tom Keefer hosts a dinner for the Caine's officers. Their boisterousness quickly turns to rapt attention as Barney addresses them. In the Altman version, Keefer holds a loud cocktail party with a room full of noisy guests. Barney delivers the most important lines in the play while everyone else in the room, including Keefer, goes right on talking and partying throughout. Instead of a heightened reality that enables a story to be told, we have nothing but ""realistic"" noise. And it's not even all that realistic. We've all been to loud parties that got quiet very quickly when someone legitimately called for the crowd's attention.

Putting Wouk's play on film was a straightforward project that required excellent, self-effacing craftsmanship. Instead, Altman allowed his ego to get the better of him. The end product fails both as craft and as art.",1520467200,,2840,5.085836909871245
7942038,4,B00005JP5I,Worth watching but lacks power compared to the movie performances.  Probably not as good as the broadway stage case was.  I think something is missing in the whole direction.  I did not care for the location.  Altman did not show his talent in this version in my opinion.

7942044,5,B00005JP5I,"At first I was expecting a modern version of The Caine Mutiny which I remember.  When I realized there were no flashbacks on board the vessel I was at first disappointed.  Shortly after that I realized the acting was superior to the original starring Bogart, however.  I felt the actor playing Queeg more accurately portrays a man with no military bearing, who cracks under pressure, and cannot admit fault due to a fragile self-esteem. Contrary to a different review another person gave I felt the defense attorney was superior in all ways to the original actor who played the part. In the end I felt the presentation was more dramatic and realistic to the original. The setting for the court martial was authentic and believable given the situation during time of war.  I was very pleased with this purchase and one of the few movies I like enough to watch more than once.

Oh and I was utterly shocked at how well Jeff Daniels played the part. Never really cared for him as an actor but he NAILED it here.  Well done on everything; 5 stars.  And one more thing (I can't resist) the military presence the presiding officer gives during the trial and especially during the final testimony of Queeg was right on and consistent with a military officer. Absolutely loved this film.  Even the psychiatrists called to witness were excellent. And the sailor who was so nervous he was massaging his cover while on the stand was great too. I could go on and on. Sorry for rambling.  The final scene where the defense attorney was drunk was vastly superior to the original.
