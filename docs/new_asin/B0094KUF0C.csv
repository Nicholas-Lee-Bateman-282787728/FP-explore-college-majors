Watching early tv with its limitations in technologic areas such as equipment ,staging,and general production has shown us how far tv(cable,streaming etc) has progressed. OR HAS IT REALLY. WHEN WATCHING THESE EARLY SHOWS I SEE GREAT HEARTFELT SCRIPTS WRITTEN BY WRITERS( IE: ROD SERLING) WHO ARE SAYING SOMETHING MUCH MORE INTIMATE TO THE VIEWER. THE ACTORS WERE SO BELIEVABLE HAVING US HANG ON EVERY WORD AND GESTURE.THESE WERE GREAT STORIES.YES, IN THE EARLY DAYS  TV  HAD A BIG ISSUE WITH CENSORSHIP AND THE SPONSORS PERSONAL AGENDAS. TODAY WE HAVE ""REALITY"" TV Which seems to be manipulated by producers to create conflict. As if we already didn't have enough in our own every day reality. Sports is much more fun to watch on the ""set"" today . In fact I don't want to go out in 30 weather to watch football when I get to see all the action from five different angles at three different speeds. Can't beat that if your a sports fan. I now can see weather reports with the green screen maps which show in which direction there is a 60% chance of showers with the animated clouds rolling by. Is the weather broadcasted more accuratly today .Of course it is..The weather is presented by the women with the best cleavage. There seems to be a selling point gor watching the weather report. When I want to know the weather I want the weather not a fantasy. I save that for people with whom I can actually have a conversation. The tv celebrities of the past were for the most part trained stage actors first. Their performances reflected that training. The writers wrote for the everyday person and their everyday issues. Today there is such a selection of comedy shows ,some of which are very funny. Drama is great today with Masterpiece theatre. Ken Burns gives a great peak into the past. We know learn about this is an amazing planet and how we are destroying it in the name of progress. I can't watch any show today that has commercials without wondering which pharmaceutical company should be sued next. There are all the pros and cons of todays box but  very little can touch what was offered in the days of playhouse 90 .Those were NOT really simplier times we just weren't told all day how bad it really is. And we were not asked to watch  the next installment of girlfriends finding out that their husbands have been cheating on them with their sister. Thats right you can turn the channel and see how you can beat cancer through drug therapy, or meditation , and all the new antioxidants that no one knew about 5 years ago. If they did know then why was it kept it a secret. Hum.
I truly believe the early days of tv tried to touch us ,let us know through the dramas that we all have conflicts and at the same time entertain us with great story plots fine actors and lousy commercials The dream kitchens !!! Almost as bad as the class action suit commercials of today. Dangerous drugs shouldnt be on the market anyway.
 By the way there are wonderful actors and great shows today . It's just more difficult to find them. So if you get a chance and can watch a show without cgi than this is a good place to start. Just remember the physical pucture is not even close to todays hd.",1488758400,,3245,4.465430016863406

8535989,4,B0094KUF0C,"Written by Rod Serling, Bombers Moon is the story of an American Bomber wing stationed in England in 1943. The lead character, Col. Culver, played by Robert Cummings, is cold and unemotional, and conflict arises between the colonel and one of his pilots whom the colonel feels is a coward.

All the actors gave excellent performances (Rip Torn, Martin Balsam, and Hazel Court), but especially Robert Cummings.  I have always thought he was underrated as a dramatic actor.  I think it is noteworthy that he was a pilot/flight instructor (US Army Air Corp) during WWII  and an officer in the US Air Force Reserve.

The only problem I had was the quality of the disc.  The picture was not sharp.",1389916800,8,692,4.725
