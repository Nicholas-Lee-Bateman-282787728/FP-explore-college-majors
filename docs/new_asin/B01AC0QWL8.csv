7597305,5,B01AC0QWL8,"Sword Art Online is what got me into anime. Started off as a curiosity, but when it showed up on netflix I dared to watch it - and instantly fell in love with the characters and their relationships. I recommend this to any and everyone. Also this does include the Second 'season' Sword Art Online II - which is what I'd hoped.",1459987200,10,326,4.274193548387097

7597307,5,B01AC0QWL8,"One of the most original series in a while. Sword Art Online combines the best in fantasy, technology, and romance, and splices them together in one cohesive package. And if you are an RPG gamer like me... This story WILL resonate with you. Mostly due to the fact that with todays technology and the speed at which it advances, this scenario could feasibly happen in the near future.....
Season 1..
The year is 2022 and ten thousand people log in to SAO, a newly released, much anticipated VRMMORPG (Virtual Reality Multi-Media Online Role Playing Game) only to find out at the end of the day they can not log out.....They are trapped inside this virtual world, a floating city of dungeons known as Aincrad, with only one way out...Beat the game by defeating the Boss on each of the games 100 dungeon levels.... The only catch... If the players Avatar dies in the game the person behind the Avatar dies IRL (In Real Life) and any attempt to remove the player from the game by disconnecting the nerve gear the player is wearing IRL will also result in the players death. The story follows the adventures of Kirito, a former beta tester and solo player, and Asuna, a high ranking official in the Knights of the Blood Oath guild. As they try to clear the game, those trapped inside must learn to survive and create new lives, as they battle the monsters in the game, and murderous players as well. Morality, loyalty, friendship, loss, and love are explored as the intrepid and determined pair try to find themselves, without losing hope. After two years, the question is ""When is it not just a game anymore....?, and, What would you sacrifice for the one you love?""
Season 2...
Kirito has returned to the VRMMORPG world with a mission.... Find a man named Death Gun and stop him. A new game has emerged called Gun Gale and the player known as Death Gun seems to have the power of SOA in that his in game victims die IRL...... Who is this evil character, how is he doing it, and what is his plan...? That's what Kirito must find out... Putting his life on the line, he enters the Bullet of Bullets Tournament in the hopes of finding out who the killer is and stop him before he can kill again. Aided by a new companion, a sniper known as Sinon, failure could spell death.....

This is the series that brought me back into the Anime world after almost 30 years.... Long gone are the days of Thundercats, He-Man, Transformers, and G.I. Joe.... and, outside of DragonBall Z, I had not watched much in the way of anime until Netflix recommended SAO after watching Harlock: Space Pirate over two years ago.... Since then I have watched everything from Spice and Wolf to Aquarion, High School Dxd to Phantom: Requiem of the Phantom, Trinity Blood to Infinite Stratos and, even Knights of Sidonia..... 300+ titles in all, and I still come back to SAO...... Now it is available in full English dub including the Extra Edition OVA that I refer to as Yui's Whale (Even though that particular part of the OVA is only one episode)....... And at a price that is not SO unreasonable for a 2 Season set.... Granted I purchased this from a Malaysian vendor six months ago for less,.....but, it is good to see it is now available from a U.S. based source..... as it took 40+ days from my order date to receive mine....(U.S. Customs?)...... Anyway..... This one is worth having.....",1457049600,9,3360,4.5813953488372094

7597320,2,B01AC0QWL8,"I am going to start by saying that if you were expecting the show to be anything like Gantz for example you are barking up the wrong tree. But before going into that I will start with the positive. The animation in it was really well done. I will say that anyway. Now onto the negatives. One the show lacked action. When it was in it it wasn't very climatic. And to me it would have worked a lot better two if it would have contained graphic violence. The first season had the suspense of people actually dying for real when there subconscious was in the game. But in the second arc where they were in the fairy world was really weak since nobody could die for real. And the third arc which brought guns into it which I had high hopes for since I am a gun collector myself lacked big time. They should have had it where people in there were dying for real and that you had real life military personnel such as US Marines to fight the evil and maybe real life terrorists in it like ISIS who entered the game and were killing people for real to wipe people out that way and to further spread terror. To me it would have helped more two if the main character was not a teen but someone in there late 20's on to 40's who was a hardened war vet like Rambo or a reluctant hero like John Mcclane. Because the main character was pretty week. He lacked maturity in a lot of ways. And the main girl started out as tough but eventually went from tuff to a cliched damsel in distress, And the first season you had the whole plot of the two of them getting married in the game world they are trapped in and are hip to hip attached but yet when they entered the real world again in the second season all of that went away as if it never happened. You would have thought they would have at least promissed when they got a few years older to marry each other or move in at the least. Plus you had the main guy talk about himself in the game world when he is in the real world and talking about considering that his real self in the real world as far as being a soldier. If that is the case then why the hell didn't he look into using his skills for real and eventually join the Japanese Self Defense Force or the Federal Police Agency's elite tactical unit known as the Special Assault Team or S.A.T. for short? Or got dual citizenship with USA and join the United States marine Corps or United States Army and go around the world as a commando to make the world a better place? That is why I compare it to Gantz. Gantz is what this series should have been like. They should have been fighting for there life for real where it was like I said like in Gantz or the Matrix trilogy for example. If you are like me and like graphic violence and lots of climatic action in it with really cool military like characters. Then by all means don't waste your time on this series. I wish I hadn't. I had high hopes and they were disappointed.  And like some others have said on other websites that the other male characters in it were so one dimensional with no characterization it was unreal. They didn't grow as characters at all. In Gantz for example and especially the Manga's the main guy in those Kurono went from being a cowardly self centered jerk to being a very courageous and self sacrificing military like leader not much different than legendary US Marine General Louis ""Chesty"" Puller. My recommendations instead if this garbage are Gantz, Elfen Lied, Black Lagoon, Golgo 13 and Crying Freeman. Now those are worth your time watching. Please watch those instead.",1471219200,,3549,4.28125

8746983,5,B01AC0QWL8,"This is an awesome set. Definitely a must for fans of the series. There are some oddities, menus are partially in English, and mostly in Japanese. It does not remember where you left off and you have to select English for audio if you eject the disc. It also locks up in fast forward.  The bonus episodes are in English but the extra stuff are in Japanese (recap of events as a news program).",1525046400,,392,4.297297297297297
8746984,3,B01AC0QWL8,This SAO (Sword Art Online) series DVD from other country and yes it work on America DVD player expect some select on the series not working unless you play fast foward or skip during play will work. This not 100% meet my expect but still good cause I am fan of this anime. Thanks,1513641600,,280,4.203703703703703
8746985,1,B01AC0QWL8,"I got this because I love SAO!  I looked and looked and couldn't find an official copy, so I got this.  However there are many things that make me think this isn't official.
1- The Video quality has some skips,  like when there are a lot of things moving, you see glitches around the moving objects.
2- It only has one language.  Because I live in the US I only have the English language on the discs for audio.  EVERY other anime I have bought has Japanese and English for audio, and often English subtitles.
3- Most anime I have purchased ( and I have dozens ) run from 4-5 episodes per disc, this is for the menus ( those menus take a TON of room when done right.  Like 1 GB each disc. ).  These people fit one season per disc.  2 seasons should be around 8 discs AT A MINIMUM!

Overall, I could make this set, if I had streamed it from a site that didn't watermark their videos, that is what it looks like, downloaded copies.
(That would also explain the one language.)",1504742400,4,973,4.188172043010753

8746988,5,B01AC0QWL8,The DVD set arrived earlier than expected! All the discs are working and are great quality condition.  This provides you with the English dub of both Season 1 and Season 2. A great gift for any fan of anime and of Sword Art Online! Now to watch the series all over again in English dubbed ,1501027200,,289,4.236363636363636
8746989,5,B01AC0QWL8,"If you like games then, you'll like this because it's an Anime about games, which to me is the best of both worlds (Anime & video games). I actually previously bought parts 1-4 of this series before I bought this & I definitely recommend that you buy this item that's listed instead of parts 1-4 like I did because not only do you get all of the episodes that I've seen on Toonami (2 seasons), but it also is the same price as each of the parts 1-4 (1 season), so to me it's a better deal to get this item.",1498608000,,506,4.01980198019802

8746991,4,B01AC0QWL8,"I love sword art online and when I saw this I just had to get it! The dvds are good, from what I can tell a couple episodes on season 2 are muffled, but I was still able to hear it and one episode on the same season kept skipping at the very end of the episode, but it might just need a good cleaning. Other than that! I would give it 5 stars. Also it is the complete series, the one episode that is ""missing"" on season 2 is not exactly an episode, its just a recap on what has happened so far, so don't worry! Its the complete series!",1495238400,2,535,3.828828828828829
