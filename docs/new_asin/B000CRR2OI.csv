8101116,4,B000CRR2OI,"this is a review of the collector's edition box set packaging, not a review of the anime itself. the packaging is really nice, it's a sturdy chipboard box that holds 3 volumes, each volume comes with a art pamphlet and art card. hope this helps anyone who wants to know what this set is like, also if you want to see video of this set then here is a link to a showcase i did  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFxUqjMwyKA",1438819200,,419,4.5131578947368425
8101117,2,B000CRR2OI,"this anime was not that fun to watch,it was not well made. Also the speaking of death made me not like it. So i give it 2 stars.",1356134400,,128,3.607142857142857
8101118,5,B000CRR2OI,I became a fan of Kannazuki no Miko through a torrent and the dvd was well worth the money. The collectors box is very nice looking with a simple yet beautiful design that has all the main good guys and bad guys on it. The shell necklace is of good quality but could break if your not careful. It's not a real shell but it's made out of something that feels similar to one. The dvd I found easy and simple to navigate. The title menu was short (IMO) and simple. It was easy to read too. I really suggest this if you want the dvd because the extras make it worth the extra money. I'd give it and A+++,1173484800,2,599,4.0
8101119,5,B000CRR2OI,"Well, I love this series to death, there's nothing wrong with it... But... I didn't get a DVD in my box kit.  Was I supposed to?  I remember this was the link I clicked on to order it, because I had it in my favorites, just in case I closed the window.  This is about the third order I made on Amazon where I did not get a DVD with my order.  So, do any of you know a way I can possibly get a DVD without having to pay 20 dollars all over again?",1152921600,,445,3.6526315789473682
8101120,3,B000CRR2OI,"Unknown to us, there is a shrine on the moon and it has been prophesied that if this shrine is ever destroyed a great evil will be let loose on Earth. This great evil is the god Orochi and he will move quickly to destroy the only two girls who can lock him up again: the Solar and Lunar Priestesses! Orochi is not going to dirty his own claws to do the job though. Instead, he will employ the ""Eight Necks"", 8 humans of different walks of life, whose Orochi genes are activated and are able to pilot demonic mecha! These Necks have been genetically predisposed to have an uncontrollable drive to kill the Priestesses, who just happen to be two high school girls named Himeko and Chikane. Both girls are unaware of their functions in the cosmic order, but are great friends, even with their totally different backgrounds. Chikane is a rich girl living a life of luxury and is the queen of the school, while Himeko is clumsy, had a bad childhood, and is a nobody on campus. Things only get worse for Himeko when the first Neck to be activated and attempt to kill her turns out to be her old friend Souma! He is able to fight against his programming and saves the girl's lives in a mecha battle, but protecting the girl he loves(?) from other Orochi and himself is going to be a tall order as Himeko and Chikane must learn how to use their powers on the fly.

I liked the character interactions in this show. The lesbian overtones between Himeko and Chikane set up a weird but interesting love triangle with the two of them and Souma. Of course Himeko doesn't have a clue that Chikane has deeper feelings for her. Souma too is oblivious to Chikane but too aware of his own. Even though he doesn't come out and say it, his obsessive vow to protect Himeko reveals more than he lets on. I wonder how all these relationships are going to work out? Two things that brought the show down were the Necks and mecha. The Eight Necks are some of the most goofy evil entities I've ever seen. For example, one is a catgirl in a nurse outfit! I mean, how threatening is that? Another Neck is....oh my....a manga artist! Oh, the horror!  And how come the ""Gods"" have to fight with mecha?  They almost seem like homeless characters that were kicked off another anime because they were too stupid-looking or cliched. What kind of supreme deity has to use mecha, and especially ones with pilots who stereotypically scream out their attacks? The mecha battles in this show are pretty pathetic. They've already destroyed Himeko's village three times over, but everybody is just carrying on life as usual. It would be like Godzilla attacking Tokyo every day. Why don't these people move away? And there's hardly a hint of Japanese military forces responding to or at least investigating all these battling robots! If there were no mecha in this anime, it would have been better.

The only extra on the dvd was a clean opening. My copy came with a mini-pencil board featuring Himeko and Chikane with Souma's mech in the background.

If you like this show other anime I would recommend would be: Gravion, Rahxephon, Evangelion, Scrapped Princess.",1149638400,4,3121,4.566071428571429

Chances are that if you come looking for this title, you already know what its about, and you already want it. Just in case you stumbled on this by chance, however, I'll fill you in on a bit.

The animation is beautiful, the music is lovely, and there is plenty mecha, action, and angrily shouted 'special moves' to satisfy most of the mech/sci-fi anime lovers...not to mention fan-service as the editorial review lets on. I've noted that Geneon left out subtitling some of the written japanese words (signs, papers) which takes out some of the jokes from when I've seen this fan-subbed...that was a bit dissapointing, but the English voice acting is fairly decent.

This is one of those animes that you either love it or you hate it, I've seen plenty of reviews on both sides. First of all...it is 'Shoujo Ai/Yuri'...basically a lesbian love story. That particular story line is the main story line couched in a mythological mecha setting. If you're homophobic, don't buy this DVD...you'll be dissapointed. If you won't mind a tragic love story played out between two girls in a fantasy/sci fi mecha world, than you should probably enjoy this. I know I did. The end (what will be Volume three when it is released domestically) had me crying.",1148169600,9,1267,4.802752293577981
