4495830,4,B004XKVRBE,"This 3rd volume of the delightfully kitsch Brave and the Bold series delivers more of that ""Bam"" ""Pow"" ""Whiz"" action that typefied superhero comics of the 50s and 60s. It's hard to imagine that in the age of gritty, urban interpretations of Batman being the most prominent in the media (Dark Knight and Arkham Asylum video game), that there would even be room for a show as zany as this one.
But this show comes as a great and welcomed counter point to those more heavyily weighted efforts because it reminds viewers that the Caped Crusader can and is able to have a little more fun now and again. Plus if your a Batman fan and a parent then this is the perfect show to share with your young children. It's safe yet exciting enough to keep both adults and kids entertained.
Understanding Batman fans will see that Batman is still depicted as the serious and competant detective/adventurer that he always essentially was, but his antics and methods are enhanced in the only way a cartoon could showcase them. His tools and gagdets are incredibly cool and advanced and his skills seem endless. This guy knows everything!
A few key episodes are Death Race to Oblivion which is a favorite and Chill of the Night which actually sees this Batman at his ""darkest"" as he trys to investigate the whereabouts of his parents' murderer. Other greats are Sidekicks Assemble where the sidekicks of the main heroes investigate a case involving Ra's Al Ghul and his daughter Talia.
A recommended buy for anyone one who enjoys the zanies of old comics from time to time and of course all things Batman.",1315699200,4,1585,4.664285714285715
4495831,4,B004XKVRBE,"Batman continues to protect Gotham City and beyond in Batman: The Brave and the Bold - Season Two, Part One. Batman (Diedrich Bader) is the World's Greatest Detective, but even he's not above a little superhero help battling such villains likes Gorilla Grodd, Ra's Al Ghul and Black Adam. In this collection of 12 action-packed episodes, Blue Beetle, Aquaman, Plastic Man, Firestorm, Captain Marvel, Detective Chimp, Vixen, Bwana Beast, the Metal Men and the Justice Society of America come to Batman's aid against the forces of evil, but do Earth's greatest heroes have what it takes to stop the intergalactic menace known as Starro and its herald, the Faceless Hunter? Batman will also finally face the criminal responsible for the deaths of his parents. Based on the comic book series published by DC Comics, this light adaptation offers an amusing mix of old-school comic book action and refreshing humor. The 2-disc DVD set includes such standout episodes like Death Race to Oblivion!, Aquaman's Outrageous Adventure!, The Golden Age of Justice!, Sidekicks Assemble!, The Super-Batman of Planet X!, The Power of Shazam! and Chill of the Night!.

Though I wasn't pleased that the two-part finale of the Great Starro Invasion story arc wasn't included, the latest 2-disc DVD release of Batman: The Brave and the Bold is still a worthy addition to your superhero collection at a decent bargain price. As with the previous discs, the first 12 episodes of the second season of animated series are presented 1.78:1 widescreen format. The video transfer is bright and colorful, and its 2.0 Dolby Digital audio is pretty solid. Besides the trailers of the new animated series Green Lantern: The Animated Series and Thundercats, there are no special features. Overall, Batman: The Brave and the Bold: Season Two, Part One scores a ""B-"".",1314662400,6,1832,5.1066666666666665
4495832,5,B004XKVRBE,"While season 1 had the Owlman episodes, ""Legends of the Dark Mite"" and ""Mayhem of the Music Meister"", this set has the best episodes out of the whole series available on DVD. The weakest episodes are ""Death Race to Oblivion"", which is ok (Batman's a bit of a jerk until the very end when his plan is revealed) and ""Gorilla's in Our Midst"", which is just a rehash of every Grodd episode (except featuring Gorilla Boss, Mesiuer Mallah, Det. Chimp, B'wanna Beast and Vixen). Episodes that establish more character and backstory are ""Long Arm of the Law"" featuring Plastic Man and his family. It also continues a plot point established last season in ""Terror On Dinosaur Island"". ""Revenge of the Reach"" has Blue Beetle battling his armor as it attempts to take over his mind and body to destroy the Green Lantern Corp. ""Sidekicks Assemble"" features Robin, Aqualad and Speedy, who wish to grow from the shadows of their mentors (though only Robin really develops). ""Clash of the Metal Men"", ""A Bat Divided"" and ""The Power of Shazam"" are fun episodes and introduce the Metal Men and Firestorm to the series (Captain Marvel first appeared in the teaser to ""Death Race to Oblivion"") and they'll prove useful in the first two episodes of the next set.

However the best episodes I saved for the last; ""Aquaman's Outrageous Adventure"" is the character's best appearance so far. It's hilarious seeing him want to escape his vacation and fight crime with his friends (his first phone conversation with Batman and him seeing the Sportsmaster in a similar situation are great). ""The Golden Age of Justice"" features the first appearance of the Justice Soceity of America (at least the group since Wildcat and Flash made appearances last season) and it's fun seeing the precursor to the Justice League along with how they trained Batman and Black Canary. ""The Super-Batman of Planet X"" is an adaptation of a comic from the fifties (you can read it in the compilation ""Batman in the '50s"") and while it's fun seeing Batman act like Superman, it's also noteworthy since it features Kevin Conroy (as the other Batman), Dana Delany as Vilsi Vaylar (a Lois Lane/Vicky Vale combo) and Clancy Brown as Rohtul (he was also the voice of Per Degaton in ""The Golden Age of Justice"").

And last but certainly not least is ""Chill of the Night"", possibly the finest and darkest episode this series has put out but let me explain something; while I love Batman: The Animated Series (and believe me, it will never be topped as the definitive interpretation of Batman and his supporting characters) along with the rest of the DCAU and the Burton/Schumacher/Nolan/DCU films, this series' approach to Batman works because its so different. It's fun, has a sense of humor and most importantly, it's a treasure trove of DC Comics' history! There's only so many times you can do the ""dark, serious"" approach and make it different, at least to me anyways. And the producers prove with this episode that this show can do dark, emotional episodes. Even my sister was surprised by how dark this episode was compared to the rest of the series! Deidrich Bader does a great job as does the guest cast and next to ""The Super-Batman of Planet X"", it's one of the best. Kevin Conroy returns as the Phantom Stranger, Mark Hamill as the Spectre, Richard Moll as Moxon (and also reprises his Two-Face role for a bit), Jennifer Hale reprising Zatanna but also Adam West and Julie Newmar as Thomas and Martha Wayne (I hope the producers are able to get them again, it fits having them voice his parents).

Again the show is just fantastic and while B:TAS may be the best version of Batman, this interpretation has now tied with it as my favorite (but I wouldn't be surprised if it nudges its way to be my all-time favorite). Sadly it will be ending this year only for a new, more serious Batman cartoon to begin. A part of me knows that I'll watch and more than likely enjoy it, but I can't help but feel it'll just be an inferior carbon copy to B:TAS. Can't wait for Season 2, Part 2!",1314144000,2,4032,4.6840620592383635
4495833,4,B004XKVRBE,"This superb series is even better in season two and deserves Five Stars. The package deserves only four stars because, unlike its predecessors, it is not packaged in a protective outer case. This may seem picky however, it breaks the visual continuity of the displayed sets. I do agree that it is a bit overpriced for half of a season although, I would have purchased it had it been twice the price. Unfortunately, the public is taken advantage of when shows are released in partial seasons. The only reason for this is to make greater profits. If the majority of consumers would simply not buy such sets this tactic would eventually be discontinued. I intend to be more disciplined in this respect in the future.",1314057600,2,713,4.712
4495834,5,B004XKVRBE,"If you are a fan of the old school 50's style Batman (drawn by Dick Sprang)and If you love any of the Silver Age characters,this is a trip down memory lane!  I can't understand how this show could be cancelled after only three seasons.  I hope there is a last minute reprive by the the Cartoon Network.  No where could you find such classic characters. The best episode of the bunch is ""Chill of the Night"".  Adam West voices Batman's father in this episode.  Bruce wayne goes back in time to see that his father inadvertantly inspired his costume.  I wish Adam West had more roles in this show because there are so many Silver Age characters that were never seen.  The other team ups include The Justice Society of America, Plastic Man, Firestorm, Captiain Marvel and even The Bwana Beast.

It's a fun show that your family can watch without any uncompfortable moments.  I was hoping the public would embrace this new version that's less dark and more like the Adam West style of Batman.  These cartoons are so well produced they are good for multiple viewings. The overall look of the show is much better than the original Batman:The Animated Series.  It utilizes more in the way of computer graphics. All in all it's great fun and if you are a comics fan like myself, you'll buy this one.",1313625600,11,1291,4.545454545454546
4495835,5,B004XKVRBE,"First things first, Batman: The Brace and the Bold is an enjoyable series that goes mostly with the Silver Age Batman and other DC heroes while having a lot of fun.  It's campier stuff done right and season 2 saw continued improvement over season 1 - already a great show at the start.  James Tucker deserves credit for guiding this series and making it one of the best comic book TV shows ever.  This season builds on some classic comics (like The Super-Batman of Planet X) and does a great job building up to The Siege of Starro to end the first half of the season.  If you want a fun super hero show with some heavier moments thrown in occasionally (but handled very well - The Chill of the Night being a prime example of this, dealing with Thomas and Martha Wayne's deaths) then try this out.

As for those that keep popping up complaining about the pricing and how WB has divided up a season, the complaints are silly.  The original B:TB&TB packaging was a money grab, but the 13 episode sets are the same size as those for The Batman and other WB shows.  I think they decided to go for smaller, less expensive sets over 4-disc sets that would run around $25 for starters.  You'll eventually be able to find this for $10 for 13 episodes, but even now it's a good deal.  So I'd suggest it best to not pay attention to the complaints and enjoy a great show.",1313452800,2,1360,4.322834645669292
4495836,5,B004XKVRBE,"The following is my personal top 10 list of the very best
""Batman: Brave And The Bold"" episodes. I love The countdown begins at number#10 onto episode number #1. Please also take note that these are the top ten ""main plots"" which
""excludes"" the opening teaser sequences. After this I'll
list a separate top ten for the teasers. There are many
great episodes. So this wasn't easy. My personal tribute of one of Batman's greatest moments and one of the very best animated series ever. I'll be sorry to see it end. However,  let's give it a go and see if anyone agrees with my choices...

10) ""THE SUPER-BATMAN OF PLANET X""

Main plot: After Batman and Green Arrow go up against
some heavy duty space pirates, Batman gets sucked into
a wormhole, sending him to the distant planet, Zur-En-Arrh.
There, in the city of Gothropolis, he meets his doppleganger,
The Batman of Zur-En-Arrh. Even more amazing is Earth's
Batman's newly discovered superpowers, which he acquires on this strange world, that imitate a very familiar ""Man Of Steel"".

Episode quote: Citizens Of Zur-En-Arrh: ""Look, up in the sky! It's a Zanna bird, it's an air car...no, it's Batman!

Why it's cool?
  Not even going into the fact of having a Batman with super
powers ~ that, and the story based on a very wild silver age
DC book ~ but it also features Kevin Conroy, Dana Delany,
and Clancy Brown returning to their respective characters
with a fun twist. Oh, and having that little classic 1960s
Filmation nod of having Super-Batman slamming his fist
into that on-coming asteroid was a pure joy to behold. Seeing the two Bat-men meet for the first time is a landmark to be sure.

9) ""SHADOW OF THE BAT""

Main plot: Batman is bitten by a vampire called, Dala. After
which, Batman, himself, now becomes a vampire. After ""sucking
up"" to the Black Mask, (*and Bruce Wayne's unsuspecting butler, Alfred*) Batman's unrelenting bloodlust then turns upon his fellow teammates of the Justice League International.

Episode quote: Vampire-Batman: (*complete with candelabra*) ""Good evening.""

Why Its Cool?
  Just the fact of Batman turning vampire would really be enough as to why this episode makes the top 10. However, there's so many other reasons to elaborate on. First off, this has got to be the creepiest of any Batman animated incarnation, ""ever"" produced, on this series, or any other Batman show. This is the one that makes a grand stand play at saying, ""NOT FOR CHILDREN"". Even with it's comedy relief bits ~ complements of Bat's teammates ~ the pure evil and horror of Batman's supernatural transformation remains deadly serious almost throughout the entire episode. When Batman sucks the neck of Black Mask it sounds grotesquely real. A very frightening and bizarre episode that I would not recommend to the faint of heart. Oh, but what a ground-breaking classic this is.

8) ""Sidekicks Assemble""

Main Plot: Superhero Sidekicks, Robin, Speedy, and Aqualad are fed up with being bossed around and being treated like children by they're mentors, Batman, Green Arrow, and Aquaman. Needing to finally prove their own mettle, the teens go on a personal mission of taking down Batman's most powerful foe, Ras' al Ghul.

Episode quote: Aqualad: ""We're tired of being treated like second class superheroes.""

Why It's Cool?
  The sidekicks finally get their due as the `Teen Titans"" are introduced into the show. We also get to see Ras' al Ghul and Talia for the first time as well. To top it all off, Robin makes the transition into Nightwing at the conclusion. Great lines and chemistry amongst the characters. Oh, and the nod to the classic Superfriends ""Hall Of Justice"" is hilarious.

7) ""Trials Of The Demon""

Main plot: Batman is brought back to 19th century London through a spell conjured up by Jason Blood (*alter ego of Etrigan; The Demon*).
Jason's been framed by Jim Craddock who's been stealing innocent souls due to a pact of immortality made with a demon called Astaroth.
Batman not only teams up with Etrigan to stop Craddock's evil plan, but also comes face to face with that other ""world's greatest detective"", Sherlock Holmes.

Episode quote: Batman: ""Sherlock Holmes, I presume.""

Sherlock Holmes: (astonished) ""How did you deduce my
  identity so quickly?""

Batman: ""The hat.""

Why It's Cool?
  This episode features the origin Jim Craddick's ""Gentleman Ghost"", while also introducing ""Etrigan; The Demon"" into the series. But the real kicker here is the meeting ""and"" teaming up of Batman and Sherlock Holmes. It's done in a way which provides clever wit and admiration between the two rival legendary detectives. A milestone to be sure and an episode not to be missed.

6) ""The Knights Of Tomorrow""

Main Plot:
  In this episode, we find a future Batman marrying Catwoman. They end up having a son, naming him Damian (*no, not any Omens here*). In the meantime, ex-Robin, Dick Grayson, takes on the new mantle of Batman, while Bruce Wayne goes into retirement. During this time, Bruce takes it upon himself to train a reluctant Damian, hoping son shall grow up to be like father someday. When the old ~ and thought dead ~ Joker introduces a new and younger protg' Joker into Gotham city, all hell brakes loose and Damian's parents, both the original Batman & Catwoman, are killed in the process. It's now up to a vengeful Damian to finally take up the mantle of Robin and beyond.

Episode quote: Robin: (addressing old Joker) ""Guess you missed the announcement, Joker, there's a new Robin in town too.""

Old Joker: Ha, ha... Well, aren't you precious.""

Why It's Cool?
  Any episode that involves The Joker only serves to give the story an extra boost. But more than that, we're given a glimpse into a possible future reality (*ala elseworlds*) where Batman finally finds the happiness that's so long eluded him only to have his past come back and haunt him one last time. This episode also pays tribute to recent Grant Morrison comic continuity where an actual real life Damian is introduced as the new Robin while Dick Grayson, does indeed, takes on the mantle of The Bat.

5) ""Emperor Joker""

Main Plot:
  Batmite, Batman's biggest fan from the 5th dimension, whisks The Joker away from Arkham Asylum ~ along with some henchmen ~ to stage a battle between Batman and his greatest foe. During the scuffle, Batmite accidentally transfers all of his god-like powers into The Joker.
With this, Joker goes on killing Batman, then bringing him back to life over and over and over again.

Episode quote: Harley Quinn: (speaking to Joker) ""Ain't you gonna take his mask off and find out who he his?""

Joker: ""And reduce my primal enemy into a mere man? Harley, my dear, I'm so disappointed in you.""

Why It's Cool?
  This is truly the episode that separates the men from the boys. Witnessing The Dark Knight actually being killed, in such vivid grotesque detail again and again, instantly reminds one just how far we've all come from cartoons such as ""Superfriends"".  Aside from that, it stands as a wonderful Joker tale with tons of inside gags and references to classic Batman/ Joker comic stories. When Batmite's involved in a show, then anything's possible and this one takes it to the limit. As an extra bonus, the show introduces it's own unique version of Joker's infamous sidekick, Harley Quinn. Although far removed from the classic version we're all familiar with in ""Batman: TAS"", this Harley's still a delight and only adds even more spice to an already incredible episode.

4) ""The Color Of Revenge""

Main Plot: After moving to the city, Bloodhaven, Dick Grayson (Robin) tries to distance himself and break free of his over-shadowing association with The Dark Knight, working to become his own man. However, when Robin's arch- nemesis, Crazy Quilt, goes seeking revenge on The Teen Wonder, Batman ventures into Bloodhaven, taking it upon himself to team-up with Robin one last time?

Episode quote: Robin: ""Please, not the sidecar.""

Batman: ""I thought you liked the sidecar.""

Robin: ""Yeah, when I was eight.""

Why It's Cool?
  From the very beginning of any Batman series we all wait in anticipation of Robin's introduction into the show. It's really inevitable. In this case, it couldn't get any better. Never has Batman been so clueless as to Robin wanting to do it all on his own and simply be left alone. References to the classic Adam West series abound here, while the show's villain, Crazy Quilt (along with his ""Color Guard"") ""steals"" numerous scenes. An hilarious episode with something for everyone including Robin's over-looked insecurity problem when it comes to Batman. *P.S.* When I get around to doing my top 10 ""teaser"" episodes, this show's teaser shall certainly make it into the top 5 without a doubt. Truly, one of the best.

3) ""The Battle Of The Superheroes""

Main Plot: Superman gets infected by a red kryptonite necklace that's being worn by Lois Lane who unwittingly accepts the gift from the evil Lex Luthor. The effects of the ""red"" kryptonite turns the Man Of Steel into power hungry and extremely violent tyrant. After Superman takes over city hall, proclaiming himself as ""King"" Superman, it's up to Batman to do battle with the confused Kryptonian just long enough for the negative affects of the kryptonite to wear off as well as taking down Luthor once and for all.

Episode Quote: Batman: ""Someone had to stop you, Superman.""

Superman: ""I'm only doing what I should have done long ago; take over this planet of weaklings.""

Batman: ""Not on my watch.""

Why It's Cool?
Next to Robin, only ""Superman"" is that other hero we look to see introduced into a Batman series. And not only are we treated to a classic team-up of the two legendary heroes, but a battle to rival that of the gods themselves! The classic golden age style of Superman artist, Wayne Boring was used as a model for The Man Of Steel here in the show and he never looked better.

  Another great aspect is this episode's nod to Frank Miller's immortal, ""The Dark Night Returns"" where some panels, of the book, are integrated into some of the fighting scenes between Bats and Supes. We're also introduced to Supe's inner family circle of Lois, Jimmy, and Perry White. And if that wasn't enough, they throw in Krypto, Candor, ""and"" The Fortress Of Solitude as well. In addition, there are many references to the classic ""Filmation Superman"" and live-actions, ""Adventures Of Superman"" which starred George Reeves from the 1950s. It's fair to say they threw in everything ""plus"" the kitchen sink. Truly, this show is a comic fan's dream come true. A helluva way to kick off season 3 and destined to become a classic in it's own rite.

2) ""Deep Cover For Owl Man"" Part 1
  ""Game Over For Owlman"" Part 2

Main Plot: In this two part episode, Batman is called upon by superhero; ""The Red Hood"", a counterpart of Batman's greatest enemy, The Joker from a parallel earth, in order top stop the infiltration of Batman's world by parallel earth's ""Injustice Syndicate"". The Syndicate is comprised by villainous alternate versions of  Batman (Owlman), Green Arrow (Blue Bowman), Blue Beetle (Scarlet Scarab), and Red Tornado (Silver Cyclone). After battling and defeating his counterpart, Owlman, Batman takes on Owlman's identity, traveling to alternate earth in hopes of stopping The Syndicate from going through with their plan of invading earth. Batman eventually teams up with The Red Hood, defeating the villains, thus ending their evil scheme. Upon returning to his own earth, Batman soon discovers that he's a wanted man with a reward on his head. It seems that while Batman was away  taking care of business on alternate earth, Owlman had escaped, masquerading as Batman and going on a crime spree. After being hunted by the police ""and"" superheroes alike, Batman soon runs into his arch nemesis, The Joker.

After rationalizing that ""The Clown Prince Of Crime"" might be that extra edge he needs in order to defeat his alternate earth counterpart, Batman forms a temporary and uneasy alliance with the villain as long as Joker promises not to kill anyone during the process.  After chases and near misses, Joker ~ in the end ~ betrays Batman to Owlman and his recruited gang of villains. However, Batman takes a ride to several alternate earths, bringing back ""heroic"" counterpart Batmen to help save the day and defeating Owlman once and for all.

Episode Quote: Batman: (pointing to dashboard of Batmobile) ""Brake, choke, throttle.""

Joker: ""Ooooh, my kinda fun.""

Why It's Cool?
This is the show that introduces ""The Joker"" for the very first time in the series. And what a classic Dick Sprang Joker he turns out to be. Naturally, any animated Joker, after Mark Hammill's unforgettable characterization of the character, will forever be closely inspected by the fans (including yours truly) and critics alike. However, this newest incarnation of Joker certainly takes center stage in excellent composition, along with clever charm and dark wit. In addition we're served an array of interesting alternate heroes and villains, including an evil doppelganger Batman, ""Owlman"". (I've sometimes wondered what an evil Batman would be like) This show also boasted a two part episode with nods to the 1960sAdam West Batman show, as well as to the 1989 Batman/ Michael Keaton film. We also find cameo DC ""elseworlds"" counterparts of Batman making their very first debuts off the comic book pages. (see how many you can name after watching the episode) All this, and a extremely rare teaming up of Batman and The Joker simply equals ""pure Bat-gold"".

1) ""Chill Of The Night""

Main Plot: Upon being closely watched by The Spectre and The Phantom Stranger, Batman goes undercover to, once and for all, take down the man responsible for killing his parents, Thomas and Martha Wayne. Batman soon discovers that the man in question is an aging thug known as Joe Chill. After battling through an array of super-villains such as, Joker, Two-Face, Poison Ivy and others, Batman finally faces down his parents' killer, one on one. In a moment of tense revelation, Batman removes his cowl, revealing himself to Chill as Bruce Wayne; the son of Thomas and Martha Wayne, the people he murdered. In a panic, believing Batman would kill him, Chill runs out to find Batman's recovering foes. He attempts to tell them that it was he who murdered Batman's parents. Thus, the reason for Batman being created. The villains, in rage upon discovering this revelation, choose to kill Chill, holding him responsible for the creation of Batman. However, before their able to take action, Batman appears to defeat them once again with Joe Chill accidentally being killed in the mayhem.

Episode Quote: Batman/ Bruce Wayne: ""Case Closed.""

Why It's Cool?
  So here we are at the number#1 / very best of ""Batman: Brave And The Bold"".  This episode was written by ""Batman: TAS"" alumni, Paul Dini. This episode begins with the loss of Bruce Wayne's parents and the origin of Batman. It also boasts the very best Batman cast of guest actors ever including Adam West, and Julie Newmar (Batman 1960s) along with Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill (Batman: The Animated Series). This is the episode that also reveals Bruce Wayne's face (as an adult) for the very first time. That, added in with some classic Bat villains ""and"" the final confrontation and death of Joe Chill deserves this particular episode to make it to 1st place on the list. While many episodes proved to be fun and a tad goofy, this show proved that it could also be taken in a more serious vein. Paul Dini at his very best.",1311724800,9,15542,4.876092740402888

It was fun and enjoyable, but more classic villains please! And what is with Season 2 Episode moving over to Season Three In Bonus features? That is lame.  Family Ties did that in Season 5, they added missing episodes from Season 3 and Season 4.

Isn't Superman's little menace Mxy enough? I feel that DC copies themselves too much.  One other problem I had with this box set in particular...

4495876,4,B004XKVRBE,"This was my personal favorite of the may animated Batman series made since the 80's.  It is a light-hearted but not overly campy Silver Age Batman combined with just about every major and minor super hero or super villain in the DC universe.  Even fans of the much more serious DCAU will love these.  TDK and TDKR fans may not enjoy them so much without a child or 2 present...

I hoped for some additional content with the DVD set but sadly there is none.  This is the only reason I did not give this 5 stars, however I do like that the DVD's load immediately to the DVD menu and not the obligatory commercials that can not be skipped.  I thank WB for acknowledging that we already spent the money to purchase these and deserve to be spared the advertising push.  If only more DVD distributors would take note.",1367107200,,811,4.366666666666666
4495877,5,B004XKVRBE,"Camp, fun and a great nod and love letter to the silver age way of story telling for comics.
BBATB is a show that indulges in the wacky antics of that time in comics that had fun with its source material and not take it so so seriously and make it dark and morbid.
The show does occasionally travel into serious tone stories but never loses its feeling of a show that makes uses of the greater DC Comic universe.
it uses a lot of DC Comic characters not just Batman.
We get to see a revision of Aquaman that has become a fan favorite [if only he got a spin-off] and we get golden age heroes like Plastic Man.
This exploration of the DCU is great for fans of the comics, cartoon lovers and those who just want to have fun.",1359849600,,721,4.084507042253521
4495878,4,B004XKVRBE,This show just gets better and better.  I love it.  I have been buying comics for over thirty years and this is a take on Batman that is soooo much fun.  It amazes me how much I like this and how different it is from the Batman comics and movies.,1356912000,,246,3.88

4495881,4,B004XKVRBE,"I'm a longtime Batman fan, and this one is pleasing to watch. What is particularly interesting is the old style with modern graphics. The characters act like the old days, but the series is actually quite modern. Also, you frequently think the plot is going to be obvious, but then they throw a twist in during the episode that keeps it interesting.",1353542400,,349,4.645161290322581
4495882,5,B004XKVRBE,"I bought this DVD to go along with the first season. I love the series, and so does my son. I didn't grow up reading comic books, but I've been told the series stays true to it's roots. I'll buy all of the seasons as I find them.",1325116800,,229,3.7916666666666665
4495883,5,B004XKVRBE,"You claim the Dark Knight has to be broody and sinister all the time to further his intimidating urban legend. You protest that he works best as a solo act. BATMAN:THE BRAVE AND THE BOLD, a ridiculously fun animated series, dissuades such assertions. It showcases the lighter side of Batman, plonks him in silly scenarios, even has him cracking a smile now and then. BATMAN: THE BRAVE AND THE BOLD - SEASON 2, PART 1 collects Season 2's first twelve episodes, offers more team-up fun with the truculent Gotham Detective. And while the episodes are for the most part isolated stories, attempts are made to introduce an overarching plot point, concerning the Faceless Hunter's paving the way for Starro the Conqueror's impending global invasion. Batman's familiar heroic foils are here: his friendly rival Green Arrow, his protege Blue Beetle, his adoring fan Plastic Man, and the delightfully grandiose Aquaman. But this series also spotlights DC's more neglected characters like the Metal Men, the Challengers of the Unknown, and Firestorm (who makes his debut in ""A Bat Divided"").

Of this batch, the best episodes - in my eyes, anyway - are the hilarious ""Aquaman's Outrageous Adventure!"", ""The Golden Age of Justice"" (featuring the JSA), and ""A Bat Divided"" (for the Slacker Batman moments). This DVD set comes in two discs and, disappointingly, with no bonus material. Still, twelve episodes aren't too shabby. If you harbor fond memories of Batman as he was in the Golden & Silver Ages and if you don't mind an infusion of Adam West-type wackiness and a cast of quite a lot, then what are you waiting for?

Plot synopsis for the twelve eps (and, of course, you already know that each episode begins with a teaser segment which mostly doesn't have anything to do with that episode's main narrative, right?):

- ""Death Race to Oblivion!"" - Prequel: Batman and Captain Marvel give a time out to an evil genius kid. Then, Mongol holds Earth hostage as he gathers a group of heroes and villains to compete in a death race. Heck, there's even a nod to the classic JLI Batman clocks Guy Gardner ""One punch!"" routine.

- ""Long Arm of the Law!"" - Prequel: Batman and Plastic Man on a rescue mission at a woodsy scout camp jamboree. Then, Plastic Man, his wife and son Baby Plas, and his sidekick Woozy Winks are targeted by Kite Man. As one might expect, this is one slapsticky episode.

- ""Revenge of the Reach!"" - Prequel: Batman and the Challengers of the Unknown versus a mutated giant spider on Dinosaur Island. Then, Batman, Blue Beetle, and the Green Lantern Corps face off against the Reach, an ancient marauding alien race from which the Beetle's hi-tech scarab had originated.

- ""Aquaman's Outrageous Adventure!"" - Prequel: Somehow set in World War I, Batman and Enemy Ace call off aerial hostilities to take out extraterrestrial weaponry. Then, Aquaman's family vacation keeps getting interrupted when the King of the Seven Seas insists on making stops to help out his superhero buddies. Check out Arthur Jr.'s threads, reminiscent of Aquaman's costume from Neal Pozner and Craig Hamilton's 1986 mini-series. How awesome is this episode? Four words: Aquaman driving an RV.

- ""The Golden Age of Justice!"" - Prequel: Batman and Detective Chimp solve the case of the stolen Golden Skull. Then, Batman, a feeling underappreciated Black Canary, and the old-as-dust Justice Society of America join forces to stymie Per Degaton's latest stab at world domination.

- ""Sidekicks Assemble!"" - Prequel: Squabbling kid sidekicks Robin, Aqualad, and Speedy are scolded by their mentors. Then, cut to the present, as the now teenaged (but still squabbling) sidekicks combat Ra's al Ghul and his plot to transform Earth into a primordial (and lethal to man) paradise.

- ""Clash of the Metal Men!"" - Prequel: After Batman and Aquaman net a crew of pirates, Aquaman returns to Atlantis only to find his people subjugated by Starro's clones. Then, when the Metal Men's creator, Dr. Milton Magnus, goes missing, the enthusiastic shape-shifting androids and Batman go looking.

- ""A Bat Divided!"" - Prequel: Trapped in the Riddler's game show, Booster Gold must correctly answer a series of riddles, with Batman's life hanging in the balance (except that Booster doesn't even get one answer right). Then, Doctor Double X intrudes on a science field trip held at a nuclear test lab. He accidentally ignites a nuclear reaction that splits Batman into three messed-up personalities. The meltdown also fuses a brainy student and an oafish athletic coach into one entity, giving birth to Flame Dude... er, Firestorm. This ep is worth it just to see Batman, in his slacker persona, channel Keanu Reeves and consume massive amounts of nachos and cheese.

- ""The Super-Batman of Planet X!"" - Prequel: Batman, in his ""Matches Malone"" disguise, and the Metal Men work together to thwart the predations of Kanjar Ro and his space bandits. Then, while Batman and Green Arrow are pursuing even more space pirates, Batman is sent hurtling thru a wormhole, on the other side of which is his doppelganger, the Batman of Zur-En-Arrh. Oh, and on this world, our Batman has somehow gained super powers.

- ""The Power of Shazam!"" - Prequel: Starro's emissary, the Faceless Hunter, gives us a voiceover recap, detailing his capturing of or taking out a series of heroes in preparation for Starro the Conqueror's invasion. Then, evil genius Dr. Sivana and Black Adam hatch a plot to siphon the wizard Shazam's magic, that which empowers the World's Mightiest Mortal, Captain Marvel.

- ""Chill of the Night!"" - Prequel: Batman and Zatanna close the curtain on Abra Kadabra's attempt to ransack a museum showcasing the creations of history's greatest stage magicians. Then, the Phantom Stranger and the Spectre lay a wager on Bats' plan of action when he at last meets his parents' murderer. Will he choose justice... or vengeance? You must dig this episode's special voice actors: Adam West as Thomas Wayne, Julie Newmar as Martha Wayne, Kevin Conroy as the Phantom Stranger, and Mark Hamill as the Spectre.

- ""Gorillas in Our Midst!"" - Prequel: When Professor Milo engineers rats to steal diamonds, Batman and the Spectre form a vermin-stopping duo. Then, ""The great powers of the ape world have finally put aside their differences to found G.A.S.P. - Gorillas & Apes Seizing Power!"" It's Batman, Detective Chimp, Vixen, and B'wana Beast against the hairy forces of Gorilla Grodd, Monsieur Mallah, and Gorilla Boss in a crazy bananas episode.",1324252800,6,6510,4.9880184331797235
4495884,5,B004XKVRBE,"This is a great cartoon for the whole family. If you love Batman as much as I do then you'll love this. It isn't just Batman, it's many other super heroes as well. There's PlasticMan. There's Booster Gold. There's Blue Beetle, and best of all, there's Green Arrow!",1319068800,,264,4.520833333333333
4495885,5,B004XKVRBE,"This will be the third set of this show that I have reviewed, and nothing has changed. This is still a fantastic example of why the character of Batman remains one of the most populars Superheroes to this day. Are there as many episodes on this set as there should be? No. Is it disappointing that we aren't given the option to see this in HD? Yes. Funnily enough, none of that matters. This set looks gorgeous, even in standard definition, and there is one episode in this set that is worth the, extremely low, price of admission.

Chill of the night is easily one of the best episodes of any Batman incarnation, and is a solid choice for the title of ""Best episode ever"". For all those close-minded naysayers who have passed on this excellent series because of its lighter tone, this is the episode that proves how wrong you really are. The original Batman the animated series will always be one of my favorite shows, animated or otherwise, and not a single episode in that show got to the heart of what made Bruce Wayne into Batman like this episode does. The raw emotion surprises me every time I see it.

For those who love the original series, allow me to put this in perspective. I can place ""Chill of the night"" in the same category as ""Heart of Ice"", Robin's Reckoning"", and ""Heart of Steel"". That is how good this episode is. And for those who like the lighter feel of this series, ""Aquaman's Outrageous Adventure"" is pure fun, and a joy to watch.

So if you haven't given this a chance, you will not go wrong with this set. If you already love this series, this set will confirm what you already suspected. Nobody swings the hammers of justice quite like Batman.",1316131200,,1673,4.46078431372549
