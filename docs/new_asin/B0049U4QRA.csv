8419409,1,B0049U4QRA,"This re-edit made no sense, like a film school student project that didn't get a good grade.  It took two very good films (Carnival of Souls and Night of the Living Dead) and edited them together, but not in a way that created any coherent narrative.  All the editor did was keep jumping between sequences from the different films, I guess in a way to suggest that both plotlines were in the same universe and happening concurrently.  However, he failed to tie them together, and since the originals were both feature length he couldn't make them vignettes against the same backdrop (i.e. like the original English version of Tales from the Crypt) either.  It makes me wonder what the editor was trying to do with this project.  In short, rent the original films and watch them separately; I recommend you pass on this one.",1517961600,,823,4.6875
