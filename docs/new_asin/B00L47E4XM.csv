6464693,3,B00L47E4XM,"I agree with Emily's review from 12/15/14.  The first Gabba live DVD (shot in LA at the Nokia theater) is palpably more energetic, exciting, and better in sound and performance.  This one repeats most of that one's songs and segments, albeit with different sequencing, with a few Gabba Christmas songs thrown in, and Leslie Hall doing ""Story Time"" where we had a ""Super Music Friends"" performance in the original. The performances are comparatively tired.  I can't put my finger on it but it's just not as exciting as the first live DVD.  In my opinion, the sound (2 channel stereo only) and picture are not as good as the first. I'm also convinced that some of this was shot on a sound stage, as there are lots of close-up cuts with Lance Rock looking directly into the camera and singing. This is not a big deal, but it is a pet peeve of mine (ever since realizing much of Led Zeppelin's ""Song Remains The Same"" concert footage was actually shot 6 months later on a sound stage).  There are also no bonus features, whereas the first one had a good half hour of alternate performances.

All that being said, my 3-year old son loves it and has watched it at least 5 times in 5 days. Then again, he loves anything Gabba.

Net-net, if you are deciding between this live Gabba DVD (Beacon Theater) and the other one (""Live at the Nokia Theater""), I absolutely recommend the Nokia Theater DVD over this one.",1418688000,,1403,4.521739130434782

It is a much smaller scale show and most of the songs and things are the same as the first, they just do it wearing hats and scarves instead.",1418601600,,270,4.018518518518518
