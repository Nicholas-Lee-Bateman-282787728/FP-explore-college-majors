Both with sub-title & dubbed, I preferred sub-title to get the true emotion of each character. The hero's and villain's hate for each other was believable, as was the romance of the hero and heroines. I list this, along with AKIRA, Galaxy Express 999, as one of my best owned animated movie's.

662422,2,6303481345,"The Blu-ray transfer is nice and shiny, but I really did not like the movie. I usually have no problem with edgy films (Tarantino and gory horror films come to mind), but the violence in this movie doesn't feel effective, only gratuitous. Ninja Scroll's particular brand of violence feels self-indulgent, being violent (and rapey) for the sake of being violent.
The animation is good and the cinematography/coloring is fantastic, but they are not enough to redeem the pointlessness of it all.
I've literally seen thousands of movies (yes, thousands), and this one genuinely felt annoyingly pointless to me. I can see how some people may like it - maybe it's just dated, and only those who saw it when it came out can move past its flaws.

If you had this movie recommended to you because you like Akira and Ghost in the Shell, it's not even in their ballpark. Aside from the fact that this film is well-produced (the cinematography/composition of many shots is A+), I can't recommend that you waste your time watching it.",1516752000,,1021,4.801136363636363

662553,5,6303481345,"(Spoilers following) Really beautifuly animated movies about ninjas...no not naruto or yuffie, GRITTY ninjas in the Japanese Edo period, that fight in extremely violent and bloody battles. The animation was on par with Miyazaki, though the subject matter is quite different. Basically Jubei (main charcter ninja), Kagero (female ninja that later becomes Jubei's love interest), and Dakuan (a buddhist monk who isn't all that he seems) become targeted by a clan of other ninjas working (at least initially) for the descendant of Toyoyomi Hideyoshi to make him Shogun instead of the Tokugawa clan that had power at this time. Be warned there is a rape scene, but it's to show how disgusting one of the villains is, not to glorify the act. And said villain gets what's coming to him. Lots of nudity and bloody violence in general is present; it didn't bother me but be forewarned. Also Jubei and Kagero were a nice couple. There are many emotional moments too. Avoid the TV series, it was nowhere near as good as this.",1507420800,6,1015,4.872832369942197

662647,5,6303481345,"Ninja Scroll is one of my favorite animes and animated features period.  It's typically grouped among the ""big three"" of anime, together with Ghost in the Shell and Akira, but in my opinion is far above the others.  Not to overblow it mind you, this is merely an action/adventure flick, but amongst the best of its class, up there with things like Raiders of the Lost Ark, Jaws, etc.  Many anime enthusiasts are unaware of Ninja Scroll or underrate its greatness.  I think the reason for this is that the majority of anime fans expect sci/fi such as Robotech or Ghost in the Shell from anime, while others want ""cuteness"" of the Miyazaki sort.  Ninja Scroll is more for the Dungeons and Dragons, fantasy buff set.  As a sole caveat, I would warn the viewer that this contains sadistic violence and egregious sexual violence against women.  After looking at the Yagu Ninja Scroll manga, I am inclined to think that this property is drawn from Futaro Yamada's original work, of which more below.

  The director's great strength is his ability to portray gripping, mad cap action sequences which continually surprise the viewer.  Vampire Hunter D Bloodlust has a similar effect, and when I first saw it, I thought, he is trying to rip off Ninja Scroll, but then I realized it was the same director! Lol, I guess he can rip off himself.  The animation is superb, not for the seamlessness and smoothness that one finds in Miyazaki, but rather for the visual conception and beauty of the characters.  People used to rave about the beauty of Kageroo back in the day.

The plot is a fascinating intertwining of love story, adventure for secreted gold, and political intrigue that draws from Kurosawa, Shogun, and other classics of Japanese cinema.  This movie is the director's homage to the ""ninja scroll"" books of Futaro Yamada, a mid century Japanese scifi/mystery writer who wrote stories about Ninja who had perfected supernatural powers a la the Xmen.  One of these Kouga Ninja Scrolls has been translated into English, and I recommend it as much as good as Ninja Scroll itself.  In this anime, eight such ninja, the Devils of Kimone are pitted against Jubei Kibagami, who was a legendary wandering samurai of Japanese myth, and his chance sidekicks, Dakuan, a scheming government agent, and Kageroo, a female ninja with not a few tricks up her own sleeve!  The dialogue, story, action, animation are all A+.  Even the music, which involves brisk kettle drums during the action sequences, is a cut above for anime.  This too has been borrowed again and again, most notably in the movie Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.

There is so much there.  Each scene brims with subtext and allusion to classic Japanese cinema.  I picture a beautiful scene when Jubei and Kageroo first meet in a grove teeming with fireflies.  Regard this as an allusion to Grave of the Fireflies, another great anime.  See the foreshadowing?  So melancholy and bittersweet!

There are few movies as great as Ninja Scroll, by which, I mean, falling into the fantasy/action/adventure genre that literally have it all.  In anime, the Vampire Hunter D movies are good.  The animation Heavy Metal and the 1986 Transformers animated movie perhaps.  I already mentioned the book Kouga Ninja Scrolls.  Perhaps Conan the Barbarian movie.  The Chinese Wuxia film Hero.  Please leave me any suggestions if anyone out there knows of any to add to my pantheon.",1502928000,2,3417,4.866551126516464

Best picture, best sound. Period.
My quam here is not with the picture quality which is top notch and it is presented in what I think is the original fullscreen format. Great.
What I am writing to warn consumers of (and I don't know if the seller is even aware of this) is the sound transfer is HORRIBLE. UNWATCHABLE.
The movie comes with your choice of the original English dub, if which I am a fan and what I grew up with, and the Japanese dub with English subs.
However, the ambient sound sound effects and anything that is not dialogue is so terribly distorted (hard to describe it's like when sound is being propelled thru a megaphone thru the air or something) that you can only hear distorted air feedback noise at the height of any action scene. The thus of action which should be rich and bassy are not and the distorted sound gets so bad it drowns out the music, which adds to the tension and drama in the appropriate scenes.
I am so disappointed I am returning this, my first amazon Bluray return.
Please avoid my mistake. Aug 2016 option for Multiformat is to be avoided. Maybe I'll switch it out for the older DVD.  Or just watch it on Hulu again",1470355200,4,1412,4.280898876404494

663745,5,6303481345,"Ninja Scroll is among a small group of films like Ghost in the Shell that are considered the quintessential Anime of the mid 90s. This was a time when Anime was really starting to attract mainstream attention in the United States. Although Ninja Scroll is very derivative of its genre what sets it apart is quality. Like Street Fighter II the Movie it was released among a sea of similar type movies of inferior quality. SF II succeeded because it excelled in its core objective of creating thrilling fights. It is amazing to me how many fighting game tie-ins absolutely could not get the fighting right. That doesnt mean that SF II or Ninja Scroll are at the quality of a Spirited Away or My Neighbor Totoro but they do what they do superbly. Unfortunately, for every Ninja Scroll there were dozens of garbage movies and eventually I lost interest in Anime because I was burned one too many times. My interest has been somewhat rekindled and Im trying to replace some of the Anime I owned on VHS that loved but eventually got rid of when I upgraded to DVD and blue-ray. Ninja Scroll is one of the first to make the cut.

Ninja Scrolls target demographic is young males and as such is an aggressive testosterone filled movie. There is nudity, sexual assault and tons and tons of blood. Im not trying to say that young males are drawn to sexual violence but other demographics may be repelled. Blood doesnt flow from wounds it sprays as if being forced through a pressure hose. What Ninja Scroll does is it delivers what fans of the genre want. The plot is simple but not dumb. The characters are well developed and the fighting is AWESOME! Its hard for me to think of more than a few Anime with comparable scenes of fighting and more interesting combatants. That is not to say that Ninja Scroll is a one trick pony. Ninja Scroll is one of those rare movies that nails just about everything from story to music and even the excellent U.S. voice acting.

Lets face facts. You can get away with almost anything in a film like this if you nail down the fighting. Do fans of Street Fighter II really remember anything besides the fights? The plot centers around an exceptionally talented Ninja named Jubei Kibagami who gets unintentionally embroiled in a war between the Tokugawa government and The Shogun of the Dark and must work his way through the Eight Devils of Kimon to take revenge on a man he already killed once. Jubei is cool, and reminds me a lot of Spike Spiegel from Cowboy Bebop (which was released several years after Ninja Scroll), but its the Eight Devils who steal the show. They are by and large human in appearance and its never clear whether they are literally supernatural or simply extraordinarily talented fighters. In Asian film even normal humans are able to achieve supernormal powers through extreme training. Mushizo, for example, literally has a honeycomb within his back where killer bees live. That certainly is not something a human would be capable of having. Each of the Eight Devils is unique and highly inventive and its a blast seeing Jubei face off against these seemingly invincible foes. The writers were smart in keeping Jubei relatable and sympathetic and in most of the fights he wins only thanks to help from another.

So what do you get with this release? There are zero extras and it runs in 4:3 aspect ratio rather than widescreen so prepare to have black bars on both side. This is the way the movie was created so this isn't a complaint just something to note. They used the same dubbing used on the VHS copy I owned years ago that was put out by Manga Video but given the quality of the dubbing I don't mind. Seeing this film after so many years was an absolute blast. Ill admit there is a lot of animation shortcutting but the film holds up both in look and in story. In my short list of must own Anime films Ninja Scroll is near the top.",1432857600,6,3886,4.540656205420827
663746,4,6303481345,"One of anime's great classics now on BD.
It is fantastic to sit and watch real and drawn animation and everything it was capable of, it simply puts modern computer generated anime in its place. So much movement in each shot. So many shots they no longer use because computers can't do them well. This is a wonderful piece of moving art.
That said this is old anime so the plot is terrible. It is another story of the baddest man alive. If you like Fist of the North Star, Vampire Hunter D, Violence Jack, MD Geist, etc and all you you need for character development is to know the main character will win, you might even think the story is great.
One thing I should note if you didn't see it in the product description, this is in 4:3 not wide screen, so you will have the black bars on the side of your screen. You should quickly stop noticing them as the features starts.
I think the dub is original but I can swear to that and I didn't dig out my DVD to compare.

Now that this has been remastered and released on BD we can go back to waiting for Metropolis and other classics to get the same treatment and if we are very very lucky.. Robot Carnival (yeah, right! that is sadly never going to happen).",1432425600,2,1204,4.212121212121212

And as stated in another review, this is not widescreen.  However, it's also not a movie, it's anime, so how/why someone would think it would become widescreen without them redoing the entire movie is beyond me.

As for the movie, still one of my favorites.",1432166400,,487,4.3076923076923075
663748,5,6303481345,"Easily one of the best anime movies ever created.
Tech specs:
First things first, this exceptional film is over 20 years old. It still holds up. Having said, err typed that, be prepared for a couple of things; the aspect ratio. Since this film was made when CRT televisions were used in most homes you'll discover the aspect ratio is set to 4:3. For widescreen flat screen televisions you're going to have black bars on the sides not the top and bottom. Next the film looks like it was transferred from a VHS tape so the menu and selections are going to look like some high school kid or a porno movie production associate made them. These are not complaints on my part, just giving all perfectionists a heads up. There are no frills like extras or the like, as I mentioned the film is over 20 years old. Although there is audio commentary by the director, and other major players in the film which is absolutely awesome. The commentary provides some insight into the old days of cel based anime. Stuff like that is what I love about commentaries.

Now the film:
 Like I said this is easily, EASILY one of the BEST anime films ever made. Made in 1993 this film changed the way I looked at entertainment, movies, animation, and storytelling. I normally prefer subbed anime but when I bought the VHS tape in '95 I was not disappointed with the English voice acting, I may even venture to say that it may be just as good as the Japanese voice acting. I wore out the tape, I watched it so many times. Jubei (the protagonist) sounds like a California surfer dude but that is OK because his character is so deep and developed that different scenes exemplify his complexity as a character and the voice provides a very laid back attitude combined with wisdom that comes from experience.
 You are not going to find flashy CG here at all. From my understanding it is all traditional cel animation which is incredible considering how amazing some of the visuals are in the movie. I don't want to delve into the story or the plot too much b/c I think if you're a fan of anime you owe it to yourself to watch this movie; at $10 for the DVD and $15 for the Blu ray take a chance if you're on the fence about this film. Keep in mind though there is extreme violence, I mean EXTREME and some sexual situations/scenes that are NOT for the easily offended.
 There are so many layers to the plot as well the characters, the good guys and the bad guys. There is strife between so many sides as well between the good guys, the bad guys, and WITHIN both groups. The demons all have their unique talents as well the old man (government agent), Kagero (the sexy female ninja), and Jubei. There are times when I felt genuine sympathy for the character Kagero. Her beauty and her talent work against her throughout the entire film and it's almost like she feels no relief at all, not even at the end.
I have one gripe but it is very minor and that is that it is not possible to remove the English subtitles from the Japanese voice acting version of the film. You get 3 audio options regarding the film, English w/o subtitles, Japanese w/ English subtitles (again the subtitles are not negotiable), and Japanese commentary w/ English subtitles.
To conclude I am very very happy this film is out again and extremely affordable, the embossed slip-case cover is really cool and the disc case's cover portrays the awesome image of the 8 devils, Jubei, and Kagero. 94 minutes of ninja awesomeness,spectacular (CEL!!!) animation, and political intrigue.",1432080000,17,3521,4.531446540880503

If you haven't seen this movie you need to pick up. In blue ray or regular DVD format. The story is awesome and its ultra violent. The animation is great as well. If you're look for a wild ride, with a wild story to match you can't go wrong. There's a twist ending that I won't spoil. You'll have to watch it to find out.

At most the quality of this should bring the cost down to about 8 dollars (In my opinion, compared to other high quality films being sold at around 8$).",1430179200,,418,4.048192771084337

664153,5,6303481345,"I first saw this movie back in the late 90's and let me tell you, it has made an impression.  The animation on this movie is flat out incredible.  I say this not as an expert in animation, but as a guy who loves seeing people being ripped apart by huge two-sword boomerang weapons.

Now there is some talk about misogyny in this movie.  Can't you feminists leave anything male related alone?  Jesus, videogames, sports, and now NINJA SCROLL!?!?  Anyway, the reason they are all up in arms is because Jubei doesn't fall for the woman ninja's normal bullcrap and calls her out on it multiple times.  If you are tired of seeing people like Michael Cera and Seth Rogan be male leads in movies, and yearn for the days of Arnold, trust me when I say you will love Ninja Scroll.

Ninja Scroll is my 2nd favorite movie behind Point Break.  Let's address the elephant in the room, yes it's animated.  If you are one of those dorks who think it's nerdy to watch animated stuff, then color me a nerd.  I challenge anyone with that mindset to watch this flick with an open mind because it kicks so much ass.

My favorite character in the movie is the main bad guy Himuro Gemma.  He has hilarious lines through the movie and goes into combat wearing only a piece of metal on his arm.  When you watch the movie you'll find out why, but I just think it's great that he decides to beat people to death using karate instead of sword fighting.

If you like crazy action, gore, superpowers, ninjas, and swordplay, get Ninja Scroll immediately.",1415577600,,1524,4.431654676258993

664156,5,6303481345,"This is, without a doubt, my all time favorite anime. It is the movie that peaked my interest in anime as a genre and as an artistic medium. It can be a bit of a shock to some people though, especially if the most violent anime you have ever seen is something along the lines of Dragon Ball Z. BE WARNED, THIS IS NOT AN ANIME FOR CHILDREN. I would not recommend this for anyone under the age of 14. This movie contains scenes of graphically brutal violence, and a few sexually explicit ones. Like I said it can be bit of a shock to people who aren't ready for it. In my opinion, any true fan of anime should see this movie at least once. The plot of movie follows a wandering sell-sword ninja name Jubei. Jubei crosses paths with one of the Eight Devils of Kimone, while saving a lone ninja women. He then soon teams up with the ninja women Kagero and Dakuan(a government agent) to destroy the Devils of Kimone. What ensues is a blood bath of action and violence. The animation is awesome and so it the music. The English voice over fits perfectly in my opinion. I have been told that this was one of the first anime movies made were the prime target was the American movie audience. A must see. If this type of anime is your particular cup of tea, then just buy it, you won't be disappointed and you definitely won't watch it just once.
Note: if you are thinking of upgrading to the Blu-ray from the DVD, the picture quality isn't that much better. The sound quality is though. For me the difference was very noticeable. I think that the musical score to this movie is amazing, making it completely worth it for me.",1414108800,7,1616,4.301639344262295

It's probably a good thing I didn't see this when I was a kid though, because my friends and I were already doing idiotic and dangerous things due to inspiration from this type of media and this would have pushed it too far.

Yes, it has brief sexual scenes and some graphic violence, but it serves to move the story forward instead of being gratuitous.  No, it's not meant for children.  The story, pacing, art direction, and narrative are superb and serves as an example of animation as a viable art form.  I first rented and then purchased this movie on VHS in the 1990s and I immediately purchased the DVD when I saw the low price of $10.99 on Amazon.

I wish there were some more extras like concept art or interviews with the cast but I know this is an older movie so some of those things probably don't exist anymore.

Ninja Scroll is a classic anime movie, and it holds up very well over these years. The dubbing is quite good despite the age of the film and the film itself is fantastic. The characters are very interesting, the music is fitting and the animation is stunning. This has been one of my favorite movies since I first saw it many years ago.

If you haven't heard of Ninja Scroll, be warned, this is probably the grittiest, most depressing thing in wide release you've ever heard of. There are things in here that can shake even the most hardcore. This anime is absolutely terrifying and jaw-dropping almost every minute committed to film - in a good way.

Not sure what else to say - this is just 100% balls-to-the-wall classic adult anime that continues to thrill and excite.

I like to watch most movies in their original language with subtitles, but Ninja Scroll is a different story for me because when I was first introduced to this movie we only had the English dub on VHS.  So hearing this movie in the English really takes me back, so many memorable and cheesy lines.  Really disappointed that it is almost un-watchable.

I would like to have some extensive interviews or insights from the makers, producers, voice actors, artists, writers...somebody, anybody to just give us information about the characters, their inspirations or whatever..just something. This anime classic deserves that much work and effort put into it, hands down.

The blu-ray transfer is good and they finally have the real format rather than the fake widescreen or the fullscreen version. This is the version to own and it is a bit crisper and cleaner as well but not anything truly to write home about. I'm just happy we got the right formatted version and the choice for either Japanese or English.

On to the Blu-ray, the movie has never looked better, you see a level of detail that wasn't seened in previous releases.

All in all, a must buy.

It's still a great movie I'm happy to have on a Blu-Ray but.....and it's a big BUT for me. Only in 4x3 presentation which means not in widescreen so if you have a HDTV you'll be watching with vertical black bars on the sides. The visuals are improved over the DVD (I own that as well) but man I wish they could have updated to a true widescreen for 20 bucks I can't help but feel let down. Also no special features! So I rated this 3 stars not for the movie but the presentation.

I'm not saying it was bad, but it didn't have me on the edge of my seat or anything.  I will say there are a number of really cool scenes that I enjoyed; mostly the bloody ones.  And the fact that the female ninja can kill any man by sleeping with them is an interesting premise.  She doesn't even need to ask, as most would be more than willing to rape her, ultimately benefiting... her?  Kinda twisted huh.  I'm glad to have Ninja Scroll in my collection now, but anything over 90 minutes would have been too much.

664760,5,6303481345,"WOW! Everybody who hates this movie points out the rapes scenes (2).
Then they go on about how the  movie potrays women and how she should be feeling as a rape victim.
Here's the deal...she is a FREAKING ninja and will not be acting to the whims of people living in todays society.
She's probably gonna act like a ninja.
For a simple example is if someone rapes a women who is a myu thai champion well he may get his ass kicked in a dark alley, if someone rapes a police officer he may get shot down in the near future.
If someone I know got raped they would probably be paranoid for a little while, need to go to a rape crisis center.
If a ninja gets raped and survives the encounter the rapist may find that leaving her alive was not a good idea.
Also Ninja's a more akin to modern day soldiers and take orders from high on up, (ninja seeing as it's lifelong commitment are probably more loyal and are made not to fear death). So it's hard to believe that she would act the way the reviewers would and also that this occurs a long time ago where there were few laws and those that were made were made in royalties favour... seriously read a James Clavell novel for more examples on this.
It would suggest to me that the one who hated this movie aren't well versed in the asian culture of a long time ago and should probably never have even tried to watch this.
For the other positive reviews I 'm proud to say there all probably true...good solid movie, well animated, good bloody battles, creative villians, oh and yeah that's right a little rapage here and there.",1346371200,3,1567,4.276094276094276

This film was made in the late 80's-early 90's era with the same style of anime that came out of that era.

664829,4,6303481345,"I originally owned this on VHS, once upon a time when I was a young kid. It along with ""Fist of the North Star"", ""Akira"", ""Ghost in the Shell"" and ""Street Fighter II"" was my original introduction to anime and I have been hooked ever since. Out of these 5 CLASSICS that I was lucky enough to grow up with in the `80s, I have always been fondest of ""Ninja Scroll"", for its great story, pacing and characters with their cool and unique abilities. I have of course expanded my view to include many other styles and themes of anime, like the wonderful works of Miyazaki at Studio Ghibli. But, I always find myself wanting to go back and re-watch ""Ninja Scroll"" for the pure entertainment value, fantastic story line, and kicka$$ characters that have some great development through their smart action sequences.

The true value of this classic anime might be lost on newer viewers, but as I was growing up I had always used this to introduce my friends to anime. It might not be my first choice of recommendation now, as there have been many other great animations I have seen since this was created, but many modern anime styles and story lines have come out of the study of classics like ""Ninja Scroll"", so I will continue to always at least recommend it as a must-see-film for anyone interested in anime and/or ninjas. You have to remember that when this first came out there was little development of computer animation and software to help draw or model and color animation cells like there is today, so watching anime like this can really help you appreciate the quality that was achieved before the advent of what is now ""modern computer animation"". The amount of raw talent that went into this film is spectacular. Its combination of great artwork and animation along with an imaginative story line loosely based on Japanese folk-lore/history still far exceeds the quality of many animations created today.

Having finally exchanged all my old VHS players out for DVD players and still wanting to be able to break out this oldie-but-goodie, I found this 10th Anniversary Edition fit the bill nicely. I did deduct one star, as like many others have pointed out, the widescreen version does crop the top and bottom off the original to make it fit. But, that is not the version I usually watch. Plus, if they ever do come out with a proper transfer to widescreen then I will buy that version as well.

What makes this 10th anniversary edition worth the purchase, besides being one of the best action/adventure ninja movies ever created, is the sound and overall picture quality. It is a two sided disc that includes both the original re-mastered full screen and the cropped widescreen, both in Dolby Digital 5.1 and DTS 6.1. Also, the DVD quality with the auto-upscale that most DVD and Blu-Ray players have now, makes this version look way better then the old VHS, which I have played so many times now that it has a lot of hiccups throughout its play (^.^).

If you can not stand watching video in full screen format, then unless you have watched this in its original format a hundred times like me, or especially if you have never seen it, you won't be able to tell that the widescreen is cropped anyways. Really, for a cropped video, the widescreen version is still a good transfer with good picture quality and I have watched that version many times as well, especially when I know others in the room are new to the film. There are a few scenes that look a bit pixilated in the widescreen, but overall it is not as terrible of a transfer as some other reviewers would have you think.

If you are a true fan of anime then you have to own a copy of this. This is also a must have if you only own the older VHS version or for some ridiculously insane reason have never heard or seen ""Ninja Scroll"". If you have any interest in anime, especially anime that features bada$$ ninja action, then you owe it to yourself to buy a copy. Also, make sure to check out all these classics: ""Akira"", ""Ghost in the Shell"", ""The Fist of the North Star"", ""Street Fighter II"" along with ""Ninja Scroll"". If I were to include a classic anime series then I would also have to also recommend ""Cowboy Bebop"". I will stop there because if I really take the time to think about all the other ones I adore then this might end up being the longest review ever written on Amazon.

Oh, and by the way, ""Ninja Scroll"" is not as bloodthirsty and perverted as many of these other reviewers are trying to make it seem. Making this out to be some sort of rape-porn is like calling a movie with two short nude scenes a hardcore porno. These other reviewers singular focus on the short graphic scenes in this film is very narrow minded. Chalking the entire film up to be a bloody rape-porno is just utter non-sense and I suggest just ignoring these small minded fools.",1320624000,2,4834,4.531500572737686

*Spoilers*

We first watched ""Ninja Scroll"" because we're working our way through the anime section now that we've seen all the Miyazaki movies. I understand that this is a movie tie-in to a popular series but being as always late to the bandwagon, I haven't seen the series and can't comment on that aspect of this movie. Let's get one thing straight - this movie is not for children or for people sensitive to blood or violence. Limbs and body parts are frequently hacked or torn off, and the blood spurts seem on par with a Tarantino film. There's also some graphic sexual content here, with a female ninja almost-raped by an opponent, some frank discussions of sex and sexual orientation, and one snake-themed villainess produces vipers from unusual bodily orifices.

If you're still reading after that content warning, then I will note that this is an extremely interesting film, if the content doesn't turn you off. ""Ninja Scroll"" can't seem to decide how important ninjas are seen in the society at large around them - on the one hand, the officers of the army treat them as expendable and disposable, but on the other hand, the ""techniques"" that the ninjas (both good and bad) have mastered are nothing short of magical, and dangerous deadly magic at that. In no particular order, we have a female so steeped in poison (by fate or by choice, we don't know) that her very touch kills; a man who willingly hosts deadly hornets in his body and uses them as a weapon, as well as a woman who does the same with vipers; men who can turn their bodies into stone or knit their bodies back together after losing limbs; and much more. All this makes for some extremely interesting battles, many with surprising or unusual endings.

Which isn't to say that ""Ninja Scroll"" is perfect. Like pretty much all anime movies, you have to watch it at least twice just to really understand what's going on. The English dubs and the English subtitles do not match at all, a cardinal sin of anime for those (like me) who are partially hearing impaired but not completely deaf, and while the subtitles are usually better dialogue than the dubs, it sometimes seems necessary to have *both* in order to be completely clear about the situation onscreen. Some of the violence seems a bit gratuitous, and at least one major plot 'twist' is as predictable as the sun rising in the morning. Having said *that*, however, there's quite a lot here that is surprising and unpredictable, and it's very nice to see heroes who behave in a sane and sensible manner, although I have to deduct mental points for having the heroine rapidly descend into hormonal whininess because the writers weren't sure how else to script dialogue for a tortured woman doomed to loneliness.

I have to recommend ""Ninja Scroll"" just because it's so fantastical and unusual - I've honestly never seen anything quite like it. I honestly much prefer films with less graphic violence and sexual violence, but if you can get past the graphic content (and the worst of it seems to be in the first 20-30 minutes of the film), there's a good chance you'll enjoy it as I did.

664927,1,6303481345,"I wouldn't recommend this unless you enjoy watching women being raped (I don't) and women being raped by monsters (I so very don't).  Do not be swayed by claims of deep and meaningful plotlines, nor by claims that the rape scenes are necessary for said deep plot.  The rape scenes in this show are NOT deep or meaningful in any way, shape, or form.  They do not add to the story, except that *one* of them reveals the fact that the woman being raped has a body full of poison that kills the people who rape her.  Which is such an incredibly stupid plot point I really can't imagine where ""deep"" or ""meaningful"" would come from or how it could *possibly* justify the scene, which involves the woman in question being graphically raped by a monster.  And it certainly doesn't justify any of the other abusive sex scenes that take place, all of which are equally or even more unnecessary.

None of the other plot points in the anime are any more interesting.  Indeed, the plot feels horribly clichd and weak, and the ending was mind numbingly stupid.  The main character *is* a good guy and a mildly interesting character, but nowhere near on a level to save the awful script.  Pretty much the only times I wasn't bored watching this was when I was too busy being repulsed by the aforementioned rape scenes.  (As a side note, guys?  Showing that one character in the world treats this woman like a human rather than an object or weapon does not make this an awesome show, especially when the woman in question behaves like a whipped dog that's just been given a pat on the head for the first time.  It is pretty sick, and definitely misogynistic.)

If you are looking for a dark or bloody action anime with an actual plot, try the Hellsing Ultimate OVA (though be warned, bloody is an understatement).  If you want something that really is deep and/or meaningful, I would advise trying Twelve Kingdoms.  If you want dark AND deep, try Kannazuki no Miko.

- A reluctant hero
- A femme fetal
- Seemingly impossible odds
- A great finale

Ninja Scroll's strength comes from a solid plot, great character dialog, strong character arcs (both leads) and clever directing. Unlike other movies of this genre, this film does not rely entirely on spectacular animation; in fact, there's a good chance you'll forget your even watching an animation at all.

Have you ever seen a car crash on television? Most of the time they look fairly awesome. This anime puts you on the side of the highway watching cars pass with the occasional car crash. The action sequences are brilliantly put together, but everything else is a giant mess. If you are an action junkie, I can suggest this one. If you enjoy a compelling story that is important, keep moving.

Jubei is an independent ninja who will do almost anything for some spare gold. He is an impressive contender for any one who may challenge him. He is forced into a mission Dakuwon, who is a government spy. Dakuwon poisons Jubei and will only give him the antidote if he helps him. Gemma, a thought-dead rival of Jubei, has plans on taking over Japan. He is using the help of the 8 Devils. The 8 Devils are extremely powerful beings that are often very interesting.

Jubei joins up with Kagero later in the film. Kagero is a female ninja with an immunity to poison. However, if she becomes intimate with anyone, she will kill them with her body's excess poison. As you might expect, there is some sexual tension between Kagero and Jubei throughout the film.

We see Jubei, Kagero, and Dakuwon fighting the 8 Devils on their journey to stop Gemma. The fight sequences are some of the best I've ever seen. Animation is good and the detail of gore is breath taking. Blood squirts all over the place when someone is sliced open. Arms and legs are ripped off at times. The movie is sick in a good way.

However, the problem comes in the ridiculous story. The 8 Devils really only serve as kill joy. They really serve no purpose to the story. Gemma has an entire army on his side, he does not even need the Devils. Gemma himself only appears near the end of the movie. The rest of the movie's story is about the relationship between Kagero and Jubei. Kagero feels to need to keep saving Jubei's life...because she loves him. The English voice acting is terrible and can not pull this off well. The entire acting comes off too generic for such a personal storyline.

Not only is the story filled with a bunch of lame rambling until the next action sequence, but it just isn't that interesting of a story to start with. There is tons of nudity and sex in this one to mask this horrible movie. I am not falling for it though. This is pure garbage. Only action junkies and perverts should purchase this one.",1221264000,3,2401,4.460136674259681
665005,5,6303481345,"This is one of very first full length anime movies i ever saw, and it left a big impression on me. I recently watched it again and thought it would be fun to make a review on here for it.

 The story is interesting, and contains some political intrigue, where there are some twists as to who works for who and who IS who. So it makes you think a little bit.

 The characters are intersting as well, from Jubei, the central hero, and the old man he meets, too the 8 devils which are confronted with, all having their own fantastic skills and techniques, each using their unique power to try and stop Jubei, a kind of mercenary ninja that isn't exactly all about the money.

 Even though the film is over 15 years old, its some of the very best animation i have ever seen in an animated movie. I think it looks even better than a lot of the newer anime films out now that mix A LOT of CGI in the drawing, sense all drawing is practically done totally with the computer now for nearly all films in anime, with the exception of some.
 The attention to detail is impressive, and how it flows so well, its just beautiful. This is a true piece of animation. A classic.

 Now, i was introduced to the English voice dubbing version of the movie, and always loved the voice actors in this movie. But after viewing it recently ,i noticed how out of place some of the language used was, especially for a film based in feudal japan, between the 12th and 19th century. Expressions like ""...piss off! "" , for example, though humorous, just isn't the correct terms in this era.

And that is like my biggest dislike, is the dialog used for the english dubbing. Even though i like their voices and their personalities are likable...it just comes across as bit silly and ridiculous, citing that as the films weakness. BUT, fortunatly, this DVD is bilingual, coming with the ORIGINAL JAPANESE LANGUAGE DUB (with english subtitles)

Trust me, the English dub is fun, but the orginal japanese dub with english subtitles is superior. I could take the film more seriously now, and in turn it made the whole experience a lot better. It was like almost watching a entirely new movie. And i usually prefer English Dub over Subs, so i never thought id prefer subs instead.

If the english dub was the actual way the original voice cast and script went, i would of gave this movie 4 stars for the 1990's styled american street talking dialog. And though it isn't that painfully bad lol, its still a weak dubbing, in terms of historically correct speech for that time. I wouldnt of been suprised to hear someone in the movie say ""blow me"" or ""how bout a nuckle sandwhich , wise guy!!!!!???"" something retarded like that. Thankfully it isn't that bad. But again, the Subtitled version you can choose from with the orginal japanese voice actors is superior and makes this movie more timeless.

The musical score in this film is great, with a marching main theme thats memorable. And also other parts of the films music is haunting and uses japanese instruments and traditional style. I liked it. Set the mood for something evil and that things weren't what they seemed.

The guy who put this film together by the way, Yoshiaki Kawajiri, was the one who brought us Wicked City. And we see similar touches of bizarre horror carried on into this film, the likes of which were in Wicked City. At times Ninja Scroll could very well be taken as a horror film, becouse of the intense depiction of various mutilation and bodily disfiguration and other violence, but it all paints a perfect picture of how it probubly would of been in feudal japan with demons walking the earth. Its quite a dark film, in that respect. But it also has a sense of humor, and even a bit of romance.

All and all, its a classic anime film. And the dvd itself, though others pointed out issues with lack of a true widescreen (which sucks), the special edition version offers an interview with the english voice actors, Dean Elliot (who voiced Jubei) and Wendee Lee (who voices Kagero, the strong willed ninja girl)

Plus theres a image gallery and even an interview with the director, Yoshiaki Kawajiri. Which is a real treat.

The film itself , aside from the bonus features, is worth owning in itself, but the bonus features give this special edition some perks for the viewer. And now you can get this edition very cheap. So if you loved this film, id buy it. Just NEVER pay list price for it. Those days of 30 dollar anime films need to be over and done with.

But ya, Ninja Scroll is a great classic, and thats why its one of my all time favorite anime movies.",1220832000,2,4603,4.485645933014354

*Great fight scenes.  Loads of bloody action.  Never dull.
*Strong, memorable imagery.  Excellent art design and details.  The characters look smashing.
*Intruiging, straightforward storyline.
*Characters are awesome.  They are very well-developed, very deep, and very immersive.
*The bad guys are awesome too.  They have a lot of interesting powers/traits.

The Bad Things
*Very shocking (at least for the first viewing).  The violence is extreme (on the same level as ""Kill Bill""), and there are a few graphic sex scenes.  Definately not for the squeamish.

Definately one of the best ninja/samurai films ever made (in anime or otherwise).  It is a simple story that leaves lots of room for some very deep characters and a lot of awesome fight scenes.  The extreme violence and sex may drive some people away, but for those who can stand it, it is quite awesome.

The 10th anniversary edition includes one 30 minute interview session and some information to read.  It is in both fullscreen and widescreen (although I think somebody said that the widescreen side is a ""fake"" widescreen, with the top and bottom of the frame cut off).

The story centers on a masterless samari named Jubei who is (more or less) forced into service by Dakuwon, an agent of the Tokengowa goverment of Japan. Along the way, they battle the 8 Devils of Kimone, led by Jubei's old enemy Himiro Gemma and gain an ally in Kegero. A ninja woman who is blessed with an immunity to poisons but cursed because she can't enjoy any physical intimacy with anyone without killing them. Together, the three must prevent the 8 Devils and their masters, The Shogun Of The Dark from overtaking the government of Japan via a civil war.

The animation is not of the highest quality, nor is the choreography anything complex. This doesn't count against the creativity and pace of any of the fight scenes.

665139,1,6303481345,"The best part of the DVD was in the interview, where the director was asked what he had been trying to say about the role of women in Japan during that era. He replied, very sensibly, that the characters were ninja's and demons belonging to secret organizations, and therefore did not and could not say much about society at that time. Elsewhere in the interview he made it very clear as to why he DID make the movie - as a rape and violence fantasy to separate lowest-common-denominator teenaged boys from their parents' money.

All this had been obvious just from watching the movie. My co-watcher and I made cruel fun of the interviewer for asking such a dumb question. Imagine my surprise when I came here. For some reason, some who have actually seen the film are going to try to convince you that it is trying to say something about the oppression of women. Other than ""It is fun to watch!"" -- not really. Far from critiquing the treatment of women at the time, the heroine is portrayed as desiring the normal woman's role, but tragically denied it. The gratuitous rapes and other unpleasant sexual content are there to be enjoyed by creepy adolescent boys with anger issues - a lucrative demographic, to be sure, but not one renowned for its feminist sensibilities.  While we are at it, the gory violence is not here to make a statement about the horror of war or the Plight of the Common Ninja. It's there because watching blood gush like a fountain all over the place is really reeaally kewl. If you want a film that says something, or even that you just want to pretend says something, rent RASHOMON or SEVEN SAMURAI or IRON frigging MONKEY fer crissake. If you want something pretty, violent, and stupid, but that will kindly refrain from scarring you for life, rent VAN HELSING!!! If you want to see buckets of blood and some horrid sexual content - but combined with actual characters, human emotions, and a plot even -- try QUEEN MARGOT.

NINJA SCROLL opens well, with a lone ninja hero (lacking in charisma a bit, but fairly solid hero material) on the one hand, and a band of demonic black clad horsemen riding through a lightning storm on the other. There are some lovely images; a heron by a river, the play of shadows under a bridge, a swordfight in a bamboo forest. But the demons are simply grotesque bad guys, with dull and earthly motives involving politics and power. Their ""demonic"" nature is expressed through their ugliness, foul language, and fondness for ripping arms off of unfortunate ninjas. They are not genuinely supernatural or otherworldly, just stupid, cruel and a bit disgusting.  There are none of the eerie shivers one gets from Japanese folklore or (good) horror based on it.

The plot is your generic ""Search for the MacGuffin"" which you might find in filler episodes of KUNG FU or in a B Western. And what a mortal, money-grubbing MacGuffin it is. It is a disappointment to find out that those demonic Night Riders from the beginning were up to something so dull. The heroes fight a series of villains to move the action along, and the villains back-stab each other whenever an ""unexpected"" twist is needed.

The hero and heroine are pretty grumpy, which is totally understandable seeing as her friends all died and she was raped by demons, and he, you know, lost a tooth. They give the increasingly grumpy viewer somebody to relate to. Their relationship is not normally what I would consider good characterization, but without it there would be zero characterization at all, and so one clings to it as to a life raft. It also provides a few good laughs - such as when our hero demonstrates how NOT to administer first aid to a lady ninja. Alas, for the ending to have played as ""moving"" (as intended) rather than silly (as is) would have required a far more lyrical and less crass approach to the film as a whole. Not to mention that if my beloved and all my friends went splat, and I got raped by two different demons within a twenty-four hour period, I'd have something else on my mind than pining after the Grumpy Ninja Hero I'd known all of a DAY. Or moping about how I'm not a normal woman, when I should be worrying about all those demons after my posterior and thankful that my arms are still firmly attached. But I didn't write this thing.

My anime experience up till now has been mostly Miyazaki films and Adult Swim cartoons. The quality was consistently impressive enough that I presumed a ""classic"" of the art form would be . . . good. Instead, NINJA SCROLL is an uninspired potboiler, which would make a barely passable time killer were it not rendered unwatchable via the sadistic, pointless, and juvenile nature of its ""adult"" content.  That I have seen worse is the best I can say for it. True, it has one seriously pretty heron, and I learned the phrase ""Tokugawa Shogunate"", which makes me feel slightly smarter.

I do recommend the movie and if you don't like animation, excessive violence, and gratuitous sex scenes, don't watch it.

Here is a synopsis of the flick:  Do not read if you want to figure the movie out by yourself.

A village has been wiped out by a mysterious plague which is actually a ruse (a trick) created by a group of villans called the 8 Devils of Kimone.  The devils actually killed the villagers and made it look like a plague to steal gold from a ship that is scheduled to dock at a nearby port.  A mafia like clan from a adjacent village sends in a bunch of warriors to inspect the village because they do not believe it is a plague.  The warriors get their A$$ kicked by one of the Devils of Kimone thats skin can become as hard as rock a deflect swords and such.  Kagero, the female lead who has been cursed by poisonous skin and has never and can never have contact with anothe human is the only survivor of the clan but is captured by the demon.  The demon does fondle Kagero pretty graphically and Jubei the main charcachter, a ninja vagabond (a nomad/drifter, a person without a home) traveling the countryside happens upon the situation and eventually defeats the demon.

Throughout the movie, Jubei keeps running into an mysterious sly old man who eventually reveals he is a detective working fo r the local police.  The old man tricks Jubei into helping him by poisoning him with a nija star.  The old man will give Jubei the cure if he helps hunt down the devils ans if he does not help him, Jubei will die.

Kagero which is also searching for the devils for the revenge of her clan reluctantly joins Jubei and the old man in the quest.

Jubei battles each of the Devils along the way in some pretty intense fight scenes and eventually finds out throught the old man the the leader of the Devils is a cohort from his past (excuse me for forgetting his name) in which Jubel fights and chops of his head.  The leader who has discovered the majick of reserection and invincibility has come back to steal all of the this gold.

As the adventure continues through the film.  Kagero falls in love with Jubei but due to her condition/curse cannot physically show Jubei how she feels kissing or otherwise.  Kagero thus does not want to let herself fall for Jubei and attempts to drive him away by being rude and combative.

Time is running out for Jubei and his poison and in a shocking turn of events the old man tell Kagero that she can nullify the effects of Jubei's poison with her own, however, she is skeptical.  In teh final battle, Kagero is mortally wounded and while in her final moments has an embrace with Jubei who has also fallen in love with her.  Kagero dies and Jubei survives and continues on with his nomadic ways thus ending the film.",1126656000,9,3396,4.360890302066773

However, if you enjoy the movie and want to watch a nice HD picture, then go ahead and try it out.  just note that on the back of the box it does say at the bottom that the widescreen version was motified from its original to fit 16x9 televisions.",1115596800,,901,4.463414634146342
665308,5,6303481345,"i like to keep my reviews short, especially cause this one has about 400 already.

i owe it to this film to leave good feedback, i was shown this almost ten years ago when i was in highschool by a friend and ive been hooked on anime ever since.

this film is so epic, i really don't know who else would be reading these reviews except someone extremely new to anime, so if you are this person...trust me, i rule and i know what rules...buy this, buy 2 of them, it's the awesomeness.  if youve seen akira and think thats what all anime is about cause everybody talks about it...no, this movie is the essence of good(blood/sex/violence) anime...buy it NOW!",1111104000,5,654,4.433333333333334
665309,5,6303481345,"Well, isn't most anime for grown-ups anyway? There's some children ones too I guess. For every Tenchi and Pokemon and Ranma 1/2 there's Evangelion, Hellsing, Vampire Hunter D and Akira. Yet for some reason, people always think that animated means children based. Well this is one film you should show people that have that mindset, it's gory, it's violent, and yet it's entertaining.

Jubei is basically a wanderer, a mercenary ninja taking odd jobs for money. Kagero and fellow Kogi clan members investigate people caught in what looked like a viral outbreak. While investigating, they find Tessai, a strange guy who can turn his body to stone and throws a heavy blade, in what results in probably the most goriest scene in the film. He captures Kagero and tries to make love to her(really bad at that too by the way), enter Jubei who rescues her.

She takes off and he encounters an old man whose name escapes me oddly enough. He tells him to take a mission which Jubei refuses until he's poisoned by him so he reluctanctly takes it. There, Jubei finds there's a plot to get rid of the Tokugawa Shogunate(the political party in control of Japan at the time) and ascend themselves to power.

Not only that, Jubei finds the 8 Demons of Gimon: 8 people with incredibly bizarre abilities. It reminded me of the Metal Gear games recently with enemies and bizarre abilities. In the film, you'll find a woman with control over snakes, a ninja who can disappear into shadow, a blind man with incredible hearing, a man with a hive in his back and the leader, who is capable of reincarnation and regenerating his limbs.

The gore is quite violent with ripped off arms, a man torn into 2, other men ripped in half and one's head sliding down his own blade. There is nudity also, one woman has a habit of being nude quite a bit, while there's an attempted rape in the beginning and something that looks like anal sex(or just entering from the back, who knows).

This film is definately not for the little kiddies but for the adults? They just might enjoy themselves.",1105747200,5,2056,4.637362637362638

Anyhow, most western people would not understand the ideas and stories from asia for obvious reasons, they're not asian! They're raised in a white western culture. Just the same, people in asia wouldn't understand things about western folks.  Anyhow, the great thing about anime is they're for mature audiences, these kind of movies, they ain't no  Disney so don't be expecting that.  Most are beyond the comprehension of younger audiences.

  If this is indeed a ""peak achievement of Japanese anime"" you can keep it.  For those of us spoiled by classic western animation this could be a big disappointment - only the lips moves when a character speaks, static images are panned and scanned by the animators (or brought forward rapidly if the character is supposed to be running towards the camera), cels sequences are repeated over and over (a scene of a river filled with dead fish uses this trick - the same fish, in the same relation to the others, are repeated rather than freshly drawn.)  On the other hand, there's a nice use of color in NINJA SCROLL and some of the fight scenes are very well rendered.

665313,4,6303481345,"Similar to its Samurai predecesors Ninja Scroll is all about style and pays very little attention to the plot. That's not necessarily a bad thing though; next to animes like Cowboy Bebop and Akira Ninja Scroll is among the most stylish of series. While Cowboy Bebop is infinitely stronger in plot and is equally a stylish, making it perhaps a stronger series, I have a genuine soft spot for Ninja Scroll's Samurai/Ninja elements. (Also similar to Cowboy Bebop) You have a hybrid of time periods; combining elements of the traditional Samurai flick with futuristic cyber-enemies and magic powers that render the dueling/battling both incredible and amazing.

Scroll, the protagonist, is Japan's greatest swordsmen, wielding unfathomable power that can slice virtually anything in two with a little more than the twitch of his wrist. He embodies all that we love about the typical Ronin (wandering masterless Samurai) - he's a loner, he's funny and, dag dabbit, he's a bad-ass. I often find that the enemies steal the spotlight. Every enemy that is throw at Scroll is bigger, badder and uglier than the previous. While the baddies often adhere to an anime mold (the quiet guy that chuckles all the time, the insane hairy guy, the shrieking femme fatale, etc) they are nonetheless very original and I always find myself looking forward to see what enemy will come lurking out the shadows next. From half-naked ladies with small gremlins crawling out their bodies, to snakemen, to beastmen, to vampires, to see-through blue [...] with blue flames for intestines; there is never a dull moment on the battlefield.

While the plot's weak (a young-common-girl-who's-super-powerful-but-she-doesn't-know-it-yet named Shiyu finds out she's being hunted down by ungodly evil doers she finds protection from Scroll and together they seek out her destiny before she is captured), the animation itself is to die for.

But for Ninja Scroll, it's an exception. It's action packed,ultra violent,and it is just plain cool. Not to be sick or anything,but seeing the characters decapitated and all bloody was quite awesome.

Drawbacks well the story is quite dull. Basically it's good against evil battles and that epidemic. Second like every anime DVDs' it's kind of pricey,$30-$40 for a 90 minute movie. And sure there's widescreen format but really the price antes up for that? Nonetheless Ninja Scroll is a great anime if you need some action.",1095379200,4,672,5.155963302752293

It was so good that it was bad for me because I started to compare every other anime I saw to this one and a lot of good anime didnt' compare at the time. This movie is great and if you are thinking about getting into anime, this one will blow your socks away.

 Gone are the huge eyes, the pretty girl/boy magic tricks, the colorful, flashy outfits. Ninja Scroll is old-school anime. Because of the spouting blood and strange, almost mysoginistic sex/sexual scenes, this is for MATURE ADULTS ONLY. But this is not hentai by any stretch of the imagination. Any sexual scenes are brief, and Ninja Scroll has one of the best love stories/romantic couples EVER. I dare you not to cry, or at least be deeply moved, at the scene toward the end with Jubei and Kagura.

 Jubei is a wandering ninja who accidentally gets caught up in a battle between ninja clans. While neither group is ""good,"" one is evil. The ninja serving the Shogun of the Dark Lord have some peculiar and nasty tricks up their sleeves. The action in Ninja Scroll happens so fast that second and third viewings are a mandatory delight. Really mesmerizing. The beautiful Kagura transforms from geisha to ninja. Kagura is strong, but very feminine in the Japanese sense.

The action was great.

It's 'about' a wandering killer named Jubei, who in the mood-setting first scene tosses a rice ball into the air, puts an end to the lives of two highway robbers, then catches the ball and continues eating it. What it's really about, though, is the cast of villains, the Seven Devils, who seem like some sort of Jungain archetype of everything a good villian could concievably be. I'd be ruining some of the movie's best moments by listing all of their powers here; there are certain scenes where one of them reveals him or herself in a moment of unmatched grandueur; some of the best, though, include a sadistic bisexual lord whose body generates electricity and who runs nearly invisible metal wires across the countryside to zap his enemies, and a ninja who can sink into the shadows as into pools of water, and control the bodies of women in an absolutley disgusting way.
This is giving the stereotypical anime fan just what he wants, and there's a fair helping of sexuality as well. The movie stops just short of being crass, though, and has that uniquely Japanese way of making even the most hideous things somehow beautiful. Hardcore anime fans will not have lived fully until they've seen this; others, though, could probably benefit from it as well, if only by understanding a good deal of what anime ultraviolence is all about.",1083024000,2,1611,4.840579710144928
665386,5,6303481345,"First, regarding its name: a more accurate translation from the original Japanese would be ""The Chronicles of Ninja Jubei.""
Second, regarding the ""misogynism"" in the film: While I understand how it might be interpreted that way, that's not quite true. Kagero is a fascinating character due to the tragedy of her curse. She plays a pivotal role in the story, but most importantly, the ultimate point of the love subplot is that Jubei's sense of honor is so strong and his heart is so pure that he will not use her as just a weapon or an object of lust, the way everyone else has used her. Even at the cost of his life (you will understand when you see it). That's what makes it such a powerful story.
This movie isn't for everyone, but it's an incredible film. It's extremely intense, so sensitive viewers should beware. The animation is beautiful; the action is intense and intelligently choreographed, not mindless and brutal; the plot is highly intricate and very well written.

Though he is my favorite character in the movie, I feel that there was one other person that did not get the credit that he deserved.  I think the best fighter in the feature is the Blind Swordsman in white who issues a challenge to Jubei.  It has been a while since I've seen the film so I can't remember the guy's name.  I feel that had it not been for the girl ninja, Kigaro, he would still be alive today.  Anyone who has seen the film can't deny these facts.

It is not the worse anime feature I have ever seen but it is by far not the best.
the story revolves around a wandering swordsman who teams up fith a female ninja who can poison anyone just by having sex with them and a dirty old man to stop seven demons from conquering the world.  Throughout the battles with the demons range in style as each has their own techniques.  In the end they of course win but not without casulties.

Now.to get something else out of the way,everyone who badmouths this movie says it's stereotypical. Well,at this movie's age,maybe it's a sound assumption that this movie started some of those stereotypes?Therefore that statement has been proven INVALID.Wahaha. Perhaps a better argument is that the story is showing its age,which I can attest to.
The characters are very memorable,espeially Dakuan,the crazy old man with a lazy eye. He rocks. But,I'm afraid the story feels rushed at the end,with the main 'bad guys' dying left and right before they even really put up a fight. The Japanese voice acting is superb,and I think Wendy Lee does Kagero's dub voice. She isn't nearly as good ad the original,but she passes,unlike Jubei's cocky American voice.uggggghhhhhhhh...The animation is AWESOME.(for its time)But,this is a movie we're talking about.

Its about a wandering samurai. Along the way he crossed path with the 8 Devils of Kimon. Each of the ""devils"" have their own attributes or special powers. Its kind of like characters in a video game (why this has not been developed is beyond me)what with their special moves & weapons.
Those who have seen Animatrix might be familiar with the style & visuals. Specifically the segment entitled Program. It's done by Mad House, the same studio of Ninja Scroll
The first time I watched it was on video. And now this edition comes along. The noticeable difference is in the sound department (compared to video). You get it in full Japanese surround (also English dubbed). You can hear the effect of Tessai's (he has rock hard skin) double-blade sword as it boomerangs across the woods. The sounds of plentiful shurikens hitting a tree branch (like bullets off a machine gun). These are some examples of how great it sounds.
The visual department doesn't dissappoint too.
The real Jubei's character bio is included. Yes, he does exist (which I didn't know until this DVD came along). But most of his exploits are stuff of legend & not historically accurate.
My only gripe is the director's interview. I don't think it was professionally executed. While the interview is going on, you can hear noises ... phones ringing, doors opening & shutting. The Amaerican voice actors' interview is much better.
But face it, you won't buy the DVD for the bonus features.

Basically we get to see Jubei fight the devils of Kimone. The movie has alot of gore, and alot of innovative monsters. Basically it isn't all hack and slash. The story is about a village wiped out by a plague. In order to investigate the plague, and wandering monk like dude hires Jubei to help him fight the devils. They run into a ninja girl who has a very special secret.
The movie's DTS is awesome! The picture looks more crisp, and the widescreen aspect only adds to it! I would reccomend this movie to anyone who hasn't seen it. If you have Ninja Scroll already but are not crazy about it, pass this one up.
Actually though, I have to correct my review. I have noticed slight differences. The full screen and widescreen version are on the same dvd, but the fullscreen gets pixely at times(very few). I would just buy the original movie unless you really like Ninja Scroll. The Widescreen isn't even real widescreen, it is 2 black bars.
Both versions have their flaws. I prefer the newer looking image of widescreen. Still, the fullscreen gives you more movie. Take my advice and only buy this if you are a true ninja scroll fan.
Still, the sound is awesome, and the special eddition of a movie has to mean something doesn't it? You never hear of them making the special eddition of crappy movies. Again, true ninja scroll fans are a plus for this, others should just check out the original dvd at the store, which is probably MUCH cheaper now.",1067299200,8,1629,4.469798657718121

First, there's only one disc, with the widescreen version on one side and the pan and scan on the other.  The widescreen version is actually the pan and scan with a bit off the top and bottom cut off.  I guess it's a boon if you have a 16:9 screen, but it kind of sucks to lose any of the picture.  Second, the remastered version isn't significantly better than the original release.  The video's a bit crisper, but nothing on the scale of, say, the most recent Akira DVD release or the Macross Box Sets.  If you just want a copy of Ninja Scroll, then get the older release and save yourself some cash.  If you're a sucker like me, and you have to own the best possible version of any given film, then I guess you'd better go ahead and order this one...",1065657600,,911,4.22543352601156

It's got everything a good anime has but it doesn't go as deep as other anime films have gone and it is predictable and focused more on action than plot(although the plot is not that bad.)

I'm f***ing sick of all that bubblegum anime crap on the market today. I'm looking for something a little more mature. I'm not saying that this is just mindless brutality... I'm just saying that this is anime for big kids. The story is not THAT original, but It's not linear in the slightist. The caracter's profiles were well-done. And the animation is superb, despite the blood looked a little vermillion at times. The accuracy to real ancient Japan was very swishy. But this story is fantasy anyway, so It dosen't have to be. The ending was a little depressing, but atleast it dosen't go down that overwalked path of how the protagonist meets a mate, and they live happily ever after. The sex/violence isn't all the hype I claim it to be, It's no worse than an R-rated move. The sex scene were a little unneccecary at some points, but It always adds a little spice to the movie! The sound quality was well done also, the sound of people screaming when they are being killed was moderatly realistic. A sequal to this movie would sort of ruin the sentimental value of the ending, but I would be interested to see where Jubei moves on to. Anime fans should get this if they can handle the grotesque factors.

There really is nothing new that this movie brings to the table in terms of story.  But that's not what makes it special.  Yoshiaki-san has found a way to blend two popular genres, action and feudal japan, in the realm of anime.  Let's face it, a movie of this graphic a magnitude just wouldn't cut it in live action.  Plus, sometimes it's just more fun to watch it animated.
One warning, though.  If you are faint of heart of stomach, or have a weak constitution all around, and haven't seen this movie, it is best that you keep it that way. ... this movie still stands as one of the most violent OAV to ever come out of Japan.

I watch Ninja scroll religously, but feel guilty about it because it has very small amounts of redeeming Value. Between rape scenes and people getting stung to death, There seems to be very little time for Psychological chit chats or any other type of something that makes a movie worthy watching.
So why do I like it, you ask?
A good question. Maybe because it's so... so... COOL. Kawajiri Directs with style and originality, The way he can excecute any type of fight scene completely flawlessly is beyond me. He can create characters that you end up actually CARING about. PLus the animation is cool.

While you won't find anything new in terms of plotlines, Ninja Scroll is certainly one of the better Animes in terms of action.  Plenty of fighting scenes, with our protagonist choping away at them.  But be forewarned those who are light of heart, this anime can be quite graphic - the ""blood gushing"" and ""limbs missing"" are in full effect - and thier are a few nudity scenes which are far from artistic.

The characters are hard to get to know in a way because of the dubbing which of course falls below anyone's standards. But this is completely bareable, and you won't take note once the film has got going.

Compared to most western animations and drawings, these images are outstanding, and they are by far good enough to enjoy the film.

665686,5,6303481345,"Three movies--Akira, Ghost In The Shell and Ninja Scroll--each broke new ground and pushed the genre in the mainstream. ""Ninja Scroll"" is the most fun and watchable of these efforts, and despite the fact that it was released in 1996, continues to be among, if not THE best, in ninja/swordsmanship movies.
This is one of those ""three-watchers"": watch once to get acquainted, twice to fully understand, and three times to get the full effect. You could very well leave impressed after your first viewing, but numerous viewings reveal more and more each time.
Wandering ninja Jubei Kibagami (based on a popular swordsman of Japanese lore) is drawn into a battle with the Eight Devils of Kimon, with the beautiful and lethal Kagero on his side, as well as a government agent. Jubei must survive battles with each of the Devils--a rock-skinned hulk, a blind swordsman, a portable wasp hive, a snake-controller, a re-animator/shadow manipulator, a wire-toting electrecutor, an explosives expert and a resurrectable boss--all the while attempting to solve a mystery revolving around gold, murdered villagers and a mysterious plague.
The animation is top-notch. It isn't thin and computer-like, as in Ghost in the Shell, but it's as close as you can get to a moving Marvel or Image Comic. Everything is lightning fast and no sounds are wasted: you'll notice every chirping bird or falling leaf with the tension that this film builds. The shots are masterfully beautiful--a charging Jubei is shown via reflection on the blind swordsman's sword held close to his face--and the animation is consistent throughout.
Not to confuse what you might have heard--the violence is extremely graphic, not the sex scenes. The sex scenes are nothing worse than what an R-rated flick might produce, but the violence is up there in the level of ""Gladiator"" or ""Saving Private Ryan,"" but it's not something that goes throughout the movie so much so that it becomes disgusting.
The English dub is passable, capturing both Jubei's calm confidence as well as Kagero's fire, but like most anime, the Japanese version is the superior. The storyline remains generally the same in either version, although there are some significant, but not plot-disturbing, differences between the English and Japanese versions.
Each ""Devil"" is unique and cleverly thought-out, each a challenging fighter. Jubei is an anti-hero, reluctant to join the fight, and scraps his way through battles, using his smarts as well as his steel.
Definitely recommended for older fans, anime fan or not. It has anime's cliche graphic violence and nudity, but its plot, vocal performance and direction are excellent, among the best ever for the genre. Five stars doesn't do it justice.",1055376000,10,2722,5.160633484162896

He also, like most Japanese heroic characters, shows a sense of nobility, in that the one chance he has to save himself, he refuses for the sake of honoring a woman.

So, I end up buying it and find that to my disdain, it is not at all what it is cracked up to be.

I gotta admit it, at the time this was released I hadn't seen any other animes that impressed me nearly as much as this one did (aside from the obvious AKIRA and later on that year GHOST IN THE SHELL). The story line is great as well. It keeps you intrigued throughout the entire film and it also has some really good twists and turns.
The fight scenes are amazing! They're extremely fluid and fast and there are so many really, really good one in this film. I can't say there isn't one I didn't like (my favorits fight scene, Jubei vs Utsutsu Mojuro, the blind man). Now as usual with most Animes, this one is not for younger viewers at all for a few reasons like the incredible amount of violence, nudity, swearing, sexual content and a rape scenes (involving Kagero, the female Ninja). Granted yes the rape scenea really wasn't too bad but still it was there (but again nothing like LEGEND OF THE OVERFIEND type of rape scene).
This is a highly recommended MUST CHECK OUT! All Anime fans will get into this one, all fantasy and role play lovers will like this one and of course the martial arts fans will drool over this one as well.

665799,5,6303481345,"One tradition of Japanese manga and anime is based on the legends of Yagyu Jubei Mitsuyoshi, who was a very real swordsman serving the Tokugawa Shogunate at the beginning of the 17th century.  Jubei was known for wandering Japan, sometimes as a spy for the Shogun, and righting injustices with displays of his extraordinary swordsmanship.  Kind of a Japanese Knight of the Roundtable.
In 'Ninja Scroll', this part is played by Jubei Kibagami, an itinerant ninja.  He is drawn into clan politics when he comes to the aid of Kagero, a female ninja in service to the Yamashiro clan.  To save Kagero, Jubei must successfully challenge Tessai, an evil ninja (one of the Eight Devils of Kimon) with the ability to turn his skin into stone, and the strength to chop walls down.  Jubei succeeds, but Tessai swears vengeance, leaving Jubei deeply entangled in a struggle with the Shogun of the Dark.
The third player in this contest is Dakuan, the Shoguns spy.  He is a deadly old man who recruits Jubei by giving him a poison that will kill him in a day and a night.  Dakuan informs Jubei that Himuro Gemma, an old enemy that Jubei was sure was dead, was still alive, and, in the company of the Devils, was at the center of the plotting.  Jubei, Dakuan, and Kagero must defeat the evil ninjas and discover the purpose behind the killing of an entire village.
Kagero is a poison taster, and, as a result, is permeated with deadly toxins.  She can never take a lover, because even her kiss would kill.  At this point in Japanese history such a woman was an outcaste, having little value in the eyes of her society.  Jubei shatters her world when he insists on treating her as an honorable human being, creating a strong emotional tension that plays against the simple samurai action of the main plot.
Production qualities of the film are beautiful, echoing traditional Japanese art forms with a fine sensibility.  Line and color are strong.  Violence, of course, is present, but is tightly controlled, not dwelt upon.  This is one of the best and most representative films of the more conservative Japanese traditions of anime.

Violence: Lots of violence, probably the most violent anime I have seen even though I heard that Fist of the North Star was much more violent, the violence factor definately gets a solid R rating even though I have never seen violence like this in a real (non animated) moviel.
Sex: A small rape scene that isn't anything I would call ""hentai"" but still gets a 16+ rating which in Japan is the same thing as an R rating (yup you only gotta be 16 in Japan to watch the mature stuff, even though all ""hentai"" is 18+ in Japan which is the same as NC17 or 18+ rating in U.S.
Nudity: Not too bad, Limited to Breasts and Booty but it shows a few times where the crotch is supposed to be but for some reason it didn't show it, probably to keep this a 16+/R rating and not to take it in to the hardcore hentai rating since around 50% of the people who watch ""samurai"" anime like this are teens (13-18).
Profanity: Not too much profanity, mostly words like S--t, B-tch, and maybe the F words a few times but the profanity is around a pg-13 rating.
Altogether, this anime is sick, disturbing, and to some people a little perverted, so it would probably get a 16+/R rating (for adults or older teens). I hope this review will help parents decide whether to get this for their teens or for teens to hide this from their parents :-)",1032134400,5,1537,4.285223367697594

The devils of Kimon have to be some of the most menacing figures in all of film history.  Brilliant story and great action leave you firmly placed on the edge of your seat for the entire picture.
My wife generally hates anime of all kinds(you should see her face when Dragonball Z comes on.*lol*) and she was even blown away by this masterpiece.

665907,3,6303481345,"The plot is very simple. A wandering ninja (Jubei) is forced to help find out why a village comes under an epidemic, and ends up discovering some very weird supernatural things. Such as an old enemy coming back to life somehow, and working with demons! Well, what essentially happens is Jubei has to find and stop his enemy (with the help of a small govt. spy, and a Ninja Girl), but before he can do that, he has to defeat the demons. Each demon has different powers and skills. One has stone like skin. Another cannot see, but has super hearing. Another has the power of lightning. Finally at the end he discovers why the village had an epidemic and what actually is going on. Throw in very cool action battles, a growing love story, and realized characters, and you have a fun hour and a half. A second watching might be more enjoyable, when you know everything that happens. After that its not very much watchable, except for the battles. The drawing and sound is superb. As extras you have a detailed synopsis, and character bio's, a trailer, and some quick footage of other anime's from this company. All in all, if your a fan of anime, battles, and tales of ninjas you will enjoy this. I will warn you though the film is filled with violence, and has some explicit sexual situations. If that bothers you in any way, you should stay away at all costs. So I give this 3 stars, its a nice tale, but isn't all that fun after your 2nd viewing. Rent first.

665908,1,6303481345,"Personally, it is a grievance upon my heart that so many enjoyed this movie.  I had nothing better to do in high school a few years ago, so I asked my friend (rather, a random guy) to name-drop some epic anime that I could rent.  He/she/it/whatever told me to rent ""Ninja Scroll,"" so I subsequently did so, realizing from those cheesy ""Akira"" commercials that this probably wasn't ""Family Circus"", or even ""Family Guy"".  I tried my best to watch it from an objective point of view, but I think I lost all interest during a particularly nasty scene where 20 guys get sliced literally in half, spewing out blood like Old Faithful during earthquake season.  Of course, the following scene, this really disgusting looking rock golem dude talking trash (and doing much worse, believe me folks) to this girl who oddly enough, must have been resistant to his insanely sharp blade...believe me when I say that what this guy said has to be on my list of one of the most appalling things ever uttered.  Of course, I'm sure fans of hentai can come up with about 100 worse things, just from the title screens.  Anyways, after becoming permanently scarred, I watch a spriteful bit of jumping around non-sensically from place to place, meeting hollow characters along the way, getting in a few family-oriented (i.e. less than enough blood spilled to fill an Olympic-sized swimming pool) fights. Take numerous unforgettable characters like ""Old Toady Codger with the bad voice"", ""Bee Hive Man"" and ""Lady who saves on those costly trips to Big Lots by only wearing Snakes"", add a few unforgettable scenes, like ""big stupid guy gets oddly enough covered in molten gold"", and stick in more blood, violence, and perversion than you can shake an enema at, and you have this timeless flick.",1028764800,8,1769,4.802631578947368

665912,5,6303481345,"For anyone who enjoys explosive action without explosions, then this movie is for you. The movie slides forward contiuously in an effortless arc of great animation and story telling. Any armchair student of sword play will thoroughly enjoy this peice of anime. The central character is only that he ties the other characters together. He is the lead but the story is not necessarily about him. Which makes the wandering samurai story so interesting here. You start to really feel for this character because he responds to the plot as a character and not just a plot device. He is reminiscent of the Jedi (or is it the other way around).
The story turns back and forth between fantasy and adventure. The two often go together but all too aften the one lacks the other. Here they form a brilliant symbiosis that sometimes gets my blood pumping and sometimes scares me. It is art because it excites emotions from me. I don't simply lose my self in mindless action but there is reason for every loosing of the blade. It makes me feel. And it entertains.

It is not for everyone. There is sex. There is violence. The sex is cultural I believe in that the Japanese see sex in a much different light than we seem to. It seems that sex is a part of life. And in life there is sex, so if art imitates life then there is sex in art. The violence sereves the place that in animation if it isn't gory the point is missed. I entirely enjoyed this movie because I'm a fan of the genre. But I'm a fan because I saw this movie. But don't take my word for it!",1027728000,,1542,4.354166666666667
665913,3,6303481345,"This was one of the first annimes I ever saw so this movie totally hit me by surprise with the action, suspense, character development and others.  I gave this movie 3 stars for the following reasons:
Two stars for originality and compelling story.
Totally original and very compelling, I only had to watch it once to get the whole movie unlike other annimes that I have watched.  I was somewhat on the edge of my seat as the action got more and more intense.  I loved the 7 devils and their incredible abilities and how Jubei fought with every one of them, but my favorite part was where he fought in the woods with the blind ninja master.  That part was really cool.
I also gave this movie 1 more star for non-stop edge-of-your-seat action.  I never got board once, I never had to fastforward or skip any parts because of the lame or useless dialogue simply because there was none.  Almost every part of the movie was needed... except for some scenes that I will get into later.  As I said earlier, I loved the action sequences and the non-stop ninja techniques used, even if they were a little far fetched.
Now onto the things I think Manga could have taken out:
There were three sex scenes that I believe could've been taken out altogether.  Sexuality in movies is NOT neccesary unless the circumstances have to allow it such as the rape scene in the General's Daughter.  And the last things was excessive gore.  I thought that the blood spraying, skull splitting, blood drinking and massive loss of limbs was too much.  Gore is also not necessary unless the you have to have it, for example Saving Private Ryan or Enemy at the Gates it was needed whereas here it is not.  However this movie is non the less a great movie and well worth the low price amazon.com has set before you.
Whether you are an annime fan or not, this is the movie for you.",1026777600,2,1850,4.440828402366864

666034,5,6303481345,"I always had a soft side for wandering swordsmen in anime. Probably because I'm privileged to learn the very same martial art that has entertained all of us Ninja Scrollers. The artwork might seem to be in a dated style and quite simple compared to the CG infused eye candy found in Ghost In the Shell, etc. But that doesn't take anything away from the detail and the originality Yoshiaki Kawajiri has shown us in Ninja Scroll. What's timeless is the way he combined over the top action with surprising moments of earthiness recognizable to a trained martial artist who views this film. This is exemplified in the duel against Utsutsu Mujuro, where every masterful stroke was in accordance to the real art of ancient Japanese swordsmanship while at the same time manage to keep you on your seat with it's furious presentation.
However there is a minor detail I just have to mention. Seeing how the title of the film is Ninja Scroll, there's very little evidence that suggests that Jubei himself is a Ninja. I guess it would be fair to say he's a wave man, Ronin, seeing how he fights with the Katana and has an impeccable sense of honor as opposed to the Ninja who fights with the Ninja-To and has little honor. Just thought I mention that because I wouldn't want people to have a confused idea about the Japanese culture.",1024617600,,1322,4.6059322033898304

666036,4,6303481345,"This movie is very good, but unfortunately not perfect.  The fighting is very good in most parts, but very short in my opinion.  The ending fight scene is probably the best out of the whole movie when him and his arch-enemy Gemma duke it out (especially when Jubei headbutts him).  The whole movie is basically about the hero, Jubei, fighting a group of ninjas each with super-human powers.  When you do watch this movie, steer clear of the dub.  Its basically a clone of Wicked City with the same voice actors being re-introduced.
  Also, I've noticed that this movie also (like Wicked City) offers a fair share of female sexual abuse.  It might be because that's how it was back then, but in one scene they show one particular sex-oriented thing that probably could have been left out entirely without hurting the movie one bit (the scene where the shadow ninja captures Kigero).
  Otherwise, this movie was a delight to watch, but its not near worth the hype that surrounds it.  I would still reccomend the DVD to true fans of the Anime and ninja type shows.
NOTE:  This movie features a ninja named Jubei but has nothing to do with another show that is very similar to it called Ninja Resurrection.  Both shows have ninjas as the base of attraction and a hero named Jubei, but neither have anything to do with each other.  Two different companies, two different shows.",1021507200,,1372,4.639004149377594

Since then, the mind has matured in the way of anime, and this one is still near the top.

The action was pretty nice, I just wished the fight scenes were longer.

The villians are also great, they are all different, all very cool, and all put up a hell of a fight.

666042,4,6303481345,"Where the stiff and boring ""Demon City Shinjuku"" failed, ""Ninja Scroll"" succeeds. A budding and fitting example of mature anime, ""Ninja Scroll"" is the kind of movie you should watch without too many expectations.
For the most part, ""Ninja Scroll"" manages to get many factors right. The animation is some of best I've ever seen in an anime movie, and the characters, while not perfect, are interesting and likeable. The story, thankfully, isn't another version of a ""lonely warrior, along with a beautiful woman he's going to lay sometime in the movie, must save the world from a powerful evil before it's too late."" Instead, it plays out more like an ""X-Files"" episode, where the plot changes unexpectedly from time to time, although the plot twists won't surprise everyone. The amount of action is also satisfying, albeit extremely gory, and several of the evil characters are some of the coolest villians to appear in anime (although many of them are only seen for about five minutes).
But ""Ninja Scroll"" does fall short in a few areas. To up the mature rating, several sex scenes are scattered throughout the movie, all are gratuitious, and one in particular is completely unnecessary. Also, the plot, while not stereotypical, does have some pacing and execution problems, and the ending of the movie wasn't particularly satisfying, nor did it make any sense.
All in all, ""Ninja Scroll"" as a whole is a movie that is questionable but ultimately satisfying. It is a very mature work of anime, but probably not as mature as ""Wicked City"" and ""Legend of the Overfiend"". I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone under 18 or to anyone who hates extreme violence or extreme sexual situations.",1011744000,11,1690,4.933333333333334

Not exactly what you would want to watch in front of your kids as there a few sexual situations and a bit of nudity and gore.  Overall this is a near perfect film and I kept forgetting that it was animated.  You feel like everyone in it is real.  A must-see, especially for someoen who is not yet an anime fan.

While he is at it, he joins up with a sexy but literally dangerous ninja girl named Kagero and a wise old man to find the mysterious Shogun Of The Dark and his army of demons that want to overthrow the Japanese government. Could his old friend now turned foe named Gemma has came back from the dead? is his past coming back to haunt him?

One of the best Japanese animated movies of all time and the best animated movie of the action/fantasy genre. There is some sleaze thrown in with a brief but not too subtle rape scene (Not as bad as Urotsukidoji though) with animated nudity at times and of course graphic animated gore/violence galore such as head slicing and dicing like you've seen in ""Fist of the North Star"", this movie is truly director Yoshiaki Kawajirri's finest movie besides Vampire Hunter D Bloodlust and a worthy anime feature. The film is kind of sleazy at times yet even graphic on the violence at times but this movie provides non-stop action you would see in a Hollywood movie and there's amazing sword fight sequences that will blow your mind and the animation is excellent as well. Kagero is quite a tragic woman as she has the unique ability to poison anyone who sleeps with her or makes love with her though she has feelings for the poisoned Juebi as there is a heartbreaking moment that will touch your heart. I also like that this is a love story that is subtle yet not too sappy as this movie is everything that a guy and anime fan needs.

This special edition DVD provides both fullscreen and widescreen editions with cool extras like itnerviews with the cast and director, history of Juebi feature, character snyposis and photo galleries, English and Japanese in subtitles versions and trailers to this and other Manga entertainment releases. Now if this was released on Blu-Ray i would love to see it in high-definition.

Such films as ""Perfect Blue"" and ""Ghost in the Shell"" blend all of these things together and form classic Anime. However ""Ninja Scroll"" neatly fits in with these films, but may not have all the attributes I prefer. The film has unbelievable action sequences, but for the most part that's it. Yet I'm drawn to this film, as if it had a good, detailed story, and good dialogue. The animation is top of the line, and the films runs smooth. The story is viable, but the main character, Jubei, is relentless when it comes to his foes, not including his just a plain bad (...)!

What can I say Ninja Scroll was off da hook!!! For all those that didn't like NS pick up your toys and go back to watching your Pokemon. This is a real man's anime!
I loved every minute of NS. The animation, fight scenes, and the characters were awesome!! There wasn't a thing that I didn't like about the movie. Everything in NS flows smoothly. Near the end a lot of things are made clear. For example you learn why the ninja woman's beauty is considered a curse and why fate has pulled Jubei into this war. This movie is something that the hardcore adult anime fan can enjoy. If you like gore, a little nudity, and excellent fight scenes in your anime then this is the title for you!
I suggest Ninja Scroll for 17+ due to all the nudity and violence it contains. Ninja Scroll will be a classic throughout the ages and it's safe to say that it's one that I'll NEVER get tired of!!!",1003622400,,1270,4.340336134453781
666236,5,6303481345,"If there is one anime movie that many of my friends say is a must-buy, many of them would say ""Ninja Scroll"".
""Ninja Scroll"" follows the adventures of a masterless Ninja named Jubei who teams up with a female ninja named Kagero and sometimes with a lying old man named Dakuan and in their journey they go against an evil team of murderers with their own style of killing and in the end Jubei must battle an enemy from his past who he thought was dead. The movie combines the Feudal Japan with the supernatural.
For one thing, it's not the typical nonsense anime which includes violence, blood, sex, etc. There's actually a deep storyline to this series. Very involving, very bloody but the way it is presented, makes it very good.
Again, the anime is violent. So, if you are faint at heart and can't stand anime like this, stay away from ""Ninja Scroll"".
It's been several years now since I first saw this movie and to see it on DVD is really great. Of course, the Digital 5.1 Surround Sound mix is awesome but for a non-dub fan like myself, I was hoping the Japanese version may have been remastered but it's OK. Manga Entertainment is one of the few companies which puts voice acting as a priority, so I'm proud to say that the English dub + the 5.1 sounds great!
As for the DVD itself, since it's an older anime and an older DVD release, you're not going to find that much in terms of special features. There is a little character info section but that's mainly it (unless you count trailers).
If you like anime series based in the Feudal Japan era and the supernatural, ""Ninja Scroll"" ranks up at the top along with ""Hakkenden"" and ""Rurouni Kenshin"".",1002931200,4,1653,4.458745874587459

Well, anyways, its a good movie, lots of great fighting scenes, good storyline, great characters (Jubeis' the MAN, and Kagero is so cute when she tries to act all tough, I just wanna hug her and kiss her when she talks so mean...ok, sorry, I'm not sure what happened there), there is also a LITTLE romance between Jubei and Kagero.

Ninja Scroll is one such movie that successfully entertains with the story of Jubei Chan, a fierce ninja who must battle demons and find an antedote for a slow working poison working away at his insides.  The film is full of gruesome scenes of violence and impressive visuals.  It also contains much nudity that follows the graphic nature of the animation, but might otherwise be considered unnecessary.  By the end of the movie, Jubei and his female counterpart have encountered many obstacles and have grown in character, but the development seems a little uneven.

666241,4,6303481345,"I am sure that I am not alone in acclaiming Ninja Scroll to be one of the foremost achievements in the field of anime since Akira.  The construction of the heroic archetype in Jubei, the not-quite-helpless and thoroughly paradoxical figure of Kagero, the cunningly wise Dakuan, each takes us back to a time not of fairy tale, but of myth, where supernatural powers were to be feared.  The Devils of Kimon provide a worthy balance to the heroic elements.  If this were all, it would still be a solid tale, but the Devils are more than just villains.  In fact, it is debatable whether or not one of them, Utsutsu Mujuro, is more strictly ""honorable"" than the hero himself, and because of this, we are constantly called on to reassess the place of the hero within the story.  The film is violent, and occasionally is a little excessive in that.  It is not overly nor gratuitously sexualized, however: the scenes involving Kagero are all necessary for moving the plot forward.
This movie was one of my first experiences with serious anime, and it opened up an entire level of interpretation whereby ""cartoons"" suddenly were not solely within the demesne of children.",1001721600,,1162,4.756218905472637

For a DVD I cannot fathom for the life of me how that got through.
As to the [explicit] scenes... it seems as though there were cut from the version of the movie that I was watching.  I saw a VHS version which was much more explicit.  I'd wonder if anyone else noticed it.

The plot and characters are thought out (at least by anime standards).  The animation is beautiful.  The action is as exciting as anything live action that you'll see.  It's a great film to watch over and over again, so you can understand more of the political intrigue that is going on.
The basic story is of a wandering warrior who falls into a situation beyond his control.  O.k., it's not the most original story, but they execute it very well.  Just watch the movie.  Don't rent it, because you're going to end up buying it anyway.

I was excpecting something great and found something mediocre. Yeah, it was okay to watch once, and I guess we all have to do it, but it's not something that I'll watch over and over and over again like Utena. In a word, it was dissapointing.

666437,5,6303481345,"Yes, I said it one line ago and I'll say it again: NINJA SCROLL is one of the best animated films (western or not) ever. I rented this on vague recomendations and loved it so much I had to add it to my collection. It is more enjoyable than most of the other anime films I've seen as well.  Usually, my enjoyment of an anime film is somewhat limited since anime flicks tend to be visually appealing but uneven, and alternate pretentous talk involving some sort of shallow atheistic mysticism with outrageous and often inventively gruesome battles between beings of unimaginable power (Usually in a nightmarish futuristic or Post-Apocalyptic Tokyo). Usually, they have disappointingly vague endings, and they are almost always based on a Manga. However, my admiration for the artistry and detail of anime allows me to set aside their typically impenitrable plots and award most of them with a marginal ""thumbs up"".  Then I saw NINJA SCROLL, and my opinion of anime changed forever.  Hence, it is quite refreshing to see an anime film that dosen't favor a gloomy BLADE RUNNER/MAD MAX setting, but instead is set in medeval japan, and we can ascertain much about it from it's breif but rich canvas which often suggests a world of warfare, political struggles, intrigue, plagues, and terrifyingly powerful devils who toy both directly and indirectly with the lives of humans and there are more than 2 sides in these conflicts.
The hero is Jubei, a lone sword master who is pierless but honorable. He is as skilled as he is tough, not to mention salty and intelligent. However, unlike most other anime protagonists, Jubei has no super powers and is quite mortal, despite his ability to withstand an incredible ammount of punishment. Vulnerability is key for any hero. Jubei reluctantly finds himself blackmailed into working with an old wizard with ulterior motives in the conflict, as well as Kagero, a ninja girl who's body is poisonous (er...I'll just leave this part alone now.)
This isn't a story of Good vs. Evil, either. There is hardly a scene in NINJA SCROLL where everything is as clear as black and white. Even the Devils themselves are given to petty squabbles and machinations and often find ways to dispose of each other. Each enemy is unique and displays some awesome power. One commands wasps from a hive in his back. A cruel humanoid with rock-like skin (Who seems to have read Beowulf as well) hurls a double edged sword like a boomerang. Another fiend hides in the shadows and shoots a mechanical barbed claw. Yet despite how powerful these enemies are, they are not invincible.
NINJA SCROLL has an intriguing and complicated plot with well-developed protagonists and villains. The pacing is fast, and unlike other anime, which grab our attention by presenting us with sexuality, NINJA SCROLL does so by using it. And at about the halfway point, an astounding thing happened: I found myself caring about the characters. Even my mom, who hates most anime and anything in a HEAVY METAL vein (and who has the annoying habbit of walking in during the most disturbing scenes of any animated film) detested this film at first but found herself liking it as well.

666617,5,6303481345,"Ninja Scroll is the work of director Yoshiaki Kawajiri and was released in 1995. It is the story of Kibagami Jubei, a master-less samurai that wanders feudal Japan and hires his craft and his sword to whoever can pay-or whoever has a decent cause. He one day stumbles on the village of Shimoda, where the whole populace has apparently succumbed to a deadly plague and where a ninja clan has been recently annihilated by a demon. Stopping to rescue the only ninja left alive-a beautiful girl named Kagero-he unwittingly becomes part of a story that mixes shogunate politics, demonic warriors, a cachet of gold large enough to tilt the kingdom on its ear and the return of his most hated foe, Himuro Gemma.
The animation is some of the best I've ever seen. The colors are lush and full. The tone changes constantly and fits the mood perfectly. From the dark corners to the lit fields, the contrast in Ninja Scroll provides it with another layer with which to tell its story. As for the action, well, I wish all animes had action like this. Anyone who's seen Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon can tell you that the rooftop scenes are nothing compared to the ones found here. There you had two persons jumping, here whole clans of ninja leap into the air and face off against Jubei. You have some dastardly demons with strange powers-including their leader, Gemma, who cannot die. (The solution to this problem is both very fitting and very appropriate). The sound is also finally given its due. From the thunk of shurikens to the crashing of Tessai's sword through tree and ninja to the flapping of Mushizo's wasps, you can now hear it as beautifully as was recorded. The best scene for sound, though, is the fight between Jubei and Mujuru (the blind swordsman). All of a sudden, the sound Jubei makes becomes very important. The simple rustling of leaves and movement of grass becomes enthralling-because they could all lead to Jubei's demise.",983836800,12,1938,4.753709198813056

For a start, numerous scenes of blood and gore, and other scenes of extreme sexual nature, serve to differentiate this film from the films we usually watch. Then there are the awe inspiring animation that totally annihilates Disney, and the DVD's technical prowess that helps with a fine picture quality and aggressive 5.1 sound.
But overall what distinguishes this film more than others is the fact it is totally different than western films. The cultural difference is expressed in the plot, in character development, and in the general way the film progresses.

The story follows Jubei Shigakura (Japan's greatest swords man) who has gotten in trouble with a group of demons while at the same time doing a favor for an old man, taking revenge on a man he killed and helping a woman named Kageto. The actions scenes (which feature everything from decapitation to slicing) are terrific. The designs of the demon are great with each on possessing a different power (rock, snake, bees, locusts, shadows and electricity). There is extreme violence like when the rock demon tears off both arms of a man and drinks the blood from them. The dub is extremely well done at some points and I guess I can't complain. The story is extremely close to the plot of Wicked City, its scary. However, unlike Wicked City, Jubei and Kageto never get it on and the little old guy is way more mature then the one in Wicked City. There are some rather occult themes like that of Wicked City, but they're not frequent.

(Also because of the fact that a little old man ""poisons him and forces him to fight"".

The first thing to realize about Ninja Scroll is that it really is not for the squeamish.  Throughout the movie there are gallons of blood, limbs, bodies, a rape scene and also a scene with a snake and a woman (actually, there are tons of snakes but there is one in particular that will probably surprise you at least a little).  There really isn't any time when there isn't either nudity or death after the first few minutes in the movie.

If you can stomach the violence and perversition you will find a well animated movie with a good, if standard, plot.  The animation is very well done and the action sequences (and there are a lot) are easy enough to follow.  While I thought some of the character designs were fairly annoying (especially the snake lady's face), they are animated well and individual enough to be able to identify each character with no problem (even those that you see only twice throughout the movie).  The plot itself is fairly stock, but it works well in the context.  A wandering swordsman is recruited by an old man to fight eight demons as well as a man that swordsman thought he had slain years ago.  The two are also joined by a woman swordsman whose body is too toxic to for any intimate contact (though that is by no means a deterent of her getting naked a few times).  After the characters are introduced it basically becomes one long drawn out fight with the plot trudging along in the background.

The music in this film is pretty good.  Maybe not something you would rush out to buy on a CD later, but it moves the movie along well enough and contributes to the action.  The sound fx fit very well and seem to work well with the action on the screen.

In the end I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good samurai flick or to anyone who likes tons of bloodletting.  Again, though, keep it away from the youngins.",981331200,20,2137,4.410714285714286

I reccomend this movie to any anime fans, people just getting into anime, or anybody looking for violence in a good story unlike a porno without a good storyline.

The three encounter various ninja warriors (8 in total) and eventually each is basically killed in really cool ways...
Moving on, in comparison to Wrath of the Ninja--this film is kickass... hands down. I had never seen Ninja Scroll before, only Wrath of the Ninja... I was really missing something in my life... as Wrath of the Ninja was a bit too basic, a bit dark and boring. The beauty of Ninja Scroll is it's colour and direction of animation... not to mention the surround sound (English audio). This is followed up by the immense amount of blood and nekkid women. To say the least it's a crowd pleaser.
Moving on to the DVD details, the only thing I noticed in comparison to the VHS (which I taped in EP) and the DVD is the detail in the colour blending. Other than that... it's just as good. If you're looking for extras... there's not much there really. There's brief bios for the characters, a trailer (in Japanese) and two commercials for Manga. But if you're a KMFDM fan like I am... you'll take interest in the Manga video commercial with crystal clear audio and video. The only drawback to this package is that it's only presented in full screen and not widescreen. That and the disc art sucks. But other than those... it's worthy of slapping down 20 to 35 bucks.

 Just so you'll know where I'm coming from, let me tell you up front that I'm not an anime fanboy.  Not because I don't like it - ""Ninja Scroll"" is the first full-length animated Japanese film I've seen.  So this review will be from the point of view of a neophyte.
 The opening of this film is marked by extremely choppy storytelling.  Three separate, apparently unrelated scenes draw us into the movie, creating mystery and suspense.  What's the mysterious plague?  Who are the dark riders?  Well, it will eventually come clear, but in a murky sort of way.
 As a neophyte, I was shocked by two things - first, the seemingly low-quality animation, which I've been told is a hallmark of Japanese film, and second, the explicit sexual content.  One reviewer here has suggested that one should not allow a child younger than 13 to see this film.  I don't think I'm a prude, but I would still raise that age to 17.  The rape and torture scenes are somewhat excruciating, and there is one scene with a serpent that is downright horrifying.
 That said, there is a certain minimalist beauty to this film that the non-squeamish will appreciate.  The villains are remarkable; a seemingly invincible stone-skinned man, a tattooed woman who controls snakes, a twisted dwarf whose hunchback is actually a wasp's nest built into his flesh - these guys ain't Disney villains, that's for sure!
 I watched the DVD with the English dub and the actors were very disappointing - they sounded kind of dull and mushmouthed, like an average American teenager, bringing no drama to their various readings.  Also, they were a little cliched, with the gruff-voiced bad guys all sounding as though they had had colds and the good guys sounding like the cast of Beverly Hills 90211.
 Overall, I enjoyed ""Ninja Scroll"" and will probably view other Japanese animated films.  If you aren't easily put off by extreme sex or violence, you may like it, too.",974419200,4,1941,4.777777777777778

This is a very smart piece of work made for adults!
I love Sci-Fi and Fantasy, and have always believed that anime was by  far the best way to put it on screen. But unfortunately, when left in the  hands of Americans producers concerned only with making money- the movie  gets ""dumbed up"" so everyone can understand it, and/or made ""safe and  silly"" so kids will want to see it. Ninja Scroll does not. This is  hard-hitting fantasy at its best. It has ninjas. It has demons. It has  blood. It has curses. It's sexually explicit. It's not for the timid.

A mysterious disease has wiped out  the town of Shimota. A band of ninjas sets out to  investigate reports of  a band of men who fled the town shortly before everyone died. As they  approach the town, a rock-like creature slices the entire band apart, save  for Kagero, a female  warrior, whom he captures and rapes. Jubei saves her  and finds himself attracted to her.

As is the  case of most anime I've seen, this isn't for kids. Along with the blood,  there's quite a bit of sexual  content too. The film's not rated, but it  would probably earn an R rating. The screenplay is the work of Yoshiaki  Kawajiri, who also directed.

The movie is gory and it  is not cheap in it's blood letting.  Limbs are ripped off, bodies are cut  in half and faces are pounded.  However, this is the appeal of anime.  They  can realistically (for a cartoon) show the fantastic that live movies  cannot.
The animation is far above par here.  The forests, characters,  shadows are all drawn with a slickness that is found in great anime such as  Ghost in the Shell.  It is amazing to see how much anime has improved over  time.  Watch this, then watch Black Magic M-66 (1988).  You'll notice how  much better this 1993 film is.
The characters are all video game nature,  and that also will appeal to most anime fans.

667091,5,6303481345,"I will not say something amazingly original if I use that ""if you are going to see one anime in your lifetime see that one"" phrase. But it fits perfectly.
I've tried to enjoy a lot of anime afterwards but in  vain. The genre seems to be mostly unaccessible to a middle-brow Western  viewer - it puzzles me, irritates and I push the STOP button long before  the credits appear, accompanied by a sweet-voiced Japanese song. Then I  tell my son it's all hopeless and I don't wanna see the stuff made by  robots for robots any more.
It's strange, because I am not ignorant of  the workings of Japanese mind. I've read and enjoyed immensely The Tale Of  Genji, The Pillow Book(see the review), Heike monogatari and lots more.
Still the 95% of anime is beyond me.
Ninja Scroll is a classic quest  with the fearless hero and the very lovely heroine condemned by fate - the  characters you can care about. There is a mystery to solve, the adversaries  with a very different fighting style that make all the action scenes  captivating. The film overflows with emotion - love in it's gay and  straight varieties,the sense of duty, betrayal, resolve, revenge, fierce  glee, lust and devotion. The magic is not as weird and outlandish as we are  used to expect from Japanese produce.
The graphics are great - I do not  want them any better. English language track is 5.1, but my son and nephew  always insist on the Japanese stereo - it provides them with the phrases to  memorize and cry out while having their try at the flying kicks.
Yes,  there is some gore and sexually explicit scenes but a much more horrible  things are readily accessible by pushing a few buttons in the home  computer. So I try to minimize the damage by dealing with these scenes  jockingly - there is no sense in sitting through them in embarassed stupor,  you have to react somehow, to comment.

The film's plot is actually pretty simple.  After a ninja team is wiped out trying to infiltrate a  headquarters believed to belong to a group of demonic creatures, three  vagabonds hook up and decide to try and fathom out the cause of the chaos  and more importantly stop it.
Nice plot, but I've heard it all before you  say.  Well if you've heard the story at least watch the awesome sequences!  First of all battle sequences, every single one is absolutely amazing from  the jaw dropping opening sequence involving a group of Koga ninja to the  excellent battle between the leader of the group and the talented Jubei  kubigari.
The animation is fantastic as well.  With the sword blades  blurrng in flight, great attention to detail on the characters movements  and wonderful Japanese scenery.
The idea of a group of demons being  hunted down sounds all too familiar of 1950's of B movies, but don't let  that belief blind you, as this is an awesome film in everyway.
Go out and  buy immediately!  This has to be one of the best ever anime films.  And you  would be a fool to miss out on it...",963100800,,1209,4.5092592592592595

My answer is always, ""Get Ninja  Scroll.""  In my mind, Ninja Scroll is the perfect introduction to  anime because it stands on its own as a great movie, not just great anime.  Anyone, anime-fan or not, can enjoy it.  It has a classic storyline  including a pair of strangers cooperating (albeit often in conflict with  each other) to defeat a series of increasingly difficult enemies.  With a  touch of humor, a dash of sex, a twisting plotline, and generous amounts of  action/violence, Ninja Scroll is a very well-rounded and compelling  view.

The bits and pieces of history and  the accuracy paid to the priod are excellent. Yet this film is not for the  meek or for children. This is by far one of the more violent Animes that I  have seen.
Jubei is a wandering swordsman whom is a master of the sword  and a man of honor. When a dark figure from Jubies past returns Jubei is  forced into battle to prevent a plan that could very well change the course  of Japans history forever. With Kegero and Dakuan by his side Jubei must  fight the servents of darkness known as the eight devils of Kimone.
The  sword fights are absolutly incredible, especially when Jubei enters a  rooftop battle with the ninjas from the Shogun of the Dark. The voices are  also excellent, especially Jubei. The music is at times calm and relaxing  but can quickly turn into the music of war. The sound of swords clashing is  great. This video is a must for any anime fan and or fan of Sameria films.

The characters are nothing short of cool.  Jubei is the coolest  character you will ever see in an anime to date.  Kagero is one of the most  abused anime characters I've ever seen, and it's sad to see what happens to  her at the end.  The 8 Devils of Kimon are hardly present throughout most  of the whole movie, mainly because most of them die in less than 5 minutes,  but it's still a wonderful movie.  Gemma is a character you're gonna hate,  period.
The story is not quite as evolved as the characters, though.  It's simply about Jubei killing the 8 Kimon Devils in order to help an  crazy old agent from the Tokugowa Shogunate named Dakuan.  Even so, the  story is merely an extra in this anime, and can be put away for it's mere  cheesieness.  The characters are the real meat in this anime.

The fighting scenes, story line, plot, and everything else  is on point. This movie starts out with a ninja named jubei who comes  across this gang on the bridge who tries to rob him. Jubei plays it cool  and kills them all in almost one blow without even breaking a sweat. The  funny part was one of the gang members was a miget but was on stilts  covered by a robe til jubei cut him down to size. After this he hooks up  with a female ninja named kangero. Together they go on a mission to find  the monster who is responsible for all the deaths taking over their  homeland. All the main enemy's and good guys have some kind of special  power. A good example is Jubei with his lightening speed moves and the boss  who is able to re-incarnate himself. This is only a sample of whats to  really come in this movie. The enemeys that they will come across will  leave u speechless and for some..u might not be able to take some of the  scenes..they should have labeled this (Parental advisory)...yeah it's that  graphic!

667358,4,6303481345,"Usually when martial arts action flicks are made, things like character development and a decent plot are placed on the backburner. It's refreshing to see a martial arts anime that delivers on all counts.
The first thing  you'll notice are the incredible visuals. The artwork and animation are  superb, with a realistic style seen too rarely in anime. The voice acting  was also pretty good. Kagaro could've been voiced a little better, but she  was passable.
While the premise (lone ninja takes on various bad guys)  sounds typical of this genre, the plot actually has some depth to it. It  even gets somewhat confusing at times, and has enough intrigue and plot  twists to keep things interesting.
The characters are another strong  point. The hero, Jubei, is your typical lone-wolf tough guy, but he has  enough charisma to get by. He is supported by Kagaro, a female ninja, and  Dakuwan, who reminds me of Yoda.
The villains featured, are simply  excellent. Each of the Eight Devils of Kimon are unique in appearance,  style, and personality (or lack of it). They also (thankfully) do not  appear in successive order of toughness.
But what about the main reason  for watching a film of this genre: pure martial arts action. The action  sequences are inventive with some neat tricks on part of the combatants.  Most of the time things are relatively believable, except for a couple  bits. In one sequence, a rather exaggerated battle is staged as Jubei falls  into the ""hero loses it and everyone dies"" cliche. There are also  a couple of unnecessary romantic sappy moments. Some people may disagree,  but I found the whole romantic subplot a little corny.
Aside from a  couple eye-rolling moments, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. For great  martial arts action, Ninja Scroll is probably the best of its genre.",957052800,,1814,4.8980263157894735

However, Ninja Scroll is far the most enjoyable to  watch.  But this review is not a comparison of the three.
I would like to  praise the writer/director of Ninja Scroll for creating such an exciting  and artistic work while at the same time retelling the ancient tale of the  reluctant hero.  The plot was sufficient enough to withstand the weight of  the amazing action sequences and fun sexual content.  The character  development was superb.  Jubei (the hero) is not portrayed an all-powerful  superhero.  Instead, we just see a gifted fighter with an immense will to  survive.
The action scenes are among the best I have ever seen, with  battle choreography that is comparable to that of the best filmakers.  The  villians are imaginitive and original, not to mention devious.  The plot is  extremely imaginitive, touching on topics that are not common to the  ""super robots and cute little girls"" world of Japanese Anime:  love triangles, rape, greed, self esteem, and homosexuality. This film was  enjoyable from beginning to end, and if you are searching to expand your  collection into something new, pick up this DVD.  Its pure enjoyment.",956966400,18,1318,4.881818181818182

Someone had asked if I want o see a japanese cartoon and I was thinking  Voltron, speed racer, etc.  I pick up more and more every time I watch it,  about the different characteristics of the devils and the ninjas and the  different clans.  The violence and the nastiness are unparallelled,  the little monk (who is responsible for the title of this review) is funny,  yet very interesting in this set up which is not so easily broken down into  good and evil. Kagero's clan leader, even kagero, the monk, all are  actually quite bitter, unenthusiastic pawns involved in twists of  inevitability leading to the final fight.  Your best bet, of course, is  not to take it too seriously but to simply enjoy. I suggest this movie for  all small children for the excellent values that it instills as well.

Unfortunately, hype is a double edged sword that can either  make or break a film's(i.e. Ghost in the Shell) mystique and charm to begin  with. On the other hand, only an elite few can fit the mold and live up to  the expectations. In my opinion, Jubei and his pals have accomplished just  that. Ninja Scroll offers what have led millions to join the anime craze to  begin with. Action, over the top yet realistic characters, a subtle plot,  and a gorefest of monsters and men run rampant in this samurai/ninja flick.  The fight scenes and background are top-notch that ooze drama every second.  The characters are charming (although somewhat underdeveloped and badly  dubbed) and interesting enough to give each a specific amount of attention.  So with all these compliments, why not give it a perfect score? Well, it  may have lived up to it's hype as an artistic action film piece, but it's a  little low on the depth department. It's standard anime style story leaves  a little more to be desired.

667649,4,6303481345,Pretty good plotline and story.  It can be a tad confusing at times so you'll have to follow.  It was a tad more gory than I originally expected but hey back in those times people weren't exactly clean in battle  techniques.  Any ways this would probably suit pretty well in a person's  anime collection.  So just consider this one but don't make it top prioty  of video's on your wishlist.,945907200,,390,4.485714285714286
667650,5,6303481345,"This story has everything.  Love, blood, adventure, and glory.  A very well organized plot with several interesting characters.  Jubei Kimagami, Koga Ninja Kagero, and the eight devils of Kimon will make you want to see  this movie several times.  If you want to follow the plotline, pay  attention. (just like in any anime).  If you are bored and just want to see  some action, sit back and relax.  This movie is ideal for anytime. The time  period in which it is set is perfect as well.  The only fault this movie  has is that we never see the ""Shogun of the Dark,"" but he isn't  really all that necessary anyway.  Besides, when you leave a character  often referred to but never seen out of the movie, that leaves us with a  perfect antagonist for a sequel.",945820800,,760,4.477941176470588
667651,4,6303481345,"As far as relatively empty, popcorn action anime is concerned, you always leave the theater (or your living room) rather disappointed. Yes, there's huge robots, or ninjas, or whatnot, but unless you are a (big) fan of the  genre, not every anime movie is really that watchable.
Enter Ninja  Scroll.
While sidestepping the usual tenets of anime that every film must  have robots or cute schoolgirls, it still deals with something fairly  Japanase: the Ninja. And while I'm sure profound dramas exits about how  difficult it is to lead the life of a ninja and what not, 'Ninja Scroll' is  not one of these movies.
Playing out like a video game, 'Ninja Scroll'  establishes its introduction (let's call them 'cut scenes') and within a  few minutes brings you into the storyline, which goes like this: Jubei, our  hero and protagonist, must fight a menagerie of bad guys, all with cool  powers. One has a weapon that splits opponents in half, another houses a  beehive in his back, yet another can transport himself through  shadows.
Sounds cool, eh? The animation and pacing live up to their  name... Ninja Scroll has the possibility of ruining all other anime for  you...
Granted, it's not as extensive as 'Neon Genesis Evangelion'  (apparently the apex of anime) or 'Perfect Blue' (another good film from  this year), but it is damn good nonetheless and a fine first DVD for anyone  interested in the genre.
For kids? There's plenty of gore and blood, and  a heap of oversexual content (including a rape scene)... Wouldn't recommend  it for anyone under 13 or younger.",945216000,28,1567,4.845283018867924
667652,4,6303481345,"As a anime title this is one of the finest examples of animation centering on the mystique of the ninja. Jubei is a masterless ninja who is hired for profit, however the intervention of several demons controlled by the shogun  of the dark make life very unpleasent for him. This film has quality  animation as well as good voice actors. Overall it makes a worthy addition  to any video collection. If this video appeals then it is recommended that  you look at the cyber city oedo 808 collection, which takes the concept of  the ninja lifestyle and places it in the context of the future.",944438400,2,588,4.561904761904762

Although I believe that the ending could have been a little  bit more creative, who can complain with an anime (let's not bring movies  into this considering the fact that they are still horrible with creating a  realistic fantasy with all of the graphical abilities they have) that  delves into the fantastical by creating characters with powers that seem,  in some respects, impossible and limited.

The story line is good and the animation is excellent. For those out  there who thought that this movie was mysogynistic, keep in mind that the  Japanese have different attitudes towards sex and women than Americans do.  Being a student of Japanese language and culture myself, I have to contend  that this movie is very Japanese.

668196,5,6303481345,"First, regarding its name: a more accurate translation from the original Japanese would be ""The Chronicles of Ninja Jubei.""
Second, regarding the ""misogynism"" in the film: While I understand how it  might be interpreted that way, that's not quite true. Kagero is a  fascinating character due to the tragedy of her curse. She plays a pivotal  role in the story, but most importantly, the ultimate point of the love  subplot is that Jubei's sense of honor is so strong and his heart is so  pure that he will not use her as just a weapon or an object of lust, the  way everyone else has used her. Even at the cost of his life (you will  understand when you see it). That's what makes it such a powerful  story.
This movie isn't for everyone, but it's an incredible film. It's  extremely intense, so sensitive viewers should beware. The animation is  beautiful; the action is intense and intelligently choreographed, not  mindless and brutal; the plot is highly intricate and very well  written.
