3597296,5,B001G79HAK,"A film sequel to the fantasy history world of Merlin.  This man is a magician of the secret world who in turn got into this service thru family heredity.  If you realize truth/real world/, sorcery/evil-witchcraft, and common sense then you will enjoy this rendition.  If there was more portrayal on Arthur's wife Gwenivere, the Lady of the Lake, and Merlin's teacher/soldier of truth; it would be a little more interesting.",1262822400,,423,5.014285714285714
3597297,1,B001G79HAK,"I did not bother finishing the movie.  Although i have a very short attention span, the tongue-in-cheek CGI effects could not compensate for bad acting, florid speech, all too predictable plot and a music score that prompted much laughter.  It is actually not that bad a movie but unless you are on a cross continent bus ride and you forgot your ipod, books, magazines, newspapers and have no wish to talk to your neighbour, you have little reason to pay for this movie.

3597298,5,B001G79HAK,I can honestly say I have no words to describe how this film affected me....,1238976000,2,76,4.133333333333334
3597299,1,B001G79HAK,"This movie was with out a doubt one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It is along the same caliber as really poor written/acted/directed/produced cheesy SciFi movies that have laughable effects. We are science fiction fans and have watched many, many horrific movie of the week productions on SciFi but had trouble sitting through this movie.

The movie started out fine, I'd say the first 15 minutes were tolerable. But then it starts making weird storyline jumps and you wonder ""well how did he get there"" or ""where did that come from."" My husband and I sat wondering what the heck was going on! The plot line is vague and just seems to be missing most of the story. The acting is just plain AWFUL. The effects were as bad as we expected them to be.

We started drinking at the beginning of the movie and got wasted by the end of the movie and honestly, that made it really funny and was the only redeeming quality of it. It's a hilarious film to watch if you are drunk. We added quite a bit of missing dialog with our drunkenly witty commentary and banter.

I pity the person that actually buys this DvD, I pity myself for renting it using the Video on Demand service and paying $3.",1238371200,,1187,4.410958904109589
3597300,5,B001G79HAK,"Good movie.  Good plot.  Good story telling.  A young Merlin who only begins to shape the things to come.  Bravo!!!  Maybe a sequel of times with Uther wouldn't be so bad.  Uther carried Excalibur for a time, maybe he wasn't the bad man we were all led to believe.",1235952000,12,264,4.285714285714286

One thing though.. the song on the end credits 'Chain of Promise' that Sanya Mateyas sings is particularly awesome...I haven't had any luck finding it online, but it's really great.",1227830400,9,424,4.592105263157895
3597303,4,B001G79HAK,"MERLIN and the War Of The Dragons
  Theasylum.cc
Directed By Mark Atkins, Starring Jurgen Prochnow
Dragons are beloved by the film watchers , They have a mystique that takes us away from Wall Street and Bail Outs.
The dragons are depicted awesomely , CGI never looked so good in a film, Congrats to Tiny Juggernaut-again.
The acting brings you in to this time of past, No actor let us down with unreal emoting.
Jurgen Prochnow ,  Of  DUNE fame; Could have phoned in his performance, BUT Prochnow does a great job as Mage and Mentor to Merlin.
Great cover art, Great acting and let's face it you picked because of the dragons and the unusual way they exist is plausible.
Whenever a film from The Merlin/King Arthur school is released we wonder if people go back to the source, Read a book or seek out earlier Knights Of The Round Table movie/tv fare.",1227398400,2,849,4.529411764705882
3597304,2,B001G79HAK,"A valiant attempt at retelling one version of the Merlin/Excalibur story, filled with dragons and magic. Filmed in Wales with beautiful panoramic shots of the countryside scattered throughout the film, it tells the tale of Merlin and his dragons fighting, well, there really is no point in delving too deep.

Putting aside the laminated plywood shields, iron-creased uniforms, welded armor, really bad CGI, really really bad acting (except for Jergen - always like to see him) one might enjoy this as a weekend watch with some of the young kids. Judging from the fake battles and omission of every kill or person getting burned by a dragon, I would venture to say this was geared towards the younger crowd by keeping the rating low.

The CGI renders somewhat nicely when the dragons are alone in the sky, but once people are in the same shot, I had customers laughing instead of wanting to rent it. Needless to say I won't play it again, but I might recommend it for those young dragon fans out there (roughly about 8 minutes of total screen time for all the critters).",1227139200,5,1069,4.711229946524064

8304173,5,B001G79HAK,I've seen many movies about dragons and well am wondering if this is what I am looking for. I once saw a movie with dragons and some wizard/bad guy can use powers to turn people into dragons. I am wondering if this is the movie or is it something else?,1421712000,,252,4.06

8304175,3,B001G79HAK,"For an adult, this is a bad movie. Simon Lloyd-Roberts as the 20 tear old Merlin was absolutely horrible. This is an Asylum low budget film, but even so it could have been far better. Some of the characters spoke in modern English while others adopted a 17th century hybrid. Britain is under attack by Pics (which we don't see enough) Saxons and dragons. Merlin as an apprentice has to save them.

For a ten year old child this movie may be enjoyable. There is no swearing, sex, nudity, or even sex talk. The dragon effects were acceptable for the low budget aspect of Asylum. The sound track could have been better. The opening narration could have been far better. The lead role and acting in general was laughable. The speech given on the horse to rouse the troops was a hoot. While the man is talking the horse seems to have a mind of its own while walking around and making sudden jerks and turns. The magic was just great. A spell is cast, the camera pans away, and then comes back and suddenly something appears!

This is a bad ow budget film, but for some strange unexplained MST reason it held my interest.",1328486400,3,1115,4.434146341463415
8304176,1,B001G79HAK,"This film was terrible, the plot could have been OK, but the acting was awful. Slowest flying Dragons in History. Overall just a waste of time to make and to watch. Don't bother watching and definitely don't waste your money buying this.",1296432000,,237,4.666666666666667
8304177,4,B001G79HAK,I was worried this would be a real stinker but it actually was very entertaining. It is a dragon movie....don't expect any award winning dramatic performances....but very entertaining and watchable.,1294444800,2,198,5.633333333333334
8304178,3,B001G79HAK,"The main thing that stands out to me about this film is the horrible acting of all of the non-headlining actors, and the excellent music for the end credits (which, excellent as it was, seemed a bit out of place after the movie).

Don't get me wrong, Simon Llyod Roberts, as Merlin, did a great job, and I was completely on board with the portayals of Uther and the Mage.  The other major roles seemed a bit dreary and confused, but the small roles and extras seemed like they didn't even know that they were filming rather than rehearsing.  It all seemed a bit weird to me.

As for the story- it was pretty interesting.  Merlin is born, and we see an argument over whether he should be slain or not, then we jump to Merlin's wizard training as a young man.  There were several things about this film that are obviously inspired by the Star Wars saga.  For example, the wizards shoot lightning out of their fingers, there is a line toward the end, and I do not remember it word-for-word, but it's something to the effect of ""join me and together we will rule the world,"" which follows a very Darth-Vader-is-your-father-esque revelation...well, I don't want to give anything away, but you can definately tell that the film was produced with Star Wars in mind, which is fine, but parts of it almost seem like Mad Libs.",1291075200,,1316,4.504201680672269
8304179,5,B001G79HAK,I saw this at the video store and said why not. this movie turned out to be one of the most awesome low budget movies i've seen even the dragons were well made. this is a good movie.,1287360000,,182,3.8157894736842106
8304180,4,B001G79HAK,"""Merlin and the War of the Dragons"" is a wonderful film.  I can add little to what the others have said.  I do know that the movie felt realistic in its portrayal of a low-fantasy, magic-poor, Dark Age England.  A complex yet engaging script, no cursing, no nudity, great acting --- is this really an Asylum movie?

I am sure that the movie contains anachronisms, but they don't distract.  Fantasy armor, peasant clothing, funny English accents all work well with the film.  The CGI dragons are not intrusive.  Some of the spell effects are weak-looking, but this is a low-magic time.  The swordfights are also a little stilted and fake-looking.  Overall, the movie is at least a four-star movie.

Sadly, the movie has neither commentary nor DVD extras.",1285113600,,753,4.8125
