8262811,5,B0016KCBYQ,"We first saw Monty Alexander in a very small venue in Big Fork, Montana, of all places.  He was ""filling in"" for John Pizzarelli's usual pianist.
Mr. Alexander gave us a show to remember and Mr. Pizzarelli knew he hit the jackpot - he gave Monty the spotlight throughout this fabulous show!
I've never been a groupie, but I am now!",1418774400,,331,4.426229508196721
8262812,5,B0016KCBYQ,"This is a truly wonderful set. Monty Alexander is one of today's best jazz pianists even managing to strum the piano strings to very good effect on this nice mixture of originals and standards. The sidemen, particularly drummer Bobby Thomas, Jr. we're likewise superb. Monty's heartfelt verbal tribute to the late great bassist Ray Brown was moving. How people can listen to Rap and Hip Hop while ignoring this fantastic music will always be a mystery to me. Do yourself a favor and pick up this disk.",1404777600,2,501,4.7701149425287355

 i am so proud of monty as his timing is so good
 this trio was remarkable- remember the drummer from weather report",1359849600,,168,4.566666666666666
8262814,5,B0016KCBYQ,"I was hesitant to order this DVD as I have a cassette, I think from the 60s, of the pianist with Eugene Wright and Bobby Durham.
I also have the CD titled ""Straight Ahead"" with Ray Brown and Herb Ellis. These are 2 incredible samples of what Monty Alexander can do, backed by some amazing musicians. On ""You Tube"" I found an example of the trio featured on this video. After listening to that,I immediately ordered this DVD. It is put together by the German company ""inakustik"" which is also responsible for the incredible Oscar Peterson ""Live in Berlin"" concert.
Apart from the wonderful selection on this 135 minute program, the enthusiasm and obvious respect that these 3 men show each other make for a most enjoyable viewing and listening experience. Bobby Thomas Jr. on drums and Hassan W. Shakour on bass are worthy followers to the mastery shown by Bobby Durham, Eugene Wright and Ray Brown.
