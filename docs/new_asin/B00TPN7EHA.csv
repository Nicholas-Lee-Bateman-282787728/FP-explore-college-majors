8702557,4,B00TPN7EHA,"Fortunately, I've seen all episodes on TV before.  The episodes on the DVD are heavily edited.  Many many scenes are missing.  If you haven't seen the full episodes before, you will be confused about what is going on.  There are no subtitles on the DVDs.  Fortunately, I'm fluent in Spanish and don't need them.  :)",1478736000,2,315,4.636363636363637

8702563,3,B00TPN7EHA,"Spoiler below:
The novel is good but I think it is out of order. For example, In the end of episode 5, it shows that the priest goes to speak to Deigo ( the male main character) at his work. It finished off like this so when u watch episode 6 u think ur going to see what the priest says to Deigo but u don't it was edited completely or cut off. Episode 6 starts off with Diego's wife speaks to the female main character (forgot) her name. The female main character decides NOT to work for Deigo in the past episodes but then suddenly she is working for Deigo I have no idea how or why she decided to work for him no explanation. Another thing, the mother of the main character Carmen, is in prison and u don't know why she went to prison only that she is there no explanation again.

More of my opinion coming up hopefully in the next episodes I don't see any cut out parts.

-----
I am now on episode 10:
The mother Carmen is now in prison for being accused of drug trafficking. I don't know if the editor misplaced parts of episodes 5 and 6 with episode 10, because know I know why Carmen went to prison or is this another time she goes to prison????? Who knows.",1438992000,5,1165,4.08296943231441
