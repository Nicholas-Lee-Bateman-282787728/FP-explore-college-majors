And, since a another reviewer has done a fine job of describing characters and events, suffice to say that thanks to all involved in this production, the movie is so engrossing and entertaining it seemed to be over before I knew it.  It's a gem.",1333843200,115,399,4.940298507462686
4326524,4,B004CFH9F8,"Being a fan of Downton Abbey, I was attracted to this movie when I saw the names of 2 cast members, Maggie Smith and Hugh Bonneville.  I was also intrigued that the writer of this film is the same person who created Downton Abbey.

This film is set in an old manor in Great Britain near the end of World War II.  A teenage boy, Tolly, comes to stay with his grandmother, who lives in the manor.  At the beginning, Tolly questions his grandmother about portraits of family members long past.  From that point on, he has quite an adventure.

If you want to know more, you'll have to wait for other reviews or just watch the movie.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.",1332806400,128,654,4.311475409836065
4326525,4,B004CFH9F8,"Based on a well-known children's book series by Lucy M. Boston, From Time to Time is a sentimental and touching story about ghostly encounters in the aftermath of wartime.

Although WWII is drawing to an end, there are still a number of British soldiers unaccounted for -- among them is the father of young Tolly (Alex Etel), who has been sent to live with his grandmother (Maggie Smith) while his own mother attempts to use her political connections to discern his father's whereabouts. Moving into the old manor house, Tolly becomes fascinated with its romantic and frequently tragic history. The paintings in the main hall tell a story of past generations and over a hundred year old mystery. But that is not all the secrets the old house contains, for after a ghostly encounter, Tolly becomes convinced the place is haunted. But it seems to contain more magic than that, for sometimes he encounters specters... and sometimes he is the ghost in their world. Weaving in and out of time, he becomes involved in the lives of the great old family that once lived there...

With a mean-spirited son and a blind daughter to look after, not to mention his bored, aristocratic wife (Carice van Houten) feeling neglected, it is all Captain Oldknow (Hugh Bonneville) can do to look after his affairs when he is on shore leave. On his most recent trip home he has brought a surprise for his daughter Susan (Eliza Bennett) -- a young Negro boy escaped from slavers, who will become her ""eyes"" and her companion. His son Sefton (Douglas Booth) takes an immediate disliking for Jacob (Kwayedza Kureya) but he becomes invaluable to Susan. However, the malicious butler Caxton (Dominc West) is considering how best to be rid of him. Then comes the theft, and the fire, and no one knows the answers, but maybe Tolly, slipping in and out of his own time, can discern the truth before it is too late.

Julian Fellowes is best known for Downton Abbey, but his adaptation of the novel is a charming one, and he proves a capable director. Emotion and suspense are present, but he does not distract his audience with peculiar camera angles, merely points them at the actors and allow their performances to shine through. It's quite a good cast -- Timothy Spall and Harriet Walter make notable appearances, but mostly I was impressed with the main characters. Maggie Smith and Hugh Bonneville are always good, but here we get to see a different side of her, playing a grandmother without a saucy side. Fans of the book may be frustrated with some of the changes made to the story, but as an independent production it's quite engaging, even if it is a little bit of a tearjerker toward the end.

Although at times it moves a little slowly and the ending is a tad predictable, I enjoyed this film. It seems more lighthearted in many ways than your customary WWII drama and introduces some wonderful concepts, as well as exploring slightly more mature themes such as forgiveness, acceptance, racism, and coming together in a hard time, with little gusts of humor throughout. To my knowledge, it is not yet available in the United States but I am sure that with such a remarkable cast, it is only a matter of time.",1332374400,316,3189,4.699463327370304
4326526,5,B004CFH9F8,"This is a well-made production based on a story The Chimneys of Green Knowe, The story is set in 1940s England, where thirteen-year-old Tolly (Alex Etel) is sent by his mother to his grandmother Mrs. Oldknoe's (Dame Maggie Smith) family estate, Green Knowe. His mother remains in London, trying to get information on the fate of Tolly's father who is missing in action.

Initially, Tolly resents his granny because he thinks she dislikes his mother, but gradually a close bond forms between the two. Tolly discovers that the estate is in financial trouble and that his granny may be forced to sell it. Tolly also makes another startling discovery - that the estate is haunted by the spirits of a previous generation of Oldknow's, mainly young Susan (Eliza Bennett) who lived in the house more than a century earlier. Susan's father, Captain Oldknow (Hugh Bonneville) is a kind seafaring man who brings home an escaped slave named Jacob and provides for him, expecting only that Jacob be Susan's companion, for Susan is blind. But Maria, the Captain's Dutch wife (played by Carice Van Houten of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Black-Book/dp/B000TGCR38/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Black Book</a>) is not keen on the boy and spends her days squandering the Captain's wealth. The couple's only son, Sefton (Douglas Booth) is a spoilt brat who abhors Jacob, and finds ways and means to make Jacob's life miserable.

Tolly finds himself not only able to see some of these ghosts but also to be able to travel back in time (it is never explained how this happens) and witness events in the past. This later proves fortuitous as Tolly makes an important discovery that could very well save his granny's estate.

The story plays out quite well and is beautifully filmed. I'd characterize this as a family friendly drama - there is no foul language, no sexual scenes, and except for a few scenes where there is some bullying going on, no real violence.",1314230400,69,1984,5.136222910216718

4326556,5,B004CFH9F8,"From Time to Time is indeed, a story of time travel - but in multiple senses and dimensions.  Centered around the perceptions and actions of a bright 13-year old (Tolly, played by Alex Etel), his grandmother (Linnet Oldknow played by Maggie Smith) and the ghosts of their distant ancestors, it is both a fairy tale and a coming of age story.  And it is thoroughly excellent in all of its dimensions.  In the dialogs between Tolly and his grandmother, we encounter truths as old as family and and the horrors of war for those left behind to wait -- woven through both a mystery and an adventure that entertains from the viewer's first moments.

Perhaps not accidentally, several of the characters in this tale are played by actors whom we know from Downton Abby.  Maggie Smith is just as formidable as Grandmama Oldknow as she was as the Dowager Dutchess, and Hugh Bonneville is again a military man of integrity caught in an age of moral conflicts and ambiguities.

The movie is well worth seeing.",1491609600,,997,4.668571428571428

4326573,4,B004CFH9F8,"The Green Knowe Series, by Lucy M. Boston was not only my absolute childhood favorite but influenced me greatly as a writer.  From Time to Time is based on  The Chimneys of Green Knowe, which tells the double story of Tolly Oldknowe's visit to his grandmother in her mysterious and ancient British manor house, and of the friendship Susan, a young 19th century girl who's been blind from birth, and of Jacob, an escaped slave boy who her sea-captain father befriends and brings home with him after one of his voyages.  There are lots of things to like about this adaption.  It stays fairly close to the source material while managing to stay away from the sinister Gypsy trope that appears in one section (the books were written in the 50's and, well, it was the fifties) and also from most of the nasty treatment Jacob receives in the book, especially from the evil butler and Susan's entitled brat of a brother, which, if it had been played out on screen would have made this a whole other type of film--though both characters are still definitely the bad guys.  The sets, costumes and house itself are lovely--understandably, as the director/producer was also associated with both Gosford Park and Downton Abbey.  Though the ending differed from the ending of the book, it was both touching and the ending this film asked for.  Although the young actor cast as Tolly was older than the book's Tolly--around 12 or 13, I'd guess, rather than 8, I think he needed to be older for this ending to work.  The cast, nearly all familiar faces, were excellent, and in general it was an high-quality and enjoyable family film.  The only reason, I suppose that I gave four stars instead of five is that these books were so magical, and so special to me, and though the film, in general, handled the supernatural and time-jump elements well, it didn't quite open up into that sense of ""ooooooh, wonder and creepiness I got when I first read the books, or even revisited them as an adult.",1484179200,10,1978,4.644699140401146

That said, the plot is okay and the acting is good. The writing (by Downton Abbey's producer) isn't a patch on the TV series. But Maggie Smith is in top form here, as she was in Downton Abbey.

4326607,5,B004CFH9F8,"Confession: I love Downton Abbey. I adore Julian Fellowes's writing. I enjoy ghost stories. Given those facts, I was destined to love this film. During WWII, young Tolly is sent to live with his grandmother in the family's country home. His father is missing. Tolly refuses to acknowledge the possibility of his father's death. Tolly and his grandmother are estranged at the beginning, but as he delves into the family's history, he and his grandmother grow closer. Tolly moves between modern day wartime and the Napoleonic times of his ancestors. Many of the Downton Abbey actors populate this film as well as the fabulous Pauline Collins. The writing is wonderful as is the story. Highly recommended.",1468886400,,702,5.060344827586207

Maggie Smith gives a  stellar operformance as always with a stiff upper lip yet tender portrayal which was reminiscent to me of her performance in The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie.  The movement through and interaction with the ghosts of time was superbly handled and gave credibility to the adventure while the emotional scope of the story was never allowed to fall into the trappings og maudlin or sappy.

The periods of history covered are really wonderfully separated, especially with the brilliant colors used for the older time and the more dreary colors for the 1944 period. Maggie Smith is, as always, outstanding and the young man playing the leading role superb. All the youth are really solid in their performances.

4326796,5,B004CFH9F8,"I agree with those reviewers who say this is a fun children's-tweenie age movie.
Adults may find some of the time travel elements not as well developed or logically consistent as they could have been. But this is still a sweet, fun, enjoyable tale.

A young English boy is sent to visit his grandmother (the always watchable Maggie Smith) in the ancestral manor house that's been home to generations of his family for centuries. Surrounded by ancestral antiques and longtime family retainers, the boy begins seeing flashes of past centuries in which he can interact with and be seen by some-- but not all-- of the past inhabitants of the manor house...including his own ancestors.

A bond forms between the boy and his grandmother, who also has had psychic time travel experiences.
So far so good, and the idea of time travel being possible only within a specific house and within a specific DNA bloodline is intriguing to explore.

Unfortunately, here's where the screenwriters 'blink' and the film defaults to a children's story. The deeper, richer questions about time travel and ancestral genetic memory are hinted at but then dropped entirely.
The film devolves into just another Turner Cable Saturday morning children's story with British accents. There's a Nice Blind Girl the little boy's age, and a Good Father Figure, and a Mean Uncle Figure, and some Upstairs-Downstairs Social-Justice messaging, and a Mystery, and a wholly implausible Brave Resourceful African Servant who the Mean Man is mean to and who suddenly becomes the focus of the plot.
As I say, a Turner Cable children's story.

It's not bad and it certainly has some nice moments. But there are too many unresolved (unacknowledged) classic stereotypical time-travel-contradictions for this to be intellectually challenging to the average adult.
Our 20 C. boy repeatedly alters the past, prevents his own ancestors from dying as they were supposed to,  centuries before he is born, even brings 20th C. technology back to the 18 C., gives it away and leaves the electronic device there to be marveled over.
Too bad, because the cast is stellar and the manor house countryside is lovingly photographed by someone who truly loves rural England.
But they decided to go with a children's-level concept of time travel instead of say, Chris Reeves in Somewhere In Time, and the final result is what it is.
By the by, a suspiciously identical plot concept appeared in an episode of the 1960's The Avengers TV series, with time travel being possible, but only within the confines and the historic family occupants of a specific ancient London house. Now that I recall, it's a VERY similar concept of time travel. Almost identical. Hmm.

This is a fun time travel film for a kid/tweenie age group, and so I still give it 5 stars for that. If you're watching it as an adult it's still fun, and Maggie Smith is always a treat, but just bear in mind that your suspension of belief will be tested, plus the whole Turner-social-justice-messaging thing really intrudes on the story line.

That said, have fun and enjoy. Hope this is helpful. Happy viewing, everybody.",1410048000,,3124,4.950381679389313

I have seen many ghost stories through the years and this turns out to be one of our favorites. I am especially glad that this is not one of your ghost stories that does not have any gore, or mutilations.

This movie does not disappoint.  Have seen this twice so far, as it takes several times to understand how the dimensions occur.  All actors played their roles well and, of course, Maggie Smith's performance was excellent.  I do have one comment relative to the sound.  This was filmed in an old English manor house and sometimes the voices seemed to fade or be smothered in clarity.

4326826,5,B004CFH9F8,"THIS REVIEW WILL MAKE A LOT MORE SENSE IF YOUVE JUST SEEN THE MOVIE (a Warburgian view)!!!

  Just saw the movie in streaming video, and now Im buying copies for myself and loved ones.  As I suggest in the title to this review, it was the way the movie unfolded like a gentle sarabande, introducing layers and dimensions of life and experience with a most mature casualness.  I could see how some might not like it, for the Granny character was played in such a fashion as to render a very classical feel to the whole process.  Her role was pivotal, and they could hardly have chosen a better person to play it.  The role of the boy did not really come alive until he started to interact with her.

  We got a promise that this movie would be something elsea story that would keep to its meter throughoutby the conversation at the start of the film between the boy and the grounds keeper who came to pick him up at the train station.  You just knew that he was a child with crushed hope, his insistence that his father was still alive notwithstanding.  The man was not cautious or unfeeling in his reactions, just emotionally generous in the way he kept making room for the boy and his feelings (as was the housekeeper).  When the boy reacted to the issue of his father with claims that the loved parent was only MISSING in action, that was the one spot where the rhythm of the tale was dramatically brokenwhich told you right there and then that Death was waiting to make its announcement somewhere down the line, if not just around the corner.

  The plot evolves along a cautionary path, reminding us to attend studiously to what is around us HERE-AND-NOW, not to deny or over-react to the realities in which we live like fish deep in the ocean.  Fish have to swallow that sea water as-is and extract whatever life-giving oxygen there might be in it, letting the polluting bad stuff hopefully pass out through and out of their gills and rear ends.  So it is that we must take in the depth of our ongoing experience in which we inexorably existnot fight it with denials, but absorb it so that it might feed as best as it can what is most good within us.  We can only be ourselves, and we can only live the life weve got, the movie seems to be pointing out (lightly at first, initially only here and there).

  At he start the boy demonstrates such acceptance of experience, even when his experience presents itself to him as a ghostly presence; an attitude that eventually (at the end) allows him even to take in the fact of his fathers passing.  It seems everyone knew how that matter would end up from the start . . . except him!  His insistence on blocking that reality (which was all along very much a part of his experience) made him harshly mean and cross: in those exceptional moments when he would not relate to what his experience was telling him, the boy found himself in those moment of non-acceptance acting much in the way the Captains despicable son tended to behave nearly ALL the time, and (unlike the boy) around ALL things.  In other words around his fathers death the boy did what the viciously spoiled Captains son did around just about everything in his life: he got nastily self-protective at the expense of others.

  I once heard someone say that if you try to hold back the hands of time in order to make it stand still, youll only get your arms broken.  So it is with the corruption of life that comes with ego-defensively holding back painful realities: it can eventually break ones soulwhich is what Freud tried to teach us.  The boy did that and behaved in that way around the question of his fathers death because he had learned how to do that from Grannys initially unrelenting reaction to the fathers marriage.  Both Granny and the boy would eventually come to embrace their reality at the movies end when they all embraced the Christmas gift of shared grief.  In other words, we don't have to go through the rough spots alone; there are always others who can help us carry the heaviest loads (if only we would let them)as the Captain knew when he brought home his blind daughters emotionally very generous companion, and as the Captains wife would find out when she would embrace the reality that Black child represented (and which she had fought so hard against accepting prior to the fire, the fight making her as nasty as the Captains son).

  As you can see, I saw this film allegorically.  Its the sort of thing up to two hundred years ago people would write mythopoetic odes about, to be told/recited by the cleansing and community uniting fire (fire being a major theme in this movie, both in terms of the fireplace and chimney, as well as in the burning down of the house).  The movie uses fire to remind us that Death always comes unpredictably (as we are shown by the passing of both the blind daughter and her companion very soon after the matter of the jewels is resolved); hence the fullness of life should not be put off and wasted on meanness and denial.  In all bad there is much good to be found, but only if we embrace it as is, and not try to hold it back from realization as if that could keep it from being so.

  Thats a heavy lesson taught in very light steps taken to a very soothing musical score.  I once saw a PBS program on how musicals had become a medium through which Jews well acquainted with persecution could express some astoundingly high ideals.  It was a real eye-opener for me because, on the basis of only the most precursory examination, I had dismissed that entire segment of the Broadway theater as mere dribble.  Dont make the same mistake with this movie that I made with Broadway musicals.  Watch it again, and this time let this genteel dance in triple time touch your heart.  The people who put this thing together seemed to have understood that really big messages can only be delivered with ease, grace, circumspection, and above all else infinite aplomb.",1401580800,,5939,4.493010251630941

4326833,3,B004CFH9F8,"I'm a period film junkie, so just seeing Maggie Smith & Hugh Bonneville on the cover landed this DVD in my Amazon cart.  I'd never heard of it, and now I know why.  This was not a disappointing film, just peculiar.  Since we're between seasons of Downton Abbey, I needed a fix, and seeing that Julian Fellowes wrote and directed ""From Time to Time"" had me hoping for a little more drama.  The best part of the film was watching with my kids (this one is totally PG), and saying ""Hey - that's the horrid sister-in-law from 'Sense & Sensibility', and that's the queen's minion from 'Enchanted'!""  We had fun trying to remember where we'd seen the actors before. Harry from 'Cranford', and even the doctor and Branson from 'Downton'!  We enjoyed the period costumes for both time periods (1944 and 1790-ish), and the spectacular estate where the movie is filmed.  We did not enjoy superficial performances by ""Craxton"" and ""Sefton"", two twits who needed a good smack!  All in all, this is a predictable time-travelling mystery with a bittersweet ending.  A great Sunday afternoon flick to rent.",1398643200,5,1091,4.76063829787234

4326836,4,B004CFH9F8,Nice movie with a great cast--co-written by Julian Fellowes.  Wonderful to see a younger Allen Leech (Downton Abbey) and Hugh Bonneville was outstanding.  But of course Maggie Smith is the best in any role she takes.  It was a fun story about ghosts and the former family members who lived in the same old house.  Not really scarey if you are looking for that.  But a great period piece with some lovely costumes.  Would be fine for a family with no small children.,1395705600,,465,4.542168674698795

4326842,5,B004CFH9F8,"If you really enjoyed the ""Downton Abbey"" mini-series, you will absolutely enjoy this movie.  Maggy Smith, as usual, does a tour de force.  Hugh Bonneville from the aforementioned series is also in it along with Carice van Houten (of ""Black Death"" & ""Black Book"") and Domenic West (of ""Centurion"" and ""The Awakening"").  The other actors, all British and yet unknown in America, render no less impressive performances.  The flashbacks between 1811 and 1944 are necessary in telling the story based upon a children's book entitled ""The Chimneys of Green Knowe.""  Period decor, costumes, and atmosphere are authentic and impressive.  The plot is exceptional with no clue of the movie's ending.

It's also one your older kids can enjoy without mom having to worry about  what they are exposed to.  Maggie Smith is her usual delightful, believable self, and the young hero is believable and engaging.  It's a picture that could generate conversation with adults about its underlying  themes of love and loss as the young man must come to terms with the loss of his missing father during World War II.  I wish films like this were more easily available to the general public - they are such a relief from the overexpended ""blockbusters"".

4326895,4,B004CFH9F8,"Julian Fellowes adapted the screenplay from Lucy M. Boston's novel `The Chimneys of Green Knowe' and as expected, especially when he directs his own films the story though slight is filled with elegance, grace and rich atmosphere. With a splendid cast it truly comes to life.

Set in 1940s England, 13-year-old Tolly (Alex Etel) is sent to stay with his grandmother (Maggie Smith) at her country home, which she fears she will have to sell due to money problems. Tolly's father is fighting in WWII, and is missing in action. As his grandmother tells him about the history of the house, and Tolly's ancestors, he finds that he is able to travel back in time to 1805 and discover secrets about his family's past, which still resonate today. The idea of time lapse is present in the story from 1805 - which centers around Tolly's ancestors, the kindly Captain Oldknow (Hugh Bonneville) and his selfish wife Maria (Carice van Houten) and their children Sefton, a spoiled, selfish young man (Douglas Booth) and a kindly, blind girl Susan (Eliza Bennett). Into their lives comes Jacob (Kwayedza Kureya), a former slave who escapes from captivity with the help of Captain Oldknow and joins the household as a companion for Susan, much to the chagrin of Sefton. The primary storyline is set in the 1940s, with Tolly and his grandmother worrying about what has become of Tolly's father, while at the same time getting to know and understand each other. The cast is augmented with character roles played by Timothy Spall, Dominic West, Douglas Booth, Rachel Bell and Pauline Collins.

This is a spirited adventure ghost story played two centuries apart and for those who enjoy the artistry of Julian Fellowes, this is a fine evening's diversion. Grady Harp, July 13",1374192000,,1755,4.885906040268456

Basically, a British boy stays with his paternal Grandmother during World War 2 while his mother tries to find his father who is serving in the war. The Oldknown family's ancestral home where he stays is a large manor on grounds that once had an abundance of servants, but now has only one cook and a groundskeeper.

It could've been made that way... instead the director had the main character revert back to the past not by traveling through time, but through ghosts there in the house. I learned a long time ago that there was one eventuality as regards humans.... Ecclesiastes 3:19 puts it: ""as the one dies, so dies the other (animals and man); they all have but one spirit... all go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again.""

For instance, Tolley is older and the relationships are more complicated.  I also felt that showing Green Knowe mostly in winter didn't allow the setting to shine.  (The house seems a little depressing, but I think the movie is going for the spooky factor.)  If you know about these differences when you sit down to watch it, you can instead simply enjoy the movie for what it is.

The film is set during WWII and his father is missing in action, so his grandmother tells him stories about the family to keep him distracted. One night, he sees a ghost (in a very startling scene) and when he approaches his grandmother about it she doesn't deny that there are ghosts at the estate. As time goes on, he sees more and more apparitions and actually participates in the past. In doing so he solves a very old family mystery.

I spotted four actors from Downton Abbey, which makes sense because the director of this film created Downton. The actors, including the many child actors, seemed comfortable in the early 1800s setting which was brought to life with beautiful bright camerawork which contrasts the dreary WWII atmosphere.

I find that most PG movies these days are aimed solely at kids with a few adult oriented jokes tossed in to appease the parents, but this movie wasn't condescending in the least. It is appropriate and exciting for all ages. I know I would have loved this movie as a kid (It reminded me of the Secret Garden) and I love it now.",1365292800,4,1186,4.61611374407583

While visiting, he becomes aware of a mystery in the family mansion, which has been owned by his family for centuries.  The

Well, a little more story sophistication, character development and Maggie sarcasm would have helped.
Other reviewers noted that this movie was based on a children's story series, and it's a little too evident in this translation to film.
As a family movie, it would probably be entertaining for the kiddos.

4326972,5,B004CFH9F8,"It pays to look through for similar movies in Amazon.  I ran across this doing a similar search.  An excellent story with a great cast.  A young man goes to visit his grandmother (Maggie Smith) that lives on an estate in the country.  It is near the end of World War II and his mother must find work in London and his father is Missing in Action (MIA).  During his stay he sees a young girl ghost and then finds he can travel between her time and his own.  As he learns about her life he tries to deal with the possibility his father may not return.  Fans of Downton Abbey may like this British drama.  If you enjoy any good drama or ghost stories you will probably find this one well worth your time.  After renting it I immediately purchased it.

I was attracted to this movie because of the cast. They didn't disappoint. They were all well chosen and did a good job. The story takes place on this odd estate with a lot of history. The house and grounds were lovely and did a good job of creating the WWII era in Britain as well as a more distant past. There are two stories here: family ties and a mystery. Both support each other and wrap up in a way that feels satisfying. If you are looking for a movie to watch with the kids, or if you are a bit of a kid yourself, you will like it.

I came across this title by accident surfing a movie channels selections and was intrigued by the synopsis.  What emerged was a beautiful film of coping with loss and the way every bit of life that people touch within their stay on this plain effects time through the ages up to the present.  Writer/Director Julian Fellowes 'FROM TIME TO TIME'-2008 approaches its subject from the point of view of its main character brilliantly played by Alex Etel and we the audience are introduced and experience each clue as the story progresses.  You've read about the story and characters in the reviews within so its great to discuss the production by Luciana Arrighi and the cinematography by Alan Almond which bounces you back and forth from 1809 to 1940 with the greatest of ease.  The performances are outstanding by all including a villainous take by Dominic West , absolutely shattering characters portrayed by Dame Maggie Smith and Pauline Collins plus a surprise appearance by Timothy Spall.  The transfer is in a 1.85 ratio with subtitles if needed and includes a feature called Cast and Crew Interviews with main actors (not Dame Maggie Smith, unfortunately) and behind the scenes filmmaking.  A trailer for the film rounds out the special features.  It contains so much heart and soul that it must be experienced rather than talked about and it has become one of my favorite films of all time.  Click the add to cart button and enjoy a story which includes time travel, ghosts, and incredible sentimentality taking place at the end of World War II in Britain all during the Christmas holiday.",1359158400,5,1680,4.846153846153846

It is a little below an adult level and a little more than what I would allow my children to watch.  If it has a little more detail and depth, I would have enjoyed it much more.

This story just kept me rivetted on it.  The young man who played Tolly Oldknow (Alex Etel)was an excellent choice for this role.  He also appeared as the young boy in Cranford, who was sent to school to learn to read. It is 1944 and 13 year old Tolly Oldknow is sent to spend Christmas with his grandmother, (Maggie Smith) while his mother searches for news of his father in wartime London. In the old house, he becomes a witness to events during the Napoleonic wars and finds himself slowly drawn into participting in the drama.

You can see them several years later and somehow still fresh...like Jane Austin, Pride & Prejudice, et.al, where so many different actresses and actors do over and over...my favorite ever is the new one with Keira Knightley and Matthew MacFadyen.  Everything about it is Magnificent, the scenery, the acting (not to forget the wonderful performance by Donald Southerland) the music, the costumes and of course it is a beautiful story.  Even for me who doesn't like ""girlie movies"" much.

From Time to Time is in the same but a totally new classic (1958 novel, The Chimneys of Green Knoew by Lucy M. Boston.) It can also be appreciated when one thinks of the Narnia/C.S. Lewis stories.

Maggie Smith, oh well, a true Dame of actresses and is once again.  I don't know that I will ever be able to think of Timothy Spall other than as Peter Pettigrew in Harry Potter...but oh well,  the dangers of doing a GREAT acting job, being type cast.  But an excellent performance.

I do the same with movies; Star Wars IV (of course), Cold Comfort Farm, anything by Jane Austen, anything Harry Potter and now this movie.  I love it!!! I watch it over and over and over.  Dame Maggie Smith, as always, makes the movie, but Timothy Spall is a joy as Tully. The other pleasant people are Mrs. Tweedy and Barkus (Alex Etel-Wormtail in Harry Potter).

The adults are aware of war, being of age to have experienced WWI.  When youthful Tully is sure someone will know of his dad, etc. they simply let him ramble on.  They don't tell him that war can be very cruel and nasty. Tully grows more mature as his relationship with his grandmother grows.  Tully, his mom and grandmother may be in for the loss of their dad, husband, and son, but in the process they find each other.  It would be a wonderful movie for a child to help understand death.

The fine British cast brings their usual expertise to bear on this story of a young boy who is sent to live with his grandmother for a time only to discover there was much to learn about his ancestral home and his family.

We found the movie to be well paced and free of any seriously slow spots and enjoyed our journey of discovery with young Tolly as he discovers his house and his family's history interactively moving back and forth in time. Make no mistake, this is a ghost story told in a delightfully charming manner. It provides a very enjoyable evening for the entire family and I recommend it highly.

I was looking for a Downton Abbey quality movie but it ended up looking like a bland formula redux Disney family searches for lost treasure on island type script. Lots of formula clichs ranging from WWII military dad is lost at war while family holds out hope even though the family is about to lose their heirloom home;; scene shifts to decades earlier and a blind daughter to pull on heart strings with a selfish mom; kind servants with one evil servant to provide the criminal mystery; back to the present a young relative comes to stay, discovers himself, solves the mystery and saves the house.

The strange part is that all those people inhabit two quite different time periods thus to connect the stories we have the young relative traveling back in time to interact with the now dead previous inhabitants of the house. By the way time travel to a past that doesn't exist is just made-up fantasy.
People die or just disappear from the script with little or no explanation. A gold stirrup is found but never mentioned again. Gold and jewels are somehow easily found after decades by the young visiting relative. Ghosts can be seen by some but not by others. Ghosts sometimes go through things and at other times step over things. Characters were as shallow as 30 second sound bites which is about all they did for the entire movie.

This is a great little family film that you can watch with children of any age.  Set at the end of  WWI, it is basically the story of a family dealing with the feared loss of a loved one, but it isn't focused on that aspect.  It is also about the bonding between a grandmother and her estranged grandson through the family history.  There are ghosts and a mystery to keep the younger ones entertained; as well as the not so young ones.  In my opinion, it is a sweet movie that is excellent family entertainment.

It is not a great movie, but could have been. The greatest weaknesses? I didn't find either the portrayal of WWII England or 18th century England to be wholly realistic. From the start, there are clues that test one's temporal and historical placing disbelief. Suspense is mostly lacking where it could have played a decisive role in carrying the movie. Some characters are too matter of fact about the paranormal goings on. The script could have been adjusted greatly to make this more believable. Having voiced these criticisms, I don't think the director or producers intended this to be an edge of the seat movie. There is a strong element of MasterPiece theatre in this though the production standards are mostly higher than MP. I do recommend the movie if time travel interests you, and again state this is an excellent movie for a family with children to watch.

4327063,5,B004CFH9F8,"The Chimneys of Green Knowe, published in the U.S. as The Treasure of Green Knowe, is the most dramatic and tightly-written of Lucy M. Boston's spooky, atmospheric books for young people. Julian Fellowes, who created Gosford PArk and later Downton Abbey,  wrote and directed this respectful, affectionate adaptation. Like the screen-writer of the first Narnia movie, Fellowes added war-related tension to his framing story. In this case, the new material works well to define the characters and give their story some much-needed forward motion.

The acting is uniformly superb, from Maggie Smith and Timothy Spall to the trio of children who carry much of the story. The costumes are gorgeous, and the ancient home on which the Green Knowe books are centered is well-represented by an actual stately home.

This movie is not the funny, ribald preteen fare that American movie-makers usually provide, but it should appeal to families who enjoy more thoughtful child-centered stories such as Hugo and The Secret of Roan Inish.",1340928000,3,1024,5.2317073170731705

For the most part, the acting was very good.  It is hard to believe that such a stellar cast was wasted on such a mediocre production.",1340409600,6,279,4.431372549019608

4327067,5,B004CFH9F8,"I loved the storyline and the actors especially anything Maggie Smith is involved in.
Well done and entertaining. The scenes flowed and were easy to follow.
I have shared the movie with a few family members and they also enjoyed the supernatural aspect of the story. I would recommend this movie.",1340064000,,296,4.823529411764706
4327068,5,B004CFH9F8,"A wonderful tale of a boy who is sent to his grandmother's home during the war.  The things he discovers while exporting the old manor house, and ghosts whose lives and times he is able to view and interact with.  A fabulous movie, warm, moving and charming.  Older childern might enjoy this also.  Will be watching this one again and again.",1339027200,,341,4.540983606557377
4327069,5,B004CFH9F8,"Finally, this is available as a DVD-R and also instant download on Amazon. This is a well-made production based on a story The Chimneys of Green Knowe. The story is set in 1940s England, where thirteen-year-old Tolly (Alex Etel) is sent by his mother to his grandmother Mrs. Oldknoe's (Dame Maggie Smith) family estate, Green Knowe. His mother remains in London, trying to get information on the fate of Tolly's father who is missing in action.

Initially, Tolly resents his granny because he thinks she dislikes his mother, but gradually a close bond forms between the two. Tolly discovers that the estate is in financial trouble and that his granny may be forced to sell it. Tolly also makes another startling discovery - that the estate is haunted by the spirits of a previous generation of Oldknow's, mainly young Susan (Eliza Bennett) who lived in the house more than a century earlier. Susan's father, Captain Oldknow (Hugh Bonneville) is a kind seafaring man who brings home an escaped slave named Jacob and provides for him, expecting only that Jacob be Susan's companion, for Susan is blind. But Maria, the Captain's Dutch wife (played by Carice Van Houten of Black Book) is not keen on the boy and spends her days squandering the Captain's wealth. The couple's only son, Sefton (Douglas Booth) is a spoilt brat who abhors Jacob, and finds ways and means to make Jacob's life miserable.

Tolly finds himself not only able to see some of these ghosts but also to be able to travel back in time (it is never explained how this happens) and witness events in the past. This later proves fortuitous as Tolly makes an important discovery that could very well save his granny's estate.

The story plays out quite well and is beautifully filmed. I'd characterize this as a family friendly drama - there is no foul language, no sexual scenes, and except for a few scenes where there is some bullying going on, no real violence.",1338854400,8,1928,4.766467065868263
4327070,5,B004CFH9F8,"I have just finished watching this movie and have thoroughly enjoyed it! If you relish grown-up ""fairy tales"" and amiable ghost stories, this movie is for you. The acting is superb and the settings, as in most English period movies, beautiful. I truly recommend it!!!",1337990400,3,267,4.955555555555556
4327071,5,B004CFH9F8,"What a wonderful feel good movie. I really enjoyed it with my children. Going to read the books!

As another reviewer said........ A kid's downton abbey. Stars Hugh Bonneville and Dame Maggie Smith.",1336003200,3,198,5.0
4327072,5,B004CFH9F8,"The war is almost over and 13-year-old Tolly (Alex Ethel) returns to his returns to his family's ancestral home that he barely remembers. There where he awaits his father's return from the war, his grandmother reunites him with his family history. He finds he is capable of going through time to help solve and maybe create important family history mysteries.

We get to go along with the attorney and kibitz along the way. The story itself is fairly transparent and the solution is predictable; however the true value of the movie is the people interaction, the rich and intriguing environment, and possible lessons learned for all of us.

This presentation is based on a children's novel ""The Chimneys of Green Knowe"", by Lucy M. Boston.

Julian Fellowes - Director is the Executive Producer and writer of most of the series of Downton Abbey; also the Titanic (TV mini-series) among other series'.

I think I had more fun identifying the actors and where they were seen before. Many of them and even their characters turned up again in the Downton Abbey series. Many of the other actors appeared in decades of famous British movies.

In any event this presentation is a keeper and worth re-watching periodically.",1335657600,14,1214,4.902439024390244

8422963,1,B004CFH9F8,"A sappy, hokey, trite British piece of garbage.

We have an early-20th Century boy who can time travel to the 19th Century (or is he a ghost or are they ghosts? Who knows Who cares?)

It takes the occasion to twist minds by representing a young escaped African slave boy as the pinnacle of morality, goodness, bravery, and charm. Just totally superior to every single other person in this film. Especially white males. See?

He talks like an American-accented, modern street kid, where in reality he would have had a British accent, being a denizen of 18th Century Virginia, lately a British colony.

An impassioned speech by his captain-adopted, white dad about slavery, ignoring that it was the British themselves who bought, sold, and used slaves in America.

Kids, this is how they twist your brain and wash it and paint it with the colors they allow you to have inside. They make you see what they want you to see. Thats the film industry. Its what they do.

Anyway the film stinksexcept for the part where they manage to work in some soft porn as the young, nubile girl is silhouetted in her sheer negligee against candle light and they let you see she is really hot underneath her clothingboobs, hips, and All.

They seem to always work in their sickness and porn.

The premise(s) is/are stupid and annoying. Totally lackluster performances by allawful actingas if they are asking, What am I doing here? One of the physically ugliest cast ensembles ever glommed together. Especially the grandmother matron.

Indeed.

Millennials will Love this film and give it high ratings.

8422970,2,B004CFH9F8,"If you stuck with Downton Abbey till the end youll likely find this one interesting but its more of a kids movie with a cast that, in general, was pretty lifeless and annoying to watch. However, its not about time travel and thats a primary reason we started watching it though Tolly does flit back and forth in the same house centuries apart is more of a bad ghost movie. Its a feel good bonding movie and we just didn't find it interesting and Alex Etel wasn't the best choice for Tolly and Maggie Smith is the reason this has been on and off our Watchlist so many times over the past year. Perhaps it got better but it doesnt matter because it was boring. Lastly, it was a little hard to believe that they would actually have chosen who they did to be the companion to their daughter.",1524960000,,787,4.2885906040268456
