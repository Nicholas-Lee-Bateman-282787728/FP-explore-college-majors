8636009,4,B00HUTB47M,"This is the second volume of ""Chinook"" Monogram films released by Warner Archive, and the standard is as good as the first. excellent (restored?) prints, clear B/W picture with good sound, all 4.3 ratio. The 3 films are all much of a muchness - (not necessarily a bad thing!)-THE WOLF HUNTERS  was, for me, the weakest, co-starring Jan Clayton and Edward Norris. SNOW DOG much better but a warning for those with very young children who might be watching-there is (as expected) a pretty nasty fight between Chinook and the Wolf - just be warned - tho kids are much tougher now than when I was 10! The co-stars are Milburn Stone and Elena Verdugo. The third, and for5 me the best, is CALL OF THE KLONDYKE with the lovely Anne Gwynne giving a spirited performence, with Tom Neal and Russell Simpson. I have now seen both volumes of the ""Chinook"" films. They aren't5 my favourites - the location and sets are literally all the same, and I miss the horses! However I do recomend the DVD - High Quality, reasonable price, and I don't think you will ever find the films anywhere else.",1408492800,,1078,4.556701030927835
8636010,3,B00HUTB47M,"Although each film has the same set , these three films are some of the best of this series .",1404000000,,93,3.7
8636011,4,B00HUTB47M,This is the second entry of three films put out by Monogram.  As in the first volume the stories were well written and produced.  Again these were enjoyable stories to watch.  Warner Bros have brought back to us movies you would rarely or even never see.  So i hope they bring out volume three with the final four films featuring Cpl. Rod Webb and Chinook.  I would definitely recommend this one for your DVD collection.,1394755200,,420,4.546666666666667
8636012,4,B00HUTB47M,"This is one of the best of the many series that Monogram Pictures made.  These Kirby Grant-Chinook adventures are all new to me and I was surprised how good they are.  Any movie that features a handsome white dog like Chinook is always going to be an added bonus and what I found appealing is that though he is referred to as a ""wonder dog"" he is basically just a darn nice canine who like most dogs of this type is a very handy companion to have around when the baddies are on the loose.  Also Kirby Grant, a very likeable actor, is no superman thus making the series more believable than most of its ilk.  The three stories in this set are standard adventure yarns that don't outstay their 60-70 minute time limit, are all well acted (watch out for old stalwarts like Milburn Stone and Russell Simpson) and nicely photographed in beautiful black and white in the ""Canadian""  wilderness by William Sickner with effective music scores by Edward J. Kay.  Mind you the scenery all looks much the same in all three but that shouldn't spoil the fun.  Interesting to note that most of the characters have either Scottish or French names -remember this is supposed to be Canada!- and what lousy shots those villains are!  The transfer of these 60+ year old programmers is excellent and speaks volumes for how well made these films were, despite Monogram's lower than low budgets.  But you're really going to buy this for that handsome hunk Chinook who steals every scene he puts his paws in.",1394323200,,1485,4.573584905660377
