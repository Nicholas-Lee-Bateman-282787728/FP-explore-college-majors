7928769,5,B0000507PX,"Just to be clear, Volume 1 does not feature the spinning bed.  Many of the poor reviews for this video are actually for Volume 2.

I didn't know anything about massage before watching this video so I found it very informative.  It even explained terms from Swedish massage like effleurage and petrissage.  The models did a good job demonstrating lots of different strokes on their partners.  All the men are naked throughout the video, and are decent to good looking.  The camera shows everything these men have to offer, though usually without particular emphasis on the ""good parts"".  Be aware that genital massage is not covered, and none of the models ever gets ""excited"".",1267228800,,676,4.87719298245614
