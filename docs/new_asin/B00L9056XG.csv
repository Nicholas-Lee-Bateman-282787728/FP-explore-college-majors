8664529,5,B00L9056XG,I don't know exactly when this arrived nor how it arrived for that fact.  The mail is screened by a five year old that knows the feel of a DVD.  I know it arrived because I just spent some time watching The Ghost Next Door while he suggested that I buy several more.  I didn't respond and he asked where the power drill was.  This wouldn't bother me but he is the one who installed the child safety latches on the kitchen cabinets and he is the only one who can open them.  Why am I telling you this?  Because Goosebumps are just the right amount of scary to keep his attention and he is building quite a dossier on each one.  Right now he is downstairs tormenting his Mother by telling her he can't hear her because she is a ghost.  We had a scarecrow built in the backyard after The Scarecrow Walks at Midnight and the Cuckoo Clock still doesn't work after he decided to dismantle it because of the Cuckoo Clock of Doom.  Next up is the It Came From Beneath the Sink which will probably mean we will need a plumber afterwards.,1461283200,2,1028,4.204081632653061

chillogy- the 3 part was really good especially the first and last part
the ghost next door - was a 2 part which was pretty good but the dvd says it was 66 minutes when it fact it was only 44
it came from beneath the sink- was really good
