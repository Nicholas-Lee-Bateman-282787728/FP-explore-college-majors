8629342,5,B00H308M5A,"I stumbled across this mysterious DVD while looking for more Shark films... it is unlike all the others and for that reason alone deserves attention in my humble opinion.  This is the story of world record holding fly fisherman Conway Bowman, and his obsession. Mr Bowman lives on the beach in Southern California, as he points out , 700 miles from the nearest fly fishing destination!  He read in a book about fly fishing that  the most challenging of all ... is to catch Mako Shark with a fly .... and that is where his obsession and this 50 minute program begins.....

The footage is great, (wish it was on BR as it looks like it was filmed HD)... and the 50 minutes went by far too fast for me. I'd have liked a longer program and perhaps some additional bonus features for the hefty price, but It seems this was an independent production and I understand how that relates to huge outdoor networks and those like Discovery that have massive budgets and by the time a product is released for physical sales has likely been aired innumberable  times and profitable... so I do not deduct stars for the hefty price of this and limited time. The unique and honest content overcomes those in my opinion. I should also add that there is a STRONG educational content to this program, it isn't all underwater shots of sharks being ""hooked"" as it were. A serious discussion of catch and release , as Mr Bowman practices, as well as Catch and Kill is presented.

Interesting, unique, fast paced, well presented and always involving.... recommended to fans of fishing programs , and Shark content..",1406332800,,1590,4.640569395017794
