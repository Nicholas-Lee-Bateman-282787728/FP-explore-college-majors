8434383,5,B004LGVLK2,DYNASTY had its time and place. It was on top for a while. My thoughts always go back to the image of Blake Carrington. That is an indelible image. Final thoughts of a Dynasty.,1379030400,,176,4.205882352941177
8434384,1,B004LGVLK2,"I LOVE this show and particularly this season, so I won't add/duplicate commentary on it.  What I hate is the rip-off of having to pay double to get a complete season to satisfy greed by its distributer- I hope someone buys the rights to this soon and sells it a complete season at a time (like Dallas) at a reasonable price.",1363392000,,325,4.327868852459017
8434385,5,B004LGVLK2,"The acting is outstanding and each player is very convincing in their respective roles. Joan Collins plays the evil ex. Mrs. Carrington to the hilt. Each episode finds her scheming new mischief which very often backfires on her.
The producers spared no expensive on lavish sets, jewelry, costumes and all the trappings of the ""rich"" and ""famous"".",1362355200,,346,5.087719298245614
8434386,5,B004LGVLK2,"Dynasty was also my absolute favorite Tv-show as a young girl. I fell in love with all the actress/actresses, they were so beutiful and talented and it was a very exciting (intense) soap opera at times. I have bought season 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 and can't wait to order season 8, I will be watching the series again and I am so happy to have it all on DVD! :)",1348531200,,360,3.8783783783783785
8434387,5,B004LGVLK2,"If you are a Dynasty fan this DVD Vol 2 is for you. I was so interested that I ended up watching the whole set. All 20 hours of it.

8434388,5,B004LGVLK2,"Dynasty Season 6 is even better than 1-5.  The viewing is dynamic.  The actors
and storylines are exception. Really rivetting viewing. Cant wait for the next
season to come out.  Fantastic!",1344124800,,189,5.032258064516129
