6403610,1,B00K6J7R5G,BEWARE! This movie is NOT for children! We watched it based on theses Amazon reviews however it was violent and morbid and INCREDIBLY SAD! We (the parents ) were crying right along with our 4 & 6 year olds.  IT BROKE OUR HEARTS :(,1412208000,10,230,4.2272727272727275
6403611,4,B00K6J7R5G,"This movie's original title was ""Leafie: A Hen into the Wild"". Leafie looks nothing like any American animated film. It carries out its story in a way unlike American animation as well. American animated movies are almost always kids' movies, and there's an implication that the story and characters should be similarly childish.

Leafie, hailing from South Korea and based on a South Korean novel called ""The Hen Who Dreamed She Could Fly"", doesn't seem interested in stooping to the six-year-old demographic. There's a lot in the movie for kids to love, but it's also a bit scary, and the story isn't as neat and orderly as one expects from a kids' movie. Leafie is bittersweet, like real life, which makes it both interesting and hard to watch. Tears were in my eyes at one point, although I never started sobbing.

Leafie the hen was born on a farm but wants to escape. Over time she has a child of her own who has different abilities than her. It's frustrating for mother and son that they are different enough for the other animals to make fun of them. Parenthood and belonging are major themes; ""Leafie"" is a blend of Animal Farm, Finding Nemo, and a little bit of The Lion King.

It's all a bit predictable. Some parts throw you for a loop but it's usually not that hard to guess correctly about what's going to happen next.

There are some brief jokes involving toilet humor, which weren't done in a clever enough way to make me appreciate them. They're more explicit than the toned-down toilet jokes you find in Finding Nemo or The Lion King, which is probably why I found them so distasteful.

I appreciate seeing an animated movie that doesn't look like the homogenized ""Pixar / Dreamworks / Disney / Sony"" style. Vibrant colors abound, and it seems like the movie was animated mostly using two- dimensional techniques. It never made me as happy as ""Ernest & Celestine"" did, and I liked the way that movie looked even more than this one, but ""Ernest"" was never as sad as ""Leafie"" either.

Although the movie always looks *different*, it doesn't always make the best use of its style. Very few scenes blew me away with their visual style: Frozen, The Lion King, Ernest & Celestine, and Wall-E have ""Leafie"" beat when it comes to beautiful artwork.

I'm glad I watched this; there are too many sequels and too little heart in American animated movies. Characters don't have the nuance they do in Finding Nemo, and there's not enough humor to hold together the passable, but touching plot.

I suggest watching it in HD - it was released on Blu-Ray in South Korea (Region A) and Germany (B). But once you're done, look up the original ending. It's a mandatory part of the experience, and it's a shame that they cut it from the HD versions of the film. You'll understand why it was cut once you watch it, but it contains major spoilers, so wait until you watch the movie first. As the American DVD is not out yet, nobody knows whether the original ending is included. I doubt it will be included.",1409443200,5,3003,4.6
6403612,5,B00K6J7R5G,"Over the past year I've seen a couple of Korean animated movies, and of all of them Leafie or Daisy as this version is being called is the best movie I've seen so far. This is a kids movie and that has a different meaning across cultural lines which means this version is somewhat censored by comparison to the original, but I'm honestly not going to complain about the censorship. The original version, as well as the book had some rather gross and somewhat disturbing content which is expertly cut from this version.

I am going to complain a bit about the voice acting and the completely replaced soundtrack. The voice acting is hit and miss. The best voice is that of Mayor Otter, and the rest are kind of middling to unnoticeable. The nice thing is that none of the voices really hurt your ears which is a common problem with some dubs. The soundtrack is completely different from the original, it works but I still prefer the original soundtrack, especially the theme song.

Story wise I felt they changed a few things, but a lot of it is dialogue that takes liberties with the mouth movements. These scenes seem a bit more in depth due to this, but it doesn't change the overall plot of the story.

If you like this movie enough I'd suggest you get the original Korean version (the blu ray will play on American players and it has subtitles) and this version as they are different enough from each other.",1403222400,2,1411,4.50390625
6403613,5,B00K6J7R5G,"This is a sort of supplement to John Brumit's review. This movie, originally titled Leafie, a Hen into the Wild, is Korea's highest-grossing homegrown animated feature to date, and with good reason. The animation is lovely and so is the music, the voice acting is absolutely top-notch, and the story will stick with you for a long time after.

HOWEVER, I also have concerns regarding this English release. The voice acting is of low quality, the music has been altered, and some parts of the story have been edited. But, that's probably not what you're here for: since most people reading this will be doing so because they want to buy the movie for their kids, it's only fair to say that some parents might not want particularly young children watching this movie alone.

*SPOILERS AHEAD, read at your own discretion*

No dodging around it - the titular character dies in the end, sacrificing herself to be eaten by a starving mother weasel. Her body is seen being dragged off screen.
Earlier scenes include another character's corpse being dragged away, and some blood is shown.

As an fan of animation, I wholly recommend watching the Korean version with subtitles, and it's a pity that isn't included on this DVD, but if your kids were extremely upset by movies like Old Yeller, Where the Red Fern Grows, or other 'sucker punch' kid movies, you might want to pass on this one.",1403049600,2,1380,4.7375
6403614,5,B00K6J7R5G,"I was introduced to this movie under it's true name, ""Leafie: A Hen into the Wild,"" it was uploaded online, and sheer curiosity had me sit through it.  To this day, I'm still happy I did, I can tell you it's an absolutely beautiful movie, one that, even with the language barrier, draws you in and really grabs at your heart.  Mind you, I did watch it subtitled, and I personally believe that's how most should experience it.  I can't speak for this particular dub of the movie, but from the trailer I've seen, I do worry about the voices they've gone with.  The original film's voices are so powerful, they fit the characters perfectly.  Even though I was reading a translation, it really did feel like it was all matching up.

Also hearing that the film itself has possibly been edited concerns me.  This movie has a major punch that it's going to throw at you, and you have to take the full force of that strike to really appreciate everything the film has to give you.  Overall Leafie was a true gem of a film, I loved all the characters, absolutely loved the music (even bought the soundtrack from Korea!), and hopefully the dub doesn't lessen the impact this movie can have on you on an emotional level.

****

Recently I've been able to purchase the Blu-Ray of Leafie: A Hen into the Wild, it's a Region A disc form South Korea, but it will play on US machines!  Even better, it has english subtitles!  Sadly those subtitles are only on the movie, and not on the really interesting looking special features for the film, but the good outweighs the bad I say.  So again, I must reiterate that you try to see this movie unedited and perhaps even in the original language.  It's absolutely wonderful and well worth it.",1402444800,2,1722,4.477564102564102
6403615,5,B00K6J7R5G,"A beautiful, lush movie, it follows the story of a factory hen who escapes to the freedom of the forest and, through a series of mishaps, ends up raising a duckling to adulthood.  It sounds simple, doesn't it?  But the movie moved me to tears multiple times on its emotional rollercoaster ride.  The pacing seemed much more natural and less obviously ""we structured it like this to teach the kids lessons A, B, and C"" than most movies.  In a way it reminds me of Bambi, if Bambi inhabited a more dangerous world (with the constant threat of predators, not just Man) and was a bit more plot-driven.
It does have a very sad ending.  But it's also a beautiful ending and, in my opinion, the right ending.",1449360000,,701,4.4453125

6403620,1,B00K6J7R5G,"Would that I had read some of the other reviewers first.  Not only is this traumatizing for children, it's upsetting even for adults.  Though one understands the ""circle of life"" motif, this film took it one step too far.  It starts out as a lovely charming movie; it's even inspirational for children encouraging them to pursue their own dreams and learning about difference, growing pains, etc..  The ending, and yes, I'm spoiling it, completely ruins what could be a lovely family viewing experience.  [The ""duck"" son returns home from migration, flying high looking for his mother whom he won't see because she intentionally allows herself to be eaten by the weasel.].  Really? This isn't ""The Yearling""  or ""Old Yeller.""  This is a fantasy animated film for young children about a hen who has an otter as a real estate agent.  I don't think it's unreasonable to ask for a happy ending.",1435708800,9,890,4.841059602649007

8656309,1,B00K6J7R5G,"I mean if you thought Bambi was bad because his mom gets shot, this film has nothing on Disney. It starts in a chicken battery showing downtrodden zombie hens in cages producing egg after egg but one hen Daisy wants to be free. So she fakes her death. Where she's then tossed into a holocaust style death pit with other dead chickens. She's then attacked by a one eyed weasel and is saved by a duck. The other animals in the barnyard reject her cruelly so she's tossed out into the wild to live in a briarpatch by herself. Then there's another death by weasel in the form of a mother duck. Daisy hatches the egg but the father then sacrifices himself so the egg can hatch, another death by weasel.  Sure there's the endearing middle of a chicken raising a duck but just when you think all is well, winter comes and the kid leaves Daisy and she promptly sacrifices herself to the weasel so the weasel's babies can live (Seriously weasels don't give birth in the beginning of winter, this is a stupid plot).",1499558400,,1005,4.403225806451613
8656310,2,B00K6J7R5G,"Bloody damn depressing. A hen escapes a factory farm, is saved from a weasel by a ""handsome duck"" whom she crushes on until she finds out he's got a girl. Saddened she takes up residence in the same briar patch. She ends up ""adooting without permission"" the egg. The duck is thankfull but oblivious that the hen has feelings for him. He spends every night protecting his progeny from the weasel and get killed himself the night tge egg hatches. There's some premonition of his doom in what he says to the hen.

The hen does what he says and raises the duckling while being out down and chastised by the other animals. He grows up and after a fashion ends up leaving with the flock.

The hen, sensing she won't make it through the winter allows the weasel to catch and eat her in order to provide milk for her babies. Wtf? Really?? What the hell kind of ending is that?!!

8656312,1,B00K6J7R5G,Such a sad movie. Interesting but not what we expected. My 14 and 17 year old kids hated it. We have chickens and other animals but if we wanted to see that harsh ending we would have watched a nature documentary. She should stayed with the rooster to have a baby of her own.,1464134400,,275,4.111111111111111
8656313,4,B00K6J7R5G,Gave this to my Grandchildren for Easter basket.  They were disappointed in the 'end' until we had quite a lesson about why the end needed to be that way.  Good story line.,1461369600,,172,4.34375
8656314,5,B00K6J7R5G,"You'll find comments for this movie that says it's not for kids, it's gorey. But that's not so.

We've shown our children the story of Charlotte's Web since 1973, and there's death in that. We see the life of a fly end, Wilbur is forced to know that he very well might die for someone's food, and we see Charlotte die after laying her magnum opus, singing Wilbur a song for the last time. ""Daisy, a Hen into the Wild"" is very much a Korean Charlotte's Web.

Yes, you and your kids will see death, you will see bodies, and it does have a sad ending. But it's a beautiful sad ending. It's a selfless sad ending. And in it's sorrow, there is joy. Daisy had few goals in her life. She wanted to live outside the barn, in the grass and in the sun, and she wanted to be able to raise her own babies. When a noble ducks egg becomes her charge, she is very much a mother, wanting the best for her baby, making sacrifices to better her sons life, she made friends, and in comparison to the life she once knew-this life was worth everything. She was able to love and laugh and be happy. That's a pretty good way to end a story-to let the audience know that the character was able to do all they set out to do.

Don Bluth, legendary animator and story teller, once said ""You can show a child anything, as long as you slap a happy ending onto it.""  In this movie's case, that is still true, it's just a different sort of happy ending. It's bittersweet, but the titular character wouldn't have had it any other way, because of her memories and her open heart.

You can protect your child from this movie and they'll know nothing of it and will continue watching what you deem acceptable to them. Or you could let them see it, let them experience a small tale with a bittersweet, let them feel what's meant to be felt and maybe you'll get a memorable conversation out of it. In my humble opinion-avoiding this movie because it's sad, and it shows death, is like keeping your child from Charlotte's Web because it shows death and is sad. You'll miss an experience.",1457308800,,2049,4.284237726098191

8656317,5,B00K6J7R5G,"Wonderful!!!!  Truly one of the most moving, artistic, and emotional animated films I have ever seen.  It is definitely now one of my favorite animated movies, as well as favorite movies of all time.  The art is breathtaking, and the animation is incredible, and reminds me of a beautiful combination of Miyazaki and Disney.  I have not read the book yet, but would love to after seeing this remarkable film.

My only complaint is that this version of the film is English dubbed, and sadly the people who translated the film, as well as cast for the English voice actors made it too ""Americanized"" for my taste.  While I thought the casting for Daisy was quite good, I didn't appreciate the southern twang VoiceOver given to the otter - it detracted from what could have been a more global experience, and I felt as if it removed much of the Korean culture that exists in the story.  I've seen a clip of the original Korean with subtitles, and, in my opinion, it's much better.  I would LOVE to see the entire Korean version of this movie with English subtitles to experience the culture of the film in the way it was originally intended.

The ending in the US release is also edited to make the film more ""kid friendly"" for the US audience, which actually waters down the emotional impact of the story.  Fortunately the implications to what happens in the end are the same, so the climax in the US version is ultimately the same despite being a bit watered down.  Thankfully the original Korean ending to the film is available on YouTube, and I would highly recommend watching that AFTER you see the dubbed version available on Netflicks and Amazon.

This is not a film for most little children as it does not shy away from the realities of life (it's a tearjerker, so have a box of tissues at the ready).  This movie is more of an art piece, and will captivate the adult audience probably more than it will the younger generation.

It's not ""flashy"" by today's standard of animated films, so it's probably not as ""entertaining"" as many of our modern animated films tend to be for younger children.  However, the lack of ""flashiness"" is what makes this movie so incredibly beautiful and powerful.  Instead of relying on technology to sell their film, the animators rely on story, character, and art to woo the audience into their dazzling animal world.

The animators and filmmakers masterfully balanced beauty and story in a way that most of our modern day ""flashy"" animated films do not.  There is more depth in this 2D animated film than there is in most modern 3D films.  Sadly 2D animation is becoming more and more a lost art form.  Thankfully, the director of this movie didn't allow the modern push for 3D flashiness to influence this movie, and chose to use more classical animation methods to tell this beautiful delicate tale in the way it was meant to be told.  It is one of the most unique films I've had the joy to experience.

I honestly can't say enough good things about this movie.  Powerful and delicate, this is an animated film for the ages.",1450483200,,3063,4.60036832412523
