8540486,3,B009DVZYWG,"This appears to have been someone's attempt to start their own version of a lucha libre franchise, but instead of a single heroic masked wrestler, a la El Santo or Blue Demon, this one stars a TRIO of masked luchadors, called Los Jaguares, who really don't have a lot in the way of distinguishing details from one another. They DO ride motorcycles, though.

This is strictly bargain basement stuff, even by Mexican wrestling movies standards (and I say that as a fan), with some hilariously inept fight choreography, excruciatingly awful acting and so many mismatched shots in any given scene that some of them look like they could be made up from footage shot months or even years apart. But, then, I kinda like that sort of thing, given the right context...and how much more right a context is there than a lucha libre film?

Apparently they actually made a sequel to this the following year called ""The Jaguars vs. The Mysterious Invasion,"" but I've not seen that one and I don't know where to find a copy. Dang. Because I would watch it, too.",1376265600,,1046,4.648648648648648
