Dr. Joseph Goebbels, Reich Minister of Propaganda despised the film because it represented the old Germany of learning, music, literature and literature, not the world conquering Nazi war machine.  He subsequently had the negative and all prints destroyed.  All that was left was a 16mm print, not in particularly good condition.  In short, we're lucky to have any material on this title.  Its timing is given variously as 85 mins and 93 mins, but there is an extant print running 100 mins.  I've seen it and the extra footage is not good, but is interesting enough for study purposes.  I find the film quite charming.  The director, Erik Charell was jewish and had to leave the country as the Nazis came to power.",1466467200,,828,4.616438356164384

8412134,2,B004062YZ4,"Even the marvelous Conrad Veidt can't liven this up.  Maybe a Lubitch or Mamoulian could improve it a bit.  But by the 12th repetition of the same song I was screaming.  It is not really an operetta, just a few songs stuck in ad infinitum.

And beware, the subtitles are white and disappear frequently when on a white background.

If rewritten with a good composer and librettist it could be an enjoyable bit of fluff.",1336262400,3,418,4.52
