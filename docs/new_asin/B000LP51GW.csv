However, it's in Chinese and while I am trying to learn Mandarin, I am not anywhere close to that level. It did have English subtitles, but the subtitles went off of the screen before I could finish reading the instructions for the particular move or exercise (and I read really fast).

The production team/instructor should have run through the exercise once at full speed, then slowed down the video so you could process how to position your body. Instead, you saw a class full of students running through the paces at full speed numerous times. Overall, it was a waste of money and I wound up attending a private class instead.",1282608000,8,811,4.631944444444445
