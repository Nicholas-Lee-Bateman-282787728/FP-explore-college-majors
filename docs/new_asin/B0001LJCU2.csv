Anyways, the movie is bad. I am not sure if it is the bad acting or the bad plot. There are a few good scenes that made me want to watch the movie further.

It is very predictable. Very annoying. Very bad.

Priscilla Barnes (Terry from Threes Company) plays on it, that was almsot worth watching the movie...

See it anyways if you want to wate some time. Perhaps you will enjoy it.",1095120000,3,558,4.186915887850467
2012126,3,B0001LJCU2,"The only reason I sat through this cute but pathetic horror movie is because I love Priscilla Barnes (Three's Company).  It's basically about a rock band whose manager decides to promote the band by killing all the members, throwing in a fired crew memember who wants revenge along with her.  Priscilla is that maniacal manager, and her gift for comedy really shows through - she makes a very funny killer.  The rest of the time she's pretty snitty and generally not likeable, but I still enjoyed her performance.  The movie itself is really, really sad and not worth sitting through unless a major Priscilla fan.",1059696000,5,613,4.809523809523809

8014023,2,B0001LJCU2,"If this movie could speak, it'd try and convince you that it's a small-budget, self-aware horror satire in the vein of Scream, only trashier and darker. It would go on to tell you that it was filmed on Universal's lot in Hollywood, using actual movie sets from classic fright flicks like Psycho, Hunchback of Notre Dame, and Lost World as the film's backdrop. Sound interesting? Well, if you're a fan of clever ""deconstruction"" horror like Behind the Mask, Cabin in the Woods, and the aforementioned Scream, it probably would. You might be hopeful and maybe even ready to blind buy it. After all, thats why/how I got this flick.
  But don't do it! Abandon your hopes and dreams, ye hopeful horror junkie. Sure, it's trashy. Sleazy. Low budget. There's a killer in a plastic pompadour mask who stalks-and-stabs a rock band and film crew on a ghost town film set -- sounds awesome, right? Sounds like ""so bad it's good"" greatness. But none of it really works. In the hands of a better-skilled cult director, this might be a trashterpiece. But it ends up being a pretty tedious 90 minutes. The Backlot Murders is not terrible -- it's not worth your time, either.

  Early on there are a few funny lines involving the snobby, reluctant director, played solidly by Charles Fleischer. He berates his crew and carries on being an effeminate braggart, but his character quickly loses his charm. (Best line of the film goes to him though: ""Who do I have to xxxx to get off this picture?!""). Another problem is given how the straightforward plot is established early on, once the killer gets down to business, any subsequent dialogue just drags on and on, serving only to pad the runtime between gore-less, unimaginative kills. Fans of Priscilla Barnes might dig her role as ""Stephanie"", the band's obnoxious, mean-spirited manager. She definitely gives it her all, but non-fans may not be as into her character. Oh, Corey Haim's in this as well. Look, I really hate when critics and film fans mercilessly bash on guys like him and Feldman. They're Hollywood's easy targets; the industry chewed them up and spat them out, and we're all suppose to hate 'em for it? We're suppose to scoff at their soul-crushing descents into drug addiction and bit-parts because they haven't given us anything remarkable since Lost Boys? No thanks. Not going to do that. As far as his role in this movie goes, his character is so inanimate he's barely there -- until he isn't.

By now, you get the picture. Don't see this picture.",1461542400,,2502,4.766743648960739
8014024,2,B0001LJCU2,"Run of the mill masked killer movies. I've seen plenty of these low budget slasher s, and enjoy most of them, but this one didn't appeal to me at all. At least the mask was innovative.",1458864000,,184,4.138888888888889

If you like cheesy horror movies with plenty of good one-liners, THIS is the movie for you. If you are looking for something that is scarier than this and an actual horror movie, it is not for you. Enjoy it for what it is worth. It was not meant to be a cinematic masterpiece.",1318204800,,427,4.095238095238095
8014027,3,B0001LJCU2,"A slasher is loose on the Universal Studios backlot (called Empire Studios in the film) while a rock band films a music video.

In the Special Features, the director calls this ""an intellectual film,"" and a ""thinking person's horror film.""

Well, no.  It's not.  There's a lot of film/music industry satire, and it's cute, but the targets are so old.  Basically, lots of cynicism and jabs at bimbos, airhead rockers, and anyone else who'd do anything to ""make it"" in showbiz.  It's been done to death.

Even so, it's done well here.  Priscilla Barnes is excellent as the raspy voiced band manager.  I won't give away any spoilers, but she's still sexy at well into her 40s, and hilarious.  Having seen her on THREE'S COMPANY, I always thought her comedic skills were high, and under-appreciated.

Yes, Charles Fleischer is also hilarious as the gay director.  And there are some funny lines in this film, even if the satirical observations are ancient.

Even so, it's a small film, and none too scary.  Entertaining and well made, but nothing special.  I bought this DVD in the bargain bin for a few dollars, and it was well worth it.",1253145600,2,1134,4.714285714285714
8014028,1,B0001LJCU2,Nobody who isn't actually connected with this movie could possibly think it's any good.  Horribly bad acting and writing make this unwatchable.,1235952000,,143,5.5
8014029,5,B0001LJCU2,"This hysterical slasher makes you laugh out loud, and dedicated horror fans will even enjoy picking out some of the camera setups that are mimicking murder scenes from other films. Priscilla Barnes alone is reason to see this film--better comedy than anything she ever did on Three's Company. And teaming her with Charles Fleischer as a gay rock video director was brilliant. They steal the show. And shockingly, the murders seem really routine and standard throughout the film, but all of a sudden, at the end, we get a couple of harsh hardcore killings! To add to the fun, the guys and girls all play it up as ditsy pretty people just waiting to become victims...this one is great for party viewing.",1155859200,7,701,4.754098360655738
8014030,4,B0001LJCU2,This Movie is one of the best straight-to-video horror movies I have ever seen! I especially loved the part of having Priscialla Barnes in it! She was great in this film! The ending wasn't that shocking was sort of. The idea of this film was great! Most of the acting sucked but it was still an enjoyable film! Funny and Scary At Times! A Highly Enjoyable Film if you don't take it too seriously!,1107475200,6,396,4.364864864864865
