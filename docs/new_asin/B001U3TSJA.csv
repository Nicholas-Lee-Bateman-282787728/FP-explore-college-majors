8342756,4,B001U3TSJA,"This is a new release of the early 1998 DVD, I think the original DVD is better based on one review that said the aspect is better on the 1998 release.  Other than that, it's the same show, same content.
Many I see give this a bad review based on bad sound quality. I don't know what players they played this DVD on, but on my 5.1 system, this played great! Sure I had better 5.1 mixes on a DVD, but this is not bad at all. Most reviews on this DVD are so old, I doubt they had a 5.1 home system but just played through their old stereo TV.
  I love the arrangements and Orchestra in this DVD! I wish more bands would do this, it brings such a full and fresh sound. This is one heck of a great DVD, one that I will watch alot!",1350172800,,726,3.859060402684564

The company that released this has a horrible track record of what I consider to be bootleg releases and like this one they took a 4x3 image and squashed it to 16x9 so you have funhouse shaped performers in comparison to reality... and this copy was so blatant that they didn't even remove the Platinum Entertainment LOGO from the start of the DVD!!

Concert... 10 stars, I agree with the other reviewer..
DVD...0 stars....

If I had to choose I guess I'd choose the older out of print version because the aspect ratio is correct and the peoples heads aren't stretched sideways!!

This is a shame because if this was properly released on Blu Ray it would rocket to the top of my list... Orchestral arrangements and conducting by the late great Michael Kamin , a terrific band and Daltrey...well he's Roger Daltrey...

8342758,5,B001U3TSJA,"This is a great concert! Actually it is more of a journey than a concert. Daltrey does fresh versions of the old songs. The orchestra makes it a special event. To me, this concert is a treasure that I will always have, as long as I have A DVD player. Daltrey is an inspirational speaker and he knows how to rally the musicians behind him. The chieftains give the concert a folk sound, which makes the concert a diverse musical experience. John Entwistle does an excellent job on Behind Blue Eyes, giving a us a great bass solo that is perfectly done and compliments the song. A blues version of I Can Explain shows the roots of Daltrey's music. Pete Townshend shows up and does a great version of Who are you. Of course you have rockers on this DVD and once again John Entwistle does a great job on The Real Me. I give the concert 10 stars.",1317945600,,840,4.289308176100629
