1707815,5,B000065U3N,"Now, I know I may sound like some average teenager voicing their opinion, but Slayers is quite possibly the best anime ever, with only its own successors, Slayers NEXT and Slayers TRY surpassing them, and that's only  because they have Xelloss in them ^_~  When Flat-chested bandit killer Lina  Inverse sets out on a journey, she gets more than what she bargained for!  When attacked by some vengeful bandits, she pretends to be all frightened  and is ""saved"" by a nitwit blonde swordsman named Gourry.  Together, she and Gourry go throughout the land, looking for bandits,  treasure, and the next meal.  On their journey the meet Rezo, the Red  Priest, Zelgadis, a chimera with a personality problem or two, Ameilia, the  champion of clutziness and justice, Sylphiel, the white priestess with a  crush on Gourry, amidst a wide variety of fish men, werewolves, monsters,  and mazoku (which software sculptors translates as monsters to make things  confusing).  Turns out someone wants to resurrect the dark lord of the  world, Ruby-Eye Shabranigdu, the really hard to pronounce mazoku lord that  was cut into seven pieces, but was still alive.  If that happened, who  knows what kind of chaos would ensue, so Lina and her newly formed gang  team up with some serious magical firepower to see if they can stop him!  Software sculptors, with a few doubts here and there, did a fairly good job  on converting the series to english. However, there are some points I  should bring up.  The English Dub (the voices in english) sound horrible.  Lina sounds 30, she's somewhere between 15 and 17 in the series.  Gourry is  played by Brock's (from pokemon) voice actor.  Sylphiel's voice cracks me  up every time I hear her get highly emotional (she's supposed to be sad,  it's a very sad moment in japanese, why is it then that I always crack up  when I hear it in the dub?) which accounts for why most people write of  Sylphiel as a ditz, Ameilia sounds 25, she's only 14, and so on.  Plus, the  subtitles, which are there for your convinience, are highly screwed up when  you compare it to what it's supposed to be translating- the japanese  seiyuu.  For example.  Mazoku is a word in japanese meaning Race of Evil,  which is the name of the most powerful evil things on this island of  theirs.  Software sculptors calls the mazoku ""monsters"" even  though the monsters are defined in the official slayers books as slimes or  vampires or those things in between.  So if you don't mind small things  like that, or some phrases that have been completely changed, you'll be  perfectly happy.  Overall, though, Software Sculptors did (I shudder to say  it, but I will anyway) a fairly good job.  All you have to do is listen to  the japanese without the subtitles, and know japanese, and you'll be  PERFECTLY content.  If you don't know japanese, and aren't picky, watch it  with the subtitles. but, if you really don't wanna read what's going on,  listen to the dub.  It's nice with the DVD that you can do all that and not  have to pay for seperate versions. Thanks Software Sculptors, for finally  coming out with it on DVD! GO SLAYERS! WHEE!",964828800,13,3134,4.701851851851852
1707836,4,B000065U3N,"26 episodes of fantasy.  I'm not really into fantasy, I prefer sci-fi and noir, but so many people said I should try out The Slayers that I felt I should trust them and watch the first collection.

While the artwork seemed a tad old the story lines, the acting, the humor really helped keep my interest.  There are two major story arches and tons of stand-alone episodes which still help push the series forward.  The humor is a mixture of adult and slapstick so almost everybody is going to find something funny.  Also, I think AD&D players might enjoy the characters and how they interact, like how Lina and Gourry treat each other.

Get it used unless you are a real fan of fantasy anime.",1115337600,,691,4.488
1707837,5,B000065U3N,"Slayers is about the infamous Lina Inverse! a young, cute looking, sorceress with a temper to match, she fights the bad guys, takes the treasure, eats three times her body weight, and casts spells that would even make DBZ jealous. This has to be one of the funniest anime I've seen in a while, with comedy from the likes of Lina Inverse, the slow-witted Gourry, Justice Freak Amelia and her Father the ""Prince"", and many many more.

Technically Slayers isn't as crisp as you would expect but its pretty good nonetheless, the subtitles are on key with the usual typo here and there. The voice acting is superb both Japanese and English voices sound great and fit thier characters perfectly. Also the music is just great, both opening and closing songs are catchy, and don't make you want to skip the credits (You may even look foward to seeing the credits). Technically the series is pretty solid.

All in all this is a superb series with action, comedy, adventure,good music, great characters (good guys and bad guys), easy to understand story that won't hurt your head, and to sum it up its just plain great entertainment. This was an excellent edition to my anime collection, and I'm sure it would be the same for any anime fan.",1109116800,5,1230,4.663594470046083
1707838,4,B000065U3N,"The main character of this crazy series is Lina Inverse, a petite yet very powerful 15-year-old sorceress with red hair and a temper even shorter than her height. Though she fights against the forces of evil, she is more of an anti-heroine as she is very violent and keeps the dirty wealth of bandits for herself after killing them.
The entire ""Slayers"" anime consists of 78 TV series episodes divided up into three 26-episode seasons, five movies, and six OVA episodes. This DVD set contains the entire first season of the TV series where Lina first meets her three tag-along partners. First there's Gourry, a blonde swordsman whose great with a sword but low on brains. Zelgadis is a cursed part-demon, part-golem, part-human who plays the role of the serious loner of the group that's featured in just about every anime. Finally there's Amelia, a clumsy princess who specializes in white magic...and she's also a major justice freak. Together, these four characters make up the main cast of the TV series, though there are several other characters who temporarily join the group throughout.
""Slayers"" is basically a comedy/fantasy-adventure anime. The action consists mostly of the characters throwing DBZ-like magical blasts and other interesting spells at each other with some occassional swordplay added in the mix. It's a fairly light-hearted story loaded with humor, but each of the three seasons tend to get pretty dark, bloody, and serious towards the final episodes. My only gripes are that by the second season the relentless slapstick comedy gets stale, as do the plots which always involve Lina and the gang searching for some ancient, lost magical item in order to defeat yet another, more powerful ancient monster bent on destroying the world.
The basic plot of this season is as follows: After Lina attacks a group of bandits and steals their possessions, she meets up with Gourry. Lina soon discovers that one of the items she took from the bandits is actually the key to unleashing Shabrinigdo, a very powerful creature of evil that was sealed away long ago. After surviving several attacks by thugs wanting the key, she and Gourry encounter Rezo the Red Priest, who was born blind. He appears to be an ally at first until his true objective is later revealed, which involves freeing Shabrinigdo.
This is the best season of the TV series, IMO. First of all, because it's the first, the plot is totally fresh, unlike the second two seasons. The pacing is great too as it practically hooks you right after the second episode. It does slow down a bit in the middle with a few comedic ""filler episodes"" (as do the other two seasons), but the plot picks up again in the last few episodes. Overall, it's pretty good and I especially recommend it if you're into fantasy RPG games.
Lastly, I'd like to point out that though this is the first season of the TV series, it actually isn't the ""true"" beginning of the story. The six OVA episodes and all the movies except for ""Slayers Premium"" are actually prequels to the TV series. Lina is a bit younger and is teamed up with her original ally/rival, Naga the Serpent, a goofy, tall, scantily clad sorceress with an annoying high-pitched laugh and breasts the size of soccer balls, who just happens to be my favorite Slayer! Though regarded as inferior by most fans, I personally prefer those movies and OAVs over the TV series because Lina and Naga are just hilarious together and the plots are always fresh and fun. You can see Lina and Naga's first meeting in ""Slayers Excellent"". I recommend at least checking out ""Slayers Return"" or ""Slayers: the Motion Picture""--they're the best IMO.",1088294400,9,3648,4.857142857142857
1707839,5,B000065U3N,"This anime is GREAT. I am a seasoned vet of anime, having seen many many many anime, some good and some bad. This anime takes the cake for being the best anime I have EVER seen. It is hilarious and has good action. The young sorceress Lina is believable as a regular 15 year old girl going about her life, except that her life involves killing dragons, bandits, and demons and using magic. The animation is good but the first episode is kind of jittery when anything moves. It is bearable and it does end after about half of the first episode is over. The audio is not perfect but the story, characters, comedy, action, ect. is more than perfect. It more than deserves its five star rating.",1085356800,3,690,4.3984375
1707840,4,B000065U3N,"I give this item 4 of 5 stars, excellent quality and wonderful to watch, my only dissappointment was the english voice actors. Zelgadis goes through three before Crispin Freeman takes over, the previous two were just too timid sounding for the gloomy, angst ridden character. Also as Slayers Next was the first english dub I had heard and Crispin is the voice actor throughout that series, I just associate Zelgadis with Crispin's voice anyway.
Amelia also began with a different voice actor before Veronica Taylor took over, and again this is the voice you hear in Slayers Next.
Otherwise I loved this series and would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of Slayers",1074988800,2,666,4.8
1707841,4,B000065U3N,"I'm not sure if The Slayers was the first anime effort at building a series on an RPG game framework, but it is certainly the success that defined the genre.  It stars Lina Inverse, a teen-aged war wizard with the appetite of an army and a temper to match.  She quickly pairs up with Gourry, a golden guy with the sword of light.  Gradually, over these episodes and entire team of adventurers come together.
A large part of the episodes are basic treasure hunting and demon slaying fare, but the driving story arc is about the Red Priest Rezo who has sold his soul to the demon Shabranigdo so that he might see again (*and rule the world while he is at it).  Lina crosses paths with Rezo and his minions repeatedly until a final showdown ends the series.
The story is loud, brash, slightly off-color, and funny in a slapstick sort of fashion.  It's actually hard to pinpoint what it is that actually makes the series the success it is.  But the writing is well done and there is a host of dizzy characters waiting to pick up the pace on a moments notice.  Perhaps it is the interaction between these characters which makes the series work so well.
The Slayers has a strong influence on both adventuring and magical girl genre, the latest of which is Rune Soldier.  The latter, like The Slayers, places as much emphasis on character development and interaction as does The Slayers, but with a bit more sophistication.  After all, The Slayer's audience is now eight years older.
Central Park's decision to package all 26 episodes on four DVDs makes this a cost effective purchase, but it also means that there is little in the way of extras.  In fact, other than some short bios on the first CD, there aren't any.  Indeed, don't expect any fanciness at all as part of the package.  But do expect a lot of entertainment for your dollar.",1073433600,22,1833,4.5212121212121215
1707842,5,B000065U3N,"Ask any veteran anime fan & they'll tell you the road to otakudom is paved with episodes of Gundam, Macross, Lodoss, & Slayers.

Slayers is a very long (& rightly so) running series about a greedy, selfish,  destructive, loud, food-scarfing sorceress, her handsome braindead (equally hungry) bodyguard, her silly Marvell-brained justice loving mage friend, & the handsome grumpy secretive halfgolem Zelgadas to name a few.

This series will have you laughing so loud your neighbors will complain, so not reccomended for those whom live in an appartment complex. The music, both background & vocal are fantastic. The characters will suck you in. The series has the overall feeling of playing an MMORPG or Fantasy RTS/RPG & is Dungeon Siege-like in the way that Loddoss is like LOTR.

Other series you may like if you've already seen this are Saiyuki, Gokudo (a gender-traded more-of-the-same-thing), Bakuretsu Hunters, Rayearth, Kino no tabi, Getbackers, Nadesico, Robotech, Oagre Slayer, X1999 series, Night Walker, Vampire Princess Miyu, Sukikage Kuramatei Hight, GTO, Azumanga Daioh, Happy Lesson, Kamikaze Kaito Jeanne, Kodomo no Omocha, Super Gals, Photon, Excel Saga, Galaxy Express 999, Gunsmith Cats, Dirty Pair/Flash, Now & Then Here & There, & Sorcerous Stabber Orphen.",1047427200,3,1278,5.472081218274112
1707843,5,B000065U3N,"If you are an anime fan, Slayers is a must have. It is slap down hard core comedy, fantasy, and action. The animation is not as good as it could be, yet it fits the plot.
The story revovles around a 15-year-old expert sorceress Lina Inverse, the Dragon Spooker (according to my sub). Yet Lina isn't the typical, slutty, thin, sweet tempered, naive herione. Insteade she is short, has a crappy attitude, and is very down to Earth. As you follow Lina's travels, you will come across the cute, blonde, yet dumb as a rock swordsmen Gourry. Personaly I think Gourry puts new meaning to the term, ""dumb blonde"". Together they are traveling to Atlas City, yet they don't get there as planned.
When Lina robbs a mob of Bandits known as the Dragon Fangs, she and Gourry stumble upon an artifact that can change the way of the future. Yet Lina is not aware of the power of what she finds. Enter Zelgadis. A half human, half Chimera. He is also after the artifact, but not to rule the world.
Soon the team meets up the the exentric little princess name Amelia, who tags along with the Slayers team. Amelia is my favorite character. At first she only joins the group because she wants to learn Lina's most power spell, The Dragon Slave. But soon alterior motives keep Amelia from going back home.
To add with all the chaos going on, the team has another group of followers, only they are trying to draw the group to the city of Sairag. What is the angle of the mysterious and not too smart persuers of the Slayers gang? And what is the secret of Rezo? Also what mysterious powers dose Gourry possess? Finally, how will Lina be able to survive all the madness of multiple people trying to kill her?
This seris is non-stop, you just can't stop watching it. Not to mention, it is just too hillarious. Although I do advise you to be mature when veiwing. Some of the humor has a sexual sence to it. For example all the jokes about Lina being underdevoloped, and Lina losing her powers at 'that time of the month'.
The voices of both versions are really good. The dubbing of this seris isn't as bad as some of the other English jobs I have seen. In the orginal version, the talant of Megumi Ayashibara portrays Lina Inverse, and sings the opening and ending theme song.
Every otaku should veiw this seris, you will not be disspointed",1042156800,6,2315,4.449411764705882
1707844,1,B000065U3N,"It's just not funny. That's all I have to say about it. The series TRIES to be funny and fails miserably. It's japanese cartoon slapstick at it's worst, the whole things' humor revolves around facial distortion and being loud and rude. Kids and die-hard otakus will like it but between you and me, it's worse than Pokemon. At least I liked that AT ONE TIME.",1035849600,4,357,4.507692307692308
1707845,4,B000065U3N,"Slayers is my absolute favorite anime, but that doesn't mean I'm going to blindly rant on about how perfect it is, because that would be far from the truth. When watching Slayers for the first time, assuming you're starting from the beginning, you might find the first several episodes to be rather, dare I say, boring. You might end up thinking, ""If THIS is what everyone's recommending, I'm not getting it.""
But, keep watching, because slowly the show will grow on you. Once it gets to the middle of the series with the ""filler episodes,"" you'll find yourself wanting more. The few non-plot episodes in the middle are a great break from the slightly heavier material that came before it. And then as soon as you start to wonder what happened to the main plot, it comes back. And it's great. Even though it's a tad cliche, part of this is because Slayers is a series that makes fun of the fantasy genre while seemingly ridiculing itself.
If you've watched the whole (first) series and STILL think you're missing something, you are. The second season, ""Slayers Next"" is, in my opinion, the best of Slayers and one of the best storylines in all of anime. But this review isn't about Next.
Now for the DVDs...
Even though the box states ""remastered audio,"" Software Sculptors made a few mistakes correcting the problems. On some episodes on discs B and C, the Japanese audio track is inverted. This can cause varied effects depending on your audio setup. I've played them on two different TVs- on one of them the dialouge sounds perfectly normal, with the exception of sometimes the theme songs sound a bit muffled. On the other TV, the audio sounds like it's coming from behind instead of from in front. It's not really that big of an issue, to me at least. All the dialouge is still understandable and I can even go as far to say that it sounds a lot clearer than when it's in the proper format. However, you might not get the same results with your setup, so it's best to, when and if you buy the set, make sure that there is a sticker on the bottom of your box that says ""REMASTERED AUDIO"" with a picture of Lina on it. Or, like me, you can take your chances. If it sounds horrible, you can always exchange them through The Right Stuf. People I've heard from say that they received their replacements very soon after sending in their defective discs. If you have any questions about the program, I suggest e-mailing The Right Stuf, because when I talked to them, they were very prompt in replying to me, and they provided helpful information.
By the way, on my audio setup(s), I noticed that the English track was significantly quieter than the Japanese track, although this wasn't an issue or a glitch.
The video transfer was of very nice quality, much nicer than the Next DVDs and an improvement on the original set, I'm sure.
The extras really do nothing to enhance the series, so if you already own the series on VHS and are considering buying the DVDs because of these, don't. The interviews are with the main four voice actors (Lisa Ortiz, Eric Stuart, Crispin Freeman, Veronica Taylor) and they're only a couple of questions about them and their jobs. If you already own the Next DVDs (like I do), you might be disappointed to find out the interviews are not done by video like on that set.
The art gallery is basically screenshots and official art that you should have no trouble finding on any website with a fairly large image gallery.
The graphic novel pages are only a couple of pages from the book ""Medival Mayhem,"" and the pages aren't big enough to read the wording, much less know what's going on. You're much better off just buying the book if you're that interested.
The only thing I really enjoyed in the extras was the sketch gallery. It was a lot larger than the one on the Next DVDs, and my only problem was that I couldn't print them onto paper so I could use them when drawing fanart!
I don't have a DVD-ROM, so I can't vouch for the quality of those extras. I wouldn't expect much, though.
So, overall, this is a very nice DVD set, if you ignore the slightly annoying audio glitch. The show itself is very solid entertainment and a classic favorite with anime fans. If you buy this set, I hope you'll enjoy it as much as I have.",1029628800,21,4255,4.505821474773609
1707856,5,B000065U3N,"Slayers is one of the first anime that got me to where I am now. The Slayers is probably, to me, one of the greatest anime ever!

With a wicked on going storyline, funny and well fed characters, and awesome spells, this makes for one great thrill ride!! While my favorite of all the SLayers series is Slayers Try, I still beleive all the others are good too. You follow the story of Lina Inverse, a smart alec sorceress who is known across the land for being the number one bandit killer, who takes from the rich and....keeps it! She is also known for her lack of well... chest. But while she brags her beauty known far and wide, it really is her demonic attitude. She also has her friend Gourry, who is a blundering idiot, but great swordsman. Along with the two is Ameria Wil Tesla Serrune, Zelgaudis Graywards and the trickster, Xellos.

1707857,3,B000065U3N,"Okay, I'm a Slayers fan.  I really like the characters and the first group of episodes leading up to the first big plot climax is highly entertaining.  Also, several of the side episodes following the first plot climax are not only entertaining but laugh out loud funny.  But then the last ten episodes or so are an almost complete repeat of the ones before them (and no I'm not just talking about the villan being eerily similar).  Things got so repetitive that all dramatic tension was lost with only Amelia and Phil's antics to break up any of the monotony.
Fortunately Slayers Next (season two of this series) is an excellent step up and I suppose that most Slayers Next fans will want to see this.  It's cetainly worth checking out but the final episodes really leave you with a bad taste in your mouth so it might be a good idea to rent this fist season rather then buying.",1022457600,,879,4.46875
1707858,4,B000065U3N,"The Slayers was the first anime series that I owned, and it was a great inauguration to the world of anime. Lina is the incredibly energetic, violent and super-powerful sorceress who winds up having to save the world. She's accompanied by the dense but noble swordman Gourry, the somber Zelgadis and the cheerful and justice-crazed Amelia.
Doesn't sound too fresh or creative, does it? But Slayers seems to do just about everything right, and it adds up to an extremely funny and enjoyable experience. Lina is played by the wonderfully talented Megumi Hayashibara, possibly her best known role, and she also contributes the opening and ending songs. The rest of the cast is also solid, particularly Taketo Koyasu as the voice of Rezo. The English cast isn't as good. Everyone seems to go crazy over Lisa Ortiz as the voice of Lina, but she really can get pretty annoying at times, and is never all that brilliant. The highlight is definitely Crispin Freeman as Zelgadis.
Anyway:
I really like the timing on this series. It starts out light-hearted, and gets a little more serious until it culminates in episode 10. Then it becomes funny again for awhile, until it gradually slants toward seriousness at the end. The series is laced with slapstick comedy, and even at the end, one never gets the impression that the creators are taking themselves too seriously.
Slayers is a series that just screams fun. The animation quality is not very good, but that hardly matters. Plus, you get a fine array of extras on these discs. Slayers isn't quite top of the line, but anyone simply wanting to laugh and have a good time should see this.
p.s. for unknown reasons, the Japanese track in this set plays really really quietly. We found that plugging your DVD player (we used a PS2) directly into the television seems to clear that up.",1020556800,2,1825,4.7784810126582276

Dragons, wizards, valiant swordsmen, trolls, sorceresses, and magic up the wazoo. Yeah, that's all here. But this isn't your everyday Dungeons and Dragons schtick.
We open with a fiesty sorceress named Lina Inverse, voiced by the legendary Megumi Hayabashira on the Japanese track and the comparable Lisa Ortiz for the English dub. She's a reknowned Bandit Killer, and despite being a mere fifteen years old, knows the most potent spell in black magic.
Then we toss in brave-hearted and dim-witted master swordsman Gourry Gabriev. He's as valiant and noble as he is dense. And his skill with the sword is unequalled.
Throw in a mysterious Chimera, a justice obsessed princess with a heroine complex, a cryptic blind priest, and more bandits than you can shake a stick at, stir, and you've got the most hilarious, off-beat mix imaginable.
Slayers has the ability to go from deadly serious to whimsical and lighthearted and then back to deadly serious all in five minutes.

Sounded like some lame Buffy rip off so I refrained from suubmitting myself to legions of vampires hunting after a scantily clad and lame chick. Then they told me about the plot and I admitted I wanted to take a look. This box set runs over a hundred but I saw it on e-bay for 40 and snatched it up. I watched the whole first season in 2 nights...and now I wish I never had bothered! Because now I have to go spend more money and get the other boxed sets and see what happens to poor Lina and her band of idiots.
  This story is absolutely brilliant, carefully thought out, and incredibly advanced in it's simplicity. It's a laugh riot and a half.  Simple enough plot in the opening....Lina Inverse uses her amazing powers to steal some treasure from some bandits who come after her...and then she is saved (not that she needed saving) by a great swordsman and complete idiot named Gourry(voiced by Eric Stuart the voice of Brock/Squirtle/Dexter and may others on Pokemon). Gourry is upset cause she's not a babe but they travel together anyway running into dragons, an intriguing chimera/golem named Zelgadis, a fish guy named noonsa and Rezo the red priest who is blind and wants a rock called the philospher stone so he can set free and ancient evil that could destroy the world. And even after Lina battles through all that she still has to contend with the not so handsome Prince Phil and his clutz daughter Amelia who is a shining example of what would happen if you put a squirrel on sugar and angel dust and gave hims magical powers, a voice box, and two left feet-it ain't pretty folks. Lina and her band of not so great warriors get into one jam after another and never cease to be entertaining.

Gourry, a traveling swordsman with long flowing blond hair meets her while she is fighting some bandits and mistakes her for a defenseless little girl. Gourry isn't very smart, but he is very kind. (In the english dub he has a surfer dude accent.) The two become partners and inadvertently become tangled up in a grudge between two powerful socerers.
This anime is best for people who like role-playing games, because it closely mimics that format. It is both serious and humorous, and is my personal favorite anime. Enjoy!",993600000,,850,4.592105263157895
1707880,5,B000065U3N,"Vaya que si me dejo llevar por los comentarios de los que compraron este fabuloso Boxset, ja, si, como no, veo con sumo desagrado que la mayor parte de los que escribieron un review, acerca de este articulo encuentran fallas en el sonido de la serie, inclusive dicen que poniendola en su television que no tiene sonido estereo se oye mal (porfavor;< )pues claro que se va a oir mal, antes que nada quiero aclarar que no defiendo a cpm, por su terrible error de sonido, pero vaya si tengo un dvd es por pura logica que me va a brindar mejor sonido, mejor imagen, etc... y ya teniendo este adelanto tecnologico en mis manos, no es para que al reproducir las peliculas del dvd la vaya a ver en una television de 12 pulgadas en blanco y negro, es lo mismo que decir, tengo sonido estereo y monoaural, pero a mi me gusta como se oye el monoaural (pero en que cabeza cabe esta idea?). Se tambien que tener una buena television, no es cualquier cosa, pero si el puro dvd (y mas si es multiregion, que es lo mas recomendable) cuesta una buena cantidad de dinero, no creo que no se cuente con el dinero suficiente como para comprar una buena television, las cuales son mucho mas baratas que el mismo dvd. A que voy con tanto rodeo, es muy sencillo: Si tengo la solucion al problema pues se arregla y ya, como en mi caso, yo tengo la pelicula de Perfect Blue, muy buena y se las recomiendo, y tiene el pequeo defecto que en las televisiones grandes se llega a pixelear demasiado la imagen, pero si la pelicula es reproducida en una television de menor tamao el problema desaparece, o lo que es lo mismo (esto es referente al boxset) si se oye mal en monoaural (ahi viene la pregunta del millon de dolares) a que modo debo de cambiar? y haciendo esto se resuelve el problema, no fue tan dificil verdad? o es que acaso no les gusta la version con el audio original? (en japones) y lo prefieren an ingles? Vamos,aprender tantito japones no le hace dao a nadie. Asi que ya no se quejen por ""problemitas"" que pueden ser facilmente resueltos, por que aparte de que le dan mala imagen al producto, muchos de los que compramos nos dejamos llevar muchas veces por lo que dicen los demas, sin que realmente sepamos lo que es y lo bien que esta hecho este producto, por lo que por mi parte se los recomiendo ampliamente, por que la trama de la serie, el SONIDO y el video estan geniales, un buen trabajo de compresion, por que mientras que transcurren los 26 capitulos no ves ni un pixel el cual haga bajar la calidad de video del producto y porfavor por lo que mas quieran ya dejen de ser tan exagerados (cito una linea de un review que dio un cliente referente al boxset de Slayers, logico traducido al espaol): TODO EN ESTE BOXSET ES EXCEPCIONAL, AUNQUE ENCONTR UN PUNTO MALO: EN EL CAPITULO 4, EN EL MINUTO 14 CUANDO LINA DICE....... EL SONIDO BAJA UN 3%. Sinceramente esas son exageraciones (personalmente iba a poner otra palabra, ustedes ya saben cual) por que se supone,que nosotros compramos algo para que nos divierta, nos entretenga, mas no para estarle buscando defectos, o me equivoco?, por que si de encontrar defectos se tratase, todo lo que tenemos ya estaria en la basura, porque? pues por defectuoso. Asi que recuerden, hay que ser Criticos, No Criticones.

I've skimmed several other titles before, but when I came across Slayers, everything else was left behind.  This series has everything an anime fan could desire!  Magic, swordfighting, lame gags, funny references, strange quests, and zany situations!  Vain Lina, mentally-slow Ghourry, justice-minded Amelia and her huge pacifist father, and the much put-upon Zelgadis, keep you rooted to the spot.  It is incredibly addicting and utterly hilarious!

1707882,2,B000065U3N,"While mastering the DVD set for this funny, enjoyable fantasy-comedy, CPM accidentally made a boo-boo with the audio, the same error that was made with the mastering of the first batch of Rurouni Kenshin Volume 1 discs.. Listening to the Japanese audio track on a mono system produced horrible results. Sounds were inverted, muted and all but completely mangled-- Fortunately, Anime Works, who distributed the Rurouni Kenshin discs, had the sound mind to remaster the DVD and replace it for those who already bought it... But we're talking about CPM here, a company's name that doesn't go well with the word ""rational"".
Those of us who are unfortunate enough to have a mono setup for our DVD Players got a huge shock when we played the DVDs. ""Slayers"" is one of the most widely known anime titles in the US, and is a huge cash cow for CPM. They could have easily afforded to remaster the DVDs, but instead they kicked us in the groin as a ""thank you!"" for spending over a hundred dollars for this DVD set. And to add insult to injury, they put a tiny card in the first DVD's case basically saying ""Hey, if you have a mono audio setup and want to listen to the Japanese audio track, you're screwed. Enjoy!""
Gee, thanks for the warning, guys. If you have a stereo system, by all means buy this box set,  since you've probably already heard enough good things about the show, but if you have a mono setup... All I can say is, beware!",981331200,12,1430,4.5

However, CPM messed up massively on the Japanese audio. One track  is phase-inverted. On a mono setup, you get basically no audio. Stereo  systems sound ""funny,"" lacking highs and lows and pretty much any  sense of direction (in addition to being very quiet). ProLogic receivers  will throw everything to the back speakers.

7961301,5,B000065U3N,"Meet sorceress Lina Inverse -- she's short, flat-chested, brash, loud, eats like a barbarian, ridiculously powerful, and has a temper as hot as her fireballs.

She's also the lovable anti-heroine of ""Slayers - The Complete First Season,"" a thoroughly hilarious and warped little classic anime. The first season blends fantasy spoofs and a solid little story about good vs. evil (or justice vs. evil, depending on who you ask), when our heroes aren't dressing in drag or mugging bandit gangs.

Recently Lina robbed the bandit gang known as the Dragon Fangs of several valuable items, and when the gang's few surviving members attack her, she's rescued by a handsome but dumb swordsman, Gourry Gabriev. But the bandits aren't the only ones after her loot -- the mysterious Chimera Zelgadis and his weird minions want one of the items Lina stole, while the revered priest Rezo wants to stop Zelgadis.

But after being abducted and then freed by Zelgadis (and nearly molested by a giant fish), Lina discovers that she may have her allies and enemies switched around. And as Lina, Gourry and Zelgadis are pursued by Rezo's monstrous allies, they learn the real reason that Rezo wants the statuette -- yes, it's to unleash ultimate evil upon the world, and all that.

After all that, Lina and Gourry find themselves traveling with a justice-happy princess named Amelia, just in time for a bounty to be put on their heads. To find out who their new enemy is, they have to travel to the city of Sairagg -- dodging a crazy mercenary, a manipulative wedding-happy sorceress, a seemingly unkillable wizard, a gay sea dragon, and countless mercenaries and heroes.

But Sairagg only provides more questions, as Lina and her friends -- including Zelgadis and the timid shrine maiden Sylphiel -- confront the sorceress that has a grudge against him. But they're shocked to learn that the mastermind is an old foe that they had previously killed -- and he has a whole new evil plot to destroy the world. And all that.

Spoofs of the fantasy genre are a dime a dozen. The real challenge is creating a spoof that also has a story and mythology all its own -- and ""Slayers"" succeeds brilliantly at doing that. Not only is the complete first season gutsplittingly funny, but it also has a really solid storyline and thoroughly enjoyable characters -- although admittedly Amelia takes some getting used to.

There are two interconnected arcs of epic battles with Dark Lords and maniacal wizard-priests, with sword duels, hidden libraries, mystical ruins, frequent explosions, devastated cities and multi-coloured trolls ransacking quaint medieval villages. It's a solid enough fantasy series, and it takes the usual fantasy tropes -- big dumb guy with magic sword, sorceress, Dark Lord, plucky princess -- and promptly turns them on their heads.

And there's a lot of humour too, raging from a horde of Lina and Gourry clones (""It's... TINY!"") to a series of running gags. At least half the episodes contain and/or end with some kind of massive explosion and possible rioting. And a couple stories wedged between the two arcs are entirely devoted to comedy -- including Lina being bribed to ""marry"" a rich boy, and the very macho Gourry having to dress as a girl (""Somebody please take my life!"").

Lina is a brilliant fantasy anti-heroine -- she's flat-chested, assertive, hypersensitive and wonderfully bombastic, and Lisa Ortiz does an excellent job. Eric Stuart is a little more awkward as Gourry, a swordsman with a childlike attitude and a tiny brain, he improves as the season goes on. Hyperactive princess Amelia is kind of annoying at first, with all her jumping and yells about justice, but fortunately she becomes more likable when they get to Sairagg (""I hate fighting this thing!"").

Zelgadis is the best-rounded character of the bunch, since he starts as a semi-villain but soon reveals that his only real goal is to become a human being again. Unfortunately Daniel Cronin voices Zelgadis for the first half of the series, and makes this complex character sound like a depressed stoner. Thankfully Crispin Freeman brings more humour, anger and power to the character after that.

The complete first season of ""Slayers"" is a solid fantasy series that also happens to be a hysterically funny spoof. Definitely a must-see.",1223942400,,4312,4.975

The main character is Lina, a cute, but bad tempered, rude, obnoxious, always hungry, flat chested 15 year old(someone has issues) who meets a dumb as a rock swordsman who is skilled in his art Gourry, the silent depressed chimera Zelgadis, and the crazy justice freak, Amelia. As I stated before I started on episode 11 and missed the Shabranigdo arc. During the show I wondered who was this Rezo guy was they were talking about. Then in Episode 18 my questions got answered. I saw the best anime villian up to date!!! Copy Rezo!!!! He was evil sacrastic , powerful, cool, and just looked awesome!!(yeah i obsess about him) and his death scene was very tragic. So from there, this series went from okay, to number 1!!!! The Japanese Cast is BRILLIANT, especially lina's Gourrys',and (gasp) Copy Rezo's :and the Subbed Version is actually enjoyable, the voices fit their characters. This anime rules, the first season is the best, has great animation, storyline, humor, battles, characters, and COPY REZO!! Great voice acting Koyasu Takehito, and Peter Davis!!

Personally this is my favorite season out of the three. True Zelgadis does have a 'slight' voice change in the middle of the season, however the art, the story and the humor get you further into the series.
