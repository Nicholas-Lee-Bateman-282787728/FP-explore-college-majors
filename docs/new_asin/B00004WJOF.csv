7925477,5,B00004WJOF,"Pretty good movie, it wasn't what I expected,  kind of a B movie, but a fun silly movie. I enjoyed it.",1425945600,,102,3.857142857142857
7925478,5,B00004WJOF,"I like Matthew Lawrence and that was the reason that I got this movie.  I am so glad I did. What an entertaining and fun surprise. In a nutshell, this is a variation on the Frankenstein story. Modern, what happens is 2 of the jock goons in school punch out the Goth kid, he falls into an empty pool and dies. Matthew Lawrence (Frank Stein) gets to try out his reanimation experiment with the help of the jocks, they have to or go to jail. The Creature (so to speak) is none other than a young Ryan Reynolds! I will say no more about the story. You will get some laughs, suspense, mystery and just a fine old time. Matthew Lawrence and Ryan Reynolds are terrific, the jocks (I think) are Justin Walker and Charles Fleischer...terrific, the girls....terrific. The characters (teachers, family) terrific. You will have a blast with the quips and humor.",1416009600,,849,4.549019607843137
7925479,4,B00004WJOF,"I bought this movie without seeing it because I love straight-to-DVD campy horror, and I love Ryan Reynolds. It's fun, cheesy, and kept me entertained. It's not rated, but would be an easy PG-13 for mild violence and brief language. Not as good as Idle Hands (one of my faves), but in the same vein. Think Hocus Pocus with more adult humor.",1341705600,,340,4.5
7925480,3,B00004WJOF,"Obviously aimed at a teen market, BOLTNECK is a diverting, unremarkable film loosely based on the Frankenstein legend.  Matthew Lawrence stars as the genius who wants to bring something back to life.  He gets his chance when two jocks accidentally kill a nerd (delightfully played by Ryan Reynolds).  Lawrence rejuvenates him but unknowingly uses the brain of a recently killed murderer/robber.  The new Reynolds is cool, and an asskicker.  Meanwhile, Lawrence has fallen for the demure Macy (a lovely Christine Lakin), and he wants to win her over, in spite of his creation.

Shelley Duvall and Judge Reinhold as Lawrence's parents are awful, but they aren't really that integral to the movie.  What little effects there are won't make you forget Terminator, but it's a pleasant and harmless little movie.",1095724800,,806,5.153846153846154

Frank Stein uses his father's research to bring a popular jock back form the dead in order to get popular. Good news is that Frank is in the in-crowd with the newly resurrected Karl. Bad news is that Karl was given the brain of a mass murder. Now Frank has to stop Karl before he kills the homecoming queen (Buffy's Bianca Lawson).
This movie was done before on Fox with Daniel Ragsdale of Herman's Head fame. This time we get Matthew Lawrence, along with Kenny Blank (in one of his rare on camera roles), Christine Larkin, Richard Moll, Judge Reinhold and Shelly Duvall. If you need a harmless movie for Halloween, this is the one to show.",1065312000,,649,4.508474576271187
7925482,4,B00004WJOF,"So far I haven't been able to locate a soundtrack to this kooky, wacky, zany movie, but I am seriously wanting/needing the DVD.  (It's on my wish list now).
The Party Rave during the credits is based on the ""Mad Monster Party"" song by Edith Ennis from the movie of the same name.  But, it is a remix performed by Ryeland Allison entitled ""Moster Party Song"".  I have yet to find a recording of my very own, so if anyone else does, please clue me in.
The Jazz tune is entitled ""Don't Waste My Time"" performed by Extract; written by Kurt Metzler and Marjorie Extract.  I hope this information help you all out.
""Please!  Don't kill me Frank!  We were supposed to be on cereal boxes together...""",1024790400,4,692,4.409448818897638
7925483,3,B00004WJOF,"I missed the first half hour or so but I caught on, it wasn't too shabby over all, for a slapstick teen flick. But ah, I liked the soundtrack better too, heh. Ok I've been racking my brain to remember the title and artist of the song that played a few times through the movie.. it was a jazzy/blues little number. Help?",1007251200,,319,4.161290322580645
7925484,5,B00004WJOF,"this movie was great. the only thing was that i want to find out what the song was at the halloween rave.
  someone please!....... tell me!....",992649600,,143,4.461538461538462
