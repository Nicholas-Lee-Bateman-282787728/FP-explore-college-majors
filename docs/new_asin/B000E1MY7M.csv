He is magnificent in this movie, as is Bando Tamasaburo (no surprise) and all the female characters.  That being said, I have a very soft and nostalgic feeling towards the artist, Takehisa Yumeji, so I didn't particularly care for the way he was portrayed, but that is just my prejudice.  If it was just some fictional character I wouldn't have had an emotional attachment to him and would have been more open to the movie overall.  I have no idea how closely the events in the movie mirror his real life.  Overall, though the movie can be considered kinda ""weird"", it is creative, compelling, and as mentioned previously the cast is fantastic.  Not for the kiddies.",1375574400,,810,4.702127659574468
