Elvis is probably  the definitive example of such appeal. Howard Hughes is another. This is  probably why I watched this episode of the 6 part series, but have no  yearning to see the earlier ones. This is not a criticism of the  film-makers since, for what it is, this documentary is fascinating viewing.  It features no footage of Elvis, a few stills but otherwise members of his  ""Memphis Mafia"", sitting around sharing anecdotes of the last 7  years of Elvis' life. We aren't told the specifics of the 5 men's jobs, but  the manner in which these good ole boys speak creates the impression of  informed (and private) confidences. The King's drug dependency is  chronicled, evolving from his initial use of diet pills in the army, to  sleeping pills, wake-up pills, and pain pills. All this medication was  prescribed, but prescribed by a doctor who later lost his licence to  practice because of charges of over-medicating his patients. The  drug-taking changed Presley's behaviour but the boys also claim it was  Colonel Tom Parker's monomaniacal control over his client that eventually  reduced him to a comatose lump of water retention. The tale of Barbra  Streisand's offer for Elvis to co-star in her remake of A Star Is Born is  raised, and the boys believe that the Colonel vetoed it because he was  afraid of the influence Streisand would have on Elvis, since she is thought  of as an independent entertainer, and a threat to Parker's sole management.  Some might argue that having Jon Peters, her then lover, acting as manager  for Streisand altered the trajectory of her own career. (They later  disagreed and separated over Barbra wanting to make Yentl). Whether or not  Elvis was capable of playing the role in Streisand's film, he was certainly  willing to try, as well as keen to tour internationally, and we are told  that Parker killed the latter ambition since he was an illegal Dutch alien  and afraid of being prosecuted. However Elvis was also to  blame for his  frustrations, since a sense of loyalty kept him tied to the Colonel, and  fear made him unable to be without him. The boys want to convince us that  they would have preferred Elvis to end his association with Parker, but one  has to wonder who was actually paying them, if Elvis was so dependent. We  hear of  Elvis acting as an agent for the FBI, his collection of guns, his  little-known philanthropy, and his physical and mental deterioration. In  the face of accusations of opportunism, the boys deny that they were yes  men to Elvis' indulgences. Given the choice of either abandoning him to his  drug abuse, or trying to moderate it, they say they chose to stay to help,  though when Elvis eventually tired of their interference and fired them,  their hurt could best be alleviated by writing a tell-all book ""What  Happened?"" The boys claim they wrote it out of love, and that Elvis  needed something this dramatic as a cataylst for change. The book was  published, in spite of Elvis' efforts to stop it. This makes the story they  tell of another assistant who stole (presumably) pornographic polaroids  from Elvis' bedroom ironic, since the boys seem to take the higher moral  stance against this person, yet then don't hesitate to betray their former  employer. This hypocrisy is repeated in their condemnation of the TV  concert footage taken a few weeks before Elvis' death, but their argument  that people didn't have to see Elvis in such a state, is silly when he was  performing to live audiences. I gather that part 6 of this series covers  the details of Elvis' death even though it is titled ""The Legend Lives  On"", since it is not here.",968976000,,3770,4.771739130434782
