4690477,5,B005GHBL3W,These guys are all great. Interesting to see where they are now. A lot of them have become mega stars.,1424390400,,102,4.15
4690478,5,B005GHBL3W,"if you are a FREAKS and GEEKS fan, watch this video interview",1420070400,,61,4.166666666666667
4690479,2,B005GHBL3W,I didn't cate for undeclared so I was unhappy with most of the interview being them. I wanted to see more of the Freaks and Geeks cast.,1418169600,2,135,4.037037037037037
4690480,5,B005GHBL3W,As a fan of both shows it was fun to see the cast appear as they are now and Judd Apatow was great at asking the questions with the cast. Jason Segal and Seth Rogin are just naturally funny guys and Jay Barachnel ( of Undeclared) is bashed endlessly! Monica Keenan is still hot! These types of shows are great to watch as a fan and this is a great place to watch them! James Franco didn't show and was bashed constantly with these on the set stories!,1413936000,,450,4.125
4690481,3,B005GHBL3W,"Love these guys, but this kinda missed the mark. Strange miss match of celebs and lacks the insightfulness that these reunions can foster, but for the die hard fan it is must see!",1397779200,2,179,4.454545454545454
4690482,2,B005GHBL3W,"Great seeing most of the cast of such a GREAT show but it plays a little to loose and some of the actors only get one question. Wish it would have been a bit more formal.
The worst part is Seth Rogans ""Cackle Laugh"". It's not even a true laugh and it is so annoying and loud that it would have been nice if his mike was turned off unless he spoke.",1389312000,4,347,3.8333333333333335
4690483,5,B005GHBL3W,"I really liked the laid back atmosphere of the panel. I watched a couple other PaleyFest panels before this and I was so glad these panels were led by Judd Apatow instead of the woman who led some others. The cast and crew were so entertaining, I wish it were longer.",1389052800,2,267,4.254901960784314
4690484,5,B005GHBL3W,"Plain and Simple... If you are a fan of either of these shows, just watch this entertaining reunion. You won't be disappointed!",1382054400,2,127,4.818181818181818
4690485,5,B005GHBL3W,"If you are as obsessed with these two shows as I am, and clamoring at the bit to relive the glory days of those single seasons, this is it! I found it fun and intriguing.",1357776000,6,170,3.8857142857142857
8471556,5,B005GHBL3W,"One of the best shows ever, hence the networks cancelling it after one season.",1477958400,,78,4.642857142857143
8471557,4,B005GHBL3W,"For a Freaks and Geeks fan, this is a must-see. I didn't care much about the Undeclared reunion but it was still nice to see, I guess. There are some interesting stories from behind the scenes of both shows and it's just nice to see them all back together.",1461715200,,256,4.244897959183674

8471563,3,B005GHBL3W,This would be fun for true fans of the old series. I watched it really only because one of the actors is a friend of mine.,1439683200,,122,3.730769230769231
8471564,5,B005GHBL3W,"Love it!! A big Freaks and Greeks fan,  A must have item for fans",1430092800,,65,3.642857142857143
