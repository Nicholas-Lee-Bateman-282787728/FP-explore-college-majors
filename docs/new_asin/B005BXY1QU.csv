4649225,5,B005BXY1QU,"Mary Tole is blessed to be a woman who is not only successful, but has a great love of family and adventure for the outdoors. Working as a historical preservationist in the city, she loves to get away from the busyness by heading to Silver Falls where she has spent her childhood becoming familiar with the mountains, lakes and hiking trails she has come to love and adore. She finds this is where she can connect with God and her grandmother, who passed away a few years ago. It's also where she can feel at peace with her life.

While her and her boyfriend Kent spend the weekend in the mountains hiking, they come to the aid of a little girl, Charlene, who has followed her dog chasing a robin and has managed to sprain her ankle. When they take her back to her home, they find out she is the current resident and owner along with her father of the Christmas Lodge. This is the place Mary and her family have spent countless years and memories as a family and learn that it's in a state of disrepair.

When she meets the owner, Jack Rand, Charlene's dad, she offers to find out if her company will provide the funding through a grant to help with restoration. Lucky for her as well that her father and brothers own a contracting company and can provide an analysis for how much work it will take to bring it back to its former glory.

I received this heartwarming and charming DVD compliments of Propeller for my honest review and have to say as one who collects Christmas movies, this one has found a home! I LOVED it! Not only is it a Dove Approved family movie, the message behind the movie is one that we all need to remember during the busy holiday and that family is really what is the most important gift of the Christmas season and the memories we make year after year. I am so proud to be honored with reviewing this Thomas Kinkade movie and rate this one a 5 out of 5 stars.",1320019200,3,1887,4.294943820224719
4649226,5,B005BXY1QU,"My kids (aged 18 down to 9) and I watched this movie. We all loved it. In fact, my kids are watching it again right now. It's a good family-friendly movie. The characters have morals and respect for each other. There is no foul language or inappropriateness. At one part, two unmarried people are at a hotel and the lady gives the man ""his"" room key. They could have been a little more clear by showing them going into their own rooms separately, but you get the idea. The movie is basically about fixing up the Christmas Lodge since it's fallen in disrepair. However, it isn't about the wood that goes into it - it's the heart and soul - the memories - that make it worth the cost to fix. Plus, a couple falls in love. :) We highly recommend this movie and it will probably become a must-see movie each Christmas season. I did receive this DVD for free in exchange for my honest review. However, I was not required to write any reviews other than on my blog, and none had to be positive. We just liked it so much I wanted to share with you here too.",1319673600,5,1050,4.2288557213930345
4649227,5,B005BXY1QU,"Christmas Lodge is a wonderful family movie and sweet love story all in one.  Mary loves spending time in the mountains, because when she was young her family always spent time in the mountains at the Christmas lodge. By accident she finds the Christmas lodge again and finds out it is falling apart. This really upsets her and she wants to do something about it.
  Mary's grandfather had heart surgery and then a stroke and they don't know if he will live or not. I love the sweet relationship Mary and her grandfather have. You can tell they love each other so very much.
  Mary also falls in love with Jack who owns the Christmas lodge. They work together in life, love and rebuilding the lodge, but so many problems keep coming up.
  The actors/actresses do a fantastic job in this movie and it is just a beautiful place to have a movie, and what isn`t wonderful with Thomas Kinkade involved?
 This is a movie to watch with your family for Christmas and beyond. A G-rated movie and one full of love, faith and family. Highly recommended for one and all.

4649228,5,B005BXY1QU,"This isn't your typical Christmas tv movie.  It is a good movie that does away with all the Hollywood crap; no swearing, no spoiled brat-type people.  I wish more movies would go back to this type of show.",1319328000,7,205,4.368421052631579
4649229,5,B005BXY1QU,"Wonderful movie. It shows the belief in God ,Family,an Love. Very touching movie. What Christmas really should mean. The faith,we all have in God .It brings two families together after many years. I truly enjoyed the movie.",1319328000,6,223,5.054054054054054
4649230,5,B005BXY1QU,I bought this movie because I love family holiday movies and I like the acting of Michael Shanks (from Stargate SG1).  I was not disappointed.  This is a very heart-warming movie and is well worth the time watching it.  It will rank in my top 5 favorite holiday moves.,1318809600,10,268,4.428571428571429
4649231,5,B005BXY1QU,"The movie has a very warm tone to it. A few rough spots, and a strong spiritual foundation, but a very nice addition to my collection. Well worth the investment from a guy who loves Christmas.",1318636800,7,192,4.361111111111111
4649232,5,B005BXY1QU,"It's definitely a Christian script. But then, Christmas is based on Christ--His birth. So a strong Christian emphasis is natural. There will be those that cry ""Religion"" or Preachy"" and they are correct. Preaching faith is what Christ's life was about. No violent action here, but instead a family film with a positive message.

Not being a huge fan of Thomas Kinkade, my wife suggested we buy and view this film. Now I'm glad. The Kinkade connection is from one of his paintings. So here we have a G-rated; cozy romance being a result of fate; a save the lodge campaign where its past aligns with its future; it is hope-faith-dreams coming true; through generations of family.

Cast is lead by Mary (Erin Karpluk-TVs ""Being Erica"") who decides to take the lodge by the horns to save it. Jack (Michael Shanks-TVs ""Stargate"") is the lodge builders' ancestor trying to keep it alive. Mary's sis Cathie is Victoria Banks, a 1st time acting role, but she also writes and sings 2 tunes for the film: ""The Greatest Gift"" & ""You Believe in Angels"". Good stuff. The rest of the cast is not your Oscar-winning stars, but they do make this an enchanting evening in the mountains, with an abundance of beautiful scenic shots. You can almost feel the log fire crackling, aromatic, heat.

Tradition lives on as surely as the family ancestors who put their eternal faith in Christ. It's a new worthy Christmas heart-warmer story in the tradition of ""Miracle on 34th Street.""

Closed Captioning is available.
Bonus is a ""Making of..."", trailer, and a Kinkade lodge painting ad.
Dove Family Approved viewing for all ages. It's what my generation used to call ""A Norman Rockwell Christmas"". Perhaps now we should say, ""A Kinkade Christmas.""",1318550400,127,1723,4.830508474576271
4649233,4,B005BXY1QU,"Mary lives and works in the city, but she is renewed by the times she can escape to the mountains. On a weekend getaway to the mountains with her boyfriend it becomes apparent that the mountains are not his idea of a good time. He wants to hang at the lodge where they are staying and she wants to get out in the fresh air and hike. As they are hiking they come across an injured little girl and her dog. They carry her back to her home, which it turns out is an old lodge where Mary's family had spent the Christmas holidays for years in her young life, until her Grandma died. After that her Grandpa couldn't bear to go back. It has now fallen into disrepair, but Jack, the injured girl's father, is trying to restore it to it's former function as a rustic guest lodge. Just so happens that Mary works in the field of historic restoration and her father and brothers have a construction company. Mary formulates a plan to help get the lodge in shape so that she can bring her family , including her ailing grandfather, back for one more Christmas together at the lodge. Along the way things go south with her boyfriend and Jack's daughter senses romance in the air.
This is very family friendly, aside from a couple of casual uses of the Lord's name. There is no potty humor, or swearing, or violence. There is nothing suggestive--in fact, when Mary is on her weekend away with her boyfriend, they actually get separate rooms at the lodge. How often does that happen in movies these days? Though family friendly, I don't know that it will interest young children. It is mostly about people and relationships and faith. There is no major conflict in the plot. The most intense issues are whether or not Mary's grandfather will get well enough to join the family at the lodge, and whether or not there will be enough funding available to finish the lodge. Not a movie that leaves knots in your stomach as you wonder how things will turn out, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. When I'm stressed I want to watch a movie that will relax me, not add more to my stress.
The acting is usually fine--though not always stellar. Erin Karpluk is good at portraying emotion in her role as a young woman who can't face that her grandfather isn't getting better and that her boyfriend is pulling away.
This movie is very strong on faith in God and strong family ties--it is Dove Family Approved. There is frequent talk of finding what the Lord wants for you and being guided by Him. Characters often mention talking to God and the deceased grandmother. If you are not comfortable with that, this movie would probably not appeal to you. If you miss that in most movies these days, you will appreciate finding it here.
Not ever going to be in my top ten for Christmas movies (it is maybe more of a 3 1/2 than a full 4 star movie in my book), but not a bad way to escape in a Christmas fantasy for an evening of family-friendly entertainment.",1318550400,98,2932,4.421441774491682

4649238,1,B005BXY1QU,I just could not get into this movie! I thought the acting and everything was terrible. I love Hallmark Christmas movies so this was surprising. Halfway through I had to turn it off.,1515542400,,182,4.545454545454546
4649239,1,B005BXY1QU,Pretty sure they play this movie in Hell.  The only thing worse than this movie is the muppets singing 12 days of Christmas.  I absolutely hated this movie.  I'd like to formally request that any additional copies are incinerated ASAP.  Save yourselves people!  Stick with the classics on Christmas movies unless you like the taste of your own vomit in your mouth.,1514937600,,364,4.806451612903226
4649240,4,B005BXY1QU,"A lot of people may not know this, but, if you go into the Function menu of your DVD player and select display options, there is a way to turn on Closed Captions in the DVD player itself....

without doing this, they WON'T appear on the screen automatically, making one think that there are no captions....

For the person who complained about this, I have this disc and was able to obtain CC using this method...what there wasn't , was SUBTITLES, which is something completely different as it originates from the disc itself and has nothing to do with the controls of the player.

again, when I am talking menu here, I am talking about the DVD PLAYER MENU, not the menu of the DVD itself.  An important distinction.....

as to movie itself, it is a charmer and brought tears to my eyes at the end...",1514851200,,800,4.4520547945205475

4649244,5,B005BXY1QU,"This is a cute, gentle family movie that is uplifting and full of faith based conversations. For the woman, there's romance, but not overly so. There's no kissing or sexual innuendos of any kind, which makes this appropriate for all ages! Additionally, there's no violence and no cursing. All of the language, even the scenes where folks are frustrated, use gentle, affirming language. This is truly a film for all ages!",1511049600,,420,4.929577464788732

4649249,5,B005BXY1QU,"Get this movie.  You will like it.  The plot involves one familys long history spending Christmas at a lodge.  All of that stopped years ago when the grandmother dies.  Years later, the lead character, Mary is hiking, and in a chance meeting, saves a little girl who has fallen over a cliff.  This little girl happens to be the daughter of the lodge owner.  A chance meeting leads to love.  Love between the main characters, and the history of the two families and the lodge.  Marys grandfather finances the restoration of the lodge, which is in need of costly repair, in fact the entire family gets involved with the project.  The only strange and unbelievable thing about this story is the young childs reaction to and somewhat obsession with meeting Marys grandfather.  Other than that one weird part of the story, overall the movie is very good family entertainment  . . .  no foul language, no violence, no inappropriate behavior.",1508198400,,935,4.775

I didn't notice until now that it was presented by ""Thomas Kinkade"" so now I get why it was overly religious. As an atheist, I had a hard time not rolling my eyes at all the ""it's god's plan"" stuff.

I watched the movie because I like Michael Shanks but I don't think I could stomach this one again.

The story would have been just as good without the Christian overtone, in my humble opinion.",1483228800,,561,4.534653465346534
