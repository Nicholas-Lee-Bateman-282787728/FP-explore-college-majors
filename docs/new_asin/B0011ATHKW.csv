3437126,4,B0011ATHKW,"Despite the fact that this movie's title, so far as I could tell, has absolutely nothing to do with the story itself, I really enjoyed this movie.  A lot of it has to do with the fact that I love watching a woman outfight groups of male attackers.  Return of the Kung Fu Dragon might even appeal to some women out there because the amazing Polly Shang Kuan finds her character taking care of all the important business by herself.

Phoenix Island's Golden City is an idyllic sort of place, mainly because the unique fighting style of the emperor's three top generals keeps would-be bad guys at bay.  The Big Three prove to be significantly overrated, however, when the Black General shows up with his henchmen and a clever magician.  The emperor is enticed to his death by a magically controlled rabbit, the city falls rapidly, and the three big shots are either killed or forced to go into hiding.  In my book, that's just not A level work by the generals.  The Black General soon sets up shop, raising the former empress' daughter as his own (or so he thinks), never knowing that the true princess has been shuttled away to a safe location.  Nineteen years pass, and then the time comes for the princess to return and reclaim the throne for her martyred family.  She'll need allies, of course, so it's only right that they would be the descendants of the three generals (along with an inexplicable, possibly magical little man with the world's worst hairstyle).  This newly formed team will have to defeat both the Black General and his magician sidekick in order to restore the Golden City to its past glory (they also have to devote some time to rescuing the princess, who seems to have quite a talent for being captured).

The fighting isn't all that impressive, but there's plenty of it.  I found that fact especially important early on, as it took me a while to figure out who was good, who was evil, and what exactly was going on here.  (Admittedly, I tend to find most martial arts films rather confusing in the beginning.)  The male heroes can certainly hold their own in hand-to-hand combat, but they tend to disappear from time to time, particularly when Kuan's character is going at it hard and heavy with their most powerful enemies.  Kuan really steals the show because she has more moves than any of her co-stars, and her confident, borderline sassy personality is pretty sexy.

Return of the Kung Fu Dragon isn't a particularly noteworthy martial arts film, but it's certainly more interesting and entertaining than many of its cinematic siblings.  Keep in mind, though, that we're talking about a 1978 Hong Kong film, so don't expect elaborate sets, wire-assisted special effects, or decent English dubbing.  For me, that's part of the charm, but I suspect hard-core martial arts fans won't enjoy this film half as much as I did.",1189728000,,2847,4.705645161290323

3437129,4,B0011ATHKW,"Lots of so-so fighting, a silly story line and confusing undeveloped characters (worse than the usual kung fu flick) somehow add up to a mind-numbing but enjoyable experience. Some odd humor and cartoony characters like add some laughs. It actually has the feel of an old chapter serial for some reason. Perhaps it is the odd costumes.",1419897600,,335,4.894736842105263

Old dude with super beard who uses it in his King-Fu style? Check.  Character development? Non-existent.  Cheesy sets?  To the max.
