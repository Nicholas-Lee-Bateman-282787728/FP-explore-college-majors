8095147,3,B000C1VAJW,"This is the one instructional DVD created by Cynthia Funk. She remains active as a yoga instructor in Canada (2011), and has released a yoga practice CD. There is nothing intimidating about her demeanor, and her Canadian accent should have some charm for most USA viewers.

There is a wordy introduction (philosophy, way of life, etc.) that most will never watch a second time, and then a demonstration of ujjayi breathing. Ms Funk then presents a shoulder, side, standing, and balance poses, along with several seated poses. These discreet sections are all instructional, and not presented as a routine with continuous flow. There is a section which presents the sun salutation, the only routine on the DVD. There are 17 bookmarks, so you can easily navigate to the section you want.

This is a low budget affair, a few steps above amateur quality. There is only one presenter and no students, and the environment is merely floor, mat, walls. Ms Funk wears a lapel microphone that produces sound of varying loudness and changing tone as she moves.

Bottom Line: This is an OK instructional DVD to use before attending your first yoga class and for a some weeks after. The DVD is targeted at absolute beginners, and others should stay away. Pacing is appropriately slow, but there is too much lecturing without movement in a few sections. A true beginner might use the DVD for perhaps ten practices, and then it is time to advance to new poses and routines.

Recommended to true beginners only. This DVD is a sensible, no frills tool to help you start. ***1/2. If production values were a bit higher and the script better edited, it would earn four or more stars.",1304035200,,1663,4.7839721254355405
