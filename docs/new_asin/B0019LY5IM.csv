3439106,5,B0019LY5IM,Why wait for an undetermined date of release for season five when you can stream season six straight from the islands broadcast centre? You wouldn't believe me if i told you the Harlem Globetrotters put them up to one of their biggest challenges yet. It's all so exciting to watch it all unfold.,1232409600,8,295,4.584905660377358

It jumps around too much. Forward in time...backward in time....flashbacks...flash forwards....

3439239,2,B0019LY5IM,"If you buy DVD sets for the special features, don't get this one. If you buy them just as a way to watch the show, then get it because Season 5 continues the tone of Season 4 of creating tension via the flash forwards although there's much more sci-fi in S5. Overall I'd say it's a bit sloppier than S4 as it incorporates retconning but more exciting than S1.

The actual special features on this DVD set are about the same as the rest of the series DVD sets, a few small behind the scenes videos. But S5 only has 2 commentaries: 5x01 and 5x10.",1461456000,,544,4.180952380952381

A couple of the disks are scratched & they skip, one of the disk slots is broken and won't hold the disk in place, so it falls to the floor every time I open the case. You should check these things before wrapping it in plastic all nice & neat and sending it out. Instead of being ""Used/Like New"" -which is why I ordered from this instead of paying $20 for a brand new one- it should be labeled ""fair."" If I rated from 1 to 10, 10 being best, you'd get a 4, and that's only because of how fast it came.",1432080000,,586,3.9745762711864407

Although, there are times when the story drags out too much & it becomes obvious that the writers started to pursue one line of thinking & then changed thinking it manages to hold together very well.  There are two really memorable performances, one is Michael Emerson & the other is Jorge Garcia.  They form a counter balance of good & evil while at the same time managed to engage the observer in their own fictional personalities.
All things considered a good series to watch.",1426982400,,569,4.67

But it did tie up loose ends and little mysteries from the first four seasons. When it was on TV I watched a couple of episodes in season 2 or 3 and matched the title-- I was so lost I gave up. If you did likewise, you might enjoy watching it again without the wait between episodes. I must say once I started, I was driven to watch it through to the end.",1389139200,,493,4.040816326530612

3439545,5,B0019LY5IM,"As the penultimate season of the show the series finally started to give us some answers in the 5th season and revealing the back story of the island and its inhabitants.  This season more than any of the others can get confusing because of the time shifting.  After the six characters left the island at the end of season 4 we find that either the island or the people on it began shifting through time.  So in one episode you could be in the present, in 1954, 1977 or the late 1980s.  And you really have to pay attention to keep track of what is going on.

Once the shifting stops most of the action occurs in 1977 and we see things like the creation of the hatch, learn more about the Dharma initiative as well as ""The Others.""  We also lean about Ben and Widmore's conflict and see the beginning of it.  The season finale leaves us with a cliffhanger surrounding ""the incident"" which necessitated the pushing of the button every 108 min in season 3.  There are still a lot of questions, but this season definitely starts to fill in some of those gaps.

As far as the discs go for those who get the blu rays.  There are a total of 5.  Most of the special features (aside from commentary tracks) are on disc 5, although there is a making of the 100th episode feature on disc 4.  As usual the A/V quality is great and you can play the episodes in season play mode so you can stop and pick back up where you left off.  The special features are not as abundant as in the past seasons, but still enough to make those who like to go through the extra material happy.",1384560000,2,1564,4.225589225589226

From then on the story goes at a breakneck pace, with occasional back stories of the individual characters.
The characters are very well written and acted, all the actors are believable and give excellent performances.

3439628,3,B0019LY5IM,"This just ain't the best show on television.

I watch it for the occasional flashes of brilliance when something truly powerful happens between the characters -- like when Ben's daughter was shot, or when Kate and Sawyer finally did the dirty in the bear cage. I'm less appreciative of the Rubik's Cube nature of the story, of it being some type of puzzle to be solved. To enjoy a puzzle, one needs faith in the creators that there eventually will be a payoff, that things will make sense, that there is a master plan. I'm not all that convinced that a master plan exists in this show, or if one does, that it makes a whole hell of a lot of sense.

Two things particularly irk me about this show:

The first is the non-chronological nature of the storytelling. The show is loaded with flashbacks and flashforwards -- this on top of a story with time travel -- which interrupt the telling of the story. The story has become so confusing that they frequently have to have retrospective episodes where a narrator rehashes the events of the past season -- in a more or less chronological fashion -- just so you're not as lost as the characters. The plotting of LOST looks like a train track assembled by a dyslexic meth addict.

Worse, the flashbacks are sometimes dropped in like Band-Aids whenever the writers need to give a character a motivation. For example, in Wednesday's episode, the writers needed to explain Juliette's inexplicable change of heart about whether to support Jack in his plan to detonate an H-bomb. So, out of nowhere, they show a flashback of her as a girl, learning that her parents are getting a divorce. Her parents said something like, ""Even if you love each other, it doesn't mean you're supposed to be together."" This memory of hers is then used to contrive her motivation for helping Jack, because she's suddenly decided she's not supposed to be together with Sawyer, and she repeats that line to Sawyer.

The second thing that bugs me, as you've probably guessed, is the characters' frequent and unexplained changes of motivation. In that same scene where Juliette's support for Jack has suddenly changed, Kate's has also -- for no reason that I can tell other than that she's going along with the pack. Why, for instance, did Ben save Locke from suicide and then suddenly turn around and strangle him? In a subsequent episode, he vaguely gave a reason for this, but it didn't entirely make sense (nor could I have believed him if he did make sense because he's been well established as a compulsive liar). Jack is the worst character for motivations that shift in the wind. In the early seasons, getting off the island was all he wanted, and then later he's a drunken fool going around to his friends, yelling, ""We have to go back!"" -- a motivation supposedly brought about just because he's learned Locke has died. And then, once they're back on the island, he starts telling people, ""We don't belong here!""

Well, thank God for the people at the Shocklines message board, who have insightfully theorized about some of the larger things of the show. The current theory is that Jacob and the other dude are two Egyptian gods who are using the islanders as pawns in their machinations against each other. One of them apparently has the ability to shape-shift -- perhaps into the Smoke Monster -- which, if true, explains a lot of things in retrospect. . . . But I ask you, is it right to wait so many seasons for anything to have a shred of sense?

God, why am I watching this show?

And . . . when does the next season begin? I need to mark my calendar.",1377734400,,3583,4.5875
3439629,3,B0019LY5IM,"LOST has good production values and easy on the eyes.

3439635,4,B0019LY5IM,"*Note: This review may contain spoilers.*

The storyline begins to get muddled. Up until season three, we were learning about the characters' pasts and such, and after season 3, it makes sense that the show flashes forward to the characters' futures or whatever. But it's unclear whether the scenes are actually true - I mean, it makes you think: do they get off the island, do they just die and imagine they got off the island when they actually never did, or have they been dead since season one and the island was always a kind of purgatory?

Anyway, if I were to re-watch this series, I'd not re-watch the last few seasons. There are too many questions that inevitably go unanswered. The longer the show goes, the more open it is to individual interpretations. There are too many possible answers for very few questions.

I only recommend to fans of the series.",1376611200,,865,4.640522875816994

3439668,4,B0019LY5IM,I did not watch Lost when it was on TV and have bought each season.  Good show and would recommend the series if you have not seen it.,1374451200,,134,3.7857142857142856
3439669,5,B0019LY5IM,"I own all six seasons of this show and I watch it at least once a year straight through. Fringe was very good, Invasion was fun, Harsh Realm was surprising, Xfiles was terrific, but LOST is the creme de la creme of religion/supernatural/evil versus good/ and fantasy all rolled in to one FABULOUS addictive show with UNFORGETTABLE acting. ""John Locke, Substitute.""  ""I've got your back.""  ""Dude..."" every word said in the most memorable way. Now I watch Person of Interest. Also a great show with some Lost actors (including the great Benjamin Linus).",1373932800,,551,4.913978494623656

3439671,5,B0019LY5IM,"Hands down...LOST is my favorite show EVER!  I know there were some haters, especially around seasons 2 and 3, but if you stay true and hang through the whole season, the symbolism is really mezmorizing.  Seriously...greatest show in the history of time!!",1373587200,,255,5.0476190476190474

3439674,5,B0019LY5IM,"LOST is one of my all time favorite TV shows. Most people were disappointed with the turn the series took after the writer's strike, but I felt it kept a strong connection to its roots and in true LOST fashion, always left you wondering.",1373068800,,237,4.409090909090909

3439681,4,B0019LY5IM,"I am so into the characters and story that a little repetitive boring hurrying back and forth in the woods did not deter me.

3439682,4,B0019LY5IM,More movement than in some of the other seasons and provides some more answers.  A little too much with the time jumps (contrived) and too much time spent on some of the characters without clear plot connections (maybe it's just me).  Somewhat hard to follow if you don't check in every couple of days (must be why several episodes are provided just to keep you up to speed).,1371081600,,375,4.5

3439708,4,B0019LY5IM,"Ive been reviewing Lost season by season on Dvd , an must say it still  has me looking forward to the next episode , even though I seen them on tv as they aired. I must say season 1-3 , were the best , though seasons 4-5 were almost as good if not better . Its nice to watch theses shows again after 3 years , even though Im hooked on Breaking Bad  now ! If you don't own the sets , you can stream them nowdays on Amazon etc. Im just mid-way tthough season 5 an its nice to watch without those darn comercals in between . Hit play all an sit back .

3439710,4,B0019LY5IM,This season was fun but it did drag its feet. It felt like they could have condensed the season down to 8-9 episodes and finished the series with the remaining few. Too much time spent in the past. Wasn't a fan of that. But I did love the ending. Great acting done by Josh and Elizabeth.,1369958400,,287,4.142857142857143
3439711,4,B0019LY5IM,"I thought this was an interesting show.  I spent a lot of time being lost, like the characters.  The show skips around in time a lot, and so do the characters, making it somewhat confusing at times.  But this keeps it interesting to me.  But then, I like science fiction and some fantasy books.

The characters are pretty interesting, and I never got bored.  Thanks to Amazon Prime, I watched the series straight through within about a month or two.",1368921600,,449,4.55
3439712,4,B0019LY5IM,"Lost: The Complete Fifth Season takes us back and forth through time and confounds viewers/fans with alternate, possible realities and time-travel. The first several episodes of this season lack any depth and don't build up much of a story, but this season gets interesting in the middle and towards the end when all the time-travel scenes finally stop and the Oceanic survivors who are stuck in the 1970s detonate a bomb in The Swan station/Hatch. This season was not as great as seasons 1-3, but season 5 is definitely better than seasons 4 and 6.",1368835200,,549,4.7894736842105265

3439730,5,B0019LY5IM,Lost is amazing. This was a favorite season. Definitely one to be seen. Don't let the title discourage! It's a cliffhanger ever episode. And you do have to watch all the seasons. Just to clear that up.,1367107200,,201,4.45945945945946

3439732,5,B0019LY5IM,Lost keeps you on the verge of your seat. The show has twists and turns that keep you guessing. Lost has a great method of adding new characters and making you love or hate them in one episode. Truly great entertainment.,1367107200,,220,4.390243902439025

It gets a bit convoluted towards the end of the series and obscure, but all of its strengths as a series outweigh the weaknesses.  It will make you laugh, cry, and angry.

3439822,4,B0019LY5IM,"Season 5 is a mix between showing what the survivors on the island experienced and how the survivors who returned to America plot their return to the island. More than the others, this season jumps around quite a bit. Some episodes focus on the six in America, then later we get to see what other characters were up to during that time. In fact, I felt like much of season 5 consisted of filling in gaps. Things are even more confusing because there's a lot of time travel in this season. It generally works, but often it means that we don't actually get to see the characters develop over time, just the end results.

I really enjoyed seeing how the characters stuck behind on the island grow and adapt to their circumstances. Sawyer and Juliet reach new stages in their character development. Sawyer joins the Dharma Initiative and takes on some responsibility. It's nice to see consequential changes.

Unfortunately, Jack and Kate are up their usual selves, rushing off to action without thinking. I'm glad Sawyer called Jack out on it. I wish their characters showed greater maturity and depth. Jack's character seems really inconsistent. In season 5, he seems intent on abandoning responsibility, almost as if the story writers thought they needed to shake the character up.

The peripheral characters, such as Dan and Miles, each get their own episodes and flashbacks. Unlike some of the earlier attempts to introduce new characters into the show, I think the show has absorbed these two pretty well.

Oh, and why do these people still trust Ben? Why hasn't somebody killed that lying jerk by now? One of the highlights of this season for me was Sun knocking Ben out saying that she didn't trust him.

For a while, I was getting sick of how the show tries to keep the mystery by never allowing the characters to explain their motivations. It always seemed that there was ""no time"" for a proper explanation. Fortunately, by the end of this season, we finally get a bit of an explanation that ties things from the various seasons together. It's not a full revelation, but at least there's an endgame in sight.",1360540800,,2113,4.746594005449591

The story is picking up speed, revealing a lot more pieces of the puzzle, and putting a lot of those pieces into place. There are so many pieces now, though, that the story is very complex, on a par with ""Twin Peaks"", so it does not lend itself to casual viewing. In fact, as I watched I felt as though I should be taking notes. I never did, but I paid very close attention. The science fiction elements are front and center in this season, and a lot of fun. The characters also have a lot to do and a lot of difficult choices to make, so it's great to watch them. I'm very glad I did not give up on this show when it looked like it was going downhill in Season 3. If you enjoyed Seasons 1 and 4, then you should also enjoy Season 5.

It made an interesting show confusing with some time travel flashes taking place a minute apart. There were also less episodes in the later seasons, again, I believe due to the stike.

3439903,5,B0019LY5IM,"First let me say that this is a review of the entire series and not just the season. I will post this under every season so that everyone can see this review.  Now, in my opinion Lost is one of those once in a lifetime shows that will never come around again. Lost has a beginning and an ending, but to fully enjoy Lost you need to own and watch all of the seasons sequentially. They are all great seasons. While I do like some seasons better than others, I find them all an intricate piece of the overall puzzle that is Lost. In order my choices for seasons are:

Season 1
Season 2
Season 3
Season 5
Season 6
Season 4  I believe the writers strike really messed this season up.

*****Spoiler Alert *******

Lost is a story about a group of people who crash land on an island. They soon discover this is not just any island, there are ""Others"" living on the island. There are various life forms living there that should not be able to live there such as a smoke monster(explained in season six), a huge polar bear etc. The island has certain properties as well, such as women who become pregnant do not live to full term, there are also hatches on the island from a former group called ""The Dharma Initiative."" These inhabitants were killed off by ""The leader of The Others."" (Explained in season 3) When it becomes apparent that rescue is not coming to the survivors thing really start to heat up on the island. Eventually some of the survivors do manage to get off of the island (season 5) during which time the rest end up back in time (yes the island can move through time)and find a way to work in the Dharma Initiative. When those who had been off the island find a way back, all hell breaks loose. I won't tell you how it ends for a number of reasons, but I will say that I was very happy and disappointed in the ending. The ending had answered most of my questions satisfactorily only to leave me feeling a bit empty about the whole series.

*****End Spoiler Alert******
If you want to be hooked on a great series buy the whole series and enjoy. I personally could not watch each episode fast enough once I started. I found every excuse to watch show after show. I cannot remember the last time I had felt this way about a TV show. I only wish there had been more of Lost to watch.

3439905,5,B0019LY5IM,"With Season 5 of Lost, I am now REALLY glad that I waited until after the show ended to go back and watch it. Because I've watched the series so close together, the little nuances and questions that have been unanswered for a couple of seasons are now finally being tied together (although there's still plenty unanswered going into Season 6).

This season deals with time travel, which can get confusing to some people so be ready to pay extra close attention to the little stuff to get the full effect of it. Despite several people having told me that season 5 was not up to par when they saw it on TV, I think the show is as strong as ever with this season and am looking forward to starting season 6.",1282780800,,704,4.293233082706767

There weren't that many commentaries (Battlestar Galactica has a commentary for nearly every episode). If you like LOST, there's no reason you won't enjoy owning season 5. My only real complaint is the price. It's the same price as the other seasons, but there are only 16 episodes (compared to the usual 24). The producers and network decided to make 16, which is fine, but don't charge me the same amount for less product.",1278979200,,542,4.71578947368421

3439921,5,B0019LY5IM,"First off,this is a review for the Lost season 5 COLLECTOR'S EDITION. I stress that so much because no one else has written a review for THIS collector's edition. So,this edition does have a slipcover,unlike the mass-market edition. It's not a transparent plastic like seasons past,but it is really cool thick paper with holographic images and a back pocket for the bonus disc and Dharna luggage tag (cool promo item!!). The slipcover slides off to reveal the a copy of the mass-market package,BUT with a holographic sheen and is actually a slipcover for a foldout package ala' Lost dvds of seasons past. The mass-market edition packaging was said to have cheap,plastic cases for the dvds and WAS NOT up to par with past editions. I assure all, this edition is top notch and the spine lines up perfectly with seasons 1-4. I've read this was a major sticking point with hardcore fans. This will make up for that snafu,and is worth the 45$ price point. Hopefully,Amazon will post this review with the collector's edition and convince other consumers to grab this edition IF they ever see one for sale.",1271635200,,1099,4.8201058201058204

3439926,4,B0019LY5IM,"Many mysteries are revealed during the fifth season of Lost, one of the most entertaining seasons yet.  All the main characters are back.  Jack, with the help of Ben, tries to persuade the rest of the Oceanic Six to return to the island.  Meanwhile, Sawyer creates a new life for himself as a DHARMA security man in the 70s.  Two episodes stand out as my favorites here: ""316"" is the journey back to the island, and ""The Life and Death of Jeremy Bentham"" explains just what happened to Locke when he left the island, including how he died.  Time travel is the major theme of this season, and certain episodes require multiple viewings to fully understand.  But in typical Lost fashion, those who pay attention to details are rewarded.  Season 5 ends on a great note with ""The Incident"", which could possible change the fate of Jack, Kate, Sawyer, and all the other characters on the island.  This is must-see TV!

As great as the Season 5 content is, I have several problems with the actual DVD package.  First of all, for those who own Seasons 1-4, you will notice a big difference in the box this time around.  Not a huge problem, but the inconsistent package looks weird sitting on a shelf next to the first four seasons.  Secondly, there is no booklet included with the episode summaries.  As a substitute, the episode titles are printed on the inside of the DVD case.  Perhaps the DHARMA Orientation Kit version is the better (although more expensive) way to go&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lost-The-Complete-Fifth-Season-Dharma-Initiative-Orientation-Kit/dp/B0027CSPOC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lost: The Complete Fifth Season Dharma Initiative Orientation Kit</a>.  Bonus features also seem to be a bit light this time around.

In conclusion, the extras and packaging of Season 5 is a bit disappointing.  But that cannot overshadow the fact that Lost is still going strong after five seasons, and Season 5 is a worthy entry into the Lost universe.",1269475200,,2001,5.183800623052959

3439936,5,B0019LY5IM,"In more ways than one, Lost Season 5 is the best season of one of the greatest shows ever to air on television. It had all the elements that have come to define the show, and make it one of the most enjoyable experiences ever to hit TV. It had great character development, it had great mythology, it had great moments, it was original, and it had a superb story. And let me start off by saying that I'm a time-travel geek. I lay awake at night in fear of time paradoxes and my life being erased. I've also seen most major & obscure takes on the subject, so I followed and understood the whole season with the information that was given. I can see how somebody would get lost easily, but I understood it perfectly, and that's just because of my geekiness. Your experience with Season 5 may vary.

Highlight Episodes:
The Life and Death of Jeremy Bentham
LaFleur
Namaste
Dead Is Dead
The Incident

First off, the characters. Ever since Season 1, Lost has struggled with bringing new emotions, and stories that seem like they fit with the character, and not for any cheap or uninteresting side-note or plot device; that is if they even move the characters along. In Season 5, this is not the case, every character matures in a totally different way than we've seen before, and it does them justice. This is especially the case with Sawyer, who after 5 Seasons has finally granted my wish of wanting to see him in a leadership role. But he's no leader like any we've seen on the show before, and he's certainly no Jack. He's still the cool, nickname guy we knew before, but this is a Sawyer that uses his brain for somebody other than himself, and he just does it in some have called a ""Winston Churchill"" type manner. And this description would suit him well. We finally found a stable relationship for Sawyer, and for a long while there, he was one of the few characters on the show that had found some sense of happiness. Jack, Kate, Hurley, Sayid & Sun also progressed well from off-island life to island life, giving each of the characters a real reason to return that again suited their characters well. Heck, even Kate or Jack didn't seem annoying for a while there. Then of course, we saw Miles & Faraday grow into their roles on the show, as they became not only essential to the story, but they found a way into our likability circle. Sure, they may have came late, but especially in the case of Miles now, he fits right in.

Story-wise, the season does start off a bit slow do to the whole 'We're Getting The Band Back Together' storyline. Sure it was essential, but it felt like it could have been condensed a bit. But that only lasts for a few episodes, and they're usually inter-spliced with the time-travel story (More on Time-travel later). But once everybody got onto the island, it just rocketed down the path of no return with each episode being slammed-packed with great moments & stuff we've never seen before. Keeping the show on the island, but moving it mostly to the 70s was a great change of pace for the season, and it was fun living in the Dharma world for a little bit, getting to know the characters, events & the company that shaped the island so much, even though we wished Radzinsky had bit the bullet early from the moment he started opening his mouth. But overall, I couldn't have been much more satisfied with the arch the season took, and it did a nice job of setting up the final season.

As for the time-travel, I was stunned how the show took it in such an amazing/original direction. I mean, the whole island moves in time, stays in one spot for a while, then takes the castaways to another time period. And some of the stops are pretty amazing. We get to see the island in the 50s, the future, the 80s, and other various unknown points, and what the castaways usually found in these periods was just so fun for any Lost fan. I mean, the moment where the island skips in time, and a rope once dangling from a well was just sticking out of the ground since the well hadn't been built yet. So awesome. But that's not all folks, they presented time travel theories, created the time-loop timeline, and dived deep into the question of 'Can you change the past, or is what done is done? If you try to change the past, do you just eventually set it on its present course?' These are deep questions, and it was just so fun to watch Lost tread ground that most other media hasn't even touched on, much less delved into.

Overall, time will tell its true placement in the series' hierarchy, but for me, it was one of the most fun and satisfying experiences watching TV in my lifetime. Sure, it's not for everybody, and it is hard to get a grip on it, but for those that can (and it certainly helps to watch all the episodes in a short span of time), then you might be half as keen to love it as I do. And what about those last 30 seconds? One of the best cliffhangers in TV history, especially if you have the chance to pop in the next episode right afterwards? I say yes.",1267401600,,5000,4.377825618945102
3439937,5,B0019LY5IM,"It's difficult to gauge how each season of 'Lost' compares to other seasons in this landmark  series simply because revisiting past years does not offer the same initial excitement it once did upon first viewing.  To elaborate, the enjoyment of each season of 'Lost' hinges on the intriguing mysteries of the island and its inhabitants being slowly and artfully revealed piece by piece through a nuanced and creative storytelling.  Subsequently, once the mystery is revealed to us, it is difficult to review past episodes and attempt to judge it on its artistic merits simply because it no longer holds the same tight spell of suspense over us as it once did when we did not know what to expect.  Thus, an audience must usually rely not on a reviewing of the episodes but a personal recall of the initial impressions the episodes made to even attempt a judgment of each season.

But putting that wordy preamble aside, how does 'Season 5' stack up with the 'Lost' library?  From a storytelling continuity standpoint, the series continues to deliver high-adrenaline arcs that will keep audiences on their toes.  Although Season 1 and 2 can still be considered as having a special place in the 'Lost' library simply because they pioneered so many of the initial suspense and mysteries that we now take for granted as questions answered [What is the Dharma Initiative?  Who are the Others?  Is there a world outside of the island, or is it purgatory?] one still must admit that the storytelling, if not Season 1 then definitely Season 2, had some lulls.  Season 3 and 4, while perhaps not raising mysteries as significant as the origins of the Dharma Initiative or the temporal existence of the island, still does a consistent and pleasant job of presenting new mysteries to the island [Who is Jacob?  What is the island's purpose?  What is Locke and Jack's destiny?]  Also of note, after the creators of the series announced in the middle of Season 3 that the series will definitely end after six seasons, there has been no lulls in storytelling.  The series has moved in a frenetic pace ever since, and the audience never feels as if the writers are stalling or attempting to stretch out a thin storyline for the same of a standard 22-episode television format.  The story is being told as the writers mean to tell it, with no artistic failing or studio pressure to deform an otherwise great vision.  It's television magic that we are experiencing.

From a character standpoint, the series has definitely gone down a clip through no fault of its own.  One of the most arresting aspects of the series, the character flashbacks that help flesh out present events by informing the audience of a character's past, are gone.  However, their absence are a necessity simply because there are no more backstories to tell-- we know the characters, and now the story that must be resolved is their relationship to the island.

However, for all of us who enjoyed immensely this dual-layered approach to storytelling, thankfully the creators have found a clever way to keep us moving through time.  Two storylines are occurring simultaneously in two distinct time periods, one in the present day and one during the height of the 1977 Dharma Initiative, and they both have consequences and results on one another.  As a result, the storytelling in 'Lost' still has a dual-layer of complexity, sine each storyline from different eras continue to remain relevant to each other.

Sorry to wrap this short, but I'm sleepy.  Great season, crucial to any 'Lost' fan, and not disappointing in the least bit.  Prepare for fourteen hours of television viewing!",1267315200,,3636,4.873170731707317

The show started getting sloppy (not to say it didn't have its moments, just not as consistently high in quality), but I thought that the production team had surprised me before and maybe there was a method to the madness---but then Season 5.
Lapsing into tired Science Fiction cliches and temples in the jungle that could have been pulled out of old Tarzan movies just didn't cut it for me.

This box set is in a cardboard casing that slides out from the side, and has thrown of the entire look of my lost collection.

One of the things I like about Season Five is the development of the Sawyer character.  He is a truly multidimensional personality whom I did not like at all in Season One but who now is perhaps my favorite male character in the series.

One thing I was not crazy about in Season Five is the use of time travel, which is overused in science fiction and which makes its appearance here.  I will give the series credit, however; this is one of the more innovative uses of this device.

Twists, turns, mysteries, answers, questions, repeat. The island is almost a living entity, with many confusing, interesting, and unusual features. The characters are well developed, with their stories being told in the form of flashbacks and flash-forwards. The story line takes place very slowly, moving along similar in pace to a soap opera. Even with this pace there is plenty going on to keep your attention with island history and character back stories being woven together to form engaging scenes.

Season five has finally broken that trend. New questions have been raised, but a lot of questions were answered and you feel like you are finally getting somewhere.

My family has been hooked on ""Lost,"" ever since we discovered the fun of the series when I purchased Season 1 late in 2006.  Even though we have watched most of the shows on television when they were aired ever since, we have still looked forward to the clean, fresh DVD's (commercial free!) to tell the story even better.

Season 5 doesn't disappoint at all, as far as the story line goes.  In some ways, it is the most unpredictable and the most imaginative of all.  And some of those questions that have been nagging us start to get answered.  And despite what the writers may say, I STILL think that they are ALL in purgatory.

However, there are a few things that cause me to lower my rating of this particular purchase.  First, the number of episodes in an otherwise-full season is disappointing.  I feel a little cheated that it stops at 16 (or 17, depending on how you count).  But that's the way it is.

The packaging leaves much to be desired.  First, there is absolutely nothing, in terms of an episode guide in the box ... only numbers and titles.  But most of all, WHY oh WHY did they change the package?  Now I have 4 seasons that match, and a 5th one that does not.  Makes me think that the producers know that there are those of us who are so obsessive that the fail-to-match boxes will lead us to go back out and buy the entire series again, when it is produced in one box after the final season!!

3439971,5,B0019LY5IM,"Lost has always hinted at time travel, but in season 5 the show's creators finally decided to stop tiptoeing around the issue and tackle it head on.  The new tagline for the series became ""When are we?"" and viewers were asked to wrap their collective heads around concepts such as skewed time lines in which the characthers' futures became their pasts, or the idea that the past can't be changed.  But all of the headache inducing (for the characthers as well as the viewers) time travel only served to enhance the drama and make the series more intriguing as it began setting the table for its final season.

Season 5 picks up where season 4 ended:  the island has disappeared after Ben turned the magic donkey wheel.  Meanwhile it was revelaed that Locke had made it off the island only to end up committing suicide; but not before trying to convince the Oceanic 6 to return and fulfill their destinites.

We quickly learn that the fate of those who remained on the island.  After Ben's departure, the island started moving through time.  Daniel Farraday likens the movement to a record skpping, a connection that devoted fans will immediately draw to the series' ongoing motiff of records and turntables.  As the Losties travel through time, they begin to experience some undesired side effects which include headaches and bloody noses.  Why is the island moving?  What will stop it?  Why are the survivors suffering the strange effects?  Don't worry, some answers are provided.

Meanwhile, the Oceanic Six struggle to return to the island with the help of Ben and Eloise Hawking, a coming war is hinted at, we learn how Locke left the island, Jin is found to still be alive, the losties end up as members of the Dharma Initiative and we finally meet Jacob in the season finale.

A lot happens in season 5, and trying to summarize it is almost impossible.  But what keeps the show from spinning completely off its axis and becoming an inaccessible mess is the human element.  The characters are so vividly drawn that we have a strong vested interest in what happens to them.  Especially engrossing is Sawyer's storyline.  This is the season when his development from a hot-headed, selfish and angry loner to an actual human being with deep feelings and a sense of purpose was completed.  Believe it or not, he is the human heart of season 5.

The finale provides a a rather large plot twist and puts everything in place for the final season.  Who knows how it's all going to end and what everything means, but I'm on board to the very end, no matter what that end may be.",1262908800,,2574,4.660753880266076
3439972,5,B0019LY5IM,"I love the 'Lost' series.  I have seen every episode of every season and can't wait for the new season to start this year.  The ending of Season 5 was an awesome cliffhanger that blew me away.  I'm sad that next season is the last.  Season 5 had many layers to its plot but the main one was that they went back to the island.  Throughout the different episodes the action switched back and forth through time and made the whole show that much better.  It was a little difficult to keep up with at times but that was just part of the drama.  I highly recommend this season of 'Lost'.

For those who have never seen 'Lost' it a lot more understandable if you watch the seasons in order.  You can buy them here on Amazon.com new or used.",1262822400,,734,4.185714285714286

3439974,5,B0019LY5IM,"I am so glad I have not given up on this show, and there was a point in Season 3 early on, when I (like many) thought about abandoning it.  But then Season 4 restored my faith, and season 5 was brilliant.  I have complete faith in JJ/Carlton/Damon to finish this show off right, and of course, I'm sad about it, but the finality of this means that the shows are going to be fast-paced I'm sure.

The acting on this drama is criminally underrated, and although Michael Emerson won the emmy last time for supporting actor for Ben, I wish the show would get more acclaim.  I know the academy or whoever judges the Emmy's prefers their Mad Men and any show that is 3 years past its prime, but I pray that this show gets the recognition it deserves for the last 2 seasons and the final one.

I am a huge fan of bonus features and was actually disappointed. Compared to some other shows on DVD, there is a fair amount of features but compared to other seasons of LOST, this is kind of weak.

First, there are only two episode commentaries and the bonus features are on the same disc as the season finale. In comparison, season 4 had four episode commentaries and 2 discs full of bonus features. And season 4 had 2 less episodes!!!",1262822400,,612,4.321739130434783

3439979,3,B0019LY5IM,"I'm as big a Lost fan as any, and I don't want to discourage other Lost fans from buying this DVD box set. Simply put, if you love Lost, then the season 5 DVD is a must-buy. The show itself definitely deserves 5 stars.

However, I feel I need to point out a few flaws here with this box set that weren't present in the other box sets (hence my 3-star review). First off and most noticeable, the packaging does not conform to the packaging set forth by the first four season DVDs of the show. Rather than the clear plastic slipcase that loads from the top, here you get a cardboard box that loads from the side. Also, as I think a few others might have noticed, the snaps in the trays seem to be somewhat faulty, as mine had three or four of the prongs snapped off when I first opened the box set, letting my disk 5 slide around freely.

Another big disappointment is the fact that this box set is only 5 disks, even though it's no shorter than season 4, which had 6 disks. And two of season 4's disks were devoted to bonus features, while only one season 5 disk has bonus features, and they're sharing space with the final episode of the season. While all the standbys are there (Lost on location, deleted scenes), there certainly aren't as many special features here as Lost fans have grown accustomed to. It is a bit skimpy in that regard.

Also, though it might not be a major issue with many people, this season 5 box set seems to have significantly fewer easter eggs hidden within than the previous seasons did. While I found at least 16 hidden easter eggs tucked away on season 4's two bonus disks, I've only managed to find 4 on season 5. And believe me when I say I've searched thoroughly.

All this said, absolutely none of these things are a deal breaker, and if you're a Lost fan, you MUST get this DVD. But I thought that you Lost devotees out there deserved a fair warning; prepared to be a little disappointed with the features, especially compared to what we've gotten the past few years.",1262217600,2,2003,4.333333333333333

3439983,4,B0019LY5IM,"If you are considering buying the dvds for season five, know that this is some of what you will receive:

3 discs with 4 episodes, 1 disc with 3 episodes and 1 disc of bonus features

a high quality picture on the blue ray version

packaging that is comparable to any other dvd sets, but very different from previous seasonal sets of Lost.

A ""season play"" feature that will let you play a dvd continuously, and, will remember where you left off if you substitute another disc.

Bottom line:  what you really get if you purchase this set of DVDs is a diappointingly brief set of bonus features - given the shortened season - and, a surprisingly illuminating 28 minute (or so) spoof on an ""In search of...."" style documentary on the Dharma Initiative.  If you are old enough to remember Leonard Nimoy's voiceover - complete with sensationalized tone and spooky, otherworldly suggestive music - then you will have a handle on the kind of thing they are trying to do here.

They did a fine job of creating a 70's investivigative tv show; it is quite realistic.  Its benefit however, is not its artistic rendition but what it offers in terms of providing a few more nuggets about Dharma, Hanso, and selected other characters.  Surprisingly, the episode seems to know nothing of the mystique of the island - something that would be ripe for this species of show - but instead focuses on strange disappearances of people and odd alliances of institutions on the ""mainland"".  Although that genre of tv show tended to tantalize with more questions than answers, this version - nonetheless - does provide viewers with a few pieces of the Lost puzzle that they might not otherwise have.

In sum, I don't care about the packaging issues previously named.  I do wish there was something more given that the set was the same price as before with less shows.  But as a Lost junkie who wants the shows, what's a fan to do?",1261958400,,1907,4.620178041543027

3439985,5,B0019LY5IM,"I have viewed all (thus far) 103 episodes of Lost on DVD; I couldn't even tell you which day or timeslot the series runs on ABC. As far as building an immediate sense of memory, momentum, and continuity the DVD experience cannot be beaten. On the other hand, I can see an advantage in watching the weekly program in that there is a developing community feedback in the form of the intermediate office water cooler and/or internet chat rooms discussions with other viewers. However, by the time the DVD comes out (months later), most of the discussion has been honed to more realistic analysis of what the writers have actually created. Still, there's nothing wrong with discussions of inevitably incorrect conclusions about where the storylines are going. It's all grist for the mill and ultimately good exercise for the noggin.

Personally speaking though, I have to admit that having one weekend a year to yourself where you can hunker down in solitude and do the entire Lost season in two days in an all-out video blitz is one of the finer joys in my life, not the first mind you--but up there in rank!

It's good to control the flow with the freedom to stop and rewind (to use an old VHS term) a scene and recount the action or dialogue, or pause and go do something else for a few minutes (you'll have to if you're on a seven hour viewing jag)!

Thus, the DVD gives one time and freedom; the broadcast better gives one a sense of community. I guess there's room for both. For those who choose my method I recommend Wikipedia's various articles on the series; however, beware of spoiliers, or just read them after viewing. Also, an advantage of the DVD, Blueray eitions is that you can always sell them on Amazon and recoup your payment to buy the next season.

Finally, Season 5 was great. Many of the threads of the various storylines are coming together. If you haven't seen seasons 1 through 4 however, I highly recommend you go back and view them in sequence or you will be cheating yourself of one of the best sci-fi mind expanding experiences possible.",1261699200,2,2063,4.5978260869565215
3439986,4,B0019LY5IM,"I am of the opinion that LOST is the best show on television, and season five does not disappoint. The show over the past couple of seasons had been revealing itself as the sci-fi/fantasy show that it is and here in season five we deal with time travel. Doesn't get much more sci-fi than that.

There are a lot of twists along the way and there were episodes that I marveled at how the writers manage to bring so many elements together so perfectly and satisfyingly. They've always been good at this but the fact that they maintained it with the addition of time travel is a bit of a miracle. I also applaud them for bringing themes back that they set up early on in season one at the end of this season. In fact, there's lots of things from the past couple of seasons that are answered at the end of this season. If the writers didn't have a plan for this series from the beginning, they've done a hell of a job tying it together.

If there is a slight failing of season five, its that the show was somewhat less character centered than the previous seasons. A lot of this is due to the change in storytelling in season five. Gone are the character-centric flashbacks/flashforwards. When the show flashes, it's flashing back/forward in time. Still, some characters like Locke and especially Sawyer are given a lot to do and have interesting arcs this season. But for the most part, a lot of the old favorites are in a holding pattern. For example, what does Sun do in this season? Jack in particular is passive and almost unlikable for most of the season. There's also a fair bit of story/character motivations that hang on Jack and Sawyer being in love with Kate, and that didn't work for me. It seemed a bit lazy and unearned. The good news is that the dudes behind the show, Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse, have been saying in interviews that season six is going to be a lot like season one (whatever the hell that really means) and very character centric. I hope they're true to their word.

I'll end by saying the finale aired seven months ago, and my mind is still blown. I have no idea where it goes from here, and I think that's great. How many shows are this unpredictable after five seasons? I cant think of one. I'm excited for season six, but I am going to mourn the end of this show for a long time. In this world of American Idol and Dancing With The Stars that we live in, it's not very likely that we'll ever get anything as good as LOST for quite some time.

3439987,3,B0019LY5IM,What has happened to the Blu-Ray releases of Lost? When Season 3 first came out on Blu-Ray it came in a great box. Inside the box was the actual plastic case that held the discs. Inside of the case was a insert that told the name of the episodes and which disc they were on. As a matter of fact every release of Lost either on DVD or Blu-Ray has had the inserts in them. Well guess what Season 5 has. It has 2 inserts of which both are advertisements. Why not have a insert with the episode listings? I paid $60 for this and it is just a bare bones version. The show is great. But this regular Blu-Ray version sucks.,1261526400,2,616,4.057377049180328
3439988,4,B0019LY5IM,"I am, like many others, hooked on this series and was really psyched to get this set when it came out. I'd never seen any of the episodes before, and I found the story in season 5 to be interesting enough. However, I found that the sound was screwy. I have a young child who sleeps close to where I watch movies and I have to turn the tv way down so she won't wake up. Sometimes, this works. But mostly, I find that I have to fiddle with the volume on my remote constantly. It is such a pain in the rear to have to constantly dial down and up to keep up with the impossibly quiet moments and the crazy-loud moments. sheesh.

The packaging is different this season than the previous four. Gone is the plastic slipcover and pamphlet inserts, and in place is a sleek case with the episode list written on the back. So much neater and less wasteful.",1261440000,,845,4.184049079754601

I know that some people get frustrated by the flash-backs/forwards and by jumping in time; but I didn't find the show to be confusing.  Unless people have difficulties staying focused and watching every episode, everything will make sense and won't be confusing.

I was only disappointed because this season (just like Season 4) was too short for me.  It felt like some things were rushed.

I would love to have another episode about Sawyer and Juliet in 1977.  Also, I would enjoy one more episode with Faraday.  Also, it felt like things started to get crazy too quickly when Kate, Jack, Hurley and Sayid reunited with Sawyer, Juliette, Miles and Faraday - Nevertheless, it makes sense that Sawyer and Juliette's time was destroyed so quickly, because they were not meant to stay in 1977 forever.",1261180800,,909,4.819354838709677

They are so watchable - you can't stop till you've seen every episode - then when you finish, after the surprise ending - you'll want to go back and rewatch the entire season again.

I had already seen this season twice on DVR, finished the third time on Blu-Ray, and am watching it again- that goes to show just how brilliant and captivating this show is.

There were many big risks in season 5 but all of them payed off beautifully and fans of the show will literally be blown away by season 5 - I've seen all five amazing seasons but this is the best yet!",1260835200,,658,4.2063492063492065
3439993,5,B0019LY5IM,"I remember thinking that season 1 of Lost was the most interesting, most entertaining and most innovative single season of television I had ever watched. While it still ranks at the very top of my list, I have to say that season 5 of Lost (particularly after a second viewing) at least approaches a similar level of overall viewing satisfaction. Mystery of the island aside, this show is really about the characters. And after this watching this season, I feel that things have really fell into place in regard to the character development. After five seasons, you have a pretty good sense of who these characters are, you feel like you've known them for a while. So when Sawyer enter's his ""happy"" stage this season, you really feel good for the guy. You laugh at Hurley because you know who he is by now. You empathize with Locke as he tries to figure out and/or deal with how and why he is so special. You understand Sayid's pain and (IMO loneliness) because of his background. And of course, you second guess and question the motives behind anything that Ben does. The story in season 5 uses everything you know and feel about these characters and begins to set up for the final conclusion. Lost is an excellent show. In the end, it may be the defining television show of this era.

The only negative things I can say about Lost (and they are minor) are 1) by now, the Dharma Iniitiave has lost nearly all of its mysteriousness and 2) there appear to be some contradictions as to how difficult it is to get back and forth from the island.",1260748800,2,1542,4.507142857142857

  If you are going to watch Season 5, you will have to watch the other 4 seasons beforehand.  Or you too will be LOST!!  This is an ongoing and continuous story.

3440001,4,B0019LY5IM,"It may seem weird that so many of the recent reviews are all about the packaging for the Season 5 DVD but once you buy it, you'll understand.  The first 4 seasons had a cool, sturdy plastic cover and the actual DVDs were in a foldout box that slipped out from under the cover (not sure if that makes sense LOL).  Very classy and the 4 seasons look really cool side by side on your DVD rack, but Season 5 is this cheap lame cardboard cover with the DVD foldout box coming out from the side...and instead of funky LOST inserts like a Dharma Manual, there are just some flimsy paper advertisements for other Buena Vista/ABC DVDs.  Feels like it could fall apart any second. It may not seem like that big a deal but why change the packaging after 4 seasons of the same DVD box? Looks weird lined up next to Seasons 1-4 not just because its different material but it's also much much slimmer which is just odd since Season 4 had less episodes.  (side note...I do like how people are writing alot about the DVD packaging because that's what these kinds of reviews are really supposed to be about...chances are the reader already knows all about the show)

That being said, the actual show itself is the best its ever been.  Every episode of Season 5 is a keeper with crazy action, even more character development (you know a show is good when you're still learning more about the characters 5 seasons in) and jaw-dropping cliffhangers. Used to think the third season was LOST's best but Season 5 without a doubt is the show's best so far.

3440002,4,B0019LY5IM,"OK, People are complaining about the lack of commentaries on this set but it's really unavoidable. Commentaries on the other sets have been done mostly by the actors in the scene and they have no insight into what is behind the story of the scene in the scope of things which is what the community craves. They just make small talk and reminisce. That is because they don't want to give things away so if they gave you more commentaries it would just be more of this pointless small talk that adds nothing to the story. Do I want to listen to that kind of commentary, no! So why complain when they spare you from dealing with this ?

Unfortunately what this leads to is the conclusion that they ""may"" decide to re-release the discs with real commentary at a future date but only if they decide it's not better to let people endlessly speculate!
Patrick McGoogan only did limited talks about The Prisoner and the original series still spurs discussion. From what we can glean, he was guided by ""gut"" feel on a lot of it and he may not fully understand all the levels of it just as Bob Dylan is surprised by things that people find in his songs as he tries to make them rhyme. Sometimes there is divine inspiration coming through so it couldn't be fully explained anyway. But I digress...

1. I don't want to have anything revealed to me that would spoil my surprise as the show wraps up so I don't want significant plot points revealed in the commentary and I feel the show's creators feel the same way. After the show ends, My feelings on this subject will change but the show's creators opinion may not.
2. In light of first point, the only thing to do for people who want more commentaries is to have a whole bunch of actors on the show make small talk for each episode. Do you REALLY want to listen to all that?

So that's why it is what it is.",1260316800,,1847,4.332369942196531
3440003,5,B0019LY5IM,"Typically, I would get into depth of the series but I'll keep things simple.  The fifth season of ""LOST"" aired on January 2009 with a total of 17 episodes featured on five Blu-ray discs.  One thing I will stress is that with this season release, there is less special features than the fourth (on the disc) but the benefit are for those who own a BD-Live Profile 2.0 Blu-ray player (can connect to the Internet) with the feature ""LOST University"".  With that being said, if you own a Profile 1.1 or profile 1.0 Blu-ray player, the offering is quite slim compared to previous releases.  So, ratings are going to differ with this release.

Similar to the previous ""LOST"" Blu-ray releases, the Blu-ray's allow for ""SeasonPlay"" which allows people to watch as they go and can stop, restart where they last left off.  ""SeasonPlay"" is optional and people can select it before watching an episode.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""LOST""  is a series that looks incredible on High Definition.  Featured in 1080p High Definition (aspect ratio of 1:78:1), the detail of the island is captured quite vibrantly.  The green lush plants that surround the island, the blue skies, the blue ocean.  Personally, most of the video footage shot in Hawaii tend to be vibrant in colors and ""LOST"" is no exception.  This year's offering is much more detailed.  You can see the skin pores much more closely, even the stubble on the faces of the guys, the arm hairs, detail of crushed metal in the car accidents, Dharma buildings and just regular objects and much, much more.  There is a lot of detail that you just don't see on television and when you see it on Blu-ray, especially for ""LOST - The complete Fifth Season"", you can't help but be amazed.  The colors are just fantastic as blue oceans and blue skies are surrounded by beautiful lush greenery.  Blacks are nice and dark and skin tones are natural.

One of the things that caught my attention was just things that you never even looked at while watching on television such as jars, the appearance of rusty jars are really apparent in High Definition.  The stained blood on the skin of the characters, you can actually see that the blood is actually dry.  When comparing Seasons one through four on Blu-ray, there is an obvious difference in the picture quality and where season four looked fantastic, season five just really looks incredible.

As for the audio, ""LOST"" is featured in DTS HD-Master Audio 5.1.  The dialogue is quite clear but one thing that caught my attention is how magnificent the audio is in terms of capturing the ambiance of the island when each person is moving through the jungle.  This season tends to have used more panning and audio directional to certain speaker channels much more evident than the first season.  Also, sounds of the island, car crashing, metal crunching and even thunderstorms come quite clear through the various surround channels. Also, good use of surrounds and LFE.  Dialogue is clear and understandable and the music also comes out alive during certain scenes.

In fact, the final episode ""The Incident"", that is an episode that really takes advantage of each channel.  Hearing audio and crunching metal from the surround channels, hearing the rumble of LFE through the subwoofer and the front and center channels working in overdrive, capturing the frenzy that took place.  Great use of sound!

I love how the music for the series sounds and how it really brought an overall mood to certain scenes. The music by Michael Giacchino and the way the orchestra creates that tension for the scenes was awesome.  So, music plays a big part in the series and the music soundtrack is just wonderful!

Subtitles are featured in English SDH, French and Spanish.

After watching the season four finale of ""LOST"", I just felt that season would be hard to top.  So, along came season five and the season was very good but it was definitely a season that can easily confuse people with the different time period jumps.  But for the most part, season five was quite interesting as we saw different characters receiving more screen time, we got to see how evil Benjamin Linus truly is (and how wonderful an actor Michael Emerson is to play such a role) and seeing some of my favorite character(s) getting killed off was a bit of a hard pill to swallow after the final episode was over.

Just the final minute alone of the season finale, I felt saddened... yes, as a dedicated follower of ""LOST"" (yes, I even followed the audio book and a lurker on ""THE FUSELAGE"" online forum), I felt that the season was a bit more restrained but the finale, almost like season three, more than made up for it.  Needless to say, big things are to come in this final sixth season and I look forward to seeing what Damon Lindelof, Carlton Cuse and the writing crew have planned.

So, I did enjoy the fifth season of ""LOST"" (not as much as the fourth which was more adventure and action-driven) and since I'm a sci-fi geek, it was it easy for me to take in the sci-fi ""time travel"" aspect of this fifth season, which I'm sure there are people who felt the writers may have been pushing the storyline a bit too far.  But for me, I felt the storyline worked and again, you can sense the writers are going to have fun with this upcoming final season.  I definitely look forward to it.

As for the Blu-ray release of ""LOST - THE COMPLETE FIFTH SEASON"", this has to be the best looking television series on Blu-ray yet.  I was just amazed of how much detail can be seen, things that never caught my attention when watching it on television.  From the skin pores and even the hair on one's arm, to the lush plants and the coarse rocks, the amount of detail that pops is simply amazing.  Audio quality is also used very well through all channels.  From hearing the thunder and rain, the druglord's airplane crashing onto the island to the number of vehicles crashing, gun shots galore and just the ambient sounds are capture quite well and all were great use of lossless audio.

As for special features, for those who are looking for a lot of commentaries like previous releases, ""LOST - The complete Fifth Season"" has very few this time around and some who enjoy commentary tracks will be slightly bummed.  But that doesn't mean this season is lacking any special features.  If anything, disc 5 of this set contains plenty of special features that are quite long, quite a few easter eggs hidden and it was great to watch the celebration of the 100th episode of ""LOST"".  But of course, the biggest addition to this Blu-ray is the utilization of BD-Live for the exclusive ""LOST Universe"".

It's a great technology for viewers/fans to connect with each other and take part in showing their love for the series.  It's important to note that enjoying ""LOST University"" would depend on those who have BD-Live enabled, profile 2.0 Blu-ray player (a player can connect to the Internet) and is able to utilize the technology.  But those who don't have the capability, I can understand if they are upset that the direction (special feature-wise) was more for those who can experience BD-Live.

Overall, this is the most ambitious Blu-ray release for ""LOST"" in terms of special features but also the picture and audio quality is absolutely fantastic.  If you are a major ""LOST"" fan, this latest ""LOST - The Complete Fifth Season"" Blu-ray set is highly recommended!",1260316800,5,13616,4.846320346320346
3440004,3,B0019LY5IM,"This is a case study in how not to do a blu-ray release. As with the previous season, the set is massively overpriced given that its so few episodes. There are no physical extras at all. Not even a card listing episode titles. Its the classic fan expolitation release.

There are two audio commentaries that were thrown together in a way that suggests they didn't want to do any audio commentaries at all. We are given a mock-1980s style documentary that might be interesting but for the fact that it has nothing new to say and nearly all of it was available on the web long before
the set was even released. All of the more interesting extras from previous seasons are missing.

And then there is ""Lost University"" which amounts to a conviluted online game designed to hide content (a bunch of commentary segments) already on the blu-ray.

One positive thing was that the longer final episode of the season was not mangled or presented as two episodes this time.

There are deleted scenes, bloopers, behind the scenes interviews and so on, but there is no interesting comment to be had.

So why are the extras so bad? Because they took them all and created an even more expensive version (The Complete Fifth Season Dharma Initiative Orientation Kit). And because they care *so much* for the fans, they randomly put a futher exclusive extra in only some of the Dharma kit sets (the sub patch).

The word for season five is *exploitation*.

There is nothing worth rushing out to buy this for. I would suggest either picking it up used (With no physical extras, what does it matter) or wait for the price to drop further.",1260230400,,1619,4.620209059233449
3440005,5,B0019LY5IM,"NORMALLY I could care less about the packaging BUT........in this case I am more than a little upset!! 4 seasons, 4 DVD boxes, and 4 uniform packages (just changed the colors) that look great sitting next to each other on my shelf. And NOW they decide change the look of the box?!?!?!?! Did IQ's suddenly DROP at the company responsible??!

I'd like to find the imbecilic MORON who ok'd this change and punch him/her in the head!!! (well...if it's a woman...I'd just yell alot!!)

This is right up there with the DEMONS FROM HELL who release DVDs that won't let you skip over previews!!!!

Yes...I LOVE the show and this won't change the quality of the shows contained on the discs inside but......this travesty sticks out like a sore thumb on my shelf!!!

I'm seriously tempted to deduct a star or 2 for this screw-up, which I KNOW is about money (the new box is probably cheaper and you KNOW all the greedy demons really care about is the $$) but that wouldn't be fair to one of the best shows on TV.

As for the show itself....what can I tell fans they don't already know? That it's back in fine form after 2 not-quite-as-good seasons? That it REALLY makes me look forward to the final season? Well..........you already know that or you don't watch the show and probably will never see this review!!",1260230400,11,1302,4.547008547008547
3440006,4,B0019LY5IM,"Lost is a show that is complex, with multiple stories intertwining.  However, Lost Season 5 takes it to a new level.  The interwieving time travel story, where flashbacks involve differnt times, both forward and backwards is so heavy and intricate, the season begs to be rewatched.  The trouble is that a show like lost, which has been creating mysteries and plots for four years had to have a season this complex and confusing to provide the set up to the final season.  Much like in chess, a number of pieces must be put in place prior to check mate, season 5 sets up a number of stories and characters for its final season.  Through the complexity you find a well acted, and well driven story.  Sime revelations are made, some of which people have been guessing for some time, others which were completely unexpected.  All of this was brought together in one of the best cliffhangers I've seen on television.  When season 6 premieres, I'll be watching.

As to the Blu Ray, the picture is gorgeous, especially the outdoor shots, with a pretty good smattering of special features, though I would have preferred a few more.  Sometimes when I watch special features on the Blu Ray/DVDs, I feel the cast, crew, and producers are holding back on information, just to not spoil things that are coming, and I especially felt that here, where the features didn't really give any insight into the future of the show, but was mostly retrospective.  Overall, this show is great, with a great presentation on blu.  Highly recomended!",1260230400,2,1523,4.749049429657795
3440007,5,B0019LY5IM,"I am one of those LOST fans who never really wavered during the season 2-3 slowdown...to me this show's always been amazing from beginning to end (Well almost end). Of course some aspects of the story have been more interesting than others, but that only makes the intense times all that much better. The reality is that LOST has never been bad and the parts people complain about are only less than stellar in comparison with the amazing heights of this creative and engrossing show has achieved.

With that said, season 5 is LOST at it's most compelling...a true benchmark that I wish more shows would even try to aspire to...bravo!!",1260230400,,635,4.7207207207207205
3440008,3,B0019LY5IM,"less episodes, more expensive, way cheaper packaging. any real fan of this show has them tivo's or downloaded and burned. i am boycotting buying this until the studio realizes they ruined the box set.",1260230400,4,200,4.911764705882353
3440009,3,B0019LY5IM,"I just picked up my copy of Season 5 on DVD. While the show itself is amazing, and this season being equalling jaw dropping and intellectually challenging, this review is about the quality of product. In regards to the packaging, I am actually disgusted. After four seasons of the same packaging strategy, Buena Vista decided to change the packaging in the shows fifth season. While the packaging may look similar in the picture or even when you pick it up on the shelf, I must warn you it is not. THe slipcase has been completely redesigned and for the worse. On the first four seasons packaging a plastic, slightly transparent slipcase was used and the DVDs would come out the bottom. Now the packaging is a crummy solid cardboard slipcase and the DVDS are removed from the side of the case. The entire package is thinner than all the other boxsets, the number of DVDS are fewer than even season 4 (which was incredibly short because of the writer's strike). On top of all that, there are no inserts for this season, yet there is a slot for inserts that only house  a bunch of crappy coupons for bluray. When you place the box next to all the other seasons you immediately notice that the LOST logo is dramatically smaller than the rest, along with the picture. The number 5, in comparison to the rest of the seasons numbers is slightly higher and makes the dvd look like misfit or a shoddy bootleg. The quality of the DVDs are good, the menus are pretty cool (changes to white) and the bonus features are modest at best. One of the bonus features ""Room 23 and beyond"" brings you around the writer's room but some images are blurred out not to spoil anything. Also, they decided to make certain bonus features only available on Bluray. I don't know what Bueno Vista was thinking with the construction of this boxset, but it is easily the worse LOST boxset out there. I feel cheated, and the retail price is ridiculous for the quality you are receiving.",1260230400,11,1954,4.551136363636363
3440010,5,B0019LY5IM,"While this show has always tried to separate characters and then bring them back together, this season finds them the most separated they have ever been.  Now that we know who the Oceanic Six are, their story picks up 3 years later as Ben (Michael Emerson) attempts to get them to return to the island.  He finds a surprising ally in Jack (Matthew Fox), but some of the others have no interest in returning.  This is especially true for Kate (Evangeline Lilly).  What will get them to return?

Meanwhile, those left on the island have become unstuck in time.  They and the island flash in and out of various time periods and learn some surprising things along the way.  Locke (Terry O'Quinn) still acts like the leader, but a surprising alliance forms between Sawyer (Josh Holloway) and Juliet (Elizabeth Mitchell).  As their health is affected by all the time skips, will Locke's desperate plan to stop their time jumps really work?

I long ago gave up trying to predict where this show is going or make too much sense out of it.  I just sit back and enjoy the ride.  And maybe that's why I was able to enjoy this wild and crazy ride so much.  Crazy was certainly the key word here.  I never would have guessed where the show would go this season.  Some answers have been sprinkled into the mix, but frankly I still have more questions than answers at this point.

Most of them were created by the final few minutes of the season finale.  I can't believe I have been hanging since May to find out what happens next.  The final season can't start soon enough for me.

Of course, a compelling story would be nothing without good characters.  While Jack and Kate can get on my nerves at times, I still love watching Juliet.  And you can't help but love to hate Ben as he manipulates everyone into doing whatever he thinks is right.  Love them or hate them, the actors do an amazing job with their characters and the material they are given every week.  It's a joy to watch them work.

I continue to have faith that this crazy journey really is leading somewhere.  Soon I'll find out if I was right or not.  Meantime, this is a show worth catching up on before the final season starts.",1260230400,2,2182,4.44949494949495

3440012,5,B0019LY5IM,"Lost has not lost it. The fifth season shows a series that not only is able to keep up its pace but also to improve with time. While the central cast has reduced itself to a handful of characters who have returned from the Island, this actually allows the series to focus more on stronger storylines. As has been said before, during season 5 a lot of questions are addressed and sometimes answered: we get to see the Dharma initiative quite in detail. While this explains quite a lot of things about what happened on the Island previously there are still many central issues that go unanswered. Also some new twists are uncovered. Some of the parts dealing with time-travel on the island do probably stretch the imagination a bit too much but otherwise the content is of really high quality. We get to see some really strange things , mainly centering on John. The enigmatic Richard and Jacob are also seen some more but not much is learned about them. It remains very entertaining and hopefully will do so until the end.",1259798400,2,1021,4.584699453551913

After 4 seasons most shows grow stale and boring, but not LOST... This season it's twist and turns come at a break neck speed... This show isn't for everyone though... It is intricate, time consuming, and smart television... There has never been a show like LOST and there never will be after it is gone.... SEASON 5 is amazing!!",1259539200,7,504,4.611111111111111
3440014,5,B0019LY5IM,"This show just keeps getting better and better. Season Five was no exception. Every eps. was must see tv from the very beginning learning Ben did move the island to the surprising ending of throwing the bomb down that hatch that may or may not have caused the Incident.

They moved the Island. As the Island moved Sawyer, Juliet, Miles and Daniel flashed all over the place before Locke finally moved it again causing it to stop in the seventies when the Dharma Initiative was alive and running the island, Sawyer, Miles, and Juliet end up joining while waiting for Locke to return to the island. Sawyer and Juliet become a new kick ass couple. Miles contiunes to make us all laugh while dealing with daddy issues his father none other then the doctor we've seen in all the videos. Daniel looses his marbles and then makes us cry when he's sent back in time by his mother Eloise only to be shot by her younger self. Oh yeah Charles Widmore is his father I think we have a winner in the worse parentage ever.

Of the island Jack, Kate, Sayid, Hurley, and Sun deal with re-entering the world post-island still believing everyone else back on the island is in trouble. This gets pushed further along by arrivals of Locke and then Ben urging and maniplating them all to go back to the island. They all end up heading back to island with the help of Eloise. Jack, Kate, Hurley and Sayid end up back in the 70s when the new plane crashes while Sun, Locke, Frank and Ben end up in 2007 after crashing in the same plane.

Ben contiunes to be vie for the best psycho award. After moving the island he's banished from it Ben spends his time preparing for his return. Convincing everyone else to go back, stopping in London to promise Widmore he'd kill Penny in exchange for his own daughter's murder. He talks Locke out of suicide before murdering him and staging it as a suicide. Ah Ben your an overachiever. But once back on the island Ben's forced to ""face the island"" for his crimes. Oddly enough Alex's death appears to be the only one the island's concerned about and not mass murder and his millions of other crimes. The smoke monster delievers the answer via Alex to do everything Locke says. Hmm not
not what I was expecting but that was fun to watch. Surprisingly Ben does everything Locke says even kills Jacob when he's ordered too. Oh that wasn't Locke....oops. On the other hand maybe that was the best punishment for Ben. Good job Island

Locke poor Locke he flashes around the island with Sawyer and the gang learning the only way he can fix everything is bring everyone back to the island. Unfortunately, he has to die to do it. Locke tries desperately to convince the Oceanic Six to return to the island with no luck. The is murdered by Ben and returned to the island in a coffin.
Once back on the island Locke is a new man. He has a direction, a purpose, he has fun Ben setting out to see the leader Jacob who no one appears to have ever seen except the never aging Richard. Turns out Jacob does exists unfortunately, Locke is not Locke and has dreamed of killing Jacob for ages.

Jacob- to my surprised actually exists in the last eps he is shown having visited every Oceanic Six and Sawyer at a turning point in their lives. Its hard to tell if he's good or evil. He gets Kate out of shopping lifting at an early age, gives Sawyer the pen to write his letter, and distracts Sayid and Nadia which ends up in Nadia's death. While Kate and Sawyer probably would have grown up the same Nadia probably wouldn't have been in the middle of the road when she was killed however if Ben was right about the man who killed her (which its been so who knows) he might have killed Sayid instead. Hurley was the only one Jacob talked to after the island and Jacob appears to have healed Locke so he may be Good but this is LOST so who knows.

Esau- and Not Locke-Guy who wants Jacob dead or Esau as some of LOST boards have been calling him- Esau wants Jacob dead. Jacob keeps bringing people to the island who fight and destroy. Esau insists it will always be the same Jacob insists there's only one ending and keeps bring people. Esau wants to kill Jacob. And he doe. By using Locke and convince Ben to kill Jacob which he does. But Locke's body was found in the box so has Esau been impersonating dead people all this time? Is the smoke monster? What does this all mean?

The second crash-Everyone else who didn't flash to the 70s or run off with Ben are heading to the broken Statue
with a huge box containing the dead Locke to see Richadus or Richard. One of them was visited by Jacob in a hospital. Richard is shocked to see Locke's dead body. Are they the whos coming? That Jacob warned Esau about. Or Jack and the crew coming back from the 70s after Juliet denonated the bomb? Or someone else?

Desmond- Desmond beats up Ben. Desmon beats up Ben. That was awsome and a long time coming. Desmond's also the only one who's the most correct about the island that there all just a pawn in someone else's game. Jacob and Esau? Or just one or other? There wasn't nearly enough Desmond this season.

The Bomb-Did it flash at the end? Or cause the incident? Or did it reset things? That's what I love about this show figuring out what the hell is going on. I so hope Juliet isn't dead.

There's millions of other things that happened on this season that I left out or forgot about. But that's what's amazing about LOST there are millions of questions, theories and things happening in each ep that its impossible to name them all or figure them out. It keeps you on the edge of your seat and trying to figure it out right along with the show. Just when you think you've got it all figured out like there's no Jacob they turn it all around on you. God I love this show. Its so good. I can't wait to see how it all ends next season.

But there is one small down side. Kate- I don't know if its the actress or the storylines for her but she is the weakest link on the show. The charactor sucks the energy right out of the show. The Jack and Kate arc was by far the most boring part of LOST. I can't blame Jack because even he gets better when Kate's not around. She has become by far the most useless charactor. There's no reason for her to be on the show anymore. She does nothing and she adds nothing to the story.",1258761600,,6309,4.320101351351352
3440015,5,B0019LY5IM,"A lot of people did not like Season 5 of Lost. The dropping numbers of viewers prove this. Well I for one could not possibly disagree more. IMO season 5 was one of the best yet. Its the Season where Lost found its true self. Lets face it, Lost has always been a Sci Fi show, it was just set up in a way that made it more of a drama at times. This was how it was able to pull in so many viewers in the first couple of seasons as straight Sci Fi shows are never able to pull in those kinds of numbers. Well because of this dual role that Lost played, a lot of people simply forgot that Lost was in fact a Sci Fi show.

This is why when Season 5 came along and the characters started jumping through time, a lot of people simply pulled away from the show as they didn't like the direction it was taking. Well for those of us that have understood from the beginning just what kind of show Lost really was, season 5 has easily been one of the best yet. Again this is the season where Lost found its true self, that of being a sci-fi show. In the Lost universe, time traveling is no more difficult to believe than anything we have seen on this show.

The bottom line is that Lost has always been a Sci Fi show and it always will be. The people that have stopped watching Lost simply had a misconception about what this show really was. I for one love that the writers and producers have finally let Lost be the show that that it is. Its not a drama, its not a romantic comedy, its not a thriller, its not a comedy....its a Mystery/Sci Fi show and that is exactly what we got in Season 5.

I am of course not really happy that they split the last season into 2 smaller seasons but what can you do. We are now approaching the start of the final season so its water under the bridge at this point.

The bottom line - If you like the Sci-fi side of Lost then you should absolutely love season 5. Season 5 is the season where Lost came out of the closet.

3440018,5,B0019LY5IM,This TV Series is addictive!  Extremely well written & acted.  It has created very devoted followers.  I recommend watching all seasons in sequence.,1255219200,,148,5.3478260869565215
3440019,3,B0019LY5IM,"While I may a voice from the wilderness, let us take a look at the facts!

season one 24 episodes
season two 23 episodes
season three 22 episodes
season four 13 episodes (writer's strike year)

Fact #1 ABC said that there were to be 7 seasons, now reduced to six.
Fact #2 ABC said that they would increase the amount of episodes to make up for the shortness of season 4. NOT
Fact #3 ABC aired two ""NEW"" episodes in season 5 that were no more than ""previously on lost""

season five 16 episodes.  add season 1-4 divide by four equals 20.5 episodes. By my math season five should have 21 episodes, or more.

ABC has mis-managed this series so badly.  For example: in an effort to get public viewers they started LOST 4 or 5 minutes early (cutting Dances with the Stars short) and many times ran into the next show late to get people watching a ""NEW series.  If you watched season one and two, you'll remember the six week breaks, then in season two ABC decides to start showing the Tail section 2 weeks into the 6 week break???

My point: I love the series LOST, I watch it over and over.  I can't wait for the DVD release of season five.  But, at what a cost to the long time viewers of LOST.  Only to be diappointed with short seasons and no seventh season.

conclusion: Dallas always had 28-30 shows a season, for 14 yrs.  Well the series ""24"" runs 24 episodes, you get your bang for the buck there.",1254960000,12,1399,4.253787878787879
3440020,3,B0019LY5IM,"Forget about explanations. Millions of people all have their solutions. We'll see next year.  I can only say that part of the answer lies with the father figure. Almost all the charcters has had a problem with their father. Plus, you've got Hurley who talks about ""The Empire Strikes Back"" which is known to contain the famous Darth Vader Line ""No Luke. I am your father"". Plus, the creators has said that the end would be kind of biblical. And let's just say that in the Bible, The Father plays a big role. You also have Ben who describe the Passion Of Christ at some point... In that Passion, Jesus begs his father to save him and then reconciles with him. I'm telling you: something with the father figure is at the heart of this TV series.

Anyhow, this season gave me the best moment of the whole series. It's a small moment. A lot of people might not even remember. It lasts about 10 seconds and it's about Sawyer, one of the most interesting character, if not the most. At some point, he wakes up and leaves for he was informed that some of his friends were finnaly discovered. Juliete is troubled by it. As he arrives and gets out of his vehicle, what does he see? Hurley, Jack and... Kate getting out of the van. It's been years since he saw her. He even swore to Juliete that he didn't even remember her. And here she is. In front of him. The look on his face... and boum! the episode ends. That particular moment was so touching. Plus, we ourselves could identify with Sawyer cause those characters were absent for a complete episode or two prior to that. I was also glad, like Sawyer, to see them come out of the van. The look on Jack's face. The lines on his forehead. No words. Just emotions and a smile.

That moment surpasses the one, in season 3, where Sawyer, chained and forced to break stones, kisses Kate as he cannot control himself anymore. She is so sexy in her dress and covered with sweat. He just drops everything, walk up to her and kisses her and then, he attacks the others as they come to stop him.

Boy! That character really gives us strong moments... he's kind of the Han Solo of the Star Wars saga.

I still think that season 3 was the best. But season 5 is awesome. It really distances itself from the rest of the series as it embarks on a complete new journey of science-fiction. before, you could almost try (i'm saying ""try"") to explain everything in a scientific way. But in season 5... forget it. We are in complete fantasy. Now it's clear. Science cannot explain everything here. Some people might stop watching ""Lost"" from now on. The creators are now showing their cards. They don't care about new viewers. They are satisfying the old ones. The ones who are ready to follow now that it is officially a science-fiction series.",1251763200,8,2769,4.432220039292731
3440021,5,B0019LY5IM,"I've never been much of a TV fan. Most shows are okay to kill time if that's what you need, but they are hardly must see entertainment. LOST is the exception to that rule. I came upon this show by accident and it has been a huge part of my life each season. Season 5 might well be the most ambitious and epic of all so far which is saying a lot. You won't regret it, especially on DVD, which is how I got hooked and much more fun than waiting for a week between episodes. LOST rules!",1250812800,3,483,3.938775510204082
3440022,5,B0019LY5IM,"Too much happens in Season 5 to go over but there is enough drama, action, mystery and suspense to please just about anyone. Some may be confused with the whole time travel plot line, but I think it will all come together beautifully in the final season and it will all make perfect sense. Or I hope anyway. Up till now, we have been getting more questions than answers and perhaps Season 5 is the weirdest of them all, but I thoroughly loved each and every episode. It has alot to offer. Though some characters were underutilized, others who have more screentime certainly benefit from it. We have a predictable romance, yes, but it also somehow feels genuine and when the tention mounts, you really feel it. There are alliances, and backstabbing, people that miraculously rise from the dead(or do they?) and of course, the mysterious Jacob is finally revealed. Or so we think. I suppose it can get frustrated at times, but I always ended up craving more after the end of each episode. That should be the purpose of any show and this succeeds on every level. The season ends in a cliffhanger that is impossible to ponder over or it will drive you crazy. There are theories galore, but most of them are probably wrong, so I don't even bother to think too much over it. It's sad to know that there is only 1 season left to go, but knowing we will finally be getting the answers will be well worth it.",1249603200,2,1399,4.46875
3440023,5,B0019LY5IM,"Lost is my favorite show. Easily. Season five is the one where they do all the time travel stuff. I love time travel stuff, but to be honest with you I was skeptical at first when they announced that the season would deal heavily in time travel. They had touched on time travelling style issues in previous seasons, with Desmond, but actual, physical time travel seemed like a major shark jump.

Well, luckily they handled it in a way that only LOST could, and the result is incredibly interesting, and even works its way into fold of Lost mythology without a hitch. Three episodes in particular are among my all time favorites of the series...
THE JUGHEAD- in which the gang goes back to 1954 and meet seventeen year old Ellie, a super cute vixen with a super cute (but b*tchy) face.
HES OUR YOU- a fantastic mind trip involving Sayid getting revenge on Ben thirty years in the past and..
FOLLOW THE LEADER- the peak of time travel madness and smoke monster antics rolled together in one and featuring a now forty year old Eloise Hawking who is super hot and could put handcuffs on me anyday. Seriously Ellie Hawking could detonate my Jughead, like woah! Even the seventy year old Eloise has a sort of sex about her ...in a weird, cosmic wisdom of time sort of way... Too bad she's such an obsessive,,, like to an almost insane degree... but that is how it goes with this show. Lots of weird wild stuff going down in season five... just another gem in the mix!",1248912000,,1461,4.47191011235955

Season 4 (shortened for the strike) was significantly better, faster paced than Season 3 and Season 5 has brought this show back from the dead.

You can't beat this show right now.  It moved like a freight train for me and didn't lag on plot lines.

Season finale was perfect.

This is one of the few television shows that has come back from being nearly unwatchable.",1248739200,2,520,4.364583333333333
3440025,5,B0019LY5IM,"Lost has recently ended its fifth season and fans are eagerly awaiting its sixth (and final) season. It's not too late to pick up on the shows wonderfully detailed immersible world. Many who don't know, this has yet to be released to DVD/BluRay and we the reviewers are basing it upon the season thus far minus the bonus feature that will be included on the sets.

Season five was (in my opinion) the best of the recent seasons matching it with season ones heartfelt emotion and wonders of the beyond. I don't wish to spoil anything for viewers of the show, or people ready to make the jump into the show and become a losty. Though I will say their are multiple time frames, dozens of iconic (for Lost that is) flashbacks, and a cast who can act beyond what I've seen on television as of late.

This season has so many moments that leave you mesmerized, shocked, and dumbfounded you crave to watch them all in chronological order. Sometimes you just don't have time to catch them all in order on tv and the continuity becomes even more screwy with the ever deepening plot line. Thankfully the Lost Season 5 boxset will accompany you on the startling, adventures of the lost crew and hopefully give you an indepth look on things we may have overlooked.

This season has a couple extra long two hour episodes, and an amazing finale to recap everything, though it yearns to be completed upon the ending of the epic finale. In one year we will have everything (hopefully) answered. It's one of those shows you want to read up on spoilers, but you wish not to spoil it for yourself and begin the wait.

Those not familiar with Lost, do yourself a favor if you're interested in it... pick up the first season. The show only becomes more confusing, knowing the characters before they become more fleshed out will help you in the long run. All the previous season up to 4 are readily available and rather cheap to buy, also you can find lost on a few stations.

If you don't know what Lost exactly is, well to put it simple we're not too sure either, but we can assure you it's a rewarding show. A downed jet leaves survivors stranded on what appears to be an uncharted island. Together they must coordinate efforts, or die alone. As time progresses you will often see characters unfold themselves and with the use of heavy flashbacks characters are exposed to the viewer and not the survivors. The show has its run of what seem to be stalk characters at first, but they really grow to become some of the best television can present. The island seems to have a few secrets leading some of the survivors either haywire, strongly curious, or in a state of panic.

The show isn't for everyone, it is somewhat witty, requires a high attention span, and what some may call pointless others will note for progress. Ones open to something really different, and genuinely intriguing will no doubt find this at least full of quality.",1248652800,3,2916,4.544761904761905
3440026,4,B0019LY5IM,"this show is so confusing it gives me a headache to the point where i have to watch it with the lights off so they don't irritate me.  i have always asked myself as i watched this show what was going on, but never to the extent of this season. flash forwards, flash backs, 1977, 2007?? it all got jumbled. many major characters sat back the whole season instead of getting involved, Desmond, Ben, Locke, Sun, and more. and the whole point of this show is that they are lost without rescue, now they are home and decided to go back because the island is moving throughout time. SO WHAT??? once they get back there is no plot line at all. they just hang out and do nothing, for example Jack seems content to be a janitor while Kate flirts with Bens Dad.

By the way, what was the whole thing where Ben gets shot, goes missing, and the dad doesnt think a thing about it. he just goes about his buisness after a short outburst. and after they return they can just leave on the submarine and get off the island for good. but they decided not to.

i don't know......

after all this they blow up a bomb that will send them back into the future and never have the plane crash. so how will there be a season six if they land just like they are suposed to. knowing the writers of the show it will end with Jack going ""we have to go back.""

some advice, take out time travel from tv and movies forever.

3440028,2,B0019LY5IM,"I loved the first four seasons.  Lost was always interesting (or at least when it occassionally ran off track it would JOLT you back into caring).  But once it started into the time-traveling, everything just started spiraling out of control.  Once you bring time travel in, then nothing matters any more.  Anything is possible and so everything becomes immediately uninteresting.

There was really nothing I found very interesting or exciting about the entire season.  Nothing until Sayid shot young Ben.  I was shocked and entertained at that...for about 30 seconds...before I said to myself ""...wait, wait...he BETTER have actually died!""  Of course he didn't, even though, of all people, Sayid should have been able to stop that kid's heart from beating.  So even the one thing that could have been the ""Oh my god!"", season-making moment (think Locke being thrown out the building), didn't happen.  It was just smoke and mirrors.

So much of the season was just time-traveling around randomly so we could have nostalgic looks down memory lane.  For example, Jin meeting a young Rousseau...for no reason, et.al.

Then we've got the ridiculous, contrived relationship between Sawyer and Juliet.  Is ANYONE actually buying this?  Totally, totally lame.

And now Locke is a reincarnated ancient god, who just killed another god.  Or not.  Or something.

And oh my god!  Juliet just sacrificed herself!  Or maybe not.  So who cares any more.

Who.  Cares.  I watched this show for 5 years under the assumption that there would be a huge pay-off at the end, justifying my investment in all the mysteries and so on.  Now it would make as much sense for E.T. and Harry Potter to show up in the final season.

When the 6th ends...the Internet is going to be a damn firestorm of hate.  Guaranteed.  Well, Im glad I'll be one of the few able to laugh at the whole mess.",1246406400,20,1862,4.840764331210191
3440029,5,B0019LY5IM,"This season was truly amazing.

The season finale was something that changes completely the perspective of the show, and gives you a better picture of what's going on, but you're left with the question of ""what's going to happen next?"" more than ever.

We had so many things this season that I don't know who could rate it less than 3 stars, I know it's just their point of view, but I'd recommend that you watch it again, because one of the bad things in LOST (Something that I love, but makes people who watch the episodes only once, or simply have bad memory to be lost) that we go back to previous episodes. So many scenes that people might find useless, really have a connection to something that has already happened, or something that's going to happen.

Trust me, this season more than any other, deserves a 2nd watch and you're probably going to connect everything correctly on your head, specially with the finale.

And if after this season you still think that they don't know where they're going, that they make it up as they go along, then you still don't see the big picture in LOST, maybe you would need to watch it again.

What I strongly advice, is that you finish watching the season, you take a deep breath, think about the episode, and watch it again, at least the begining of it, because I've had some friends that hated lost after the finale, but after I explained things over, they were completely amazed how they plan this show!

But still, we have to wait for season 6 in 2010, that will be what will define this show as a complete masterpiece, or just a good entertaining show.

3440034,5,B0019LY5IM,"Season Five of LOST was the first that provided more answers than questions. The first four seasons had raised questions at an extraordinary pace, providing the occasional answer. But while the end of Season Five raised a couple of massive questions of huge cliffhanger proportions, we nonetheless got more of a sense of what is going on with the island, its inhabitants, and its visitors than ever before. There are still some major unanswered questions, like the origin of the island and what the deal with Richard Alpert (the ageless wonder) is and who built the statue (and what brought it down), but we still are getting an overall picture of things.

What held true of LOST after Season One holds true of the show after Season Five: whether this turns out to be a great show depends on how well they manage to wrap up the overall story line. There have been very, very few shows in the history of television that have set out, from the very beginning, to tell a self-contained story with a beginning, middle, and an end. BATTLESTAR GALACTICA (the new one, not the old one) was one. BABYLON 5 was another. Many other shows have more or less ended up telling a story, but in a way that wasn't crucial to the structure of the series. This was even true of a show like ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT. But for shows like LOST and BSG, our ultimate judgment will hinge on how well all the loose ends are wrapped up at the end. The final answers will have a retroactive effect on the rest of the series. If we are left at the end feeling that the secrets of the island have not been adequately answered, this will undercut all that went before. If we don't accept the way the stories of the characters are resolved, it will weaken the series as a whole. I loved the way that BSG ended (though I'll grant that not everyone did) and I fully hope that LOST will end similarly well. We've gotten five great seasons and I doubt that Damon Lindelhof and Carlton Cuse will suddenly lose their ability to tell a great story. Plus, they will continue to be assisted by some great writers like Drew Goddard and Elizabeth Sarnoff and Brian K. Vaughan (who got a great shout out this season when Hurley is seen reading in Spanish one of the volumes of Y: THE LAST MAN, the famous graphic series written by Vaughan).

Season Five began with the survivors of Oceanic 815 and their various allies split into two groups. The Oceanic Six are back in the real world, but Jack and Ben are determined to lead them all back to the island. The rest back on the island - at least those that are still alive, most having died - have, like Billy Pilgrim in Kurt Vonnegut's SLAUGHTERHOUSE-FIVE, become unstuck in time. They find themselves moving from one year or decade - heck, from one century - to another. And when the Oceanic Six return, they find themselves stranded in a different time themselves, back in the seventies with the Dharma Initiative and the Others. Most poignantly, Sun has found out that Jin is till alive, but they are stuck thirty years apart.

But this wouldn't be LOST without a host of twists and turns. We are barraged (in a good way) with a never-ending string of shocks and surprises. Things constantly turn out not to be what we expect. That is especially true of John Locke, but true of just about everyone else as well. The amount of detail is almost overwhelming, though in a good way. It keeps the show fascinating and ever fresh. And of course, this being LOST, there are a host of deaths. The only series with a larger body count is BSG.

The best thing about Season Five of LOST is that it continues the excellent pacing that was established after the Season Three hiatus. I'm sure everyone will recall that fans were outraged and disappointed after the first six episodes of Season Three, which were broadcast a few months before the show resumed in the winter. Fans felt that the show was dragging, as if they were trying to stretch the series out an extra season or two instead of getting on with the story. When the show resumed, the producers responded to the fans' complaints and significantly stepped up the pace of the storytelling. By the end of that season it felt like a new and completely refreshed show. And Seasons Four and Five have maintained that pace. One thing that definitely helped them maintain the pace was the announcement at the end of Season three that the show would end after Season Six.

And so we come to the beginning of the end. For five seasons LOST has been one of the most intense, involving shows on television. I'm already starting to get sad about its end. I still haven't quite recovered from BATTLESTAR GALACTICA ending this spring and now LOST ends next spring. It has been a great story from the very beginning and we can only hope that things remain just as good as they have been.",1243296000,24,4825,4.516018306636155

3440039,5,B0019LY5IM,"It's the beginning of the end for ""Lost"" -- only one more season to go, and plenty of strange destined events yet to be explained.

And ""Lost: The Complete Fifth Season"" may be the best season of the show yet, with some unexpected glimpses back into the Island's history, mysterious people, and more explorations of the mysterious Jacob. It feels like the entire season is packed with strange twists and unexpected turns, complete with a trip back in time that illuminates everything that has come before it.

Jack joins forces with his former enemy Ben, trying to bring the Oceanic Six back together and get them back to the Island. But Charles Widmore has been sending assassins to kill Hurley and Sayid, and someone is sniffing around Kate's relationship to Aaron. Their only hope of getting back to the Island is to follow the instructions of Eloise Hawking, a woman who has intricate knowledge of time and space -- and the Island.

Meanwhile, the Island is randomly leaping through time, flinging Sawyer, Juliet, Daniel, Charlotte and all the others from one time period to another. And when the Oceanic Six (minus a few) arrive on the Island again, they find that it is now 1977 -- Sawyer, Juliet and their friends have all been living there for the past three years, as part of the Dharma Initiative. Sun and Ben end up in the hands of the remaining Others -- along with a supposedly dead man now returned to life.

But as the fateful Incident approaches, Jack and Co. end up having their plans unravel around them, and a bunch of gun-toting Dharma people out for their blood. With the help of Daniel Faraday and his mysterious journal, the splintered little group sets out to somehow reset everything that has happened on the Island -- even as Ben and the Others approach an ancient monument, where the Island's fate will be changed forever.

There's a sense of melancholy in the fifth season of ""Lost."" Okay, it's never been a cheerful show, but it's clear that many of the plot threads are being wound together, and the characters that are killed have wrenchingly tragic send-offs. What's more, this short season reveals a whole lot more about the Island than we ever knew before -- the stone foot, the Incident, Eloise Hawking's knowledge about time, and the Island's mysterious ruler Jacob.

And it's packed solid with plot, full of twists, gory action, flashbacks, flashforwards, and a sense of supernatural suspense. The first half of the season is all about the Six slowly being drawn back to the Island (almost against their will, really) while the second is about the disasters that ensue because of their presence, and the fight against the inevitability of time. It's just a big thick rope of plot twists that tightens itself as it approaches the explosive finale.

Fortunately this season is also graced with exceptionally good dialogue, and some funny moments often supplied by the ever-lovable Hurley (example: writing down the ""Empire Strikes Back"" script from memory). And it evolves into straight-out science fiction after sort of flirting with it for the past few seasons.

Matthew Fox does a pretty good job as the increasingly irrational, obsessed Jack, but he's overshadowed by Josh Holloway. Holloway is pretty darn brilliant as the new alpha male in the jungle who suddenly has his peaceful domain disrupted. Michael Emerson is also excellent as the vaguely creepy Ben, whose frustrations and anger start boiling over as he tries to somehow fix whatever has gone wrong, only to make a terrible mistake.

Actually, most of the cast does an excellent job: Naveen Andrews, Elizabeth Mitchell (especially in the finale), the dry-witted Ken Leung, Jeremy Davies, Yunjin Kim, Daniel Dae Kim, and the ever-awesome Jorge Garcia. There are also some other incredible actors who become pretty prominent here, including Franois Chau, Zuleikha Robinson, the ageless Nestor Carbonell, and the mysterious Fionnula Flanagan.

And Mark Pellegrino is introduced as the mysterious Jacob, whose identity, nature and goals are all murky. You're left wondering who this guy is, and if we'll see him again.

""Lost: The Complete Fifth Season"" is a tightly-written, intensely-plotted stream of bittersweet sci-fi, and it leaves you hungry for whatever is next. Only one more season yet to go.",1242432000,13,4299,4.9735376044568245

In the meantime back on the island, Sawyer (Josh Holloway), Juliet (Elizabeth Mitchell), Faraday (Jeremy Davies), Miles (Ken Leung), and Charlotte (Rebecca Mader) find themselves, and the island itself, stuck traveling through time, which leads to some very interesting developments during the three years that Jack and co. are gone from the island.

Most notable however is that we finally learn more about the island's checkered past, from the huge foot of the missing statue to getting an understanding of the never-aging Richard Alpert's (Nestor Carbonell) actions to finally getting a glimpse of Jacob in the epic and shattering two part season finale that promises everything will change.  With everything that happens this season and how Lost now deals with time travel and the consequences it creates, you'd think things may end up convoluted and confusing, but surprisingly so, Lost manages to maintain a straightforward narrative that if you've been following the show for any amount of time at all, won't get thrown off or confused in the very least, which in itself is quite an accomplishment.  Yes, the end of Lost is upon us, and like past seasons before, many questions were answered, but in one huge flash of white light, even more were raised.  The end is indeed near, and while I certainly don't want to wait until 2010 to see how everything gets wrapped up, I have a feeling that the best is yet to come.",1242345600,10,2234,4.7844155844155845
3440041,5,B0019LY5IM,"I have been a loyal LOST fan since the beginning, and I must say I think Season 5 will go down as the best season as a whole of all the seasons put together. True, there are still more seasons too go, but I really can't see how the writers & producers could do much better. I hope I am wrong, but I think Lost has hit its peak with Season 5. If you stopped watching lost for any reason this season, pre-order the DVD set for the December 2009 holiday season, and get lost again. This season (Non-Specific Basic Overall Plot Spoiler Now!!!) is very well focused and fine tuned on just a few familiar classic characters with an general emphasis on time-travel so you won't have a problem getting back into the action. Then again, you might get intellectually lost with some profound thought experiences following the drama. What a great show! That is all I will say about season 5. Go get lost again, and pre-order Lost Season 5 for a great price on amazon.com. I will...",1242345600,3,969,4.388888888888889
3440042,4,B0019LY5IM,"Some spoilers:

  In a series that keeps getting stranger and stranger, season 5 was by far the strangest. It was also one of the best though. It starts off with Locke, Sawyer, Juliet, Miles, Ferredy and the redhead Freighter girl stuck on the island together. When Ben turned the wheel in season 4, the island now is constantly moving in time. When they get used to being in one time, the time changes to either the past or the future. Which is a smart way for the writers to introduce us to the Others of the past and Dharma members as well. We also learn some history about the island itself. But the flashes that keeps sending Sawyer and others through time is also slowly killing them. Locke finds a way back home to try and get help for them.

  While Jack tries to figure out how to get Kate, Hurley, Sun and Sayid to all come back to the island. Well since none of them are interested in returning.

  It's obvious they get back eventually but I won't give away how. But Sawyer and the others get stuck in the late 70's and Sawyer decides to find a way to join the Dharma group. I always felt bad that the Others killed them but we learn that a lot of them were jerks. We also get to meet the Asian from the Dharma films that Locke and Eko were watching. How his character was used was one of the best things about the season.

  The season had many surprises and twists. It was a pretty satisfying season even if a lot of the time travel rules were confusing. Since the show always leaves us hanging with our jaws dropped to the floor in the finales, this season was no exception. Hell, I think I never been eager for more since the finale of the first season.",1242259200,6,1669,4.230283911671925
3440043,5,B0019LY5IM,"It's the beginning of the end for ""Lost"" -- only one more season to go, and plenty of strange destined events yet to be explained.

And ""Lost: The Complete Fifth Season"" may be the best season of the show yet, with some unexpected glimpses back into the Island's history, mysterious people, and more explorations of the mysterious Jacob. It feels like the entire season is packed with strange twists and unexpected turns, complete with a trip back in time that illuminates everything that has come before it.

Jack joins forces with his former enemy Ben, trying to bring the Oceanic Six back together and get them back to the Island. But Charles Widmore has been sending assassins to kill Hurley and Sayid, and someone is sniffing around Kate's relationship to Aaron. Their only hope of getting back to the Island is to follow the instructions of Eloise Hawking, a woman who has intricate knowledge of time and space -- and the Island.

Meanwhile, the Island is randomly leaping through time, flinging Sawyer, Juliet, Daniel, Charlotte and all the others from one time period to another. And when the Oceanic Six (minus a few) arrive on the Island again, they find that it is now 1977 -- Sawyer, Juliet and their friends have all been living there for the past three years, as part of the Dharma Initiative. Sun and Ben end up in the hands of the remaining Others -- along with a supposedly dead man now returned to life.

But as the fateful Incident approaches, Jack and Co. end up having their plans unravel around them, and a bunch of gun-toting Dharma people out for their blood. With the help of Daniel Faraday and his mysterious journal, the splintered little group sets out to somehow reset everything that has happened on the Island -- even as Ben and the Others approach an ancient monument, where the Island's fate will be changed forever.

There's a sense of melancholy in the fifth season of ""Lost."" Okay, it's never been a cheerful show, but it's clear that many of the plot threads are being wound together, and the characters that are killed have wrenchingly tragic send-offs. What's more, this short season reveals a whole lot more about the Island than we ever knew before -- the stone foot, the Incident, Eloise Hawking's knowledge about time, and the Island's mysterious ruler Jacob.

And it's packed solid with plot, full of twists, gory action, flashbacks, flashforwards, and a sense of supernatural suspense. The first half of the season is all about the Six slowly being drawn back to the Island (almost against their will, really) while the second is about the disasters that ensue because of their presence, and the fight against the inevitability of time. It's just a big thick rope of plot twists that tightens itself as it approaches the explosive finale.

Fortunately this season is also graced with exceptionally good dialogue, and some funny moments often supplied by the ever-lovable Hurley (example: writing down the ""Empire Strikes Back"" script from memory). And it evolves into straight-out science fiction after sort of flirting with it for the past few seasons.

Matthew Fox does a pretty good job as the increasingly irrational, obsessed Jack, but he's overshadowed by Josh Holloway. Holloway is pretty darn brilliant as the new alpha male in the jungle who suddenly has his peaceful domain disrupted. Michael Emerson is also excellent as the vaguely creepy Ben, whose frustrations and anger start boiling over as he tries to somehow fix whatever has gone wrong, only to make a terrible mistake.

Actually, most of the cast does an excellent job: Naveen Andrews, Elizabeth Mitchell (especially in the finale), the dry-witted Ken Leung, Jeremy Davies, Yunjin Kim, Daniel Dae Kim, and the ever-awesome Jorge Garcia. There are also some other incredible actors who become pretty prominent here, including Franois Chau, Zuleikha Robinson, the ageless Nestor Carbonell, and the mysterious Fionnula Flanagan.

And Mark Pellegrino is introduced as the mysterious Jacob, whose identity, nature and goals are all murky. You're left wondering who this guy is, and if we'll see him again.

""Lost: The Complete Fifth Season"" is a tightly-written, intensely-plotted stream of bittersweet sci-fi, and it leaves you hungry for whatever is next. Only one more season yet to go.",1242172800,97,4299,4.9735376044568245
3440044,5,B0019LY5IM,"Season Five of LOST was the first that provided more answers than questions.  The first four seasons had raised questions at an extraordinary pace, providing the occasional answer.  But while the end of Season Five raised a couple of massive questions of huge cliffhanger proportions, we nonetheless got more of a sense of what is going on with the island, its inhabitants, and its visitors than ever before.  There are still some major unanswered questions, like the origin of the island and what the deal with Richard Alpert (the ageless wonder) is and who built the statue (and what brought it down), but we still are getting an overall picture of things.

What held true of LOST after Season One holds true of the show after Season Five:  whether this turns out to be a great show depends on how well they manage to wrap up the overall story line.  There have been very, very few shows in the history of television that have set out, from the very beginning, to tell a self-contained story with a beginning, middle, and an end.  BATTLESTAR GALACTICA (the new one, not the old one) was one.  BABYLON 5 was another.  Many other shows have more or less ended up telling a story, but in a way that wasn't crucial to the structure of the series.  This was even true of a show like ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT.  But for shows like LOST and BSG, our ultimate judgment will hinge on how well all the loose ends are wrapped up at the end.  The final answers will have a retroactive effect on the rest of the series.  If we are left at the end feeling that the secrets of the island have not been adequately answered, this will undercut all that went before.  If we don't accept the way the stories of the characters are resolved, it will weaken the series as a whole.  I loved the way that BSG ended (though I'll grant that not everyone did) and I fully hope that LOST will end similarly well.  We've gotten five great seasons and I doubt that Damon Lindelhof and Carlton Cuse will suddenly lose their ability to tell a great story.  Plus, they will continue to be assisted by some great writers like Drew Goddard and Elizabeth Sarnoff and Brian K. Vaughan (who got a great shout out this season when Hurley is seen reading in Spanish one of the volumes of Y: THE LAST MAN, the famous graphic series written by Vaughan).

Season Five began with the survivors of Oceanic 815 and their various allies split into two groups.  The Oceanic Six are back in the real world, but Jack and Ben are determined to lead them all back to the island.  The rest back on the island - at least those that are still alive, most having died - have, like Billy Pilgrim in Kurt Vonnegut's SLAUGHTERHOUSE-FIVE, become unstuck in time.  They find themselves moving from one year or decade - heck, from one century - to another.  And when the Oceanic Six return, they find themselves stranded in a different time themselves, back in the seventies with the Dharma Initiative and the Others.  Most poignantly, Sun has found out that Jin is till alive, but they are stuck thirty years apart.

But this wouldn't be LOST without a host of twists and turns.  We are barraged (in a good way) with a never-ending string of shocks and surprises.  Things constantly turn out not to be what we expect.  That is especially true of John Locke, but true of just about everyone else as well.  The amount of detail is almost overwhelming, though in a good way.  It keeps the show fascinating and ever fresh.  And of course, this being LOST, there are a host of deaths.  The only series with a larger body count is BSG.

The best thing about Season Five of LOST is that it continues the excellent pacing that was established after the Season Three hiatus.  I'm sure everyone will recall that fans were outraged and disappointed after the first six episodes of Season Three, which were broadcast a few months before the show resumed in the winter.  Fans felt that the show was dragging, as if they were trying to stretch the series out an extra season or two instead of getting on with the story.  When the show resumed, the producers responded to the fans' complaints and significantly stepped up the pace of the storytelling.  By the end of that season it felt like a new and completely refreshed show.  And Seasons Four and Five have maintained that pace.  One thing that definitely helped them maintain the pace was the announcement at the end of Season three that the show would end after Season Six.

And so we come to the beginning of the end.  For five seasons LOST has been one of the most intense, involving shows on television.  I'm already starting to get sad about its end.  I still haven't quite recovered from BATTLESTAR GALACTICA ending this spring and now LOST ends next spring.  It has been a great story from the very beginning and we can only hope that things remain just as good as they have been.",1242172800,39,4863,4.516018306636155
3440045,5,B0019LY5IM,"Yes, it can! [zero spoilers]

Can the best get any better, the stunned viewer (me) asks himself (see the brief answer in this review's title). One possible answer comes from watching LOST's Season 5 and, in this viewer's opinion it's a 'yes'.

I keep hearing that Season's 6th, 121 episode it's going to be the last and that's such a pity. Season 5, finally, provides SOME hints of how SOME of the mysteries may be explained in the end but, unlike most TV shows, 5 years later, LOST isn't one bit tired and, if anything, the there is as much potential in the plot lines and as much enthusiasm and talent on display as in the beginning if not more - the actors are seem to have gotten actually better and there is so much substance and background associated to the characters they play.

LOST is a masterpiece of a complex story - and now we know that there is one dedicated person in charge of making sure that there are no contradictions or time/space/identity inconsistencies across over 100 individual episodes. LOST delivers some of the most striking images in the history of a TV series and LOST takes full advantage of high-definition television - it could not be what it is in the pre-high definition era. LOST is just fun to watch, highest quality escapism, the kind of show you can watch over and over and almost never get tired of it or feel like fast forwarding to the next scene or to the next episode.

And the awesomeness of LOST extends to the special features. Unlike many 'how did we do this' extras found on other movies/shows, these are almost always interesting to watch and there's also something to learn. Specific to the Blu-ray version, BD-Live takes us to the LOST University - classes are forming now so go register for some. You can learn about philosophy, time travel... many topics and, if you are an A student you WILL make it to the Dean's list. Non-Blu extras includes the exquisitely well-made (80's style) TV episode of 'Mysteries of the Universe'. So well made, in fact, my kid kept asking if THAT was the real-life inspiration for the show - watch it and decide for yourself.

Here's a list of the 'extras' to be found on the various discs:

- An Epic Day With Richard Alpert - see how LOST was made, last day of Season 5 shooting.
- Building 23 & Beyond - more on how LOST is made, this time see the writers at work.
- Deleted Scenes - I'm not a fan of these but some may enjoy more of LOST.
- LOST 100 - more of 'the making of', this time it's 'episode 100'.
- LOST Bloopers - funny, actually.
- LOST On Location - Go behind-the-scenes, on-set of seven episodes from Season 5.
- LOST UNIVERSITY - a BD-Live feature. I'm still working on my admission as I failed my the test - 17 out of 23 wasn't good enough.
- Making Up For LOST Time - the logistics of keeping track of everything across all of those timelines.
- Mysteries Of The Universe - quite believable 'documentary' done 80's style.

There's not much more to say other than, 'get the Blu version if you can' because LOST was shot in HD and you will lose some of the sparkle if you look at the world of LOST through an upconverter - however, the DVD editions - I had episodes 1-3 on DVD before upgrading to Blu - have probably some of the best DVD picture quality ever seen on a DVD short of the Lord of the Rings movies.

This seemingly simple premise of a group of strangers crashing on an island and hoping for rescue has, in just 5 short seasons, given way to the most labyrinthine serialized TV plot currently (or perhaps ever) in existence. This season in particular has taken the labyrinthine qualities to another level.

3440050,5,B0019LY5IM,"Lost really pushed itself into the sci-fi realm in its fifth season. As I write this there are only 4 episodes left to finish off the current season.
Time travel plays an integral part especially in the early episodes when those left on the island experiences ""flashes"" and find themselves in earlier years on the island.
So much is the time travel that it's almost a relief when midway through the season we get back to character-centric episodes that deal primarily with the Oceanic Six and how they came to be on the plane that would bring them back to the island to save those left behind.
Jack becomes annoying, and Kate gets a little stupid andI found myself rooting for Juliet and Sawyer.

8274474,4,B0019LY5IM,"The discs come in cardboard and plastic folding contraptions. The discs play fine.

Lost was a great series, although it wasn't an original idea. The Lost Islands, The New People, and Peter Benchleys Amazon are examples of survivor type shows that came decades before Lost. The New People is one of those shows that Ive wanted to buy on disc for years, but its never been available, and its not available to watch on Amazon either.

After buying the first two seasons of Lost, and liking it, I bought the rest of the series. I laughed at the crazy Jack character and some of his silliness, but overall the series was very entertaining. The ending didn't live up to the hype. Some reviewers said that Everybody was at the church in the last episode. Not true. Mr. Echo, Libby, Lucia and a ton of other characters were not at the church. The church was mostly empty. I think the church represented Purgatory.

If you're looking for good stuff to watch consider miniseries like The Astronauts Wives Club (2015), Band of Brothers (2001), Frank Herberts Dune (2000), Frank Herberts Children of Dune (2003), Into the West (2005), Lonesome Dove (1989), Manhattan (2014-2015), Return to Lonesome Dove (1993), Pride and Prejudice (1995), Taken (2002) and The 10th Kingdom (2000), which are all terrific because they have clear beginnings that establish an objective, then strong middles and conclusive endings where the goal is achieved, like a good novel.

Other shows Ive really enjoyed include Battlestar Galactica (2004-2009), Breaking Bad (2008-2013), Cowboy Bebop (1998), Downton Abbey (2010-2015), Firefly (2002), Game of Thrones (2011-2019), Granite Flats (2013-2015), The IT Crowd (2006-2013), Jericho (2006-2008), Merlin (2008-2012), The Prisoner (1967-1968), Rome (2005-2007), Spartacus: Gods of the Arena (2011), Spartacus: Blood and Sand (2010), Stargate: SG-1 (1997-2007), Stargate: Atlantis (2004-2009), Star Trek (1966-1969) and Star Trek Voyager (1995-2001). I didn't list any contemporary series Im following that don't have an end date yet, not conducive to binge watching from beginning to finish.

If you like reading try some of my favorite fantasy and sci-fi authors: Richard Adams, Palo Bacigulupi, Suzanne Collins, Abe Evergreen, Diana Gabaldon, Hugh Howey, George Martin, Brandon Sanderson, John Scalzi, and Andy Weir.",1520985600,,2335,5.334239130434782
