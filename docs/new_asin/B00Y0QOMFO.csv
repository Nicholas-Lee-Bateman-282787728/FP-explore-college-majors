7204882,5,B00Y0QOMFO,"This is a good one.  Had me on the edge of my seat.  A realistic, fight for your life kind of movie.  Aussies know how to make these kind of movies.  Note: This is not a Mad Max, but a realistic story of what could happen after a catastrophic incident.  The acting is very well done.  I liked this movie,  I give it 5 stars.  Note:  I am not a kid.  I am in my 70's and I found this to be very entertaining.  Just as good as ""The Road"".",1438905600,20,436,3.7333333333333334
7204883,4,B00Y0QOMFO,"Wasn't bad, however we felt like the dialouge was a bit stiff as well as breif. The problem wasn't the acting it seemed to us that the general development of any backround for the story or characters/ character development really destroyed any deeper feeling we might have felt when some parts took place, a few characters the audience was clearly meant to care about we nearly forgot about more than a few times. Also we noticed that there were a few times that the movie could have ended by her just steping out and shooting the antagonist and his goons, (SPOILERS) skills she showed off by ramboing through several badies without taking a scratch at the end, this could have been time better used to develop characters or uncover a backstory.... or something rather than just saying ""the bad guy is bad"". This aside we all agree we liked it, but thats not to say we would prefer this to Beasts Of The Southern Wild.",1438732800,16,918,4.569696969696969

The last fight scene was good, but I'm sorry the actress just was not a believable survivor. She also put herself in unnecessary danger, where she did not belong. I mean she risked getting caught by stealing one of the thugs flasks not long after she just saw him kill a bunch of people. Talk about stupid.",1477008000,,456,4.313953488372093
7204895,2,B00Y0QOMFO,"I guess. If beautiful teen models struggling to survive a violent, widespread water shortage isn't silly enough, the dialogue and acting in ""The Last Survivors"" are too weak to convey believable struggle. The actors just don't have the chops to offer much more than their beautiful faces as entertainment. Put a little makeup on the male lead and he'd be kissable too.

No offense, but based on most of the reviews on Amazon, young viewers enjoy it as a beautifully shot post apocalyptic teen romance. Fair enough, but I can't imagine any intelligent person over 30 sitting through this vapid chain of artfully composed scenes. I had to fast forward through almost half of the film to see if there was any payoff by the end of this uninteresting, slow moving, cliche ridden story. Nope! And, ""better than the ""Road,"" as one reviewer wrote? Not even close.

I generally enjoy the low budget post apocalyptic sci-fi sub genre. However, the lack of grittiness and believable survival savagery made this movie too lightweight to sit through.",1475366400,,1037,4.92

7204897,3,B00Y0QOMFO,"KInda average. It's slow moving, but it is entertaining. However, it's vacant on any meaning other than simply raw survival, the morality of power, and how instances like this can bring out the worst of humanity, and also the best. In a word: formulaic. It's almost like a piece of software could have written the script--nothing wrong with it, but barren of humanity itself.

Summary
1. There is no water is the ""valley"" where they are.
2. Survivors are hunted by  the old owner of the valley water company. He wants all of the water to himself. So he's on a killing spree, with his group, to murder everyone who is still alive in the valley.
3. Hero is a `14 year old girl who fights to save her brother, who is sick.
4. The enter movie hinges on her finding an electronic part that will allow her to fly a small plane out of the valley, hopefully to water.
5. Her brother is murdered by the water people.
6. Girl gets revenge and kills the water people.
7. She flies away with a little boy she was looking after.

It's an adventure movie more than anything, but it was slow and desolate in both script and environment, which isn't a bad thing. It just lacked any conclusive meaning.",1469664000,,1185,4.401826484018265

It is truly a metaphor, on a personal scale, of the struggles American communities now face with hydrofracking's destructive nature, and the misuse and ruin of public waters.

The plot was simple but kept you watching it.  I felt the characters were written well and you wanted to see the ending.

I would recommend this movie for anyone.  I think children would be okay with the brief violence.  They is a bit of blood but not gore.

One jar of canned peaches feeds two for ten years? Or at last that is the only time we see the characters eat. Other than the one boy, how does everyone else look so healthy, and for the most part, clean?

7204937,4,B00Y0QOMFO,"Everything about this movie is great except for the villian's compound.  For a strongman monopolizing the resources of an entire valley region, he has precious little manpower at his command and a ""fortress"" another reviewer called the least defended compound in the history of bad guys.  The heroine needlessly submerges herself in a pool of waste to get under the fence when she probably could have walked through the front gate.  After shooting two or three hooded henchmen it's suddenly down to just the strongman and his daughter and they're not even well-armed, leading to the heroine dispatching both in short order.  End of movie.  But everything up to that silly finale was frankly brilliant.  Haley Lu Richardson is great as the defender and provider for an abandoned boy, her boyfriend needing dialysis on a water-starved world and herself.  She guards a single faucet against a madman intent on not just seizing all water sources but on killing everyone else, as well.  All the actors are excellent and give the post-apocalyptic world a sense of reality a la Mad Max.  If only the ending was more inspired- perhaps they ran out of money.

7204939,4,B00Y0QOMFO,"This was a surprisingly good movies in my opinion. The post Apocalypse movie shows the importance of our precious commodities, water.

If this movie is any kind of indicator of human behavior in an actual apocalypse, it defies the theory of Natural Selection and places it all on luck.

7204975,3,B00Y0QOMFO,"This movie is set in dying, dried up land, a land that makes the Outback look hospitable.  It is Oregon ""ten years after the rain stopped.""

The lush landscape and rich farms, including a rice farm, are dried up.  Most people have gone away, and the rest are planning to get out, except they are being systematically murdered so that they won't take water from the underground aquifer and thereby cut into this movie's ""Evil Corp.'s"" profits.

Kendall is a teenage girl who wants to get her sick boyfriend and a waif from another farm out by plane. Why a plane? Who knows? They have a plane but it won't fly until she finds a distributor cap that fits. We also might wonder where she learned to fly.

She spends her day, dodging Evil Corp's fremen-fashioned minions while scavenging for water and a distributor cap.  There are a number of tense moments in this flick because of the dynamics of avoiding Evil Corp's minions.

The final confrontation involves a fairly satisfying fight between our heroine and the forces of Evil Corp.

It is a decent movie, but we shouldn't think too hard about the setting and plot, such as: What happened? Where is the water going? Where's the government in all this? How did a teenage girl learn to fly a plane in the apocalypse? Why couldn't they just fix a car? How about traveling to one of Oregon's many fine rivers?

However, these characters (especially the main character) are running around in a desert environment, constantly in a dehydrated state?... I don't think so.

There is no background story whatsoever as to how this apocalyptic event occurred.  Apparently there hasn't been rain in 10 years.  People are struggling to find water, yet there is no mention or scene of food/eating (except for one canned peach-eating scene).  There are ""hunters"" who  kill people, yet don't eat their meat or drink their blood (or otherwise cleanse it for human consumption).  There are mountains in the distance, which could be reached easily, that have snow on them.

Now, let's examine what would really happen in an apocalyptic situation......  people wouldn't go out of their way to help strangers (especially if it could cost them their life), people wouldn't trust each other, some people would eat each other if there was no  other food, living people would inflict pain on other living people (to include rape and other heinous acts).  Sorry, but this ""apocalyptic"" film is like Disney's version.

This is more like the story of a bunch of peace-loving Quakers who are experiencing a drought and there is one bully in the neighborhood.

NOT AN APOCALYPTIC STORY!",1439683200,4,1347,4.902654867256637
7204991,4,B00Y0QOMFO,"Set in 'Oregon' in the not too distant future.....
Ten Years have past since the last rainfall, the once plush landscape, now baron.....
The Well's baring a few have all dried up, 'Scavengers' cannot be trusted.
There are also those there that hunt down and kill the few that dare to try and share what water remains,
resources are guarded vigorously by people such as 'Carson' (John Gries) daughter 'Brooke' (Nicole Arianna
Fox) and followers.........'Carson' believing what little remains to be his and 'Brooke's'
'Kendal' (Hayley Lu Richardson) along with her companion 'Dean' (Booboo Stewart) who's kidney's are failing
scratch around the Wallace Farm where they had hollowed out a hideaway, the water from the Well is barely
enough to survive upon, so far they have not been detected by 'Carson'
'Kendal' goes out daily to try and find a distributor-cap that will fit on the plane held at the next farm in the valley,
where only young boy 'Alby' (Max Charles) has found a way to survive, if 'Kendal' can find a cap that fits perhaps
she can take 'Dean' and 'Alby' to safety.
But, with the frequent searches made by 'Carson' and his followers for survivors, surely there will come a time when
'Kendal' too will have to kill if she is to survive....
The film is frequently suspenseful and tense and has frequently brutal sequences...........catch it if you can, worth a
viewing for sure.........

7204993,4,B00Y0QOMFO,I had never heard of this movie but took a chance based on reviews and it was a pretty good movie for low budget. Who doesn't like hot chicks kicking the butt out of evil men :) The story was realistic and could eventually happen after the apolocoypse.,1439251200,,252,4.270833333333333
7204994,2,B00Y0QOMFO,"Terribly filmed, entire scenes so dark you can't see anything that's going on - I hate that. Does the director think it cool to have scenes in all black, is that suppose to create suspense, because it doesn't.",1439164800,7,209,4.526315789473684
7204995,3,B00Y0QOMFO,"The world (at least this area) has turned to anarchy as water has become scarce. People survive in destroyed buildings. Kendal (Haley Lu Richardson) survives at the ""Wallace Farm for Wayward Youth"" along with a few others. Is ""wayward"" politically correct? Carson has a large pump and takes the remaining water on the aquifer and hunts and kills any ""parasites"" who dare take his water. Kendal is such a parasite.

The film consists of her strong will to survive and hunting down the right distributor cap for an airplane that they can fly somewhere with water and penguins...from Oregon. Good Luck Amelia. The dialogue was as dry as the desert. The action came in spurts and realistic enough to be boring as boring as ""The Road.""

Not the worst ""Mad Max"" type film out there, but it needed something more like mutants.

No F-bombs that I recall. No sex or nudity. Model Nicole Arianna Fox in tight pants. Booboo Stewart attempts some lines. 2 1/2 stars",1439164800,,953,4.728915662650603
7204996,3,B00Y0QOMFO,"This film starts out slow, but then begins to get more intriguing and exciting.  Give it a chance.  However, the story line is relatively thin, and so this is by no means a great movie: of the post-apocalyptic sort, or by any classification.  Nonetheless, it has respectable characterizations, with very good actors, and an interesting, if a bit pale, premise.  (...)  Do not be fooled by the good reviews, but I would say a decent late night.",1439078400,7,443,4.701298701298701

8717315,4,B00Y0QOMFO,This is a straightforward apocalyptic tale revolving around water scarcity.  It's well made for a modest-to-low budget movie and doesn't try to be more or do more than the script and budget allow. The movie gets good acting out of the main and supporting characters.  The sets are believable with a few exceptions.,1518652800,,314,4.90566037735849

8717319,5,B00Y0QOMFO,"I was really surprised with this low budget apocalyptic movie. No big movie stars, no big budget set. It's set in a desert area where water is scarce and people will, naturally kill for it. One lone girl and her boyfriend are barely surviving in a ramshackled house with the only viable water well for miles. Of course we have a warlord or megalmaniac, same difference, that is determined to either convert everyone to their way of thinking and religion or they kill them. Mostly they kill the old, the weak or jus anyone they believe have slighted them in any way. So yes, lots of dead bodies. This lone girl is tryin desperately to find the one thing that can help her and her friend leave the area without having to walk out, which he can't  since he is very ill. The action is slow, the story line is about what you expect it be, and yet it is a very good little movie as this young lady does her best to survive and protect those around her as well as defend the only water source around for miles.",1493164800,3,1003,4.278947368421052
8717320,3,B00Y0QOMFO,This is the typical post apocalyptic movie.  This time water is the resource people are in desparate need of.  It's not a bad film by any means and there's actually a fair amount of good to it.  It's just that there's so much of the same thing available it's hard to remember that you've watched it as opposed to any other film of the same ilk.,1485043200,,344,4.181818181818182
