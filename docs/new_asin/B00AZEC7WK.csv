8559537,4,B00AZEC7WK,Yep.. you can go to the website and buy a copy of this movie for $20 right from the writer director or pay another ten bucks and get it autographed.  I have no idea how anyone has the stones to want $130 for a used copy.,1380758400,9,220,3.782608695652174
8559538,4,B00AZEC7WK,"Great movie for the nostalgia / hot rod history buff. Fairly predictable plot, and the characters, aside from Faith's amazing role, were pedestrian.  Loved the Bonniville shots and inclusion of the legond Gene Winfield.",1366329600,2,219,5.4411764705882355
8559539,5,B00AZEC7WK,"I can't say enough good about this movie.  It is long, but once you get into it, you realize its a story spanning 50 years.  Though on the outside its about hot rods and the coolness that goes with it, you soon realize its at its heart a love story.  Movie covers love gained, love lost, finding your true love once again.  This movie really hits home...for guys and gals.  Faith did a great job writing, directing, and staring in this film as the woman who finds a long lost hotrod and tries to find the owner given clues hidden in the car.  An amazing story.  Well worth it.  I will note that you can buy this from Faith's website now.  Google her name and the movie.",1359417600,5,669,4.2047244094488185
