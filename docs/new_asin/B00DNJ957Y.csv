5835847,4,B00DNJ957Y,"Babysitter Massacre stares a variety of local talent, several brought in by happening across a Facebook post. Within that pool of talent there were highs and lows. On the low end, a couple of actresses do over emphasize their lines a bit making them seem a little pantomime. On the high end however, there was the likes of Marylee Osborne, an actress not unfamiliar to Henrique Couto's experiments in film, and newcomer to the Couto films, Erin R. Ryan. Both of these women are fantastic to watch but for very different reasons.

Marylee's half buzzed hair and piercings make her visually interesting and her sarcastic wit, which I'm pretty sure isn't all an act, brings much of the humor that is interspersed throughout the film.
Ryan on the other had comes across as the pretty girl next door. The one you can never say no to when she comes collecting for some cause of fundraiser. Together they bookend the film and make getting from one scene to the next a pleasure. They portray the unlikeliest of best friends, but thanks to Henrique's script, you buy into every bit of it!

One last thing I want to mention, and I would be pretty remiss if I didn't, the gore! Amazingly understated to be honest! Not saying there wasn't plenty to be had, but it was done with a great amount of taste and well within the confines of the films minuscule budget. Smartly, no one tried to pull off anything they couldn't achieve believably. Thanks to quick cuts and brilliant make-up work you won't miss the fountains of blood or piles of entrails that are often the norm for this type of movie.

What else to say? Oh! One thing that this film DOES have in abundance is nudity! Couto gives us either blood or boobs every 10 minutes or so to keep the audience interested. Just about every woman in the film gets down to nothing at some point. (I honestly think the nudity wasn't necessary and the film would stand well on its own without it, but hey.. Who am I to argue?)

OK, so my overall rating for Babysitter Massacre? Easily 7.5 out of 10!",1381795200,14,2029,4.520435967302452

5835900,1,B00DNJ957Y,"WARNING: SPOILERS - This is director/screenwriter/editor/cinematographer Henrique Couto (SCAREWAVES - 2014; HAUNTED HOUSE ON SORORITY ROW - 2014; shot in 4 1/2 days and it looks it) film and it is not very good. Seven years ago in the town of Ray Falls, Ohio, a psychopath kidnaps a babysitter named April after being taunted by text messages on her cell phone (I'm not on the house...yet!"") on Halloween Night. She is taking a bath (total nudity, but she is chunky) and the doorbell rings and when he answers the door (with her breasts hanging out from the towel!), the killer, wearing a white fetish mask and white gloves, grabs her and then we see her tied naked to a chair. while the killer pulls out a couple of her fingernails and then slits her throat, documenting the whole thing on April's cell phone camera. In the present day, April's father Mr. Walker (Geoff Burkman) gets a letter in the mail declaring April legally dead (her body was never found) due to ""death by absentia"" by the police force. Mr. Walker says to Angela (Erin R. Ryan; a regular cast member of Couto's shorts and films) that it stings seeing it in letter form. No more police reports. No more insurance investigations looking for fraud. The only comfort he has had in the past seven years was watching next-door neighbor Angela grow up to become a caring young woman. It is Halloween Day once again and Angela plans on having a few friends over that night for a slumber party (Oh, boy!). We then watch a totally naked Angela (who could use something to eat) take a shower (just like we saw the chunky April take a full-frontal bath before she bit it) when a multi-pierced Bianca (Marylee Osborne) scares the s*** out of her. Bianca was the person who was supposed to be April's buddy at the ""Babysitting Club"", which all the girls belonged to, but she let April go out on her own (She tells Angela, ""Survivor's guilt is such a b****!"") and, besides Angela, all the other girls that belonged to the club haven't talked to her in seven years. Angela invites Bianca to come to the slumber party tonight, but make sure she comes a couple of hours late, so the girls are nice and drunk (Anyone ever hear of an ""angry drunk""? Perfect plan Angela!). Now that we have the set-up, let the (off-screen) bloodletting begin. One girl calls up Angela and says she may not show up at the slumber party. She is chased through the woods by the same white-masked and gloved killer (This is the type of film that no matter how fast the victim runs, the slow-walking killer always catches up). The killer first hits the girl in one of her palms with a hand axe and then chops her over and over with it, her blood splattering against a tree (This is also the type of film where we hardly see the actual murders, only the after-effects. He also spray-paints a red ""X"" across her body, but does it to none of his other victims, probably because she was marking a trail in the woods with spray-painting a red ""X"" on trees.). He then uses the victim's camera phone to send pictures to April, who thinks it is the girl's Halloween costume! (By now, if you haven't guessed who the killer is, you are either not watching the film or are sleepy). Linda (Odette Despairr) and boyfriend Tony (David DeNoyer) are discussing whether she should jump in the frigid water of her pool. She comes back inside and says that Tony was correct and she sees the killer, but thinks it is Tony's Halloween costume. She goes upstairs to change and sees Tony's dead body and the killer kidnaps her. She is sitting in a dark room illuminated by one spotlight, where we see (or rather, don't see) the killer slice her tongue with a strait-razor, cut off her ear (all we see is her ear fall to the floor) and then slits her throat (shown as drops of blood hitting the floor). He then takes a photo of Linda and sends it to Angela, who thinks the same thing as before (Two girls with slit throats? Time to rethink your thought-process, Angela!). Angela and her mother (Amy Diederich) have a heart-to-heart (which is hard to take seriously when her Mom is dressed in a see-through outfit, dressed as a Cougar [not the animal kind, if you know what I mean], going to an adult party!). Mom and Angela have a sickly sweet discussion on how Mr. Walker just won't let the death of his daughter go (Mom has these words of wisdom, which will come to bite her in the behind: ""Sadness is like a brace or a crutch. It's a coward's way out.""). Mom leaves the house just as the first girl, Lucky (Jonie Durian), shows up at the slumber party. Bianca tries to have a talk with former Babysitter Club member Sandra (Serendipity Lynch) when she is about to leave work, but Sandra says some unfair and hurtful things to Bianca and she leaves. Sandra sees her boss murdered by the masked killer and then he comes after her. She hides under a desk but the killer stops her from sending a text with her phone and sends Angela a photo of a dead Sandra instead. Arlene (Tara Clark) then joins the slumber party and then there's a knock on the door. At the doorstep is a box full of sexy lingerie, so these three stupid girls put them on (Arlene is the only female in the film that has sexy breasts). Meanwhile, the killer is in the room of a fat woman of the night, so she takes off her clothes (My eyes! My eyes!) and starts eating candy in front of him! For her ""surprise"", he stabs her in her flabby stomach with scissors (again not shown). Bianca use to be the girlfriend of Tyler (Marshall Norman), who is still a pizza delivery guy (what would a film like this be without a pizza delivery guy?) and she wants him to drive her to Angela's house to check up on her (This is after we see the killer murder another girl by pouring boiling water on her face and then getting stabbed in the back of the head where nothing is shown except the after-effects. And then he murders all the people in one of the poorest-looking Halloween parties on film history and kills Angela's mother after she puts on a rubber mask to scare the now-dead crowd [all of it off-screen].) The killer then maces another girl in the eyes who has her mouth duct-taped (one of the most popular tools in every killer's toolbox). It must be something worse than mace because she dies while puke comes seeping through the duct tape on her mouth. Bianca knocks on the door, but no one seems to be home, probably because the killer has chloroformed all three of them and taken them down to the basement. Lucky is tied to a chair and says the only way the other two will be let go is if one of them kills her with the claw hammer on the floor. Arlene seems a little too into it, as she whacks Lucky in the head a few times and then plants the claw end on the hammer into her chest [off-screen], killing her. Oh, and if you haven't guessed by now, Mr. Walker is the killer (although it is plain to see that the killer is played by a much younger person [actually three!]). He strangles Arlene and then cuts Angela's Achilles heels and pours gasoline on the floor so she can't get away. Why did he kill his own daughter seven years ago? Because he loved Angela more! (One of the worst explanations I have ever heard!). Angela stabs Mr. Walker and Bianca has a chance to rescue Angela, but Mr. Walker lights his Bic and the house burns to the ground. Once again, Bianca fails to save a friend. And luckier for us, the film ends.  It's apparent Henrique Couto watched films like THE SLUMBER PARTY MASSACRE (1982) and SORORITY HOUSE MASSACRE (1986; SORORITY HOUSE MASSACRE 2 [1990] gets name-checked here) and there's not one cliche that he missed, but what he did forget was showing the killer actually doing the killing, not just showing us the results of his kills, which is very aggravating for the viewer. This is a very long 78 minutes and the film is boring and stupid. The one way you can tell is that you watch the clock more than the film itself. The stench I smelled wasn't coming from my streaming player overheating, it was coming from the film itself. Only Arlene's breasts are worth looking at. Dustin Mills, the director of the excellent SKINLESS (2013), did the not-so-special special makeup effects. Also starring Stephanie Coffey, Chandra McCracken, Haley Jay Madison, Mike Canestaro and Stephanie Michael. An Independent Entertainment DVD Release. Not Rated, but no worse than an R.",1449878400,,8375,4.477436232831916

5835925,1,B00DNJ957Y,"So this was a really terrible attempt at making an 80's style horror. I can not tell if this production was going for a skin-a-max time slot or wanted to be taken serious.

First off on the technical side of the house, the folly was horrible to point I could not watch as it hurt my ears. Videography was the only thing in the film that was decent, The writing and acting where god awful, but the production did follow some of the horror rules and the buckets of corn syrup were on hand.

The over use of nudity was off putting right from the get go and hurt the film right off the bat and the director forgot about one the industry's golden rule less is more; i.e. what is in the suitcase in Pulp Fiction.

5835938,5,B00DNJ957Y,"I have a good bit to say about this film. let me start off with the people who made this film happen. (whoever I mainly can tag without facebook being stupid on me again)
Erin-you are now in my top 5 fav female actresses. you really did such a great job in this film. I loved your character. really brought her to life. I really felt for her, so I am putting you at the #1. Keep up the good work.
Marylee-your characters hair is bad a$$. and if thats just how you do your hair then I love your style!!!! >;D your character was a bad ass, spoke her mind, I like that in people in general. I like for people to speak the truth. so I give you a thumbs up=D. you did ggrrrreeat!!!
Haley-you are my #2 of my fav scream queen actors. You really did a great job! I enjoyed your work in Haunted House on Sorority Row and I liked it in Babysitter Massacre, even though you were not in it for long.
Joni Durian-You did great. I liked your character.  I also enjoyed you in HHOSR.
and lets not forget the wonderful director himself Henrique Couto
what a great job you did man. I now have a new fav halloween film to watch every year. This film was so classic and fun! really liked it a bunch.
and now the final review. The storyline was classic, loved it. the effects they did looked really good and make me flinch a little at some points. I loved it from start to finish. I love how the killer takes out his victims. All the halloween effects and decorations. if anyone is wondering about the plot. here it is- A group of young women teamed together in their youth to run a babysitting business, when one of their friends died suddenly the group fell apart. Now years later they are all going their separate ways as college approaches, but on Halloween night someone is torturing and killing every member of the babysitter club...I kinda saw the reveling of the killer coming but I wasn't 100% sure which person it was.
so I give this a 10/10 for fun, gory, scary, indie good fun.

It's worth the money and the time.",1413849600,3,2035,4.231362467866324

The plot is standard, but it moves fast. It also has many surprises, interesting characters, as well as pretty girls. I like the fact they look like real people, not models..

A babysitters club in their younger years, the group of girls was shaken by the loss of one of their friends, April, a loss that remains unexplained. Inner fighting leads to one of them, Bianca, being ousted and blamed for April's death. She now see's visions of April's killer and strives to find the truth behind what happened and protect the remaining members of the Babysitter club on Halloween night. One by one, girls begin disappearing until only 3 remain, and they must fight for their lives against a masked maniac.

Visonary Henrique Couto puts it all out there in this masterpiece. An independant, low-budget film without many of the ""flaws"" pupularly disliked in those films, Babysitter Massacre will leave you enthralled from start to finish. A phenomenal cast brilliantly brings to life a gripping tale of a sick man willing to go to the furthest lengths for love. The musical score composed and preformed by Buzz Amato and Rick Hinkle further add to the errieness of this haunting film as well as special effects by Erica Blackstock and Jacklyn Alexa to leave all those fans of gore satisfied.

5836016,3,B00DNJ957Y,"Despite having a budget that would deem it a ""micro-budget"" film, BABYSITTER MASSACRE takes what little resources it has and offers up a little slice of horror cake every fan will enjoy.

The kills, despite being a little lacking on the effects side, come swiftly and often, with someone getting offed pretty much every 8-10 minutes.  Director Henrique Couto really knows how to pace a slasher film, by catering to fans of the genre with tons of the red stuff. Theres really so much carnage that its easy to ignore some of the odd camera angles and occasional bad lighting.

The writing is really the only weak point of the film, but given the type of film, this really just emphasizes need to watch it out of pure entertainment.  It probably doesnt help that some of the acting seemed to be done by people whove maybe drove by a school for theatre, but have never set foot in an acting class.  With the exception of one mall punk chick who could act as the poster child for zoloft, most of the acting is sub-par.  Again, that doesnt really hurt this film.

Last but certainly not least, are the girls, and this movie has quite an assortment of female flesh to offer. Pretty much every female in the film is nude, or at least topless, with satisfying results.  The most refreshing thing is that, while (most) of the girls are attractive, they're not the fake, mainstream hollywood hot. You actually could see these girls in your neighborhood ( no fake tits and collagen lips here )

All in all, if your a fan of the slasher genre and have a itch for indie titles, this is a good film to film to watch.  As a precaution, Id reccomend you checking this one out with your boys, some pizza, and a case of beer, on one of those thursday night movie marathons.

5836017,2,B00DNJ957Y,"This showed up as a 3+ Star recommendation -- it is a base lie.  This is a low budget, low production value, poorly acted movie.  The plot has holes you can drive a semi truck through and little, if anything, is explained at the end.

I will give it more than one star because it had ""real"" size women -- not anorexic stick figures and a few interesting ideas that raise this awful movie to the merely meh factor.

Plot . spoilers (and the word plot is used liberally)

Apparently, with no background, there was a babysitter's club of 14 year old girls from the local town.  At halloween, two went out to trick or treat and some creepy white masked guy apparently kidnapped one of the girls.

Now, seven years later, the missing girl has been pronounced dead by authorities,.  The girl that was with her at the time is largely a pariah but has maintained friendship with ""the girl next door"".

I find that trying to explain this movie is giving me a headache.  Suffice to say that someone in the plain white head mask is capturing and/or murdering the members of this former circle of babysitters -- all in the name of true love (you don't really want to know more, but you will probably watch anyway).  In a bit of a nod to standard horror tropes, several of the victims get naked before they are killed (I can't call this a redeeming quality, but it is what it is).  This skirts into torture porn and would be disturbing if the production values were greater.  Since I actually sat through this movie, I must give it two stars, but any score above this has to be someone that gives high ratings to gratuitous nudity or thinks any ""horror"" movie must receive top ratings

5836040,5,B00DNJ957Y,"I can't review ""Babysitter Massacre"" as an homage/love letter to the slasher film genre because I'm not extremely knowledgeable about the genre, but I can review it as the high-quality micro-budget film that it is.

If you'll indulge me for a minute, I need to get one thing out of the way. Some 1-star reviewers have compared this film unfavorably to a bad home movie. This is simply ridiculous.

Also I can't help but notice that most of these reviewers streamed the film for free through Amazon Prime. Why drag a film through the ground when watching it provides you 90 minutes of entertainment and distraction at virtually no cost to you? Or if you're going to pan the film, at least have something of value to say... If this movie didn't have enough nudity or good-looking girls for you (trust me, there's plenty of both), then just go watch the movie you really want to watch. They usually involve no plotlines and half-fake bodies.

But I digress...

""Babysitter Massacre"" features an ensemble cast of local actors. The story revolves largely around three central characters, however, and each of these actors delivers strong and sometimes even standout performances. This is due in no small part to the quality of Henrique Couto's writing, which is always competent, and occasionally profound. Watch the scene between Angela (Erin R Ryan) and her mother (played by Amy Diederich); the dialogue is warm and poignant, and in the context of the death and destruction that occurs, ultimately tragic. That reminds me to mention that there are a number of strong performances from some of the smaller roles as well.

Production quality is good and holds up well on a home TV screen. Picture quality is a bit soft, but the film is still well-shot with solid lighting strong color, and even a couple moments that push it securely away from foolish home-movie comparisons. (Opening crane shot anyone? How about digital fire effects?). Sound design is quite good. Vocals are clear and audible, foley effects are appropriately discomforting during the torture scenes, and the original score by Buzz Amato and Rick Hinkle really stands out and raises the drama and enjoyment by several strong notches.

All in all, this is a solid micro-budget film from a strong and truly independent director, and it succeeds on the quality of the writing, the strong performances, and the cringe-inducing moments that seem to pull it confidently into the genre to which it pays a macabre and joyful homage. Any who appreciate underground film and/or the genre are encouraged to give this one at least two focused viewings.",1391817600,2,2604,4.933789954337899

The script is horrible; the acting, when it's not overdone, is horrible; the direction is horrible; the story, such as it is, is horrible and plot holes abound.
As a matter of very little interest, I know it's supposed to be some sort of babysitter club but only one actual babysitter gets massacred - after taking a bath that hardly reaches her knees. That really moved the story along.

5836045,2,B00DNJ957Y,"Okay, first let me confess I like campy and even bad Indie horror movies. This film must have gotten a great deal of talent of local talent from somewhere yet I don't know exactly where that is. There are two high talents and lots of lows in the talent pool. Marylee Osborne and Erin R. Ray are the better talents.  Both of these women are interesting to watch yet for very different reasons and motivations.

Ms Osborne's buzzed hair, many piercings make her appear to be the quintessential token lesbian punker scorned by her former friends and she has a sarcastic wit intertwined with humor.

Ms. Ryan is that girl next door we all wish we had met in our younger years. As one commentor says, ""The one you can never say no to when she comes collecting for some cause of fundraiser.""

The script ties the two together in an unlikely pairing as friends.

The gore in this film is beyond the pale and not very realistic. Sadistic ways of killing women or anyone for that matter should at least have some reason behind it. If you try to behaviorally profile why the killer would proceed as he does you would be amiss in about every assumption you make and I am a behavioral psychologist making this observation!!!

It is hard to believe that women some how end up in the predicament they do without any struggle, there is no evidence of police involvement and some how tey even get one of the women at the near climax to kill two of her friends with no explanation as to why. The ""killer"" is none other than the one person you probably suspect early on but I confess you must wait to put all the clues together to finally decide it is who you think it might be.

There is an over abundance of nudity! Couto gives you blood or boobs every few minutes or so to keep an infantile audience interested. If you are in to T&A this film should be high on your list and you have an abundance of female body types to view. You also have girls pillow fighting and trying on lingerie and parading before each other, which you think at some point may lead to a lesbian sex scene, which never happens. There are firm bodies and not so and all of them have a different set of mammary glands for your review.

Sadly, as much as I like campy, and even bad horror movies I find it incredibly hard to believe that some one found the money to produce this film, one without a plot or even reasonable dialogue most of the time. Sadly, the scorned lesbian, punk rocker portrayed by Ms Osborne never finds peace.

Babysitter Massacre is a love letter to the Sorority House Massacre films (particularly the second one) from Dayton, Ohio director Henrique Couto that more than surpasses its inspiration by remaining faithful to the feel of an 80s slasher effort and updating it to the conventions of today's horror as well.  It is a fast paced film that moves like gangbusters, chock full of brutal gore and gorgeous fanservice.

The films greatest strengths are a smart script with great dialogue and a fantastic cast of lovely ladies headlined by Erin R. Ryan,  Joni Durian, and Marylee Osborne backed by some great supporting cast mates (Amy Taint in particular, she and Erin have a scene of mother-daughter bonding that really rises above typical slasher film fare).

The first one was Bleeding Though and that was more psychological then straight up horror. This film harkens back to the early days of the slasher genre in the 80's. It reminds of such films like the Prowler and Sleepaway Camp. It follows a group of likeable characters that are slowly being butchered by an unseen assailant (and I do mean butchered). You can see that Henrique has a love for these types of films and he pours that love into this film. It is nice to see how good something can be when it is done by a true fan of the genre.

The basic premise is of a group of girls that put together a babysitters club when they were younger. One, extremely cold Halloween night all of the girls decided it was too cold to trick or treat. Except Bianca (Marylee Osborne). She wanted to go out so her friend went with her. Then a white masked killer took her friend and Bianca ran for her life.
Seven years later and she is now been ostracized by the group, except for Angela (Erin R. Ryan). It is Halloween and they are planning a reunion of the babysitters club.
Someone else is also planning a little reunion.
The white faced killer from seven years ago is back.
No one is safe.
There are two kinds of slasher films. The basic, unstoppable killer type and the one that is more human. The one that has some God awful motive in the twisted sense of the word. Those are fun because you can try and guess who the killer is.
I did, but not until I was supposed to. Well done, Mr. Couto.
The gore set pieces are incredible to watch. I was most fond of the boiling water on the head that resulted in some wicked bubbly skin effect. It looked seamless to me and having been a burn victim, pretty spot on. Fingernail pulling always makes me squirm and it was at this point that I realized that the foley work was excellent. Not too big of a surprise as Mr. Couto's years of experience as a musician would lend itself well to this particular aspect of film making.
We drove 600 miles round trip to see this movie. We always go see Henrique's world premieres. It's just a thing that is done at The Waltz Compound. And we have yet to be disappointed.

No one is safe.
There are two kinds of slasher films. The basic, unstoppable killer type and the one that is more human. The one that has some God awful motive in the twisted sense of the word. Those are fun because you can try and guess who the killer is.
I did, but not until I was supposed to. Well done, Mr. Couto.
The gore set pieces are incredible to watch. I was most fond of the boiling water on the head that resulted in some wicked bubbly skin effect. It looked seamless to me and having been a burn victim, pretty spot on. Fingernail pulling always makes me squirm and it was at this point that I realized that the foley work was excellent. Not too big of a surprise as Mr. Couto's years of experience as a musician would lend itself well to this particular aspect of film making.
We drove 600 miles round trip to see this movie. We always go see Henrique's world premieres. It's just a thing that is done at The Waltz Compound. And we have yet to be disappointed.
Oh, and the most important part of a slasher movie is two fold; Boobs and Blood. All I can say is that Mr. Couto embraced the formula and both of these requirements were met with spectacular results.

It holds up to the name and is proudly displayed in my Massacre Collection. Don't let this gem pass you by!",1388016000,,296,4.303571428571429
5836111,5,B00DNJ957Y,"Another compelling release from writer/ director Henrique Couto who gave us the indie cult masterpiece ""Depression The Movie'' If you are a fan of high paced indie slashers this is the film for you. Harking back to the days where maniacs and slasher films ruled the cinemas and televisions across homes in america. Be good to yourself this season, rent this movie, you won't be sorry.

It was a breath of fresh air when all that's come out has been garbage and remakes lately. The movie flew off the shelves at the FYE near my home.",1388016000,2,296,4.2105263157894735
5836113,5,B00DNJ957Y,"If you grew up watching the slasher flicks of the 70's and 80's like I did, you will appreciate the sheer fun of this movie! This movie proves that with minimal budget, and an obviously fun attitude while filming, a talented director can help perfectly recreate the fun of a psycho slasher flick of yore. Kudos to everyone involved!",1388016000,2,332,4.6440677966101696
5836114,1,B00DNJ957Y,"Wow, what a terrible, stupid movie.  The first chunk is a lot of scenes of bad exposition in which people tell each other things they already know.  But don't worry they just sit there as they talk so it's not visually dynamic or anything, so if you're concerned about your bad heart, you won't get too excited so you'll be fine.  And then the first two thirds is mostly filled with random people the director conned into getting naked being killed.  And then we have our leads who wear lingerie in a house and aren't involved with any of the stuff going on, and don't know about any of the murders, so we get to see them have conversations about bnot being assertive enough, like a Lifetime movie shot on a camcorder.  We also have some angry girl who runs around (that's pretty much her function).  Then in the last twenty minutes someone figured hey, we should have something happen to the lead characters!  So the killer shows up and it's a surprise because it's the most obvious and pretty much only person it could be.  Why is that a surprise when it was so obvious?  Because knowing it was THAT obvious you'd think the filmmakers would spend an extra two minutes to come up with something better, but they have weed to smoke so hard work is out!  We cap it all off with an ending that's amazingly pointless.  I'm so glad I have Prime and didn't rent this dumb garbage.  I'd be shocked if they had more than a two page outline for the script.  And it looked like they used strawberry ice cream topping for blood.",1387756800,5,1518,4.397849462365591
5836115,4,B00DNJ957Y,"Seven years ago April was killed on Halloween by an unknown assailant. She was part of the babysitters club. Now they are being killed off with only one suspect.

The film lacked the dialog to be a classic, yet at the same time had some weird scenes like the candy scene with Stephanie Michael. The slasher aspect was mediocre. What the film had going for it was an abundance of nudity of healthy girls.

Parental Guide: F-bomb, No sex. Full frontal nudity (Erin R. Ryan, Tara Clark, Odette Despairr, Stephanie Michael, Joni Durian)

3 1/2 stars for the nudity.",1387584000,,561,4.646464646464646
5836116,1,B00DNJ957Y,"I'm a longtime fan of horror films (especially the slasher genre), and I have to say that this was one of the absolute worst films I have ever seen in my life. The acting was worse than the average high school production of ""Grease"", the effects were less than believable, and the mystery as to who is doing the killing is no mystery at all.... his identity is pretty obvious from the start. I could go on and on, but I've wasted enough of my time already on this piece of trash. Do yourself a favor, and spend your hard-earned money on a better film..... there are plenty to choose from out there.",1387584000,4,598,4.300884955752212

This is an excellent low budget horror film that is extremely well done.  It is my favorite Henrique Couto film so far.  The cast did an excellent job and Couto doesn't hold back on the gore.  This movie reminds me of the horror movies that I grew up with in the 80's:  lots of gore and nudity, but this story is a lot better than a majority of the films in the 80's.  I am excited to see what Mr. Couto comes up with next.",1387324800,2,536,4.009433962264151

The director obviously decided the best way to keep the movie moving forward was to introduce a constant stream of nude girls as victim's in waiting. If you've got 78 minutes to kill and don't mind cliche slasher flicks, you could do a lot worse.",1484524800,4,413,4.3076923076923075
