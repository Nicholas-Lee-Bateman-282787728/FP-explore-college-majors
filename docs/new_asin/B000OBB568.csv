I was a bit disappointed not to be able to get it on dvd but happy to have been able to get it at all.  It is a relaxing meditation-type exercise called T'ai Chi Chih, and the background sounds
are an added bonus.  I am enjoying it on a daily basis.  It is absolutely wonderful.",1360454400,,465,3.967741935483871
8184173,1,B000OBB568,"This is the second time I have written a review about this tape.  I am an accredited T'ai Chi Chih teacher, and am totally embarrassed by this DVD.  This woman doesn't know what she is doing and has obviously never been back for any workshops to correct her poor execution.  This is shameful.",1308960000,,292,4.471698113207547
