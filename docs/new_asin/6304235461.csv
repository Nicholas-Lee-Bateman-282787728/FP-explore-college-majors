There's nothing wrong with making a film overseas, but don't be fooled by any kind words you read later - this movie is very cheap. To its credit, all of its efforts have been focused on making it a veritable action opus by skimping on everything that doesn't directly involve punches or kicks, but even its abundance of martial flurries might not be enough to make viewers look beyond its faults.

The story: Security specialist Nancy Bolan (Rothrock) is hired to carry a top-secret computer into Indonesia. When she's thrice-thwarted by a sadistic criminal mastermind looking to take possession of the equipment (Peter O'Brian,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Stabilizer/dp/B00008O2Z3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Stabilizer</a>), she realizes that the only way to thwart his plans is through direct, physical confrontation.

To consider this movie positively is to look at it as seat-of-the-pants filmmaking at its finest. Besides having that filmed-in-the-'70s porno look to it, ""Angel of Fury"" is a comedy of errors when it comes to plot and production values. The least of its concerns is its acting content, which wasn't important to begin with but features Rothrock's signature poor performance and an entire cast of voice-dubbed Indonesian nationals. Transitions between scenes are very rough, so that there's absolutely no buildup to, say, Cynthia getting mugged on the street - just a shot of her walking along followed by a shot of some goon grabbing her briefcase. This carries over to the fight scenes, where it's occasionally hard to tell if the person being kicked is a villain or just some bystander who got in Cynthia's way. There are a few logic-bending scenes, like when Cynthia is drugged and wakes up on an island, where she's promptly attacked by goons before being grabbed from behind by...her thought-dead ex-lover who proceeds to kiss her on the lips? There's another little gem scene where a young child is kidnapped in a shopping mall: the little girl screams bloody murder for three straight minutes as she's carried through a crowd of people, and absolutely nobody seems concerned enough to come to her aid!

As painfully entertaining as all of that is, it's all delivered as side-attractions to what feels like one long action scene. In total, there are six separate hand-to-hand fight brawls, three shootouts, one boat chase, and one car/motorcycle chase - all of which delivered without flair but with plenty joyful abandon. The fistfights aren't overly creative but are definitely modeled after the Hong Kong action style that Cynthia's best known for, letting her show off a lot of kicks. The shootouts aren't too interesting, but the final gunfight features some intervals of unnecessarily sped-up footage, so that the scene looks like a particularly violent episode of ""The Little Rascals."" Quantity trumps quality here, but the content is good enough to appreciate, even though it's not going to make you forget any of Cynthia's better work.

This used to be one of those films that you rented on a whim without really knowing what it was about, but nowadays it's one you have to hunt for. Fans of Rothrock can definitely do a lot better, but for the sake of one of her more exotic romps, pick it up for a laugh.",1265068800,,3808,5.5944540727902945
7865832,1,6304235461,Horribly dubbed film has Rothrock trying to stop a terrorist from stealing a super computer.  Some good action scenes are negated by sloppy editing and too much violence- including a child's murder.  Even the normally reliable Rothrock cannot save this.,1031788800,,253,5.3
7865833,3,6304235461,"Angel of Fury (or LadyDragon II in the states)is an interesting movie for fans of Cynthia Rothrock. It has all the high kicking and fast punching action you would expect from her.
The movie starts with two different scenes one a kickboxing match and the other a scene where the three bad guys kill two mob guys for a load of diamonds. The bad guys place the diamonds in the luggage of Susan (Cynthia)and her husband and follow them home. Where they torture and basically rape Susan. After the main villian kills her husband Susan sysmatically gains vengence by killing the bad guys one by one. All until the final exiting climax at the end",1012348800,3,639,4.565217391304348
