7807003,4,6300217639,"This opera doesn't find its way to the stage very much, but I fell in love with this video version and look forward to seeing it live somewhere.  The first act sets the stage with a great Pre-Raphaelite look, as Francesca and  Paolo meet and begin their doomed love.  The music, highly melodic in the  first and final acts, is charged with drama.  In between, you have the  brutal scenes of war, hate, violence--with Paolo's brothers, a nasty pair,  contrasting nicely with the languid beauty of the two lovers' encounters.  This is truly a case where the sets and costumes create a jewel-like  setting for the sensual emotions displayed in Zandonai's music.",953683200,19,658,4.803571428571429
