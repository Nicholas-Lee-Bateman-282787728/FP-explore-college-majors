If you enjoy modern art museums and are especially affected by random splashes of paint on a canvas, then this movie will not waste 69 min of your life.  This is, by far, the most boring film van Sant has ever made.  My wife nodded off within 20 min of the start, and I had to force myself to find reasons to actually complete all 84 min.  Also, before anyone accuses me of being an action film junkie unable to assimilate intricate character development and plot execution, I'm far from that.

Based on Blake Nelson's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Paranoid-Park/dp/0142411566/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Paranoid Park</a>&nbsp;and written and directed by Gus Van Sant. 60th Anniversary Prize in Cannes in 2007. A young skateboarder kills by accident a security guard. During the next days, he will try to find a way to formulate his guilt-feelings. Another movie about American teens by one of the most important modern American directors. By mixing Super 8 and 35 mm footage, making space go to pieces with multiple cameras filming the same scene and time by adopting a non linear narration line, Gus van Sant doesn't choose the easy way to galvanize our curiosity. I thank him for that. Highly recommended.

I saw this film on a zone 2 DVD, collector edition, available at Amazon.fr.",1214438400,8,846,5.82258064516129
3147495,4,B0015VI3CU,"Paranoid Park is Gus Van Sant's twelfth feature film, and the third in his recent films about disaffected youth.  Adapted from a novel by Portland writer Blake Nelson and obviously inspired by Crime and Punishment, Paranoid Park follows the life Alex, a local skate punk who gets tangled up in a grisly accident.

The thin plot has Alex, played by Gabe Nevins, attracted to Paranoid Park, a skate park that was built illegally by punks, skaters, and other riff raff.  Alex goes there one night alone, and is essentially picked up by some shady characters.  Without spoiling anything, he does something terrible and spends the rest of the movie trying to cope, mainly by writing out what happened in a letter to one of his friends.  Paranoid Park represents a place where Alex feels that he can belong.  He expresses how much he's attracted to the type of people who skate there, and he yearns to belong to their subculture, yet he never manages to find his place.

His writing literally drives the plot, as what he's writing down in his letter is what we experience as an audience.  The focus of Paranoid Park is decidedly insular.  Built around a series of disorienting techniques like dialogue overlaid with music, one sided dialogues where the other person is either obscured or off camera all together, long takes of Alex walking alone with a musical backdrop, and close-ups of Alex's blank stare,  Alex's inner life is shown as a sort of dreamy and hazy numbness.  His disaffection and guilt is not really expressed very effectively even in his diary, and the visual techniques of the film serve as one of the only windows in to his mind set.

Just like Elephant and Last Days, Van Sant is concerned with the seemingly existential existence of modern young people.  Not only is Alex not coping too well with his deed despite his journal confession, he's also not coping with his parents divorce, and not coping with his superficial and sexual forward girlfriend.  He can't express himself at all.  A breakdown of language is a well trodden theme in existential literature, and the characters in Paranoid Park don't do a whole heck of a lot of communicating.  Particularly evident is Alex's trouble communicating with the females in his life.  He can't talk to his mother, whose face isn't even seen except as a hazy outline, he can't talk to his girlfriend Jennifer and feels nothing towards her, or his friend Macy who urges him to open up, yet he can't bring himself to share his secret with her even if it would have helped.  Alex doesn't share his feelings or what happened, and he ends up being a depressed and blank teenager who'll end up being a dysfunctional adult, just like his parents.

Paranoid Park works well as an experimental take on a Crime and Punishment style story about inner torment.  Most of the actors were found on myspace with the exception of Taylor Momsen as Alex's girlfriend Jennifer, who surprisingly enough plays a sexual forward young girl on Gossip Girl.  Nevins is good as Alex, who's main job is to act like a typical teenager and to show off a numbed exterior.  The acting isn't stellar but it's authentic enough.  There might be a bit too much of the solitary slow motion shots of Alex, and maybe a bit too much style or substance with all of the arty and experimental camera work.  When Van Sant shows us the fifth or sixth slow motion walking shot of Alex overlayed with Elliott Smith or Nino Rota it got a little tiresome.  The pace is also very slow, which might turn off some folks wanting a more driven plot.

This is Van Sant's best effort in a long time, and it's definitely worth seeing if you can tolerate a little introspection and a slow pace.",1208390400,9,3698,4.659476117103236
3147496,4,B0015VI3CU,"Paranoid Park is an unpredictable, fresh film from Gus Van Sant that tells the story of introspective-teen Alex's struggles with life as he gets involved with the killing of a train station security guard.  The whole film hitches on the performance of its star, Gabe Nevins; fortunately, Nevins is in just about every scene of the movie.  Nevins is an absolute newcomer to movie-acting, but he works perfectly here.  Every scene that he's in, the viewer is completely captured in his quiet, emotional turmoil.  Nevins' big, beautiful, sulky eyes tell a story all their own.  He's wonderful.

Unfortunately, the other young actors are not so comfortable or capable in front of the camera.  They are genuine enough though for it to be forgiven though.  The real problem here is Van Sant, who's cinematography is trying far too hard to ""look"" independent.  The goofy camera angles and Van Sant's trademark moving-angle/moving-actor camerawork seem un-natural and distract from developing the characters more (which is where more focus was needed).  The story jumps forwards and backwards in time so much that sometimes you don't know when you are, but once you've figured the chronology out, that's not a big complaint for me.

Overall, the film is a success.  It's a reasonable enough story with interesting characters that's well-held-together by an amazing and fresh young performance by Gabe Nevins (just watching him is reason enough to see this movie).  As a bonus, the material he's acting out is unique and interesting.  A solid thumbs-up purchase for me.  Hopefully we see more of this young actor in the future.",1208044800,,1618,5.075757575757576
3147497,5,B0015VI3CU,"Alex, the narrarator and protagonist of ""Paranoid Park"", is not your typical romanticised culluloid teen. He is quiet, introspective, and near mute when it comes to verbalizing his feelings. He is the antithesis of a sullen, vapid adolescent skater. On the contrary, I found his parents to be vapid. When he speaks to them, what they say hardly makes an impact, because their efforts to really get through to him are ineffective. It's like carrying out an inane conversation with a stranger in which nothing is really said. Pleasantries are exchanged, but little beyond superficial subjects is broached.
  The aftershock of a gruesome accident has left Alex shell-shocked. The entire film is about the way guilt haunts him like a shadowy executioner. Close-ups of his friends' faces emphasize the way he searches their expressions for the slightest hint of accusation. Alex lives in a world that offers little joy. His parents are getting divorced, and he has dislocated himself to the lonely confines of a journal. The journal is his confidante, his only witness to paralyzing emotions that stalk him during his waking hours.
  Alex's character is not glorified in any way. He is awkward like most teens, he is not an expert skateboarder, and is reluctant to venture down the concrete slopes of the skate park carved under a colossal bridge. He is drawn toward Paranoid park because he seeks something resembling companionship and family. Jumping a boxcar leads to a fatal and grisly accident. Alex must live with the consequences of this mistake, which leads to intriguing questions about morality and the complexities of unintentional manslaughter. Gus Van Sant is not interested in the cogs of the judicial system, however, he is interested in the tormented machinery ticking away inside the young skater's head. Every aspect of reality is overshadowed by shame.
  A scene in which Alex dissociates in a hot shower was compelling because every part of his body seemed to be weeping, except for his eyes, as if they were afraid to betray his secret. He wanders through gloomy rooms, turning on lights almost as an afterthought. When he has sex with his girlfriend, he does so in a stupor. Immediately afterward, she gets up and brags to her friend on the phone that it was ""fantastic"". To Alex it did little to penetrate the numbness soaking his body. A nimble detective questions him in a way that makes him suspect if he is found guilty, a vast nothing will swallow him. Faces and eyes and vague gestures judge him at every opportunity. Bizarre music in the background informs us that Alex is supposed to be feeling happy or sad, but his facial expression remains flat; incapable of smiling.
  Gabe Nevins is an expressive actor who captures Alex's blank affect perfectly. He has an extremely difficult task in trying to capture Alex's mental state through posture and facial expressions, rather than simple words. His relationships with family and friends are so meaningless he has no one to confess to, so he buries his suffering to keep from being injured by emotions that are unfamiliar and threatening. Many will complain that the film moves at a snail's pace, but I think this is intentional: the director is submerging us in Alex's psyche, his dread and depression making situations slog by as if mired in quicksand.",1206230400,25,3328,4.951612903225806
3147498,3,B0015VI3CU,"The novel by blake Nelson is much more interesing and thrilling than Gus van Stant's film.  The latter does not succeed in conveying the protagonist's moral turmoil and the pressure exerted on him by the investigator's pretended friendliness and his continuous attempt to make the protagonist blab and give himself away. It also lacks the reader's/viewer's surprising recognition that all the letters have been written to Macy Mc Laughlin - the girl the narrator has always seemed to hate.
What the film contains is an irritating amount of music which hardly ever fits the scene it goes with, drowning out even the most important dialogues.",1383350400,,640,5.095238095238095
3147499,3,B0015VI3CU,"Paranoid Park is a pretty boring movie overall.  What definitely had potential in the concept quickly deteriorated when it was soon realized that the writers are going for an actual laidback ""skateboarder type"" environment.

You see the storyline is supposed to be about a security guard who mysteriously dies as a result of a skateboarder making a horrible mistake.  The investigation team comes to the school to determine the involvement the skateboarders had in the mans death, however that element (that *crucial* element) was never developed enough.  In fact the police were WAY too easy on the kids who obviously showed total disrespect towards them by mocking them in the classroom in one segment and never taking anything serious enough.

A man dies under tragic circumstances and *none* of the skateboarders shed any tears or showed any remorse whatsoever.  I don't care how cool or hip it is being among the skateboarding crowd- a lack of human emotions is totally unrealistic.

In fact the one investigator only came to the school twice- the REST of the movie was devoted to the skateboarders supposedly retracing their steps pertaining to the death of the security guard, but we the viewers have to sit through a LOT of pointlessness involving the one skateboarders girlfriend and their relationship, and tricks being performed at the downtown park in slow-motion for dramatic effect, and a few trips to the local mall.  NONE of these things advance the storyline whatsoever.

Oh, and a good ending could have saved the movie at least somewhat, but... no, that ending is really terrible and accomplishes nothing.  Basically this is a crime drama for the teenage crowd.  Had I known I never would have watched it.",1329955200,,1724,5.014035087719298
3147500,3,B0015VI3CU,"*What if something so terrible happens that you can't tell anyone? Yet it's too much of a burden to keep to yourself? That's the dilemma facing teenaged Alex (Gabe Nevins) in the chillingly plausible, very realistic film Paranoid Park.

Alex is a normal kid, and an avid skateboarder. The crowd he hangs with are always chasing the next adrenaline thrill. One popular spot they congregate to hone their boarding skills is in a bad part of town they've nicknamed ""Paranoid Park"". Definitely not a hangout their parents would approve of, so they usually sneak off there when they're supposed to be at other places.

One fateful night when Alex was supposedly at a sleepover at his friend Jared's (Jake Miller) house, they were instead out boarding at Paranoid Park. Some friends brought up an extreme but dangerous alternative to boarding, called Train Jumping at the adjacent tracks. Yes, it's exactly what it sounded like, the thrill seekers were jumping onto moving trains and hitching short rides. But while they were doing this, a security guard at the tracks ends up dead.

What at first appears to be a tragic accident may be something more, and police are following up saying that it was foul play, and that it had something to do with the skateboarders.

Police officials relentlessly question all the teens, find out about the subculture and that particular bad-news bit of real estate. The one thing they suspect although they can't get any information from the closely knit group is that Alex may know more than he's letting on.

Through a series of flashbacks, we follow Alex's memories of the night and the guard's death, little by little, and the final pieces of the puzzle don't come together until the end. Not revealing anything more, I can tell you that the end sent chills down my very spine.

This was so real, so plausible it haunted me for days after seeing it. The storyline is strong, and deeply rooted in suspense. Definitely worth at least one watch.

3147501,4,B0015VI3CU,"What I like most about this movie is the realistic portrayal of a sullen teenager. You notice firsthand his lack of writing skill as he narrates a letter describing his horrific mistake. This is a wonderful touch to the matter-of-fact awareness he can express to the best of his ability. When the accident occurs, I actually gasped in shock and covered my mouth with my hand.

3147502,1,B0015VI3CU,"This was a complete waste of time. The narrative and acting was well beyond below level and if I could give this film negative stars I would. During almost all of the narrative parts of the film, it sounded as if the""actor"" was reading off of a piece of paper and stumbling over what he was supposed to be saying while he had the same facial expression throughout the entire film. Utterly disappointed.

Without giving too much away, let me just say the film is slow and deliberate, inviting the viewer into a dark world. Van Sant bravely allows the camera to linger on scenes, seducing the viewer into the minds of his characters. There are beautiful moments of single-take skates through the park, shot with a home movie, 16 mm quality contrasted with the sterile, but majestically shot slow, day-to-day events that unfold to reveal the answers to the dark mystery at the heart of the film.

3147505,4,B0015VI3CU,"Oh, how I celebrated when Gus Van Sant's middlebrow period ended! I not only started paying money to see his films in theaters, but actually bought the DVDs. Beginning with Gerry in 2002, Gus Van Sant recaptured an oeuvre that sadly so many former auteurs lose when they taste mainstream success for the first time. Following Gerry came the exceptional Elephant, Last Days, and 2007's understated masterpiece, Paranoid Park. Based on the story of a young skateboarder and high school student (Alex) who accidentally kills a security guard in the midst of a botched jump from a freight train, Paranoid Park captures the loss of innocence with originality and visceral honesty. After the accident and subsequent discovery of the skateboard that struck the guard, police officers begin to question the protagonist and his friends, some of whom take notice of Alex's changed behavior, building a rich level of tension and internal struggle in the process. Set in Portland, Oregon, and the surrounding region, Paranoid Park stars mostly unknown young actors who effectively express a sense of confusion at one of their own committing a serious crime and their subsequent need to go on with life as usual. Among the many unconventional methods employed in the film, Van Sant allowed several of his young actors to write their own dialogue and wear their own clothes to convey a greater degree of reality. In one of the more famous scenes, skaters in the Burnside Skatepark move in slow motion to Alex's narration, a joyous, yet muted, blend of cinematography and plot. Van Sant recently returned to mainstream cinema with Milk, though he may have created one of the greatest biopics of all time. Van Sant and his skaters get four and one-half stars from me.",1284076800,,1751,4.979522184300341

3147507,5,B0015VI3CU,"Gus Van Sant has a lot of loyal followers.  I haven't seen a lot of his movies, but I've seen a handful (I think about 5 or 6) and while I appreciate his keen eye and directorial visions, I don't really sink into his work like so many others.  I remember the first time I saw `Elephant'.  It was such a conflicting experience, and I feel that way about a lot of his work.  `Paranoid Park' is a lot like `Elephant' in ways, but for me (and maybe it's because, having seen `Elephant' and pondered it immensely) this film understands the awkwardness a little better and thus relays a deeper, more rapturous message.

The film tells the story of a teenager named Alex who happened to visit a skate park called Paranoid Park on the night a security guard was killed.  He's interrogated by police (as are every other skater in the school) but he hides his involvement in the killing.  His guilty conscience begins to erode his persona, distancing him from those he loves and those closest to him.

He's falling apart.

I mention an awkwardness on the outset of this review, and what I mean by that is this naturally stiff feeling of teenage angst that runs through each frame.  The narration is poor to a profit, for the stumbled reading portrays the emotionally confused state that Alex finds himself.  The conversations all read true (even when they appear pointless, there is a point) and the plot unraveling is marvelously textured from start to finish.  Some have concluded that this film is a gay allegory, and I can totally see that.  I don't think that Alex is gay (his separation from his girlfriend is most definitely a part of his emotional confliction due to his current state) but I do feel that the undertones are there.  This film is very much about concealing something you feel will ostracize you and the pain that comes from that concealment.  Beings that Van Sant is a gay man, I can see his influence and personal story bleeding into this films moral core.

Using regular kids (newbies to the business) to play the parts here was a major plus.  They seem uncomfortable in their own skin, and that isn't something you can readily display unless, well, you are uncomfortable in your own skin.

For me, the anticlimactic ending is perfection.  When reviewing `Elephant' I mentioned that the film was basically designed to make you feel nothing about the killings.  You walked away void of feeling.  `Paranoid Park' is similar in that you can feel the coldness (and true testament to the moral state of society today) but there is an emotional resonance that truly connects the audience to Alex here.  Alex is not void of feeling.  His breakdowns are strong and passionate.  He feels the consequences of his actions so profoundly that the final frames, that fire, burn brightly as a loud statement, reigning in our personal feelings and delivering a severe blow to our consciences.  We are brought into his world and brought to his level and then suddenly we are left contemplating whether what Alex concludes is what we would have concluded.

It's stunning.",1268697600,,3068,4.698501872659176
3147508,2,B0015VI3CU,"The strength of the film is its attempt to genuinely portray teenage apathy, relationships, and communication, all of which admittedly are often mis-portrayed in mainstream Hollywood films. But its strengths end there in my opinion. Some of the characters' actions feel forced or exaggerated, as if the viewer is incapable of discerning something in between black and white. Ironically though, the many (I would say way too many) musical interludes are wide open for interpretation, and come across as time fillers more than insight into the story or characters. There are two parallel stories in the film. The first is the accidental death of a security guard and the second is the main character(tm)s realization that long-term relationships are based on more than physical attraction. In the end though, I felt this film came up short on both fronts. Neither story was fully developed and instead the viewer feels left out like the parent of an apathetic teenager.",1265587200,,967,5.1265822784810124

Gabe Nevins' impressive performance validated a principal tenet of acting which stresses the inestimable value of well-appointed facial expressions.

The quasi-documentary style of filming infused the movie with a quality somewhere between true-grit and surreal, beginning with Detective Lu's (played impeccably by Danny Liu)snappy interrogation of Alex (Gabe Nevins).

3147511,5,B0015VI3CU,"This is one of Gus Van Sant's greatest films, and it has yet to leave my mind since seeing it months ago. It tells a powerful story about feelings of guilt, and in ways you would not expect. It is eye opening and it is powerful film-making at its finest.",1253145600,,254,4.1
3147512,5,B0015VI3CU,"Paranoid Park could arguably be Van Sant's retelling of Dostoyevsky's seminal Crime and Punishment; it is an intimate examination of a murderer, and the undertaking of guilt and societal disconnect.  It follows the memories of Alex, a high school skateboarder in Portland, as they are told to us through his narration; something is irking him, and he is using the power of the narrative story as a mode of catharsis.  He describes a local skate park, an illegally built array of concrete structures known as Paranoid by the skater kids, as the Eden of his adolescent dreams; his aspirations entail acceptance among his boarding cohorts, and being deemed `good enough' for Paranoid.
We then find ourselves following Alex directly inside his memories, as we start jumping back and forth through time.  But we learn what is causing Alex's guilt when he has an interrogation with the local police detective, Liu, and we discover that a security guard has been murdered.  A scream briefly flits into the soundtrack, indicating a troubled connection in Alex's memory, and now we realize that he is involved in the killing.
What follows is a landscape of heavy emotion as the stream of Alex`s thoughts spill into the actual filmic form; the weight of Alex's conscious takes the form of a deconstructed linear narrative of storytelling, a rich soundscape that portrays the sea of the mind's noise, and punctuations of skateboarding kids (which we later find out are the audition tapes of the actors playing Alex and his friends).  The people that fill Alex's life are interestingly realized characters; his best friend Jarrod, the mentor and cause of his downfall Scratch, his strangely `other' girlfriends Macy and Jennifer, and the aforementioned detective.

This is a film about memory, and therefore, about history and historiography of the self.  Van Sant approaches 'remembering' from a very unique perspective in order to tell the story, harkening back to concepts De Certeau expressed about the telling of history.  As Alex himself states, ""I didn't do very well in creative writing, but I'll get this all on paper eventually.""  The narrative is fragmented; events are not placed in logical order on a linear timeline, scenes are frequently repeated in differing ways, and sequences are reconstructed with unraveling detail as the `plot thickens;' the entire movie functions as re-enacted pieces of thought.  The opening presents this skewed vision of storytelling in showing our hero, Alex, beginning to write the story (the history) of the events at hand.  And he is writing in pencil, which leaves room for error and correction; `rewriting.'  But even the scenes of him writing the story we are seeing are situated along with the rest of the sequences as pieces of a larger memory; one has to wonder when, in fact, the 'present' of the film is.  The film harkens to ideas we all struggle with over time: our remembering, our remembered.

From a thematically critical perspective, this is a film dealing with the concepts of narratological understanding; the idea that time is not linear, that it can be fragmented and non-sequential like memory and thought.  It is an example of mannerist mise-en-scene; the style is not motivated by the subject matter, but in its own justification.  And though not the first time dealing with these ideas, it is Gus Van Sant's finest approach, and it demonstrates the craftsmanship embodying his work.",1249344000,2,3439,5.070921985815603

He's made use of Hollywood, but so far he hasn't shown any sign of selling out to Hollywood. After every blockbuster, he goes home to Portland and gets back to work.

Since he follows his own muse (and her alone) in making these little movies, it wouldn't matter if every reviewer here thought they were too slow or boring or pretentious, as a large number do. He obviously makes them to please himself and not any audience, so it's almost a coincidence if anybody else likes them. Fortunately, I'm one who does.

Every ""real"" Van Sant movie, from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mala-Noche/dp/B000TXNDUM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mala Noche</a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Paranoid-Park/dp/B001CDFY7S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Paranoid Park</a>, is a fascinating invitation to see and hear and (best of all) feel his very personal, quirky, lyrical, surreal, usually gritty and always fascinating take on a tiny little corner of this very wide world. He doesn't care enough what any of us think about his work to make it more palatable. Thank God. Like a true creator, he does what feels right to him. The beauty in that approach is that it gives us access to something completely unique, unavailable anywhere else.

People who insist on being spoon-fed their entertainment in familiar packages tend not to like Van Sant's little independent movies, but those people have many other options. Neatly packaged, predigested entertainment in familiar formats is what Hollywood cranks out by the hundreds every year. For the rest of us, there are the few odd geniuses like Gus Van Sant, willing to share their vision untainted by the public's demands for entertainment. He keeps on making these quirky gems, and they are consistently challenging, brilliant and very distinctive. Nobody would ever mistake a real Van Sant movie for one from The Walt Disney Company.

Van Sant is at heart a painter, after all, not a writer, not a storyteller, not a teacher. He gives us an impression of a story, a glimpse into it, not a neatly sequential, fully wrapped-up and satisfying narrative. He never gives us all the facts or answers every question or ties up every loose end, and he rarely tells a story in chronological order. He never, ever thinks for us. He gives us a glimpse into an experience and leaves us free to get whatever we can out of it.

I'm not saying that Van Sant's movies are just free-associating, chaotic messes. Paranoid Park, for example, is beautifully if unconventionally structured. The ghastly ""crime"" is in almost the exact center of the movie, with the details and consequences weaving in and out around it in both directions like swirls in a whirlpool.

Like Van Sant's other independent movies (and like all truly great movies), Paranoid Park cannot be fully appreciated in one viewing, or even two or three. That may be one reason some people don't like them--you don't get up from the first viewing as satisfied as if you'd finished a good meal. If anything, you leave hungrier than when you started. Only the second or third time do you even begin to comprehend what you've seen, to appreciate how the various, disparate elements fit together into an emotionally coherent and powerful whole.

I'll give an example. One very unusual thing Van Sant does in Paranoid Park is use background music originally composed for somebody else's movie, in this case several of Nino Rota's 40-year-old themes from Fellini's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Juliet-Of-The-Spirits/dp/B00005V6N6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Juliet Of The Spirits</a>. That music often accompanies one of the long slow-motion scenes of Alex just walking that so many reviewers complain about.

When I was watching Paranoid Park the first time, I noticed that that music sounded familiar, and I liked it, but I didn't recognize what it was until I saw the end credits. So I thought a while about why Van Sant would do such a strange thing, and I started remembering Juliet, and seeing similarities between Juliet's story and Alex's, and how perfectly her music fitted his experiences, and so the second time it was like watching a whole new movie.

That's how great movies are supposed to be. If you get all there is to get the first time, it means there wasn't much worth getting.

I'm tempted to say that Paranoid Park is the best Van Sant movie yet, but that's just because it's the one that's freshest in my mind. I remember&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mala-Noche/dp/B000TXNDUM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mala Noche</a>, or the River Phoenix scenes in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-Own-Private-Idaho/dp/B00005JLHW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My Own Private Idaho</a>, or the long dolly shot in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Last-Days/dp/B000AYEL10/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Last Days</a>, and I have to rein myself in. So I'll just say that Paranoid Park is the latest little masterpiece in a string of little masterpieces that hopefully will keep growing between the blockbusters for a long, long time.",1238284800,,6109,6.1680376028202115
3147514,4,B0015VI3CU,"The good:  A character study of a stereotypical looking skateboard teenager who is anything but stereotypical.  Rather Van Sant, conveys to us the boy is a critical thinker who understands people could possibly have careers for other reasons then for money (whereas his judges may not be so critical) in disagreement of his more immature friends, a lesson sometimes learned by some adults after financial enslavement and a need to make big money.  With little words Van Sant also manages to show the teen has a conscious but also has him make the politically incorrect correct choice which saves him from doing an internship in a prison learning how to be a criminal.

The repetitiveness of Park's structure comes off as pretentious at times.  For example, you get some plot followed by slow motion scenes over and over which felt like the film was trying to be arty for arts sake.  However, this one slight negative could stand to be a positive if this structure and style manages to seep into the subconscious and is remembered whereas so many instantly awesome popcorn flicks are forgotten.",1233360000,3,1093,4.881081081081081
3147515,3,B0015VI3CU,"I thought Paranoid Park was relatively well-done for its budget. Certainly, it was a very low production cost film.  Therefore, if it were a Hollywood production, I would have to give it 1 star.

However, the film really tries to convey its message through songs, imagery, and silence. While I think that helps to create a proper mood, I prefer films there to have more dialogue, a slightly more orderly plot, and better picture quality.

Now, the goal might have been to create a film that reminds you of a home-made production. If this was the intent, the film delivered moderately well. Certainly, the viewer is acquainted to the the struggles Gabe Nevins' character faces: parents' breakup, girl problems, and then, his responsibility for the death of a watchman.

The end presents another difficulty. SPOILER. For a young man who is pretty well involved (i.e. they find his skateboard with victim's DNA), I would have thought the film would include what actually happens to him. As it is, the film does not address this issue.

Also, the film contains no scenes that I feel should give a rating over PG. In fact, there are G-rated films with just as much violence. In short, while the film does have violence in a way, it is through images, music, and facial expression that you come to realize what the characters are experiencing inside their mind.",1233273600,,1355,4.798283261802575
3147516,4,B0015VI3CU,"When he isn't busy making commercial movies for a mainstream audience (""Good Will Hunting,"" ""Milk""), Gus Van Sant is out there toiling away on the fringes of American cinema, creating low budget, highly idiosyncratic works for a niche market (""Gerry,"" ""Elephant,"" ""Last Days"").

In ""Paranoid Park,"" which has been derived from the novel by Blake Nelson, Van Sant sets his sights on the skateboarding underclass of Portland, Oregon.  Alex is a fairly typical angst-ridden teen, whose parents are in the process of getting a divorce and who finds little in life to ignite his passion beyond skateboarding.  Yet, he is generally respectful of his elders and lacks the initiative even to be truly rebellious.  Alex's life changes dramatically, however, when he inadvertently becomes involved with the death of a man not far from the local skater park where he and his buddy have just recently begun to hang out.  The majority of the movie is focused on Alex's attempts to both maintain the secret of what he's done and cope with the overwhelming guilt caused by the incident.

Like many of Van Sant's movies, ""Paranoid Park"" is guaranteed to leave certain members of the audience cold, frustrated by its lapses into artiness and the deliberately amateurish nature of many of its performances.  Yet, it is this very lack of commercial slickness that gives the movie its much needed air of authenticity.  Alex's response to what he's done is wholly in accordance with the way we feel a real person caught in this situation would react.  Nothing about this film feels forced or phony, and Gabe Nevins, with his appropriately understated performance as the troubled teen, engages our sympathy from the outset.  Yet, at the same time, Van Sant's characters seem to move through life as if in a dream, emotionally detached from the world around them, an effect achieved, stylistically, through slow motion photography, a time-shifting narrative, and an eclectic musical score which includes snippets of Nino Rota's pieces from various of Fellini's more phantasmagoric films.

Without a whole lot of contrivance or fanfare, ""Paranoid Park"" presents a credible and haunting view of teenage life in America today.",1232928000,,2200,5.11731843575419

Following Gerry, Elephant, and Last Days, I didn't really look forward to sitting through Paranoid Park, and in truth, I was starting to wonder if Van Sant is coasting on his own high-minded fumes.  Using the story of Alex (Gabe Nevins), the compendious skater who can't quite straighten out his thoughts on a murder he may or may not have been a part of, Van Sant, it turns out, is onto something.  Amidst the slow tale of mystery, and of how Alex will approach the mystery, he gives us, quietly, a story about a teenager's disaffection from the people around him.  He dramatizes, with convincing sadness and creativity, the way in which the most ""normal"" of us can harbor dark, perplexing thoughts, and have no one in their life they feel comfortable voicing them to.  I felt for Alex, who does something, and sorta doesn't do it, and who sees the ""freaks and punks"" at Paranoid Park as people that are truly ""free.""  I was struck and sympathetic, but I confess I don't have any affection for Van Sant's MO of letting stiff, ""regular"" people wander around until they do something.  Here, his story has some moral implications, but I wonder if it's worth the psuedo-romantic gaze to get there - visually arresting as it is, can't Van Sant get there without the pretentious window dressing?  At 84 minutes, it still feels like a lot of high-concept padding.",1231718400,,1533,4.672862453531598

(The NY Times review in particular is dead on, imho.)  The 1 star ""total bomb"" reviews here are completely out of sync with accepted opinion of Paranoid Park.

Obviously, it's not for everyone.  It is more for those that could appreciate Elephant or 4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days than someone looking for an action skater flick.  But it will go down as one of Gus Van Sant's best films in what is already a distinguished career.  It's one of the most beautiful movies of recent years and the score and sound mixing is stupendous.  But it takes some time and attitude adjustment to get into the flow with the film.  It's well worth the time and almost demands multiple viewings.

As with Elephant, many of the young actors are novices at best.  This is not a drawback at all.  It only enhances the movie because the characters are so real.

Slow motion skaters, the train scene scored to a key passage from Beethoven's 9th, the shower scene, the beach, beautiful boys, beautiful girls, not so beautiful girls, losing ones virginity- all in beautiful slow motion scenes told out of sequence, often with no dialog and sometimes repeated to underscore certain points.

To be honest, I'm not a fan of the avant-garde ""what does life really mean"" type of movies - i.e. ""Elephant,"" ""Donnie Darko,"" ""Mulholland Drive""-that are like watching a Robert Cormier novel come to life.  I had to watch Van Sant's blatant Columbine exploitation ""Elephant"" for a class once, so I should've known what I was getting into with this one.  However, the above movies are still made watchable by decent actors.

I'm sure Gussy Boy wants to get actors whom no one has ever heard of nor will ever hear of again to make the movie seem ""real.""  Problem is, they can't act.  I'm going to guess that's the point - let's have D-list actors have ""real"" dialogue with each other so that it seems ""real.""  However, it just gets annoying.  Van Sant spends so much time with the camera focusing on one character at a time that I began to wonder if a bout of narcolepsy had overtake him while at the helm.

Maybe I'm not hip enough to understand the idea this movie was trying to present.

The artwork for the cover and just the name conjured up imagery of a possibly dark but well-done story, mystery and the inevitable looming of a tragic event.

What ended up happening was watching a movie that tried so hard to capture that of the high school awkwardness, playing the most random soundtrack (of course Eliot Smith was present), long, drawn-out slow-motion scenes (see the longest shower scene I have ever watched), and terrible, terrible acting.

This felt like a well-done attempt by a college film student who had a passion for skateboarding (see random shots of skateboarders), who executed this movie by watching well-done films (see Darren Afronosky) and emulating those to create many of the scenes you will see here. See the splicing of present with past in order to keep the viewer enticed.

Basically, this is a low-budget film without the low-budget, terrible song choices, terrible acting (this felt like films I've seen in Spanish class in high school), and just bad attempt.

3381992,4,B0015VI3CU,"Paranoid Park is Gus Van Sant's twelfth feature film, and the third in his recent films about disaffected youth.  Adapted from a novel by Portland writer Blake Nelson and obviously inspired by Crime and Punishment, Paranoid Park follows the life Alex, a local skate punk who gets tangled up in a grisly accident.

The thin plot has Alex, played by Gabe Nevins, attracted to Paranoid Park, a skate park that was built illegally by punks, skaters, and other riff raff.  Alex goes there one night alone, and is essentially picked up by some shady characters.  Without spoiling anything, he does something terrible and spends the rest of the movie trying to cope, mainly by writing out what happened in a letter to one of his friends.  Paranoid Park represents a place where Alex feels that he can belong.  He expresses how much he's attracted to the type of people who skate there, and he yearns to belong to their subculture, yet he never manages to find his place.

His writing literally drives the plot, as what he's writing down in his letter is what we experience as an audience.  The focus of Paranoid Park is decidedly insular.  Built around a series of disorienting techniques like dialogue overlaid with music, one sided dialogues where the other person is either obscured or off camera all together, long takes of Alex walking alone with a musical backdrop, and close-ups of Alex's blank stare,  Alex's inner life is shown as a sort of dreamy and hazy numbness.  His disaffection and guilt is not really expressed very effectively even in his diary, and the visual techniques of the film serve as one of the only windows in to his mind set.

Just like Elephant and Last Days, Van Sant is concerned with the seemingly existential existence of modern young people.  Not only is Alex not coping too well with his deed despite his journal confession, he's also not coping with his parents divorce, and not coping with his superficial and sexual forward girlfriend.  He can't express himself at all.  A breakdown of language is a well trodden theme in existential literature, and the characters in Paranoid Park don't do a whole heck of a lot of communicating.  Particularly evident is Alex's trouble communicating with the females in his life.  He can't talk to his mother, whose face isn't even seen except as a hazy outline, he can't talk to his girlfriend Jennifer and feels nothing towards her, or his friend Macy who urges him to open up, yet he can't bring himself to share his secret with her even if it would have helped.  Alex doesn't share his feelings or what happened, and he ends up being a depressed and blank teenager who'll end up being a dysfunctional adult, just like his parents.

Paranoid Park works well as an experimental take on a Crime and Punishment style story about inner torment.  Most of the actors were found on myspace with the exception of Taylor Momsen as Alex's girlfriend Jennifer, who surprisingly enough plays a sexual forward young girl on Gossip Girl.  Nevins is good as Alex, who's main job is to act like a typical teenager and to show off a numbed exterior.  The acting isn't stellar but it's authentic enough.  There might be a bit too much of the solitary slow motion shots of Alex, and maybe a bit too much style or substance with all of the arty and experimental camera work.  When Van Sant shows us the fifth or sixth slow motion walking shot of Alex overlayed with Elliott Smith or Nino Rota it got a little tiresome.  The pace is also very slow, which might turn off some folks wanting a more driven plot.

This is Van Sant's best effort in a long time, and it's definitely worth seeing if you can tolerate a little introspection and a slow pace.",1208390400,9,3698,4.659476117103236
3381993,4,B0015VI3CU,"Paranoid Park is an unpredictable, fresh film from Gus Van Sant that tells the story of introspective-teen Alex's struggles with life as he gets involved with the killing of a train station security guard.  The whole film hitches on the performance of its star, Gabe Nevins; fortunately, Nevins is in just about every scene of the movie.  Nevins is an absolute newcomer to movie-acting, but he works perfectly here.  Every scene that he's in, the viewer is completely captured in his quiet, emotional turmoil.  Nevins' big, beautiful, sulky eyes tell a story all their own.  He's wonderful.

Unfortunately, the other young actors are not so comfortable or capable in front of the camera.  They are genuine enough though for it to be forgiven though.  The real problem here is Van Sant, who's cinematography is trying far too hard to ""look"" independent.  The goofy camera angles and Van Sant's trademark moving-angle/moving-actor camerawork seem un-natural and distract from developing the characters more (which is where more focus was needed).  The story jumps forwards and backwards in time so much that sometimes you don't know when you are, but once you've figured the chronology out, that's not a big complaint for me.

Overall, the film is a success.  It's a reasonable enough story with interesting characters that's well-held-together by an amazing and fresh young performance by Gabe Nevins (just watching him is reason enough to see this movie).  As a bonus, the material he's acting out is unique and interesting.  A solid thumbs-up purchase for me.  Hopefully we see more of this young actor in the future.",1208044800,,1618,5.075757575757576
3381994,5,B0015VI3CU,"Alex, the narrarator and protagonist of ""Paranoid Park"", is not your typical romanticised culluloid teen. He is quiet, introspective, and near mute when it comes to verbalizing his feelings. He is the antithesis of a sullen, vapid adolescent skater. On the contrary, I found his parents to be vapid. When he speaks to them, what they say hardly makes an impact, because their efforts to really get through to him are ineffective. It's like carrying out an inane conversation with a stranger in which nothing is really said. Pleasantries are exchanged, but little beyond superficial subjects is broached.
  The aftershock of a gruesome accident has left Alex shell-shocked. The entire film is about the way guilt haunts him like a shadowy executioner. Close-ups of his friends' faces emphasize the way he searches their expressions for the slightest hint of accusation. Alex lives in a world that offers little joy. His parents are getting divorced, and he has dislocated himself to the lonely confines of a journal. The journal is his confidante, his only witness to paralyzing emotions that stalk him during his waking hours.
  Alex's character is not glorified in any way. He is awkward like most teens, he is not an expert skateboarder, and is reluctant to venture down the concrete slopes of the skate park carved under a colossal bridge. He is drawn toward Paranoid park because he seeks something resembling companionship and family. Jumping a boxcar leads to a fatal and grisly accident. Alex must live with the consequences of this mistake, which leads to intriguing questions about morality and the complexities of unintentional manslaughter. Gus Van Sant is not interested in the cogs of the judicial system, however, he is interested in the tormented machinery ticking away inside the young skater's head. Every aspect of reality is overshadowed by shame.
  A scene in which Alex dissociates in a hot shower was compelling because every part of his body seemed to be weeping, except for his eyes, as if they were afraid to betray his secret. He wanders through gloomy rooms, turning on lights almost as an afterthought. When he has sex with his girlfriend, he does so in a stupor. Immediately afterward, she gets up and brags to her friend on the phone that it was ""fantastic"". To Alex it did little to penetrate the numbness soaking his body. A nimble detective questions him in a way that makes him suspect if he is found guilty, a vast nothing will swallow him. Faces and eyes and vague gestures judge him at every opportunity. Bizarre music in the background informs us that Alex is supposed to be feeling happy or sad, but his facial expression remains flat; incapable of smiling.
  Gabe Nevins is an expressive actor who captures Alex's blank affect perfectly. He has an extremely difficult task in trying to capture Alex's mental state through posture and facial expressions, rather than simple words. His relationships with family and friends are so meaningless he has no one to confess to, so he buries his suffering to keep from being injured by emotions that are unfamiliar and threatening. Many will complain that the film moves at a snail's pace, but I think this is intentional: the director is submerging us in Alex's psyche, his dread and depression making situations slog by as if mired in quicksand.",1206230400,25,3328,4.951612903225806

3381996,3,B0015VI3CU,"Paranoid Park is a pretty boring movie overall.  What definitely had potential in the concept quickly deteriorated when it was soon realized that the writers are going for an actual laidback ""skateboarder type"" environment.

You see the storyline is supposed to be about a security guard who mysteriously dies as a result of a skateboarder making a horrible mistake.  The investigation team comes to the school to determine the involvement the skateboarders had in the mans death, however that element (that *crucial* element) was never developed enough.  In fact the police were WAY too easy on the kids who obviously showed total disrespect towards them by mocking them in the classroom in one segment and never taking anything serious enough.

A man dies under tragic circumstances and *none* of the skateboarders shed any tears or showed any remorse whatsoever.  I don't care how cool or hip it is being among the skateboarding crowd- a lack of human emotions is totally unrealistic.

In fact the one investigator only came to the school twice- the REST of the movie was devoted to the skateboarders supposedly retracing their steps pertaining to the death of the security guard, but we the viewers have to sit through a LOT of pointlessness involving the one skateboarders girlfriend and their relationship, and tricks being performed at the downtown park in slow-motion for dramatic effect, and a few trips to the local mall.  NONE of these things advance the storyline whatsoever.

Oh, and a good ending could have saved the movie at least somewhat, but... no, that ending is really terrible and accomplishes nothing.  Basically this is a crime drama for the teenage crowd.  Had I known I never would have watched it.",1329955200,,1724,5.014035087719298
3381997,3,B0015VI3CU,"*What if something so terrible happens that you can't tell anyone? Yet it's too much of a burden to keep to yourself? That's the dilemma facing teenaged Alex (Gabe Nevins) in the chillingly plausible, very realistic film Paranoid Park.

Alex is a normal kid, and an avid skateboarder. The crowd he hangs with are always chasing the next adrenaline thrill. One popular spot they congregate to hone their boarding skills is in a bad part of town they've nicknamed ""Paranoid Park"". Definitely not a hangout their parents would approve of, so they usually sneak off there when they're supposed to be at other places.

One fateful night when Alex was supposedly at a sleepover at his friend Jared's (Jake Miller) house, they were instead out boarding at Paranoid Park. Some friends brought up an extreme but dangerous alternative to boarding, called Train Jumping at the adjacent tracks. Yes, it's exactly what it sounded like, the thrill seekers were jumping onto moving trains and hitching short rides. But while they were doing this, a security guard at the tracks ends up dead.

What at first appears to be a tragic accident may be something more, and police are following up saying that it was foul play, and that it had something to do with the skateboarders.

Police officials relentlessly question all the teens, find out about the subculture and that particular bad-news bit of real estate. The one thing they suspect although they can't get any information from the closely knit group is that Alex may know more than he's letting on.

Through a series of flashbacks, we follow Alex's memories of the night and the guard's death, little by little, and the final pieces of the puzzle don't come together until the end. Not revealing anything more, I can tell you that the end sent chills down my very spine.

This was so real, so plausible it haunted me for days after seeing it. The storyline is strong, and deeply rooted in suspense. Definitely worth at least one watch.

3382002,4,B0015VI3CU,"Oh, how I celebrated when Gus Van Sant's middlebrow period ended! I not only started paying money to see his films in theaters, but actually bought the DVDs. Beginning with Gerry in 2002, Gus Van Sant recaptured an oeuvre that sadly so many former auteurs lose when they taste mainstream success for the first time. Following Gerry came the exceptional Elephant, Last Days, and 2007's understated masterpiece, Paranoid Park. Based on the story of a young skateboarder and high school student (Alex) who accidentally kills a security guard in the midst of a botched jump from a freight train, Paranoid Park captures the loss of innocence with originality and visceral honesty. After the accident and subsequent discovery of the skateboard that struck the guard, police officers begin to question the protagonist and his friends, some of whom take notice of Alex's changed behavior, building a rich level of tension and internal struggle in the process. Set in Portland, Oregon, and the surrounding region, Paranoid Park stars mostly unknown young actors who effectively express a sense of confusion at one of their own committing a serious crime and their subsequent need to go on with life as usual. Among the many unconventional methods employed in the film, Van Sant allowed several of his young actors to write their own dialogue and wear their own clothes to convey a greater degree of reality. In one of the more famous scenes, skaters in the Burnside Skatepark move in slow motion to Alex's narration, a joyous, yet muted, blend of cinematography and plot. Van Sant recently returned to mainstream cinema with Milk, though he may have created one of the greatest biopics of all time.

3382004,5,B0015VI3CU,"Gus Van Sant has a lot of loyal followers.  I haven't seen a lot of his movies, but I've seen a handful (I think about 5 or 6) and while I appreciate his keen eye and directorial visions, I don't really sink into his work like so many others.  I remember the first time I saw `Elephant'.  It was such a conflicting experience, and I feel that way about a lot of his work.  `Paranoid Park' is a lot like `Elephant' in ways, but for me (and maybe it's because, having seen `Elephant' and pondered it immensely) this film understands the awkwardness a little better and thus relays a deeper, more rapturous message.

The film tells the story of a teenager named Alex who happened to visit a skate park called Paranoid Park on the night a security guard was killed.  He's interrogated by police (as are every other skater in the school) but he hides his involvement in the killing.  His guilty conscience begins to erode his persona, distancing him from those he loves and those closest to him.

He's falling apart.

I mention an awkwardness on the outset of this review, and what I mean by that is this naturally stiff feeling of teenage angst that runs through each frame.  The narration is poor to a profit, for the stumbled reading portrays the emotionally confused state that Alex finds himself.  The conversations all read true (even when they appear pointless, there is a point) and the plot unraveling is marvelously textured from start to finish.  Some have concluded that this film is a gay allegory, and I can totally see that.  I don't think that Alex is gay (his separation from his girlfriend is most definitely a part of his emotional confliction due to his current state) but I do feel that the undertones are there.  This film is very much about concealing something you feel will ostracize you and the pain that comes from that concealment.  Beings that Van Sant is a gay man, I can see his influence and personal story bleeding into this films moral core.

Using regular kids (newbies to the business) to play the parts here was a major plus.  They seem uncomfortable in their own skin, and that isn't something you can readily display unless, well, you are uncomfortable in your own skin.

For me, the anticlimactic ending is perfection.  When reviewing `Elephant' I mentioned that the film was basically designed to make you feel nothing about the killings.  You walked away void of feeling.  `Paranoid Park' is similar in that you can feel the coldness (and true testament to the moral state of society today) but there is an emotional resonance that truly connects the audience to Alex here.  Alex is not void of feeling.  His breakdowns are strong and passionate.  He feels the consequences of his actions so profoundly that the final frames, that fire, burn brightly as a loud statement, reigning in our personal feelings and delivering a severe blow to our consciences.  We are brought into his world and brought to his level and then suddenly we are left contemplating whether what Alex concludes is what we would have concluded.

It's stunning.",1268697600,,3068,4.698501872659176
3382005,2,B0015VI3CU,"The strength of the film is its attempt to genuinely portray teenage apathy, relationships, and communication, all of which admittedly are often mis-portrayed in mainstream Hollywood films. But its strengths end there in my opinion. Some of the characters' actions feel forced or exaggerated, as if the viewer is incapable of discerning something in between black and white. Ironically though, the many (I would say way too many) musical interludes are wide open for interpretation, and come across as time fillers more than insight into the story or characters. There are two parallel stories in the film. The first is the accidental death of a security guard and the second is the main character(tm)s realization that long-term relationships are based on more than physical attraction. In the end though, I felt this film came up short on both fronts. Neither story was fully developed and instead the viewer feels left out like the parent of an apathetic teenager.",1265587200,,967,5.1265822784810124

3382009,5,B0015VI3CU,"Paranoid Park could arguably be Van Sant's retelling of Dostoyevsky's seminal Crime and Punishment; it is an intimate examination of a murderer, and the undertaking of guilt and societal disconnect.  It follows the memories of Alex, a high school skateboarder in Portland, as they are told to us through his narration; something is irking him, and he is using the power of the narrative story as a mode of catharsis.  He describes a local skate park, an illegally built array of concrete structures known as Paranoid by the skater kids, as the Eden of his adolescent dreams; his aspirations entail acceptance among his boarding cohorts, and being deemed `good enough' for Paranoid.
We then find ourselves following Alex directly inside his memories, as we start jumping back and forth through time.  But we learn what is causing Alex's guilt when he has an interrogation with the local police detective, Liu, and we discover that a security guard has been murdered.  A scream briefly flits into the soundtrack, indicating a troubled connection in Alex's memory, and now we realize that he is involved in the killing.
What follows is a landscape of heavy emotion as the stream of Alex`s thoughts spill into the actual filmic form; the weight of Alex's conscious takes the form of a deconstructed linear narrative of storytelling, a rich soundscape that portrays the sea of the mind's noise, and punctuations of skateboarding kids (which we later find out are the audition tapes of the actors playing Alex and his friends).  The people that fill Alex's life are interestingly realized characters; his best friend Jarrod, the mentor and cause of his downfall Scratch, his strangely `other' girlfriends Macy and Jennifer, and the aforementioned detective.

This is a film about memory, and therefore, about history and historiography of the self.  Van Sant approaches 'remembering' from a very unique perspective in order to tell the story, harkening back to concepts De Certeau expressed about the telling of history.  As Alex himself states, ""I didn't do very well in creative writing, but I'll get this all on paper eventually.""  The narrative is fragmented; events are not placed in logical order on a linear timeline, scenes are frequently repeated in differing ways, and sequences are reconstructed with unraveling detail as the `plot thickens;' the entire movie functions as re-enacted pieces of thought.  The opening presents this skewed vision of storytelling in showing our hero, Alex, beginning to write the story (the history) of the events at hand.  And he is writing in pencil, which leaves room for error and correction; `rewriting.'  But even the scenes of him writing the story we are seeing are situated along with the rest of the sequences as pieces of a larger memory; one has to wonder when, in fact, the 'present' of the film is.  The film harkens to ideas we all struggle with over time: our remembering, our remembered.

From a thematically critical perspective, this is a film dealing with the concepts of narratological understanding; the idea that time is not linear, that it can be fragmented and non-sequential like memory and thought.  It is an example of mannerist mise-en-scene; the style is not motivated by the subject matter, but in its own justification.  And though not the first time dealing with these ideas, it is Gus Van Sant's finest approach, and it demonstrates the craftsmanship embodying his work.",1249344000,2,3439,5.070921985815603
3382010,5,B0015VI3CU,"Gus Van Sant is by far the most interesting director working today. He's good enough at making mainstream Hollywood movies (like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/To-Die-For/dp/076781777X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">To Die For</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Good-Will-Hunting/dp/6305216088/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Good Will Hunting</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Psycho/dp/B00000IQVC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Psycho</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Milk/dp/B001QUF3SW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Milk</a>) to get funding to make the movies he really cares about, like Paranoid Park, ""little"" movies that are infinitely more interesting than the big ones. He's made use of Hollywood, but so far he hasn't shown any sign of selling out to Hollywood. After every blockbuster, he goes home to Portland and gets back to work.

Since he follows his own muse (and her alone) in making these little movies, it wouldn't matter if every reviewer here thought they were too slow or boring or pretentious, as a large number do. He obviously makes them to please himself and not any audience, so it's almost a coincidence if anybody else likes them. Fortunately, I'm one who does.

Every ""real"" Van Sant movie, from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mala-Noche/dp/B000TXNDUM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mala Noche</a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Paranoid-Park/dp/B001CDFY7S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Paranoid Park</a>, is a fascinating invitation to see and hear and (best of all) feel his very personal, quirky, lyrical, surreal, usually gritty and always fascinating take on a tiny little corner of this very wide world. He doesn't care enough what any of us think about his work to make it more palatable. Thank God. Like a true creator, he does what feels right to him. The beauty in that approach is that it gives us access to something completely unique, unavailable anywhere else.

People who insist on being spoon-fed their entertainment in familiar packages tend not to like Van Sant's little independent movies, but those people have many other options. Neatly packaged, predigested entertainment in familiar formats is what Hollywood cranks out by the hundreds every year. For the rest of us, there are the few odd geniuses like Gus Van Sant, willing to share their vision untainted by the public's demands for entertainment. He keeps on making these quirky gems, and they are consistently challenging, brilliant and very distinctive. Nobody would ever mistake a real Van Sant movie for one from The Walt Disney Company.

Van Sant is at heart a painter, after all, not a writer, not a storyteller, not a teacher. He gives us an impression of a story, a glimpse into it, not a neatly sequential, fully wrapped-up and satisfying narrative. He never gives us all the facts or answers every question or ties up every loose end, and he rarely tells a story in chronological order. He never, ever thinks for us. He gives us a glimpse into an experience and leaves us free to get whatever we can out of it.

I'm not saying that Van Sant's movies are just free-associating, chaotic messes. Paranoid Park, for example, is beautifully if unconventionally structured. The ghastly ""crime"" is in almost the exact center of the movie, with the details and consequences weaving in and out around it in both directions like swirls in a whirlpool.

Like Van Sant's other independent movies (and like all truly great movies), Paranoid Park cannot be fully appreciated in one viewing, or even two or three. That may be one reason some people don't like them--you don't get up from the first viewing as satisfied as if you'd finished a good meal. If anything, you leave hungrier than when you started. Only the second or third time do you even begin to comprehend what you've seen, to appreciate how the various, disparate elements fit together into an emotionally coherent and powerful whole.

I'll give an example. One very unusual thing Van Sant does in Paranoid Park is use background music originally composed for somebody else's movie, in this case several of Nino Rota's 40-year-old themes from Fellini's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Juliet-Of-The-Spirits/dp/B00005V6N6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Juliet Of The Spirits</a>. That music often accompanies one of the long slow-motion scenes of Alex just walking that so many reviewers complain about.

When I was watching Paranoid Park the first time, I noticed that that music sounded familiar, and I liked it, but I didn't recognize what it was until I saw the end credits. So I thought a while about why Van Sant would do such a strange thing, and I started remembering Juliet, and seeing similarities between Juliet's story and Alex's, and how perfectly her music fitted his experiences, and so the second time it was like watching a whole new movie.

That's how great movies are supposed to be. If you get all there is to get the first time, it means there wasn't much worth getting.

I'm tempted to say that Paranoid Park is the best Van Sant movie yet, but that's just because it's the one that's freshest in my mind. I remember&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mala-Noche/dp/B000TXNDUM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mala Noche</a>, or the River Phoenix scenes in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-Own-Private-Idaho/dp/B00005JLHW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My Own Private Idaho</a>, or the long dolly shot in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Last-Days/dp/B000AYEL10/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Last Days</a>, and I have to rein myself in. So I'll just say that Paranoid Park is the latest little masterpiece in a string of little masterpieces that hopefully will keep growing between the blockbusters for a long, long time.",1238284800,,6109,6.1680376028202115
3382011,4,B0015VI3CU,"The good:  A character study of a stereotypical looking skateboard teenager who is anything but stereotypical.  Rather Van Sant, conveys to us the boy is a critical thinker who understands people could possibly have careers for other reasons then for money (whereas his judges may not be so critical) in disagreement of his more immature friends, a lesson sometimes learned by some adults after financial enslavement and a need to make big money.  With little words Van Sant also manages to show the teen has a conscious but also has him make the politically incorrect correct choice which saves him from doing an internship in a prison learning how to be a criminal.

The repetitiveness of Park's structure comes off as pretentious at times.  For example, you get some plot followed by slow motion scenes over and over which felt like the film was trying to be arty for arts sake.  However, this one slight negative could stand to be a positive if this structure and style manages to seep into the subconscious and is remembered whereas so many instantly awesome popcorn flicks are forgotten.",1233360000,3,1093,4.881081081081081
3382012,3,B0015VI3CU,"I thought Paranoid Park was relatively well-done for its budget. Certainly, it was a very low production cost film.  Therefore, if it were a Hollywood production, I would have to give it 1 star.

However, the film really tries to convey its message through songs, imagery, and silence. While I think that helps to create a proper mood, I prefer films there to have more dialogue, a slightly more orderly plot, and better picture quality.

Now, the goal might have been to create a film that reminds you of a home-made production. If this was the intent, the film delivered moderately well. Certainly, the viewer is acquainted to the the struggles Gabe Nevins' character faces: parents' breakup, girl problems, and then, his responsibility for the death of a watchman.

The end presents another difficulty. SPOILER. For a young man who is pretty well involved (i.e. they find his skateboard with victim's DNA), I would have thought the film would include what actually happens to him. As it is, the film does not address this issue.

Also, the film contains no scenes that I feel should give a rating over PG. In fact, there are G-rated films with just as much violence. In short, while the film does have violence in a way, it is through images, music, and facial expression that you come to realize what the characters are experiencing inside their mind.",1233273600,,1355,4.798283261802575
3382013,4,B0015VI3CU,"When he isn't busy making commercial movies for a mainstream audience (""Good Will Hunting,"" ""Milk""), Gus Van Sant is out there toiling away on the fringes of American cinema, creating low budget, highly idiosyncratic works for a niche market (""Gerry,"" ""Elephant,"" ""Last Days"").

In ""Paranoid Park,"" which has been derived from the novel by Blake Nelson, Van Sant sets his sights on the skateboarding underclass of Portland, Oregon.  Alex is a fairly typical angst-ridden teen, whose parents are in the process of getting a divorce and who finds little in life to ignite his passion beyond skateboarding.  Yet, he is generally respectful of his elders and lacks the initiative even to be truly rebellious.  Alex's life changes dramatically, however, when he inadvertently becomes involved with the death of a man not far from the local skater park where he and his buddy have just recently begun to hang out.  The majority of the movie is focused on Alex's attempts to both maintain the secret of what he's done and cope with the overwhelming guilt caused by the incident.

Like many of Van Sant's movies, ""Paranoid Park"" is guaranteed to leave certain members of the audience cold, frustrated by its lapses into artiness and the deliberately amateurish nature of many of its performances.  Yet, it is this very lack of commercial slickness that gives the movie its much needed air of authenticity.  Alex's response to what he's done is wholly in accordance with the way we feel a real person caught in this situation would react.  Nothing about this film feels forced or phony, and Gabe Nevins, with his appropriately understated performance as the troubled teen, engages our sympathy from the outset.  Yet, at the same time, Van Sant's characters seem to move through life as if in a dream, emotionally detached from the world around them, an effect achieved, stylistically, through slow motion photography, a time-shifting narrative, and an eclectic musical score which includes snippets of Nino Rota's pieces from various of Fellini's more phantasmagoric films.

Following Gerry, Elephant, and Last Days, I didn't really look forward to sitting through Paranoid Park, and in truth, I was starting to wonder if Van Sant is coasting on his own high-minded fumes.  Using the story of Alex (Gabe Nevins), the compendious skater who can't quite straighten out his thoughts on a murder he may or may not have been a part of, Van Sant, it turns out, is onto something.  Amidst the slow tale of mystery, and of how Alex will approach the mystery, he gives us, quietly, a story about a teenager's disaffection from the people around him.  He dramatizes, with convincing sadness and creativity, the way in which the most ""normal"" of us can harbor dark, perplexing thoughts, and have no one in their life they feel comfortable voicing them to.  I felt for Alex, who does something, and sorta doesn't do it, and who sees the ""freaks and punks"" at Paranoid Park as people that are truly ""free.""  I was struck and sympathetic, but I confess I don't have any affection for Van Sant's MO of letting stiff, ""regular"" people wander around until they do something.  Here, his story has some moral implications, but I wonder if it's worth the psuedo-romantic gaze to get there - visually arresting as it is, can't Van Sant get there without the pretentious window dressing?

It's one of the most beautiful movies of recent years and the score and sound mixing is stupendous.  But it takes some time and attitude adjustment to get into the flow with the film.  It's well worth the time and almost demands multiple viewings.

As with Elephant, many of the young actors are novices at best.  This is not a drawback at all.  It only enhances the movie because the characters are so real.

Did I say it's one of the most beautiful films of recent years?  Slow motion skaters, the train scene scored to a key passage from Beethoven's 9th, the shower scene, the beach, beautiful boys, beautiful girls, not so beautiful girls, losing ones virginity- all in beautiful slow motion scenes told out of sequence, often with no dialog and sometimes repeated to underscore certain points.  Two signature Elliott Smith songs, played almost in their entirety, accompany two long and unedited shots of the title character to create two more memorable moments.

One of the best of 2007 and deservedly so...",1229299200,15,1584,4.667870036101083

But after watching this film, I truly understand why people would utter this sentiment.  This film is beyond terrible beyond unwatchable.  To be honest, I'm not a fan of the avant-garde ""what does life really mean"" type of movies - i.e. ""Elephant,"" ""Donnie Darko,"" ""Mulholland Drive""-that are like watching a Robert Cormier novel come to life.  I had to watch Van Sant's blatant Columbine exploitation ""Elephant"" for a class once, so I should've known what I was getting into with this one.  However, the above movies are still made watchable by decent actors.

I'm sure Gussy Boy wants to get actors whom no one has ever heard of nor will ever hear of again to make the movie seem ""real.""  Problem is, they can't act.  I'm going to guess that's the point - let's have D-list actors have ""real"" dialogue with each other so that it seems ""real.""  However, it just gets annoying.  Van Sant spends so much time with the camera focusing on one character at a time that I began to wonder if a bout of narcolepsy had overtake him while at the helm.

Maybe I'm not hip enough to understand the idea this movie was trying to present.  Maybe I'm too old (at the ripe age of 26) to understand the artistry and commentary on the life of a 17-year old skater, but man...really, this was painful to watch.

When the watchman starts to attack his friend, Alex hits the watchman with his skateboard, causing him to fall back under the wheels of a coming train.  I am sure the movie realistically depicts the uncertainty Alex felt about the situation, but it does not have him in any way deal responsibly with what he'd done.  Traditional values parents may want to show this movie to their teens, and discuss what would be the right thing to do if an impulsive act causes irreparable harm.

3382032,1,B0015VI3CU,"With no idea of what this movie was about except with a recommendation from a favored source, I rented this movie.

The artwork for the cover and just the name conjured up imagery of a possibly dark but well-done story, mystery and the inevitable looming of a tragic event.

What ended up happening was watching a movie that tried so hard to capture that of the high school awkwardness, playing the most random soundtrack (of course Eliot Smith was present), long, drawn-out slow-motion scenes (see the longest shower scene I have ever watched), and terrible, terrible acting.

This felt like a well-done attempt by a college film student who had a passion for skateboarding (see random shots of skateboarders), who executed this movie by watching well-done films (see Darren Afronosky) and emulating those to create many of the scenes you will see here. See the splicing of present with past in order to keep the viewer enticed.

Basically, this is a low-budget film without the low-budget, terrible song choices, terrible acting (this felt like films I've seen in Spanish class in high school), and just bad attempt.

If you want to watch a film that does the time sequence story, murder, but  with out the awkward adolescence, amazing acting, watch Boy A.

8260033,5,B0015VI3CU,"When I was a teenager, having a sleepover with friends, we would sometimes tell ghost stories. The first thing you do is turn out the light to create the proper mood. Then you lower your voice, occasionally seizing upon certain words or phrases, using inflection or tonal shifts to make the story a little creepier. At the end you might raise your voice suddenly in an effort to startle your listeners. My point in bringing all this up is to defend this film against those who say the writer/director wastes time with shots or scenes that ""have no point."" While ""Paranoid Park"" is not a ghost story (it's a drama), the fundamentals of good story telling can still apply. A director can use lighting, camera technique, staging, etc. to create the proper mood, tone and atmosphere. This particular movie is ALL about feelings and emotions. If the viewer allows himself to become immersed, he will no doubt feel what the character on screen is feeling. If, however, the viewer expects this movie to play out as a typical cinematic experience, refusing to just let it wash over him, he will become impatient. One imagines him saying at a sleepover, ""Why did you waste time turing out the light?! Just get to the point!""",1470614400,2,1215,4.708920187793427
8260034,2,B0015VI3CU,"I respect Gus Van Sant's work on the whole, but it's hard to stick with this one until the end.  There's barely enough substantial material here to fill out just half of its short 1' 24"" running time (and that's including several repeat scenes).  It vacillates between being a fuzzy, slow-mo, shaky-camera meditation piece, and an authentically awkward teen narration about a rather grisly ""accident.""  Probably the best scene is when the protagonist debates with himself about how to deal with it; probably the worst scene is the end when he avoids all responsibility by writing it down and then burning it.  On top of that, it's not plausible that he could just skate (pun intended) like that if his DNA (and surely the victim's) were found on his board.  Although the irregular pacing probably does a good job of simulating the protagonist's ""dazed and confused"" state of mind, it doesn't make for compelling viewing.

8260036,3,B0015VI3CU,"I read the book, which is your basic average lo-qual 'teen fiction' - America should be embarrassed by the level of prose we feed our kids, I read more challenging stuff than this when I was 6 - and wanted to see the movie because a) it's about skaters, and b) Taylor Mumsen's in it.
The skating is the best part of the movie, instead of pros you get actual kids doing things actual kids actually do at the skate park.
Another positive is the fact that the director uses real teenagers to portray teenagers, as opposed to most American films and TV shows, which tend to give such roles to people in their 20's or even 30's.
The acting may not be top-notch, but it's REAL, almost like a documentary rather than a dramatized movie.
Taylor Mumsen's part is, disappointingly, very small.
The progression of the story is very jumbled, sort of like a series of flashbacks in reverse, might confuse people who haven't read the book.
The result feels more like a European 'art' film, but since someone has a gun and someone gets killed, it is definitely American.",1443139200,,1055,4.528795811518324

However, this movie really isn't that great. When the main character speaks, he sounds like he's stuttering and forgets what he's supposed to say halfway in. The scenes were just awkward and weird, which could have worked if they were done a little bit differently. Van Sant is quite talented, but I just don't care for this. I've read the book ""Paranoid Park"" by Blake Nelson and it's much better than this. I don't hate it, but I don't like it, either.",1426377600,,597,4.588785046728972

8260039,4,B0015VI3CU,"I have enjoyed many of Gus van Sants films including Drugstore Cowboy, Milk and the simultaneously mesmerizing and horrifying Elephant. But somehow 2007s Paranoid Park slipped by without me noticing.

Well no longer. This is Paranoid Park s day in the sun (and a modest sun it is; this website is more like a black dwarf).

Before I continue I should warn you though that the title of this non-review reflection is actually a bit of a spoiler. For that I apologize. But whats done is done.

The film centers on the meandering life of Alex, a teenage skateboarder who is in the wrong place at the wrong time. Hes not a bad kid. But circumstances conspire against him and, before you know it, somebody has died. But not just died. The death is one of the most disturbing I can recall seeing in a film. Not because it is especially grisly (it is grisly, but not Tarantino grisly) but rather because it is so real.

Indeed, like Elephant, the sheer ordinariness of  Paranoid Park is one of its most unsettling aspects. As the film unfolded I thought of the dreams (nightmares really) that Ive had in the past in which I mistakenly killed somebody. Was I ever relieved to wake up from those dreams. But poor Alex was already awake.

The reality is that we could easily find ourselves in Alexs scuffed up Converse shoes. I think here of the time I drove twenty hours straight down the interstate even though near the end (on the long drive through Wyoming) I had taken to microsleeps. Semi in the distance. Blink. Semi dangerously close. Yikes. Better get a Steve Winwood cassette in the stereo to wake myself up. Thank God I never ran head long into a Chrysler minivan crammed with a family on their way to Yellowstone. But I could have. And with the right (or wrong) set of circumstances, so could you.

With that sobering thought in mind, I invite you to watch Alex as his life unfolds painfully around that fateful event. And as you do count your own blessings.
