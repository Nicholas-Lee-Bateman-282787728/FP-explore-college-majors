3567565,5,B001FB4VYO,"First show of season 2 - WOW! Really good. As before, funny, clever, great lead characters and Chuck is a real honey. Plus, I've gotta say the bad guys are great - especially in this particular show.",1223683200,,199,4.405405405405405
3567566,5,B001FB4VYO,"Excellent, funny, clever! Chuck is a seemingly normal guy in a very not normal situation. Love the show!",1223683200,2,104,4.833333333333333
3567567,1,B001FB4VYO,"The show was great as always, however the file comes with only the left sound, not even stereo?",1223596800,,95,4.333333333333333
3567568,5,B001FB4VYO,"Loved the fact that they kept going back and forth between will he or won't he be killed since he has a ""replacement"" device. Of course Casey wasn't going to kill him.
However, it had so many ups and downs I did not know whether to be happy or disappointed. The fact that he could leave the Buy More, do other things, and in my opinion, I thought he was going to quit and become an official agent for CIA/NSA.
But then he ends up at Buy More, and it looks like we'll be in for maybe some of the same shticks that were in the last season, but seeing Chuck's new strain of ultra-confidence (LOVED THE CALL OF DUTY FAKE-OUT. BEST THING EVER!), they may take it beyond him being the 3rd wheel to him being some sort of leader, at least part-time.

I am optimistic and I am glad Chuck is back! And here to stay... :)",1222560000,,811,4.10062893081761
3567569,5,B001FB4VYO,This episode was awesome. I fell in love with this show last year. I love that it is not too serious. I hope this show is on for a long time.,1222128000,3,141,3.5806451612903225
3567570,5,B001FB4VYO,"Once again, Chuck is filled with lots of humor, excitement and some romance.  A new season started off with a bang! Chuck is one of our ""must see"" shows every week.",1222041600,5,164,4.290322580645161
3567571,4,B001FB4VYO,"I really enjoyed this episode, I haven't watched Chuck for a while but now after seeing it once again I definitely am going to start watching once more.",1222041600,2,152,4.464285714285714
3567572,5,B001FB4VYO,"A glorious hour for techies and spy-fans. This is the show that glams geeks and makes us love Zach Levi. He plays it perfectly - not too straight, not too campy. I want to date him, upgrade pcs at the Buy More workbench with him, and kick the NSA and the bad guys outta town after chowing-down with pizza while gaming in the break room.

This season starts with Chuck learning that his services will not be needed - he is being replaced by a new Intersect machine. Casey (a personal favorite) becomes the ""heavy"" when he learns that his orders are to take-down the Intersect (Chuck). Our Geek Hero considers moving out to live on his own. SuperSarah stands by ""her man"" as only she can - kicking it up and out, Xena-style.

May be tough to top the First Season, but, Chuck fans, we're off to a Chuck-classic start!",1222041600,8,814,4.3841059602649
3567573,3,B001FB4VYO,"Chuck is a likeable enough hero and a likeable enough series. And while I love NBC giving this premiere episode up for free, I'd be a lot happier if my wife, who's deaf, could have enjoyed it, too. At this point, there's no reason -- none at all -- that online players can't include the closed caption feed, which is part of every new television broadcast. There are anywhere from 30 to 50 million people in the country with hearing loss, plus another 30 million people who use captions occasionally (those learning English, those watching at work, or in noisy environments). I have a big problem with Amazon's decision not to bother to include captions. It's just a case of laziness on management's point. And I object.",1222041600,7,720,4.677165354330708

3567850,5,B001FB4VYO,"I am absolutely in love with this show. I've finished all 5 seasons twice over now and my only regret is that it had to come to an end. Will I watch it again? Simply, yes. The show is cheesy and corny at times, but I love that. The hopeless romanticism and the theatrical fight/shooting scenes are what make this show so love-able. The characters and the actors themselves are so perfect, relatable, and just all around unforgettable. If you haven't watched Chuck, watch it. If you have, watch it again. I don't think I'll ever get enough of this show. Be prepared to get angry, sad, happy, and just teeter on the edge of your seat with this series.",1477612800,,649,4.416666666666667

3568029,5,B001FB4VYO,"Chuck is one of those absolute delights where you sit down and marvel at how such a fantastic show has survived only by the fans. Season one was entertaining and introducing all the characters while giving a taste of what this show can bring. Season two, is season one but done so expertly. Going from a 13 episode S1 to a 22 episode S2 can be daunting, but here I am sitting down and watching season two doing long form storytelling better than modern shows. They usually break up a mini story arc over four episodes, and each arc builds upon the one before it, which makes the ending of this season feel epic.

Season 2 still brings the great comedy, action, and character balances that all fans will love. You learn more about Sarah and Casey's backstories. The guest stars bring their A-game when they come on, and they actually leave a presence for the whole season. If you're a chuck fan you'll only be delighted to hear that season 2 is a perfect version of S1.",1464652800,2,968,4.438202247191011
3568030,5,B001FB4VYO,I love every thing about this show! It's just good fun. It's one of the few shows I can watch and not spend every minute nick picking. Although some of the premises are so ridiculous you easily can. But take it at face value and your enjoy it. And Sarah (Yvonne Strahovski) is just incredibly hot!!! It's worth watching just for all the sexy outfits they put her in every week. Enjoy!,1464134400,,384,4.347222222222222

3568506,5,B001FB4VYO,"My favorite season of Chuck. Still had enough money to properly fund the show, and before they started making it into a bad spy show instead of a relationship show in which a retail guy was playing spy.

3568509,4,B001FB4VYO,"This was a great season of Chuck which focused on the relationships of Chuck and his spy family and real family. It was about his dreams and making them come true. This season set the stage for later episodes that are just as great. Overall this was a funny season, but its probably not my favorite. I did end up watching this entire season within a week and I never once looked at what episode I was on. I was immersed in the show. This show just has everything you could ever want on TV. I think it could be a little bit more mysterious, but its fast and almost never disappoints. Each episode has something for someone. I really liked how the secondary characters got a lot of development and they weren't just thrown in there like other shows do today. This season did have some episodes I thought were a little meh, but overall the quality is a lot better than any TV show in existence. its kind of the same thing sometimes, where Chuck flashes on an agent, which pulls them into a chase but most TV shows are like that. This one is awesome! If you like James Bond, action, or any type of comedy, this is the show for you. Certain episodes in this season are incredibley funny and I find myself repeating the dialogue.",1403136000,,1223,4.321739130434783

Emmet enters the show and I don't really like him, but...that is soon remedied. I have to admit, I love Captain Awesome. I've seen him in Hallmark movies and thought he was a horrible actor, but I was wrong. He is perfect for the part he plays in Chuck. Sarah has little personality, but I get that she's trying to ""hide"" her feelings. The chemistry between Sarah and Chuck is palpable.",1401667200,,490,4.455555555555556

When I saw that the blu-ray version of season 1-5 where out I immediately bought the set. Season 4 and 5 were Blu-rayish quality, having a slightly crisper picture than the DVD versions. However, season 1-3 where not Blu-ray quality at all. In fact, even saying they were DVD quality would be stretching it.

Chuck is an amazing show with a unique storyline and a cast that has great chemistry together. Unfortunately, NBC and Warner Bros. do not feel the same way. In my opinion, just go on Netflix and watch Chuck there.",1389312000,,630,4.469565217391304

If you love James Bond movies but want a lighter version with more humor, Chuck is the show for you.  Chuck is the nerdy, unlikely hero who consistently saves the day using his computer/technology know-how, while his two co-spies, Sarah and Casey take care of all the action and violence. Later in the show you get to see Chuck get in on the action too, which is nice because you get to see the characters evolve as the show goes on.  We own all 5 seasons and watch them a LOT because even though we've seen them all, they never get old.  I highly recommend this show.",1382486400,,682,4.388888888888889

The many things about this show that I don't like:

1) There's more emphasis on the attractiveness of Sarah Walker, than on the missions.

2) The fact that Sarah Walker's sex appeal is what brings 90% of the viewers back to the show.  Though, I have to give her credit for flawlessly shedding her foreign accent to play this role.

3) The ""Power Rangers theme"" that I described earlier, is getting old.

4) In a future season (I forget which one), Chuck has the chance to 'lose the intersect' and go back to having a normal life.  To boost ratings and keep people interested, the network decided to keep him going; big mistake.",1360281600,,821,4.506756756756757

3569067,5,B001FB4VYO,"Chuck Bartowski continues his double-life, working at an electrical goods store in Burbank whilst also helping the CIA and NSA deal with threats to American national security. Chuck has the Intersect - the USA's combined database on all known terrorist and criminal threats - downloaded into his brain and is now an invaluable resource to the American government. However, Chuck is desperate to return to his old life and sets out on a mission to locate the creator of the Intersect and get him to remove it from his head...

The second season of Chuck picks up after the events of the first season (truncated by the 2007-08 Writer's Guild of America strike) and, for a while, it's business as usual. The Chuck formula - Chuck solves a spy problem whilst dealing with a more mundane crisis at home or at the store - is intact and remains entertaining, but also risks becoming stale after a few episodes. Luckily, the writers have taken steps to minimise that problem by bringing in a sequential series of multi-episode storylines. In short order, Chuck has to deal with the reappearance of an old girlfriend, try to track down his missing father so he can give his sister away at her wedding, find the original scientists who created the Intersect, deal with a CIA investigation into Sarah's ability to be his handler (given their growing closeness) and deal with a head-on confrontation with FULCRUM, a shadowy and criminal intelligence organisation.

This structure allows the series to sustain 22 episodes without becoming too tedious or repetitive, helped by enjoyable writing and great performances from the regulars and guest stars (Scott Bakula! Tricia Helfer! Chevy Chase!) alike. The writers aren't afraid to give real character development and growth to their recurring actors, particularly Zachary Levi and Yvonne Strahovski as Chuck and Sarah. Their will-they, won't-they relationship may be a long-running series cliche, but is given a few twists here (particularly the fact that Sarah is well aware of Chuck's feeling from the start) that makes it a bit more interesting. Particularly well-done is that it feeds Chuck's character growth, turning him from a listless nerd into a much more capable spy by the end of the season. Adam Baldwin also develops a bit more as action man John Casey over the course of the season, though surprisingly he doesn't have many episodes that focus on his character. Instead he is mainly used for macho comic relief, aside from some nice moments in the final episodes where he grudgingly admits to, if not liking, than at least finding Chuck mildly tolerable and useful.

As usual, the dramatic storylines are counterbalanced by a strong humour quotient. This usually manifests in storylines in the Buy More. Over the course of the season there are multiple changes in management, culminating in the power-crazed Emmett rising to dominance late in the season. We also encounter Lester and Jeff's synth-rock cover band (whose covers are...interesting, to say the least) and feel Morgan's pain as his mother embarks on a noisily passionate relationship with Big Mike. As with the first season, though it's not as prevalent this time around, there is the feeling that you could set a whole series in the Buy More with these characters and it would be just as much fun without the spy stuff.

Overall, the second season of Chuck (****) is relentlessly entertaining. There are a couple of episodes that don't work quite as well as the others, but otherwise this is a terrific season of television which rarely flags or lets up the pace. The only problem is that by its end if feels like the series is pretty much over, and the addition of a few moments at the end of the finale establishing the direction of the third season feels a little incongruous: the series was very nearly cancelled after Season 2 and renewed at the last minute, explaining why the end of the season wraps everything up and then rather abruptly opens up again. The series is available now in the UK (DVD) and USA (DVD, Blu-Ray).",1330732800,,4043,4.906432748538012

Brilliant writing, wonderful acting, with some new faces (at least for me) and a show that is really for the family.  Humorous, sometimes laugh out loud, but usually clever, subtle humor; with a terrific cast who can execute humor or longing, using their bodies and seem totally believable.  And from day one, an emerging love story that will have you pulling for the 2 fantastic leads - Yvonne Strahoski emerges as a very talented actress, and continues growing thru the years.  Zachary Levi does a delightful job as CHUCK, and he has also grown as an actor. Fine directing.

Congrats to the creators, Chris Fedak/Schwartz for providing the intelligent audience with a thinking persons show...that can appeal to a wide audience.

Chuck catches your imagination with the story of a nerd drawn into the spy world of the CIA and NSA. There is a love story thrown in as well, and the characters grow on you with each show. The writers did a suprisingly good job of developing the back stories, considering it was ""just a TV series"". I now try to catch Chuck on TV for every episode.",1305936000,,643,4.322314049586777

The production of the disks are good and it includes a booklet with a very short sypnosis of each episode and a gallery of pictures.

The comedy is great - Chuck and his colleagues, Chuck and his family, Chuck and Casey, and Chuck with Sarah.  The balance seems just right.  There is action but there is too little of it and does not show its full potential.",1302652800,,705,4.2631578947368425

3569286,4,B001FB4VYO,"There is just something about this show. From the first time I saw it, courtesy of the complete first season DVD set being given as a present, I was hooked. From the performance of Chuck, a painfully ordinary guy in extraordinary circumstances who constantly underestimates his own contributions to the heroic deeds of his team, to the humbug personality of Casey, the straight and narrow marine, to the ridiculously beautiful Sarah, femme fatale and bodyguard extraordinaire, to all the damaged persons working at the Buy More, there is a fantastic dysfunctional family that saves the day every time things go to hell.

The episodes are both hilarious, gripping, and frustrating (especially with the conflicted love between Chuck and Sarah and neither's ability to state their feelings outright). Each disc has the deleted scenes for the episodes on that disc, but they play in series and you cannot watch the scenes for just one episode, which is a strange presentation for such sets. The subtitles take some liberties, often conveying the gist of a character's lines but butchering the actual dialogue in the doing. Disc 6 has the final two episodes and the rest of the special features for the set. These are amusing but not the best I've seen. The Chuck versus the Webisodes on Disc 5 are fun to watch and fill some gaps. Oddly, though, Chuck himself does not appear in them... The lack of the entertaining commentaries that were on the first season episodes is another disappointment.

Overall, this is a fine set but has some deficiencies with the special features. However, the enjoyment of the show itself is not impacted in any way. This was one of the best seasons of a show I've ever seen.",1296518400,2,1701,4.862068965517241

So, I usually watch each week's episode at least twice.  The acting is fantastic and I really enjoy the writing.  Since I'm a child of the 1980s, I love all the 80s references.

Now, if they would release the 3D episode as an actual 3D Blu-ray, I would even double dip.

About the excessive grain, that some people here were complaing about, I have no problem with that. This show was produced mainly for TV, and as such shot on 16mm film.

3569880,5,B001FB4VYO,"I can't wait until Monday night every week - Chuck always proves to be a great cure to the ""Mondays"".  During the second season, Chuck and Sarah's relationship deepens, the secrets of Fulcrum are revealed, and we learn the whereabouts of Chuck's long lost father.  The writers exploit a great formula, mixing traditional spy gadgetry and general coolness, with a story about friendship between best friends, the importance of family, and the heartbreak of unrequited love.

Needless to say, Chuck is one of my favorite shows on TV and Season 3 has proved to be just as solid as the first two.  The chemistry between the actors is great, as is the writing and acting. I think that the writers of this show know how to captivate their audience - it's every ordinary guy's dream to stumble into Chuck's position, becoming a super spy with a crazy hot handler and gruff sidekick.

I work a full-time job with long hours and watched all of season 2 in two (very long) evenings... it was THAT good.  I just couldn't stop and go to bed... I had to see what happened next!

3569883,4,B001FB4VYO,"For a show with an almost laughably far-out premise--an underachieving nerd who works at a thinly-veiled surrogate for Best Buy being sucked into the high-stakes world of espionage after having the contents of a government supercomputer visually implanted in his brain--""Chuck"" has developed into a remarkably watchable hour of TV, especially coming as it does out of the vast wasteland that is the major networks these days.  I'm not generally a fan of shows aimed at the ""obsessive nerd"" demographic (I never watched ""Lost,"" caught only a few episodes of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer,"" and gave up on ""Heroes"" after two mediocre seasons), but ""Chuck"" managed to hook me where other shows have failed by taking its clever concept and marrying it to a (generally) skillful combination of action, drama, and comedy.  ""Chuck"" doesn't succeed by avoiding the ridiculousness and implausibility of typical Hollywood spy fare, but by embracing it wholeheartedly at every turn, always with a wink and a nod. In a sense, ""Chuck"" is able to have it both ways--the show's creators get to indulge in all the ludicrous plot developments, unrealistic fight scenes, and last-minute rescues that should be recognizable to viewers of shows like ""24,"" but the show's heavy layers of irony and parody serve to deflect pretty much any criticism that can be directed at it.

Inserting a regular guy into the parallel universe of TV spy shows is an idea with so much obvious potential it's a wonder it wasn't done earlier, and Zachary Levi's performance in the titular role is a large part of the reason ""Chuck"" manages to largely live up to this potentional.  Chuck is the sort of only-on-TV nerd who's  funnier, taller, and better-looking than I am, but Levi still manages to nicely convey the mix of confusion, fear, and indignation faced by a classic underachiever who finds himself in over his head in circumstances he didn't ask for and can't control.  Of course, it helps that Levi is ably backed by Yvonne Strahovski (recently named the 17th-hottest woman on earth by a panel of experts, and a rather expressive actress to boot) as Chuck's CIA handler/love interest Sarah Walker, and Adam Baldwin as his vageuly menacing and fervently dedicated NSA overseer, Major (later Colenel) John Casey.  Casey especially represents an almost perfect meeting of character and actor, with Baldwin combining an imposing glare and snarling voice with expert comic timing, and the writers parceling out occasional insights into his character without unduly softening him.  I'm not a fan of the knee-jerk patriotism and militarism that Casey represents, but he's still one of the more reliably interesting and entertaining characters on TV these days.

While this second season definitely has its share of weaker moments--the inexplicably Nicole Richie-featuring ""Chuck Versus the Cougars"" actually borders on terrible--it still marks a significant improvement from the first season, and manages to cohere pretty well from beginning to end despite a near-constant stream of twists and turns in the plot.  The humor can occasionally be a bit too broad and wacky, resulting in a show that's more amusing than truly funny, but its sly geek-culture references, colorful supporting cast and workplace humor that occasionally hits a bit too close to home should still endear ""Chuck"" to any fans of Simpsons/Office Space-style comedy.  The show works best when it manages to bring together its escapist spy plots and its somewhat more down-to-earth workplace elements, as in the brilliant Thanksgiving episode ""Chuck Versus the Gravitron"", or when it veers out of its usual tone, as in the surprisingly dark ending to the Christmas episode ""Chuck Versus Santa Claus.""  Other episodes evidence a ""Simpsons""-like commitment to fleshing out the show's ancillary characters, best exemplified by ""Chuck Versus Tom Sawyer,"" which humanizes Chuck's shady colleague Jeff and explores his backstory without undercutting his essential creepiness, and also manages to work in a Rush-themed plot that would work pretty much nowhere else on TV.  Viewers also get a slew of memorable guest appearances from notable character actors, from the great Gary Cole filling in Sarah's past while playing her father to Tony Hale as the sniveling new assistant manager at the Buy More to Chevy Chase playing around with his typical bumbling persona as a genially nefarious software tycoon (sports fans should also be pleased by surprisingly able one-off appearances by Michael Strahan and Jerome Bettis as less-than-principled mall employees).

While ""Chuck"" doesn't even approach the level of consistent brilliance shown by cable shows like ""The Wire"" and ""Breaking Bad,"" for sheer entertainment value it's still pretty tough to top.  It's got a likable cast with great chemistry, a solid knowledge of pop culture, and a knack for varying tone and mixing single-episode plots with longer arcs that sets it firmly apart from the glut of interchangeable procedural shows currently clogging the airwaves.  The strike-shortened first season was merely decent, and the current third season has been a bit spotty thus far, so it appears that season two will end probably end up being the best the show has to offer.  That said, ""Chuck"" is definitely worth checking out from the beginning if you haven't already.",1271548800,2,5343,5.215869311551925

3569947,4,B001FB4VYO,"Chuck's been one of my favorite shows for the two and a half seasons it has aired... but, given the competition, this isn't a huge achievement. If you like action and comedy and don't mind the occasional nonsense (silly spy technology, a majority of the world's beautiful women as secret agents, that sort of thing), Chuck is a lot of fun. Adam Baldwin's supporting character is great, and the entire cast works together well.

The biggest issue with this season is the same one Chuck's writers have gotten themselves into in the first and third seasons: the relationship between Chuck and Agent Walker gets annoying. At times you'll feel like you've seen the same episode before - predictable love triangles and unbelievable decisions by the characters are employed too often to drag out the ""will-they-won't-they"" that's standard TV fare. It's not good if you wish the leading lady would shoot the show's protagonist and move on with her life.

The series has a wonderful mix of romance action and comedy that now blends miraculously. The spy stories are now more realistic and better done abd the comedy is also more fun. There is very often a parallel between what is going on in the ultra-serious spy world and what is happening to the bunch of misfits in the Buy More store. This is what makes this show very entertaining because it has a little of seomething for everyone. It is also oen of the last comedies to have an air of freshness about it that is great.

3570192,5,B001FB4VYO,"There isn't much I can say that others haven't; Chuck ranks among my favorite shows on television. I'm writing this review to counteract a few other reviews that mention the lack of a 3D episode in this set, despite it having been advertised as including the 3D episode. It was an honest mistake (on Warner Home Video's part, not Amazon's) and both Amazon and WHV were quick to offer a resolution to the problem. Myself and others have already received an exchange for the 3D edition through WHV, and the product information is now correct (it no longer states that it contains the 3D episode). So, while the one star reviews may have been valid at the time, I feel like it is important to judge Chuck Season 2 on its own merits, now that a solution is available.

For those that aren't aware, the first season of Chuck was cut incredibly short due to the writers strike a couple of years ago. Having said that, the first part of Season 2 is more like the latter half of a first season than a proper Season 2. What I mean by that is that there is still a considerable amount of character development, despite it being the second season. The second half of the season is where Chuck really comes into its own as a series, and where the character development from the first season and a half finally pays off. The ending few episodes of Season 2 are some of the strongest in the series thus far, and they've propelled the show into a third season (literally, it probably wouldn't have happened without the fan campaign, and the excellent final two or three episodes).

The audio and visual quality is what you'd expect from a show that is shot on a budget. The special effects are never going to blow you away, and the image quality certainly isn't reference quality. The transfer presents the material as well as it is ever going to be presented however, and I can respect WHV's decision not to post-process away all of the grain that is visible (taking the detail in the process) like so many studios probably would have. The graininess is really what has defined Chuck for the past two seasons, and it would have been a shame if it were removed entirely.

If for no other reason than to push a fourth season, Chuck Season 2 on Blu-Ray is definitely worth the money (this is coming from someone that generally never buys TV box sets, preferring to catch re-runs or watch old episodes online).",1264723200,2,2392,4.506912442396313

As usual, the Thanksgiving episode at the Buy More is a season high so turn off the phone and clear your schedule for great writing, quirky situations and characters you care about.",1264550400,,638,4.237704918032787
3570277,2,B001FB4VYO,Its a good show but be warned when buying the set I'am still missing the 3d disk and glasses. I contacted Amazon and they said they would send me the dvd.,1264291200,2,154,4.0
3570278,5,B001FB4VYO,"I watch approximately 3 shows a week on tv.  ESPN sports center, Big Bang Theory and Chuck.  I don't like watching tv much so when my wife asked me to watch Chuck with her I had my doubts.  But I conceded and watched a few episodes of the first season with her.  I was so impressed, I proceeded to watch all of season 1 and 2 (TWICE!) in 3 week time span.  I also catch every episode on Monday nights now.  As many other reviews have probably shown the second season picks up right where the first ends.  Chuck is a CIA/NSA asset.  His two handlers are Sarah Walker (his cover girlfriend), and John Casey (fellow buy more employee).  Chuck is being hunted by rogue government agents who want government intel stored in Chucks brain called the intersect.  This leads to great action, fun car chases, chuck being dangled from buildings and comical witty remarks along the way.

There are very few shows that I recommend to people.  This and big bang theory are at the very top of my list.  Oh and for people who watched the first season and unsure about the second season.  The second season is much better in story, plot, acting, guest appearances, action, and about every other aspect of the show.",1264204800,,1197,4.456221198156682
3570279,5,B001FB4VYO,"This second season broadens the Chuckverse even more and, this time, the series gets the 22 episode treatment. Chuck Bartowski is still the human Intersect, never mind that he just wants that thing out of his head already so he can go back to his normal life. Sexy CIA super-agent Sarah Walker and hardcase NSA Major John Casey are still babysitti - er, protecting Chuck from villains of all colors. All three are still out saving the world every week. Chuck is in love with Sarah, that hasn't changed. We think Sarah reciprocates, but it's this whole drama. Oh, and there's a rumor that John Casey may have a heart (but it's just a rumor).

Chuck still provides tech support at the Buy More electronic store, except that as the episodes go on, dude's attendance rate seems to be falling on the shady side. Sarah is still his cover girlfriend, except that she's swapped her hot dog vending gig for selling yogurt at the Orange Orange shop. Casey, he's still a disgruntled employee at the Buy More. It's his cover - except that the disgruntled part is real. Oh, and our agents gain a hi-tech spy lair.

Each episode produces its share of nerdgasm, that much hasn't changed. Chuck is clumsy as ever, is geeky as ever, wears his heart on his sleeve as ever. But, sometimes, actually a lot of times, it's Chuck's good heart that ends up key to resolving the mission. The show maintains the same formula of juxtaposing the main story arc - which is Chuck and his minders engaged in slick secret agent stuff - with oddball levity at the Buy More. From the spy side of things, there's a new player in the form of Fulcrum, a nasty espionage organization desperate to create its own Intersect, and from there shape an army of super-agents. And, by the way, who knew Chevy Chase had it in him to play a credible villain?

On the Buy More side, the series digs deeper into the strange Nerd Herd characters. Several dubious Assistant Managers get a crack to crack the whip. We learn about the rock band Jeffster, and that that loser Jeff used to be a video arcade celeb, and that Chuck's best bud Morgan may actually be the true heart and soul of the Nerd Herd. And the concept of the BuyMoria nation is introduced.

Particularly gratifying are the arcs centering on Chuck's ex-girlfriend Jill (played by the lovely Jordana Brewster) and also on Chuck's efforts to find the father who'd abandoned him and his sister Ellie. We also get a satisfying peek at Sarah and Casey's back stories. And then just when we thought we'd seen the last of him, the dashing secret agent Bryce Larkin pops up here and there, and there goes Chuck again, suffering pangs of jealousy and inadequacy. My favorite episodes are... well, I really liked all of them. But, okay, ""Chuck Versus the Cougars"" and ""Chuck Versus the Delorean"" give us glimpses into Sarah's messed-up past. ""Chuck Versus the Ex"" introduces Chuck's college sweetheart, the one who broke his heart and slept with Bryce Larkin. ""Chuck Versus the Colonel"" and ""Chuck Versus the Ring"" close out the season and bring several plot threads to a head, with regards to Fulcrum, Awesome and Ellie's big wedding, and Chuck and Sarah's ever-shifting relationship. Except that you know, don't you, that in Season 3, the writers find a way to put that romance on hold again?

CHUCK - THE COMPLETE SECOND SEASON comes in 6 discs and with these nifty Special Features: ""Truth, Spies & Regular Guys: Exploring the Mythology of CHUCK""; ""Dude in Distress"" - Explore Some of This Season's Best Action Sequences - this segment also shows how enthused Zachary Levi and Yvonne Strahovski were about doing their own stunts; ""Chuck Versus the Webisodes: Web-Originated Mini-featurettes""; A Real Life Captain Awesome's Tips for Being Awesome"" - these are fun spoofs of those old NBC ""One to Grow On"" PSAs with the guy who plays Devon (a.k.a.

As far as the Blu-Ray is concerned, the picture quality is excellent and the sound is excellent. The graininess I think is intended by the director as it was present in the first season.

3570387,5,B001FB4VYO,"Nerdy comedy, action adventure, and pretty people...the mixture for the perfect show. Chuck's second season improved greatly over its first, a feat I didn't think was possible. The season as a whole is fantastic. There are a few not as good episodes here and there (I'll admit to occasionally fast-forwarding through Chuck vs. Tom Sawyer) but when Chuck is good, it's GOOD. The final two episodes (vs. the Colonel, vs. the Ring) are some of the best hours of comedic television produced by NBC in a long time (this coming from a diehard Office fan). The best part of Chuck, in my opinion, are the throwaway quotes, which this show seems to have mastered (the Tron poster subplot as an example, as are most of Zachary Levi's lines). This DVD set, which includes gag reels and deleted scenes, really encompasses what mkaes Chuck so gosh darn watchable. I'll eat another Subway footlong if we can get a season three with an iota of the charm brought by season two. Highly reccommended for children of the 80's, nerds at heart, or anyone with a sense of humor. Chuck me, this show is good!",1262822400,2,1085,4.65625

3570391,5,B001FB4VYO,"Despite a nine month gap, season 2 pretty much picks up where season 1 left off.  Computer nerd turned government computer/spy Chuck Bartowski (Zachary Levi) has the intersect stuck in his head.  Despite some early hope that a replacement was in place, that doesn't turn out to be true.  So Chuck must keep working with CIA agent Sarah Walker (Yvonne Strahovski) and NSA agent John Casey (Adam Baldwin) as he flashes on information in his head.

Complicating matters is Fulcrum.  This organization of evil agents has really stepped up their search for the intersect, making it highly important to keep Chuck's secret.  Because if they find him, they'll capture him, bisect him, and then kill him.

Of course, all this secrecy means Chuck must keep his job at the Buy More.  And things aren't going well as a consultant comes in trying to make the place more efficient.  And on the home front, sister Ellie (Sarah Lancaster) is planning her wedding to Captain Awesome (Ryan McPartlin) and wanting her father to give her away.  Can Chuck balance all these things?

It took me all of one episode to fall in love with this show during the first season, and very little changed for season two.  That's a great thing.  This show knows how to mix comedy, drama, romance, and action in a perfect mix.  It's never disjointed but always quite engaging.  I can never get enough of it.

Holding it all together are the lovable characters.  I love all of them in their own way.  Okay, the Buy More crew can get annoying at times, but when they are relegated to sub-plots, they are an entertaining distraction.  And the acting for all these characters is still top notch.

Frankly, my only complaint is the increased use of sexually suggest jokes in the second half.  Yes, it's always been part of the show, but it got much worse.  Frankly, there is enough humor without it, and I hope they get away from it in the upcoming third season.

A quick word about this set.  While the picture and sound are great, the 3D episode is only presented in 2D here.  The first shipment of DVDs included this episode in 3D with two pair of glasses.  So if you must have the episode that way, be sure to get the DVDs.

If you aren't already a fan, get season 1.  You'll be hooked in no time.  If you are, you'll want to get this set.  These episodes really are rewatchable.  Personally, I can hardly wait until season 3 premiers.",1262649600,,2400,4.5503512880562065
3570392,5,B001FB4VYO,"My blu-ray copy of CHUCK's complete second season arrived today, and I've already watched half of the episodes.  To quote Devon, it's ""awesome!""

I distrust NBC to the point that I won't watch any programming on the network until it has survived into at least a third season.  LIFE was an excellent program that was cancelled far too soon.  I didn't watch CHUCK as it aired for this exact reason; rather, I have watched it on blu-ray over the past few months, waiting for the third season to start.

Having recently watched the complete first season, I can say, without a doubt, that season two is even better!  The characters are now well-defined enough to allow for some depth, and the actors seem to have really hit their stride with their characters.  Plots are better-developed as well, with a huge amount of humor tossed in the the action, but there's a depth of emotion present as well as Chuck pines for Sarah.  Even Casey gets a little emotional from time to time, within strict limits, of course.

Unfortunately, as was the case with the first season blu-ray, the menus leave a lot to be desired, and the episodes on any given disc run continuously, rather than sending you back to an ""episode selection"" menu in between episodes.  This is fine if you watch all the episodes on a disc in one sitting, but if you take the disc out of the player and come back to it later, it can be a bit of work to figure out where you left off the last time.

Picture-wise, season two looks better on blu-ray than season one did.  But any shortcomings in the discs themselves are completely made up for by the quality of the show itself.  Every minute is a pure delight.  And, now that NBC has given it a third season, I'll actually be watching it as it airs.",1262563200,5,1753,4.454545454545454

From what I could tell it was cute but that was all I knew since I had barely scratched the surface of what the series had been. What I didn't know was it was so much more. I was extremely lucky my stepson knew my tastes in TV. I just sat through the first season non-stop. I rarely do that, but this is one of the best comedy/spy/romance series I have ever seen. If you just took the characters at the Buy More store (uncanny the resemblance to a brick and mortar most of us are familiar with) and made a series it would be good, but the element of a double life with Chuck working with undercover agencies because of his oddly SciFi like gained knowledge of nefarious spies, arms merchants, and terrorists adds yet another great dimension to this entertaining well written show. I certainly plan to buy this second season, and hope that many others do so that it may encourage the network to rethink any possible consideration of cancellation of the series.

3570457,5,B001FB4VYO,"In a world where TV is dominated by the Kardashians (and the like), insane British people, and poorly conceived, poorly acted, and overfunded shows (cough cough THE HILLS cough cough), it is a joy to be able to sit down in my chair, go on the internet, and watch the latest episode of Chuck.

Now, when I say that Chuck is the greatest show I have ever watched, I want you all to understand what I mean by that. I am not some 14-year-old boy who's finally discovered TV and just loves everything he sees no matter what. I've seen Firefly, Buffy, Dollhouse, Trauma (so sad it's getting axed, but it is helping Chuck so who knows), Eureka, House, Bones, Scrubs, Breaking Bad, Weeds, Arrested Development, Alias, Community, White Collar, Castle, Heroes, Lie to Me, The Office, The Loop, Multiple Star Treks, Defying Gravity, Fringe, FlashForward, Psyche, Better off Ted, Mercy, Dexter, Reaper, Mad Men, the Sopranos, Sons of Anarchy, and Life, just to name a few. And while I loved all of those shows (except for Eureka, Mad men, and Sons of Anarchy; there I'm just kind of ""meh""), not one of them can hold a candle to Chuck; well, maybe Firefly or Buffy, but they're still only second and third.

Here's what I like about Chuck: #1 it has Adam Baldwin. I have yet to see him in a movie or television show where I did not just want to BE him (Full Metal Jacket, Firefly, and something else that is escaping my memory); #2 it has an incredibly talented, not to mention flawlessly gorgeous actress by the name of Yvonne Strahovski; #3 Zachary Levi is so innately charming and charismatic that it makes me wonder why lowly creatures such as I are allowed to breathe the same air as him. Now it's this next reason that really makes me love the show: #4 the writing/acting (the first three reasons where just about the actors themselves; this one's about the combination and making of the show). I'm not talking about the fact that they put funny jokes in and have awesome explosions - don't get me wrong, I love the jokes and explosions (what guy doesn't?). I'm talking about how real and lovable the characters are, how well it's written and superbly portrayed that make it so incredibly addictive. No other show keeps me up at night, wanting more and more, needing to see the next episode like a drug. It has been six months and nine days since the last episode of season two, and it will be at least another month and a half until the next season begins (it'll either start in January or March, and I'm so excited to find out which it is) but I am still as excited about it as I was before, if not more so. The characters really seem so real that it's hard to believe that I'm watching a TV show, that it's nothing more than smoke and mirrors. The love between Chuck and Sarah seems so real to me that I wonder how Zachary and Yvonne have yet to get together and start making gorgeous, talented little babies. It's the human element that has attracted me since Ellie first told Chuck to go out and enjoy his birthday party, and it's that same facet of the show that keeps me watching at 4 AM when I have an 8:30 class and a full day ahead of me.",1258502400,,3141,4.413793103448276

Even though I loved the first series, I also thought there were some weaknesses then (most of the Buy More crew were unfunny in the first season, a lot better in the second one).  I was happy to find out 19 episodes will be made of season 3 (initially only 13 were planned), and I really hope for many, many more.  I bought a bunch of other DVDs, but I don't even feel like watching them until I've gone this.  Another spy series that's well-written and entertaining is Burn Notice.

So what do they do?  Ignore the fans, order only 13 episodes for the new season, which won't air until March, & hold off the release date of this collection until February of 2010!  Absurd.

This second season saw Chuck's confidence & frustration increase as he becomes more involved in his own fate as the intersect & falls harder for Sarah Walker, his gorgeous agent/minder.  The already strong supporting cast welcomed Scott Bakula to the table (does NBC have something against this actor, mucking up Quantum Leap so royally & now Chuck?) & Chevy Chase.",1253145600,3,719,4.860655737704918
3570533,3,B001FB4VYO,"Aproximately 5 of the 22 episodes are very good.  I cannot admit to enjoying the comedy, romance and action in the complete series of season 2.  You basically care about Sarah Walker and Chuck to the point you want good things to happen in their romance. They have both had very difficult times growing up-particularly Sarah. Unfortunately the normal course of the romance is heartache and disappointment.  The heartache overwhelms the comedy and adventure--how can you smile about people going through pain.  Many viewers will say there is so much more to enjoy--fine, let Sarah and Chuck pursue the evil doers as a committed couple and then the good times will roll. This perceived pain is referred to as ""angst"" and many viewers (posters on other websites) mention the angst factor as being a major negative to the enjoyment of the show. Knowing the new season (season 3) is most likely going to be filled with love triangles and more of the same unfulfilled love as seasons 1 and 2 may be indicative of some creative shortcomings and makes me very concerned about the upcoming season 3. Some guest stars  hired as a hook trying to get new viewers  in hopes of a 4th season is lame.  The cast of regulars can easily carry the show without adding new faces for the purpose of setting back the romance of Sarah Walker and Chuck.  Bringing in talent for one or two episodes to be the bad guy's is really all that is required.  I understand Law and Orders Harmon is being brought in as an evil doer which makes me feel good about at least one episode.  Refugees from the last Superman Movie and Smallville for purposes of generating alternate love interests will merely intensify the heartache and take away from any otherwise positive attributes of the show.  I have cancelled my order of Chuck Season Two on Blue Ray and have retained an order for the regular cheaper DVD of Chuck Season 2. This show has great potential--it is up to the creators of the show (Fedak and Schwartz) to make or break the show.  New viewers will be needed to make a 4th season possible.  I am rooting for the show to improve and the complete set of all seasons would be worthwhile.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Chuck-The-Complete-Second-Season/dp/B001FB4VYE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Chuck: The Complete Second Season</a>",1252972800,4,2342,4.959079283887468

It's not full of serious drama and heavy issues - it's not fine cuisine or a world class wine, but it's like having the best damn pizza & the best beer on tap you have ever had!  ""Chuck"" is pure comfort - whatever crappy mood I am in I can always put a Chuck DVD in the player and instantly feel better.

Oh and the music is out of this world.  Gnarls Barkley, Crooked Fingers, Bon Iver, et. all this show has a movie quality soundtrack!

3570644,5,B001FB4VYO,"Chuck is awesome.

Really that's probably all that's needed in the review, Chuck is awesome.

For those of you not satisfied by that, I used to watch Chuck simply because it was on before Heroes, and during the first half of season one, it was a great comedy.  It had some nice laughs, great dialogue, lots of little nerdy geek-only humor which really clicked with us cubical dwelling peons.  However, in reality it was just a time filler to find out what mess Hiro from Heroes is getting into.  Towards the end of season one of Chuck and throughout season two, Chuck firmly became the reason I watched NBC on Mondays.  Heroes was DVR'd for later consumption whenever you felt like watching it, but Chuck *must* be watched live because you didn't want to wait any longer to see what happened next on the show.  Season one is a must watch, but Season two took that to a whole new level that kept you waiting on baited breath every week for the next episode.

In many ways, Chuck is a simplistic plotline - guy gets thrown into a situation in a dangerous job and a girl he can never have.  Add in a few useless sidekicks which add comedy relief.  Chuck takes this combination, adds a little bit of Dilbert, a dash of the Matrix, some old-school BBC humor, and somehow mixes that all up into an amazingly funny show.  You add in guest appearances like John Larroquette, Scott Bakula, and Michael Strahan and you end up wondering how on earth anyone could have considered ever canceling this show at any point in its career.

And for crying out loud, it has Adam Baldwin!  Jayne!  Chuck has Jayne!",1245628800,8,1593,4.486111111111111
3570645,5,B001FB4VYO,"When I first decided to write this review, I thought it would be easy to do justice to Chuck. But as I sit here 5 minutes into the process, with not a word typed, it's becoming clear that this is anything but easy. At first glance, Chuck may seem like a lighthearted comedy, given its admittedly ridiculous premise. But once you suspend your disbelief, you will find one of the most entertaining shows on television.

Chuck is your run of the mill computer geek who works at the fictional Buy More (think Best Buy) as a computer technician in the Nerd Herd (read: Geek Squad, except more competent). Life is normal, albeit a bit boring, until one day when he has the entire contents of the CIA and NSA's mainframes downloaded into his brain. Chuck is now a walking, talking human crime fighting supercomputer. In the blink of an eye, he is catapulted into the world of danger, terrorism and espionage, completely unprepared. Indeed what does a screwdriver wielding, Halo playing geek know about disarming nuclear bombs, and neutralizing biological toxins? To help him survive, and thus keeping the only copy of the CIA and NSA's shared mainframe safe, are two undercover agents--Sarah Walker, played by the gorgeous Aussie actress Yvonne Strahovski, and John Casey, played by the brilliantly versatile Adam Baldwin. Their job is to help maintain Chuck's cover as your average geek, and to protect ""The Asset"" at all costs. And thus begins Chuck's double life. By day, Chuck works at the Buy More with Agent Casey as a fellow employee, and the Agent Walker as his cover (fake) girlfriend. By night, Chuck is dragged, sometimes unwillingly, on CIA sanctioned missions so that he could provide the necessary intelligence.

But to say this is just another spy action drama would be a mistake. All of the spy drama and action is just a backdrop to the romance, comedy and heart that makes the show one of a kind. Chuck, as the unlikely hero, is instantly relatable to geeks and non-geeks alike. He is hardly your stereotypical superspy. While agents Casey and Walker get their injuries from dodging bullets and surviving torture, Chuck gets his by tripping and falling on his face while climbing through a window. Yet, despite his endearing incompetence as a spy, his decision to constantly risk his life for his family, friends, and the innocent people around him has earned him the grudging respect of the hardnosed Agent Casey, the genuine love of his fake girlfriend, Agent Sarah Walker, and the admiration and loyalty of television viewers around the world.

Chuck's star crossed relationship with Sarah is tortuously good to watch. At first blush, it may seem entirely too farfetched that the beautiful, glamorous, and yet deadly super spy Sarah Walker could ever fall in love with Chuck, the geek next door. And yet Zack Levi and Yvonne Strahovski have managed to pull it off with aplomb. It seems entirely plausible that Chuck, through his naivety and the selfless acts of heroism, is able to win Sarah's affection. Their relationship is further complicated by the fact that to be an effective protector, Sarah is bound by her duty to not fall for Chuck. And as if the fates weren't cruel enough, they must maintain their cover and pretend to be boyfriend and girlfriend.

Just as entertaining as the romance and spy drama, are the antics Chuck and his bunch of cohorts get into away from the CIA. The entire supporting cast is just wonderful. First up is the versatile Adam Baldwin, who is able to play a merciless NSA agent in one scene, and then turn around and become a comedic foil for Chuck at the Buy More in the next. Imagine a battle hardened veteran who has survived in the battlefields of Iraq and endured two years of torture as a prisoner, being forced to wear a polo and sell electronics with a bunch of bumbling buffoons. Hilarity ensues! Then of course there are Chuck's best friend and fellow nerd Morgan Grimes (played by Joshua Gomez), and Chuck's sister Ellie (Sarah Lancaster) who really grounds Chuck's character and make him believable and gives him the genuine humanity that saves the character from becoming a two dimensional caricature.

All of these elements come together and find a balance that makes the show at once thrilling, comedic, and heartwarming. It faintly echos the best parts of Alias, another spy drama that has earned a special place on this reviewer's DVD shelf. This is undoubtedly one of the best shows NBC has produced in years.",1243900800,12,4478,4.825520833333333

3570647,5,B001FB4VYO,"I only watch two TV shows--Heroes and Chuck. While Heroes is my very favorite current TV show, its audience is more of the young male crowd (and so I watch it alone). The brilliance of Chuck is that it appeals to men and women alike: Chuck, the title character, is a computer nerd who works at a major electronic retailer. There are countless references and inside jokes that appeal to my inner nerd--Dune, Star Wars, Star Trek, Bond, video games, and more. This makes the show a hoot for men. However, there is also a softer side--an intriguing romance-angle for Chuck and CIA handler Sarah, that makes this a great show for women too. And so this is the one show that my wife and I actually watch together, and she loves it as much as I do!

The premise: Chuck accidently receives a mindful of government intelligence information by e-mail. When he sees certain people or objects, he 'flashes' as his mind recalls intelligence data that was put into his head. The CIA sends two 'handlers' to protect him; and he essentially becomes an unwitting spy. In the meantime, he falls in love with one of the handlers--Sarah. Romance, comedy, action, and suspense ensue...

There was some question of whether or not Chuck would see a third season, despite much critical praise. Season Two ended with a twist that has the potential to turn the series in an exciting new direction. The good news is that it has been renewed by NBC for 13 episodes. Apparently they're going to do a time-sharing schedule. My understanding is that this means that there will be few or no reruns. Heroes will run for half of a season on Mondays at 8pm; then, when its season is over, Chuck will take over the same timeslot and run for 13 episodes.

What about the blu-ray quality? Well, I watch the show in high-def on TV, so I certainly want to own it in high-def as well. There were some issues with video quality for the blu-ray release of the first season (a lot of specking), but it was still infinitely better than the standard DVD quality. This seems to be common, as I noticed the same thing with Heroes Season 1 on Blu-ray...For me, even if the quality isn't quite up there with some feature films on Blu, it's worth getting this in high-def...

3570648,5,B001FB4VYO,"This show was not greatly advertised. I got to watch it on other people's recommendations. I am glad I did. It is easily my favorite show on TV right now. And I watch allot of television.

It is a show that refuses to take it self too seriously and just entertains you. There are thousands of shows to watch out there with hundreds of twists and heartbreaking finale's and conspiracies beyond belief. Let's face it there are too many of those types of shows.

This show is just pure fun. Its my TV show to watch to just have fun and relax after a tough day. It is filled with pop references and although it is funny it is action packed as well. Also there is the thing which I enjoy very much and that is the progression of the plot. Things change. Sure they found a nice formula but they are not afraid to play with it and that is refreshing for a show. If you ever need a breather from the craziness on your TV shows this is the show to watch.

It is not a fluke that people of all ages watch this show not only us adults, but also small children (if you don't believe me check the 6 year olds reviewing it on youtube) and it has been a while since I heard of a show that got the whole family together. I have heard this on more than one occasions about Chuck.

I love the three characters. John Casey and ""Sarah"" Lisa ""Walker"" -I am hoping at one point they are going to tell us her name- are just a joy to watch. They are both in the same line of work (in a manner of speaking)..and even though they are so different they complement each other well and their scenes - Adam and Yvonne -  are just a joy to watch. Then there is the awesome Chuck Bartowski (Zach Levi) the main character which is your run of the mill nerd. He is the farthest from 007 one can get but you immediately like the character despite all his weirdness and faults. And of course the clumsiest person on the planet has to fall for a super spy of course that is ""posing"" as his girlfriend... which as a result generates allot of laughs and romance. Especially when Sarah starts falling for Chuck in Season 2.

Another thing that impressed me about the show was the music. I never pay attention to tracks that are used in TV series but this show got my attention. Wonderful songs to complement the show.

And one other thing. When was the last time you saw a show in which the second season was better than the first season? It has not happened often that is for sure.

I cannot wait for March to come around and watch the rest of the story. I already bought these DVD's in Region 2 encoding. I recommend them to anyone! Even if this is not your genre I think you will enjoy this show.",1243382400,,2659,4.159533073929961

""Chuck"" is a great show to watch for an escape.  It doesn't take itself too seriously.  The chemistry between the three main stars (Zachary Levi as Chuck Bartkowski, Yvonne Strahovsky as Sarah Walker, and Adam Baldwin as John Casey) is incredible.  They've moved the improbable relationship between Chuck and Sarah along at the right pace.

One final note.  Look at all the 5 star reviews (and the percent that are 5 stars) that Amazon is getting on Chuck.  That should give you a hint as to how good the show really is...

Granted, there are a few ""sexual"" scenes and a lot of Agent Sarah wearing her underwear, for the most part it's kept to a minimum, and the show is AWESOME.

There are a ton of main characters to relate to, and it's about a nerd who's life is turned upside down. There's real life issues, romance, action and everything inbetween, and it ties together SO WELL.

Men enjoy this show, escpecially the action, and women love it too, it's a great couples show.

Not too unrealistic, but just enough scifi to make it interesting. I love it, I know you will too. Start from Season One for sure, and keep watching.

This show, for whatever reason, has an attractive pull that cannot simply be described other than calling it an addicition.  The blend of comedy, romance, drama, all meld together into a crockpot of goodness that Chuck is, and season 2 took off where Season 1 left and ran with it.

  Season Two takes the Chuckverse to another level. Chuck vs. Tom Sawyer had me laughing so hard that I cried (Chuck flashing on my favorite band to save the day!). The final story arch of the season had me on the edge of my seat (ending with ""I know kung fu""). The two steps forward one step back relationship of Chuck and Sarah had me angry and weeping in the same episode.

Let me come out and say that on air, Chuck season 2 was GREAT! The full season really gave the actors (both main and background) time to really shine and the story to expand. Its the price that gets the bad review here, not the product.

3570807,5,B001FB4VYO,"For me watching CHUCK at the beginning of each week increasingly became one of the high points of my TV watching week. If you can get past the rather silly premise for the show (and if you can, you have a real treat in store), that someone was able to have the entire contents of the CIA mainframe downloaded in his brain, you will discover one of the most entertaining and likable casts on TV. If you don't know CHUCK but are familiar with Josh Schwartz's previous series THE O.C., CHUCK is what that show would have been if you had isolated the Seth/Summer part of the show and made Seth a spy (I've read that Adam Brody, who played Seth, was originally asked to play Chuck, and Summer herself made an appearance in Season One as a potential love interest for our hero). Schwartz saved the Ryan/Marissa/Taylor part for GOSSIP GIRL. If the latter is all about the cool and hip, CHUCK is all about nerds and their universe. If the girls on wear their Jimmy Choos, Chuck wears Chuck T's.

But if you haven't seen the show, here is the main thing you need to know: all the spy stuff is secondary. The real reason to watch CHUCK is the comedy and the romance. The comedy comes from all directions: Chuck, his friend Morgan, the outrageous group of nuts who work at the Buy More store where Chuck has his day job, his NSA handler Casey, and, of course, Mr. Awesome. (I have a theory about Awesome. From various Season One episodes I think the original idea was for Chuck's sister Ellie (played by the gorgeous Sarah Lancaster) and her fianc&eacute; Devon aka Captain Awesome, played by the incredible Ryan McPartlin, to break up, creating some possible romantic tension between Ellie and Morgan.  But I believe that they realized that Awesome was not, as they initially supposed, a disposable character.  And Adam Baldwin as Casey is just a marvel.  In the Season One extra features the creators Schwartz and Fedak reveal that Baldwin was invited to be on the show largely out of fandom (possible of his role of Jayne Cobb on FIREFLY?).  I love the way that Baldwin (no relation to Alec, as many suppose) can flip from action tough guy to comic foil at the drop of a hat.  Trust me, the show is funny and delightful from beginning to end.

But it also has romance!  The tortured attraction between Chuck and his beautiful CIA handler Sarah (played by the marvelous Aussie actress Yvonne Strahovski) is one of the best on TV.  One might imagine that it would be tough to buy the idea of a complete nerd and a knife-wielding glamorous spy could fall in love, but Zachary Levi and Strahovski easily pull it off.  Yvonne Strahovski especially is great at making you feel that Sarah cares more for Chuck than any handler ought to and a lot of the enjoyment of the show focuses on their inability, for professional and other reasons, to act on their feelings.  And all of this is wonderfully complicated by the fake relationship that they have to present to Chuck's friends, since her cover is that she is his girlfriend.

The fate of CHUCK is uncertain as I write this review.  After a great Season Two finale, which has the potential to redefine the series.  But there is a real chance that we won't get to see what happens next.  CHUCK is one of several great series that is on the brink of cancellation.  Despite a passionate fanbase - which includes several major TV critics - CHUCK's ratings have not been great.  Worse, NBC has made one of the worst decisions in the history of television, deciding to gut five hours of scripted primetime television in order to give the extraordinary mediocrity that is Jay Leno the 10 EST/9 CST time slot Monday through Friday.  What possessed the corporate nutjobs in charge of programming to come to this idiotic decision is a mystery we'll be debating for some time to come.  But the decision not only does tremendous harm to television at large, but directly threatens CHUCK.  But as things stand, this great show is in real danger of corporate murder.  Along with two of my other favorite shows, DOLLHOUSE and TERMINATOR: THE SARAH CONNOR CHRONICLES, some really great television is in danger of disappearing.  It is unthinkable that shows as good as these are in danger of cancellation while horrors like Jay Leno and AMERICAN IDLE clog up primetime television.

Will Chuck and Sarah finally find love?  Will he now be a real spy instead of merely a CIA asset?  Will we see Chuck's father again?  Will Chuck go back to work at the Buy More?  Will Morgan?  Will Chuck continue to live with Ellie and Awesome?  Have Casey and Chuck really bonded like it appeared at the end of Season Two?  These are just a few of the questions we want to see answered.  Let's just hope that NBC manages to get past its insanity to preserve one of its most delightful shows.  But with fully one-third of its weeknight primetime schedule given to mediocrity, good television might be in trouble.

Here are the things I enjoy about Chuck:
1) Chuck has high production values.  The action scenes are well done, and the CGI graphic are good.  They've had a few really good driving sequences, and they aren't afraid to blow stuff up on occasion.  Also Casey and Sarah use the correct Weaver Stance when they draw their guns which adds realism to the action scenes.
2) The soundtrack for each episode is normally excellent mixing classics such as, Duran Duran, Twisted Sister, Iggy Pop, Jane's Addiction and Rush (which got it's own show Chuck vs. Tom Sawyer) with new stuff that's really pretty decent.
3) Most importantly the actors are tremendous and have tremendous chemistry. They look like they are having fun, but they also pull off the action and romance really well. This is fun TV.",1240358400,10,929,4.612121212121212

The cast has terrific chemistry and the dialogue is witty and full of pop culture references. Zachary Levi plays Chuck,the nerdy every-man who happens to find himself in the middle of danger and intrigue after ending up with all the government's intel locked in his head. Adam Baldwin (John Casey) and Yvonne Strahovski (Sarah Walker) play his NSA and CIA handlers, assigned to both protect Chuck and use him. Together they save the world one villian at a time while trying to protect Chuck from himself as well as the bad guys.

Every episode leaves me desperate for more, and the second season has been especially excellent. They haven't been afraid of breaking the formula and actually letting things develop and change.  That's one of the things that annoys me most about other shows -- writers show you what they want you to want and then draw that out for seasons and seasons on end. Bleh. But the writers of Chuck haven't and as such it is superb.

3570855,5,B001FB4VYO,"In its superb second season, NBC's ""Chuck"" offers a more fully developed and unique blend of comedy, action, and romance.  Chuck Bartkowski continues his double life: slacker computer nerd at an LA big box electronics store by day and inept government agent by night, thanks to the secret government database called the Intersect emplanted in his brain.  Beautiful CIA agent Sarah Walker is Chuck's handler and bodyguard, with a cover as his girlfriend.  Hardnosed NSA assassin Major John Casey teams with Walker to track Chuck's safety 24 hours a day and to pursue the bad guys the Intersect enables Chuck to identify.

This second season advances several themes over the course of the year.  The impromptu team of Walker, Casey, and Bartkowski get increasingly difficult assignments to stop various villains and foil their nefarious plots, in which the untrained Chuck begins to demonstrate, often hilariously, the potential to muddle through as an agent.

A second theme is the approaching wedding of Chuck's sister Ellie and her fiance ""Captain Awesome.""  Chuck has rashly promised Ellie to track down their missing father for the wedding, a promise that will have a dramatic impact on the last episodes of the season.

A third theme is the rogue organization FULCRUM's pursuit of the Intersect.  Chuck is in weekly danger of having his cover blown and either being kidnapped by FULCRUM or being sequestered for his own safety by the government in an underground bunker away from family and friends.

The fourth and perhaps most important theme is the slowly blossoming romance between Chuck and Sarah, as their affection for each other begins to strain Sarah's professionalism and Chuck's willingness to live under a cover story.

Chuck's best buddy Morgan and the slacker crew at the BuyMore continue to offer comic relief, whether avoiding work, staging insane stockroom competitions, or trying to hijack ""Awesome's"" bachelor party.  Special guests during the season include Sarah's professional con-man father, the suitably awesome parents of Ellie's fiance, and Chuck's ex-college roommate and girlfriend, neither of whom are what they seem.

3570861,5,B001FB4VYO,"Warning!  The following review of Season Two-in-progress contains spoilers!  If you want to remain spoiler free, don't read it.

CHUCK was one of many excellent shows to debut in the fall of 2007 and like show in the same time slot (the even better TERMINATOR: THE SARAH CONNOR CHRONICLES), has gotten even better in Season Two.  Frankly, if this wasn't the age of the DVR, I wouldn't be able to watch CHUCK at all.  While I like it and always look forward to seeing it, it doesn't quite make the ""must see"" level that TTCC does.  The same holds true for the other Josh Schwartz creation in the same time slot, GOSSIP GIRL.  I enjoy both, but I absolutely must see TSCC.

In Season One of CHUCK, one of the central items of interest was Chuck's burgeoning romantic attachment to his handler/guard Sarah Walker (played by the drop-dead gorgeous Aussie Yvonne Strahovski -- absolutely ever show on TV seems to have at least one British or Australian actor on it, from Anna Friel on the tragically cancelled PUSHING DAISIES to Rachel Griffiths and Matthew Rhys on BROTHERS AND SISTERS to Ed Westwick as Chuck Bass on GOSSIP GIRL -- and needless to say, we could go on in this vein for a very, very long time).  While Sarah partially reciprocated, in Season Two the burden of interest switches over to Sarah, Chuck having decided that they can't be involved for a variety of reasons.  Sarah has to balance her attraction to Chuck with her professional need to safeguard both his life and a CIA asset.

My biggest complaint with Season One was the dominant role that Chuck's best friend Morgan played on the show.  Though many fans enjoyed him, I found his presence to be an unceasing source of irritation.  Thankfully he is more subdued in Season Two, though he is still very much alive.  The entire Buy More staff, where Chuck works as a Nerd Herder, plays a larger role in Season Two.  I have to confess that I have enjoyed them more than I would have anticipated in Season Two.

The one area of the show that I think could improve is the use of Adam Baldwin as Casey, the other federal agent assigned to watch over Chuck, and one far more willing to follow orders (at one point it looked as if Casey was going to kill Chuck on orders).  My complaint is that Casey is two much of a two-dimensional, cardboardish character.  This is not Adam Baldwin's fault, but the failure to write him as a more interesting character.  Contrast this with Baldwin's marvelous character on FIREFLY, Jayne Cobb.  Though upon seeing one or two episodes of that show you could imagine the relatively dumb but physically effective Jayne was also a flat character, a number of episodes revealed deeper dimensions to him.  In the great episode ""Ariel,"" where Mal comes close to killing Jayne, we see far more to Jayne than we previously had.  Jayne was, in fact, a rather simple, two dimensional character played with great depth by Baldwin.  So far the powers that be on CHUCK have not allowed Baldwin to display the same kind of depth.  I enjoy him on the show, but not as much as we all should.  Hopefully they'll make Casey a more interesting character in the future.  Of course, the writers on CHUCK lack the ability to combine extraordinary humor with great action that Joss Whedon and his marvelous team of writers can achieve (on FIREFLY Jayne had a long string of memorable one-liners, like his response to Mal's instructions that the point of interrogating one prisoner was to scare, not hurt, him:  ""Pain is scary""; so far while Baldwin is naturally funny and very good at action sequences, he has had few moments as his best on FIREFLY).

I have to confess that I'm amazed on one level that I'm still enjoying the show.  When it first debuted I was a tad dubious simply because the premise was, to put is mildly, a tad lame.  It was really hard to see how Chuck (and the writers) was going to be able to perpetually exploit the information that had been downloaded into his head.  It seemed a plot more geared to a movie rather than a TV series.  But amazingly the writers have managed to keep everything really interesting and fun.  There is a great deal that one must suspend one's disbelief over (e.g., that they would allow both the Intersect [Chuck] and two top field agents to work menial jobs).  Still, if you are willing to make that initial leap, everything else will be enjoyable.  It isn't like PRISON BREAK, for instance, which initially makes you swallow a nearly impossible premise, and then assaults you with an uncountable number of additional absurdities.

CHUCK is not a great show, but it is a fun one.  If you don't take it too seriously and just allow yourself to have a good time, it can result in one of the most fun hours on TV.

Additional side note:  I'm frankly quite concerned about the future of both CHUCK and scripted television in general.  For years we've been assaulted either with a string of awful reality shows that no thinking individual could possibly abide.  Fortunately for TV execs, most American TV viewers cannot be described as thinking individuals.  Therefore, completely awful shows like SURVIVOR and DANCING WITH THE STARS and AMERICAN IDOL (the latter the most persistent promotion of mediocrity ever seen on TV) manage to thrive, while absolutely brilliant shows like MAD MEN, PUSHING DAISIES, BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, and FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS struggle to attract viewers.  On the other hand, the successful scripted shows that attract viewers are for the most part critical failures, like nearly the entire schedule for CBS, which largely consists of dreadful, barely distinguishable police procedurals.  Even the Emmys, which tends to reward the mediocre, refuses to give awards to the terrible CBS shows.  So we have fewer and fewer highly successful scripted shows on the one hand and on the other hand the most successful scripted shows largely consisting of terrible procedurals.

There have been two recent developments that have caused me more concern about the short-term fate of television more than any other.  First, ABC cancelled PUSHING DAISIES, a series that can only be described as a work of genius and one of the most brilliantly original series in the history of TV.  In the 2008 Emmys it got more nominations than any other series on TV.  But because of falling viewership in its second season, ABC cancelled it.  It instantly joins FIREFLY and FREAKS AND GEEKS as one of the most tragic cancellations in the history of TV.  At the same time, ABC cancelled other good series, like ELI STONE, while cutting back the number of episodes they had ordered for potentially interesting series like CASTLE and CUPID.  All of this betokens a dying interest in developing scripted television series.

The second recent development is far more pernicious and truly troubling.  NBC has just announced that Jay Leno will after his departure from his late night show, will star in a new political humor show scheduled each evening at 10 EST/9 CST.  Sadly, this show will be shown Monday through Friday.  This means the immediate death of five scripted television series.  At one point I was watching more NBC series than any other network.  Currently I'm down to only CHUCK, the increasingly disappointing HEROES, and the still brilliant THE OFFICE and 30 ROCK.  I won't even get into the absurdity of the politically dim Jay Leno doing a show on political humor.  Why watch Leno when you can watch John Stewart and Stephen Colbert instead?  I'm praying for the failure of Leno's show.  If it succeeds, who can say what horrid idea the networks will create next?

Clearly, network television is looking to cut costs.  By eliminating five scripted series and putting a ultra-cheap show in their place, NBC is passionately embracing budget over quality.  ABC cancelled its best series in order to save money.  CBS already had the worst (though ironically the most widely viewed) schedule of any network.  Ironically, some of the best things on TV is taking place on FOX, where Kevin Reilly, formerly head of programming at NBC, has taken over and where he is developing some really interesting scripted TV shows, like DOLLHOUSE and VIRTUOSITY.

But the great hope for fans of TV is probably going to be cable.  It is doubtful that TRUE BLOOD would have gotten many viewers on one of the major networks, but it does well enough on HBO to have a safe future.  Virtually no one watches MAD MEN, which is one of the finest shows on TV, but on the lightly-watched AMC, it is in no danger whatsoever of cancellation.  Now AMC is developing a new series based on Kim Stanley Robinson's Mars Trilogy, tentatively titled after the first novel in the series, RED MARS.  DEXTER is not heavily watched on Showtime, but by cable standards it is a huge hit.  I believe that in the future fans of quality television are going to find ABC, NBC, and CBS increasingly hostile.  FOX is currently doing well, but probably only because of Kevin Reilly.  Should he leave then I'm sure that network's interest in quality television will go away as well.  I think the future of quality TV probably lies with HBO, F/X, Showtime, A&E, AMC, and other cable networks.  I also wouldn't mind seeing more creators of TV series attempt syndication.  LEGEND OF THE SEEKER is currently doing well as one of the few syndicated first-run shows since XENA.  But whatever the future of television, I believe that ABC, NBC, and CBS will play an increasingly less important role.",1229126400,,9476,4.744498777506112
