2120749,4,B0002V23CU,I remember this as if it was yesterday. I was in 4th grade watching the spaceship go  up and then exploded. It was so so sad. No one knew this would happen but there were signs everywhere. Like the titanic there were signs and no one took heed. Except one man who the others fought tooth and nail. Lives were lost when they didn't have to be. Lets remember the people who lost their lives for no reason. This was a good movie. What I wanted to see was how their families reacted to this.,1332892800,,487,4.126315789473685
2120750,4,B0002V23CU,I think this a great movie that gives you a chance to see the crew from a personal point of view. Also all the mistakes NASA and Morton Thiacal made are in this movie. The cast is great and makes me hungry for more information and insite on this tragic event in history.,1235606400,11,270,4.113207547169812
2120751,5,B0002V23CU,"This 3-DVD set chronicles the events surrounding the tragic 1986 launch of STS-51 - the Challenger's last mission. It was a mission that lasted only 73 seconds and ended with the loss of the speace shuttle & its 7 crew members. Not only does the series show in detail the actual launch itself, but it includes actual NASA footage explaining what is happening as the mission progressed, showing the black plume of smoke that appeared on the right SRB at liftoff, then the flame as it burned through the external tank, and then the destruction of the shuttle itself. It also includes NASA training footage of the crew, including the 'Vomit Comet', and the press events after the disaster. Prominent by inclusion are the official TV address by President Reagan, the crew memorial service which was addressed by the President & shows many of the crew's families, and the crew transfer - when the crew's bodies are brought back to an Air Force base & placed aboard a transport plane. Also included are several hours of testimony from the Rogers Commission (appointed by President Reagan to investigate the accident), including testimony from NASA officials, MT engineer Roger Boisjoly (the man who first warned of the risk of launching), Lawrence Mulloy, and many others. For anyone wanting to learn as much about the shortest (and arguably most tragic) shuttle mission, this 3-DVD set is as complete as you can get. Highly recommended.",1210377600,2,1431,4.941908713692946
2120752,4,B0002V23CU,"The Challenger disaster was an emotional letdown after years and years of space successes.  Suddenly, what had seemed routine was demonstrated to be not so routine after all.

Roughly four years after the fact this made for TV movie came out and I remember watching it with interest at the time.  Peter Boyle's portrayal of Roger Boisjoly, the Morton Thiokol engineer that had opposed the launch of Challenger, was the high point of the movie for me.

Karen Allen played an effervescent Christa Mcauliffe.  Upon my first viewing I was convinced that her portrayal was hopelessly idealized portraying Mcauliffe as a self sacrificing super-teacher but I have since learned that in real life Christa Mcauliffe was in fact much like the person portrayed in the movie.

As long as one remembers that this is a docu-drama with some dramatic license employed the movie remains enjoyable in spite of being a bit sappy in places.  The subject matter is something I think is very worthwhile and I appreciate that the story has been told and preserved in the form of this movie.",1189382400,24,1067,4.861878453038674
2120753,5,B0002V23CU,"Twenty-two and 1/2 years after the Challenger explosion, teacher-in-space alternate Barbara Morgan finally entered space.  This 20th anniversary set is a very handsome tribute to the lost STS-51L crew and is also an important documentary for those interested in Morgan.  The main reason I purchased this set is for the 2 1/2 hours of pre-flight training footage which I found fascinating (despite large chunks without sound).  Much of this footage focused on Christa McAuliffe and Barbara Morgan.  As McAuliffe's back-up, Morgan was trained just as well (even completing a flight on a T-38 jet) and, in much of this footage, is seen asking questions, taking notes, and very much involved in planning the classes McAuliffe was to teach while in space.  The most interesting segment, to me, was when McAuliffe was walking through her lesson plans while onboard the shuttle (or, perhaps, a shuttle replica for training purposes).  McAuliffe being instructed on how to eat while in space (with extra instruction by shuttle veteran Judy Resnik) was also some of the more interesting parts of the preflight training section (Morgan received the meal tray). Footage is included of McAuliffe and Morgan watching the launch of Mission 61-A at the Kennedy Space Center, which would be the final successful flight of Challenger. It was obviously a very emotional experience for them.  Although McAuliffe and Morgan are the main focus of the footage, there is also a lot of segments with Commander Francis ""Dick"" Scobee, Pilot Michael Smith, Mission Specialists Judith Resnik, Ellison Onizuka, and Ronald McNair, and Payload Specialist Gregory Jarvis.

Other things included in this set are:
Disc 1:
A timeline of the accident (23:49) and summary of the history and cause of the accident and findings of the commission (29:39).
President Reagan's comments soon after learning of the tragedy (9:06) [this footage is a little dark as it appears to be taken during a luncheon or dinner with dim lighting] and his speech to the nation given instead of the scheduled State of the Union address (4:22)
Memorial Service which showed many family members of the crew (28:25)
The hearses carrying the caskets of the crew being transported from the Kennedy Space Center on April 29, 1986. (50:43)
Preflight footage (2:25:15)

Disc 2:
First Press Conference after the tragedy (18:22)
Flight Director Press Conference (held the day after the accident) (28:02)
Salvage Briefing from February 1986 (22:12)
Conference after the right solid rocket booster was found (36:30)
Description of joint rotation and its relationship to the Challenger disaster (17:26)
SRB Radiography--NASA-made tape showing how SRB parts can be inspected using radiography.  The date of this footage is not listed but it was probably pre-disaster. (19:23)
Several different presentations of the launch, including one taken from a TV van and another with footage from mission control.  The last two segments show different camera angles used as evidence in the investigation.  Challenger was, as author of ""The Challenger Launch Decision"" Diane Vaughan stated, ""the most well-recorded disaster ever."" Footage times: (13:12), (23:34), (9:24), (15:00), (25:57)

Disc 3:
This disc contains testimony from the ""Rogers Commission"" that investigated the disaster.  Astronauts Sally Ride and Neil Armstrong were included in the panel who listened to the testimony and often asked questions. As would be expected, a lot of it is dry and technical but there are some eye-opening moments.
Morton-Thiokol testimony:
February 25, 1986 senior scientist Roger Boisjoly and supervisor for metallic rocket motor cases Arnold Thompson discuss their concerns about the joint seals well before the disaster.  Boisjoly was the leading expert on o-rings and believed that temperature was a ""discriminator"" in the capacity for the seals to work correctly.  He was steadfastly against the launch. Peter Boyle played him in the 1990 motion picture about Challenger.(1:34:47)
Director of the Solid Rocket motor Project Allan McDonald on the infamous January 27 teleconference between Thiokol and Marshall Space Flight Center.  He was against launch for several reasons (not just temperature) and believed the philosophy had changed during that telecon in that they now had to prove the shuttle could not launch.(1:22:43)
February 25, 1986 Thiokol manager Robert Lund, VP Joe Kilminster, and engineer Brian Russell about the change in the decision to launch.  Lund didn't come off well.  He smiled a lot and, when grilled on changing his mind, said something about Monday Night QB, and was very evasive.  While Kilminster did not think (or did not say he thought) there was pressure from Marshall to agree to launch. Russell (who did not vote for launch) believed there was pressure.(37:17)

Marshall:
February 11, 1986 SRB manager Lawrence Mulloy--often considered, maybe unfairly, as the villain in the Challenger disaster--describes the workings of the SRB with diagrams and a model of the shuttle. (1:22:00)
2/11/86 Mulloy returns for an afternoon briefing after Richard Cook's testimony (see below).  Talks about temperature concerns on seals, what erosion is, etc. (16:33)
Mulloy and Deputy Director of Science and Engineering George Hardy on the decision to launch. Most of the testimony is from Mulloy.  At the 47 minute point, he discusses his infamous comment ""My god, Thiokol, when do you want me to launch, next April?"" (also shown at the intro to disc 1) and is very evasive for obvious reasons.  William Rogers was puzzled by the 5 minute recess given to the Thiokol engineers, why the engineers did not influence Mulloy's decision more, and why Mulloy dismissed a recommendation for the temperature to reach 40 degrees before launch because, according to Thiokol, it made no sense because the engineers had placed the limit at 53 degrees.  As Rogers pointed out, this temp was still better than the temperature at launch time.  At the 1:11 point, Mulloy discusses the infamous engineering/management hat comment. (1:38:48)
February 27, 1986 engineer Ben Powers talks about the Jan 27 telecon.  He was the only Marshall engineer to side with Thiokol against launch so he was, obviously, less evasive in answering questions and therefore seemed more credible. (21:04)

Others:
February 11, 1986 Richard Cook NASA budget analyst, explains his July 23, 1985 memorandum which created a media stir because it noted that there was seal erosion on 12 previous shuttle launches, one of which affected the  secondary o-ring, indicating personnel were well aware of the potentially catastrophic seal problem.  The testimony didn't seem that heavy to me.  Cook didn't point fingers and claimed his memo was only for budgetary purposes. (52:30)
Audio only of the January 27 scrub.  At first, reports from shuttle launch control were optimistic, but a stubborn bolt on the access handle to a hatch door which caused a microswitch to not indicate the door was closed, lead to delays.  A drill was used but the battery-pack was too weak, so a hacksaw was requested.  By the time the bolt was removed, weather conditions at the shuttle landing facility for a return to launch site worsened and the flight was delayed until the next day which, unfortunately, was colder. (17:13)

To be more complete, I would have liked to see network coverage of the accident but, probably, copyright reasons would not have made this addition possible.  Also, the NASA-made 1997 25 Years series video ""Challenger Disaster and Investigation"" which showed the crew getting prepped for launch just before entering the orbiter is not included which is unfortunate due to the poor quality of the video release (inexplicably recorded at EP).  Otherwise, this set is beautifully done with touching music and video footage on the menu screen, and a reverent all-black case.  It is worth its price to anyone interested in Challenger as well as Barbara Morgan.",1187654400,4,7951,5.256126482213439
2120754,5,B0002V23CU,"It seems that since its inception, television has reported on events which became the iconic event of a particular decade (i.e., Kennedy Assassination--1960s, Watergate--1970s, etc.).  For those who lived through the 1980s the Challenger disaster was such an event.  This tape does an effective job of providing ABC news reports of events prior to, during, and after the disaster.  The program provides an actual sense of how the explosion was reported at the time and Americans' visceral reaction to the event.  I used portions of the tape in a history of television course I taught.  The reports were very effective in creating an emotional link from today's students to their counterparts back in the 1980s who were grappling with their own sense of helplessness and grief over world events they had no power to control, but which they felt compelled to respond towards.",1180742400,2,873,5.076923076923077
2120755,5,B0002V23CU,"Spacecraft Films has done a fabulous job of chronicling America's space program by producing a series of multi-set, comprehensive DVD packages in recent years that cover virtually all aspects of manned spaceflight -- including deluxe programs highlighting ""Project Mercury"", ""Project Gemini"", ""The Mighty Saturns"", and various detailed DVD collections focusing on the many individual ""Apollo"" missions.

And this 3-Disc DVD set -- ""Challenger"" -- continues that rich tradition of detail and thoroughness that has become a trademark stamped on all ""Spacecraft Films"" productions.

I suppose a person could ask: How in the world could a company market a three-disc set for a Space Shuttle mission that lasted a mere 73 seconds? A fair enough question. But as with all DVDs produced by Mark Gray and Spacecraft Films, there's a lot more to these ""SF"" DVD collector's editions than just the ""mission"" highlights and video. A large amount of ""pre-flight"" NASA film and videotape footage goes into each ""Spacecraft"" DVD product too. And that is the case with this ""Challenger"" set as well. (See below for a detailed look at the contents of this set, which contains more than 12 hours of material.)

The all-too-short ""Challenger"" flight on January 28, 1986, was the 25th Space Shuttle mission, and turned out to be the worst tragedy in the history of manned spaceflight, when the orbiter exploded above Florida, just 1 minute and 13 seconds after lifting off from Pad 39B of the Kennedy Space Center at 11:38:00 AM (EST).

Each of the seven crew members aboard the Challenger spacecraft perished in the terrible accident....an accident which was studied and probed at length following the disastrous event. And just about every possible piece of film and video associated with Challenger's last flight, as well as the subsequent investigation of Shuttle Mission ""STS-51L"", can be found within this excellent 3-DVD ""20th Anniversary Edition"" package.

-----------------------------------

Some DVD Info & Specs:

The all-black packaging and disc design is simple and elegantly-understated. A four-page booklet is included, detailing the contents of each of the three discs.

All video is in the Full-Frame ratio of 1.33:1. Audio is Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo. No subtitles.

The Main Menus contain background music and are animated with film clips of the Challenger crew in training. A nicely-done 2-minute Challenger tribute video montage is shown upon disc load-up for Discs 1 and 2 (it is skippable however).

The discs are Region-Free. This set comes packaged in a thick (Alpha-style) 3-Disc keepcase.

-----------------------------------

Tuesday, January 28th, 1986, is a date that most Americans who are old enough will vividly remember for the rest of their lives....myself included. And this set of DVDs, although disturbing in many ways, is by far the best and most-detailed look at that terrible day and the vast investigation that followed the Challenger tragedy.

I salute Spacecraft Films for making these discs (and other DVDs that trace the history of America's remarkable journey into space) available to the mass market.",1155772800,19,8747,5.445684523809524

2120778,3,B0002V23CU,"Interesting, especially the politics behind the shuttle program.  I also liked the family scenes and the bond that the seven astronauts formed.

But Heavens...the actors for both Judy and Christa were way off.

Both Christa and Judy in reality had BROWN eyes and rather dark complexions, well Christa's wasn't as olive as Judy's was, but Christa didn't have the pale, freckled complexion that Karen Allen has...but both of the actresses erroneously had BLUE eyes and pale skin.

Karen's hair was too light also and she had freckles...the real Christa had DARK brown hair and NO freckles.

And Karen was too smiley and too loud; Christa, was energetic and sometimes a bit charismatic, was much more down-to-earth and serious and also a highly sensitive person (HSP).

And Christa's famous speech where she wept as she told us that she was taking ten souls with her...Karen didn't quite catch Christa's real emotion too well; Karen was STILL smiling too much...the real Christa, while happy, was in TEARS and was not smiling; she was too overwhelmed with emotion.

It would have been nice to capture more of Judy's backstory also...Judy was a rather interesting woman with some baggage from her parents' bitter divorce and surviving a toxic mother who sometimes cruelly cut her daughter down.

And Judy did have a dad, stepmum, a brother, and two stepsisters she was close to; it was too bad they weren't featured in this film.

The ending was nice and haunting, though...they only have seconds to live...it was almost like the ending of the latest *Diana* film (about the Princess of Wales who also died a heroic death; like Judy, Diana was thirty-six when she died) in November of 2013.",1435190400,,1686,4.929328621908128

2120786,5,B0002V23CU,"This is a 1990 dramatization about the crew that was on the final mission of the space shuttle Challenger.  It is a dramatization and undoubtedly took a few liberties from the facts, but I think, overall, that they did a good job.  I have read several accounts of both the crew and the accident, but that was long ago and the books were published not long after the tragedy.

The movie does try to be thorough:  we learn something about each of the crew members and about the controversy of launching it on that cold morning, most of that depicted here being from the engineers of Morton Thiokol, maker of the solid rocket boosters, and the NASA managers who oversaw the entire shuttle project.

There are books and online sources that can bring those interested more up-to-date.  But I did enjoy and actually learned a fair amount from this movie.",1426636800,,848,4.62

2120788,5,B0002V23CU,"""Challenger"" is a must-see for anyone remotely interested in the very human story of the US space program in general, and the Challenger disaster in particular. Although it can, at times, be sentimental and a bit syrupy-sweet in its depiction of the Challenger crew, ""Challenger"" is a worthy companion to such films and made-for-TV works as ""Apollo 13"" and ""The Right Stuff"", ""From the Earth to the Moon."" But be warned; ""Challenger"" is a tear jerker.

Well acted, nicely written, possessing a good music score, educational, and suitable for the entire family regardless of age, ""Challenger"" is a fine work. One which the crew of Challenger would, no doubt, be proud of.",1425168000,,670,4.982142857142857

2120796,5,B0002V23CU,"This is a video about the crew of  what became the Challenger's last mission in the months, weeks, and days leading up to its final launch. This movie, in good taste, omits showing their final outcome, but rather gently focuses on each of the crews' personal lives and relationships, as well as reenactments of events behind the scenes that lead up to the disaster and how it probably could have been (should have been) prevented.

Although I was touched by the actors' portrayals in this ""Challenger"" story TV movie, I felt I needed to know the individuals better by reviewing documentaries featuring actual footage of the real people involved. One such documentary, (also available on Amazon.com) that you may want to consider viewing is ""Christa McAuliffe: Reach for the Stars,"" which focuses on this dynamic school teacher's personality, conviction, and dedication to education, along with how she touched so many lives among family, friends, colleagues, community, nation and internationally.

In any case, the ""Challenger"" TV movie is worth the watch. I've been a fan of Karen Allen since I saw her in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" and Peter Boyle being in this film, along with other well-known actors, Barry Bostwick, Angela Bassett, Richard Jenkins, Joe Morton, Lane Smith and other familiar faces, who managed to give personality to their roles and make you feel for them and, ultimately, those whom they would leave behind.",1416700800,,1430,5.076595744680851

This is a must-see for everyone following the shuttle progam in its early days in the 1980's like myself. From the looks of the actors (who were picked to resemble the actual crew) to every other detail, this movie is a perfect representation of how the shuttle program worked and how it was perceived in those days when 'the sky seemed to be no limit'.",1402704000,,435,4.253012048192771

2120803,4,B0002V23CU,"In the tradition of The Right Stuff and Apollo 13 (but not quite up to their budget and quality level, but still a good piece) this shows the events leading up to the Challenger disaster (but we don't actually see the disaster or even get an ending card telling us, so it ends on an up beat note) centering mostly around the teacher (played by Karen Allen Indy's gal pal in Raiders of the Lost Ark), Sharon Christa McAuliffe, but also showing the rest of the crew and the solid booster and launch people.  It gives you a good picture of what was going on behind their backs and what was going on with them at the same time.  It's a TV dramatization so not everything you see and hear may be totally true (and the families were not in favor of this presentation) but we still get a fair idea of what things were like.  Also featured is Joe Morton (The Borther from Another Planet, the boss in Speed, Henry in Eureka, Dyson in T2, among other films and TV shows).  It's a made for TV movie and not for HBO so one can almost NEVER give a 5 star rating.  But it's a solid production and the Amazon Instant video quality is every bit as goo as the DVD (it's square TV format in 480i resolution and has not been re-mastered or enhance, but it still good quality).  If you want to really understand the Challenger Disaster PAIR this up with another offering called the THE CHALLENGER which is a five star BBC production with William Hurt and Bruce Greenwood showing the works in the committee investigating the disaster centering around Dr. Feynman the only independent investigator (it's only on Amazon Instant and at a good price).  These two Challenger movies give you a good overview with the normal Hollywood cooking ingredients.",1393200000,6,1727,4.480891719745223
2120804,3,B0002V23CU,"If you can get past all the 'cheese'...there are some worthy elements to this 80's TV special.  It's mostly a human drama focusing on the astronauts involved but there is also attention given to the engineers and administrators involved with the SRBs and the o-rings.  I really enjoyed the scene of the conference call between NASA and Morton Thiokol discussing the o-ring.  I was more interested in the engineering aspects and the failure itself, but I nevertheless thought the whole program was fairly well done given that it was a made for TV special.  The program ends prior to the tragedy so there is no play given to the aftermath or investigation.  Bottom line, if you are a fan of space program this is worth watching.  It's not great but it's not terrible either and there are a few worthy moments.",1389571200,,807,4.6879432624113475

Some will disagree but there was always some degree of launch fever. Right up thru STS-135. Losing Challeneger and Columbia were preventable accidents if the managers listened to their engineers and this movie gives you a very realistic look at the bureaucracy that has and always will be part of nasa until America accepts some risk in space exploration.",1376784000,22,495,4.904761904761905

2120809,5,B0002V23CU,"On Tuesday, January 28th, 1986, the space shuttle Challenger lifted off from Earth.  Approximately 77 seconds later, the shuttle exploded, leaving millions watching on the ground and on television shocked and saddened.  This fine made-for-tv movie does a very good job of explaining the events leading up to the explosion.

Karen Allen stars as Christa McAuliffe.  Christa was to be the first civilian launched into space.  A teacher, Christa was to perform experiments and give lessons while in orbit.  Barry Bostwick stars as Dick Scobee.  Scobee was the mission commander and had overall command of the shuttle.  Peter Boyle stars as Roger Boisjoly. Boisjoly was an engineer from Morton Thiokol; a firm that developed the o-rings for the shuttle's solid rocket boosters.  Boisjoly was against launching the shuttle in cold temperatures due to the uncertain nature of the o-rings sealing correctly.

The movie takes the viewer through the six months leading up to the launch date.  Included are Christa's selection and training, along with the rest of the crew (Ellison Onizuka, Ron McNair Judith Resnick, Michael Smith, and Greg Jarvis).

I especially enjoyed watching the controversy over the o-rings and other mechanical aspects.  The shots from the launch pad on the day of the launch showing huge icicles hanging off should have been enough evidence to stop the launch.

I recommend this movie very highly.  The acting is good, and the events leading up to the launch are interesting to watch.  This movie does a good job of portraying one of the saddest days in our nation's history.",1365984000,6,1591,5.108527131782946

2120812,4,B0002V23CU,"First for the good news. This is the most complete accounting of the Challenger disaster available on video. For those who remember when Madacy was releasing everything-and-the-kitchen sink from the video fringes on DVD, the most vital parts of this set--the live launch sequence and NASA's half-hour video explanation of the accident--are the same as that included on Madacy's NASA-Volume 2 collection, with happens to have the benefit of being on a commercial DVD pressing. Besides those two items, the ""Challenger"" mini-doc on disc one of this collection, and the excerpts from the congressional hearings (which are kind of dull, as it really amounts to a white-wash of NASA), are really the only other necessary parts to this story. Now for the ""bad"" news. All the discs are DVD-Rs, and I was very unhappy to find that two of the discs have circular scratches on them, either from how they were stored or from a damaged DVD recordable disk drive. Poor quality control for the price. As for the video quality of the material, there was obviously no attempt at re-mastering the video, and it looks like the videos were ported directly from VHS. I think this is way over-priced, but nevertheless I will give the manufacturer its due for actually searching out all available material on the subject, and for space flight completest there simply isn't anyone out there doing this kind of work.",1353456000,,1392,4.927659574468085

2120814,2,B0002V23CU,"For the most part I assume this movie was accurate as to the scientific details of Challenger and what went wrong.  However, the ending was terrible.  It ends by showing Challenger going off into space leaving the audience at a loss as to what happened.  It's fine for those of us who were around in 1986 and knew the outcome but what about younger people who never even heard of this disaster.  They would watch the movie and be none the wiser as to the fact it exploded on take off killing all those on board.  Why didn't the producers at least end the movie with a short paragraph describing what happened??  This makes no sense and for that reason I give this movie two stars.

I also found Karen Allen's portrayal of Krista McAuliffe downright irritating as she was smiling constantly.  Even when she was upset or being told something was not right she was smiling from ear to ear.  Her sugary sweet portrayal was just annoying.  I hope Krista was not like this in real life because no one would be able to stand her!!",1350345600,3,1023,4.422459893048129
