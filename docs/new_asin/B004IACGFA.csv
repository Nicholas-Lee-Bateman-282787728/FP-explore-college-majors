8430515,2,B004IACGFA,"This is another slasher/cannibal story that doesn't include co-eds. A ranch in East Texas takes in transients like a roach motel. They stay alive as long as they work and don't become a problem. The story introduces Trevor (Jason Connery) an an Iraq War veteran, with great expectations, but his he-man part left much to be desired. The cannibal family consisted of quite the colorful cast of backwoods characters, complete with the inbred make-up. The story seemed to move slow for a horror story as events appeared uneventful. Available on several multi-packs. Not recommended as a stand alone purchase.

Rape scene. No nudity.",1415923200,,629,5.106796116504855
