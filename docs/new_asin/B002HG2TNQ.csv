8370337,5,B002HG2TNQ,"The DVD, There Goes the Bride, is a charming English comedy. I saw it first on YouTube and watched it several times.  The star, Jessie Matthews, is a remarkable dancer, although she does little dancing in this movie.  Some of her best dancing is in the movie, Evergreen.

I generally don't care for 1930s English comedy, but this is charming.",1503532800,,342,4.666666666666667
8370338,5,B002HG2TNQ,"The Divorce of Lady X literally had Merle Oberon copy Jesse Matthews' lines, face expressions, voice inflection and finally, the musical score, that was from There Goes the Bride.
Jesse Matthews is adorable, over the top, and winsome.
Both are terrific early movies, with the nod to Lady X only due to inclusion of a good co star in Lawrence Olivier.
See both!

These 30's movies are often well made, relied upon acting skills and good dialog, and reflected a time when men knew they were men, women knew they were women, and both liked their assigned genders and celebrated the differences.

You can see how true this is when you read reviews of pre code movies where the modern reviewer loves the movie, but feels he must apologize for ""sexism"" and other non sensible projection of his own beta male status and cultural confusion.

Enjoy the movie for what it is!",1473379200,,865,4.677631578947368
8370339,3,B002HG2TNQ,"Too few songs and dancing in this fluffy unrealistic musical.. The song  "" I`ll Stay With You"" is the better part of the film.",1386115200,,126,4.25
8370340,5,B002HG2TNQ,"Well this is a very old one.  I love to see the fashions, the red lips, shoes, everything.  It's a step back into the past.  I love the music, dancing.  I saw Jessie Mathews in the story of the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, and she still looked marvellous.  Light hearted and a bit of fun.  NO SWEARING!!  I like all her flics.",1383264000,,326,4.079365079365079
8370341,5,B002HG2TNQ,"I first discovered British actress- singer-and (sometimes) dancer Jessie Matthews when I acquired the 1930s film ""First a Girl!"" released a few years ago by VCI. (See separate review). Matthews charmed me with her personality and 1930s sexiness. This made me a big fan and I searched out more DVDs of her films. I soon realized they weren't available. Then , this year, the independent reissue company VCI announced they were issuing eight more Matthews this year. Four were issued in August (including this one) and - while a few are the only known somewhat-worn copies - this one looks great. The images are crisp and clear, and the voices easy to hear. Only the opening musical score sounds distorted - but I can live with that. Once Matthews appears on the screen (and she is in nearly every scene of the 80 minute black and white film) - you just concentrate on her. She's more ""cute"" than gorgeous but sensuous in her own way. She even gets to sing two songs (one while ""playing"" the piano. This is from 1932 and - while it passed the British censors - it still has some softly risqu moments.

You can see my reviews of the other Matthews titles on Amazon (not all are musicals) If you don't know Matthews, I'll suggest you start with this title or ""First a Girl!"". I think you'll then become as big a JM fan as I am.

The VCI DVD also contains a 2  minute collage of photos which plays to a song from the film. There are also easy to read English subtitles, though I don't think you'll have a problem with the accents. (By the way, the film takes place in France but none of the actors makes any attempt at a French accent, which I guess is just as well.)

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
