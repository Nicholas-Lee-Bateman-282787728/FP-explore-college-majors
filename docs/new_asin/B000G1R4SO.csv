Anywho, it is well worth the buy.  At only 41 bucks you can't beat it so might as well get it.",1149897600,3,255,3.9607843137254903
2597822,1,B000G1R4SO,"At least more Superman storylines and traits are being followed in this season than in previous ones. BUT, there is still the continuous and ever dragging on of life drama. Once again, Clark Kent manages to mess up his chances with Lana and is still pretty oblivious to how Chloe and Louis Lane feel about him. At least Clark is performing Superman actions, dismantling a nuke for example. And at least he and Lex aren't friends anymore, and are finally enemies who duke it out in the season finale. With Jonathan Kent finally out of the picture, perhaps now the viewer can hope Clark will turn to his true father Jar-El for guidence and perhaps even TURN INTO SUPERMAN! But, I doubt it. This show is not really about Superman. It is just another teen drama with Superman traits. Its really about a kid with powers and a destiny he just can't deal with, living in a town with a bunch of really disfunctional people. The season started well, with Kryptonians posing a threat to Earth and Clark finding The Fortress Of Solitude. Except he defeats them in a single episode. The show is pretty much a downfall from there, especially when it becomes like THE X-FILES for awhile. The plotline having Lana see a spaceship and having people act like they don't belive her, was A LOT like X-FILES episodes. Not even an appearance by Aquaman could save this year from being so dull. The show finally picks up towards the end of the season with Superman storylines. Lex becomes a higher being and Clark has to save the world from his chaoctic actions. There is at least a twist to how the season ends, but not how it should have. With the newest Superman film coming out this summer, its just stupid that Clark was not turned into Superman this year. But like I said before, everything you've wanted to see; WON'T HAPPEN.",1149897600,5,1810,4.572307692307692
2597823,5,B000G1R4SO,"As soon as season 5 ended, I couldn't wait for the DVD set to be released. ""Smallville"" is the rare show that has only gotten better with time. Season 2 improved upon season 1, season 3 was even better than season 2 and season 4 was when I really became addicted to this show. It wasn't any surprise that season 5 was just as fabulous. It even improves as the season wears on. There were a couple of episodes in the very beginning of the season that felt a little amateurish, namely the one in which Lana turns into a vampire. But the episodes soon grow much more sophisticated, especially after the episode where one of the main characters dies. It does cause the show to go in an entirely different direction after the crazy ride that episode takes us on. The characters and their relationships change dramatically this season, making things all the more interesting and things are poised to be even better in season 6. My final thought on this season, you can never go wrong when you cast James Marsters (better known as Spike on ""Buffy"") to play any part on your show.",1149811200,10,1072,4.474489795918367
2597824,5,B000G1R4SO,"W-O-W is all i have to say about this season. This post contains spoilers so don't read on if you really care.

I am VERY fond of season 3 of Smallville but i must say this season was the BEST season so far

First of all, everybody that is on the Chlark ship will be very happy with this season. Four words, ""WE GOT A KISS!""

Second of all, we lost Mr. Kent, it was a pretty devastating and i cried...i cried like a little baby and when you see the episode you'll cry too, AND Tom cries which unless your heartless will break your heart and make you cry...AGAIN

Third of all, the Clana Ship sinks and goes down in flames :-) yes they break up and yes when she cried..I laughed I'm heartless I know LOL

Fourth of all, Lana dies TWICE!!! *does the happy dance* although the first time was a surgery induced dream and the second time clark or Jor-el turned back time *ruadiaofhgadfhioahfdggggrrrrrrrr* BUT the simple fact that she died will bring a smile to men,women, and children alike. *I love Kristen K. hate Lana there's a difference*

5) Allison Macks performance in ""Tomb"" was absolutly AMAZING my advice is to watch the first episode then skip to episode Tomb it's amazing and i know that's what i'll be doing lol

6) The season finale was AWESOME! and left you satisfied with season five *although when clark just stands there and lets himself be captured knowing full well what that thing could do, it makes you go Wtf?! move! do something!!! lol /rant* and chloe,clark, and ""Lion-el"" better be just fine darn it! and Lois and Martha better be just fine too lol *Prof. Fine you evil awesome genius*, Zod and Lana deserve each other LOL

That's all i'm going to write for now i don't want to give out ALL of season five's secret's for those who haven't watched it yet but these are the major events that made me SMILE BIG there's always of course the professor fine mystery *in which that AOL thing was FREAKING AWESOME!!! along with the Chloe Chronicals thing the smallville writers are SO creative every single season when they add on the ""outside"" extra's they NEVER dissapoint you with their creativity and i hope next season's ""extra"" will be just as awesome!",1149811200,11,2172,4.49492385786802
2597825,5,B000G1R4SO,This Season was awsome you won't belive the last episode Clark changes alot in this one you must see it  before season 6 comes out! i highly recommened it [...].,1149724800,4,161,4.366666666666666
2597826,5,B000G1R4SO,"Well...where do I start? I have been a devoted Smallville fan for about 3 years now and have loved every season, even the weaker episodes in each keep you interested in what will happen in yet another day in the life of 'superboy'. Well, I think the 5th season is the best so far, not only does it show how the rift between Lex and Clark widens but how Clark has matured and actually manages a relationship with the love of his life, Lana, something he thought would never be possible. Also he learns that Chloe knows his secret (about time too - all those hints she gave in season 4 were having me shout at the screen 'Clark, wake up and realise she knows!') Anyway, I thought it was nice for him to be able to share it with someone, as he hasn't since season 2 where he told Pete. However, Pete departed in season 3 and yet again Clark had to rely on his parents, so I think it's a refreshing change for him and Chloe to fight crime together. I also think this season shows how much Tom Welling has grown as an actor, his performance in the 100th episode 'Reckoning' where he loses a loved one, was simply superb and had me in tears. I also love the way the writers are focusing on how Clark and Lex are gradually becoming enemies, as fans are interested in how this happens exactly. Also I loved the episode 'Mortal' where Clark is human and takes advantage of the fact by taking his relationship with Lana to 'that' level, the look on his dad's face the next morning is priceless and had me in stitches, that episode was hilarious. I thought that 'Lexmas' was a fun episode that focuses on Lex's desires for once and I find it interesting that the script writers actually make part of his fantasy come true. Finally, the fact that there is a mysterious new teacher, who we later find out is an enemy of Clark, is refreshing because Professor Fine is on a mission to release the fearful 'Zod'(another fact I like as the writers are refering to the comics more which is interesting) The shocking thing though is who the person is that warns Clark about Fine's plans (it will not be who you think it is - trust me) To sum up it's by far the most surprising and interesting season that focuses on details more than the others and I loved every episode.",1149724800,11,2252,4.326241134751773
2597827,5,B000G1R4SO,"I THink this season is the best one yet, and i can say that because i have been wathcing smallville since day one! everyone should buy this dvd and any other smallville season on dvd this show rocks!!!!",1149724800,3,202,4.342105263157895
2597828,5,B000G1R4SO,"The greatest show on television is back for its fifth season, and in brilliant form at that. Season five is all about the Clark Kent (Tom Welling) we've been waiting to see since the pilot - the one who not only begins to embrace his powers but also learns that he does influence those around him and he needs to start taking responsibility for his actions. The prime example of this thinking is Lex Luthor (Michael Rosenbaum), who starts down the road to becoming the character we're all familiar with after his friendship with Clark is hurt for the last time before our very eyes. Clark and Lex do truly become enemies in this six-disc set, which contains all 22 episodes from the season. After the cliffhanger in the season four finale ""Commencement,"" season five starts off with a bang in the premiere ""Arrival"" with the formation of the Fortress of Solitude (an ice palace essentially that Superman has been using in the comics for years). Not ten minutes later Clark discovers that his best friend Chloe Sullivan (Allison Mack) has been hiding his secret for several months. This reveal instantly propels their friendship up to the next level, showing Clark that there are people in his life other than his father Jonathan (John Schneider) and his mother Martha (Annette O'Toole) that he can truly count on. Throughout the season, Clark experiences what it's like to be a hero without any powers (in the wonderful ""Mortal""), he meets a new teacher at the college who by season's end has become a great foe to Clark (James Marsters), the teachings of Jor-El are brought to Clark by someone who he would have never guessed, the future Man of Steel takes a trip down paranoid lane while on silver kryptonite, Clark after four years of waiting is finally granted the wish of being with Lana Lang (Kristin Kreuk), the life of someone he loves is viciously taken from him, and the arrival of perhaps Clark's most powerful nemesis further complicates Clark's life in the spectacular season finale, ""Vessel.""",1149724800,9,2006,4.800578034682081
2597829,4,B000G1R4SO,"I'm surprised that so many people loved this season. I liked it but I found some things hard to watch. When the ship landed last season I expected a lot more. It's cool that Brainiac is in this season and played by James Marsters (Spike in Buffy and Angel) but he's not used to his full potential. I wish the writers used his character as much as they love using Lana. To me though they've done as much as they possibly can with Lana. Sorry just my opinion. She's hot but how many more episodes do we need where she has a dramatic talk with Clark and leaves the barn walking into the sunset ? Can you say that hasn't happened in any season ? Things even get more dramatic between the two this season.

  They get together and even make love this season but you know that isn't going to last and that only bad can hapeen between the two. I mean by the end of the season she's telling him she doesn't know why she ever loved him. I just hated that and hated her by the end of the season. So I say why does the show have to remind us so often that these two can't be together. Since I love the show I hate the fact that I had so many negative feelings for it this season. With the ship landing the show had all the potential in the world but I think there's way too much drama between Clark and Lana this season. So I hope season 6 just relaxs when it comes to Clark and Lana. The writers love to come up with new ways to use Lana when they have no clue how to even use Lois. At least she's fresh to the show and not as played out as Lana. Plus Chloe is great and now that she knows Clark's secret she's mostly just used to listen to Clark whine and complain about Lana.

  John Schneider really grows on you as Jonathan Kent and when the writers had to choose who will die. They unwisely choose him over the 100% played out Lana. John Schneider at least gets reunited with his Dukes of Hazzard costar Tom Wopat before Jonathan dies of a heart attack in an episode while getting angry at Lionel Luther. Besides the Dukes being reunited I also like the Aruaman episode. Lex has something planned that will harm the ocean and the under water life. That doesn't go well with Arquaman of course. We also get a cool under water fight between Clark and Arquaman since Clark doesn't trust him at first. Plus it's also cool when Lex has Arquaman hostage and won't give him any water as torture. Cyborg from Teen Titans also makes an appearance and that's not a bad episode either. Lex once again shows his bad side by lieing to Clark saying he has nothing to do with the experiments that were done on Cyborg. When infact of course he's in charge of the experiments. Cyborg finds that out but I don't know why he doesn't tell Clark and Lana that. I guess so Lana can go through the rest of the season thinking Lex is great and that she can trust him.

  An episode where Lana injects herself with kryptonite so she can die for a minute or 2 so she can see her dead mother also doesn't turn-out that bad. Eventhough I guess the writers saw Flatliners too many times lol. What makes that episode good is that Clark gets injected with it and gets to see Jonathan one more time. Jonathan warns Clark that Lionel knows his secret. We also get an episode that may remind you of Saw as a Jigsaw type guy takes Lionel hostage and wants him to play a deadly game. That one even turns out better than you'd think since Lionel and Clark have a face to face meeting about Lionel knowing his secret. I think the episodes where Brainiac is scheming against Clark are the better episodes of the season though. Especially the one where he disguises himself as Jonathan to try and get Clark to kill Lionel. Stuff like that makes me hope they cut down Lana's part in season 6 and make Brainiac's bigger. Hell even make him a regular.

  What I don't like is the Lana and Lex relationship that develops after Clark pushes Lana away too many times. I just don't think it works. I always thought Lana was too smart to ever get with Lex or trust him 100%. I just found them sucking each others faces a bad direction for the show to take. Zod being on the show had so much potential and so many fans talking about who would play him. Instead Brainiac puts Zod in Lex's body and he hardly even fights with Clark. The writers love Lana so much that Zod even kisses her while being in Lex's body.  While the Zod in Superman 2 would've just said bow to Zod or why is this woman creature talking to me ?  Plus eventhough Lex knows Clark's secret you just know that since the show loves convenient memory loss that it will happen again here. Probably as soon as Zod is out of his body he'll  not remember anything that happened with Clark. I still like the show but I felt like I was watching a soap opera more than ever with this season especially when it starts the Clark, Lana and Lex love triangle. Next season Clark needs to fly more and just fly out the barn window when he senses Lana walking up the stairs. It would save him and the viewers a lot of time.",1149638400,7,5022,4.205821205821206

2597844,5,B000G1R4SO,"All I can say is wow!!.  This show is epic!!  No other Superman show or movie can compare to the greatness of Smallville.  Infact no other superhero show can compare either.  Tom Welling puts such feeling and emotion into Clark Kent, really bringing him to life.  Smallville has people from the other Superman movies starring in here or guests appearances in the show as well.  Of course DC comics was involved giving insight.  It's pretty epic and well thought out.  Of course there are very important episodes explaining his past and who he is, as well as Clark experiencing life and life choices in other episodes.  Alot of tie in's explaining how and why things came to be when he will one day be superman.  I started renting Smallville via Netflix DVD via the mail.  I was halfway through season 2.  It was just taking too long for the turnaround time from Netflix.  I couldn't wait any longer.  I went and bought all 10 seasons on Amazon HD video at $29.99 each.  I couldn't be any more happy.  Best money I ever spent.  I still continue to watch.  Thank you Tom Welling, cast, and crew for bringing us Smallville.  This show holds a special place in my heart.

Clark takes a turn from asexual hero to pathetically jealous stalker. We finally can no longer avoid that Clark Kent has been totally sexually dysfunctional and totally incapable of love, sex, or even honesty. So as Lex becomes more evil- he becomes more sympathetic. Clark becomes more complex in an awful way.
We tire of his stupid nave selfless LYING and secrecy, of his rubbing Chloe and Lana's faces in his appalling pathetic sexual/emotional impotence.
Flying stunt is no soap, Clarkie boy. News flash: the world saves itself- people save themselves. So get with it and quit trying to destroy Chloe and Lana's lives with your emotional cowardice. Yea, sometimes people get hurt by runaway busses. it happens. Now go tell Lana and Chloe what a lying dishonest tool you've been and try to respond to a human being's real needs for once.

2597891,2,B000G1R4SO,"So many things wrong with this show
From the characters to how it plays out

I excessively hate lana  lang
Clark does everything for her but is a ungratefull brat with mood swings
Sometimes likes him & other hates him

The father has been a demanding jerk i believe

Lex's father completly takes insane to a whole new level back stabbing hes son multible times, sabotaging hes flight
Puts him in a deathbed which has a high chance of killing him and harming others too. The guy is a true monster.

We learn of the caves & omg this is very annoying. Anytime anyone is in the caves, lionel is alerted of a trespasser and hes thier like the flash, as if he has some ultra express tunnel to the caves to as if he owns it and asks them to leave, you know for a busy man he sure has alot of free time on hes hands.

I don't get why supermans real father wants hes son to be a destroyer of worlds. Really stupid nonsense  move for the writers to pull. Hes suppose to be hero. Another thing i hate they added in. Witches. Why were witches thrown into my superman/smallvile show?

Futher more & too much to list:
Nearly every episode cheated fate
Cheating lieing characters doing dumb stuff or acting when they shouldnt be doing
Reading off the script knowing too much when they shouldnt making it all so very fake & annoying to watch
Hate how lana didn't die with the helicopter pilot despite the vehicle being a small bubble. The crash landing should of killed them both but they kept her needing her more & honestly.  i don't agree with that, she over stayed her welcome to the show.

Alot of things that makes no sense at all & never explained. :/

Like come on thats so stupid is my reaction
And no you didnt
So much hated for this show",1451865600,,1732,4.26605504587156
2597892,3,B000G1R4SO,"One episode features the Crimson Avenger, erm, I mean the Angel of Vengeance
Girl audience members may think Arthur Curry (Aquaman, played by x) is a hottie, but bro can't act.
Cyborg can't decide if he wants to tell his girlfriend he's a cyborg.  This is never an issue in the comics, for obvious reasons of obviousness.
One of the main characters dies this season (guess who?)
Now everybody, I want you all to remember this for future reference: Jor-El (or at least the computer simulation of Jor-El that lives in the fortress) is a first-class jerk.
Lex and Lana - okay, I can buy this, they laid enough groundwork to set this up, but
Lionel and Martha?  Icky!  Who the heck thought this was a good idea?  Is this just shock for shock's sake?  (At least it's all one-sided.)
At least Chloe has finally accepted her ""just a friend"" status, and can quit looking all sadly sad at the camera when (something).
At least we get to see Erica Durance in a bikini (in two, count them, two episodes).
Season 5's ""Silliest kryptonite-related episode"" award goes to ""Void"", featuring kryptonite ""Flatliners.""

No creases or frayed edges as if it was preowned. Maybe they're manufacturer fingerprints? They rubbed right off when I used my glasses clothe however.
The inside packaging is different than the first four seasons where where it's hard to take out of the putter paper box and the plastic becomes more breakable and the DVDs overlap. They should've stuck with the packaging for the first four seasons because I can see how this could easily break and ruin the DVDs.

2597923,5,B000G1R4SO,"After four years in high school, the time has come to enter the real world of jobs and college.  And that's not just true in real life but also on the TV show Smallville.  As it entered season 5, the main cast ventured out into the real world.  But the show kept producing great episodes as Clark Kent took another step toward becoming Superman.

Once again, we start the season dealing with the fallout from last season's cliffhangers.  (At least this time there was a bit of a recap before the first episode to give you some idea what was happening).  Clark Kent (Tom Welling) was just discovering his fortress of solitude and still arguing over his fate and purpose here on Earth with his biological father (voiced by recurring guest star Terrence Stamp).  Meanwhile, Smallville is dealing with the aftermath of another meteor shower.

As the season progresses, Clark briefly loses his powers and starts a relationship with long time love Lana Lang (Kristin Kreuk).  Chloe Sullivan (Allison Mack) finally gets a job at the Daily Planet.  Jonathan Kent (John Schneider) takes on Lex Luther (Michael Rosenbaum) for a state senate seat withLois Lane (Erica Durance) as his campaign manager.  And politics makes strange bed fellows as Martha Kent (Annette O'Toole) takes money from Lionel Luthor (John Glover) to help.

Meanwhile, Clark, Lana, and Chloe all start college.  Lana pledges a sorority of vampires, and Clark gets more than he bargained for with his new professor who is hiding an other worldly secret of his own (recurring guest star James Marsters).

Obviously, there was a lot happening this season, and the first half is very strong.  We're introduced to two more members of the DC comics family when Aquaman and Cyborg show up.  The campaign makes an interesting story arc that involves most of the characters for several episodes.  Plus Clark now knows that Chloe knows his secret, which makes their scenes a lot of fun.

I have to give a special shout out to ""Exposed"" which reunites John Schneider with his Dukes of Hazzard co-star Tom Wopat.  Even though I have weak memories of the show from a few episodes I watched in my childhood, I still got several references to that show that made me laugh out loud.

Then comes the 100th episode of the series.  Now don't get me wrong, the episode itself is powerful as it plays out a warning Clark had gotten early in the season - in exchange for something that happened to him, someone close to him would die.  The fall out from that is very well written and acted, and I teared up several times.

However, the episodes soon devolve into a parade of meteor freaks of the week.  When the show does too many of those, it quickly loses my interest because they are so predictable.  A plot thread from early in the season finally comes back into play in the last couple of episodes, and we find out someone else learns Clark's secret, but it's just not up to the level of the earlier episodes of the season.

As I hinted earlier, the acting this season is strong.  Everyone truly gets a chance to shine at some point, and whether it's lighter bits or more dramatic, they always hits the mark.

Likewise, the show is filled with special effects, and they always worked perfectly to help tell the story at hand.  I was never left shaking my head at something that looked fake.

The 22 episodes from the season are all here in widescreen and stereo on six discs.  Extras on the set include lots of deleted scenes, two audio commentaries, the Vengeance Chronicles webisodes, and a look at creating the 100th episode.

Despite a run of several weak episodes in the second half, season 5 of Smallville is still strong enough to give 5 stars.  Just be aware that we get yet another cliffhanger that will make you want to watch the next season right away.",1433203200,,3807,4.651197604790419

2597972,3,B000G1R4SO,"A fairly solid season throughout.

 however I had to knock off a few stars, because..... (warning spoilers below)

 in my opinion the way they set up for Lex and Lana to fall in love with each other were poorly executed. Lex had never been interested in Lana at much, and there was times when I got the impression that he actually found her annoying. Yet, because of some dying dream he had (Lexmas), he suddenly decides that he's in love with Lana?? Everyone knows that Dreams don't always side with reality at all... and had Lex had more time to think and cool off, he would had realized that he simply wanted a family of his own more than he truly wanted Lana herself at all. He even says so  later on.
  Lana on the other hand, follows on though with her predictable pattern of hooking with the next available guy because it's nearly impossible for her to go one day without being in an relationship. It's like she can't stand being single... which is why I find this whole pairing to be so bizarre... especially when they go: ""What do you mean, we've ALWAYS been in love.""

  But, on the plus side it did get us away from the tired storyline of Clark x Lana ""Will they or won't they"" drama, so there's that.

 Then there's Lionel Luthor... the way they set him up to suddenly become the ""good guy"" makes no sense at all. So because he's possessed by the Jor-El A.I program, this somehow redeems him? When the Jor-EI program has consistently shown itself to be evil as hell, what with it wanting Clark to take over the world... it's killed off people, imprisoned and brainwashed people, etc.
  So with all of that evil baggage from the past, it should had only made Lionel Luthor twice as evil and twice as scheming when it possessed him. But wait, the Jor-El AI is suddenly a good guy too!

 Ummm, you see what's wrong with this picture, right??

 That said those two storyline problems aside, the episodes were fairly enjoyable to watch, and the directing on a lot of those episodes were excellent.",1408838400,,2004,4.458791208791209

Added this to my collection of other Smallville seasons. What can one say? You either love it, or you don't. However, being a die-hard Superman mythology fan, I could not go without having as many seasons in my library as possible.

I will be able to revisit all these episodes [ I still watch two a day ] for many years to come.

I was not happy with the ""no tights, no flights"" policy. Everyone wants to see Clark fly, but it is still a great series because of the great ensemble cast of gorgeous, tough women and interesting men.

Now, the producers need to make ""Metropolis"" and continue the saga with the same cast.

Just don't wear out the ""meteor rock"" [kryptonite] story plots.

Fortunately ""Man of Steel"" did not use this in their storyline at all.

Way to go Amazing-zon!!

2597989,5,B000G1R4SO,"I came into Smallville way after the series had ended. I loved Seasons 1-3 but 4 fell a bit flat for me, and I started to wonder if I was losing interest. Season 5 changed that. The plot picked up tremendously and before I knew it, everything had changed. Tension between characters come to a head, future events are hinted at, DC heroes start trickling in, enemies become allies, allies become enemies and so on. Every single character gets some development and we get to watch Tom Welling finally start making the decisions that lead him from teenage alien into the ultimate superhero. This is where the show finally becomes a Superman show. Are there still random episodes? Yes. Fortunately those random episodes are either A. Used for some much needed levity or B. still tied into the plot at large. And while the finale is not the heart-buster Season 2's was, it nevertheless has me extremely excited for the next season. If you're like I was and wondering if the show is still worth it, it most definitely is. Don't miss out",1392422400,,1030,4.633879781420765

Especially since a lot of depressing events occur during this season (e.g. Jonathan Kent dies, there is no tension/drama between Lex and Clark, there was too much focus on ""Brainiac"", the episodes were dull after the 1st episode of this season, etc.). A good season features a long-lasting problem that's resolved towards the end of the season and in the final episode of that season. Season 4, 6, and 7 (and possibly 8, 9, 10) featured just that; a long-lasting problem that's resolved towards the end of the season and in the final episode of that season (i.e. the crystals Clark and Lex look for, Lana and Lex's marriage, etc.).

We also see a stronger, more fatherly side of Jor El who will go out of his way and beyond the confines of the fortress to save his son from death.

Well i have to say this collection of Smallville is pretty much like the last 4 season box sets. There are not that many special features to this season.  If you been following the series then it is one that I say that you have to watch, if you haven't then start with the first season and go from there.  In my opinion is the best season because of the story and the events that occurs in Clark's life.  Now there are six DVD with a total of 22 episodes the plot summed up goes as follows:

:Spoilers:

It starts with Clark deals with the aftermath of the second meteor shower.  Then on to dealing with adult life, going to college, a real relationship with Lana, the loss of someone he loves, and his  distrust for Lex continues to grow which sees the end of the friendship between Clark and Lex.  Then Clark's professor begins to give information about Lex's secret project, they introduced in Arthur Curry, and Victor Stone who are other heroes in the comics, and then Clark find out that his professor is not what he is and pretty much becomes this seasons villain.  Finally it ends with a confrontation with his professor who is now trying to make a vessel for his leader Zod another of Clark's race.

Yeah..I know...she circled Clark's life for a very long time in this series and she and Clark had one of those tragic (though nobody dies) romances that pulls at the heart.  Nonetheless, the dynamic duo of Lois and Clark began emerging even when Lois entered the picture in season 4. Their dislike of each other, coupled with support when the going got tough is what cemented the friendship of Lois and Clark and later their love for each other. In this series...friendship that developed into unwavering trust...though sometimes it should have wavered...led to Lois & Clark's pairing...and boy am i glad it did because they were and are something to watch. Erica Durance is magic in this role as is Tom Welling.  No one could have done it better. It'll be a sad day when this series ends.",1302739200,,856,4.662251655629139

Smallville and the Superman story should remain within its boundaries and not pull from pop culture in so obvious a way as this was done.

Picture and sound quality are top-notch as usual, but I'm completely baffled by why this set would be released with no English subtitles. I never will understand that.

The special features present here are well-done, but only two episodes have commentaries (""Thirst"" and ""Splinter"").

Smallville's historic 100th episode (""Reckoning"") has no commentary, which is extremely disappointing. There is a nice behind-the-scenes featurette about the episode, but I REALLY wanted a commentary with John Schneider and I don't think I'm alone.

The evolution of Clark and Lana's relationship is not always pretty to watch which makes me wonder why there were so many fans of the Lana/Clark hook-up vs Lois/Clark.  The episodes with Lana are darker and the mis-trust drives me crazy. The Lana of this series isn't always the most likeable character which has always made me wonder why they carried on this storyline for so many years.  It is a heart-breaking love story so perhaps that is why the stuck with it for so long.  Plus, it is in sharp contrast to his relationship with Lois which, though at times has issues of trust, is the more mature...but most importantly...much more fun relationship.

After an extraordinarily average fourth season of ""Smallville,"" I had lowered expectations heading into the fifth one.  However, in its fifth year the series finds its ambitious footing and offers a very solid season.

Highlights include the season premiere ""Arrival,"" in which Clark uncovers The Fortress of Solitude and discovers Chloe knows his secret.  Other items of note for season five include James Marsters of TV's ""Buffy The Vampire Slayer"" and ""Angel"" in a recurring role as Professor Milton Fine, alias of ""Superman"" villain Brainiac.  The season also features a very important quasi-political storyline leading up to the series' 100th episode ""Reckoning.""  An important piece of pre-""Superman"" mythology falls into place here, but unfortunately the episode as a whole is average.  The season's Christmas episode ""Lexmas"" fares much better.  A variation on ""It's A Wonderful Life,"" it is another piece in Lex's compelling slide into darkness.

On the whole, ""Smallville"" brings us a durable fifth season with some of the most creative and powerful moments in the run of the series.",1271635200,,1110,5.369942196531792

It's all part of Clark's eventual destiny, though.  Lana finally grows tired of Clark's secretive nature and flakiness and rejects him, which is another element of sadness.  Lex remains my favorite character.  So brilliant, but such a tragic figure with an unhappy childhood, an unloving father, and a dark side that is all too easy for him to give in to.

There is another great cliffhanger at the end of the season, with the dangerous and deadly Zod being released.

Look for James Marsters as Milton Fine, who is actually a villain created on Krypton.",1271462400,,690,4.756302521008403

I also like the inclusion of other DC characters like Aquaman and Cyborg.  I definitely love Lois Lane and Erica Durance's performance keeps getting better.",1270080000,,507,5.197530864197531

2598072,5,B000G1R4SO,"Leading up to this season, Smallville was more ""earthbound,"" in that it really was about a teenager with developing superpowers with only mere glimpses into his true heritage.

Season Five changed the tone of the series forever.

I always viewed this season as the mythology turning point for the series. Huge things happen and we're suddenly thrust from those Twilight Zone-oriented episodes into the DC Comics Universe; things shifted from a ""superboy"" to Superman.

Significant events go down this season, including the emergence of a certain location and the death of a certain loved one. We're also introduced to a couple more characters from DC Comics continuity.

For me, this was the season where the show grew up and strolled down the Superman road with purpose instead of by happenstance. (Those who've seen the show know what I mean.)

The only thing that irked me about this season and going into the next was the whole Clark and Lana thing was getting played out and it seemed the romantic subplot of the show was going in circles instead of officially stating, ""Let's get these guys together for real and keep it that way."" But, as per usual TV show fashion, something always has to happen to drive the couple apart. Though romantic tension is good up to a point, Smallville set the bar high in terms of driving the audience nuts--even to the point of bad-TV frustration--with the Clark and Lana relationship. Sometimes we as viewers just want to see things work out, you know?

Other than that, good times to be had in Season Five of Smallville.

Recommended.

2598073,5,B000G1R4SO,"Smallville Season 5 continues its history of strong storylines and character development.  High School is over and many of the Smallville Crows are flying off to college.  That's not the only change in the air, as Jonathan Kent takes a new roll, Clark makes a decision he is forced to live with, and planet Earth must face the wrath of the Kryptonian known as Zod.

The thing that makes the show enjoyable is its nudge/wink to the audience as bits and pieces of the Superman mythos find its way into the story.  This season's EXPOSED takes the appreciation one step further as John Schneider and former-Dukes of Hazard star Tom Wopat are reunited.  The writers  did a top notch job of working some fun references into the show for fans of the ""good old boys"".

FRAGILE is another excellent episode from the season as Clark cares for a young girl with second generation ""meteor powers"".  Is she behind the death of not only her foster mother, but her birth mother as well ?

Season 5 is not without its questionable moments, however.  The Saw-ripoff, MERCY, walks Lionel Luthor through a series of ""games"".  The would-be killer wears a mask, ala Jigsaw, and presents puzzles with potentially deadly consequences.  Midway through the episode Martha Kent gets caught up in the web.

AQUA and CYBORG keep injecting the ""super"" into the show this season, and the touching LEXMAS gives us something for everyone to enjoy.  All in all, this purchase is a no-brainer for fans of both Superman and Smallville.  But be warned...  the season finale holds a cliffhanger placed by those dastardly villains - the writers !

2598079,3,B000G1R4SO,"Season Review-

I don't know what to say! Of all the seasons of Smallville, I missed the majority of Season 5 during its original airing.  I couldn't wait to watch the episodes I missed as I heard Season 5 was one of the best seasons from many fans.  Buying Season 5 on DVD was pretty much the reason why I bought the first 7 seasons on DVD since it's much more enjoyable watching the series as a whole, seeing show grow with each season.  After I finished watching Season 5, I was shock at how put off I was by this season, as I times, I found it unbearable and watchable.  The season opens up strong with the powerful premiere, ""Arrival"" with Clark building the Fortress of Solitude.  That sequence and the scene of Clark walking into the Fortress where his father welcomes him is a pivotal moment in the history of the series. Not to mention, a black ship landed on Earth to which 2 rebel Kryptonians arrived and begin to wreck havoc on Smallville looking for Clark. The next 2 episodes are also excellent. ""Mortal"" is a great look at how Clark is mor heroic without his powers once again and ""Hidden"" is one of the most suspenseful episodes of the series yet.  But from there, the season loses all momentum and derails in storylines and developments that are on the verge of being abysmal.  Clark and Lana make a second attempt at having a relationship, while it starts off pleasant enough; you realize that the Clana relationship is more melodramatic angst, less star crossed lovers like originally thought.  At one point, you just get sick of Lana demanding the truth from Clark and Clark whining about losing Lana.  It doesn't make for gripping drama; it makes for an annoying bad soap opera.  To makes matters worse, the end of the season saw the beginning of the Lexana relationship, which is hilarious.  At the beginning of the season, Lana almost hated Lex then suddenly after breaking up with Clark, she runs to Lex for comfort...I'm sorry...what! The beginning of their relationship is poorly written and forced with Michael and Kristin seeming obviously awkward during those scenes. The majority of episodes are some of the worst of the series: ""Aqua"" is a sub-par adaption of DC comics' Aquaman, ""Thrist"" is right up there with ""Spell"" as the nominees for worst episode of the series, ""Exposed"" is a lackluster mystery centered around a dead stripper, ""Tomb"" is a bland ghost story despite Allison Mack's stunning performance, ""Hypnotic"" is almost unwatchable, ""Void"" and ""Mercy"" are more blatant movie rip-offs, ""Fragile"" is a mediocre directorial debut for Tom Welling and ""Fade"" even sees the writers reusing old meteor freak plots.

But to be fair, Season 5 has its great moments, no matter how few they were.  James Masters of ""Buffy"" fame makes his debut on the series as Milton Fine, one of Clark's college professors.  There is more to Fine than Clark realizes as he is none other than another one of his greatest archenemies, Brainiac.  Masters just oozes menace and evil, portraying the character with class. The Brainiac storyline was one of Smallville's most exciting yet but like Season 4, the writers treated the storyline poorly by either forgetting the storyline for a majority of the season or simply leaving it as a small sub-plot for several episodes.  It's another bad move by the writers as they waste another perfectly good storyline. Anyway, Allison Mack gets a hell of a lot more to do as Chloe when Clark finds out that she knows the truth about him. Becoming the future Superman's official new sidekick was exciting as Chloe continued to develop nicely and the interaction between both characters has never been fresher. The friendship between Clark and Lex seems to be over for the most part, I liked seeing the new dynamic between both men. It may not be hate yet, but they obviously don't trust each other as the lies between them go bigger.  Now without Clark's friendship, Lex grows cruel, power hungry, even closer to the evil tyrant he will become.  The Senate race storyline was an excellent way of showing Lex's darker side as he runs for Senator for Kansas against Jonathan Kent.  ""Lexmas"" is not just a fun holiday episode, but a surreal journey for Lex provided by his mother's spirit by showing her son a possible better life of her son.  Jonathan Kent grows as well when he struggles to win the race for Kansas' state senator.  It's the perfect storyline for Jonathan and sadly his last.  In the series 100th episode, ""Reckoning"" is probably the saddest episode of series when a shocking event that impacts the characters leaves Clark messing with the fabric of time but his father's death being the final outcome.  It's a heartbreaking farewell for John Schneider whose Jonathan Kent was the strongest portrayal of the character yet. Other great episodes are the double Brainiac arc episodes, ""Splinter"" and ""Solitude"", Victor Stone aka Cyborg of the Teen Titans drops by in ""Cyborg"", ""Vengeance"" features the saddest scene in Smallville history, and despite the plot holes left from underwriting the Brainiac arc, ""Oracle"" and the apocalyptic finale, ""Vessel"" end the season quite well.  The arrival of Zod development in Brianiac's plan was exciting as well as the moment Zod arrives in Lex's body as his vessel.  With Zod free, the whole world in chaos with a kryptonian virus unleashed and Clark slowly floating away into the Phantom Zone, the season left a lot to look forward to as Smallville season finales tend to do.

After starting with so much promise, Season 5 quickly becomes what I think to be Smallville's worst season to date.  While there are some memorable moments and episodes, not to mention Tom Welling showcases some of his best acting work with ""Splinter"", ""Reckoning"" and ""Vengeance"". Still, the majority of the individual episode just brought this season down. Certain characters were misused (Lois Lane surprisingly!), some relationships made no sense (Lexana once again) and the series as a whole continued to forget what the series was all about.  It's kinda funny how Alfred Gough and Miles Millar declared in the Season 5 overview that this season was ""Superman in Training"" when there was very little training involved! There was so much potential, but there's very little outcome here.

Season Rating: 3.5/10

Video and Audio Review-

Probably the best the series ever looked; it's not just the stunning widescreen that makes all 22 Season 5 episodes look better, but it's the spectacular special effects which seemed to have peaked this season.  The sounded has never been better.

Video and Audio Rating: 9/10

Extras-
The commentaries continue to be some of the most hilarious part of the extras. There's commentary on ""Thrist"" where the writers have fun bashing themselves on how this dreaded episode could have come to be. Another commentary for ""Splinter"" is straight forward. Smallville's 100th Episode: The Making of a Milestone is a great documentary showing the whole cast and crew working on the 100th episode. The Vengeance Chronicles are mini-episodes that see Chloe getting deeper into the life of the masked vigilante, the Angel of Vengeance.  They are entertaining but filler extras. The deleted scenes are a mixed bag as usual.

2598093,5,B000G1R4SO,"Inasmuch as season four ended with the graduation of Clark and friends from Smallville High, it was logical that the story lines in this fifth season would have the principals involved in situations that were much more problematic and adult in nature. Because of the ongoing ""growth"" of Clark (the much improved, actingwise, star Tom Welling) into the future Man of Steel, this season presents obstacles that confront him as a freshman college student, as one involved in a sensitive relationship with girlfriend Lana (the beautiful Kristen Kreuk), and as an alien tied to his past by the disembodied voice of his real father, Jor-El (the voice of Terrence Stamp). Add to this the strained friendship with Lex Luthor (the brilliant Michael Rosenbaum), the reappearance of the sinister Milton Fine (the equally brilliant James Marsters), and the occasional meteor freak, and you have a top-caliber science fiction drama.

Besides the superb performances of the aforementioned actors, season five allows the remaining stars (Allison Mack, John Glover, and Annette O'Toole) the chance to really shine throughout the year's installments.

Most significantly, John Schneider gets an episode that becomes one of the pivotal moments in the show's run.

Erica Durance really comes to fruition in her role as the always-ready-with-a-quick-retort Lois Lane.

The season is filled with rebirths, deaths, resurrections, and lots of deceit, the latter the result of everyone, at one time or another, keeping a secret from another.

Because of the dark turn of the series, there are some images that might warrant parental guidance in regards allow younger family members to view them. A couple of characters are impaled, one is incinerated, there are several deaths by gunshot, and fiery explosions and car crashes occur more than once. Such scenes might be unnerving to younger viewers.

Also, two installments have implied sex scenes that are a tad too suggestive for the small fry.

The extras on the disc include an informative making of the 100th episode and a ""mini-series,"" of sorts, that deals with a character introduced in the ""Vengeance"" installment.

Like the title reads, I don't know why Warner Bros. began Smallville on HD-DVD and Blu Ray at Season Five instead of Season One but anyway this was a good season to review because this fifth season like a lot of other genre series that hit their fifth year (i.e. Angel and Charmed etc.) changed the dynamic of the series in a way that the series could almost never go back to things were before.  As Special Features go this season doesn't have much for hardcore Smallville viewers.  Deleted scenes on every disc and a couple commentaries and the making of the 100th episode (which is one of the best of the series).  My favorite episode of this season is probably the episode Lexmas where the creators of Smallville do an obvious homage to It's A Wonderful Life but in a new way showing it from a villian's prospective.  And really humanizing the character of Lex Luthor as a confused, angry, lost kid who really doesn't know what he wants other then to not lose anything in his life in particular the main woman in his life.  This season also marks three high points for long time Superman fans like myself.  One the final dissolvement of the Lex Luthor Clark Kent Friendship.  We all knew this was going to happen ever since the first program in 2001 and I think the showdown between the two in the episode The Vessel really summaries everything the two wanted to say to each other and never had the courage to say to each other.  The second high point is the introduction of General Zod and Brainaic.  With the exception of Lex Luthor, Clark and Superman's main adversaries.  When I heard the name ""Zod"" utter on the series I thought this was going to be a special season and with James Marsters playing Brainaic I thought that was a genius move and how these two characters really effected Clark's life will move onto the next season.  Lastly, the lost of Johnathan Kent was another fans were expecting for quite a while.  There is a discussion between fans whether Johnathan's death was caused by Jor-El's powers or by the fact that Johnathan's heart just gave out.  I think it was a little of both.  It had been established since Season Three when Johnathan took a dose of Clark's powers that his heart had been weakened ever since and this was the accumlination of that problem.  Finally there is reason I am not going to talk about the Clana relationship because I don't think it is important to everything else going on this season.  I will discuss it in my season six review of Smallville but this season it felt tacked on.",1195084800,,2698,4.495901639344262
2598098,5,B000G1R4SO,"This is really a sad season, but that's why it is so cool: the chapters don't end like fairy tails with the ""live hapily ever after"" cliche. All the characters have to take tough decisions and sometimes they choose the wrong ones, like real life.
The complexity of the characters is really improved in this season and one can perceive their internal struggles.

2598100,5,B000G1R4SO,"Probably the biggest failing of the Superman movies so far has been its superficial treatment of the villians.  They are all evil, and their wickedness is taken at face value without any inspiration or history.  This is where this series comes in and really fills a niche.  Lex Luthor is wealthy beyond measure, and his deeds are not inspired primarily by greed, as in the Christopher Reeve / Gene Hackman movies.  Instead, he is fueled by curiousity, loneliness, and a desire for others to trust him.  First, he is curious about the effects the meteor showers have had on Smallville, yet whenever he digs, Clark Kent is there covering something up.  Second, he is lonely.  Whether by his bald head, his wealthy status or the upbringing by his father, his most stable companions are books and the wisdom they impart to him.  Last, he needs others.  Of all the characters in the series, he reaches out to others more than anyone else, and gets rejected most often.  All three of this trends come together in Season Five to create the man that will become a monster.  Finally, a TV show that explores the villians as much as it explores the heroes.  For that, this is a great show to watch.",1191715200,,1188,4.604761904761904

2598105,4,B000G1R4SO,"Great season, though the end was not as grand as 5. Thre are so many things to love about this series: masterful use of saturated color (lending a comic book authenticity), witty scripting (moving beyond its original written form), and acting that is exact. The story telling in the Smallville series is some of the best out there and gets better with season 6: The Justice League, Chloey's powers, the Martian Manhunter, guest appearances like Lynda Carter...etc.

I'm dinging this one for poor video transfer quality. The season 5 regular DVD disc set is comparable in quality. It is actually less grainy though not as resolute in some scenes. I'm not an expert but the look of the season 6 video looks to be of a low bit rate and grainy. OK, grainy can be explained by the dark scenes where maybe they needed more exposure latitude, but the overall poor quality appears as though the season was produced exclusively for cable TV distibution which would require a low bitrate to save file size/bandwidth, then that hack job was slapped on an HD-DVD disc. The Blu-Ray version is worse IMO, so lets not make this an HD-DVD limitation issue.

Still worth buying of course, as it is worth twice the price I paid in entertainment... Lets hope they do a better job next time on the transfer and do justice to this American classic.",1191542400,,1327,4.666666666666667
2598106,5,B000G1R4SO,"I've been a comics fan since the 1950's. Comics literally helped me learn to read. The first super hero comics I read were about Superman, Batman, etc.

I wasn't able to watch the Smallville series originally because I didn't have cable tv. I live in a small town in Maine, and the signal from the ""broadcast"" channel was too weak to watch.

A few months ago I came into some money, and gleefully ordered this set. I just loved it. I loved it so much that I just ordered Season 6 as well.

Now I'm experiencing the Joy of Comics, after a 20-year ""vacation.""

Oh, yes, and I plan to order Spiderman 3, in case you're interested.",1189728000,,665,4.418032786885246
2598107,5,B000G1R4SO,"Season five of the WB's (now the CW) Superman as a teenager drama, Smallville produced a landmark episode, introduced a few new superheroes that show up in Superman's future and also saw the death of one of the show's most-loved characters.

Early in the fifth season, the show reached its 100th episode, quite an accomplishment in and of itself, and that episode, ""Reckoning,"" was when the powers that be decided that a major character was going to die, and while most people could read the writing on the wall as to who that character would be, the show did tease a little bit, leading viewers to think it may be somebody other than Clark's father, Jonathan, but in the end, the newly-elected Senator Kent was stricken moments after fighting with Lionel Luthor, surrounded by his wife and son.

Smallville explores the youth of future Superman Clark Kent (Tom Welling) as he learns to deal with his powers and how to use them to help others. This season was the first season that the main character and his friends were no longer in high school, so the show shifted a little bit, with a lot of action taking place in nearby Metropolis.

As Clark struggles with his secret, another person becomes a keeper of that secret. Clark's friend Chloe (Allison Mack) learned of the secret late in season four, but she gets closer to Clark in the fifth season as he realizes she knows and finds himself becoming more and more comfortable around her. Clark's relationship with the love of his teenage life, Lana Lang (Kristin Kreuk) is another story, as he struggles keeping his secret from her. He finally tells her and in the 100th episode, Lana is killed while being chased by Lex (Michael Rosenbaum), forcing Clark to request a favor of his biological father Jor-El. Clark gets to live the day over, doesn't tell Lana his secret and saves her, eventually leading to the death of Jonathan Kent (John Schneider).

Lana turns to Lex for comfort and finds much more than that, as the two begin a relationship that is certainly doomed from the start, but one that infuriates Clark as he truly believes the horrible things that Lex is capable of and doesn't want Lana to be part of them. Lana's romance with Lex also stems from a mutual interest in a space ship that crashed in the finale of season four and which Lex secures in the start of this season.

At the start of the season, Clark and Chloe both end up in the ""Fortress of Solitude,"" where Clark accidently releases Krypontians from the Phantom Zone. One Kryptonian who comes to play a big part in the season is Milton Fine (guest star James Marsters), who also will be known as Brainiac. He is a professor at Central Kansas A and M, where Clark is a student, but his Kryptonian heritage is discovered as he tries to convince Clark that Jor-El was evil. The two do battle, with Clark coming out on top in the first round, but Fine seemingly getting revenge in the finale.

Chloe takes her journalism to Metropolis University, where she rooms with Lana. Chloe also gets a job at the Daily Planet, where she uses all the resources available to her to help Clark fight against the evil of the world. She also spends a good deal of time with her cousin, Lois Lane (Erica Durance), who showed up in the previous season as a regular hinderance in Clark's life. Lois also gets the chance to serve as campaign manager for Jonathan's senate run against Lex and eventually as Martha Kent's (Annette O'Toole) chief of staff when she takes her  husband's seat.

Lionel Luthor (John Glover) also discovers Clark's secrets and uses them to his advantage with the Kents, eventually leading to the heart attack that kills Jonathan. He also finances Jonathan's senate run against his son, knowing that the power that Lex is seeking will only make him hungry for more and he believes that is not good for anybody. Lionel also seems very interested in Martha Kent as the season winds down.

The landmark episode was certainly the 100th, which featured the death of Jonathan and the break-up of Clark and Lana. In addition, the season also features the introduction of Aquaman and Cyborg, friends who will come back to help Clark in the future. The highlight of the season for me, anyway, was the episode that featured John Schneider's former Dukes of Hazzard co-star Tom Wopat at Senator Jack Jennings. The two really play up the whole Hazzard connection, right down to a 1969 Dodge Charger with a stuck passenger side door. I really got a kick out of that episode and was glad the two got to work together before Schneider's character died.

This set also featured two commentary tracks, deleted scenes and a great behind-the-scenes look at the making of the landmark 100th episode, all solid extras on another solid set.

All told, the fifth season of Smallville's only weakness may indeed be Kryptonite.",1189296000,,4834,4.688679245283019
2598108,5,B000G1R4SO,"A lot of stuff happens this season that makes this worth buying; Aquaman, silver Kryptonite, Braniac and the death of a family member are just a few things that happen this season. Season five is definitely one of the most exciting seasons and one of the most interesting since a lot of it takes place in Metropolis.

2598109,5,B000G1R4SO,"I've always thought that television shows should be fun.  I don't care what sense of morality and thought-provoking situations you want to put in; the show has an obligation to entertain.  Smallville's Season 5 does not fail.

The season begins with the aftermath of the second meteor shower and a choice for Clark that has dire consequences he cannot see or [mostly] fix.  It's a new world for Kent and Co. as they move from high school into the world of adults; their adulthood is something the show and its themes will not let you forget!  It's complex, it's exciting, and it's moving.  Every moment of this season is a blast.

And this is because it's rare to see a show that can put solemnity and camp into the same season and make it work.  We have death, we have heartache, and we have some episodes that are so playful and silly they just make you laugh.  But remember--even this more campy episodes concerning vampire sororities and holiday specials serve their purpose in furthering the plot.  A useful way to have fun.

Even the characters seem more comfortable in their respective niches even as they go under remarkable changes.

Great writing and a great way to move our characters onto their destinies!  The first season of this show to which I have given 5 stars.

Oh, and check out the documentary on Superman.  Wonderful.",1188345600,,1339,4.662393162393163
2598110,5,B000G1R4SO,"If you have an HD DVD player, and you are a Smallville fan, season 5 is definitely worth purchasing in HD. The detail and color is amazing and the popup menu is really a great feature. I already have Season 6 on pre-order in HD!",1188259200,,228,4.088888888888889
2598111,3,B000G1R4SO,"I'm not going to get into the plot/stories/arcs of Season 5 here, other than to say that as a huge fan of the show, in my opinion this is probably the weakest overall season in the series (it still has its share of good-to-great episodes of course, just not as many as other seasons). For Arrival (the first episode), you can watch a cool ""picture in picture"" commentary about the special effects of the episode, something unique to the HD-DVD. However, Arrival seems to be one of the poorest transfers on the set unfortunately, and I can't help but wonder if it has something to do with this ""add on"" attached to this episode, whether it's activated or not.

Issues with this HD-DVD set:

1. NO MAIN MENU. After the disc loads and you get past the usual screens (FBI warning, HD-DVD promos, etc) of whatever disc you put in, the first episode on it simply starts playing. There is NO main menu...a huge disappoint. If you're like me, you enjoy seeing the intros with its season-specific animations like DVD versions have. Why not include it? You can access a menu pop-up screen while an episode is playing or paused to get to options, other episodes, special features etc, which is a cool feature of HD-DVD, but without a cool main menu it doesn't really mean much, and you feel a bit cheated because you know that people with the DVD version have one. It couldn't have been that difficult to include the main menu, I have other HD-DVDs that do both -- the main menu AND the pop-up menu while the movie/show is playing (which is supposed to be a convenient feature because you don't have to leave the show). Most people like having the main menu and it's art/animation as an intro to the season/show, that's common sense so I'm not sure what the makers of this set were thinking. I feel pretty cheated not having it.

2. PICTURE QUALITY. While good, it is not as great a leap over Smallville DVD quality as I was expecting. As a reviewer below mentioned, it seems the earlier eps weren't transferred very well. There seemed to be minor grain noticeable sometimes, particularly in darker scenes. The bright scenes for the most part look fantastic. So again it is the darker scenes that seem to be the most problematic throughout the season (I've seen the first 8 eps so far). Since this is a 5 disc set, some discs (3 of the 5) have 5 eps on them instead of the usual 4 that we're used to with DVDs. I can't help but wonder if unneeded compression took place to fit 5 HD-sized eps on one disc and that any quality issues experienced on these discs are a result of this compression. Don't get me wrong, the picture is better than DVD, but it's not that much better, meaning either one of two things: Either they didn't do the best possible job with these HD transfers or they simply do an amazing job with their DVD transfers, compression and all.

3. LESS BOX ART. Not really major, however I'm sure important to many, including myself. If you're like me, part of the fun of collecting DVDs, especially TV DVDs, is having the box and its box art to look at. But with HD-DVD, the box is much smaller, and the inside is completely devoid of any art. DVD box sets have a lot more art. So while you gain in less space the box takes up, you lose out in something that makes collecting more fun -- the nifty artwork.

I truly hope the Season 6 HD release in an improvement over this one. Please, give us an animated main menu, and don't compress anything if you don't have to. Space out the eps on 6 discs instead of 5, I'm sure most people would prefer a better picture over saving a tiny bit of space (and it truly is tiny). I'm not sure what they can do about not sacrificing artwork, but I hope they try to figure something out -- because ultimately, why should people who are paying more for something (the HD version instead of DVD) be getting less.

****I recently purchased HEROES SEASON 1 on HD-DVD, and it is simply an amazing set. I would suggest Smallville follow their lead on how to produce a quality HD-DVD set. Lots of artwork, a complete main menu, basically all the bells and whistles you could ask for.",1188172800,3,4115,4.422163588390501

This show looks amazing, and it looks even better on DVD.  The video rivals film quality.  It IS film quality.  Presented gloriously in 1:78:1 ratio, you'll think you're watching a 45 min. film.

The extras are defintely worthwhile.  Two commentaries that are very insigtful and the feauturettes are very pleasing to watch.  The Making of the 100th Episode is very wonderful and definitely worth it.

I grew up reading Superman and even at age 60 am still hooked on the mythical character.  The Smallville series is a unique view of the Superboy character who, in fact, is nowhere to be seen in the series.  The best shows are about Kal-El and how he seeks his destiny or how he deals with his human-Kryptonian duality.  Frankly, about half the shows are completely forgettable and even accepting the physically impossible nature of the main character, other aspects are more unbelievable.  For example, did you ever ask yourself how all those twenty-four-year-old teenagers can get 24/7 access to the high school?  Ever wonder why it is that Lana Lang, who had more concussions than Troy Aikmen not to mention countless near death experiences, possessions, and strange illnesses, is not institutionalized for mental instability?  And Lois (delicious to look at), barely twenty, somehow runs a successful state senate campaign with the skill of James Carville?  Or why it is these high school/college kids speak with the linguistic skill and knowledge of forty-year-old college professors?  Or how Chloe can hack into any computer on the planet within seconds?  Please.  And there are just too many meteor-rock monsters in Smallville for anyone to continue living there.  Nonetheless, I'll keep watching when season six begins on HDNET.

It seemed like ""Smallville"" couldn't get much worse than its frankly absurd fourth season, but it nearly did during the subsequent season.  Season Five of ""Smallville"" is the season of change, throwing out one life-altering development after another, sometimes gracefully, sometimes not so much.  Unfortunately, though the fifth season clearly aspires for greatness, only on select occasions does it actually reach it.  During the first four or so episodes it appears as though the show may have actually reached the level of greatness it held during its first few seasons, but immediately thereafter it becomes clear that though the season arc has improved, the overall quality of the show is still barely mediocre.  At times, this season nearly falls to the rank of television trash.  As a major ""Smallville"" fan, I felt almost as devastated through this season as I did during the fourth season.  However, there were a few saving graces that convinced me to hold on to my fleeting hope that someday, this show may be as good as it once was.

First off, as a major ""Buffy"" fan, the thing I was anticipating the most in this season was the numerous guest appearances of James Marsters as professor Milton Fine - better known to Superman fans as Braniac, the evil, brilliant android who survived Krypton's destruction.  Marsters doesn't disappoint.  He makes Braniac a delectably devious and intriguing villain.  The best part of this season is that it draws heavily from the Superman mythos, foreshadowing things to come while introducing major characters like the aforementioned android, giving Clark the Fortress of Solitude (a tasty development indeed), and pushing Lana Lang toward her destiny away from Clark Kent.

There are a number of episodes ranking among the show's best.  In traditional ""Smallville"" fashion, the bombastic premiere picks up precisely where the last season's finale left off.  In fact, ""Arrival"" may be the series' best premiere yet.  ""Mortal"", in which Clark is left without his powers (again), is a surprisingly fun episode, showcasing a light-hearted wit that disappears instantly in the next episode.  ""Aqua"", though not a particularly great episode, introduces the character of Arthur Curry (Alan Ritchson), a.k.a. Aquaman.  (""Aqua"" wound up as the WB's highest-rated Thursday night episode ever, spawning a spin-off, which was not picked up.)  ""Exposed"" is a blast, reuniting John Schneider with his ""Dukes of Hazzard"" co-star Tom Wopat.

Then there's the 100th episode, ""Reckoning"", an utterly epic episode that throws one shocker after another to us, including the death of a major character (sorely missed in the sixth season, but a wise move on the writers' parts, one of the few times ""Smallville"" has actually followed the comics continuity).  ""Cyborg"" introduces the titular DC comics character.  Finally, the season closes with the super finale, ""Vessel"", an especially grandiose, bleak, and cool episode introducing a fan favorite villain who happens to have a strong liking of those who kneel before him.

Those are the pros.  Unfortunately, the cons are far more numerous.  For one thing, the acting is for the most part stale.  None of the actors try anything new.  Even previously sensational actors like John Glover and Michael Rosenbaum have become bland by the season's end.  Maybe the writing is to fault for this.  The writing isn't just ridiculous: it's downright stupid.  The dialog is particularly awful - overblown, overdramatic, and without any of the realism or wit that makes the dialog in shows like ""Gilmore Girls"" and ""Buffy"" so compelling.  The directing, for the most part, is astoundingly uninspired and amateurish, and the music is simplistic and silly.

Then there's the season's share of foul episodes.  That includes trash like ""Thirst"", arguably the worst episode in the show's history, in which Lana joins a vampire sorority and becomes one herself.  (That episode is worth watching, however, if only to see ex-undead James Marsters' deadpan delivery of the line ""There's no such thing as vampires, Clark."")  ""Mercy"" is an unbelievably absurd episode, a plain-to-see ""Saw"" ripoff, in which Lionel Luthor is taken captive by a man in a painted mask with a husky voice who, through televised messages, informs Lionel that he has ""a game to play"".

My final beef is that the writers in this season seemed unclear as to an episode's typical structure.  When the climax has occured twelve minutes before an episode's end, you know you're in trouble.  Thus the episodes drag on and on to the point where they occasionally seem preachy.  What became of the concise, fresh writing of the first, second, or third seasons?

I expected greatness from Season Five of ""Smallville"", so I suppose it's my own fault that I was so disappointed.  However, there is no excuse for a show that began so wonderfully to fail so badly when it's clear how to fix the series' many mistakes.  This season is still an improvement over Season Four, and has spots of near-greatness, but ultimately, it's a failure.  The next season, however, more than makes up for it.",1174953600,6,5138,5.111510791366906

I recommend this TV Show to everyone who likes Superman, Special Effects and good , intense television.",1173312000,,400,4.782608695652174
2598161,5,B000G1R4SO,"I spent a couple of weeks watching the first five seasons of ""Smallville,"" and on balance I go along with those who think the Fifth Season is the best of the bunch.  ""Reckoning,"" the 100th episode, stands out because of the significant deaths that take place, but the whole first half of the season is overshadowed by Jor-el's promise that the price of restoring his son's powers will be the life of someone Clark loves (""Hidden""), so there is a setup to the big payoff.  What I think makes a big difference to the show is that Clark discovers that Chloe knows his secret (""Arrival""), because now our hero finally has somebody who knows his secret and can be a big help to him.  When Pete Ross knew Clark's secret it was just a series of problems every other week, but the dynamic is decidedly different and better with Chloe and even before the tragic events of this season you can see that it is Chloe, rather than Jonathan or Martha (or even Jor-el), who has become the person Clark turns to.  Ironically, even though there will never be a romantic relationship between Clark and Chloe, I can make a pretty good case that it is Chloe who has the same function on ""Smallville"" that Lana Lang had in the ""Superboy"" comic books, as the girl who knows the big secret, while still foreshadowing the importance of her cousin, Lois Lane, down the road at the ""Daily Planet."".

Clark and Lana have some of their best moments before things completely deteriorate. Obviously you want to point to several unforgettable moments in ""Reckoning"" as evidence of that, but there are some equally strong moments in ""Hidden,"" aided at the end by the marvelous use of Dishwalla's ""Collide.""  I know we figured this out several seasons back, but I think it should be commented that for such pretty faces Tom Welling and Kristen Kreuk turned out to be pretty good actors.  Having James Marsters around as Milton Fine is fun because he not only gets between Clark and Lex but Lex and Lionel as well.  Obviously ""Reckoning"" is the biggie in the fifth season, but I think almost as highly of ""Lexmas,"" which marks the point where Lex irrevocably turns to the dark side.  I have long thought that the biggest legacy of ""Smallville"" to the Superman mythos is with regards to the character of Lex Luthor.  Even without the costume during his ""Superboy"" phase, Clark Kent is still the boy being brought up in the heartland to believe in truth, justice, and the American way.  But the idea that Clark and Lex were once as close as brothers makes ""Smallville"" not only the story of how Clark Kent became Superman but also turns Lex Luthor into a tragic figure and makes it worthwhile for Michael Rosenbaum to shave his head half of the year (showing seeing his future self wearing a glove was a nice foreshadowing of how a kryptonite ring will cost him his hand).

In retrospect I was surprised that there were not more than an episode and a half to make up the period when Clark is without his powers (""Mortal""), and the idea of Lex Luther and Jonathan Kent running against each other to be a state senator does not strike me as the right move for either of them (Lex would not start with anything lower than the U.S. senate in the Herb Kohl/Jay Rockerfeller/Mark Dayton mold).  The DC universe expands a bit more in season five, adding the future Aquaman (""Aqua"") and Cyborg (""Cyborg"") into the mix.  With Chloe working at the ""Daily Planet,"" it becomes clear Metropolis is closer than ever, which for me is the ""Smallville"" equivalent of warp drive on ""Star Trek"", to wit, a narrative tool that allows stories to be told even though in ""reality"" the small town and the big city are a half a country apart.  But this is what happens once the ""Smallville"" gang graduates from high school, and like on ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer,"" going to college has proven to only get in the way of the larger story being told.  I also find it interesting that the role of Lionel Luthor in the series is growing while the writers reduce the importance of Martha Kent by suddenly giving her a career.

However, I still maintain that introducing Lois Lane into ""Smallville"" was a big mistake, and nothing in the fifth season gives me any reason to chance by mind.  A chance meeting, such as Clark had with Perry White, is one thing, but integrating Lois during the Lana years is a monumental change in the mythos.  Of course ""today"" Lois Lane and Clark Kent are married in the Superman comics, but beyond the original key dynamic that Clark loses Lois but Lois love Superman what was important about them in the beginning was that she was the established big city reporter and he was the new rube on the block.  Even if we never get to that point (I assume the series ends when he puts on the suit, but then I also think that either Lana or Chloe are going to be dead before that ever happens), ""Smallville"" has changed that part of the story and not for the better.  Still, given that I have not liked the depictions of Lois from Margot Kidder to Terri Hatcher that have made her a bit ditzy for comic reasons, Erica Durance does combine confidence and competence in equal measure.  Then again, episodes like ""Exposed"" give Clark ammunition for their battles down the road.

The main attraction in the Special Features is the featurette on ""Smallville's 100th Episode: The Making of a Milestone,"" which could have spent a bit more time in the writer's room showing how they came up with the story, and there are also excerpts from the documentary: ""Look, Up in the Sky! The Amazing Story of Superman.""  Then there is another series of Chloe's webisodes, this time entitled the ""Vengeance Chronicles,"" and a decent dose of unaired scenes scattered throughout the six discs.  There are only two commentary tracts.  Stephen S. DeKnight, James Marshall, and James Marsters have the honors for ""Splinter,' and then for ""Thirst,"" writer DeKnight and several producers show up to make amends for what they consider to be the one episode from Season 5 that they think was a big mistake.  It really is the comic tone rather than the subject matter that makes ""Thirst"" stand out like a sore thumb, because it is a bit over the top (compare it with the fun stuff in ""Exposed"" that reunites John Schenider with ""Dukes of Hazzard"" costar Tom Wopat, which works great).",1173139200,,6311,4.601604278074866
2598162,5,B000G1R4SO,The Smallville series continues to get better and better in terms of acting and cinematic prowess/appeal in the fifth installment.  My only complaint is: the show seems to constant be moving toward more and more racy seens in with respect to adult situations.  It's kind of lost it's innocence.  As a whole I think it's okay for families to watch if adults are in the room.  I wouldn't leave younger children alone with it though.  Too bad.,1172016000,2,440,4.662337662337662

2598176,2,B000G1R4SO,"Just because Superman has superhearing does not mean that every human does, but I guess Superman (or its human creators) don't care about that.  There are no English subtitles or English closed captioning on this set even though all previous seasons 1 - 4 did.  The HD-DVD does have English subtitles, but the end user is charged over $10.00 more this ""feature"".  In other words, the company did the work to create the closed captioning (which is required by federal law for public broadcasting), but where too cheap to include it on this DVD set.  The company also went cheap on the box.  Two DVDs are placed on top of each other which makes it difficult to get them out without scratching them.  Superman is supposed to be a hero againt big companies doing evil things, but this philosphy only applies to the fictional world of Smallville -- not the real world that we live in.  Superman now represents the philosphy of ""Do as I say, not as a do.""  What a mixed message we are giving to the next generation.",1171152000,2,1009,4.535911602209945
2598177,3,B000G1R4SO,"My children persuaded me to acquire this series (Smallville Series 5) on DVD and so we sat down to be serially entertained.  First, the good news: Michael Rosenbaum, who plays Lex Luthor, the antagonist to the protagonist hero Clark Kent/Kal-El/Superman, can act.  Rosenbaum's abilities as an actor enable Lex to become the most interesting and compelling character in what is otherwise a sea of standard-for-TV mediocrity.  The other piece of good news is that the direction of some episodes is first-rate.  An example of this is the episode called Reckoning, in which the director coaxes creditable performances even from the weakest of the cast members and uses James Blunt's song You're Beautiful to masterful effect as incidental music.

The bad news is that, in what appears to be the standard tradition of American TV series, there are simply too many episodes for the ideas they contain.  Themes recur again and again to the point where the characters appear catatonic.  The script writers are lazy, so their scripts lack internal consistency and they fall back on trite plot devices instead of taking the trouble to craft the stories more carefully.  You can almost hear the bored writers sitting around sipping lattes and saying, ""OK, what haven't we had XXX do yet?  And YYY wants an opportunity to show how she can do heartbreak so let's have the characters all drink something that changes their personalities, covers them in bright orange body hair, and brings back the dead.  Then Clark can marry a corpse and Lana can look crushed.""  (Note - if this turns out to be a real episode in Series Seven, don't blame me...)

There's probably enough (intentional) humor and situational possibilities in Smallville for one really good series of about 12 episodes, but there's clearly not enough to stretch interminably over six series with 23 episodes each, especially given the limitations of the cast and the insouciance of the writers.  We did, however, appreciate the determination of the writers to avoid ""tights and flights"" which at least precluded additional embarrassment.  And some of the special effects are excellent.",1170979200,2,2136,5.083094555873926

2598180,5,B000G1R4SO,"Plenty of other users have commented on the quality of the season and the contents of the DVDs themselves; I agree that every season of Smallville has so far been better than the last, but all have been exceptional in building on the lore and background of The Man of Steel.

That's why I'm more focused on letting those who have purchased Seasons 1-4 (or any of them individually) know that the Season 5 packaging has changed.

Seasons 1-4 featured heavy duty packaging; the case was like a book, with a hard front and back cover. Inside the front cover, the little booklet featuring information about the different episodes, discs, and features was held in a little flap.

The six discs were secured in three hard, double sided plastic shells; they were actually six shells, but then sets of two are melted in the four corners to create three ultra-tough homes for your discs.

To access the disc, the standard press-to-release holder secured the middle hole; of note however were the four smooth finger areas at the upper and lower corners. They weren't so much cutouts or impressions as they were smooth transitions.

I personally loved these, even though they are a half-inch thicker than the new, Season 5+ packages. They flipped open like a book, and felt like they were archival quality, and would stand up over the test of time.

Now, as clarification, the Season 5 cases are well produced and sturdy, but they don't have the same feeling. The booklet is still inside the little flap, but practically everything else has changed.

The discs are now packaged two at a time on a single piece of plastic, one sitting half over the other. Their 'homes' are like a split-level, if you will. One disc sits in a deeper recession, with two cutout style finger grips, with the second straddling it, the top of the second disc sitting just below the hole of the first (deeper recessed).

The finger holes for the disc sitting on top, however, are more for leverage, and do not let you actually make contact with the side of disc. Instead, they simply give you some place to pull against. The great thing, and I wish they had featured these in the Season 1-4 cases, is that the center ring is quite sturdy. It's only a half-ring in the center hole, but it holds the disc securely without making you feel as though you will break the disc when removing it from the case.

Lastly, they don't open like a book, but more like a pamphlet or brochure. This means that it's more difficult to get to discs 3, 4, 5, and 6 because you have to open it completely; it requires more space to open them even if they save you space on your bookshelf.

All in all, the size has only dropped a half-inch, from 1.5 to 1 inch, but I really would have preferred the choice to get the Season 1-4 style case, even if it were a dollar or two more expensive. They're more sturdy, look better on the bookshelf because they look like, well, books, and were easier to open and access the discs. Lastly, I'm just a tad upset that the continuity of the collection was broken - the cases don't all look the same, and it means that they don't look as nice on my DVD collection book-case.

I still love Smallville, however! :) Thanks to those who stuck through the review to the end.",1170892800,3,3249,4.508503401360544

2598206,5,B000G1R4SO,"I have watched all 5 seasons of Smallville, now....and the 5th Season is, perhaps, my favorite.  I say this because the characters are more complex and the writing has more twists and is less predictable than earlier seasons.  The really nice thing about owning and watching the full seasons is that you can get a better sense of where the story is going, as each episode has some ties to the last one...and having to wait a week between episodes on t.v. tends to weaken the sense of continuity that you get by watching the episodes back-to-back.  Only problem I have with Season 5 is that I now have to wait ??? months for Season 6 to go onsale.  Fun series for an old guy that grew up reading Superboy and Superman comic books...  ;-)",1168732800,,736,4.4222222222222225

2598212,5,B000G1R4SO,i enjoyed the 5th season of Smallville thoroughly.  Maybe it is because you might see another couple JLA members.  Or is could be that you start to see Lex start to turn even more.  Better yet it could also be because Fine or Brainiac is in it.  Even if it is not that i still enjoyed it.,1168473600,,288,4.0

2598238,5,B000G1R4SO,"In all the seasons of Smallville we have seen the progression of Clark Kent. From farmboy to Superman. Season 5 is no different. The first 10 minutes will have you hooked for the rest of the season. The Fortress of Solitude kicks things into gear. Unlike season 4 which had every main character on some ""Da Vinci Code"" quest to find some stones, season 5 gets down to what Clark does best: Saving the world. Not only do you still have Lex to deal with but you also have Brainiac playing Clark against Lex.

This is the season where Smallville reached it's 100th episode. One word to describe the episode would be: emoitional. If you are a fan of the Superman mythos then you knew this day was coming. Very touching and you can see how Clark really starts taking more responsibility for his life and how he can make the world a better place.

All in all, I own every season of Smallville and this season by far is the best! By the end of this season you will have a better understanding of how Clark becomes Superman and why he must do what he does. Also the season finale had everyone cheering for ZOD.",1168473600,,1102,4.344660194174757

Clark Kent(Tom Welling) does a really fine job showing the normal problems associated with teenage while trying to keep his special skills secret. John Schneider and Annette O'Toole are caring and convincing as parents. You are appalled and sympathetic to Michael Rosenbaum's Lex Luthor.

2598274,5,B000G1R4SO,"Smallville beats all! Every season from 1 to 5 has been excellent! The only bad show is the one in Season 4 when they are nearing the end of senior year and that boy keeps freezing people. I do have to admit, that in Season 5, I'm becoming a bit tired of what feels like at this point repetitive freaks who keep ending up in Smallville and how Clark has to fix everything. Had to fast forward through those parts. But I believe this is the best show on the air, I just want it to keep going and going. It appeals to both men and women alike.

The visual effects of the show are OUTSTANDING! The sets, clothes, homes, everything is done with taste to the hilt. I love being inside the Talon (wonderully put together in a faux, Egyptian noveaux style: such soft, bright pastels), Lana's apartment, the mansion, Clark's home, the hospital (has soft turquoise walls and black and white checkered floor tiles), the sorority house...I could go on and on. The set is so completely appealing to the eyes. It would be nice for Smallville to have decorating book made based on the sets! That would be neat! The characters are unbelievably well cast - the writer of the script is a genius. Lana, Chloe, Lois, Lois' sister, etc, everyone is so beautiful, especially Fish Boy from Season 5. Lex and Clark are such studs.

I went on Michael Rosenbaum's (Lex Luthor) website, God, he is so cute! So weird to see him as someone else. Anywho, Smallville hasn't become a bit old after 5 seasons!! My favorite episode so far is the one in Season 5 when Lex gets shot and has the ""dreams"" if you will, of how wonderful his life could turn out if he would only make the right choices.

You know, people could learn a lot about improving their own qualities from the Kents, Lana and Chloe; they are completely Unselfish people who always want to make good and do the RIGHT thing - I love watching people who have such a bright light inside them.

The fifth season begins by delving deeply into Clark's Kryptonian heritage with the introduction of the REAL Fortress of Solitude, and a new big-bad, Brainiac, played by James Marsters (Spike from Buffy and Angel), who works for the even bigger baddie, General Zod. If you love Superman, you'll really love this season. My only gripe is with the 100th episode, Reckoning.

The characters are still flat and lifeless, the acting is still mediocre and the characters are all still having the same issues with each other that they have for 5 years.  When I am in the mood to just watch something semi entertaining and brain dead, this is what I choose. Now don't get me wrong, there are those moments where I do enjoy it (obviously, or I wouldn't continue watching it each year), but by no means is it a smart show. If you are looking for a brilliant, witty, academically savvy show to discuss over coffee, this just isn't it. If you are looking for those then I direct you to Buffy the Vampire Slayer (don't laugh, this show is brilliant and has many a college class devoted to it), and also Veronica Mars (again, an incredible piece of work). If you want something your 12 year old finds entertaining then pick Smallville. It is cheesy but fun.",1167868800,,959,4.448863636363637

""Smallville"" depicts Superman in his teen and well now with the 5th season his college years. It does a great job of showing how a young Clark Kent is molded by his parents, varying circumstances, Lionel and Lex Luthor, and the fact that he has to continue to hide his secret from all his friends. The 5th season has all the twists and great endings of the previous seasons and what's great about the 5th season is that we are introduced to some of Superman's future companions in the Justice League (I won't name names to add a little suspense to those who don't know yet). Although I don't feel the 5th season has had as many outstanding special effects as the other episodes in previous seasons, we do get to finally see Clark (Superman) fly - which is truely unbelievable and will send chills down your spine. That alone is enough to make one want to buy this DVD. Also, there is another one of his powers unveiled which is pretty cool. To sum it up, go buy season 5 and then if you don't have the others, go buy seasons 1-4 if you are truely a superman fan such as myself. Go Blue.",1167782400,,1248,4.337606837606837

Every character has matured, especially Lex Luthor and Clark, and their relationship continues to become more complex as they grow into the villain/hero they are to be. This season we see Lex's dark side much more clearly, though Clark's naivete is still a little bit frustrating. I can only hope that in season six he loses his aw shucks innocence and steps into the power and responsibility that is his destiny (I don't watch them on TV, but hold out for the DVD's).

My one gripe with this set is that the promised peek at the documentary, ""Look, Up In The Sky..."" seems to be missing. Maybe I have overlooked it, so if anyone has any guidance on where it might be, I would appreciate it.",1167782400,,842,4.432258064516129

With the rise of the Fortress of Solitude and the shocking death of his adoptive father Jonathan (John Schneider), Clark Kent (Tom Welling) comes closer to the destiny that was in stored for him. With the weight of the world on his shoulders, Clark ends his relationship with Lana Lang (Kristen Kreuk) and pushes her into the arms of his devious rival Lex Luthor (Michael Rosembaum). Chloe Sullivan (Allison Mack) begins her dream job at the Daily Planet. A mysterious college professor (James Marsters) manipulates Clark and Lex to unleash a terrible evil upon the Earth. ""Smallville"" is the successful live-action comic book series that follows the adventures of a young Clark Kent during the years before he becomes Superman. With its entertaining storylines, great cliffhangers, an appealing cast and appearances of other known DC characters, the fifth season ranks as one of the best seasons of ""Smallville"".

""Smallville: The Complete Fifth Season"" is a well recommended purchase for any devoted ""Smallville"" fan. All 22 episodes in this 6-disc are presented in 1.78 anamorphic widescreen format. The picture quality is quite enjoyable with bright colors and good clarity. Though fans would prefer a 5.1 Dolby Digital track, its 2.0 Dolby Digital sound really delivers. Its supplemental extras include the 20-minute ""Vengeance Chronicles"" webisodes, several deleted scenes, ""Making the Milestone"" behind-the-scenes featurette and audio commentaries by the show's cast and creators on three episodes. Overall, ""Smallville: The Complete Fifth Season"" gets a ""B+"".",1166572800,,1828,5.436619718309859

2598371,4,B000G1R4SO,"Production is of general good quality but the change in packaging causes more DVD handling.  I am extremely happy that this DVD set did not have a software glitch that skipped sectors in any episode.  This set includes the half-hour making of Reckoning(100th episode) and two episodes in two versions(standard and w/commentary).  The disk episode menu has been improved in including a scissors icon(related deleted scenes) jump to deleted scenes.  The actor for Prof. Fines, James Marsters, is doing some commentary, but I do not think that he says enough.  Another Smallville actor, John Glover, did a lot more commentary in a prior season and this allowed you to judge the intelligence that he(Glover) brings to his character.  I am a little disappointed that the show's producers have kept the SAME ending music for seasons three thru five and now six when they dumped the really nice ending theme of seasons one and two.  The major reason that I got the current season set is that regular TV reception has become poor-to-impossible on the WB(now, CW) station.

2598374,5,B000G1R4SO,"This was a huge season for Smallville. Early in the season Clark is warned that the life of someone he loved would be taken. Our hero shows a greater depth and more angst than he has ever shown before as he deals with the consequences of his actions. This is his first step on the road to becoming Superman. Additionally, the ongoing alien plotline is much more intriguing and well put together than previous season arcs. There is a main villain who is complex and much more interesting than previous season villains. Clark and Chloe's friendship reaches a new dynamic and they were an awesome team in season 5.

Highlights include: ""Arrival"" the premiere, ""Zod"" the finale, ""Reckoning"" the hundredth episode, ""Hidden"", and ""Splinter."" It seems every character (except for perhaps Lois) had a well written plotline that carried through the season. Smallville's greatest season yet.

Yes, there are a few episodes and character introductions which don't lead anywhere, and there do seem to be more product placements than in the past (budget pressures?), but these are minor quibbles.

The picture quality was incredible--brighter than your typical movie DVD, and without the motion artifacts of broadcast high-definition video.

One of the DVD extra features goes behind the scenes to show how a few creative writers and video/sound effects people in Hollywood interact with the cast and crew shooting in Vancouver to produce what looks like a seamless product.

2598500,5,B000G1R4SO,"One of the things that makes Clark Kent/Superman so compellingly different from most other heroes, is that Superman is who he really is.  His secret identity is Clark Kent.  Most heroes, like Spider-Man wear masks and try to detract any notion that they are the man underneath the mask.  This is the on-going struggle of Clark in Smallville, as he constantly fights against who he is.  Part of that reason, however, is that Clark has yet to find that identity.  He doesn't quite know yet who he is, and who he will become.

Season 5 of Smallville can be described as a transition time for Clark as he changes from a small town boy from Smallville into a man who becomes more concerned globally about what is going on, not only with his family and the town of Smallville, but also about what might happen to Metropolis and the rest of the world.  And let me just add that this is one hell of a season for this show!  You may have thought that you had seen it all in the previous four seasons, but the great team of writers who work on the show still have a lot of story to cover.  Check out the making of the 100th episode in this DVD package.  I love how the writers just fly around the conference table, kicking ideas around.  The success of any show truly rests in the power of the writers.  If you can't continuously come up with compelling stories, then it really doesn't matter how good your cast is.

In this season, you will see Clark make the ultimate sacrifice.  He must also deal with the loss of a loved one, even more catastrophic than the death of Alicia in last year's season.  The episode that deals with this is one of the most heart-wrenching that you'll ever see. Clark will also find a most unlikely ally as he tries to fight against his toughest opponent yet.  I'm not going to reveal too much story here in case you haven't seen this season yet.

In many ways, we watch the Smallville characters fleshing themselves out as they also transition from adolescence into young adults.  Chloe is working at the Daily Planet now, and she is Clark's most trusted and valued friend.  While she still has the thirst for the top story, Chole is ever loyal and faithful, and she simply won't put Clark and his secret in jeopardy.  Allison Mack has truly solidified her position on the show and helped to cement Chole Sullivan forever in Superman lore.  DC Comics has even announced that they will begin to integrate the character of Chloe into the comics.

Lana is a character who is still struggling with her needs.  In some ways, she's become a very sympathetic character.  Emotionally scarred from so many tragedies and losses, you have to wonder just how much more she can take.  Kristen Kreuk still does a wonderful job of playing the beautiful but always hurting and lonely Lana Lang.  She gives her trust and feelings so quickly and completely, she continues to find that she doesn't receive the same level of trust and honesty that she, herself, so willingly gives.

Michael Rosenbaum, who in my opinion, is the best actor to have played Lex Luthor as the corporate tycoon.  No longer a young adult, or a pawn of his father's constant ""games,"" he's taken Lex Luthor many steps closer to becoming Superman's greatest rival.  He's become a master of half-truths and manipulation.  There is a key episode in this season when Lex pretty much sheds the last part of his humanity for what he truly craves: power and money.  It is almost sad to watch, because we, as the audience, have seen where he's come from.  The writers have more than succeeded in writing Lex Luthor as a tragedy.

Tom Welling simply continues to broaden his range as an actor.  If you don't believe me, watch him in the first season and compare his work with this one.  He plays Clark with that spirit of goodness that is not easy to pull off.  Tom has honed his acting to a point where a simple look is all that needed to tell what he's thinking and feeling.  This is a tough season in the storyline of Clark Kent as lines begin to be drawn between those he can count on, and those he can't.  Clark also begins to broaden his scope of vision.  He realizes that sometimes, he has to give up something for the greater good.  We see Clark slowly becoming the selfless hero that he will one day be.

One of my favorite actors on this show is John Glover as the Lionel Luthor.  The show simply wouldn't be the same without him.  The Tony Award winning actor is brilliant each and every season.  This time, and in many ways, we wonder what Lionel's true motives are again, and how will they impact Clark?

This season also saw the addition of James Marsters as Professor Fine.  Those of you who are not familiar with his work, he played one of the most popular television characters in recent years, Spike, from Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  Few people are familiar with his stage work.  He is a fantastic actor, and Smallville was indeed lucky to get him on the show.

This season sees the greatest Smallville episode, ""Reckoning"" that I've seen yet.  It is a virtually flawless episode that the viewer won't soon forget.  However, this season also has the worst episode done yet, ""Thirst,"" which is supposed to be a slightly funny spoof on Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  It's a story about a sorority infested with vampires.  The writers are trying to be funny, but this is one of the those times when they don't quite pull it off.  While you might decide to skip this episode, I'd advise against it, as there are some key elements that are a part of this season's main storyline.

This season has many surprises and thrills.  Another hero comes to Smallville.  We saw the Flash last year, and Clark even helps another hero of the DC Universe.  And, as you might have guessed, this season ends with yet another huge cliffhanger, and the appearance of a villain that will have you running for your Superman movies again.

It's no accident that Smallville is the WB's number one all-time rated show (now the CW network).  The show has not lost any of its luster or the ability to continue to give us great stories.  The show is successfully re-envisioning one of America's most prolific icons and symbols for goodness and justice.  As Chloe states in this season, ""the world desperately needs a hero.""  And is there one any more compelling than Superman?",1162598400,7,6326,4.523809523809524
2598501,3,B000G1R4SO,"Everyone loves the show just because it is based on the mythos of superman, but the producers/ directors etc have taken some really talented actors and actresses and given them total garbage (by way of storylines/ plots) to work with. I have really tried to continue liking the show because it should by all means be a great show, but the show's STORYLINE's keep driving me away. To be honest, had this show been kept to 4 seasons with one driving plot (Clark's journey to becoming Superman), then this would have been a brilliant series. Flashes of intelligence do NOT constitute a good series. Just stick to the crux of the matter and end it when the time is right. Do not saddle me with crappy angles (Lana as a witch?!! - note how suddenly and stupidly that story ended), Clark's constant lying to Lana (major role model he is), the fact that there seem to be little repercussions from major events in the way that everything is 'neatly' wrapped up by the episode's end, no matter how profound or ridicuous. Don't get me wrong, I love the concept of the show, the cast is fantastic and the setting is wonderful, but the creators are destroying a legendary story and character with these vapid stories and inane plots. Please save the show that has the potential to be brilliant. I refuse to be satisfied with a series where about one out of every seven episodes is acceptable.",1162512000,,1380,4.5910931174089065
2598502,4,B000G1R4SO,"I agree with ""tekfighter"" on a couple of aspects, that the set does not have english subtitles (nor does SUPERNATURAL, season 1)...

BUT!

This season finally comes into the REAL and TRADITIONAL aspects of the Superman storyline. I have enjoyed the writing and the character deviations (everyone should have an open mind about these things) in the whole 1-4 seasons.  However, having ZOD, and the FORTRESS OF SOLITUDE become introduced in Season 5, we are getting into familiar territory!

Also, introducing James Marsters (YAY, Spike!) as the Brainiac was so thrilling to me, an ANGEL fan (and after much prodding, BUFFY, too!) He has such a fine way of acting, which brings more life to his character and to those acting around him.

Knowing what we Superman fans know, Daddy Jonathan Kent was due to die about the time of Clarks discovery of the Fortress...and indeed, there he went! (and beautifully, too!  What a GREAT death scene! Very touching!!)

I was tickled to see ""Bo and Luke"" together again in Episode 6, ""Exposed""! You could see the joy in their eyes at working together, and the idea to write in such things as jumping in through the car window was a hoot!  The younger generation may not get it, but if they can buy the original Dukes of Hazards, now out on DVD- they would appreciate it, as I did! I'm sure John Schneider appreciated having that opportunity after all these years.

""Reckoning"" was a masterpiece in writing, directing and producing.  I was enthralled the whole episode.  Most of the Smallville episodes are fairly predictable, but this one had enough twists and turns to earn my (silent - as nobody else was home) applause.

I don't get the WB channel, or what ever channel that Smallville airs on, so I WAIT until the DVD box set comes out to see the whole season.  This one, Season 5 was worth waiting for!

Keep up the good work!",1161561600,,1866,4.684049079754601

2598504,4,B000G1R4SO,"First and Second season i watched and was disappointed by the repetitious plot and episodes. Kyrptonite rock involved in every episode? So I slowly grew out of the show, always keeping a vigilant watch for something exciting (Flash apperance!). After hearing about Season 5, I knew I had to own it. Aquaman, Brainiac, Cyborg, and Zod! It's a must have season. This season finally focuses on the origins of Superman/Kal-El/Clark. You can see the emergings on a young Superman in this season. He fights off serial killers, the supernatural, and the occational intergalatic attack. This can only get better going into next season. If you were like me, not truly into the show because of the lame story archs of past seasons, this one will recapture your original interest in the show: Seeing Superman in Action.

Why did i give it 4 Stars? It should have more features and some episodes were a waste of my time. All it has are a few deleted scenes and two commentary episodes. Are there trailers, sneak peek of next season, featurettes, bloopers, anything else....no. This is just a neatly packaged box set of the season.

One question remains: When is the glasses comingin? And when is the costume going to emerge?

Favorite Eps:
Arrival (Kyrptonian Zod Disciples)
Aqua (Aquaman Appearance)
Cyborg (Wish there was more action in it, but its a DC character so I can't hate it)
Mercy (Saw Rip off, but it worked so well. I've never seen such acting from O'Toole or Glover. It was remarkably good.)

I still with held from watching until I saw the DVD available.

Now after watching the entire season in nearly one setting (yes I didn't do much last weekend) I am overly excited to see what will happen in this new 6th season that just premiered.

All in all if the show keeps on this upward trend in may just pull through to be one of the best shows on TV!!",1160006400,3,760,4.04
2598547,2,B000G1R4SO,"The horror....the horror....the Lana-Clark relationship never goes anywhere, and it never ends, like a horrible merry-go-round that you can't get off. It's one thing to have them not flirting, but they're still arguing in every episode, just like when they were dating! Unacceptable.

Is it fair to trash a series, that was once extraordinary, for merely becoming a by-the-numbers, middling sci-fi show? I'm not sure. There were times I thought my head would explode:
1)- The unforgivable misuse of JAMES MARSTERS (I refuse to type his name in anything less than all caps)
2)- Lex and Lana dating is even less interesting than Jason and Lana dating from last season, an amazing feat to say the least.
3)- Lana going from hating Lex (hmm, interesting) to dating him (gah).

Either way, I have to conclude that this is the worst season ever. Michael Rosenbaum as Lex always gives 110%, even when he's given lines that make him sound retarded, so there's that.

I won't waste time saying what's obvious: this show has seen better days. When Clark loses his powers, or gets them back, or someone has to trade their life for Clark's to balance out the universe, or spaceships disappear (over and over), there's no direct, cohesive explanation. EVER. At least humor me with a throwaway line of dialog, guys! Don't blow me off with something like ""You died, and now you're alive, and now the cosmos has to kill someone else to balance its budget, and for some reason, it's gotta be someone you know""!
At least this show always delivers during sweeps....oh wait, no it doesn't. They just make Lois do a strip routine. I forgot. It's kind of hard to watch at times because you can tell Kristen Kreuk is really trying and that she's a good actress, but no one really cares about Lana. After 5+ years Rosenbaum looks like he's sleepwalking through the whole thing. Lois behaves as if she's stupid, she's never serious, and shouldn't even be there. I've complained about this in last season's review so I won't go into it.

A nice change: some of the guest stars are really good this time. With the exception of that awful chick who played the ""Angel of Vengeance"". Did you notice how many successful films were ripped off for their plots? One episode is a point-for-point remake of ""Saw"", barely tweaked for a PG audience. It's insulting. ""Reckoning"", was meant to carry great emotional weight, but got torpedoed by a seriously unwelcome ""twist"" at the 30-min mark (cough!*finaldestination!*cough*)

Ok, I lied. I will complain about Lois. What the donkeys is she doing there? These high-profile political jobs keep falling in her lap. How? The girl never works. However, if it means they will finally kill the aging Clark-Lana relationship (please....someone let it die...), then fine. But after five years of waiting I doubt it will ever happen.

Now to review the extras: Oh wait. Just two commentaries, with no regular cast members, featuring Al Gough and Miles Millar in an hour-long exercise in self-congratulation. For some reason, unbeknownst to me or probably even the Almighty itself, they chose to add a commentary for the episode ""Thirst"".

WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY?????!!!!!???!!!!???!!!!

Everybody knows this was the weakest episode. It's patronizing. It's ridiculous. Kristen Kreuk's little behind wiggling in a catsuit. That's the whole point for this episode existing. BY ZEUS, how many seasons must pass before they stop fetishizing Lana? It's ridiculous, and they make her character intolerable, constantly berating Clark when he does nothing wrong. Ugh. What a mess.

Casting JAMES MARSTERS was utter genius. Making Brainiac into Clark's college professor was wicked! it reminded me of the old days when the show still surprised me. But the whole thing was basically squandered. He was just used as a device for the Clark vs. Zod thing toward the end. He was not a very formidible villain, either. Blasphemy! You do not cast JAMES MARSTERS and NOT make him the main villain. He's really good here too! What a waste.

Let me close by reminding people that Lois Lane is a college dropout. Not exactly Campaign Manager material.",1159747200,11,4130,4.963820549927641
2598548,4,B000G1R4SO,"The Smallville series may be likened to a swinging pendulum at times.  If the second season was uplifting, the third season very dark, and the fourth just plain whacky, then the fifth season has swung back to a more somber tone.  If some themes had to be pigeonholed for this season, then it would have to do with the wielding of power, and the responsibility that comes with it-not only in the action of its exercise, but in the acceptance of its consequences afterward.  In this season Clark has to make some life-defining decisions-and they aren't always the right ones.  If you're looking for character development, forget it.  All the primaries seem to be stuck in the same mode as from the second season.  Lex is still secretive, Chloe doggedly loyal, Lana forever stuck in I-can't-do-this-anymore- emotional mode, Martha and Jonathan Kent sagely and parental with no hidden secrets or agendas, and Lionel ambiguously helpful.  This is not to imply the series is beginning to get mired in stupid, boring repetitive stories.  One of the refreshing twists brought into this season is the addition of Milton Fine, cunningly played by James Marsters.  Some of the episodes, however, were woefully redundant:  ""Mortal""-Clark loses his powers...been there, done that; ""Hidden""-Chloe hooks up with a psycho who wants to do that thing that he does . . . remember that one?  There is also a blatent X-Files rip-off with the whole spaceship and the oil-like life form that oozes from it--the ship even looks exactly like the one from the X-Files episodes!  But, persevere.  There are also some really glorious episodes:  ""Aqua""-what's not to like about the Aquaman (or AC) in this episode!  ""Exposed"" reunited John Schneider with his 80's Dukes of Hazzard partner, Tom Wopat-there is a priceless scene of Lois going undercover as a stripper which is one of the highlights of the season.  ""Reckoning"" of course is classic mythology-it has it all through the parallel realities we get to see; aching and bittersweet, this is probably the best episode of the season. ""Vessel"" is also close-things seem to be heading down an unalterable path between Lex and Clark.  One of the problems many viewer may have this season is in the choices Clark and Lana (and the writers) make; to some it may seem as if Lana's character is unknowingly degenerating morally-she is certainly suffering from not having all the pieces to the puzzle.  Chloe's character seems to come out on top, as far as the female roles go.  Allison Mack is able to inject real pathos into what could have otherwise been a faceless sidekick role.  Lois Lane may still take some getting used to, but by now she will have probably grown on most viewers.  The extras for this season are very nice.  There is an extensive documentary about filming the 100th anniversary episode as well as a way cool Vengeance Files, which continues the ""Vengeance"" episode left off--there are some interesting cameos in this short episode as well.  The cliffhanger the season ends on is strangely appropriate, given the lack of directions the writers sometimes seemed to be suffering from in some of the episodes.  It will be interesting to some questions finally get answered in season 6--such as when comes the Superman costume and when will he really begin to fly?  My guess is when Cal-El and Clark are finally reconciled into one identity.  Stay tuned!",1159488000,4,3392,4.9070175438596495
2598549,4,B000G1R4SO,"In general I liked the stories we were shown in fifth season but as always some needed more work than others. #5 Thirst,  Lexmas- they'd be hard to rewrite, #3 Hidden was really pretty good except that it all occurred in just an hour didn't it?, too much going on for so short a time.

I think I liked #1 Arrival as much as any episode this year, #12 Reckoning was the 100th episode and was kind of sad but it had it's good points. The writing of just about all of the episodes was good, even if the stories were sometimes a little off, the greatest irritations were the way Jor-El still can't make up his mind to be good or evil, Lionel Luthor is first good, then evil and the way the Clark/Lana romance burned out (maybe it's by the book for them to not go on, but this way?).

I haven't found the ""Look, Up in the Sky!"" bit but the deleted scenes were interesting as was the ""Vengeance Chronicle"" featurette. The worst thing about the packaging this time out was the new space saver form in which two discs are stuck on the same page/card. In order to get at the second one you have to lift the other one off first, I'd rather not handle the discs that much. The ""Surface"" series is like this too, hope it doesn't become a new trend.",1159142400,2,1236,4.184873949579832
2598550,4,B000G1R4SO,"Smallville continues to deliver the goods.  The show continues to grow and shows no signs of aging or having lost its focus.  On the contrary, season 5 is brave, clever and sings above its own range on several occasions.  The addition of James Marsters as Brainiac was inspired. But, seeing as how Jimmy Boy comes off one of the greatest one hour prime time shows in Television history I must make a small comparrison here.  Joss Whedon (creator of Buffy) never (or seldom) talked down to his audiences.  His postmodern playfullness often exceeded or downright fractured genre expectations and raised Buffy way above the mediocrity of contemporary mainstream television programming.  I feel that Smallville had the same opportunities but continues to play to genre contrivances and the old fashioned tried and true Secrets and Lies modus.  Speaking of which, the Lana/Lex relationship insults the viewers intelligence.  Yes, while it is true that some dogs out there pine for and plot to steal girlfriends and that gullible girls often take the bait - it is insulting to try and pull this particular triangle off.  Insulting and downright frustrating - and leads me to wonder why Smallville would pander to Soap Opera conventions for the ""manufacturing"" of drama.  They've been guilty of these things before (hell, what show hasn't) but, the level of ""eye rolling"" that I did this season reached new levels.  While season 5 put the show forward in many respects, the writers should take note that they've yet to approach Buffy in terms of sheer sophistication.  You want to take the show to Dark places Smallville writers??  Look at season 6 of Buffy - that's a paradigm of dark yet real for fantasy tv programming.  The 4 stars are for the times when they took chances this season that ACTUALLY PAID OFF through quality writing - 3.5 stars is more accurate.",1158796800,2,1858,4.913461538461538
2598551,5,B000G1R4SO,"""An astonishing season of destiny"" claims the back cover of ""Smallville: The Complete 5th Season."" The main question is, does that claim hold true?

The answer is a resounding yes. As a ""Smallville"" fanatic, the fifth season was a wonder to behold. Romance, destiny, tragedy; this season has it all, and packs quite a wallop. The season begins right after the second meteor shower with Smallville in ruins. A ship lands, with two kryptonians seeking Kal-El. Back in the arctic, the Fortress Of Solitude rises. What a way to start the season! This is also the season we see Clark (Tom Welling) and Lana (Kristin Kreuk) in a serious relationship that ends badly, Johnathan (John Schneider) runs for state senator, Chloe (Allison Mack) becomes Clark's true confidante, Lionel (John Glover) channel Jor-El, Martha (Annette O'Toole) becomes Kansas state senator, Lex (Michael Rosenbaum) moves closer to accepting his evil destiny, and Lois (Erica Durance) is, well, Lois. We also see the arrival of Brainiac (James Marsters) and the coming of ZOD. Lastly, the life of a beloved main character is lost. This is, without a doubt, the best season of ""Smallville"" to date! The best episodes of the season are ""Arrival,"" ""Hidden,"" ""Reckoning,"" and ""Vessel."" Buy this and see for yourself! Here is a list of episodes followed by a rating.

Video: Just like previous seasons, the video is in 1.78:1 anamorphic widescreen. The transfer is simply smashing. The colors are beautiful, and the picture is nice and sharp. (5/5)

Audio: The Dolby 2.0 track sounds very good. The music, dialogue, and effects all sound great. No complaints here. (4/5)

Extras: First up, there commentary tracks on the episodes ""Thirst"" and ""Splinter."" The ""Thirst"" commentary features the producers. This is basically a ""What the hell were we thinking?!"" track, and is quite funny. The ""Splinter"" commentary features the producers and James Marsters. This is a very informative track, and is very entertaining. Next up is the ""Making Of A Milestone"" featurette chronicalling the process in making the episode ""Reckoning."" The version on the standard DVD runs about half an hour in length, and is a great insight into making an episode. If you were lucky enough to pick this up at Best Buy (like me), then you are treated to a bonus disc which features the uncut version of ""Making Of A Milestone"" which runs over an hour in length! Its definately worth it to pick up the set at Best Buy. It is a great documentary, and definately worth a look. Next up is a teaser for the ""Look! Up In The Sky!"" Superman documentary. Next up are ""The Vengeance Chronicles"" web-isodes. These are really fun, and definately worth a look. There are also trailers for ""Superman Returns,"" ""Smallville,"" and ""Superman On DVD."" (4/5)

Overall: ""Smallville""'s best season gets the best treatment on DVD so far. Excellent audio and video, and some really worthwhile features makes this a no-brainer. BUY THIS SET!! (5/5)",1158796800,6,3520,5.117338003502627
2598552,5,B000G1R4SO,"As the title says, this was the best season of Smallville to date, in my opinion. I do acknowledge that the first season cannot be compared, since it was what hooked me to the whole Smallville ride, yet 5 is amazing.

As many of the other reviewers stated, I can't state too much without giving away plot details but in this season you are SO close to the ""thing"" which solidifies the Superman persona that you can almost taste it. Just from when clarke finds out that Chloe knows to the very last episode, you are carried away on some amazing story lines and, in my case, proud to be a Smallville Addict.

The best episode's, by far, were Lexmas, Reckoning and Fragile. The most emotionally produced/directed episodes of the season. I found myself crying in each of them, and no TV show has been able to do that for me.

Smallville is one of the best TV shows running on television, and this is definitely a biased opinion! :p (Tom Welling=hawwt!)",1158537600,,948,4.5
2598553,4,B000G1R4SO,"I really, really love ""Smallville"" and don't think I can add anything that you won't read in other reviews but, I've got a gripe about the 5th season packaging that I just can't overlook... There are no English subtitles! How can this be? There's Spanish subtitles and there's French subtitles but no English. Now, personally, I don't HAVE to have subtitles... I just like them to be available because I can get a lot more out of the story, but, what about people who are hard of hearing or deaf? The first four seasons included English subtitles.

My only other complaint about Season 5 is the packaging... not nearly as nice as the first 4 seasons... and I hate the overlapping DVDs which make it hard to remove the DVDs in the rear. But, my main complaint is not having the English subtitles. I got spoiled watching the first 4 seasons and having the subtitles.

The package is pretty slick but it doesn't old the same with the old ones but it really is a improvement. The sound here really isn't much to say since it's present in Dolby Stereo(thank God since I don't have a home theater yet!) The picture is just top notch like the other seasons, much what we can expect from this dvd's.

2598556,5,B000G1R4SO,"One of the great things about a show like Smallville is that the mythology of the show continues while offering stand-alone episodes that you can watch at any time. The previous seasons had some solid episodes but they were usually inbetween some filler or just plain ok episodes. Season 5 does have its share of underwritten ones but the consistency is probably the best I've seen on the show so far. Since it's a big season I'll just mention the highlights.

Season premiere Arrival has Clark making his Fortress of Solitude while a pair of Kryptonian warriors arrive looking for him. The Phantom Zone is introduced and there's even a mention of Zod. Aqua sees Arthur Curry joining the Smallville universe when he tries to stop one of Lex's projects. It's an alright episode but it mainly works for the geek factor with Aquaman. In Splinter, Clark gets infected by silver kryptonite which causes him to get super paranoid and believe everyone is after him.

Lexmas finds Lex shot and him dreaming of a world where he's happy, married to Lana and good friends with Clark again but it doesn't have a happy ending. The big 100th episode Reckoning has Clark finally telling Lana his secret but things end badly and has to change it which means someone else has to take that person's place. Vengeance finds a new superhero, the Angel of Vengeance, striking a friendship with a grieving Clark but she's not exactly a role model. Victor Stone, aka Cyborg, escapes from a lab where he's given a metal skeleton and Clark helps him deal with people who are after him.

Fragile, directed by Tom Welling, has Clark striking a friendship with a girl who can shatter glass. It's basically similar to the character Ryan from season 1 but this one works better. In a big Saw ripoff(or is it homage?), Lionel shows just how bad*** he is when he has to play the games set by a bitter stranger. Oracle sees Jonathan's ghost appearing to Clark telling him to kill Lionel and Fine continues to manipulate his way around Lex. Ends on a really cool cliffhanger. And then we have the season finale Vessel, where Clark finds out that Zod will be reborn under a new body and Clark has to kill him. Ends on a really awesome cliffhanger which thank god we get to see the rest played out on the CW.

Like I said, the consistency in this season is strong but it does have a few iffy parts: Thirst, which is essentially a big Buffy homage, including a character named Buffy Sanders, is just not that great. Lockdown is another merely ok episode, same with Tomb which wouldn't work if it wasn't for Allison Mack. But unlike season 4 where there were few bright spots, season 5 is strong through the entire thing. One thing I can always criticize the Smallville sets with is having very little extras. The special effects are awesome in this season yet we get nothing. Commentaries for Rosetta and Memoria were perfectly picked. Here? We get Thirst and Solitude. What about Arrival or Reckoning or Vessel?

However this is arguably the strongest season of the show since season 2 and well worth the purchase for fans. Nitpick: the stacked designs for season sets suck and of course we get one for here.",1158192000,4,3171,4.625222024866785

2598580,5,B000G1R4SO,"About the fourth or fifth season, most good Television shows have a life changing season for some of its characters. Sometimes they changes like Cheers (Diane's leaving), have a wedding of a major cast member like Full House (Uncle Jesse's wedding in the season 4 box set),The trip to Californai (season four) and Europe (season 5) of I Love Lucy, Add a baby like Welcome Back Kotter season four (when is that show having a box set of season one!)-well you get the Idea. Well some things work well and moves the show to a new place and others fail badly and are canceled.

So In Smallsville's fifth, we see the more agressive  Lex Luthor getting more power hungry and gaining more dislike and growing a large rift for Clark. In this season, Clark is becoming the SUPERMAN in trainning, learning the idea of great power and how to use it,  and dealing with death with someone close to him (the 100th episode)and not being able to change it. Lana is still the Kid sister type for Clark for is growing further and further apart from the future man of Steel and closer to Lex. Chloe and Lois are still there. and Other characters grow up due to situations throw out in this years season. So  the show's dark side this season is making this piece of TV worth watching.

The stunt casting of Former Dukes of Hazard cast Member Tom Wopat (as a family friend), James (X Men) Marstens intro as Brainiac, Aquaman guest appearance(which should have been a series for the new CW network-It might have been better than Man from Atlantis!), General Zod intro and the death of someone close to Clark were hit and miss highlights to this year's season..but it still is GOOD TV

So am I waiting for season six, YES and this box set will be a great treasure of good TV

2598582,4,B000G1R4SO,"Ever since the first season aired, I've been hooked.  I've always loved everything about the Superman universe.  The original Richard Donner films, at least for me as a kid, was my way of escaping reality and attaching myself to a character that all kids could look up to.  And in my mind, Christopher Reeve WAS AND STILL IS Superman(Sorry Dean Cain & Brandon Routh).  Which to say is why I originally had a difficult time coming to grips with a show that didn't dable with the titular character, despite the show's intriging premise of showcasing how Clark Kent would one day become known as the world's greatest hero.  I love how the show continues to explore the challenges that Clark confronts with each new ability(speaking of which, where's the freeze breath?)  But by far the show's best element(in my opinion)is how John and Martha Kent bestowes upon Clark his infamous humble nature by showing him right from wrong.  After all, Superman wouldn't be the hero that he is today if it weren't for their teachings.

Now with all that being said, and as we enter the sixth season, I do have a minor complaint.  Honestly, I think Tom Welling has done a fantastic job portraying Clark Kent, but as any typical fan of the show will know, Tom is 30 years old now, and while he certainly has aged well, he just doesn't pass for the ""college student fresh out of high school"" look anymore.  Tom Welling is a grown man and certainly looks like a grown man, which is why it kills me to say this, but they're going to have to wrap this series up.  Considering how old the cast now is(and looks), it's kind of mind boggling to think that Clark still isn't in glasses(making identifying him as Supes all the more easier), and that Lois still isn't involved with journalism of any sort.  The biggest burning question on my mind however, is why does everybody still live in Smallville(or more importantly, why does Clark still live at home)?  SPOILER ALERT! - It's time for Clark to leave the nest and start living his own life with the knowledge bestowed upon him from John and Martha, especially considering that John Kent has now passed. Besides, in the comics it was John Kent's untimely demise that propelled Clark to seek out his destiney.

After the dust has settled though, I really loved this season.  I just hope we start to see things change with the upcoming sixth season.  Because needless to say, if Clark is still living at home come the end of this next season, then it'll surley be the producers way of trying to squeeze every last drop of life out of this show.

2598584,5,B000G1R4SO,"There seems to be a split down the middle amongst fans over season five of Smallville. Personally, I found season five to be one of the most interesting, exciting, and well made seasons of the show to date. Relationships were forever changed, new ones were forming, people we loved were taken away, an interesting new villain appeared in the form of one of the genre's best and most popular actors, and two main characters were inching their way closer and closer to their destinies. Season five was a big time winner to me, and it shadows magnificent things to come in the future. The season got off to the right start with the season premiere, ""Arrival"", an exciting opener with slam bang action, effects, and the introduction of the Fortress Of Solitude. Other notable episodes here include ""Mortal"" and ""Hidden"", which finds Clark and Lana moving along with their relationship and Clark facing obstacles powerless. ""Aqua"" features the debut of Aquaman, but the episode was flat and, um, all wet. ""Thirst"" was a silly Halloween episode that was catered to be nothing else but silly fun and a wink at the audience. Carrie Fisher cameos in that one. There's a Dukes reunion in ""Exposed"", when Tom Wopat guest stars. The best of the bunch is ""Splinter"", where Clark goes all paranoid; ""Solitude"" that has Professor Fine/Brainiac(James Marsters)trying to help Martha and showing his true colors; ""Lexmas"" is the show's first ever Christmas episode, and it's the classic tale of Lex seeing how his life may of been different if he took another path. The crown jewel of season five was ""Reckoning"", the 100th episode. Jonathan Kent(John Schneider)passes away from a heart attack, and it's a key moment that pushes Clark closer to becoming Superman. ""Mercy"" is a wonderful episode that has Lionel Luthor and Martha Kent being terrorized and ""tested"" by a maniac in a very ""Saw"" like manner. Great episode. Season five sees the end of Clana once and for all, but it starts up Lexana. Lionel begins putting the moves on widowed Martha, but what are his intentions?. James Marsters of ""Buffy"" and ""Angel"" fame joins the show for multiple episodes as Brainiac, posing as Professor Fine. He was the best addition to the cast. Not all of season five was great, but the majority of it was. Things were forever changed, and once Jonathan Kent passes on, the show is not the same, and that's for the good. Things have to change and move on and grow. Season five is an important season. It may be the most important to date. Things happen here that change the landscape of the show and set things up for further development for what we all know will happen. Season five is at times dark, exciting, sad, emotional, and everything else. A real rollercoaster. Bring on season six!.",1156118400,12,2764,4.79664570230608
2598585,3,B000G1R4SO,"I started off a huge Smallville fan.  First couple seasons were excellently done, with a novel take on young Clark and Lex and the love triangle of Clark, Lana, and Chloe.  Then the 4th season came, and things began to go awry.  The plot dragged on, with the same ""Clark loves Lana, but can't tell her he's an alien, so Lana dumps him while Chloe looks longingly on"" storyline we're all so familiar with at this point.  Lana gets weird tattoes and witchy powers and you find yourself asking ""why?""  What purpose did that serve?  What was that storyline with that Jason guy all about?

But nevertheless, we all went into season 5 with optimism.  And while it was undeniably entertaining, it also let me down quite a bit.  Same stuff as season 4.  Super lame villians (like that guy who could turn into sand.  What the hell kind of power is that? Oh no, watch out! I'll get sand in your eye!).  All strange occurance attributed to meteor rocks - honestly, how many of these rocks are there?  No Chloe-Clark hookup.  Lana still sullen and withdrawn.  Only real thing that got accomplished was the making of Clark and Lex as true enemies.

So will I watch season 6?  Probably, but I really think they need to wrap this series up. It's clearly fading, and the writers just seem out of ideas.  Don'y drag it out any more than necesary and ruin what was once a great series.",1155513600,9,1367,4.443548387096774
2598586,5,B000G1R4SO,"As I've said in my reviews for the first 4 seasons of this spectacular show on The WB network, ""Smallville"" just continues to get better and better with each new episode and with each new season.  This season proves to be no exception, the stories are more epic and dramatic in scope, the acting continues to be solid from all actors on the show (even the guest actors), and the special effects are absolutely brilliant, especially for a TV show budget (the rising of the Fortress of Solitude proves this).

Many big events occur this season on ""Smallville"", beginning right where the season finale of ""Smallville: Season 4"" left off, Clark has thrown the crystal deep in the arctic and this causes a huge crystal fortress to be erected from the snow covered ground, thus his Fortress of Solitude is formed.  Clark must come to grips with many things this season; he must decide whether his love for Lana can survive all the secrets, is his friendship with Lex broken beyond repair, and last but not least worry about getting to class on time at college.  There are several big highlights spread throughout the season, the Season Premiere holds some truly awesome fight scenes and opens the door for many events that will take place throughout the remainder of the season; a dangerous villain from the Superman mythos makes multiple appearances, and a key figure in Clark's life dies leaving Clark wondering how to continue on, and another person knows Clark's secret and the revelation will change Clark's life forever.

This series is like a fine wine, it just keeps getting better with age, with now 5 seasons under its belt, and gearing up for a sixth season, ""Smallville"" shows no signs of slowing down.  All the actors are terrific, generally I praise Tom Welling's improvements in acting from season to season, but at this point he's gotten the role down so perfectly there's not much more to say than that.  He particularly handles the key emotional points in the stories that take place at approximately the half-way point of the season, specifically episode #100 titled ""Reckoning"".  Michael Rosenbaum is awesome as ever as Lex Luthor, who in this season becomes even more increasingly dark and menacing, which is so nice to see, he actually is coming close to eclipsing his father Lionel in terms of despicable actions he commits.

The writing and directing for this show have also never been better, as both strive to bring in more elements from the Superman mythos to further strengthen the 'Smallville' mythology.  And this season also marks Tom Welling's directorial debut for an episode, which was actually very solid for a first-timer.

All in all, there isn't anything I can really complain about with this season of ""Smallville"", generally there is at least one episode that's viewed as a throw-away of sorts, but this season didn't contain any.  Even the ones that I just knew would be somewhat, subpar turned out to be really entertaining and contained some key plot points for furthering the season long story arcs.  This series is definitely not one to be missed, and if you've enjoyed the first 4 seasons, then you must absolutely check this one out!

""Smallville: Season 5"" is unrated and suitable for all ages.",1154390400,29,3236,4.849364791288567

2598610,5,B000G1R4SO,"After that silly witches and stones business (not to mention the Teagues...yawn) in season four, SMALLVILLE got back on track with this excellent season (SPOILERS AHEAD).  The year started off with a bang, with Kryptonian villains, including the great James Marsters as Brainiac.  Chloe, now a keeper of Clark's secret, stopped being an annoyance and become a great ally.  Lex learned the true meaning of Christmas.  Two other DC heroes debuted: Cyborg and Aquaman (""Aqua"" is arguably among the season's best episodes).  The series even celebrated its milestone 100th episode with the death of a major character.

What more can I say?  Oh, yeah, how about this?  The Fortress of Solitude.  An enemy learns Clark's secret...and (so far) doesn't tell anyone.  The Phantom Zone.  SENATOR Martha Kent.  The widening gap between Clark and Lex.  The, uhh, narrowing gap between Lana and Lex.

Every season, despite significant and occasionally great individual episodes, had its clunkers.  These are hard to find in season five.  SMALLVILLE has beaten the odds to become not only a huge success, but very much a part of the overall Superman mythology.",1153440000,12,1145,5.141304347826087

It has everything: Love, Heartache, Betrayel, threats of World Domination, the usual.  It starts off with a bang, Arrival, Mortal and Hidden.  Three of the best episodes of the season.  Splinter is a classic where you see a slightly different Kent Boy.  Solitude, where Clark battles evil Milton Fine a.k.a Braniac.  In Reckoning we lose a beloved character, a truly heart ripping episode.  Very important changes happened in Hypnotic, Mercy, Oracle and Vessel.  Vessel, the season finale, left us all hanging, with everyone of our beloved characters in mortal danger.

2598614,3,B000G1R4SO,"Maybe I'm just getting older, but this season lacked edge and excitement level was mediocre. I've always loved the special effects, but they dwelled on the Clark/Lana situation for way too long, Clark's lying got ridiculously lame, and there was a predictable repetitiveness that took away from a very decent season. Definitely better than Season 4, though. I've noticed that in an effort to keep viewership of its near post-teen fans who've watched the show from the beginning, the show has changed from a wholesome family-oriented show, to one with more suggestive themes. Just an impartial observation...

Kristin Kreuk is one of the reasons I started watching the show, but I think the story can evolve if she is written off at some point next season, OR maybe re-work what her role is. Maybe the writers don't know what to do with her long-term, so they put her together with Lex (maybe to give Clark more reason to hate him). I know they have their reasons, but it didn't make the most sense. As for Chloe, her role finally took a step up -- Allison Mack is a great actress, beautiful, and has always been a consistent bright light for the show all 5 seasons.

I'll probably still buy this to show support, and for the 4-5 really well-done episodes.

I rank the seasons (my opinion) in this order: 2, 1, 3, 5, 4",1152576000,9,1317,4.619658119658119
2598615,4,B000G1R4SO,Smallville Season 5 is the second best season out of 5 seasons! Storyline was good with a great Season Ending Episode leading us to a Greater Season (6th season probaby will then be the best)!!! Must purchase this Season Set if you have not seen Smallville Season 5! New Writers are not needed for Smallville! People just need to realize that this Show is based off of a small run of the Superboy Comic Series!!! People need to look at this as a beginning and they need to block out the movies! Thats the only way to actually like this show/series! And its great that The CW picked this up for the 6th Season!,1152316800,9,609,4.350877192982456
2598616,4,B000G1R4SO,"It seems that we ""down under"" are behind the times.  I think we haven't even seen all of Season Three yet.  I have had to buy the DVDs from the USA to see to the end of Season Four.  My main gripe is the slow pace of development of Clark's abilities.  By this time he should have been able to fly as well as use his vision and audio powers!  I've been a fan for over 50 years and still love the new twists and angles.  The new movie is great, too, and I can't wait to see Season Five of Smallville - I guess I'll have to buy that one, too, as it is unlikely to hit the TV screens here for a long time to come!  ( I should have signed this ""green eyes""!)",1151971200,5,653,3.7573529411764706
2598647,5,B000G1R4SO,"I have been a fan of ""Smallville"" from the beginning, and was very happy both as a viewer and a fan at how this season turned out. In direct opposition to season four's disastrous story arch involving Isobel and the Teague family attempting to manipulate Lana, this one takes a much more serious (and yet enjoyable) path through Clark's choices and their ultimate consequences. It also shifts the love interest from Clark and Lana to Lex and Lana, something they have been hinting at four seasons and only now have the courage to bring out.

Lex Luthor and Jonathan Kent do battle to become state senator, Lionel Luthor switches sides (again), Clark consummates his love for Lana and then is forced to give her up, Chloe starts working for the Daily Planet, one of the leading cast members is killed off, and it winds up in the most explosive, dramatic, and powerful season finale of the series.

It's rare that I have enjoyed almost every episode in a season, but there is some solid stuff here -- ""Lexmas"" is a heart-ripping ""what if"" featuring Lex's alternate life if he is to choose the path of good, with a sadistic twist in the second half to make Stephen King take a step back; ""Tomb"" is a fantastically fun ghost story in which Allison Mack plays an alternate Chloe; ""Reckoning"" brings two consecutive deaths and a painful funereal; ""Mercy"" revolves around the charisma between Martha and Lionel when a manic madman forces them to make their way through his house of horrors; and five or so episodes revolve around the steadily building seduction of Lana Lang. Tom Welling also makes his directorial debut (and a marvelous one at that) in ""Fragile,"" an ironic twist of fate since it contains a super-hot first kiss between Lana and Lex at the end.

I am a little disappointed that there aren't more features (one would have thought at least ""Reckoning"" and ""Fragile"" would get a commentary, and no blooper reel is unfortunate, since many of the actors have mentioned the various pranks and oops! on set) but will be delighted to own this season. I look forward with great anticipation the possibilities the next will bring.",1151539200,111,2131,4.738544474393531

Even though it's comic myth right, I kinda liked having Johnathan in Lois and Clark so that's disappointing (but you could see that one comming a mile away).  If this gets to any writters, you guys are great for the most part.  I'd sure like to see this group do a Lois and Clark series (maybe name it Metropolis).  This is one of the best series I've seen.

2598649,2,B000G1R4SO,"Perhaps they had certain restraints because they were filming the movie around the same time as this season and Warner demanded cetain plot constraints, maybe the creators of this show had their hands full with the Aquaman pilot or maybe they were just running outy of ideas but the creativity was drained from the season and  the directions they couuld have taken the show (100th episode anyone?) they  chickened out on. It was like the show was stuck in a holding pattern, affraid to take any real chances.  The on again and off  again relationsip of Clark and and Lana became laughable vomit inducing. Are they keeping them together for the Clana fans who's average age is 16? Who knows and who cares anymore. It seems Lex and his father have even grown boring.

Excuse me but Lois Lane will not die, and if she does I will quit watching the show.  Clark's father passes away in the original story line and the guys doing the show knew this.  In fact they waited much longer then I thought they would to kill off his character considering he dies when Clark is still in high school in the comic book.  Yeah he is a good character but he was also Clark's crutch way to often.  It was meant to be, it's time for Clark to wrap up his life in Smallville and become the person he is destine to become.  If they go beyond season six I will be very surprised.",1150761600,6,670,4.115384615384615
2598663,4,B000G1R4SO,"Season 5 is one of Smallville's best. But it still isn't what it should be.

It starts off pretty good. The first half of the season is very good, with a few bad episodes in there. But by the second half of the season, you'll be saying, ""When is the story going to be moving along???!!!"" It does, but not until the season is practically over. There are some horrible episodes, like a ""Saw"" rip off. These kind of episodes add nothing to the season and are horribly out of place. The season ultimately pulls it all together, showing an amazing finale, but leaving us with even more questions. My biggest problem with the season, is the treatment of Lana. The writers have decided to write the character off as a complete and ignorant idiot. This is such a shame since Lana added so much to the previous seasons.

The acting in this season is perhaps the best of any season. It's a job well done by the main cast and supporting cast. It has some cool guest performances, such as Kenneth Johnson from the Shield. It does lack the new addition of cast members, which helped Season 4 so much. It's a shame that didn't happen here.

It may be one of Smallville's best, but it could still be better.",1150329600,12,1192,4.384615384615385
2598664,2,B000G1R4SO,"i've been a fan of smallville for quite some time now.  the retelling of the superboy/man legend has been, up until this year, one of my favorite shows for a number of reasons.  it's fresh, fun, dramatic, dark, engaging, exciting and deals with one of america's (not to mention the world's) best known heroes.  however, the producers of this show really dropped the ball this time around.

where as every other season has dealt with some sort of theme or over-arching story development (seasons 1-2 dealing with clarks every-growing array of abilities, the characters relationships, etc, 3 dealing with the caves and the mysteries of clark's future, 4 dealing with the crystals and increasing reality of clark's origins and his seeming growth into adulthood) this 5th season seemed throw together and horribly lacking in the creativity of previous years.  the season premiere and the following two-three episodes start off in the vein of previous seasons in a very exciting continuation of events from the finale of season 4.  however, the show very quickly falls flat.  for starters, being its 5th season on-air it's far to late for throw away single-serve villains circa seasons 1 and 2.  sure, it's okay to have a few here and there, but for most of the season to be comprised of lame, unoriginal, uninspired characters is simply inexcusable.  not to mention most of the disappointing story lines seem to have been recycled from the shows own past episodes which only further disappoints; it can't even rip off cheap stories from other shows, instead it tries to rip itself off unsuccessfully.  the WB had marketed this season as containing ""everything you've been waiting for"" when in fact this season was more of ""clark's creek.""  with all the mystery surrounding clark and the kryptonians there should have been a lot more time spent on things that matter instead of wasting almost the entire season with filler-fluff trash.

on a positive note, there are a handful of top-notch episodes.  as i stated previously, the season starts with a bang.  the 100th episode is touching, ""Lexmas"" gives some interesting insight to Lex's future, and the season finale was what the rest of the season should have been.  but for the most part, this is the worst season of an otherwise excellent show.  with the Aquaman pilot having been rejected from the CW list of projects there's no excuse for season 6 not to come back stronger than ever.  here's hoping its worth watching.",1150329600,8,2469,4.92512077294686
2598665,2,B000G1R4SO,"Thematically, this season was superior to the uncohesiveness of Season 4, but so much of the expectation is built up for this show, wrapped up in stories that never seem to jell together. For this entire season, Lex Luthor's trip to the 'dark' side has been choppily treaded and in the final episodes when his reasoning is revealed for yet another scientific experiment gone bad, once again he's doing for mankind. He's doing it for the greater good. Lex Luthor is still manipulating the world, but for beneficent reasons.

Loyalty and betrayal are indeed two of the subplots of this fifth season - with neither the loyalty and nearly all of the betrayal shown by the future Man of Steel.

The creators and producers have had five years to get the classic Clark Kent/Superman/Lex Luthor enmity developed. It's about time they moved from animosity and finally got down to business.",1150243200,9,880,4.86

Sure, Superman characters are there, but they are in a major and incredibly slow development stage. This year, Clark Kent is finally performing more Superman actions, and Lex is finally an enemy to him. Jonathan Kent finally died, so that leaves the story open for Clark to turn to his real father: Jar-El for guidenece. Once again Clark did not turn into Superman. I figured the writers would have, or least turned Clark into Superboy because the newest Superman film is coming out this summer. It was just stupid that he wasn't turned because, true Superman fans will compare the film to this show and realize how much further the show could go if Clark finally becomes Superman and is moved to Metropalis. But that will probably only happen in the show's series finale. That's because Smallville is not really about Superman.

2598668,5,B000G1R4SO,"So much changes in the fifth season of Smallville that it is hard to comment on aspects of the season without spoiling it for those who have not seen it yet.

However, in the most general terms, Smallville continues as one of the most interesting fantasy shows on television.  A new character played by James Marsters of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" fame joins the cast.  He plays a professor at the college that Clark attends.  Of course, no one is who they appear to be in this tale.

Themes of loyalty and betrayal prevail.  As Clark, Lois and Chloe enter college and a new phase of life they must make harder decisions.  Lex continues to make choices that will separate him from his humanity and his  friendship with Clark Kent.  Clark continues to push away Lex and Lana, even though at times it seems he will reconcile with them.  Lois continues to be flip, curt and annoying.  It is interesting that not only Clark but most of the main characters seemed doomed to have no sex life--as if the assumed celibacy of this superhero is infectious somehow.

In general the season is darker and less hopeful than prior seasons.  Despite this it continues to fascinate and enthrall.",1150070400,108,1178,4.632850241545894
2598669,3,B000G1R4SO,"Smallville season 5 is an improvement over season 4. Of course that depends on your opinion of season 4, which I thought was a garbled mess that under-utilized the main players, threw in pointless mystical story arcs and generally stalled the series for a year. So I was quite pleased this year when Smallville finally seemed to get back on track. Many familiar elements of the Superman mythos are brought in this year, including the Fortress of Solitude, kryptonian supervillains, and a T-1000 version of Brainiac played to perfection by James Marsters. Clark and Lana finally hook up, Chloe graduates to the Daily Planet, and Lionel is given his best role in the series yet.

Then we come to the infamous 100th episode, with a character death. If you don't know who, I won't say. But it all seems done in a sudden, ratings-grabbing kinda way, with the cast member still prominently listed in the credits afterwards because the producers didn't plan well enough ahead to only contract them for half a season. And with that, season 5's momentum comes to a grinding halt. Lana ends up written as nothing more than a needy, trophy love slave. Clark is just plain unlikeable, so much so that the series' cliche of him busting into Lex's study and accusing him of something he may or may not have done becomes somewhat of an in-joke in the writing. Rosenbaum is still pretty good as Lex, but seems to be missing a few key steps in his transformation from good to evil. It's telling that the most interesting relationship isn't among the young adult cast, but between Martha and Lionel. It's the only thing in this show that still seems vaguely real.

The season ends with a compelling cliffhanger, capping off the standard Smallville season formula: horrendous character development + bland weekly stories + fanservice + good overall story arcs + awesome finale. Make of that what you will. There's definitely shows on television I respect more, but just the same you'll find me sticking around for season 6.",1149984000,12,2004,4.805797101449276
2598670,5,B000G1R4SO,"Season 5 of Smallville was one of the darkest seasons, and also one of the best. Thankfully, there is no crystals or withces or anything else like that. It gives REAL storylines, and alot thicker material. It's probably the best season yet. You should buy this if only for the 100th episode...so heartbreaking.

There was some bad things about this season though. As a hard core Clana fan (espicalley after watching Mortal), I was sad to see them go. I mean, I know he ultimately ends up with Lois Lane, but the show has always sort of centered the Clark and Lana relationship. Why didn't he just TELL her? *sigh*. Clark is so dumb sometimes. Poor Lana. Anyway, Lana was quick to move on and fall into the arms of Lex. See that really bothered me. No matter what he's done, BOTH of them would be six feet under like ten times if it wasn't for him. You can't do that to the guy. It's not right. Espicalley how neither apolgozies there just both, like, ""screw you"". Although I get where Lana's coming from. Anyway, Season 6 I don't hope they continue Clark and Lana, I just hope they make Lana and Lex a little more likeable.

Moving onto my next point...Lex is like turning into Lionel. And that bothers me. I know he's the villian but, still. COME ON! I did enjoy the mini fight Lex and Clark had, but I really liked that friendship...and it makes me sad to see it go. Lex is no longer my favorite charatcer.

There was a few bad episodes, although most were good: Fanatic and Lockdown felt like pure fillers leading up to the 100th episode. Cyborg and Fade- also not worth watching. Despite what anyone says I liked Thirst.

Don't get me wrong. This season did have some AMAZING episodes. Vessel and Reckoning- the hundred and season finale really make this season. Also great epsiodes include Mortal, Splinter, Lexmas, Void.

This season did have some great stuff going on. Chloe and Lex got their proper screen time. We get to watch the strangely corrupted Martha and Lana falling in with their Luther men. All in all, it's a great season. Buy it.",1149984000,6,2050,4.514824797843666

I want to start by expressing my enormous gratitude to the makers of SMALLVILLE for trying so hard to maintain the integrity of this fine show and by continually trying to make it quality entertainment.  I didn't like everything about Season Five and I'm sure others disliked some of the things I liked and liked some of the things that I didn't, but the fact is that the producers and writers are trying more now than ever to take the show to an interesting place.

Many fans of the show are upset with the Clark-Lana storyline, but I'm baffled as to why.  There was NEVER a chance that Clark and Lana were going to get together permanently.  There is this whole Lois Lane problem: this is a story in which we all know who Clark will end up with.  The only interesting issue has been why they would fail.  The reason has been building for several years, with Lana giving hints that she disliked ""otherness,"" which gives the lie to her late 5th century assertion to Clark that Lex's transformation into a superman of his own did not bother her.  On the other hand, Clark's persistent dishonesty and lack of candor to Lana continuously undermined any possibility of their having a close relationship.  Season Five is definitely the last season in which Clark and Lana will have had any kind of chance.  That was not just confirmed by their latest break up and her involvement with Lex, but by the enormously symbolic gesture of Clark's packing up of the telescope that he used in the Pilot to gaze at Lana from afar.

By any standard this was a content-heavy season.  Just a few of the highlights included Clark and Lana briefly becoming lovers; the appearance in Smallville of the mysterious Professor Fine aka Brainiac (wonderfully played by BUFFY and ANGEL's James Marsters aka Spike); Jonathan Kent running for state senate and winning, only to die of a heart attack; Martha Kent becoming senator after Jonathan's death; and the mystery surrounding Lionel Luthor and just what game he is playing.  In Season Four Chloe had discovered Clark's secret and now in Season Five Lionel has discovered it as well.  But incredibly, the difficult to figure Lionel actually has Clark's best interests in mind, neither revealing his secret or in any way attempting to manipulate him to exploit his powers.  The moment when Clark, who has suspected for some time that Lionel knew about him, uses his powers in front of Lionel for the first time is one of the finest images in the run of the show, as Clark catches a falling cage containing Lionel and Martha, his face only inches from Lionel's.

The only problem with Season Five was the same problem that has afflicted the show from the beginning:  the prevalence of too many weak individual episodes.  At its best, SMALLVILLE can be very, very good indeed.  The episode where Lex has his own version of IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE was one of the show's finest episode ever, as was the episode where Clark reveals his powers to Lana and asks her to marry him, only to turn back time courtesy of Jor-El after she dies.  And the episode mentioned above where a mysterious individual tortures Lionel and Martha is especially memorable.  All of SMALLVILLE's season finales have been memorable, and this year's was no exception, with the episode and season ending with all the major characters is dire peril.  As far as favorite moments go, one of mine was in the very first when Clark becomes aware that Chloe knows about his powers.  Their interplay throughout the season was great.  Oh, and the biggest shocker of the year:  Erica Durance + bikini.  She has to be the envy of everyone who was ever in BAYWATCH.  I found it humorous that several TV reviewers were inspired to comment on their shock how unexpectedly grand she appeared in a bathing suit.  In fact, with the debate about who should play Wonder Woman in the upcoming film under way, I will say that Erica Durance, a dark horse candidate at the moment, became my favorite.  It takes a very special individual to look anything other than silly in anything approaching the traditional Wonder Woman uniform.  Erica Durance is one of the few actresses on whom the outfit would be flattering.  She definitely has the physique.

Speaking of Joss Whedon (who is writing and directing WONDER WOMAN), the low point of the season might have been the painful episode that attempted to do homage to BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER.  That was my all time favorite series and one of co-executive producers on SMALLVILLE is Steven DeKnight, who was one of the main writers on BUFFY.  He wrote SMALLVILLE's Halloween episode, ""Thirst,"" in which Chloe tries to break a story about a sorority comprised of vampires.  The main vampire is Buffy Sanders.  Yeah, yeah, we all got it.  Buffy Summer.  Buffy Sanders.  Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  Buffy the Vampire.  But as if all this weren't heavy-handed enough, later in the episode when Clark was in the hospital, Professor Fine comes up to Clark.  After Clark tells him that his friend had been bitten by a vampire, the camera moves forward for a close up on Fine's face as the actor James Marsters, who had of course played one of the best known vampires ever on BUFFY and ANGEL, said, ""There's no such thing as vampires.""  Yuck, yuck, yuck.  I suspect they meant well and intended it as an affectionate gesture towards BUFFY, but despite DeKnight's best efforts, it just didn't work.

Nonetheless, overall this remained one of the best shows on TV and definitely one of the most underrated.  My own hope is that the show won't be on the air much longer.  I would really like to see them bring SMALLVILLE to an end next year and restart the next year as METROPOLIS.  They would be able to keep many of the same characters, but move things to the big city.  There isn't much left to do with Clark as a pre-adult.  The only powers left for him to acquire are flying-on-demand (as Clark puts it, Kal-El can fly, but Clark can't) and his freezing breath.  Beyond that he just needs to develop his sense of destiny, that he has a specific purpose.  Also, they need a shift in priorities away from Lana Lang towards Lois Lane.  Personally, I've always wished he could somehow end up with Chloe rather than either of the LL's.  But like I said at the start, we all know how this story ends.",1149984000,15,6336,4.65945945945946

8128524,5,B000G1R4SO,"I've been rewatching all of Smallville, and recently finished Season 5. I recently read that Smallville was kind of on the verge of being canceled after this season. Looking back, it's kind of surprising given how strong this season was. It starts out very strong with the Kryptonian invasion. Milton Fine, aka Brainiac, is the villain of the season. The season introduces Aquaman as it continues to add members of the Justice League. In ""Splinter,"" Clark has paranoid delusions as he's infected with silver kryptonite. There's an excellent Christmas episode here, ""Lexmas."" Cyborg is also introduced this year. The season finishes with ""Vessel,"" yet another fantastic season finale. I really enjoyed this season.",1513728000,,713,5.31858407079646
