1674933,5,B00005Y729,"I am a caregiver for my daughter who has CFIDS (Chronic Fatigue Immune Disfunction Syndrome).  This well made and fast moving documentary helped me understand what she is going through and what to expect in the future.  When she watched it, she felt understood and validated.  We have lent and given copies to many doctors, relatives, and friends who all have learned from it and appreciated our sharing it.
I highly recommend ""I Remember Me"" to anyone who has CFIDS (also called CFS) or is a caregiver, doctor, relative or friend of someone who has it.  It is a great tool for educating the public about this devastating and life destroying illness.",1215820800,3,650,4.776785714285714
1674934,3,B00005Y729,"This documentary is both a personal story of the experience of chronic fatigue by the documentary maker and an exploration of other people's experience of the disease and the response of the scientific and medical community to it in America. The documentary serves as an exercise in trying to understand the mysterious condition for the documentary maker as well as trying to explain it to others. There are a variety of different approaches adopted - stories from people severely struck with the disease, to doctors wholly sympathetic and wholly unsympathetic to the sufferers of the disease.

At its best points the documentary is a poignant study in some basic existential questions - health, dis-ease, perception, understanding, doubt, and care. However, the overall effect is a slightly scattered one - with no one aspect of the CFS puzzle given enough attention to make it wholly engaging. Perhaps one of the difficulties with this subject matter is the lack of coherence in the entity itself, making it difficult to generate a central thesis for a documentary about it. It does, however, raise interesting questions about the nature and response to the disease, and may well serve as an introduction to an understanding of CFS and its issues, though to more informed audiences it offers little new.",1202515200,,1305,5.098130841121495
1674935,5,B00005Y729,"I became aware of this documentary at a CFIDS conference I recently attended. I rented it immediately, and for the first time since I was diagnosed with CFIDS (about 3 months ago), I didn't feel alone. I had my mother watch it, and it helped her understand what I have been going through. I will be lending it to my family and friends, as it explains my new life better than I can. I highly recommend this documentary to anyone who is suffering from CFIDS or has a loved one with this misunderstood illness.",1179878400,5,507,4.404255319148936
1674936,5,B00005Y729,"This film conveys the frustration, confusion, the pain of no support that every person who suffers from CFS experiences.  It does it in a unique way that finally gives outsiders an intimate view of the life of CFS.  It shows the range of affliction and suffering.  Bravo, a fabulous tribute to all who have CFS.",1158710400,10,311,4.618181818181818
1674937,5,B00005Y729,"It is very hard to understand CFS from the outside looking in, but this is a good way to begin. Unlike books, the emotions that accompany this illness are expressed in such a way as to vibrate all the way into your soul.

I should make a technical note. The use of camera angles and shake may come off as gimicky. As a photojournalist I have no problem with the methods employed, but from my stand point as an editor whatever method you use, it has to work.",1056585600,21,457,4.193181818181818
1674938,5,B00005Y729,"How happy I was to find this most important documentary on CFIDS. I felt so grateful to Kim Snyder for making this film which, not only let me know I am not alone but, gave me a very good visual tool to educate my family,friends and colleagues who really don't get it. My husband and I were particularly struck by the testimony of one family member who related that, unless you live with a CFIDS sufferer you really have no idea.  The fact is that people only see us when we are having a good day and can get out of bed through the miracle of chemistry.  This is a must have film for all CFIDS sufferers.  Buy two!  One for you and one to lend out.  I only wish there were more than one film on this subject and that it were easier to find.",1036281600,35,740,4.041095890410959

A great video for anyone with CFIDS to acknowledge others with the same symptoms and problems.  A great video for friends and family of CFIDS patients, a brief overview of the illness. Fantastic for those who don't know what it is to suffer with this illness.",1034812800,18,357,4.650793650793651
1674940,5,B00005Y729,"Those of us who suffer from this disease can attest to the fact that part of the tragedy and suffering is caused by the lack of understanding which we face from those close to us and the medical community.  Make everyone important in your life watch this great movie.  If you are a victim of the disease, you will find comfort in knowing that you are not alone and you are not crazy.  We need more movies like this to bring awareness of the severity of CFS to the general public.  Then, possibly, more funding would be available for research.  Personally, I believe that CFS, Fibromyalgia, TMJ, IBS, MVP and a host of other ""vague syndromes"" are all just symptoms of one base disease.  I like to call it ""Devastation Disease"".",1033171200,23,726,4.5038167938931295
1674941,5,B00005Y729,"As a physician who has dedicated my career to treating patients with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and Fibromyalgia, I found I Remember Me to be a poignant, touching and true to life documentary.  Despite the fact that I see people on a regular basis who are disabled by the ravages of CFS, I still found the film to be simultaneously heart wrenching and hopeful, bringing tears my eyes several times.  Everyone should see this film. It is informative on many levels, not only just for those afflicted, but family and friends, as well as every medical professional and the general public.
Kim Snyder has made an outstanding contribution towards elevating the public awareness of this debilitating syndrome through her educational and informative documentary.  This is an important first step in alleviating the prejudices that these people to frequently encounter, not only by the public, but also frequently by medical professionals.  You can read about CFS all day long, but until you really get involved in the life of a patient with it, either directly or indirectly by letting Kim Snyder give you a glimpse, a true understanding is difficult to achieve.
Aside from the informational aspects of I Remember Me, the cinematography is creative and expressive.  Kim Snyder does more than just describe, define and date; she uses the film to let the viewer into her world, sharing the feelings, fears, and dreams of reality so frequently associated with chronic illness and shared by so many affected by CFS.  She reveals a great deal of how the experience of life with CFS can be altered in so many ways, from the mundane details of daily life, to the grand realization of lifelong dreams.  This is a very deep, personal expression of the journey patients with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome face.",1029369600,82,1786,4.973154362416107

Having lived with it for over a decade, I don't even think this would be helpful for others to understand. I would be peeved they wanted to subject me to it.",1474156800,,376,4.434782608695652

1674956,3,B00005Y729,"This is a good movie if you feel uncomfortable about a Chronic Fatigue Syndrome diagnosis.  It's supportive and would give information to doubting family members.  Sadly - and not the director's fault - there is little substantive information about CFS, so the same little bits that are known are repeated and some could have been eliminated.  I almost didn't make it to the end because it was so repetitive.  Please remember directors, our time is important and we hate to waste any.

The movie ends with the info that the CDC illegally transferred millions earmarked for CFS research to other research.  I'd love to see the director, or a designee, edit the movie and include more about that scandal.  Then the movie could really push for CFS support.  That money was earmarked for a reason - and that reason needs to be reaffirmed.",1466985600,,834,4.783216783216783

1674958,5,B00005Y729,It brings out what the problem is really about for those who suffer from this ailment. Unfortunately calling it Chronic Fatigue Syndrome made it the new carpal tunnel syndrome for anyone with the basic aches of a healthy normal life to complain to a doctor and collect disability.

I am giving this three stars because it's very outdated. I would love to see the author update. I haven't researched it yet but would like to know what ever happened to the lawsuit - CDC, updates on the patients, just general updates on research and what is going on with all of it now.

It took me 20 years living with chronic sometimes debilitating pain and trying to hold a full time job and raise three kids. Denied disability over and over. Finally this past year I have been taken seriously (only took a break down from exhaustion and severe pain) to be taken seriously. Now as more men are been diagnosed I was accepted for disability.

1674972,4,B00005Y729,"I know two people with CFS and for both of them, their lives were drastically impacted in a very negative way.  I think medical science just doesn't yet understand this disease and in some cases, blames the patient in one way or another.  This film highlights that attitude and sadly, that is one of the worst aspects of having this affliction is the lack of emotional support from the medical community.  It would be far better to say something like, ""we just don't know yet"" than to blame the patient or dismiss the patient's complaints.  The film also featured some medical doctors who have taken CFS seriously and want to see answers but in order for that to happen, the disease must be recognized as real, documented and then researched as to causes and possible treatments.  This film drew attention to the disease and the needs of those afflicted with it.",1453939200,3,862,4.682119205298013

I imagine how difficult it would be to understand this ""syndrome""  since there's such a long list of ailments that many are affected by in addition to the core symptoms that effect everyone. This film managed to touch so many connecting stories about CFS ,, one could easily produce another film. I'm incredibly angry and disgusted by the government's efforts to pass this epidemic off as a non relevant illness and deceive the American people with their lack of interest, bogus reporting, and finally fraudulent activity that was the worst slap in the face to all who have suffered from this illness.

It shows exactly  what every person affected by this disease (also similar to fibromyalgia) goes through, and how they are treated by the medical community. I kept shaking my head while watching this, because I could identify with all that was being described so truthfully and how even your close family can even think it's all in your head.

also, she should've let us know how those women from the 50s recovered their health and why did she mention the death of the soccer player? isn't she still alive?

i'm also disappointed that she didn't get into uncovering the crimes being done to us via the gov't, CDC, and pharma companies. she didn't once mention vaccines, chemical biowarfare experiments or chem trails. the only person who touched on the ""behind the scenes evil coverup"" in this was Dr. peterson when he said ""and that's the crux of it right there"". i got very ill after vaccines almost 20 yrs ago and haven't recovered...tho i'm not bedridden. some days i should be and most days can do very little except what needs to be done, like laundry, dishes, food prep. every day is a painful hell even tho i'm not bedridden and have to work part-time due to no support coming from disability. they first make us sick, then cover it up, then turn the tables and say it's all in our heads and then deny us medical answers or help and deny us financial help and leave us alone to figure it out while sick as well as make a living.",1423353600,,1383,4.440944881889764

I was also wondering/hoping for a tick bite correlation in any of the subjects. I've had erlichiosis tick disease and experience CFS symptoms. I was looking for so much more out of this documentary. It is an emotional journey of sorts documenting people's who lives were affected and even those that died from it. It did raise awareness of CFS, so for that alone, its a good thing. I too found it sort of vague. We know some of these people got better, like Michelle Akers, but how. That's the big underlying question.. HOW do people find and get proper treatment for CFS. Hopefully with more awareness and studies we'll get there some day. Interesting to read 13 million was channeled into funds by CDC when it was supposed to go to CFS Studies. The documentary says thats being investigated by Congress (This was in 2000 - wonder how it turned out). The one thing that struck a chord with me was Blake Edwards the director talking about going to the infectious disease head at Stanford.  That doc told him. We don't know what the hell you have!  Struck me because my doc had said the same exact thing after viewing my own odd lab tests.  He said your blood is doing something weird.

So I am thankful to see this film out there... and thank the producer for taking the time and making the effort and spending the money to try to inform more people of how horrid these illnesses really are.

I know some people have indicated they are upset over the use of the term CFS - but if you read allot... research allot... and not just singularly... the label on the disease you have been told or think you have... you will learn that ME/EBV/CFS/FM/MS -- share many many many commonalities/symptoms.

I fell ill with this disease 27 years ago - went into full blown remission for 20+ - changed careers - went back to college - owned Wellness Clinics trying to help others and did lots of Pro Bono Work... also became an Ordained Reverend... reaching out to others to help them heal.  I relapsed a few years ago because of Mega-Stress within the Family that resulted in a death.

I am now once again coming back out and within a year I hope to have a book out that is not trying to make money on some product or anything else but to share my Walk... my Healings... my Enlightenment with others in the Hope & Prayer I can help others in our ""Family"" [those who have this illness whatever name you want to give it] BE WELL & HAPPY ONCE AGAIN!

She missed the opportunity to tell even a little of his story; how he was misdiagnosed, mistreated and injured by the medical community. This could only have strengthened her position.

I bought this to educate some of my friends and family on my illness (in the early days, before I fully got that M.E. and 'CFS' are not at all the same thing) a bit more but having seen it now there's no way I'm ever letting them see it. Ever.

I hid my copy and the back of a drawer for years. I thought about selling it as it cost me a fair bit and money is tight, but decided that I just couldn't in good conscience, so I finally destroyed the tape and threw it out.

Avoid this one at all costs. It is cringe-worthy if you know patients with M.E., or any serious disease misdiagnosed as 'CFS' or know even a few facts about M.E. - and even if you don't!

Some real facts about M.E., almost none of which are mentioned in this 'CFS' video:

Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (M.E.) is a debilitating neurological disease which has been recognised by the World Health Organisation (WHO) since 1969 as a distinct organic neurological disorder. M.E. is classified in the current WHO International Classification of Diseases with the neurological code G.93.3.

M.E. can occur in both epidemic and sporadic forms, over 60 outbreaks of M.E. have been recorded worldwide since 1934. M.E. is similar in a number of significant ways to illnesses such as multiple sclerosis, Lupus and Poliomyelitis (polio). Earlier names for M.E. were 'atypical multiple sclerosis' and 'atypical polio.'

M.E. is an acute (sudden) onset neurological disease initiated by a virus infection (an enterovirus) with multi system involvement which is characterised by post encephalitic damage to the brain stem; a nerve centre through which many spinal nerve tracts connect with higher centres in the brain in order to control all vital bodily functions. This is always damaged in M.E., hence the name 'Myalgic Encephalomyelitis.'

M.E. has existed for centuries. The term M.E. was coined in 1956 and means: My = muscle, Algic = pain, Encephalo = brain, Mye = spinal cord, Itis = inflammation.

There are more than 60 different neurological, cognitive, cardiac, metabolic, immunological, and other M.E. symptoms. M.E. can be at least as disabling MS or polio, and many other serious diseases. M.E. is a chronic/lifelong disease that in some cases is fatal.

M.E. is a testable and scientifically measurable disease with a number of unique features. It is not difficult to diagnose, even within just a few weeks of onset, using a series of objective tests.

M.E. patients were treated appropriately and correctly diagnosed until around 1988, when there was an increase in the number of M.E. patients and outbreaks in the US. Some medical insurance companies (and others) decided that they would prefer not to lose many millions of dollars on so many new claims and so they created a new vague fictional disease category called 'Chronic Fatigue Syndrome' to try to confuse the issue of M.E. and to hide M.E. in plain sight.

Under the cover of 'CFS' certain vested interest groups have assiduously attempted to obliterate recorded medical history of M.E.; even though the existing evidence has been published in prestigious peer-reviewed journals around the world and spans over 70 years.

M.E. is a distinct, scientifically verifiable and measurable, acute onset, organic neurological disease. 'CFS' in contrast, is not a distinct disease. 'CFS' doesn't exist. Every diagnosis of CFS - based on any of the CFS definitions - can only ever be a misdiagnosis. A watebasket diagnosis.

The fact that a person qualifies for a diagnosis of 'CFS' (a) does not mean that the patient has M.E., and (b) does not mean that the patient has any other distinct illness named CFS.' M.E. and 'CFS' are not the same.

Far fewer than 0.5% of the population has the distinct neurological disease known since 1956 as Myalgic Encephalomyelitis.

Chronic Fatigue Syndrome is an artificial construct created in the US in 1988 for the benefit of various political and financial vested interest groups. It is a mere diagnosis of exclusion based on the presence of gradual or acute onset fatigue lasting 6 months. If tests show serious abnormalities, a person no longer qualifies for the diagnosis, as 'CFS' is 'medically unexplained.' A diagnosis of 'CFS' does not mean that a person has any distinct disease (including M.E.). According to the latest CDC estimates, 2.54% of the population qualify for a 'CFS' (mis)diagnosis.

The patient population diagnosed with 'CFS' is made up of people with a vast array of unrelated illnesses, or with no detectable illness. However, while 'CFS' is not a genuine diagnosis, those given this misdiagnosis are in many cases significantly or even severely ill and disabled. 'CFS' is made up of people with cancer, MS, Lyme disease, depression and hundreds of other unrelated conditions.

Sub-grouping different types of 'CFS,' refining the bogus 'CFS' definitions further or renaming 'CFS' with some variation on the term M.E. (such as 'ME/CFS') would achieve nothing and only create yet more confusion and help to continue and further entrench the mistreatment and abuse.

The problem is not that 'CFS' patients are being mistreated as psychiatric patients; some of those patients misdiagnosed with CFS actually do have psychological illnesses. There is no such distinct disease/s as 'CFS' - that is the entire issue.

Due to outrageous political influences on medicine and govermnent policy, the vast majority of M.E. patients will not be able to be correctly diagnosed with M.E. Most M.E. patients will unfortunately be misdiagnosed with 'CFS.' It is extremely important to note, however, that only a very tiny percentage of those told they have 'CFS' will be M.E. patients. The overwhelming majority of those misdiagnosed with 'CFS' do NOT have M.E. 'CFS' is NOT just another term for M.E.

The name Myalgic Encephalomyelitis must be fully restored (to the exclusion of all others) and the World Health Organization classification of M.E. (as a distinct neurological disease) must be accepted and adhered to in all official documentations and government policy. M.E. patients must again be diagnosed with M.E. and treated appropriately for M.E. based on actual M.E. research. For this to happen, there is a real need for patients (and others) to participate in genuine advocacy and activism.

The bogus disease category of 'CFS' must be abandoned. All those misdiagnosed with 'CFS' must immediately reject this harmful misdiagnosis and begin the search to find their correct diagnosis whether this be M.E., PVFS, depression, cancer, or any other disease. Correct diagnosis is vital in obtaining the correct treatment.

For more information on genuine M.E. read books and articles by genuine M.E. experts such as Dr Hyde and Dr Dowsett. This book should be avoided by M.E. patients and the 'CFS' misdiagnosed non-M.E. patient alike. None of us need the facts muddied even further, this only makes it harder for us all to start slowly getting well.

1675034,5,B00005Y729,"""I Remember Me"" was recommended to our family when my daughter was stricken with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and Fibromyalgia when she was 17 years old. The public has so many misconceptions of the illnesses that mostly ran contrary to her experiences.  No one understood what it was like to be in her body and this misunderstanding isolated her all the more.  Our original copy of ""I Remember Me"" was passed around to family and friends as a way for them to better separate the myths from the truths, and be a better support.  I had misplaced my original copy and so decided to buy a replacement as it is still a valuable learning tool.  I recommend also the video ""Tell Me Where it Hurts"" as an explanation to Fibromyalgia.",1310774400,4,722,4.573643410852713

1675036,5,B00005Y729,"This film expresses many of my own struggles with this immune system disorder, as well as the struggles of those dear friends I've met in CFS support groups. I am so grateful to those who are able to give voice to us who struggle in silence or who are too beaten down by the ongoing battle to recover, that we just can't take the fight to the next level. I became ill with flu-like symptoms in 1984 but the flu persisted in such a severe manner that I knew something was terribly wrong. After going to 22 different doctors within 5 years, one doctor diagnosed me with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and said there's nothing he can do, there is no treatment - but here, take these antidepressants. I continued working throughout all of this, fueled by extreme anger toward the medical profession...and continued working and trying to make the best of things for the next 20 years, though suffering such illness that only those who live with CFS can imagine the struggle. Living a life far below what I could have achieved if I had normal health. I spent all my salary from those 20 yrs of working, on alternative medical treatments...but there did come a day when my body completely and utterly collapsed and thus, I became disabled and plunged into poverty. I never gave up hope of finding treatment modalities that could offer an improved quality of life, but it was completely up to me to do the research and to keep asking my doctor if we could try this or that. And, like some of those in this documentary, I have endured more than my share of doctors who wanted to make me give up and never see another doctor. So, I want to say a big ""Thank You"" to those making this film, for myself, and for 3 dear friends I've lost to this immune disorder: Jhan, an executive in the radio & records industry who committed suicide at age 51 from discouragment with not being able to recover his health; Brad, a high-level federal gov't employee who committed suicide at age 47 after trying desperately to recover his health and being discouraged; and Susan, a beautiful artist, chef, and precious sister, who committed suicide at age 46 after years of desperately seeking to recover her health...these people fought a valiant fight and wanted more than anything to live.",1271462400,6,2255,4.598014888337469

1675039,4,B00005Y729,"Wouldn't it be nice if everyone viewed this documentary?  Medical students might take this cluster of illnesses seriously when at some point they meet a patient who presents with these baffling symptoms. Current doctors and nurses might know not to make truly ill informed and insensitive statements to those patients. Laypersons, everyday people, might realise what chronic fatigue syndrome (or whatever name people wish to call it) is when they see it in a stranger, friend or family member.  Or, heaven forbid, even in themselves.

I have suffered with this horrible and baffling illness for over 20 years now. It truly is awful. Words can't express what it is like.  Imagine having an illness that changes over time, yet remains the same in one aspect: it totally debilitates you and changes your life and ends the plans you once had.  ""I Remember Me"" is the perfect title, because while trapped in my bed, I have often thought, I remember what I used to be like. What happened?

I once was someone that people had great hopes for - and I was out there, energetic and achieving.  Suddenly even brushing my teeth was exhausting.  Some days I couldn't lift my arms to brush my hair.  I began having odd and roaming aches and pains.  Sleep disturbance.  ""Brain fog.""  On and on.  Chemical sensitivities.  Things that 'normal' people would not even notice, would devastate me physically.  Note, I said Physically.  This is not people's imagination. It is not a mental illness.  We are not 'depressed' - despite the devastation of the impact all this has on our lives.  People who have to deal with this must become resilient if only to avoid going insane.

Imagine being trapped in your room, in  your bed, for years on end - a rare outing might happen.  But it will require resting - meaning, not doing anything, even going onto the internet because even sitting can drain our energy. Resting for days or weeks before and after that outing.  Using all one's energy while out in public to stand straight and to walk at least at a pace that no one stares.  ""Normalcy"" even for those moments becomes very important.  Yet, ironically, it means being judged for being 'out of shape' or 'lackluster' - people read it as laziness or lack of interest.  If they only knew, inside we're screaming to lie down and sleep, we are that exhausted.  And yet the will inside is to do everything other people do.  This is not a disorder of the mind or will or personality.  IT IS PHYSICAL.

Please view this film and please know the person you are judging may have no other choice.  Don't tell them they just need to try harder.  I truly think this is a form of polio....Please someone find out what is wrong with us and help us.  Until then, pray for us, and don't judge.  Thank you for reading this.  Thanks to this film the first of its kind.  Now back to bed...",1256515200,13,2848,4.605577689243028

1675041,2,B00005Y729,"Although this was a very well-done, heart-wrenching film with interesting information regarding the history of chronic fatigue, I was very disappointed because I had hoped to show it to my family so they could understand what I am living with. Unfortunately, I could not because it wasn't representative of my symptoms. Nobody spoke about food sensitivities.  I also have insomnia, exercise intolerance, brain fog, joint pain, etc.

This film highlighted extreme cases of chronic fatigue and mostly those that began with a high fever, swollen lymph nodes, etc.  This is not the most common type of chronic fatigue now.  70% of fibromyalgia patients have it, along with fibromyalgia (as I do). It just cropped up with fibromyalgia.

I sincerely hope that the author, or someone else, can create a documentary that is balanced - with mild to severe versions and interviews with many individuals, asking questions like:

-How long have you had the illness?
-How did it start?
-What symptoms do you have?
-What is a typical day like for you?
-What is the most frustrating part of this illness?
-What do you wish your friends and family could understand?
-What have you done that has helped your symptoms the most?

These types of questions, along with some of this DVD, would be coveted by the chronic fatigue syndrome population at large.  It would be wonderful if someone as talented as Kim Snyder could take this on...  :-)",1234396800,10,1422,4.9411764705882355

Best Explained--> HIV is an innocent passenger in a hi-jacked car. You cannot deny its presence, but HIV wasn't ""the cause"" of the crime. The reasonwhy most HIV+ people remain perfectly healthy, for decades, is because HIV requires a *co-factor* to accelerate. These co-factors of AIDS are the very same undiagnosed causes of CFS.
