8536342,5,B0095Y3YKK,"Berlin Tunnel (Richard Thomas)

I originally saw this in 1981 when it first aired on TV at CBS.

I always said one day the Berlin Wall will come down and Germany will be reunited and finally it happened. It was such an unnatural division and should have never have happened.

The Movie is excellent. Anyone who loves Germany and Loves Berlin will love the movie. Others will love the movie too.

I have so much respect for Richard Thomas for doing this movie.

Warning -- It has a sad ending.",1410480000,,492,4.4222222222222225

This stated, as of 5/14, TGG DIRECT is the only DVD mfr. to offer a dub of A TIME OF DESTINY.

.
In a potboiler drama loosely based on Verdi's ""La Forza del Destino,"" San Diego's wealthy Larraeta family is a study in dysfunctionality. Patriarch Jorge (Rabal) rules with an iron fist. Oldest daughter Margaret (Channing) lives in her father's house with husband Ed (Coffin), much to the old man's disapproval and their misery. Beloved Jorge Jr. is dead, memorialized by a photo and ever-burning candle. Estranged first son Martin (Hurt) was ostracized for trying to sell dad's ranch when temporarily put in charge of it. Family baby but wise beyond her years, Irene (Follows) is saddened by so many things that are beyond her control.

Favorite child, middle daughter Josie (Leo) elopes with Army enlistee Jack (Hutton), a man of small prospect. An angry Jorge comes to their wedding night hotel and with a threat of disownment forces Josie to return home with him. Jack follows; both cars race down a dark road in a driving rain. Jack slows down but Jorge continue to speed. His vehicle goes off a wooden bridge and sinks in a bog. After jumping in after them, Jack is only able to rescue his bride.

Martin arrives at the hospital and is told of the events that led to his father's drowning. He gets a good look at his new brother-in-law and swears revenge against him. Jack's unit is sent to Italy; Martin begs his commanding officer for a transfer there and he ends up a corporal in Jack's platoon. We see his demented slow burn and wonder when Martin will attempt to fulfill that vow of vengeance.

A perhaps unconscious nod to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sergei-Eisenstein/dp/6305908753/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sergei Eisenstein</a>'s rapid-cut editing technique occurs during one jarringly effective war sequence that consists of three separate scenes spliced together in split-second bites. Other WWII Italian Campaign scenes are expertly mounted and the family drama well-acted. Weakest link is William Hurt's failed attempt to portray the psychopathic black sheep, a hard-to-believe villain that spoils an otherwise superior picture. At times his imagined nemesis, Timothy Hutton also isn't convincing, with feeble grins meant to indicate fealty toward a man he doesn't know is planning to kill him.
