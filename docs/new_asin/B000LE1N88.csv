2707953,5,B000LE1N88,Everything is perfect. I got exactly what i wanted. I would buy from again. Thanks,1221350400,,82,4.533333333333333
2707954,2,B000LE1N88,"This video is just too fast-paced. I've done (and like) other power yoga videos which are not slow, but this is almost aerobics, no holding of any pose at any time.
You do break a sweat for sure though, but I'd rather then just go for a run...",1215475200,4,243,4.083333333333333
2707955,4,B000LE1N88,"I just got into doing yoga 3-4 times a week during the last 6 months, and I bought this and 2 other dvds to use while my teacher is on a summer retreat.

This workout is quite challenging, and always leaves my heart pounding and my entire body covered in sweat!  Like the some of the other reviewers, I liked that Adrienne has a choice of a 20, 40, or 60 minute workout on the tape.  I also like that the folks on the video all look like regular people and not like hardcore yogis (which is nice for someone like me who is trying to get back into shape!)

Even though Adrienne is a bit more like an aerobics instructor than a mellow yogi, I like the workouts that she has put together, and that she enhances a lot of traditional yoga positions with some other non-yoga movements to keep your heart rate going.  This is definitely not for someone who hasn't worked out at all in a while, or who doesn't know any yoga at all--I think it would be way too challenging for a total novice to keep up with.

The things that I didn't like about this tape are that Adrienne doesn't participate in the workouts, but rather just walks around and directs her students.  This isn't a bad thing, but since I'm always working on trying to improve my poses, I like to see people doing yoga who really know what they're doing.

In addition, for the first 5-8 minutes of the dvd, there are commercials for Adrienne's merchandise, and you cannot skip through it.  That is EXTREMELY annoying, especially for someone who wants to use this tape many times.

The one weird thing about this tape is that in the ""bonus features"" section, you see Adrienne by herself in the studio, doing some advanced yoga positions, but it doesn't seem meant for you to follow along--she does it without talking and there's no explanation.  It goes on for about 5 minutes and then just ends.  Kind of strange, I think.",1213574400,8,1877,4.393063583815029
2707956,4,B000LE1N88,"This yoga CD is OK. Not very different from many of the others I already have, like Bryan Kest, Baron Baptiste etc. Too many sun salutations. I just hate them! Maybe I just get frustrated when every yoga DVD opens with 25 sun slutations.
What I do like is her way of teaching and the fact that the three people in the background are just normal people.",1208649600,7,352,4.268656716417911
2707957,4,B000LE1N88,"I get a good sweat going with this DVD.  There are three routines depending on how much time you have.  The 60 minute is very challenging as the poses get harder; lots of balancing.  My only disappointment with the DVD--there is a ""bonus"" feature, but it isn't extra instruction if you want to really ramp it up.  It's just Andrea demonstrating her prowess.",1203811200,,357,4.619047619047619
2707958,5,B000LE1N88,"I was going to rate this a ""4"" because the yoga instructor (Adrienne Reed) doesn't have that ""mystical-spiritual-yoga guru thing"" going on -- she's more like a peppy work out instructor.  However, this dvd is such a dang good workout that I had to give it 5 stars.  What I really like is that there are 3 separate workouts -- 20, 40 and 60 minute workouts -- and each one is a different workout.  Also, there is a lot of upper body and ab work involved (attention women with wimpy upper bodies!  This one will fix that).  The svasanas (relaxation phase) are good, too (I guess that would be the ""spiritual"" part) and they are separate/in addition to the workout, so a given workout is not 40 minutes INCLUDING the svasana, it's 40 PLUS a 5 or 7 minute svasana (or 20 minutes or 60 minutes).

If you are looking for good ""workout"" yoga, I recommend this dvd.",1196899200,11,857,4.3924050632911396
2707959,1,B000LE1N88,"Unfortunately, I could only do the workout once as Adrienne Reed's voice drove me crazy!!  I just couldn't listen to it!!

Sorry",1194998400,2,128,4.7727272727272725
2707960,5,B000LE1N88,"This DVD is excellent if you are into an athletic, non-meditative, power vinyasa yoga. Adrienne is very generous and provides a 20, 40 and 60 minute separately unique workouts which are not a cut and paste of each other. The set is inside in a very professional, slick, attractive studio setting. There are 3 people doing the workout (2 women and 1 man) and they don't have perfectly tiny svelte bodies which is refreshing, though they are very strong. She leads the practice and I find her approach stimulating and encouraging, she's definitely bootcamp. You are going to get a sweating workout!  This is not a beginner workout by any means. This is full vinyasa power yoga. She does focus alot more on the upper body strength than a balanced upper/lower body stretch and strengthening. If you want a fast track to a strong upper body for chatarunga's this is it! You will do them slow, fast, one-legged, holds, you name it! Even though you do get legwork, there is not a variety of leg work in this DVD--Warrior 1's, Warrior 2's (I think), Warrior 3, Side Angle and twisted sideangle. The leg work she tends to do in workout sets which is a bit different. Rather athletic than yoga. You have to be very careful to move in and out of them smoothly or you can set yourself up for injury. And, she always ends on the floor for abs and stretching to round it off. On the whole an excellent DVD if you want an athleticly vigorous power type yoga!",1184284800,21,1443,4.50763358778626
2707961,5,B000LE1N88,"Normally I do not like Power Yoga but Adrienne Reed has done a great job with this workout.  Not saying it is the easiest workout but I feel great at the end of it.  It has a 20-40-60 minute segment choice; so if you are short of time or your energy level is low you can pick a shorter time. If you are a yoga student or teacher, I say go for it!",1166659200,10,346,3.7260273972602738
8161767,5,B000LE1N88,Received as promised. Good Seller.,1411344000,,34,6.0
8161768,5,B000LE1N88,"Good 20, 40, 60 minute workouts - each build on prior workout.  Perfect if you have only 20 minutes but want a vigorous yoga practice; super if you have more time!",1384473600,,163,4.258064516129032
8161769,5,B000LE1N88,"I purchased Adrienne Reed's Power Yoga: Fat Burner DVD after DISH took her daily program off the air until December of this year.  She is absolutely the best instructor for older, beginning yoga students and even my 15-year-old gets a work-out with this DVD.  I started yoga 5 months ago with Ms. Reed's tv series and fell in love with it.  I have more strength, am better toned overall, and no longer wheeze walking up the stairs.  I have all of her DVDs and strongly recommend that you get them while you can.",1381190400,,511,4.462365591397849
8161770,5,B000LE1N88,Really enjoy Adrienne Reed's DVD Power Yoga. The moves are easy to follow and well illustrated. Looking forward to many more exercise sessions using her program!,1380499200,,161,5.230769230769231
8161771,5,B000LE1N88,"Folks, let's be clear, here. Adrienne Reed is a yogi, but she comes to teach from a very defined place--one in which she combines elements of aerobics, pilates, and traditional yoga. It is not a traditional ""aerobic"" video, nor is it a traditional ""yoga"" video. Instead, it is a blend of the two, and one is both costantly moving and also prompted to take advantage of the (very) short breaks offered throughout. Honestly, it feels like interval training through yoga, which i really like.

The reviews that state it's got too many sun salutations may not be aware that sun salutations are the base move for yoga, and almost all Power Yoga movements flow through it.
The reviews that critique it for being too ""aerobic"" in instruction style-- um, hello? It's called ""FAT BURNER!""

The result is a dynamic blend that's low impact and incredibly rewarding to practice. I've only been doing the video for a week, but the variety in both workout--length and movement, between the 20, 40, and 60 minute segments--is incredibly rewarding. They are 3 distinct workouts, and I greatly appreciate that they are actually DIFFERENT workouts.

You will sweat. You will have a challenge maintaining balance and stamina, and you will increase your flexibility--all while gaining body awareness.

The students in the videos perform the poses well, with both strength and grace, and they seem to have been chosen to demonstate that people do not need to have a perfect figure to perform yoga well. In fact, that's probably the reason Adrienne doesn't participate as often in the videos. She's keen on supervising--which is a great way to teach. Her primary emphasis is that of ""teacher,"" not video model.

She's very clear about what to pay attention to within your body (and mind) in order to ensure that you are performing the pose correctly. This verbal instruction is incredibly helpful as I move quickly between poses.

I cannot recommend this practice for a beginning yogi or for those who cannot perform a Sun Salutation with some degree of comfort. Familiarity with yoga makes this DVD enjoyable, but, if I were a newbie, I'd probably be incredibly frustrated. All that being said--in this video, you're encouraged to STOP if you feel any pain or troubling discomfort and to work at your own pace.",1364428800,,2289,4.917098445595855
8161772,5,B000LE1N88,"Doesn't disappoint one bit. If you're a beginner, no worries. Start slowly and build up. She is my fav instructor on Dvd. She's clear and explain things very well. I love this!",1362355200,,176,4.53125
8161773,4,B000LE1N88,"Start with Sharon Mann's videos and work your way up. May be valuable, but not a starting point, that's for sure!",1357171200,,113,4.428571428571429
8161774,1,B000LE1N88,I thought this workout would be a little more intense than usual but this was way over the top. It makes you really hate plank.,1354492800,,127,4.12
8161775,5,B000LE1N88,"This DVD includes 3 completely different workouts, each of them challenging in their own way.  They all use sun salutes to warm up, but each workout uses it in a different way.  I appreciated the creativity and the challenge.  I like Adrienne Reed as an instructor because she is very straightforward, and describes each movement thoroughly, with good cueing before something new is about to happen.  I am not into the meditative, chanting part of yoga, just a nice, hard workout, and I love this one.",1244764800,3,501,4.790697674418604
8161776,5,B000LE1N88,"While I find the instructor mildly annoying, I LOVE this workout. She covers all parts of the body, so that you feel  great afterward. I have a couple of her DVDs, along with several other instructors, that I rotate through. I am always happy when I get to this one.",1222992000,,266,4.32
