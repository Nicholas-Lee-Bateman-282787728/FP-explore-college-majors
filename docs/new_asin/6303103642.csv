7838363,2,6303103642,"Ma and Pa Kettle at the Fair, 1951 film

Mail arrives at the Kettle home; there is comedy. Rosie gets a college catalog, but she is going to work instead when she finds a job. [Their home is well-furnished.] Pa needs a new horse to work the farm. A minor accident gives Pa an idea. Watch Pa haggle over a horse! Eggs are given in payment. There is verbal humor. In church Pa Kettle speaks from his heart. Watch that collection plate! Ma enters the jam contest. Crabapple plum wins. Ma is disqualified on a technicality. Genuine Indian Electric Blankets for sale! Win a cuckoo clock by hitting a clown? The Kettles plan to race their used horse Emma. Can an Indian Medicine Man help? A rattle sets Emma off! [Long shots suggest a stunt double.]

Watch Pa bargain for a sulky. Mas bread doesnt turn out right. Marvin takes Rosie to the Fair. Watch how Ma keeps a secret. Ma wins $150 in the bread contest, but it pays their debts. The next morning two horses are sick; this affects the odds. The harness race begins. Pa shakes that charm, the rattle sends Emma to the front. Would a win affect the town? A slingshot causes Emma to break her trot and lose. The Sheriff arrests Pa for feeding that spoiled bread to the horses. People are upset at this. Billy Reed explained what the Kettles did to save the towns money. Birdie gives her winnings to Ma. A business wants to sell Mas jam in stores. There is a happy ending.

A good movie needs a good story; this is at best average (but has some comic scenes). It shows small town life as seen by Hollywood, before television put carnivals and fairs out of business, then movie theaters later.",1504656000,,1637,4.413907284768212

7838366,5,6303103642,"It was the film THE EGG AND I (1947) in which the MA and PA KETTLE first appeared in a film.  Someone got a smart idea and decided two years later to give them there own film series. The next film was simply titled, MA AND PA KETTLE (1949), followed by MA AND PA KETTLE GO TO TOWN (1950), MA AND PA KETTLE BACK ON THE FARM (1951), and this MA AND PA KETTLE AT THE FAIR (1952).  The video starts out with animated ""Preview Pete"" giving you a sneak preview trailer of the movie you are about to see.  The beginning of the film is the mailman trying to put some mail in the Kettles mailbox, sort of simular to the ""BLONDIE "" film series.  The County Fair is here again and Ma is going to be stiff competition in the Bread & Jam event like she did in THE EGG AND I (1947) (they lived on the poor farm then). I like this film because it really has that small town feeling, back to a simpler time.  The way towns should be.
  Wait until you hear Pa speak in the church.  The Kettles also try to figure out a way to send Rosie to college.
  That is actor James Best as ""Marvin Johnson"".
 The next film in the series is MA AND PA KETTLE ON VACATION (1953), the following films are: MA AND PA KETTLE AT HOME (1954), MA AND PA KETTLE AT WAIKIKI (1955), THE KETTLES IN THE OZARKS (1956), and the last THE KETTLES ON OLD MACDONALD'S FARM (1957).",1050192000,6,1333,4.030418250950571
7838367,3,6303103642,"During the course of the Kettle films, there are a few character traits that are written in stone.  Pa appears lazy, but has a penchant for winning things....just enough to keep his family ahead.  So when big things come  up, like a college education, events such as the fair provide opportunity.  However, by this time Pa has won a house and a trip for two to New York  City.  Perhaps this plot is getting thin by the time it is used in this  film.  Also, to this point, Ma has been hard working, but never rewarded.  This film attempts to fix this by bringing these ideas together.  Ma wins  money to help send a daughter to college through her work and talents  making jam and quilting.  Unfortunately, this film doesn't flow as well as  some of the other Kettle adventures, though there is a wealth of screwball  comedy and veiled social commentary to keep one entertained.  Pa's  ""assistance"" with Ma's breadmaking is worthwhile, and is an  effective use of the ""slippery slope"" type of humor common to  this genre of film. Overall, I'd say worth seeing, collect them all.  Better than MacDonalds Farm and In the Ozarks, but probably #7 of the 10.",962409600,7,1152,4.58128078817734
