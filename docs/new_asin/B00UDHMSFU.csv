7036268,4,B00UDHMSFU,"Another excellent film out of Korea.  If you like Korean action flicks, this should certainly be on your list of films to watch.

I had no problems with the English subtitles.  They were timed just fine while I watched.  There might have been a couple of misspelled words, but that was about it.

My only complaint with the movie is that perhaps it actually started ""too fast""?  It took me about a good 30 to 45 mins into the movie before I could actually identify who all the main characters were ( ie, who is from NK, who is from SK, and other agencies, etc... )...

Either way, you can expect loads of action, plot twists, potential betrayals, etc...  Great flick, and highly recommend.",1516406400,,689,4.5

7036272,5,B00UDHMSFU,"Excellent  Foreign espionage film! will have you on the edge of your seat !
Female and male lead both stronge leads, scenery of berlin was stunning, dialong
and guessing whats coming next spot on.

however, unfortunately, the English subtitle is prob only about 85% complete
and the timing is off. So I would maybe consider watching it elsewhere or
only if you are fluent in Korean.",1505001600,,382,4.7727272727272725
7036273,2,B00UDHMSFU,"FORMAT: Streaming rental.

I would rate 5 stars except this is the worst subtitle job I've seen, and this is also the first time I've ever said something along those lines. Often I see others say similar things in reviews and after watching feel that they were unjustified in their critique, but in this movie there would be, say, six lines of dialogue between two characters, and only four lines would be translated but awkwardly timed to last the whole exchange. It makes it difficult to track who is saying what at times. It didn't start being noticeable until a little way in, after 40 min or so. Seems like someone just got lazy. Seriously disappointing flaw in an otherwise stellar film. If my immersion were not ruined for the obvious exchanges of dialogue not translated, I would've rated 5 stars certainly. I'd say take the chance, if you're a fan of these sorts of films. If you're on the fence, the subtitles did make me regret my rental.",1504915200,,949,4.615384615384615

8705481,4,B00UDHMSFU,"While it is hard to miss the cold war, having grown up in the 70's and 80's, I do miss the movies based on it. This movie scratches that itch quite nicely, The Berlin location adds a nice cold war sense of place as well, although from a westerner's perspective, they didn't make exceptional use of the location (good, not exceptional). Some good, if maybe overlong at times, extended action scenes. A few twists. I can't rate it five stars because I am certain I will have forgotten about it in a month, but good entertainment. Crack a bottle of soju and enjoy.",1516406400,,561,4.456310679611651
