8627490,5,B00GTWLMU0,Great movie. Funny. Loved the revenge for societal etiquette misdeeds. Kathleen Turner is excellent and plays a June Cleaver type mother who exacts revenge on those who don't use proper protocol for not doing what is etiquette correctness. Mink Stole was great as an upset woman keeps receiving harassing calls. Overall the movie was wonderful. Recommend it!,1466985600,,358,5.298245614035087
