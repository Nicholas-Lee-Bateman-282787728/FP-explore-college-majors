6307612,2,B00IZZDZFE,"This movie was gawd awful. Please don't waste your money. The only reason I went for it to start with was it starred Billy Zane, and lesser known Lacey Chabert, but both are talented actors. I thought with Zane on board the movie had to be legit. Which is why I cannot believe they took part in this horribly done, b-horror flick that tried every angle in the book to try to save itself. The whole thing with Charles Manson and the manson family flashbacks with atrociously bad wigs and clothes (and acting), was finally the end of me taking the movie serious at all. I couldn't seem to make myself stop watching it though, like a bad train wreck I was fixated.",1404691200,,661,4.382113821138211
6307613,1,B00IZZDZFE,"OMG! Really? I spent money on this?  Billy Zane?  I hold no criticism of the acting in this film. (I do, But...)
I can tell it was poorly constructed.  It lacked pace and the scenes weren't blocked very well. If it was supposed to be tongue-in-cheek.  it missed the mark.  Most of all, I am growing weary of poorly filmed low budget horror.  It is sold to us as quality work.  From the misleading reviews to the misleading thumbnail artwork, these low budget, low quality, craprtacular horror films are ripping us off.",1404604800,,518,4.565217391304348
6307614,5,B00IZZDZFE,"Alan (Billy Zane) is the director of a low budget indie production. The editing of the film is set in a studio located in a haunted house. One of the scenes has to be reshot which requires the dancers to come back.

The ghost scenes were done very well, but the dry one liners spouted by Billy Zane kept this film from having a great scare factor, instead it had a decent comedy value. While this film was in no way a spoof, it did seem to spoof the genre in general.

The worse part of the film was it didn't tie in to the woman's warning that ""childish games can turn ugly."" There was an implication there was a hide and seek game turned bad, but that was not the case as childish games were never part of the flashbacks or the film. They needed to tie that together, but didn't bother. In spite of that, this one is a keeper.

F-bomb. Nudity.",1402704000,8,845,4.140243902439025
6307615,4,B00IZZDZFE,"If you enjoyed Billy Zane's over the top performance in ""The Mad"" (as I) you will enjoy this immensely. Campy with jump scares. The only drawback is that Richard Tyson should have had more of a prominent role. Decent acting with the always lovely Lacy Chabert. Blu ray format..please.

**The only reason I gave it 4 and not a 5 is because it not on Blu Ray format and there are no extras..pretty bare bones**",1402358400,,408,4.44

6307621,4,B00IZZDZFE,"I went into this movie not expecting much. I read the reviews and watched the trailer noteing Danielle Harris. After seeing she was in the movie I knew I HAD to watch it even if it was super cheesy.
YES...It is VERY cheesy, I watched it like I would a spoof movie and it was freaking awesome! There are some parts where you are cracking up laughing cause of some pf the stupid things said. The girls were cute as well as the guys (most of them anyways), the CG was decent, there is A LOT of blood, you can tell it's fake but they use it like it will dry up tomorrow! There are a few jump out at you moments but that had me wondering when the next one will be (i'm a HUGE adreanlie junkie!)

Anyway, it deserves it. The ghost is legitimately creepy, the cast had great chemistry, and it was actually really funny. It's a little slow to start and it's campy. Just go into the movie understanding that and you will enjoy it.",1442361600,,293,4.634615384615385

6307649,3,B00IZZDZFE,"Good film as far as Prime goes. I enjoyed the horror aspects. The comedy, so called, was more like a tension breaker; the FX were not too bad, but overall it did have some jump elements.

6307652,3,B00IZZDZFE,"This was a pretty good horror film. A little predictable here and there, but enough twists and turns with a back story to make it interesting enough. Had a couple good actors. The last scene was kind of stupid and unnecessary, it was the predictable big ""shocker"" at the end. If you are looking for a horror/slasher film that will keep you on the edge of your seat , try this one.",1430611200,,380,4.291666666666667
6307653,1,B00IZZDZFE,"I actually like Billy Zane's delivery and dry humor, and to some extent I was figuring this movie was really making fun of itself, which in turn allows one to overlook faults in the movie.  I had to run it off as the wit of some of the lines couldn't overshadow how bad the film is

These type of scare tactic horror films are more comedy than horror, but when it gets so bad, its just plain disappointing",1430179200,,405,4.17948717948718

6307657,4,B00IZZDZFE,"I enjoyed this movie. I thought most of the acting was above average for this type of movie. I always liked Danielle Harris, Lacey Chabert and billy Zane and all three are fun to watch in this movie. The actress that plays the main diva is really pretty, and I thought the ghost girl was kind of creepy in how she would make people commit suicide. Special effects were decent, but nothing spectacular. Also was not sure why they did not just bring the one character in sooner to talk to the ghost if that was  all that was needed to be free from the whole mess. I also thought that the movie ran at a pretty good pace, a little in the middle dragged on but nothing major.",1428624000,3,671,4.2015503875969
6307658,3,B00IZZDZFE,"This movie is definitely ""campy"" but it is fun and worth a view if you like some comedy thrown in with your horror.  It all takes place in pretty much one location, a house and movie studio and isn't terribly creative, however, Billy Zane is hilarious and the movie is definitely fun to watch if you don't set your expectations too high.",1428537600,,337,4.435483870967742

If you are looking for something to make you laugh, this is it. I didn't find it to be scary, but I did laugh really hard at some points.
A ghost is haunting a house where a production company is set up shooting a tacky music video. Shout out to Billy Zane for being hilarious through this movie.
There are so many inconsistent moments, but all that aside, just watch it for fun. Don't expect to be scared.",1427846400,,442,4.273809523809524

6307669,1,B00IZZDZFE,"I don't think the writers could decide what genre they wanted - horror, thriller, dark comedy, parody, soft core porn, sitcom - we'll just throw it all in there and make some up as we go! Sprinkle a little bad acting, terrible puns and inconsistent character personalities and voila! Perfect! Right? Maybe. If you like barely average. A for effort; 1 star for time waster.

I liked the grandma, though. She deserves a better role. My title is for her.",1424822400,,451,4.6375

However, I will agree, if he wasn't in the scene, it was definitely boring.  I wouldn't watch it again, but it did make me laugh on an otherwise dreadful day.  Viewers will recognize scenes from the Frighteners, the Ring, and Young Frankenstein, to name just a few.  It was fluff, but funny fluff.",1424217600,,404,4.605633802816901

6307672,5,B00IZZDZFE,"This is by far one of the best horror/comedy films I have ever seen.  Billy Zane makes the movie by playing his usual quirky dude but one with actual heart. ""Be careful, she tends to go down easy."" And, no, that's not a sexual comment!  I liked that one of the newer 'scream queens' Danielle Harris is in this one and she makes a great counterpart to Lacey Chabert.  I won't summarize the movie since that's been done over and over, just give a few opinions on it's many good points and few negative ones.  The dialogue is smooth, natural, and downright funny.  The cameral work is good, smooth, not shaky, and fluid.  The lighting and audio are spot-on through out the film with no too dark spots or places you can't hear or that blow your eardrums.  The set is believable and doesn't look like a cheesy low budget set with pristine walls and such...it really does look like a fifties rancher remodeled into offices.  I enjoyed the witty tongue in cheek dialogue and the couple of zingers the old lady gets are hilarious...""I have a key.""  The cheesy parts were meant to be cheesy especially the Muscle Milk promos, but the scary bits are actually pretty jump worthy as well.  On the negative side, a couple of allusions Thelma made were never explained such as ""childish games"" and why Carly hated doors.  That was irritating.  And the ending, the actual ending and not the false credit start one, was superfluous.  The guy playing Mr. Kardashi at the very end is the writer and director so maybe he just felt it needed something more, perhaps a way to show that Alan kept his word, but the realtor was the only truly hokey part of the movie but unfortunately it's the last shot we see.  Now for the obvious white elephant in the room...uhm, how to put this?  Well, Daddy is still living right, so does he have any rights as far as this kind of thing goes?  I mean, I know he is mentioned in a million movies and shows but this is the first one I've ever seen where he is an actual character in the movie. Of course, as crazy as he is, he probably would love it if he ever saw it but still...whatever, for those of us who know that sordid story well, and for myself having seen many of his crazy monologues during parole hearings, his addition made this so much more fun and creepy and actually made me wonder if he does have kids out there.  I mean, he did get around!  Anyway, I loved this movie and will probablly end up buying it so I do recommend it.  If you don't know who Carly's daddy is, look him up and you'll see why it adds so much to the movie.",1423094400,,2559,4.315899581589958
6307673,4,B00IZZDZFE,"Ok, this movie was just awesome, really. After reading the reviews, I expected a  low budg, maybe slightly better than average horror film, but this was a treat. Billy Zane's character was wonderfully shallow and amusing and, moreover, believable. A couple of pretty decent surprises and twists and some good goriness for hardcore horror fans. You have to keep tongue in cheek and take this movie as (I think) it was meant, comedy first with some scary features. Additionally, for true film geeks, there is some amazing cinematography in this film. I have seen ""serious"" horror films that were not shot this well. Definitely worth watching---I would even watch this again.",1422748800,,672,5.054054054054054
6307674,5,B00IZZDZFE,"Excellent CGI is used sparingly and to good effect. The problem that the guy is still alive was mostly ignored, but it really didn't take away from the picture.

6307675,4,B00IZZDZFE,"Billy Zane did a great job keeping this black comedy going.  There wasn't anything special about the story of a ghost that is upset because it's house is getting sold and torn down.  Billy's character is a guy who gets dragged into things he desperately does not care about and wants to ignore because he just wants to get the property sold.  As events progress, Billy's character copes with the chaos with dripping sarcasm and he does a great job making it work.  There's also some good subtle humor I'd like to tell you about but don't want to give the punchlines away.",1421020800,,571,4.514563106796117

They chose very decent actors and even though I thought some of the special effects were a little cheesy, I still thought that overall,  the movie was great. I really liked this! I also liked that half of the cast wasn't killed off. I do wonder what the issue was with the doors? The little girl didn't like doors but it never explained why(unless I missed it). I wouldn't mind seeing deleted scenes or alternate endings. I'm guessing if there are any, it would explain a few more things.

6307685,3,B00IZZDZFE,"It's nice to see another Billy Zane movie. This movie is low budget and explores the idea of evil being passed from parent to child. It's not a new concept but it is a ghost story with a very angry ghost and tongue planted firmly in cheek.

At first it seems like it will be a calamity like so many others, but this one really works as the plot progresses.

The acting is good and feels natural. The resolution and surprise ending are a real shocker.
You can relate to the actors in a very natural matter-of-fact sort of way; the situation/premise is completely reasonable and believable.

6307692,5,B00IZZDZFE,"This movie is another one of those that runs a fine line between a good movie and a bitter disappointment.  Dialog plays an important role in any film.  The choice of words for each actor and how they deliver those lines can make all the difference.  I've seen many movies that use too much dialog to describe the action instead of allowing the film to play out with body movement.  The fewer words the better.  I am happy to say this production lands on the side of good cinema.  I enjoyed the scary presentation of the ghost.  I don't get surprised often (I've seen too many horror films for that to happen.), but this time a mirror scene with the ghost popping up; caught me off-guard.  The actors had the right inflection in their voices.  The dialog wasn't too corny or too over-acted.  This film accomplished what many others fail to do.  It mixes camera angles, dialog, and good actors to create a scary movie worth your time.",1416873600,,933,4.494047619047619

6307704,3,B00IZZDZFE,"I was first going to give GOGL 3 stars, but it's better than ""It's Okay.""  I like to watch these schlock B horror flicks while I'm working on various projects in my shop.  It's just something in the background.  Once in awhile, a movie comes along that actually makes me pay more attention to it and rewind it at times to catch what I missed.  I'll probably go back and watch this movie on the big TV with a bowl of popcorn in a couple of days so I can really pay attention to it.

GOGL works as its creators intended:  Low budget horror / comedy.  It's a good ol' fashioned haunted house story.  The overacting is intentional and almost always perfectly timed, the music adds to the whole schlock effect, the one-line zingers are the pinnacle of sarcastic humor, and it's just overall very entertaining.  Scary? It's probably scary for some fans of haunted house movies.  And it's certainly creepier and scarier than Ghostbusters.  But, no shivers up my spine.  That's okay, though.  I knew within the first couple of minutes of the movie that it's better made than most Bs and wasn't going to scare me.  That's a matter of personal taste and preference.  It doesn't mean the movie is a failure.

Watched it again- this deserves 3 stars.  Not anything I'm going to watch a third time.  Probably wouldn't have watched it a 2nd time had I been really paying attention to it the first time.",1415491200,,1388,4.506024096385542

Some funny stuff surrounded by the supernatural and some nice kills. There is a backstory with regards to the ghost who is haunting the studio that this team is using to make an independent movie. Generic story? Sure. It's meant to be though. Even the flashback used to show what happened to the girl was flaky and corny. There is a sense of exaggeration in this when it comes to the characters and their reactions to what is happening. Billy Zane tries to negotiate with a ghost. Lacey Chabert gets into a fist fight with a possessed Danielle Harris. This is not your usual horror movie so take that into consideration.,1413590400,,974,4.386740331491713

Synopsis : Actor Billy Zane of Titanic fame plays a low budget horror movie producer who rents a house for production and filming on Goodnight Lane, thus the movie title.
Soon we start to see strange and bizarre things including deaths take place on the studio set.
However this is not your typical horror movie in that it has great black humor added to it including Billy Zane serving up his fair share.

The references to the real-life character (who shall remain nameless lest I give a spoiler) are actually funny and well-done if you have any knowledge of that individual.  Billy Zane is ridiculous - but not in a bad way.
Had this on in the background as I did some work but found myself engrossed more than I thought I would.

It's not going to rank on a list of greatest horror movies ever but I rate this above average. The last one third of the movie was awesome. This is one of Harris's better horror movies in recent memory as she has been picking poor movies and getting too small parts. Her talents aren't wasted here. Some parts were scary and other parts were funny. I liked the combo of horror and comedy.

  It wasn't hard for Billy Zane to pull off playing a jerk but his character at times was funny and entertaining. Lacey was kind of understated and gave a good performances. I thought all the other actors did their parts well. The movie was a little slow in the beginning but the actors keep it going. I think I would recommend this for rental first. I think it's an underrated film. Harris fans should check it out. Fans of ghost stories will enjoy this. Give this one a shot! Cheers and Enjoy!",1405814400,4,1115,4.3768115942028984

6307732,1,B00IZZDZFE,"Avoid seeing this at all costs, it's not worth it, and I really suspect anyone rating this highly either worked on the film, or is a huge Billy Zane or Party of 5 fan and will give ratings based on the actors, rather than their awful performance in this cheap low budget snore fest.

The film starts off with the bad guy from Kindergarten Cop getting killed. Up to that point, the film looked like it might be interesting... you see that footage in the trailer, but oh boy, does it go down hill from there. None of his friends seem to care one bit that he is dead, and it's back to work as usual working on low budget films being made in their ...house?! The owner is thinking about selling but things start to happen as doors calmly close and work desk stationary begins to move a couple of inches, gripping stuff alright! Now with the movie crew and cast in a ...house... with an angry ghost, they manage to preform possibly the worst acting job of 2014!

Don't be fooled by the fact that Bill Zane is in this. His acting here is terrible. I think he phones most of it in, and extremely poor at that. You can really tell he's just doing this for the money and knows the movie is going to flop. The girl from Party of 5 adds nothing, and everyone else is a virtual unknown who I will be surprised if their careers can come back after this stinker. The acting reminded me of Debbie Does Dallas in some parts, and others as bad and irritating as watching that ridiculous staff meeting thing on TMZ. The visual effects are laughable, and for those saying this film made them laugh, it's not intentional, which is why I'm not going to give this film more stars because I found it so bad it was unintentionally funny, I found it irritating as you just wanna sit back with these sorts of things and see people get picked off one by one, not be bored to death with pointless interactions by characters you could not care less about before you see a tiny special effect that was not scary in the slightest, and then more pointless dialogs rammed down your neck.

Overall... it's not the most low budget film imaginable, it tried with the visual effects, but everything apart from the editing and sound department have cost this movie from being even considered half decent. Horrible script, acting, plot, pace, story and the attempt at a surprise end of whom the ghost is the daughter of... horribly executed, and I just did not care, and it did not make up for the boredom I was going through, struggling to get through this thing, hoping it will get better.

Don't bother.... it's rated 4.4 of 10 on IMDB with just over 320 votes so far... so that outta tell you, the film is avoidable and not a must see, that has left most people disappointed. Don't waste your time.",1405123200,5,2763,4.380116959064328

6307734,2,B00IZZDZFE,"Wow,...where to begin?!  I can understand some of these actors doing this movie, but not the others.  I decided to check this movie out due to the fact that Lacey Chabert was in this.  I'm a fan of her's and figured worse case scenario, at least she'd keep me interested.  No such luck there.  I was on the verge of cutting this off numerous times, but continued to force myself through it.  What I didn't understand was how they convinced some pretty decent actors to be involved in this movie?  I mean, how does Billy Zane go from Titanic to this?  It's not the fact that it's a low budget movie, it's the fact that it's so terrible you'd think his agents and friends would discourage him.  Is this a comedy, is it horror?  I'll tell you:  It's NEITHER!  It IS terrible, however!  The story is at dumb as it sounds.  Ok, that's fine because there are a lot of indie (and major) films that come out with bad ""stories"" but still have pretty good final products.  The only reason I'm not giving this a ONE is because most of the acting is good in it, if nothing else.  That deserves a little credit I figure.  Not that all the acting is good, but due to the balance of comedy/horror I honestly couldn't tell if the others were supposed to be bad or not?

The story goes,...

Alan (Billy Zane) owes a small indie movie studio that is run out of an old renovated house.  They have recently sold the property and are on verge of moving out when they arrive one morning to find an employee dead of an apparent ""accident"".  As they begin to learn more about the house's past, they soon realize there are some past actions that are coming back to haunt them.  Now with the exits all sealed shut, they have to fight to stay alive and try and get out before it's too late.

It's not really that interesting of a story and the final version shows it.  Even with some really good acting (at times), it still can't be saved.
