1035220,1,6305487871,"I would be embarrassed to let anyone know I watched this film let alone have anything to do with it.  With nothing else to do I had to give up trying to watch the first night.  I then tried again the second night  before quitting.  In  every aspect of measurement, (except for the color)  like acting, directing, overall content, etc. this film ranks a little bit  below that old film with the cave dwellers and Raquel Welch.  How did they  ever pick the name, Noah's Ark?",933379200,7,472,4.395348837209302
1035221,1,6305487871,No attention to detail.  I'm sure they didn't read the book.  They didn't even get the order of events correct.  It was absolutely sickening.  I watched for about an hour before shutting it off.,933292800,7,194,4.617647058823529
1035222,1,6305487871,"Another fine example of Hollywood/TV producers trashing the Bible. No problem for them since they obviously don't believe the Good Book anyway. They gave ""Noah"" a back-talking, quarrelsome, sickeningly insane  creature for a wife, and sons who were nowhere near the actual, true  Biblical account. This slap-in-the-face portrayal really angered me...so  much so that I turned it off in the first hour. I've never seen them do  this kind of thing to the beliefs/sacred writings of Buddhists, Hindus,  etc.; they're always doing this kind of stuff to Christians and their  beliefs, and it's really getting OLD. Why is it that the Bible and it's  true characters are always being mocked today in film? Read John 16:3...  ""And these things they will do to you because they have not known the  Father nor Me (Jesus Christ)."" In this dark world they take those  beliefs dear to us, trash them without conscience, ""rewrite""  them, and then use them for ratings and their own gain, because it's so  easy for them to. People of other religions would not let them get away  with it so easy. It seems too easy for them to walk all over Christians  today in this way. Let me point out why this ""film"" is a mockery  to NBC and its creators: Sodom and Gomorrah did not even happen until  several generations AFTER the great flood, and Lot was not Noah's friend,  he was one of his descendants. How stupid do film makers wish to make  themselves look just to continue to twist up the Bible they do not believe  in? Atleast they could TRY to make it look like they did SOME research into  this ""story"" they wished to televise. I doubt they even once  opened a Bible. This thing should have been called ""Joe Smith's  Ark"" instead, for this certainly is not about the Noah of the Bible.  They can keep their historically inaccurate garbage...no thank you.",933033600,7,1837,4.671875
1035223,1,6305487871,"Like many people I was excited about the movie coming out. It looked well made and appealing in the previews. But 10 minuetes into the movie I was really disappointed.  The movie is never the same as the book but let's  face it this movie wasn't even close to Genesis.  For starters Sodom and  Gomorah did not even exist during the time of Noah nor was Lot even alive.  This movie is one of Hollywoods attempts to discredit the Bible.  Lets face  it people are more likely to believe what they see on TV instead of what  they read.  So if someone who in to familiar with the Bible watches the  movie and then goes and reads it in the Bible,  that person will think that  the Bible is wrong.  There are so many other problems with this movie that  cannot be written in a 1,000 words.  I half to admit the movie did have a  couple of good things to it other than the cast:  it was well made and did  represent the times very well.  However when you make a movie that is based  on the Bible you don't make changes like that.",929836800,5,1021,4.138461538461539

In this movie, we were lead to believe that some survived for awhile. A little too comical.  Still,  it was done well.  Much better than today's trash.",1488067200,,323,4.543859649122807

1035361,1,6305487871,"Of the few versions of the NOAH'S ARK story that I have seen depicted on film, this is by far the worst. It is often embarrassingly bad. Jon Voigt does a respectable job portraying the main character, but the flaws of this film are too many to overlook. One word that stayed in my mind after watching it, was ""Levity"". The filmmakers and the actors themselves seemed generally to not take the ancient story seriously. The Biblical story is definitely interesting enough to make an exciting story... So why would the filmmakers neglect, for instance, the Sons of God & Daughters of Men account, and instead place Lot and Sodom & Gomorra in Noah's lifetime? Why make Lot a wicked inhabitant of Sodom, instead of a good man who simply made the poor decision to move there? Why have the Voice of God overdubbed in such a comical, light style? It's as if the destruction of Sodom and even the world were light, amusing themes to the filmmakers--there is even some poor comic relief at many points in the film.

The Hallmark film company have made some of my favorite movies and renditions of classic legends and literature--""Gulliver's Travels"", ""Alice In Wonderland"", ""Merlin"", and ""Don Quixote""--but it's sad that they would stoop so low as to film and offer up this bad rendition of a very serious and relevant story from antiquity.

I've been used to seeing Biblical films that, strangely, overlook some of the Bible's more interesting and exciting accounts, but this film stoops to a new low--that of almost travesty.",1472688000,,1517,4.786259541984733
1035362,1,6305487871,"This was one of the dumbest versions of Noah and the Ark I have ever seen!  The disclaimer said that it had taken liberties, but combining the stories of Noah and the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah 100s of years later was laughable!!  And where was the flood??  After Noah built the Ark with all the animals on board, there was no flood...not even a drop of rain!  That's what the story is really about!  And I had smile when I heard the voice of God, who sounded more like a British butler than the Deity.  My only good comment was the main cast of characters - all very talented actors. But their lines were often stiff and their dress looked more like medieval France.  The best way to watch this movie is to fast forward it one notch so that the lines are changed into gibberish and the animals come racing into the ark as if they're in hurry to get the best stalls on the boat!!
  I discovered this morning that there were 2 parts to this movie, so I take back what I said about there not being a flood.  There is but part 2 was just as ridiculous as part 1.  My grand kids watched it with me and laughed themselves silly!",1466640000,3,1130,4.185185185185185

1035438,1,6305487871,"I remember when I was young I saw what I thought was Noah's Ark with my parents. It must have been a segment of another Biblical movie that I remembered about Noah. It was VERY WELL done. I thought maybe a Charlton Heston played Noah. Who ever it was, was a major movie star back then.  I remembered as Noah was summoned by God to build the Ark, all the chaos going on with orgies and strange violent people around him when he was building the Ark not taking what he tried to warn everyone about seriously and what was going to happen. It was REALLY intense as I remember. I only wish I could find WHATEVER Movie I seen originally in my youth, because it sure wasn't THIS MOVIE. This REALLY is a bad rendition to say the least. I honestly was doubting if this wasn't a spoof. John Voight is Noah and God sounds like Woody Allen. I started laughing so hard I couldn't take it. Emily Mortimer is in the movie and I should have been tipped off by that alone, because she is way to young to be in the movie I seen years ago (and I LOVE Emily Mortimer, That's the reason I bought this in the first place and being smitten by her, I made this choice with my heart not my head!). I know this shouldn't be taken lightly, but as I said, if you have a good sense of humor, you'll love this. This is in the same class as a Monty Python style movie, like the ""Holy Grail"". I guess it's really not supposed to be a comedy, but I'm going to set this movie aside for a rainy day or when I'm maybe down in the dumps. This will lift my spirits and give me another good laugh. It's a movie that is hard to take seriously but, if you have a goofy sense of humor, you'll LOVE IT!!  I gave it a 1 star because IF it's supposed to be taken seriously, it stinks, BUT, if you take a light hearted view, it may be a 5 star to you. I think it's HILARIOUS!! Is Woody Allen the voice of GOD? You be the judge.... hahahahahahaha",1446595200,,1899,4.0344827586206895

Noah and Lot (that's right Noah, Not Abraham) leading up to the Destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah Before The Flood. How stupid is that.
The movie is filled with absurdities that I just laughed at how idiotic it was. Even the Ark itself was wrong. True the Ark had no rudder but not because G-D ""forgot"" but it wasn't meant to go anywhere, just float. It also had only One Window not several, and there was no ""deck"" to go on to, let alone anyway to get there as there was only One Door.
BTW if you want some scientific facts supporting the Ark, check out Dr. G. Thomas Sharp.
There is also a good documentary ""In Search of Noah's Ark"" in which it's explained how even Mt. Everest was covered with water, and how a group of scientist made a scale model and tried to sink it with virtual tidal waves and failed to do so.

1035614,3,6305487871,"Noah's Ark is a 1999 TV movie that tells the Biblical story of Noah's Ark from the Book of Genesis.

Noah is an ordinary laborer who one day begins receiving messages from God. It seems the Lord has a special assignment for him: since God is planning on destroying the world with a massive flood, he wants Noah to build a giant ark and fill it with one male and one female of each animal on earth. So why Noah of all people? As God tells him, ""You fit the bill. Good times, bad times, you believe in me."" And why a 500-foot- long ark? ""I think big! I made the world in seven days!"" Joining Noah on the trip of a lifetime is his wife Naamah and many animals.

This is very bad and clumsy movie. It is an example of how a filmmaker makes an irresponsible work to make Biblical movie. Taking artistic license to tell a story ultimately changed the real events as narrated in the Book of Genesis. It seems that producer deliberately made up everything, to show that Bible for him is just a book of fairy tales.

I've seen Jon Voight in a few things and thought he was a good casting choice for Noah and Mary Steenburgen as his wife-and also with Jon V. providing the voice of God: so gentle and soft spoken, nice move as well.

The writer, Peter Barnes, was a British playwright, director, producer among other vocations. Two of his best known plays/films are The Ruling Class with Peter O'Toole, and Enchanted April.
This 2 part mini-series is meant to entertain but Barnes, who studied British history & theology, was also Jewish.  He was serious in a funny, sometimes irreverent way-a combination of British satire and Jewish humor. Yet he captures your attention & for me, he made me think... to ponder over & over what that journey may have been like.
The film doesn't stick to scripture, however, scripture gives us little detail either. I have watched this DVD more times than any other movie in my 70 years & still pick up new nuances of Bible truths. I loved the characters interactions & relationships. This depiction of Noah showed his love for mankind, which caused him great pain; his obedience was done with a pure faith, yet he questioned God and felt guilty for the loss of so many lives.
For me, Peter Barnes wrote the essence of the story and the man. I continue to ponder how this relates to me...to my life...to what this Biblical tale is telling us today.

1035676,3,6305487871,"Although, liberal, theatrical license was taken, the biblical event and the message of second chances and starting all over again in life, is clearly evident. We all, at some point, need to take stock in what we 'do' have in life and appreciate and be grateful that at least we have, what we, do. Because at any given moment, weather calamity can strike and take everything from us. Jon Voight is the perfect actor for the part of Noah. Especially since, Noah was a definite family man who loved his wife and children and with such a tender heart, it's no wonder that the Lord chose Noah to preserve and care for the animals, as well. There is also some good food for thought about family, love, materialism, faith, loyalty, work ethic and obedience. It's a modern day interpretation complete with humor but it's Noah's Ark, nonetheless.

1035770,5,6305487871,"EDIT 4/3/14.  That's a significant date, as Noah was born on Passover, per Bible (you can't tell this in the English, you must compare the Greek OT which Jews translated from their Hebrew copy, versus our Hebrew copy -- the latter is sometimes wrong, giving rise to the silliness of Harold Camping, who can't read either language).  Passover is every 14th day following the vernal equinox, see my 'PATU29' video in Youtube or vimeo, and Noah's Flood Chronology channel in vimeo.  SO IT'S PASSOVER PER BIBLE.. TODAY.

I got the video in the mail from Amazon, today.  Watched it on Comcast (it's in On Demand, right now) two days ago.  Great and thought-provoking film which isn't afraid to make fun of itself.  Baby Christians will have a hard time understanding it, will even mistake it as sacreligious.  It's not.  Whatever the producers and writers intended, the fact remains that the movie shows people asking questions of God, and that's EXACTLY what He wants.  God's character is displayed as capricious, which He is not -- but we sure think of Him that way.

So the question is, why are we so hostile and disinterested (including moi)?  We don't even get the Lord's (Chanukah) Birth and (Passover) Death days right -- GOOD WEDNESDAY it should be called -- let alone Noah's dates.  For in 2450 BC, the Flood began, and he entered (and left) the boat on PENTECOST;  he was 364 days in that Boat, not 375 -- which you'd know, if you actually PAID ATTENTION and read the Greek compared to the Hebrew, to see how the former is a 'backup' of the right data the latter missed.

See the significance?  Pentecost means Harvesting the Gentiles, which Noah was;  ask any Jew you want, they all know what those 50 days (and 50 years, Jubilee) -- signify.  The holiday wouldn't come to exist until 2666 from Adam (Flood starting 1655 from Adam).  57 days between Passover and Pentecost (which everyone today misdates, so misses the connection to Noah).  57 is depicted pan-Bible as a metered 56 (most prominently in Isaiah 53's Hebrew, Psalm 90's Hebrew and Paul's Eph1:3-14 Greek) -- as DEADLINE WARNING.  49+7, number of years Israel would miss her sabbaticals, plus the seven years due on them.  Precedented, in NOAH.

So yeah, this movie's important.  It asks questions which SHOULD be asked.  Don't believe in God or the Flood?  That's your free right.  Do believe?  Yeah, that's your right too.  But if you claim to be a Jew or Christian but are not curious to ask God why, then you're not interested in Him.  WHY the Flood?  WHY the 57 days (if you understood Numbers 28:26 rightly, so knew that counting the Omer begins on Firstfruits, which is the LAST day of Passover week, aka EASTER in our modern parlance but misdated every year).  Shame on us, for being so slipshod in our Bible knowledge.  Which, the movie rightly and gently chides.

There's a guy named Jack P. Lewis who wrote a dissertation on the Flood, here available in Amazon.  Link will be in the comments. Book was $100 when I bought it; but is $125 now, exactly as pictured.  His dissertation is but a survey of Jewish and Christian literature about how Noah's Flood timing sets precedence for our calendar; he takes no sides.  Short piece, quick read, easy to understand, useful as a syllabus.  Get it, if you're curious.

Original review follows below.
===================

This show was on Comcast when I woke up this morning.  When I saw Jon Voight was playing Noah, Mary Steenburgen his wife, F. Murray Abraham as Lot (who actually lived 490 years later), and Noah's sons played by Alexis Denisof (of Buffy and Angel, the English guy), Mark Bazeley and my fav Jonathan Cake (of the Empire series), I was intrigued.  Great acting, wonderful ensemble cast of A-class actors all bundled up in a story line that furnishes an insightful take on the culture of the time, plus a VERY witty script, fabulous directing and cinematography, special effects -- but forget about Bible accuracy.

For in this movie, Abraham's cousin Lot -- Abraham, who in fact got his covenant from God 490 years after Noah did -- are of the same generation.  Hah.  Lot of course is also an Abraham, who said of his stone-turned wife, 'she always said she was salt of the earth, and now, she is'.  Plus a line from the famous Monty Python, 'It's....""

Okay, I get it:  this is an update on the Mel Brook's 'History of the World'.  And, there are a number of clever snipes against Scripture in the lines, combined with a moments of slapstic.  They are just clever enough so you can think -- well, is all this sniping really against Bible, or against our ignorance of it?  Mind you, I didn't like the Mel Brooks production, but this one.. yeah baby!

I mean, when you actually think about the Noah story -- and I'm one of those anal Bible-hugging Christians, okay -- the story is rather weird.  I've spent years analysing it, and what's singularly important to Bible-believing Christians about this movie -- is that the folks making it actually paid ATTENTION to the weirdness.  For if the story is true about Noah -- and I know it is -- then that guy had a really weird life, along with his whole family.  Would you or I be able to endure 120 years of people laughing?  For it did NOT take 120 years to build that boat.  He took his time doing it, as a witness to the world, and with all those animals taking that long to get there (so obviously 7th and 8th generation animals were walking into Noah's place at all hours) -- well, the fame of the event would be worldwide by the time the Flood occurred.

Brilliant, just brilliant piece of work.  So yes I'm gonna buy it, just put it in my cart.  Definitely worth watching many times.",1396137600,,5676,4.605788423153693
1035771,4,6305487871,"Let's make this clear, I'm rating this highly because it's a very entertaining BAD movie.  If you like that sort of thing (and you know who you are), this may be the movie for you.  If you're looking for a serious Biblical epic or an *intentionally* funny movie, keep looking.

I saw some clips on Encore, and assumed it was a parody (think ""Monty Python's Life of Noah"").  Then I googled it, and realized it was meant to be taken seriously.  With that in mind, it's kind of like a horrible car wreck you can't look away from.

Where to start...

First of all, they combine the stories of Sodom and Gomorra.  Since I don't actually believe either one, this didn't bother me so much.  God warns Noah that He's going to destroy Sodom, and Lot gets saved because he's Noah's friend, rather than the whole ""Please rape my daughters"" thing that's in the Bible.  In fact, Lot's daughters are left out entirely, which also gets them out of the awkward part where he gets drunk and has sex with them after they leave the city (what, you never learned that part in Sunday school?).  The Ark stuff comes later.

In order to make appeal to a wider audience, the ""punched it up"" a bit, with action, cheesy special effects, and attempts at humor, some which are funny - although the funniest bits are unintentional.  There's also an incredible amount talent wasted on this film.  Oscar winners (!) Jon Voight and F. Murray Abraham play Noah and Lot, with Mary Steenburgen and Carol Kane playing their wives.  Even James Coburn makes a couple cameos.  Their salaries didn't leave them a lot left over for minor things like decent sets. The battle scenes really do look like Monty Python. In addition to playing Noah, Voight also provides the voice of God, presumably because they couldn't afford James Earl Jones.  Also, what is it about made for TV movies and accents?  Noah and his wife clearly have American accents, while most other people - including their kids -  have strong British accents.

The tone is a roller coaster, ranging from sincerely reverent, to bawdy humor (Lot: ""Not staying for the orgy, Noah?"") to actual slapstick (Lot's wife fall head first into a vat of dye at one point).  The music faithfully tracks the tone, transitioning from Cecile B. DeMille to Three Stooges.

You may wonder why the flood happens only halfway through the movie.  Without giving any spoilers, I'll just say that there's plenty to come.  Grab your beer and popcorn, because that's when things get *really* weird.

So if you like to watch bad movies and give them the Mystery Science 3000 treatment, keep this one in mind.

I dinged it one star because as a two part miniseries, it's a bit too long, and when it's not really bad, it's merely boring.  I'm seriously considering buying the DVD so I can edit down to a 90 minute party cut.",1394928000,,2821,4.601202404809619

I was beginning to think the creators intentionally set out to make a mockery out of christianity. The series seemed like a guise because it was marketed as being a ""sound"" family oriented biblical story that actually teaches something, instead it was a joke. Mary S. hitting people over the heads with frying pans or whathave you, their kids were often presented as being bored on the ark and thinking of sex to ad nauseam and there were thoughts of maybe killing some of the animals that they didn't 'like' and on and on in this manner, also the actors seemed like they were on dope and the inane dialog was just mind-blowingly dumb!  I was disappointed and confused.

Like other reviewers commented, it seems odd that one would choose to create a bible-based story and then not seem to actually consult scriptures to find out what the storyline was!

I guess part of what makes no sense to me is if you are making a movie based on the bible you are somewhat limiting the audience - so I would assume you would then create a story that WORKED for that audience. In this case it's like they narrowed their audience and then set to work seeing how they could best ruin a story that is known and loved.

1035981,1,6305487871,"I got this movie bundled with ""Jonah, A VeggieTales Movie"", recently at Sam's Club.  I was sadly disappointed in this film.  As other reviews have very well mentioned, this film is not based on the Bible.

This movie starts out with a war scene in a violent, sex-crazed society.  I can give it that, I'd imagine the pre-flood society to be something like this.  Then it just goes down hill, we are introduced to Noah's friend ""Lot"", and yes this is apparently the Lot in the bible because they both flee Sodom together, and Lot's wife even turns into a pillar of salt!

About an hour into the film, we get to the point of the movie, where Noah starts to build the ark.  Fortunately for Noah, God gets impatient with him and gathers and builds a majority of the ark for him.

The animals are gathered, and Noah and family shut the door.  Wait a minute, in the bible, God shuts the door?  Flood happens, everyone dies, oh but wait, there is a traveling salesman who sells Noah alcohol after the flood so he can get drunk, and there are also pirates on the water after the great flood to try and seize the ark (Have you heard enough yet?)

And probably worse of all, which is why I'm trashing this film, near the end of this film, ""God"" is viewed as a being who can't make up his mind, first he wants to save Noah, then he wants to destroy him, then he leaves and forsakes him for a time, then he comes back to tell him he's going to die, then after a crazy dance he changes his mind and will save him again.  In fact, they even get this ""God"" to admit he makes mistakes too.

Don't even use this film as a teaching tool for your children about how bad movies are made.  Guess what?, they decided to throw a few ""A"" and ""D"" bombs into the mix.  What a filthy movie...

The issue of Noah taking Abraham's role and asking God not to destroy Sodom, the innuendo that the Bible can't be trusted, a peddler on a boat that survived the flood, Lot's ship attacking the ark, Noah's sons not being married, God trying to decide whether to destroy Noah's family or not, I could go on, but I'd just be rehashing what others have already stated.

1036017,5,6305487871,"The God from the Old Testament thought more highly of his non-human creation that He commanded Noah to use the vast majority of His ark to save them from the flood. Having been raised a  religious person, it never dawned on me, at least in this Bible story, God was more interested in saving the animal world than in salvaging the human race!

It was apparent that there were plenty of worthy people to save other than Noah's family, and his future daughter-in-laws. The film's writers give us fictionalized examples: No one can deny the goodness of Ruth's mother, or the unnamed peddler. God didn't want other worthy people aboard despite how easy it would have been to rescue them! But God did save the tarantulas and hissing cockroaches!

I'm not justifying this particular God's obvious brutality. A theme which clearly runs through the Noah's Ark story.  But it is important for all of us to come to terms with the simple fact: God greatly cherishes ALL of his non-human creation!

One of my favorite scenes was when a pair of Dodo's, now long extinct by the hands of selfish and foolish men, waddled up the ark's ramp! Another treasured moment was when Noah talks his wife out of throwing the tarantulas and hissing cockroaches out the ark's window, dooming them to extinction! Noah said essentially, ""everything is interrelated, other creatures depend on them, and what gives you the right to doom any species to extinction?!""

I'm sure this went over most viewers heads, but Noah's Ark is first, and foremost, about saving God's creation from extinction! All of it! Not just what is intelligent, pretty, or convenient! This pearl of wisdom is the foundation of the United State's majestic Endangered Species Act. Something which would make the God of the Old Testament very proud, indeed!

There are plenty of reasons why this film will make fundamentalists, and other religious folks, very unhappy. But, hopefully, saving God's creation, in the here, and now, is not one of them!

The biggest problem with this movie was that it simply seemed to be too long and drawn out. There were also some scenes that felt like padding and added nothing to the story (and in some cases detracted from it). For instance, during the long voyage while the earth was covered by water, everyone goes a bit crazy. That's an acceptable premise but it's played out theatrically for far too long and in a variety of embarrassing scenes for the actors. The idea that they suffered madness was fine to introduce but it shouldn't have taken up so much time nor been quite so adbsurdly plotted out like a little play.

There were also a couple of ridiculous encounters on the water (between Lot acting as a pirate and a merchant who sold them various trinkets for water) which undermined the entire story of the great flood. Everyone was supposed to have perished in the flood and it was a bit absurd that a few would be sailing the high seas on little boats. It was just plain silly and, again, seemed to be put in just to pad the story or add unnecessary ""spice"" (it didn't work as a means of jazzing up the story).

I'm guessing the writers felt the time on the water had to be long to show how Noah and his family suffered or had their faith tested but they also felt it had to be more interesting than just lounging on the boat and taking care of the animals. This type of insecurity with telling a story in the most effective way is what causes so many productions to go bad.

Just how bad the show was can probably be summed up by saying that in one scene Noah greeted Lot.  For those a little rusty on their Old Testament, Noah can be found in Genesis chapter 6 while Lot is Genesis chapter 19.  This epic opened with the tale of Lot (minus Abraham) and the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah (also minus Abraham).
One thing that really puzzled me about this production was the way the locals kept treating Noah as if he were a fool.  This puzzles me because the locals all knew that Noah had the only farm in the land where anything would grow.  So would frustrated and hungry farmers merely laugh at Noah or would they hate him and raid his farm?  I was also amused when some of the locals began quoting Shakespeare.  At another point a Michael Palin look-alike runs up dressed in rags and with a long scraggly beard and says, ""Its.""  A brief moment of humor for Monty Python fans but I don't know why it was in there.
But the writers of Noah's Ark did take from one good source, mainly the Broadway musical Two by Two starring Danny Kaye.  Unfortunately the stolen scene was one of Noah's sons claiming the Ark was not finished because it did not have a rudder.  Now if he were right and the Ark needed a rudder then God made a mistake.  But it would also meant that Noah's son would have to be strong enough to operate a rudder on a boat three-hundred cubits in length.  But the ark was built by God and not Noah.  The writers also kept pushing the idea that an ark is a boat.  No, but Noah's Ark took the form of a boat.  An ark is simply a sacred container for the safe storage of something precious.  Any fan of Indiana Jones knows that (or did he dig up a boat in Tannis?).

1036073,1,6305487871,"Religiously, this movie is so way off-base that your jaw will drop in disbelief at what goes on within the script (such as God abandoning Noah during the flood because He needs time to ""think"" about the fate of the human race, or admitting to Noah that He sometimes makes mistakes, too). But, hey, the movie's been made and the damage is already done. As a putrid piece of celluloid fluff, this one ranks up there with other bad movies like ""Can't Stop The Music"" and ""Xanadu"". It's perfect for Bad Movie Night, if you're into that sort of thing. The plot line is flimsy, the special effects are cheap, and the acting is bad. The movie did elicit a few chuckles, but I don't think that was the producers' intention. Some scenes are downright ludicrous, such as when Noah and his wife try to find one good person in Sodom. They settle on Lot who, although he participated in a drunken feast and orgy earlier in the movie (offscreen, thankfully), is chosen ONLY because he's Noah's best friend. This is how they pick people to be saved from the wrath of God! Or when Noah gets help from God after complaining that he'll never get the Ark finished in time for the flood; he wakes up with what looks like the lumber yard at Home Depot (didn't know they had 2 X 4's in those days?...you do now!). Or why Noah and his wife have American accents, while their three sons have British accents, which they still have well into their early 20's! The inaccuracies go on and on. One thing that must be mentioned is that this is a heavily edited version of the original that appeared on TV: gone are the flood-surviving fireball-throwing pirates (fireballs in a wooden ship, go figure!), the anti-pre-marital sex gorilla, the obnoxiously stupid talking puppet made from an orange, and the (unintnetional) hysterically funny pooping koala blooper scene.

Whoever wrote the script must have only read the book of Genesis once, because he got all the characters mixed up. For instance, it was not Noah who saved Lot from Sodom, but Abraham. Of course the women on the ark with Noah's sons were married way before the ark took off, so that whole scene of 'rescuing' them from the flood never happened.
And whatever viewer it was that quoted Genesis 27:40, (the only person on here who liked this movie) you made that up. The scripture has nothing to do with Noah, he's already dead by then! It has to do with Esau and Jacob. ""You will live by the sword and you will serve your brother, But when you grow restless, you will throw his yoke frokm off your neck.""
One scene truly puts this in the fantasy category, is when the ark is floating, the people of the earth have been destroyed, but they meet up with the peddler of goods on his boat.

1036100,2,6305487871,"""Noah's Ark"" must inspire everybody in Hollywood who dreams of making a movie because it proves that there is no idea so outrageous that somebody will not ante up several millions of dollars to put it on film.  Granted, the Bible stories found in Genesis are sketched out rather than told as fully developed narratives, but this goes well beyond filling in the gaps.  In a mini-series that is jaw-droppingly bad, what is the part in the script by Peter Barnes where your jaw becomes unhinged: for my money that is when the pirates attack the Ark during the Flood.

So do I really have to say anything more than that?

I would not take the position that any dramatic license with scripture is by definition wrong.  My favorite scene in ""Jesus of Nazareth"" is when Jesus tells the parable of the Prodigal Son while he is at the house of Matthew the taxcollector and the morally offended Peter is standing in the doorway listening.  It is a brilliant use of the parable mainly because it provides an appropriate spiritual context.  But there is nothing like that in this debacle.  I am sure this was sold on being a Bible Disaster Flick, the Genesis version of ""The Poseidon Adventure.""  Instead it ends up being something more akin to an Ed Wood film.

To add insult to injury, the film actually does try to deal with the ""big"" question, as to why God created humans but was so troubled by their exercising their free will to be evil.  ""Noah's Ark"" suggests that one of the reasons for the Flood was to give God enough time to think up an answer.  I always knew the story of the Flood was an object lesson for humanity, but apparently it was really just an oral exam for Noah.

""Noah's Ark"" does not get a single star for two reasons.  First, no one actually dies in the making of the film, therefore it is a step up from being a snuff film.  Second, the film has to inspire people to read the Bible story of Noah's Ark simply because the vast majority of people who find themselves sitting through this film are going to want to go check out what the Bible really has to say about the Flood.  But to those who want to go the one star route--I will not say them nay.",1049241600,13,2164,4.3725
