If you love ancient aliens combined with a male version of Yma Sumac, then this is the movie for you.  The film takes us on Tom Kenyons psychotic journey from Christianity, Buddhism and Hinduism to Taoism, liberally sprinkled along the way with people who are from Venus, an aborigine and rock people and aliens.  There is also a trip down the rabbit hole, even though Alice herself does not seem to be invited to the party.
In the pieces of documentary that show us his international performances, we find the stage filled with an equal opportunity array of gods and goddesses to create the necessary magic accoutrements to give credence to his mystic views
His favorite ancient aliens, the Hathors are a group of inter-dimensional, intergalactic beings who were connected to ancient Egypt and have come to help us out of our present environmental and social predicaments obviously by means of sound, hence his Song of the New Earth.
His singing has a distressing bombacity, alternating Tuva-style throat singing with soprano interludes neither of which possesses a melodic redeeming value (since musical tastes differ greatly you may like it).  Although his range is quite remarkable, the juxtaposition of the different parts of his soundscapes seem more like a challenge to the audience to take him seriously rather than to dismiss his audacity.
Tom claims to integrate modern science with his mysticism but I have not been able to detect where the scientific part may be hiding.  If we have to count on people like him to save the earth I see very little chance for survival.",1412208000,2,1601,4.8966789667896675
