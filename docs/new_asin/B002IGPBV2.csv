""DisneyNature: Migration""
(Disney, 2012)
---------------------------------------------------------------
This short, 25-minute educational film has lots of extraordinarily beautiful footage, culled from several recent Disney and BBC nature films, and presents a good, brief overview of migration patterns of several kinds of animals, as well as some explanation for their motivations - food, reproduction, etc. However the narration by voiceover artist Lucas Grabeel is cloying, and the presentation lacks the heft of the longer films this draws upon. It might be good for younger, K-3 primary grade viewers, but older students or families wishing to dig deeper might want to try series such as ""Earth"", ""Life"", or ""Blue Planet"" instead.

This series is meant for classroom use and the short format works within those time constraints; also included are modest educational bonus features such as a short quiz and some online resources for teachers. Mostly, though, this is about the pretty pictures... and they are quite nice! (Joe Sixpack, ReadThatAgain children's media reviews)",1350950400,,1144,6.15
