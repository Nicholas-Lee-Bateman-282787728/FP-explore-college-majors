435475,3,6302077990,"I mostly enjoyed ""Bliss,"" but something seems to be missing. I recently read somewhere that there's a lengthier director's cut of the film; I believe this would definitely be worth a look as this film has great potential, but suffers from too many of the characters (as well as much of the plot) not being fully fleshed out. In other words, it all feels somewhat squeezed in to the roughly 110 minutes running time. I suspect that writers Ray Lawrence and Peter Carey struggled with trying to incorporate all the elements of Carey's novel&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bliss/dp/0679767193/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bliss</a>&nbsp;in to the film.",1323129600,,691,5.92
435476,5,6302077990,"It took me 20 years to see this movie again. It is worth the wait and the cost. The take-away message may be more relevant now than ever. The format is viewable from a DVD Drive on a PC. This movie is up there with ""The King of Hearts"" for encouraging one to re-evaluate their lives.",1303948800,2,283,4.071428571428571
435477,5,6302077990,"The stars are for the movie, not the quality of the DVD transfer. I just got my copy of this 2-DVD set from my sister in Australia.

As long as your TV is set to NTSC, the DVD is viewable using the OPPO. Picture quality is a step up from video-tape, but it is not the sharpest image. It is somewhat pixelated on a 50 inch plasma screen, though after so many years of only seeing this on video tape, its manageable. One aspect that is nice is that the DVD has better sound then the video, so there is more to hear with a decent audio set-up. It is still a great film, just as I remembered it from the mid 1980s. The last 20-30 minutes is extraordinarily beautiful. Just don't expect miracles in the presentation. One can hope for the blu-ray!",1276387200,,996,5.270440251572327
435478,5,6302077990,"Amazon is listing the DVD for this movie as being discontinued from by the manufacturer.

How can something that was never made be discontinued (Region 1)???

This is an awesome movie....how could anyone in their right mind not know that there is a large audience just waiting for it to be released in a modern format????",1264636800,3,321,4.714285714285714
435479,5,6302077990,"It's a bit baffling that this movie has, for the twenty or so years since its release, never been released in the U.S.  Not only is it available only as an import on Amazon, it's nearly impossible to find in video stores for rental.

It's a magical-realist-style Australian movie from the late 80s.  The basic plot is that there's this guy, Harry Joy, who suffers a heart attack and is resuscitated.  However, such is the horror of his many epiphanies after this that he comes to believe that he was never resuscitated, and is now living in hell.

The quality of the disks you're buying here is less than fantastic.  For example the film, while not long, has been rendered on two discs, and there is nothing for extra features.

But highly recommended anyhow:  it's one of the most perfect movies I can think of.  There ending is so ineffably beautiful that you're going to wish you had watched the whole thing more carefully.

Note that the film is based on a novel by Peter Carey.",1246147200,12,982,4.528409090909091
435480,5,6302077990,"No spoilers here.

Film is our modern mass culture's source of mythology. Bliss by Ray Lawrence is a fantastic piece of storytelling which pays homage to the greatest filmmakers while carving its own distinct space. Just the right amount of wit and wisdom swirled together into a surreal experience that is only too real for the protagonist. I haven't seen the film since my cherished VHS copy went bad from watching it so many times. Still looking for a domestic DVD release.

Enjoy!",1229299200,7,484,4.819277108433735
435481,4,6302077990,"I read the book, I saw the movie, as they came out. A man has a heart attack, is brought back but his new world is a little bit different. Didn't he notice beforehand that his wife is cheating on him with his partner, his son is a drug dealer, supplying even to his sister in return for sex, or has he died and gone to hell? You will find out. In a way, I now see this movie as a precursor to American Beauty. A lot of Australian humour, which you Yanks don't seem to get, just like we don't get yours. Pity",1224460800,,507,3.8846153846153846
435482,5,6302077990,I wonder what's behind this particular movie never having been released on DVD in the US? I refuse to buy a used VHS copy of the this movie because I want my first viewing after 20 years to be in glorious widescreen DVD with good sound. So I'm waiting. And waiting. And waiting.

435483,5,6302077990,"How can volumes 1-7 of ""Green Acres"" get on DVD and this is forgotten?  Are there no movie buffs out there in the industry at all?  Unfathomable.  Well, get the tape if you tripped over this, because if you're a movie fan, this is an essential film.",1147132800,4,249,4.25531914893617
435484,5,6302077990,"This is the first movie directed by Ray Lawrence (of ""Lantana"" fame), based on a wonderful Peter Carey novel. Twenty years later, it remains a very entertaining black comedy, loaded with humor (of all flavors), a sincere regard for Life's big questions (""What happens when I die, and what must I do now to avoid postmortem unpleasantness?""), and arresting bits of surrealism within an otherwise realistic film. Above all, the film regards its characters with affection, despite their flaws (and they are myriad!).

My VHS copy is wearing out from multiple viewings. The folks at Village Roadshow in Australia released a 2-disc DVD set in September 2005, complete with a separate director's cut, audio commentary, and ""script-to-screen"" feature. However, this DVD is available only as a Region-4 disc, and will not play on North American (i.e., Region-1) DVD players.

Here's hoping that somebody will decide to release this movie in a Region-1 format, so that the film's North American fans can enjoy it once again.",1146355200,8,1015,5.1454545454545455
435505,4,6302077990,"Any news? I've been watching for this to get a DVD release for over 5 years. ANCHOR BAY may have had it listed a few years ago, but if it was this BLISS, the planned release seems to have fallen through.

I already quit a lousy job, years ago. So I just want to enjoy this interesting movie, my life doesn't need changing that way anymore.",1137974400,,339,4.136363636363637
435506,5,6302077990,"This is truly one of the greatest movies of all time, especially if you are a baby boomer, born between 1946 and 1963 (don't worry, this assures it will eventually be on DVD).  For some reason, all of us love, or are sympathetic to the concept of, Australia.  This movie exemplifies the brilliance and social understanding of our colleagues in the Antipodes.  The movie captivates you with its eccentrincities, and weaves a stream of consciousness motif that James Joyce would truly envy.  Yet it is always entertaining, and as others have pointed out, it has the most beautiful endings and overall themes of any movie made in the last quarter of the last century.  Also the soundtrack is beautiful; I've been trying to find it remastered, but have already carefully made magnetic media copies of the movie and soundtrack in my archives.  I can't wait for a critical mass of folks from my generation to rediscover it so that we may all enjoy a digital version of the movie and the soundtrack in our lifetime....",1129593600,11,1011,4.748571428571428

435508,5,6302077990,"This movie takes you on a life and death journey through the life of Harry Joy, a basically good man who weaves stories that hypnotize his family and neighbors.  It's a journey in movements of how Harry earns true love but only by first taking a hellish dive into the ugliness of the commercial, poisonous world he lives in.
At the start Harry has a heart attack and dies having a harrowing death experience.  He's revived but everything is different after his glimpse of hell.  He sees the ugliness he once refused to see in everything around him, his untrue wife, his slut daughter and his nasty son, his ugly business affairs and the cancer that his company's products cause.  He has a drunken night with a business collegue who insists on sending out for hookers.  Honey Barbara, a simple hippyish girl who lives on honey, may be in poverty forced into turning tricks but she's no whore.  Harry knows Honey Barbara is his real true love yet he blows it.  Until he plants the honey bearing trees that will flower in seven years.
Highly entertaining, disturbingly surreal at times, gentle and poetic at others, this Australian film was a critical success when it was released in 1985 but has been nearly forgotten in the last few years.
The ending is lovely and unforgettable. Bliss really deserves to be seen.  Go to Amazon, buy a used copy if you must.  Really a great movie!",1070150400,7,1379,4.618852459016393
435509,5,6302077990,"This film is not for everyone, but I loved it. It grabs you from the opening scene where Harry Joy dies of a heart attack and never stops surprising you.  I don't want to say more since it might interfere with your viewing enjoyment. Siskel and Ebert once commented the difference between a good movie and a great movie is the ending. This is a great movie.  Only warning is that one must watch it a few times to get all the details since so much is going on and there are so many unusual plots to the story. So keep watching and you will be surprised at the brillance, the daring, the acting and the truth of it all. This film is a comedy, a drama, a love story, and a shock on the senses. Don't try to make sense of it, let it take you along for a surreal down-under experience. A truly remarkable film. Hope it gets to DVD one day to reach a wider audience.  Quirky, grity, sexy, shocking, and more. Do yourself a favor and see this film.",1029369600,9,941,4.131147540983607
435510,5,6302077990,"Bliss blew me away, it was so creative and full of awe-inspiring humourous insight into the insanity of Western Civilization.  That Barry Otto didn't win best Actor and Ray Lawrence Best Director at that years Academy Awards just shows how rigged and disgusting the Academy Awards are!! This movie both expands your mind and gives you release laughing and crying at the things it shines a light on.  If I were to have to pick 5 favorite films this would be right in there, if not my favorite film of all time. Came out the same year as Ken Russell's Crimes of Passion which is amazing good too, just not quite this good. Wish I could find it on DVD!!",1027036800,,650,4.408333333333333

7822302,2,6302077990,"The movie starts with a good enough premise, man has heart attack, man dies and then comes back, determined to life a better, more righteous life.  The first five minutes have a unique quirkiness about them, but then the movie seems to lose focus and just goes on and on and on.  By the end of the movie, I seem to have lost what the point of the whole film was.",1451260800,,362,4.084507042253521

7822305,5,6302077990,"I first saw this film back when it came out in the mid-Eighties.  Came in to the video store where I was working, and I decided to give it a try.  Loved it, loved it.  Read the book, bought a videotape, always enjoyed it.  Cut to now:  long out of print in the US, never did have a digital release here.  Saw this version of the movie, and decided to take a chance.  Well, let's not kid ourselves, this is a terrible print.  It's pan-and-scan, and it looks like it was ripped from VHS copy.  Didn't play in my blu-ray player.  I'd known it was a risk, and it looked like it wasn't paying off.  So I tried one last thing:  I put it in my computer.  Voila, it played just fine.  So I finally got to show it to my wife, who used to go to that same video store long before we knew one another, but who had never watched the movie.",1405209600,,826,3.957317073170732

This dark comedy has some truly funny moments (i.e. the fish falling from his cheating wifes vagina when she's feeling guilty about cheating on him.)

7822308,5,6302077990,"Adapted from the Peter Carey novel, ""Bliss"" is the story of Harry Joy and the love letter that takes 8 years to be delivered. The movie hooks you with a compelling 5 minute opening scene in which the main character, Harry Joy, a 40ish ad exec, dies in his backyard during a birthday party and witnesses his own death as if it was someone else's. He floats in ecstasy above his body until he suddenly sees both the bliss of heaven and the tortures of hell. In this fear, he makes his way back to his body, reviving after being dead four minutes. And, as the narrator says, ""he would never be the same again.""  Knowing now, beyond a doubt, both heaven and, more importantly, hell do exist, Harry Joy begins a re-examination of his life and of those lives around him. The film exhibits a quirkiness frequently found in Australian cinema, and that is a compliment in this case. Through dream sequences, symbolic hallucinations and a bartender who talks to the camera, the movie leads Harry and the viewer to question whether his family and close associates are real or actually clever demons sent to torment him as he tries to make sense of life on earth now considering the knowledge he has acquired from his near-death experience. Harry's fractured life becomes refocused when he meets and falls for Honey Barbara, a neophyte call-girl(""a gifted amateur"") who visits the city from the rain forest to make some money. Barbara, beautiful and much younger than Harry, raises bees in the forest and her passion is honey. Harry and his new found love have a falling out, but, his former life now useless to him, Harry eventually follows after Honey Barbara to the rain forest. There he lives a remarkably transformed life planting trees and trying to win back the stubborn Honey Barbara. It is the rain forest where the stage is set for the ""love letter that takes 8 years to be delivered."" What that means will remain a mystery until you view the film. This is not a family film or shallow romantic comedy although there are some very funny scenes including one involving a circus elephant which, being trained to sit on big red boxes, accidentally sits on Harry's red Fiat when he parks it too close to the pachyderm. One of the funniest scenes in movie history. The movie contains some sexual scenes, brief nudity and memorable dialogue.",1326931200,2,2333,4.67639902676399
