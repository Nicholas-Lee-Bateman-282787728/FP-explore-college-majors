686379,2,6303514723,"...for having to speak the awful dialogue. With the lines Dean Stockwell has to get out, you just feel so sorry for him. He actually has to punctuate his sentences with phrases like ""Dear boy."" Bronson  Pinchot's lines are almost as bad, but at least he gets to be crazed. Then  there's the psychic deus ex machina girl who saves everybody. Yarggh.
On  the other hand, if you're a fan of genuinely bad CGI (computer-generated  imagery) effects, be sure to see this--these are hands down the worst  you'll ever see in a mainstream production! It's like they got their  rendering software in a box of cracker jacks--everything's all shiny  because that's the easiest to render. It's a wonder they were able to  remove hidden lines. The teeth on the langoliers themselves are literally  geometric pyramids and conical projections--and they give them close ups  anyway! It looks like they lifted their time rift from Fractal Explorer in  Kai's Power Tools! These people are shameless!",934761600,11,980,4.950920245398773

686649,3,6303514723,"The Good:

(1) Stephen King
(2) Great story and atmosphere that kept interest most of the way through. Creepy odd things occur that make you really want to figure out what is going on and not stop watching.

The Bad:
(1) Some of the acting is absolutely awful and distracting from the film. It seemed some of the performances were over-the-top.
(2) Could have been 1hr + 30 mins rather than 2+ hrs. There is a romance that seems to be out of place ... seems like we don't really need to know or don't want to know about it.
(3) I watched this recently and due to technology advances, old CGI effects look really terrible. I really had to make an effort to put this aside.
(4) The ending was not what I would call a normal Stephen King ending... but I didn't read the book so maybe it was the same in the book. Just seems that all the Stephen King stories I have read have had a particular style to the endings and this one was different but not a good different. Now, I realize that the books are different from the video-film adaption of the book, so with that in mind I was ok with it.

Over all I enjoyed watching the film but caught myself drifting off at different times as my interest would fluctuate. I also got irritated with the acting at times and could sometimes relate to the characters while at other times not at all.",1388880000,,1331,4.252964426877471
686650,2,6303514723,"Let me start off by saying I'm a huge Stephen King fan, but this never should have gotten the green light. It had a lot of potential but it quickly fizzles. Most of the time you are spent wondering what a langolier is and what it looks like. And then when they finally show up it's kind of like 'that's it?' The CGI looked like something my nephew could have done. I get that this is 1995 that we're talking about, but keep in mind that Star Wars came out in 1977 so we know the technology was there. Not to spoil any of the deaths, but I found the lack of compassion when (blank) died to be a little odd. And the little girl's psychic powers? Come on. If I had to say one good thing about this movie it's that it had a pretty good freeze frame ending.",1385510400,,752,4.02

686735,4,6303514723,"On one level, Stephen King's THE LANGOLIERS (TV-1995) really worked for me as I'm not the most relaxed airline traveler. Not a perfect film by any means (CGI effects are cartoonish), but it does follow Roger Corman's #1 rule of monster movies: build up anticipation as long as possible before showing the creature(s).

The plot's intriguing: ten passengers on a jam-packed jet flying non-stop from L.A. to Boston awake in the middle of the night to discover that all the other passengers and the flight crew have vanished, leaving behind personal possessions like jewelry, pocket change, false teeth, Walkmen, watches (all stopped at 7 after 4), reading material, etc. Fortunately for those still on the plane, among them is an off-duty airline pilot (David Morse). After the cockpit door's forced open, he takes the captain's seat.

When there's no answer on any radio frequency it soon becomes apparent that everyone on the ground has also disappeared. Stress from this dilemma is worsened by one self-important loudmouth (Bronson Pinchot) who won't stop screaming about the necessity of making a 9 am meeting in Boston. Only the threat of violence from other passengers shuts him up, but this cold sweating paranoiac is sure to cause more trouble.

Also on the plane: a burly tool & die maker (Frankie Faison), a teen girl (Kimber Riddle) sent East to a rehab, a young man (Christopher Collet) who's off to college on a violin scholarship, a blind girl of about 12 (Kate Maberly) hoping that an operation will restore her eyesight, a fifth grade schoolteacher (Patricia Wettig) who becomes the child's guardian, a chubby guy (Baxter Harris) who's first and last thought is of food, a mystery writer (Dean Stockwell) that's obviously King's surrogate (his surmises advance the story) and a secretive, take-charge kind of felllow with a British accent (Mark Lindsay Chapman) who assists the pilot and also helps maintain order. As the story progresses we learn details of each person's life, and there's some pairing off, romantic or otherwise.

As they fly cross-country above an unending cloud cover, questions remain. Where did everybody else go? Why were these few left behind? What will be found once they reach their destination and will they even be able to land safely?

If you're a fan of Stephen King screen adaptations or of good mystery stories, THE LANGOLIERS is really worth seeing.",1361318400,,2397,5.042929292929293

Whoever wrote the hokey script must have figured this movie would only work on TV, where the over top melodramatic hokiness of it all would fit perfectly. I won't even critize the hilarious 'balls of teeth' villians that are so poorly done even by early 90's standards they actually DON'T detract from the movie because of the overwhelming sense of campiness and poor script writing that have been going on before they enter the movie. Just the most unnatural character reactions and overtly melodramatic, not-done-in-a-realistic way character writing that screams , 'this is made for TV fair'....The poor black man that died didn't even seem to get a second mention by the group! It's too bad this is so hokily done, because the story is actually very interesting (aside from Stephen King needing to tie in the goofy monsters to the premise).

Too, all King's stories seem to have the same themes for a simple reason. They are the only themes, at least the only one's worth writing about: life and its opposite, death; love and its opposite, hate.

686899,2,6303514723,"Time travel is usually depicted as big, adventurous trips to the past or the future, usually with convenient historical figures.

But there's nothing so glamorous about the time travel in ""The Langoliers,"" an eerie Stephen King miniseries about a plane that lands in a strange deserted world. The beginning, buildup and the climax are brilliantly spooky, but there are long stretches of people just standing around talking, and the aforementioned climax is way too early.

A plane is en route from L.A. to Boston, when almost all the passengers vanish. The only remaining people are a pair of teenagers, a bereaved pilot, a blind child, a schoolteacher, a mystery writer, an engineer, a businessman, and a psychotic yuppie. They manage to land the plane in a Maine airport (OF COURSE!), but find it similarly deserted.

But something is terribly wrong with the place -- clocks have stopped, food tastes flat, and all their surroundings look dull. Even worse, there's a faint roaring in the distance that is growing louder. As the passengers struggle to figure out how to return to normal, the ""langoliers"" (as Psycho-Yuppie Craig Toomey calls them) are approaching the airport. If they don't escape soon, they'll be devoured alive...

""The Langoliers"" is a story that probably could have benefited from at least a third of its bulk being chopped off -- the beginning is wonderfully spooky, the climactic clash with the langoliers is pretty freaky (even if they do look like giant raisins with sandworm mouths), and King's depiction of time travel is chillingly nightmarish even WITHOUT the langoliers.

But a lot of the middle section is just the characters wandering around the airport, speculating about what they can/can't do. It feels saggy and boring, and even Toomey's periodic violent attacks on the other passengers doesn't spice things up. And the last half hour is... well, kind of anticlimactic. Dramatic, but after the sudden appearance of the langoliers, it feels kind of letdownish.

Additionally, there are some basic continuity errors (so, guns don't work but knives do?), and  the idea of the mystery writer being able to unravel the EXACT NATURE of everything that's going on stretches credibility to the shattering point. I know he's a stand-in for King, but COME ON.

As for the acting, it's a mixed bag. David Morse gives a good understated performance as the beleagured pilot, Mark Lindsay Chapman has a lot of charisma as a British hit-man with a heart of gold, and Bronson Pinchot gives a freakily over-the-top performance as a businessman who tumbles over the edge of insanity. Most of the others are either underused (Frankie Faison, Dean Stockwell) or downright annoying (everyone else).

""The Langoliers"" is an interesting idea handled rather clumsily, especially since it has a rather soggy middle section. But you gotta admit, parts of it was delightfully effective.",1294617600,3,2896,5.105708245243129

People say the acting is bad. I completely disagree. I feel the acting was perfect. Because it seemed so real. The things the people said were the most realistic I've ever seen in a film. Again, it's not my fave film but you can't deny that what happened in this film, the way the people acted, can totally happen in real life. If I were any of the females in this film, I would have acted the same exact way. Due to being afraid. All the females were scared and none of them were fake. They acted like normal people. Everyone acted like people could be in real life. I see no flaws whatsoever in the acting.

People are saying this film isn't scary. That couldn't be further from the truth. The movie is very scary. There are different kinds of scary. You have jump out of your seat scary and then you have psychological kind of scary. This film is psychologically scary. Just to be at this completely abandoned airport where even the air quality is different and sounds are different and no echo. That is very scary. I get scared thinking about this and picturing myself there. It's terrifying. The whole atmosphere is completely scary in itself. This film is definitely scary.

People say the music score in this is horrible. Again, I completely disagree. The music is very unsettling. I feel the music was perfect and nothing is out of place. That music that plays when you see the langoliers and the plane takes off is very intense. I love it.

People say the special effects are horrible. Once again, I completely disagree. I feel they add to the film and especially when you are watching the langoliers eat at the airport itself while they are waiting to take off down the runway and then that whole time they are going down the runway and taking off and seeing the earth itself getting eaten away, I'm at the edge of my seat. It's such an intense scene and can't look away. I love it.

Well, I must be the only one who can 100% enjoy and appreciate this film. I find nothing wrong with it. And it's not even my favorite King film adaption. But I love it 100%. There is definitely no need for a remake.",1272240000,8,2231,4.353365384615385

686962,3,6303514723,"This min-series came out way back 1995, after a string of highly rated King T.V. movies(It, The Stand, The Tommyknockers, Sometimes They Come Back).  This film isn't as good as The Stand or It, but it's about as good as The Tommyknockers.

It comes from a short story contained in King's book Four Past Midnight.  And you can tell that the plot was stretched to fit a two night mini-series and what ended up being a three hour film on DVD.  The problem with this adaption is that there's way too much exposition on a story that ultimately would've made a really good episode of The Twilight Zone or The Outer Limits.  Dean Stockwell plays a mystery novelist and he has no character to play beyond that of Mr. Exposition.  It's a credit to the actor that his performance is fairly engrossing and likeable considering his only function is to explain the plot and weird goings-on.

Actually, the acting in this film is all good.  David Morse is a very underrated actor and he does well in these type of ensemble pieces(he was also in the film adaption of King's Hearts Of Atlantis).  Bronson Pinchott gets to steal all the scenes he's in with the usual King psycho with daddy issues.  He's much more frightening then the title creatures when they finally arrive towards the beginning of the third act.  Special notice must also be given to Mark Lindsay Chapman as a British 'cleaner'.  He has the most complex and interesting character in the story and his arc, while slightly predictable, is very satisfying and well performed.

The film was directed by Tom Holland(Fright Night, Child's Play, The Temp, Thinner).  He does a good job in getting fine performances from the cast and he keeps the pace moving despite the over-long running time for the thin story, but he doesn't fare as well in the screenwriting duties.  The film just feels over-long, and the adaption stretch marks really show, especially when watching it in one sitting without the two night mini-series break up.  There's some clunky dialogue here and there, and certain characters just seem to be in the film to be part of a body count.  Hell, he even committs the age old horror cliche' of having the black character bite the dust first.  The film isn't really scary.  It's plot is more Sci-Fi, even though there are monsters afoot in the plot.

The monsters are unfortunate.  All throughout cinema it's been an old addage that monsters are more scary off screen then when they're on, and it's always smart to keep them in the shadows for as long as possible(Jaws and Alien are two really good examples of this).  Holland keeps his time eating critters off screen for most of the film's running time.  They work when they're just noises in the background getting louder, and when only their effect on the universe the film takes place in is seen.  So, the monsters show up and they don't live up to what your imagination sees, but it's even worse, they are some of the worst computer generated creature ever committed to celluloid.  I can't be too harsh on the visual effects in this film, it was the mid-90's and this was a television movie, but these things aren't even a good conceptual design let alone a believable special effect.  Luckily, I'm still equiped with my imagination and don't need pristine and super realistic special effects to appreciate a good story.  Did you hear that George Lucas? Screw the modern brain-dead video game addicted youth audiences, just write a good story and the rest will fall into place.

The disc itself is nothing to rave about.  Mine is the Canadian release.  It's full frame, but I'm not sure if this film was ever intended to be in widescreen.  Plus, the full frame formatt seems appropriate and all the compositions seems to be designed for it.  The transfer is decent.  You only get some grain in the stock shots of airports, landscapes and flying air planes.  You can tell that they were filmed on a different stock then the bulk of the film.  Luckily, the whole mini-series is on one side of the disc, unlike It or Storm Of The Century.  Also, all the commerical breaks have been smoothed over and edited out of the film so it flows evenly.  I really wish some other min-series, especially King min-series, would've done the same.  DVD editions of The Shining, The Stand and Rose Red are loaded with special features but don't edit out the commerical pauses.  It's really disconcerting that a bare bones affair like The Langoliers went to the trouble for this but the bigger releases of the above mentioned don't.

So, if you have a long attention span and can overlook some long expositional scenes, and you don't require your special effects to be so hi-tech that you lie yourself into believing that they are real, then this is a decent time waster.  But, I would recommend reading the short story.  It's more to the point and its concepts involving time travel are truly novel and unlike anything I've read on the subject.",1243641600,2,4944,4.674768518518518

Ten people fly through a timerip and discover that everyone that was awake disapeared.
My favourite part is when the get to the strange world where the Langoliers come and get them. The air is strange, there is no echo, no power unless you are on the plane, when they walk on the ground their feet sound different to normal, the weather goes dark then light again after 40 mins and the food and drinks are flat.
My favourite character is poor poor Mr Toomey. He is a wreck because his father brainwashed him telling him if he doesn't buck up his ideas and stop wasting time, the Langoliers will get him and eat him alive.
The part before they leave you see the Langliers and the chase Mr Toomey, you see the Langliers teeth move all around in a circle and they sort of make a creepy noise and clash their teeth together. The eat up the airport and eat away the strange land and every one except Mr Toomey and Mr Gaffney (Mr Toomey stabs him thinking he is a Langolier) get away.

Dean Stockwell overplayed his role, but was still the most likeable character in the group. Bronson Pinchot totally redeemed himself after that eighties-sitcom disaster, and Christopher Collet and Kimber Riddle did a realistic job of playing teens. (The only one who annoyed me was Patricia Wettig.) The filming was another issue; there were some glaring bloopers such as shadows of people moving beyond the Bangor airport's glass doors and a few cars driving in the streets of 'deserted' L.A.! The computer-generated Langoliers and sliced-and-diced airfield? Terrible. But the plot and dialogue were for the most part very loyal to the novella, which I have reread so many times it is falling apart.

The only folks remaining are 10 people who happen to be sleeping at the moment the aeroplane passed through a time-warp. Fortunately, one of these is a qualified pilot who's ""dead-handing"" to Boston for his estranged wife's funeral. Naturally, he takes charge of the remainder of the flight.

No contact can be established with any ATC tower and the radar shows no other aircraft in the vicinity. So the pilot tries the military frequencies but still finds nothing! Given that there are no lights on the ground, he diverts from Boston-Logan to a less busy airport in rural Maine. Bangor seems totally deserted and there's something strange about the atmosphere; it's lifeless, there's no echo, beer tastes flat and matches won't light! Each character is developed well; one of the passengers happens to be a mystery writer (like Stephen King, who wrote the novel on which the film is based). He essentially narrates the plot making it quite easy to follow. Another is a 12-year-old blind girl with supernatural powers of perception. There's an impatient, mentally unstable banker with an important business meeting in Boston and a British secret agent who tries to take charge in this seemingly impossible situation. How can they return to the time-warp with hardly any fuel on board? Will doing so return them to the correct dimension anyway? And how can they fly the aeroplane back through the time-warp while all 10 of them are asleep?

687019,5,6303514723,"4.5/5 The best parts of 'The Langoliers' are the acting and the directing. This never feels like a TV show. It feels like a solid theatrical release that is at times, inspired.

This isn't perfect of course, but the only flaws that stick out like a sore thumb are a few odd lines of flat dialogue. This all adds up to about 3 or 4 minutes of drag out of a three hour release. This is important, as 'The Langoliers' is all dialogue, like a stage play. In fact, this could be made into a stage play with little effort. So the fact that the dialogue is almost entirely solid is very important. It is not the best you will ever hear in film, but it is good enough, that top level acting talent will make it great. That is, fortunately, exactly what 'The Langoliers' has in David Morse, Dean Stockwell, and particularily Bronson Pinchot, who deserved an Emmy for his performance. His character stole the show throughout, and his scenes in particular, were the most inspired here.

The directing is fantastic, though my only qualm is that airplanes land with the head pointing up, not down. Also, people have criticized the characters for standing at times too long before taking action. I offer that people really do stand around in shock when faced with a traumatising experience. It never gets drawn out too long, and someone is always there to shake the character into sense. Otherwise, the director and camera people make this feel like a theatrical release at the A level rather than some low budget TV episode. The visual representation is at times inspired at a level of 'The Shawshank Redemption', though particularily surrounding the Craig Toomy character and in portraying an empty world.

The driving point about your enjoyment of 'The Langoliers' sits squarely in the believability factor. It has a particular take on time travel that you must be able to accept, or you will start finding sillyness in the film. It doesn't need to be a true take on time travel, just a creative one IMO, and 'The Langoliers' is creative. This film manages to explain its theories rather well, so true or not, it understands the ideas it presents. Is this as good as 'The Shawshank redemption' or 'The Green Mile'? I have a very hard time making that comparison. It's in a category of its own.

In closing, Bronson Pinchot puts on one of the most fantastic acting performances I have ever seen in a motion picture. Chances are, even if this film is not in your interest, you will appreciate his performance. It's a classic.",1212883200,3,2512,4.650900900900901

It was done on the Twilight Zone for certain, and in fact this story had all the mysterious anxiety of a Twilight Zone story, or even something that might have appeared on ""Doctor Who"". It holds you from start to finish, as most King stories do.

I do have a few minor complaints, though. Like the old classic ""Curse of the Demon"", this film would have been much more effective if we never actually saw the langoliers (who reminded me of the animated scrub brushes in cleansing powder commercials), but left us to wonder whether or not they were part of Toomey's imagination.  I have never read the book, but it seemed to me that Toomey should have been a more sympathetic character, and why-oh-why did the Irishmen-pretending-to-be-an-Englishman come across sounding like an Australian?  I was also bothered by the fact that these people were returned to the Present, but no inquiries were made as to the whereabouts of all those missing passengers, not to mention the dead girl in the plane.

When this film first came out in the mid 90's, I was addicted to it.  I would go over to my aunt's house every weekend and watch it.  What made it so addicting to me, you wonder?  I've always had an obsession with the thought of wondering if somewhere in the universe a world EXACTLY like this one existed.  BUT, if there was a way we could somehow arrive to that mirror world, would EVERYTHING be exactly the same?  Wouldn't some things be different?  Wouldn't it be fun to figure out the things that make that world different from the one we've lived on for years?

The Langoliers is almost like that game where someone shows you two almost-identical pictures and you have to find the one minor thing that makes them different from each other.  That's a good way of explaining the point of this film.  To me, this is something EXTREMELY fascinating.  Imagine if I could somehow travel to another world exactly like Earth where all the continents and oceans are located in the same exact place, and arrive to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  Something about the city isn't quite right.  What's wrong?

Let's say, just like in the film, as I go around exploring the city in my attempt to figure out the difference between this abandoned and unsettling Philadelphia compared to the Philadelphia I grew up in, I keep hearing strange sounds in the background, and I have no idea what it is.  Wouldn't that be scary?  The sounds continue nonstop, and they get louder and louder as *something* gets closer and closer.  I have to hurry up and find a way out of there, because it dawns on me that this Philadelphia is actually a nightmare version of the real thing.  It turns out nobody lives in this nightmare Philadelphia, even though all the buildings and bridges are still standing exactly like they were in the real world.  But what's going on?

In the case of the movie, everything takes place at an airport.  Nobody is around, and the main characters continue to hear strange sounds in the background as they try to discover what's wrong.

They have plenty of opportunities, and even when the plane is in the air they seem more than capable of catching up with it and out-manuevering it. Shouldn't they have immediately gone after it after the last piece of land disappears into the void? Second, although the langoliers themselves were extremely cheesy, I would still prefer a world full of them and devoid of suicide inducing people as seen when they finally make it back to the present. Also, if they're in the future when they land at LAX, then how come all the buildings and trees and other objects are present (besides the people of course)when the ""world is waiting to be born?"" Shouldn't they be standing in a blackened void if everything has yet to exist?

Given the mixed bag of Steven King adapatations, I had low expectations for this 1995 TV movie. Turned out to be a pleasant surprise...

- Direction:  Nice job with pacing. Things move along briskly, and the three hours run time is over before you know it.

- Script: The editing of the source material is marginal and sensible; it is very faithful to the original story.

- Casting: Casting is damned near perfect except perhaps for the Dinah character who is somewhat grating but not disasterously so. The actors are pretty close to how I envisioned them.

- Acting: Nice job by the cast. Bronson Pinchot as Toomey is especially good along with Mark Lindsay Chapman as Nick.

- Special Effects: Better than expected for 1995 TV movie CGI effects. Sure, they're cartoony but given what the script called for them to execute on a TV movie budget using CGI, which was cutting edge at the time, they're fine. Do they compare with modern 100 million plus budget theatrical film effects from a decade later? No. But is this a realistic expectation? Again, no.

Not the worst King adaptation I've seen - not by a long stretch. To the contrary, this is one of the more credible TV movie stabs at science fiction.

687066,4,6303514723,"When one considers the anxiety that people have when travelling on a plane, plus the fascination many have with the idea of time travel, and then a master like Stephen King should combine the two into a story like ""The Langoliers"", it should come as little surprise that the 2-part made-for-TV movie adaptation of that novella (from King's collection ""Four Past Midnight"") should be the single best adaptation of anything in King's oevure to be put on the small screen.  It's not quite the blazing masterpiece of psychological tension and horror that big-screen King adaptations like CARRIE and THE SHINING were, but it does well enough for itself.

The story involves the saga of American Eagle Flight 93, heading from Los Angeles to Boston.  At some point during the flight, all but a few passengers onboard mysteriously vanish without a trace.  Those that are left over, including an American Airlines pilot (David Morse) are left to wonder what's happened, and what to do about it.  But doing either becomes no easy task when they risk an emergency landing in Bangor, Maine, only to find the place deserted, the clocks not moving, the air completely still, and a monstrous force after them.  There's also the matter of their psychopathic passenger Craig Toomey (Bronson Pinchot, in a performance that makes Jack Nicholson's arguably over-the-top performance in THE SHINING look restrained by comparison), plus the theory, later proven to be true, raised by a mystery writer (Dean Stockwell) onboard, that the plane somehow travelled through a ""time rip.""  The suspense of THE LANGOLIERS is predicated on how this intrepid group can fly back through the ""time rip"" to Los Angeles, and not get eaten alive by the monstrous force of the film's title.

As said before, the story would have lent itself to an adaptation, television or otherwise, just on the basis of combining time travel intrigue and air travel anxiety; throw in some added hysteria and paranoia, and the result is pure King mastery.  Although Pinchot's, and occasionally Stockwell's, overacting are drawbacks, they are minimized by the very concept of the story, adapted by director Tom Holland, and the very good acting by Morse as the by-the-book pilot, and Patricia Wettig.  The visual effects work is superior for a television adaptation, and the film also features a witty Hitchcockian cameo for King as a business executive ghost whose haunting of Pinchot is the basis for Pinchot's psychopathic behavior.

All in all, given how often King has found his works adapted for both big and small screen, THE LANGOLIERS seems hugely refreshing, and is, despite its flaws, consistently suspenseful in the manner of ""The Twilight Zone"" and ""The Outer Limits.""",1142121600,3,2725,5.073825503355705

1:).I WAS AN EXTRA IN THIS MOVIE.In the final scene when the remaining characters appear at BIA I am the short teenager with the white and rainbow t-shirt,glasses and dark curly hair that walks past. Lol call it my five seconds of fame.

2:)Okay sort of in response to another reviewer I met Bronson Pinchot on the set. We had a short conversation and he was full of questions about his demanding role. And yes he throws alot into it but it is an intence character and I think his performance is genuinely frightening as Craig Toomey!

3:) Now to the blind girl Dinah. Let's begin shall we-children and psychics (especially when combined) are ALWAYS everyones least favorite characters for some odd reason. Well I will have to disagree-without her the film wouldn't hold up.

4:)Dean Stockwell plays this babbling mystery writer who thinks he's Sherlock Holms,always seeming to have all the answers. Which is fine except Dean Stockwell always does that in everything.

5:)The character of Rudy Warwick (to me) is the most utterly useless character. 99.9 % of his dialog revolved around the need to fill his stomach. Why was he even there-bad comic relief?

6:)I read the story and in that Craig Toomey had two abusive parents. So to save money what do they do here?Combine them into one psychotic father role.np though-difference make the world go 'round.

7:)Great story,interesting scientific theory (though more sci-fi then horror in alot of ways) but the special effects are laughable-they were even then. It looked like discount late 80's computer animation. Only the 'time rip' borders on close to convincing. But the plane looks like a cheap cartoon when it's flying.

8:)Despite it flaws there were enough points in this movie to sell it to me. And being in it yes I was a little biased. I enjoyed watching it. Besides I always thought if I were to me in a movie it would be my kind of movie which this basically is.

  To end my critique 'The Langoliers' might have benifited from a full theatrical production with some more proffessional actors but for a springtime made for TV movie this gets the job done. But some of the actors shine high above others so some of the more lousy acting (as in some of the supporting people) stands out more. Otherwise recommended!",1133049600,8,2369,4.725728155339806

I researched the internet and found it was in an old format that is now unreadable by newer DVD players (don't ask me, I am not terribly literate on DVD formats).
To watch the movie, I had to save it to my computer's hard disk in 5 gi-normous chunks (it would not save the whole thing to one file folder), then download freeware that I used to convert the format to something that Windows Media Player Classic (yes, folks, that's right - tho original WMP from the Windows 95 operating system - had to download that, too).

ONe chunk could not be read from the DVD because a sector was bad (?) so I am missing the whole first part of the movie.

I then converted each file folder using the freeware, and to watch the movie,  I have to sit at my computer and watch it on WMP Classic from 1995, and click on the next file folder as the previous one finishes.

Took me hours of research, but I love the movie so much, I had to get it to work.

687069,2,6303514723,"I absolutely loved the source material, despite the pulp-fiction style of writing - or maybe because of it - and couldn't wait for it to be made into a movie. So first, here's what was good:

1) David Morse and Patricia Wettig were ""OK"" (see below, though, for disclaimers).

2) It was probably truer to the source material than most adaptations.

3) Stephen King's cameo was somewhat entertaining.

4) Bronson Pinchot really shows a side of him you never saw from Perfect Strangers. There's some potential there.

5) Despite the ""bad"" points below, I can't help myself from watching it when it's on.

And now for the bad. Wow, there's so many to choose from...

1) David Morse, although he was the best thing in the movie and I generally enjoy his performances, didn't have much to do. He also has the unfortunate tendency to continually make a kind of strange surprised/disgusted face that make him look like he just accidentally sat on a pickle.

2) Patricia Wettig is in full ""thirtysomething"" mode here, with little to differenciate this character from her other one. I half expected Timothy Busfield to suddenly sit down next to her on the plane.

3) The girl who plays Dinah. Oh, GOD is she annoying. And she almost overacted worse than...

4) Bronson Pinchot. Despite showing some new acting chops, he's WAAAAY over the top here. William Shatner would wince at this performance.

5) The special effects, namely the Langoliers. As was already pointed out, they are indeed just giant meatballs with teeth in this version.

6) The cliched characters: The misunderstood ""punk"" girl. The geek with hidden bravery. The unbearably pompous mystery writer. *sigh*

7) Dean Stockwell is awful here. Or rather, his lines are awful. Apparently he needed some money after Quantum Leap was cancelled. ""My Dear Boy..."" ????

8) Much too talky. They could have cut the running time in half and made it more interesting.

9) That Dinah girl was SO annoying. Did I mention that?

10) The ending. Sappy, sappy, sappy. Not joyous relief - just sappyness. It suddenly changed from a horror movie to an episode of Eight Is Enough.

I sincerely hope someone remakes a movie version of this that can do the book justice. It really is a great little story. But this version doesn't cut it.",1124064000,6,2272,4.7846153846153845
687070,3,6303514723,"This is one of my favorite Stephen King stories, from the terrific collection of novellas, FOUR PAST MIDNIGHT.  However, the ""mini-series"" create therefrom is not too great.

I saw this show when it first aired, over two nights, and I wasn't super thrilled with it then.  Watched it last night on DVD, thinking that with nearly one hour of commercials missing, it might be more entertaining.  Well...it was shorter, but the flaws were still there.

Basically, the story is fairly solid, if a bit ""talky.""  They spend a lot of time in the ""what do you suppose happened"" mode...which I think is mostly to stretch a 2 hour movie over 3 hours.  The pace is pretty dead throughout the middle of the story.  The premise itself is solid (if silly).  Ten passengers on a cross country flight wake up to find their plane totally empty, and the world below them apparently devoid of habitation.  This is quite creepy.  They land in Bangor, Maine (where King is from, of course), and proceed to conclude that they seem to have passed through a portal into the past...which is ""winding down"" so that nothing really works like it should.

The theory isn't all that credible, even by the standards of such things, but you just go with it and say ""whatever.""  One of the passengers, Craig Toomey, is an insane stock-broker type who has spent his entire life bullied by his father, and it's turned him into a major jerk, possibly a homicidal one.

This is all well and good.  As with mini-series made for TV, the acting is spotty.  David Morse and Patricia Wettig make out the best.  Morse has always been an actor of quiet power, even in ""silly"" roles, and there's a reason he's made a pretty successful transition to the screen.  He's likeable and grounded.  Wettig is natural as well, even with some TERRIBLE dialogue.  It's too bad we don't really see her anymore.

Bronson Pinchot plays Craig Toomey.  I would be hard pressed to think of a performance MORE over-the-top than his.  He makes Jack Nicholson in THE SHINING look restrained.  He is absolutely laughable and miscast.  This is unfortunate, because his part is so crucial to building tension...but the boat is missed there.  What was needed was some ""gravitas"" to go with the wacky behavior...not just wild histrionics.  Oh, well.  Dean Stockwell plays the mystery writer...which qualifies him, apparently, to be the guy who figures out what's going on with them.  This he does with long stretches of speeches, beginning with ""my dear boy.""  He's the type of writer who wears bad sports coats and arches his eyebrows alot.  Do writers like that REALLY exist?  Anyway, I usually like Stockwell, but he seems a little lost.  The rest of the cast are mostly ""unknowns"" and for good reason. The young lady who plays Dinah, a pre-teen girl who is blind but has some psychic abilities, is quite, quite dreadful.  I hate to knock a child...but all these years later, she's a grown-up, so I don't feel so bad!  It's a horrible performance in another crucial role.  And at one point, she is badly injured, and spits up a batch of blood.  A swipe of it is left on her face for the entire rest of the movie...even when the rest of her new friends carefully tend to her...no one thinks to wipe the blood from her lips!?

Finally, the special effects.  Now I know that TV movies can't afford much.  In this film, though, we spend about an hour waiting for the appearance of the dreaded Langoliers.  When they show up, they are the absolute bottom of the barrel computer generated garbage.  Any tension that was built is COMPLETELY obliterated.  I've seen plenty of movies with lousy effects over the years..some from the age of bad effects (by our standards today), some from low budgets, and some from over ambition.  I don't know what went wrong with the Langoliers, but the effects are awful.  I mostly felt terribly sorry for all the actors who worked so hard creating terrified reactions, only to be totally betrayed by the effects in post-production.

I can't really recommend the movie.  It has some good, fun ideas, some good performances, and for a TV movie, at least a few moments of ""good stuff.""  The first 30 minutes, and last 15 or so are pretty solid.  But it could have been SO MUCH MORE.  I'd love to see a theatrical version, at proper length, with a decent cast and good effects.  That might actually generate the required thrills.  But I imagine this television effort will have forever soured the chances of this.",1123632000,,4469,4.671373555840821
687124,4,6303514723,"Because this story was written by Stephen King, you'd expect the kind of horror like ""Carrie,"" ""Christine,"" ""Cujo,"" or ""Tommyknockers,"" but his writing also took a Twilight Zone-type of dimension like ""The Dead Zone,"" and that's what we have here. A handful of people wake up during a flight to Boston and discover everyone else has disappeared, and when they land at Bangkor, Maine, the airport terminal is deserted, time seems to have stopped, and sound doesn't reverberate or echo. It's a wonderful, well-paced Twilight Zone-type mystery that seems like it was penned by Rod Serling, Charles Beaumont or Richard Matheson, and not Stephen King (who has a cameo appearance as a board member). And it does seem to be a very slight retread of the ""Twilight Zone"" episode ""The Odyssey of Flight 33,"" but this is far more elaborate than that episode and can stand as being unrelated. It would have gotten a 5 rating if the special effects of the Langoliers did not look so fake, unscary and cartoonish.

687126,4,6303514723,"Everything was really good about this film. A good Stephen King adaption of the book which really made you realize that they were all alone in the world of the past. For a movie to do that is pretty hard. And what really got me is the mysterious music, and don't ask me why, but the music is usually what always attracts me to a movie. As for the effects, well they're as flat as an old tire. You still get the idea of the Langoliers though.

American Pride flight #29 to Boston is a seemingly normal flight to Massachussets until about 19/20 of the passengers disappear. In the midst of it all, the ten passengers that are left find on landing to Bangor, Maine for a less busier airport, that everyone else had disappeared to on the ground. To add up to the problem, nothing works anymore. Matches refuse to light, eletrical equipment refuses to turn on, sound defies logic by not echoing, and the air has no odor to it even after just landing. And not only are the people gone, but it seems all living life has disappeared too. But upon exploring the matter more, maybe what has happened has happened to the ten survivors of flight #29, and in the spiralling vortex that has the ten trapped, there may not be a way out for the even approaching evil in the emptiness of this world.

I really like the concept of time travel in the book (which was also very good, a part of the novella Four Past Midnight) and how you cannot hope to time travel and find that everything is once what it used to be.

I always wonder where Stephen King gets these crazy ideas of his, but I find it just comes by simple things complicated into being something different which is how I found the fourteen year old author within myself by the help of Stephen Kings inspiration. His movies may help a little too, but won't scare you nearly as much as the books do, take it from a huge Stephen King fan.",1094428800,3,1879,4.317280453257791

687128,5,6303514723,"I am a big Stephen King fan, and I have to say that I enjoyed The Langoliers very much.  Based on the novella in Stephen King's book Four Past Midnight, The Langoliers is the tale of 9 people on a red-eye flight coming from LA who awaken to find themselves all alone on the plane--everybody, including the flight crew, having disappeared when the plane flew into a mysterious ""time rip"" that was directly in their path.  Luckily for the others, one of the passengers happens to be Captain Brian Engle, a pilot dead-heading home after receiving the news that his ex-wife was killed in a fire.  When Capt. Engle takes over the controls of the plane and diverts their flight to Bangor, Maine, that's when the fun and suspense begins.
Although I have to agree that the special effects were rather obvious and cheesy, I felt that the story and acting more than made up for it.  David Morse was great as Capt. Engle, the pilot who finds himself in a situation that he's never faced before.  I loved Mark Lindsay Chapman as Nick Hopewell, the British government ""assassin"" who suddenly finds himself re-examining his life as the langoliers come after him and his compatriots aboard the plane.  It was very nice to see The Secret Garden's Kate Maberly as Dinah, the young blind girl with a power that may help save the others from what's coming.  Patricia Wettig handled herself quite well as Laurel, the schoolteacher that takes Dinah under her charge, and who Nick finds himself falling for.  Quantum Leap's Dean Stockwell was wonderful as Bob Jenkins, the mystery writer who seems to be the voice of reason among all the others.  I had a few concerns at first about Bronson Pinchot as Craig Toomey--my first thought when I saw him was OMG, Balki from Perfect Strangers is playing a crazy guy--but as the story went on I felt that he did quite a good job with his part.
In the end, I thought that The Langoliers was an excellent piece of storytelling, even with the cheesy F/X, and one of Stephen King's best miniseries to date.  It's a keeper, folks.",1047168000,13,2045,4.6088154269972454
687129,5,6303514723,"This movie was the GREATEST movie of all time. The most FUNNIEST of the characters was none other than Craig Toomey.

As well as the ""meeting"" on the runway at Bangor Airport when he crazily said ""I LOST $43 Million Dollars1,and I did it delibarately!""

687131,5,6303514723,"For some reason, I find myself watching The Langoliers again every few months.  Almost inexplicably, it has become one of my favorite Stephen King miniseries.  The plot has a couple of holes big enough to consume the giant time rip that causes all the problems in the first place, and the actors overplay their characters almost to a man, but the concept of the ""langoliers"" themselves lends a fresh little twist to the sometimes hackneyed concept of time travel.
David Morse outshines the rest of the cast in his role as Captain Engle, although Bronson Pinchot (in quite a breakout role for him at the time) is wonderful (albeit irritating) as the deranged Craig Toomey.  Pinchot really goes for all the stops in making his character as noticeable and loud as possible, and he begins to learn the secrets of making your face reflect madness toward the end.  The quirky Dean Stockwell is another overactor here; playing a mystery writer, he hems and haws, striking Rodin's Thinker-like poses all over the place, invigorating even his most trivial comments with a sense of dire importance.  Mark Lindsey Chapman is not bad, nor is Patricia Wettig.  Kate Maberly plays the young blind girl Dinah; this character has the distinction of being the most annoying character I have ever encountered.  I earnestly dislike her character, which makes my fondness for this movie so surprising to me.  I would be remiss if I failed to mention Stephen King's appearance; it is one of his best cameos ever, in my opinion.  He plays a bank president, but his appearance can only be described as cheesy, reminding me somewhat of the character he played in Creepshow.
DVD technology actually detracts from this movie somewhat; the langoliers, when they finally arrive, look much cheesier than they originally appeared on television and VHS.  This does not really harm the story, though.  Despite its flaws, it is a story I find fascinating.  This movie is probably a little long for some people's taste, coming in at three hours; despite its length, character development actually leaves something to be desired.  Some of the dialogue is rather forced, as well.  Thus, I can easily see why some folks don't jump up and down praising The Langoliers, but somehow it manages to entertain and intrigue me every time I watch it.  It offers an unusual twist to the done-to-death subject of time travel, and I think that is what keeps me coming back.",1034121600,50,2425,4.866180048661801

It is incredibly cheesy, and not in a good way.  I am a huge fan of Stephen King and recommend some of the other miniseries that better personify King's work such as The Stand (though it is quite long) or Storm of the Century.  While these other movies are better, Stephen King's books are always much more stimulating.  There are just too many things going on in a character's mind that cannot be filmed.  The only saving grace of The Langoliers was Bronson Pinchot who brilliantly played a psychopath.

687193,4,6303514723,"Stephen King is best known for his books of the macabre, but what some people don't know, is that he's also a master of comedy - as is the case with ""The Langoliers"".
The book was a very complex and hilarious study of the human mind.  The movie delves even deeper, showing just how funny people can be when faced with eminent destruction.
Both the movie and the book ask the question, ""What would you do if you fell asleep on an airplane, but everybody that was awake, died, and that one of the people on your plane is a psychopath, and another is a blind girl who can sense evil, kind of like Haley Joel Osment in ""The Sixth Sense"", then you seek shelter in an airport, but all the carbonated drinks are flat and the food is spoiled, then you find out that these Pac-Man-like creatures (""the Langoliers"") literally consume the past?""
Well, what would you do?
It's a tricky question, and to be honest with you, I don't know what I would do.  But I can tell one thing, Bronson Pinchot (in a performance that's quite a departure from his beloved Balki Bartokomous character on the popular TV show, ""Perfect Strangers"") doesn't know how to answer the question either.  Man, does he go crazy - and I'm not talking Riggs in ""Lethal Weapon"" crazy - I mean he goes REALLY crazy.  You can tell that Pinchot really embraced this role for what it was and took method acting to an entirely new level.
Still not convinced?  After all the laughs and slapstick routines (the scene where Dean Stockwell drinks the beer in the airport is absolutely brilliant!), you are treated to a fantastic, suspenseful chase scene where the Langoliers chase the speeding plane down the runaway.

On top of that - the performances were very unconvincing (why does S. King insist on having a cameo in all the films made of adaptions of his books? He's a great writer, but he can't act!) except for Bronson Pinchot, who plays a perferctly neurotic Craig Toomy...",1024704000,,687,4.504

This has to be one of the worst Stephen King adaptations ever made, and that's saying something, what with 'Graveyard Shift'.  The premise is mildly interesting - a group of people on a plane enter a time rip.  All the people, everything has disappared and the Langoliers are coming.  For such a long movie, the suspense isn't very well racked up.  The mention of these mysterious Langoliers punctuates the film, with a mad man (the only good actor here) mentioning them fearfully whilst tearing up pieces of newspaper.  When the Langoliers finally do arrive, it's a major disappointment.  In a way, it's a shame that the movie wasn't given a bigger budget because the idea of these things crunching their way through the landscape to the small group of people could have been quite effective.  As it is we're treated to the bland imagery of an airport and the runways outside.  How are we to really believe that these people are trapped in a huge international airport.
What really brings this film down is how incredibly predictable it is.  The characters in it include a blind child, a young woman who becomes a pseudo-mother to her, the well-built hero and the mad wimp.  Yes, there's not one clich unaccounted for.  As all of these characters are two-dimensional then it's hard to feel any sympathy for them.
It's a shame really, because there are so many fantastic King adaptations - check out 'Carrie', 'The Shining', 'Misery' and 'The Shawshank Redemption' - but this lacks the humanity that past King films have been so full of.  It also lacks the mind-numbing fear that gives many King adaptations their edge.  Unfortunately, this is not only mediocre but also dull.  Avoid it.",1008633600,4,1763,4.753289473684211

687201,2,6303514723,"This film presents an interesting perspective on the unlikely possibility of passing though a ""time rip"" and what that might be like.  Unfortunately, it is basically a Stephen King short story that that has been put on a medieval rack and cruelly stretched into a full length movie.  Nine passengers and a pilot wake up from naps to find themselves alone on a jet.  They land at (where else?) Bangor, Maine, and find the airport is deserted.  As they attempt to figure out what has happened, it becomes clear that they are in grave danger and must depart the airport or be killed by whatever has taken everybody else.  As time goes on, the danger increases, time becomes shorter, anxiety rises, and real tension is building.  At least for the audience.  The characters in the story are too busy talking to take the danger seriously.  I found myself wanting to yell at the TV screen ""Quit standing around talking to each other and get out of there, you idiots!""  It's not their fault, of course.  In the absence of any interesting imagery (until the last 5 minutes of the movie), the story line can only be stretched out to movie length with lots and lots and lots of dialogue.  Even in the climactic scene, when a horrible death is imminent for all of them if they don't hurry, they stand around talking, and watching the destruction as it approaches, which is something only a person with one lone kernel of candy corn for a brain would do.  I found that aspect of the movie downright aggravating.",1005091200,3,1498,4.590225563909774

The actual premise of the film is excellent; It's intruiging, slightly disconcerting, and really makes one wonder what they would do in such a strange situation. What a fantastic plot then! But I guess that's down to Stephen King's ability to turn out a good story. However, then came the script. It was truly awful with some appalling lines.  In addition, the characters were pretty 2-dimensional. The chap from 'Quantum Leap' had one of the only vaguely intresting characters, though even this was dogged by poor scripting:""...My dear boy..."" Who speaks like this in the 1970's for heavens sake? Sorry, that should be 1990's, but I won't say anything about the special effects, as good scripting and sympathetic characters wouldn't have made that an issue.
The film has got 3 stars from me purely as a comprimise.  Some bits I would like to have given 5 stars, and others, well...!!!
I do feel sorry for the actors then, with the exception of the 'English' chap, who was rather poor even with the limited recources he had, and though I usually have a soft spot for Kate Maberly since I saw 'The Secret Garden', even her character became irratating. Again though, that was the script, not her acting ability.
After all that, should you see it?  Well yes, it's an enjoyable film with some excellent points, and some terrible points, and frankly nothing in between. Perhaps one to rent rather than buy, unless it comes at a very good price.",1005004800,,1512,4.759541984732825

As it is,it's an engaging enough tale,with amiable acting and cheap sets/special effects (check out the ''meatball'' monsters towards the end).Don't worry that it's directed by Tom Holland,who also helmed the appalling Child's Play and Fright Night,this time the story is told with taste and class,and at an unrushed pace.

It has Bronson Pinchot (Balki, from Perfect Strangers, Lois and Clark, and Step By Step) as an evil bad guy Craig Toomy, aside from his usual good guy rolls. Also staring Patricia Wetting (Thirty Something) as a school teacher named Laurel Stevenson, and Dean Stockwell (Quantum Leap). The plot line was a bit slow in most places but it really picked up at the end. Diana the blind girl played by Kate Maberly pretty much steels some scenes. It comes together nicely and interestingly tells the story of Time Travel and the little creatures called ""The Langoliers"" that are I guess a source of the Time Travel. It's always fun in Stephen King movies to pick him out, but he's pretty recognizable in this film.

687254,5,6303514723,"UPDATED Dec 6, 2017 FOR GRAMMATICAL AND STRUCTURAL REASONS. My views have significantly changed since the writing of this review, and I am a lot more Biblically grounded now. If you're not a Christian, do not concern yourself with that, just read my original review.

NEW REVISED REVIEW:

I'm going to let you know right off the bat, the less you know about this TV movie, the better, you might want to stop reading this review now. I first viewed it without knowing anything about it, and I was better for it. I was 11yrs the first time shortly after it aired, and back then, the effects were considered pretty decent for a television film at the time, some of them are laughably bad now, but in a way, this adds to the entertainment value. The movie spellbound me as a child, and I have watched it upwards of 9x's since then, not once have I been bored by it, though I cannot guarantee most people will feel the same, in fact, I doubt that they will.

Some of the acting in this is terrible, and no I am not talking about Bronson Pinchot, in fact, he is quite pitch perfect, over-the- top scenery chewing, scene stealer that actually elevates the film. The rest of the acting ranges from good(David Morse, Mark Lindsay Chapman, Patricia Wettig, and Dean Stockwell) to downright terrible (Kate Maberly who was previously amazing in ""The Secret Garden"", Kimber Riddle, Christopher Collet), and just OK (Frankie Feisman, and everyone else, save one.), and then you have Bronson Pinchot, whom is in his own universe really, literally and figuratively.

The premise to this whole mini-series, and the novella(I have read it twice), is both intriguing, and silly. Certainly time travel has never quite been present this way before, and it is very intriguing to watch it unfold. See how it effects each character, and surprisingly, this adaptation is almost completely faithful, save some minor details about characters. Practically all the scenes and dialog are in tact from the novella, but what make this adaptation a miss for some people, again, really comes down to the acting. It really takes this from being a serious movie, in to the realm of pure camp by the third act, but then it ends up being quite serious again for the last 40 minutes, you could say it is wildly inconsistent in tone, but given the material, it is consistent with it. If the acting was more consistent, and better people had been cast in the roles of Bethany and Albert especially, the movie would have been so much better. Casting Bronson Pinchot was a stroke of genius, and the film is largely carried on is tiny shoulders, every scene he is in is electric, and well, crazy.

The character of Craig Toomy is intriguing because, well, he is a terrible person, and not because he was abused, and in his mind, still is, no it is because he chooses to treat others based on that abuse. This is a man whom has lost all touch with reality by this point, and most people whom are abused, unfortunately, tend to lose touch with some aspect of reality, but it's not out of your control(I speak from experience), what makes this story so interesting, is no matter how campy it is, it is a very well-done analysis on abuse and what happens when you do not deal with past traumas. Like all King stories, however, Toomy is not the only one dealing with past demons, the others just do a much better job of handling them.

There is endless entertainment here, from the mystery aspects, to the camp aspects, to the time travel, to the langoliers themselves(as silly as the CGI looks now, I actually felt they were, stylistically anyway, accurate to the book), it is never a dull movie, unless you are off- put by the uneven acting, and cannot accept it as a camp classic.

687373,5,6303514723,"I am not a Stephen King fan in general. I liked 'The Shining', but that was really because I stand in deep awe of anything that Kubrick did. However, the Langoliers is quite something else and very, very special. If all King's stories could be like this one, he would be magnitudes more famous and popular (not that he's struggling for a buck now!). The sad thing is that it's a pity that the budget for this was curtailed to such an extent that it could only be released mostly in a mini-series format along with the de-facto mind-numbingly lame special effects. It's hard to believe that this film only goes back to 1995!! Anyway, to make up for it, the cast really do pour their hearts out in the acting and if you are going to see it for the first time, be warned, this movie will put you on the edge of your seat almost from the first moment till the very last. Also, the funny thing is that it stands up to being re-watched several times, and each time, you get almost a philosophical insight into the subtle points that King was really trying to portray. Not your typical American mini-series then, whose sole aim is to fill an evening slot and give your eyes somewhere to go to when you take them off the pizza. If you can bring yourself to look beyond the dodgy special effects, you will see creditable roles being played, especially by David Morse as the ice cool captain and Mark Lindsay Chapman as the even cooler Englishman who does exude a certain charisma and rock solid old world dependability and charm. An amazing performance as the deranged Craig Toomey by Bronson Pinchot. It'll be hard to imagine him ever again as the gullible and annoyingly idiotic immigrant in Perfect Strangers or as the effeminite guy in the Beverly Hills cop series. If anything, it was a bit too strong, disturbing and frightening the way he played the role and it shows exactly how dynamic his talents can be. In fact, the first time I saw it, I recognised the face, but I thought it must have been a different actor!! All in all, all the character definitions were good, the contrasts were crisp and to the point, and more importantly, the delivery was honest and credible. You could almost believe that they were who they said they were. Another positive thing going for this film is technical accuracy. I love movies featuring aircraft but I loathe the ones directed and produced by people who don't know the difference between a TriStar and a 737 or 747. So you'll see different planes in all the external shots and lots of different cockpits allegedly for the same plane. 99% of movies featuring planes are like this so you won't have to look hard. However, this one features a TriStar throughout, inside and out (even with the same paint scheme!). So it adds a tiny layer of believability and coherency. Verdict : Ace of the skies, go see it ASAFP.",982368000,22,2850,4.525193798449612

Such as when Mr. Toomy tries to shoot Albert, and he waits a full 5 seconds before saying ""I think I've been shot"" and falling. And Albert goes in search of a stretcher for young, blind Dinah (who has been stabbed by Mr. Toomy), armed against anyting with a toaster! A toaster, ladies and gentlemen.

687416,3,6303514723,"I have read the reviews given by others on this site and want to comment  on those first.  True, the special effects are terrible if you compare them  to Hollywood blockbusters like Armageddon or Star Wars but this film was  originally made for TV and therefore one should not expect spectacular  effects.  With that in mind, I would say that the special effects in this  film are passable.  I read the original short story in Four Past Midnight  and I loved it so I was very excited when I learned it was being turned  into a movie.  As any King fan will tell you, his amazing ability to create  characters is outstanding.  That however was the downfall of this movie.  The characters were great but most of the actors chosen to play them did  not even come close to doing them justice.  The only acceptable  performances in my opinion were David Morse (who later played Brutal on the  Green Mile, one of the best movies of all time) who played the Pilot Brian  Engle, Dean Stockwell who played Bob Jenkins, a mystery writer, and Mark  Lindsay Chapman who played Nick Hopewell.  The rest of the cast were just  horrible.  Despite the three aforementioned actors they still could not  have been expected to save this movie's characters with the horrible dialog  present in every scene.  This was obviously edited for television and  really took away the effect present in the book.  The bottom line: If  sub-par special effects, bad acting, and horrible dialog do not bother you  then check out this movie, it's actually not too bad all things considered.
