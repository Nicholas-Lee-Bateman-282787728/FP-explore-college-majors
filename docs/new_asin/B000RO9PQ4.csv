2872259,4,B000RO9PQ4,"Last night's bargain-rack movie was ""Buddy Goes West' starring Bud Spencer. I found the movie in the Wal-Mart five-dollar DVD rack. I'd never heard of the movie or of Bud Spencer and I understand that it is one of the ""Spaghetti Western"" genre. Well, I went into the movie taking it straight, but it wasn't very long before I was smirking at some of the scenes and the movie gradually turned into a rather funny parody of western movies and , actually, of the American West itself.

What  dreary place for a movie! Typically, the dust was so thick it was hard to see the scenery and the wind was always blowing. And the town! I've never seen such a dilapidated place. everything they did resulted in breakage and the collapsing of major parts of the buildings, or the building itself. How could anyone possibly live in this kind of a place? But hey, this was a bunch of Italians poking fun at our deeply entrenched western ideals and having a lot of fun doing it. And fun it was.

There was a lot of action and fighting with Buddy damaging a lot of heads and guts and shooting the guns out of bad guys hands. There was a major food-eating contest. In general, the acting was strictly at the B-movie level but it was amusing. Surprisingly, the cinema was fairly good, in spite of the overwhelming dust problems. It was an amusing movie. Don't take it seriously, or you'll never enjoy it. Just relax and let the absurdity take over.

2872261,5,B000RO9PQ4,"Bud Spencer is his usual adorable self in this spoof that is sidesplitting from the first to last frame.  Not meant to be taken seriously, this light hearted Western finds Buddy unsuccessfully attempting to evade a grateful but clingy native american side kick.  Together they (naturally) clean up Yucca City of it's mean guys while helping the Sheriff out (played by none other than Joe Bugner).  So many of the Trinity movies, involve eating scenes that are over the top.  This one really does top them all.  Bugner and Buddy get into an eating contest that does them proud.  High recommend if you love spaghetti western slapstick.",1242518400,,633,4.869158878504673
2872262,4,B000RO9PQ4,"Bud Spencer is one of my favorite actors. His typical manner is most amusing and I find his sense of humor really appeals. This particular movie did not include Terrace Hill, but it was still the same comical style and I loved it.",1241654400,,230,4.372093023255814
2872263,4,B000RO9PQ4,"1982 was the year:MICHELE LUPO's comedy western. BUD SPENCER is still superb and at his best since the TRINITY'S MOVIES.ENNIO MORRICONE provided the music score for this movie and as alway's put's his heart in all his music score's,it was different,but outstanding. It reminded me of MY NAME IS NOBODY,but with a BUD SPENCER theme. And as always,you can't have a western with BUD SPENCER in less there is a fight in the saloon,in the streets,but regardless of the odd's stacked or pilled up upon him,he always comes out either on top or ahead. This movie is outstanding for a 1982's spaghetti western,but it still shows the quality of the ITALIAN WESTERN GENERE regardles of the year,as long as you have an old pro like MICHELE LUPO.check it out you won't be dissapointed.",1192579200,2,772,4.81203007518797
