8618804,5,B00FW45W98,"I really loved this collection. The movies were all entertaining though some were better than others. All were low budget, some looked like they didn't have a budget, but all were entertaining. Normally in these collections there are duds but all of these are watchable. They had good stories and some were actually well done.

Dream Home, Fright Club, and Street Tales of Terror were the best films in my opinion. Fun and weird, like a B movie is supposed to be.

The only one I really had an issue with was Recoil. The film is so grainy that at times it was difficult to see what was going on. I did like the ending, but I think most views would've turned it off in the first ten minutes.

Kracker Jack'D  tried to be a funny slasher films but was really difficult to follow. It did have some fun jokes, but this one was my least favorite. It dragged in too many places, and I could barely finish it. To be fair, it really wasn't my style of humor. Some of the jokes were quite raunchy.

The other films were average and good for a viewing.",1444521600,,1042,4.295918367346939
