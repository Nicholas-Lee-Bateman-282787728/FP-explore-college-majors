This is a low-budget dvd set with a teal blue photography/set sheet wall/floor with two potted plants on either side. The sound is good & middle eastern music is playing nicely all throughout. She is dressed in a bra shelf & pants with a coin hip skirt. It feels like a simple class & she has good humor.

She uses a lot of detail for those who want to be perfect or perform, not just see bellydancing as fitness. She also always shows you in diff angles her body so you see.

Posture & standing poses: 5 min of posture & standing poses
Arm movements: 15 min of wrist circles, snake arms, front hand brushing & vogue arms (5 min, makes learning to pat your head & rub your belly seem natural/easy! Very hard.)
Turns & Spins: 5 min of basic 3 step turn w/posing arms, 4 min of turning in place w/S arms.
Walking: 3 min of softer walk & using hips more.
Body Awareness: Recapping about practice & take slow for your body for 1 min. Total is 34 min.
Performance: her in full costume on the same basic set showing all the basics she taught & more moves for 5 min.
Another Performance: on a nice stage in green dress she wore on a bonus performance on Rania's Hip Hop fitness dvd.

What she teaches is great, you can't get any more detail if you try, but there could be more content. This is not a fitness dvd by any means. Take off a star if you get bored easily.",1150243200,7,1449,4.186379928315413
8085233,5,B000BD1LL8,"The focus of Sohaila's instruction is on upper body hand movements and I've yet to see anyone else explain the hand motions as precisely as on this instructional DVD. The dance routine on the DVD does not include any step-by-step instruction, which is a true pity. I would love to learn the routine, although it will take quite a while to master. At least you can see what is possible and on that level, Sohaila is a true inspiration. Her dancing is delicate, sensual and has a deeply spiritual/joyful element.

If you are looking for additional instruction on the details of head placement, arm movements and foot placement, then this is highly recommended. I'd go as far as to say, this is one of the essential bellydance DVDs to look for when learning bellydance.

Sohaila has a unique teaching style and you feel like you are in the presence of a master teacher who is showing you her secrets. With a little patience, you may find this instructional DVD gives you even more fluidity and grace.

Sohaila's teaching style will especially appeal to anyone who enjoys Classical Egyptian Dance. The techniques seem to enhance self-esteem and the playful dancing techniques give you a little exercise. You can dance along with the second section where Sohaila dresses up in her costume and gives you a glimpse of bellydance heaven.

You may want to follow this with a Dolphina workout. The Veil workout is especially fun after this one because it also focuses on upper body exercises and with both routines, you feel like you have a complete upper body workout.
