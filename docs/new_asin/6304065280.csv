7861121,3,6304065280,"Written/directed by Paul Morrissey and set primarily in a villa in Italy, ANDY WARHOL'S DRACULA has some inspired casting. On the other hand, skin flick specialist Joe D. may look handsome here, but that New Yawk accent is laughable! Joe plays a Socialist peasant who awaits the Russian Revolution's arrival in Italy. Only then will noble families like the one he works for get their comeuppance. But his ain't da main staw-ree.

This movie is known by a half dozen names. The original title, ""Dracula cerca sangue di vergine... e mor&igrave; di sete"" translates as: ""Dracula tries virgin blood... and dies of silks.""

SYNOPSIS--
Romanian Count Dracula (Kier) is ill from locally tainted blood. He travels to Italy with assistant Anton (Jeurging) in search of the ""wirginal"" variety- the only blood Drac can digest without getting violently sick. They bring with them the Count's casket ""bed"" and a supply of vegetables that soon runs out.

Eager for familial alliance with a rich foreigner, the cash-strapped Il Marchese Di Fiore (Di Sica) who has four daughters, assures Anton they are all good virginal Catholics. The old man doesn't know that his eldest two are a couple of putanas who bang studly servant Mario Balato (Dallesandro) and each other like crazy!

The Count visits with these alleged ""maidens"" one at a time; they innocently tell him they're pure. He responds with world-class hickeys. End result: scenes of ever-worsening sanguinal reflux. A desperately unwell Count is running short on Di Fiore girls and worse, Mario's figured out exactly what he is.

7861122,3,6304065280,"Not bad for the time, however,I saw and have the origial video in the original case. The film was rated X, I don't know if it was re-released at another rating. Probably a big hit because of sexy Warhol star, Joe Dellasandro. Filmed inEurope by Paul Morrisey who followed this with ""Frankenstein"" which, again, was originally 3D and X rated. Your basic Dracula scenario with star Joe D.having sex with two sexy twin sisters. Another innocent virgin sister is on Dracula's list until Joe D. comes to the rescue and saves the day with an incredible climax in which he chops off Dracula's arms. You must see the original version however, because they may have seriously cut some scenes out for re-release. Better than Morrisey's, ""Frankenstein"". Sexy, hot sex scenes. And look quickly for Polish film director Roman Polanski in a tavern playing cards. Interesting to say the least. Originally titled, Andy Warhol's Dracula, but I believe he may have just helped produce it.",1003190400,9,970,4.920731707317073
