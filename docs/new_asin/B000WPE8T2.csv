8224859,3,B000WPE8T2,"If you read the plot you'd think this film was interesting. It's not. Could've been a good film, but just tries too hard to make its' moments in a clumsy, earnest sort of way that always had me thinking ""okay, I've got it, let's move on now"".
Too bad really, as the actors do a decent job and the visuals are stunning at times.",1364256000,,327,4.125
8224860,1,B000WPE8T2,Boring. The whole movie was very slow. I was waiting for angels or the men to be an angel to help the kid. It was a little hard to understand their words.,1343433600,,154,3.84375
8224861,2,B000WPE8T2,"I bought this movie because it was recommended in a flier that I get from a nationwide christian book store.  I like purchasing Christian films just to see what is out there.  This movie is just confusing.  There are alot of irish sayings that add to the movie; however, I just don't get them.  Also from what I understand, one of the main characters dies in the movie, and the little boy believes there is a sign from heaven that the man went to see God.  However, the man was never saved so I did not quite get this.  The movie really does not provide an ending for the main character.  Also the movie had a few curse words in it.  If I am not mistaken, one teenager said f--k in the movie.  He was fussed at for using this word; however, a christian movie dropping a f-bomb is really not my favorite thing to watch.  I mean there were only like two curse words in the movie; however, the movie really does not make a good enough point to me to make it worth those two words.",1281398400,,977,4.148936170212766
8224862,1,B000WPE8T2,"I'm with Christine on this one. My wife and I checked this out from Blockbuster based on the pr paragraph on the reverse side, indicating three souls would come to ""healing of hearts and minds,"" which we did not see happen in our opinion. I could not understand half of the dialog. I don't want to give it away for those willing to waste 90 minutes. Rent something else.",1212278400,,370,4.3768115942028984
8224863,2,B000WPE8T2,"I believe there must be a great deal of Irish cultural subtext here. Even as an American of Irish descent, much of this was lost on me.

There were far too many loose ends.

Instead, I recommend ""Into the West"" and ""Millions"".",1206316800,,226,4.357142857142857
8224864,1,B000WPE8T2,"Totally confused by this movie. Explain it to me, what happened at the
end? Did the boy die? it sure left you hanging.
Don't waste your time.",1202601600,,141,4.2592592592592595
8224865,5,B000WPE8T2,"I thought this was an awesome movie!  Three different perspectives on death: Seamus' premonition of his own death from a heart condition, James' inability to deal with the murder of his father, and Darry's frantic attempt to run from being hunted down.  The interaction is interesting. James is a Protestant and Seamus (the Gaelic equivalent of James)is a Catholic--ingredients for a clash that is always on the verge of erupting but at the same time overcome by a fraternal attraction between the two boys.  James' sarcastic responses to Seamus' spiritual observations on life are brutally delightful, but Seamus has no fear of James' sarcasm.  Darry seems to be either unconscious or asleep most of the time (the three characters are in a boat for much of the movie), but James and Seamus do everything they can to keep him alive.  That seems to be an important element in how the two boys are dealing with death.

I'm sure I will watch it again, but as a rule I don't re-watch a movie until I've allowed it to sink in after some time.  Many may find the movie boring and uneventful, but I had no problem with that....most of us live boring and uneventful lives, after all.",1202601600,,1175,4.674757281553398
