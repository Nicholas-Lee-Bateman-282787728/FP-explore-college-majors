4518902,5,B0050Z2ZXU,"Judging by some of the previous comments here on Amazon, it looks like people have been wanting this film to be made available for a long time. I have had a taped -from -TV VHS of this film for years. Yes, it's sentimental and a bit hokey by today's standards but the film erases any doubt that John Payne was more than just a Pretty Boy and that he really could act when given a good part. He breaks your heart when Maureen O'Hara .... well, you just have to watch it.  If you love Miracle on 34th Street, you'll love Maureen O'Hara and John Payne teamed again in this film. They made 4 films together (To the Shores of Tripoli, Miracle on 34th Street, Sentimental Journey and Tripoli, which is not available on VHS or DVD). Tripoli was made at Paramount and was sold to Universal years ago for TV distribution & probably never to see the light of day on home video.
This film was re-made in the 1950s with Lauren Bacall called The Gift of Love (not as good as the original).

This has the same bare - bones packaging of the other films in the Fox Cinema Archives collection - no photos, no chapter index, no extras.

Thank you, Fox, for finally understanding that there is a market for these movies.",1356048000,20,1201,4.328888888888889
4518903,1,B0050Z2ZXU,I ordered a DVD from AuntiMame12.  It was quickly shipped as I paid for it the day I ordered it.  The DVD is of very poor quality.  It's blurry and fuzzy and very hard on your eyes when you try to watch it.  I've tried contacting the seller (AuntiMame12) twice and twice I've been rejected and told they are no longer affiliated with Amazon.com.  I will no longer use Amazon as they do not stand by their products or their vendors.  I will contact my MC account and see if they can resolve this.,1343433600,2,495,4.212765957446808
4518904,5,B0050Z2ZXU,"Don't let the melodramatic cover art fool you, this is an extremely well-made classic from 1946.  Starring the gorgeous Maureen O'Hara with her MIRACLE ON 34th STREET co-star John Payne, this film tugs at the heart-strings of any viewer.  O'Hara & Payne are a happy show-biz couple (he produces successful plays that she stars in), who are jolted by her sudden health problems.  O'Hara's character, Julie, sensing her own inevitable doom, decides to adopt a young orphan, Hitty played by Connie Marshall. to keep husband Bill company when she dies.  Well, she does pass away, but the last thing Bill wants now is a little girl to take care of.  All of a sudden, Julie begins to appear to little Hitty, giving her advice. and comforting her. as Hitty agonizes over her mother's death.  All ends well, after a dramatic finale at the beach.  The film runs 94 min., and is closed-captioned.  It also features the original 20th Century-Fox logo at the beginning, something that was lopped off when it was shown on Cinemax years ago  It also features William Bendix as Payne's good friend.  A good, decent film in today's era of Transformers and super heroes.  This film has a lot of heart.",1337472000,32,1184,4.754901960784314
4518905,5,B0050Z2ZXU,"I saw this in Hawaii In 1946. 7ys olds. It was so sad but rewarding beause it framed my life. I grew up wanting to love children and telling people to cry was ok.  Especially men and boys. Ohara and Payne were great. The love of a dying person to think of someone else and leave them with hope and togetherness was precious.

4518925,2,B0050Z2ZXU,"Awful, that pretty much sums this one up.  What a waste of talent; John Payne especially, who's always a dependable asset to most pictures, O'Hara is her usual, to sugar coated to bare after ten minutes, and the little girl they adopt is also too sweet for words, annoying as all get up, as well as unbelievable irritating to no end.  If only the child was  a boy and played by Jimmy Hawkins would this film manage a badly needed extra star; as it is, don't waste your time or money on this boring piece of junk, and there aren't even a single extra to add to the package.",1421280000,2,572,4.229357798165138

The picture quality was incredibly sharp. The story was wonderful and moving. I cannot understand why it is not more widely known.

The film is a favorite of mine from when I saw it with my Mother as a child in 1946.
I still find myself with wet eyes even today. The performances of O'Hara, Payne and especially Connie Marshall (brilliant child actress) are superb. The music evocative, the photography excellent and it wrings your emotions dry. The remake, A GIFT OF LOVE was a mere shadow of this film and is easily forgotten.

4518946,4,B0050Z2ZXU,"this is a rare early outing for O'Hara and Payne. it's a good film in it's own right. however, don't overexpect like i did. the basic premise of the film is engaging and might lead one to expect a little more than what's here. the acting is quite good but don't expect the performances to be as great as what were given on 'Miracle on 34th Street'. this one was actually produced and released the year before. William Bendix actually steals almost every scene he's in. the young actress who played the adopted daughter lacked a little in her performance but still managed to be effective. this is one for the individual to judge and that's where i'll leave it.

4518955,5,B0050Z2ZXU,"Those of us who saw ""Sentimental Journey"" in 1946 have never forgotten it. The film has an emotional impact difficult to forget.  Maureen O'Hara and John Payne (Miracle On 34th Street"") have the perfect chemistry with their performances making the story rise above ordinary melodrama.  The studio didn't want to make this film.  Their argument: ""Who wants to see a film about a dying woman?"" (I guess they forgot about a little picture called ""Dark Victory""). But the stars loved the script and pushed the project until it finally went into production.  To the studio's surprise it was a big hit.  At this time Doris Day's hit recording of the title song added unexpected free publicity and title awareness.  Maureen O'Hara is excellent in this role.  Her performance is one of the best she' ever given while her appearance and wardrobe are exceptionally beautiful.  This is a movie star!  There are times she takes your breath away.  John Payne is equally wonderful while the lovable William Bendix offers excellent support and humor.  Connie Marshall (""Mother Wore Tights"") is outstanding as the imaginative little girl. Production values are fine (if fans look closely they'll recognize the sets from 1945's ""Leave Her to Heaven"" being reused.) Despite it's hesitation the studio remade this film in CinemaScope and color in 1958 as ""The Gift of Love"" but the remake lacked the delicacy of the original.  In 1978 their was a TV movie but both faded into the mist.  For those who have waited so long for this DVD it's finally here and well worth it.  The print is very good but lacks an original ""end"" title (it's the same on all the prints I've seen but doesn't interfere). This is a true classic.  Get it and remember.",1357516800,7,1722,4.809523809523809
8452119,4,B0050Z2ZXU,"Review of Sentimental Journey
Hot Toasty Rag, April 25, 2018

Didnt John Payne and Maureen OHara make a cute couple in Miracle on 34th Street? If you thought so, youll be happy to hear they made three other movies together! In Sentimental Journey, they play a devoted married couple. Maureen wants a child, but John sweetly asks, Whats the matter, Mom? Have I gotten too big? Mama Maureen meets a young orphan, Connie Marshall, and completely falls in love with her. They adopt Connie, but she and her new dad don't exactly hit it off.

John Payne gives a wonderfully layered performance in Sentimental Journey. Its always more heart wrenching to see a man cry than a woman, isn't it? In this very heavy tearjerker, John sheds just as many tears as he inspires from the audience. He blends wonderfully with everyone in the cast; he and Maureen have a lovely and comfortable rapport as husband and wife, he and Connie enjoy a very special relationship, and he and William Bendix really seem like lifelong friends.

Connie, a very talented child actress, shows her incredible chops in only her second movie. Shes simultaneously childlike yet mature, a dreamer but wise in practical matters, and above all, darling and endearing. I don't even like children, and even I was won over by her sweetness. The next time you're in the mood for a good cry, rent Sentimental Journey. From then on, youll start blubbering at the suggestion of breakfast in bed, I guarantee it.",1524614400,,1463,4.774703557312253
