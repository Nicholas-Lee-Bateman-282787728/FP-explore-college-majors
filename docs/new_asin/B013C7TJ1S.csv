7361873,4,B013C7TJ1S,"Modest budget, sure, but fairly well done. Humorous and enjoyable. The fact that women are allowed to carry the movie by being intelligent and tough, as opposed to only focusing their beauty, is commendable. Movies that allow women that freedom are well on their way to receiving high marks from me.",1456876800,4,299,4.882352941176471
7361874,1,B013C7TJ1S,Low Budget Post Apocalyptic - There's much better in the genre,1456617600,,62,4.7272727272727275
7361875,3,B013C7TJ1S,"This is a bad cult film filmed in and around Erie, Pa. After WWIII, which looked a lot like WWII film reels, 3 women try to make it from the nuclear wasteland to the safe confines of ""The City"" ruled by a woman dictator who likes to hang out in a swimming pool naked. Along the way they have to battle other scavengers in the Wasteland who have a fight club. Rule 1: All female captors must be stripped. There are also cannibals whose faces look like they are covered with strawberry cream cheese. (You might keep some bagels close by.) They also have to battle some bad CG fire and gun fire effects. The girls, in real life, have martial art skills, but the fight scenes looked horrible when coupled with former professional wrestlers with speed ups and frequent pauses.

The plot ran weak. The special effects where ineffective. The sound could have been better. Metal/Death Metal music used for most of the fights except that junkyard battle which played the same riff over and over until it got annoying. Part of the excitement came from jerking the camera around.

""Apocalypse Female Warriors"" is the recycling of  ""Warriors of the Apocalypse"" which is typically a bad sign. Blockbusters don't get re-released under a different title.

The film boasted plenty blood and an over-the-top head shot that air gaps the ears.

Guide: F-bomb, FF nudity. More nudity and sex in the deleted scenes. 3 stars for the nudity. A film for bad film lovers. Not for everyone.",1452902400,6,1464,4.680933852140078
7361876,3,B013C7TJ1S,obviously it was very low budget.  But I did find  it more watchable than  some big budget films.  A lot about the film really sucked but in a way that it was kinda interesting.  I just want to know where they carried all the ammo they went through!,1483920000,3,249,4.104166666666667

7361903,1,B013C7TJ1S,"The BEST thing about this movie is the blood splatter special effects.  You've got three post-Apocalypse girls: The Almost Dreadlock girl, The Tramp Stamp girl and The Other one.

I could see how this could become a cult film.  But, if you're not related to someone in the cast there's really no reason to subject yourself to this obviously ""I wanna make a movie"" movie.

Enough gratuitous T&A to make the girl's dad's really proud of them.  ""Hey, Dad.  I'm in a MOVIE!""",1470960000,4,470,4.602409638554217

The acting is atrocious even for B flick standards.  I love low budget movies... but this... this is simply not a movie.  This is utter garbage.  The lady with the braids in her hair... yeah... well... NO  She can't act.  I can only assume she's related to the person who shot this because there really isn't a reason to have her in it.
