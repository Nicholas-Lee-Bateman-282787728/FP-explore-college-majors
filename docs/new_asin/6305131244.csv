8181565,2,6305131244,"This opera tells the story of the 47 ronin in an operatic (western) tradition.  A lot of the original story (as much as I remember it) is there, along with the world view that makes the story a Japanese classic.  With the exception of the introduction, most of the music is a very traditional style that could be used for a good quality musical.  The video work is interesting and uses a number of digital image effects that I found interesting and my wife found distracting.  I found the main fault to be the singing style and this ruined the whole opera for me.  The whole style is to use a consistently very wide vibrato which I believe I have heard in some other style of Japanese traditional theatre.  This simply doesn't fit the fairly simple line of the western style music.  It is done intentionally as you can hear, when one of the singers simply forgets and falls into a simple unornamented tone which is usually very accurate and pleasant to the ear.  It was nice to see the story again, but it was simply not worth it to me to here the long stretches of outrageously wobbly singing.",1007683200,,1094,4.435
8181566,5,6305131244,"Chushingura, the national heroic story of Japan, has been told for generations, in  Noh and Kabuki  Theater,  books, ballet, movies, and now, in opera.  The true story of 47  Samaurai warriors who plotted to avenge  their master's unjust execution, and their subsequent duty to disembowel  themselves , is a compelling glimpse into the oriental mind. The castle  where the avenging warriors fought is a national shrine, as is the  warriors'  gravesite.  Ceremonies and reenactments are an ongoing cultural  event in modern-day Japan. Now comes the story set to modern Japanese  music.  The opera itself is just one more take on a brutal, but  touching story, whose effect is not lessened by repeated exposure. The  warriors' resolve to complete their mission, (while contemplating the  sacrifice of  their own lives as restitution)  makes for some heavy-duty  operatic drama. The video is well-produced, combining the historical art,  philosophy and social mores of the Japanese people into a pristine  production with up-to-date staging, good acting and good singing. The music  is beautiful.  If there's anything about Japan that interests you, don't  miss this one!  It's a keeper!",962409600,3,1184,5.333333333333333
