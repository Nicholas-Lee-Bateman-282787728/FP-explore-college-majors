8664940,4,B00LBAGPPM,"4 stars for the film, 2 stars for the blu ray. Why so low?  Because the blu ray only has the full color version, and only a low-res dvd has the movie presented with the color tinting intended.  Also, the french subtitles are burnt over the picture and can't be removed.  Still... great and very weird film!",1505433600,2,306,4.333333333333333
