8376244,5,B002OOG6Z8,"Although this DVD was released in 2009, it is footage of  UB40's July 1981 concert in Cologne Germany.  It was filmed for the German Rockpalast TV series.

This concert took place in the early days of UB40.  The group had only just released their second album, 'Present Arms'.  So, most of the song on this DVD are from 'Present Arms' (which was enjoying the #2 spot on the UK charts at that time), as well as their first album 'Signing Off'.

DVD TRACK LISTING:

Present Arms
Tyler
King
Food for Thought
The Earth Dies Screaming
Don't Let It Pass You By
Lamb's Bread
Silent Witness
Sardonicus
One in Ten
Madam Medusa
Don't Slow Down
Dr. X
Burden of Shame
Singing Off

This concert took place just two years after their first gig in their hometown of Birmingham, UK.  It's vintage UB40 with young Ali Campbell as Lead Vocals, playing the Rhythm Guitar.  Robin Campbell is Lead Guitar and also Vocals.  James Brown is on Drums and Vocals.  All of them look so young! Remember, it's 1981 and UB40 had only just released their 2nd album!  You'll certainly enjoy this concert featuring UB40 as a fresh new act!
