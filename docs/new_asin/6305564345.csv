I never made it to a theater to see the low budget movie ""Comin at ya!""  so I don't know how good the 3D effects were on the big screen.  What I CAN  tell you is this.
As far as 3D effect goes, you would be better off  purchasing a ""Elvira Mistress of the Dark re-release of The Mask in  3D"" rather than put yourself through what on my DVD has to be one of  the poorest attempts at a 3D DVD ever.  Few if any of the scenes show any  depth, and the 3D transfer is almost always out of alignment (i.e. wearing  the 3D glasses makes little difference to the picture quality or view  ability).
I am only just delving into 3D as a hobby, and had greatly  anticipated this movie's release to the superior format of DVD. But the  fine folks at RHINO Home Video just couldn't pull it off.
I will be  returning my copy, and hope that a re-released corrected version will be  out soon!",939254400,4,1014,4.1020408163265305

Its a western like no other take it from me and its full 3D fun and slightly obscure filming shall we say looking pretty awesome.

They used a 4K high quality scan for it and its a corker of a transfer looking great. If you buy it don't take it seriously, it was made to show off 3D and it does just that well.

1056413,3,6305564345,"I never saw this film in it's original release, but I did own a video tape in the anaglyphic process that was basically unwatchable. This is actually pretty good. The 3D effects work very well and there are a lot of scenes where objects emerge from the screen. There seems to be a slight problem with the convergence of the images and while it doesn't spoil the 3D effects, it does cause a wee bit of eye strain. The film itself is interesting. There's very little plot but plenty of action, and there's some striking use of color combined with black and white footage. The director of this movie was responsible for making one of my favorite spaghetti westerns, ""Blind Man"" which also starred Tony Anthony as a blind gunfighter with a seeing eye horse and Ringo Starr as a Mexican bandit.",1485216000,,789,4.563380281690141

1056415,3,6305564345,"I was directly involved with marketing the 3D theatrical eq for the widest to date 3D releae at that time (1981)  in the US..so it made sense to purchase a 3 D copy of the film.  I also had an opportunity see see the early dailies as well. Despite poor reviews Comin at Ya! did was a hit and did well enough to jumpstart a brief 3D resurgence first  in 1982 with independent films followed by major studio releases in 1983. A number of the exteriors look good but when the in your face shots come in there is eyestrain & some people may not be able to handle it. The film was filmed in (uncredited on this disc) over/under 35mm system called Optimax..its prior use on martial arts films including ""Dynasty""  Comin at Ya! is a spaghetti western that at times is arty & surreal...and overloaded with sadistic violence...and forget great acting although Victoria Abril became an international star some time later. The revamped look of sections of the film seems un- necessary except in a couple of explosions.

Also missing is a 3D epilogue that highlighted a score that seemed to belong in a better film. The dialogue dubbing sounds better now but the overall audio mix is uneven.

But the reason for low marks is because it's a bad copy. It must of been made into a bluray 3D from the blue-green type DVD. I found it irritating and the background out of focus most of the time. And there were light spots (hard to explain) but there none the less from time to time. Also spots (smudges) on the left side of the screen.

1056512,3,6305564345,"I now own the new  Blu-Ray of COMIN' AT YA and have an excellent 3D setup, albeit the active-shutter style.  The movie is without a doubt as exploitative as it can possibly be with it's cheesy but very fun 3D effects.

As a fan of Spaghetti Western I also enjoyed the pseudo-Leone film style and the music in spite of the fact that  some of the film is in questionable taste or just plain ludicrous (the bats for example).

Tony Anthony, as always, makes a great wise-guy-anti-hero, and Victoria Abril is about as pretty and sweet as a heroine could be, simply lovely.  I saw this film when it very first landed in theaters back in the 80s so i knew exactly what to expect and, I'm not complaining.

But this is where I'm confused.

The film boasts of constant 3D pop-outs.  For example: hands, guns, arrows, snakes, watch chains, beans, baby butts and the ridiculous bats just to name a few.  Now, I also own the 3D film ""The Bubble"" and  in The Bubble, there is an incredible 3D scene where a tray of drinks seems to float out of the TV screen and hovers about five feet into the living-room. Its really amazing.

Although COMIN AT YA seems to be striving for this effect (at about three minute intervals) it never once occurs.  Don't get me wrong, the film has gorgeous 3D depth, making my TV look like a giant  view master but I was very disappointed that none of the promised 3D pop-outs went beyond the  flat panel of my 50 inch flat screen TV.  The movie would have been 10 times more fun if the 3D pop-outs actually popped out, but they didn't.

I am curious if others had the same experience and could explain why.  Feel free to comment in the comment section.  Thanks in advance.",1464912000,3,1689,4.372990353697749

1056514,5,6305564345,"I'm so grateful that this title finally became available on Blu-ray 3D. The 3D here is the real deal and is masterfully shot with full roundness and painstakingly prepared scenes. Some may complain of the exaggerated use of depth and ""in your face"" gimmickry but I applaud it because the movie itself is very, very good and stands the test of time... so it works and is actually entertaining! The unique storytelling greatly makes use of 3D, thus making this a ""true 3D movie"" unlike so many movies that just happen to be in 3D. Big difference! This type of 3D is best viewed in a darkened room, seated centered far from the screen. (I viewed at a distance of about 17ft from my 55"" LG 4K Flat Screen Passive Polarized 3D TV). Thank you to all involved in finally getting this film to Blu-ray 3D!!!",1464134400,5,798,4.472602739726027
1056515,1,6305564345,"I bought this film, having never seen it before, only because it sounded interesting. I watched the regular 2D version first only to see if the story can stand on its own without the 3D effects.

It's a terribly slow, dragging story that I barely made it though without falling asleep. Even more dull than ""A Fistful of Dollars"".

I don't know why anyone would call this a comedy.  Many innocent women were killed and nothing to really justify why.

So, later in the day, I watched it on my 3D TV in the living room.  The 3D graphics of this film was actually very uncomfortable to watch. They put alot of emphasis on having things reach out to you in the audience, but in most cases, I just saw a doubled up effect as if my eyes were crossed so I'd see two of the same thing comin' at me. So really, the 3D effect only made my eyes water and unable to focus on the effects correctly.

Well, this may be the worst film I have bought this year. So, I'll be getting rid of it sometime before the end of the week. I might be able to get two bucks for it if I trade it in as a used BD at Amoeba's or Rasputin Records in San Francisco.",1463011200,,1130,4.0675675675675675

1056568,2,6305564345,"Coming at Ya is not a great film.  It does have some cool 3D shots in it, but the problem is that the filmmakers tried to push the limits of 3D at a time when only mathematical precision would guarantee good results.  While pushing the boudaries works sometimes there is an equal amount of shots where the 3d gets difficult and straining to watch.  My respect to anyone being able to sit through the entire film, I could not.  Maybe watching it in segments is OK, but in one sitting it's hard.  The other thing I find irritating is all the dirt.  I can't imagine this was the AC not doing his/her job, it looks as if all this dirt is from some really poor optical intermediate.

1056574,4,6305564345,"""Comin At Ya!"" will not be a film to every taste. It is an energetic and enthusiastic Spaghetti Western, filmed in Spain with a mostly Italian crew and an international cast top-lined by two Americans you probably never heard of. It caused an unexpected sensation when it was first released in 1981, and its success ushered in the 3-D boom of the early 1980s, bringing us other, perhaps better films like ""Friday the 13th Part III"" and ""Jaws 3-D.""

""Comin At Ya!"" was filmed using Optimax III, a 3-D system that was capable of some surprisingly lovely imagery, when used with care and restraint. But one quality ""Comin At Ya!"" surely lacks is restraint. The filmmakers cheerfully take every opportunity to hurl things through the window of the screen and into the audience, and this is what makes ""Comin At Ya!"" a divisive subject even among diehard 3-D fanatics.

If you love pop-out effectswhat the 3-D technicians call negative parallax shotsthen youll find much to amuse you in ""Comin At Ya!"" But be forewarnedthe filmmakers got carried away in their enthusiasm, and very often brought objects much closer to the camera than necessary to achieve the proper illusion. This means the total parallax (or left and right image disparity) is very high, and this in turn means that some scenes are not exactly the easiest or most comfortable to view.

None of this is the fault of MVD, who have in my view done a commendable job presenting ""Comin At Ya!"" in this Blu-Ray disc. In addition to the high parallax values I mention above, there are other problems that just could not be fixed. Some shots have stray blobs of dust in one eye but not the other, to cite one example. But overall the image is sharp and bright, the colors as vivid as they ever were, and the elements used look reasonably clean and free from damage.

The story itself is an outrageous Western yarn involving a kidnapped bride and revenge against the white slavers responsible. One must resolve not to take it too seriously, and above all not to be too offended.

In summation, if you are a diehard 3-D fan, and certainly if you are a 3-D completist, ""Comin At Ya!"" deserves a place in your collection, with the caveat that you may find your eyes getting a tougher workout than you have recently experienced in any 3-D movie. If you are a casual 3-D fan, I still urge you to consider a purchase, as ""Comin At Ya!"" is historically important in the history of stereoscopic cinema. And you simply will not find a more energetic and enthusiastic compendium of off-the-screen, in-your-face 3-D shots in any other single motion picture.",1458000000,6,2600,4.705494505494506
1056575,4,6305564345,"Comin' at Ya is really a movie that carries its concept in its title - and it doesn't disappoint on this front, either: Basically, Comin' at Ya is credited with starting the 3D revival in the early 1980s, and the title doesn't lie, during the film tons of things are coming at ya, from guns to arrows to playing cards to yo-yos and everything in between. Back then, 3D was seen pretty much as a gimmick (and in hindsight, deservedly so), and its main purpose was to throw things at the audience to make them flinch ... and the film's just amazing about that! As opposed to 3D productions from let's say the 2010s, it just uses the technique to thrill the audiences by adding an extra layer of excitement to the theatergoing-experience rather than to wow everyone with the prowess of nowaday's CGI ... and that's great, really, as this way the audience gets something out of the experience rather then asking themselves if the premium ticket price was even worth it.

Now all that's not to say Comin' at Ya is a perfect movie, it's story, while not being dumbed down to the point of annoying, is pretty simplistic even if it had been a spaghetti Western from 15 years earlier, and probably wouldn't have been greenlighted without it's 3D gimmick, and even the 3D effects are often overdone - especially in the scene leading up to the finale where everybody seems to be compelled to drop something onto the camera quite leisurly, or a bat attack that made no sense at all, narratively. But at the same time, the whole thing is at least directed with a feel for atmosphere, and features plenty of suspense and exciting setpieces - so if you're in for spectacle, and for the fun that 3D once has actually been, then do yourself a favour by watching this movie!",1456963200,2,1756,4.539432176656152
1056576,4,6305564345,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

I was fortunate to be managing a theater when the second wave of 3D hit theater screens. Much like the first wave that took place in the fifties these films made the decision to use the special effect in gimmicks rather than integrate the format into the story. Items were thrown at cameras, things were dropped at them and there was even an eyeball that popped out of someones head towards that camera in FRIDAY THE 13TH 3D. Because the effects were gimmick related and due to the bad format being used that required glasses that gave viewers headaches it soon died. Newer technology has made the format popular again but even that is beginning to wane.

The first major release during that second wave of 3D wasn't from a major studio but was actually a spaghetti western that came from Italy. COMIN AT YA! used a tried and true story and then rounded it out with enough items aimed at viewers that many who had only heard of 3D rushed to theaters to experience it for the first time. It became an immediate hit and soon other movies followed suit only to disappear for reasons I stated earlier. But this little movie that renewed interest in the format should be included in the history of movies for that reason alone, that it brought it back to life.

Now MVD has brought the film to DVD for the first time. Not only that its being offered in 3D as well as blu-ray for those who own 3D televisions. This makes it the first time you can see the film that way since it was released back in 1981.

The story is simple enough. The wedding of gunslinger H.H. Hart (Tony Anthony) and his bride Abilene is interrupted by Pike and Polk Thompson (Gene Quintano and Ricardo Palicios) who shoot Hart and kidnap his bride. The duo is kidnapping women to be sold into white slavery. What is interesting to note about this sequence is that it is incredibly obvious that Quentin Tarantino used this sequence when filming KILL BILL. At moments it seems shot for shot the same as the killing of the bride from that film.

The rest of the movie revolves around Hart tracking down the bad guys and trying to retrieve his wife. When Hart discovers that the brothers are taking women from all around with the intent of selling them into the brothels of Mexico, he makes it his mission to save them all. A back and forth between his taking out men, being captured, escaping and taking them on again follows until a climactic battle that takes place in a ghost town.

At only 91 minutes the first question that should be asked is is there enough of a story here to make a feature length film or is it all gimmicks? The answer is yes, the story is well thought out and lives up to the movies of the time, westerns that were slowly disappearing even from Italy. Westerns for the most part always offered up simple stories of good guys versus bad. It was a formula that worked so why tinker with it?

But the amount of 3D effects in the film at times slows down what we get to see. Not only that, some of the gimmicks might leave you scratching your head as to why someone thought that was something people wanted to see. But thats because weve grown accustomed to the current wave of 3D films where the 3D is incorporated into the story itself rather than just tossed in to be called a 3D movie. The novelty has worn off and it now accentuates the story rather than propels it. Knowing that the use of it in this film makes more sense where it is used simply to show 3D.

There are several ways that are used to display the effect here, some good some head scratching as I mentioned. Among the bad are seeing things like beans of coins dropped from above towards the floor where the camera is located. Better usage comes from items like a snake hanging down from a board or arrows flying through the air towards the camera. Those were eye popping moments where audiences ducked while watching the film.

Tony Anthony does a great job here and should have become a bigger star than he was. Having made more than one spaghetti western, including several that involved the same character only known as the Stranger, he was a recognizable face. Why he left acting behind Ive yet to discover. He did invent a low cost 3D projection lens that was cheaper than the conventional lenses being used at the time so perhaps he made enough off of that to retire early. If such was the case it was a loss to fans of the genre and of Anthony.

This release offers little in the form of extras but with both a regular blu-ray and 3D blu-ray included in the mix its worth it for fans of 3D and for collectors alike. Even if you don't enjoy the format but love those old spaghetti westerns its worth adding to your collection. The end result is a fun film that can be enjoyed either way.

1056636,4,6305564345,"There has never been - and probably never will be - a more aptly titled movie than Comin' At Ya, the 1981 spaghetti western that kick started the short-lived second generation of 3D motion pictures.  Producer / star Tony Anthony had had some success with his Stranger films, a progressively wackier series of internationally-financed Clint Eastwood rip-offs that showcased his offbeat slacker appeal and comic touch.  Ironically, the plot of Comin' At Ya is as serious as spaghetti westerns get, but it's balanced with some of the most ludicrously entertaining ""in your face"" 3D effects ever attempted on screen.

After his wedding day is interrupted by two thugs who leave him for dead and abduct his beautiful bride (the legitimately beautiful Victoria Abril), bank robber H.H. Hart (Anthony) saddles up for revenge, tracking his quarry to a run-down border town where dozens of women are sold into the prostitution trade.  With the help of a drunken Irishman, Hart hatches a plan restore justice...and get some payback of his own.

Comin At Ya begins with one of the most ingenious opening credit sequences ever staged in 3D, each title revealing itself in eye-popping fashion, like the underside of a boot, a dangling bottle or tattered treasure map.  And it all sets the stage for the film's true agenda, which is providing the most unabashedly exploitative three-dimensional experience technology would allow at the time.  Everything from flaming arrows, flying bats and man-eating rats (not to mention a baby's butt!) are thrust into the screen with all the subtly of a monster truck commercial.  Story is really never a consideration when it comes to these show stopping moments.

But that doesn't mean there isn't one at all.  In fact, one of the more surprising things about revisiting Comin' At Ya is how dark the plot really is.  The opening wedding sequence was an obvious influence on Tarantino's Kill Bill, and while the rest of the film doesn't go to those sorts of extremes, a story revolving around rape, torture and forced prostitution isn't exactly typical escapist 3D fare.  Director Ferdinando Baldi (Texas, Adios) knows his way around the western genre and crafts some authentic cinematic moments when the opportunity allows.

But for most folks reading this, the real question will be:  how does all this look on a home 3D display?  The answer is:  that depends.  Just a quick search online will turn up a number of differing opinions.  But the truth is, Tony Anthony and company were going for an overtly headache-inducing experience from the get-go.  Where '80s 3D follow-ups like Jaws 3D and Friday the 13 Part III used the technology only sparingly, Comin' At Ya is a nearly non-stop demo reel.  Yet their inexperience shows in the sloppy photography, focus issues and dirty lenses.  The final verdict is the film didn't look that great to begin with (this reviewer caught it at its Fantastic Fest debut a few years back).  And the new Blu-ray presentation isn't much of a restoration, merely a ""re-imagining"" with some new color effects inserted by a company called Noir 3D.  While the additions had the approval of Anthony and only pop up now and then, it was still a misguided choice.

That said, even in the standard 2D version (which is presented on disc as well), Comin' At Ya is a giddy bit of nostalgia.  And it's great to have it on home video in any version; much less an authentic 3D experience that still has the power to make jaws drop.  That's good, because MVD's release is limited to the main feature and a pair of promotional trailers.",1454889600,,3580,4.885761589403973
1056637,1,6305564345,"I tried watching this film on my 3D DLP Viewsonic projector but the 3D as presented here is just too much of a good thing.

With its deep focus keeping both foreground and background in crisp detail and over the top 3D of assaulting the camera/viewer with extreme close objects the mind doesn't know what to look at.  One has to essentially pick what to look at - strain and practically cross one's eyes to see the object up close or relax and settle on the more comfortable stuff in the background.  The gimmick wears thin really fast.  I couldn't get through more than 20 minutes.

I saw Comin' At Ya back in the 80's when it was released theatrically.  My recollection is it was as painful to watch then as it is now.  This film makes me NOT lament the limited amount of in your face 3D effects in films today.  The 20 minutes I withstood watching Comin' At Ya have given me a new appreciation that the more natural presentation of 3D in today's films with the rare pop-out effect is better than this monstrosity.

On my projector there was no crosstalk or ghosting that I perceived.  Each eye had its own unique perspective.  On some shots you do notice the left and right lenses have different dirt smears present at the time of original cinematography.. this is not a fault of the transfer just shoddy work at the time of filming this low budget mess.  My Panasonic Plasma exhibited its usual minimal ghosting on light object against dark backgound (likely a fault of the active shutter glasses not the blu-ray or TV).",1454803200,,1524,4.501818181818182
1056697,4,6305564345,"-Comin At Ya I remember playing at the local movie house when I was 13 years old. 3D in my early childhood was a concept that wowed me. I remember my mom taking me and my brother to the 7-11 for the glasses for that television movie that was the Sunday Night Movie on our local ABC station. I want to say my first movie theater experience with 3-D had to be Cheech and Chong Up in Smoke which we snuck in and stole glasses from the counter when we ordered popcorn and drinks. (It would be fine, I would manage that theater a few years later) Comin At Ya, I will admit I always wanted to see but never did until now. I am not going to tell you this is a great classic gem, but it is a film that is so bad, it was actually really fun and has me excited to watch it again. The movie was directed by Ferdinando Baldi and starred Tony Anthony. This low budget spaghetti western begins with Tony playing H. H. Hart and he is about to get married. The ceremony is interrupted by two gun toting baddie brothers. They off the Priest, leave Hart to assume he is dead and steal the bride which later they sell her as a prostitute. Hart it seems is alive and he is out to get his bride back and get these two brothers.

This film as I was watching could tell that the 3-D effects were the plot that this film wanted. Where the story feels like any Clint Eastwood meets John Wayne western, the 3-D effects are what set this film apart. The landscapes in this film is another positive, as the beauty of the west was captured if it was filmed at Club Med or any summer resort. The film has moments that seem to drag, but the last half of this film is just pure fun and really made me happy that I stuck it out. The acting in this film is what you would expect, it is low budget and cheesy. Though if this film gave us any other kind of acting, it would have killed the feel and mood of this film. This film is not perfect as you read, but it was fun. At a time when the Western seems to be making a comeback of sorts, this film could be a good own and watch it as a double feature with Silverado. If you own a 3-D Television, this film is a blast.

Comin At Ya! is an interesting movie from a historical perspective. It was directed by Ferdinando Baldi, who directed spaghetti western classics like Django, Prepare A Coffin and Texas Adios. The strange part is that those two movies were both released in the 1960s, and Comin At Ya! was released in 1981. By this time, the spaghetti western craze had come to a cool, and so I am not surprised that the movie did not do so well at the box office.

It also just missed the golden era of cheesy 3D movies, which were more popular in the 50s and 60s. By the early 80s, 3D was out of vogue and would remain that way until Avatar brought it back to the forefront of the cinema and made it a mainstay.

The movie begins with one of the most entertaining opening credits I have ever seen. The 3D gimmicks are used to bring the actor and crew member names to the front of your screen, using the jump out of your screen 3D techniques that were very popular before the new digital 3D processes rendered a smoother image.  Screen Shot 2016-02-03 at 7.08.49 PM

The opening wedding sequence certainly feels like it was an inspiration for the same sequence in Quentin Tarnatinos Kill Bill: Vol. 2. However, unlike Tarantino, this is not a dialogue heavy movie. In fact, the first 13 minutes are completely free of any dialogue. It is a bit odd to have such a long first act without any dialogue, considering the film itself is under 90 minutes, but I think it works. This isn't a typical movie, so why have a typical introduction?

I do not want to give too much away, because this is a movie that truly deserves a blind first watch to enjoy. There is plenty of absurdity, plenty of laughs from the so bad its good moments, and it is a great movie to watch with friends. If you are a fan of Westerns, or a fan of cheesy cult movies, this is certainly worth picking up. Pop it in with a few like-minded friends, get the beers cold, the 3D glasses on, and I guarantee you will have a great time with Comin At Ya!",1454544000,,2266,4.295081967213115
1056699,4,6305564345,"The 1980's 3D resurgence should have taken place in 1969, after the release of The Stewardesses, a film which at the time of its release became the highest grossing 3D film ever made, up until the current 3D releases, that is. Hollywood should have taken notice because of its success, but with it being a soft core adult film with a self applied 'X' rating, Hollywood basicly said 'ehhh'.

 But in 1981, Comin' at Ya! was released, and even though it had an advertising campaign that didn't show a single clip from the movie at all, the film was a surprise hit. This time, however, Hollywood did take notice and started production on 3D films, due to the innovations in 3D filmmaking that took place since the 50's 3D boom, most notably Chris Condon's StereoVision process, first used on The Stewardesses.

 Comin' at Ya!, a spaghetti western released at a time when the genre had, for lack of a better term, gone the way of the old west, is a straight forward quest story. Our hero, H.H. Hart, played by Tony Anthony, is seeking revenge towards a pair of desperados who displayed the bad manners of attacking him during his wedding day, leaving him for dead and kidnapping his bride, who he must now save before she is sold into slavery.

 Comin' at Ya! is an very aptly named film, because the filmmakers do not shy away from using the 3D process, and shows you exactly, from the minute the film opens, what to expect: objects comin at ya from off the screen every chance they get, and I do mean every chance they get. But the more noticeable 3D moments, in my opinion, were the scenes that showed off depth perception, which were awesome and a nice break from the barrage of pop out effects this film is best known for.

 But let's get to a problem that may cause some to not get the Blu-ray: Noir 3D. I was afraid that this ""visual reimaging"" of the film would be majorly annoying, but after seeing the film, it's not as terrible as I had previously imagined. There's not that much of this in the Blu-ray release, only around three minutes or so (not counting the end credit sequence), which is a good thing. I can't tell you if the 2013 re-release of the film had more of this compared to the Blu-ray release because I wasn't lucky enough to live by a Alamo Drafthouse, where the re-release was shown and I was unable to see that version. If you want to see what the Blu-ray could have looked like with more of the Noir 3D, just watch the 3D ""sizzle reel"" that's shown during the end credits, which has been re-edited from the original release so that technical credits could be added for this new version. I'm still of the opinion that Noir 3D shouldn't have been added to the film at all, to give it a ""Sin City"" kind of feel, but with Sin City, that was the way that that film was from the beginning and is that film's director's stylish approach to the film, not an after thought like Noir 3D was in relation with Comin' at Ya!

 Video: Of course, there are some that are going to say ""Restored version? There are black spots on the screen during some of the scenes. It's not restored!"", but I take it as more of a conversion than anything else. Tony Anthony's main goal probably was just to get the film back out there in 3D, and nothing else. I contribute the black spots in the film to the movie's filming conditions, which weren't the best in the world, and some things couldn't be helped. At least the black spots wasn't as distracting as the Noir 3D scenes. In my opinion, this is the best this film is going to look, despite not having gone through an all out restoration.

 Audio: This is a new all 5.1 surround mix, apparently not based on the Dolby Stereo soundtrack of the original release, but it is a enjoyable sound mix, all the same. A 2 channel audio track is also on the disc.

 3D: Like reactions by other viewers, I had a slight problem with ghosting, but it wasn't that noticeable because the ghosting was very, very light. The pop out effects and depth perception of the film are top notch and I wouldn't be wrong in saying that people are probably going to get this, if not for any other reason, to use as a demo disc for their home 3D setup.

 Bonus Features: The extended Noir 3D trailer (6:00) from the 2013 re-release, titled 'Promo' on the disc, and a trailer (2:00) from the 2015 re-release are the only bonus materials on the disc. It would have been nice to see at least a retrospective interview with Tony Anthony or the original 1981 trailer and TV advertising spots for the film though.

 Overall opinion: I was satisfied to finally see Comin' at Ya! in real stereoscopic 3D, as it is one of the missed 3D movie going experiences of my youth. Despite the alterations to the film, which are slight compared to what could have been, this is a Blu-ray that deserves a place in everyone's Blu-ray 3D collection.",1454457600,6,4850,4.424242424242424
1056700,1,6305564345,"I once admitted that a bad movie could actually be saved by good 3D. Comin At Ya is an atrociously bad movie plagued with enormous crosstalk issues despite the claims of a frame by frame digital conversion.

Released theatrically in 1981, the makers of Comin At Ya had one sole purpose: to entertain its audience with every 3D trick they could invent. With a paper thin script, it was a film of style over substance, whereas its story took a backseat to the gimmickry. Perfect midnight fare, perhaps, where anyone could arrive at the theater after a night of partying, don some cardboard glasses, and enjoy some cheap onscreen effects.

The story is rather simple: two ruthless brothers kidnap a bride and sell her at auction to work in a cat house. Seeking his bride and taking vengeance upon the kidnappers, H.H. Hart (Tony Anthony) grabs his guns and goes blasting at anything that stands in his way. Of course, being the film that this is, every stationary and moving prop is used to hurl itself towards the audience. From pistols to pitchforks, from rats to bats, every opportunity is taken to dazzle the viewer with an outward effect.

I think the idea of using the spaghetti-western genre for its story was an ingenious, given the potential opportunities for using all sorts of weapons and critters to throw towards the viewer. The problem is, the characters are so underdeveloped and the story is completely weighed down with its manipulated visuals that don't exactly work, that the watch is completely lacking in entertainment value.

and this is coming from a guy who LOVES 3D gimmicky. The problem is, as I initially mentioned, there are crosstalk issues with this disc that it make it mostly unwatchable. How badly these issues show up on your screen will probably depend on the display you are using. On both my Sony front projector and Samsung plasma, I was getting quite a bit of ghosting throughout the film. In fact, the opening credits were so bad, that I initially thought there was something wrong with my glasses. One really needs to strain their eyes to watch this film, and for the first few minutes before my eyes adjusted somewhat to what I was viewing, I was getting a headache.

I own and have viewed nearly 200 3D titles and I have never seen anything this bad. That being said, some of our readers (mainly with DLP displays/projectors) are reporting they are having no issues whatsoever. That leads me to believe that the problem with this title rests in the manner in which it was originally lensed.

If you have equipment capable of displaying this release properly, you most likely find yourself pleased to own one of the best ""pop-out"" offerings available. All you need to do is remove your eyewear to observe the amount of ""blur"" to understand how intense the level of 3D is. The level of depth is quite impressive, at times. Every scene of the film is set up to deliver some sort of ""In Yo' Face"" pop-out. It will either be an amazing or disastrous viewing experience pending on whether you will see ghosting with every effect that comes inches before your eyes.

The overall image quality is fair. Obviously this was not intended to be a huge seller. As such, it doesnt look like much was put into cleaning up this film. There are dirt and debris speckles throughout, hair in the film gate, and even dirt seemingly on the lens itself that shows up for most of the feature run. There is very little detail brought out in this rather muddy looking presentation.

The 5.1 surround mix is adequate, as it highlights some of the 3D gimmickry including bats that fly and mice that scurry across the entire sound field. I'll give credit that it does enhance the immersive experience, with great clarity. Other than that, nothing memorable.

I am posting this review with a huge amount of regret. I realize the controversy that will be sparked by my opinion of this release. For some, Comin' At Ya! will be one of the most rewarding In' Yo' Face experiences. It's all a roll of the dice that weighs upon the type of equipment that you have. For the majority of viewers, I suspect the presentation will be hampered with non-stop ghosting problems and eye strain that will make for a difficult watch.

It would be very unfair of me to put the blame on the restoration team. I believe the problem with this disc resides in the way it was originally lensed at the time. To put a fault on one's display may seem unfair as well. As of posting this review, I have tested this disc on 4 displays (projector, plasma, LED) --- each considered near the top of the line -- and all have exhibited crosstalk issues, though at varying degrees. Meanwhile, many will respond to this review claiming they see no issues at all (mostly DLP projector/display owners). So, the best I can say at the moment is that your type of display will be the defining determination to the level of proper/improper presentation.

Based on what I have seen on my end, I cannot put this anywhere on my list of top 3D recommendations. However, certainly, this is an opinion that I completely understand will be either contested or defended for many years to come.

1056703,3,6305564345,"Lets start with the good:
The movie it's self is neat but for sure goes all in on the 3-D gimmick which I love about it. It is a fun movie with some great effects and a few ones that are you can tell are held by strings(probably due to the clarity of the print) The picture clarity for being a old film is great. You can really tell they took the time to make sure the color and clarity of the film looked top notch. The 3D Depth(to back of the screen) was clear and looked pretty good. The audio was nice, clear voices , booming explosions but overall not the best I have ever heard(but good for what they had to work with).

The major issues: Lets start the bad with my biggest gripe about the 3D presentation which is the ghosting. The effects that try to poke out only work well if the come out a inch or so, but the ones that try to go for deep pop out have serious doubling issues. To watch this movie I have to make many adjustments to my 3D projector and 3D BD player to lessen the 3D depth which is made to strong. I feel like that the theater rerelease of this movie probably did not have these issues but when the Blu-Ray was being made something got lost in translation. The company that did the releasing on this disc I have not seen before and its to bad they couldn't of had WB or another big brand to distribute the new version.

Small issues: No slip cover, no booklet for liner notes about the original release or what it took to get it to digital, and the lack of special features really is really sad for a movie I like so much. The Noir 3D that they used with this rerelease is neat but used more than needed.

Conclusion: Can't stress enough how much I enjoy the movie. Since I wasn't born till the 90s I didn't get to see this one in theaters. Even with all the video issues I am going to keep it since its the only blu-ray edition of it at the moment.

I'm happy with the Blu-ray 3D overall.  I would have preferred the international version released on 3D VHD videodisc decades ago which begins with a bank robbery prologue, which helped the film a great deal. Still, that scene was not in the U.S. theatrical version.

It's apparent some alignment and correction work was done, which helps to make the very wide parallax 3-D photography a bit easier on the eyes,  If you have trouble fusing some of the numerous gimmicks shots, don't worry, another one will be along in a few seconds! The dirt spots that some are complaining about were there from day one and are not a big deal.  I could have lived without the revisionist ""noir"" effects, but thankfully these are kept to a minimum and not applied to the entire feature as I had feared.

The amusing original theatrical trailer and TV spots should have been included as well, but if you like Spaghetti westerns and 3-D gimmicks shots, this is well worth checking out.  For the record, I had no ghosting or crosstalk when watching on a 4K passive TV.

Instead of objects ""comin' at ya"" clearly, as they break the 2D barrier they become blurry and lose the stereoscopic effect. There is also a noticeable amount of ""ghosting"". These two faults are more prevalent in darker interior scenes, of which there are several. The outdoor scenes are bright and clear, and the 3D depth is very good. There is also noticeable ""specks"" in some shots, which to me is unacceptable for a Blu-ray digital conversion. The movie itself is campy fun, although I cringed a bit at the misogynist brutality. I have a feeling Quentin Tarantino might have gotten some ideas for ""Django Unchained"" and ""The Hateful 8"" from this film. A few of the scenes in those films are similar to scenes in ""Comin' at Ya"". The disc can be played on a standard Blu-ray player and viewed on a standard HDTV to watch the film in 2D, although as a regular movie, it's pretty bad.",1453766400,2,1058,4.544502617801047
1056775,3,6305564345,"Background: Big fan of 3D and especially ""In your face"" 3D. 200+ Blu-Ray 3D discs, good Active-Shutter 3DTV.

Prior to this I've never seen ""Comin At Ya"" but I've always heard of it as a terrible movie but with great 3D.. and that's actually pretty accurate.
If you don't have 3D, I really can't recommend this one. Even if you do have 3D, it's a bit tough to sit through.

The Blu-Ray comes on 1-disc, no slipcover or digital copy.
The cover claims 3D and 2D versions, but there is no option to play the 2D version on a 3DTV.
Bonus feature are a Trailer and a Promo (which is basically.. another trailer)

Movie clocks in at 90 minutes and has it's moments (for 3D) but just not a good movie overall. I was glad they didn't try to make it a 2+ hour movie.

Right off the bat, this movie is marketed as fully remastered in 3D and 4K.. And while it does look Ok for an 80s movie, there's quite a bit of dust, grain and smudges on the print.. normally not a problem but these become very distracting in 3D (especially when its only over 1 eye)

But the 3D itself.. it's actually really good! In-your-face 3D popout throughout the whole movie, and for the most part it looks nice.
There are some issues with it being off at times (part of the frame might be Ok but the other part is just not aligned.. I believe this is because of the wide-angles and different tilts they used).
As other have mentioned, you'll probably get a headache watching this. I found this to be more due to the constant switching of angles and focal lengths, popout and depth. Cutting from an ultra-wide shot to an in-your face shot to zoomed in shot with depth.. trying to get your eyes to constantly adjust will definitely make you feel it.

My big gripe here is that this seemed more like an idea of 3D that they just worked a movie around, rather than making 3D work with the movie. So many slow-mo shots, holding a hand out in front of the camera for 10 seconds or dropping items onto it.. it just got old pretty quick (and I love 3D!). After seeing the same thing over and over for 90 minutes, it loses its fun.

The other big issue to some is with the re-editing. A few years ago they re-edited the movie to have some scenes in black and white with bits of color (think Sin City). It just doesn't have any purpose and looks out of place. It's also not consistent - the same scene can be in color, black and white and then black and white with splashes of color. To me, not a big deal as I never saw the movie before now.. but it does look weird.

Overall, I wanted to love this one. Big 3D fan but it was just the same thing over and over. The movie was bad, a 2D version would be pretty much not worth watching at all, and even in 3D it's hard to sit through. Good demo but that's about it. I don't see much replayability here.",1453766400,13,2806,4.183333333333334
1056776,3,6305564345,"Writing this from my smart phone while watching. This was the first movie I ever saw in 3D and I've owned this movie in every format available.

The good: The image is phenomenal. Take into consideration that the movie was shot with 2 images sharing the same film frame, so the picture is grainer than a full framed 35mm film would be (think 16mm quality) . It truly looks great. It seems there was a lot of parallax reframing, because the picture is a ton less eye straining than it was theatrically (or on the Japanese 3D VHD). The right eye seems to be darker than the left, but that's probably a result of the OPTIMAX III system. The 5.1 sound is lovely, too. I'm making the assumption that the stereo track is the same as the theatrical version (unlike the Rhino DVD, which erroneously switched the channels).

The bad: it's yet another version of the film. It's the US theatrical cut, so the extra footage of H. H. Hart and his love robbing a bank and being beaten up for it is missing. There is extra footage at the very beginning where the Filmways logo was of Hart riding on his horse and dismounting over a production credit.

There are next to no bonus features on this disc. Just 2 previews (one 3D, one 2D)
for the Noir 3D version. The wonderful 1983 Filmways trailer is missing, one reason to keep that Rhino DVD. Credits for the 3D restoration play over the effects recap (completely noir-ized), but there are no technical credits.

The ugly: This is the ""3D Noir"" version of the film that Tony Anthony prepared with Draft house films. This consists of certain scenes being in black and white with certain colors left in for artistic effect. It's pointless and distracting. The entire film looks like it's been recolored. It doesn't have the vibrancy the Japanese VHD did.",1453766400,7,1787,4.557632398753894
1056777,5,6305564345,Just received this today. If you want 3D pop outs this is the best movie. Most new movies only go for the depth of the picture. Story so so. Very campy but fun. 5 stars for the 3D,1453766400,3,179,3.736842105263158
1056778,3,6305564345,"So full disclosure, I had not seen the film prior to this new 3D Blu-ray. I do know that in promoting this new release, a modern trailer and promo reel were cut (both appear on this blu-ray in the bonus features) in which the color palette had been digitally manipulated to make some scenes black and white (or some elements within the original color footage black and white, or vise versa.) It's not entirely clear WHY this was done... perhaps they were going for a modern ""Sin City"" type look to make the film seem more contemporary (?) The promo reel in particular made it appear as though this gimmicky manipulation would appear throughout the film, turning it into a neon coloring book nightmare.

Well, take SOME comfort in knowing the effect is used sparingly and most of the recolored scenes from the promo reel appear intact in the actual film (with the exception of the end credits sequence... more on that in a second). That said, the effect is used in several scenes. It IS distracting and pulls you out of the movie, and there doesn't seem to be any logic or consistency in when it pops up. It's not JUST in flashback scenes, or in the kill shots, or in the slow-motion shots... all of which would at least make some kind of aesthetic sense if it was done consistently throughout.  Instead, it feels almost random. As if the guy turning the knobs was thinking ""Hey, I know we've already seen this location in several earlier scenes---wouldn't it be a kick to suddenly see it in black and white this time?"" or ""Let's turn this character black and white in this next scene, but only for about half the scene, then we'll restore him to color again even though nothing significant has happened to him."", etc.

I was almost tempted to just turn the saturation down on my TV so the entire film was black and white, to minimize the distraction of this gimmicky palette manipulation. But I stuck through it... the original color photography actually looks quite good, so its a shame they felt the need to monkey with it, even if in small doses.

One note--having not seen the film previously I can't speak to how the ending titles may have otherwise been modified, but the garish new promo reel (a clip show of in-your-face moments from the film, now color manipulated to look like that neon coloring book I mentioned earlier) plays under the end credits.

I'm reluctantly recommending the blu-ray for classic 3D fans and fans of the film because the image generally looks good (a few spotty shots here and there) and the 3D conversion to blu-ray is mostly well done (save a few headache-inducing scenes, symptomatic of poor left/right image registration... but there are only a few). If they had ditched the color magic (or just made it an alternate viewing option) I would up my rating to 4 stars.",1453766400,16,2804,4.622489959839357

1056858,4,6305564345,"In the early 1980s,producer,writer and actor Tony Anthony brought the lost art of 3D back to the forefront with the spaghetti western ""Comin At Ya!"" Trying to refine equipment from the 1950s for the 1980s and spending his own money,Anthony was on the verge of quitting the movie business after losing $300,000 to try and create a new system. Meeting former Xerox executives Marshall Lupo and Gene Quintano,the film was finally a go with a completely independently funded budget of close to $700,000 and filmed in Spain. The film was a surprise smash and in only 300 theaters drew over 5 million admissions. But the problem of cheap projection and bad lenses eventually lead to Anthony pulling the film off the market. And with the problem and expense of putting in ""silver screens"" in the theaters,Anthony started a company that created the first optical 3D projection lens that could adapt to any size theatre. The company sold a reported $1 million worth of lenses up until the time that Jaws 3D opened in 1983.

""Comin At Ya!"" plays very well in theaters with a newly restored digital transfer,and was re released two years ago in Texas. I had never seen the film before,and being a huge fan of Tony Anthony,I downloaded a torrent of the film last night,which is the same version as Rhino home video's dvd. Well,the film is a lot of fun,and very well made. One small problem,note to Rhino. The anaglyph 3D,which I'm a big fan of,and works best for tv and computer monitors..was done COMPLETELY wrong!!I listened to a podcast interview with Anthony a few months back,and he asked the interviewer,and I quote ""Do you have that bad Rhino copy?""

Now I know exactly what he was talking about! Rhino took the approach of an ""over and under"" anaglyph 3D version that does not work,and fades in and out from time to time. I finally decided to watch the film without 3D glasses,and got past the fact the 3D was totally screwed up. It would have been easier to see a flat version,but this film was made and shot specifically for 3D viewing.

Tony Anthony would act in one more film,1983s ""Treasure Of The Four Crowns"" which was also in 3D.After the fall of 3D in the 80s,Anthony quit acting and went on to concentrate on producing.

""Comin' At Ya!"" is a great film that deserves a better 3D transfer then what Rhino has botched up here. If you are a hardcore collector,then do spend the money for the dvd. It would be nice to see a Blu Ray version of the film,as well. I'm a big 3D and spaghetti western fan,and these go together well,but not for this dvd vesion. It's not the first time Rhino has messed up 3D films,by the way.

If it had not been for Anthony's re inventing 3D for the 80s,we most likely would not have the 3D films of the 21st century that James Cameron has brought us with Avatar and other films.

1056860,2,6305564345,"I saw ""Comin' At Ya!"" in the theater when it was released in 1981. Remembering that it was highly entertaining, if cheesy, I happily threw down my cash for the DVD release. If you're thinking about buying it, three words: Don't do it.

Rhino has converted the film to the red/blue 3D process (as opposed to the polarization process--if you've seen the 3D movies at Disneyland or Universal Studios, you know what I mean), and the results are horrible. Not only does the 3D not work, but the red and blue lenses ruin the color (red/blue 3D is better suited to black and white movies or monochromatic comic books). I gave up the glasses after ten minutes, muted the colors on my TV, and fast-forwarded to the fight scenes. (The two best actors in the movie are Tony Anthony and his shotgun.)

I'm very disappointed with Rhino for even releasing the DVD with the shoddy 3D. It's as if someone said, ""Yeah, the 3D doesn't work, but who cares? They'll buy it for the gimmick."" If you absolutely must see it again, rent it or con a friend into buying it. Because it is absolutely not worth the money.

As for the movie itself--c'mon, rubber bats on wires; flaming arrows; spears bouncing along on half-taut wires as they come ""right at you""? That's what 3D was made for. The director uses every excuse to throw things at the camera, and then some. Most of them defy logic. But it might make a good party game to predict what object on screen is going to come at you next.

""Comin' At Ya!"" is pure 3D cheese, and I loved it. Just don't expect good 3D.",1284681600,3,1543,4.422535211267606

This one didn't work well. The red/blue was way too far from the real image so it just looks like double/triple vision.

1056863,4,6305564345,"First off let me state that I am reviewing ""Comin' at Ya"" from the perspective of someone who has seen it in the theatre. With regard to the DVD, I do own a copy and can agree with many reviewers that color films do not give a good 3-D effect when viewed in an anaglyph presentation. The main problem of the presentation is the color. Since the objective of the 3-D presentation is to completely seperate the images that the left and right eyes view respectively, you can see that red/blue glasses (also red/cyan) cannot accomplish this. Since each eye is seeing parts of both images you end up with double images. This is simply because the red and blue block each other but cannot block out some of the colors in both images effectively giving each eye two images to view. Irregardless of this, those of us who are fans of 3-D and 3-D movies are just happy to have a copy of the movie and will muddle our way through a viewing for what effect we can get. The year was 1981 when ""Comin' at Ya"" was released to the theatre. I was in high school at the time and like others my age who saw the commercials for ""Comin' at Ya"" was wondering what this was. It was a Friday afternoon when I had finished work at the mall. I happened to check out the theatre and that movie ""Comin' at Ya' was playing. Since the commercials (a good ad campaign) had me curious, I decided to see it. That day I had one of the most fun experiences if not the most fun I had ever had in a theatre. The audience was filled with both types of 3-D viewers, the screamers and the cheerers. The guy behind me was shouting ""don't do it"", I on the other hand was shouting ""do it"" (this was in the opening scene when Tony Anthony was pointing a shotgun at the audience). ""Comin' at Ya"" made no pretense as to what it was; it was a 3-D movie that was simply going to throw everything at you and use a simple plot so you would not miss anything while you were busy ducking. This was an entertaining, interactive thrill ride that lasted 90 minutes and left you wanting more. Dan Symmes in Cinefantastique magazine referred to ""Comin' at Ya"" as bad 3-D (due to vertical and horizontal convergence) and since viewers like myself had not seen good 3-D we were apparently too ignorant to know the difference. Well smack me in the face with a brick, I along with the rest of the audience were too stupid to know that we really weren't enjoying ourselves. My thoughts toward his remarks involve the words egotistical and jealous. Tony Anthony wanted to make a 3-D movie. Not only in 3-D but entertaining as well. ""Comin' at Ya' was an experimental film that took a basic western plot of the bad guy steals good guys bride, so good guy tracks down bad guy and applies several forms of justice (western justice...he..he). They made a fun movie that was soley responsible for revamping the interest in 3-D movies only to have it put down by those who tried to copy what they did and most of them failed miserably and destroyed any interest in 3-D movies. ""Comin' at Ya' succeeded in the task of simply being a movie that was a lot of fun for an audience and did not pretend to be anything else-Bob",1100649600,23,3150,4.322635135135135

1056865,5,6305564345,"I'll start by saying that ""Comin' at Ya!"" is an excellent DVD package. It is a great film for anyone who enjoys either 3-D films or Spaghetti Westerns; it is also the home of some of the best 3-D effects ever seen on the screen. Originally, on the film's release in 1981, it was presented in the Polaroid Vectorgram 3-D process, which meant that the film could be shown from a single projector (other Polarised processes require two projectors fitted with Polarisers). The effect was excellent and provided realistic out of screen and depth effects. Unfortunately, the Polaroid process is impossible to achieve on television or home projection sets, simply because the process requires reflective screens. For the DVD release, Rhino opted for the cheaper, more user-friendly Anaglyphic 3-D system (using the Red and Blue lenses). The effect of this translation is excellent. Looking at other Amazon.com reviews, I can see that some reviewers have used the 3-D process incorrectly. If you intend to get a decent 3-D effect, please consider the following guidelines:
View the DVD on a 13/14-Inch television set
Adjust the color tint on your T.V screen to fit the 3-D lenses
View the DVD with the Red lens of the glasses on the right eye and the Blue lens on the right eye (as the glasses are enclosed)
Watch the DVD in a darkened room
Sit 6-8ft back from the T.V screen
If you have another pair of 3-D glasses, refold them so the Red lens covers the right eye. The glasses that come with the DVD are not very clear
Having looked at some of the Amazon.com reviews, many people claim that the two pairs of 3-D glasses enclosed with the DVD are folded the wrong way. This is not true. The DVD uses reversed Anaglyph 3-D which means that the Red lens MUST be placed over the right eye and the Blue lens over the left. If you wear the glasses with the Red lens over the left eye, you will not experience any off the screen effects.
And finally, we come to the film, is it any good? Well, it depends on what you like, but after you get immersed in the excellent 3-D effects, you won't care much about the movie itself. The film's story is simple, and is used as a vehicle for the 3-D effects (there are a lot of them!) Basically, H.H Hart (Anthony) is about to marry Abilene (Abril). But a few off the screen effects later, evil brothers Pike (Quintano) and Polk (Palacios) interrupt the ceremony and kidnap the bride. Understandably upset, Hart goes on a crusade to free Abilene and punish those responsible for her kidnap. But as the story unfolds, Hart (with the help of an Irish priest, whose presence seems quite pointless) discovers that Abilene's kidnap is only a small part of a bigger operation. Simple, but easy to follow.
All in all, this package is a steal; you get one of the best 3-D DVD transfers available and two pairs of 3-D glasses. This film beats any of the 3-D VHS tapes previously available, including Elvira's presentation of `The Mask'. I own both and prefer `Comin' at Ya!' Rhino DVD have done a great job with this one and it is a great buy for anyone who loves 3-D effects. The effects say more than story ever could.",1069804800,9,3137,4.553982300884956

If you, like me, still want to buy the DVD, be warned.

1056937,4,6305564345,"Most of the reviewers seem to say this movie is bad and the 3-D did not work for them.  I got a copy of this, and surprisingly the movie is not THAT bad and the 3-D works!  Comin At Ya was billed as ""The First 3-D Movie of the 80s!"".  It was actually made in Italy, and was put in 3-D just to give it an edge in theatres.  It's a spaghetti western!  The plot is about a gang of woman-stealing banditos that raid small border towns looking for girls to sell to Mexican whorehouses.  They pick the wrong man's wife to steal at a wedding, and he goes after them to save all the women!  It's a basic plot, and R-RATED.  Not for the kids, unless you let them watch this sort of thing.  I saw most all of these movies in the theatres - Comin at Ya, Metalstorm, JAWS 3-D, Amityville 3-D ... etc!  Back then they used the polarized lenses which were gray.  On DVD they have to use anaglyph 3-D which means you wear red-blue glasses.  Both in the theatres and on TV the worst part always comes when they stick something in your face.  It rarely works, and you see 3 or 4 images coming at ya! But the depth of the backgrounds work pretty darn well, and now and then the effect is pretty good!  The bat attack scene has some hay falling that looks good, any of the wide shots look pretty good, and they dump some beans on you that works too!  Here are the tricks: - make sure the red lense is over your right eye closest to your right hand- don't use other glasses than the ones that come with the set  different movies have different glasses and they rarely work interchangeably- sit back at least 2 yards from the television, and make sure you are center to it.  Sitting close or too far left or right kills it - adjust the colors to your liking.  You should see color almost normally, but it will always look funky!  - Do not view on an HDTV!  It won't work- If your eyes get tired either close your right eye and watch it through the blue lens for about 10 seconds.  Watch it in bursts if you get a headache.  - Watch this in the dark!  Daylight will not help at all.  Enjoy it for what it is!  The 3-D was almost as problematic in the theatre as it is here.  Few people have figured out how to do 3-D well especially with these movies that were never shot well in the first place...  This is a drive-in movie with a little more depth at times - think of it like that and you'll be fine!",1059696000,14,2380,4.073275862068965

1056939,3,6305564345,"Comin' At Ya! is a scream.  Not only is the 3-D nearly unwatchable, but the movie has a camp, over the top quality which is all the better because it seems unintentional.
When it was first released to theatres, ""Comin At Ya!"" made a big splash because 3-D hadn't been seen on theatre screens for several decades.  The novelty was enough to bring people in, but the poor quality of the film was enough to nearly squash the return of 3-D before it even got started.  That wouldn't have been a bad thing, necessarily, because it would have meant that Jaws 3-D, Parasite and The Man Who Wasn't There would never have been made.
3-D is a valid technical adjunct to filmmaking, but only when it is ""tamed"" and the filmmakers resist the temptation to throw things at the heads of the audience.  There ARE good movies in 3-D.  Excellent 3-D films include such classics as ""House of Wax"", ""Dial 'M' For Murder"", ""Creature From the Black Lagoon"" and ""Kiss Me Kate"", films which stand on their own merits, and which are actively enhanced by the addition of the third dimension.
Then there are the so-so 3-D films.  Films which are not particularly memorable, but which are workmanlike and entertaining.  Films in this catagory would include ""The Maze"", ""Fort Ti"", ""Revenge of the Creature"", and ""It Came from Outer Space"" (I know, I know.  ICFOS is your favorite film.  This is just a personal assessment.)
Then there are the 3-D IMAX films.  Most of these have excellent quality 3-D, but little cinematic value.  Such IMAX films as The Haunted Castle and Encounters in the Third Dimension are little more than 3-D roller coasters -- good at what they do, but not ""Citizen Kane"" by any stretch of the imagination, nor are they intended to be.
Finally, there are the totally junky low-budget films with no redeeming value whatever except for unintentional hilarity as in  ""Comin' At Ya!"" and ""Robot Monster""  Everything about these films is terrible -- the movies are awful, and the 3-D is unwatchable and headache inducing.  If the movie is funny or gosh-awful enough, it becomes a good party film.  That is the case with ""Comin' At Ya!""  It's so bad it's good.  My favorite scenes are the ""bat attack"" and the very long 3-D effects laden scene as the bad guys wait till ""high noon.""
Hint, though, don't watch it on a big-screen TV.  It will look better on a 13 inch TV set clear across the room as far away as you can get it.  Anaglyphic 3-D is a lot like life -- the farther you are from it, the better it looks.",1008547200,8,2503,4.546875

1056942,1,6305564345,"First of all, I had never seen this film in any version, until I bought the DVD release.  After sitting through the opening credits, it became clear to me, that since Rhino(again) has no idea whatsoever, about  releasing 3-D films on video(and now, DVD), that they shouldn't have  bothered in the first place.
Secondly, this edition is a complete insult  to the film in question, as NOTHING works about the 3-D process, despite  it's letterboxed presentation.  Sad, as I am a huge fan of 3-D films, not  the IMAX ones, but the real ones(""JAWS 3-D"", ""FRIDAY THE  13TH, PART III"", ""AMITYVILLE 3-D"", ""CREATURE FROM THE  BLACK LAGOON"", ""PARASITE"", ""HOUSE OF WAX"",  ""METALSTORM: THE DESTRUCTION OF JARED-SYN"", ""HONDO"", et  cetera).  I guess I will never get a chance to see this particular film in  it's proper acceptance.  Ho-hum.
For those of you, who are interested in  purchasing it, PLEASE, do not.  Unless, you enjoy a double-image  presentation, reminiscent of the reception to the local PBS channel, in my  home town.  There is no need to adjust anything on your television to view  this DVD/video, as you will only be wasting your time, after, of course,  your money.
I'd also like to take an opportunity to thank Rhino for  another wasted 3-D video release, ""ROBOT MONSTER"".  They've  managed to make a ""so bad, it's fun"" film, completely  incomprehensible.
I relish the olden days of Rhino Video, when the likes  of Johnny Legend ruled the show.",956966400,17,1451,4.868312757201646
1056943,2,6305564345,"Originally, this was released to theaters in color, but using Polarized glasses for the 3D effect.  The glasses looked gray, but allowed you to see two images (left and right) both projected on the screen at the same time  (with corresponding Polarized lenses on each projector).  This is how all  of the ""classic"" films are done in the theater.
This video  version uses what is now the only widely available means for producing 3D  on television:  red and blue glasses.  (Polarizing lenses are difficult, if  not impossible, with a TV screen.)  The result is about par for the course  with most color films in 3D I've seen on TV (such as the 3D showing of John  Wayne's ""Hondo"" a few years back.)  Black and white films (such  as ""The Mask"") fare better with red/blue glasses, since there's  no color in the actual film to throw off your eyes.
""Comin' At  Ya"" wasn't shot well in the first place -- the plane of focus changes  to fast and too often and most of the film is spent sticking things into  the lenses of the camera.  But, it's still fun nonetheless.
Two points  about the DVD release:
In my copy, the lenses in the glasses were  reversed; it took awhile for me to figure out that *duh* the red lens goes  over the right eye.
Secondly, adjustment of your TV set is critical to  get any effect at all.  The tone of the reds and blues must match the  glasses fairly closely and the color intensity on your set probably needs  to be turned town slightly.  On practically all TV presenations I've seen  of 3D films, a segment is shown with a test pattern to allow you to adjust  the color on your TV for the movie.  (Even if your set is calibrated, it  probably still needs tweaking to match the glasses you have, since there  are variations in these things.)
Rhino should include such a test segment  on future releases.
If you're a fan of Spaghetti westerns, it's well  worth a look and is considered by afficionadoes as a ""late entry""  in the Spaghetti western cycle.
All in all, it's a pretty good  presentation of the film, and the film itself has limitations in its 3D  format.",940204800,14,2090,4.462765957446808

This is obvious during the opening credits and the opening credits are the best part of the movie. My former worst 3D movie of all time was The Mask. Comin' At Ya makes The Mask look like Citizen Kane. How bad is it? Let me start by saying the worst all time 3D effect is in this movie. I won't spoil it for you. The cameras have lenses that cannot focus closer that about 18 inches and every 3D effect is massively out of focus. There is a scene where there is a bat flying around scaring all the whores and a kindergarten class could have produced more realistic fake bats. They try way to hard to jam every thing in the world into the lens. This movie tries way too hard to be a 3D movie. This is not a question of it being so bad it is good, it is a question of it being so bad it is really bad. Everything. The acting, the story, the production, the whole nine yards.
