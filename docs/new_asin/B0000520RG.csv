1388075,5,B0000520RG,"Invasion USA is essentially the grand-daddy of all nuclear war movies, a remarkable film released in 1953 that almost certainly proved frightening to movie audiences of that era.  Nowadays, the film exudes an aura of campiness and, depending on one's political viewpoint, draws either laughs or respect (and sometimes both).  Invasion USA is definitely a Cold Warriors movie, an unforgettable piece of cinematic propaganda that turned its spotlights clearly on the threat of the Red menace.  Making liberal use of stock footage from World War II, this movie not only offers a vision of Communist invasion but explains why such an invasion might succeed, thus rallying the American people not to retreat into post-war isolationism and materialism.  The price of freedom is eternal vigilance, and this is the message Invasion USA conveyed rather impressively.
I happen to think this movie is brilliant.  I was born in 1970, and I knew the fear of nuclear war as a child.  For those living in the 1950s, the fear of nuclear was an even more pervasive threat - as was Communism.  I still hate Communism with every fiber of my being, and for me personally the Cold War will not end until the number of Communists in the world falls all the way to zero.  The generation coming of age today does not truly know the gnawingly pervasive threat of intercontinental nuclear war nor do today's youth remember a world in which the USSR not only existed but cast dark shadows across many parts of the world.  To many today, the Red Scare conjures up comical images of a fanatical Joseph McCarthy and the John Birch Society looking for Communists under rocks and park benches.  Invasion USA will thus strike many viewers today as rather silly, but I regard this as, to some degree, an educational film that offers an insightful look into the American mind of the 1950s.  Certainly, the characters are rather two-dimensional, the dialogue is unintentionally funny on several occasions, and the ending is likely to produce a few groans among modern audiences, but the film's theme and message is not only historically informative but still, in the broadest sense, relevant and instructive.
The setup and ""kicker"" plot twist at the end may well leave one with a bad taste in his/her mouth initially, but Invasion USA is still capable of resonating over time in the minds of those who see it.  It is really an unusual film in more ways than one.  Not only does it offer a frightening vision of America subjugated by an unnamed yet ruthless and easily identifiable enemy, it assigns the blame for this possible future defeat on a populace of men and women too concerned with their own lives and desires to look out for the interests of the nation.  One of the characters in the film, for example, is a wealthy tractor manufacturer who just turned down a government request to produce needed military tanks, putting profit above patriotism.  Complacency and the voluntary wearing of blinders among a population sick of world wars is shown to be the weakest link in America's contemporary defense.  Everybody complains about taxes, concentrates solely on their own needs, and goes about his/her life pretending that America could never possibly be attacked - script writer Robert Smith clearly communicated the dangerous vulnerability implicit in such a worldview.  Invasion USA is a clarion call to a prosperous people courting danger by avoiding a frightening truth.  The film was amazingly effective in delivering this crucial and timely warning to its audience.  The same message applies in our own world; while the threat comes from a different source, only a vigilant and cooperative attitude among the American people can safeguard our freedoms from those who wish to destroy us.
Clearly, Invasion USA was a success, one which soon led to similar films built around the horrifying threat of nuclear war.  The movie earned more than one million dollars - not too shabby for a film shot in the course of only seven days on a budget of one hundred twenty seven thousand dollars.  Stock footage from World War II makes up some 30% of the film.  Fictional news broadcasts explaining the progress (or, more correctly, lack of progress) in the war leave room for only so much actual human interaction and dialogue - this is perhaps fortunate, as the characters are less than captivating in and of themselves.  Still, there is enough of a personal dimension to the tragedy unleashed on film to really bring Invasion USA's message across to the sympathetic viewer.  It's impossible not to laugh at parts of this movie all these decades later, but there is an eternally valuable message - exaggerated as it may be - here that all freedom-loving men and women would do well to ponder over.",1076112000,48,4763,4.902864259028642
1388076,2,B0000520RG,"INVASION USA (1952) is not to be confused with the film of the same name starring Chuck Norris in 1985, although the plots are similar.  In the 1952 version, director Alfred Green takes advantage of the anti-Red movement that was then sweeping the country.  Many Americans were sure that a Russian attack was imminent, and Green chose to portray a dream sequence that allows the Russians to attack the United States in much the same way that John Milius would later accomplish in RED DAWN.  Dan O'Herlihy enters a 'typical' bar in Anytown USA that is filled with blue collar types wondering about the latest threats from the Russians that are being announced on television.  Soon the tv reporter has a special announcement.  The Russians have just launched a full scale assault on America.  Most of the scenes that follow are stock footage shots from the Second World War.  As the television announcer intones the coming destruction of the American Way of Life, it becomes clear that this film is less entertainment than it is polemic.  The message is clear: watch the skies for THEY are coming.  O'Herlihy at the end pulls a surprise that jolts the bar customers back to reality.  The pacing, acting, dialogue, and camera work are strictly second rate, yet INVASION USA has a peculiar ability to reflect the moodiness of an age that felt that destruction was just around the corner.  If you can catch this mood, then you can overlook the obvious shortcomings and focus on its equally obvious intent.",1054425600,3,1500,4.8203125
1388077,5,B0000520RG,"Invasion USA is a delightfully wacked atomic war/red scare quickie, a relatively tame early effort of sleazy exploitation producer Albert Zugsmith (Touch of Evil, High School Confidential, Confessions of an Opium Eater, Incredible Sex Revolution), featuring cinematography by John L. Russell (TV's Thriller, Hitchcock's Psycho); a score by Albert Glasser, Bert I. Gordon's house composer; and LOTS of stock footage. TV reporter Gerald Mohr is getting generally cautious responses to his question about a ""universal draft"" from a small group of Manhattan bar patrons when a news bulletin reports unidentified aircraft spotted over Alaska. Within minutes, several airfields are nuked, and enemy paratroopers are on American soil; Mohr makes goo-goo eyes with Peggie Castle. Generic Eastern European-accented generals plot strategy on a wall-sized map of the U.S., and the president's back appears on TV to announce that the ""enemy"" will not win because we're nuking them ""three to one""; Mohr and Castle have dinner and coffee and smooch. San Francisco is bombed and invaded, and a Texas cattleman's family drowns in a taxicab when the still-unidentified enemy A-bombs Boulder Dam; the bar patrons discuss possible defensive strategies and order another round. Apparent atomic-movie king William Schallert (best known for playing Patty Duke's father and voice of a thousand TV commercials) shows up as another newscaster, and both Lois Lanes (Noel Neill and Phyllis Coates) have bits. Finally, Manhattan is bombed; taxi drivers and newsboys become guerilla fighters (offscreen); English-speaking commie paratroopers in U.S. uniforms advance on Washington D.C. (some of the phony troops are exposed when the commander of a supposed Chicago-area division unwittingly states that ""the Cubs"" are ""small bears""); Mohr is machine-gunned; and Castle leaps to her death rather than be raped by an enemy soldier! All is ultimately revealed to be some sort of mass hypnosis/hallucination, created by mysterious ""fortune-telling"" barfly Mr. Ohman (Dan O'Herlihy), that leaves everyone with renewed patriotic fervor (e.g., the selfish auto parts manufacturer decides to make tank parts for the government). While there is much ludicrous plotting, loopy dialogue, and bad acting for schlock-movie fans to relish (Mohr's leering manner is as creepy here as in Angry Red Planet), be aware that perhaps 50% of Invasion USA consists of WWII stock footage and a few superimposed nuclear blasts.
Amazingly, the source print used for Synapse's full-frame transfer looks nearly pristine (except of course for much of the stock footage). The studio-shot scenes exhibit overall excellent black level, contrast, brightness, sharpness, grayscale, and shadow/highlight detail, and there is only some sporadic light speckling evident. The disc includes some very cool extras, my favorite being the 20-minute 1962 Department of Defense informational/scare film Red Nightmare, directed by George Waggner (The Wolf Man, Man Made Monster), written by Vincent Fotre (whose four screenplay credits also include Missile to the Moon and Bava's Baron Blood!!), and narrated on camera by Jack (Joe Friday) Webb. It's easily as entertaining as the feature, opening at a clandestine school in the USSR where communist teens learn how to eradicate bourgeois American values, then moving into a wild Soviet-takeover nightmare scenario wherein typical American dad Jack Kelly (Forbidden Planet, She Devil) is imprisoned and ultimately executed by the communist authorities after his wife and kids turn him in for ""deviationism."" (Look fast for bits by Robert Conrad and Andrew Duggan.) The print is razor sharp, with excellent tonal values, but marred somewhat in places by light to moderate speckling. Also of interest are interviews with O'Herlihy , Schallert (surprisingly, one of Zugsmith's favorite actors), and Neill (who says Invasion USA looks better than ""that Pearl Harbor thing""!) Another fun extra, courtesy of atomic-age Web site conelrad.com, is the Conelrad100 greatest ""atomic"" movies. Clicking through the list is amusing enough, though each film gets only a shred of info, and it basically serves more as a checklist than an in-depth reference. A rerelease trailer for Invasion USA is also included, looking very nice, with excellent tonal values, sharpness, and detail, and little or no speckling or blemishing. Hardcores even have the option of listening to Civil Defense LPs as an alternate soundtrack to the feature. In total, hours of cheesy fun for atom-age vampires. Recommended.",1034121600,14,4559,5.5706051873198845
1388078,5,B0000520RG,After over more than 30 years I finally get to see the movie. Acting is pretty good and the dialogue is ok. The best part of the movie is seeing the flight scenes of some of the finest aircraft that ever flew for the US Air Force and US Navy. There is also a beautiful shot of a Lockheed Constellation in flight. You even see a genuine MiG 15 in some Korean War footage. But don't expect to see amazing special effects. This movie was filmed on a budget that would not even get you into the studio parking lot today. The nuclear explosions are campy along with the imitation Russian dialogue. One interesting fact is that the movie came out one year before the invention of the H-Bomb. All in all a good movie that shows the paranoia of the Red Scare of the late 1940s through the 1950s.,1028764800,5,787,4.253333333333333
1388079,5,B0000520RG,"After years of crummy re-issues from video companies, Invasion USA finally receives the respect it deserves with a stunning new DVD ""Atomic"" edition from Synapse Films and Conelrad (a website devoted to Atomic Culture that, apparently, helped with the special features).
The movie itself is a laugh riot and the print is amazing (finally I can freezeframe the great Gerald Mohr with crystal clarity), but it is the special features that make this disc a must buy.
Where else is one going to find the following on just one DVD: Civil Defense (Scare) Record albums playing as an alternate audio track. This is a nice alternative to self-absorbed actors and directors talking about their favorite shots in a film or what lunch they had on any given day of shooting. The classic 1962 Jack Webb short ""Red Nightmare"" (in a great new print). The Conelrad 100 (a play on the AFI 100?), an ""encyclopedia"" of the best ""Atomic"" Films ever made. This is a great feature and humorously written. If you're like me, you'll find yourself reading all 100! Cast interviews with the surviving stars of the film: While this section is a little rough around the edges, you have to admire the dedication of the producers to round of these aging actors tfor one last comment on Invasion USA. Noel Neill is hilarious (she snipes at the other Lois Lane and compares Invasion USA to Pearl Harbor--the movie!). Dan O'Herlihy is also a riot reading a New York Times pan of Invasion USA that gets his name misspelled!).
All in all a great package. If you are the least bit iterested in campy films or the Cold War, you MUST own this DVD!",1021334400,35,1609,4.669014084507042
1388080,3,B0000520RG,"INVASION USA (1952) does not feature Chuck Norris.  His INVASION USA is another kettle of fish, on another page.

This film features Peggie Castle (BEGINNING OF THE END) and Gerald Mohr (ANGRY RED PLANET), and it's a cautionary fantasy tale about the need for America to ""be prepared"" militarily.  The premise is that assorted ""average people"" in a bar are hypnotized and made to imagine that World War III has begun, with Russians dropping A-bombs on San Francisco, Hoover Dam, NYC, and so on, airlifting troops into Washington D.C. and storming the halls of Congress... The Russian invaders are most unscrupulous and, to make matters worse, ill-mannered; the Americans are innocent, peace-loving and hopelessly naive.  At least half of the completed film is military stock footage, utilized rather effectively.  The thin plot, involving the actors in one crisis/disaster after another, is melodramatic, banal and very funny.

I wouldn't call INVASION USA (1952) a ""good"" film, but I can recommend it to people with a high tolerance for other people's hysteria.  It's an historic artifact, a cultural signpost, and a really bad movie all rolled into one videocassette.",1020902400,13,1169,5.219251336898396
1388081,1,B0000520RG,"This movie was, in a word-""goofball."" However I do own it and my friends and I get a kick out of watching it now and then. This one, like Lone Wolf Mcquade stretches your believability meter to the limit, but this one will surely break it-gauranteed. Chuck is always in the right place at the right time when the perps are doing a number and pulls off one unbelievable stunt after another. The only difference between this and the other Chuck classics is that the bad guys acting is as wooden as his. Rent it first.",996019200,,515,4.375

1388084,4,B0000520RG,"It may depend on your politics. But this movie (SPOILER) is a hypnotic vision of a USA that as it falls to the Commies. Not enough action to make the viewer want to cry ""Wolverines!"" It was made in the 1950s, early 1960s, at the limit. But it is watchable and you might want to look up the MST3K commentary as it is that kind of movie.",1360972800,,335,4.014925373134329
1388085,3,B0000520RG,"The Comical Commies are Coming!...or what will happen if Americans don't allow the government to seize tractor factories to make tanks, draft males into the military, and force females into munitions plants!
If this sounds like the Red Menace itself, well, think again, mister!  This is the Red, White, and Blue we're talking about!  And, if we don't heed the message, the next thing you know The Enemy (Slavic types with Russian accents) will be dumping a willy-nilly deluge of nukes, blitz bombs, and unpleasantly peasant paratroopers on selected American cities!
The storyline is stupid, the dialogue wincingly dopey, and the direction the ditziest imaginable.  Gerald Mohr, at his suavely smarmy best, is a TV talking head who patriotically strives to enlist--but no service branch will take him because there's not enough guns to go around.  At least that's what he keeps telling rich-girl Peggie Castle, whom he regularly romances at a NYC lounge--which is really a neat place to be given that the barkeep calmly serves cocktails, towels glasses, and turns off the TV if the news of the latest A-bomb gets too distressing.
At least a third of the film's 73 minutes consists of stock footage of flying planes interspersed with a few WWII battle frames and what appears to be filler from other war flicks.  The remainder of the movie is delightfully loony melodrama in which the country is methodically falling to the Commies, but no one in Gotham seems to be worried about ranging radiation, the Capitol Hill massacre, or the possibility that a municipality of eight million makes a tempting target.
One thing is dead certain:  this film is a nuclear bomb of a so-bad-it's-good blowout.  Even the droning dullness of endless aircraft doesn't cramp the hilarious, incredible corniness of it.",1304640000,,1795,5.043918918918919
1388086,1,B0000520RG,"Typical ""Red Scare"" movie. Not the best example of the genre [Invasion of the Body Snatchers wins by a landslide], but not the worst either. Worth the price if you're in need of a good laugh :)",1289174400,,193,4.243243243243243
1388087,4,B0000520RG,"Here we have a perfect example of 50's paranoia in film form. A bunch of people from different walks of life (a Senator, a rancher, a newscaster, a tractor manufacturer and a B-girl) are gathered together in a New York City bar drinking and complaining about the current political climate - how the government is interfering with business and hiking taxes, etc. A hypnotist named Mr. Oman (omen) uses his snifter of brandy to hypnotize all of them into thinking the U.S. has been invaded by THEM (Russians, obviously, although they never come right out and say it) and they kick our butts. By the looks of it, THEY drop a few hundred atom bombs all over the U.S. (represented by stock footage of the same explosion over and over again superimposed over even MORE stock footage. The fact that the stock footage is all of American troops and equipment is explained away by saying the invading hordes are disguised as American troops and using American equipment, although all of them speak with heavy Russian accents and are tripped up by questions about baseball and stuff like that). Since the main characters refused to help the military-industrial complex until it was too late, the worst happens and the B-girl, obviously a shining example of American womanhood, pays the ultimate price when oafish Russian soldiers capture her (""You MY woman now!"").

This is an awful movie but is, as I stated before, a shining example of 50's paranoia and it made a TON of money on its release.",1286150400,,1483,4.770428015564202
1388088,4,B0000520RG,"This movie is so outrageously campy and shoddy that its actually very funny.  Much of the dialog takes place in a bar of all places.  And I get the feeling its the same bar in which the script was written (in maybe an hour or so).  To buy the ease with which the Russians take over the USA, one has to totally suspend disbelief & common sense.  The writers apparently had no knowledge of military strategy or logistics--and they probably assumed the viewers didn't either.  For example, the Russians send a fleet of bombers from the West Coast filled with 10,000 paratroopers to capture Washington DC.  They are able to do this without being detected on radar and seemingly without any resistance to this rather light force.  Much of the movie is canned military battle footage that is clumsily strung together to support the script.  My favorite scene is at the end where the protagonist leads some Commie soldiers to his girlfriends apartment.  They promptly get drunk (at his suggestion), then try to make his girl.  He is killed while resisting and his girlfriend jumps out the window to escape.  I won't spoil the ending, but that was the only part that really made sense.  I can't WAIT for the remake.",1276905600,,1207,4.668246445497631
1388089,4,B0000520RG,"This cold War film really wasn't all that unbelievable for the time it was produced and distributed, when one takes into consideration the abysmal behavior of Soviet troops in eastern Europe under Stalins' arrogantly paranoid leadership from the mid-1940's until his demise in 1953.
The tragic historical record of the liberating/conquering Red Army speaks for itself, and this film accuratly portrayed how they would've behaved had they actually invaded the United States in 1952.",1269820800,3,481,5.513513513513513

7929629,3,B0000520RG,"I first saw this stew of corny acting, clumsily simulated atomic explosions, burning toy skyscrapers, and about 45 minutes of WW2 stock footage, when I was 13 years old, on WGN-TV Chicago.  It was a laugh riot then, and remains one today.  The notion of a full-scale invasion of the United States by Russia is a potent concept for a movie, but this piece of exploitation is ridiculous from start to finish.  A radio reporter, a Manhattan call girl, a windy U.S. Congressman, an Arizona cattle baron, and a tractor magnate all pay attention to a forecaster, odd Mr. Ohman, who wears a gypsy sash under his suitcoat, as he muses about the future over his swirling brandy snifter in a Manhattan bar. This bar boasts a 60"" wall TV about fifty years before they were available to the public.  All of a sudden, we get TV reports of a Commie invasion of Alaska using paratroops dressed as U.S. soldiers.  Before long, the Reds are dropping atomic bombs and troops in California.  The Congressman goes back to Washington D.C., while the cattle baron and tractor magnate catch a flight to San Francisco just as the Commies take over, aided by an infiltrator creep who washes windows. The call girl and radio reporter remain at home in N.Y.C.  The cattle baron hires a cab to drive him from Frisco to Arizona (what a fare that would be) and collects his wife and kids just as Boulder Dam is hit by an A-bomb.  The resulting flood looks like footage of rainwater headed for a sewer grate. The other characters come into close contact with the loathsome invaders, and all are wishing that they had not had a ""let George do it"" attitude towards a ""universal draft"" and defense of their nation.  Now it's too late-- or is it?

Some of the problems with ""Invasion U.S.A."" are:  the low budget, which necessitates using tons of stock footage of air, sea, and land battles; having actors running in single file in front of ""green screens"" depicting Washington D.C. and the halls of Congress; lethargic acting by the American generals in cutaways to the Pentagon (come on, this is World War Three!); and the overly-calm attitude of the people who continue to laze around the Manhattan bar as America is falling.  Overall, this adds to the outright hilarity of such scenes as a clueless Red posing as U.S. Army officer who is flummoxed by a question about the Chicago Cubs (""A cub-- is a young animal-- a bear--?"")  But my favorite scene comes near the end, when reporter Gerald Mohr comes to the aid of call girl Peggy Castle, in her high rise Manhattan apartment, where an A-bomb blast didn't even blow out the windows.  Mohr sends his two Russian captors, a little rat and a fat pig, over to her bar (""Whisky--good! Da!"")  as he tries to sooth Peggy. Then the fat pig tries to force whisky onto Peggy (""Now you MY woman!"")  How could Mohr take any more of this swinish behavior?

 The campy movie from Synapse features a trailer, extensive interviews with three of the cast members, a Jack Webb directed anti-Communist short movie, made at the Warners' back lot with Jack Kelly, called ""Red Nightmare"" (1962), a listing of atomic-war themed films, and more.  ""Mr. Ohman"" actor Dan O'Herlihy, who had spent time making a film in the U.S.S.R, said that from his personal observation, the Soviets were completely unable to make their own country work efficiently, and in the unlikely event they could have conquered us, they would have utterly flopped trying to run our country also.",1492819200,,3464,4.677100494233938

The big differences one can expect from most such films in the last 40 years or so is a decided lack of endorsed cynicism, and a demonstration in the move of political ideologies.
