The information is superficial and very repetitive from disc to disk (it looks like the same material was just cut and pasted to each disk and the commentators would simply highlight a different or the same actor for each category).

The DVD is not presented in a fluid manner that gives the viewer a clear beginning middle and end.  For example, it is not clear from the onset of the video that they are only covering the period of silent film to 1949.

It is amateurish production.  An actor's picture will appear on the screen with no identifying subtitle.  The documentary will then move to commentary without identifying the person who is speaking or their credentials.  I assume the lady who was commenting on the importance of different films was some sort of film historian but she was not identified during the documentary.

Most of disk one and three are devoted to one actor, Spencer Williams.  Although much was said of Stepin Fetchit-having never seen his work-the few clips shown did not illustrate what all of the fuss was about.  He could have easily been Eddie Murphy doing a Saturday night live skit.  More historical perspective was warranted.

The narration by Mario Van Peebles is weak-it seemed that by disk three he was ready to go home.

The presentation of movie clips jumps from brief excerpts/clips to whole sections of a movie with commentary.  It seems that the producers could not decide on the format of how and when to present comments and movie exerpts.

If you are expecting a slick and tight presentation like the A&E biography channel, you will be disappointed.

It was not comprehensive.  So much more could have been said about the significant actors. Only one actress was featured and it was not Lena Horne-who also starred in ""race"" films of this period.

All in all it is not a good production, not well written, not well thought out and not enjoyable to watch.

There were two redeeming features:
*commentaries by actors featured in the movie clips who were alive at the time the documentary was produced.
*Seeing exerpts of these older movies (although better editing would have made the whole thing more watchable).

Ironically the commentators kept stating how productions by black producers were of a poorer quality in the 1920's to 1940's than Hollywood because the budgets were low or non existent for Black productions. Based on these disks nothing has changed.",1278201600,6,2610,4.857466063348416
8099220,5,B000CMNJL8,"For the aspiring African American/Black filmaker, this three DVD set will hopefully give them the incentive to continue with that passion to make movies.  This is a great place to start to learn of our story in cinema.  We should never forget the many, many actors, writers, directors, and various productions which was made during these times of between the 20's through the 50's.",1216339200,4,381,4.9375
8099221,5,B000CMNJL8,"If you're really interested in Black Entertainment in hollywood, this is a good place to start. One disc is comedy. One disc is dramas. One disc is westerns. We covered the whole spectrum. Yet, today many of our children don't realize the rich heritage and the quality entertainment we produced. This is a good place to start.",1211328000,2,326,4.7368421052631575
8099222,1,B000CMNJL8,This had all the potential in the world...but sloppy editing......DULL narration (Mario Van Peebles - why not someone with some weight in Black Entertainment?).....sad sad sad all the way around........perhaps someday we will get a truly great documentary about this unreported facet of theatre and film.,1176681600,7,304,5.630434782608695
