2213246,5,B0007IO7BS,"This was a superb novela that I watched on TV without missing a minute.  Unfortunately, this DVD is only about 320 minutes long.  It contains the most important scenes so you can get a feel for the whole story.  It does not contain all 95 episodes.

The story is passionate, the actors incredible, and no cost was spared on costumes and sets.  I highly recommend it.",1111708800,4,366,4.484848484848484

2213248,5,B0007IO7BS,"I saw the complete novela on Univision and I have to say that I have never seen a better soap opera in my life. The producter/writer did a marvelous job. The scenery, props, clothing, everything was well thought out and beautiful. The acting was exquisite. The actors were perfectly selected for their roles. It was captivating and emotional. It won more than 25 awards. Words won't do justice to how amazingly great this novela was. I would say this would be the best investment you could make.",1111449600,2,495,4.7011494252873565
2213249,5,B0007IO7BS,"I don't understand how people are leaving reviews on a DVD that has not come out on release....AMAZON show:  Availability: This title will be released on April 26, 2005. You may order it now and we will ship it to you when it arrives from Amazon.com

I did watch the entire Novela on Univision...It was the most beautiful/passionate love story that I have ever seen....and, the first Spanish soap opera that caught my interest...and, made me watch my clock M-F.

Can someone please let me know if the AMAZON DVD version will be the entire Novela?  I would hate to buy it knowing that parts are cut off....I loved every minute of the show and can't wait to own a copy or 2.  My email address is:  iemontoya@aol.com",1111449600,,713,4.53125

It was the best novela I've seen since Corazon Salvaje. The actors were superb!  The scenery, stage props and clothing of that era were magnificent.  I really didn't want the story of Matilde and Manuel to end. Excellent Love story!!!",1111449600,2,368,4.6

2213252,5,B0007IO7BS,"Unlike American soup operas, Mexican soup operas are like reading a book: They only last an average of four months. ""Amor Real"" is definitely one of the best novelas of all times. Its story, its dialogues, its acting, its photography, its settings, its attire... will astound and amaze you. Also, the writer has done an excellent job mixing modern Spanish with the Spanish spoken in Mexico in the 19th century. Thumbs Up!!!",1110412800,,423,4.888888888888889

There were some things I wish they would have put in that they didn't but over all this is a great buy. I would recommend this one to anybody who loved ""Amor Real"" on TV and wants to remember and have it at home to watch it over and over again. I hope you buy it and enjoy it because I know I did.",1109203200,9,454,4.055555555555555

Every single role is cast to perfection, so believable, and the hacienda where it was filmed provides such authenticity to the story.

2213416,3,B0007IO7BS,"El Dvd esta Muy Bueno en cuanto a lo que contiene como Extras, solo me parece que podria haber sido muchisimo mejor en cuanto a la Edicion de los Capitulos.
La Telenovela en si, esta muy resumida, demasiado diria yo para lo que la Historia tiene y se transmitio en Television.
El Dvd Extra contiene, un Especial, Bloopers, Detras de Camaras y la Presentacion de la Novela, sin embargo (el que yo recibi no tiene el Videoclip de Sin Bandera, de la Cancion Amor Real ni el Trailer de la Novela), en la Contratapa Original del Dvd que esta a la venta, para todo el mundo, dice que contiene: La Presentacion de Carla Estrada, Especial: Un Amor Real para La Historia, el Video de Sin Bandera, Bloopers, Entrega de Reconocimientos y Trailers, en cambio el que yo tengo dice todo eso menos que trae los Bloopers, la Entrega de Reconocimientos y los Trailers.
En sintesis, Mi Dvd, no tiene el Videoclip de Sin Bandera ni el Trailer Oficial de Amor Real y para variar en la Contratapa solo menciona la Presentacion, el Especial y el Videoclip que no esta, falta el texto de los Bloopers y los Reconocimientos, que si los tiene.
Yo esperaba que el Dvd tubiera el Final Extendido que se transmitio en Television, las Escenas de Manuel y Matilde, a&ntilde;os despues, en el Dvd el Final es cuando ellos se reencuentran, los 2, con su hijo.
Si al menos no lo ponian en el Resumen, lo podrian haber dejado como un Extra no?, no seria mala idea.
Y un Error espantozo que tiene este Dvd, es que en el Extra que dice ""Trailer"" esta el Trailer de la Telenovela Rubi, no el de Amor Real, se ve que se confundieron o se les paso ese Detalle Importante.
La Entrada esta Editada, le pusieron la cancion Amor Real de Sin Bandera desde el comienzo, sin el Efecto de los Caballos que se escuchaban en la Entrada Original de la Transmision Televisiva.
Por otra parte considero que del Gran Final dejaron muy poco, de un capitulo que duro de mas 40 Minutos Originalmente lo resumen a 10 o 11 Minutos de Duracion, lo cual se notan cortes bruscos, sobre todo el Final de Antonia, la Villana de la Telenovela, que no se ve, y me parece Pesimo, ya que Chantal Andere tenia muy buena actuacion a lo largo de la historia e hizo muy bien su Papel Antagonico, y sin embargo en el Dvd no se sabe que pasa con ella despues.
En la Edicion de los Capitulos note 3 cosas que no me gustaron, una es que la Escena en que Silvano se lleva a Manuel y a Rosario en la Carreta, no esta completa, se ve cuando Silvano cae pero no cuando la carreta se da vuelta y cae al agua, la cortaron a esa escena, en cambio en el Especial se ve pero en el Dvd de la Edicion de Capitulos no. Y otra cosa que note es que hay una Escena en el Dvd 1, Lado 2, de cuando Manuel habla con alguien sobre Marie de la Roquette, hay un dialogo mal cortado en el Dvd.
No se ve que pasa con Marie de la Roquette despues que aparece la Verdadera y que matan a Ramon Marquez, su complice.
En cuanto al Producto, los Discos me llegaron bastante feos, maltratados, algo Rayados, pero aun asi, se ven perfectamente, sin problemas.",1298505600,4,3053,4.311304347826087

This edited version takes out the wooing that the main character did and the courtship and going on of the female main character.  It is ashame that who ever edited this version you took out such scenes that endeared me to this telenovela.

This condensed version doesn't do AMOR REAL justice.  How can the producer/s lump the 95 episodes into just about 4 1/2 hours?  For someone who hasn't seen the entire episodes, the shortened version would not make a lot of sense.  Fortunately for me, I saw every episode, so I didn't get confused.

Some people might think I'm crazy to want to buy the complete episodes.  Perhaps I am!  But AMOR REAL is worth spending all that money.  I've seen many other telenovelas or soaps, but none of them compelled me enough to buy even the condensed version.  The chemistry between Adela and Fernando was absolutely undeniable!

The students do NOT get bored.  The characters are extremely attractive, but--unlike many other telenovelas--their costumes are not too revealing.  (The 1850's setting really helps!)  There are equal amounts of passion and low-grade violence to keep both girls and boys interested.  A few scenes need fast-forwarding, but with a mature group watching almost all of the DVD is appropriate.

The fact that there are English subtitles is a huge bonus.  You find yourself reading the subtitles first (as they tend to flash up on screen just before the dialogue is said) and then listening to the Spanish to ""cement"" the words in the target language in your head.

The 4 1/2 hour running time means that you could show the telenovela once a week for about six weeks.  I made a ""family tree"" of sorts and a character synopsis to get students familiarized with the characters and require students to write a 100-word episode summary of each day's viewing.

2213496,4,B0007IO7BS,"This DVD presentation consists of 2 double sided DVD's with a total playing time of 436 minutes. It has  English subtitles that can be turned on and off.  The first DVD contains  the actual story - divided into 17 chapters to which the viewer has access from the main menu - as obtained by putting together very short film clips from the original  episodes.  The second DVD includes additional material as follows: Presentation by Carla Estrada, Executive Producer, The special Amor Real para La Historia (which aired in the United States approximately one week after the last episode of the telenovela, Bloopers, The presentation of prizes to the actors and other people who made Amor Real possible, and a (relatively long) preview of the telenovela Rubi'.

The first DVD could be viewed as a synopsis of the original work, and it is masterfully put together in that the story unfolds smoothly while the viewer - unless aware of it - does not  realize that he/she watching the condensed version of a longer original.  The only problem with this approach is in that our viewer does not get to know  the characters to any extensive depth - and most of them are worth knowing, for example, Augusta, the mother (so beautifully  portrayed by Helena Rojo).  Also, one misses some longer scenes, along with the short film clips.  They would have been worth having.

The special ""Un Amor Real para la Historia"" on the second DVD, is another short version of the original story, and seems somewhat more interesting in that it includes  speeches and discussions by actors, other crew members, reporters, who provide information about the Ciudad Trinidad (a town built especially for the telenovela), about the dresses, the makeup, the hair styles, the photography, etc.

The other titles on the second DVD are self explanatory.

I was also happy that this telenovela was coming to DVD since I wasn't able to watch every episode. I purchased the DVD the day it came out and I was very pleased with it.

The DVD has the most pivotal parts of Amor Real. It didn't bother me as much as it bothered other reviewers. It would have been very expensive if every single episode was released on DVD, it would take up more than 15 DVD discs!

At the time, the majority of telenovelas were good. As I grew older I slowly lost interest in telenovelas. In my opinion, they were getting a little to trashy; the story line, the twist and turns became to unrealistic for me.

 My feeling all changed when I came across Amor Real. In my eyes, Amor Real was created with a solid and realistic story line. From beginning to end Amor Real was suspenseful, it had me on the tip of my seat (couch) the entire time.

 Set in the 19th century Amor Real is based on two characters who fall in love but are unable to love each other freely because of there social and economical status. Throughout the episodes there are dramatic twist and turns, which will take you on an emotional roller coaster.

Amor Real is the #1 telenovela in the United States and in Mexico. In Mexico there was an out cry for a re-run of the entire novela; a situation never encountered by producers.

The love triangle between Manuel Fuentes-Guerra (Fernando Colunga), Matilde Pealver (Adela Noriega) and Adolfo Solis (Mauricio Islas) is full of layers and intrigue that make this series far from the usual rosy and sweet love story that characterizes most Televisa productions. Mauricio Islas captivated me with his compelling portrayal of the very complex Adolfo Solis. I came to care about him more than the two leads. I also enjoyed the work of Ernesto Laguardia as the gambling addict, black sheep son (a nice departure from his usual good guy roles) and Kika Edgar as the sweet Catalina Heredia. Chantal Adere was great once again as the female antagonist and I enjoyed the addition of the beautiful Leticia Calderon as the tomboyish Jana De La Corcuera. And who could forget Mariana Levy? This is the last we'll see of this talented actress after her tragic demise just a few days ago. Also, I loved the storyline and its backdrop of the Mexican Revolution. The costumes, historical setting and picturesque views of the Mexican countryside are breathtaking. I thought the English subtitles were great as well.  All in all, this is one of the best stories and one of the most lavish productions Televisa (Mexican television network/production company) has created in a long time and I wish I had made the time to watch the whole thing. The DVD extras are a keeper -- though I am not impressed with the fact that Mauricio Islas was not included in the Actors' Trajectory menu (and all because he now works for the competitive US-based network Telemundo).

2213536,5,B0007IO7BS,"I, like so many of you, adored Amor Real when it was on TV, and a part of me would love to own the whole thing. However, the part of me that lives in the real world doesn't have the time or money to own a 120-hour soap on dvd. I have a friend who does dvd authoring for a living, and she said that the entire series would take up maybe 15-20 discs. If the 2-disc version costs $20 or $25, how much would a 20-disc version cost? Probably a lot more than anybody would want to spend, even if they could afford it. And it would take months to watch.

Besides, this version has English subtitles, so my friends, the majority of whom don't speak Spanish, can get in on the fun. Fabulous outfits aside, it's just no good if they can't follow the plot!

I personally would be thrilled to have a compact, affordable version of my favorite soap. Anything beyond this would be overkill.",1112572800,22,876,4.208333333333333
2213537,3,B0007IO7BS,I wish that this dvd was as good as the tv soap. The dvd did not have the same footage. Infact the dvd only had highlights that take away from this great novela. The tv soap is A++ but if you are looking for ALL the footage don't waste your time or money here!,1112486400,5,260,3.8333333333333335

8047581,1,B0007IO7BS,Very disappointing! The story line is so fragmented - jumps from one topic to another without continuity. So difficult to follow. I also do not see the point of an extra DVD showing how the series was produced etc! I am not interested on how they made the series. I wanted to see a complete or at least a story that makes sense. Lots of important story lines were omitted and therefore it makes it so hard to follow! The ending is horrible.,1487808000,,440,4.313253012048193
8047582,1,B0007IO7BS,"This was a huge disappointment. The editing was so fierce in order to condense it to a couple of discs, that the storyline hardly made any sense and scenes would jump in a flash from one scene to the next with no thought for storyline continuity.  The ending seemed quite ridiculous after the action moved at such a fast pace, it was all over before I knew it.  From the ""making of"" section I gather it was a big deal in Mexico and the producers put a huge effort into making this an amazing production. I feel it's a rip-off to then condense it to such a degree that it becomes a joke.  I will not be buying these telenovelas again.",1484179200,,633,4.214876033057851
