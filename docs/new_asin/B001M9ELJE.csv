8320723,2,B001M9ELJE,"Pretty disappointing for a Murnau. I didn't expect horror, I figured if there was a creepy, horroresque Murnau film literally about a haunted castle, we'd have heard more about it long ago. What you get instead is a pretty tepid mystery/morality play that's a cinch to figure out, and not particularly atmospheric or very interesting. Even the crime at hand happened before the film begins. It's great to see any silent film from a notable director like Murnau made readily available and in such appreciable form, but were it not a Murnau film, I doubt it would be getting much, if any attention today.",1341619200,4,602,4.798076923076923
8320724,2,B001M9ELJE,"I was SO looking forward to this one because I love silents and my favorite talkie genre is The Haunted House. This one is b o r i n g. The print, however, is gorgeous...",1241913600,2,170,3.8857142857142857
8320725,4,B001M9ELJE,"If you are looking for a haunted house-type horror film, this isn't one of them. Its instead a murder-mystery: a murder has occurred a few years ago, several people are now assembled within a castle, most of them assume a certain one of them committed the murder. One of the group disappears, a shot rings out.....

While not on par with Murnau's more well-known films, such as Nosferatu, Faust, or The Last Laugh, this one is still worth watching. The restoration is excellent with only a few scratches here and there, and as always, Kino has done a superb job in the transfer. The special features are minimal, consisting of some passages from the original novel and a few photos of set design paintings.

If you are building a collection of Murnau films or German expressionism films (this barely qualifies as one), then you need to have a copy of this.",1238284800,6,856,4.662251655629139
8320726,4,B001M9ELJE,"It is extremely rare to be able to see a silent film that looks as good as this one does much less one of this vintage (1921). The movie looks as if it were shot yesterday and that's without a ton of restoration work. Only David Shepard's 1999 release of Rudolph Valentino's COBRA (1925) looks this good under those conditions. It shows us what all silent films would have looked like if we could see them in first generation prints that have been speed corrected.

As far as the movies of Murnau are concerned, this is definitely a minor offering but that has to do with the material not the director. Murnau is honing his skills here which would burst forth in his next film, the legendary NOSFERATU (1922). The sets are elaborate with just a touch of Expressionism. The performances though are very Expressionistic and might be too much for someone unfamiliar with German silent film technique. The plot loosely reminds me of Jean Renoir's RULES OF THE GAME though not as refined.

THE HAUNTED CASTLE (not a horror film but a psychological study) is not the ideal place to start if you want to see what Murnau was capable of. Try NOSFERATU, THE LAST LAUGH, or FAUST for that but it is a great way to see how beautiful a silent film could be, even for one that's not a classic. In fact its lesser status may be why it has survived in such good shape since it wasn't popular enough for the prints to get worn out.",1237939200,13,1414,4.434615384615385
