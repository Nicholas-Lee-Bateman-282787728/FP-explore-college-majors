As we are to expect from Daft Punk, the preview looks as if its all robotic, surreal, technologic and yeah given that their videos have been THE S**TTTT!!!!! we're to think this movie is also as good, well...

It's expensive, BORING, pointless, going nowhere, it's a bad story (actually there's no real good story in here) and the only good thing is that everyone in the movie is a robot... Besides that, it SUCKS!

Don't buy it...

You'll hate Daft Punk for producing such garbage...

However, this movie isn't filled with daft punk music (or much music at all for that matter). It is titled ""Daft Punk's"" Electroma simply because the two musicians play the starring roles in the film.

There are actually long scenes where it is pretty near silent, and there is absolutely NO dialogue in the entire film

to put it lightly, this movie rules

this movie is -
-a science-fiction masterpiece
-deeply touching and personal
-a surreal, hallucinagenic art movie
-a visually stunning epic that spans breathtakingly beautiful landscapes

It is for the type of person who will spend a long time looking at art or listening to music and doing nothing else; it is not much like Interstella 5555 at all.

8222281,5,B000WC4AT8,"I had to watch this on YouTube since the DVD is a little high for my taste. Anyways, this is a SOLID art film. For those unfamliar with that term; you're pretty much in for a surreal, visually stimulating experience. There's no dialogue, or very little for that matter, and the only narrative you get is from what you're seeing on screen.

The story follows 2 robots who are on a quest to become human. I won't spoil the rest because it really is worth seeing. It's an awesome concept and should be seen by film fans and Daft Punk fans alike. Like I said before though, this is an art film. Expect to be weirded out, know that theres no dialogue, and watch it with patience and an open mind.

I hope you enjoy it.",1398384000,,713,4.235294117647059
8222282,4,B000WC4AT8,"This is not a typical ""band promo movie""; the soundtrack does not contain even a single song by Daft Punk.  The plot is straight forward and clear, and the progression of it is stretched over long cuts (think ""2001: A Space Odyssey""...remember watching the space station spin....and spin.....and spin....) of uneventful scenes with beautiful scenery and cinematography; if you cannot find any pleasure or lasting appreciation of the visuals and do not care to spend the long scenes speculating over what might lie between the plot lines, then you will definitely be bored to tears (at best).  There is no dialogue.

It's definitely not for everyone.  Personally, I enjoyed it, but I saw it for free before deciding to spend money on it (and I recommend you do the same; look on Youtube or dailymotion - the audio/video quality will be garbage compared to the DVD, but you'll know what to expect.  I knew what I was getting, and I generally like silent, eclectic, and generally eccentric films as long as I find them visually appealing (and as a hobbyist nature/landscape/outdoors photographer, this was kind of right up my alley for half of the film).",1394064000,,1151,4.8820512820512825

8222285,4,B000WC4AT8,"A bit pretentious, a bit obvious, overlong, even at 74 minutes (this would have been a
brilliant 40 minute short), but still full of arresting images and surprisingly emotional moments.

Influenced heavily by Kubrick, Antonioni and most of the great 60s and 70s visualists, this
is a wordless film about two robots who want to become human.  The action is minimal.
The opening drive through the desert alone takes a good 15 minutes.

But it's wonderfully shot, and the use of eclectic source music as score (Brian Eno, Curtis
Mayfield, etc) is interesting, if sometimes a little too self-conscious or intrusive.

I doubt there are more layers to be found on repeated viewings, I think it is what it is:
an experimental film more full of image than story or ideas.  A 74 minute, interesting rock video.

8222287,4,B000WC4AT8,"The movie tells a very slow story in mostly silent images accompanied by atmospheric music tracks.

My suspicion about this movie is that it was meant to be for ""Human After All"" what ""Stellar555"" was for their album ""Discovery"" - a movie-length video clip.
It is true that the film runs along the album in almost perfect sync if you cue up the beginning of the DVD with the beginning of the CD.

I bet that somewhere along the way, they realized that the heaviness of the dance beats was damaging the human sensitivity of story and the images, so they replaced it with other, more ""gentle"" and emotionally suggestive music.
So - fyi - there is no Daft Punk music on this DVD.

Some of the tracks they chose are nicely discovered rarities, others are classical music tracks such as Allegri's ""Miserere"" an Chopin's ""Prelude Nr. 4"" - not that these pieces are out of place here or would disturb in any any way - I think this is one of the most emotionally effective placements of the ""Misere"" I have seen so far. :)

I think this movie works best for people who (like Daft Punk themselves - and me) grew up in the 70ies/early 80ies, as the cinematography clearly evokes 1970ies widescreen classics such as 2001 and Zabriskie Point. Hipgnosis album artwork (e.g. Pink Floyd ""Wish you were here"") is another noticeable influence.
It contains many beautiful shots of the Californian back country - much of it was shot around Independence, CA and around Death Valley.

The story is in fact very human and touching, but also very melancholic. It does progress so slowly that we are frequently, if not almost always, thrown back to admiring the beautiful imagery, which works well most of the time. There are moments at which we clearly see what they were going for, and it *almost* works.

But I consider this a charming aspect of this movie: It doesn't reach the unapproachable glossiness of its 1970ies antetypes completely but maintains an aura of ""dedicated amateurism"" - a quasi ""home-made"" remake of 1970ies widescreen tropes. The subtle but pervasive imperfections make the sequences that look and work perfectly stand out even more.

There are some extreme lengths of ""Daft Punk walking through the desert"" around 2/3rds in, but the end sequence is once more successful at combining strong images, silent symbolism and emotional depth.
It does wrap up in a quite powerful way in the end.

Not for everyone, not for every occasion.
(I always fast forward through some of the ""walking"")",1316131200,4,2486,4.765116279069767
