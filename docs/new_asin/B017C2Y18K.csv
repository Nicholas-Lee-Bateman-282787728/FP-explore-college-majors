7498780,2,B017C2Y18K,"I had hoped this move would explore the subject matter more closely, but was pretty disappointed. There were so many opportunities to dive into the tensions between Islam and homophobia (internalized or otherwise), and even Islamophobia, and all that rose to the surface were missed opportunities to dive deeper amid routine platitudes of 'haram' this, 'haram' that. What could have been two innocents getting caught in a tangled web fell flat. The whole FBI/terror angle was so unbelievable. It could have set up the story to cause the characters to deal with their conflict, but instead showcased a high-heeled FBI agent walking Brooklyn supposedly stalking Muslim kids cum....gun buyers...?...or....gay kids hawking lotto tickets? I guess she had extra time. But, we only get that it's a 'crime to lie to a federal agent' out of this engagement; something that feels like your mom scolding you. There's hardly any innocence against tyranny feel generated here, and no sympathy for the characters. The highest drama here is boyfriends battling it out over not texting each other. Oh, and the halal chicken fiasco. If this film's emotional journey was plotted like a stereo equalizer you'd come out with a flat-line. The movie finishes on an unexplainably merciful note, but only because it's finally over.",1454803200,9,1307,5.199052132701421
