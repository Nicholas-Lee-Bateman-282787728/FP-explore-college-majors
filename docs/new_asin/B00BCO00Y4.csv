5578919,1,B00BCO00Y4,"really... trying to justify? Life has changed since then and we need to be using today's standards, not going by yesterdays.",1380067200,14,124,4.9523809523809526
5578920,3,B00BCO00Y4,"While very informative, in the end this gave me an uneasy feeling that it was made by HEBOphiles who were trying to justify their perversion.  Sorry, I'm a 36 year old man, and I do not find 16 year old girls attractive.  Also, driven by ""human nature"" or some crap from the stone age or not, if a 20 year old man thinks it's okay to associate intimately with one of my daughters when they are 13, they will find themselves associating intimately with my fist and/or a loaded firearm. :)

I also think that the title is a bit misleading, since it really does not explore the question posed, so much as it defines the differences between sexual attraction to different age groups and tries to demonize (admittedly occasionally overzealous) laws regarding pedophilia.  This, in turn, reinforced my uneasy feeling that the film was trying to sway me into sympathizing with sick degenerate wastes of human flesh whom I don't feel should have the right to breathe.  Obviously, it has not succeeded in changing my position on such matters.

Overall, this is a well made documentary with some interesting, though often easily disputed, information and explainations for certain human behaviors.  I recommend that all parents watch this, since it might give you a little better insight into the real danger that exists in the world.  It actually put my guard for my children even higher, though I previously thought that was not possible.  I was especially surprised by the interview with the female pedophile who managed to verbally seal her eternally being labeled as disgustingly poor excuse for a human being.  Her self-amused sense of accomplishment dripped thick like honey as she dared to refer to a person as her ""friend"" while describing how she had taken advantage of an already stressful situation in order to molest the woman's child right under her nose!  You may never accept a dinner invitation from a female acquantence again, once you've viewed this segment.

The final expert interview segment speculates that, one day, our society will accept pedophilia as a sexual orientation and even goes as far as to compare it to homosexuality. This was highly offensive even to me, though I'm heterosexual. While I understand their attempt to make such a clinical comparison, it still ended up sounding like another attempt at justification of perverse and potentially harmful sexual urges.

In the closing statements, they again point out that ancient cultures practiced and even promoted hebophilia. It all ends with the narrator ranting about teenagers being sexually mature, love being blind, and 18 being just a number.  (Creepy much?) This opened the window wide open for me and completely solidified my earlier feeling that this film had dubious intentions.

Filmmakers, rest assured that I, and people like me, will fight to the end to assure that pedophilia is never openly accepted in mainstream American culture. In fact, your movie had awakened me to the urgency of the situation, rather than softening be to the idea.  Thank you for that.

Lastly, this stars Dick Swaab, and that name is hillarious.",1413158400,16,3113,4.978764478764479
5578921,1,B00BCO00Y4,"This is complete and utter MRA propaganda.  ""Feel sorry for men because people think we're pedophiles!  Lower the age of consent so we won't be considered predatory creeps!  Hebophilia is not so bad!  There's no such thing as power imbalance and coercion in a relationship with a huge age difference ESPECIALLY when the older partner is a man.  Oh, it's so perfectly NATURAL for men to harass and lust after 16 year old teenage girls because that is the optimal reproductive age!""  Well you said it yourself in the film - we have much longer lifespans now, and having children at 16 just isn't the norm anymore.  This is a ridiculous documentary.  Spare yourself the time and the money and do not even give it a moment of your time.

5578922,5,B00BCO00Y4,"Having read through the posted comments, prior to actually watching the film, it is apparent that these negative comments were most likely posted by people who only watched the first few minutes of the movie and then either stopped watching, or just skimmed through the rest, before applying their own beer-garden expertise to form an opinion.  Contrary to several other comments here, this film DOES NOT promote an agenda, twisted or otherwise, beyond providing an education about a very emotionally-charged, distasteful subject.  The vast majority (in my opinion about 99+%) of individuals in our society are far too self-righteous, and ignorant, to even consider that there are facts regarding human sexuality that they don't already know from experience.  Their immature, uneducated thinking results in viewers that filter out any information which does not match what they are so sure they already know, and therefore refuse to hear.  Again, contrary to the other comments, this film DOES NOT suggest, recommend, or encourage that mature adults should engage in sexual activity with mentally/emotionally immature young persons.  My wife and I watched the complete documentary; taken in its entirety the film, depending on the viewer's own emotional sensibilities, does present several very uncomfortable, ""makes you squirm moments, and therefore, just like my wife and I, you will probably be tempted to stop watching midway through the film; please resist that urge, otherwise you will not only deprive yourself of some very worthwhile and thought-provoking information; you will also be left with a very misconceived opinion of the film overall.  If you are able to watch the entire documentary without allowing any peer-imposed, p.c., preconceptions to filter out the inconvenient, or disagreeable facts,  you will very likely come away with a much clearer, and worthwhile, understanding of the overall subject.

This bears repeating; if you fail to watch the entire film without allowing preconceptions to block out the facts, you will not have a true understanding of the information, or even the film itself.",1407196800,12,2119,5.4
5578923,4,B00BCO00Y4,"Nine Things about the Movie Are All Men Pedophiles? [Netherlands, 2012]

1. This is an unusual documentary about the natural attractions that men have to younger girls. It weaves together threads from evolution, religion, psychology, and society.

2. A lot of time is spent explaining that what a lot of people consider pedophilia is really hebephilia (which is attraction to adolescents). This distinction is very important to narrator/director Jan-Willem Breure.

3. There are interviews with victims of pedophiles, and admitted pedophiles.

4. The movie highlights the hypocrisy of western culture, which condemns attraction to younger girls while simultaneously portraying girls as sex objects, especially in the fashion industry.

5. The movie does a remarkable job of walking a fine line on the subject... as much as one can. It seeks to understand the different forms of mens attraction to girls, without condemning all forms outright. This has caused controversy, and the director has been accused of not having a strong enough agenda, making him kind of suspicious.

6. The movie also makes the case that the fear of pedophilia has gone too far, that paranoia is taking over, and that men and boys are being taught that they are naturally a danger to girls.

7. There is a weird strangeness to the film, due to the way the interviews are edited. The people move and talk in slightly abnormal ways, almost like they were computer generated. Its very creative, but its also very distracting.

8. After the credits, you see director/narrator Jan-Willem Breure give his own answer to the question in the title of the film. Its sort of a bold answer.

9. This is an interesting, confrontational, and sometimes uncomfortable examination of human sexuality. It leaves you feeling that love and desire are hopelessly uncontrollable, no matter how society tries to structure them.",1403740800,37,1880,5.157894736842105
5578924,1,B00BCO00Y4,"This film is not about men having sex with children. This documentary is about promoting the idea that it is natural for men to be attracted to 16 year old girl's because they are sexually mature, or preteens that I guess look like they are sexually mature.

Yeah, sure they briefly mention adults having same sex with children, and that women did too. But this is primarily about men and their sexual desires for healthy young 16 year old sexually mature girls, and how they are absolutely unable to control this desire because it's natural to desire young girls right when they become mature. And it is okay because it has been well documented in multiple cultures throughout the course of human history.

But I would also like to mention that infanticide has also been widely practiced all throughout human history across many cultures. Maybe that is also a natural human desire we have too that cannot be controlled. I look forward to a documentary on that. I'm sure it will be just as fascinating as this one. NOT!

However, I will say that I think you can decide who you want to have sex with when you're 16. An I don't consider sex with a 16 year old pedophilia. I also think It's a dumb thing to get a record for it. But since this documentary is specifically addressing the desires of men. It doesn't really express sexual pressure put on young girl's by men. Which I'm sure originally has to do with why these laws exist, but after time laws become obsolete. And as women become more empowered these laws start to make less and less sense to people because they forget how new woman's rights are. And that there are 16 year old girls that are perfectly capable deciding who they want to have sex with.

But the whole survival of the fittest thing is bulls***. Because young girls that just get their period and get pregnant often die because their body isn't developed enough to have children. So the whole women having children at 13  being evolutionary beneficial is bogus. They'll die if their hips aren't wide enough because the baby won't be able to pass. They end up staying in labor for too long and the baby dies when it finally comes out. If the mother survives she'll have a hole with perpetual urine leakage.

Also what if a woman is in her twenties but she still looks youthful or doesn't look very different from when she was a teen and men are sexually attracted to her? They don't really discuss the possibility of men just being attracted to healthy women. And not all 16 year olds look 16. Some look really young and underdeveloped. What if you're 13 and you look 16? I don't think you can fault a guy for being attracted. But all of the focus is on age. Not on appearance.

For instance when they talk about the fashion industry. Almost all models do not look sexually mature. They have no hips, waist, and no boobs. If you look at Victoria secret model's 20 years ago compared to now they look much more adolescent, much more like boys. They don't take into account how much culture changes over time and how it impacts our thoughts and how we feel about social matters. I mean come on seriously? If you go into a sex shop all the mannequins have huge hips, and boobs. They don't look like 13 year old girls. I'm not saying a girl's needs an hour glass figure to attract men. But honestly a woman's body and appearance is symbolic of the kind place you're in and what that culture is like. Next time you're in a mall look at the forms of the mannequins for each store. Then look at mannequins in sex shops and in ghetto areas. You'll be surprised in the difference of what specific stores promote for an attractive female body.

This documentary is trying to make a large generalization to promote the idea that sex with a preteen, 13 year old, and up is okay if they consent. They throw some bs science at you to make it all seem legit. It doesn't focus on what it is about the body alone that attracts men. They're trying to create some universal truth that I'm not convinced it exists. Also humans don't act on complete instinct. I don't think anyone knows what our true instincts are. All I know is that culture dictates what we are attracted to and it continuously changes.",1403568000,11,4207,4.475880052151239
5578925,3,B00BCO00Y4,"This film is well done and intriguing. It's pretty obvious that they are trying to prove the point that it should be okay to have sex with an adolescent, since they are ""sexually mature."" The film, of course, does say it should never be okay to have sex with children before puberty, because it could be damaging and they do not understand lust, etc. It ends saying ""18 is just a number"" and that love is blind. It also argues that all men would prefer 16 year olds, if they had the choice, and maybe one day having sex with adolescents will/should be approved. The thing that bothers me is that at no point do they talk about how teenagers aren't MENTALLY mature enough to handle a sexual relationship with an adult. So in the end, I was left feeling like this film definitely had a hidden agenda: Men don't want to be viewed as perverts for wanting to have sex with teenagers, and they want you to believe it's normal and should be accepted. My argument is that the teenage years can be a very confusing time. Many young girls are naive and seeking attention or validation, so they are easily taken advantage of. Having the legal age of consent be 18 is to protect those girls. Sure, in an ideal world, all adults would have good intentions and teenagers would be mature beyond their years...but that's just not the world we live in folks.",1402012800,29,1341,4.455284552845528
5578926,4,B00BCO00Y4,"ARE ALL MEN PEDOPHILES?, so the title of the 2013 documentary asks.  Depending on the culture and the times, an adult having sex with a teen-ager could be considered normal, or a crime.  I don't need the difference between the letter of the law with the spirit of the law explained to me, but this film did teach me that adult women, albeit in smaller numbers than male perpetrators, also take advantage of children, including kids who have yet to reach puberty. Until viewing ARE ALL MEN PEDOPHILES?, I was not sure that a woman could be born with that gene.

Even if you don't see this film, note that the clinical definition of pedophilia is having sex with a child younger than or just arriving at the puberty age.  The legal definition?  Politics, as usual.",1400889600,5,762,4.573529411764706
5578927,5,B00BCO00Y4,"Equality at 16 is a great step forward. But what about the sexual rights and welfare of those under 16? Although we wish otherwise, nowadays most teenagers  gay and straight  are having sex well before the age of 16. Many are sexually illiterate because of inadequate sex education. Few receive detailed safer sex advice, and most have no ready access to condoms. The age of consent is often used as a justification. Teachers fear being accused of encouraging criminal behaviour.

Their sex advice to pupils under 16 tends to be vague, euphemistic  and useless. They never dare promote the obvious: oral sex and mutual masturbation as safer alternatives to intercourse  even though these alternatives can reduce the risk of HIV infection and prevent unwanted pregnancy. This withholding of practical information is partly due to the unrealistically high age of consent, which criminalises under-age relations.

Consent Equals Indecent Assault

Sixteen is a totally arbitrary age of consent. It originates from 1885, when consent was raised from 13. There is, however, no medical or psychological evidence that 16 (as opposed to 14 or any other age) is the age of sexual or emotional maturity.

The legal effect of consent at 16 is to criminalise youngsters below that age who have consensual sex. The law says that no person under 16 is capable of giving their consent to a sexual act. Any such consensual relationship is automatically deemed an indecent assault. Two 14 year olds who have a mutually agreed relationship risk maximum penalties ranging from 10 years to life imprisonment (depending on their sex and the nature of their sexual acts).

Romeo and Juliet is one of the greatest love stories of all time. But if these young lovers, aged 14 and 13, were living in Britain today, their fate would be equally star-crossed. The law brands as criminal anyone who is sexually active at those ages. In a modern-day equivalent scenario, the parents of a 13 year old girl would not have to plot and scheme like the Capulets. They could get rid of their daughters boyfriend by reporting him to the police and having him arrested. Some parents do exactly that!

Although the number of young people under 16 arrested for consenting sex is small, that is no consolation to those who are arrested. One unjust arrest is one too many.

There are, however, many more instances of young men just above the age of consent getting arrested for consensual sex with girls just under the age of consent  about 300 a year in the UK. Most are ratted on by disapproving parents or jealous ex-partners.",1396656000,20,2586,4.905963302752293
5578928,1,B00BCO00Y4,"Their title is saying every man wants to be with someone under 18. Which is an over generalization, but at the end the narrator says pedophiles are those who find under 18 year oldes attractive.
Under that definition then all adults are pedophiles because they can see that an under 18 old has developed their adult body.

The film explains the difference between society's definition and the professional definition.
Which varies by 5 years and the professional definition has three sub - categories.
However, the film suggest ed that 13-18 years old (hebophilia) attraction is ok.

It shows the pain it causes victims of pedophiles, and the struggles of those who are attracted to children and don't act on it.
However, the film seems to try to justify hebophilia because of evolution reasons, but they to stress the part of concent.

8566271,1,B00BCO00Y4,"Over and over, made up figures are presented as facts.  The documentary purpose is to influence and convince others that it's normal for men to want to be with girls.  SICK SICK SICK.",1525737600,,183,4.515151515151516
8566272,2,B00BCO00Y4,"This film was directed by a 23 year old boy and self proclaimed ""hebephile."" It's obvious to me as a viewer what the underlying agenda of this film is; because the director has an overwhelming obsession with teenage girls, he wants to normalize his attraction. I feel he's contradicting himself a lot here, though, as he tries to make a solid argument for the normalcy of being attracted to underage kids.

1) He mentions being ""attracted to girls as young as 15,"" in an interview outside of the film, which doesn't  qualify as pedophilia or hebephilia. It would be ephebophilia (15-19).  I do kind of understand why people lump all these categories into the overarching""pedo"" group, But the director seems intent on differentiating, so why isn't he doing so?

2) The fertility argument and claim that ALL MEN are attracted to youth over all doesn't account for the men who openly and aggressively pursue older women, or even women their own age. How narcissistic is it to assume that every single person of a certain gender is attracted to exactly what you're attracted to? Proof to the contrary exists all around us, if not in the majority of men then at least in a substantial portion of them. To ignore that fact makes this documentary seem extremely weak and biased. Of course there are tons and tons of men who are attracted to underage girls. There are also tons and tons of men who are gay, into older women, dogs, horses, inflatable pool toys, you name it. There is no limit to the possibilities.

3) The evolutionary/biological aspect of the film focuses on heterosexual men's attraction to teenage girls. The idea that young girls are most attractive because of their fertility. Aside from evidence showing that girls under 16 or so do not have the optimal physical or mental capacity to be considered prime reproductive mates, this argument also doesn't account GAY pedophiles, or female pedophiles, both of which exist in great numbers. If it's all about fertility-what makes a gay man attracted to a little boy? It's not for his reproductive abilties.

4) The saddest thing about this documentary, and the most aggravating, is the same thing I've encountered in the minds of other pedophiles- their arguments are all about justifying what's best for them, what fulfills their needs. They're not the young object of desire, they're the pursuer, and nothing in this documentary really covers the feelings of insecurity and pain that a young victim of sexual manipulation feels as they grow up. So what if a man finds a 13 year old girl soooo hot? Maybe that's normal, (I don't think it is) but hypothetically,so what if it is? Of course he wants her. But what does she want? At the moment, to be loved, and taken care of....but what about as an adult? She's thrown in the trash or neglected because her body isn't a pedophilic shrine any longer? What does that tell a person about their value? A pedophile seems to have no regard for this aspect of the relationship.",1454112000,13,2978,4.772815533980583
8566273,2,B00BCO00Y4,"This is an interesting concept, and I can see how this film definitely makes most people feel uncomfortable. It brings up some excellent points about the sexual nature of humanity. The writers made good points by referencing the historical perspectives of societies on sexuality. Also, SOME of the interviews were good. Other interviews were silly, and they did not seem legitimate, especially the ""reenacted"" interview. There is definitely a clear deliniation of psychological and moral terms regarding sexuality, which adds some legitimacy and is mildly interesting. Stylistically, this film needs some help. The narrator speaks to the audience as if they are stupid, in a slow monotone, and that totally detracts from the point of the film, a point which I believe was to make the audience think and consider different perspectives; this film failed to do this. The correct spelling of ""psycological"" is PSYCHOLOGICAL! How can a film be taken seriously if it attempts to give psychological perspectives, and the filmmakers cannot even spellcheck? This seemed as if it was nothing more than a glorified Powerpoint attempting to be a film. Again, some of the points were excellent, but as a film, this is poorly done.",1437264000,5,1218,5.187817258883249
8566274,5,B00BCO00Y4,"Most of the bad reviews are people who are using their emotions over their brain. This movie does not advocate pedophilia.

Someone already explained it very clearly that having sex with teens isn't advantageous for the species due to the fact that it is dangerous for the immature female and the baby. Just because the hormones kick in doesn't mean ones body is physically fully capable to handle the trauma of having a baby. Our ancestors knew of this, so they avoid it. There is even recorded history of teens having babies and either the mother died or suffered physical injuries which caused the female to be permanently sterile or worse become unattractive to her husband due to injuries towards her privates thus she lived her life in total exile to die alone and in poverty (there is recorded documents of this happening from the dark ages to early 20th century and even now in the 21st century due to the practice of teen marriages failing due to undeveloped uterus). Men like the director of this mockcumentary are pervs who use terrible faulty science and history to justify their pathetic fantasies and beliefs. As a mockumentary this would be interesting to watch, but since it is categorized as a documentary (supposed to have actual real science facts) I give it one star for lack of real data.",1428278400,7,1309,4.822222222222222

8566278,5,B00BCO00Y4,"I give this a qualified 5 stars because its message, while educational, can be easily abused. The thesis of the documentary is that all men are pedophiles by the broad, Western definition, which says sex with and sexual attraction to minors under 18 is wrong. The documentary does a credible job of explaining the difference between clinical pedophilia (attraction to pre-pubescents, generally <13 years old) and hebephilia (attraction to 13-18 year olds. It argues that hebephila is normal and should be accepted.

Note that some clinical sources say hebephilia is attraction to pubescents around ages 11-14 and ephebophilia covers late adolecents aged 15-19.

It is true enough that throughout most of human history, marriage to young teens has been approved of by society. Also, biologically, most heterosexual males are attracted to most any girl with a sexually developed body. This is borne out by the fact that interested males must sometimes check a girl's ID.

So, case made: hebophilia is normal. But should acting on attraction to young teens by legal adults be accepted? I think in most cases the answer is a solid no.

The documentary needed to explore more about why we set up 18 as a society for the age of sexual consent. The documentary claims the reason is because this is how long it takes to complete high school. I believe there is much more to it than that.

The core issue with clinical pedophilia and hebephilia is the exploitation of vulnerable people. Teenagers are still developing basic life skills, are less emotionally mature and have few financial options if saddled with a child from a relationship gone bad. These are at least some of the reasons why Western society considers teenagers under 18 to be legally children.

I fear that many people will watch this documentary or one like it and say, See, it is okay to pursue a relationship with this young teen I met because it is normal. I doubt such people will bother to consider what is in that vulnerable teens best interests. Most parents get this problem instinctively as evidenced by the passionately worded 1 star reviews here. They know that a 20 or 30 or 40 year-old dating their 14 year-old child is a bad recipe for a long-term stable relationship for many, many reasons that they shouldnt have to enumerate.

In Western society, except *maybe* in cases of close age, someone over 18 pursuing someone under 18 as a love interest is simply an awful idea that has little conceivable justification. Almost always, a minor will be in no position to protect his or her own financial, emotional, educational and social well-being should the relationship sour. Hence, there are laws to protect such young people.",1425340800,12,2699,4.905701754385965
8566279,1,B00BCO00Y4,"Horrible: As a single mother, I thought this would be interesting and tactful documentary... boy was I wrong.... after watching this I felt like I just spent an hour listing to the justification of a pedophile (frankly, I felt disgusted). The film ends by talking about love and saying age is just a number... I'm all about light and love, but associating sexual desire for a child with love, is not love... sorry.  Protecting and wanting the best for a child (or anyone), is love.
Are pedophiles (or categories listed) seeking true love? No, they are looking for victims. Having a sexual relationship with a child is about power and control, not love.  It is about the pedophile  fulfilling their needs, not the child's.
The film does point out some social issues revolving around the media, that are worth noting, but this film is a waist of time.
I have compassion for the pedophile that does not act on their desires, who seeks remediation for their preferences; these people have compassion and are not seeking victims.  Others that seek to defile children are nothing more than a sociopaths who lack empathy.
Furthermore, I do not believe in this films hypothesis that all men are attracted to 16 year old girls is accurate... this is like saying all men are attracted to blonds... get a grip.  Don't justify the pain of others, by saying everyone is doing it... and then end on a jappy note of ""love.""",1421107200,8,1408,4.7073170731707314
