Gene Roddenberry introduces this 48 minute pilot episode and explains that it consists of a combination of color footage dubbed from the two-part TV episode entitled ""The Menagerie,"" plus b&w footage, which he said was all that remained of the original pilot. Perhaps in the quarter-century since, that entire show, which NBC execs REJECTED, has been reconstructed in full color (not sure on that).

Roddenberry's 1964 sales pitch of ""Wagon Train to the Stars"" fell like an anvil on buyers who expected all mindless action and were instead given a fairly cerebral, philosophical initial offering. Fortunately for us, despite NBc's dissatisfaction a second pilot was ordered, but with certain cast changes. Majel Barrett (Mrs. Roddenberry) was sacked as first officer (""Number One""), and replaced by Science Officer Spock (whom Roddenberry refused to part with). Barrett would resurface once the series was safely established, as Nurse Chapel.

Yeoman Rand (the troubled Grace Lee Whitney) took over for Yeoman Colt (Laurel Goodwin). Dr. Boyce (John Hoyt) was relieved by a younger 'Bones' McCoy (DeForrest Kelly) and of course, Capt. Pike's command chair got taken over by James Kirk (Bill Shatner). Other new crew members (soon to be famiiiar faces) were Sulu (George Takei) and Uhura (Nichelle Nichols). Engineer Scott and Ensign Chekov were not yet in this retooled show.

Those familiar with ""The Menagerie"" will note that the Tallosians had more male-sounding voices in the Hunter pilot. With intercutting between b&w and color footage the main alien's voice keeps changing pitch. Also here is something that always confused me in ""The Menagerie.""

In the two-parter, it's revealed to Capt. Pike that the lone crash survivor, Vina is in reality terribly disfigured, which is why she freely chooses to stay with the Tallosians. Pike asks that her beauty be restored, then comes the baffling answer ""She will be given that... and more."" We never see what the ""more"" is. In ""Menagerie,"" quadriplegic Pike is beamed to the surface where, now physically whole, he's reunited with the lovely Vina; they supposedly live happily ever after with the Tallosians. In the original pilot however, ""...and more"" means the aliens create for Vina an illusory Pike and the real captain returns to his ship.

It's a good ending.

Too bad Jeff Hunter didn't stay with the show in some capacity. For one, he probably wouldn't have died from after-effects of a film set explosion. Also, he had an undeniable dignity and was sure handsome as anything!",1422748800,,2751,5.1824324324324325
