2299894,5,B0009MAPX6,"This DVD is worth purchasing just for the Jefferson Airplane performance!  BTW, contrary to the other reviewer's comments, Lester Maddox was the governor of GEORGIA. In 1964 he drove black customers out of his chicken and burger restaurant with pick handles and ultimately closed it down rather than serve them food.  On the particular Cavett show that Maddox was on with Jim Brown, Truman Capote (who grew up in Alabama) said ""You know, I went to his restaurant and I ate there, and I had the chicken. And it wasn't finger-lickin' good"".",1124582400,4,538,4.836956521739131
2299895,5,B0009MAPX6,"I was blown away by Janis (disc 2 of the 3 disc set). I have never had the opportunity to hear her speak or see her play her music. Priceless stuff!! Cavett knows how to interview. His questions, you could tell were well thought out. He knows how to dig deeper. Its a shame he hasn't rubbed off on todays talk show hosts. They could learn alot from this pioneer. Well done!

2299896,3,B0009MAPX6,"Having been a fan of the Cavett show as a kid, I was really looking forward to this set, especially after reading all the glowing reviews. It's definately a great time piece and it's kind of fun seeing what talk shows were like 30-40 years ago. However, what most reviews fail to mention is what a lousy interviewerDick Cavett really was. He's usually awkward and uninformed, his jokes are lame and unfunny and he creates more uncomfortable moments for his guests than any talk show host I've ever seen.",1124323200,9,503,4.662921348314606
2299897,4,B0009MAPX6,"Among the things that made this Cavett Show special was that the technical requirements of video-taping were unobtrusive; cameras were unseen by the participants, the required special lighting didn't distract,and the audio was recorded informally, as part of the conversation. The result is a natural conversation, rather rare in commercial television then -- or now.

As a television professional, I credit the director of the Dick Cavett Show with the skill, and the consumate good taste, to pull it off.

Hendrix was invited, but was passed out in his hotel room (as per David Crosby) since he had performed that AM at Woodstock.  When Joni Mitchell finished singing Chelsea Morning"", Cavett introduced Jefferson Airplane, who performed ""We Can Be Together"" followed immediately by ""Volunteers"".  After some chat (during which Stephen Stills sang ""4 and 20,""  we found out that Grace Slick's father was an investment banker, and that Grace attended Finch College for one year with Tricia Nixon. When asked by Cavett why she somehow had not turned out like Tricia Nixon, Grace said ""it takes two years."" [LOL]) The Airplane concluded the show with ""Somebody to Love"" and went into an extended jam as the credits rolled.  What is needed is the two Airplane songs that were left out.",1122940800,21,925,4.98051948051948
2299899,4,B0009MAPX6,"-- GOOD NEWS:

In the original telecast of the Rolling Stones segment, Cavett interviewed Mick Jagger backstage moments before he was about to perform. The occasion: one of the Stones' famed Madison Square Garden shows on their 1972 US tour. Mick excuses himself to walk onstage, and the cameras follow -- way cool.

Jagger dances out, and the Stones tear into a sledgehammer version of Brown Sugar. It's one of the few times in the band's patchy concert film history cameras manage to perfectly capture the feeling of seeing them live back then. You *are* there -- and it's wonderful.

The original Cavett footage also includes the concert closer, Street Fighting Man. The Stones were on fire this night. They were a year away from what many consider their performing peak, the 1973 European tour. Second guitarist Mick Taylor propelled them to an unprecedented level of intensity.

-- BAD NEWS:

The Stones footage was a late addition to this set, delaying its originally scheduled release date. Previously, permission had been denied by the band. For reasons unknown, Jagger relented at the last minute. But with a caveat -- the DVD could only feature two minutes of each of the Stones' two songs.

-- WHY?

One might guess, concern about bootlegging. But the Rolling Stones would take a paltry financial hit if copies a 32-year old performance of two songs hit the black market. No. The more likely suspect is ego.

Jagger has been scrupulously blocking the release -- on either CD or DVD -- of (additional) Mick Taylor-era live material. Mick admitted years back in a lengthy interview with Rolling Stone publisher Jann Wenner that a lot of people consider the Taylor years the band's finest incarnation. And he sidestepped the question of whether he concurred.

Mick: We understand you don't need a lot of crap about how today's Rolling Stones don't compare to the early '70s. And we appreciate that as their leader, you need to take the feelings of the current line-up into consideration. Really, we do.

But you've been suppressing live Taylor recordings and footage for four decades now -- nearly half a century. How about at long last giving us a break? There's the unreleased Decca live album from 1972. Ladies & Gentlemen on DVD. CS Blues. Film and audio footage from the 1971 UK tour. And the greatest Stones trove of all: superb recordings of your legendary 1973 European tour.

In the meantime, for Stones diehards, this Cavett collection will have to suffice. Let's hope an enthusiastic appreciation of them sends Sir Mick a message he can't ignore -- Let It Loose.",1122163200,198,2581,4.883295194508009
2299900,5,B0009MAPX6,"The Dick Cavett Show aired on ABC at 11:30 pm from 1969-1974 as an alternative to The Tonight Show Staring Johnny Carson. Both shows were 90 minutes then, and while both men were comedians, Cavett having been a writer for Jack Paar, The Dick Cavett Show had less emphasis on humor and more on intelligent conversation. As a result, Cavett was able to secure guests that other talk shows could not. He often devoted the entire show to a single guest. Groucho Marx was once Cavett's only guest for entire week. Marlon Brando, Katherine Hepburn, Fred Astaire, Noel Coward, Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontaine all made appearances on The Dick Cavett Show. Cavett always engaged his guests in conversation, rather than simply interviewing them, or waiting for an opportunity to make a joke as talk show hosts constantly do nowadays. I am hoping that this release will be the first in a long line of excerpts from the Cavett archives. Many great rock stars joined Dick Cavett for a performance and interview. One classic episode featured Crosby, Stills and Nash, The Jefferson Airplane, fresh from Woodstock, sitting on the floor surrounded by young fans and Joni Mitchell. Dick replaced his usual neck tie for a corny neckerchief.  Cavett has recorded new introductions to the segments included on this DVD set, which appears to be a very good beginning of what could be a great series of DVDS.",1118016000,84,1383,4.8354430379746836

Cavett seems uncomfortable with most of the other ""rock icons"" and they clearly don't trust him, but the unusual relationship with Joplin is what makes this DVD set great. Her singing is good but secondary to their onstage relationship.  Clearly they not only respected each other but they actually liked each other.

2299925,5,B0009MAPX6,"I just came to check out this listing after just now watching the Sly interview. Great performance of Mice Elf. Then Sly and Cavett interact in some sort of interview. Sly looks a wee bit high and in a somewhat different place than Cavett, as talk show host. Sly makes some interesting comments about writing songs in front of a mirror. Cavett fumbles around trying make the shift from having just interviewed actress Debbie Reynolds (her interview was great) and tennis champion Poncho Gonzales (a bit stolid) and then right after a VERY nice performance of Thank You, Sly steps off the stage and into the cushioned chairs with Cavett and the previous two guests. It's gotta be a huge transition stepping right out of the magic of a hypnotic rock act and into a chair with Cavett and guests. Cavett's doing his best to find common ground with counter-culture in full regalia. Sly's particular mental frequency at the moment is miles away from where Cavett is at the moment and it's interesting watching them try to find common ground as Sly trips with Cavett on national TV, only to be joined a few minutes later by an Oklahoma senator and his wife - -

Actually the senator and his wife, a Commanche Indian I think, are quite interesting as well, as they discuss the work his wife is doing, and brief mention of the recent invasion Cambodia.

As Dick and the Senator continue off on some vein of conversation, Sly from over on the side mentions that the tennis player (Poncho Gonzales) sitting next to him is also Indian, or part Indian, don't remember. Then asks the senator's wife if she feels she's part of a minority group"", ""Yes, very strongly,"" she replies. ""And is that bad for you in any area?"" Sly continues this time to the senator.

You can see Cavett is really at a loss occasionally as to how to integrate his guests.

""Will you just try and help me?"" he asks Sly
""I am,"" says Sly.

Well, hindsight is 20/20, and looking back at it they should have let Sly have more time at the rap, stoned or not, cause he seemed like he had a lot on his mind and would have been a lot more interesting then just letting the senator squirm as he tries to discuss various forms of racism, and minorities, etc without stepping on anyone's toes. A valiant effort incidentally, though Cavett should've turned it back to Sly rather than putting all the weight on the senator. People were there for Sly anyway and he was indeed ready to talk.

But far from being sad, I found the whole thing very human. A very interesting meeting of minds.. Sly should have been given more time. A missed opportunity. Yes, that was the sad thing.

Day before yesterday I just started this set.  Watched J Airplane and Joni Mitchell, joined by Crosby and Stills the day after Woodstock ended.  Airplane is good but wow Joni knocks it out of the park.  Kudos to Cavett for not breaking down in tears after Joni's performances.  Sheesh.

So, my review is very limited as I have only just watched the first 2 shows on the first disc but I am really happy to have a 3-disc set with the whole shows on each.  Besides giving you the artists that came for just seeing the other guests and the things they're talking about really puts the times into relation to the musicians that developed out of them.  This set is a great history and music history lesson combined.

---------

Finished disc 1 just now after the David Bowie segment. That interview was again another missed opportunity.  Wow, a 1974 Bowie sits down with Cavett after doing a couple tunes from his then new material ""Young Americans"" and another.  Bowie appears to have a minor case of the sniffles.  Well, the Peruvian love dust sniffles it might appear.  He's in a rather sensitive space - then Cavett bursts in with all the power of his intellect.  Are you going to attack me? are you some kind of alien?  How are things between you and Mick Jagger?  How's your relationship with your mother?  Dang, if I was Bowie I'd a been crawling up the walls as well, as Cavett has a particularly bad case of foot in mouth disease on this occasion. Like the Sly interview, another missed opportunity.

Cavett's an amiable man and a decent albeit conventional conversationalist; some kind of link between mainstream media and the raw talent of the underground.  His powers are limited however by his perceived duties toward the conventional - and while I like his basic persona, there were many times on disc 1 when the star guests come on that I wished he could have just stopped talking so much and let the person he was interviewing fill the void which at many points they seemed eager to do - only to be cut off instead, or redirected before they can get their idea in.  Bottom line for disc 1 - a couple of the key interviews could've been better. Though they are still well worth watching just because it is wonderful to actually have ANY footage of these performers from this time.  And interviews aside, their muscial performances are excellent.

Next stop disc 2. It's been a good ride so far.  Very interesting grasshoppah.

Disc 2:  Wow, now here's Cavett in good form.  Disc 2 starts off with a great show and Janis Joplin as the guest.  She and her band are in excellent form as well with a kickin performance of ""Try"" after a cozy chat with DC and an English music critic.  This is the way interviews with rock stars should go!  Also nice on this episode is the pre-Saturday Night Live skits and the ""Symphony of Emotions"" performance. Haha.

Next show has Janis as well, ripping into ""Get It While You Can"", and then just when you thought things couldn't get any better Raquel Welsh appears and they all sit down with DC for a chat.  Janice, Raquel and Dick - it's almost surrreal!  Janice was in the show after this as well, along with Margot Kidder (looking very nice, I might add) and Gloria Swanson.

So this disc 2 is made up of the 3 Janice shows aired between 1969 and 1970.  She's a great guest.  And no one could say Cavett didn't get along with the ladies.  I enjoy the turn of the 70s vibe almost as much as the artists who are on this show.  It's very distinct.",1394150400,2,6116,4.495927601809955

2299927,3,B0009MAPX6,Cavett is an acquired taste. His interviews are thoughtful but his style grates on me. Plus he is so full of himself that he comes off as condensening at best.

2299930,5,B0009MAPX6,"The DICK CAVETT SHOW: ROCK ICONS DVD set is a must have especially for Janis Joplin fans because DVD #2 has her on three shows, along with Raquel Welch, Gloria Swanson, Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. among others.

DVD #1 has the legendary show that was taped the day after Woodstock, which is why Joni Mitchell didn't perform at Woodstock because she didn't want to miss this taping, and also features Jefferson Airplane, Stephen Stills, and David Crosby. It's interesting to watch because at the time no one really knew what a huge and legendary event Woodstock was and would become, and how it would put some performers on the map (like Santana). Cavett does discuss it briefly with the guests who did perform at the festival and you can tell by the look on their faces, and how they described the scene, that they had just experienced something big. Poor Joni, she must have been kicking herself for missing it!

Also on DVD #1 are shows that feature David Bowie and Sly And The Family Stone (on separate episodes). The Sly interview is interesting to watch and he becomes a little combative when the other guests come on because he felt like he was being ignored.

DVD #2 features Janis Joplin on three different episodes. These are great and you really get to see how intelligent Joplin was. At one point, Cavett asks her who her favorite singer is and Janis says that she really likes Tina Turner from ""The Ike & Tina Turner Band"" and Cavett was like, ""Who?"" Too funny! Also interesting was to see Joplin interacting with acting legends Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. and Gloria Swanson (both on different episodes) -- Janis was right at home and, although decked out in bracelets, feathers and beads and things, she never seemed out of place or uncomfortable.

DVD #3 has Steve Wonder on one episode with Allan Delon, Tex Ritter, and the ""Bride Of Frakenstein"" herself, the wonderful Elsa Lanchester. But the stand out for me was the other two episodes -- one featuring George Harrison and Ravi Shankar, and the other that featured Paul Simon. Ex-Beatle and soft-spoken Harrison performs with Gary Wright & WonderWheel, and then joins Cavett to talk a little about his days with the Beatles and why they broke-up (although this is just bare-bones) and his current project at the time, which was a benefit concert for Bangladesh. He makes some cracks about John Lennon and Yoko Ono, all in good fun, and had the audience laughing. Shankar performs and then joins the panel and discusses the influence of Indian music to pop and rock at the time.

The final episode on DVD #3 features Paul Simon, who performs and plays a sample of a song he was currently working on, but the stand out for me comes in the next segment. Cavett wrote his first book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cavett/dp/B0006WHSOI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cavett</a>&nbsp;and becomes a guest on his own show! He gets interviewed by three authors Barbara Howar, Jerzy Kosinski, and writer of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Clockwork-Orange/dp/0393312836/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Clockwork Orange</a>, Anthony Burgess, and it's interesting to hear Dick's take on things.

As with their other releases, ""Shout! Factory"" does a wonderful job with this set! Picture quality is pretty good and there's ""play all"" or ""episode"" selection, and Cavett does present day introductions to each episode. Also included is a booklet with liner notes by the DVD's producer Robert S. Bader, a written introduction by Cavett, and episode information including airdate, guest list, and synopsis.

If all that weren't enough to get you to buy there's two special features:

Sometimes Cavett gets a little tedious but that was his m.o., what he was comfortable with. I remember his interview with the venerable Katherine Hepburn. He came across as a groupie.

2299955,5,B0009MAPX6,"I have spent a lot of time and quite a few bucks hunting down video performances of my fav musical performers from their time of peak creativity..the period covered in these dvds. I should have got this one first.

Here you get Stevie Wonder before he made his superb 70's records..just great!

I'll touch on Paul Simon since other reviewers have covered the other artists in detail.  I play the same style as Paul on guitar and was absolutely dazzled to find a full solo unaccompanied performance of American Tune which shows his chord fingering completely for both the verses and the bridge. Fabulous!

Paul plays his work in progress  Still Crazy after all these Years, for which he has yet to create the bridge (""4 in the morning, crapped out, yawning..."") and again the camera stays on him & the guitar so you can see how it's played.

Jesse Dixon and his group back up Paul later. This is the same Jesse Dixon who shows up on Gaither Gospel video DVDs.

Joni Mitchell was at or near her peak of her first phase and plays unaccompanied as well, one song on guitar and two on piano. She's in superb form and makes some interesting melody choices for her songs...different from those recorded but just as good. The guitar song is Chelsea Morning which provided the Clintons a name for their daughter.

She does 'For Free' on the piano. It is so pure it makes one cry.

Then 'Willie' which she says was written for ""My man"" aka Graham Nash. Nash is not there but Crosby & Stills are. They are just back from Woodstock with mud still on Stills jeans.

I suspect Nash stayed off camera to give his sweetie Joni her time in the national spotlight uninterrupted by requests for CSN songs.

She finishes with 'Fiddle & the Drum' sung acapella. A not so subtle (for her) antiwar ballad.

Previous reviewers have touched on most of what I would have to say about the other performers.

I would have paid well over $100 for all this great stuff. Truly wonderful.

Cavett has many annoying habits. He tends to interrupt a guests flow of thought with banal 'witticisms' and is a pretty lousy listener.

Give him credit, though: The Airplane ends the show with Somebody To Love and then launches into an endless instrumental jam. Cavett lets it go on through several commercial breaks while the audience dances,and doesn't even speak over the music.

Another great plus was the interview with Elsa Lanchester the widow of Charles Laughton. She is quite the raconteur and even Cavetts interruptions don't knock her stories  of her late husband off base. She is best known for portraying the Bride of Frankenstein in the 30's movie.
She & Laughton had a successful marriage for over 30 years, despite him being gay.

  Disc 1: The fist CD is a pretty good one. Jefferson airplane, Joni Mitchell and David Crosby all in the same room. Jefferson Airplane performs in front of a psychedelic background.
  The second show is dedicated complitely to David Bowie. David Bowie gives a fantastic performance, followed by an interview. Then, there's Sly and the family stone, an interview with Dick Cavett and Rolling Stones.
  Second disc is dedicated completely to Janis Joplin. This is definitely my favorite of the three since I'm a huge Joplin fan.
  The first episode, Janis sings ""Try"" and ""To love somebody"". Then there is an interview, followed by a funny bunch of guys by the name of ""The commitee"". At the end is an ""emotion symphony"" which is hilarious.
  Second episode, Janis sings ""Get it while you can"" and ""move over"", and again it's followed by an interview with Joplin and Raquel Welch. This is a great episode.
  The last episode, Janis sings ""Half moon"" and ""My baby"". This was a very entartaining episode with Joplin and Gloria Swanson.

2299960,4,B0009MAPX6,"The dead live on in movies, of course, but film has a glossy, soft, luxurious look that keeps its distance. Videotape has a harder, almost three dimensional quality. It's more real somehow and, when preserved as well as the episodes of ""The Dick Cavett Show"" included in the ""Rock Icons"" set obviously were, every program has the look of a live broadcast. On video, people who are long dead really do appear to be as alive as ever. In this collection, Janis Joplin, in the grave for more than three decades, sings her heart out, legendary newsman Chet Huntley speaks of a retirement that will be cut short by death, and other luminaries, living and dead, are forever frozen in time.

Janis Joplin made a minimum of three appearances on Cavett's show and those episodes are the highlight of this collection. The August 3, 1970 show is memorable primarily because Joplin would be dead a month or two later. An overly glamourous Gloria Swanson stops by, as does Margot Kidder who looks like a teenager. Less memorable is the appearance of a presumably long forgotten football player who plugs a controversial book critical of the game (yawn).

Far more interesting is the June 25, 1970 episode in which Joplin sings ""Get It While You Can,"" Raquel Welch plugs ""Myra Breckinridge,"" tanned, silver-haired Douglas Fairbanks Jr adds a touch of old-style Hollywood glamour, and NBC newscaster Chet Huntley, set to leave his evening news gig with David Brinkley, shamelessly flirts with Raquel and briefly crosses tongues with Joplin.

The discussion of television news in this episode demonstrates how little the times have changed with Huntley denying charges of liberal bias in the media. Raquel, proving she has brains as well as bosoms, speaks of the need to ""compromise"" in an era in which we are so ""polarized."" It's the interaction between these diverse public figures that makes these shows unique and far more intriguing than contemporary talk shows where guests plug their latest product, then disappear behind the curtain when the next guest takes the stage.

If you have more patience with hippie philosophising that I do, you may enjoy the episode with Joni Mitchell, Stephen Stills and others taped only one day after the Woodstock festival concluded, but Paul Simon's 1974 appearance is more interesting. In addition to performing three songs, two of them with the Jesse Dixon Singers, Simon gives Cavett and the viewers an illustrated lesson in songwriting, even offering a preview of a song in progress that would become one of his best loved tunes.

Of equal interest is a 1971 show with George Harrison in which ""the quiet Beatle"" shows he's as quick with a quip as John Lennon. There's also a 1974 appearance by David Bowie who nervously fumbles with a cane, has a bad case of the sniffles (go ahead, raise those eyebrows), and performs two songs. Bowie's backup vocalists at that time included a then unknown Luther Vandross who (I'm guessing) adds his voice to Bowie's renditions of ""1984"" and the yet to be released ""Young Americans."" The big bummer in this set is Sly Stone who is incomprehensible for reasons each viewer can decide for himself.

At the tail end of one broadcast, authors Jerzy Kosinski and Anthony Burgess turn the tables on Cavett by interviewing him upon the publication of his autobiography.

Even those uninterested in rock and roll may find these shows fascinating. Each episode is complete and serves as a time capsule of a long gone era when television, then dismissed as a ""vast wasteland,"" was actually more intelligent and cutting edge than it is now. Cavett, despite later revealing that he was suffering from serious depression during much of his show's run, is always bright and personable, never condescending to his guests even when they come from a field in which his interest was minimal (""Most rock and roll,"" he says in a current interview, ""bores my a** off""). And unlike other hosts who felt intimidated interviewing performers whose popularity may have been mysterifying to anyone nearing or beyond age 40, Cavett never embarrasses himself by feigning a ""hipness"" that he is obviously too smart to think is worth imitating in the first place. These shows have nostalgia to spare, but they somehow seem more contemporary than Leno and Letterman combined. Intelligence, though seemingly no longer in fashion, always triumphs in the long run, and intelligence was Cavett's stock in trade.

2299971,3,B0009MAPX6,I remember watching it when I was younger...I even remember seeing one of his shows in NYC.  What I don't remember is how stilted and uncomfortable he appears in these interviews.  As much as I enjoyed seeing the performers....they could have been better served by someone else doing the interviews.  The David Bowie interview was especially painful to watch.,1156291200,6,359,5.0508474576271185
2299972,4,B0009MAPX6,"The rock highlights of the Dick Cavett Show are very high indeed. The Woodstock show despite Jimi Hendrix being a no-show is a solid and entertaining show. The affable woodstockers seem perfectly comfortable gettin' smarmy with Dick. David Crosby is a natural comedian and he keeps things rollin' along at a variety show pace. Joni Mitchell is at the height of her flower child phase here and she seems like a creature from some other planet that is much greener and more ethereal than our own. Her songs are highlights and absolutely captivate her fellow musicians who seem to be in awe of her beauty and talent. As an interview subject she isn't paricularly captivating but since all of the Woodstockers are sitting in a big circle Joni can hide behind the witty ones. Grace Slick was a society girl who went to ivy-league schools  and Dick has some fun at her expense, but she is good natured and quick witted and doesn't flinch. This whole Woodstock show is laid back and Dick Cavett seems to have just the right attitude to serve as go-between for these grass roots folk rockers and a mainstream, albeit curious, American audience. The show almost seems to be a hippie summit and Dick is like the ambassador general.

The Janis Joplin Shows are deservedly famous. I think Janis will surprise those that don't know her as an intelligent and thoughtful and articulate individual. But you can also see that she loves attention, even craves it, and she often talks over the other guests or interrupts them only to offer her own view of the topic at hand when its not her turn. I don't know that you would call this rude as she seems to just feel like she is at a party and free to chime in when she has something to say. Shes definitely a chatterbox and she enjoys chatting it up with all kinds from every age group and profession. Janis's informality, or laissez-faire attitude toward talk show decorum, is maybe more refreshing than rude.

George Harrison is humorous when he discusses the John and Yoko interview that they did a few weeks previous to his own. Apparently John and Yoko (and that interview is not included in this set) were not shy when it came to peddling John and Yoko merchandise. George, on the other hand, is not a fan of tv. I would describe his attitude as suspicious; generally of tv, and specifically of quick witted tv intellectuals like Dick Cavett. Outside of a few witty jibes at the commercial nature of tv and an obvious annoyance at all of the commercial interruptions he pretty much just wants to talk about Ravi Shankar and Ravi's music. As a guest he's a nightmare for Dick because he just doesn't want to play the amusing talk show guest; a role Lennon seemed all too willing to play. This is George at his most anti-material world-ish.

Stevie Wonder and Paul Simon are excellent on-stage as you would expect and polite conversationalists off-stage. Nothing too riveting about these shows.

The Stones interview was a little disappointing because so short. Mick is the only one willing to talk to Dick and he basically just plays the consummate rock entertainer role. Mick it seems can talk to anyone from debutante to politican. He's in his jumpin' jack flash outift because he's about to play but what is surprising is how staid and gentlemanly he is. He's awfully gentrified for a satanic rocker. But this chat, however brief, is worth a look just because footage of Stones from this period is surprisingly rare. The performance itself is what Stones fans (and I'm one) complain about because the songs are all edited. This was the Stones at the very top of their game (with Mick Taylor on slide guitar) and it is ashame that we can't enjoy the songs in their entirety.

But my favorite bits are Sly Stone and David Bowie.
*The Sly Stone interview is very interesting. The editorial description of Sly states that he is in a drugged out haze. I think that is certainly possible and may explain some of whats going on but Sly's an absolute original and he's just as interesting off-stage as on in any state of mind. This interview has Sly holding his own with the effervescent Cavett. Dick seems to suspect that Sly is stoned but Sly (stoned or not) keeps fielding Dick's questions and answering them in whatever way he sees fit and he even turns the tables on Dick and starts asking Dick questions. Dick seems to think that the audeince shares his suspicions but Sly's comments are interesting. I think people are entertained seeing that Sly thinks for himself. His anectdote about writing in a mirror (because a writer is his own best critic) gets a laugh. And several things he says are very evocative and reveal him to be a very sentient soul. The whole thing is entertaining. For me this was the most interesting of the interviews because it revealed that there was more than just a generation gap (Dick and Sly were not that far apart in years) dividing these two; there was a gap in understanding and communication that existed between various segments of American society and the interview seems to be a nice illustration of that. Dick is pretty hip but he just doesn't exist on Sly's frequency and Sly doesn't exist on Dick's; the best they can do is have fun making fun of the misfires between them.

For rockers of the early seventies tv was an unusual format. And many of these decidedly non-mainstream musicians were used to being onstage but before audiences with similar sensibilites as their own and not to talk but to do their thing, play. They were not used to sitting down with famous talk show hosts in front of mainstream America and being asked to give an account of themselves to the general public, or at least to Dick Cavett's ""public"" which would be a cultured crowd but cultured in a different way than the musicians. Many of the musicians are visibly uncomfortable sitting next to the charismatic and intellectual talk show host. After singing ""Young Americans"" a wafer-thin and chalk-white David Bowie sits down w/ cane in hand and precedes to draw imaginary holes in the carpet with the cane that it appears he would like to crawl in to. This is a very shy Bowie. Many fans were used to seeing the very confident Ziggy Stardust but that was just a stage persona and this Bowie is more like the cracked actor that he sang about on Aladdin Sane. The skittish (""insecure actor"" I believe is how Dick describes him) Bowie seems to surprise Dick and audience alike; there is laughter but its an uncomfortable laughter coming from Dick, Bowie and audience. Most of Dick's questions annoy Bowie and he answers only those he wants to answer and even when he does answer a question his answers are vague and enigmatic. Bowie is obviously a very creative art guy and the one thing that does turn him on is when he starts talking about WS Burroughs and white noise. But this avant-garde talk is not what Cavett is looking for. Cavett wants Bowie to discuss his ""vampire-like"" appearance and his public reputation as an outrageous performer who creates characters to sing his songs. This is a topic that the singer-performer wants no part of. It would seem that as Bowie sheds personas he also loses interest in them and the Bowie that shows up on Dick Cavett's set is no longer really interested in creating characters nor in talking about them. Cavett, who is usually pretty good at finding a neutral wavelength, does not quite connect with Bowie (just like he did not quite connect with Sly) on any level and Bowie just keeps withdrawing further and further away as a result. This might not be Dicks fault though as many of Bowie's songs are about cracked actors and social misfits. And Bowie would write an entire album about psychotic withdrawal in 1976 called LOW. It would have been nice to see someone more knowledgable about music than Dick try and talk to Sly and Bowie but its still interesting to see Sly and Bowie be themselves even if the interviews themselves didn't go so well.

My only complaint is that you do have to sit through a lot of chats with old Hollywood stars and some politicians and sports figures to get to the rock segments but, in a way, seeing these shows in their entirety allows us to place the music in a wider context and seeing the rockers chat with people from different professions than their own does provide some interesting cultural interchanges.",1154304000,17,8350,4.656271186440678

The Sly Stone interview is funny and sad at the same time. Fresh performance.

The Bowie interview intriguing. Check out the late Luther Vandross singing backup in his leisure suit.

In contrast to the wit he seemed when I was a kid, he now seems like a witless dolt. His jokes are not funny, his questions not perceptive, and he constantly steps all over his guests' attempts to utter pointless gibberish. The DVD notes make a fool out of Sly Stone, and I expected the worst, but compared to the rest of the numbskulls, and to Cavett himself, Sly comes off rather sensibly. It's hardly necessary to ridicule Sly for drug use when Cavett has raved about the wonderful effects of his own electroshock treatments.

2299979,3,B0009MAPX6,"This collection of performances and interviews by Jefferson Airplane, Janis Joplin, David Bowie, Sly Stone, Steven Stills, etc., shows what inarticulate, mumbling, stoned out, disorganized thinking fools these men and women are when they are not behind a guitar or piano. Janis comes off the best - the drugs had not fried her brains yet and she actually has a personality and can string a few words together into a complex sentence. Sly Stone's speech is incoherent and his thinking patterns resemble a schizophrenic - nothing he says makes any sense - of course, he thinks he is profound, what stoner doesn't? David Bowie comes off the worst. First of all, he looks like he is starving. With his dayglow orange hair, bad teeth, sunken cheeks and dried, listless eyes, he looks like a cadaver cooling down for the autopsy. He throws out fragments of sentences, barely respond to anything Cavett says, giggles at his private jokes, fumbles endlessly with an irrelevant cane, seems to be an effeminate vampire fumbling for words and thoughts before his next pint of blood. His interview is total, unmitigated nonsense given by a creepy nutjob. The Jefferson Airplane/Steve Stills and David Crosby/Woodstock show is an embarassing look at how naive all these hippies were. They really thought they were going to save the world from the sins of the older generation. Instead, they ended up burnout cases or greedier and more ruthless than their decent WW II parents ever were. At least their parent's generation had Christian morals to rein in their excesses - or, at least, make them feel guilty when they trespassed. These guys and girls were on a one track road to self-indulgent thinking and living. David Crosby comes off as a halfwitted stoner philosophizing about life with a fourth grade vocabulary. The performances? Janis delivers. Bowie screws up the vocals on ""Young Americans."" Jefferson Airplane ruins their set with bad amplification (although they managed to slip in the vulgarism on network tv when they do ""Volunteers""). Joni Mitchell does a good job. The rest give sub-standard performances. This dvd set is interesting - but not for the reasons Dick Cavett might have thought.

2300002,4,B0009MAPX6,"I agree with much of what other reviewers have already said. In a nutshell: (1) valuable and fascinating footage of performers you probably haven't seen anywhere before; and (2) if you're expecting a DVD of back-to-back performances/interviews with rock/pop stars you'll be disappointed--what you get is full-length 90-minute Dick Cavett shows including his pretty lame monologues (which are not at all political, even during those politically charged years, which--to me--would have been more interesting than his corny, apolitical, dated jokes), as well as lengthy, often awkward interviews with people like Pancho Gonzales (tennis player?) and Debbie Reynolds--but if those don't interest you, that's why fast-forward was invented.

The opening segment of disc 1 is of Jefferson Airplane, Joni Mitchell, and Stephen Stills (also David Crosby joins Jefferson Airplane on a wildly struck tamborine). What was interesting to me was this: Dick Cavett is so uncomfortable with these hipster hippies, he's a total ""square,"" and yet he deserves credit for being brave enough for being himself and trying to set up a ""rap session"" for the performers, who have to sit in a circle on these Day-Glo cushion cubes. At one point he says politely to Grace Slick (of Jeff Airplane): ""Are you comfortable?"" and she sort of sneers back, ""No."" Most of the other performers are sprawled on the floor using the cushions as pillows--they're clearly unimpressed (or trying to give that impression) of being on Dick Cavett, and they're also dead tired and wired from having just been at Woodstock. Joni Mitchell listens raptly to them all talk about the experience at Woodstock. Her handlers had convinced her to blow off going to Woodstock to make the Dick Cavett appearance. Maybe if she'd played Woodstock she would have been able to make it to Cavett, or maybe not. Jimi Hendrix was supposed to be among those present but was, as Cavett suggested, ""zonked out in a hotel room,"" sleeping it off. In any case, Joni Mitchell is said to have written the song ""Woodstock"" directly after the Cavett show. At one point Joni Mitchell is asked to play a couple more songs. Her voice is incomparable, so clear and youthful and filled with emotion. And it's interesting watching Jefferson Airplane et al. sitting there watching/listening to her. You see Stephen Stills and Jorma (from the Airplane) watching her guitar, and really digging what she is playing. Paul Kantner (who seems like kind of a dick throughout the rap session/interview) leans over to Jack Cassady during one of Joni's songs and says something snide and they both snicker. Joni's, Stephen Stills' and the Jefferson Airplane's preformances are entrancing. And it's astounding that the censors didn't bleep the Airplane during ""We Can Be Together"" when they sing ""Up against the wall motherf$%^er!"" This segment ends with Jefferson Airplane doing an extended jam, with the audience dancing away. If you look closely you'll even see Joni Mitchell, in her long green hippie dress, grooving away with one of the fans in the audience!

I won't go on about Janis Joplin too much because that's covered at length in other reviews, but like others I'd never seen her except for little snippets here and there. You really get a sense of who she was--a unique human being and *enormously* talented! There are times that are rather uncomfortable--Janis won't sit still and listen to the others interviewed--she barges in and asks questions and argues with them. However, it's rivetting, and she usually does have something unique, provocative, and insightful to say. She and Raquel Welch are on the opposite side of several debates, and it would be difficult to argue with belligerent Janis Joplin, but Raquel Welch succeeds. I'd thought R. Welch would be a silicone bubblehead, but she's smart and articulate and funny.

David Bowie is at the height of a very queeny phase, which is compelling to see, and he belts out ""1984"" and ""Young Americans"" with gusto, and in full voice--he's fey and beauteous and eyelash-batty in the interview, and unfortunately Cavett was not tremendously adept in bringing him out (so to speak :)

Sly and the Family Stone were awesome! Musically fantastic, and the definition of funky. Sly is one of the most charasmatic humans I've ever seen. He was definitely $%^&ed up on something, but he was connecting with Dick Cavett in a very human way, which made Cavett a bit antsy...Sly has his own script and manner of expressing himself, and would say things with a big hazy smile, like ""I like you, man. I can tell you're a good person."" To which Cavett would respond, eyes darting back and forth, hands fidgetting, ""Oh, well, er, thank you, and you too!""

Paul Simon does a heart-rending rendition of ""An American Tune"" (the song on my mind during those days after 911). He also discusses his approach to songwriting--and as he spoke with Cavett he grabbed his guitar and played what he'd worked out so far for ""Still Crazy After All These Years,"" deconstructing the options for where the song could go next musically, and why. Again, Cavett is pretty awkward and doesn't really let Paul Simon finish his explanation (which I found captivating), and Cavett inserts feeble jokes, and makes irrelevant comments. Simon also posits and expounds on his theory that there are no genius musicians/songwriters in his generation--this unexpectedly spoken by a notorious egotist who has since tagged himself as a genius. Also featured are ""Love Me Like a Rock"" and ""Bridge Over Troubled Waters"" with a gospel choir.

All the above are great. As is George Harrison's interview. At one point when discussing the complexities of how to handle the money collected from his charity concert for Bangladesh (the first-ever rock charity event), he says: ""We were going to give [the proceeds] to the American Red Cross, who in turn could give it to the Indian Red Cross, but then we heard so many different stories about the Red Cross...and how these...hurricances hit someplace in America and they just take care of the whites, and all the blacks are there, and they're not taking care of them. You hear so many different stories about that..."" Cavett looks as uncomfortable as Mike Meyers did when Kanye West made his recent pronouncement, and blurts: ""I hadn't heard that."" After the commercial break, Cavett re-interprets what Harrison said about the Red Cross and explains to the audience that George meant one must be careful about *any* charitable organization one is going to donate to, ""and not just the Red Cross."" George is sort of looking into the middle distance, and Cavett says, ""RIGHT, George?"" and Harrison says, ""Uh, yeah, right."" That's just one of the *very* many interesting moments with George Harrison.

I've gone on long enough, but that doesn't cover the half of it. I got tired of the long interviews with people I hadn't planned to listen to--but again, that's what the fast-forward button is for.

2300006,5,B0009MAPX6,"We had to wait a 1/3 of a century to get it, but the ""The Dick Cavett Show - Rock Icons"" 3 DVD set was worth the wait and is incredible.  If you are a Jefferson Airplane and/or Janis Joplin fan, or would like to learn about these two revolutionary bands/artists, along with other artists of the period, buy this 3 DVD set immediately without hesitation.  The quality of the three DVD's is A+, particularly considering the original tapes of the show are over 1/3 of a century old.

The undisputed crown jewel of this DVD set, or should I say the ""Crown Pearl"", is the entire second DVD effectively dedicated to legendary Janis Joplin's appearances on three, of four, Dick Cavett shows, including August 1970 two months before her untimely death on October 4, 1970. Janis Joplin's performances on the second DVD are:

Janis Joplin - Kozmic Blues Band:

..July 18, 1969 - ""To Love Somebody""/""Try (Just A Little Bit Harder)""

Janis Joplin - Full Tilt Boogie Band:

..June 25, 1970 - ""Move Over""/""Get It While You Can""

..August 3, 1970 - ""Half Moon""/""My Baby""

Not only does Janis perform all these great songs, Cavett interviews her on all three shows and Janis is on the set for the rest of the shows interacting with the other guests throughout the program. Cavett always had Janis perform at the top of his program after his monologue, and she was the first guest to be interviewed. Janis is funny, engaging, sincere, and of course, pure Janis. I saw Janis in concert in 1969 & 1970 (Jefferson Airplane '69/'70) and wouldn't trade the experience for the anything in the world.  I also saw Jimi Hendrix in concert in 1970, and Janis actually put on a better show.

All Janis's Dick Cavett performances and interviews are fantastic, but the second Dick Cavett show Janis appeared on, June 25, 1970, is nothing short of incredible. Janis and her awesome Full Tilt Boogie Band blow the roof off the place with her opening number Move Over. Then Janis has the crowd hanging on her every word, and dying laughing at times, in her interview with Dick after she performs Move Over. Of the three shows, this was Janis's best interview. As always, Janis had her ""heart on her sleeve"" and speaks without pretense. Janis always blew me away because she was so real as a person, intelligent, and never tried to pretend to be someone she was not.  With Janis she put it all on the table - take it or leave it.

Dick's next guest was the very hot and sexy Raquel Welch. Cavett had the ultimate guy's dream - a decked out ""Rock Goddess"" sitting on his left and a decked out ""Sex Goddess"" sitting on his right. I would have sold my soul to the Devil in a heartbeat to be sitting in Cavett's chair that night. Throughout the rest of the show there is some great interchange between Welch and Joplin, and Janis had some great ""one liners"". You could tell the two had much admiration for each other despite their lives being very different. I developed a whole new respect for Raquel Welch after watching this interview. She was very good to Janis and very articulate throughout her interview.

In addition to DVD-2 of Janis, in the Bonus Material on DVD-1, entitled ""The Dick Cavett Interview"", Dick talks extensively about Janis in the interview. Cavett acts somewhat like he has Alzheimer's Disease in the interview, but the interview is still very good. Cavett is quite personal about he and Janis with a great ""out on the town together"" story. Unfortunately, there is much that went on between Dick and Janis that he cannot say in public, since he is married to the same women since 1964. But it doesn't take a rocket scientist to read between the lines, if you have not previously read or heard the stories.

The Dick Cavett Janis Joplin ""tribute"" DVD-2 is very special for a number of reasons. First, despite Joplin being one of the greatest, if not the greatest, rock/blues-rock females in history, there is very little ""official"" live videos available of her since she walk on to her next life 35 years ago. This new Joplin-Cavett DVD has been greatly needed for many years. Janis wasn't a prolific song writer like Jimi Hendrix, but she was an incredible stage performer like Jimi. Like Hendrix, Joplin took her music a whole different direction and became a very rare legend. The next white blues/blues rock genius that took this rarely traveled road was the legendary Stevie Ray Vaughan.

Second, Dick Cavett has said publicly, several times, that he really liked Janis because she was so unique and real. There was much speculation while Janis was alive that Cavett even loved her, despite being married. The way Janis always wore her heart on her sleeve, along with her beautiful smile and infectious laugh, it would not surprise me if this speculation was true. Clearly Cavett was infatuated with both Grace Slick of the Jefferson Airplane and Janis Joplin. But it was Janis that Cavett heavily showcased on his show.  Janis was on the program four times. The tape of Janis's 1968 appearance unfortunately got reused and recorded over.

Cavett greatly helped get Janis the exposure she needed to showcase her incredible talent and personality, both on and off the stage.  I was always impression that Cavett knew that most of the public totally misunderstood Janis, and Dick went out of his way during his interviews with her, to show the world how real and enlightening she was. It's no accident that this Joplin-Cavett DVD was released on the 35th anniversary of Janis's tragic passing. Cavett spoke publicly on television about Janis on the 30th anniversary of her passing in 2000.

Further, Dick Cavett did more for Janis's career than any other entertainer/media person. However, he also greatly worried about her alcohol/drug addiction spirally out of control again in 1970, which he talked about publicly in 2000, and briefly addressed in DVD-1, ""The Dick Cavett Interview. What Cavett stated spoke volumes about both he and Janis as real and caring people. It also once again showed Janis's deep insecurities and how she felt like no one really cared about her. Unfortunately, this situation is amazingly common in many of the greatest entertainers the world has known.

Third, Janis's last public media appearance was on the August 3, 1970 Dick Cavett Show.  Finally, the Janis Joplin-Cavett DVD is very important, because it's an incredible showcase of Janis and who she really was as a person. The only other video that you can learn about who Janis was as both an entertainer and as a person is the 96 minute VHS ""Janis, The Way She Was"" (1974). This also is an incredible video, but unfortunately, this video is out of print and expensive to purchase a good quality copy from collectors. (1 - See Below)

There has been so much misrepresentation and total garbage as to who Janis was as a person over the last 1/3 of a century, by people that didn't know her or understand Janis's incredible contributions to this world. In this Dick Cavett Shows - Rock Icons DVD you can see Janis perform six incredible songs and listen to her speak in candid and open conversation during her 3 hours on Dick's shows. Yes, you will also see some of Janis's significant insecurities pop out and, at times, the effects of her unfortunate alcohol and drug abuse.

For example, when Janis performed her second song ""Get It While You Can"" on Cavett's June 25, 1970 show, she appears to get painful peripheral shakes during the song and acted like she was ""crashing/coming down"". Like many people, Janis insecurities and huge heart drove the majority of her alcohol and drug abuse problems. The legendary Grace Slick of the Jefferson Airplane, and a good friend, stated Janis best. ""Janis knew more than I did about ""how it was"", but she lacked enough armor for the inevitable hassles. She was open and spontaneous enough to get her heart trampled with a regularity that took me thirty years to experience or understand.""

It was no accident that Janis Joplin was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame the same year as two of the greatest legends in the music industry, Led Zeppelin and the music genius Frank Zappa (RIP). Janis also was awarded a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award the same year as Led Zeppelin. These special awards are presented to artists that have made creative contributions of outstanding significance to the field of recording. There are a number of great bands/rock artists in the world, that have sold well over 100 times the number of albums as Janis, that have not achieved her level of peer noted distinction.

(1)  ""Janis, The Way She Was"" (1974) - This incredible 96 minutes video is being shown on the Sundance Channel cable network in the month of September 2005 as part of the 35th anniversary of Janis's untimely passing. It has been converted from the original ""pan and scan"" format to widescreen format. Check the Sundance Channel's website for listed viewing dates and times.

If you are a Janis Joplin fan you need to purchase the incredible DVD ""Fly Jefferson Airplane"", that was released September 2004, if you have not seen it.  The Jefferson Airplane's founder Marty Balin and Janis were very close, along with Airplane's infamous front-person Grace Slick. In fact, in 1966 the Jefferson Airplane looked at trying to hire Janis Joplin to front the band. They decided on Grace Slick instead because Janis was already doing well with her band, and they thought Grace would fit JA's direction better. Grace and Janis emerged as the two ruling Queens of the infamous San Francisco Haight-Asbury rock movement. The Monterey International Pop Festival in June 1967, put both the JAirplane and Janis-Big Brother on the National rock scene map. The two bands also played together frequently at San Francisco's infamous ""The Fillmore"" and ""Avalon Ballroom"". Over the next 3 years Grace and Janis ruled their concert stages and nobody messed with them or their fans, which included the police and the FBI, with their secret files on both bands/artists.

Janis Joplin Quotes:

Don't compromise yourself. You're all you've got.

On stage I make love to twenty five thousand people; and then I go home alone.",1126742400,17,10147,4.789925586720091
2300007,4,B0009MAPX6,"The title of this collection is a little misleading.  ""THE DICK CAVETT SHOW Featuring POP MUSIC ICONS"" is a bit more accurate, because what is seen here are nine complete -- whenever possible -- Dick Cavett shows from 1969-1974.  In retrospect, from the evidence here Cavett was a viable, witty, and intermittently provocative alternative to late-night king Johnny Carson.  If you are expecting wall-to-wall rock music, you'll be disappointed.  However, if you want to get a snapshot of pop culture in the immediate post-Woodstock era, Cavett was unusually adept at reaching out to the younger generation, and doing so in a manner that avoided the condescending attitudes of others in the entertainment world.  For one, could anyone doubt that Dick was enamored of Janis Joplin's talent and personality after viewing the three shows seen here?

Never mind the music (for a moment), if you are a fan of comtemporary shows such as the now defunct Bill Maher program POLITICALLY INCORRECT, you might want to check out this DVD.  Sure, there are some segments on Cavett's show that fall flat (but the same was true of Carson's and Maher's shows).  Yet there are plenty of moments here where the celebrity banter is as fascinating as it was on the better P.I. broadcasts.  At one point, you have Joplin, Cavett, and legendary actress Gloria Swanson engaged in a very interesting conversation.  Another b'cast has Janis, Raquel Welch (promoting MYRA BRECKENRIDGE), retiring tv news anchor legend Chet Huntley (obviously a Raquel fan), and esteemed actor Douglas Fairbanks Jr. in a riveting conversation covering areas as diverse as how fair and balanced the news media was circa 1970 (how timely is THAT?).  Some very wise responses to that topic by Huntley.  Much has been made of the Sly Stone broadcast; even the liner notes call the interview ""unfortunate.""  I call it great tv.  Regardless of whether or not Sly was indeed stoned -- a question that could arguably be asked of half the guests on this collection, and not just the pop stars -- the interview is revealing, and Sly seems generally coherent, humorous and intelligible to me.  Irreverent?  Certainly.  More playful than discourteous, Sly doesn't let Cavett get away with several casual asides to the audience, and Dick finds himself in the hot seat more than once.

Several other shows do focus on particular music stars or events.  Although I'm not a Jefferson Airplane fan, they turn in strong performances on the Woodstock show, and Joni Mitchell is also seen and heard to great advantage.  It's amazing that Cavett let both guests perform 3-4 tunes each (unlike most of today's talk shows where it's one song and you're out).  George Harrison slowly opens up in his extended interview segment.  Note that he only performs as a guest guitarist with Gary Wright and via a film clip from BANGLADESH.  Stevie Wonder is the highlight of an otherwise forgettable show from 1970, David Bowie performs and is extensively interviewed from 1974 (yes, that is a young Luther Vandross and David Sanborn in his backing band).  Paul Simon is also impressive on a show that is largely devoted to several notable authors interviewing Cavett about his then recently-released autiobiography (which I found okay to watch once but won't likely go back to a second time).  The 1972 Rolling Stones segment is disappointing for reasons other reviewers have brought up (in a word: incompleteness).

I'd say that the highlights of the DVD set are the three Janis Joplin appearances on disc two.  Besides what i've already mentioned about the shows, Janis is absolutely amazing as a live artist.  The sterile television studio doesn't hinder her at all from turning in six dynamic vocal performances, including a total of four tunes from the PEARL album (which wasn't released until posthumously the following year).  She does seem a little shaky on her feet at times on the last show, but whether or not those looks are what they seem, she still sounds awesome.  Overall, I'd say that if you're only buying this DVD set for the rock, pop, and soul artists, you may be a little disappointed.  However, if you are interested in the bigger picture (i.e., some often highly watchable chats in-between the music performances), then I'd say you're likely to find well over half of this nearly 10-hour-long set to be worth repeat viewings in your DVD player.",1126396800,18,4390,4.964432284541724
2300008,5,B0009MAPX6,"I agree with all about the limitations of this set. That being said. Get this box for 1 reason and one reason only. Janis. Novices and hardcores will be on Ebay searching for every Janis morsel you can find after viewing this stuff and refreshing on the importance of the performer and these performances. Not what I bought this box for, but the reason I'm glad I did! Mike",1126396800,9,373,4.420289855072464
2300009,4,B0009MAPX6,"Excellent music (especially by Janis Joplin, Stevie Wonder, Sly and the Family Stone, David Bowie, Paul Simon) and solid, serious-for-TV inteviews (good to see the Jagger interview in non-bootleg form, even if the songs are unfortunately cut short).

What's also great is that most of the shows are presented almost in their entirity -- which means that you can see some great musical acts but you can watch the other guests that were on the episode (for example Debbie Reynolds, Douglas Fairbanks, Raquel Welch), which really puts things in an interesting historical context.  This is a well-presented look at a talk show that seems truly innovative 30-35 years later.

Nice ironic, slightly surreal moment: There's an episode in which Cavett, having written an autobiography, allows himself to be interviewed by authors Jerzy Kozinski (""Being There"") and Anthony Burgess (creator of ""A Clockwork Orange,"" who's clad in yellow socks and a green blazer and smoking a very nasty-looking little cigar).

Both Burgess and Kozinski praise Cavett for being brave enough to shift from hosting a TV show (which, they both agree, is temporary; in an age before TiVo and VCR's they see a TV show as something that's here and then gone) whereas to write a book is to create a permanent document.  Both writers have long since left this zone but it's amusing and a little amazing to see them talking about the temporal nature of television... three decades after the fact.",1125100800,11,1461,5.020661157024794
2300010,3,B0009MAPX6,"As a big Stones fan, I hadn't seen the Jagger interview backstage since it was originally aired. Nice blast from the past, but I was disappointed that only small clips from their live show were on there.

As a Janis Joplin fan, the shows with her as a guest were outstanding, from earlier in her career to being quietly talkative, excited about her music, and seemingly very sweet overall - to near the tragic end of her career when she is obviously no longer just high from the music and performing.  Her interactions with Raquel Welch and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. are entertaining (""You knew the Fizgeralds?!"" to DF), to the quietness of her attentiveness to Gloria Swanson's assertion that she had invented the first panty girdle.  Of note is a quick shot of Janis, heavy-lidded and seemingly trying to keep awake during an interview with another guest.  Apparently she liked being on the Cavett show (he asserts) and it shows in the first of her appearances.  I did not see these when first aired, and these segments were truly a treat for me.

I recall recently seeing a Cavett interview with Jimi Hendrix after Woodstock.  Why was it not included here?",1124668800,12,1155,4.7164179104477615
