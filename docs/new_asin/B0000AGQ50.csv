7997086,3,B0000AGQ50,"Seller was prompt. Material arrived when predicted. Material was in excellent shape as advertised. Material was as adveristed, good olde kung-fu movies. I am not a movie expert, except in what I like. I just enjoy kung-fu movies as a great mental break from humdrum.  I especially enjoy these period pieces.  Specifically, there was not much effort in copying these movies.  You probably have to be real fan of genre to get by lacking quality.  I am.  These are fun movies.",1314489600,2,473,4.790123456790123
7997087,1,B0000AGQ50,"Do not waste your money on this one! I've seen hundreds of Kung Fu movies from the seventies to the present and these are three of worst! The story line, the acting (which are, I know, as a rule not that great anyway), the cinematography and especially the action are all pitifull at best. As for the humor segments, what's with the grown men pee-ing their pants? For that matter, does anyone find people with diahrea all that amusing? Carter Wong has been in ONE good movie (Big trouble in little China)but what was John liu ( usually a great action star) doing in this puke-fest? I only give this one star because I have to....HORRIBLE!",1314403200,2,638,4.508620689655173
7997088,4,B0000AGQ50,"this is a three dvd set of three kung fu movies! Adventure for Imperial Treasure, Fatal Flying Guillotine and Instant Kung Fu Man! Imperial Treasure is actually called something else! I forgot what it was! Anyways, the dvd product is questionable! Everytime the next chapter will come, the movie will freeze for a split second then progress on! That is the only complaint I have with this product! Maybe it's not like that on other DVD players but it is on mine! I have a Samsung! But I still think these movies are worth getting becuz they are some of the best kung fu films I 've ever seen! The freezing thing is really no big deal becuz it's just like 1/4 of a second long! Other than the freezing crap, the dvd's play fine!",1107734400,4,727,4.392592592592592
7997089,4,B0000AGQ50,"This Collection contains three movies

The first ""Adventure for Imperial Treasures"" stars Wang Tao

as Lee Shou Ching the son of an architect Lee Lin who in turn is the last person still alive with the knowledge of the wherabouts

of a huge treasure. Years earlier Lee Lin escaped death at the

hands of an evil master named Feng Kei. Feng Kei and his men

eventually find and kill Lee Lin though - which sends Lee Shou

Ching on a mission of revenge - First learning beggar fist from

a helpful beggar then learning secret kung fu techniques from a

monk all the while looking for his lost sister and knowing that

a showdown with Feng Kei is inevitable. very good 4 star movie

In my opinion.

The second movie is ""Fatal Flying Guillotines"" starring Chen Sing

and Carter Wong. Chen Sing plays a kung fu expert Wu who has

mastered the Guillotines - he became ill when young and had to

abandon his wife and son. He becomes sort of an evil recluse in

a vaporous valley - while being courted to work for an evil

prince and being hunted down by monks. Carter Wong plays his

son- who was never told his fathers name and goes into action

against the old man after being given a false cure for his mother

(which results in her death). A solid movie but I did not enjoy

as much as the other two. A solid 3-4 star movie in my opinion.

Movie 3 is ""Instant Kung Fu Man"" starring Hwang Jang Lee and John Liu among others. This movie is a tale of two brothers

twins Hsiao Fu(a somewhat evil kung fu master and criminal) and

his bumbling but intelligent brother Hsiao Hu (knows very little

kung fu and is the opposite of his brother) Hsiao Fu sends his

brother Hsiao Hu to the Shaolin temple to learn kung fu.

Hsiao Hu after three years has not learned anything so he tricks

the monks into letting him leave - the monks discover his trickery and send a top monk John Liu to bring him back.

Hsiao Hu gets into all kinds of trouble and has to constantly

pose as his brother - which in turn gets his brothers enemy

played by Hwang Jang Lee on his trail and leads to an eventual

showdown. a Very Good 4-5 star movie in my opinion. I especially

enjoyed the fight scenes which pitted John Liu against Hwang

Jang Lee(two of the best leg fighters in Kung Fu Movie history).

Overall a very good three movie set and much better than the

vol. 2 collection of the same name.",1101513600,5,2373,4.268018018018018
