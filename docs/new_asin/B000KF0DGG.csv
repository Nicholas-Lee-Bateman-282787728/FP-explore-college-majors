2688876,5,B000KF0DGG,"U.F.C 7

Ultimate Fighting rarely surpases it's early days and this fight card is absolutely no exception with the event introducing both new competitors and old favourites. Like all U.F.C cards there are some memorable moments and contests that shock as much then as they do now.

The highly action packed event features the return of the massive Paul Varelans of previous U.F.C competition and Harold Howard whom had been a popular fan favourite.

Big names inlude Ken Shamrock and Olec Taktarov who engage in a classic Superfight match, and the introduction of Marco Ruas the Brazilian Martial Artist who is now a familar name with a loyal following.

The special features of U.F.C Classics number 7  are in line with the usual calibre of previous ""Classics"" titles as the disc features rare and recent interviews with the fighters themselves, Marco Ruas and Oleg Taktarov.

A very welcome addition to any U.F.C collection, highly recommended.",1171756800,,946,5.070967741935484
2688877,4,B000KF0DGG,"The Brawl in Buffalo was a little lacking. It had The Super Fight between defending UFC Champion Oleg Taktarov and defending Super Fight Champion Ken Shamrock.

First off the Super Fight is extremely long and very disappointing. Mainly in part that you could tell that Taktarov did not want to fight Shamrock. Plus with very limited action, aside from ground techniques and ""the guard"", there is really very little else to this match. It was a very hyped up match that totally bombed out.

This one did however see the return of UFC 2 fighter Remco Pardoel and UFC 3 finalist (and resident UFC Redneck) Harold Howard and the return of UFC 6 fighter Paul Varelans. The action was a bit slow and in some parts, it really dragged. I'll give it that this UFC had the difficult task of following UFC 6 but having more aggressive fighters in the main draw would've helped.

The match between Ruas and Varelans.  Ruas had a great strategy and turned a UFC fight that could've gone to the ground into a Sabaki fight where he had a better chance against a bigger and slower opponent.

Ruas used strategy instead of trying to go ape on his opponent and he just took his time. Special commentator Don ""The Dragon"" Wilson made the comment of ""I don't see why Varelans is taking all this punishment on the leg and quadricep. All he has to do is lift up his leg and take the kick on the shin where he can take more damage."" This happens all the time in Sabaki fights. Most times, kicks above the waist are rare and kicks to the leg and quads are more preferable in an attempt to bring your opponent down piece by piece. That and it's easier to kick the leg than it is to kick at the body or face.",1166918400,3,1682,4.361022364217252

8156055,4,B000KF0DGG,"UFC was a good show and one to add to your collection. both Marco Ruas  and  Paul Varelans show a lot of what they could do and were impressive....

The Super fight between  Ken Shamrock vs. Oleg Taktarov  was like the Shamrock/Gracie fight long and slow..with the ref pulling them apart about 3 or 4 times during the 33 minutes to restart and conitnue.  those long 30 minute matches  with both of them locked in holds  and not doing much...Was not something I enjoyed..

Any Fan of UFC should add this one to their collection  if  for any reason then Nostalgia.",1249603200,,562,4.465346534653466
8156056,4,B000KF0DGG,"UFC 7 is a great event to get for any classic UFC fan. Its a standard 8 man tournament with a superfight. You get to see the Marco Ruas come out and live up to the hype. The superfight is a good tactical match, even though it runs the entire allotted time there are some high points but oleg makes the fight a drag only trying to finish the fight on like two occasions with some punching. Ken seems to want it a little more throwing a couple haymakers and some solid head butts.  Anyone looking for a good classic UFC, Youve found one.",1209254400,,535,4.144230769230769
