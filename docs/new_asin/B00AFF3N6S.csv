All that disappears when you lay on it .  How much do I like it?  I bought four more out of fear they might discontinue it.  I have bought really expensive pillows in the past only to find out that that price doesn't guarantee comfort.",1357171200,14,402,3.888888888888889

Right now, I'm very comfortable from head to toe, memory form pillow and 5"" memory form mattress topper, both Serta brand. I highly recommend this pillow.",1356307200,10,332,4.370967741935484

5423451,5,B00AFF3N6S,This is the best pillow I have. I have many pillows that I have tried over the yearsand have paid more for that are sitting in my closet collecting dust. I have had 3 surgeries in my neck and suffer from chronic pain. it is worth every penny. It may take you a couple of days to get used to if you have chronic pain like me.,1414800000,2,324,3.8507462686567164

5423454,5,B00AFF3N6S,"I prefer my mattresses and pillows on the firm side, so if that's your deal too then this pillow is for you. I bought one for myself and one for my boyfriend, who thought the gel would be much softer, so he was dissatisfied with it: I can't emphasize enough that this pillow definitely has some give to it and it supports my neck much better than the average WalMart pillow, but it IS NOT a ""soft"" pillow by any means! All that means to me is that now I have two pillows and he has one, which is a-okay in my book! The Queen size is large enough for two people to share and feels very luxurious, although it's sometimes difficult to find pillow cases that will fit.

5423459,3,B00AFF3N6S,"Much firmer than I expected.  For instance, this is not a pillow you can just throw your head back on.... feels like a rock.  However, the pillow warms, it conforms to your head and the weight of your head.  Takes some getting used to.  If you like a pillow you can ""cuddle"" with - this isn't it.

5423461,5,B00AFF3N6S,"I first found this pillow at a BigLots store locally gad bought it for nearly a steal! I needed a new pillow, but when it comes to shopping for pillows, the same rule applies as does for Forrest Gump and his box of chocolates: you never know what you're going to get!

On the first night, I slept a full 6 hours without interruption, and woke up with no soreness in my neck. Most gel or foam pillows will form to your sleep needs, but I needed one that would tailor to my needs as a back or side sleeper. This is the only pillow that has accomplished this. I've had mine since before Thanksgiving 2013, and it still works great! It confirms to my head and provides just the right amount of sleep. I have severe back problems (bulging discs), so finding something that'd comfortable is pretty important.

After several months of seeing this pillow sold out everywhere I looked (including here), I was super excited to see that it was for sale again. I immediately bought one for my boyfriend directly from Amazon. He is completely the opposite of me with regard to how he sleeps. I was apprehensive, but he thanked me for buying it for him, and he's now recommending it to his friends. Best pillow on the market, no doubt!",1395273600,11,1221,4.4222222222222225

Didn't notice any smell..but maybe because the bags were all slightly open ...they were already aired out. I needed new pillows and with my stiff neck/shoulders thought this might help. It's a good thing I bought two, since per some other reviews the hazardous chemicals and noxious fumes they report  may cause me to grow a second head.. HA HA.. anyhow, here's what I'm finding so far.. they do feel cool to the touch, they are firm yet malleable..someone described the feel like clay.. maybe...a soft clay.. I am sleeping more comfortably.. granted it's only been a week.. we'll see how they hold up. I've seen similar pillows for much more money at places like Bed, bath and beyond.. so I feel like I got a bargain .. we'll see.",1392681600,,845,4.596026490066225

Please everyone research fire retardant products in mattresses, furniture and pillows. I will never by these types of products again. Very bad for you to breathe these materials and these companies know how bad it is for your health.

5423472,2,B00AFF3N6S,"This is a weird pillow!  I picked one up a few days ago from Big Lots ($12).  I squished the ends that stuck out of the box with my hand and I was excited to bring it home to try.  It seemed like it would be ""just right"".  But upon actually using it, I can only say it is like modeling clay.  It compresses down quickly and is then very hard, not at all springy like solid memory foam/poly-fill/regular foam.  This is chopped up memory foam and it's properties changed dramatically.

I like to hug my pillows and tuck an end under my neck.  This one is much easier to squish and conform to almost any shape unlike solid memory foam pillows.  The problem is that it stays compressed and doesn't spring back quickly, if at all.  No ""memory"" at all with this pillow.  So after it squishes down to conform to whatever shape you wanted, it tends to stay like that.  When you change positions, you need to fluff the rather heavy and very dense pillow each time.  It's very hard to fluff, too.  It requires shaking and punching.  Once it compresses from your head, it's pretty darn hard with very, very, little give.  Not rock hard, but I lifted my head and pushed my fingers into it and they only went in maybe a 1/2"".  I watched as the pillow never sprung back to pillow shape, the indentation remained there.  This is probably why they are at Big Lot's for $12.

I found myself fighting with this pillow last night each time I moved.  It is hard to fluff up.  All that being said, once I got it right and formed it to my neck and stopped thinking about it, I actually slept quite well.  I feel like it has potential if only ???? - like I want to blow air into it.  Maybe a 50/50 regular foam/memory foam mix might be better, or just regular chopped up foam, if they make those anymore.

Consider it's modeling clay-like properties and it could be right for certain uses.  If you lie in one position and need a pillow that conforms to your shape and provides support, it might work for you.  I'm keeping mine because it seems like it might come in handing someday and now I have 5 different pillows to arrange each night to try and get comfortable.

It did come with a removable zippered cover and that's a plus.  It might make a great pet bed for a cat.  Could be very supportive under a bad back/neck.",1386374400,5,2298,4.2668213457076565
5423473,5,B00AFF3N6S,"Nobody knows how long I have been on the hunt for a decent pillow.. Forever!!. The hunt is finally over.
I too bought it at big lots for 12.00.

Pro: It's not hard firm but how can I explain it? it's dense really dense but thick and fluffy . does that make sense?
Con: it had an oder I think it was from the plastic that it came in , I aired it out a couple of days and  fabreezed it and it was fine,

It had the same smell as blankets that come from the store that come in those plastic zippered  covers. (but I can wash those not sure if I can wash this).",1386374400,,557,3.7758620689655173
5423474,5,B00AFF3N6S,"Bought these (they come in Queen and Jumbo size...I got the Jumbo as it's closest to a standard size pillow) from Big Lots for $12 each 2 days ago. They are heavy and thick. They somehow conform to my head but don't SINK as other pillows do. I'm a side sleeper and this really helps. I believe that after a small break in period they will get even better. This pillow also stays relatively cool (it's been in the 30's at night here in Houston. I have no heat on and a fan going due to hot flashes lol)  I was in Bed Bath and Beyond earlier that day considering some $50+ pillows, i'm glad I took the chance on these.

They remain full, contour to my neck and head and stay cool. I've even leaned into them with my elbows reaching for a book and when I remove my elbow the pillow poofs right back up again. They're heavier than the standard fill pillow. They're very full and supportive. With memory foam pillows, I prefer the ""chunks"" of memory foam to the ""slab"" of memory foam because the chunk pillows are so much fuller. I'm so glad I tried these pillows.",1384300800,,585,4.580952380952381

5423478,5,B00AFF3N6S,I love this pillow! It is very supportive and yet the memory foam bits and micro gel beads make it feel light to lay on. It does not loose it shape. I have severe neck problems and this pillow has helped a lot. But like a previous reviewer I purchased mine for $12.00 at Big Lots. So I would check that out first.,1379203200,2,313,3.984126984126984
5423479,2,B00AFF3N6S,This pillion was not what I was expecting. I will grant that it's soft but it was not what I was looking for. I needed something that would support both the lower part of my head as well as my neck.,1378252800,2,198,3.8536585365853657

5423481,1,B00AFF3N6S,"I REALLY wanted to love this pillow.  Sadly, I do not.  I can't attest to comfort or not, and I note others said it was ""heavy"" - that I did not find it to be; if you've had any type of foam pillow, most have some weight to them.  My issue with this pillow is the smell.  I aired them for several days, however, the smell is just as strong.  If you have asthma or scents/smells trigger uncontrollable coughing, then this pillow is NOT for you.  Sadly, I had to return them - so my hunt for the perfect pillow goes on!",1377302400,3,517,4.019607843137255

5423483,4,B00AFF3N6S,"I just bought 2 of these pillows from Big Lots for my husband and I. Being a Serta, I thought for the price of $12 each, it was worth a try. The first night was a bit restless because it was so thick, the second night was better, but I have a problem with the strong odor of the polyurethane foam. I have Fibromyalgia and strong smells make me ill. I am worried if it smells that strong, it could be bad to breathe all night. I am attempting to 'air' the pillows for a while to see if that will help.",1376956800,,500,3.911764705882353
5423484,5,B00AFF3N6S,"Ahhhhhh is how I feel when my head hits this pillow cuz it gives me more quality hours of sleep! I rarely say that anything priced three times above what a regular price goes for is worth it, but THIS is worth paying 3 times more than a regular pillow is priced because it helps me stay asleep. I have back and neck probs and unless my neck is perfectly lined up when I sleep I will awaken in pain. This pillow is supportive yet soft (I don't know how) what I love is that whatever shape I put it in, it STAYS in til the morning. It doesn't flatten out which is a great help to my degenerative discs. I'm also mostly a side sleeper and one pillow wasn't enough to get the right angle. When I was using 2 regular pillows I would awaken at least 4 times per night cuz the pillows had slipped or flattened out. With this awesome pillow I sleep through the night and find I have more energy in the day which is saying alot because I have been diagnosed with Fibromyalgia and that means my energy level is always 50% lower because of the disease process. I highly reccomend it & as a matter of fact I'm ordering one to tuck away in case they stop making them, THAT's how much I love this pillow!",1376956800,18,1190,4.111587982832618
