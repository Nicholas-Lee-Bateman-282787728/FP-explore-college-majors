8163648,1,B000LQJAGS,"There were 57 episdodes of this Cult British police action show, way before ""24"" and all these others, if it were not for the clothes and the cars, these episodes stand up well.

However please know that the WHOLE Box set (all 57 episodes) are available on Amazon. UK for the princely sum of 30 pounds or about US$43. I had my father buy it for me and post it to me here in Jamaica.

YES it is formatted for PAL and NOT the USA NTSC system, but I have a Bose 321 DVD system and just punched in the ""all regions"" unlock code (google it for your player), its a moot point anyway as THESE four box sets offered here on the US Amazon site are in PAL format.

Hope this helps",1276300800,16,670,4.022556390977444
