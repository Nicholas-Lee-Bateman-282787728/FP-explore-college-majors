8394043,3,B003BWQEEA,"The life of a vampire's familiar is not an easy one. Just ask Lendel. His vampire mistress calls him an idiot, complains about his whining, and threatens him (all in a terrible Eastern European accent) throughout Inbred Redneck Vampires (aka Bloodsucking Redneck Vampires), a hilarious B-movie from 2004 with ""cult"" written all over it.

The acting, sets, and writing are beautiful examples of the glories of B-dom. Played for laughs and stereotyping country folks to the max, Inbred Redneck Vampires tells the concurrent stories of a vampire on the run and the Pisser family, winners of a room redecorating contest from Bull Inseminatin' and Room Redecoratin' Monthly. Complicating the task of Monsieur Jean Claude (the French decorator with yet another terrible accent) are mama's matchmaking and the Annual Tripe Festival. Clearly the filmmakers and cast had a great time making their film, as shameless as it is in its extremes.

When Catherine, the vampire, and her familiar arrive in the town of Backwash, Tripe Festival and all, they plan to turn the population into an army of vampires. But what kind of vampires will the rednecks make? Extremely effective ones it would seem. Unfortunately for them, they aren't quite familiar with vampire survival techniques.

A little too much time is spent on flatulence--talking about, having it, and eating beans--but it's certainly not out of place in Inbred Redneck Vampires. Between that and Ma Pisser's cat-poo laced tripe casserole, viewers are sure to lose their appetites. Some have been known to shudder watching the casserole served, but it is an effective diet aid. Oh--one of the nude scenes might also make you swear off dessert (just sayin').

The best moments in Inbred Redneck Vampires are the exchanges between Catherine and Lendel. Fans of low-brow redneck humor should get a kick out of the excess that flows through this movie, wringing every joke it can from overwrought accents to overalls. Is Inbred Redneck Vampires a good film? Define ""good."" Actually, any definition would reduce Inbred Redneck Vampires to ""terrible,"" but it's terrible in such a good way. At no time does it take itself seriously; it's an awful film that succeeds at its mission (to be awful). DVD extras include trailers, bloopers and ""Behind the Scenes.""

""Inbred Redneck Vampires"" is the type of film that you introduce to ""certain"" friends by saying, ""You've gotta see this."" It is best served with beer, preferably lots of cheap beer.",1279584000,5,2480,5.11358024691358
8394044,1,B003BWQEEA,"Start with a house where two vampire women live, along with one man-servant, and another man - a supposed body-guard.

A female client is laid out on one of the beds as a vampire is moving over her ready to feed. The other vampire is sitting downstairs looking endlessly bored.

Upstairs the female vampire moves over her victim and bites her.

Move back to the other vampire looking bored (yet again - about the third cut to her for no apparent reason).

Cut back to the bedroom and the vampire is being struck from behind by a faceless vampire killer. The guard hears her death and runs to the bored vampire woman and they both take-off. Why he wasn't guarding the other I don't know. Why they have to run away... I don't know either.

As they move along, they meet up with a redneck. They stop his car and his inane chatter leads the vampire to bite him, drag him from the car and then they take the car.

And here's where it gets really bad! The guy wakes up, as a vampire. Goes home and then bites his wife. She's a vampire now. They go to the diner, and so on. A vampire plague is breaking out. And the vampire who started this all didn't know that this would happen???

She's walking about trying to get a meal, but most are already now vampires!

Aside from some nudity this film has nothing going for it.

It makes no sense. I regret buying this film",1278460800,2,1359,4.27734375
