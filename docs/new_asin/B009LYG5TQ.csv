8542887,5,B009LYG5TQ,"This was a really cool, gritty indie sci fi movie.  It was touching to watch after Ernest Borgnine passed away recently.  He is a great actor, and this was one of his last performances at age 93!",1359331200,,195,4.243243243243243
8542888,1,B009LYG5TQ,"This may be one of the worst movies ever made. The acting is awful,the plot is stupid and the overall quality is just bad. Don't waste your money on this one.",1357948800,,158,4.129032258064516
