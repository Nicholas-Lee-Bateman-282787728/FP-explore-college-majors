8602841,1,B00E96AYUM,I just hate this. The videos are awful and outdated looking. I really dislike it.,1469059200,,81,4.466666666666667
8602842,2,B00E96AYUM,NOT THE FAST MUSIC AND GYMNASTIC EXERCISES I EXPECTED...  INTRODUCTORY MUSIC IS GREAT BUT THE ROUTINES DO NOT FOLLOW UP...  I WAS EXPECTING SOMETHING MORE LIKE ZUMBA AND DIDN'T GET IT!,1447804800,,184,4.903225806451613
8602843,1,B00E96AYUM,"Not extreme, not 'fat blasting'...No actual 'dance moves' - seems like something filmed in the 80s.",1444694400,,99,5.25
8602844,5,B00E96AYUM,"Ladies- If you want to have a blast and lose your 'jiggly- parts'
I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS SET.

Just bought for a friend's birthday as well. Very nicely produced!",1400457600,,162,4.586206896551724
8602845,1,B00E96AYUM,If you are in shape in any form than this DVD is not for you.  There is no cardio aspect.  It looks like it was filmed 20 years ago in a creepy concrete basement.  There is no excitement from the instructors.  Do not buy.,1394582400,4,221,3.9545454545454546
8602846,1,B00E96AYUM,"I don't typically write reviews, especially negative ones, but if I had read a review on this product I definitely would not have wasted my money or time on it.

The quality of the video is extremely poor - It looks like it was filmed in someone's basement. (The pictures on the DVD case are stock photos and have nothing to do with the DVD.) The ""dance"" instructor was almost as exciting and motivating as the teacher in ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off."" There is also nothing ""extreme"" about this workout. After 30 minutes I was not sweating in the least. It was mostly the same move over and over (side to side step) with a few little extra moves thrown in occasionally. There was nothing about this routine that would make one consider it a cardio workout.

Sorry to be so negative, but there really wasn't any positives I could say about this DVD. Don't waste your time or money on this one!",1393977600,7,890,4.45398773006135
8602847,4,B00E96AYUM,"This workout is lower intensity, more for a beginner. The moves are easy to follow and the music is fun!",1389744000,,104,4.25
8602848,1,B00E96AYUM,The dvd's are of poor quality and the workouts are awful. I was EXTREMELY disappointed!!!! I will never purchase from mill creek entertainment again.,1388188800,,149,5.25
