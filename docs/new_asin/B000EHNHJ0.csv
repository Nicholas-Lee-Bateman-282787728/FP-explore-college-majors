2520601,5,B000EHNHJ0,"I can not tell you how moved I was by RISING FROM THE RAILS, the Story of the Pullman Porter. I received the film as a gift from a friend whose son was involved in the production of the film. Growing up in the late 1950's I remember fondly the Age of Steam but was unaware of the significant impact that the Pullman porters had on the rise of the Black middle class and the resultant Civil Rights movement. This is a powerful story and documentary film making at its finest!",1146960000,15,474,4.21978021978022
2520602,5,B000EHNHJ0,"I was simply astounded by this film. Having grown up in the 50's and traveled by train with my family on numerous occasions, I was deeply moved by the images and stories of the Pullman Porters. The interviews, flashbacks, dramatic depictions were extremely well done, and I particularly noticed the excellent photography and narratives. My own recollection was that the Pullman Porters were highly regarded, and I had a sense of sincere respect and safety in their presence, even as a young child. It is so interesting to see that the fruits of their hard work and sometimes excessive discipline, are the many successful sons and daughters who can now tell their beautiful and touching stories. The filmmakers of Rising From The Rails deserve an Academy Award. I am ordering a number of DVD's to send to friends and family.",1140048000,17,823,4.885714285714286

8110181,5,B000EHNHJ0,"This documentary offers a rare look into a profession that was highly regarded, in the African
American community, from the early, to mid- 20th century, for black men.

One of my grandfather's worked as a pullman porter during his life, and until viewing this film,
I had little knowledge, about the workings or value of Pullman Porters, and how their labor
movement would later factor into the Civil Rights Movement of the 50's & 60's, thru the
great, A. Phillip Randolph.

Strongly recommend this film; a piece of African American history, woven in American
tapestry, that has gone unnoticed!

8110182,5,B000EHNHJ0,"What a fantastic documentary about the Pullman Porter - the subjects were so articulate, interesting and this was a thoroughly enjoyable and heart-touching documentary. The stories were just outstanding and I feel richer for knowing more about this chapter of American history. Highly recommend!",1269648000,,295,5.7272727272727275
8110183,2,B000EHNHJ0,"At the conclusion of the ""Rising From the Rails"" DVD, I came to the conclusion I had purchased an infomercial for the author's book.  Dispite a couple of heart-felt testomonials, this production lacked any balance to aid the viewer's perception of the atrocious working conditions which were common place during the industrial revolution.  No reference was made of the European immigrants that were mutilated or killed in the coal mines, foundries, and railyards which supported the railroads the porters rode upon.  I would suspect the author misled many viewers that racial inequality in those times was exclusively towards African Americans, when infact it also existed for significant numbers of European imigrants.  I expected the storyline to contain other personal experiences such as the train wreck victim experience, rather than percieved racial inequities of the period.  Unfair and unbalanced production.",1170806400,2,916,5.561151079136691
