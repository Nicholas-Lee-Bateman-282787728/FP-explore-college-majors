486318,4,6302597706,This movie was excellent.  The only problem with it is that the Navy doesn't send SEALs on suicide missions.  But other than that they did a great job of portraying the SEALs.  I am currently training to be a SEAL.,926380800,,214,4.3

486392,3,6302597706,The movie itself is great... but the negative is the over use of cursing throughout the movie.,1410825600,,94,4.588235294117647

486394,5,6302597706,You more than likely haven't seen this movie unless your ages 25 and up. Very accurate account of the U.S navy SEALs,1365120000,,116,4.318181818181818
486395,5,6302597706,"Great movie, Couldn't find it on DVD for years.  Had it on VHS, everytime I wanted to watch it I had to hook up my VHS.",1338768000,,119,3.576923076923077
486396,5,6302597706,"Thank you for finally putting this product on DVD.  A great movie to see Rob Lowe in a role that is not typical for him though pulls it off effortlessly.  I wish they would also put out a music soundtrack disc for the movie.  RAM, one of my favorite bands from the late '80s early '90s, is playing ""on the jukebox"" during the bar room brawl toward the first of the movie.  It is an overall great action movie with a real story.",1325980800,,427,4.108433734939759
486397,5,6302597706,i watched this movie when i was younger when it first came out and loved it and ever since i had been out on my own i have looked for this movie on DVD and can not find it. most all other movies in this world are on DVD why not this one?,1302739200,,237,3.490566037735849
486398,4,6302597706,"I too have been waiting for this movie (and ""The Silver Strand"") to come to DVD. I have most every movie, documentary and History Channel and the Military Channel program that has anything to do with SEALs. After watching my sons carreer in the Navy since 92' and a SEAl since 97' you can well imagine my library. Not to mention the home Movies of portions of his 2 Buds Class's. Anyway, I too find this movie entertaining and am always amused to read comments from many before me who speak as though they really know what they are talking about. Sorry to burst your bubble boys but although there is some authenticity in this movie it is still 98% Hollywood. My son always states that the day an authentic movie comes out about the ""Job"" he does will be a scary day for America. The good new is there are a few movies in the pipeline, including a couple about SEAL's in Nam. The one which I am told might be coming out in the relatively near future is more up to date. Again remember, anything we see on the little or big screen will be filtered so much that it too will be very enjoyable but not truely realistic. Did you like ""Tears Of The Sun"" with Bruce Willis. I loved it but NOT anything like a real SEAL mission!!OK, the one that will most probably be coming out soon has to do with what is now a Seal Recruitment Tag...maybe a book too...and the movie will probably not be called this but at THIS time it is ""I AM THAT MAN"".....GOD BLESS AMERICA",1298678400,3,1454,4.271739130434782
486459,5,6302597706,"I searched for this video for a while and finally found it used on amazon.  Leary of buying used I had resisted for some time, but other than a few pause fuzzes that don't affect the watchability the tape was fine, and the movie was as good as I remembered.  Action, adventure and a hot redhead combine to hold my attention.  Classic military drama.",1264809600,,349,4.421875
486460,2,6302597706,I am watching this on MGM HD and its two star rating on my Time Warner guide may be exaggerated. This is a dull and boring excuse for a movie. The scene with Lowe and the other guy hang gliding away from the Iraqis with their fan propelled back packs was hysterical. This is an awful movie with dreadful acting. Don't waste your time.,1255737600,,334,4.234375
486461,3,6302597706,"A blend of action/adventure with romantic drama is attempted in this work completed soon after the ""Desert Storm"" imbroglio in the Middle East, showcasing Rob Lowe and Gale Hansen as U. S. Navy Seals sharing a desire for underwater military operations as well as for a comely marine biologist played by Tracy Griffith. As the film opens, Lawrence Hammer (Lowe) and Dean Meszoly (Hansen) become best friends while training in California to be Seals, where they meet and compete for favours from Barbara (Griffith); after the course is successfully completed, a Las Vegas sojourn for R & R is discontinued by sudden nuptials for Hammer and Barbara, an event that Dean regards with despair, and so the companionship of the young commandos is no more. The impending U.S./Iraq conflict, as orchestrated via ""Desert Shield"", forms the background for the picture's largest segment, as the two Naval officers, now become mini-sub specialists upon opposite American coasts, are reunited as members of a task force to be deployed near an island in the Strait of Hormuz where an Iraqi naval site is reportedly being developed in order to utilize biological warfare. During what is nearly a suicide mission, Hammer receives severe wounds, and Meszoly requests that Barbara come to Dubai to visit her husband in hospital, hopefully expediting recuperation, but Hammer soon joins his fellow Seals in a last chance foray to destroy the biochemical weapons, no matter what risks the team must take. The disparate components - personal relationships and combat daring - do not mesh here, primarily from a lack of directoral clarity, in addition to blocking gaffes, as improbabilities quickly become cliche, although there are some suspenseful moments. The production was shot at and about San Diego and its environs, with acting honours going to Hansen who creates a layered role; actual doctored film segments made during Desert Storm seem positively instructional in comparison with this feature, that additionally casts mainly Israeli players in Arab parts.",1217116800,,2043,5.250764525993884
486462,4,6302597706,"This movie traces the lives of two navy seals buddies during operation Desert Shield or Desert Storm. It shows how these two buddies met, who they were, their lives as SEALS, the operation and the end of it all. Hammer played by Rob Lowe is the one who loves the job. He would put his life on the line for the SEALS any day and as the old phrase goes ""wild horses could not drag me away"". The other, Mesoley played by Gale Hansen is the more ""it's a job"" sort of guy he could take it or leave it. This movie explores these two men on a personal level. Hammer is the arrogant daredevil SEAL where Mesoley is the play it safe humble sort of SEAL their personalities contrast each other. The real victim of this story is played by Tracy Griffin, the woman torn between two lovers. The movie shows you quite a different side of war one from the perspective of someone who's been there. Its a movie that should be appreciated for its different view on the war and the affects it has on those who fight it. While it has everything you would expect as a war movie don't see it as purely a war movie this movie is more about two buddies caught in war and the price they had to pay for that war. I enjoyed this movie because it was different its not the average arrogant Navy SEALS movie definately worth a look if you're into that sort of thing.",1162080000,6,1337,4.186046511627907
486463,5,6302597706,This movie is one of the best NAVY SEAL movies out there.,991094400,4,57,3.8333333333333335
486464,5,6302597706,"I was in this film (as an extra). We had 3 SEALs on hand to make sure SEAL details stayed accurate. In addition, most of the extras portraying  soldiers were either veterans of the US Army, the Marines or the Israeli  Army. (Most of the action scenes were shot in Israel.) Rob Lowe will never  know what it is to be a real soldier, and as an actor just learned to  ""talk the talk"", but many of the others you see in uniform have  also ""walked the walk"". This can be seen in the small details.",966643200,13,492,4.083333333333333
486465,5,6302597706,i loved the movie very much except the part when hammer dies i don't think it was called for but other than that it was great. by the way if anyone out there can let me know where i can download that song from that movie  when they are under the boat i don't know the name of that song and im going  crazy trying to find it. if you know it please e-mail to me the info at  madcuban5@aol.com,950227200,,390,3.85
486466,5,6302597706,"Guys,this is the best, most realistic seal movie ever produced.
You have underwater rebreathers,MP5 SD3 suppressed weapons, TAC boards and all other high tech seal gizmos. But still could not see any underwater weaponry like  those used by Speztnaz which propells 5 inch darts from 5.56mm cartridges  in full auto.
The company should continue to produce this fantastic and  highly memorable movie. I saw it when I was in Oklahoma. Please let me know  when this title is available again. I have many military friends who wants  to buy it. I am serious!  Its the only technically accurate SEAL movie.",948412800,2,598,4.93
7828071,1,6302597706,"I got the wrong movie.  The box was correct but the DVD was a semi-pornographic movie. Thankfully my kids weren't watching when I plugged it in, hoping it was just a trashy trailer.  I already sent it back and I can't remember the title of the worst movie I ever previewed.  Siskel and Ebert two thumbs and a few toes down.  I am trying to figure out how to get a copy of ""The Finest Hour"". Any ideas?  I don't want to order another from the same supplier. I don't need another trip to the UPS store to send another fake movie back. Oh well.  I know one of the actors in The Finest Hour so maybe I'll give it one more try.",1505952000,,622,4.016260162601626

7828073,3,6302597706,"IWas made aware of the film by reading of it's production in Rob Lowes 'Stories I Only Tell My Friends' Honestly,  Im glad many people liked it.  Hope it glorifies our Military folk as much as Lowes  tale of the filming. Brave Navy Seals stood between him and death. Seriously. The  whacko Menahem Golan was directly responsible for nearly drowning Lowe as he was chopped to bits in the propeller. All while inhaling (choking on) smoke from burning tires. A cheap way of producing smoke in a film. And, unsafe. A  Navy Seal saw what was happening and jumped in, placed himself between the propeller and Rob , pulled him out of the boats deadly vortex sucking him down. Wonder if Menahem Golan noticed? I know Menahem Golan threw a hissy fit; an actress hesitated removing her top. He wanted to see the breasts that day. Lowe apparently kibashed it. In his telling at least. I found that interesting, and hope it greatly honors Our Military heroes. I also hope Menahem Golan has learned something.",1500940800,,996,4.668571428571428
