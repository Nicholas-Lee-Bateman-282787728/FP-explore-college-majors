7943658,1,B00005LC7K,"The production value of this little ""gem"" is poor to say the least.  Unless all the footage is pre-1980, the quality of the scenes are very poor in quality.  The voice-over is bland and monotonous.  Even the obligatory music is of lousy recorded quality.  If only Amazon allowed a negative stars rating I would have given that instead.",1097625600,2,335,4.724137931034483
