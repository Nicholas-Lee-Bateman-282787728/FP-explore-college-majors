8551246,4,B00AG6KHPQ,"South Korean documentary Planet of Snail (Dalpaengee eui byeol) follows the life of a married couple Cho Young-Chan and Kim Soon-ho living in an apartment room in the Seoul suburb. While Soon-ho has a spine disability, Young-Chan has hearing and visual impairment. But they can communicate with each other very well, perhaps better than any other couples.

Planet of Snail has no voiceover. Sometimes the couple is seen communicating with each other using finger Braille, but you will not learn much about it. The documentary is more like a collection of sketches of their everyday life, like going to the beach, doing a sleigh ride, or replacing a light bulb together.

And that is exactly what the director Yi Seung-Jun wanted. These images tell you all that we should know about them. The director spent about two years to record the life of Young-Chan and Soon-ho, but refuses to touch upon personal topics about the couple.

Some episodes suggest the difficulties that might await the couple. One of their friends, also a blind person, gets severely injured because of an accident. Also, Soon-ho cannot help thinking about what will happen to her husband if she dies first. The small and quite documentary is charming and life-affirming, but free from sentimental moments.",1395100800,,1277,5.042654028436019

8551248,5,B00AG6KHPQ,"Why you might like this documentary:

Simply put, (but inadequately): There is a married couple in Korea, he is tall, blind and deaf, she is a dwarf. They communicate mostly by touch... there is a method of 'typing,' fingers on fingers. (as shown on the cover of the video) She types on his, he types back on hers. That is mostly what happens in the documentary... their daily lives as they communicate. The challenge of replacing a light bulb. Dinner with Friends. A visit to the beach, a visit to the park. You would think it would be boring... like ""that's all?""

But what this movie is really about is love. It is evident in every touch, every second of film. And of course love, true deep love, is never boring.",1369785600,4,716,4.458015267175573
8551249,5,B00AG6KHPQ,"The film is very uplifting, when you see the fullness of life this couple enjoys. Despite everyday struggles, big or small, they ive a diverse life, go out, read, stage performance and meet with friends.",1364342400,,203,4.828571428571428
