5063750,5,B00790583S,I LOVE Miranda!! This 3rd in her series was awesome. Can't wait for the 4th! Series 3 ends with a great cliff hanger!,1392940800,,117,4.130434782608695
5063751,5,B00790583S,"This is the best comedy in years! We laugh out loud many many times per episode. WARNING, these are from the UK and allow a lot of non censored material that the US versions do not. The US versions are better as they are cleaner.",1391558400,,229,4.111111111111111
5063752,5,B00790583S,"Miranda is a great comedienne with a truly original and very funny show. Took a while to find a DVD recorder that works with UK DVDs, but it was worth it.",1391212800,,154,4.0
5063753,5,B00790583S,"I love this series. Miranda is hilarious.  I first saw her on ""Not Going Out"" and Graham Norton. she is also on ""Call the Midwife"" I hope to see a lot more of Miranda Hart. Miranda pokes fun at herself and is brilliant at physical comedy.",1389744000,,238,4.173913043478261
5063754,5,B00790583S,"We have enjoyed all three series (we call them seasons in the U.S).  The only disappointment is that series 3 was too short.  However, still five stars because it is so funny.  Down side for those purchasing this item in the U.S. is that you can not play it on a regular dvd player.  You need to have an all region player, which are reasonably priced and well worth the money if you plan to purchase more British movies and television series.",1388275200,2,442,4.353658536585366
5063755,5,B00790583S,LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS IS SO SO SO FUNNY Mirdanda Hart is awesome I have this and series 1 & 2 I can not wait till series 4 comes out they say 2015 but I've also heard they may not come out with series 4 that would be awful but we will see ANOTHER MUST HAVE,1408060800,,254,3.5535714285714284
5063756,5,B00790583S,"I desperately want to be her friend.  ( need more laughing which makes us younger)
Shes beyond funny.  I love the wicked English humor and this series has it in spades and diamonds...
The acting by all is first rate and beyond and the comic timing is unsurpassed in any comedy series Ive ever seen! ( except perhaps the hysterically funny UK sexy couples romp  ""Coupling "" series). Laugh yourself silly and get younger!!!",1407110400,,421,4.662162162162162
5063757,5,B00790583S,"Miranda , season 3 , is hilarious. She is an exceptional comedian. My daughter bought me an international DVD player just so I could watch Miranda. Best gift ever. Anxiously awaiting series 4.",1406419200,,192,4.848484848484849
5063758,5,B00790583S,"I love silly, wacky British humor and this show is great. I never get tired of re-watching this series because the characters are all so funny in their own right, especially Tilly (bear with) and Penny (such fun!) I can't wait for Season 4 because this show is such a treat for me.",1403740800,,281,4.320754716981132
5063759,5,B00790583S,"My DVR cannot hold up much longer, but I refuse to give it up or I lose all my Miranda recordings from PBS .... Forever!  Come on, please sell the show in a format that will run on American DVD players.  I will promptly buy 10 as gifts for my favorite friends who love to laugh!",1401235200,,278,3.9464285714285716
5063760,5,B00790583S,"Season 3 is wonderful and plays brilliantly on our region-free DVD player with no pixelation. Highly recommended for Miranda fans, as the concluding episode ends in a cliffhanger (no spoilers here)! The stellar comedic cast is back, and the actress who plays Miranda's best friend ""Stevie"" can really sing!",1399939200,,306,5.26530612244898
5063761,5,B00790583S,"Great show. Must have a region free DVD/BLU RAY player if in the US. Never fails to make you laugh! Always ""such fun""!",1398816000,4,118,4.173913043478261
5063762,5,B00790583S,"I rarely think television comedies are funny or worth a minute of my time (the Big Bang Theory being about the only one I'd ever watched for more than a few episodes,  I  burned out on that one after a few seasons).  But ""Miranda"" is an absolute delight, so hysterically funny that I laugh like a hyena.  I  love how she looks at the camera and interacts with the audience - I have seen this done before in movies, but Miranda does it best!  The rest of the cast is wonderful as well (Tom Ellis is delicious!).

I finished watching the  three series in  3 days and am ready to start over from the beginning.  Miranda Hart is a treasure in Call The Midwife, and even more so in this series.  Mega-talented and lovable, exuding good cheer and charm,  I hope Ms. Hart continues to entertain us for many years to come.",1397779200,2,814,4.282894736842105
5063763,5,B00790583S,"...I would do the bended knee trick (actually my knees don't work all that well)
and beg Miranda Hart to marry me. It's a pure (actually) impure lust thingy.
Ah,...to the review. I have all three seasons and she (the ""aluuuring"" Ms. Hart) is the MOST
entertainingly, totally, laugh out loud funny soul I have ever encountered. I LOVE her, and the whole crew.
Wonderful and funny, Funny, FUNNY episodes, All of them.
May we have more please?
Did I say FUNNY?

Note: This review applies to all three seasons of ""Miranda"".",1397606400,4,519,4.641304347826087
5063764,4,B00790583S,"It's one of those ""comfort"" shows I enjoy watching and re-watching while working.  The characters are just that!  I find myself savoring it knowing there will not be any more episodes anytime soon.  The traits I would find annoying as all get-out in real life, I can laugh at on screen.",1394150400,,286,4.568627450980392
8512474,5,B00790583S,"This show literally transformed my life. I used to be a fun, silly woman, but life hit me so hard that I lost my way and fell into a deep pit of despair and misery. When I found this show on Hulu, Miranda showed me HOW to be me again, and suddenly I began to do all those silly things again. I have watched every episode over and over. Sometimes I even go to sleep with it on. However, recently I had to cancel Hulu, which is the only way to watch it in the US, and I can't find it anywhere else. I'm desperately trying to find a US edition or a way to watch it without subscribing to Hulu again.",1522713600,,596,3.8934426229508197

8512477,5,B00790583S,"Miranda's comedy is hilarious and honest, something the everyday woman relate to. Her take on life in the show is refreshingly delightful, steering away from the stereotypical behaviors one would expect from adult. Miranda gets in touch with her inner child, would highly recommend it. A worthwhile purchase for me.",1465430400,,315,5.32

8512481,5,B00790583S,This a really hilarious series. Nobody can top the British  in the humor category.  Miranda is a very talented young lady and her delivery is right on target. I hope there is a Series 4.,1428192000,,186,4.285714285714286
8512482,5,B00790583S,"I love Miranda Hart, but why oh why isn't it formatted for USA?  She is very popular  here.  Please try to fix this.",1424995200,,116,3.9565217391304346
