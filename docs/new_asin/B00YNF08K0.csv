8718560,5,B00YNF08K0,"This is a wonderful movie. It should be seen by everyone - those who work with teenagers and those who want to learn more about the power of meditation. You see how people can be transformed by becoming part of something big rather that sitting on the outside learning irrelevant information ... I wish for that experience for anyone who is suffering in the world. Changing Minds is about making the world a better place. It is an inspiration,",1450310400,,443,4.620253164556962
8718561,5,B00YNF08K0,"""Changing Minds at Concord High School"" is a powerful documentary chronicling at-risk students in a NYC public school who against the odds self-improved their lives, their grades, their social skills, and their health using simple meditation techniques. The techniques presented in the film are highly successful in helping kids focus on self-improvement. In a world where many young people are diagnosed with Attention Deficit Disorder and Hyperactivity the film presents a non-chemical way to treat the problems. I recommend this documentary as a catalyst for change. This should be in every elementary, middle, and high school's curriculum.",1449532800,,643,5.639175257731959
