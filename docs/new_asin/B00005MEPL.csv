1624455,4,B00005MEPL,"It's amazing how modern engineering and people can get things done, especially something like the fires in Kuwait after the 1st Gulf War.

The scenario is horrible, but the stories of the people that were there and helped getting the job done are very inspiring.",1174348800,,262,4.822222222222222
1624456,4,B00005MEPL,"When I had ordered this movie, I was expecting an unmatchable quality that all IMAX films provide, with an overabundance of never-imagined realities of our surroundings. I'm a fan of the IMAX experience. This is why my recent purchase and viewing of FIRES OF KUWAIT was somewhat disappointing. The picture looked blurry to me. Not in certain areas, but continuously. Everything was enormously amazing to see, but we kept saying that we wished the focus was more sharp and clear.  Oh... the horror....Maybe we shouldn't.",1141862400,3,519,5.105882352941176
1624457,3,B00005MEPL,"Watched the Imax DVD last night.

The footage is amazing, but quality of

the picture is very poor.  Could not

read the final commentary as the words

were out of focus.  This is a great

pity.  I have rated it 3 stars due

to the poor quality of the transfer.

Also sound at times was not the best.

Will watch it again sometime though.

It is an awesome sight seeing these

oil wells burning.",1136937600,5,395,4.175675675675675
1624458,5,B00005MEPL,"I saw this in the IMAX theater and was blown away.  I don't know what the reviewer called 'ptrainor' is talking about.  He/she seems confused.  Being there in the midst of these huge plumes of flame and nighttime darkness at midday is surreal.  I've never seen anything like it, even in today's special effects-laden fictional movies.  And the ingenuity and raw determination of these firefighting teams is amazing.  I agree with the reviewer who said the scene looks like ""hell on earth"".  If you wonder what the end of the world will look like, it probably resembles this.  The cool thing is that this 'hell on earth' was conquered by human creativity, bravery and determination.  Get this movie and watch it on a big screen with a good sound system.  It's been 12 years since I saw it, and I've never forgotten its vivid images.",1082678400,4,831,4.6689655172413795
1624459,3,B00005MEPL,"I bought this video by mistake. I honestly thought I was buying a ""documentary"" illustrating the fires in Kuwait in high speed photography (slow motion) that I had seen years ago. What I got was a 39 minute version of John Wayne's 1968 ""Hellfighters""-'Behind the scenes'. There is so much detail overlooked, and so much unnecessary commentary, that the photography, and subject, took a back seat. It was designed to be more of a PR vehicle for supporting the Kuwaiti regime, if it had any specific message at all.
The movie I _was_ looking for is ""Lessons in Darkness"" and blows this Discovery Channel excuse for a documentary away in all categories. I eventually got the right film (ASIN: B000059PPP Director: Werner Herzog).
Do not, repeat NOT, miss Lessons of Darkeness if this film intrigues you. I don't respect Rip Torn any less for his work on this film than I did after seeing Beastmaster, but a buck is a buck.
Content aside, the audio was extremely well mixed for 5.1, especially when 2-way radio traffic was faintly put on the rear effects channels. Video transfer from the IMAX format to DVD was absolutely horrible. Final credits are do bad that many are unintelligible. This was not put together to be visually entertaining, as in LiD.
yikes.",1040688000,10,1256,4.792626728110599
1624460,3,B00005MEPL,"This video is WONDERFUL in the cinematography that it has.  Unfortunately, the writers and directors failed to properly tell the story.  Thankfully, they didn't have a bias but were looking at just telling the story, but the need to tell us a little more.  There was no map of where in Kuwait the fires were.  The audio between the ambient sounds and the narrative voice-overs occasionally blended too well.
  If you are looking for a DVD with a lot of oil well fires, great cinematography, and a little historical background - this one is for you.
  If you are seeking a little more in the Gulf War and it's ramafications, you might want to consider a different source.
  Pretty good - needed a little more work with the story.",1034294400,3,728,4.573643410852713
1624461,3,B00005MEPL,"I share the positive feedback other reviewers have submitted about the film; the images of the afternoon sky almost completely filled with smoke make you shudder. This looks like Hell on earth.
I found the sound quality was not as powerful as on some other IMAX films; the C4 and dynamite explosions do not have the impact they really should, unless you set the volume on your system very high. I also found the video resolution quality was no better on the DVD than on other releases in VHS format. Granted, that may have been due to the extraordinarily difficult conditions.
The only other features offered on the DVD are a brief (around 5 minutes) interview with the producer, accompanied with some of the same footage used in the film, a choice of languages, and a theatrical trailer. Surprisingly, the trailer has the best sound and picture quality. In my view, that is not sufficient to justify the extra cost of the DVD.
For the sake of the importance of the subject matter, this film is recommended, with reservations, in VHS format.",1010102400,4,1041,4.725274725274725
1624462,1,B00005MEPL,"The video quality of ""IMAX - Fires of Kuwait"" is absolutely appalling, a complete shocker! The image displays all compression artefacts that there are in the book, and it does so heavily. It almost looks as bad as a RealAudio movie downloaded from the internet. It is impossible to watch this DVD with any kind of enjoyment at all. There is no excuse whatsoever to use such a poor transfer putting a 35 minute movie on a DVD which holds three hours at a reasonable bit-rate. I simply lack the vocabulary to express how disappointed and aggravated I am with this DVD. To make matters worse, there are not even any chapter stops, the whole movie is ""chapter 1"". If there was any rating lower than one star, I would have to use it. This DVD deserves ""minus five"" stars.",1001116800,17,766,4.478571428571429
1624463,5,B00005MEPL,"This film is a masterpiece. ""The fires of Kuwait"" takes you on a visual trip which is as beautiful as it is emotional. IMAX have made a great decision by releasing this one on video. But I guess this year is the 10th anniversary of the gulf war, and the time is appropriate for the release. The film is decicated to the bravery of the fire fighters who helped put off the fires. I think the film is awesome, and to me it stands as witness to the calamities of unconventional warfare. Seldom, if not never, do war crimes make such beautiful documentaries. That is probably why most war crimes are forgotten. Because I lived it, I remember that the war in the gulf led to many shattered lives... including but not limited to brave allied soldiers & over 600 innocent Kuwaiti civilians who were randomly rounded up during occupation- still prisoners in Iraq today. This award nominated film is fun as well as educational... I would highly recommend it to Documentary/History buffs,  film students, History students, Environmentalists & people whose lives were touched by the gulf war in one way or another: This is the one piece of memorabilia which you should treasure & it is probably the most telling, compelling and by far the best presented.",999129600,4,1243,4.701834862385321
1624464,5,B00005MEPL,"Yet another example of a superb IMAX film. Shot entirely on location in the oil fields of Kuwait, this film is one of the most dramatic and spectacular documentaries that was ever made. In the words of Director and Cinematographer David Douglas, ""It represents the the best and worst that humans have to offer."" The photography is superior and while never truly reproducing the IMAX scale on a 36 inch Sony 'WEGA' screen, the contrast between blackness and vivid color is most impressive. The detail is simply remarkable. There is a small amount of 'film artifact' that remains in this version, but it is minimal and does not distract from the overall presentation. The fires and blasts continue to send chills down my spine with each viewing! I am a part-time pyrotechnician/licensed blaster and will attest that this is the closest that I have to seen to reproducing the real thing on screen. The 5.1 Dolby Digital remaster is excellent and did very well on my Onkyo home theater. The low end is most impressive and only adds to the drama. If one were to photograph the fires of hell, I think this is how I would see it.
The narration by Rip Torn is interesting. An informative and factual script documents the monumental tasks that face the men and women that fight oil well fires, though the images tell most of the story. Although not prominently featured, you get to meet living legends in the business like George Hill and others in Joe Bowden's team. You can almost feel the heat coming off the screen! There is a strong message presented with this film and it will hit you right over the head. The accompanying 'documentary' on this dvd is very short and presents some commentary, but if there is one weakness with this disk, it is here. Expecting something from the MacGillivray IMAX series, this does not compete with those 'Making of...' films. This is the only IMAX film that I have not watched with my toddler children, as I believe it may be a bit too intense for them. For everyone else, I would recommend this movie to own and watch over and over and keep its message close to your heart.",999043200,5,2105,4.616

I was sorely disappointed by the DVD transfer quality from the source.  The picture was interlaced and blurry.  I expected better coming from IMAX.

As for the actual content, I though it was mediocre.  The film glossed over too many details.  I would have enjoyed more in-depth explanations of the information presented.",1199491200,,535,7.153846153846154
7945136,4,B00005MEPL,"During Saddam's withdrawel from Kuwait he had his army deliberately destroy the oilfields of Kuwait and pump the oil into the Gulf. This film looks at the effort that went into putting out the fires and putting the oilwells back into production.

One thing that always moved me about this film was its portrayal of the widespread destruction of Kuwait as a result of the First Gulf War. The second was the courage and commitment of the crews who went into Kuwait as firefighters. Fighting an oilwell fire is not the same as fighting an ordinary fire... the fire can be hotter and simply dousing it with flame is not enough to stop it from feeding on the fuel of raw oil. The ingenuity of the firefighters as well as their courage is on film for everyone to see.",1196985600,,761,4.474820143884892
7945137,5,B00005MEPL,"I have always been impressed with the images recorded on IMAX film projects through the years. However, it was always clear to me that the settings (except perhaps ""Everest"", also a personal favorite) were carefully planned and controlled. This IMAX film is quite different and must be appreciated as such. Rehearsing the aftermath of one of the most craven acts of destruction (economic, environmental, you name it) in modern history (while it happens) is bound to be unforgettable, but not for beauty. Indeed, those commenting on picture quality must consider the atmosphere in which this film was shot. It is clear during the film that everything was covered repeatedly and constantly by aqueous or burning petroleum, its vapor and by-products. This is an existential apocalyptic horror, not a careful video essay.

All of the above said, this film transported me to the middle of a truly unimaginable moment - darkness at noon, the sun (when visible) hanging heavily over the horizon like a full moon rising.

Saddam Hussein is being defended by some even to this day as a legitimate ruler whose deposition was unjust. It escapes me how anyone (especially an environmentalist) could come to such a conclusion given this attempt to poison an entire region. Strangely, this is the same man who later did fatally poison (by chemical warfare) his own Iraqi Kurdish people. In retropect, perhaps the dark mind that lit the Fires of Kuwait was afterward only drawn to greater destruction and human tragedy.

One of the most affecting films I have ever witnessed.",1186358400,2,1560,5.038759689922481
7945138,2,B00005MEPL,Loved the content but the picture quality was worse than VHS.  Viewing this video on a large plasma was pretty dreadful.  Give me the HD version with improved picture and I'd give this 5 stars.,1182902400,,193,4.485714285714286
7945139,5,B00005MEPL,"As Saddam's Iraqi army retreated from Kuwait during the Gulf War, his troops set fire to the oil fields, leaving them burning uncontrollably at a rate of over five million barrels of oil per day. If left alone these fields would have continued burning for over one hundred years dumping polluting soot and environmentally damaging byproducts into the atmosphere. This film captures the extraordinary scale of the situation and the complicated task and methods employed to extinguish these fires.",1181174400,2,495,5.2784810126582276
