I always marvel how, even though the language and inflection of Korean is different from western, the facial expressions and emotions accompanying the words is always exactly like westerners'. You almost don't even need the subtitles to gather whats happening.

This film is very well thought out and written. For instance, in one scene two teens are talking and experiencing innocent First Love, while their teacher and the protagonist look on. The teacher, a former singing star, wants to rush down into the park and get the kids back into their classroom. Our leading lady, however, persuades him to sing a certain song, which turns out to serve as a romantic background track for the two innocent teens. I mean, as an author, THAT is gooood writing!

The acting and direction is fantastic here. Watch for the significance of snow; there is a scene near the ending on a motor-scooter which I thought was just lovely.

This film did bring a tear to the ole eye several times---it's that good. So-young Ko is spectacularly good, and always almost-distractingly beautiful.

While the basic idea is not unique, it is---as they say, in a Good way---more of the same but different, in the best ways.

See it!

8386822,4,B0031AXTLS,"Sweeter than you'd think Korean dramedy about a thirty-year-old woman eking out a meager existence as an assistant to a designer, who considers her failures in life to be because she never became the girlfriend of the hot boy she didn't have the nerve to pursue in high school (who is now a Korean pop star).  When given the chance to go back in time for one week, she tracks down her younger self and is determined to change things for the better.  Everything, of course, goes more wrong as the film goes on ... the film ending on a surprising, touching note that tinges the comedy with genuine tenderness.",1356912000,,607,4.509090909090909
8386823,3,B0031AXTLS,"Obviously this isn't a movie made to be taken so seriously so don't try to find it's fault. It's a romance story about a teen girl in love who is about to learn a harsh lesson. Her older self who is pretty much a 30yo loser goes back in time to improve her life by changing the events of her past. The events to which she points out is blaming her first love for breaking her heart and ruining her life. It has been 13 years since she was used and dumped by her 1st boyfriend and she has held a grudge ever since. He becomes a famous singer that has long forgotten her because he has a life. On an unusually troubling day where our lead character cries herself to sleep she is met by the opportunity to travel back in time and changer her life via a computer program. (Please be advised that she is actually offered the chance to go back in time to change the past of her younger self in a completely different reality that does not change or effect her actual life in any way).

This is supposed to be a comedy? There's nothing funny that really happens in this movie it's mostly a drama disguised as a comedy and a very unrealistic one despite the plot. It tells the story of a 30yo woman who has not gotten over her first boyfriend that slept with her and dumped her. By chance she gets to travel back in time to try and stop herself from making the same mistake in her life. Interestingly enough she breaks all the fantasy rules of time travel yet it doesn't effect the future. I guess there are 2 realities hers and the one she created when she went back in time. Why do I say that because when she goes into the future nothing she did in the past impacts anything but she is able to communicate with her old self in her current time (huge plot hole).

Not to be so serious about something as silly as ""time travel"" but, when it's the plot of your movie why isn't it made clear that she is only effecting the past of herself in another reality. Even if the same events took place ""ALICE's"" influence would have changed her life in some way.

The one thing that makes this story so ridiculous is that it relies on one of her admirers being so infatuated with her that he never forgets her. He never meets any other women, never falls in love with someone else, never finds a REAL gf, never stops being an admirer and keeps eyes only for this girl he met in HS. This is the worst case of One Itis I have ever witnessed. The entire movie is overly serious and too dramatic for it's subject matter of ""Time Travel"". It sounds like it be comical as far as Korean Comedies go but it isn't. Most of the time the main character is crying or arguing with her younger self. Only a few ""comical"" scenes actually happen and when they do it isn't really funny, more like a break away from the heavy drama in the story.

Overall it's a 3/5 movie. Not amazing,not great, but good enough to watch depending on what mood your in. Most of this can be contributed to the lack of a story that made any logical sense.",1346025600,,3001,4.195840554592721
8386824,5,B0031AXTLS,"This was such a charming movie! It made me laugh, and even cry a bit. It's a movie about living with no regrets. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes movies such as 13 Going on 30 or likes KDramas such as the recently released Big.  Hope everyone enjoys it as much as I did, as this is now in one of my top 10!",1343692800,,323,3.8208955223880596
8386825,5,B0031AXTLS,"This is a great film. I saw this when it first came out in Korea. I loved it. It's funny and fairly original in story. Can't wait until I can own a copy. It's on  Netflix now, and I just watched it again. It's part love story, part comedy. It deals with life issues too. I would highly recommend to anyone with Netflix, watch it. You won't be disappointed. If you like it as much I do try to find a copy. Brings back awesome memories of my time in Korea.^^",1343433600,,456,4.010989010989011
