7888632,5,6305373655,"For years I have used this video to teach EMT's and Paramedics.  Understanding mechanisms of injury is essential to providing quality Trauma care.  This video is an excellent teaching tool for ""civilians"" and emergency professionals alike,",1301961600,,239,5.611111111111111
7888633,5,6305373655,"I remember seeing this when it was on PBS a while back and as a young driver, it really impressed upon me the importance of wearing a seat belt, and how the safety of the entire drive depends pretty much on you being in your seat belt.  The Volvo engineer's seat belt demo is forever ingrained in my memory.  The air bags, crumple zones, pop-out roll bars, safety glass - all of them assume you are in your seat belt to work effectively.  On roll-overs?  Good luck surviving without a seatbelt, especially in SUVs that like to roll.

Video is like gold, and can help educate on what to do in an accident.",1225584000,,604,4.3097345132743365
7888634,5,6305373655,"This program is EXCELLENT.  I teach Physical Science and show it each year to my students as we study forces and motion.  It talks about safety in car crashes, and stresses the importance of wearing a seatbelt with the suplemental air bag, in a very REAL way.  New drivers will be BELIEVERS after seeing this.",1204934400,,309,4.581818181818182
