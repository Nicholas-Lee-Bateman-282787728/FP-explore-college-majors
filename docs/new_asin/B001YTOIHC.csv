3830093,5,B001YTOIHC,"This show was canceled way before it's time. Terry Schappert delivered a level of enthusiasm to the history of the ten warrior societies in this DVD set unparalleled by anything on television today. Every episode is packed full of astounding historical details, and every one of them had at least one golden nugget information you won't get anywhere else but here. I can't praise this series highly enough. Schappert includes a plethora of information ranging from the men who forged history, to the soldiers under their command, to the weapons and equipment they used and innovated, to battlefields on which they fought, right down to their very motives and why they lived the way they did. Do yourself a great service and buy this DVD set.

Now if only the History Channel would release Peter Woodward's ""Conquest"" series on DVD too.",1359849600,3,835,4.921985815602837
3830094,5,B001YTOIHC,"AWESOME, I enjoyed it. Well done.
I showed it to my students in class and it was a great learning tool/asset in my classroom. I showed the ep/ about the Japan and the kids loved it.",1307923200,2,181,4.055555555555555
3830095,5,B001YTOIHC,"Students of weaponology and military history will enjoy this.  As a classroom teacher, I use some clips to help fill in gaps and to keep interest in the subject (World History).  I would recommend this for anyone even mildly interested in weapons, military history, or just history in general.",1306627200,2,293,4.959183673469388
3830096,5,B001YTOIHC,"I love this show so much. Terry is a great host, and the writing does a good job of condensing complex historical groups into short episodes without the degree of gross simplification and factual errors that occur in similar series. It's obvious that the makers of the show and Mr. Schappert have a great passion for history, and a huge amount of respect for the experts and historians that they meet. I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys military history and would enjoy a fun series that could introduce them to some stuff they may never have seen before.",1265414400,5,558,4.646464646464646
3830097,3,B001YTOIHC,"This was a great show during the entire first season. If you're like me and usually do not buy TV seasons simply because HC repeats the show so often. This show deserves a purchase, unlike so many shows of 2009 (Battles B.C., The Art of War), The History Channel put out a beauty with this one. It will keep your war needs satisfied for many years to come.

So why 3 stars? Well my major complaint is the replayability, you simply can't watch the same episode more than twice without becoming bored.

Again, don't let this stop you if you love History and Warrior cultures of the past.",1262995200,,585,4.407407407407407
3830098,5,B001YTOIHC,Terry Schappert is obviously a REAL GUY with a REAL backgound in this stuff.  He isn't an analyst or a historian.  He has lived it.  His sense of fun and adventure makes this History Channel series a keeper.  Bought one for my Dad for Christmas after we had seen the series on tv.  We had a wonderful time watching Terry experience the cultures of the warriors right along with us.,1257379200,4,381,4.385714285714286
3830099,5,B001YTOIHC,"Each episode delves into the mythical, social, and technological aspects of unique Warrior cultures: Mayan, Hawaiian, Samurai, Zulu, Viking, Malta, Sparta, German Barbarians, English Knights, and America's Special Forces.",1255737600,10,221,6.655172413793103
3830100,5,B001YTOIHC,"Swords against elephants, shields and spears against BULLETS!!! The host enthusiastically, and precisely explains the methods and motivations behind every soldier\warriors ability to overcome the odds. He also genuinely seems a kindred spirit to the grunts who carried out the historical carnage. Cheesy? I must admit the Zulu nation episode, which explained how these brave, dangerous men withstood and defeated an all-out British high-powered rifle invasion with only shields and spears. I must admit I was cheesin', 'cause it was the coolest story I've ever heard! Politics, diplomacy, and treaty knowledge do not apply to any of these stories. Warriors fight, and the host respectfully shows you how.",1254009600,5,704,5.527777777777778
3830101,4,B001YTOIHC,"I watched every episode of this season.  It is entertaining and can be used for educational purposes.  As host, Terry's quirky demeanor helps bring a certain endearing and down-to-earth feeling to the show even if he does get a bit repetitive and 'cheesy' at times (I counted no less than eleven times he used the word 'awesome' during one of the episodes).  It is much better than a boring narrator that typically dominates historical productions.  Furthermore, the experts used to get to the truth of these warrior cultures definitely know their stuff. Overall, I recommend this series and look forward to another season when/if they get around to it.",1249344000,9,653,4.963302752293578
3830102,4,B001YTOIHC,I have always been a history buff with an emphasis on ancient wars and warrior cultures.  This series was an insight on different warrior cultures that I wasn't even aware of.  I found it to be very entertaining and educational.,1430524800,2,228,4.675
3830103,5,B001YTOIHC,I really enjoy watching the program I wish there was a second season to watch. I learned a lot from watching and have a better understanding of these warriors,1428883200,2,158,4.482758620689655

3830105,5,B001YTOIHC,VERY good series he is a very good but goes a little overboard on some of the religious stuff,1420156800,,93,3.9473684210526314
3830106,5,B001YTOIHC,Bought this to catch up on episodes I missed.  Terry is great!  A true warrior and patriot.,1419811200,2,91,4.294117647058823
3830107,5,B001YTOIHC,The only thing wrong is there are not a 2nd & 3rd season. I spoke with Terry about this through email. He said there was a management problem in getting a 2nd season.,1418083200,,166,4.0606060606060606
3830108,4,B001YTOIHC,"SUPREME SET-BUT MISSINGThis series is absolutely the quintessential insight into many of the world's Warrior Patriots and their many cultural aspects of warfare, weapons and training.  .  .truly astounding, and fascinating to see!  !  !  The primary reason that I'm NOT giving this collection a perfect 5 Star rating, is, no matter how much the History Channel huffs, puffs and swears on a stack of Bibles.  .  .this series is absolutely not complete!
The very first Episode to air was--"" Warriors: The Heart Of A SCOTTISH Warrior "" { or, "" Warriors: BRAVEHEART "" }.  The HC also gives a very weak and non-convincing explanation of exclusive British copywrite domain; ' bull-pucky '.  I contacted Mr. Shappert personally.  He told me that he was saddened by those in charge at the HC, of not wanting to include this Awsome program,  that he had a falling out of sorts [ which probably explains why there were no subsequent Seasons ].  To us, as lovers of these stunningly produced programs,  we ultimately are the losers!
Anyway, we still have these episodes.  .  .and this Equisite missing program,  ' MAY ' be found on an internet download if you're LUCKY!

3830109,5,B001YTOIHC,"This is a great show with an even greater host.  Terry does an excellent job showing all the weapons and tactics used, but he also focuses on the specific warrior culture of each group of people.  It's great seeing someone so respectful and knowledgeable like Terry Schappert representing America.",1383436800,,297,5.040816326530612
3830110,4,B001YTOIHC,This was a History Channel production.  The host examined various warrior cultures throughout history.  It's intended for people who like military history.  It was pretty good.,1376352000,,176,5.6923076923076925
3830111,5,B001YTOIHC,"I taught a class on weapons and armor for an Integrated Projects Week at school and I used this series to show my point better.  He goes through the history of the warriors and the weapons/armor/tactics/etc and back to the history.  He switches it up when necessary and it flows so effectively.  I was enthralled by the series and if there's a season 2, I will be buying it.",1372032000,2,374,4.391304347826087
8348183,5,B001YTOIHC,"I show the Azincourt episode ""Knight Fight"" when my class reads Henry V for Shakespeare.  It gives a great overview of the battle, the weaponry, and how Henry changed medieval warfare by turning chivalry on its ear.  It's 45 minutes well spent and the kids always pay attention to it.  The host is a little extra enthusiastic (watching an archer demonstrate the longbow, he says ""Dude, awesome hangtime, bro!"") but I personally like his enthusiasm and he's believable.  I haven't watched any other episodes but this one is fantastic for anyone teaching Henry V.",1525392000,,561,4.9361702127659575
