375810,4,6301902645,Great track sequences before the age of special effects. The story line takes a back seat to the race which is the way a driver would see it and what makes this film so unique.,1504137600,,176,4.057142857142857

375835,3,6301902645,"Le Mans is a great documentary of the race, and gives you an incredible feel for what it's like to be in a vintage Le Mans prototype.

As a movie... well, it's a stretch to call it a ""plot"" so much as ""an excuse to show awesome race footage."" If you're not into watching race footage, you'll probably be bored.

The Blu-ray edition is about as good as it will get. It's not going to look like a modern film; the 35mm film stock has a lot of grain, and bolting a 35mm camera to a Le Mans prototype with late-1960s technology and then driving it around a track at 140MPH means vibration will cause a certain amount of blur. For a soundtrack of its age, the 7.1 remix is remarkably clean and crisp.",1502236800,,695,4.17910447761194

375862,3,6301902645,"This is not that bad of a movie.  It was a movie Steve McQueen wanted to do.  Sort of a labor of love.  He seems like he would have rather been a race car driver then an actor.  And at the time this was made he could do pretty much anything he wanted to.  The movie got panned and  he continued to make big movies after this.  But I don't think he ever really recovered personally.  The movie is mostly just racing footage.  And they shot a lot of it without a script.  It is not up to other McQueen movies that he had done before like The Great Escape or Bullitt.  Or things he did afterwards like The Getaway or Papillion.  But nobody did things quite like McQueen.  And I don't think anybody like James Garner, Paul Newman or Tom Cruise ever made a movie about race cars that was really all that good,",1501632000,,804,4.109677419354838

375864,2,6301902645,"This is thrill of cars with Steve McQueen. Most o this film is the grinding of engines. You can hear the track announcer and that is about it. I bought this long ago from amazon, and wondered why i didn't watch for years. If you like cars reving on the track this is for you..Otherwise, miss it at all cost. It gets an extra star to the power of Steve McQueen, however. it seem a thrill ride from the engine cockpit  and not a film with depth

It not only captured the European culture and lifestyles of racing in general, but also showed the beauty and intensity of motor racing. If you've ever raced any form of motor sports in your life, you can relate to the atmosphere of racing and being in the zone, that was clearly evident in this great movie.",1497484800,,359,4.454545454545454

375902,2,6301902645,"Let's face it, the movie sucks. Yes, we know it's all about the racing and many of the race sequences are outstanding. But a good movie requires a script that goes beyond the roar of a Porsche 917 and ""attention please, there has been an accident,"" and ""how are you?"" At least in ""Grand Prix"" there was a hopelessly dumb love triangle; in Le Mans you get a shared breakfast. Critics panned Le Mans for good reason, and while the cars are cool, everything else burns like a crashed Maserati.",1496534400,,490,4.455555555555556

The movie focuses on the 1970 race, which featured big Porsche 917s (soon to be banned) and Ferraris, Matras, Fords etc. A nice record of the golden age of endurance racing with state of the art camera work for then (no fake computer work here).

375908,4,6301902645,With very little dialogue (excepting the race announcer who basically educates us about Le Mans and the progress of the race) the story is pretty compelling.

Old cars, the king of cool, who probably only spoke maybe 75 words was just OK. I grabbed this because of all the high ratings and if that is your cup of tea and need all things McQueen, then this is for you, be warned, this is no ""Great Escape"" or ""Bullit"". Its just a famous guy, doing what he wanted to do and somehow managed to get it filmed and I paid to see it. My bad.

However, he did make many great movies but also passed up some good ones. After the awful life he had he ended up top of the heap in acting & money. Read his biography & most certainly THE LAST CHAPTER...I believe I  have the right title.

376145,5,6301902645,"Steve McQueen is my favorite actor by far.  Why?  REALISM.  Speaking of which.  Hmm - I clear my throat and begin...  Before Le Mans the film, the greatest spectacle ever filmed was the 1970 ""Woodstock"" documentary about the historic 1969 rock concert.  Just as Woodstock starts out by letting you capture the sights, sounds, almost the smells, and the MASSIVE scale of the event, Le Mans starts by showing you empty streets, roads, train stations, racetrack stands, and the magnificent track.  Next we see fans who arrived in the days before the event sleeping in tents.  Next we see a few workers repairing track rail, then thousands of security, police, and military men, trucks, and motorcycles.  Then come the waking and earlybird fans.  Then come the racing crews and the first glimpses of the most spectacularly-beautiful cars ever to roll on wheels.  Then come the racers.  The soothing British announcer and the sound of oceans of human beings gathering for an almost-sacred event put you in a state of peaceful suspense.  Like meditation.  At a half-hour before the start, the final preparations are made.  Drivers walk around their cars and speak to their crews.  The press invasively and inanely tries to get the perfect photos and quotes.  ABC cameramen walk through the busy pits, preparing for their broadcast.  With five minutes to go, the racers put on helmets and climb into their simultaneously magnificent, terrifying machines.  With a minute to go, the racers see only the starting lights and hear only their heartbeats.  At T=0, THERE'S THE MOST MONSTROUS EXPLOSION OF VOLUME IN MOVIE HISTORY as racers turn on the most powerful race car engines on the planet and set off to run their machines and themselves to the brink of, and in some cases far beyond, total destruction.  And that's just the warmup.  During the race, the cinematography and soundtrack in the movie is unmatched in the race car film genre, and probably unmatched in any genre.  Much of the footage was taken at the real Le Mans contest the prior year, and a driver lost a leg in an accident making this film.  As you watch, you understand why.  The beauty and brutality of the 24-hours of Le Mans race immersion factor is one hundred percent.  If you are a film, photography, documentary, racing, wine, or art connoisseur, and have the attention span to concentrate for two hours on every detail of this at-once grandiose and minimalist work, watch this movie.  It is profound.",1457913600,6,2469,4.872596153846154

376147,5,6301902645,"This is a movie about Le Mans, and a good one. It is not a love story, or action drama that wastes time on psychological profiling for the benefit of the weak minded. The race lasts for 24 hours. It is a test of endurance for driver, machine, and crews. Strategy by owners and managers is illustrated, but only as part of the overall story. The filming is outstanding. Weather conditions, crowd responses are included in a way that adds to the reality of the experience. In my opinion, Steve McQueen is the only actor that could portray a driver at Le Mans. Whatever opinions one may have of his character, Steve was an experienced race driver. He is well aware of the hazards in that sport and portrays the drivers accurately.",1456876800,2,727,4.515151515151516

Whether like me you are old enough for this to be nostalgia or whether this is history on the screen it's a fascinating portrayal of a time when there were very few safety considerations, for the crowds as well as the mechanics and drivers, and the cars were much simpler and raw. It takes me back to the 1970s, standing on earth banks at Brands Hatch feeling the ground vibrate under F1 or GT Cars.

We could get a bit picky: the continuity goes a bit off after the 'unfortunate incident'; the script and acting consists mainly of meaningful looks and someone deciding whether they would like a cup of coffee but these are small points compared to the action scenes and tremendous on-track and in-car filming. The sound reproduction on the BluRay is fantastic. My favourite clips were at the start where we first see and hear the 917 into and through the S de la Foret curves and in the rain watching the 917 twitching under breaking at the Mulsanne hairpin and sliding as it accelerates away; perhaps I should get out more.

Not quite the all-round entertainment of Senna and sometimes when watching I want to shout ""Get on with it"" but a solid movie to relax with; perhaps it is defined by the line ""..... and you can out-brake the Ferrari"".",1449878400,,1494,4.5055350553505535

He was easy and pleasant to get along with and that enhanced my appreciation of this movie. Le Mans is often criticized for lacking plot and dialogue by folks who do not race themselves. That merely demonstrates their ignorance of racing and what they're seeking in a movie. The plot is simply one man's experience in his and his team's efforts toward winning an extremely difficult event. His experience is impacted by continuing emotional effects of having been involved in a crash with a competitor the previous year and through encountering that driver's wife at the current event. The race itself and the race cars driven at extreme speeds both provide a huge amount of drama to a racer. Simply finishing the event in a race car still running is a great deal of drama in and of itself. The Ferrari blowing up and catching fire is representative of a few years before as safety regulations were improving. That provided some Hollywood style drama for those who don't get enough of the realistic true drama. But overall, I find it quite a good movie.",1433721600,,1163,4.678048780487805

It has some very good sequences of high-performance racing cars in their element, which is the reason for seeing this movie. Never before or since have racing cars been so graceful or visceral as in the 1970's. This film is a time capsule of that era.

Drawing on his own experience driving as a competitor in the le Mans race, Steve McQueen the actor and producer captured the feel  of racing as no one else ever has.  If you are looking for a plot, this movie has one...  sort of...  Granted the plot is a little thin.  It's just enough to entertain non racing fans who came to watch the King of Kool in his latest film.  The Hell with the plot, this movie is about Auto Racing!  If you don't know racing, this film can give you a taste of what it's like.  If you do know racing, this film will stimulate those feelings you normally feel only at the track.  Now more than 40 years old, La Mans does not feel even the least dated.  The cars are the real thing, The drivers are the real thing, and the racing is as real as you will ever see on screen.

Point is, this is one of the most outstanding race car movies ever made. That it is a Steve McQueen movie is beyond belief. What keeps it from being a five-star movie is that it has a b.s. love story in it. As a purely cars film, oh my word. Even beyond 40 years it remains outstanding ... and then consider that in the day the Porsche 917 was a very expensive, beyond the average guy, car. McQueen's 911 was sorta within reach. And then there is the fact the 917 was so dominating they outlawed it ... sorta like what happened to the Ford GT-40s.
These days the actual 917 auctions for millions ... and McQueen's 911? It auctions in multiples of what the 917 cost in the first place.

""Le Mans"" is a classic racing movie that kind of eschews plot and structure and just goes right to the races. Any of you that have any knowledge of the Porsche vs. Ferrari battles in world sports car racing in the 60s and 70s will get goosebumps and spine chills - and remember this movie forever - after they watch it. There is one LONG part with some great music that really makes you feel like you are in the car, or at the very least a fence-close spectator. The Le Mans race track is one of the most famous in the entire world, and the horrible accidents that have happened there still happen today.

376687,1,6301902645,"There is a genuinely interesting book  (A French Kiss With Death) about the making of this film that's far more compelling than the film itself. It tells the story of why, after five months of filming with twenty-five cars, forty professional drivers, a large cast and crew and the loss of the original director (John Sturgis, who quit), the finished film lacks realism, has no plot, no clear relationships between the characters, and no real reason why we should care who wins the race.

When they finished shooting they had over eighty hours of footage, out of which they came up with film a little under two hours long. But there is very little dialogue (most of the dialogue scenes were cut); no real set-up of the Porsche/Ferrari rivalry; no set-up for why this particular race is important (Porsche had never won before the 1970 race that was used as the backdrop for this film); why the course is challenging; why a twenty-four race is difficult for the drivers and the teams; how dangerous Le Mans is etc.

At crucial points in the film we have no idea how much time is left in the race, how the cars are placed or what the gaps between them are (imagine a sports film where you never know the score of the big game). At one point a car is running fourth. The next time we hear where it's placed it's leading the race but we have no idea how it got there. The end of the film is grossly unrealistic. Two cars are passed while sitting still in the pits with two laps to go but, after starting from a standstill, they make up (according to the narration) nine seconds on the cars leading them in their first lap. The last ""lap"" takes twice as long as the previous one (and uses the same part of track more than once) in a film that is supposedly dedicated to portraying racing in a realistic way. The race winners are drivers we know nothing about because they have essentially no dialogue (one has none at all) and the team manager, having won the closest race in LeMans history (based on the actual finish from 1969) can barely manage a smile. But since most of the actors playing race drivers (especially McQueen) don't seem to enjoy racing, his response is at least consistent.

Bottom line; there is some great racing footage but nothing else. If you want to see a great story about LeMans, try the first 'Truth in 24.' In that film (a documentary) we get a sense of the team work, planning, strategy, exhaustion, passion and the sheer pleasure that the drivers take in running at over 200mph (at night, in the rain). We get the sense of triumph shared by team and drivers alike in winning the race. There is none of that in 'Le Mans.'",1388448000,5,2646,4.449484536082474

Remember the movie's plot?  Apart from the chase scene, it was a completely unmemorable film, with a weak plot of sorts that kinda drifted into a few minutes of edge-of-the-seat excitement, then faded off into the end (which looked like they just got tired of it so they quit and called it good.)

That's this movie.  The driving is good.  There are two crashes of note that happen within a minute or so of each other.  That covers the high points. Plot?  Nothing to speak of.  Dialog?  Some of the foreign drivers' accents are so good you can't figure out what they're saying, but it probably doesn't matter anyway.  I watched it a few days ago, but I'd have to go back and look at the case notes to find out what this was about.  It's just not worth it to me to walk over to the living room to remind myself.

Steve McQueen was offered the lead in the 1966 film ""Grand Prix"", but the guy who delivered the offer rubbed Steve the wrong way, so he turned it down.  Bad choice!!  James Garner took the role and that turned out to be one of the greatest racing movies ever made.  McQueen decided to make ""Le Mans"" as a way to get back at them for doing it so well without him.  There are better reasons, like maybe you have rights to a story that needs to be told?  This wasn't the one.  It only looks worse by contrast.

It has a great cast that features Elga Andersen and Siegfried Rausch, excellent cinematography, music by Michel Legrand and those remarkable Porsches and Ferraris.  Besides acting, McQueen was a serious motorsport driver, participating in many professional races.

376863,5,6301902645,"Back during the cultural 60's, three of Hollywood's biggest stars made high-budget racing films:  James Garner, Grand Prix, 1966, Formula 1; Paul Newman, Winning, 1969, Indy cars; and Steve McQeen, Le Mans, 1971, sports prototypes.  As a young man I saw the all of them at the theater and have seen them many times since.  In my opinion, Le Mans is the best of these three great films and the best racing movie ever made.  I also think it survives better than its competition in terms of appeal to modern viewers.

The plotlines of all three were criticized as being thin, even as it was acknowledged that any plot at all was just there to distinguish the film from a pure documentary.  The plotline of Le Mans is the thinest of all, but the most tastefully done.  Perhaps because it was the last made, McQeen had gained insight from the other two when he went to make his.  There is a poignancy to it that renders a perfect compliment to the main component, the incredibly realistic and exciting racing action.  Elga Anderson as the love interest is breathtakingly beautiful.  McQueen is at his best, and all the rest of the players are more than competent in their limited roles.

I would point out that Garner, Newman, and McQueen were, by all accounts, accomplished racing drivers in real-life.  That said, no actor could have nailed it like the ""King of Cool,"" Steve McQueen.  And that's saying something up against the likes of Jim and Paul, no slouches themselves when it came to cool.

My only regret is that Steve didn't get this movie done a few years before so that my beloved Ford GT40 could have co-starred with him.  That would have been the ulitimate!

376910,1,6301902645,"LE MANS is the first and only STEVE MCQUEEN film that I did not like. It is a disappointment on so many levels. I know McQueen spent years trying to get a racing movie into production and finally it was time for LE MANS. I have read that the production of LE MANS was chaos from the beginning. A lot of egos were crushed, friendships and marriages destroyed. The end result was not worth all the trauma.

Unless you are a diehard NASCAR or Formula 1 racing fan, there is not much to this film. I would guess 3/4 of the film is just scenes of cars racing. Dialogue is at a minimum and it was 40 minutes into the film before there was and real dialogue. For 40 minutes, we are treated to scenes of cars racing, spectactors mulling around, racers getting in and out of their cars, more cars racing and more people walking around. McQueen wanted the film to be in documentary style and it is except for the total lack of explanation about what is going on - exactly what is this race? What are the rules of competition? Lastly, what exactly is going on.

Steve McQueen was an avid racing fan so I can imagine how much fun it was for him to be in a race. Special effects were not the rage when LE MANS was filmed, so the filmmakers had to use a lot of ingenuity in camera placement and set-up. Countless cameras were set up along the race track and attached to cars to get a realistic look inside the cars and the views from the drivers' perspective.

Here is where the film totally falls apart. There is no real story here. We knew McQueen's character had been involved in a tragic car crash the year before where a fellow racer was killed. The racer's widow shows up for this year's race..always looking seriously at McQueen but having little to say.

The viewer needs a story and a better understanding of what is actually happening in the race. It looks like the racers are following a course that goes around the track and through the local countryside. We see the same billboards and buildings over and over again. There are a few staged crashes in slow motion, but my understanding is that much of what we see is just the actual car race--over and over and over.

LE MANS is one of McQueen's many famous and beloved films. I am sorry that this film is disappointing on so many levels. I wish I could have learned something about the racing scene beyond seeing race cars whiz down the street. The bonus feature narrated by Steve McQueen's son Chad was worth the time to get into the backstory of the movie and how it was filmed and to get some idea on the race.

Most of the racing sequences are taken from a camera mounted in a car that was racing at the time. At one point in the filming the car used to film the movie had a very real chance of winning the race but it was decided by the team their goal was to make the movie and not win the race. The cars are beautiful, the sound causes the heart to pound a little faster, and the drama of the race still sucks me in no matter how many times I watch it.

Not happy to ding this flick since I'm a fan of McQueen, but this static monstrosity can only be liked by hardcore F1 aficionados.

What truly stunned me was it was nearly 40 minutes before I even knew who was who - I mean the filmmakers don't even identify characters or explain their relationships to one another. Plus, I honestly could *not* believe that you had to listen to the public address announcer, who was in essence, laying out the story. Probably one the most idiotic things I have ever experienced in film.

Worse yet, that critical information so vitally important in understanding the plot, is played in the background, jumbled in and amongst the other ambient audio tracks.

Stunning. In the same way that most of MTV's moronic reality programming could be considered 'amazing'.

I will say that the final ten minutes of the movie was exciting, if viewed from a somewhat coldly distant perspective, given the lack of our involvement in either the characters or superficial screenplay.

Now finally, it is in Blu-ray.

I, of course, have the VHS, the DVD version of this movie. (ha-ha... don't you have one of each, too?)

The picture is still quite grainy at times on the stock section, and we can always make out a real scene from live, actual race than from the movie. Just by looking at the ride height of the 917s. They are Lolas T-70s, right?

You and I know that we can count the number of words uttered by the few actors, but who needs them?

The blue Ferrari 330 GTC is simply gorgeous.

The real gain is in the sound department. The surround sound adds to the realism. Aren't we all addicted to those high shreiking 10,000 plus rpm engine songs? It sends chill down my spine.

But ... this is about the car ...  42 years old.  I submit this is the greatest racing car ever ... in it's final 917/30 iteration, it raced, won and qualified with the following performance stats.  0-62 mph (100km/h) in 1.9 sec., 0-100 mph (160km/h) in 3.9 sec., 0-200 mph (320km/h)in 10.9 sec. and on up to a top speed in excess of 260 mph (420/km/h).  The engine was a flat 12 cyl air cooled 5.374 liter, twin turbo design.  at full boost, (""a simply astonishing 39 psi"") it produced 1580 bhp for qualifying and raced at 1100 bhp. It came to the US and dominated the CanAm unlimited series, causing McLaren to go home.  In 1975 Mark Donohue took it around Talladega Super Speedway in Alabama with a closed course, land speed record of 221.160 mph, a record that went unbroken for 4 years.  This car could probably qualify for and win Indy against the current cars, qualify for and win any Nascar race including the SuperSpeedway restricter races and the road courses, beat all of the above in the quarter mile, go 300 plus mph at Bonneville and keep on, keepin on above 200 mph for 24 hours with only different tires and gear set for the Salt Flats.

376967,5,6301902645,"I and many others have written about the movie itself, but I'll just say a few words about the new BluRay DVD I just received yesterday.

Simpley put: well worth the money but a couple of odd results to mention.

For a very long time the only copy of this movie I had was a VHS tape I got off a cable channel that had used a horrible print. But I was one of few in country with a copy since no retail VHS was available.

Then, after several years of lawyers fighting, a VHS tape came out and I immediately buought it. But, sadly, it was still not great but better than the one I had. Then, after several more years a DVD came out and I bought it not that long ago (in comparison) and it was much better, especially using an upconverter DVD player and an HD tv.

With that said, I was very happy right off the bat with the BluRay. How one can tell is easy and done within the 1st minute or so when watching the intro section of the movie where McQueen drives his 911 to the track. This has always, photogenically/technically, been lackluster and always looked
""soft"". Much, much better now but still looks a bit soft in sections compared to modern films.

I have come to the conclusion that the film crew/director were pushing the limits of film/light and as a result there is a fair amount of what we called back in the 60s/70s in the photo business ""grain"".  Some scenes suffer more than others. They'll be a slightly soft scene followed by a much better, sharper scene, like when he's thinking back on the crash the previous year. But BluRay really is great on close up pit and racing scenes and now a viewer can see the wrinkles in the side number ""circles"" on McQueen's 917.

Also, this was first time I played LeMans after installing a fiber optic audio cable in my soundbar. Great! Fiber optic cable is worth the money.
I got a GE one for $16.00 bucks at WalMart. Radio Shack wanted $39 for one.

The odd result with BluRay. The sky shimmers in the prerace scenes. Almost looks like rain. The sky is grainy and BluRay makes it stand out. But only really noticable in early scenes where there's a lot of sky. It looks like they were filming with an overcast and low light conditions. Remember, this is a film using 60s technology.

It is worth the not-so-cheap (as my wife said) cost. My wife also knows I own a DVD of the movie (as well as Grand Prix which I also ordered in BluRay).",1310774400,2,2389,4.279379157427938

376995,5,6301902645,"Being an owner through the years of 3 previously available versions (Beta; LaserDisc; DVD) of this film, the primary question whenever a Blu-ray edition is announced of a catalog title produced 40 years ago, is whether the upgrade is worth investing in one more time.  All too often has been the case during the early adoption phase of any new format, the answer at best, is maybe.  Improved but due to the source materials and/or mastering methods used, perhaps not fully utilizing the capabilities available with the new technology during any expected learning curve.

While my media center isn't what one would consider esoteric, it is for most purposes a capable and representative home theater environment for many featuring a 65"" Panasonic plasma display (custom settings but not fully calibrated), Pioneer Elite A/V receiver outputting to a matched JBL 7.1 speaker system about a year technologically obsolete this date.

Being a long time Porsche automotive enthusiast, a fan of both Steve McQueen and the 24 Hours of Le Mans motor race, I have certainly enjoyed multiple viewings of this film through the years and quite familiar with it both visually and sonically from beginning to end.  There are multiple reviews available on different websites so with rare exception, the comments I express here will be limited to my personal opinions of CBS/Paramount's effort with this new offering.

Right on schedule, my new Blu-ray copies of Le Mans and Grand Prix arrived in the mail together as these two films were once again, ""connected at the hip"" as they have been through the decades.  For the less than $18 you can acquire this Blu-ray from Amazon during its initial release period, my title for this post says it all:  ""Don't hesitate, it's Magnifique!""

One expects an improved image on Blu-ray but I was stunned at how cinematically the final image was.  There is almost a perfect level of visual grain from beginning to end that creates what is so missing in many of today's CGI based motion pictures.  The look of film!  Special effects were all done in camera and look absolutely real in 1080P high definition.  The colors are rich and vibrant even considering the conditions the 1 million original feet of film was shot using now, 4 decade old techniques.  Flesh tones are spot on with Blacks deep and rich though there is occasional clipping during some of the night time scenes.  The Gulf Blue on the Porsches are dead accurate having seen the actual 917's at their namesake's museum in Zuffenhausen.

The clarity in some shots are truly amazing in the level of detail shown and even exposing close ups (06:23) that were originally shot with the camera's zoom lens I suspect, unintentionally mis-set at its starting rack focus point.  What some have described as ""soft.""  As many times as I have seen this film, the greatly enhanced picture (at times, video bandwidth indicating 30-33 mbs+ output) allowed me to see unexpectedly, background detail that had escaped notice during my many previous viewings such as the Black paint flaking off the right windshield pillar in Delaney's Porsche (24:21) or the exposed rivets/screws in same location on the Ferrari 512's (23:23).  Racecars are typically well worn devices and seeing detailing such as this adds greatly to the realism the film is attempting to create.

I also noticed for the very first time, B&W portraits of both Michael Delaney (McQueen at 59.28) and his main rival driving for Ferrari in the story, Erich Stahler (Siegfried Rauch at 1:00:24) hanging on the walls (Michael to the right of the sliding entry door; Erich's to the left of where Michael sits with Lisa) of the cafeteria where McQueen has about as much dialog as there is in any one section of the entire film. If CBS/Paramount used compression, it was very slight and one never sees any halo edge effects.  They allowed the transfer to breathe and the visuals certain confirm that.

As impressive as the visual transfer is short of a full frame by frame restoration which means there were occasional scratches in the final print though few and far between, the new lossless 7.1 audio mix is its equal.  The panning from one side of the room to the other (as well as rear to front) matching the cars going right to left on the screen was truly immersive during the driving sequences.  While I wasn't expecting my subwoofer to be exercised anywhere close to Tron:  Legacy, very pleasantly surprised whenever LFE was used.  For someone that used to clean out record grooves with liquids and brushes before playing to minimize background noise (ticks, pops) while maximizing available dynamic range, two sections of the film truly validates the life like audio free from recording hiss offered here even when sourced from older analog masters.  The first takes place at the start of the race from 25:54 when Michael closes the rear window in his 917 and one hears the rhythm of a beating heart increasing in rate until the flag is dropped to start the race (28:00).  The second is a repeat of this same sonic theme after the Ferrari 512 crashes off the race course with the driver attempting to escape the pending explosion (1:08:10-1:08:47).  With the noise floor so low, listen for the very subtle atmospherics throughout these and many other scenes which in a 7.1 system absolutely helps to create a sound field that has great width and depth completely enveloping the viewer. Consider it 3D for your ears and extremely effective.  Overall, for the era this film came from, CBS/Paramount did an excellent and highly effective remix.

In the end, what most amazed me during my nearly two hours watching Le Mans again, was how completely and unexpectedly I had been pulled back into this racing spectacle during my viewing.  The clarity of an updated Blu-ray worthy transfer, a new 7.1 lossless soundtrack, the perceived shortcomings from a lack of any dialog beyond the PA announcer in the background all contributed to producing for me, Steve McQueen's vision for his film:  The physical and emotional experience of actually participating as a driver in the 24 Hours of Le Mans from the comfort of one's own neighborhood (home?) theater.

376999,5,6301902645,"Filmed during the 1970 24 Hours of Le Mans (24 Heures du Mans) this, in my opinion, is the finest racing movie yet made. No CGI here, the filming is incredible, and you forget you are watching a movie, its more of a documentary. Steve McQueen was a racing enthusiast. He raced cars and motorcycles, concentrating on endurance racing. He raced in the 1970 12 Hours of Sebring, a race early in the season that teams use to prepare for Le Mans. McQueen and his racing partner Peter Revson, in McQueen's V8 powered Porsche almost won Sebring. It took Mario Andretti borrowing a V12 Ferrari ( his car he had been leading the race had broke down), to beat McQueen at the end of the race by only 22 seconds. McQueen impressed everyone especially since he was racing with a broken left foot and a cast on! Many think that McQueen would have won with a car that was more competitive against the V12 Ferrari Andretti used to win. That experience shows at Le Mans, a race that is not only about speed, its about endurance as Ferrari and Porsche battle to win the world's most prestigious car race. My late father took me to this movie when I was a wide eyed second grader. It was an experience I have never forgot. If you are into racing, Le Mans is a must see.

377029,5,6301902645,This is the story of race driver Steve McQueen coming back to LeMans after a crash (shunt) the previous year where another driver was killed. Film shows the preparation it takes to put on a race and the physical and emotional toll on drivers (and wives/girlfriends) when the race is won or lost. Extremely good race footage and some spectacular crashes caught on film. McQueen meets the wife of the driver that was killed and you can see from the interaction the pain that racing has caused.

This film is Steve McQueen's homage to the greatest sports car race of them all - the 24 hours of Le Mans. You can view this film in one of two ways. As a quasi-documentary it can be considered as one of the greatest racing films of all times - second only to 'Grand Prix'. The Porsche 917, one of the greatest racing cars ever built, is the real star of this film. The film does an excellent job of capturing the atmosphere of the real Le Mans circa 1970.

377063,5,6301902645,"""Le Mans"" is, as so many reviewers before me have suggested, a true, tried, and tested classic. The story of a racecar driver, played by the great Steve McQueen, who returns to participate in a race in which he was involved in a major accident the year before, is a simple one. Not many words are spoken and few plotlines are brought into play. Yet the film has more expression and more passion than the best and biggest of dramas. We get to explore the character and soul of the racing driver, get to see and feel the tension and concentration of the race.

Although the acting is somewhat 'simple', for lack of better words, the visual side of the film is overwhelmingly well thought out. The direction and camerawork is, at least in my opinion, very convincing. The actual driving, the epicenter of the film, is extremely good. In fact it is so good and, perhaps more pertinently, dangerous, that I believe we shant see the likes of it ever again on film (unless, of course, it will be as computerized special effects).

""Le Mans"" is, however, not first and foremost a visual, but a visceral experience. The sound of the film is nothing, if not fantastic. The roaring engines, the absence of music, the roaring engines. Oh, and the cars sound very nice too. The feeling that the film doesn't favour this or that aspect of the racing experience. No 'fake' tension is built up. We sit there as casual observers to a truly magnificent event, listening, watching, experiencing all that is Le Mans.

I guess if you're not a petrolhead or are unusually empathic and creative, you'd probably think the pacing of the film a bit slow. If you, however, like a bit of speed and or sports (or drink petrol for breakfast) this film was made for you.",1223337600,,1739,4.5673076923076925

377069,5,6301902645,"So many have already praised this movie and rightfully so. It is a remarkable film. Dedicated to the reality of racing, stripped of vehicles like standard plot lines, or contrived love affairs, this is a movie just about racing. It is a cinematographic masterpiece.

Rather than continue to gush praise for this film, I'll try to add a little background that may help other appreciate the lesser known aspects of the movie. This film attempts to capture reality in a pure unadulterated way. While a few sections and crashes were staged. The majority of the film was shot during the 1970 Le Mans 24hrs itself. The movie features the actual cars running the race itself.

The camera car used to film the 1970 Le Mans 24hrs was a Porsche 908 ( a beautiful race vehicle if ever there was one). It ran the race as an unofficial entry, and it was loaded with heavy cameras. Driven by Porsche's Herbert Linge and Jonathan Williams, it travelled 282 laps (3,798 km) and finished the race on 9th position. That's pretty great for a camera car! It would have done better, but it did not cover the required minimum distance due to long stops to change film reels. Your average race car at Le Mans tries to minimize pit stops. The camera car was burdened by cameras, controls, and mounts, AND it had to stop for lengthy changes of film. 9th place. A Porsche 908 running with Porsche 917s and Ferrari 512s. I give those drivers and that car some real credit.  The footage shot by the camera car is remarkable. The sequences during the early dawn hours that capture a Ferrari 512 passing the camera car are chillingly beautiful.

The stand-in cars used for the crash sequences were real race cars, Lola T70's,  modified to look like Porsche 917s and Ferrari 512s.  The Lolas were used because they were less expensive to wreck than would have been  the cost of sacrificing a real 917.

If you have an appreciation of racing and history's most beautiful race cars, this movie will not disappoint you. True to the famous quote from the film - racing is life, everything before and after is just waiting. This film is like that - there is the race, and then the scenes in between - which really are about waiting. They may seem slow to american audiences, but this is not really an american film. It is much more a european film, and it possesses a unique pace that is not for everyone, and is not even understood by everyone, but is valid and artistically correct for the existential meditation that this movie truly is.",1210982400,2,2504,4.586129753914989
377070,5,6301902645,"Nearly 40 years since its release, Le Mans remains the best racing film ever made, because the focus is on the cars and course of the greatest endurance event in motor sports.

When it was made in the early 70s this was a great effort at making the best racing movie ever.  If I were rating it then I would have given it a 4 or a 5.  The annoying sound track, the silly and poorly developed side story about the fellow racer's widow and the lack of updated surround sound for the race sequences limits this movies appeal when viewed today.

Where the movie still succeeds is capturing the feel of a great racing venue on race day.  If you have never been to a race you might not beleive all the layers that exist around the event.  I think the movie also captures the interactions between drivers and teams without the theatrics of some later movies (think Days of Thunder).",1201478400,2,863,4.251533742331288
377074,3,6301902645,"If you are looking at ""Le Mans,"" you already know at least something about the film.  The star of this film is really the race course itself, and in fact, this film works almost more as a documentary than a film.  The cinematography is fine, though I say that with hesitation because much of the film was actually shot in documentary mode, with cameras (big, old-school film cameras, not the little digital ones used for TV coverage today) mounted on one car during the race in 1971.  Other scenes were shot after the race on different stretches of the race course.  As for the writing, well that went on before, during, and after the race, and the director changed at least once before Katzin.

Having said all of that, the real kudos go to the film editors, who took these various parts and made a true homage to the race and to the middle of the Golden Years of LeMans.  The 917K and the 512 are two of the most beautiful machines designed for racing ever, IMHO, and seeing them in action is wonderful.  The overhead shots take in all of the spectacle that is LeMans.  And, of course, there is the stunt driving.  No CGI in this film, and it shows.  Take the most realistic car crashes from a modern film, and compare it with these -- not even close in comparison.

Having said all of that, the DVD only rates three stars.  If I did not like the film so much, I would give it one star.  Come on, Paramount, we racing fans waited a few years for this DVD, and all we get is cleaned up sound and film?  The so-called ""special features"" on this DVD are (according to the back of the case) ""widescreen enhanced for 16:9 TV's,"" ""English subtitles,"" and ""Dolby Digital 5.1 sound.""  If you want French, you only get mono sound.  THIS IS RIDICULOUS!  As I hinted at above, there is a whole story behind the making of this film which rates only slightly behind the making of ""Blade Runner"" in terms of drama.  No documentary about that?  You could even be lazy and include the fine documentary with McQueen's son!  No trailers?  Features about the race, the history of the cars, the rivalry between Porsche and Ferrari, NOTHING?  The film is great, and this is the only DVD, but Paramount and CBS home video owe us, the fans of this film, much better than this minimalist effort.  I would gladly pay three times as much for a well-produced DVD with extras worthy of this film, this race, and this era in racing history.  Don't even thing about offering this on Blu-Ray in this same state...",1200873600,,2484,4.432671081677705
377075,3,6301902645,"Make no mistake about it, Steve McQueen was one of the finest actors of his generation with such landmark films that resonate like an elegy in the cinema canon: ""The Great Escape,"" ""Bullitt,"" ""The Thomas Crown Affair"" etc. These films defined the strong male characterizations that are lacking in today's films with male characters more at home in a metrosexual guise than the potent aura of control McQueen exudes on screen.

This then leaves us with the question of ""Le Mans"" produced by McQueen's own company, Solar Productions. The film begs the question: is it a documentary about professional auto racing?  Or, is it a drama about the emotional and personal toll auto racing takes on the participants who drive at 240+ miles per hour where one mistake can make the difference not only between victory and defeat on the track, but also life and death? Then again, should ""Le Mans"" be seen as merely a vanity project for McQueen who sought to indulge his passion for racing (the actor himself, like Paul Newman, was a professional racer)on the screen?

McQueen's film tries valiantly to answer these questions, but really only succeeds in the first.  The cinematography and direction is superb for a racing film, but where ""Le Mans"" comes up short is in drama.  There is very little dialogue or interaction between the characters.  Katzin's direction on the track and from the driver's point-of-view is excellent; the crashes have a gut-wrenching intensity to make even the bravest of us wince, and the director, thru the extensive use of close-ups and slow motion in some segments, cannot be faulted in this category.

The interchange between Delaney (McQueen) and the widow of the man Delaney was invloved in a fatal accident with seems stilted and forced even though the characters are apparently drawn to each other. Katzin tries to have the characters speak not so much with words but with body language and eyes, but this is not very convincing. The discussion prompted by the widow as to why these men are compelled to race is never really satisfactory addressed and lacks the gravitas a scene like this should have.  What we have are snippets of dialogue that resemble a series of bad takes in what is otherwise a documentary film about professional auto racing.

For racing purists, the film is a delight; McQueen fans will see yet another dimension of this multi-faceted actor in a very different type of movie.  I purchased my DVD at Rite-Aid for only $6.99 rather than the list price indicated here at Amazon.",1200009600,,2525,4.878504672897196

If you are a man and you you aren't interested in fast cars you are probably either 1) not of the majority's sexual orientation or 2) from a part of the World where they don't have them (Moomba maboday jambaa car?).

""Le Mans"" is, for most of the film, more like a documentary than fiction. You will feel like you are watching the actual race rather than a fictionalized story set around the race. REALISM is the word.

McQueen plays an American driver, Michael Delaney, on the Porsche team whose main rival in the twenty-four hour race is a German on the Ferrari team. Delaney is haunted by the memory of a crash that killed an Italian driver the year before.

There isn't much dialogue in the film. One notable quotation occurs after the widow of the Italian driver asks McQueen's character why driving is worth the risk: ""A lot of people go through life doing things badly. Racing is important to men who do it well. When you're racing, it is life. Anything that happens before or after is just waiting.""

It's taken more than 30 years, but Americans are finally beginning to appreciate what Europeans and ardent racing enthusiasts around the world have known since they first viewed LeMans: it's an excellent motor racing film.  This emerging realization is due to several things, I think. One is that over the past three decades, even the densest moviegoers have had to recognize McQueen's disdain for dialog in ALL of his films. Unlike actors who lobby to have additional lines written for their characters, McQueen preferred to act through gestures, expressions and body language. He was all about presence, and Michael Delaney exudes all the presence of Frank Bullitt and Thomas Crown.  Another reason for the growing respect for LeMans the movie is the comparative shallowness of the charade that passes for motor racing today.  LeMans was shot on the cusp of the corporatization of the sport. It was well on its way from a gentleman's pursuit, that train had left the station in the mid-1960s, but the earnings of world-class drivers when LeMans was made were still comparable with CEO, rather than rock-star compensation. Importantly,  it still took huge balls and a lot of ability to drive a car like the Porsche 917 the length of a 3.5 mile straightaway at 240 mph, at night, in the rain, like Vic Elford did in 1970.  Mulsanne has long since been shortened, the number of co-drivers on a single LeMans team has grown from two to your average college fraternity, and drivers need to bring a lot less to the game in terms of guts and skill than they did in 1970. LeMans is not without its blemishes, and by all accounts it was a nightmare of a project, but McQueen delivered what he said he would - a film that did justice to race drivers and racing.",1178755200,3,1851,4.718266253869969

377107,4,6301902645,"""Le Mans"" is Steve McQueen's homage to the famous French 24 hour auto endurance race.  The storyline features McQueen in a nicely understated performance as a racer returning to competition at Le Mans one year after a nearly fatal accident, one in which a close friend was killed.  The movie follows his intense competition with an old rival on the track, and his slowly blossoming relationship off the track with the widow of his close friend.

Much of the movie is given over to an almost loving examination of all the sights and sounds of Le Mans and of the racers and the fans it attracts.  Michel LeGrand's score nicely supports the fast/slow pacing of the movie on and off the track.  The racing scenes are well done, using a variety of camera angles and lighting effects.  The race is hard to follow during a rainy night in the middle of the competition.  The racers are often hard to distinguish from one another in their helmets and protective gear.

The movie has a number of highlights.  One is an accident on the track that threatens to take McQueen prematurely out of the competition.  A second moment, of almost pitch-perfect clarity, is McQueen's explanation to the widow of why men race automobiles.  A third is the tense conclusion of the race itself.

This movie is highly recommended to fans of endurance autoracing and of Steve McQueen.",1174608000,,1356,4.723404255319149

Steve McQueen had this film made after kicking himself for 5 years for turning down the opportunity to star in the far-superior, GRAND PRIX. His friend John Frankenheimer designed GRAND PRIX with McQueen in mind, but McQueen was quirky and didn't always pick the best properties to star in. So he turned thumbs-down to GRAND PRIX, James Garner got the lead, GRAND PRIX went on to earn three Oscars and worldwide fans, and McQueen felt like a fool for passing it up.

With a multi-picture production deal set up at a fledgling studio (CINEMA CENTER FILMS) he had his own answer to GRAND PRIX made, only they got a hack director, and forgot to write a screenplay.

As a film on its own, LE MANS was just another one of McQueen cache of flops.

Watch it just for the car racing sequences alone, without judgment, and you'll probably like it, although it comes nowhere near the visual and aural excitement to be found most other films that cover the same subject matter.",1153353600,11,1142,4.695
377141,5,6301902645,"Little needs to be said about this movie aside from what I state in the title.  This film is loved by racing fans, mostly, for if you're not into the spectacle of auto racing, there's little here for you.  Perhaps we all would've been better served if Mr. McQueen had merely made a documentary film!  As it is, the racing scenes dominate the show and the off-track action can't hope to keep up with the adrenaline rush of the brutally fast machinery.  If I may steal a phrase, Mr. McQueen's acting can best be described as ""wooden""...  Not that McQueen can't act, mind you, but the character he plays is quiet and withdrawn.  Hard to spice up the character much unless you put him behind the wheel, in which case he is a man possessed.

Le Mans is much like the earlier movie ""Grand Prix"" in that the real stars are the stupendous racing machines that populate the film (though McQueen WAS originally slated to star in GP).  The storyline is timid and occasionally embarassing to watch, but McQueen makes a good show of it.  It doesn't hurt at all that he himself was at the wheel for many sequences, which adds authenticity to the picture.  McQueen was a very competitive (and successful) prototype and sports car racer and his passion for racing is what propped up this film throughout its difficult gestation.

The cinematography and the sound are top-notch, especially considering the fact that the movie is now 35yrs old.  If you are a fan of the olde racing cars, fire up the subwoofer and enjoy.  It won't disappoint.  With the possible exception of ""Grand Prix"", this is as good as it gets when it comes to racing cars on screen...  The authenticity is not 100% but it's certainly 99%.  Watch this movie, and you'll see why race fan-types pooh-pooh the hackneyed ""racing"" films ""Days of Thunder"" and ""Driven"" (*bleccch*!!), both of which steal liberally from ""Le Mans"" and ""Grand Prix"" but don't even come close to getting it right.

Some of the more recent reviews here have some comical errors of fact, so I'll try to set a few things straight (I'm talking to YOU, P. Lombardi):

-The Ferrari 512BB is a ROAD car, not a car that raced Le Mans in 1970 (when this movie was filmed) or 1971.  The Le Mans racers of  this era are the 512S, 512F, and 512M.

-The top speed at Le Mans in 1971 was NOT 291mph, nor was it EVER 291mph.  You're high by about 50mph for the '71 race.

-The battle ""royal"" between the Ferrari 512 and Porsche 917 did not run from '69-71.  There was no Ferrari 512 in '69, and the 917s didn't even FINISH that year.  The '69 race was won by a Ford GT40, and the second place car was a Porsche 908.

-If you're going to quote the movie's most quotable line, at least get it right, man!  It's:  ""Racing is life. Anything that happens before or after is just waiting"".

As for J.J. Lewis' review below, ""Le Mans"" is NOT about ""Formula One racing""...  Presumably just about everyone who reads this knows that ""Le Mans"" stars ""endurance"" racing cars, which are quite different from Formula 1 cars.  As such, the movie does NOT ""shows how stark and brutal F1 racing is"".  It does, however, show how stark and brutal endurance and Le Mans Prototype racing is.",1153267200,3,3182,4.49912739965096
377142,5,6301902645,"The Porsche 917 was the greatest...and many drivers say the scariest... LeMans prototype ever made. Top speed on the Mulsane straight in 1971 was 291 mph. The 1971 winning car still holds the 24 hour distance record...3317 miles!!!! and it held the total laps record until today 6-18-2006 of 379 laps.

The happy news for all of us is that the brilliant chaps that made this movie had the inspiration to capture the essence of the 917 vs Ferrari 512 battle royal raging at LeMans in '69 '70 '71. This was the first movie I saw in a theatre that made the seats vibrate where you could literally feel the raw power of the 5 litre 12 cylinder machines.

The essence of the LeMans event is captured as well. The ultimate and constant danger of the race is part of the allure of LeMans...a 24 hour event in which anything can happen at any second and there are 86,400 seconds to race. One of the great dangers, overtaking slower cars in the 917 at a closing rate of over 150 mph, is captured brilliantly when McQueen has an incident with a 911...one sleepy second and disaster.

When asked by the love interest why he must get into the other team Porsche when asked/told by the team...McQueen delivers a line that has been a mantra in racing circles since

I'm actually a filmmaker and I have a hard time figuring out how they incorporated documentary footage of the actual race so well with the ""re-created"" footage shot with the narrative in mind.  There is minimal dialoge which is refreshing - forcing you to watch the movie like you'd spectate a racing event - yet the narrative information is there in abundance on screen.  It's even more amazing to realize that McQeen had nearly won Watkins Glen right before this race and was planning on contesting it but the bond company forbade it in case he crashed and they couldn't finish  the movie.  Also turns out that this was the 'classic' year of Lemans, for soon afterwards they changed the course, and put restrictions on the cars because they went too fast.  if you like McQeen, cars, porsches, ferraris, and auto racing in general - this is a must-see - you'll love this film.

Yet, visually it has a quixotic and very dynamic approach to its documentary style of filming and subject matter, which is the allure and fascination for the majority of viewers.

Le Mans would serve well as a stylistic blueprint for other filmmakers. The recent Sylvester Stallone film ""Driven"" is an example of how most directors butcher the racing genre.

The racing footage is spectacular...forget the computerized specials effects of today. This is as real and solid as it gets. I felt a part of being in a Porsche 917 or a Ferrari 512 while accelerating to 200+ MPH.
This is one movie I was happy to spend money on...you can keep the ""Fast N' Furious"" for the kids.",1079913600,4,866,4.818791946308725
377203,5,6301902645,"I'll keep it short and sweet - Le Mans is the best motor racing movie ever, and the DVD looks absolutely superb, with a terrific widescreen print that showcases the stunning cars of the era (the most exciting cars ever built in my humble opinion). In particular, the first 8-10 minutes of the race is a master class in motor sport cinematography and editing. On the first lap we are able to marvel at the sights, and incredible sounds, of the mighty Porsche 917's  and Ferrari 512's dueling, and then, as lap two begins, Michael Legrand's outstanding, upbeat and funky-ish orchestral score kicks in, helping propel the race footage to further levels of excitement. I could go on, but I won't. Buy this essential DVD.",1077580800,8,716,4.728
377204,4,6301902645,"The single line that's necessary to understand this film -- if you don't have an instinctive understanding from the moment you hear the engines beginning to rev -- is McQueen's response to ""Why do you do it?"".
He says (and i'm afraid i have to paraphrase a bit here) ""That out there, that's living.  Everything else is just waiting.""
And that's the truth; for some people, living on the edge -- whatever it may be the edge of -- is the only time they feel truly alive.
The great British driver Stirling Moss's biography is entitled ""Everything But my Life"".  Graham Hill, after retiring and taking a job as a commentator was asked if he missed racing.  He replied along the lines of ""Twenty-four hours out of most days, I don't miss it at all.  But when those engines start up -- I miss it more than anything.""
McQueen's film catches this attitude well -- these are men with an obsession, a need to get out there and push themselves and their vehicles to the limits, and beyond.
(Limits?  Another Graham Hill story -- he took a car out for practice at the Nurburgring.  It was impossible for the car's suspension to allow its belly to touch the roadway.  He came back with all the paint rubbed off the bottom of the car.
(A car magazine decided to see how different drivers approached their art; they fitted a gran prix car up with full instrumentation and sent three different drivers out to run hot laps on the same race course.  As expected, the profiles of all three varied, some were faster on one corner, some on another -- but two of the three touched the car's theoretical absolute limits in acceleration or cornering force at several points on the lap.  The third exceeded them several times...)
If you want a RACING MOVIE -- one that gives equal emphasis to the ""Racing"" and the ""Movie"" part, this isn't it -- try ""Winning"" (with Paul Newman), which i believe Amazon is/was offering as a two-fer with this film.
If you want a racing MOVIE -- one that's first a Movie and secondly a racing sory (albeit with incredible racing sequences) try ""Gran Prix"", with James Garner.
But if you want a RACING movie -- one that understand swhat and why racing is and lays it all out there, this is it.
Some Other Random Comments: One review mentions McQueen driving a race with his ankle in a cast -- it wasn't in this film, it was either Sebring or Daytona, and he only barely lost to Mario Andretti who was determined not to lose to ""an actor"".
Almost all of the cars in this film -- including the Porsche which meets such a horrific end on the Armco -- were actual factory cars from the previous season, which were pretty much obsolete in the new season, and which the factory donated/sold cheap to the production company.
Except for the Ferraris -- Enzo read the script, said ""A Porsche wins?  No Ferraris!""  The ""Ferraris"" which McQueen and crew took great pleasure in destroying are actually replica bodies on old Lola chassises.
Another review mentions that the tires on the Porsche can be seen spinning as it bounces off the Armco in slo-mo, and says that this is beacuse the accelerator had been jammed open to cause it to crash more spectacularly.  From what i heard at the time, the car was first smashed into the Armco under radio control at a speed approaching 200MPH; after it bounced off, a stutn driver got into it, strapped himself solidly in, and gunned it up to sixty or more MPH, hitting the barrier again at a sharp angle which resulted in several more bounces.  The tires are burning because it was wide open to enable him to do more elaborate spins and crashes.  (They cover up the cut between the RC crash and the controlled crash in the slo-mo sequence by one of the cutaways to McQueen's face as he relives the crash after everything comes to a halt...)

377215,4,6301902645,"Sure, this film is not Citizen Kane or anything, but it is really quite good.  I guess people tend to write it off because it is a ""racing movie"".  It does have a simple plot and, as many others have pointed out,  minimal dialogue.  But this film says a lot in a subtle way -- something you never see in movies today.
The late 60's/early 70's were such a great time for cars and racing, and this movie captures the essence of that period in motorsports.  Actually the cars themselves would not look out of place at all today.  But this was a long time ago -- before NASCAR ;-) -- and these cars were not so high-tech as they might look.  Racing was far more dangerous then than it is now; drivers were getting killed all the time as I recall (I was 14 when ""Le Mans"" was released).  ""Le Mans"" really makes you feel what it must have been like to be a racer back then.  It is a study of contrast between dull, quiet ""real life"" outside the race and the vitality, urgency and danger of competition that motivates the drivers.
""Le Mans"" is one of the only two good auto racing movies that were ever made.  (The other is Grand Prix, which is unfortunately not yet available on DVD.)  It is a completely visual movie -- you MUST see the DVD version in widescreen format, with its superior video/audio quality; way too much is lost in the VHS version.  The action footage is truly incredible, especially when one considers that this was 1971.  If you like cars/racing and movies, ""Le Mans"" should be in your collection.",1070496000,13,1513,4.360714285714286

377217,4,6301902645,"Le Mans is a great racing movie that focuses on the actual race while also including a thin love story behind the racing sequences.  The race is a 24 hour endurance challenge for drivers on an 8.5 mile course.  The story in the movie is about Michael Delaney, an American driver returning to the race for the first time after being involved in a crash that injured himself and killed another driver.  Returning to the race, Delaney finds himself drawn to the widow of the driver killed in the race whether it be so that he can explain himself and what happened or just that he is attracted to himself.  The thin love story plays second fiddle to the actual race.  The racing sequences take up much of the movie as the drivers battle themselves, each other, the cars, and also the weather.  All of the crash sequences are very well put together.  Done in slow motion, you want to look away, but can't.  It reminded me a lot of The Wild Bunch with something so horrible going on yet you cannot look away.
  Steve McQueen stars as Michael Delaney, the racer returning to Le Mans.  He gives another great performance even though he lets his driving do most of the talking.  McQueen does not even speak until 40 minutes into the movie.  What impresses me is that he did most of his own driving on the course hurtling along at well over 200 miles per hour.  Siegfried Rauch plays Erich Stahler, Delaney's main opponent battling for the title.  He doesn't say much but the respect between the two men is very evident.  Elga Anderson stars as Lisa Belgetti, the widow Delaney is attracted to.  She does not have a big part, but what is there is very good.  The DVD does not offer any extras, but the widescreen presentation looks great compared to the VHS release and the sound is incredible, especially in the racing scenes.  Racing fans will love this movie even with the thin love story put behind the race story.  Fans of McQueen and racing will love this classic!",1060300800,,1960,4.498583569405099

Whoever was reponsible for the film to DVD conversion created a masterpiece. I don't know how they derived the DD 5.1 (reg trademark) (perhaps they set up mic trees and re-recorded from the original theater suround sound?)
Video bit-rates are super high so all the racing action scenes are super clear and brilliant. All and all a technical masterpiece. A really nice gift for your high-end home theater system.

The cars are the stars, the PA system with its irregular English update provides the commentary, and the drivers are the hired bit players.
Anyone who bags this film does not understand the tension and drama of most dangerous motor race in the world, and shouldn't be reviewing the film. Most dangerous motor race in the world? Nudging 400 kph at night in a rainstorm is dangerous!
The dialogue is sparse, and so it should be: the racing engine whose deep bellow rises to a crescendo, the tortured tyres that screech at every misguided change in direction and the chilling sound of shattering fibreglass, perspex and composite alloys tell the viewer what is really happening.
How real is this film?  The camera car, which is seen in at least one scene entering the pit straight, came ninth outright. One of the drivers lost his leg during a practice shunt that is caught on film. There are fudges in the filming; note when MacQueen destoys his car the back wheels are still spinning long after the Porsche has bounced off a few armco fences. The accelerator was wedged open to prolong the crash.

377234,4,6301902645,"I have reviewed this movie here already so I'll talk only about the DVD.  First, the video transfer is gorgeous!  Even though this movie is more than 30 years old, the colors are spectacular.  Either the DVD was made from a fresh print, or there was something done to the enhance the colors, but either way the film looks FABULOUS.  It actually looks better than many contemporary movies released on DVD.  Second, don't be misled by other reviews of this DVD--the soundtrack is not Dolby Surround (which is two channels of audio enhanced to three) but full Dolby Digital 5.1.  My only gripe here is that there is too much use of the center speaker.  This is only a small gripe, however.  If you have a 5.1 sound system, this movie sounds great CRANKED up.  The music is fresh and clear, and the roaring of that Porsche flat 12 gave me goose pimples.  As my other review mentioned, I saw this movie 7 times in the theater as a teenager, and I have watched it countless times on VHS tape since that was finally released.  I was surprised to find that watching it in widescreen (and it is quite wide) on a 53"" 16x9 television is a whole new experience.  The sensation of speed is much greater, and the beauty of the cinematography really stands out.  Many of the shots are just plain ruined on the tape version.  It really is a different experience on DVD.  Finally, there are no extras whatsoever on this DVD, and that is a shame because there are several outstanding documentaries on Steve McQueen and on the filming of ""Le Mans.""

377236,4,6301902645,"OK, how many of you are reading this review and will see this film because of its great dramatic reputation?  Not many, I suppose.  Le Mans is perhaps the truest film for pure racing, and racing fans.  Along with Grand Prix, its perhaps one of the best films about racing ever done.  There's very little dialog, and half of that is silly.  There's a small attempt to add some drama, and this is put into context by the fact that Steve McQueen walks out on the girl to go back to the race....
McQueen plays an American driving for the Gulf Porsche team.  His great rival is a German who drives for Ferrari, and evidently there was some drama between the two at the Nurburgring during a previous race.  McQueen was also involved in a fatal accident the previous year, and its strongly implied he had a relationship with the driver's widow.  She hangs around the pits of Le Mans almost like the angel of death, actually, until some attempt is made to insert romance in her relationship with McQueen.
The dialog is sparse, which is probably just as well;  if you see this film, watch it for the racing.  No other film captures the speed and drama of real racing as well as Le Mans.  Much of the footage came directly from the race and was perfectly edited into the film:  it all plays smoothly.  The rest of the footage was shot with real cars and real drivers at real speed, and it shows.  The result is almost a documentary on Le Mans.
There's a famous quote from former driver and sometime commentator Sam Posey.  He was asked what was the fastest he's ever driven, and he replied that it was around 235mph on the Mulsanne straight at Le Mans (formerly the longest straight in motorsports) driving a Porsche 917.  The person comments on the speed of the car, and Posey says that he really wasn't sure exactly how fast the car was - it was still accelerating at the end of the straight!  The point is that this film captures a good part of the awe and drama of the speed of the place.  For anybody who loves racing, its not to be missed.
As to the DVD, the print has some small dirt specks and a little noise occasionally but is otherwise pretty good:  the picture is nice and sharp, and color is quite good.  The Dolby 5.1 soundtrack is perhaps one of the best remastering jobs on a 70's era film I've seen.  Its not up to modern standards but its still really good.
So...  3 stars for the silly drama, 4 stars for the print and 5 stars for the racing.  I'm guessing if your idea of racing is a bunch of loud cars going around in circles this isn't the film for you, but if you love it, this is an experience you'll enjoy and won't readily forget!",1051747200,25,2646,4.3117408906882595

LeMans is really just about racing.  Having been to the LeMans three times, I can confidently say he captured the on-track commotion and spectacle very well - even including the ferris-wheel across from the tire-bridge.

This priceless montage of the deep rumble of Ford 8-liter V8's, the bark of the Ferrari and Porsche 5-liter 12-cylinder engines, or the raspy howl of the Ferrari, Matra, and Alfa Romeo 3-liter prototype engines is a must-have.
Some footage was staged, but most was filmed during the actual race in 1971, when a sunny afternoon gave way to horrible rain, as if conspiring with the director to try to make something for a plot.

I feel that the reason for this is that the star of the movie, Steve McQueen (as American race driver Michael Delaney), understood professional motorsport very well. McQueen competed in several international sports car events, notably the 1970 Sebring 12 hours, prior to the start of this project.
Critics have taken the movie to task for it's dark feeling; it's true that most scenes in the movie at least hint at the constant danger inherent in the most violent of the remaining ""blood sports"". However, I feel that it's the thoughtful way that the danger is acknowledged is what makes this film particularly interesting. One only has to look to the opening scene where Delaney (McQueen) visits the spot on the famous Mulsanne straight where he was involved in an accident in the prior years running of the famous 24 hours race that claimed the life of a rival. Not a word is spoken in this scene, but the viewer knows what happened, and the agony that Delaney feels having been involved in the fatal crash.
It is ironic that the film is largely based on events that happened in the 1970 LeMans 24 hours sports car endurance race. 1970 will forever be noted in the record books as the fastest and most dangerous running of this famous race. Due to changes in the layout of the course, emasculating the famous Mulsanne straight (due to safety concerns), and due to changes in specification of the race cars themselves, it is likely that Vic Elford's 242.685 km/h qualifying lap and race record lap of 241.235 km/h will never be eclipsed. It is to be noted that in recent years the winner of the event has completed more miles (in the 2000 event more than 5000 km were completed by the winner), but this is due to rain causing a dramatic slowing of the field in 1970.
Speaking of rain- there is an interesting scene in the first hour of the movie where the Porsche and Ferrari team managers are faced with losing the lead by calling their drivers in for rain tyres. Who would blink first- you could cut the tension shown on screen with a knife. Finally a minor accident on the course convinces both team managers that they must bring their drivers into the pits to avoid disaster.
Even if you aren't a racing fan, you owe it to yourself to witness the breathtaking ""first person"" driving scenes and the thrilling in-car shots. The story of how this spectacular photography was achieved is the subject of a recent book ""A French Kiss With Death"" which I would strongly suggest that students of cinematography and the curious take the time to read.
Overall, the movie ""LeMans"" is more about the human drama that is endurance sports car racing, than the race that the movie takes its name from. Enthusiasts will thrill in seeing the vintage racing footage and the ""staged"" shots taken not only at the circuit, but during the race itself (in full 35mm Panavision). But everyone can appreciate the emotion, irony and drama that is shown to the viewer by the talented cast.",1034035200,4,3093,4.677064220183486
377263,5,6301902645,"This is a great racing movie but not necessarily a great movie movie. You could write the dialogue on the inside of a match book and the plot is as thin as a McDonald's burger but that's not the point, is it. This movie is about Steve, Porsches, Ferraris and speed. The movie reeks of '70's movie clichs - long close ups, quiet looks between actors, stop action / freeze frame crashes. But some how it all works. The action scenes are why you watch this flick and if you love cars, this is the movie for you. Your non-car friends will yawn through this one (mine do) but on a rainy winter day, when LeMans is still months away and your Porsche is under the cover in the garage, this is one film that will recharge your batteries until the frost is off the pumpkin.",1030147200,2,764,4.239726027397261
377277,5,6301902645,"This film provides a graphic example of a wonderful niche movie designed for, with, and by racing enthusiasts against the better sense of Hollywood types who were looking for something more formulaic and bankable. As drama or story, this film falters badly, for the plot is loosely threaded together more as an afterthought (or an excuse) for the real story behind the sequences; the race at LeMans. Steve McQueen used all of his star power and considerable charm to get this film made, but he did so not for reason of profit or gain, but because he wanted to spend the time, energy and money to race at LeMans, and the film gave him the excuse to do so.
This much said, the racing sequences are both authentic and spectacular, and one learns much about the men who race as well as the women who follow them. It gets alot of its credibility from the fact that McQueen did actually drive the car in the sequences, and that most of the drivers featured were the actual participants in the race. So throughout the 24 hour enduro, which is what Lemans is really all about, we get a very graphic notion of what it means to race and to risk everything on the performance of your senses and the machine you are driving at speeds exceeding 200 miles an hour. In this sense the movie is a terrific documentary, one that did not do well at the box office, say, compared to ""Grand Prix"", another terrific racing movie which was about formula drivers starring a young James Garner, Yves Montand, and Eva Marie Saint.
Yet, in the final analysis,  this movie seems less contrived, more immediate, and much more about racing than any of the others I have seen. This is an interesting if flawed drama, but an intriguing look at the whole subculture of professional racing, done by someone who lived, breathed and ate from the cup of such stuff.

The film is timeless and the racing sequences are as exciting today as they were then, considering the technology of the time. The cars, too, speak volumes of that particular era of racing, when the sport was still a sport and not the technology it is today, where he with the most money usually wins.
Over a million feet of film were shot during the actual race (a 24-hour endurance marathon that familiar names such as Foyt and Andretti have won), but Hollywood was concerned that, despite Steve McQueen's desire to film the consummate racing movie, there was no script. Indeed, the semblance of a romance thrown in is thin, but again, at least for the purists, the racing sequences make up for the lack of a solid, well-defined plot.

377281,5,6301902645,"Not only is this one of the greatest car races, it just happens to be filmed durning the most important climax in Porcshe automotive history.

Porsche had been working on winning the World Championship and had been focusing on making the ulimate race car. The 908s just did not have what it takes against the big Ford GT40s, but when the rules changes to 5 liters - Porsche had been working on the 917 which would rule over the next couple of years.

Steve McQueen was at the right place at the right time. He was heavily into racing and was about to race in the Le Mans in a Porsche 908. He had just finished the 12hrs at Seabring, in second place - just barely losing to Mario Andretti in the Ferrari 512, which was meant to compete with the 917. Steve shocked the motor world with his placing in Seabring. He was not the typical actor to race driver - it was more the other way around.

That year (1970) the film company refused to let him race again, even though LeMans was his dream.

But most amazingly, Steve did what no other person had done before. The movie of LeMans has some actual footage of the 1970 LeMans race, as well as the real drivers.

Steve had a Porsche 908 entered in the race with a front and rear film cameras mounted onto the car. It was an officail race entry. What is even more amazing the 908 camera car finished 8th overall - it had completed the race, while having to make twice as many stops to reload film.

After filming 24hrs of car footage from the race - almost all in car. Steve had to rap a movie around it. He kept it a pure race movie. The whole movie is the race, except for 10 minutes in the begining. Other then the GT40 of Jackie Ickx beating the 908 of Hermann in 1969 by a matter of seconds, only does the movie Le Mans have an equally exciting finish.

I have seen several Le Mans Races on TV and video and I actually went last year to see the Audis take it again (2001), but except for the 1999 LeMans (Mercedes flipping) the movie Le Mans captures the excitment and a bit of important history.
This movie could also be called GULF 917 vs Ferrari 512!

If you are a Porsche fan, a sports car history buff, Le Mans fan, or just like car racing - this is it.

(If you are into auto racing - specially the pinicle years of 69 - 73 check out the movie ""The Speed Merchants"" it is hosted by Mario and Elford - it covers the 72 Sports Car Championship, and has LeMans, Targa Florio, Seabring and more - more of a documentary. Also check out these books: ""French Kiss of Death"", ""917 the winning years"", and ""The Unfair Advantage"".

377286,4,6301902645,"For the true race car enthusiast, LeMans, after more than 30 years remains the most realistic racing movie ever made. Steve McQueen was a true sports car enthusiast and a racer himself, and he hired director John Frankenheimer to film him (Steve) in the world's most important sports car race -The 24 Hours of LeMans. Real factory race cars from Porsche and Ferrari were used to make the movie, and cameras were mounted in the cars during the race for much of the movie footage. The action was real, the crowds, the location.
The only thing lacking was a story, an afterthought hastily written after the movie was halfway through production. But still, much better than the scripts in more recent films like ""Days of Thunder"" and ""Driven"" where we are led to believe an inexperienced rookie (Tom Cruise) and a washed-up has been (Sly Stalone) can roll onto a race track without practice, break the track records, stick quarters to their tires at 160 mph, start CART race cars without starters and race through downtown Chicago at night without lights  and not draw the attention of police, and then go out and beat the established champs in the race the next day.
Another old movie like LeMans, ""Grand Prix"" with James Garner was good. Real tracks like Monaco, real drivers in the background scenes, but the cars were mocked-up Formula 3 cars -not Formula 1, and you could tell. Get LeMans, and get Steve McQueen's ""Bullet"" for the epic streets of San Frabncisco car chase scene, one of the best chase scene ever (now only recently relegated to 2nd place by the chase scene in ""Ronan"").",1010361600,,1586,4.725631768953068

The tech inspection that they had to go through was much more stringent than any of the other entries. The camera had to be encased in the body of the car. Totally enclosed, which meant that the body panels had to come off to change the camera.
They finished FITH overall! An amazing accomplishment.
After the race, the production had engaged the roads (these are public roads) to do pickups and flesh out the story. The wreck that they duplicate is one of the scariest ever filmed, MacQueen's flashback of the crash is brilliant.

Despite the media branding 'Le Mans' as a 'flop' to me it represents the spirit behind the man, his desires, his passion, his frustrations and ultimately and insight into the soul of the real Seve McQueen.
True the story line is weak with Steve playing 'Michael Delaney' a loner whos having survived a serious accident the year before which killed his friend and now having to come to terms with confronting his widow is a backdrop in terms of the real thrust of the film which is an action filled semi documentary of the 1970 Le Mans 24 Hour race.
The cars are evocative with Porche 917's, my favourite the Lola T70 and many other period cars which raise the blood pressure.

The cars are spectacular on the track (remember when cars had more power than grip?).  For non-fans, the sketchy backstories of the characters probably are barely adequate.  It's taken several viewings for me to even develop theories about the relationship between McQueen's character and The Woman--he reminds me of David Bowman in ""2001,"" and The Woman just seems to *be there* (however, I can name several women in the racing community who parallel her story).  The characters are so stoic, it's hard to imagine that they are sufficiently excited about auto racing to justify the risks.

A feature of Le Mans (the event) that really helps this movie is that the race has driver changes, which allows the characters to interact and reflect during the event.

Watch this movie for the breath-taking drama that develops in the pictures, since in racing a picture says definitely more than a 1000 words. The camera work is outstanding, and the story is built in a very detail-minded, documentary-type style that matches the coolness of McQueens persona. We see his charcter develop almost entirely in his actions, in the powerful flashback to an accident a year ago that he reflects upon as he returns to the same scene on the same track. As he drives to the track, stops his Porsche at the scene of the accident and stares back into the past, we begin to understand what kind of a racer he is .We see the quiet, yet passionate rivalry between him and his major competitor for the title in the Le Mans 24 hour race and we see his equally quiet interaction with the widow of the fellow driver who perished in that fateful accident. While personal interactions are very subdued, the true passion erupts on the race-track and this movie  is superb in this regard.

377318,5,6301902645,"You know, for nearly thirty years now I've had this dirty little secret - that I truly love this film.  Trashed by pencil-necked critics at the time of its initial release or condemned with ""faint"" praise by others  who ""wanted more of a story line"" (!?!?), I don't think its ever  received its due.  If its a complicated tale of moral ambiguity you seek -  put on ""The Wild Bunch.""  If you're a car person, though, and the  sounds and sights of Porsche 917s and Ferrari 512s howling down the Mulsane  Straight flat out in excess of 240 MPH doesn't move you - well, check your  pulse!!!  I typically throw this in the VCR at some point around mid-Winter  and stare out to my garage where my 911 sits all covered and hibernating.  And, if I close my eyes and listen to the soundtrack, well........",936057600,,796,4.413793103448276
377319,5,6301902645,"This film probably sparked my life-long love affair with motor sports.  This is a movie about an bygone era when auto racing still was, as Steve McQueen puts it, ""a professional blood sport.""
The minimal  subplot is almost disposable.  It has something to do with a rivalry  between McQueen and another driver, both romantic and on the track.
The  heart of this movie is the racing scenes.  Porsche 917's and Ferrari 512's  racing wheel to wheel, their howling turbocharged 12-cylinder engineers  propelling them down the straights at up to 240mph, sometimes demolishing  themselves in a slow motion ballet of carnage.  While fictional, this film  gives you more of a feel for what it must have really been like than  watching the real race live on TV did for me this year.
I have only one  complaint.  It's not out on DVD yet!",930614400,7,827,4.732394366197183
377320,5,6301902645,"This movie is a closet masterpiece, Grand Prix was good, but too soap opraish at times. The sound of the 917 howling down the Mulsanne is worth the price alone. Real race car driver David Piper lost his leg during the  course of shooting the film.",923011200,,247,4.369565217391305
377321,5,6301902645,"This movie has it all. This movie does a better job than Gran Prix in revealing the true roller coaster of emotions that a driver goes through as he fights fatique and mechanical complications during one of the most  grueling endurance races on earth. Steve McQueen's character is complex,  and only Steve could have pulled this one off (for only Steve at the time  was as well reknowned in the acting business as a first class auto racer).  Only Gran Prix one ups this film, simply from the complexity of portraying  an entire season, vice an entire race.",916617600,,556,4.63265306122449
