2415872,4,B000BGH240,"I saw this flick a couple weeks back.  I love comedies such as ""10 things I Hate about You"" and ""American Pie"", so when I heard about Dirty Deeds I was like ""my kind-a-movie, got to see it"".

personally, i think Dirty Deeds falls right in line with these other good films.

when Zach, (Milo Ventimiglia) decides to prove to his entire school he is no fool, he takes on the biggest challenge of all...  becoming the first student to complete the ""10 Dirty Deeds""... an extreme series of challenges. Zack only has12 hours to complete them, between dusk and dawn on the Friday night of Homecoming weekend. But like all teen movie he is doing it the name of love, he takes on the deeds to protect his younger brother of the girl of his dreams.

You know all the good stuff which makes this movie a hit. Trust me on I was on the floor laughing my  a** off.",1138320000,4,851,4.254658385093168
2415873,5,B000BGH240,"Oh my god, I watched this movie with my boyfriend the other night.  We're both really old now, but this movie reminded both of us of all the pranks that we used to play on people when we were in high school.  It brought back such good memories.  I think that everyone can relate to this movie in one way or another, because we've all done stupid things in high school.  Not to mention pressured into doing them in the first place.  And this movie highlights every single one.

Oh, and you know that I can't leave a review on here without mention Milo Ventimiglia.  That boy is hot!  I was a huge fan of his when I he was on the Gilmore Girls.  But he looks hotter in this movie though.",1138320000,,685,4.128787878787879
2415874,4,B000BGH240,"I must agree with the other reviewers.  Dirty Deeds is a fun filled comedy that reminded me of movies such as Can't Hardly Wait and National Lampoon's Van Wilder. Some of the ""deeds"" they came up with were hilarious. This movie has a great cast of upcoming actors. Lacy Chabert and Milo Ventimiglia do a great job carrying the movie and I'm sure we'll be seeing more of them in the future.

Great looking cast! Lacy Chabert is especially nice to watch.  It is definately one of those films in your collection that you can watch again and again.",1137974400,,544,4.474747474747475
2415875,5,B000BGH240,"One of the funniest movies I've seen in a while. There are a lot of hilarious moments throughout the jokes, and some great running gags surrounding the characters as well.

Basically the story involves a bunch of teenagers, where the main character (Milo Ventimiglia from ""The Gilmore girls"") tries to become the first ever to complete a series of ""Dirty Deeds"" within 12 hours during the homecoming weekend. The movie gives a American Pie-like vibe with its raunchy humor, and the stupidity of some of the characters.

Overall it's a great comedy to watch for to get a good laugh out of. Definitely worth checking out if you're enjoy the raunchy humor types of movies.",1137974400,,669,4.808695652173913
2415876,4,B000BGH240,"Dirty Deeds definitely falls into the catagory of movies that are just flat out amusement. it's definitely worth watching if you're looking for a good laugh. It obviously falls into the teen comedy genre, with like American Pie and Road Trip style movies.

 It's got Milo Ventimiglia from Gilmore Girls in it, and for most girls that's enough reason to watch it, at least once. He's definitely not his Gilmore Girls character. He plays a geeky type, but totally lovable as he tries to complete the 10 Dirty Deeds in twelve hours! It's completely nuts and turns into a wild night.

If you like hilarious teen comedy's, you'll love this movie.",1137542400,,641,4.756756756756757
2415877,5,B000BGH240,"This is a great comedy that reminded me of movies such as Can't Hardly Wait and Van Wilder. I am some what of a sucker for those teen films.  Some of the ""deeds"" they came up with were hilarious. Kept me laughing all the way through.

This movie has a great cast of upcoming actors. Lacy Chabert and Milo Ventimiglia do a great job carrying the movie and I'm sure we'll be seeing more of them in the future.  Plus, Lacy is great looking, so that doesn't hurt.",1137110400,2,459,4.193181818181818
2415878,4,B000BGH240,"When this movie was in theaters, I remember driving for almost an hour to the nearest theater playing it, and there was a total of 6 people in the entire theater to watch the movie.  Now this might sound like this movie is horrible, but that is not the case.  Sure it is stereotypical of most teen-comedy romps: bad acting, predictible script, etc.  But the movie also has a lot of good times, and a lot of heart.  I remember actually caring about the main characters in the film (something that doesn't happen often in a Teen Movie)...

Basically without me going on a tangent... if your looking for that stupid/yet somehow good late fridaynight movie, this is it...",1136937600,9,667,4.571428571428571

2415910,1,B000BGH240,This movie doesn't even play on DVD or even Bluray players. DON'T waste your time buying it,1405987200,,91,4.411764705882353
2415911,2,B000BGH240,"I got this film because I was presenting a seminar with the assistant director, and felt I needed to see it. She was in charge of the young women in bikinis (and less) in the ""UNRATED"" parts of this truly dull film about completing a secret list of stupid pranks (like getting the bra from a varsity cheerleader) for no understandable purpose.",1392336000,,343,4.548387096774194
2415912,3,B000BGH240,Typical teen movie. Kindof cheesy in parts and there's alot of outrageousness that you would not normally see in real-life. However it was entertaining and you pretty much get what you expect.,1339372800,,192,5.03125
2415913,3,B000BGH240,"In my copy of the rated version, there's about a ten or fifteen second period in which there is no audio (dead silence) in the surround sound track.  The sound was fine on the two-channel track.  I thought for a moment my Blu-Ray player might have a firmware bug, but I pulled the disc and tried it in my laptop with identical results.

Given that the playback did not stutter in any way (and my computer's DVD drive didn't show any bad block errors), I suspect that this is not just a single bad disc, but rather an bad pressing run.  I'd be curious if anyone has a copy of the rated version in which the surround sound actually works.

The moral of the story is that if you want surround sound, buy the *unrated* version.",1333152000,,723,4.286764705882353
2415914,5,B000BGH240,This movie was awesome but what was even better is the main character has the same name as me :P Zachary Harper so its kind of weird everytime they say his name in the movie.,1208649600,,174,4.0
2415915,2,B000BGH240,"Dirty Deeds is one of those movies that you sit through saying to yourself, ""this is idiotic"", but instead of abandoning it midway through you find yourself still sitting through it until the credits begin to roll.

It's silly. It's a teenager movie. It's been done a million times before in Hollywood (most of the time poorly). Dirty Deeds is one of the sub-par high-schoolers-making-mischief-attempts where if you're perusing cable late one night--and can't find anything else on your 500 channels--is maybe worth a stop if you're determined to watch TV instead of just going to bed.

But who knows...you might be seeing the beginning of some great careers! Just look what 1980's teeneager movie Hollywood Knights launched for the likes of Michelle Pfeiffer, Tony Danza, Robert Wuhl and Fran Drescher. Everybody's got to start somewhere, right?",1159142400,,846,5.1678832116788325
2415916,1,B000BGH240,"Milo Ventimiglia (Gilmore Girls, The Bedford Diaries) stars as Zack Harper, a kid who helps out his friend Kyle who is in a bit of a rut. Kyle was challenged by a senior to do the Dirty Deeds. The Dirty Deeds (there's 10 of them) are just random things on a piece of paper the person has to accomplish. There's also a record that has never been beating before. So, Milo sets out to do the Dirty Deeds and there's also a party being thrown at a house where they keep a scoreboard of how many Milo has done. Not Another Teen Movie!! Just had to say that but its bascially what it is. In American Pie you had Jason Biggs doing the pie and in this, well Milo Ventimigla enters a bag of whole wheat bread (if you know what I mean). Milo helps the film but nothing is special about this movie. More moronic characters. My advice is watch it (Unrated or not) once and the decisions are up to you. Also starring Lacey Chabert (Not Another Teen Movie, Mean Girls) of course, Mark Derwin (One Life To Live, Heist), Zoe Saldana (Drumline, Pirates of the Caribbean), Panso Gorson (South of Nowhere, Dear Wendy), Billy L. Sullivan (My Life, Little Big League), Ray Santiago (Meet The Fockers, Pinero), Todd Zeile (King of Queens, SNL), Michael Milhoan (American Gun, Pearl Harbor), Erin Torpey (Crescendo, One Life To Live), Arielle Kebbel (Aquamarine, Be Cool), Dave Power (Frailty, Boston Public) and Charles Durning (The Final Countdown, Rescue Me) for some odd reason that I don't know why. What does the Unrated version have to offer? Female Nudity what else?!!",1148169600,2,1553,4.589928057553957
2415917,2,B000BGH240,"watching this film i felt i had seen it before . it follows the same teen movie cleshays that we know so well offering nothing new for this type of movie . saying that i've seen worse and fans of teen comedys will probable find it entertaining for the most part . the main reason i got this was that the talented Lacey Chabert is in it . acting in the type of film that she made fun of in not another teen movie . lacey does her best with the material and what little screen time she has but she is not aloud to show her true comic potenshal as she was in films like mean girls .

in my opinion this film is not bad it's just very avarge .

thank you for reading my review .",1142726400,3,674,3.841726618705036
2415918,1,B000BGH240,"I'm actually really shocked that the reviews for this have been so good. I don't know... maybe when I was a teenager I would have found the jokes in DIRTY DEEDS funny, but not anymore. Although, I laughed at AMERICAN PIE (the first one) and that was pretty sophmoric? Not sure. So, I finally came to the conclusion that DIRTY DEEDS... JUST WASN'T FUNNY.

The concept in Dirty Deeds is a pretty decent one. The school has a secret list of dirty deeds hidden and very few have attempted to, or have completed all of them in one night. And when they do complete all 10 deeds, they get to add another for the next to take the challenge. The deeds range from... punching the toughest guy in the school, bringing a dead guy from the morgue to the school, drinking a beer in front of a cop... etc. etc. etc.

But the concept was wasted with poor writing, sophmoric sense of humor and a weak attempt to capitalize off the success of all the other teenager having sex comedies that have come rolling out of the gate ever since Hollywood figured out that teenagers are making up a very large percent of the Movie theatre revenue intake.

Yet, the jokes in DIRTY DEEDS never really exceed stuff that made me laugh when I was ten. Somebody getting punched real hard, masterbation, or somebody farting... and of course... as the title of my review suggests... of course it has the American Pie ripoff jokes. In American Pie... the character ""does it"" with a pie... in Dirty Deeds... it's a loaf of wheat bread... and of course the jerk principal buys the loaf and eats it... wondering what the white... yeah... I won't elaborate.

And then there's the hot girls like Lacey Chabert, Arielle Kebbel and Zoe Saldana! I like them all. They're all very pretty. They do nothing. In fact... all three of them may as well have been credited as cameos because they weren't in it much. Lacey Chabert is in it the most, but her character is VERY VERY SERIOUS and apprently not into having FUN and it comes across. She has no jokes at all. Zoe Saldana has a very very very tiny role and Arielle Kebbel has a small role in which she makes out with some dork freshman because he had the balls to talk to a senior.

I've had it folks. I have it with the RIPOFFS and the sequels and the remakes and the lack of originality. The writers need to take some time and make sure the laughs deliver. The studios need to stop greenlighting things that aren't ready, just so they can catch the tail end of a dieing trend.

DIRTY DEEDS is a bad movie that could have been better if the makers would have had a more original goal in mind, instead they chose to CONFORM, rush into production and it went straight to the video shelves.",1139184000,6,2693,4.397590361445783

Sam Neill plays a corrupt cop in a smaller role but I'm always glad to see him in any movie.
Lots of blood and violence.
Great Aussie gangster movie.

If you like this one, check out ""Two Hands"" starring Heath Ledger and Bryan Brown.",1427587200,,350,4.303030303030303
