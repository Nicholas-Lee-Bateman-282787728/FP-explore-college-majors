7971836,4,B00006LPCA,"For an old movie that if you come across it, you're probably only paying a couple of bucks for, it's quite an entertaining movie in its own right.  If however you're paying top dollar to track one down online because you loved the Richard Stark, Parker adventure novel, then I'd highly recommend not doing that.  This Slayground other than there being a closer run down theme park in it at one stage, has nothing much else to do with the great different to every other Parker adventure novel, where Parker sort of emulates Rambo with just four bullets and a couple of knives from the giftshop inside a boarded up theme park, where a heap of bad guys want to kill him for the money he stole from an armored car.  Even Home Alone was closer to that novel than this movie is.

But if you watch it and can forget about the fact you were hoping for a movie version of the novel, this isn't that bad a low budget with its own storyline with a very dated early 80's look movie.  It has the cheesiness and unique look and acting style to that era, such as a while trying to be scary villain that isn't terrifying at all style of a hit man that hides in the shadows (I think he might have even referred to himself as The Shadow Man or something like that at one stage), who taunts his victims and laughs while easily killing them.  We've also got mannequins inside cars and things that are supposed to be dead bodies.  It's a supposed to be thriller that has overtime become a comedy, even though it didn't mean to be at the time.  I mean the hitchhiking scene, who wouldn't enjoy that?

The basic plot of this movie revolves around two criminals (one named Stone who is supposed to I guess by Parker but looks and acts nothing like that character), have arrived in a small town where they are supposed to be met by a third member who is to be their getaway driver for an armored car heist that for some reason is driving down dirty roads into what looks like a quarry.  Of course as we've already seen, this guy isn't going to turn up, so Parker (I mean Stone) doesn't follow his usual rule of abandoning a caper if everything isn't going to plan and lets the other guy talk him into using an unknown to him kid (who Stone refers to as a punk) to be the getaway driver.  The robbery goes according to plan but of course the punk kid full of adrenaline and trying to be cool ignores pleas to slow down and sideswipes an expensive car.  An ice-skater little girl is killed in the crash, she has a rich father who wants vengeance and is prepared to pay whatever amount of money is needed to a hit-man to get it.  Soon the hit-man is in the punk kid's garage (how he knew he was one of those involved is never explained, I mean even if he knew from a paint analysis or something the car involved, how did he not know this wasn't just a mechanic?).  The punk's corpse ends up in a car wash after he's given up the names of the two who hired him.

As I said it's not a bad film.  It's very dated but if you don't mind films that are I think you'll enjoy this. It does a domestic violence scene where Stone's girlfriend isn't listening to him so he grabs her face and squeezes her mouth and this seems to be perfectly acceptable to both of them which was unfortunately acceptable in relationships back in that era.  But it does also have some witty dialogue like Terry (Mel Smith) when confronted by a rich guy with an intimidating thug, calls the thug the rich guy's dog, the thug attacks him, he easily punches the thug in the stomach bringing him to his knees and Terry remarks, ""you're dog fell over"".  It's one of those films where every fiberglass statue in an amusement park looks creepy rather than fun.  If you come across it, definitely check it out, but just be aware it has very little in common with the Richard Stark novel.  Although apparently Westlake (Richard Stark) had something to do with writing this movie's storyline.  So basically you can look at this as another Westlake book that was never published turned into a movie.

Slayground the novel was brilliant, I do hope that one day someone makes a movie of that which actually follows the plot.",1473033600,,4154,4.326030927835052

7971840,4,B00006LPCA,"I'm a superfan of the Parker novels by Donald E. Westlake, which he wrote under the alias Richard Stark.  Superfan meaning I don't just ""like"" the books, I LOVE them and reread them many times over.  I will say straight off this adaptation of the Parker novel Slayground is not very much like the book it's based on.  And Stone, the character that is based on Parker, is a much more humane version of the Parker us fans all know and love.

The plot veers wildly from the novel after the armored car heist (which was well done).  For many Westlake fans, that spelled doom for the film right there.

But I think it's still an artfully and very well done crime film in it's own right.  Stone and crew accidentally kill a young girl on the road after the heist.  Actually, the idiot getaway driver is at fault, as Stone clearly tells him to slow down, which the driver ignores.  This causes the wealthy father of the young girl to hire a really bizarre and almost superhuman hitman who is somewhat reminiscent of the old pulp character The Shadow.  He just pops up out of nowhere, kills you, then disappears without a trace.

The hitman manages to get two of the crew, but not Stone.  Stone gets shot and injured, but eventually escapes to England, to find an old partner in crime whom he thinks can help.

The scenes that are most like the book are at the end, where Stone and the shadowy hitman go mano a mano in an English amusement park that's been shut down for the season.

So: if you go into this expecting a straight-up adaptation of the book, you'll be disappointed.  It's almost like an alternate universe Parker story where the main character shares some of the qualities of the Parker us fans know and love, but has some differences as well.  Readers of DC comics and it's different versions of their characters, like Batman of Earth-1, Earth-2, Earth-3, etc. will know exactly what I'm talking about here.

The direction, script, cinematography, score, etc., are all very good.  The acting is excellent except for maybe the hitman, who comes across almost a little too omniscient and bizarre at times. Coyote is very engaging as Stone, a decent criminal who isn't looking to hurt anyone, just live through this adventure.  But he'll prove much harder to kill than his co-heisters and will show the creepy assassin he can be quite deadly when he needs to be himself.

Aside from the atrocious Made in USA, this is the Parker film considered the worst of the bunch.  Mainly because it deviates from the story it's based on more than any other Parker film (again, except Made in USA).

But I liked it quite a bit, and if you pop it into your DVD player with an open mind, you may too.",1359590400,,2690,4.503092783505155
7971841,2,B00006LPCA,"The SLAYGROUND of this picture is a not-so-amusing Blackpool, England funhouse.

SYNOPSIS--
A wealthy vengeance-seeking man sets a behatted assassin upon Coyote after the getaway car he was a passenger in collides with another vehicle and the man's daughter is killed.

Peter (as the rather vague 'Stone'), who has shrapnel in his spine from a previous injury that may soon leave him a paraplegic, goes to England in search of old friend Terry Abbatt (Smith). He and Abbatt's girlfriend visit his buddy's grave, yet Stone refuses to believe the man is dead. Turns out he's right-- Terry shows himself but is soon croaked for real by the hitman, who's followed Stone from America.

A a noise-filled but tedious climax in the shadowy fun house follows. The killer maniacally cackles in a ""you can't hit me"" way as Stone takes wild shots aimed at his voice. The screen blurs briefly in an attempt at psychotic nightmareism, but all this filmic falderol falls flat. Two guesses who kills who. Roll credits, drop the popcorn box, hit the exits.

The only surprise here for this viewer was seeing Mel Smith, who is so amusing as cabbie Rocco Melonchek in the Zucker Bros. 1992 tribute to the Marxes,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/BRAIN-DONORS/dp/B0017CW5QC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">BRAIN DONORS</a>. The surprise is that Smith decided to get involved in this turkey.

7971842,4,B00006LPCA,"What an outstanding film this is. I saw it in 1984 when it released on VHS. Glad it's out on DVD after 20 years. Peter Coyote is excellent as STONE an armed robber with his own style of non-violence shall we say ? Unfortunately when a routine robbery goes out of hand and an innocent young nine year old girl is killed by accident, the father of the young girl seeks out his own brand of revenge to bring down STONE and his members. Brilliantly filmed director Terry Bedford shows a fine flair for directing films of this genre. Watch out for the spectacular suspense filled climax. Wow ! Watch this one immediately.",1122854400,6,616,4.460176991150442
