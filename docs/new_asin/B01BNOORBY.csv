8750853,4,B01BNOORBY,"""The Wolf Dog"" is a 12 chapter serial issued by Mascot in 1933, with Rin Tin Tin Junior, directed by Colbert Clark and Harry L. Fraser.  It appears to be the least-often encountered of the Mascot ""all-talking"" serials, and the print used for this DVD, while missing a few pieces, may be the most complete version that exists.

Frank Courtney (Frankie Darro), living in the north woods with his adoptive parents, escapes from his abusive stepfather and heads to Los Angeles to claim his inheritance as heir to a steamship company.  On his way, he befriends a ""wild"" dog, in fact a survivor of a 'plane crash, that had been leading a pack of wolves.  He also befriends the radio operator of one of the company's ships, Bob Whitlock (George J. Lewis) who has invented a device known as ""the lightning ray,"" a deadly weapon that will explode fuels at a distance.  Whitlock plans to give the invention to the government, but the president of the steamship company, Norman Bryan (Hale Hamilton) plans to steal it, along with Frank Courtney's inheritance, having set himself up as the boy's guardian.  Working as Bryan's secretary under an assumed name is Irene Courtney (Boots Mallory), Frank's cousin, trying to obtain evidence that will clear her father, Jim Courtney (Henry B. Walthall) of a false embezzlement charge.  While Frank's father left a letter exonerating Jim Courtney, he didn't know the identity of the guilty person.

A fairly typical Mascot plot, with pursuit of the letter clearing Jim Courtney, attempts to get Bob Whitlock's invention, and the Boy and Dog combination, but for once the identity of the main bad guy is known to the audience.  Hale Hamilton seems to be having a good time in his two-faced role, aided by familiar henchmen Stanley Blystone and Tom London, and it is interesting to see the young George J. Lewis as the hero.  The plot doesn't move at great speed, but works well enough with a day or so between chapters.

Alpha's edition is in two volumes, ALP 7751D and ALP 7752D.  The print used is the same one that has been available from Sinister Cinema, which they also recently issued on DVD.  Both are on single-layer DVD-R discs, which Sinister identifies as being sourced from a 3/4 inch videotape copy.  There are a number of pieces missing, mainly at the start of the chapters, and the intro text is usually broken up by splices.  A couple of the chapters are quite short, and the overlap material may be copied from the previous chapter in a few cases.  Still, the image is fairly clean, with only a few scratches, and the gray scale is better than with many video releases of Mascot serials.  The sound is also clear enough.  Alpha puts their logo on-screen during the opening credits.  While Sinister doesn't do this they have been known to include a small ""SC"" for a few minutes, though I didn't notice any on this release.  Otherwise the main difference between the two editions is the more-professional look to Alpha's menu, and that their two DVD cases provide space for more cover art, while Sinister's comes in a double-disc case that takes up less shelf space.

While entertaining at the recommended dose of one chapter at a time, and with adequate picture and sound quality, the missing pieces of the print need to be tolerated.  I'll just give it a four-star ""I like it"" rating, but given the film's obscurity this is a great release for fans of Mascot's serials.",1495324800,,3415,4.733108108108108
