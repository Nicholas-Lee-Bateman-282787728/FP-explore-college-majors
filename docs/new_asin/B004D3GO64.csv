If you are expecting the same Mrs Brown as you seen on YouTube...please think again, at times the show is funny however most of the time dull and boring,granted the verbiage is the same, however these are not done in front of the live studio audience, so the comedians do not play off of the audience laughter.

We had seen a couple of clips on UTube and decided we had to get a copy. At the time, we did not know it was a set of 7 DVD's, filmed over 3-4 years. As we watched each DVD, I swear the laughing got louder, it is just so funny. It is typical, good, funny  British comedy.

The stories are based in Dublin, Ireland. The situations Mrs Brown gets herself in is just too funny to explain.

4331325,4,B004D3GO64,"This series was made before the actual BBC show.

It is worth a look, but it is not as funny as the BBC show or the live shows. This is where Mrs. Brown was developing into the hilarious show it is today.

It is interesting to see how the cast has changed to what it is today. There was a different woman playing the part of Winnie here. She was cool and collected. The sister of Brendon plays Winnie now and makes the part hilarious.

Brendon's real life son plays Buster now, but here, he played another one of the Brown children for a couple episodes. Then the character disappears and is barely spoken of.

The part of Sharon was recast as well.

I recommend it, but it doesn't have the bite yet that the BBC show has.",1385942400,,722,4.202898550724638
4331326,5,B004D3GO64,"The TV show ""Mrs Brown's Boys"" came in the mail today....
I have never laughed so hard, for so long in my life. We plan to play one show every Saturday so we can span out the fun as long as possible.

If your in the USA or Canada, Be sure to have a  ""zone free"" DVD player that can also convert the UK's PAL format to US NTSC format .... I found one on Amazon for under $ 30.00 US.

Apparently, this may have been the first attempt at this show and it was filmed in different locations with a bit of a different cast of characters, which was OK, but the main dissappointment was that it just wasn't funny like the TV live series. The more current live TV series is hysterical.  These shows in this DVD package did not make the mark.

I had an issue with the fact that you have to decode the discs because they are from another country than the US. It was my fault because it stated it clearly on the description but I am not techno savvy and really didn't know or understand what it meant and it never occurred to me that a series from Ireland would be sold here that wouldn't work in a DVD player. I didn't know that they were programmed differently. I kept them anyways and had to download a decoder system in my computer which I paid for and had to watch them on my computer instead of the television. I will know next time to watch out for the specifications on foreign shows. The company that sold it to me offered to refund my money minus the delivery charges and I would have ended up spending almost as much on delivery charges that it cost me for the series all together, so I chose to keep them.
