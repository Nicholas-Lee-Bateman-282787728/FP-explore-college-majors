6760252,5,B00OTADCSE,"Last Man Standing is my favorite show. I gave the third season 5 stars, because I saw every episode when it aired. I bought Season 1 and 2 and waited a long time for Season 3 to be available. Amazon, please make a new cover for this DVD! It's the same photo from Season 2, but with Tim Allen's character in a chair photo shopped into it! This show deserves better!",1415664000,2,364,4.140845070422535

6760256,5,B00OTADCSE,Great show with great ratings. Abc cancelled because Tim Allen is a conservative. Another example of libs suppressing anyone who disagrees with them.,1515801600,,149,5.521739130434782

6760261,5,B00OTADCSE,This is an excellent series.  We have watched them at least 4 times so far and we never get tired of the story lines or quips that are so funny.  Great cast!  Excellent writing with actually something important to say.  Well done  cast and writers.,1510617600,,248,4.4222222222222225
6760262,5,B00OTADCSE,"This show is great. I haven't seen anything on cable that I found worthy of watching for years. Then, I discovered this work of art! What a shame it was taken off. Seems like MSM doesn't want a balanced perspective of politics or even anyone on the right to have a platform to say what they actually think. MSM would rather present their view and their view of what the other side thinks. You know, it would be terrible for anyone libertarian or conservative to prevent an echo chamber in the entertainment industry. It's why the entertainment industry is slowly dying.",1510358400,,569,4.643564356435643

6760266,5,B00OTADCSE,"I usually watch westerns almost all the time, but I was channel surfing one day and came across an episode of this show. I've always liked Tim Allen so I continued to watch the entire 1/2 hour episode.  It was great and even though the wackadoodle guy who plays the babydaddy to Tim's grandson (Boyd) drives me crazy, I can deal with him being a jerk as long as the rest of the show is top-notch!  And it is.  I've ordered all 4 season already on DVD and I hope they soon put seasons 5 and 6 on DVD because I'd like to have all of the episodes.",1506211200,,544,4.018518518518518

6760272,5,B00OTADCSE,Am collecting all the seasons of this show as it is one of the best of the best! Tim Allen is a great actor and is good at surrounding himself with other very talented people. I love how this show sometimes incorporates folks from Home Improvement with jokes that hit to that point. But mostly I love that he's not afraid to be a patriotic American that loves his family. I hope they bring this show back somehow!!,1503014400,,414,4.32051282051282

6760279,5,B00OTADCSE,"I love Tim Allen in most anything, but this is the best!  I cannot believe that this show was cancelled by it's, obviously stupid, network.  Another network should pick it up!  kit  WAITING FOR SEASONS 5 & 6 TO BE AVAILABLE ON AMAZON.COM",1496361600,,237,4.441860465116279

6760284,5,B00OTADCSE,"I'm going to repeat this review for all 4 of these seasons on this series -- I LOVE IT AND CAN HARDLY WAIT UNTIL SEASON 5 IS AVAILABLE FOR PURCHASE.  I've always liked Tim Allen's sense of humor, especially in Home Improvement and when he was doing stand-up.  However, I gotta say this is the very best he's ever done as far as I'm concerned.  Like The Walking Dead series, I hope this one lasts a very long time.",1490400000,,413,4.2025316455696204

6760289,5,B00OTADCSE,"If you're a Tim Allen fan then this is for you. The ensemble cast has perfect chemistry,especially the two younger daughters Mandy and Eve, and the comedic content never gets dry from season to season. Kyle, the ever present and butt of endless jokes both receiving and self-inflicted is an adored character that never fails to compliment every episode. There is political overtone in almost every episode, a right-leaning position, which adds to the diversity of witty remarks and a hilarious relationship with Ryan, a left-leaning character, the father of his grandson Boyd. This season really picks up the pace and truly begins a well-deserved successful run of the series well into and through Season 6. The mix of episode topics and the inclusion of all cast members, is a testament to the creative style of the writers. All-in-all, it is a funny show and a great cast, and Tim Allen at his best.",1487462400,3,901,4.857142857142857

6760345,5,B00OTADCSE,Last Man Standing kind of reminds me of a modern day All in the Family of course they're very different. Last Man Standing with an impeccable performance from Tim Allen and Nancy Travis. Mike (Tim's character) a very conservative republican with plenty of great jokes mostly towards his bum liberal son-in-law. If you picked up the first two seasons. Absolutely get this one!

6760366,5,B00OTADCSE,"Another great season of LMS! The conservative, patriotic leanings of Tim Allen's character Mike Baxter are a pleasure to watch. The increased presence of neighbor Chuck Larabee this season provides a humorous counterpoint to Mike. Especially fun because as socio-economic equals, their shots at each other really resonate.  So much better than Mike's exchanges with eldest daughter Kristin and her boyfriend Ryan. As another reviewer pointed out, Kristin and Ryan are just plain annoying, and the show wouldn't miss a beat if these two characters were written out altogether. The recasting and reshaping of Kristin after season one was a mistake.  In season one Kristin was portrayed as a sweet, intelligent girl who was handling her situation as a single mom with hard working dignity. Scenes with Kristin and Ryan now are a good time to raid the fridge. But the rest of the cast makes up for this one complaint.  Hector Elizondo as Mike's boss and friend Ed is always a treat to watch, as is perennial Baxter boyfriend Kyle, whose uncluttered good nature is warm and funny.  Nancy Travis as Mike's wife Vanessa is perfect, and younger daughters Mandy and Eve are always funny, and well-played by Molly Ephraim and Kaitlin Dever, respectively. Also the return of Robert Forster as Mike's dad, Bud, is a welcome one, after not appearing in season two.  Hope this show continues for several more years, it deserves to!",1423958400,6,1417,4.987288135593221

6760379,5,B00OTADCSE,"Wonderful show, great humor with a cast that fulfills their roles.  I love Mandy, although I would pull her hair out if she was my own daughter.  Eve is such a great contrast to her. The small bit of casting using Jonathan Taylor Thomas is a fun as well. (I will leave that for the reader to look up, in case of spoilers.)  The conservative approach to issues is refreshing to me.  There is certainly a politically conservative flavor, yet the show addresses current issues in a fair way, generally presenting a view of both sides, without making conservative ideas look stodgy.  In this, it does a nice job of contrasting some of the over-the-top liberal issues against a bit of good old plain common sense.  Tim Allen is, as always, a great comedian.",1419897600,12,752,4.574626865671642
6760380,5,B00OTADCSE,Just love this show....Always a go to for us.  Came in good condition and as described.,1419811200,,87,4.4375
6760381,5,B00OTADCSE,"I love this show so much. Tim Allen's return to sitcoms is a win. They do take a lot of political shots and those shots tend to favor the right wing way of thought, so if you're one of those that can't take a joke, or think dodgeball is violent, this show probably isn't for you. I like the chemistry of the family, I feel like they could actually be a family, and that they keep bringing in past Home Improvement characters, and referencing Tim Allen's past works in movies is a huge win.",1419811200,9,489,4.212765957446808
6760382,5,B00OTADCSE,"last man standing is a great show with Tim Allen...Pure gold with how he can deliver  and cut through the crap. Surprisingly he and Nancy Travis work well together...the two youngest daughters excellent. The eldest daughter and her boyfriend are a big mistake. I don't find either of the actors remotely funny and they are just annoying. Its a pity that they turn up so often. The actress who played the eldest daughter in the first series was so much better. The character they introduced as the boyfriend in the last episode of the first series was also funnier...The character now is just a prig and seems to be  there only to disagree continually with anything the Tim Allen character says.
When they are not in s scene though the show is pure gold",1419724800,5,752,4.604477611940299
6760383,5,B00OTADCSE,"The show and dvd's are terrific only one suggestion though.
They do not have closed captions. They would be nice especially when the girls deliver a line that is high pitched and hard to catch.
But I love my three seasons collection.
Bless Tim Allen.",1419465600,8,250,4.5777777777777775
