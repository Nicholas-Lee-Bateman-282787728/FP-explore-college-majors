3116538,5,B0013LRKV2,"The fourth season of ""Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C."" finds Jim Nabors' Gomer Pyle utilizing his talent of singing to its fullest potential in a series of episodes that's really a four-part episode. Part One, titled ""The Great Talent Hunt"", finds Gomer a regional base finalist winner of a singing competition. Gomer is off to Washington, D.C. to represent Camp Henderson. Part Two, titled ""Gomer Says Hey To The President"", finds Gomer & Sgt. Carter arriving in the nation's capital, & decide to take in the sights, well, at least Gomer does anyway. Part Three, titled ""A Child Shall Lead Them"", finds Gomer & the Sergeant looking after a young lad, who appears to be lost, so they are involved in a wild goose chase in trying to get the young boy home. In Part Four, titled ""The Show Must Go On"", it's showtime, & Gomer has a case of butterflies in his stomach, so severe, that Gomer contracts laryngitis. An enjoyable tour-de-force, nonetheless. Gomer & Sgt. Carter meet up with snake oil salesman Friendly Freddy once again. Last time, our men in uniform were fleeced by Freddy (which was in Season Three where Gomer & the Sergeant were sold wristwatches which turned green). This time, Freddy schemes to sell Gomer a pearl ring, except this time the item turns out to be the real McCoy! So, Freddy is under pressure from his ""supplier"" to retrieve the ring. Larry Storch returns as Manuel Cortez, except this time he makes a play for Lou-Ann Poovie (Gomer's girlfriend - played by Elizabeth MacRae)! A graphic artist visits Camp Henderson to ""recruit"" a subject for a recruiting poster. When Sgt. Cater thinks he's the artist's subject, Gomer becomes the subject to everyone's surprise...Shazam! Carol Burnett guest-stars in ""Corporal Carol"" & Frances Bavier stops by Camp Henderson in ""A Visit From Aunt Bee"". Aunt Bee gets on Sgt. Carter's case when Carter yells at Gomer. Bunny Wilson (played by Barbara Stuart) is annoyed by Sgt. Carter's mannerisms & date etiquette, that she & Lou-Ann decided to change partners in the episode titled...you guessed it...""Change Partners""! Season Four is one season chock-full of laughs & superbly written storylines, that you'll want your very own copy. Pick up ""Gomer Pyle U.S.M.C. - The Fourth Season"" today...as in ASAP! As Sergeant Carter would say, ""MOVE IT, MOVE IT!!!"".

3116583,4,B0013LRKV2,"I ordered the full series..5 seasons. The first 3 were hilarious! But the 4th season it started to not be as funny cause they kind of ""citified"" Gomer. What made the show so funny was that this country boy was trying to live in the city environment...and staying with his country mentality and upbringing. ""you can take the boy out of the country, but you can't take the country out of the boy"" kind of thing. But the 4th season..they started taking the country out of Gomer and it just wasn't that funny. Just another city boy in the city. They also have Sgt Carter's constant yelling at Gomer get more to the violent side and so constant..I was muting it most of the time. It just got out of hand. The 5th season...they kind of flipped the mentality of Gomer and Sgt. Carter and made Gomer the ""smart"" one and Sgt Carter the ""dumb"" one (for lack of better wording). I didn't like the 5th season.",1321142400,,897,4.377245508982036
3116584,5,B0013LRKV2,"Great Show!  Classic comedy, totally (mostly) predictable but that is part of what makes it great!  I always remebered that the show was just annoying when I was younger but after seeing it again I realized how funny it really is!",1315180800,,230,4.585365853658536

3116587,2,B0013LRKV2,"I swear this collection is not complete. I remember an episode where Gomer is assigned a dog to train. He ends up turning the attack dog into a family pet. There's another episode where Gomer yells hooty hoot everytime he wants to  be heard by Carter out in the woods. I remember another episode with Jamie Farr from MASH was in it. I think it was Carter having a difficult time remembering his line to say-I think it was ""Let's hear for Henshaw"" And another episode when Gomer has a horse on base. I remember Carter saying when he thinks he sees a horse look in his barracks window, ""I could of sworn I'd seen horse face Dombrowski"" I have all five seasons but they don't contain these episodes yet they claim this is the complete set!??!?",1253404800,,740,4.401459854014599
3116588,5,B0013LRKV2,Season four is a good season of Gomer pyle in this season there is no Duke slatter but he comes back in season 5 as a corpral worth buying it no extra features,1232409600,,159,3.8484848484848486
3116609,2,B0013LRKV2,"After enjoying Seasons 2 and 3, I was very much disappointed with this latest collection.  I agree with the comments of a previous poster, Dr. Juengling, about major changes in the situations and characters.  Previously, Gomer was an intolerable clod who made problems wherever he went.  This season, he is sensitive, intelligent and helpful while it is Carter who acts like a complete boob.  I don't know what the producers expected to get out of reversing the relationship of their lead characters.  It's comparable to switching the roles of Abbott and Costello and still expecting them to be funny.  Also, Nabors and Sutton often seem run down in scenes.  Sutton's performance, in particular, is no longer as sharp and energetic as it was in previous seasons.  Old plots are recycled with less effect.  The most obvious example is ""Love and Goulash,"" which is a retread of the second season episode ""Arrivederci, Gomer.""  The show was certainly missing Ronnie Schell.  The camaraderie that Gomer enjoyed in the barracks when Ronnie Schell and Ted Bessell were playing his best friends is largely absent at this point.  The earlier seasons depicted a good deal of interaction between the Marines in the barrack scenes.  Now, though, Gomer usually spends his time in the barracks sparsely surrounded by non-speaking extras.  This is especially evident in the episode ""Leader of Men,"" when Gomer is put in charge of his unit and his fellow Marines respond to his repeated orders with nothing more than nods.  It's like this is the Marine's special all-mute unit.  The one improvement this season was the fact that more scenes were shot on location.  Previously, Gomer's off base experiences were confined to a street set at the Desilu Studio.  This set, which included a movie theatre, a diner, a hotel and a few shops, had gotten to be claustrophobic after three seasons.",1220659200,4,1872,4.983870967741935
3116610,3,B0013LRKV2,"It is terribly disappointing to get these DVD's only to find they have been edited.

The entire point of purchasing the DVD sets/seasons is to watch the show in a clear, complete manner, without commercials.  Also to avoid the constant nagging of station bugs (logos) in the corners, and if that weren't enough, now commercials scroll across the screen during the shows.  It has become so bad, I no longer watch most TV.  For TV shows I really like I'll purchase the DVD sets just to get away from the constant irritants.

Yet, we don't get the full shows.  Dialog is cut, songs edited out, etc.  All for the sake of saving a few cents per copy, and done only to avoid literally pennies in royalties.

Note to CBS:  I would much rather pay a little extra per season and get the unedited, uncut versions. The show was timeless just the way it was.",1216598400,16,846,4.441558441558442
3116611,4,B0013LRKV2,"The history of these DVD sets since season one has had the episodes literally butchered when it came to the music in the show.  Even a small snipit of Sargent Carter singing ""The Night Was Meant For Love"" in one episode, or a full version of Gomer singing ""This Train is a Going Home Train"", the cheapsakes that are producing these DVD sets of Gomer Pyle make even Season 4 a disappointment.  However, in watching these episodes I'm finding that it's not just music that's cut; there is also dialog in scenes that's been hacked out.  Because of the electronic graphic and CG era that we live in, I look forward to shows being released on DVD because there are no ""bugs"" in the corners of the screens, no animated graphics promoting upcoming shows, or any other distractions.  The shows for the most part are the way they should be seen, uncut and commercial free.  This is not the case with the Gomer Pyle DVD's including season 4.  Dialog, music and other scenes cut because the production companies don't want to pay the royalties for the music included in the original releases.  Why dialog is cut, I'm not sure.  I was such a fan of this show, and really wanted a complete collection of the episodes, but I'm very disappointed in the results that have come about on my store shelves.  If we continue to purchase these edited sets, the production companies will continue to put out these cheap imitations of the real show.  I've written a letter to CBS with a formal complaint, but I know it will fall on deaf ears.  But if more enthusiasts like us continue, maybe we'll make a difference.  If you're an avid fan of Gomer, then this is the best we can get for now.  I only wish they were complete episodes.",1216339200,26,1709,4.491909385113269
3116612,5,B0013LRKV2,"I find this set to be very enjoyable just as the previous versions. Good color, sound and all of the epispodes. I do not mind a missing song here and there like some others. I rather this version than none at all..",1215907200,2,214,4.119047619047619
3116613,5,B0013LRKV2,"Well, you probably already know the Gomer Pyle series, so I won't explain what it's all about.  However, this season is a real departure in some ways from the other seasons. First, Gomer's buddy, Duke (Ronnie Schell) is gone.  OK, I guess his other buddies can pick up the slack.  Second, Gomer sings a lot in this season. It seems that every time you turn around, Gomer is singing.  If you like Jim Nabors' or ballads by baritones, then you'll love this season.  If not, you'll find yourself pressing the fast forward button pretty often.  Finally, Gomer's and Sergeant Carter's roles in the show are quite different. In the earlier years, the show is based on Gomer antagonizing/irritating Carter. Carter would blow up and then somehow everyting would work out.  But in this season, Carter is to a large degree the source of his own problems.  He's the one who causes the problems--not in a comic way, but by his own vices.  Then Gomer, through his flawless character, saves Carter.  It's an interesting relationship.
One more thing: some of the basic story lines are very similar to ones from earlier years.  Did the writers run out of ideas?
I don't write these things as criticisms, just observations.  The show is still fun and worth a thousand laughs.  It's good, clean fun, fit for the whole family.",1215648000,5,1307,4.730088495575221
3116614,3,B0013LRKV2,"Gomer Pyle,everyone's favourite bungling Marine Corps PFC,comes back for more family fun and laughs in Season Four. The whole gang is back except for Ronny Schell who played Gomers' friend for most of the first three seasons. He was a stand up comic and because of the exposure he got on this show his career started to heat up so he wasn't available for this season.
This Seasons' DVD set gets only a 3 1/2 star rating from me,which is unfortunately much lower than it should have been.
You may or may not have noticed some controversy by other reviewers over whether previous seasons were complete or not. I can say without reservations that a few episodes in this season have indeed been cut.
Two examples are ""Gomer says Hey to the President"" has been cut a full three minutes while ""Gomer,the Privileged Character"" was cut by about a minute. In the latter ep you can see when Gomer is about to go back on stage to sing a number the scene fades quickly out. In the former Gomer is in Washington to sing in a gala benefit and has a fine number with the actual Marine Corp band of the day. It looks as if it was shot live and as is;a nice number which highlights Nabors' fabulous singing talent. But it's the only singing number with Nabors we see. It seems a pretty sure thing that the three minutes cut out here involve his singing but,unlike ""..the privileged character"" ep, it's very hard to tell a which point it was cut.
While I make no excuses for Paramount/CBS in cutting these numbers(that being the reason for my rating), I do know that things have changed drastically since the 1960s in obtaining permission/rights to air songs,especially from old shows and on DVD like this one. That they couldn't get the proper rights and/or that it would have been prohibitively too expensive to do so,are probably the primary reasons for their no-shows. It is so unfortunate too. What tantalizingly little we do get makes one long to see more. Because of his exposure on the show Jim Nabors' virtually launched his singing career from it and deservedly so. He went on to have his own TV show,released and sold quite alot of records and made many live appearances.
In conclusion,if you can get past the singing numbers that are excised from a few of these eps,then you will certainly enjoy this Season Four of Gomer Pyle. It has been remastered and all 30 eps are here for you and your family to enjoy. As I have said so often,how many shows today can an entire family sit down to watch together without having to worry about the content,either in language or theme? None that I know of. It's also great to be able to watch humour any age group can understand and laugh together with. To say ""they don't make them like this anymore"",is to describe Gomer Pyle to a tee.",1215475200,6,2768,4.526946107784431

3116616,5,B0013LRKV2,"For good clean family fun, this is the show to watch. The simple plots with Gomer getting into trouble, along with Sgt. Carter getting dragged along for the ride is hilarious.

Part One, titled ""The Great Talent Hunt"", finds Gomer a regional base finalist winner of a singing competition. Gomer is off to Washington, D.C. to represent Camp Henderson. Part Two, titled ""Gomer Says Hey To The President"", finds Gomer & Sgt. Carter arriving in the nation's capital, & decide to take in the sights, well, at least Gomer does anyway. Part Three, titled ""A Child Shall Lead Them"", finds Gomer & the Sergeant looking after a young lad, who appears to be lost, so they are involved in a wild goose chase in trying to get the young boy home. In Part Four, titled ""The Show Must Go On"", it's showtime, & Gomer has a case of butterflies in his stomach, so severe, that Gomer contracts laryngitis. An enjoyable tour-de-force, nonetheless. Gomer & Sgt. Carter meet up with snake oil salesman Friendly Freddy once again. Last time, our men in uniform were fleeced by Freddy (which was in Season Three where Gomer & the Sergeant were sold wristwatches which turned green). This time, Freddy schemes to sell Gomer a pearl ring, except this time the item turns out to be the real McCoy! So, Freddy is under pressure from his ""supplier"" to retrieve the ring. Larry Storch returns as Manuel Cortez, except this time he makes a play for Lou-Ann Poovie (Gomer's girlfriend - played by Elizabeth MacRae)! A graphic artist visits Camp Henderson to ""recruit"" a subject for a recruiting poster. When Sgt. Cater thinks he's the artist's subject, Gomer becomes the subject to everyone's surprise...Shazam! Carol Burnett guest-stars in ""Corporal Carol"" & Frances Bavier stops by Camp Henderson in ""A Visit From Aunt Bee"". Aunt Bee gets on Sgt. Carter's case when Carter yells at Gomer. Bunny Wilson (played by Barbara Stuart) is annoyed by Sgt. Carter's mannerisms & date etiquette, that she & Lou-Ann decided to change partners in the episode titled...you guessed it...""Change Partners""! Season Four is one season chock-full of laughs & superbly written storylines, that you'll want your very own copy. Pick up ""Gomer Pyle U.S.M.C. - The Fourth Season"" today...as in ASAP! As Sergeant Carter would say, ""MOVE IT, MOVE IT!!!"".

3351080,4,B0013LRKV2,"I ordered the full series..5 seasons. The first 3 were hilarious! But the 4th season it started to not be as funny cause they kind of ""citified"" Gomer. What made the show so funny was that this country boy was trying to live in the city environment...and staying with his country mentality and upbringing. ""you can take the boy out of the country, but you can't take the country out of the boy"" kind of thing. But the 4th season..they started taking the country out of Gomer and it just wasn't that funny. Just another city boy in the city. They also have Sgt Carter's constant yelling at Gomer get more to the violent side and so constant..I was muting it most of the time. It just got out of hand. The 5th season...they kind of flipped the mentality of Gomer and Sgt. Carter and made Gomer the ""smart"" one and Sgt Carter the ""dumb"" one (for lack of better wording). I didn't like the 5th season.",1321142400,,897,4.377245508982036

3351084,2,B0013LRKV2,"I swear this collection is not complete. I remember an episode where Gomer is assigned a dog to train. He ends up turning the attack dog into a family pet. There's another episode where Gomer yells hooty hoot everytime he wants to  be heard by Carter out in the woods. I remember another episode with Jamie Farr from MASH was in it. I think it was Carter having a difficult time remembering his line to say-I think it was ""Let's hear for Henshaw"" And another episode when Gomer has a horse on base. I remember Carter saying when he thinks he sees a horse look in his barracks window, ""I could of sworn I'd seen horse face Dombrowski"" I have all five seasons but they don't contain these episodes yet they claim this is the complete set!??!?",1253404800,,740,4.401459854014599

3351106,2,B0013LRKV2,"After enjoying Seasons 2 and 3, I was very much disappointed with this latest collection.  I agree with the comments of a previous poster, Dr. Juengling, about major changes in the situations and characters.  Previously, Gomer was an intolerable clod who made problems wherever he went.  This season, he is sensitive, intelligent and helpful while it is Carter who acts like a complete boob.  I don't know what the producers expected to get out of reversing the relationship of their lead characters.  It's comparable to switching the roles of Abbott and Costello and still expecting them to be funny.  Also, Nabors and Sutton often seem run down in scenes.  Sutton's performance, in particular, is no longer as sharp and energetic as it was in previous seasons.  Old plots are recycled with less effect.  The most obvious example is ""Love and Goulash,"" which is a retread of the second season episode ""Arrivederci, Gomer.""  The show was certainly missing Ronnie Schell.  The camaraderie that Gomer enjoyed in the barracks when Ronnie Schell and Ted Bessell were playing his best friends is largely absent at this point.  The earlier seasons depicted a good deal of interaction between the Marines in the barrack scenes.  Now, though, Gomer usually spends his time in the barracks sparsely surrounded by non-speaking extras.  This is especially evident in the episode ""Leader of Men,"" when Gomer is put in charge of his unit and his fellow Marines respond to his repeated orders with nothing more than nods.  It's like this is the Marine's special all-mute unit.  The one improvement this season was the fact that more scenes were shot on location.  Previously, Gomer's off base experiences were confined to a street set at the Desilu Studio.  This set, which included a movie theatre, a diner, a hotel and a few shops, had gotten to be claustrophobic after three seasons.",1220659200,4,1872,4.983870967741935
3351107,3,B0013LRKV2,"It is terribly disappointing to get these DVD's only to find they have been edited.

The entire point of purchasing the DVD sets/seasons is to watch the show in a clear, complete manner, without commercials.  Also to avoid the constant nagging of station bugs (logos) in the corners, and if that weren't enough, now commercials scroll across the screen during the shows.  It has become so bad, I no longer watch most TV.  For TV shows I really like I'll purchase the DVD sets just to get away from the constant irritants.

Yet, we don't get the full shows.  Dialog is cut, songs edited out, etc.  All for the sake of saving a few cents per copy, and done only to avoid literally pennies in royalties.

Note to CBS:  I would much rather pay a little extra per season and get the unedited, uncut versions. The show was timeless just the way it was.",1216598400,16,846,4.441558441558442
3351108,4,B0013LRKV2,"The history of these DVD sets since season one has had the episodes literally butchered when it came to the music in the show.  Even a small snipit of Sargent Carter singing ""The Night Was Meant For Love"" in one episode, or a full version of Gomer singing ""This Train is a Going Home Train"", the cheapsakes that are producing these DVD sets of Gomer Pyle make even Season 4 a disappointment.  However, in watching these episodes I'm finding that it's not just music that's cut; there is also dialog in scenes that's been hacked out.  Because of the electronic graphic and CG era that we live in, I look forward to shows being released on DVD because there are no ""bugs"" in the corners of the screens, no animated graphics promoting upcoming shows, or any other distractions.  The shows for the most part are the way they should be seen, uncut and commercial free.  This is not the case with the Gomer Pyle DVD's including season 4.  Dialog, music and other scenes cut because the production companies don't want to pay the royalties for the music included in the original releases.  Why dialog is cut, I'm not sure.  I was such a fan of this show, and really wanted a complete collection of the episodes, but I'm very disappointed in the results that have come about on my store shelves.  If we continue to purchase these edited sets, the production companies will continue to put out these cheap imitations of the real show.  I've written a letter to CBS with a formal complaint, but I know it will fall on deaf ears.  But if more enthusiasts like us continue, maybe we'll make a difference.  If you're an avid fan of Gomer, then this is the best we can get for now.  I only wish they were complete episodes.",1216339200,26,1709,4.491909385113269
3351109,5,B0013LRKV2,"I find this set to be very enjoyable just as the previous versions. Good color, sound and all of the epispodes. I do not mind a missing song here and there like some others. I rather this version than none at all..",1215907200,2,214,4.119047619047619
3351110,5,B0013LRKV2,"Well, you probably already know the Gomer Pyle series, so I won't explain what it's all about.  However, this season is a real departure in some ways from the other seasons. First, Gomer's buddy, Duke (Ronnie Schell) is gone.  OK, I guess his other buddies can pick up the slack.  Second, Gomer sings a lot in this season. It seems that every time you turn around, Gomer is singing.  If you like Jim Nabors' or ballads by baritones, then you'll love this season.  If not, you'll find yourself pressing the fast forward button pretty often.  Finally, Gomer's and Sergeant Carter's roles in the show are quite different. In the earlier years, the show is based on Gomer antagonizing/irritating Carter. Carter would blow up and then somehow everyting would work out.  But in this season, Carter is to a large degree the source of his own problems.  He's the one who causes the problems--not in a comic way, but by his own vices.  Then Gomer, through his flawless character, saves Carter.  It's an interesting relationship.
One more thing: some of the basic story lines are very similar to ones from earlier years.  Did the writers run out of ideas?
I don't write these things as criticisms, just observations.  The show is still fun and worth a thousand laughs.  It's good, clean fun, fit for the whole family.",1215648000,5,1307,4.730088495575221
3351111,3,B0013LRKV2,"Gomer Pyle,everyone's favourite bungling Marine Corps PFC,comes back for more family fun and laughs in Season Four. The whole gang is back except for Ronny Schell who played Gomers' friend for most of the first three seasons. He was a stand up comic and because of the exposure he got on this show his career started to heat up so he wasn't available for this season.
This Seasons' DVD set gets only a 3 1/2 star rating from me,which is unfortunately much lower than it should have been.
You may or may not have noticed some controversy by other reviewers over whether previous seasons were complete or not. I can say without reservations that a few episodes in this season have indeed been cut.
Two examples are ""Gomer says Hey to the President"" has been cut a full three minutes while ""Gomer,the Privileged Character"" was cut by about a minute. In the latter ep you can see when Gomer is about to go back on stage to sing a number the scene fades quickly out. In the former Gomer is in Washington to sing in a gala benefit and has a fine number with the actual Marine Corp band of the day. It looks as if it was shot live and as is;a nice number which highlights Nabors' fabulous singing talent. But it's the only singing number with Nabors we see. It seems a pretty sure thing that the three minutes cut out here involve his singing but,unlike ""..the privileged character"" ep, it's very hard to tell a which point it was cut.
While I make no excuses for Paramount/CBS in cutting these numbers(that being the reason for my rating), I do know that things have changed drastically since the 1960s in obtaining permission/rights to air songs,especially from old shows and on DVD like this one. That they couldn't get the proper rights and/or that it would have been prohibitively too expensive to do so,are probably the primary reasons for their no-shows. It is so unfortunate too. What tantalizingly little we do get makes one long to see more. Because of his exposure on the show Jim Nabors' virtually launched his singing career from it and deservedly so. He went on to have his own TV show,released and sold quite alot of records and made many live appearances.
In conclusion,if you can get past the singing numbers that are excised from a few of these eps,then you will certainly enjoy this Season Four of Gomer Pyle. It has been remastered and all 30 eps are here for you and your family to enjoy. As I have said so often,how many shows today can an entire family sit down to watch together without having to worry about the content,either in language or theme? None that I know of. It's also great to be able to watch humour any age group can understand and laugh together with. To say ""they don't make them like this anymore"",is to describe Gomer Pyle to a tee.",1215475200,6,2768,4.526946107784431
