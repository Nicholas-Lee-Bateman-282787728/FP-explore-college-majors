393104,4,6301972252,"This seems like one of those films that sounded better on paper than in the actual finished product.  The sets and costumes are gorgeous, the plot (though rather loosely based on the history behind the real Mata Hari) had a lot of potential to be interesting and gripping, and it has four big names heading the bill.  Greta Garbo and Ramon Novarro are two of my favorites, and though I haven't seen him in a huge amount of films yet, I've also really enjoyed Lewis Stone in the films I have seen him in.  The other big star, Lionel Barrymore, overacts as usual, though he does pull off the role well.  (Though I know he was talented in spite of his tendency to overact, it's beyond me why he was once considered a better actor than his brother John.)

However, in spite of the big names, the promising storyline, and the gorgeous costumes and sets, the picture ultimately seems to fall rather flat.  Perhaps part of it could be attributed to how this is after all an early talkie, made in 1931; it would take a little bit longer yet for films to lose this stagy feeling, with almost nonstop chatter, and go back to having more freedom of motion and a balance between dialogue and scenes and moments that didn't rely so heavily on constant talk.  Many of these lines themselves weren't very dramatic or original, more like empty words used to fill the time.  Additionally, it just didn't seem to have a whole lot of dramatic tension or to be a very compelling interesting story till it was well more than halfway over.  There's also the problem of how Ramon is supposed to be portraying a Russian aviator.  Given his Mexican accent and Mexican appearance, it's not really convincing, though he is as beautiful as always, and does manage to convey his talent and bring depth and emotion to the role in spite of the oftentimes rather lame script.  And as in all of her other roles, Garbo also really shines.  She always managed to elevate films that would otherwise be outright clunkers to something interesting and at a higher level due to her subtlety and her electric presence, not to mention how beautiful she was even when she had to wear some pretty ridiculous outfits, as she does here (particularly her hats).  Basically (in my opinion at least), it's one of those films that one watches just to see the stars of because they made it interesting by their mere presence, whereas, had the leads been lesser-talented and less-captivating actors, one might not be all that inclined to want to watch it.",1171411200,8,2503,4.597752808988764
393105,5,6301972252,"Garbo as the German spy in Paris in WW I. She is having an affair with a general (Lionel Barrymore) when she meets a young flyer (Ramon Novarro) and they fall in love. Ordered to get secret papers from him, she seduces him and forsakes their love. Complications occur and she shoots Barrymore to protect Novarro, who's in a plane crash and is blinded. Garbo is convicted of Barrymore's murder and is ordered shot. She and Novarro meet one last time to reconcile their love before she goes before the firing squad.

The dialogue and much of the acting is somewhat contrived and on the stiff side, but the Garbo mystique is in full bloom. Perhaps the best scene in the picture is when Garbo seduces Novarro and makes him blow out a religious candle before taking him to bed: she plays the coy, powerful mistress to perfection. It's a very exotic production, and it's easy to see why Garbo became such a sensation. Definitely worth a watch.",1137888000,5,937,4.5773809523809526

393108,5,6301972252,"Mata Hari arrived in Paris and soon began to spin a web of sorcery. Her naked body (that same body that was later to be riddled with bullets)her password to a greedy world of material success. Margaretha Geertruida Zelle MacLeod enjoyed a happy childhood in Holland the darling of a dotting father. Early restlessness brought her to Java, the mail-bride of a brute. There, in Indonesia, amid crushing tragedy and spousal abuse, Gertie absorbed the artistic concepts that will one day found her applauded, then, mowed down by a French firing squad. Poor judgment, and Eastern flair, and a gluttony for men, contrived to make her eternal. But was Gertie a spy? The visionary Irving Thalberg secured the rights to Mata Hari's notebooks and thus MGM began production starring Greta Garbo. I find this 1932 film a work of contrasts. To watch Garbo mise-en-scene through the lens of William Daniels, in a genial atmosphere assembled by Cedric Gibbons, rapturous, is truly a fine thing. MGM's 'Mata Hari' remains a unique accomplishment. Though one wonders how the silly story-theme ever passed Thalberg. There is a dichotomy here, style versus substance (a chronic blemish with some of Garbo's films) The developing narrative is puerile, and mind you, the early thirties boasts many a gritty film. More than an actress Garbo is a virtuosa, a poseur. Thus she offers art more priceless, a curious and singular spiritual apogee, such pulchritude and distinction. Watch her shoulders ache suddenly as she plays piano en-scene, as her stock-in-trade matinee idol grasps her from behind wantonly. Watch her match wits with Lewis Stone, tonight her spy-master. Watch Garbo in the third act climb the hospital stairs Adrian head-to-toe. Watch her watch her. But! if I hear Ramon Navarro one more time call her ""...Mata!"" I think I'd croak (her name is M-A-T-A-H-A-R-I) How many times I've seen 'Mata Hari' I'm ashamed to say. The last viewings have been in the wee hours where there reigns a sad and profound solitude.

She is really the best thing about this film, which is kind of cheesy in everything else. The costumes are gorgeous, the sets are well-contrived, but it's the worn story and wooden acting all around Garbo that drag this film down.
This is a Hollywood rendering of a famous spy, Mata Hari, who, on being caught, is executed by firing squad in the end. There is no faulting Garbo's contribution, as she slithers from one scene to the next, fully convincing as the ill-fated, beautiful spy. I only the rest of the cast had put forth that much effort! Ah well.
Fans of Miss Garbo will, no doubt, fully enjoy this film, as Garbo is actually very moving in her scenes. Now don't get me wrong, I actually enjoyed this film, myself. I just wish more effort could have been put forth by just a few more of her colleagues.
I give this film four stars on the basis of Garbo's unique ability to light up the screen whenever she appears, and for the glorious costumes that populate her environment. Just sit back and enjoy the visual treat that was Greta Garbo.",1016582400,20,1206,4.536697247706422
393110,5,6301972252,"This is the Garbo movie I watch nearly every week, and have watched
for years. For one thing, no other Ameican movie so brilliantly
choreographed costumes, decor, lightning,star make-up like this
extraordinary fantasy of the notorious spy. The fact it was made in
l932 is another plus because our movie stars looked so damned glorious
back then. Hours and entire days were spent lighting one
close-up. Adrian came up with knockout fashions for his great star:
fantastic lame capes, sequined/precious stone gowns, fur-lined
greatcoats, hats of all types, ravishing photography by William
Daniels. Garbo is cast opposite a perfect male beauty of that era: the
now forgotten but very sensual Ramon Navarro, who had been a great
silent star like Garbo but unlike her, he was on his way out. He was
later murdered in the early 50s by two neanderthal hustlers who used
the black,art deco dildo given to him by his tragic lover,
Valentino.... Cedric Gibbons designed the high gloss fantasy world of
intrigue in Germany. Camera set-ups and groupings, especially in the
surreal court scene, often looks like a Russian avant-garde
movie. Shadows, Garbo's face painted in ultra white make-up, very
thick eyeliner and false lashes, so that she resembles a symbol,
rather than a person make you realize just how lovingly a screen
goddess was treated in those days. (I mention this movie often in my
book on old Hollywood, ""The Kiss of King Kong""). Best scene
is with Garbo at the hospital, visiting her lover, Navarro. Wearing a
stunning 30s hat with a metal pendant, a knock-out furlined coat,
photographed unforgettably by Daniels, you're transported into another
dimension. The final scene of Garbo being led off by soldiers to be
shot is another unforgettable movie moment. Viva la Garbo, Adrian,

Or was she a free spirited woman living in France, in early twentieth century, emulating other performers like Isadora Duncan and Ruth St. Denis, the female revolutionaries of exotic dance and entertainment in Paris. In this MGM classic of 1931, starring Greta Garbo and Ramon Novarro, Garbo offers a stunning performance as Mata Hari, a German spy but falls in love with a young Russian officer named Lieutenant Alexis Rosanaff (Ramon Novarro). It was one of her several glamorous movie roles and the story start with a seductive Mata Hari style dance that is quite erotic. Ben Mickiewicz said on TCM that the dance may have been done by a stand-in. However, historical figure Mata Hari, in real life was very promiscuous, flirtatious, and openly flaunted her body. She captivated her audiences with her seductive acts at the Mus&eacute;e Guimet in Paris. She posed as a Java princess born to priestly Hindu family, and deeply immersed in the art of sacred Indian dance. She imagined the dance movement of Hindu God Nataraja which is portrayed in a deeply insensitive manner in this film. The artistic performance must not be hurtful to the religious sentiments of others.

Ramon Novarro made an effective romantic foil in their only movie together. Lionel Barrymore, Lewis Stone and Karen Morley performed splendidly in their supporting roles in this George Fitzmaurice directed film. Though the title character was real, the events in the film are mostly fictional, and when this film was in production, it was rumored that Greta Garbo and Ramon Novarro were having an affair. But this couldn't have been the case since both had gay orientation. But they became very good friends after this movie. Mata Hari was certainly a box office hit that went on to make $2.23 million in total revenue. I very much enjoyed this movie and it is strongly recommended!",1418688000,,1913,4.940993788819876

You have to appreciate the genre of the early talkies or this movie will not interest you much.

By today's standards there is little to recommend this movie, yet I enjoy watching it.

There are some interesting costumes, and Garbo is her usual beguiling self, but the story is completely implausible and Roman Navarro's portrayal of a young Russian officer as her love interest is just pathetically bad. However, in some respects it makes Garbo's performance seem better.

Lionel Barrymore plays a Russian general that Mata Hari is also having an affair with and who has been giving her secret information. His acting is more campy than bad.

393205,4,6301972252,"Garbo spoke in 1930's ""Anna Christie""....but no-one was prepared for the frenzy that would be unleashed the following year, when she took on the exotic character of MATA HARI.  As the notorious WW1 lady spy, Garbo romances a sorely-miscast Ramon Novarro (more about him later) and slithers her way across the screen in a dance sequence that almost ended up on the cutting-room floor.

Garbo enchants as Mata Hari, the sensation of the Paris nightclub set, and also a powerful weapon in Europe's spy ring.  She knows her job all-too-well, and carefully manouvers herself around the tricky subject of love...which could prove her undoing when she meets young Russian airman Lt. Alexis Rosanoff (Ramon Novarro).  Spies don't have room in their lives for such bothersome things as lovers, and, as Mata realises thanks to some wise words from her superior Andriani (Lewis Stone), ""the only way to resign from our profession is to die"".  As Mata's affair spins wildly out of control and her interest in spying reaches carelessless, will she wind up in front of the firing squad?

Greta Garbo alone is why 1931's MATA HARI is still such a devilish good time.  She's wildly campy (and doesn't take herself too seriously) in the dance sequence; whilst the scenes with Novarro are handled very professionally.  Ramon Novarro does seem hopelessly miscast as the Russian airman.  He's very awkward in his love scenes with Garbo (which are written in a style that's much too sentimental to begin with), and he doesn't seem to carry much in the way of a true feeling for the part.  Karen Morley has a fascinating supporting role as a fellow female spy; and Lionel Barrymore plays another of Mata's government supporters.

There was almost a case of the ""Battling Mata's"", when Paramount discovered MGM's plans to showcase Garbo as the lady spy.  They quickly rushed into release the Marlene Dietrich picture ""Dishonored"", in which Dietrich starred as a Mata Hari-esque spy who too becomes unraveled by love.  Just like Garbo, Dietrich had to cope with an ungainly, dead-weight leading man (Victor McLaglen), but in many aspects ""Dishonored"" is the superior film of the two.

393206,5,6301972252,"Mata Hari was probably one of the most tragic episodes of the WW1. Mata Hari personified the mythical woman, the femme fatal, the unreachable ideal, the highest peak of the erotica, and at the meantime the symbol of the fall down for many men, who naively succumbed before her alluring beauty.

Greta Garbo made a spelling portrait of this spy throughout her brief existence. Her forbidden loves, hazardous encounters and risky job at the service of Germany. What I love the most from the script resides in the lack of melodramatic excess and the presence of two other acting legends: Lionel Barrymore and Ramon Novarro like her most devoted and seduced men.

The dancing sequence will remain as one the most glamorous and sensual ever filmed.

A cult classic all the way out.",1288051200,,776,4.819548872180451
393207,3,6301972252,"Mata Hari, whose name translated loosely as ""Eye of the Morning,"" was an eastern princess who had been immersed in dance from the moment of her birth--or so she said.  In actual fact, she was Margaretha Geertruida Zelle, born to a respectable family in Leeuwarden, Holland.  In 1895, with the family fortune in decline, she married Rudolf John MacLeod and with him moved to Java.  The marriage was horrendously unsuccessful and the couple separated in 1903, when she returned to Europe.  After a stint as everything from an artist model to a circus horseback rider, Margaretha reinvented herself through a name change, skimpy costumes, and fairly lacivious dances.  Critics regarded her as a lousy dancer, but the public loved her, and she would continue her career as both dancer and courtesan for the next fourteen years, passing between lovers as freely as she passed between the theatres of Europe.  During World War I, however, the combination of Mata Hari's lovers and her touring schedule brought charges of espionage.  Accused passing information to Germany that caused the deaths of some fifty thousand French soliders, she was found guilty and executed by firing squad in 1917 at age 41.  Much argument concerning her guilt or innocence continues to this day.

But you won't really learn much of this from the 1931 MGM film MATA HARI.  The Dutch Mata Hari is played by Swedish star Greta Garbo.  Mata Hari and Garbo have precisely one trait in common: neither can dance worth a damn.  Where Garbo is concerned the film tries to conceal this by a mixture of costuming and ""artistic"" cinematography that avoids showing Garbo's legendarily large feet and works to dodge the more obvious edges of her lack of dance talent.  But Garbo is hardly the only performer who is miscast.  Her young Russian lover is played by Mexican actor Ramon Novarro.  Her older Russian lover is played by Lionel Barrymore and her German handler by Lewis Stone, both of them very distinctly American, and her French nemisis by C. Henry Gordon--who isn't quite as badly cast, for although American he doesn't scream it.

Given all this, it is startling that the film works as well as it does.  There are many exceptions, but MGM seemed to feel it was not necessary to be greatly painstaking where Garbo's films were concerned: she was such a great star that she could survive anything, no matter how commonplace.  As such she is frequently the only good thing in the film, often let down by so-so co-stars, silly scripts, and mediocre production values.  But this isn't quite the case with MATA HARI.  Yes, the casting is odd, but everyone involved was a noted and meticulously professional performer; yes, the script is silly, but it has a consistent internal logic.  The cinematography is excellent and Garbo is near the height of her physical beauty--and if the movie tends to treat her as a clothes horse, at least the clothes in question are entertaining in their obvious exoticism.  All this said, while the film is extremely hot-house artificial, it does seem to capture something of Mata Hari.  Not the facts, of course; those were expendable.  But the glamour of the legend, the myth of the glamourous spy who seduced men, betrayed them, destroyed them, using her beauty as a the ultimate secret agent weapon.  It is a prototype that would be repeated endlessly right up to present day: Hitchcock's films aside, female spies are almost always presented as beautiful young women of wanton disposition.

Interestingly, Garbo herself may have gone on to become a spy for the Allies during World War II.  Noel Coward, who did the same, noted that while Garbo had a reputation for almost pathological reclusiveness before and after the war, during the war itself she was at every embassy cocktail party imaginable, chit-chatting with everyone--and since she was Garbo, the great artiste, many sought to impress her by telling her virtually everything they knew.  The word in Coward's circle was that she had agreed to use her celebrity to meet specific persons of interest, talk to them, and pick up loose information that might be of use to the Allies.  It was a ploy that Coward was uniquely positioned to recognize: he often did much the same.

393208,5,6301972252,"Garbo looks alluring and superb in every second of footage. She first appears as the exotic dancer, dedicating her dance to Shiva, as a bayadere would in a sacred temple, except this is Paris and she is dancing for  a select audience wearing an incrdibly elaborate costume that she manipulates quite successfully in a hieratic dance. Her headdress is a double umbrella composition in Thai style that is the perfect accesory for this moment, but by no means the only one she will wear through this tale of mysetry and intrigue, seduction and espionage.

Adrian's gowns have never looked better. He never failed with Garbo, and in this  movie surpassed his talent, it is his ultimate creation. She takes full advantage of the exotic silks, mostly done with Rajastani embroidery to look absolutely stunning. Everyone looks at her wherever she goes in the film and you can't blame them, it was like watching a show for free. Also, you understand that American audiences adored her because the men must have appreciated her feline sensuality as much as the women admired the way she wore those fantasy clothes and was always on the verge of fainting from an overdose of romance.

I also appreciated the complexity of the spy system, including the killer with a deformed foot that dragged it on a special hoof-shoe, which addded a touch of Terror movie to his nasty job.

Ramn Navarro is perfect for the Russian officer role. He is priceless when he walks in ""the morning after"" with a huge floral tribute to throw at her feet and calling after her ""Mata"" with the familiarity of a five year relationship.  Their scenes together are full of romantic magic, they obviously had great chemistry, which now knowing the biographical information with more detail than the audiences did back then,  we can appreciate as truly great acting. The aging Lionel Barrymore is also perfect as the embittered Russian ambassador that causes her downfall and we can all breath better after Garbo shoots him down, and makes it look like a suicide so well that we have hopes it will work out too.

Her trial scene must have been an inspiration for Bergman's ""The Seventh Seal"", her stoic, Calvinist simplicity is an embodiment of medieval death figures, and must have been a model for his chess-playing death character. Amazingly, she looks as glamorous in the simple black cape and hair pulled back as she did wearing all the jewelry of the orient:  and that's one of the differences between a true legend and a star.",1250467200,2,2493,4.80607476635514
393209,4,6301972252,"This Hollywood drama is loosely based on the most famous spy of the Great War. In 1917 France they sought a scapegoat for the stalemate and huge losses in the war. The film begins with the execution of three spies by a firing squad. The last is offered a reprieve if he admits that Mata Hari was the spy; he dies rather than betray her. Du Bois, the secret service man, is convinced of Mata Hari's guilt. She has friends in high places so he must be cautious. A Russian aviator lands in France with secret dispatches. [Lt. Alexis Rozanoff has a Spanish accent.] We see Mata Hari dancing before the idol Shiva, the god of destruction (she remains clothed). Afterwards her friends drink a toast. Then she meets General Serge Shubin, a Russian in Paris who knows of her spying. At the gambling casino we see the head of the German spy ring in Paris. He asks Mata Hari to get a copy of the dispatches carried by Lt. Rozanoff. [Is Ramon Novarro very credible in his role?]

Du Bois visits General Shubin to warn him against Mata Hari, an agent of Wilhelmstrasse. He has no proof. This news upsets Mata Hari. An important message is given to Lt. Rozanoff, he must return to Petrograd as soon as possible. But Mata Hari visits him to delay his departure and allow another spy to borrow the dispatches. This is symbolized by blowing out the votive candle before the icon. The package is taken, its messages are photographed, and the package is returned as if nothing happened. No slow and noisy typewriter was used for copying. [This must have been observed by French counter-intelligence.] Lt. Rozanoff ignored his orders. The tiny microfilm will be smuggled into neutral Holland. A spy who falls in love has outlived her usefulness.

Du Bois telephones General Shubin about Mata Hari's love for a lower ranked Lt. Rozanoff. Shubin's jealous anger makes him telephone Du Bois about proof of Mata Hari's espionage. Mata Hari prevents this. The newspapers report Shubin's suicide. Now Mata Hari is ordered to return to Holland, her usefulness in Paris has ended. But she goes to a hospital to see Lt. Rozanoff, she has big plans for the future. She quickly disposes of the shadow following her. We see her arrest, a dramatic trial, and her conviction. [This is all well-known historical fact.] There is a very sentimental ending that detracts from this drama.

The scenes filmed in a pouring rain seem to be a technical breakthrough. This drama avoids the real names of the French officials who were involved with Mata Hari, high-level government incompetence. Using fictional Russians in Paris means they can't be sued for libel (as in ""Rasputin""). That German spy chief is contemptuous of his agents, a sign of an organizational error.",1183766400,2,2728,4.751054852320675
393210,2,6301972252,"In spite of the spectacular costumes and lighting, this is one of Garbo's duds in which her shining talent rose far above her surroundings. MGM's early talkie version of the Mata Hari legend, the exotic French spy, is weighed down by a verbose, corny and at times confusing script, an inadequate co-star and that leaden atmosphere which was an MGM trademark and dates so many of their dramas.

The print is unrestored but in better condition than other Garbo DVDs.  There, are however, some noticeable jumps in continuity which could be scenes missing from the print. There are no extras except a trailer.  Unless the DVD is purchased as part of one of the Garbo collections, it is poor value.",1183075200,5,693,4.758333333333334

7818542,2,6301972252,"This review is for the Warner Brothers standard def DVD version from 2005.

Grossly fictionalized and sensationalized love story based around the life of the famous exotic dancer and alleged spy, Mata Hari. Even Garbo could not save this film. The costume and production design are about as boring as the film itself, Garbo is adorned in the same dreary and drab pieces of cloth throughout. The dance scene looks like it has been aggressively edited, as one second she is dancing and the next it cuts to a far away high angle shot with Garbo crouched over showing her naked back. Quality of the film is acceptable. There are far better pre-code films out there, this is only for completists.",1492646400,,691,4.710743801652892
7818543,2,6301972252,"An early (1932) MGM talkie, Mata Hari serves up big budget opulence and empty-headed posturing in this fictionalized version of the notorious Dutch dancers last tango in Paris (so to speak). Set amidst the chaos and intrigue of WW1, the movie follows Mata Haris various manipulations (and a few miscalculations) as she vamps her way through the Parisian nightlife, collecting information for the Germans, and discombobulating any suitor foolish enough to fall in love with her. Eventually, of course, Mata Hari crosses the wrong person and is summarily trotted off to a tryst with the firing squad.

As a showcase for enigmatic superstar, Greta Garbo, Mata Hari doesnt skimp on production values. The sets are sumptuous and exquisitely detailed, and the black and white cinematography is lushly romantic, evoking memories less of Paris than of the golden age of Hollywood film studios. The film never adds up to much, though. Indeed, the plot is so loopy, the script such a mess, that it should be a hoot; if, say, von Sternberg had directed it, Mata Hari might still have been a mess but what a spirited, daft and entertaining mess it would have been! Instead, George Fitzmaurice directs the film with a somber seriousness that prevents the film from cutting loose and transcending its inherent falseness.

 Everyone onscreen seems to be playing at being a movie star on a movie set rather than actually enacting a role. Garbos lasting, legendary allure is simply lost on me. True, she has a strange, almost surreal quality that some (many?) consider bewitching, but I find her onscreen persona to be odd and off-putting, and Ive never thought much of her as an actress. She brings presence to the role of Mata Hari, Ill give her that, but she doesnt give so much of a performance as an impersonation. She brings no depth to her character but then theres no depth to any of them. The costume designer, Adrian, must have fallen out with Garbo before shooting started because he decks her out in some of the most stupefyingly god-awful outfits Ive ever seen on an actress in a major movie. Those hideous boxy hats alone should have resulted in his being hauled off the set in handcuffs. Garbos hair is completely tucked away under those hats for nearly the entire movie, so its quite right to wonder whether or not she even has hair; she definitely had an interesting face but, without her hair to frame it, she looks (to me) more like a deranged pixie than a sexed-up dancing queen. Having said that, I did enjoy the opening dance number even though it apparently was Garbos body double in the long shots. The number has a seductive frisson suggesting that the movie will be something more than it turns out to be. Part of this could be that the studio trimmed out the really naughty bits that were, by most accounts, fairly titillating for the times (including a post-coital pillow talk scene between Garbo and Ramon Navarro). Mexican-born Ramon, bless his gorgeous little soul, is cast as Matas Russian aviator/one-true-love and he looks greatin fact, Russian or not, hes probably better suited to his role than Garbo is to hersand hes charming and believably nave, although that may owe less to performance than to circumstance. Otherwise, as sweet as he is, Navarro sort of seems to be checking off the boxes as he goes through the movie. As Navarros superior officer (and Garbos cuckholded lover) Lionel Barrymorealso, allegedly, Russiansounds like a Midwestern college professor giving a lecture; hes simultaneously genial and cranky, yet increasingly unhinged the more Mata Hari slips from his grasp. Ive seen Barrymore give much better performances in much better movies, and while he maintains a certain professional dignity, he seems to be in Mata Hari to collect a paycheck. As the other major player in the film, the German spymaster, Lewis Stone (later to gain fame as Andy Hardys father) is spookily calm as he orders, and carries out, the most dastardly deeds with an almost paternal gravitas: its the essence of the banality of evil. Stone probably gives the best (and most chilling) performance in the film, despite his being completely unbelievable as a German.

Mata Hari was never going to be a true film classic, anyway, but there was a genuine, yet unrealized, potential for the movie achieving status as a camp classic. In the end, the film comes off as a wasted opportunity, as well as a miscasting of Old Hollywood movie stars who were unable to conjure up movie magic.

7818547,2,6301972252,"Mata Hari was a real person, mistress of a French diplomat and a professional dancer. She was arrested by the French and executed as a German spy in 1917. Her trail was a press sensation. In addition to this film, she was played by Jeanne Moreau (1964) and Sylvia Kristel (1985).

Greta Garbo (1905-90) plays Mata Hari. She was a big silent film star and in her first talkie in 1930 (Anna Christie) she was nominated for an Oscar. This was her fourth talkie and a big commercial success.  She is listed #5 on the AFIs list of Greatest Actresses.

Ramon Navarro (1899-1968) plays a Russian pilot. He was the latin lover successor to Rudolph Valentino and very popular through the mid 30s when MGM cancelled his contract partly as a result of an early red scare. He achieved the apex of his fame in the silent era (Ben Hur, Student Prince) and didn't have the same success in talkies.

The great Lionel Barrymore (1878-1954) plays a Russian General. He appeared in more than 200 films between 1908 and 1956, and was twice nominated for an Oscar, winning once (A Free Soul ) in 1931 Though hes probably best known as the evil banker in Its a Wonderful Life (1946) and from his recurring roles in the Dr. Kildare and the Dr. Gillepsie films, he gave us many memorable performances -  as the innkeeper in Key Largo (1948), Thaddeus Stevens in Tennessee Johnson (1942), Grandpa in You Cant Take it With You (1938), and Billy Bones in Treasure Island (1934). Fans of Barrymore will enjoy watching him in his prime, before arthritis robbed him of his ability to walk.

Lewis Stone (1879-1953) plays Mata Haris control agent. He was a major star in the 20s and 30s and was nominated for an Oscar for The Patriot (1930). Between 1914 and 1953 he made more than 150 films; his memorable roles were as the warden in The Big House (1930), Doctor Otternschlag in Grand Hotel (1932), Commissioner Smith in The Mask of Fu Manchu (1932), and Doc in Three Godfathers (1936). Hes probably best known for his continuing role as Judge Hardy in the Andy Hardy films (1937-46). Stone gives his usual fine performance.

Williams Daniels (1901-70) is the cinematographer. Garbo insisted he shoot all her films, which he did, except for 2 (Conquest, Two-faced Woman) which turned out to be flops at the box office. When not working with Garbo, Daniels was a favorite of Erich von Stroheim. Daniels lensed more than 150 films. He was nominated 3 times (Anna Christie, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, How the West was Won) and won once (Naked City in 1948). Daniels photography is exceptional. Its one of the best parts of the film.

1931 was a great year for film. The top grossing films were Frankenstein, Cimarron, Mata Hari, City Lights, and Dracula. The Oscars went to Cimarron (Picture), The Champ (Actor), and Min and Bill (Actress). Other notable films released that year include  M, Public Enemy, Dr. Jekyl and Mr. Hyde, and Monkey Business.

Im not a big fan of Garbo in general, and her talkies specifically. Her acting was more suited to the silent era, and this film, an early talkie, has a lot of silent film elements as well as silent film stars. Garbo fans will enjoy it.",1440633600,,3150,4.608928571428572
