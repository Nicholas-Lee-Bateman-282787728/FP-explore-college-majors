8436145,5,B004MNRZGS,"This video is very well thought out.  It presents information in a very logical and unstandable way. It tells you what tools you need and how to use them.  It is a great video and I am so glad I bought.  I will most likely give one as a Christmas gift.  I plan to buy her other dvd, Art Stamping Workshop, as well because I was so impressed with this one.",1352764800,,355,3.9577464788732395
