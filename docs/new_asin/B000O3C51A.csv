8182751,1,B000O3C51A,I bought this video so I could work out with my 2 month old baby and was very disappointed.  The instructor uses a ball and not an infant to do the exercises and it doesn't really work with an infant.  It wasn't very challenging of a work out either.,1288137600,,250,4.081632653061225
8182752,4,B000O3C51A,"I liked this video except that when your a little advanced it will not make you sweat...otherwise it will...My child and i worked out together and he enjoyed it as well, except for the times i had to put him down..i guess a little gym is better than none.",1273104000,,255,4.224489795918367
8182753,4,B000O3C51A,"This workout routine is not spectacular but it is challenging enough. i'm not super athletic but i'm in pretty good shape, i would say average and it was not too challenging but not too easy. Some really challenging workouts zap all my energy reserves and then i'm left with no energy to care for my baby. This left me with a little energy to spare but i still got a workout.
my daughter is 1.5 months and she fell asleep during the warm up and was content during the rest of the exercises. I sometimes use the warm up routine to get her to sleep when she's fussy instead of walking her. it gets her to sleep faster and allows me to get a little exercise while putting her to sleep.
this wouldn't be a good workout for anybody, but it's great for a new mom because you can keep your baby entertained while you workout and you'll still have energy to take care of your little one afterward.",1262563200,,889,4.266272189349112
8182754,2,B000O3C51A,"As a mom of a 3 month old I found the workout itself decent though not very specialized for new moms. Its a very basic workout, nothing new to be found here. I wish she would show actual mothers with babies doing the workout as she uses the medicine ball to demonstrate throughout.  There is little to no instruction on proper form and I question some of the ab work for a new mother, there is a lot of twisting and crunches which i don't think a ""new"" mother should be doing as it could lead to worsening diastasis.  There are much better videos out there.  I suggest Erin Obriens Postnatal Workout.",1230768000,,600,4.339285714285714
8182755,1,B000O3C51A,"I bought this to use after I had my daughter.  I had a rough labor and recovery so I wanted to take it easy.  But this was to easy.  I was bored and not at all ""worked out"".  I never broke a sweat or drew a labored breath.  Instead I started using the power 90 dvds. Perhaps the DVD was meant for new moms who weren't working otu prior to baby arriving.",1211068800,,353,3.8472222222222223
8182756,3,B000O3C51A,"Though it's a nice workout to do with your baby, JNL doesn't show you how to hold your baby. It would've been helpful if she included a baby for part of her routine so you can see how to hold your own baby while doing the workout.
On the plus side, I do the workout when my baby girl is fussy and she's usually asleep half way thru the workout. :) I really gott thank JNL for that. :)",1204588800,,384,3.8734177215189876
8182757,4,B000O3C51A,"this dvd was great. at first i was iffy... she was repetitive on the ""what to do with baby"" instructions, but if you look beyond this it's a great video. I thought the exercises looked extremely easy, until i did them. i did the dvd yesterday, and i'm sore today. a good feeling! i'm looking forward to doing her total fitness also.",1185235200,,332,4.370967741935484
8182758,4,B000O3C51A,I keep up with reading Oxygen magazine.  That's where I've seen JNL.  The video is slow and didn't motivate me as I hope it would.  She is a great role model though.,1183766400,2,165,4.09375
8182759,5,B000O3C51A,There is way more than a simple fitness routine to Jennifer Nicole Lee. Her story has been on Oprah and many of the morning shows. She is incredibly inspiring and this fitness title is simply one of the many results she's been able to obtain. What a great story and what a great tape.,1180224000,4,284,4.277777777777778
