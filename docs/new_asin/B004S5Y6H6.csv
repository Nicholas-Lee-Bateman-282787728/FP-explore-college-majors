4461807,5,B004S5Y6H6,This is an awesome story and very relevant for today. Forgiveness is so important for everyone. Don't let time go by as you never know how long you could have someone in your life. Forgive and go on...you will have more peace and better relationships.,1323907200,5,251,4.6
4461808,5,B004S5Y6H6,"Dear Amazon and friends,

I was privileged to preview the movie this summer at a Film Festival here in Phoenix,AZ. My only regret with this film, is that it should have gone STRAIGHT to the theater. I know of no other film so blatantly honest, yet sensitive and appropriate for all to see. Although the movie deals with a father and son who are estranged, there is a lot of metaphor in the movie that only the most discerning of viewers will retrieve. To illustrate the heart of the writer/director of the film, when I shared with him that I had to do a research project for my undergrad' he graciously sent me a copy. I already knew I loved the movie; I've since watched it at least four more times in the week or so that I've had my copy. I shared my presentation in class tonight, and the movie helped me share it's true meaning, forgiveness, love, reconcilation, in front of 2 known lesbians in my class. I had a great talk with one of them, and the other I sensed, saw me in a different light. I shared my personal struggles, and that the movie was not a Disney everything turns out fine in the end kinda movie. Yet, in so many ways, it did, and it did so realistically and respectfully of all viewpoints around a highly controversial subject. I'd love to watch the movie with my parents, if I can't I'll be ordering more copies to give to friends and those that I know are not feeling authentic, satisfied and real in the life they are now living.
Thanks to all who made ""Reconciliation"" possible, and to the One who was the original man of reconciliation.

4461823,5,B004S5Y6H6,"Many people are surprised when I tell them that I am an unenthusiastic fan of Christian entertainment. However, in terms of quality for a ""Christian"" film, there is one definite exception. ""Reconciliation"" (starring Eric Nenninger and Jack Maxwell) is one of my absolute favorites. Wow! I cried and cried the first time I saw it. Stunned and overwhelmed, I was amazed that the movie worked on so many levels. Since its release in 2009, I have viewed it at least a dozen times.

Buy this movie. Rent it. Watch it and share it with others. I can't imagine anyone not being able to connect with at least one of the characters. Even if your circumstances don't have anything to do with homosexuality, ""Reconciliation"" will speak to you. As you will see, Jeff and Grant are far from the only ones needing (and struggling) with reconciliation and forgiveness.

I have been a Gay Christian for 5 years and each day is a struggle, and there was no one to turn to that understand a gay persons love for Jesus Christ.

Reconciliation doesn't deal with the world views on homosexuality, but how God want us to be and that loving towards one and other no matter who you are, and by judging one person sin is being a hypocrite. Everyone should see this film. It deals with the healing, on family and unconditional love.

I will add this to my collections!!!!!!

The questions we face are not all wrapped up nicely with a bow. It delves into hard questions and realistic answers. There are some plot holes and a bit of ""would that really be the way it happens"" moments but I was impressed by the frankness and the honesty of this movie.

I am a Christian and must say the quality of this film is one of the best I've seen in terms of acting, writing, directing, and message.  Nothing cheesy.  This film should have been in theaters!

This film also discusses homosexuality, one of the most controversial and talked about issues around the world.  I've never seen any film tackle the subject matter better.  Pastors and congregations need to watch this film to better understand the topic of Grace, Love, Truth, Holiness and patience no matter the sin.

4461837,5,B004S5Y6H6,"I first saw the movie Reconciliation in March, a second time three weeks ago with my family, and third and fourth times, this past Thursday and Friday (these last two were shown in community because I found the message so valuable).

I know that when people watch this movie there is a tendency to get caught up only on the topic of homosexuality, but I saw the broader application of reconciliation. Where a person who did not face this topic directly but did have relationships that had become obstacles, could now start to see an opportunity for reconciliation.

The movie does an excellent job of showing that reconciliation is a process by which we surrender our kingdom of rightness for the sake of advancing the kingdom of God. It shows that to pursue wholeness in God, we must be willing to lay down our position of wounding/rightness (our kindgom) and follow Christ. This is not something the world teaches. It does not teach reconciliation, but standing up for YOURSELF at all costs.

Let's face it. A lot of us have run into major bumps or potholes with relationships. This movie does bring (and not upon the first viewing, but in subsequent viewings) that every person has been responsible for ""degodding God"". If that phrase bothers you, spend some time reflecting on those two words. It will bring you to an uncomfortable understanding.

As for the message of the gospel that is stated in the movie, it applies to every life situation, and the movie gives it clearly and in love. We (every human being) have fallen short of the glory of God (as we humans tend to think of it, as being truly good to everyone we meet, but we tend to stop short in realizing that we are guilty of the opposite--of never being mean to another individual, ever).

We live in a culture that tends to throw out spiritual, eternal things, much like junk mail, once we have a hint of the sender. We discard the message because we do not want to go any further in thought. We trade the difficult teachings of Christ for the easy path of the world.

No, not many will enjoy this movie's message, and some will lose the opportunity to view difficult relationships in a new light. Where we no longer see our opponent as a position, but as a person, made in the image of God, and not to be thrown away.

When a life is over, the question is not only what do I have to show for it, but WHO do I have to show it to?",1340668800,,2397,4.446469248291572
4461838,4,B004S5Y6H6,"The movie arrived within two weeks of my order and it was in very good quality as it had been suggested to be.  I have watched the movie three times now and have found it to be an overall good movie.  I feel it never really directly answers some questions about homosexuality in specifics rather than in general terms.  I did appreciate the showing how though the father is gay he never stopped loving his son and his ex-wife still kept in touch with him.  I feel it is so sad how much of society and people of the church tend to demand that a person be a certain way or they will have no contact with you.  This goes for more areas than just homosexuality. But, back to the movie.  It has some very good characters on both sides of the issue and really lets you grow to see and feel for the persons on both sides and hopefully begin an open dialogue of sharing questions, concerns, feelings and truths about the issue at hand. Glad to see a movie take this angle for once and hope more will tackle it even further.",1327017600,2,1015,4.206185567010309
4461839,2,B004S5Y6H6,"There are some touching moments in this film. It promotes tolerance of those we disagree with. The beautiful part of this film is the truth in the interaction of the father and son, and the son and his father's lover.

However, this film cannot escape the fundamental bias the writer has against homosexuality. The chaplain in the film told the homosexual father and his partner that we cannot pick and choose which verses of the Bible we wish to believe. Hypocritically, that is exactly what the film promotes.

A simple reading of the Bible leaves the reader confused as to its stance on homosexuality (when one lets it interpret itself and not outside sources.) A deeper, exegetical study shows that the Bible says virtually nothing about immutable homosexual identity.

Furthermore, both the Old Testament and the NEW Testament are replete with versus that Christians do not follow and explain away as cultural. Yet when one tries to apply the same standard to dubious verses about homogenital acts, many Christians cry foul.

This film will allow many anti-gay Christians to feel that their beliefs are loving. They would be wrong. Isn't it convenient that the gay father found Jesus just a matter of weeks before his death? If he had years to live, following the trajectory of the plot, he would have have to terminate his relationship with his longtime partner who saw him through great illness. The father would then have had to deal with that loss and loss of his sexual expression. Moreover, he would be left with a sense of failure at being unable to change his orientation.

Many Christians see a tsunami of gay acceptance on the horizon. Unfortunately, this film is an effort to reestablish some people's misguided beliefs against homosexuality as loving and Biblical. They are neither.

In order to find out which verses we should follow, let's ask the Bible. THIS answer is clear, ""For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision has any value. The only thing that counts is faith expressing itself through love....For the entire law is fulfilled in keeping this one command: 'Love your neighbor as yourself.'"" (Galatians 6:14).",1325635200,7,2155,4.988857938718663

8439489,5,B004S5Y6H6,"I like to share my perspective about this movie, that I believe everyone needs to watch.  I read the positive comments and all the critical comments.  hmmmm.  What some take from this movie can be quite confusing for those who are looking for answers.  In some of the comments whether they are positive and critical, you need to see this movie for yourself.  Just like reading the bible and see what the word of God really teaches, and why did God sent His Son to die for us for the atonement of our sins.  What do you think that really means?

God sets the standards, and that standard is perfection.  We were created by God and for God.  Can you truly accept this?  Can you truly accept His perfection?  Do you know, that none of us are righteous, not one?  Did you know that God hates the sin but loves the sinner.  God's salvation plan was to set you free from your sins, if you receive His Son.  So no,  you can never enter heaven with your sins.  Your sins must be washed away from the shed blood of Jesus Christ, is the only way you can be set free from your sins. Not by your good works.  Where will you spend eternity?

When the day you face Almighty God, will He see His Son living inside of you, or will He see you and your good works?  You cannot serve 2 masters.  Jesus said so.  We are all a work in progress, and that is including the man who lived a homosexual life in this movie.  Know the difference, and see this movie.  Very beautiful.  This is about loving one another as Christ loved us.  The truth shall set you Free.  If God does not codone sin, and you are living in sin, don't you want to be free and get to know God who created you to be loved?  Get to know Him.  You will never be sorry.  This movie is not a catalylist for the bible, but it is well explained with such love and sensitivity for all those who struggles with their lifestyle before a living God.  But there is real hope.  Forgiveness and redemption is available for all.  God is so good and He loves you!  Because there is a way out.

Jesus said this in Revelation 3:20 ~  Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears My voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and dine with him, and he with Me.

Think about it and B E L I E V E.  If God's standard is perfection, don't you think we are all doomed?  God made it all possible for you to be delivered and to set you free from your sins through His Son.  Jesus is the only perfect one, because the true spirit of God lives in His Son.  God doesn't accept our sins.  His words are very clear.  We must be very careful putting standards on God.  God is God, and we are not.

for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God
Romans 3:23

True acceptance is about accepting God's Son.  God is about transforming you into the image of His Son.  God wants to see His Son in you.  Do you know the will of God for your life?  Read Romans 12:1-2.  God wants to renew your mind, so you can accept His Will, not yours.  Can you accept this?  I challenge you to watch this movie fully.  But if you are a Christian and you hesitate, please pray first for Jesus to work inside your own heart, and ask Him to reveal the truth to you, what He wants you to understand.  I use this movie as a witnessing tool to reach Christians and others who are not.

I like to make a comment replying to some people's posts on the positive post and the critical post, because I think it is important for everyone to follow the true teachings of Jesus.  This is not all about Christians, nor is it all about homosexuals.  This is about the truth, Jesus walking in love for all sinners.  Walking in truth and love.  You can't have one without the other.

To say to Christians that not all homosexual are going to hell, is a contradiction from the word of God.  The bible is very plain.  There are only 2 places one will spend eternity, that is Heaven or Hell.  Where will you spend eternity?

1 Corinthians 6:9-12 says >  9 Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived. Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor homosexuals, nor sodomites, 10 nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners will inherit the kingdom of God. 11 And such were some of you. But you were washed, but you were sanctified, but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the Spirit of our God.",1523923200,,4401,4.169249106078665

However, the overall impression given in this movie is that homosexuality is an inevitability for some people - I simply can't accept that.
