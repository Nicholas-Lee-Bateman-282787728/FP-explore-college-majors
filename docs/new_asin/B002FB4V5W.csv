Not only were the photos unique and uplifting, but the combination of music and micro photography gave the reception a special touch that my clients really appreciated. I would recommend this for anyone looking for a relaxing yet uplifting visual treat. ""Joy"" DVD is a great name for this!",1248134400,,428,4.876712328767123

I have never seen anything like this.  I also use it at work. The 60 minute DVD provides a relaxing atmosphere in the waiting area.  This makes a great gift for the person who has everything because it is so unique!!!  All the pictures featured on the DVD (and there are over 500) are also available in gallery prints.",1247443200,2,487,4.4772727272727275
