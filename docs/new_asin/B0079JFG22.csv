Bad: very slow, obvious and plodding plot.  The summary makes it seem like there is some mystery they have to solve, anyone over 9 or 10 will immediately recognize the ""Scooby-Doo"" random statements which point to everything the movie is about in the first few minutes.  My oldest two kids walked away it is so boring.",1432512000,,399,4.852941176470588
