4007122,4,B002WJHDIO,"Show Rating: A
Season 1 is a fantastic odyssey of adventure as Jim learns he has an alien living inside his now gigantic head. Dialog, music, plot and pacing are all great.

DVD Rating: B-
Unfortunately this is a barebones release, no extras at all. At least its the complete series. These DVDs worked in 2 out of 3 of the pc dvdrom's i tried them in.

Audio: A
2 Channel audio sounds good.

Video: B-
Jagged lines can be found in the video, same as with the recent Maxx release. If you look closely you can also find a small black border on both sides of the video.

Other Thoughts:
Be sure to check out ('the Head' director) Eric Fogel's short animation 'MUTILATOR' on youtube.",1277337600,,679,4.365079365079365

4007149,5,B002WJHDIO,"I have purchased items from Amazon before, and I must say this is the best purchase yet. I had my doubts because I read one review that said that this particular item was a ""burn on demand"" product. That means that they burn the product to a disc(s), package it, and send it out to you. There is no need to worry. This is not some bootleg you purchase off the street. This product is professionally packaged and is very authentic. I loved many of the shows that came on MTV years ago: Beavis & Butt-Head, Aeon Flux, The Maxx, and The Head is no exception. This is a definite buy for anyone that remembers this show and enjoyed it years ago.",1362528000,2,640,4.254098360655738

I was a customer who got screwed in that field, so i was sorta worried about these when i was purchasing them from amazon and believe it or not, amazon did an amazing job and i am satisfied with it from cover work to disc work to production and quality of every episode on this purchase, i don't even care if the under side is purple and not gold or silver, great work amazon, for anybody reading this, this is fully legitimate copies, do not go anywhere else or you will most likely get screwed, i am a satisfied customer, thank you.",1355270400,2,851,4.31875

4007152,5,B002WJHDIO,"As another reviewer stated, this is as good as it's going to get. All of the torrents I've downloaded were crap VHS rips. While I'm sad that this isn't an official release; the quality and content exceeds anything available on the interwebs -- and I've been searching for YEARS to find a proper copy of this series.

A little pricey given that it's an on-demand burn, but as I stated in my title of this review: beggars can't be choosers.

If you were/are a true fan of this series, you'll buy this -- and like me, be very satisfied with the end result.",1350518400,3,553,4.359223300970874

That said and out of the way, The Head is simply a must have product... weird, wonderful, dry humor with decent animation and an engaging (if somewhat simple) plot. I thoroughly enjoyed every single minute of this show and as I said, it is a decent transfer... definitely the best you are going to get for the foreseeable future.",1322524800,,458,4.4

4007158,3,B002WJHDIO,"This cartoon seemed a lot funnier back in the day... It still provides the odd laugh but the dated and, frankly, crappy animation detracts from it. The voice recording is weak as well.
The outright strange story line and content make it interesting enough to watch. The interaction between the aliens is some of the best humour of the show. It is topped when our band of heros discovers the cover ups and conspiricies that wounded or mutated them. Especially lawn mower blade guy... whatshisname... ""...they knew dammit! They knew!""
Worth a look. Still some fun to watch.",1311120000,,571,4.836734693877551

MTV's Oddities - The Head

This review is similar to the one that I wrote for the MTV's Oddities - The Maxx, seen in the link below

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Maxx-The-Complete-Series/dp/B002WJHDJI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Maxx: The Complete Series</a>

The reason I am writing this review is because, I have been reading the reviews on this item, and they are only so-so, and sometimes, in my opinion, unfair, or unsavory.

People, this is going to be the best version you are most likely EVER going to get.
Yes, this is a burn on demand.
Yes, the discs you are going to get are going to be blue rather than silver.
These are the best burn on demands I have ever seen. The tops of the discs are pro, the packaging is pro.
These go so far as to even have a bar code.
Bottom line, they may as well just be considered official.

This version of The Head has EVERYTHING you will ever need. The episodes are uncut. Within the first 2 episodes I saw things that were NOT on my VHS version.
The Head is a tiny bit more gritty looking than The Maxx, but the show was like that anyway.
Also, unlike The Maxx, the Head is a 3 disc rather than 2.

Amazon has done a great job on this collection, and if other reviews have you thinking against the purchase, DONT. Get them. They are worth it.",1281571200,34,1368,4.655601659751038
4007162,4,B002WJHDIO,"I found this while searching for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Daria-The-Complete-Animated-Series/dp/B0019N8P2W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Daria: The Complete Animated Series</a>&nbsp;on DVD and was pleasantly surprised to find this available. Being from the UK I only recall seeing this on one of our UK cable channels during the late 90's and not MTV itself (at least not that I'm aware of). I was also intrigued by the idea that these discs are available as DVD-R's rather than traditional 'retail' style DVD's with the silver backing.

Upon receiving the set I was quite impressed with the quality of the packaging and also the discs themselves. They look as professional as you would normally buy any other retail DVD, the only significant part being the purple backing showing it was burned onto regular DVD-R.

Sadly one of the discs had failed to read which could be the possible downside of it being on a DVD-R (burn failure maybe?), however Amazon have been amazingly kind to return my money and let me keep the original set while sending me a replacement set at the same time.

As for the DVD itself the quality is great and personally the same type of quality as you would get with any other DVD release. Sure the animation looks slightly primitive, and it even did back then, but keep in mind this was most likely a low budget show to begin with and each episode is only about 10-15 minutes long. It was originally part of an MTV show known as ""MTV Oddities"" which also consisted of the show The Maxx (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Maxx-The-Complete-Series/dp/B002WJHDJI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Maxx: The Complete Series</a>).

Overall a good buy if you were a fan of the show and interesting to have alongside the Beavis & Butt-Head and Daria connections (for those that didn't know Butt-Head made a cameo on the first episode of The Head while on the first episode of Daria a student in the classroom is wearing a The Head shirt with Jim's face on it).",1277596800,4,2063,5.299694189602446
