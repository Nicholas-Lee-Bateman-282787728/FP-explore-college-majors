Things take a turn for the worst as the ghost stories unravel before our team of experts.

There is pretty people,wiccans,skeptics,priests,and techno-geeks that had the tact to pester spirits.

Also the one guy wearing a shirt saying Orgasm donor wasn't too bright.

It's basically a bunch of people who aren't actors and have no other film or t.v. credits speaking lines, as if they were reading the script for the first time around a table. Even the sound and music guy can only claim to have done this.

The older guy, the grandpa, he has a long list of credits doing minor parts in minor productions. Of the others, two can claim roles in ultra low-budget junk for about 2 years (and I mean like this thing and maybe two other productions).

Go check out IMBD for yourself. I don't know how or why this thing was made, but I'm pretty sure a case of beer and a bet were involved.",1460678400,,658,4.173228346456693

4517209,4,B0050PLTE6,"I enjoyed this movie.  The story line was unique and well told. Acting wasn't half bad, music, cinematography, direction were all okay.  Come to think of it, the only thing that I found really special was the philosophy of the investigative group.  They were intelligently gathered, each person with his/her own complimenting skill sets to find the source and get rid of the haunting.

IMHO, paranormal investigators shouldn't go in just to prove/disprove the paranormal; gathering empirical evidence, trying to ""capture"" the spirits via audio/visual/EMF, EVPs, arguing with the spirits so they'll disclose themselves, asking lots of questions, frustrating the spirit and going no further. Some of these PI's basically go in to a place that's haunted, kick a hornets' nest and then run like hell. Very unwise. I believe the idea is to find restless, mischievous. evil or lost spirits and either help them move on, or to send them back.

Some of you may or may not believe in ghosts, and probably think I'm short a few fruity pops, but, I believe in ghosts. I've seen the truth for myself.  First I was an educated disbeliever, then I was a terrified believer, now I'm just an humble observer.

4517220,1,B0050PLTE6,"Usually, in a team of paranormal investigation, everyone are serious during an investigation; no fooling around. The film does not depict how paranormal investigation operates.

Unnecessary BGMs on some scenes and fillers.

Maybe it's just me but exorcism is not as easy as it is depicted in the film. If making a ""found footage"" film, then at least make it realistic.

The film has taken the approach of the found footage and via the more traditional approach of a supernatural horror movie. But in unsuccessful in blending the two approach.

The conflict development and resolution is in shambles. Took too much time on the personal lives of the characters that does not have much to do with the main plot. Instead, the development of the main plot is too little that one would get confuse on what story line is being followed.

Throwing in demons' name inside a story does no necessarily mean a good movie. No back story that is much needed is missing. This movie is like a few information in the beginning about the main plot. The middle part of the movie are fillers. The last end or near end part of the movie is where the ""haunting"" of the main plot is restored.",1433548800,,1169,4.628019323671498
4517221,1,B0050PLTE6,Lame!,1430956800,,5,5.0
4517222,2,B0050PLTE6,"This film consists of 3 episodes. Rayne Morgan (Jessica D. Fulling) leads a group of supernatural researchers which include a priest (Scott Evans) a Wiccan (Renee Wiggins) and a goth (Korin Medina) equipped with special electronics, cameras, and swagger music.

The first episode consists of a young potty mouthed girl who needs a 3 minute exorcism. It was so campy it was funny. Their assistance is needed in a second episode when a poltergeist haunts a home by cleaning things up and stacking items neatly. Seriously? Send that one to my place, please. It uses the dreaded Ouija board as a portal. Yes, it starts out with burning black candles and the next thing you know you're drinking goat's blood with Satan in your living room talking philosophy watching ""South Park"" reruns.

The final episode has a killer spirit named Benjamin who is located in electrical tunnels located under a university.

The acting was bad. The filming is more professional than the found footage type of films. It uses clear multiple camera angles for which there is no camera, so in essence this is a hybrid movie and not an actual found footage film which don't fool anyone...I hope. Not worth watching unless you want a laugh.

Okay, so with that name featured in the movie, the whole point of this movie must be to troll us, to make us think this is just a legitimately awful movie instead of a deliberate disaster. That's what I have to believe. Evidence of a Haunting is THAT bad. Few people besides James Nguyen (Birdemic) or Tommy Wiseau (The Room) can make a movie this bad unintentionally.

This movie is impossible to give a star rating. Like the aforementioned films (Plan Nine, Birdemic, The Room) this movie is hard to give a good rating. Is it a god-awful mess? Absolutely. There's no acting, no plot, no anything of substance. But did I laugh like a hyena at how awful this movie was? I did. So I must have enjoyed it. Somehow.

While it followed the usual ghost hunter genre plot, etc., and the acting was typically stilted, etc., I did find a couple of the characters interesting. Also, the writer seemed to write a script that probably reads very well, but didn't translate to the screen (even a micro budget project). The lead actress (Jessice Fulling) was a bit more interesting, but this genre is just so ""everywhere"" in current moviemaking that is it nearly impossible to produce a truly viable film.

4517237,1,B0050PLTE6,"Awful.  The only reason I got to the end of this disaster is because it was a background movie.  When it was over, I scraped it off the bottom of my shoe.  Amazon Prime customers deserve better than this.  I'm actually considering going back and raising all of the movies I've previously given 1 star to 2 stars.  Evidence of Crap stands alone as a foul stink in the nostrils of humanity.  It's rotten on every level- acting, writing, directing, photography.  I'm often lenient with bad movies, if I see a spark of talent somewhere.  No spark in this festering sore.  Everyone associated with this thing are talentless hacks that have no future in any career that requires talent.

What really kills this movie is that it completely lacks heart.  It's soulless.  Bland like a rice cake.  Why spend my time reviewing this turd.  Two reasons:  First, I have a moral obligation to save others from watching crap like this; and 2) Perhaps one of the talentless hacks involved in this thing will read my review (and the 25 other 1 stars) and realize, ""Hey, I should make no more movies for I am a talentless hack that offends the senses so I had better stop taking movies fans for granted and go find a job that requires no talent.""  ....sad to say that even an assistant manager at McDonalds requires some sort of talent.

So I'll just say I watched it, wasn't completely disappointed. Sure I hoped it would get scarier but it's a paranormal movie so they work with bumps and noises. There were parts that were kinda cool, and parts where I was like well why don't they have this or that. So I knew it had my attention.

EVIDENCE OF A HAUNTING follows the usual template. A team of TV or documentary ghosthunters stumble onto the real thing.

Proving that more money does NOT always mean more quality.

EVIDENCE OF A HAUNTING struggles to find a story. While you have the usual team of documentary ghosthunters investigating the supernatural, most films in this subgenre focus on a specific haunting, or even on the human drama behind the show (e.g.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spirit-Stalkers/dp/B00B4JYJM6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spirit Stalkers</a>). By contrast, EVIDENCE OF A HAUNTING has no story. Its ghosthunters meander aimlessly from haunting to haunting.

The supernatural incidences are poorly written, ineptly staged, performed by a cast of amateur wannabe-actors.

The team includes a psychic, a Wiccan priestess, and a priest (apparently a Catholic), among other ghosthunters, each bringing their own expertise to events. Early in the film, the team investigates a little girl who is apparently demon-possessed. (Ghost-possessed, we later learn, though it makes no difference to the story.)

The girl does the usual Linda Blair impersonation -- bouncing about on a bed while tied to the bedposts, cursing and blaspheming in a typically hoarse ""demonic voice.""

This is the team's FIRST encounter with the girl.

Wiccan Priestess: ""She's obviously possessed.""

Catholic Priest: ""I have no Church sanction for an exorcism. It's out of my hands.""

Girl screams random curses.

Wiccan Priestess: ""We can't wait! She needs our help now!""

Catholic Priest: ""Oh, okay.""

Priest performs an exorcism -- SUCCEEDING after only a few minutes.

Catholic Priest: ""Whew, that was tough one!""

Oh, really? So most exorcisms last seconds rather than mere minutes?

If this were a comedy, that scene might work (except that it's not funny). But as serious horror?

* First off, Catholic priests are under a vow of obedience, serving where they are told. It's unlikely the Church would sanction a priest spending all his time traveling around the country, doing a TV show with pagan ghosthunters.

* Second, no priest would attempt an exorcism until after a lengthy examination process AND until obtaining church sanction (see<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Exorcist/dp/B00AAI7B7W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Exorcist</a>or even<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lost-Souls/dp/B00JMIH5I6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lost Souls</a>, wherein the exorcists obtained a court order).

* Third, real or not, exorcisms are traditionally a lengthy process that can extend for weeks, or even months. Not minutes.

I don't condemn EVIDENCE OF A HAUNTING for this one dreadful scene, but because this scene is typical of the entire film's amateurish ineptitude.

Consider the following scene:

Our team are on to their next investigation, a haunted suburban house. We cut to a shot of a father and two daughters -- STANDING like mannequins in the hallway, LOOKING at the front door, WAITING for the doorbell to ring!

HUH?

After a brief moment, the doorbell rings, and the father and daughters COME ALIVE, approach the front door and answer it. The ghosthunters waiting outside.

HOW did the father and daughters know the ghosthunters were soon to enter? Were they standing in the hall for the past several hours, just staring at the door, waiting for it to ring?

This scene is poorly staged, poorly directed, and poorly edited. The actors portraying the family should have been staged off-camera, as if they were busy living their lives in some other part of the house, and then have them enter the hallway AFTER the doorbell rings. OR that shot, or even the entire intro scene, should have been deleted.

I've seen a LOT of micro-budgeted, indie horror films. I can forgive bland dialog and amateurish acting IF the film is entertaining. Some are. An amateurish but ENTERTAINING piece of crap deserves 2 stars. But this is a BORING piece of crap (i.e., NO redeeming value), which lowers it to 1 star.",1401753600,5,4896,6.099125364431487

* Second, no priest would attempt an exorcism until after a lengthy examination process AND until obtaining church sanction (see<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Exorcist/dp/B00AAI7B7W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Exorcist</a>or even<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lost-Souls/dp/B00JMIH5I6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lost Souls</a>, wherein the exorcists obtained a court order).

* Third, real or not, exorcisms are traditionally a lengthy process that can extend for weeks, or even months. Not minutes.

I don't condemn EVIDENCE OF A HAUNTING for this one dreadful scene, but because this scene is typical of the entire film's amateurish ineptitude.

Consider the following scene:

Our team are on to their next investigation, a haunted suburban house. We cut to a shot of a father and two daughters -- STANDING like mannequins in the hallway, LOOKING at the front door, WAITING for the doorbell to ring!

HUH?

After a brief moment, the doorbell rings, and the father and daughters COME ALIVE, approach the front door and answer it. The ghosthunters waiting outside.

HOW did the father and daughters know the ghosthunters were soon to enter? Were they standing in the hall for the past several hours, just staring at the door, waiting for it to ring?

This scene is poorly staged, poorly directed, and poorly edited. The actors portraying the family should have been staged off-camera, as if they were busy living their lives in some other part of the house, and then have them enter the hallway AFTER the doorbell rings. OR that shot, or even the entire intro scene, should have been deleted.

I've seen a LOT of micro-budgeted, indie horror films. I can forgive bland dialog and amateurish acting IF the film is entertaining. Some are. An amateurish but ENTERTAINING piece of crap deserves 2 stars. But this is a BORING piece of crap (i.e., NO redeeming value), which lowers it to 1 star.",1401667200,,5148,6.2025316455696204

For example, on those shows the voice box gives you a one word sound and of course the investigators come up with a word that closely sounds like it. Here, they actually give you clear words/responses. I'm gonna give this three stars because I actually did enjoy it and don't believe the one and two star comments really add to the conversation.
