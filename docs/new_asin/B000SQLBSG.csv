8206476,5,B000SQLBSG,"I watched this movie with my Mom, Dad and husband when they came for a visit and it held their attention the entire time. Which is saying tons. My Dad NEVER watches movies with us. It was very cute and animated and I can see why people compare it to Amelie. It is just a light hearted feel good movie that is a real break from the norm.",1262908800,2,336,3.9558823529411766
8206477,5,B000SQLBSG,"The film centers around Pod, an average guy who isn't portrayed as special in any way. He moves to the city at the beginning of the film, and starts working at a factory canning sardines. He meets his first friend there, Yod, due to what turns out to be a very funny accident. Then he quits that job and works as a security guard at an office building. He meets a woman named Jin there, and thus the love story begins.
While I could stop the description here, I have to talk about the other characters in the film because they are just as important as the main ones, and add a broader, more universally human element to Citizen Dog than most ""romantic comedies"" have. They're all very funny too, such as Baby M'am, a young girl who thinks she's much older than she is, and has a love/hate relationship with her teddy bear who smokes a lot. Also, there's a taxi driver who loves his job so much, that not even death stops him from going to work. I'm not going to give any more examples because the characters are so creative and likable that it's best to just watch the movie, but The main theme of the film is the search for happiness. It portrays it so poignantly that I feel very few films can compare. It has a style that's emotionally straightforward but it's not annoying like it could have been.  The images presented are expressive and surreal in a very poignant or silly way, and they help express the film's message wonderfully. It seems weird at first, but it quickly starts coming together, and it didn't let me go.",1260403200,3,1526,4.392226148409894

8206479,4,B000SQLBSG,"I love this movie. I didn't really know what to expect before I saw it the first time. What you end up with is a crazy, technicolor collection of vignettes. At its heart though it is a sweet love story. Pod, the protagonist, is a sweet, lovable character, very well-played. His facial expressions are the mark of a very good actor.

As a big fan of Thailand it is always fun to see the country in film. I love to see all of the places in Bangkok where I have been.

This is definitely an arty/indie film that is not for everyone. But if you like oddball, quirky films I think you will enjoy Citizen Dog.",1215648000,8,603,4.189655172413793
8206480,5,B000SQLBSG,"If you liked City of Lost Children or Amelie, you'll love this movie. It's a beautifully shot movie, full of surreal eye candy. Wonderful story about a shy young man named Pod in Bangkok. A must see for anyone who enjoys escapism film elements or wants to be entertained with cleverness.
Check this film out!",1192492800,10,308,4.618181818181818
