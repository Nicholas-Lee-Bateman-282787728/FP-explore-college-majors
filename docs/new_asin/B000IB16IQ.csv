Was not aware that subtitles were not an option.  Normally, I watched movies at home with my three children and need subtitles in English to read when the whole Family is talking. Wish they had said that movie did not have CC
Old movie and it is amazing how slow the movies from past were for the new kid generation, but that was my decision to purchase movie.",1292716800,3,397,4.364864864864865
2654224,1,B000IB16IQ,"There are undoubtedly worse movies -- but this one is certainly pathetic.  A ho-hum plot that, had the actors known how to act, might have been saved, but not one of them, save occasionally Bud Spenser, ever utters a line without it seeming to be read directly from the script in a senior class play.  The color is awful, the babes are cheap and phony, fight scenes are a farce, and despite torrents of bullets no one ever gets hit, to say nothing of killed.  It is sort of a comedy, and sort of an action movie, but mostly it is just a waste.  Imagine, people actually collect Spenser and Hill movies!!  What was it H.L. Mencken is supposed to have said, ""No one ever went broke underestimating the taste of the American public.""?",1237075200,3,731,4.425373134328358
2654225,5,B000IB16IQ,"We loved this movie for a few reasons. It's a little different from the usual slapstick antics of these two. This movie is almost completely sans slapstick and has none of the silly humor of some of the others. It has a solid baseline plot and story and is pretty good in terms of content. Drop dead gorgeous Trinity and adorable lovable Bambino team up to bring down the bad guys and help save their chief from certain ""framed"" disgrace. The introduction is typical of the style of many of these movies, complete with cheesy disco theme music. Quality of the DVD is not particularly good. This includes some 'frozen' moments and tone varying from orange fading back into color. The dubbing for Bambino is not the best. Here the boys actually use and fire guns, quite a difference from their preferred and more gentle use of just fisticuffs.  All this aside, we just love to watch these two, and this movie is a definite recommend for Trinity collectors.",1224547200,10,954,4.644970414201183

8144677,1,B000IB16IQ,"I bought this English-language version of Miami Super cops to add one more movie of this duo to my collection; video quality is terrible, no DVD quality, VHS rip, and not from a good source, it's blurry, has grainy picture, poor resolution, black spots, colors bleed, main menu extremely simple and from a still pic that shows the type of video quality you don't expect from a DVD, and of course it has to be region-free, and the ""manufacturer"" adds a bar code on the back to probably test consumer's intelligence in a shameless failed attempt to make it look presentable; which it wouldn't bother much if at least the product had some quality. Great movie, but Amazon should ban these products from their website, I bet Hill and Spencer are not getting paid royalties for this subpar pirates. Hopefully this movie will be released in the future with the proper DVD or BR treatment it deserves.",1406160000,3,894,4.7006369426751595
8144678,5,B000IB16IQ,"Great movie! Love these guys, need I say more! I finally found this movie in the English language because the famous title name-Miami super cops is in foreign language only( Italian & german)! Don't really get why it's like that but letting all you terence hill-bud spencer fans know!",1391731200,2,284,4.816326530612245
8144679,5,B000IB16IQ,i was hopping for his classic funny act but this one kinda takes it down a knotch but still worth getting,1389312000,,105,4.0476190476190474
