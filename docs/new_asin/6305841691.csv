7896908,5,6305841691,"In this reworking of Taming of the Shrew, Pedro Infante and Marga Lopez shine as two people who love to hate each other, then hate to love each other, while pride and stubbornness keep their heads from admitting what their hearts both know. The plot is about Victoria (Lopez) and Manuel (Infante), who to comply with a will, must marry each other. Director Rene Cardona co-stars as  Don Manuel, who is Victoria's father and Manuel's godfather, and he finally has to manipulate circumstances to get the squabbling pair together. A great cast surrounds them, with the ever funny ""El Chicote"" Armando Soto as Manuel's sidekick Tepalcate, and Alejandro Cangherotti as Ernesto, the town doctor (for both human and animal patients) who is madly in love with Victoria.

Chucho Monge wrote the score, and there are six wonderful songs, some of them with Infante's marvelous ""Mariachi Shout,"" and one of them a female serenata with the Hermanas Julian backing Marga Lopez, The lovely cinematography by Jack Draper still looks good considering the age of the film, however the audio has deteriorated a little, but is helped by raising the volume, and no subtitles are available. There are many hilarious scenes as the antagonists play dastardly tricks on each other, like gift-wrapping a great big live rat, and this is another of Infante's romantic comedies that is a 100% winner. El Idolo de Guamuchil lives forever in his many heartwarming films, that are filled with love and laughter.",1176595200,3,1479,5.008130081300813
