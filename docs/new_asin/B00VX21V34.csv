8711520,4,B00VX21V34,"I like the Lost World and Return to the Lost World, so I'm very happy with this set and the price.  BUT, if you want the full-length (250 minutes) version of Dinotopia, DON'T BUY THIS SET!!!!  They've chopped out so many little parts that I didn't even finish watching it. I probably won't even watch Journey to the Center of the Earth.  I only watch the Pat Boone and Brendan Frasier versions of that movie.",1467590400,3,408,4.413333333333333
