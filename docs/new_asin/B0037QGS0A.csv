4081617,3,B0037QGS0A,"Many will disect this movie such as the stuffy reviews above but in the end it is not IMHO a very satisfying film. In the end I did not care for any of the characters with the possible exception of Moore's character. She knows her life, marriage, and family are  in need of repair.
A well to do dysfunctional family that in the end we feel so little for. Perhaps this is what Egoyan wanted us to feel, lost, confused ....and in Toronto to boot (to boot CDN expression).
Wouldn't this have done better in California ? eh!

Neeson plays and looks wooden. I believe Neesons wife NR died while this was being filmed.

Moore does the best with what she has.
Moore is an attractive, older mature woman that has much to offer given the right role.

Could this be Seyfried's first major adult role so far. She does show a bit of flesh as so does Moore.

This is probably Egoyans most commercial film so far. Wait for the DVD.

I would rather sit through several showings of Groundhog Day. Now, that's redemption over and over again :)",1272067200,5,1026,4.373684210526315
4081618,4,B0037QGS0A,"Canadian director Atom Egoyan's newest feature is the first that he didn't also write, and at first glance looks to be far and away his most conventional and accessible film.  The fact that it's produced by Ivan Reitman, the man behind such 80s and 90s blockbusters as the GHOSTBUSTERS films and TWINS certainly wouldn't seem to contradict that notion, but appearances can be deceiving; though the film is certainly on the surface a ""simpler"" film than Egoyan's previous work, and does have a more focused and clear-cut narrative than most of his other films, deep at it's core it belongs very much in their company, and the more one thinks about it, the less clear and obvious it becomes.

The film opens with a brief bit of narration by the title character (Amanda Seyfried), a high-priced escort working a wealthy area in downtown Toronto.  She describes how she makes fantasies come true by becoming in essence whatever is wanted - not just in appearance, but in personality and character.  We quickly shift to Catherine Stewart (Julianne Moore), a gynecologist with an office in the same area, watching Chloe get into a car.  Stewart has a husband, David (Liam Neeson), a music professor and pretty serious flirt, and it's David's birthday and Catherine has a big surprise party planned for him.  But David is flying home from New York and misses his flight, which upsets Catherine and also sets her radar off.  A quick spy of a message left on his phone leads her to wondering if he's having an affair, and it doesn't help matters any that their teenage son Michael (Max Thieriot) is also getting more action than she is, bringing a girl home to sleep over without his mother knowing about it.

So Catherine wants to make sure about her suspicions before confronting David, and decides to get someone to seduce him, finding Chloe at the bar in the hotel near her office.  They had earlier met in a ladies' room at an expensive restaurant, with Chloe dropping a comb for Catherine to pick up - and Chloe thinks that it's Catherine she's supposed to service at first.  Or does she?  The major element in CHLOE the film that remains mysterious and ""Egoyanesque"" is that we are never - even at the dramatic ending - entirely clear about Chloe the character's motivations or honesty.  She agrees to seduce David - but she then goes farther than Catherine wants.  She calls Catherine at odd times; she finds Michael and follows him; and she takes advantage of Catherine's own loneliness and isolation and eventually seduces her as well.  But what she doesn't seem to realize - and perhaps Catherine herself doesn't realize for a time - is that Chloe isn't her fantasy; her husband is - and she acts that out through Chloe as her way of being closer to the man she's estranged from.  But at this point Chloe has allowed the fantasy to take her over as well, and unlike Catherine, who eventually is able to confront David and start to understand what's really going on, she seems to have no-one, and nothing to ground her, and starts to spin far out of control.

The critic Jonathan Rosenbaum wrote a short piece about this on his website - the only criticism of the film I've read - and mentioned that many other critics had, he felt, misinterpreted the film and didn't get what it is really about, which is a woman's midlife crisis.  I have to say that anybody who can't see how that is the subject of this film probably shouldn't be a professional film critic; it's obvious within the first ten minutes and remains the central issue of the film throughout.  I suppose it would be easy to call it an inversion of FATAL ATTRACTION, and certainly there are some points in common with that film and other ""erotic thrillers"" that tend to be about men who stray and the consequences they face; but CHLOE, apart from an ending that I thought was needlessly obvious and predestined, is much more concerned with exploring the inner reality of it's protagonist's mind - much more interested in getting at how the accumulation of years of work and neglect of a love life can lead to this place where one party would suspect the other, without really trying to understand either why the other might stray - or why she might think he would.  In the end it's a fine examination of suppressed emotions and sexuality that ends up concluding that men and women are not all that different when it comes to such things - not nearly as different as they think they are; and the fact that we still think we're so different is half the problem.

The cast is terrific, with Moore proving again that she's one of the very best actresses of her generation as a wife and mother in absolute turmoil, trying to keep herself together but letting it out only very slowly and reluctantly, and Seyfried showing some real ability in the difficult role of an overly emotional cipher.  Neeson has less to do but he excels at being the chaming rogue and he's certainly convincing enough as the potential adulterer - and the wounded, wrongly accused victim (maybe).  The fancy, elegant settings, costumes and trappings of the film might seem a little overdone at first - but I think the point ultimately is that the material world means very little to anybody in the film when their hearts are wounded and their minds are racing to discover what is going wrong - and who is doing the wrong to them.  And all the money and fancy careers in the world can't prevent a heart from straying.

The ending, as I said, seems a bit too conventional and simple to me, but on the whole Chloe is very solid work, and probably my favorite Egoyan film of the last decade or more.",1271116800,3,5628,4.61061061061061
4081619,4,B0037QGS0A,"Atom Egoyan's new film Chloe tells a story that's been told many times before, the tale of the woman scorned. But the new perspective that Egoyan brings to the erotic thriller genre, that makes it more original and provocative than any film I've seen this year.

Julianne Moore's portrayal of the heroine, Catherine Stewart, is near perfect. Moore has really been at the top of her game lately. In A Single Man, she played a character that she also brought great depth to, despite having only about fifteen minutes of air-time. In Chloe, she plays an upper middle-class gynecologist, who has been married to David (Liam Neeson) for many years. She suspects that he's having an affair, after noticing his flirtacious banter with a waitress, and after missing a flight, and his surprise birthday party. And just like that, her long simmering suspicions rise to the surface.

Finding no answer other than infidelity, she hires an escort, played by Amanda Seyfried, in the title role, to seduce her husband, to see his reaction. She finds herself ""directing"" she and her husband's encounters, giving Chloe notes on how to react to certain things that her husband says and does. Ergo, the fireworks start, and needless to say, lies are told and people get hurt.

This is Julianne Moore's best work in years. She has a knack for giving emotionally devastating performances, and she's in top form here. Her ability to say so much with saying so little, never ceases to amaze me. But the true star here is Amanda Seyfried, who gives the performance of her career. Her repertoire includes mostly comedies, like Mean Girls and Mamma Mia, but the amount of dramatic depth that she brings to the table is unbelievable. Playing a complicated character, you never know what her next move is, and it's interesting to see where it goes, ultimately until the earth-shattering conclusion. Seyfried's large, expressive eyes, tell you what her character is going through, and it's another case, where so much is said, when so little is actually spoken. The supporting cast, of course, includes Liam Neeson, who is always excellent, as Catherine's philandering husband, and he essentially does his job. There's not a whole lot of room in this picture, for his character to evolve. More attention is paid to the female leads.

What separates this from the countless stories of mistrust and infidelity, is the eerie and surprisingly profound tone that Egoyan brings to the table. It's a very mature, classy, smart film that deals with trust, loyalty, and love, and how, after so long, love can vanish, and an emotion can take over that you never would have expected to feel. And plus the settings are gorgeous. Jim Lambie, the set decorator of films like Heaven on Earth, and Egoyan's Adoration, brings a modern sense of traditionalism to the look of the film, especially the main setting of the Stewart household. And, also, the score, masterfully composed by Mychael Danna, brings out so much emotion, and tension to the table. Shattering orchestra crescendos, in pivotal scenes, bring more feeling, and intensity to the overall tone of the picture.

But, in the end, it's Egoyan's patient and thoughtful pacing, and an excellent performance by Amanda Seyfried that really stand out. It's a very mature, intricate experience that takes its time with developing each character, and brings a stunning conclusion that sets it apart from other stories of its kind. Its portrayal of lust and erotic desire, and the vulnerability of love, itself, will leave you breathless. Egoyan's use of an elegant, gliding camera, traps his characters against windows and mirrors, to signify how trapped a person can feel in their own life. And Egoyan's ability to never tell a story on one level, and his knack for adding layer, after layer to each character, makes the effect that the film has all the more effective.",1270252800,112,3879,4.9523809523809526

4081661,3,B0037QGS0A,"This was a physical rental for me.

I was disappointed. I have seen several films by the director and always found them refreshingly different from the standard Hollywood fare. More individual and often quite sensuous.

""Chloe"" has a great cast and looks really good. But I found the rhythm to be off somehow. I confess I needed to finish it over several nights as it was really draggy. Also domestic and sort of unpleasant in its depiction of an overheated mid-life crisis for the central couple. Pretty cold-blooded.

The feature on the ""Making Of"" was quite interesting and more enjoyable than the film itself! I did not  bother with the commentary as I rarely find them essential.",1485043200,,684,4.82051282051282

4081664,3,B0037QGS0A,"I liked this film but I felt that it could have been done a little better. All of the characters were very well-developed and also believable. These are people you could meet in real life and you would really like them and want to be their friends (Even The Call Girl).

But in my opinion the movie moved a bit too slow. Not only that but the premise of hiring a call girl to attempt to seduce one's husband is far-fetched. There are legitimate organizations that do that job and they would not dare blackmail their client or ""fall in love"" with tem and/or their family. What organizations, you ask? Private Investigators specialize in this profession. Thus had Catherine simply gone to a licensed Private Detective none of the bad things she would subsequently experienced would have happened.

I'm the 280th person to review this film and the 48th to give it Three Stars. This type of film has been done before (Fatal Attraction, Body Chemistry & Unfaithful) and while I love the overall premise of the film I still think it might have been better made. For instance, we never learn if Liam Neeson's character was in fact cheating or if the girl named Chloe was making up the whole thing in order to seduce Catherine. And why would a blonde, buxom white woman want to commit suicide? Like wealthy men, she is considered to be the apex woman. Sexy, desirable and beautiful. She could have had any man at her feet whether she was a call girl or not.

I marginally recommend this film if one is a fan of erotic thrillers. However, there are better films out there. Check out Lower Level (If You Can Still Find It) and Body Chemistry.

4081687,4,B0037QGS0A,"Chloe isn't a bad film, it starts off as your usual paranoid wife who also is having problems with her son, who decides the best way to deal with this is to hire a young good looking prostitute to run into her husband, flirt with him and see what happens. What happens, well it's best to leave that for you to discover as there isn't a lot of depth or plot beyond that to this movie. But let's just say if you are looking into this one because you like either Julianne Moore or Amanda Seyfried, well you'll see a lot of them in the movie Chloe.

Chloe is predictable in parts, has one of the oddest designed houses you'll ever see where you can look from one part of the house into the bedroom of another through glass walls. Those who get offended by sex scenes probably want to look for a different DVD too. Also has Liam Neeson and the guy who plays Norman's brother in Bates Motel (Max Thieriot).",1466812800,,900,4.232558139534884

4081701,2,B0037QGS0A,"Thief!  Plot is stolen from the 2003 French film Nathalie by Anne Fontaine with Emmanuelle Beart and Fanny Ardant.  In that film the plot was secondary (to my eyes anyway) to the exposure of Ms Beart (somewhat limited exposure), one of the most beautiful woman to ever appear in any film.  Thus, as this movie (Chloe) is only so-so at best, and it does not have any actress that even remotely approaches Ms Beart's beauty - it is gravely disappointing!

So, forget this insignificant movie.  Instead search for and view, if you can find a copy, of Jacques Rivette's La Belle Noiseuse (The Beautiful Pain-in-the-Ass) with Emmanuelle Beart, Jane Birkin and Michel Piccoli.  This 1990 film is in French, make sure your version has ENGLISH subtitles as several versions do not (you may also need a PAL converting DVD player, but there is a Region 1 version).  It is about the agony of artistic creation and it allows full exposure of Ms Beart.  This is a four hour movie, but it goes by fast and at the end you will wish that you could spend more time with the movie's characters.  Michel Piccoli plays the artist (this is his best performance); Jane Birkin is the artist's wife and past muse; Emmanuelle Beart is the artist's model and present muse. It is Rivette's best movie (it is also his most conventional movie), even better than his more acclaimed masterpiece Celine and Julie go Boating.  Unfortunately it is very rare and very expensive; however it is also a great bargain as you will get more for your money than ever before.  While Ms Beart was very beautiful, her performance was also excellent as was Ms Birkin's.  Rivette is sometimes considered to be an experimental director and as such, to me, his characters are often stiff and unrealistic.  He is also considered to be a ""women's"" director (whatever that means).  But with La Belle Noiseuse he is at his best, handling his actors and the filming with perfection.  See this movie and you will understand relativity; four hours will fly by.",1462665600,,2004,4.718390804597701

4081742,3,B0037QGS0A,"CHLOE is a very implausible movie, but it has a classy sheen and some high-class actors.  It comes from director Atom Egoyan, so it has artsy overtones.  But at its heart, it is trashy fun, almost in the FATAL ATTRACTION vein.

Julianne Moore is a tightly wound OB/GYN, married to handsome music professor Liam Neeson.  The two have built a good life on the surface, but they have a troubled teenage son (Max Theriot, later from TV's BATES MOTEL) and are no longer physically close.  Moore is convinced her husband is having an affair, and she hires a prostitute (Amanda Seyfried) to make the moves on her husband, to see if he responds.  It's a dangerous game and Moore finds that this relationship between her husband and the hooker seems to bring her closer, erotically, to her husband.  While all the characters have roughly the same screentime, this is really Moore's movie, and she does a solid job (as always) balancing between her dismay at her arousal and being drawn further into these unfamiliar feelings.  I've deliberately kept this a bit vague, because I don't want to spoil the various entanglements that ensue.  But as I said, she's playing a dangerous game with her own emotions and the emotions of others.  It all culminates in a bit of an over-the-top climax, but it does come somewhat full-circle.

Not only is Moore good, but Seyfriend is beguiling.  I wouldn't say she gives a great performance, and her character is far too ""wise"" in knowing the secret hearts of others...but if we look at this film as more of a psycho-sexual thriller and less of a drama, her performance makes more sense.  Neeson is solid.  And Atom Egoyan, whose SWEET HEREAFTER and EXOTICA are great movies, does do a good job of giving the film a sense of being more important and having more to say than it really does...but it's really entertainment first and thoughtful a distant second.

If I could, I'd give the film 3.5 stars.  It's worth seeing, I think, but not something you should drop everything for.  It's a very adult movie, obviously, and does have a few graphic scenes and some graphic language.  But it is good, clean, ""dirty"" fun.",1438992000,,2142,4.697050938337801

The story line was a bit sketchy, and hard to follow exactly and so I found it, (the story line and ultimate 'plot') hard to follow, and was left asking more questions than one should have to.  Wasn't quite sure if the story was about 'chloe' or the the other characters. it was 'far' from being in any way erotic and was rather dull throughout. Her 'business', (chloe's) really had nothing to do 'with pleasure' but was a study in someone who was basically mentally off and interested in manipulating others. So the end was rather melodramatic between the hubby and wife in relation to 'chloes' part in all of this. basically, the movie had a lot of potential but lacked terribly in plot and substance. the director was 'afraid' to go places and this throttled the thrill and involvement this picture 'could have had'.",1415318400,,931,4.608433734939759

Seriously though, I am somewhat puzzled as to the significance of the hairpin at the end.  Does it indicate she did indeed care for Chloe, or does it heighten erotic excitement in her relationship with the husband?  Is it a reminder or self-punishment of some sort to keep her on the straight (no pun intended) and narrow path henceforth?

The one day she meets a young call girl named Chloe (Amanda Seyfried) and decides to hire her for a very peculiar mission... Nothing more will be said.

This film being a remake of a French erotic thriller (""Natalie"", made in 2003) we can reasonably expect that there will be some kinky and also steamy moments and yes, there are some, but ultimately not that much. I never saw the French version but for me the main appeal of this American remake was a study of tensions growing and vulnerabilities appearing in a long lasting and mostly happy marriage between two people who are aware of approaching old age. This is a hard moment in life and many marriages are then greatly tested - and not all survive...

Liam Neeson has less screen time than the girls (and there is a good reason for that, but no, no more spoilers), so this film is mostly carried by the good performances of Julianne Moore and Amanda Seyfried.

It is by no means a mastepiece, but a honest, solid film, which I would rate four stars if it was not for the very disappointing ending, which seemed hastily made and completely artificial. So only three stars.

I rented this film rather than buying it and I am glad that I did it, because this is really a thing to see once. Enjoy - but do not expect too many fireworks.",1396569600,,1464,4.513207547169811

4081823,4,B0037QGS0A,"As a thriller or a study of sexuality, it didn't work particularly well for me. But as an examination of the inner lives of women at different stages of their lives, along with the pathetically touching attachment the younger woman develops for the older, it succeeds.

Catherine is mature, sophisticated, accomplished and well off. Chloe is young, beautiful, sensual and desired.  Each has what the other is lacking. And each is lonely, isolated and emotionally abandoned. A game begins between them when Catherine hires Chloe to seduce her husband and culminates in a passionate encounter.

But when Catherine realizes she has gone too far, she simply writes the younger woman a check, as if she can write her out of her perfect life. Here is where the power and class difference comes into play. Catherine seemingly holds all the cards, but does she really?

The film is Hollywoodized, but Egoyan, whose Sweet Hereafter has haunted me for years after seeing it, gives the script some nuanced layering. The young girl, Chloe, is played with touching emotional vulnerability by Seyfried. Even when she is pulling a con, she is so needy and so eager to please. We don't know anything about her, except that she tries to give Catherine a hair pin which ostensibly belonged to her mother and that she always tries to find something to love in all of her clients. Hmmmm.

 Who is using whom, who is most awakened, who has suffered the consequences of their relationship are questions that linger afterward. It's far from being Egoyan's best work but thanks to the excellent performances, it is fairly enjoyable.",1390608000,5,1608,4.915129151291513

We're not exactly sure just what Neesen is doing or what Seyfried will discover, but we know that Moore is determined to dig up the truth even if she has to cross a few lines to get it. Moore is at the top of her field in subtle facial expressions which convey the complexity of emotions she goes through, and may have gone too far in searching for the truth. Whatever, the three main characters must interact with each other under various definitions of what is really going on at the surface, below the surface, and at the primordial animal level of human existence.

4081849,3,B0037QGS0A,"Infidelity, temptation, fatal attraction -- it's always something people love to hear about, especially if all three elements are together.

And they certainly are in ""Chloe,"" a strange little movie that centers around a very confusing little triangle. Atom Egoyen crafts the movie as a more modern, elegant, art-house version of the 1980s erotic thriller, with beautiful direction and a powerful pair of central performances, but the second half begins descending into Hollywood melodrama.

Gynecologist Catherine Stewart (Julianne Moore) seems to have the perfect life, especially in her marriage to hunky professor David (Liam Neeson). But his constant flirting, a missed flight and a suspicious photo leads her to suspect that he's cheating -- and on impulse, she hires a beautiful prostitute named Chloe (Amanda Seyfried) to tempt David, then report back to her.

Chloe goes off to flirt with David, and reports the secret sexual encounters back to Catherine... who finds them kind of a turn-on. And rather than confronting David, she continues meeting with Chloe in secret, even as her attraction to the strange young woman grows. But at the same time, Chloe's obsession with Catherine is growing to dangerous levels.

""Chloe"" is apparently based on a French movie called ""Nathalie..."", or at least the first half of it seems to be. It's not a surprising revelation, because it feels more like a French movie than an American one -- the story centers around a woman hiring an innocent-looknig young prostitute, and it proceeds in a much more elegant, restrained way than other erotic thrillers.

And Egoyan crafts every scene with care, wrapping the actors in symbolic light and shadow. He also draws out some wonderfully complicated characters, who are neither hero nor villain, and whose thoughts often go unsaid. Unfortunately, the second half starts to deteriorate into melodrama as soon as David starts suspecting Catherine of having an affair. People start yelling and getting overwrought, and having dramatic scenes that don't seem to lead into anything.

Julianne Moore gives a wonderfully nuanced performance here -- she starts off cool and implacable, but cracks in her mask appear as she spends more time around Chloe. Eventually everything about her seems to collapse, and all her misery and insecurity floods out. Seyfried also gives a glorious performance here as a doe-eyed young prostitute whose motivations are left a mystery. Is Chloe a cruel manipulative femme fatale? Is she just unhealthily crushing on an unavailable woman? Or is the truth a bit of both?

However, Liam Neeson's performance is... weird. Atypical. He feels like he's absent mentally. But I blame neither him nor Egoyan for that, since apparently Neeson's wife unexpectedly died during the movie's filming. It's amazing he was able to do this at all.

""Chloe"" is an interesting twist on the erotic thriller -- it's an elegant, intricate story about what human passions become once aroused, but it comes unraveled in the second half.",1364774400,,3025,5.209876543209877

4081852,5,B0037QGS0A,"I came at this film knowing nothing about it except what I read on the back jacket and that it included the incredible actress Amanda Seyfried (pronounced Zi- freed). Man, what a ride. Seyfried plays a quirky prostitute that really aims to please.  That pleasing is focused on the seemingly dejected wife of Liam Neeson, Julianne Moore. Rarely do you see a film that can capture eroticism with such accuracy. The film is art in motion. The trio of Seyfried, Mooore and Neeson portray real people with believable emotions and desires that raise raw sexuality to true everyday existence. The couples teenage son also adds a fresh approach to intimate encounters.

The term ""erotic thriller""  really hits the mark as Seyfried walks a tightrope that envelopes you with thrills and chills. Her body is made for the cinema. Liam Neeson does not typically play the confused husband role but handles in deftly while Moore reveals the amazing range of her acting abilities.

Both Liam and Julianne feel dangerously anemic in their performances leaving us with Amanda who now has two films with this one that leave me with little confidence in her ability to hold a story together. Too much background music and let's not forget the lackluster chemistry between the two women leaving us with a sex scene that is supposed to be much more intimate then it actually comes off as being. The bottom line is: Unfaithful still holds the ultimate standard as far as I am concerned in movies that tackle infidelity with all of the consequences psychological and physical that go with it.

4081865,5,B0037QGS0A,"Though perhaps ironically so, as it's not his screenplay.  This brilliant film explores a love triangle, of sorts, but does so from a decidedly odd perspective.  Working for the first time in his career from someone else's writing (Erin Cressida Wilson's) the film is still infused with Egoyan's usual elements and obsessions.  But what's attracted me to this film is that, unlike some of his others (Exotica comes to mind), the plot actually all adds up.  No one's behaving in ways that don't make sense in retrospect, just to support the dream-like feel of the narrative.  The ending - in a single, heartbreaking image - reveals Julianne Moore's Catherine to be every bit the cold, heartless woman who could do the things she's done throughout the course of the film, without any idea that she'd done anything wrong.  Liam Neeson's David is the man who's still married to her, and who still loves her, but who isn't all that anxious to get home every night after work.  He's as good in this as he usually is, which is to say he's very good.  Max Thieriot as their son Michael is similarly solid and believable, but it's Amanda Seyfried's turn as the enigmatic Chloe that makes this a stand-out.  Essentially her first 'grown-up' role, she delivers a performance that is so raw and desperate - under a facade of absolute control - that at times it's almost embarrassing to watch.  This is definitely one of the best films on the resume's of all of the artists involved.",1357776000,,1470,4.70703125

4081870,3,B0037QGS0A,"As with ""Where the Truth Lies"" (2005) Atom Egoyan's other recent, well-funded and half-convincing outing with Big Names (Colin Firth and Kevin Bacon, there), here he again tries his hand at a commercial hit. With ""Chloe"" (2009) he turns out a movie that's well-acted, often easy on the eye, and never inept, yet one that's marred by often absent direction and a poorly realized story.

Discomfiting, hidden passions are something of an Egoyan specialty, with highly charged child-women a near fixation. This outing is true to form. He also manages fairly well here with soft-core titillation - in a scene between Julianne Moore and the waif-like yet sensuous Amanda Seyfried. Still (as is also true of ""WTL""), sharp, dramatic pacing is sorely absent - a major flaw in a suspense film. It's easy to imagine a couple of crux scenes that Egoyan sleepwalks through in ""Chloe"" faring so much better in the crafty hands of a Hitchcock. (My advice, Atom? Do like DePalma: copy the master till your own way takes shape!)

The plot is also incompletely developed: [spoiler alert to come: be warned] there's simply no plausible reason in the film for the way Seyfried's character behaves, for the fixation at the root of her elaborate construct of lies. Had she been directed to glance furtively at Moore as she spins out her stories, or had Moore been shown as anything beyond hurt, jealous, puzzled, yet always plain ordinary, things might fit in place so much better. Had it been Monica Belluci in the Moore part; or if something, anything, had been infused into the script to show that mortals trip over themselves for a glance as she, the Moore character, passes - this, too, might have done. In any case, we are left to fill in this key void, since Egoyan does not ...yet not in any way that intrigues.

Some musical prodigies who launch too early, without a full array of chops, often turn out seductive, yet only middling successes and watch their promising careers slowly fizzle out. (A still-youngish Canadian cellist who was recording and being highly praised in the `70s/80s comes readily to mind) Both of Egoyan's mentioned movies convey something along such lines. His wunderkind, albeit quirky successes (Exotica, The Sweet Hereafter) recommend him as a safe bet for producers. And much, in fact, does work well in his movies: they can't rightly be called unpolished, unimaginative or less than professional. But the mentioned gaps lurk beneath this veneer, hinting at that incomplete palette and an apprenticeship terminated a bit soon. Perhaps Egoyan would have gained from directing a string of TV police shows, or with some commercial-making under his belt, before trying his hand at these two recent dramas. (No put-down intended: Sam Peckinpah created and directed TV's The Rifleman; Norman Jewison directed TV fare through the 1950s; FF Coppola apprenticed under Roger Corman, the king of cheapo cult films).

Seyfried's eerie beauty has a Bette Davis-like magnetism, and who knows if even her talent. Still, we'll have to wait for a better vehicle to bring them out. Meantime, her name may just possibly come to naught while her looks, and her stunning stare, are exploited in slick but flawed fare like this.

4081876,3,B0037QGS0A,"""Chloe"" (2009) directed by Atom Agoyan is the remake of the French film Nathalie... (2003) made by Anne Fontaine with Fanny Ardant, Emmanuelle Bart, and Grard Depardieu, as three participants of erotic thrilling psychological drama. Chloe follows the Nathalie's footsteps quite closely. The difference is in the final act, and I prefer Nathalie's ending. All Atom Agoyan and the rest of Chloe's creators had to do to make it a truly great movie -was just to remake step by step the French original. The most amazing thing about Nathalie... was its palpable erotic tension on the screen and at the same time, the lack of steamy sex scenes which was more than compensated with the subtle communication between two women, older, Catherine and younger, Nathalie and between Catherine (Ardant) and her husband of many years (Depardieu) whom she still loves but does not know anymore how to make them both happy.

Both movies run almost the same time, French film - 100 minutes, and North American -96 but I prefer the intelligent, insightful, nuanced, implying and not shoving in your face the sensational fatal attraction ending film Nathalie. It is not to say that Chloe is worthless. It is gorgeous to look at, and three main actors, Julian Moore, Liam Neeson, and Amanda Seyfried all gave very good performances. The young Amanda Seyfried was a very worthy screen partner to Juliana Moore who can do no wrong to me. I was especially impressed by Amanda's face and how it changes from young and innocent to sexy and seductive, resentful, dangerous in a course of seconds. The problem of Chloe is its script which goes weak and out of breath in the final part. The final of Chloe makes me think that the authors of the film don't trust their audiences and feed us with sex, melodrama, and very unsatisfying a la fatal attraction climax because they are afraid we don't get the subtleties that made the original film so thrilling.

Another problem I have with Chloe is the character of Catherine and David's son, Michael. He existed in the French film but on the background. In Nathalie, he left his parents' house and from what I could judge, he had quite normal relationship with them which allowed the plot to concentrate primarily on the unusual and quite fascinating relationship between Catherine and the call girl Nathalie whom she hired to find out if her husband cheats on her and what he actually expects from a woman. In the film Chloe, the character of Michael was annoying, and in the end his only purpose was to justify unsatisfying final act of the film.

4081877,4,B0037QGS0A,"When she suspects her husband David (Neeson) of infidelity, Catherine Stewart (Moore) hires a hooker called Chloe (Seyfried), whose task is to test David's faithfulness and report back to Catherine. Of course, as in real life, things don't always turn out as planned.

Like Egoyan's masterpiece ""Exotica,"" but to a lesser extent than that film, ""Chloe"" underscores how perception and reality are often not the same. There are sufficient surprises and tension, especially sexual tension, throughout the movie to keep the viewer's eyes nailed to the screen. There is also symbolism aplenty. For example, the recurring appearance of glass doors, mirrors, windows, and other glass objects represents the inherent fragility of free will: Glass is a brittle, transparent material through which one can readily see, but in ""Chloe"" it serves as an ironic contrast to the characters' shortsightedness, their inability to foresee the consequences of their actions.

While the plotline may be standard fare, for Egoyan it is no obstacle. His gift lies in his uncanny ability to elicit strong emotions from the viewer, without resorting to sentimentality, and to appeal to the intellect as well. These attributes are the stuff of art, and they are masterfully achieved in ""Chloe"" through a combination of first-rate acting, a taut script, wonderful cinematography, and a superb film score.

The 1.85:1 Blu-ray picture is top-notch. Colors are rich yet natural. Clarity and detail are exceptional in both interior and exterior locations. Nighttime shots reveal ample picture depth, solid blacks, and good shadow detail. I found myself longing for more lingering shots of the wintry Toronto cityscape, conveyed here in a serene, quiet manner redolent of the sublime snowy scenes in Egoyan's ""The Sweet Hereafter."" Dialogue and ambient sound are clean and crisp, and the soundtrack, consisting largely of Mychael Danna's dreamy, soulful music, comes through with great clarity.

In sum, ""Chloe"" is an engaging and poignant symbol-rich thriller that warrants more than one viewing; it is also a fine antidote to the plethora of vapid films being churned out these days.",1333065600,2,2153,5.3609467455621305

Instead, Chloe is a film about secrets between people and the rocky relationships between families. On the downside Chloe does have some minor campy elements to it but that just makes it more of a guilty pleasure. And Amanda Seyfried and Julianne Moore are very charming in their roles.

[...]

Most professional critics don't like the ending of ""Chloe"" because they think it's a stereotypical appeasement of the American audience's prudish desire to see sexual promiscuity punished.

Do not be deceived. One day I was reading a criticism by la de dah film critic Frank LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle.  He liked the movie, but he too objected to the ending on the same grounds, so I showed him the above website to see what he thought, but he didn't buy it.  However, the similarities were compelling enough to where he forwarded my e-mail to the script writer, Erin Cressida-Wilson, who informed him that she never heard of Freud, although the similarities were ""VERY interesting.""  So, I had to admit I was wrong.  However, I decided to make sure by showing the similarities to Atom Egoyan who e-mailed me back with this:  ""Although I am familiar with Freud's famous case history, I did not discuss it with Erin Cressida-Wilson.""

I figured that was it, until one day Egoyan made a public announcement that it was he who wrote the ending.  The original ending had Liam Neeson coming home and killing Chloe, and Egoyan didn't like it. So he changed it.

I laughed and laughed.  Apparently Cressida-Wilson contacted Egoyan after LaSalle spilled the beans on him and gave him holy hell and demanded he admit to the world the ending was his idea.  Women in California tend to hate Freud. LOL!",1317513600,3,1628,4.81294964028777

What happens when a couple in their mid-life grows apart, and hubby misses a flight home? Naturally, Mom hires a hooker to track him down and attempt to seduce him; has the hooker recount slowly, in graphic detail their encounter; gets turned on by the description of the affair; and sleeps with the hooker herself -- all because it makes her feel close to her husband.

(end spoilers)

I'm not sure what planet the makers of this film live on, but the common reaction to marital and relationship betrayal is...well, feelings of betrayal. Not eroticism.

This was an attempt at a clever, sexy midlife crisis film. It was a failed attempt -- a miserably failed attempt. This cannot be attributed to the actors, for they all performed well. It can only be attributed to the ridiculous plot -- which was as absurd as it was predictable. As soon as the ridiculousness of Katherine's obsession/sexual fantasies about her husband's affairs was shown, the rest of the movie was obvious; and much could be guessed prior to that as well. Unrealistic, obvious and ridiculous.

This movie tries to have the mind games of Cruel Intentions, the creepiness of Fatal Attraction, and a story that loosely mimics Poison Ivy (The First One aka the Drew Barrymore one). I would say that a movie based on that sounds utterly amazing and then you add Julianne Moore's and Liam Neeson's names to it, it should be golden, but it just doesn't hit any of those marks. For me movies need to have an amazing ending to tie up everything that I have been watching for the last 2 hours (or whatever the time frame is), and this just doesn't. I don't want to give anything away but, I feel like the original ending to Fatal Attraction would have worked here, and it would have felt more real. The mind games were predictable, at least for me, but there are a lot of movies that I say that about. I did like seeing Amanda Seyfried in a more grown-up role, but I left thinking that I just wish her character could have been more desperate, more dark, just more.

4081891,4,B0037QGS0A,"A small film done for television and it shows. Too many close-ups for one and the movements are so slow, including the final lethal accident, that they seem suspended in mid-air. And these moments of absolute concentration on one face with one expression that is stretched out to unbearable proportions are definitely too long.

But there can be very good TV films? Sure, honey pie, sure, when David Lynch is the master of ceremonies.

Now what about the subject? A university professor that makes himself academically and pedagogically available to his students. The film cheats at once and only shows girls. Of course such open relations with students can be verging onto flirting, with the girls or with the boys, or both. Students need to meet listening ears and professors need to meet mirror neurons that are going to mimic or mi-mock them. Sex is at times even the only thing they all have on their minds but they would never do it for a myriad of reasons.

The wife is a gynecologist who has become frigid with her profession and she starts imagining for one thing among others that her late teenager nearly adult son is still a little boy who does not look at himself in the mirror and does not even know bees and birds have some kind of moss-life. Frigid I told you. Then she starts fantasizing her husband having an affair. So she hires a prostitute to approach her husband and test him.

What had to happen happens of course and what's more the wife falls for the girl, and what's more the girl makes the boy trip and fall for her and even spend some good time in the mummy's bed, and mummy really is the right word.

After a lethal accident everything will go back to normal. Three semi-strangers living under the same roof and nearly frigid to one another, estranged in all possible ways and only carrying on a life of boredom and dumb perversity. The husband will eventually assault a hotel maid and the wife will eventually have an affair with a female secretary of hers. As for the son he will probably be just as warped and twisted as his parents especially since he witnessed the lethal incident in his hastily put on briefs.

Julian Moore and Amanda Siegfried were brilliant; Moore is a wife who suspects her husband is cheating on her, and Siegfried is a prostitute. Their relationship is the key to the movie's success.

Also, for those who like that sort of thing, there was an intense love scene between the two. Exciting and sexy is a good combination. Chloe is well worth watching and buying.",1309305600,3,458,4.654320987654321
4081893,2,B0037QGS0A,"OK, this apparently is an erotic thriller. Well, let's start with the eroticism part. Amanda Seyfried--very cute. Julianne Moore--uh, no. Liam Neeson--uh, double no.

A thriller where Liam Neeson does not get angry and chase down bad guys. Remind me why he's in this.

Also, the dialogue is beyond ridiculous. The scene where Seyfried (who is playing a prostitute) describes a sexual encounter with Neeson's character is beyond classic. It's as if the scriptwriter, Erin Cressida Wilson (because three names are better than two!) was afraid of actually saying any medical, let alone slang, terms for the actual body parts used to have sex. There's no need to bleep anything for any Christian market they want to reach with this movie, to put it mildly. It's about as erotic as shopping for chairs.

The DVD ""making of"" extra is worth watching to see how pretentious the producers, director and scriptwriter are about this project and the Torontonianess just oozes out. Look, we get it, Torontonians think their city is important being the financial hub of Canada, but people like yourselves once you open your mouths make the rest of us Canadians laugh at your own inflated sense of self.

Oh, yeah, the movie is mainly shot in the winter probably because of its ""glacial"" pace. The entire first hour makes watching yacht racing on TV look like the Stanley Cup playoffs. Of course, the epilogue (metaphor alert!) is in the bright sunshine of spring.

Now SPOILER ALERT, only Atom (Ant?) Egoyan could actually think a movie where a woman hires a prostitute to seduce her husband only to have her end up doing the horizontal mambo with said pro instead...and then have the pro sleep with the mom's son in the parents' bed, fall through a window and die...and the dysfunctional family is all happy at movie's end would make for a plausible story. I kid you not. This is the story. It's hilariously over-the-top dumb.

I'll also mention that Moore is a gynecologist (of course, she is as we're dealing with stunted adults who green-lit this script), Neeson a university prof and their confused (probably by this story) son a classical music prodigy.

Even more hilarious is Seyfried, as a ""high-priced"" prostitute who frequents high-end hotels with her clients and yet rides a bicycle in the winter in Toronto...and not in any sort of winter cycling gear but in a dress and stockings with high heels on. Hey, everyone does in T.O. when it's 15 below, don't they?

It's as if a bunch of Hollywood North types who like softcore porn but want to be ""artistes"" came up with their idea of what would make for an edgy and sexy thriller. Sorry, it didn't work. It comes across as complete pretentious nonsense.

Oh, and Ivan ""Ghostbusters"" Reitman is part of the producing team. Your large set of teeth should be embarrassed to be seen in the DVD extras. Stick to comedy, Ivan.

What happens after with the wife and Chloe is definitely one of the more interesting parts of the film, although I thought they could have developed this a little more...we don't really understand why it is that Chloe has this obsession with her. Is it a mental problem, or is it just a big lesbian crush? I liked the character of the son, although not the parts where he is cussing at his mother all the time.

And it does plod along, at a glacial pace that increasingly made me want to reach for the fast-forward button.  The cinematography and lighting are polished and intriguing, but the director is a little too in-love with them, and they become tedious after a while.

All of this could be forgiven if the characters were well-developed, but they are not.  At best, they are cardboard-caricatures placed in an unusual situation.

It's entirely cliched and predictable.  Right down to the way the wife believes her husband was being unloyal at a restaurant and feels betrayed as a result, and reflects on the incident on the car ride home- it's nothing you haven't already seen on plenty of Lifetime Movie Network films.

4081914,3,B0037QGS0A,"No, I am not reviewing this film, Chloe, based on the story line of this rather mundane (and theme done before) psychological thriller (maybe) about an upper class American family (slightly dysfunctional, of course) who when doctor mom gets ""signals"" that professor dad is cheating on her in his (and her) old age (40-50 something, okay) who gets catch up in the thrall of what is euphemistically called a high end escort (a.k.a. ""hooker"", call girl, etc.). That's enough detail about the plot.

What really interests me about this film is the sub-theme, the inter-generation lesbian theme that is rather graphic in its depiction. Here escort Chloe, through a series of machinations, beds doctor mom. And old lady doctor mom (and Chloe) likes it. Now the only reason that that theme resonates with me right now is that I have recently read Lillian Hellman's play The Children's Hour and seen the film (the 1961 version under that same name). That play and film with a very different plot line nevertheless deals rather more obliquely with lesbianism, almost as if it dare not speak its name (and it doesn't in the first film version of Hellman's play, These Three). So what makes Chloe of interest is as an example of how far, at least cinematically, we have come from the days when such topics, especially the ""hot button"" one of inter-generation sex, hetero, lesbian or otherwise, were relegated to underground movie houses or private viewings.",1295827200,,1446,4.926229508196721

4081917,5,B0037QGS0A,"There are numerous fatal attraction movies out there, and you're thinking who needs another?  How many Rocky sequels (7) do we need, right?  As every movie takes some aspects from its predecessors, the majority of movie releases are rarely original material, and hence exist a degree of predictability.  But somehow this flick is one grabs you and with an artistic creation that impacts your mind, and will still linger.

The French is the unmatched nativity of erotic thrillers, so the Americans had to borrow some of Nathalie (this movie's predecessor), and it worked out brilliantly here.  Add that to smooth, natural characters who play so well, they're all very believable, and a plot where a thin line exists with every decision these characters make.  The storyline is like a ride to place these characters as a catalyst or template to frame yourself in.

The whole premise or driving force is the irony that even though Catherine was being ""cheated on,"" she was the one in power, control, and decision making (calling the shots) in the ""business transaction"" boss of hiring Chloe.  Catherine had the div's (inside scoop) of her husband David's every actions/reactions.  Chloe is weakened by the succumbed-damnation in her chain of desire for Catherine.  However, it is Catherine who becomes snarled and tangled in her own web.  This futility is like a never ending battle of self desire, control and empowerment.  And we the audience are sucked in as well.  I'll leave the rest of the details for your own unearthing.

What made the story so believable is the incredible all around production of this movie, from the flawless acting, to the directing (Atom Epoyan), and impeccably perfect blu ray HD picture.  Any old home can be remodeled and updated to modern style, so can an outdated crafted redo of Fatal Attraction 1987 subjected to an extreme makeover transformation into Chole 2010 storyline, made to succeed in any movie weekend night attention.

This all-star cast is ideal for their roles: Catherine (Julieanne Moore) plays an OBGYN doctor, David (Liam Neeson) a college professor, and Chloe (Amanda Seyfried) escort.  Highly recommended.  Blu-ray extras has 2 deleted scenes, a trailer, plus a 25-min ""behind the scenes, making of"" clip.  Perfect 1080p transfer.",1290988800,16,2282,5.086021505376344
4081918,3,B0037QGS0A,"Watching ""Chloe,"" I felt a little disappointed and misled. While the acting and directing pedigree of the film seems to indicate an intelligent and sophisticated film, the script is really little more than yet another variation on ""Fatal Attraction.""

I've seen parts of ""Natalie"", the French film ""Chloe"" is based on, and from what I saw the film looked like a mature exploration of the disconnection of a middle-aged couple. But ""Chloe"" seems to reinforce so many of the tired stereotypes about sex and romance that come from American films ... most notably, the ridiculous idea that a couple who has been together for decades are still supposed to be behaving like they are in the initial infatuation stage of the relationship, and if they're not, that they've somehow ""lost"" something.

Julianne Moore, one of modern cinema's best actresses, gives the same outstanding performance she gives in pretty much everything she's in. She plays Catherine, a gynecologist whose marriage to a professor has lost its spark over the years. (Well, duh. Juggling two successful careers and raising an almost grown son will do that to a couple.) When Catherine finds reason to suspect that her husband might have had a dalliance with a student, she makes the bizarre decision to hire a doe-eyed escort, Chloe (Amanda Seyfried, who has never looked so delicious) to try and seduce her husband and report back to her.

What follows is an even more bizarre and outlandish series of events which proceed to reveal that Chloe, a young woman who clearly has ""mother issues,"" is in fact sexually obsessed with Catherine and not, as Catherine fears, attracted to either her husband or barely legal son. Since the film never really gives the audience enough reason to believe in Chloe's feelings or actions, by the end of the film the whole thing really just becomes kind of silly.

Chloe might be worth a watch for its good performances, sumptuous art direction, and sexual titillation. But it doesn't offer much intelligent insight into the subjects of relationships, sexuality, or prostitution.",1289174400,2,2077,5.02906976744186

The Movie (Widescreen)</a>, I became intrigued by her skills as well.

I thought about the aspects of this film that appealed to me the most.  I noticed that Julianne Moore's characterization of the wife suspecting her husband was somewhat unusual.  She was detached, unemotional, and almost as if she were totally unaffected by the outcome, whatever it might be.

But as we drew further into her psyche and her connections, I began to realize that this somewhat ""scientific"" approach was in character for Catherine, the doctor; the woman, the betrayed wife, would appear later.  At that time, we would see her feelings, her insecurities, and how much she mourned the connection she once had with her husband.

What we do learn, too, is that Chloe's version of events, as she describes them to Catherine, are not necessarily the truth.  Perhaps it is the truth as she sees it. We come to understand her motivations more as we near the end of the story.

Psychological suspense keeps this film moving, taking us to some unexpected places.

What will Chloe do in the end to ratchet up the thrills for the viewers?  And how far will Catherine go to protect what is hers?

This is not a movie for the faint of heart or those who like pretty Hollywood endings.  But I was not bored during any part of this one, and as the thrills unfolded, I was excited and rooting for more.

I loved the settings, too, and could tell right away that this was not an American city.  At the end, I learned that it was filmed in Toronto.

Egoyan, though Canadian in upbringing, has managed to ""Hollywoodize"" the story here...complete with a kind of blockbuster-y BIG ending, which is unnecessary. The original film is far more subtle, nuanced all the way through, and more of a psychological study that keeps you guessing. ""Chloe"" comes off as a thriller with a typical storyline & even predictable twists. Along these same lines of contrast, it is interesting then to note that the French version is directed by a woman: Anne Fontaine. Anyway, I recommend ""Nathalie"" instead. The female lead in that one--although I love Julianne Moore--is the very beautiful Deneuve-like Fanny Ardant.

A chance encounter in a restaurant bathroom with an escort featuring irresistible bedroom eyes (Amanda Seyfried as Chloe) convinces Catherine to hire the young lady to tempt her husband.  But it's not hubby whom Chloe is attracted to--thus Chloe, for lack of a better word, embellishes what happens, and suddenly Catherine becomes turbo charged.  (Which leads to some wonderful cinema, but I digress.)  From there the plot predictably unravels, yet Moore, Neeson, and especially Seyfried are delightfully fun to watch in this most unusual triangle.  Have a cleaning cloth nearby, as CHLOE will definitely fog your bifocals.

4081927,4,B0037QGS0A,"A chance meeting sets some things into motion - one of those being the testing of a husband's faith. See, a married man misses a flight home, missing his surprise party in the process. This makes his wife wonder what he was up to, and a text with a picture of a young girl makes her wonder even more. solution: in the bathroom, on a night out, the wife meets a girl named Chloe. She seems nice enough and claims to be clean and that sets the wife's mind into motion. she decides to take Chloes and get her to tempt her husband. The problem is that she doesn't know Chloe or know anything about what she wants at all, making things turn out to be - complex and then some.

When I sat down to watch Chloe, I thought I had already seen a million movies like it. The cheating husband and the not-so-blind wife, the person hired to bring it all into focus, and then the drama. The problem was that this is not the story at all - it only seems to be.

I personally liked the cast to this movie and, honestly, I thought the twist with excellent. I cannot talk about it much, but can say with certainty that I really didn't see it all coming. There were a few parts i thought I knew and a few i could have guessed, but this movie was complex because humans are complex. It also talks about so many things that we forget; sometimes there can be purity in so many things, emotions in even the toughest seeming rock, and when we forget that we sometimes forget pieces of who we want to be.

If you have yet to see this movie, you shouldn't wait. It is good and it is interesting and it can surprise you. I watched with singularity in my focus, not knowing, and the end paid me back for that. I personally laughed when i noticed how wrong I was, too, and thought ""I am soo glad I caught this.""

4081931,4,B0037QGS0A,"Atom Egoyan's ""Chloe"" will not appeal to all tastes, despite a healthy dose of eroticism (and tasteful nudity), as it is really an examination of love, aging and insecurity, and how our imagination fills in the blanks when passion wanes. The thriller aspect is actually quite predictable, and a bit disappointing, but it doesn't take away from what truly makes the film work; the terrific triangle of Julianne Moore, Liam Neeson, and, in a breakout performance, Amanda Seyfried, in the title role.

Moore is a gynecologist slipping into middle age, with a still-hunky college professor husband (Neeson), and a teen-aged son who hates her (Max Thieriot, in a role which, unfortunately, largely ended up on the cutting room floor). When hubby skips out on his surprise birthday party, and she finds a photo of him with a sexy student on his cell phone, she assumes the worst; rather than simply confront him, she hires a cute young prostitute (Seyfried), to seduce him, and prove his infidelity. Seyfried confirms Moore's darkest fears, saying that he, albeit reluctantly, responded to her advances. Rather than cut things off, however, Moore, aroused by the thought of her husband's actions, pays to continue the seduction. A bizarre romantic triangle plays out; the hooker provides erotically-charged, graphic details, while becoming increasingly attracted to the wife, who, in her anguished, yet obvious physical arousal by the accounts, responds to the sexual advances of the hooker. Seyfried conveys all this with a combination of sexual savvy and wide-eyed wonder, and watching her bend the sophisticated Moore to her own sexual will, leading to a very intimate, well-played seduction scene, is ultimately, the real climax of the film.

Unfortunately, the plot then slides into melodrama, involving the husband and son, loads of guilt, unrequited love, and predictable tragedy. It is a let-down, as I said, but certainly doesn't ruin the overall pleasure of this film.

Atom Egoyan's films are always well-crafted and provocative; this is a rare case of the director working from someone else's screenplay (by ""Secretary"" screenwriter Erin Cressida Wilson), and the end result, while flawed, is still superior to most of what I've seen on screens over the past couple of years.

Living out the fantasy of another. She is young and comes across this way in her actions and her speech. She is not really manifesting sexuality in her movements and energy but she is interesting and her character draws you in as well as her physical appearance. She meets a female gynocologist who lives a life of seeming apartness from her husband and son. The two ladies share an intimate moment in a restaurant bathroom. Their connection is brief but feels pronounced. It is a different coming together not, a normal interaction, so each can remember its taking place. The doctor is played by Moore, who is again a lonely beautiful woman who doesn't reflect much joy in life. She loves her husband who is played by Neeson, who comes across the opposite in his dealings with others. He is jovial and playful in his career of college professor. His students find him appealing and want to bring him down to their level and he abides. The film starts right in showing the insecurity of the wife towards her mate's flirtations and lateness from work. The strife builds as her insecurity becomes an obsession. An obsession that involves the lovely girl who she meets and continues to find encounters, paying her to come on to Neeson to see how he responds. Throughout this somewhat twisty tale the two women find a sexual tie in the hearing of how her hubby takes the bait with Chole. The tension and restraint of the affair is so well portrayed by Moore. Chole displays flat affect but it is a cover for large insecurity which is seen at the end of the film. Neeson's part also grapples with emotion, we see him as a fun loving personality yet at home he seems wracked with distance from his family. The lack of intimacy between them leads to the sexual acting out. I love Atom E. he is such a great storyteller and chooses material that draws you in. If you have a chance see the movie The Sweet Hereafter, it is one of the best films I have seen.

4081935,3,B0037QGS0A,"The reason I rented this movie was because I admire Liam Neeson's and Julianne Moore's acting skills, and loved Amanda Seyfried's performance in Big Love and Mamma Mia! The plot of the story is predictable enough - a middle-aged couple played by Moore and Neeson are experiencing some strains in their marriage and their teenage son is totally self-absorbed. Then Moore mets Chloe (Seyfried) in the ladies' room whilst at dinner with her husband. The viewer senses an immediate connection and when Moore suspects her husband of cheating on her, she asks Chloe to seduce him to see his reaction. Well, Chloe plays along with this charade, and gives a blow-by-blow of her sexual encounters with Neeson's character, much to Moore's initial mortification and eventual turn-on (yes, apparently she gets off on hearing about their sexual exploits).

The story then takes a dark turn (well, darker) when Chloe begins to get obsessed with Moore's character, an obsession which is reciprocated to a certain extent. There's some sexual encounters between both women which initially struck me as weird but then slowly began to make sense. Chloe is a complex character, in fact I think her character was the most complex of the three. There is definitely a hint of an abandonment complex, a sense of emptiness within Chloe which she feels can only be assuaged with Moore. The clue here is the hair pin which Chloe keeps and later presents to Moore as a gift. In the deleted scenes, there's more background information provided which enables the viewer to understand the motivations of the characters which I wish had been portrayed in the movie.

The acting is wonderful as can be expected from two experienced actors and a talented up-and-coming actor. I just wish the storyline had been more credibly dealt with. Little things annoyed me too - the portrayal of Moore and Neeson's son as an accomplished pianist and also a hockey player? Not many pianists I know would risk their precious hands playing a potentially risky sport. That aside, there was also some awkwardness in the performance of the teen son.

The very first trailer was for Chloe, the new Atom Egoyan flick.  Now I was intriqued.  Egoyan has been one of my favorite directors since I watched The Sweet Hereafter.  Plus it had both Julianne Moore and Amanda Seyfried, two of the sexiest women in the biz right now.  So I knew I had to see it.

  Fast forward to just last night.  Around 2am, and having nothing better to do, I decided to finally pop it in the machine and I must say, I was pretty much kept on the edge of my seat throughout most of the flick.

  The story goes that Julianne Moore plays the wife of a popular music professor.  Their marriage has apparently gone stale since he tends to try and stay out of town with his students and, it seems, has no sexual feelings towards her any more.  Even their son appears to dislike her.  One night while at dinner, she meets a seemingly shy young girl who, in reality, is a call girl.  From here, Julianne hatches a plan to see if this girl, Chloe, can seduce her husband.  She is to meet him and report back to her at the end of each session.  Trouble is, when you play with fire, you end of getting burned.

  I really like the look and feel to this movie.  The characters, especially our two leading ladies, were well rounded.  Liam Neeson turns in a fairly good performance but, sadly, still appears to be coping with the lost of real life wife, Natshia Richardson who died not to long before this film was completed.  It seems weird for Atom Egoyan to be helming this project.  This doesn't seem to be his normal subgenre.  You would think, giving the whole infidelity angle, that Chloe would be more up Adrian Lyne's alley which it does seem given that the third act does take more of a Fatal Attraction/Poison Ivy/Obsessed turn which, in my opion, drug the movie down.  Had he simply stuck with the idea of being lured in to Chloe's charm and powers of persuasion, the movie may have been a pretty successful hit.  Not saying that this movie was bad, far from it.  In fact, I'm surprised that this movie was released straight to dvd with such star power while Obsessed was given a theatrical run given that that movie had the whole feel of a D2D.

The mounting tension among the film's two core relationships promises much during the film's running time, but it drifts into its third act in a manner that ultimately sabotages the story and keeps it from becoming something truly memorable, ending with more of a whisper versus a bang. While it cleverly uses the classic psycho-sexual thriller Fatal Attraction as a worthy framework, Chloe took the premise and gave it a refreshing twist and that alone is worth giving it a rental viewing. Aside from that, view the film for what should be regarded as Amanda Seyfried's breakout performance. If anything should be remembered after walking away, it's that the young doe-eyed actress definitely has the talent to pull of a serious role.",1282867200,19,1343,5.026905829596412

I actually saw it on cable about a month before Chloe was released and was amazed how good it was and surprised I'd never heard of it.... then a month later I went to the theatre to see Chloe because I like Amanda Seyfried.

I was sitting there in the theatre and thinking, hey I've seen this before.... The first half of Chloe is almost the same script and scenes as the original, but then in middle of film it becomes much sexier and more Hollywood. The American version is certainly more sexy and erotic and exciting, particularly with Seyfried getting naked, but the French version with Ardant and Bart is just as good in its own right, and more dramatic in the end. ***** for both!",1280361600,5,956,4.558139534883721

While Fatal Attraction type movies are often predictable, the move that Chloe places on Julianne Moore's character is also placed on the audience, and I doubt many honest viewers can say they saw what was coming down when all three characters got together momentarily at the cafe.

The opening scenes have Amanda Seyfried (who is GREAT, btw!) talking about how she ""uses words."" One is immediately tempted to condescend to what appears a simple-mindedness on the part of a young and extremely attractive prostitute. WATCH OUT! You'll be snookered, too. I loved it, and the contrast of the young-and-beautiful with the ""not-knowing-how-to-grow-old"" set was ballsy and well-done.

The idea of fantasy vs. Moore's OB-GYN advice that an ""orgasm is merely a series of contractions."" When Chloe is having sex with someone she's not into, she gazes and fixates on her lover's shoes, and has what one dead-headed reviewer regarded as a ""shoegasm."" While the term does make one chuckle, there should be praise for a writer/director who can at least TRY to reflect the nature of sexual fantasy during sex. Not an easy thing to do outside of animation.
Liam Neison and Moore are flawless, but it's Seyfried who one comes away wanting to see more of (no, I don't just mean naked)... And Atom Ergoyan as well. If I see either name on a coming project, I am there.",1279929600,4,1524,4.812977099236641

Unfortunately, the director's main method of achieving the appearance of art is to have nearly every single line followed by a LLOOOOOOONNNNGGGGGGG stare.

Without giving away ""spoilers"", I can say that I had the progression of events figured out within the first half-hour.  I have to say I felt some disappointment seeing Liam Neeson and Julianne Moore in the kind of ""adultery melodrama"" that the Lifetime channel regularly delivers.

Prurient in ways mostly involving money and class distinction,  these movies are very cynical and unimaginative.  It didn't do much at the box office, though, which means that maybe people have finally had enough of these predictable potboilers.",1279497600,16,838,5.543307086614173

Dr. Stewart, although professionally successful in a spectacular way and endowed with material success, intelligence, and her own beauty, suffers from a deplorable lack of self-esteem. Closing in on 50, she feels she has lost her attractiveness even while Professor Stewart becomes more distinguished and desirable to women, with whom he flirts shamelessly.

Having completely alienated her teenaged, newly sexually active son by her constant invasive eavesdropping, she begins to erode her marriage similarly, reading her husband's emails and checking his call lists. Although there's little enough to go on, she convinces herself of David's infidelity, and hires Chloe as a trapdoor spider to attempt a seduction.

Chloe begins to report back to Dr. Stewart regularly in a slowly escalating series of erotic tales regarding her husband. Despite herself, Dr. Stewart becomes sexually enthralled by Chloe's ongoing seduction, losing herself in detailed fantasies regarding Chloe and the Professor. This culminates in the good doctor having a sexual liaison with Chloe. Their lovemaking sequence is easily one of the most erotic and near-explicit such scenes ever crafted in mainstream filmmaking.

Afterward, Dr. Stewart confronts her husband regarding Chloe. The denoument is predictable; the film's end is so contrived as to nearly utterly spoil this otherwise engaging film. Were it not for the last three minutes this would be a perfect film. The performances are excellent, especially Neeson's and Seyfried's; Moore's is a shade less so, if only because her rampant insecurity seems so implausible.

The sexuality of the film is quite erotic and everyone seems to be getting turned on by this girl, so it really is kind of silly. Problems esculate as the film goes on, but nothing really concrete, Julianne Moore even gets caught up in the who sexpidition but this really doesnt add to the story at all, even though she expects that he's cheating. So the tables are turned thoughout the film, and stories get very convuluted. So its really not what i expected, its just very boring and corny, with a lot of taboos.

4081960,5,B0037QGS0A,"First, I would have to say this is Amanda's most emotional performance and Atom Egoyan's best film. Anyone that would compare this too a ""Fatal Attraction or Basic instinct"" would be incorrect. The story is a lot deeper than that, it's a story of love and being let down, misled and being used. I have been down this path many times so I can totally relate to Chloe's character in the movie. This is a film that you do not watch, you have to engage in it. So for those that can't pay attention to close detail? I wouldn't advise this film for you at all it will be a waste of time. I have seen some of the reviews from critics and they obviously didn't really watch the film. To say this is porn or even a simple story is just ridiculous! Chloe is a very depressed, lonely, emotional and intelligent character that will go to any extent to get what she needs. If you watch the movie most of the performance  takes place with her eyes and emotions, which is rare. Basically what I mean by this is, go by her face not what she speaks. This is not some predictable story where the girl goes crazy and kills everyone. This is not some over the top Sharon Stone performance either, so be prepared. This is a very realistic point of view of loving and needing to the extent of harming yourself even. In this particular film there was a contemporary world that was created in Toronto.  I am so intrigued with this movie for it's boldness, cinematography and locations. It is amazingly beautiful to look at for one, and the story is so straight forward to say the least. There are so many movies out there that play with the idea of bi-sexuality or homosexuality but never really show the emotional side of it. I felt that this film touched on a lot of interesting ideas as well as captivated the essence of sexuality. Amanda Seyfried's performance in this movie was astonishing as well as sensual and bold. This is a very disturbing movie but at the same time a guilty pleasure at best.

  It actually conveys that looks aren't everything and just because your attractive you don't have everything. U have a insecure older woman that could except a beautiful younger woman? U have a husband that flirts with everything that walks ? I hope that I am not giving to many clues away about this film. But I suggest anyone that want to be turned on and enjoy seeing two beautiful women on screen. As well as some great atmosphere and some truly emotional performances? I would say ""Chloe"" is definitely your popcorn movie of the evening. Movies like ""Jennifer's body, Poison IVY: The new seduction"" and ""The Girl Friend Experience"" may be other ones that may be in your ball park. But if I had to choose the best, ""Chloe"" would be the winner  out of the three... easily. I even learned about some additional good music from this film ""Raised by Swans"" which reminds me of old Coldplay at there best. Atom Egoyan  really made a really dark and interesting journey through erotica and suspense. If you have ever seen the movie ""EXOTICA"" he is the director of that film as well. So what lengths would you go through to be with someone you love ? Watch ""Chloe"" you won't be disappointed I can assure you ! This movie was so stylish that I actually had to have the Blu-ray and man its beautiful. If you are a fan of Toronto Canada this is the film to watch. They had some really historic places in the film. The Windsor Arms hotel, Toronto's Art museum, and the Rivoli which are all nice sites. This is definitely the best film I have seen in a while its not something the U.S is capable of anymore. And the home that they lived in was like a Glass House/Art museum, you just have to see it. She had some very nice attire as well very flamboyant for a escort. She reminded me a lot of myself because I think I over do things at times. But anyway watch the film I think if you can appreciate good art you will not be disappointed. You have some good music, sexy buildings great atmosphere and some sexy women... what more can you ask for ?

4081961,4,B0037QGS0A,"Atom Egoyan ('The Sweet Hereafter', 'Ararat', 'Where the Truth Lies') has a gift for setting up cinematic surveillance of private encounters and studying the results of an incident on everyone witnessing it.  In CHLOE he has engaged the services of Erin Cressida Wilson to adapt the French film NATHALIE by Anne Fontaine  to place it on this side of the pond.  In the French version the successful actors were Fanny Ardant, Emmanuelle Bart, and Grard Depardieu: for this version Egoyan has an equally superb cast to carry off this mysterious story with great success. The same question arises in both films: 'what is imagined and what is real?', and it is the getting there that makes this film so fascinating.

Catherine Stewart (Julianne Moore) is a gynecologist married to the successful professor of music David (Liam Neeson) and they have a stay-at-home hippie son Michael (Max Thieriot) who goes about his life much the same as his parents: there is superficial companionship but little in depth relationship. The marriage seems satisfactory until Catherine plans a surprise birthday party for David, a party David doesn't attend, and Catherine suspects David of having affairs, a fact that David apparently suggests by his flirtations with waitresses and 'help'. Catherine is shocked, but realizes that as she is aging this may be a normal situation in older marriages.

Catherine visits a bar, a private club for assignations, and there she meets Chloe (Amanda Seyfried) and eventually buys Chloe's services as a prostitute to meet her husband and then tell her all about the encounters. It is agreed that Chloe will be paid for her services and only go as far as Catherine instructs. From this point on Catherine and Chloe meet after Chloe has encounters with David and describes the acts of the encounters in vivid and lurid detail. Catherine is fascinated and continues to pay Chloe for on going encounters and subsequent voyeuristic descriptions. Catherine even has a one-night stand of her own with Chloe in an attempt to understand her husband's need for infidelity.

Despite the setup of 'private investigator and prostitute detective' the two women become friends. When Catherine realizes she has enough evidence against David to leave him there is a final encounter of the three (Catherine, David, Chloe, and even son Michael) that brings the ingenious surprise ending - an ending too fine to share as it would spoil the film for viewers new to the story.  Each of the actors does a star turn - Julianne Moore, Amanda Seyfried, and Liam Neeson - and once again Atom Egoyan takes an implausible story and makes us think.

4081963,4,B0037QGS0A,"Dr. Catherine Stewart (Julianne Moore) is suspicious that her husband, college professor David (Liam Neeson), is doing more than flirting with his students.  Given the lack of warmth emanating from her husband and the open disdain of her son, Michael (Max Thieriot), Catherine's best move would be to just pack up and leave.  But instead, she comes up with the bright idea of hiring a call girl, Chloe (Amanda Seyfried), to tempt her husband and report back with the details.  Let us just say that things do not go the way Catherine hopes in this erotic thriller.  Catherine is a gynecologist and early on she tells a patient that an orgasm is just a series of muscular contractions.  The statement strikes me as the type of hubris exhibiting by the doomed heroes in Greek tragedies.  The 2009 film begins with a voice over by Chloe, in which she explains how adept she is at giving her customers what they want.  Chloe has as much faith in her abilities as Catherine lacks faith in her husband.  David's character is a minor figure in the story, with his words and actions being inherently ambiguous, so we are always thinking maybe he did but maybe he did not, but the story comes down to the two women (think Alfred Hitchcock's ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Suspicion/dp/B0002HOEOY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Suspicion</a>,"" but with Cary Grant playing a minor character instead of the male lead).  The key question is what does Catherine want out of this test of her husband's fidelity?  Because whatever it is, Chloe is bound and determined to provide it.

A strength of the film is that Erin Cressida Wilson, who did the screenplays for ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Secretary/dp/B00008DDSC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Secretary</a>"" and ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fur-An-Imaginary-Portrait-of-Diane-Arbus/dp/B000NO1XG8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fur - An Imaginary Portrait of Diane Arbus</a>,"" came up with this script from the French film ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nathalie/dp/B000ENC73G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nathalie</a>.""  I have not seen the original, but Wilson has a talent for unusual love relationships, although what we have in ""Chloe"" is far and away the most normal one she has tackled to date.  Atom Egoyan (""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Exotica/dp/6305428107/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Exotica</a>,"" ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Sweet-Hereafter/dp/0780622251/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Sweet Hereafter</a>"") certainly wants viewers to be ahead of Catherine, so there is a sense from early on of waiting for Catherine to catch up before it is too late.  The musical score cues you in that things are darker than they seem.  But what sold me on checking out this movie as soon as it came out on DVD when I saw the trailer was the cast.  In the wake of ""Mama Mia!"" it seems Amanda Seyfried is in every other movie, especially if they involve letter writing (i.e., ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dear-John/dp/B0021L8V3Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dear John</a>"" and ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Letters-to-Juliet/dp/B002ZG988M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Letters to Juliet</a>""), but there are those who want to see more of her and this movie certainly delivers on that score.  Chloe is the darkest role she has played to date, and it is no surprise at this point that she can hold her own against Moore, whose character you can see shatter just by watching her eyes.

It is when Chloe reaches her own breaking point in this film that I start questioning a lot of what is happening.  The Chloe of the end game is decidedly different from the one we first meet and who becomes part of Catherine's secret conspiracy.  As the credits rolled I was going backwards from the end to rethink everything in terms of how things played out, and it did not fit as neatly as I would like it to under the circumstances.  A standard problem in most thrillers and horror movies is that the payoff is never up to the setup, and ultimately that is the case here and I ended up rounding down on ""Chloe"" because of the title character's fate.  Still, ""Chloe"" is well-written and well-acted adult fare, and there is not much out there these days that can meet that standard.  Although things could have gotten much worse, just keep in mind that this is not a good date movie.",1279065600,5,4619,5.85096870342772
4081964,2,B0037QGS0A,"Liam Neeson must need the cash - that's pretty much the only thing that would explain his appearance in this movie. The central premise is irritating in its banality: a middle-aged woman is worried that her husband is having an affair. Ladies & gentlemen, this is 2010, not 1910. Humans are semi-monogamous. People do indeed have affairs, with predictable regularity. To make an entire film based around one somewhat repressed woman's obsession with her husband's supposed infidelity (which clearly isn't happening anyway) is to impose a couple of hours of boredom on most viewers. Frankly, who cares? From the moment the wife hires a prostitute to ""test"" her husband it's obvious this is a woman who needs to spend cash on therapy rather than amateur detective work, and when the prostitute (Chloe) then begins to fabricate stories of her encounters, we know it's time to turn off the movie and pull a good book from the shelf. Neeson is wasted as the noble husband, but Julianne Moore does a creditable job of making her tiresome character watchable, at least for a while.  Chloe herself, as an ingenue psycho, is a one-dimensional role that no actress could do much to salvage.

Aside from some nice camerawork - using views-through-windows to suggest separation and alienation - there's not really much to recommend this dull offering, unless you think a very tame sex scene between two women is worth the tedium of sitting through what is just a very silly and irritating tale of anxiety, mistrust, and a woeful misuse of financial resources.",1279065600,7,1547,4.946153846153846

4081966,5,B0037QGS0A,"...To the harsh critics before me, ouch. I, for one, disagree to the umpteenth degree with you all.
To me, Chloe was a work of art. A pure genius look at human behavior: how we create our own fantasies, lust for something more, and are capable of changing the world we've come to know in an instant.
  Yes, at times this film is graphic. But this sexual and erotic exploration only heightens the intensity and power of its message.
  What I love the most is that my take on it is different than your take on it that's different from your next-door neighbor's take on it. There are so many ways to interpret the well-thought out meaning of Chloe-- so many that the director even mentions to Amanda that he's curious to see how she will react to it when she's older. (The commentary, by the way, is lovely and entirely insightful. Definitely worth listening to... At least parts of.)
  I love movies that make you think, and by far this one did just that. The cover says it all, subtly yes, but intriguingly as well. What happens when a love triangle falls apart... when a lover disappears?
  Chloe isn't meant to be a high-packed, heart-wrenching thriller/drama. It is simply meant to observe and report, in a sense. To delight, arouse, and question.
  Brilliantly written, beautifully directed, and phenomenally acted by Neeson, Seyfried (best role she has played to date, in my opinion), and Moore. Bravo.",1278720000,4,1406,4.678861788617886
4081967,4,B0037QGS0A,"Atom Egoyan underook a deserved homage and at the same time, a remake of ""Nathalie"" a French film dated from 2003 directed by Anne Fontaine (Emmaneulle Beart plays the role of Amanda Seyfried, Julianne Moore played sthe role of Fanny Ardant, and finally, Lian Neeson makes the role of Gerard Depardieu).

""Chloe"" is a mature and penetrating study about the existential condition of marriage. When a devoted wife who has lost her ability for keeping the seduction, reads a text message on the cell of his husband.

In spite of the fact she is a renowned professional specialist, the desperation will lead her to meet accidentally a alluring young girl a modern Aphrodite. In order to inform herself about how to adopt new intimate attitudes, she decides to hire her to seduce her husband.

This is the dramatic plot. But this fact will origin a set of unexpected situations and unknown sensations of complex nature that will lead to a shocking end.

Once more, Julianne Moore steals the show as the desperate wife who intends by all her means, to avoid her marriage comes to end. Liam Neeson is fine too like the husband and Amanda Seyfried like the mysterious and perverse femme fatale.

Fine direction from the talented Atom Egoyan one of my favorite filmmakers. A must-see.",1277856000,4,1275,4.830275229357798

The acting was wooden and mechanical, and the plot shallow and full of cliches. Egoyan went 'Hollywood' in this one, and it came up a cropper.  I really don't understand why the film was even made. It was a waste of time and money.",1523232000,,385,4.661764705882353
