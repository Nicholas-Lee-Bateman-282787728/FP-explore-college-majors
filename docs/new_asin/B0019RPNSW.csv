3443449,5,B0019RPNSW,"This, the 3rd film by The Collective, is a great one.  The Collective produce the best mountain biking films I have ever seen.  Their cinematography is top notch.  I felt Roam (the 2nd film) did not live up to the production quality of the first.  'Seasons' however is phenomenal.  Beautiful scenery and an excellent audio mix.
The real reason we buy these disks is for the riders, and the riders are as good, or better, than the production quality of the disk.  These boys got skills the rest of us riders wish we had.  There is a good mix of downhill, jumps, freeride, etc.
This is one you will want to add to your collection so that you could watch over and over again.  Too bad there is not Blu-ray version.",1217289600,3,711,4.374045801526718
3443450,5,B0019RPNSW,"This is the first mountainbike DVD I've bought and I'm going to get the other Collective movies - this is stunning.  Great blend of cinematography, music, interviews with the guys, and mountainbiking action. Love all the different camera angles.  The riders are excellent, as you'd expect as they are at the top of their game.  It's cool to see mountainbiking from an observer point of view too.  The stunts are incredible but this movie nonetheless makes mountainbiking feel accessible; unlike watching some other sports (motorbike racing comes to mind) this is something us mortals can do, even if not to this extreme.  Very inspiring - makes you want to get out and ride!",1213574400,,674,4.929203539823009
3443451,4,B0019RPNSW,"While it is not ROAM, it is definately a fun movie. Starts out slow. Let's face it, how many of us can really enjoy mountain biking in winter (except us lucky ones in Arizona... we just can't bike in the heat of the summer). The movies covers the life of competition as well as riding with friends. Love this movie.",1211932800,3,315,4.266666666666667

8275115,2,B0019RPNSW,"This video had far too much talking. It was like a video of interviews then music and bike rides. The first 2 videos The Collective and Roam were great  bike videos, but Seasons just didn't hold up to those 2 videos",1373328000,,215,4.2439024390243905
8275116,3,B0019RPNSW,Nice Insight into the lives of the riders profiled but ultimately not as good as recent productions.  Some great wire shots and some memorable moments.  Ultimately a collection of short sequences that don't really hang together well.  My 2c..,1357689600,,242,5.153846153846154
8275117,5,B0019RPNSW,"This is a great DVD. I don't bike anymore but when I used to, all those occasions when I was feeling a little lazy about going out to the hills and ride I just watched this, and at the end I just felt so pumped up that the next thing you knew about me was that I was already climbing those hills with my bike.",1317340800,,309,3.769230769230769
8275118,5,B0019RPNSW,If you are a person that enjoys any form of mountian biking you will enjoy this movie.  The filming was fantastic and artisticly shot.  Music matched each scene well and really brought the experience together.  Only bad thing is I watched this in the dead of winter and it made me want to ride my bike really darn bad.  Fantastic movie if you love bikes.  Cant go wrong.,1309392000,,370,4.382352941176471
8275119,5,B0019RPNSW,"I saw just one scene of this video on Youtube and then decided to buy it. There is nothing to trash in it, it's just awesome. If you are into MTB but also you do enjoy video and photo shooting on your rides, this video is a must see.",1273449600,,233,3.7755102040816326
8275120,5,B0019RPNSW,"This is without a doubt the best mountain biking film I have ever seen. Its so well shot, the music is great, the riders are the best in the world. Get this film, it will blow your mind.",1241395200,,186,3.9210526315789473
8275121,5,B0019RPNSW,"you might want to know that the dvd comes in a recycled case, which is very nice, but it looks like recylec paper, not its cover(that looks brand new), but the internal part that holds the disc. Talking about the movie, that was honestly one of the best I've ever seen, the documentary parts, in which you get to know the bikers alternate with the riding part, in the most beautiful scenarios, with a great choice of soundtrack that makes the whole thing even more inspiring, those guys are like sick! They're crazy, and the director could capture the most amazing angles! That's absolutly breathtaking.",1238284800,,603,4.752380952380952
