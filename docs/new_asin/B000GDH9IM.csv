I would also like to agree with one of the religious people, a woman, who was interviewed for this movie. She questions why homosexuality should be celebrated whereas drunkeness and wife-beating are not. I would question that, too. Admittedly, I wasn't able to fully enjoy watching this movie, as some of the ""athletes"" seem to care more about flaunting their alternative lifestyles than they were wanting to finish on top. Being a lover of competitiveness, I wasn't able to get much of that in this movie. My overall opinion of the movie could be expressed in one word: dull.",1453075200,,724,4.753968253968254
8130660,5,B000GDH9IM,"This is a documentary about the Gay Games, its history, and its founder.  If you liked ""After Stonewall,"" ""Coming Out under Fire,"" or other gay documentaries, then you'll like this too.

I love when documentaries on oppressed groups give a chance for members of that community to narrate.  It was great seeing Susan Sarandon narrate about American women gaining the right to vote, Morgan Freeman narrating a work on Black artists during the McCarthy era, or Harvey Fierstein narrating the documentary on Harvey Milk.  Here, Greg Louganis, a gay athlete, narrated on the Gay Games.  Unlike the previous examples, he was both a narrator and an interviewee.  Unfortunately, his voice is a bit deadpan and lifeless.  After this, I am not sure if other documentary makers will hire him for narration.

The work is not just a feel-good piece.  It mentions that homophobes have hurt the Games and that recent Games have lost incredible amounts of money.  The work may seem dated as little or nothing was said about the 2006 Gay Games in Chicago.  Still, I wasn't expecting much from this documentary and wound up being enlightened and entertained by it immensely.",1165363200,,1156,4.937823834196891
