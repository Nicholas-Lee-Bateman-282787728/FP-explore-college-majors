8468835,1,B005ER6S3C,You've heard of 'B' movies . This isn't even an 'E' movie. Actors are terrible and the story line is ridiculous.,1411430400,,112,4.380952380952381
8468836,1,B005ER6S3C,"Too long to be cheesy fun, the script attempts to cover too much, and without the budget to match. The ""best"" aspects of the film are the music, albeit synthesized, some creative camera work (NOT the not-so-special ""special effects"") and what seem to be some talented actors poorly directed. Production values are nearly non-existent. This movie will be extremely valuable to film students as a what-not-to-do essay on low budget productions. All hail the new Ed Wood.",1363219200,3,468,5.090909090909091
8468837,4,B005ER6S3C,"Not quite, but plays well off the old German film - and if you liked Nosferatu, this will be a kick.  Low budget film and can show in the overlay to digital backgrounds - but this is a flim to buy for the freaky fun factor, not for serious horror and will drive Twilighters into real fits of angst (all the more reason to get it and show it to them.  In most Dracula based films, Renfield as the looney, is always the fun part - that he became Nosferatu and is still a total nut-job, just upped the already funny side to Renfield.  So toss out all your old concepts of the Dracula story, don't sweat the low budget spots you will notice - and focus on the fun of the picture and I think you will like it, especially for the price.",1356480000,2,730,4.055555555555555
8468838,5,B005ER6S3C,Not for the kiddos as there is lots of blood and guts.  Thought the acting was a little bland but decent with the exception of the inspector/detective(Paul Damon) and Renfield himself.  You'll continue to watch just to see who the next victim will be.....,1346889600,3,255,4.7727272727272725
8468839,4,B005ER6S3C,This is one of the movies that you watch so you can make comments about it all the way through. It is a cheesy but fun movie with outlandish acting.,1322179200,9,148,3.966666666666667
