8587921,5,B00029RCAU,"This is a wonderful set of VHS Tapes with 2 tapes of Kelly. 6 episodes all together. This is great if you love Australian Children's shows. This stars the wonderful actress Charmaine Gorman and a good cast on the whole. This is all about retired police dog Kelly. If you remember this 1991/1992 Classic, this is a real must. But even if you don't remember it, it's worth a watch.",1391904000,,379,4.428571428571429
