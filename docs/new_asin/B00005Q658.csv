7949826,5,B00005Q658,"So disappointed with this. Though the locations are interesting, there is nothing of much substance in the whole thing. Just a bunch of people raving about their impressions with each location. I expected to learn of true ghostly experiences, not daydreams. Expected to see locations where people have had ghostly experiences, but just a non-event.",1355529600,,348,5.345454545454546
7949827,5,B00005Q658,"This was a great documentary. I can see why it won awards.  The accents were a little difficult, but made it interesting to watch a few times.  All the ghost investigations were cool, but the last one - was a tear jerker.  My girlfriend cried.  It would be amazing to see them work in person.  I've been a fan of the ISPR for years.",1059955200,3,332,4.125
