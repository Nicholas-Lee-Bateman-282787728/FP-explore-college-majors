4208289,4,B003V8FYKY,"This show is fantastic; the participants really become fully immersed in the experiment and their actions are incredibly sincere. There is a lot of engineering/mechanical invention type of stuff as well as realistic human drama (a bit too much fighting and swearing for my taste, but fun). The characters are funny and likeable, as well as frustrating and annoying, and there are some brilliant minds that blew me away with their inventiveness.

A few complaints are that I wish the women could have been more involved in the important aspects of the show, and they could have had more than 2-3 ""experts"" commenting on the events (I got a bit bored with the same faces). I'm also disappointed that this DVD is so expensive as it's only a ten-episode show; I'm waiting for it to be available used before I can afford to buy it.",1275955200,6,826,4.696551724137931
4208290,5,B003V8FYKY,"Hi, I have watched this and let me tell you it is worth your time. The way the people in this really start to believe they are in an apocalyptic world is amazing. The things they invent to survive is the most satisfying thing and you learn alot from it. I would highly recommend this to anyone, as it is addicting to watch to see what happens next.

4208295,5,B003V8FYKY,"I enjoyed these two seasons of colony showing people pot into apocalypse type situations , and some of the solutions they come up with to solve problems , with a a little knowledge and teamwork it shows a different way of survival is possible . Obviously some of it is staged , and the solutions for certain scenarios would have to be rethought in a real a situation , but it is food for thought , and further research .",1444694400,,420,4.2625

4208299,4,B003V8FYKY,"The show is called The Colony, and the basic concept is similar to shows like Survivor, in that you put a bunch of people into a barely habitable situation and see how they do.  However, as opposed to shows like Survivor, theres no real gimmicks, this is a show that describes itself as an experiment to see how real people would react in a situation where the world has gone nuts.

Im nearing completion of the second season as we speak and I have to say that Ive been enjoying the show so far.  Sure, they focus a little more on the personal drama than I would care for, however, lack of food and sleep as well as being on constant guard against external attacks would probably cause quite a bit of interpersonal strife.  The thing Ive been really getting into is how these people (who are described as being an average cross-section of Americans) really pull together some incredibly amazing gadgets and such in order to make their lives slightly more like home.

Watching this show has gotten me thinking more about my own abilities, with regard to how I would fare in a situation such as these.  Many of these folks are experienced in a variety of fields, as well as having some incredibly random life experiences that end up lending a hand to their predicament.  When I watch these folks creating solar powered tricycles, or windmills, or gassifier engines. . . I cant help but think I would be severely lacking in the engineering piece of the survival pie.

But practical experience seems to be only a portion of the question.  As I watch further, I see people whos experiences don't lend well to the tasks they are required to do, doing much more than they thought were possible merely because it is what was required of them to live.

And thats where the really interesting piece comes in.  These people aren't just surviving, they're actually, in many ways, bettering themselves.  They are adapting to their situation quickly.  Sure, in many ways, at least at the beginning, they are simply reacting to the situations at hand, but as time goes on, they actually begin becoming proactive and thinking about their needs for the future, and. . . well, doing some things that they had never tried before to great success (with some added failures as well).

This show has gotten me thinking further about the human condition, as well as giving me some ideas for some future stories.  And. . . you know, thinking about the kind of stuff I should start learning in order to be prepared when those zombies do attack.",1427155200,,2519,4.616591928251121

4208306,3,B003V8FYKY,"It is a reallity series, that is dubbed as a experiment. This is the type of show, where no really good fight sceanes are done, in fact there is very little bleeding; unless you include the minor cuts and vehicle accidents. What I loved about the show was how they created some neat items out of scraps. Like:

1) A water purfication system, using a trash can, sand and charcoal.

2) Making gas out of wood chips.

3) Creating a power plant; first by using gas and then solar pannels.

4) A solar power car was created for scavenging food.

There were lame moments, like the ending, the drama and finding power tools out of nowhere.",1393286400,,632,4.413793103448276
4208307,4,B003V8FYKY,I liked the show for the ideas it brought up and situations it made you think about. Made me change a few things  I was doing.

4208312,5,B003V8FYKY,"I watched this on Netflix and liked it so much that I bought the DVD set.  The show is very interesting because unlike many other ""reality"" shows, it is an experiment, and not a contest:  no one in the ""cast"" is trying to beat anyone else out for some kind of prize.  The show is not completely realistic because the cast were obvously given instructions ahead of time regarding some of the things they would not be allowed to do (such as punching or kicking a marauder), but it still gives you an idea of what many of the real concerns would be in a post apocalyptic world, and makes you wonder how you would cope if you were in a similar situation yourself.

They were quite entertaining to watch build things from junkish materials. Most of what I liked most were scenes that reminded me of Junkyard Wars or the building of simple things from supposed garbage.

 As far as realism.... they get as far as you can get without getting too violent (granted no Season 3 yet because of a death). The raids are a bit silly in that regard and some of the possibly added drama is tiresome. I assume the money thought people wanted to watch people bicker. Several cast members either were useless or filmed to be useless... usually see only 2-3 of the people actually getting things done.

Despite all that I enjoyed watching this. Skip the second season though.... it will just make you grumpy.",1375315200,,836,4.635135135135135

I finally found it and watched it from start to finish. If you are into this sorta thing then I think you would enjoy watching this. I personally don't think it was the best show ever. I didn;t care for the aspect of it not being real enough for me. I mean yes it was kinda real but I think it woulda been more interesting if they had more free will and really had to leave the place they were staying and actually find stuff...... but still it was interesting.,1362528000,,600,4.008333333333334

4208325,5,B003V8FYKY,"Good series.  I started watch the colony a while back and didn't have a chance to see how it ended.  I like how the producers picked a wide variety of people and how professionals would comment on how the group was doing as a group.  I recommend this to anyone who is a ""prepper"" to see just how people will react in a real situation.  It is good series to watch, but you can learn a lot from people and how they react in less than ideal situations.",1355443200,,449,4.068181818181818
4208326,2,B003V8FYKY,"The premise is very interesting: 10 survivors must work together after an Apocalypse to assure their survival. After the first couple episodes it had some promise but quickly goes downhill. It really suffers from the over produced fake foolery that is president in most reality shows. There are just so many plot holes and obvious edits that it ruins the show.

Now I do understand that they could not go ""all out"" on the show, they do have to keep the safety and health of the survivors in mind (there is a disclaimer at the beginning of each episode) but for the love of god please do a better job of the illusion. Here are some things that irked me:

The nurse, even though she complains about being dirty, always seems to look clean with fresh makeup on a clean improvised dress.

They are complaining about not having enough food but the martial arts instructor wastes valuable time to make a gym to teach the girls some self defense? Yeah right, like that would really help in the post apocalypse where raiders are carrying around Molotov cocktails and AK-47s.

After 16 days they then only notice a large room with a shiny white door in the warehouse? WTF! It's almost as bad as them discovering the crates after like day 4 or 5, these HUGE crates in the middle of the warehouse that are just begging to be opened.

They constantly tell the audience that the survivors don't know if the raiders are trying to harm them or not. Then why don't they try to hurt them when they get raided.

Oh and the chiming in by that annoying TSA guy and that chick psychologist to tell you the most obvious things gets old.

If you want a good laugh with some mild entertainment and cheesy reality show type situations thrown in you might like it. Otherwise just skip it, they could have did a much better job.",1332201600,,1801,4.472560975609756

4208328,5,B003V8FYKY,"I was completely captivated by this show. A really awesome concept involving the supposed Apocalypse. The cast are all very intriguing and it was great watching them critically think to establish electricity & other real-world problems they would face if this were real.

A wood gasifier, an AM morse code transmitter, a tesla coil for ozonation of water, etc.etc.etc.  I have learned a lot just from his ideas.

4208335,5,B003V8FYKY,"Greetings;

Ordinarily I cannot stand reality tv shows, the two series that are animated are decent enough for a laugh-drawn together and total drama. There are even scientists that suggest a theory that the end of the world, as far as humans are concerned will be caused by reality tv shows. I don't personally agree with this belief, but I can at times certainly see where such a theory could exist though. Honestly, shows like survivor just bore me, deadliest catch is only really okay in my book because I grew up in Alaska and heard about such fishing trips, knew people who would regularly go on them. This series appeals more to my facination with the Fallout RPG series, surviving in a world where people have been nearly wiped out. Having to actually deal with possible contamination, disease, aggressors, scavenging. In the survivor scenario, there is food and water all around them if you only just know where to look. In such a setting as this, you have to get more creative because there are so many unknown factors involved. Would have only been made better if they had to also contend with traps-not that they didn't work on security on their initial facility, but I mean actually trip-wires hidden around the places they visit in search of food. I mean, even a bunch of cans on strings! But, never-the-less, a good show. I especially enjoyed when they scavenged the solar panals, found that all rather intersting. I know that the people that are sent in to antagonize the group-the marauders, raiders, the two people who had originally lived in their facility, were always instructed not to hurt anybody, but, I mean, the people do realize of course that its a show. Would be a bit over the top if the colonists should start to make weapons that they really intended to use, I mean, what if the colonists really did end up beating one of the outsiders to death? End up eating the remains...Decorating with the skeleton and skins? Now that would be interesting, but it wouldn't make it on TV.

4208338,5,B003V8FYKY,"As a behavioral analyst there are several scenarios where ethical scientific testing won't allow us to go.  In order to go to THOSE! places you have to make it a reality show and though that's normally indication what you're going to watch is really ""B"" material.  Such is not the case with ""The Colony."" Though the behaviorists probably talk too much during the show, one can't help themselves from wanting to talk to the guy/girl next to you and discuss what you would have done/would do were you in the same situation.  Yes, you find yourself screaming at the screen at times trying to give the participants some clue as to what they should be doing or shouldn't be doing, almost even to the morbid point of finding yourself staring open mouthed as some of the harder hitting things happening (like the participants getting their food, survival items taken from them by researcher provided marauders), much in the same way you can't help but stand up and cheer when you see the participants do surprisingly well for themselves (like when the blonde housewife tries to take off the head of one of the researcher provided bad guys, or when a dwarfed martial artist drops one of the huge, muscle-bound researcher provided bad guys to the mat with a roundhouse kick to the head).  Plain and simple, this is riveting television.  By the time the end rolls around, if you haven't come to the opinion brain-washing is absolutely possible, you're a bit dim!

He is annoying, bossy, and clearly added to the show to create conflict so we aren't watching ten hours of Mythbuster-like collaboration.  I got heartily sick of having him featured over and over again over equally qualified and active people in the Colony.  Also, having a well known B actor on the team made it difficult to give the ""experiment"" credulity.  Add to that the LA version of post-apocalyptic marauders (bikers in brand new leather jackets on Harleys) and the large number of colonists who never seemed to take the setting seriously you pretty much never get caught up in the drama they try to edit into each episode because it's so clearly faked (it's a reality show, I should be able to suspend my disbelief that it's all scripted a little bit).

The inventions they come up with are genuinely interesting, and the collaboration and preparations they make for survival are what kept me watching the season.  I just got sick of their attempts to Mad Max up the story every episode while reminding us constantly that this is an experiment and that no one is going to be hurt.

There cross section just includes highly competent engineers and mechanics and a fabrication worker with all the tools these guys need to come up with some off the wall and unlikely solutions to surviving.

8406497,5,B003V8FYKY,"Loved this series. As far as I know there are only two seasons, neither are associated with each other they stand alone with a fresh start on each one so you could watch season two and then season one. I wish they would make more. Literally one of the best reality series I've seen. The survival scenario is pretty realistic from what I've read happened in places like Argentina and Bosnia when the SHTF. This series really gets you thinking how you would transition from survival mode to being able to thrive which is the ultimate goal. Watching how they have to work together and deal with internal and external conflict is interesting. One thing is for sure from what I have read happened in other collapsed countries is the govt and law enforcement will not be around to help you and most likely will be trying to take from you, so putting together a quick group and getting on the same page early on is vital. Lets just say it looks hard and stressful with little room for error.",1451347200,3,984,4.472222222222222
