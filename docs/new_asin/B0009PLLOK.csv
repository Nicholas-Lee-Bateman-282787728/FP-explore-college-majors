8064739,5,B0009PLLOK,"Tales from the Future is a collection of 9 science fiction movies that have only one thing in common: they are all public domain and as such it is possible for them to be presented in highly affordable collections. I paid $9.98 for my set and that comes down to about one dollar per movie. The way that movie tickets cost nowadays, you really cannot complain about this collection.

An added bonus of this collection is the fact that  hardly any of these movies are available on other public domain collections. Additionally, there are a pair of silent movies, The Lost World & Metropolis, in this collection. Given the scarcity of good silent films on DVD, this adds to the luster of this collection. All in all, Tales from the Future is a great 9 movie collection.

Anyways, here is how I rate the movies in Tales from the Future:

Great:

The Lost World (1925)
Metropolis (1927)

Good:
Frozen Alive (1964)
Slipstream (1989)
Things to Come (1936)

Average:

The Day Time Ended (1980)
Journey to the Center of Time (1967)
Unknown World (1951)

Bad:

In the Year 2889 (1967)",1199232000,4,1074,4.634920634920635
8064740,3,B0009PLLOK,"In the 3-DVD set, TALES FROM THE FUTURE, the three oldest films (including two silent features) are without question the best known of the lot. What's left over is obscure and deservedly so.

Fritz Lang's masterpiece, METROPOLIS, always manages to look futuristic, even 80 years after its initial release. THE LOST WORLD has primitive special effects compared to modern cinematic techniques. It does however offer us a chance to see the great Sir Arthur Conan Doyle himself. The work of another famous British author, H.G. Wells is adapted for the screen in THINGS TO COME. The man's prescience was uncanny-- he foresaw a decade long second world war-- and turned out to be wrong only in the cataclysm's duration, and not by much.

Speaking of cataclysm-- the less said about the remainder of this collection, the better. These stinkers were near-cataclysmic career moves for Mark Hamill, Bill Paxton, Paul Petersen (of the DONNA REED SHOW) and Dorothy Malone, among others.
