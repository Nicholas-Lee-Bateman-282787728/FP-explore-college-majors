4558118,5,B005452D24,I love this Elvis collection.  This DVD set includes some of Elvis's most classic performances from 1956 all the way up to a few weeks before he passed away.  It really brings me back to the time when he was the hottest thing on the music scene.  A nice bonus in this collection are the interviews with his close friends and musicians and the personal home movies of Elvis. Definitely worth the $15!,1307577600,59,399,4.438356164383562

no rock n roll. He went on to perform all kinds of music which he could do it all. This has some great
TV appearances that many of us were not even born yet and shows his power over the audiences

She see these DVDs all night and Day, 24/7 it seems. I go for a visit and she watching one of his movies. I'm getting a bit tired of it but she is just crazy over heel for him even after nearly 40 years after he died. Thank You Amazon for having all of his movies and the other DVDs on him to complete my mother's collections!!!!",1346889600,,499,3.9504950495049505
4558401,3,B005452D24,"I love Elvis, and I love the footage.  But I have absolutely no idea why performances of Elvis onstage and from movies are sometimes overdubbed with Elvis singing the same songs in studio.  It ruins the charm of ""great performances.""  Sorry to two greats who put this together, George Klein and Jerry Schilling.",1331251200,19,311,4.830188679245283
4558402,1,B005452D24,"Welp here is a word of warning. If you don't have a widescreen tv do not buy this release. Buy the previous dvd release of this from the 90s.

What they have done is places a 4x3 picture inside a 16x9 widescreen. The result is when you watch it on a full screen tv, the pciture has black bars on the top and bottom as well as the left and right sides..

A TOTAL Ripoff. When are companies going to wake up and see that more people still have full screen tvs than widescreen tvs.

Why not give us a true 4x3 picture as it was shown back in the day..???",1321488000,10,551,3.945945945945946
4558403,5,B005452D24,"There are a number of great Elvis collections out there, but this one is my favorite for the following reasons:
1. Spans just about his whole career from when he was taking off in 1956 to right before he died
2. Includes home videos of Elvis with friends and family - really gives you another side to the man
3. Really interesting interviews with legends and friends of Elvis like Jerry Lee Lewis & Sam Phillips
4. You really can't get more Elvis performances and songs for this price.",1317340800,23,485,4.46067415730337
4558414,5,B005452D24,Elvis!  The King!  He is the most important man in rock and roll and this comprehensive set shows why.  I was really impressed with the restoration of the material and fascinated by the interviews with Carl Perkins and Jerry Lee Lewis.  This definitely captures Elvis at his liveliest!  Every Elvis fan should own this to enjoy his brilliant performances!,1317254400,3,355,4.9491525423728815

4558416,5,B005452D24,This collection is a treasure for everyone who loves Elvis and also for those who are not familiar with his wonderful work.  He is the greatest entertainer who ever lived...with no doubt!,1316390400,19,187,4.84375
4558417,5,B005452D24,"Brilliant DVD, but it's Elvis so it would be, amazing man whose life was cut short, a must buy for any fan, the way he moved on stage makes my legs go to jelly, and makes my heart beat faster",1316044800,7,191,3.8
4558418,5,B005452D24,"Very good delivery. This item gives you a fine view of how Elvis works on stage.
I think that this item is a must for the real Elvis fan.",1315526400,7,137,3.7586206896551726
4558419,3,B005452D24,"This DVD collection is recommended for the new Elvis collector, as most of the material is included on other Elvis DVDs.  The DVD includes some (but not all) of the classic performances of Elvis' career.  I prefer the footage from his concert performances, but you also see snippets from some of Elvis' movies.  The bonus material is a collection of commentaries from fellow musicians like Carl Perkins, Scotty Moore, DJ Fontana, Jerry Lee Lewis, and comedian Milton Berle, which I had not seen before.  The commentaries from his peers reflect the respect and admiration that they had for Elvis, the greatest entertainer of our lifetime.",1312848000,13,637,5.038095238095238
4558420,5,B005452D24,"I think this release is an excellent collection for the longtime fan as well as those new to Elvis.  This new edition takes the first 2 of the ""Great Performances"" specials and remasters most of the video, and adds interviews with some of Elvis' fellow musicians as bonus features.  This doesn't include the 3rd ""Great Performances"" special, but that one consisted mostly of Elvis' Ed Sullivan appearances, which are easily found on the Elvis on Ed Sullivan DVDs.  Its good to have these specials back on the market since they were hard to find new for a while there, and the remastered video looks very nice.  With these you get a some of every era of Elvis, so it provides a good overall picture of him as a performer.  Thumbs up!",1312416000,47,732,4.557251908396947
4558421,1,B005452D24,"Of course 2 hours of Elvis (why it is on 2 DVDs is just to give the impression of more and charge more)....is always 5 stars!  My rating is because until I stuck it into my player I had no idea I was repurchasing DVDs I've owned for years with different artwork etc.  If you have the 3 Elvis DVDs or the 3 DVD set...<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Elvis-The-Great-Performances-Box-Set/dp/B000069HST/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Elvis - The Great Performances Box Set</a>&nbsp;you have all this so SKIP!

My one star rating is to try and make others take a second look.....and make sure before buying. I can't imagine any fan already not owning these.

Its obvious by the low helpful rating that people aren't reading my review but are ELVIS fans who think I'm bashing the King. As I said in my review...its just to let others like me who jump on anything new ELVIS ...check before wasting money. The one star isn't going to hurt Elvis....its to help.. excuse me.",1312416000,81,998,5.104294478527607
4558422,5,B005452D24,"I really recommend you buy this DVD!  If you're an Elvis fan (I am!) or simply admire good music, then you will love ""Elvis- The Great Performances"". Not only it includes more than 30 performances of his greatest hits and other bonus features, but also the quality of it is superb. The videos were great and it really made me feel like I was a part of those performances. I was surprised to see that there's even an option to listen to it in 5.1 Audio, which I recommend you do, because it enhances the quality of his music even more. I'm very happy and satisfied with my new purchase.",1312329600,83,585,4.318181818181818
4558423,5,B005452D24,"I really enjoyed the new bonus material and Elvis sounds incredible in 5.1 audio.  My favorite Presley performances were:

1. Suspicious Minds
2. Don't Be Cruel
3. Return To Sender

""Ready Teddy"" on The Ed Sullivan Show is also an all-time classic.  I'm happy with my purchase and don't have any real complaints at the moment.  For those reasons I have to give it 5 stars!",1312329600,42,372,4.575757575757576
