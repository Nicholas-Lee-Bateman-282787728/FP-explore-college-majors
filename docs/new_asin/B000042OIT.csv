7919630,2,B000042OIT,"I am a new climber. And I'm not an 18 year old boy. After watching this, I want to produce my own video on climbing! It was interesting to watch these excellent climbers but I'm not sure I am pumped to go out and climb. (Or  drink a gallon of milk and puke.) My problem is that I can not find any  instructional type videos on climbing. This was the first one I watched.  So, overall I was a little disappointed. It looks like some young  inexperienced group of boys shot this with a camcorder. So if you are a  young male climber, you will probably like this. If you are a 42 year old  female videographer, you will be less likely to be impressed!",961286400,11,648,4.144
7919631,3,B000042OIT,Good bouldering and sport climbing footage. Some of the trickswere puerile - I like to watch climbing videos many times but howoften can  you watch climbers puke milk and blow wads of snot? I guess its all in good  fun. How about presenting some more women climbers - some of them are quite  good these days. Would also like to see more locations identified. Sharma  was awesome.,959299200,2,379,4.611940298507463
7919632,5,B000042OIT,This is a great video!  Excellent climbing and boldering!  Good sound track!,959212800,,76,5.25
7919633,5,B000042OIT,"Fast paced, full of action and killer tunes, Inertia gets you psyched to go out and climb. I don't know what others look for in a climibng video, but I want something that inspires. If I wanted to learn something or get  touch with nature I wouldn't be watching videos. What this video does for  me is it gets my heart pumping and my hands sweaty. It gets me psyched to  go out and crank.",958089600,,388,4.1466666666666665
7919634,4,B000042OIT,"Having watched this movie several times I have to say that it certainly is bouldering focused.  But there's also the fun and bonding experience that is eloquently portrayed throughout the movie.  We all know how much fun we  have both on and off the rock and this movie does a great job of capturing  the essence of rock climbing.  But don't let what I just said fool you into  thinking there isn't hard core climbing involved.  Yes, they don't show a  lot of top offs and achor clips but who cares?  We are talking about  pulling moves and being inspired not showing each other how rad we are!  These guys get down to work.  I wonder about how of those critizing the  movie are pulling down V10s?  Overall, it shows some great bouldering,  something which is dear to my heart.",954115200,2,777,4.45
7919635,5,B000042OIT,"Though it's a tad rough, Paul still comes through with a some of the sickest footage ever for a climbing video.  I really got a sense of the local area and it's inhabitants--with all their shenanigans and tomfoolery.  It was fun to watch and I'm already waiting for his second video to come  out.  A must see!",952041600,4,309,4.368421052631579
7919636,5,B000042OIT,"This is probably The best climbing video I have ever seen. The director captures the essence of climbing and translates it into a package of video and sound that is un-F'n-Believeable. Even If you don't climb, you will  love this video even more because some of the incredible angles and sick  manuevers this show will put you through.",951955200,6,335,4.758620689655173
7919637,1,B000042OIT,"Wow.  I can't believe that anybody could find something positive to say about this video.  Out of the dozens of climbing videos I've seen, this is close to the worst.  The footage is terrible, and clips are often repeated  three or four times during the video to make it seem longer.  I know retail  stores that struggle with this video since multiple customers try to return  it, aghast at the absurdity of charging money for such boyish dabbling in  video.  You want a good video?  Buy ""The Real Thing,"" ""Free  Hueco,"" or ANYTHING but this!",951868800,4,542,4.6
7919638,5,B000042OIT,"I have seen many climbing videos, Inertia is by far the best.  This video captures the energy and pace of rock climbing.  Many videos fall short, not inertia.  I recomend this video to climbers and non-climbers a like.  The  party tricks are classic and the soundtrack rocks.",951264000,,275,4.76595744680851
