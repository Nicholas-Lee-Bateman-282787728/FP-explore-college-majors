8281898,5,B001B476GA,"A must have baby care guide for every new mother! Add this to your baby registry it will be the best gift ever. I received mine in a nice gift case with 6 DVD's in it. Each DVD focuses on a different topic for guiding you in caring for your infant up to age 3. Highly recommended. I like this better than the books as you see real life parents actually doing caring while the narrater talks about the steps. The 1st DVD talks about step by step to breastfeeding where you see mothers using different techniques, things that the baby might do that's normal etc, then it goes on to show you how to mix and feed formulas, teething, doctor visits, immunizations, when to introduce solids, all the time you're there with a mother at the doctors, they show a vaccination being given, a mother mixing formula in kitchen, a nurse guiding a mother in breast feeding, tips from the doctor on feeding, fusy eaters and much more. That's just the 1st DVD. Better than a book in my opinion.",1334793600,,976,4.397790055248619
