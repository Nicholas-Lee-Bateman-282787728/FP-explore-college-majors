8194871,3,B000Q7IG9O,"This version of Shaolin & Wu Tang is released from Hemdale Home Video.  The back cover indicates, ""Dubbed and Subbed"".  Dubbed alright, no subs at all.
Quality appears to be a DVD-R at best of a VHS heavily used.
1.33:1 so much of the action is cut off (I had the original VHS from the 80's that got damaged).

Great movie.  Worth the purchase if you can't get a hold of a better quality disc",1226707200,,392,4.1866666666666665
