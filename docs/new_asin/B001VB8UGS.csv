3820227,5,B001VB8UGS,"If you watched The Waltons back in the day and liked the show you will love this complete set. I had missed a few of the original episodes and forgotten alot more. This show truly shows a kinder, gentler way of life with some excellent family values and lessons along the way. The acting is VERY beleivable (put me in tears a few times) especially for a cast so young. I would recommend it for young and old alike. My 17 yr. old thought it was sappy and laughed at us, now she is asking ""aren't we gonna watch some John-boy""? It really does hold something for everybody.",1264982400,2,570,4.287037037037037
3820228,1,B001VB8UGS,"We purchased the entire Walton's series for our daughter who is hearing impaired. The Jacket of each season's video shows the Universay Symbol for Closed Captioned for the Hearing Imparied (CC). There is a major problem in that none of the ones we have palyed so far, is closed captioned. The irony of this is that the first program is about a deaf girl!
What a cruel misrepresentation! Warner Brothers has had closed captioned segments appearing on television, that is what prompted us to buy the series. Does anyone in this industry have a conscience?",1262304000,15,553,4.831578947368421

3820250,1,B001VB8UGS,"I bought this box set and have been watching each DVD in the series as time allows since I received it in Sept . I currently started season 9 and the first disc does not work properly. It runs fine to start and once starting the third episode on both sides the disc basically freezes up and will no longer work, both sides of the disc do this. Second disc is doing the same thing. After paying over $100 you would think it would work 100%. All discs in season 9 are not working, I haven't started the next set in the series but I am very disappointed.",1515369600,2,551,4.111111111111111

3820254,2,B001VB8UGS,Good series. Problem is I ordered it and later seasons keep skipping when I watch them. Something is wrong with most of season 9 and I can't watch them. By the time I made it to season 9 I could no longer return it. Also happened a few times in season 1 and 2 as well.,1514419200,,268,3.8035714285714284

3820259,2,B001VB8UGS,"There were issues with many of the discs, i.e., episodes would not play or multiple scenes would be skipped over, making the episode worthless.  These discs weren't viewed until after the ""window to return"" closed so now we're stuck with a box set that is incomplete.  The box set was a gift for my husband and we are both extremely disappointed with the quality of this ""collection.""",1511740800,7,384,4.7164179104477615

3820266,5,B001VB8UGS,"Always loved the Waltons and was sad to see the reruns taken off air.  Exactly the type of show I like to watch to unwind.  Quality of dvd's are okay so far (haven't gotten through them all),  but I have noticed that sometimes evening scenes are quite dark and not always able to see.  Not sure if this was how they were originally filmed due to effect of the darkness on the mountain, or in the making of the dvd's.

3820297,4,B001VB8UGS,"I've been watching the Waltons on tv for many years, but I had never seen the entire series from beginning to end. My husband, knowing that I enjoyed the series, gave me the complete set for Christmas. Now that I've watched the entire set (including movies), I realize how much I had missed by watching it on tv as time allowed.

Seasons 1-7 are single side discs, but seasons 8-9 are on double-sided discs. I'm not sure why they decided to go with the double-sided discs. I'm not a fan of double-sided discs as they tend to have more issues than a regular disc. Thankfully, I only had a small glitch in one episode during season 8. The rest of the discs played well.

The movies are included on 3 discs with 2 movies per disc. I had seen the first 3 movies on tv, but I had never seen the last 3 movies. It was interesting to see how the lives of the Waltons played out over time. The original family core remained strong, but they definitely changed with the times. The final 3 movies definitely had a different feel to them, and there were some serious inconsistencies that took place from the shows to the movies and even within the movies themselves.

The show is family friendly while still addressing some tough issues that come with growing up (relationships, alcohol, smoking...). They also addressed society issues such as slavery, racial tension, war... While there is some language in the shows, it is very tame compared to today's television series.",1457913600,11,1462,4.593869731800766

3820363,4,B001VB8UGS,"I have watched the entire series (except for season 9) since it was released on to DVD. This includes the Walton ""Movies"" made after the show ended regular production. Since I have not seen season 9 I reserve the (full) 5th star until that point.

It is a wonderful series about family, their struggles and their triumphs, history in rural America, and the great Depression. The cast were all fine actors. My favorites within the Walton clan itself would be Grandpa and Grandma, Jason, Erin, and Elizabeth. John and Olivia were good too. John-Boy also did a great job. I think it was a mistake for him to bow out after the 5th season (making token appearances after that). They later brought another actor to fill his shoes, but no offense, there could only be one true John-Boy in a series like this.

The stories were very nice. It always pointed out that a family that large could also experience conflicts (like John and Ben as an adult not seeing eye-to-eye).

One thing I think they overdid was to deify President Franklin D. Roosevelt. While he may have been the best person to lead the country at that time, he was not the best president. It could be argued that his policies deepened the suffering during the Great Depression. However, to the writer's credit, they did manage to interject between the lines that government back then did make some mistakes. So there is some balance.

Olivia Walton (Michael Learned) was a fine character (actor) too. I wish she had also not left the series before its demise. I think John, the father and the newer characters like Rose and her two grandchildren added some new life to the maturing series.

Perhaps touching for me was the fact that I grew up with the Walton Family children, literally. I am somewhere around Mary Ellen (and Ben's) age. It was fun to watch these youngsters growing through life and to share some similar things kids (that age) go through that are timeless.

It is definitely worth the investment. I hope to get the 9th and final season sometime soon. P.S. It was good to see Richard Thomas return for some of the last ""Movie Episodes"".",1312588800,2,2110,4.64343163538874

When we opened the package, we found a bunch of generic DVDs with white labels stuck to identify various Seasons and episodes.  It looks like someone got a stack of DVDs and started burning illegal copies.  No shrink wrapping or any copyright information.  Many of the discs don't work properly and the quality of the videos is not great.  My mom was nervous when she received a package with Chinese writing on it instead of the amazon.com box she was expecting.  It sounds like this has happened before so it might be best to buy this at a store where you can see what you are actually getting.  The TV show itself is great but these discs appear to be illegally made copies from China.  Not what I expect from amazon.

Plus, once this was ordered from Amazon, it went to a different source who confirmed the order, and disappeared from my Amazon account as an ""open"" or closed order.

3820372,5,B001VB8UGS,"I watched this with my parents and loved it. I watched it with my kids and loved it. Those times were, hands down, the best ""couch cuddle time"" memories that we have. My daughter bought the set to watch with her son and I watched it with my 9 1/2 y/o grand daughter. At first, she didn't want to watch some old tv show that I liked ""back in the day"", but as soon as I started watching one by myself she got involuntarily hooked.

The show brings up a lot of very good topics for discussion. Though the show starts in the Depression, the themes are still relevant today. We had many serious discussions, initiated by her, after each show ended. As an example, one show had a Jewish Professor and his family escaping Germany to stay at a friend's cabin on the mountain. This was a good opportunity to get into a beginners level discussion of WWII, the Holocaust, anti-semitism, different religions, tolerance, etc. That was one of the more serious themes.

Each episode is chock full of family related issues, sometimes fun and sometimes serious, but always thought provoking and entertaining. As a bonus, each show depicts thrift and self reliance, things kids could use some lessons on.

Can't wait to get to the Walton's Mountain Museum!

I watched them, at least some or them when they were first produced, then have seen many in re-runs , but not in any certain order.  This time, I watched from day 1 all the way through 9 years.  I never realized how much history could be learned from the series, getting a bird's eye view of the Greta Depression and then the start of the Nazi takeover in Europe and eventually the US involvement.  Everything was historically correct, not just the script, but the sets and props as well.  Occasionally you could catch a prop or 2 that would have been impossible in the early 1940's....like plastic!  I watched the complete series of Little House on the Prairie, then the complete Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman, before I watched The Walton's. This was like a history of the US starting at the conclusion of the War Between the States all the way until`the mid-late 20th century.  I purchased these video sets with the intention of selling after watching, but now I plan to keep them in my collection.  Would be great to watch every 5-10 years to compare things then with now, especially politics and civil rights which are surprisingly the same.",1270857600,6,1193,4.679425837320574
