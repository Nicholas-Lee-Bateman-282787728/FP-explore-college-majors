8132902,5,B000GIXCBK,"I don't think this show is intended for children, but there is no part in which children cannot see. I enjoyed it as the story is nicely devolped and creates a reasonable place for you to suspend your disbelief. It also opens doors for open communication between parent and child to discuss religion, fear, roles of men and women in society, the differences in culture. My daughter is much more well adjusted and tolerant of differences partially because of this show. Not to mention Kentaro is Hilarious!",1173312000,,505,4.816091954022989
