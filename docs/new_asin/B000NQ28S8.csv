8180614,4,B000NQ28S8,"this movie was intense. there is so much meaning and so much absurdity to it. bt fernando arrabel is def. on eof the best and unique filmmakers out there. his visions ans representation of these visions, are unmistakably one of a kind! if u ove freaky films in general, or a film enthusiest, watch this movie!",1314576000,,309,4.535714285714286
8180615,3,B000NQ28S8,"Really liked 'I will walk like a crazy horse'.
This one is more tame. Something you can watch without your girlfriend leaving the room.
Not as far out as I expected,but still ok.",1285372800,,178,4.424242424242424
8180616,5,B000NQ28S8,"There were two great surrealist filmmakers/playwrights in the Panic Movement, Alejandro Jodorowsky and Fernando Arrabal.  Jodorowsky is the better known of the two (and is more talented in my opinion), but Arrabal's films are still pretty good.  This is his best film, a shocking, visceral (to say the least), surreal diatribe against Franco's Spain, fascism, the Catholic church, and just about everything.

There are many phenomenal scenes in the film.  The opening credits scene is wonderful.  It's designed by Roland Topor, who made the magnificent Fantastic Planet.  There's a scene where a priest ""eats"" (which is pretty shocking even today, so you can imagine the outrage back in the 1970's when this film was made), and the scene in which the mother in the film dances in a pool of cow's blood (WARNING!  The scene shows a cow getting slaughtered).  It's one of the most visceral scenes I've ever seen, but it does work in the context of the film.  The film really doesn't have any spiritual elements like a lot of Alejandro's work does.  It feels to me to be the work of a rabid atheist, one who just hates religion and just wants to trash the Catholic church without finding (or attempting to find) an outlet for the spiritual in man.

Even though the film was shot originally in French, the Spanish language dub is actually better.  Arrabal isn't as deep of an artist as Alejandro Jodorowsky is, but this film is his best.  It's also available in the box set The Fernando Arrabal Collection, but the other two films in that set, I Will Walk Like a Crazy Horse and The Guernica Tree, are not as good as Viva la Muerte.  If you decide to buy an Arrabal film, make it this one.  Rent the other two.

There is a very strange interview on this DVD with Arrabal, who looks pissed through the whole thing.  He holds a chair during some of it, doesn't seem inclined to answer questions, and takes his shoe off and smells inside of it.  I'm not sure why he was doing this (a bit of performance art, perhaps), but it's silly and distracting.  He was interviewed for a documentary on Jodorowsky (which is available in Anchor Bay's box set of Alejandro's work), and Arrabal was much more cohesive and straightforward than he is here.  The interview is worth watching initially, but you'll grow tired of Arrabal's childishness very quickly.

Despite some reservations, Viva la Muerte is worth picking up.",1208476800,,2402,4.712230215827338
8180617,5,B000NQ28S8,A must see for any lover of surrealist movies. Viva La Muerte along with The Holy Mountain and El Topo are the 70's surrealist Masterpieces (panic movement). Not for the faint hearted!!!,1114128000,2,186,4.84375
8180618,5,B000NQ28S8,"When I first saw Viva La Muerte I was 21 and living in Melbourne, Australia.  It ran for two months at weekend midnight screenings, and I've never been more impressed by a film.  This is most definitely an art movie, and its mere existence makes most ""art"" movies turn into television commercials for the brainless masses.  It is set in the spanish civil war, but it could be Iraq, Afghanistan or Bosnia or wherever the next war is engineered.  It concerns a family torn apart by war.  The mother has reported her husband to the authorities, telling them that he is a communist.  Whether he is or is not is irrelevant.  It is a convenient way for her to get rid of him.  Their child, a seven or eight year old boy, keeps asking the mother where is his father.  She tells him his father ran away because he is a coward.  We see pictures of the father being horrendously tortured by the authorities.  The brutal imagery used to define these events is quite blunt and never veers from the truth.  It shows how communism is just a word, and that the human urge to hurt others and conveniently dispose of the unwanted is so readily utilized by people's self-interests.  This film reminds us who we are, how we are naive and reasonably innocent when we are young, and how idealists are just fodder for the savage beings we so quickly develop into when we don't get what we want.  It's a humbling film that reminds us of how far we have to go before we can declare we are good people.",1107043200,3,1477,4.382352941176471
8180619,5,B000NQ28S8,"A film that quivers on the fringe, the fringe of ideas, of intuitive mysticism, as it probes into the artifices of intelectual snobery. It is playful, it is violent and disquieting, it touches and transforms conventions, in what has now become a classical preconception of surrealism

-That is: yes, in some aspects the film is outdated, since it is in fact a response to the time in which it was created - but as anything with actual content, it is, timeless. Though maybe not timeless for everyone.

  The film is the creation of a man that is obsessed in probing the fibers of reality, and bringing out the bloody absurdity of man.

  This type of movie is not concerned with moviemaking in the more orthodox sense that Tarkovsky or Kurosawa, for example, are. This is the vision of a creative man using film to express ideas, they are brought to us by a film. There is no way to compare the approach you might have in viewing the great film makers as in wiewing Arrabal. But he uses the medium quite well, and in his joviality you can spot the similarities with Jodorowsky.

  This DVD release is quite good. Aside from the great movie you get an interview with Arrabal. In this interview, Arrabal delivers an image of a man that is immersed in his persona -he takes his shoe off and is holding it up to his head-, a person fractured and irreverent, in such a way that makes you wonder what his real intentions may be, is this intentional or not? it doesn't. But if you know anything about him it is clear he is an intelligent person. When you see the movie you are not concerned with these questions. You are just put face to face with ideas. And ideas are powerful depending on how you may put them to use. So there you are, faced with ideas tied together in panic fashion.",1104796800,10,1779,4.429447852760736
