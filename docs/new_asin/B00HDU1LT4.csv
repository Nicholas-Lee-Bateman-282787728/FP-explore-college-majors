Story-wise, I thought it was well-paced and poignant. Nothing is brought up that isn't addressed else-where in the film, which is incredibly smart writing.  The character designs are adorable and the cast of characters is always a pleasure to see on-screen.",1392768000,7,412,5.212121212121212

6155183,5,B00HDU1LT4,"I have watched the series of Blue Exorcist and I really enjoyed it.  So, when I saw that a movie had come out, I had to watch it ASAP.  I am really glad I did.  Let me throw in a small caveat.  I have not read any of the manga series, so I do not know how this anime compares to the manga.  However, that being said I really enjoyed this movie.  The movie has all of the characters from the TV series that I loved and some great new additions.

Summary:
Rin and his friends along with the rest of the True Cross Academy Town are getting ready for a festival.  Rin, his twin brother Yukio, and (his love interest?) Shiemi are sent on a mission to exorcise a demon train.  As usual, Rin starts to cause more problems than he solves for his brother Yukio.  They end up creating a huge mess and destroying a shrine holding a demon sealed.  The little demon (Usamaro) becomes Rin's responsibility until the end of the festival as punishment for screwing up so badly.  Rin, being the spawn of Satan (literally), feels empathy for Usamaro.  Will the festival go off without a hitch?  Will Rin manage to keep Usamaro under control?  Well, you will have to watch this movie to find out.

Overall, I really enjoyed this movie.  The art work was great and the movie was at times funny, sad, and just plain weird.  If you are a fan of Blue Exorcist already, you should definitely watch this movie.  If you are new to Blue Exorcist, this is a great starting point to the Blue Exorcist universe.",1408060800,3,1481,4.300724637681159

8631747,1,B00HDU1LT4,"Unfortunately, this disc did not work in any of our devices. I'm not sure if it is just a bum disc, or if it only works in DVD players overseas. It was not noted as such in the description, and shouldn't have been available for purchase in the US if that was indeed the case. Either way, I have a very disappointed daughter... She was really looking forward to this when she opened it at Christmas, but it is worthless.",1483401600,2,419,4.25
