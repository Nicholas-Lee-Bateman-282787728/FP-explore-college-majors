8236387,5,B000ZUDN0O,"I usually don't like to watch letterbox films, but this movie really surprised me as to how good it turns out. The text is not accurate, but you catch on really quick that the content that is missing is what you pick up in watching the action, and there is plenty of action! Like the detective himself, you will not know what is really going on until it is all over. Great film!",1392681600,,378,4.191780821917808
8236388,4,B000ZUDN0O,"Think Sam Spade in a different land
with radically different culture
and add a little spookiness
and you've got a winner.

Fans of the Pang Brothers
(The Eye, The Tesseract, Diary, Recycle)
will not be disappointed by this excellent
movie by these great film-makers.
It will appeal to all who like murder mysteries
and detective stories.

It is the gritty urban Thailand setting that
adds a lot of intersest for me because
it sets the movie apart within its genre.
It is filmed in a gritty realism style.

Plenty of action, great acting
and an excellent plot and dialog.

Spoiler:
It even has some of the Pang's signature
spookiness in it.

Highly recommended.",1360022400,2,660,4.8053097345132745
8236389,5,B000ZUDN0O,I cannot say anything more than what the first reviewer said about this movie. I was pleasantly surprised by how this murder mystery gripped me all the way through until the final credits. This is a very good movie and I am ashamed to say that I had never heard of it before I purchased it. I was looking for another movie when I found it on Amazon. It is much better than many similar movies from the USA or anywhere else in the world for that matter.,1340582400,,452,4.1477272727272725
8236390,5,B000ZUDN0O,"The Detective is a really, really good movie produced in 2007.  A down on his luck detective Tam (Aaron Kwok), living in the Chinatown area of Bangkok, is asked to work on a case by a man who believes a woman is trying to kill him. He comes to detective Tam's less than stylish office with a photo of the woman and cash for Tam. What follows is an interesting and downright nail biting detective story. Every lead Tam follows seems to turn up another suicide or another murdered body.  Then people are trying to kill Tam himself in downright frightening ways. An old police detective friend of Tam's, Fung Chak (Liu Kai-chi) helps Tam out in his investigations but at first does not see the connections in the killings that Tam seems to see. These two have great chemistry on screen and both give excellent acting performances. I thought this movie was brilliant and also scarey. The back alleys of Bangkok at night with Tam trying to hunt down his killer was really full of edge of your chair tension. The ending is a Big surprise for the viewer. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes a really great detective story and I look forward with much anticipation to the US release at some point of the new sequal movie Detective 2 which stars the same excellent two players. Good cinematography, storyline and acting!!! The Detective is Highly Recommended!",1338595200,2,1357,4.626556016597511
