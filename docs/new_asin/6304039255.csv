764819,5,6304039255,I love history and I especially loved the characters in this film.  They all did excellent jobs in bring to us the racism that permeated the armed service during WW II.  The scenery was great and I thought the actors did  an excellent job in portraying the lives of the actual men who served in  that squadron during the war....,922752000,,328,4.416666666666667
764820,5,6304039255,I watched this movie in school and there wasn't a single dry eye left when the movie was over.  You really felt like you could relate to the men in the movie.  It's got to be one of the best movies I have ever seen!!  I  recommend this to anyone.,912124800,,246,3.86

764980,4,6304039255,"Wonderful movie!  I never knew, and realize that these pilots most likely saved my great-uncle Ruby's life.  Rubein Zager was a bombardier in the Army Air Corps, and he knew full-well what the Nazis would've done to a Jew if he were ever forced to bail-out of his flying fortress.  The fact that he was even around to talk to my dad about his war experience when I was little, tells me how dangerous it was back then.  Uncle Ruby only confessed ONCE that he was in the war, and that phenomenon was common among soldiers who saw actual combat.",1515801600,,542,4.39

765079,3,6304039255,"I agree with many here that the movie was decent entertainment but the script writing especially was bad.  Even the actors, as good as they have been in other movies, were not good enough to rescue this movie from the poor screenwriting and bad directing.  It seems obvious to me that the producers, writers and director were much more interested in bringing out the evils, struggles and unfairness brought about by racism rather than the accomplishments,( both personal and historical) bravery and the heroism of this great fighting force.  This movie, in my opinion, suffers from political correctness and clicheism.  That is too bad because it is such a great story.  The actors should have demanded better dialogue, the director should have dug deeper for a better vision of the story. He also should have insisted for more from the writers and the producers.  It's 3 stars for the story, certainly not for the movie.",1506384000,,921,4.909677419354839
765080,5,6304039255,"Great film to drive home the what men of remarkable character possess through Godly and patriotic principles. The viewing experience is a strong motivator to strive for personal courage and the work ethic.  The movie also reminded me of the ugly past racial bias and unjustified discrimination. Other than the incessant portrays of men smoking, this film I highly recommend.",1505433600,,374,5.233333333333333
765081,3,6304039255,"While compelling in some areas, the movie suffers from stilted dialogue and fairly one-dimensional characters. In part because of this, the mid-90's special effects seem especially dated. The movie chronicles a worthy story, touching on needed topics, but, suffers from problems which make the story feel a little cliche'd.",1503446400,,323,5.612244897959184
765082,5,6304039255,"Did their homework. The characters in the movie are based on real characters. Also, I am a veteran and I thought it was a fantastic production. Well done, but the best part... and there are many good things about this movie... is how the ""colored"" soldiers CHOSE to keep fighting and to be the best at what they did... even when they are rejected by the people they were fighting for and with. It becomes a matter of self identity. I cringe at the term, but I'm afraid there is no other: This movie is 'Beautifully Painful'",1503187200,,523,4.402061855670103

765144,5,6304039255,One of the best movies I've seen on amazon prime. It truly shows the history behind the Tuskegee airmen and their quest in becoming US Air Force pilots. I highly reccomend this movie.,1498521600,,183,4.575757575757576
765145,5,6304039255,This was a HBO movie about  the Tuskegee Airmen that actually was more compelling that the theatrically released later movie. It's well acted all around though no romantic relationship like in the other movie. There is a scene where Andre Braugher talks about how he feels about his country that is powerful and resonates even today. It's also interesting how we as a country went from men of color not having the skills or smarts to fight in WW II to excessively being drafted & sent to Vietnam especially in the latter years.,1498435200,,527,4.666666666666667

765232,2,6304039255,"I've read & watched hours of war memoirs, documentaries, etc.  I could not even finish this.  It was a huge injustice to these men that worked hard, trained and fought as men.  Strong, brave heroic MEN.  On par with a production like band of brothers or We Were Soldiers this script was very poor & seemed to depend on the success of the theme to earn a hit and not the quality of the script, scenes or training - basically the heart of noble men.  The actors did well for what they were given, but the director and writer did a huge injustice to these brave men.  I hope some day they redo it and show the sweat, work, heroism of the men.  I look forward to the day!
It's a good start and that's at least something.",1497052800,,716,4.144927536231884
765233,4,6304039255,"A good film about the Tuskegee Airmen, but a few issues irritated me: (Possible spoilers below):

When the group arrived in Italy they comment about having brand new P-51s. However, in the film they had P-51s in North Africa, where in reality they flew P-40s.

At the end of the movie it states they never lost a single bomber, this is objectively false. Over 179 missions they lost a total of 27 bombers, however this was still well below the average of other air groups.",1497052800,,472,4.541176470588235
765234,5,6304039255,"""The Tuskegee Airmen"" is a wonderful 1995 movie from HBO Studios, which chronicles the groundbreaking service of the first unit of African-American combat pilots in the United States Army Air Corps during World War II. The story line follows the trials and tribulations of these pilots as they struggle to overcome the obstacles and impediments that were prevalent during that era. The cast is superb, with excellent performances by Laurence Fishburne, Courtney B. Vance, Andre Braugher, Malcolm-Jamal Warner, Cuba Gooding, Jr., Allen Payne, Christopher McDonald, Daniel Hugh Kelly, Mekhi Phifer, John Lithgow, and Vivica A. Fox, to name a few. ""The Tuskegee Airmen"" is a decidedly touching and moving tribute to the unwavering dedication, skill, sacrifice, and patriotism of these renowned World War II aviators. ""The Tuskegee Airmen"" is an outstanding film, which is very engaging and entertaining, and which certainly merits a five-star rating, along with an enthusiastic recommendation.",1496707200,4,990,5.6066666666666665

765236,5,6304039255,"In my opinion this is a better movie than Red Tails, because it seems like it paints a more realistic picture of the lives of the Tuskegee Airmen.  As a kid my father took tap dancing lessons from one of the Airmen, before the Airman attended Stanford University.  With that I grew up hearing good things about these guys.

765404,5,6304039255,"As a USAF bomber pilot, my gratitude goes out to these valiant airmen.  The hard road to pilots wings is daunting enough for any US citizen, but particularly for these noble black pilots.  We are so proud to have been able to see their contributions to the war effort and their heroism, valor, and courage displayed.

One thing stood out in my mind as I watched this account of real-life heroes--and that is that they never stopped praying.  Their prayers were answered by a perfect record--never having lost a single bomber they escorted.

We must never forget the sacrifices these men made for our liberty and our heritage.  We are a nation of all races and colors, and we share a unique privilege in history of fighting and winning alongside men like these.  This movie was inspirational and exceptional; showing the finest our young men can be.

I really like this movie. Lawrence Fisburne is terrific as usual. Very realistic combat scenes. As a military fighter pilot (F/A-18D), I of course enjoy all things about flying. Movie is a great example of the sacrifices of the our guys in the military. The movie however continues to perpetuate the myth that the Tuskegee airmen were much better than other squadrons in WWII. They in fact DID lose bombers, their kill to loss ratio was among the worse in the military (barely over 1 to 1), and they never had a single ace.  This has been proven. Even the president of the Tuskegee Airmen Inc., retired Air Force Lt. Gen. Russell Davis, said he will no longer claim in speeches that the group never lost a bomber under its escort. Not sure why people want to exaggerate their record...it is impressive enough just fighting for America. Making claims that are false is a disservice to their very real achievements.

765778,5,6304039255,"Great Historical Movie of some amazing American fliers.  Yes there was some theatrical license but the movie does honor the men who had to persevere lots of bureaucratic and attitude challenges that would make most folks fail, but not these guys.  They showed honor, courage, intelligence, and great skill flying skills which translated into success in protecting B-17 bombers.  Apparently, one of the airmen actually sunk a German destroyer with machine gun fire by hitting a powder magazine which blew up.  The movie left out certain facts about which air planes they flew on the different missions and I think they named the wrong guy who few the first lady Eleanor Roosevelt on a plane ride. Trying to fit all of those details into the movie would likely detract from the real story -- American heroes risking everything to fight against the enemies of World War II.",1486339200,5,870,4.8979591836734695

767206,4,6304039255,These airmen were gifted and spectacular in their abilities - as they should be to have made it into the aircorp. We enjoy 'Real life ' dramatization such as this one. It was revealed how difficult it was to overcome the prejudices from some white officers and politicians. BUT fairly also showed those that were for their successes also. Did not feel those that had to fight for everything they got had an attitude of entitlement.,1483401600,,431,4.684210526315789
767207,4,6304039255,This is a good movie but disappointing in some respects. The acting is good and the story is historic. However the directing is poor and the plot development shallow. The director had little interest in aviation accuracy so viewers with any aircraft or flying savvy Will have to just look beyond the truly stupid shots and enjoy the acting. It's definitely worth seeing just to know the story and I am glad I watched it.,1483401600,,420,4.613333333333333

Despite battling impossible bigotry from a country that did not love them, the Fighting Men of The 99th, goes on to save the war by escorting the bomber planes all the way to Berlin to deliver their payloads. Before the ""Red-tails,"" some of the bomber's escorts failed to show up for their mission of certain death. The AXIS powers were delivering massive blows to Allied bombers, blowing them out of the sky. Until then,""Black units"" were not allowed to fight in ""White Only"" wars.
The Tuskegee project had been under funded and under appreciated due to racism. However, intelligence prevailed and brand new air planes ""Mustangs"" were provided instead of the ""excess"" planes that were issued. The Red-tails re-defined ""air superiority."" By the time the Negros were allowed to fly, they were the best pilots the US Military had. These outstanding men never lost a single bomber.

769559,2,6304039255,"Not even close to the truth.
The  airmen never saw a Mustang until they were moved to bomber support in Italy late in the war.  They flew air to ground combat missions in other aircraft for a very long time.  They flew P40 and P47 aircraft which were relatively easy to fly and extremely difficult to shoot down. Same engines as the early Mustangs but much slower but known to take a severe beating and still stay up.
The laminar flow wings of the Mustang made the aircraft difficult to learn but a dream once in the air. The problem was learning how to fly a rocket that had to be aimed on takeoff and landings.  Otherwise in the cockpit the Mustang was designed by people who knew how to make a flying typewriter where you were able to go about killing without the problems of flying the plane.  A few of my friends flew Mustangs during WWII and were very happy with them.  The adversary was flying a flying gas tank of a Messerschmitt battle tested and refined ever since its use in the
Spanish Civil war in the 1930s.  Good engine in an extremely condensed airframe.  Check the schematics in Gunston's encyclopedia of combat aircraft of WWII for the entire stats of the 4 aircraft the Tuskegee airmen dealt with.  Production dates armament and all usage information including performance. Even the ME262's fell victim to the Mustangs.  If you are really interested in knowing who what when where how etc buy the Gunston's 1976 book on Amazon for under $6 used and new plus under $4 shipping.  This book will amaze you with details the media never knew.",1464307200,5,1556,4.521428571428571

769636,5,6304039255,"I loved this movie. The only fault I saw was in the factual telling when they show the American fighter planes turning and leaving a battle. The dialogue makes it seem like they are bugging out because they are cowardly, but the truth was that the fighters had a limited range and just as they were arriving over Germany, had to turn back to England. That's a very important fact because the way George Lucas has it now, it disparages hundreds of brave, young pilots who risked their lives to save us all from Hitler, my uncle being one of them.

The Red Tails, on the other hand, and no less brave, had the benefit of the newer planes with a longer range and that is why they were able to accompany the bombers to and from their targets.

Otherwise, I loved this movie. I thought the story was well told, the actors were great, and the special efforts were amazing. I highly recommend it.",1463529600,15,889,4.381818181818182

I've seen this movie countless times and enjoy it every time.  Most fascinating statistic is that this group of men never lost a bomber they were escorting to enemy fighters.  An amazing feat in those days.  Watch this movie and enjoy, then do some research on the Tuskegee Airmen and you will build an even greater respect for what they were and what they did.

One last thing,, there are only about 8 of these men alive today.  Remember and give great respect to the Greatest Generation ever,, They deserve it.",1458259200,,651,4.521367521367521

770300,5,6304039255,Loved it.  I was inspired to watch it because I recently met and had lunch with the widow of one of the Tuskegee Airmen.  I have not seen the new one by Speilburg yet.  I want to see it and compare with the stories she told me.  Her husband had to sit in back because they were not letting the  black men fly yet.  But the plane was starting to go down and he jumped up front and took over and landed the plane safely.  They put him in prison for 9 months but then they decided they needed the black pilots and let him out.  I liked the way they dealt  with the racism  struggle in this film as part of the heroism.

Listening to Rusty Burns who by the way is the youngest living Tuskegee Airman talk at Bob's party they went through hell and he said to those in attendance that they fought hard to get to be able to fight for our country, they were at the top of there game  but when they returned home NOTHING had changed prejudice was still all around.

771100,5,6304039255,"Ignorance and hate were at the core of World War II, and it is so sad that those things existed even among our own troops -- especially at a time when we all needed to stand as one. This was a brilliant movie that brought tears to my eyes, but also pride and thankfulness to my soul.  Not only am I thankful as an African American male, but thankful as a human being. I'm thankful to those men who endured and overcame all manner of disrespect, and yet they still put their lives on the line, and proved to those who doubted, that all men & woman were created equal, no matter their race or religious beliefs..  Men shouldn't have to beg for the right to fight and die for their country, and what they believe in. To the families of these Tuskegee Airmen, and to the families ( of all races ) of those who lobbied for the Tuskegee project, I give a heart felt thank you. It's only through knowledge, education and understanding, that we can live together as a people.  As we saw in this movie, even that young white bomber Captain learned that color doesn't define the content of a man's character.",1449964800,2,1098,4.320388349514563

771152,2,6304039255,"With regard to the historical accuracy of the film, it seems that it is based on true events according to some of the fact-checking I did. However, NONE of the characters were fully developed, showed any depth on-screen, or connected with the viewer. It had an unpolished feel. Some of the footage appeared to be actual which, whether real or not, added value in my opinion. I would have liked to have seen some interviews from some of the still-living airmen. Also, it's curious that Cuba Gooding, Jr. is in this film as well as ""Red Tails"". It was confusing, and initially I wondered if perhaps I'd seen this movie already but just didn't remember it?

771950,2,6304039255,"This most recent 2012 re-release on DVD of the 1995 HBO presentation is commendable in trying to tell the story of a period of racial separation in America's history where Blacks were denied many of the opportunities that whites took for granted in serving their country during the world's greatest conflict, WWII. Unfortunately, it seems to feel embellishing the truth with outright lies is the best way to do this.

Cuba Gooding and Larry Fishburne play pilots in this film, so neither are strangers to the ""implied"" history of the 332nd Fighter Group, nor the politically correct message of this or the Lucas produced version, ""Red Tails"" (2012); both of which grossly distort the truth to appease the black community, and do so at the expense of the real heroes of all the other Fighter Groups, who's performances far exceed that of the 332nd.

This film closes with full screen print declaring ""The 332nd Fighter Group never lost a single bomber to enemy action."" This ""myth"" is a lie; there were many bombers lost in combat and by flak when the 332nd was escorting them. Unfortunately, this deception has continued to be claimed to this day by some of the remaining Tuskegee pilots that still exist, as if they need to prove something at the air shows they appear at a few tents down from the likes of double-Ace Chuck Yeager; and triple-Ace, C.E. ""Bud"" Anderson, and many other ACES of WWII who still live, write factual books and give factual lectures all over America. The annual Oshkosh International Air Show is one example.

A key story line which is repeated in the 2012 Lucas production, ""Red Tails,"" is that the bomber pilots saw the departing fighters flying escort as abandoning them when German fighters appeared, implying they were either incompetent or cowardly for not staying with the bombers to defend them from the Luftwaffe. This is a lie. The FACT is, American fighters were specifically ordered in February of 1944 by Jimmy Doolittle, who'd just taken over command of the Eighth Air Force to ""pursue and destroy,"" because it was proven THAT was the only way to keep the German Fighters from attacking the Bombers.

Another distortion is that the 332nd Red Tails flew in formation escort WITH the Bombers, while other Fighter Groups wouldn't do this. This too is a lie. It was tactically too dangerous and never done, because P-51 Mustangs (and the P-47 Thunderbolts) couldn't slow themselves down to the paltry 180mph average speed the B-17s and B-24s usually flew at, without dropping flaps and making unsafe emergency maneuvers to evade or attack if the Fighters got ""bounced"" by Germans from above -- a common tactic both employed.

The best defensive tactics used by the fighter groups to protect the bombers was to fly 10,000 feet above and to the side, so they could bounce down on the Germans. The German pilots had their attack technique down to an art, called ""twelve o'clock high"" for a reason. This required a wide parallel flying turn into the bombers while flying outside of the bombers deadly .50 cal gun range so they could climb above them, get in front, then dive downward head-on blazing away. Once they completed this ""fly through"" attack at over 600mph closure to the bombers, usually taking out anything in the first row of ships with ease, they flew beneath, behind, around, then climbed and circled back in front of the bomber formation to do it all over again. So, the P-51s and P-47s were NEVER in formation with Bombers during such defense; and the Bomber pilots never expected it nor requested it, because it wasn't tactically feasible. Their most common ""lingering"" tactic was to fly zig-zag patterns crisscrossing several thousand feet over the Bombers, until breaking off when Bogies were spotted.

There's nothing wrong with telling a story of courage, struggle against prejudice and accomplishment against high odds; all of which is commendable. However, what is not commendable is the never ending distortion of truth so many white producers, actors and directors have signed on to for their own selfish, career advancing motivations to be politically correct in capturing the Black buck at the box office, or making sure they're not ostracized by producers who cater to this ""progressive"" and indifferent mindset of American history. Obviously, HBO, and writers Robert Williams and T.S. Cook all signed on to this politically correct propaganda film without any regards to insults they bestow in the real heroes of WWII that the Red Tail legacy tries to hijack.

The TRUTH is, of all the ""Fighter Groups"" (FG) of the Mediterranean and European theater during WWII, which each had THREE (3) Squadrons of Fighter aircraft, ONLY the 332nd was comprised of FOUR Squadrons, of 16 aircraft per squadron (plus a half dozen spares). Why does this matter? Because the 332nd was ONE THIRD larger in number of (black) pilots, compared to every other Fighter Group in the Air Force, by its having 64 to 70 aircraft. So the statistics by which ""performance"" is gauged is inflated by a 1/3 larger force. In spite of this politically correct omission to storytelling that is proffered at the beginning of each film as ""based on a true story"" -- the performance statistics of the 332nd is at the bottom of ALL the American Fighter Groups.

So here are some FACTS for anyone who's interested: The movie may state only 66 pilots were ""killed"" in the 332nd, but combat losses according to military records show 98. The 332nd Red Tails was ""on station"" (deployed for combat) for 23.3 months, and flew 1,578 missions, but only had 112 aerial kills. (No ""real"" pilot counts the ground kills, but those too were shallow.). The 332nd had a Kill to Loss ratio of 1.14. That means for every black pilot that was lost, they killed 1.14 Germans. Another statistic is kills per mission, which the 332nd had 0.07 (zero-point-zero-seven).

By comparison, one of the less notable, non-""TV"" or ""movie"" Fighter Groups, the 357th, with only the typical THREE (3) squadrons (48 aircraft, plus spares), was on station for ONLY 14.9 months; flew only 313 missions; yet it had 609 aerial kills (56 on just ONE DAY alone, which is exactly HALF the total kills the 332nd took TWO YEARS to achieve, and stands as a record that has never before or after been touched by any fighter group of any country). The 357th lost 128 aircraft, giving it a Kill to Loss ratio of 4.75; and kills per mission of 1.94, or 27.7 times higher than the 332nd.

One of the two companion fighter groups next door to the 332nd, literally, as part of the 15th Air Force in Italy, was the 31st Fighter Group; which was on station for 33.0 months and had 571 kills. The second companion Fighter Group of the 15th Air Force, also next door to the 332nd was the 325th. The 325th FG was on station for 24.7 months; shot down 529 enemy aircraft, and flew 550 missions, and suffered 176 losses, for a kill to loss ratio of 3.0.

What's important about the 31st FG and the 325th FG, is they were PART of the SAME mission assignments given out to the 332nd Red Tails, because they were all out of the same Mediterranean theater, and literally only a few miles apart. So anyone who wants to compare the 332nd as being segregated out and not seeing the same duty as the 31st and the 325th Fighter Groups, let alone their joint task force escorts with the Eighth and the Ninth Air Force into Germany, simply doesn't know anymore about history, than they know about the truth of the real Tuskegee ""experiment.""

One last point: The Eighth Air Force's 357th Fighter Group, with 3/4 of the men, fighting for 2/3 the time as the 332nd Red Tails, produced 42 ACES. The companion Fighter Group next door to the 332nd, the 325th -- produced 27 ACES; while the second companion group of the 15th Air Force next door to the 332nd Red Tails -- the 31st Fighter Group -- produced 33 ACES. (An Ace being FIVE kills.)

The 332nd Tuskegee Airmen Red Tails, with 33% more pilots and three times more missions, produced ""0"" ACES. (ZERO!)

The dialogue is totally PC with the typical contemporary spin, even in 1995, we've come to expect in placating the black community, none of which is historically correct. This film attempts to tell a more complete story of the Tuskegee origins and struggle than its 2012 Lucas successor, Red Tails, but it is still full of the same old racist burdened Blacks feeling sorry for themselves woven throughout the story line.

Markowitz, Price, and script writers Robert Williams and T.S. Cook, should each take a page from the history books of the Greatest Generation, which a small part of is represented by the 357th, 325th, 31st, mentioned above, as well as the 4th, the 55th, the 56th, the 78th, the 339th, the famed 352nd, the 353rd, the 355th, the 356th, the 359th, the 361st, the 364th, the 479th, and the 9th Air Force's 354th and a few others. NONE of the heroes in these Fighter Groups need to stand on a hill, or have Hollywood stand on its hill and yell how great they are, because they are not so insecure of their accomplishments they need to embellish their history with outright lies.

If you want to live in Fairy land and cheer for the downtrodden blacks of America, then this ""fictional"" film, just like ""Red Tails,"" is for you. But it certainly has no place in real history, anymore than it deserves a beginning subtitle proclaiming it is based on a true story; because aside from the name of the Fighter Group, and where it originated from, THIS FILM has very little to do with truth or the real results of the Tuskegee ""EXPERIMENT"" compared to the kind of performance the Fighter Groups above achieved; none of which needed a politically correct movie made about them to secure their place in history, and all of which are made of the character that ignores those who do.",1433203200,4,9796,4.743394010569583

I did find that there was some information that was changed and or left out.

They were all excellent pilots who really had a magnificent skill in flying.
Don't pay any attention to the aircraft they show them flying out of North Africa. Those were P-39s, P-40s or P-47s in real life. I believe they even flew B-25s, but I am not positive. They never used P-51s until Italy, which is accurately portrayed. I doubt if any P-39s, P-40s or P-47s are still around in the numbers we see with the P-51s. Those Mustangs were incredibly built and while the ones still flying have seen a lot of work to keep them flying, those airframes are a testament to the quality of the design and manufacturing. Incredible aircraft. The only other Allied fighter with those creds is the Spitfire.
In the film, the characters, such as Lt. Lee, were mostly an amalgam of several famous ""Red Tail"" pilots. It is unimportant to tell the story as it really happened since life on film is much more romantic and dramatic. Some of us may take offense at that, as life can sometimes be so much more than what any camera and actor can portray.
All in all, the film is a top piece which honors those remarkable men. It is well worth your time to view.",1431648000,4,1461,4.394833948339484

773076,2,6304039255,Pretty marginal movie overall.  Disappointing on a number of levels.  It's getting increasingly difficult to make WW2 flying movies given the rarity and value of surviving aircraft.  So its understandable the flying was consistently uninspired.  The tactics were often historically incorrect. Appears to have been produced to appeal to a demographic other than WW2 flying buffs.  It did cover a legitimate historical point....but its been done to death (repeatedly) using all sorts of vehicles.  Very quickly found myself loosing interest and thinking enough already.  Resisted the growing desire to turn the movie off hoping it would somehow get more interesting.  No luck. Boring and a disservice at this point.  Rated at 2 stars only because I love old planes and flying......A significant disappointment.,1419292800,,808,5.504065040650406

We watched less than 10 minutes and turned it off because the Amazon Instant Video quality was unwatchable on our HD LED TV. Tried Expendables 2, same story. Both were grainier than watching a 20 year old VHS tape on an ancient machine with dirty heads. Went to Netflix and enjoyed a beautiful picture. Not sure Prime is worth the money if the movies are unwatchable on a TV since I like a theater-like experience and don't see the point in watching movies on a phone or tablet.",1414800000,,629,4.478260869565218

Realistic and entertaining, normally I don't like movies about racism, but this one is more about American heroes that overcame racism and made not only their race proud but all Americans proud of them along with those they fought with. They also demonstrated that Hitler's racist ideas are false along with those of the founders of planned parenthood whose goals were to eliminate Blacks. Which they are still doing btw.

774658,1,6304039255,"The problem with a polemical movie like this is that there are at least two separate and distinct ways it can be judged. First of all it can be judged as an entertainment. Secondly it can be judged as a brief  for a political position.

Let me address the second point first. The Tuskegee Airman issue is a favorite topic of the left. It is not presented as objective history but rather as an argument for what liberals think is a moral point. According to this view, the fact that at one point some whites said blacks couldn't fly modern fighters and that later they were shown to be adequate pilots proves - well just what does it prove other than some people were wrong in their judgments.

None of the writings, or movies about the Tuskegee Airmen ever point out that the majority of white officers always believed that blacks had the capability to fly fighters. There was indeed a debate within the officer corps but those who believed that blacks were genetically and physiologically incapable of flight were the minority. So when the Tuskegee Airmen proved capable of flying P-51s some white officers were surprised but most weren't.

Blacks and whites are good at different  activities. Blacks are obviously much better than whites at basketball and running. This wasn't always evident. Adolf Hitler for one was surprised by Jesse Owens at the 1936 Olympics but few American track coaches expected anything else. Owens was on our team because he was known to be blindingly fast. Hollywood still makes movies about the time when many whites thought blacks couldn't play basketball or baseball.

The Tuskegee Airmen story is popular but it is also filled with lies and distortions. The real Tuskegee Airmen had the worst record of any air group escorting bombers over Germany in terms of their ability to shoot down Nazi fighters. All other comparable white units flying comparable planes were much more effective. There were no Tuskegee Airman who became 'Aces'.  That was unusual.

There was a major study at the end of the war that dealt with the black fighter pilots very low kill rate. However the real reason they were so different from white pilots was not so much racial as it was political. They flew different missions than whites - ones with less risk to them and less risk to the bombers. They also flew at a time when the major air action was over. The Nazi planes and pilots had been decimated. Almost all of their missions over Germany were unopposed. They rarely saw a Nazi fighter in the air.

The Tuskegee Airmen seem to have been single out for political cover. Like Prince Andrew it looks as if they were not exposed to the same risks as their colleagues because of political considerations.

So as objective history this movie and the similar George Lucas film 'red Tails' could hardly be less accurate. Both films are blatant propaganda  pieces which defame the white pilots so as to advance the case for this small group of black pilots. On the other hand as a simple distracting entertainment this is a competent Hollywood effort. The photography is good. The acting is good. This made for TV movie has to rely on a lot of stock footage for the battle scenes. It was made before the CGI revolution so all the original flying sequences use real planes. This is good and bad. Real planes look like real planes in a way that the CGI heavy Lucas 'Red Tails' planes don't. But there are only so many real planes left. So it soon becomes clear that the producers had access to three and only three P-51s. For anyone who appreciates WWII war birds that's a plus but it does  restrict the kind of scenes that can be depicted.",1388793600,15,3647,4.663551401869159

Chauncey Edward Spencer
(1906-2002)

One of three children of Edward Spencer and noted Harlem Renaissance poet Anne Spencer, Chauncey Spencer was born in Lynchburg, Virginia, in 1906. At the age of eleven, he fell in love with flying upon seeing his first plane over the skies of Lynchburg.

One of the most respected families in Lynchburg, visitors to the Spencer home included George Washington Carver, Paul Robeson, James Weldon Johnson, Walter White, Clarence Muse, Dean Pickens, Adam Clayton Powell, Langston Hughes, Thurgood Marshall, and W.E.B. Dubois.

After Spencer graduated from college, no aviation school in Virginia would admit him because of his color. One of these distinguished visitors, Oscar De Priest of Chicago, the first Black Congressman since Reconstruction, suggested that young Spencer move to Chicago and attend flying school.

Moving to Chicago in 1934, Spencer joined with a group of African American aviators in organizing the National Airmen Association of America (NAAA). Working as a $16-a-week kitchen helper in a Chicago restaurant Spencer paid $11 an hour for flying lessons and he indeed learned to fly. Later, he and a handful of companions bought the corpse of an obsolete airplane and found that by repairing its loose parts with bailing wire they could coax it into the air. With this accomplishment, they set out to stake a claim for ""brotherhood"" in the skies.

In May 1939, he and fellow aviator Dale Lawrence White, also an NAAA member, flew a rented Lincoln-Paige biplane--with only two flight instruments--on a ten-city tour that started in Chicago and ended in Washington, DC. Realizing that war in Europe was eminent, their aim was to demonstrate the aviation abilities of ""negroes"" and to lobby Congress for inclusion of people of color in the Civilian Pilot Training Program for the Army Air Corps.

Their flight drew national attention and proved that black pilots had the requisite intelligence, courage, and initiative to fly an airplane--contrary to the beliefs and opinions of most Army Air Corps and government leaders. While in Washington, DC, they met with Harry Truman and others in Congress, convincing them to support their cause.

Later, while employed by the Army, Spencer worked with Judge William H. Hastie to encourage fair treatment of African American air cadets being trained at Tuskegee Institute in Alabama and other air bases during World War II. He encountered considerable resistance from whites as well as blacks as the Civilian Personnel Employee Relations Officer at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio. Despite this, he persisted and made steady progress towards integration of the Air Force.

In 1948, Spencer received the Exceptional Civilian Service Award for service during World War II, the highest honor the Air Force could bestow upon a civilian. In 1953, the United States Air Force referred to his role in the integration of the military as ""unique - though strangely unsung."" However, his refusal to drag his feet on integration created resentment among highly-placed officials who wished to see integration fail.

Consequently, in September 1953 Spencer was charged with disloyalty and accused of being a Communist. He was relieved of his position and his family suffered great humiliation and economic deprivation until 29 June 1954, when the Air Force cleared him of all charges.

Spencer and his family would never fully recover from this ordeal. Despite ill-treatment, he continued to maintain his belief in the goodness and strength of mankind and America until his death on August 21, 2002.

(German POWs were served in Southern restaurants and movie theatres when black servicemen in uniform were banned). It's really an uplifting story of an heroic group, the black fighter pilots who persevered against every kind of racism, and proved themselves in war. Great acting.",1376092800,,458,5.12

The Tuskegee Airmen is a much better movie: it focuses on the story and the struggle.",1373760000,,365,4.304347826086956
774893,5,6304039255,The film production staff and actors alike did a marvelous job of depicting life as it was during that era.  The flight scenes and air battles were well choreographed keeping viewers glued to their seats.  My hates off to the real Tuskegee Airman and to the people involved in bringing this movie to life.

These guys truly saved a lot of bomber pilots and crews in the war and deserve a heck of a lot more credit from that dumb military establishment than they ever got during the war. Nice to see , they are getting some recognition and credit for the tough job they did, not just in the air, but dealing with the idiots in the service who were so discriminatory in their day,due to their color, is really really stupid.
This movie will show the evolution of this great bunch of flyers and demonstrates how tough it is to change anything in the military.",1369094400,,661,4.338709677419355

774899,5,6304039255,"I was in the military from 1964-68.  Segregation still existed, but was waning.  This movie takes place in WWII of the 40's.  I knew that racism in the military was bad, but never knew it was this bad.  Colored soldiers were not accepted in the military.
Tuskegee is in Alabama.  When the train carrying the Colored recruits went through Alabama, they had to give up their seats for white German prisoners of war.
These men were tested over and over, because it was believed that the test scores were too high.  ""A Colored did not have the mental capacity to do well on written tests"".  The military sought to 'washout' the recruits.  Those who survived the training were commissioned as officer pilots.  These officers were not saluted, but called 'boy'.
They were not permitted to engage in combat.  Southern senators tried to get them disbanded. The military kept them in Africa flying rear guard missions until Eleanor Roosevelt championed the establishment of an all Colored fighter squadron.  They finally served in Europe.
White bomber pilots did not want them protecting their flights.  They also called them 'boy'.
But the bomber flights protected by the Colored squadron never lost a plane.  Eventually, even the racist bomber pilots requested their protection.

These soldiers who were not accepted by the military and even their country, fought and die for that country.",1368576000,,1382,5.004385964912281

Tuskeegee Airmen was better because it was less ""Hollywood"". The focus was more about the acting, dramatic dialogue, and the antagonist/protagonist relationships between the black squadron members and it's white command superiors than it was about the special effects or the aerial flight/battle sequences.

775403,4,6304039255,"These guys were good; they had to be. From the time they took the written test to strapping into their trainer aircraft, their white instructors, especially those from the South, were just itching to bounce them out of pilot training. Their flying had to be exceptional and it was.

The 332nd Fighter Group made it to Italy and began flying reconnaissance missions and endless patrols with no hope of engaging the enemy. That was the next battle, fighting the reports that belied their meager combat missions. Their commander would go Washington to make their case that they hadn't been used for combat, that they were anxious to engage the enemy and that they were not innate cowards.

Under the watchful eye of Southern politicians eager to see them fail and have their unit disband, they began to escort bombers to their targets, and they lost the fewest bombers to enemy fighter attack. As a subplot, we see two bomber pilots arguing about the group that came to their rescue. The Californian pilot believes the group are Negroes, and the Southern pilot, exasperated, tries to explain to him that they can't be because don't have the courage or will to fight. That changes when badly hit by an enemy aircraft, a Negro pilot begins singing the squadron's fight song over the radio. The bomber pilots listen as the pilot crashes into the ground. The bomber pilot from the south eventually asks the 332nd to escort his planes on their bomb runs. He is compelled to dispel a life-long belief.

Thank heaven no one challenges black acting talent, and this movie is full of the same, proving that a TV movie can be just as entertaining as the ones found in theaters. Lawrence Fishburne, Cuba Gooding Jr., and Andre Braugher lead the cast of characters, with John Lithgow and Christopher McDonald playing a southern U.S. Senator and white officer respectively, characters you learn to love to hate.

The story and script explore the tension between black cadets and white officers, the conflict of wanting to fight for a country and cause that doesn't respect them or want them, and continuing to do it anyway. They not only fought the Germans, but their own services. This story only scratches the surface of their daily stress, the fear of dying and the fear of failing, or being perceived as failures. It makes their story personal. There were no TV cameras to extoll their challenges and success. There was Eleanor Roosevelt who visited the training and insisted on being taken for a flight--by a black cadet, but that was about all the support they would receive, and the equanimity of some officers who believed they deserved a chance just as anyone else.

The Red-Tail Devils, as they were called, did a service to our country while their country did a disservice to them.",1341100800,,2776,4.799163179916318

In fact, in comparison to George Lucas', current film release, 'Red Tails', this TV production tells this story best. Yes, Lucas' film depicted the large scale of air combat scenes better, mostly because of special effects. I'll admit that 'The Tuskegee Airmen', apparently, used very few aircraft in their production and did not portray a convincing grand scale of bomber and pursuit aircraft in flight.

775641,4,6304039255,"This film does a reasonably good job of telling the story of the Tuskegee Airmen and the 332nd Fighter Group in a way that is both entertaining and informative at the same time.  However, it does suffer from one major flaw.  That is perpetuating the myth that the 332nd Fighter Group never lost a bomber they were escorting to German fighters.  The fact is that 25 bombers were shot down by German fighters while being escorted by the Red Tails.  This was discovered by the Tuskegee Airmen, Inc.'s own historian, William Holden in 2006.  Like all myths, this one has it's basis in truth, namely, a June 21, 1945 War Department press release which stated that as of February of that year the 332nd had flown 200 combat missions with the 15th Air Force and and served as escort to heavy bombers without loosing a single bomber to enemy fighters (*during* that period).  This would later be unintentionally misquoted and thus the myth was born.

The fact that the 332nd FG did, in fact, lose bombers to German fighters in no way takes away from the heroism of the pilots of the 332nd or from their contribution to the victory over Nazi Germany.  In fact, to embellish the record of the 332nd FS in this way (purely by accident) is really a dis-service to the pilots and ground crews of the 332nd FG.  The role the men of the 332nd FG played helped to de-segregate the armed services after WWII and contributed to the civil rights movement of the 1960s therefore is of far greater importance than whether or not they were able to prevent the loss of any bombers to German fighters.  Limiting those losses to only 25 was an outstanding accomplishment that the pilots of any fighter group in Europe would, and should, be dammed proud of.  That the Tuskegee Airmen, in doing so, were able to return as many sons, brothers, and fathers that made up the crews of the bombers to get home in one piece to their families, as the trailer of the film talks about, is a testament to the heroism and skills of the pilots of the 332nd Fighter Group (and that of the ground crews that kept them flying)!

775796,5,6304039255,"This film depicts a mostly forgotten part of American history.  Following the cadets from wannabe Army-Air Corps pilots through training (and some failures) through to their unmatched conduct in WW II is must viewing for all Americans.  The racism is a lesson for all, both in the stupidity of its existence (Negroes aren't smart enough or talented enough to fly complex airplanes) to what can be productively accomplished when it is not used as an excuse for quitting.  The famous ""Red Tails"" never lost a B-17 to enemy fighters and they were not a welcome sight to Luftwaffe pilots.  More persistent than their white counterparts, the B-17 crews came to ask for their unit specifically to fly escort.
The film captures all of this.  Andre Braugher is outstanding as Benjamin O. Davis.  Courtney B. Vance is excellent as the liaison Lt. Glenn.  Laurence Fishburne's composite character (including that of of the person Charles Alfred Anderson) is superb.

775798,5,6304039255,"THE TUSKEGEE AIRMEN, stars Laurence Fishburne, known for playing an aggressive character (Ike Turner) in WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT, and a gentle, reclusive professor in AKEELAH AND THE BEE. This film also stars the equally versatile Cuba Gooding, who happens to be a household word in America.

THE FILM IS BASED ON THESE EVENTS. The Tuskegee program began with the formation of the 99th Fighter Squadron at the Tuskegee Institute. After basic training the airmen were placed under the command of Captain Benjamin O. Davis, Jr., then one of the few black graduates of West Point, then was transported to Casablanca, Morocco, on the USS Mariposa and to participate in the North African campaign. From Morocco they traveled by train to Oujda then to Tunis, the location from which they operated against the Luftwaffe. Flyers and ground crew alike largely were isolated by the racial segregation practices of their initial command, Colonel William W. Momyer. The Tuskegee Airmen were credited with 112 Luftwaffe aircraft shot down, the German-operated Italian destroyer TA-23 sunk by machine-gun fire, and destruction of numerous fuel dumps, trucks, and trains. The Tuskegee airmen flew more than 15,000 sorties on 1,500 missions. On a mission flown March 24, 1945, they escorting B-17s to bomb the Daimler-Benz tank factory at Berlin, Germany. During the action its pilots were credited with destroying three Me-262 jets of the Luftwaffe's all-jet Jagdgeschwader 7 in aerial combat that day.

STORYLINE OF THE FILM. The film begins with several young African-Americans who meet on a train on their way to aviator school. They encounter a dose of reality during the trip, when they are required to move to a special blacks-only car on the train, to make room for white people (the white people are German prisoners of war). They encounter more doses of reality on the military base, where one of the officers, Major Joy, refers to them with the ""n word,"" and sees it as his personal mission to sink the entire Tuskegee training program. At any rate, Major Joy does not succeed, and the Tuskegee airmen travel to north Africa, where they see huge quantities of combat action. Laurence Fishburne survives, but Cuba Gooding crashes during a mission.

The film is characterized by its occasional stylized dialogue and by its didactic script. Overall, the film is geared to people of the ages ten and up. The entire script seems to be about 25 pages long, as there are no lengthy dialogues. The violence is kept to a minimum. There is a minimum of bad words. This would make an excellent teaching device for a civics class, for middle school students.

THEATRICALLY STYLIZED and DIDACTIC SCENES. The recruits spontaneously derive nicknames from the men's background, and spontaneously begin using these nicknames. Mr. Fishburne is called ""Iowa"" because his character is from Iowa. Cuba Gooding exclaims, ""Hey Iowa, are you ready for all this?"" Other nicknames are ""Stick"" and ""Train."" The theaterical technique of conferring a nickname that corresponds to a character's origin, was also used in the film, HOLLYWOOD CANTEEN.  Six minutes into HOLLYWOOD CANTEEN, a soldier is called by the nickname, ""BROOKLYN.""  In a scene typical of countless sports movies, Cadet Leroy expresses self-doubt about finishing training, in view of the fact that 1/3rd of the men had already dropped out. But Mr. Fishburne give him a pep-talk. At first, Leroy expresses self-doubt saying, ""I don't know."" Then, Mr. Fishburne give him more pep-talking, and Leroy half-heartedly answers, ""Yeah, I'm going to make it."" Finally, after more pep-talking, Leroy exclaims affirmatively, ""I'm going to make it."" Another didactic theme, found in this movie, and in other movies such as BILLY BUDD by Herman Melville, OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN with Richard Gere, and A SOLDIER'S STORY starring Adolph Caesar, is humiliation and abuse from the officers directed to new recruits. Thus, if you don't mind that your movie entertainment is sometimes preachy, corny, or didactic, then you won't mind these excesses in THE TUSKEGEE AIRMEN.

QUOTABLE QUOTES. The film contains a number of quotable quotes:

(1) For example, after a crash kills one of the cadets, the liaison officer tells the other cadets, ""If you don't believe in God, you'd better find a damned good substitute.""

(2) In a confrontation between Major Joy, who wants to see the Tuskegee program eliminated, we find this exchange. The Major exclaims, ""There's a war on,"" meaning that America should not be tinkering around with an experimental program to train black fliers. The Colonel replies to this with, ""And I'd prefer that war not be on this base,"" meaning that it is not the Major's business to dictate military policy to the Colonel.

(3) Another great line is delivered by an older member of a chain gang, cutting tall weeds in a field by a country road, under the supervision of redneck guards with toting rifles. Two of the cadets, Cappy and Hannibal, experience engine trouble and they land on a country road by the chain gang. ""Just a little engine trouble,"" explains Hannibal (Mr. Fishburne) as he climbs out of his plane, and pulls off his goggles. Of course, this surprises the rednecks as well as the members of the chain gang. An older member of the chain gang smiles broadly, and quietly utters, ""They're colored fliers."" This low-key scene is likely to instill more pride in the viewing audience than a dozen touchdowns at the Superbowl. To repeat, the great line is: ""They're colored fliers.""

The timing and development that went into this script is not something that can be easily be taught, or automatically learned, in film school.  I might even be willing to characterize the script-writer as a genius.  The ingenious sense of time and development, in the script, is especially evident in the scene when the 2 fliers land on a country road near a chain gang, and in the scene in the tent when the redneck bomber captain specifically requests the colored squadron.

RED TAILS.  Okay, now it is May 9, 2014, and yesterday, I watched RED TAILS.  RED TAILS and THE TUSKEGEE AIRMEN are easily distinguished, as follows: (1) RT is nearly all about combat missions, with nothing about recruitment or training of the pilots.  TTA spends about three quarters of its time on recruitment, training, and politics in the U.S. government, with about one quarter on combat; (2) RT contains plenty of phony-looking CG.  If TTA does have CG, it is not as blatantly obvious as the phony-looking CG that is found in RT; (3) RT has little in the way of character development, aside from the pilot's relationship with the Italian girl.  In contrast, TTA has a huge amount of character development, and almost every person with a speaking line has a well-developed character.  In particular, Mr. Lithgow plays a character who you will love to hate; (4) RT has watered-down representations of racism.  In contrast, TTA has plenty of overt, in-your-face representations of racism (just as overt as in the movie called ""42"").  By its intense depiction of racism, TTA is so much the more successful in depiction overcoming racism; (5)  RT will provide an amusing two hours, without a boring moment, and once you watch it, there won't be much reason to watch it again.  In contrast, TTA will live with you forever, and you will want to watch it repeatedly, perhaps once a year.",1275350400,2,7399,4.977309562398704

I am proud of these brave men and I am sorry they never really received all that was due them as heroes. The foibles that these men exhibited only showed that they are quite human, and certainly no white person could deny similar traits. The story moves quite well in every aspect.

775899,4,6304039255,"Historically accurate? Pretty close. The Tuskegee Airmen is a 1995 film based on a World War II fighter squadron called the Tuskegee Airmen. This fighter squadron was the first all black fighter squadron in the U.S. Air Force. It was first activated on March 19, 1941 in Rantoul, Illinois and was called the 99th Pursuit (later, Fighter) Squadron. Later, it moved to the Tuskegee Institute in Alabama. The 99th began missions in North Africa, mainly doing ground attack missions. It later joined the 332nd Fighter Group with three other all black fighter squadrons. Since they joined the 332nd, their missions changed to bomber escort. Much of the film was based on this information.

Most of the events and people in the film were based on their historic counterpart. Almost all of the characters are fictional, but are based on real people. Only two people were real, them being Benjamin O. Davis, Jr. (Andre Braugher) and Eleanor Roosevelt. The other main characters, such as Hannibal Lee (Laurence Fishburne), were representations of real Tuskegee Airmen and the events that they went through. An example of this representation is when Hannibal takes Mrs. Roosevelt up in his training airplane; this is based on Charles Alfred Anderson taking the real Eleanor Roosevelt in his training airplane. Despite this accuracy, some details were left out. An example is the fact that Benjamin O. Davis, Jr. was the real commander of the 99th, although this is not pointed out until the North Africa campaign. He was actually placed in command of the 99th since its activation. Another element of the film's historic accuracy was its use of WWII footage. A great deal of the fighter scenes made use of WWII footage. It gives the film a bit of authenticity. The film also films along side the fighters, giving a person the feeling of flying with the fighters, while looking out the cockpit.

In addition to this feeling of authenticity the film also shows how bad the racism was for blacks at the time. Racism did play a part in the making the 99th fight in WWII. An example was a committee that was considering whether the ""experiment"" was worth the go ahead. Some committee members did submit a scientific paper that said that black people do not have the intelligence to operate complex machinery, but the majority of the committee voted in favor of the Airmen. What added to the effects of racism was the acting. An example is when three of the main characters were forced to move to the back of the train in order to make room for German POWs. The characters showed great surprise and anger, but kept that to themselves like many blacks probably did at the time. All of the actors had also clearly displayed the pride and determination that many of the Airmen had. An example is when Leroy Cappy (Malcolm-Jamal Warner) was about to give up trying to graduate from the Air Force academy, but Lee, Walter Peoples (Allen Payne), and Billy Roberts (Cuba Gooding Jr.) put pride back into Cappy by questioning him if he was going to give up as if they were Cappy's commanding officers. After this, Lee, Cappy, Roberts, and others graduated from the academy despite growing pressure from racism.

Despite little details missing or slightly altered, this film is a tightly wrapped package. It represented what really happened with the 99th with few elements and details changed. It used real footage from WWII, along with footage from its own production. It used racism to show how the airmen were treated, despite the fact that they were going out to fight a war for a country that discriminates against them. This film strived for historical accuracy.",1212278400,,3643,4.853697749196141

775953,4,6304039255,"Americans have paid a high price for their treatment of Blacks through the last century and a half. What has been lost in the worlds of business, the arts, medicine and science, can only be guessed at. Tuskegee Airmen gives some real, although narrow, insight into what was lost in WWII by a nation which continued to treat Blacks as an inferior people. Sadly, it wasn't just Americans who paid this price; the whole free world lost much because brave, highly skilled men were relegated to the backwaters of the war and not allowed to use their skills in the defense of freedom.

This movie is well acted. It makes no extravagant claims, speaks not in a loud demanding tone of voice and is all the more compelling because it simply lets the story tell itself.

The Tuskegee Airmen is a true story about real men who were ready and willing to help the fight against Germany and Japan, only to be rebuffed time and again, ignored by the buffoons sitting in the US Senate and Congress and at the top of the armed services.

That this band of pilots finally got into some form of combat is a testimony to their dedication and determination. This is a feel good/feel bad movie. I felt tremendous admiration at the courage and resilience these men showed, at the same time I felt a sense of despair in wondering how long the world will continue to waste talent and ability simply because of the color of someone's skin.

It's clear to anyone who studies history that the valiant contribution of these brave men could have literally spelled the difference between victory and defeat.

776020,5,6304039255,"During World War II an ""experimental"" program was attempted at the Tuskegee (Alabama) Air Force Base that would have much greater implications for the years to come.

Call it a ""Manhattan Project"" for the minds of military and political leaders; it was to train and use a black air squadron in the war. And the rich history of fighting for democracy in war while battling racism is brought to life in this outstanding DVD based on the triumphs & travails of the airmen.

An all-star cast - including Laurence Fishburne, Cuba Gooding Jr., Malcolm Jamal Warner, Vivica A. Fox and John Lithgow - follows the airmen through their training to the skies over Africa and Italy, with the focus on the lives of each major character.

The DVD does an excellent job in juxtaposing the patriotism of the flyers with the Jim Crow laws on the homefront and in the military. In one powerful scene, German POW's are given better accomodations on a train transport than the airmen.

The flyers proved to be one of the most efficient and valuable squadrons in the war. The squadron actually had a low casualty rate while suffering no losses of bombers being escorted. The squadron also tallied a high kill rate of enemy aircraft when engaged in combat.

Not only heroes in war, the squadron was an important factor in setting the stage several years later for the military to be desegregated by law by President Harry Truman.

This documentary is a legacy to the men who fought two wars in WWII, the enemy abroad and racism at home.  This documentary (along with others) is an important part to complementing the standard history books on American WWII era.

The Army had allowed the negros to try out for this flight program, only to see if the negro man was capable, mentally and physically, to make it thru pilot training.  These were the elite of the African American community of those days, college educated negros.  Negro is the term used during that era, and used in this review, only for historical purposes.

Starts off with the remaining living veterans aboard a bus going back to Tuskegee, Alabama - a veterans reunion.  With scenes overlapping with recreated footage, one learns from the veterans what it was like to be a negro in pre-WWII America (""the white press did not publish anything favorable of the negros.  The negros got their news and understood white America thru the black press"").  The Intro. also mentions Bessy Coleman, as the first woman black pilot.

The vision the young educated negro cadets, to change their society thru their joined efforts to fight for their country and prove to white America that the negro man can fly and do a great job at that, is quite contagious.  I could not, as a white Protestant, but just root for them and be glad that they proved their 1940 society, wrong.

It is so weird and ironic to learn, that today Tuskegee is a known town in Alabama, primarily because of the Tuskegee Airmen and the black Institute campus.

If you want to learn the real story, accurately, watch the PBS DVD (it is really well made).  If you just want to watch a great film about a great story and with a plot that conveys the segregation and racism of the times (but without all the details being historically accurate), then watch the film by Laurence Fishburne.  The PBS edition, also talks about what happened to the airmen after WWII, and one of the things mentioned is Truman's the bill for desegregation of the army.

The Tuskegee pilots of the 232 became known as the best in the business.  Also, as ""the Red Tails.""

The message of this documentary is simply: ""It's their country, too!""",1170806400,12,2622,4.624728850325379
776024,4,6304039255,"The Tuskegee Airmen (Laurence Fishburne) 106 minutes. (for a more historical account check out the PBS with the same title)

Movie starts out with the scene of a black kid on a farm watching a plane fly by.  The narrator reads ""We all have dreams, regardless of skin color."" The Little kid screaming ""Wait for me""

The director uses various scenes to show the ugly face of racism: The scene where the black cadets have to get off the train-car, then camera focuses on ""whites only"" sign for drinking fountain, and then the camera focuses on german prisoners getting off a bus, escorted by american white military soldiers.  Quite a lot of symbolism for racism in one little scene.  The black cadets are forced to give up their seats for german prisenoners of war (they had to go to the ""Jim Crow car"").  The introductary talk of the white commanding officer of the base to the newly arrived negro corp, was simply despicably racist, not just the expected putdown from commanding officer, but pure and un-adulterated hate.

The second shock, and this is to my own assumptions ... I was shocked when the negro cadets informally introduce each other and how cerebral some of them were (aeronautical engineer, pre-med, english literature, political science, art history, sociology, economics majors).  These were some bright minds there on base to prove America that they could make it.

Another excellent example of contradictory racism, is when a negro pilot does an emergency landing, and the white sherrif watching over a group of negro convicts, a chaingang, says ""It's one of our boys"" and later learns the opposite.

I love it when the good wins while fighting the evil - the white  major who gets in trouble with his commander for implementing his racist ideas.

If you want to comprehend the little nuances of racism and its evil, then this is a good movie to see.  If you want to understand discrimination and racism in 1940s US (not Canada) while we Americans were fighting Nazis in Europe, as experienced on an airforce base, then this is a good movie to see.  Not the whole presentation is profound, but there are moments of laughter, smiles, and chuckles.

In this movie only the ones ""who want to learn how to fly"" succeed above the rest - those who react instead of subversively ignore the racism around them .  And the remaining negro cadets surely proved to be some pretty darn good pilots and US Airmen.  It's an awefully great moment when racism is fought subversively and peacefully.  And there are plenty of these moments in this movie.

Or the moment, when the Bomber white pilot locates the fighter pilots who saved his crews lives, but is actually upset when he finds out they are colored.

The movie has a beautiful turn, and ending.  I will not spoil the details, just re-print the message of the last screen:

They achieved this with humility, skill and professionalism without letting their colour getting in the way. Yet it took years for their achievement to be recognised. I wanted to know more about this squadron so I searched the net for the real Tuskegee Airmen and it's a pity the rest of the real story could not have been told.

The problem with this film is that it is grindingly slow to get moving, with a few moments that are spectacular and memorable, and this makes it predictable.  Yes, they prove themselves.  Is that giving away anything?  Perhaps I shd not have watched this so soon after Glory, which is an absolutely first rate film.

The actors are very very good, starting with Fishburn, the star.  But there are also those that failed at their task - died in accidents or by their own hand - as well as those who died in combat.  These are genuine talents, and worth the ride just for them.

The story, of course, is worth learning in all its detail, so I am glad to own this film and will definitely share it with my kids when they are ready.  As an historcal film, it is quite good.  It is just that the script does not do these guys justice, and the direction is lacking in energy.  As such, it comes off as a formula drama.

776081,5,6304039255,"I won't knock a movie too hard if the story's good, but has a small budget.  Because I have a thing for World War II movies (and for aviation movies), I really found this movie very enthralling.

I don't like the back of the DVD box that says how it's ""1943, and the Germans are winning the war.""  In early '43, Von Paulus had surrendered in Stalingrad (which is generally seen as a huge turning point in the war).  By late 1942, the Germans had already been losing in Stalingrad.  But anyways...

This movie's great.  I like how these men have to fight not only the Nazis, but racism in their own country as well.  The best part is when the First Lady decides to fly with one of the ""colored"" pilots (and you can see how angry the commanding officer is).

The weakest part of this movie is the budget.  Whenever aerial combat occurs (or even ground attack from the air), the movie uses stock footage from World War II.  If I wanted to see footage that old, I'd watch a documentary (and yes, I do watch documentaries).  But the advantage of watching a movie is that you can RECREATE these re-enactments in a more flashy way.

But all minor weaknesses aside, this movie's awesome.  And the cast is awesome too featuring Cuba Gooding Jr and Lawrence Fishburne.  It also has that guy from the Cosby Show.  Suffice it to say, the acting is great.

It's a really touching movie because it shows the plight of these men as they risk their lives for a country that gives more rights to Nazi prisoners-of-war than to their own people (who happened to be non-White).

776083,5,6304039255,"This is an excellent story of real people. It is not PC BS where all whites are bad and all blacks are good. Instead, it is about a great and valiant group of men, the first black combat pilots during World War II. They are depicted as the heroes they were, not as supermen. They faced all of the challenges thrown at them to become pilots and they faced more challenges from their race. Some were primadonnas and some were modest. Some failed and some succeeded. Some were serious and some were jocular. Their humanity made them heroes even when others didn't want to admit their worth. They were regular guys called upon to do a difficult job and they did so with aplomb and dignity. They also did so magnificently.

The story takes a group of the airmen from their pilot training in Alabama through the North African campaign where they were relegated to important but unglamorous work against ground targets. We see them mature into professionals and develop their skills, all while being denied an opportunity to prove those skills. Finally, they are moved to Europe where they face more discrimination. Even though they do a great job, no one wants to admit that they have done so. Even redneck bomber crews who have their bacon saved are reluctant to give thanks when they learn they have been saved by black men. Still, the men of the 332nd persevere.

Finally, comes the push to Berlin. The bomber crews know its going to be tough. For me, the climax comes when one of the rednecks tells his CO, ""If its all the same to you, I'd like the 332nd to take me to Berlin"". This is the same guy who would not even acknowledge they could fly earlier. While flying bomber escort, the 332nd never lost a single bomber to enemy fire. They were magnificent.

That is the story and it is no secret. I'm not giving away anything not already in the history books. What makes this film so much more than docu-drama are the characterizations of the men who lived the story. They are real American heroes and they are played with greatness. They fought the Germans and they fought their own chain of command and they prevailed.

This is a well done documentary that presents the story of the Tuskegee Airmen. Topics examined include the prewar state of affairs of black servicemen, their training in Tuskegee, Alabama, their air campaigns in North Africa and Europe and their less than triumphant return home after the war. At each step of the way, they had to fight individual and institutional racism and they did so in the best possible manner. They fought bigotry with sheer excellence. They remain the only fighter group never to have lost one of the bombers they were charged with protecting to enemy fire.

Participating in this documentary are some of the original airmen and their poignant recolections and anecdotes bring a very human face to go with their legendary exploits. These people include both pilots and the aircrews who kept them in the air. Ossie Davis provides narration and does a commendable job.

It seemed to me that the saga of these marvelous aviator warriors--treated as they were as second-class citizens by their own government--is one which deserved to be a silver-screen triumph. Our four-engine bombers were being punched out of the sky by the Luftwaffe, but NEVER when the Tuskegee pilots graced their wingtips. Their combat record was nothing short of amazing. The movie was well done, with great story, great actors, great acting. Still, I came away wishing that it might have been better in one respect: During the aerial combat segments, you hear the pilots bantering back and forth loudly over the radios using these rediculous phrases: ""Take that, Gerry!"" ""That's for yo mamma, Gerry!"" This was such a great movie; why did they have to dip into corny dialogue during the dog-fighting? It was a flawless procduction till it went hackneyed in those moments.

If ever a film deserve a 5-Star rating, this one does.",942796800,104,1182,5.136842105263158
776162,5,6304039255,"This is an inspiring movie about how African-American pilots overcame great odds on and off the battlefield.  I have seen many war movies and this is one of the best, especially since it is based on a true story.  Until I saw this movie, I wasn't aware of the great achievements of these  pilots during WWII.  This movie is definitely a testimony to the fact that  courage is not dependent upon a person's color.",940464000,2,412,4.513513513513513

7859635,5,6304039255,"Well told, I cried, I smiled, I am proud of those brave young men who endured more than they should have and overcame huge hurdles.  Sadly they were recognized too late in the game.  I only learned of their red tails recently and it was wonderful to see it in this movie. This should be used as a motivational movie for those who have no sense of pride and/or what it is to overcome hurdles and/or have a sense of accomplishment.  There should be more movies like this one!  There should be more movies about these stand-up men.",1525392000,,528,4.357142857142857

7859641,2,6304039255,"Waaaaay too much ""white"" saviorism for me. Hollywood has a very bad habit of doing this. In order to ""balance out"" blatant and very real racism against ""Black"" people in many films, they inject ""good, non-racist"" so-called whites to soothe the conscious of the (often times) majority ""white"" viewing audience: ""See, not all whites are bad and hate Black people!"" This movie went way overboard with it. The film would have been much better without it.",1522368000,,450,4.934210526315789
