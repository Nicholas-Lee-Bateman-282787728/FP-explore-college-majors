2072991,4,B0002A2VUK,"nick and jessica are a beautiful couple... now with their recent tabloids about them on the verge to splitting is non-sense... they are a power couple...

this varitey hour was sooo friggin funny.  jessica is a decent actress.

the funniest scene was when jessica was trying to be in the MICKEY MOUSE CLUB and they had the younger britney, christina and justin in it trying to get crunk with the gal...OHHH and the pole vaulting.... jessica you know that was wrong but that was another funny moment....

they had a bunch of singing scenes including the jewel and jessica duet 'who will save your soul', nick and babyface and the at the time hit 'take my breathe away'...

nick is a funny cat he knows how to keep his gal in the spotlight. he does not try to hog it because he knows that the people really want to see jessica... so i commend him for that.

in other words this is funny and i really hope they do another one real soon... ohh they did the christmas one.... but do another one soon...",1106784000,5,997,4.391304347826087
2072992,2,B0002A2VUK,"Nick Lachey and Jessica Simpson have a few good moments in the Nick and Jessica Variety Hour. But the show looks too '70s in its premise, too Donny and Marie-ish in some parts and Sonny and Cher-in some others.  Lachey's performance with Babyface is nice. How come Babyface didn't produce Nick's entire solo album instead of the batch of people Nick went to that caused Soul-O to flop?  He would have given him some smooth stuff to sing to. But having Mr. T and Johnny Bench and Kenny Rogers makes the show look, sadly, too 1983-ish. How come they couldn't get somebody current to perform on it, say Maroon 5 or Kanye West, who were both hot last April? They wanted to bring back the variety show format, but it's very hard to do it in an Internet age.  And Jessica isn't all that good on this show. I'd rather hear her music and albums instead. They need to bring new things to the format if they're going to make another show. For now, Lachey and Simpson would be better off doing their solo albums than wasteful junk like this!",1105574400,7,1030,4.410526315789474
2072993,5,B0002A2VUK,"I love these DVD's. I am a huge Jessica Simpson fan, and have been before Newleyweds came out. This is a must have for any fan. The Variety Hour is funny, witty, and baiscally a huge laugh. I can't wait for the Christmas Variety hour to come out!",1104710400,3,246,4.145833333333333
2072994,4,B0002A2VUK,I thought the variety hour was cute! Nick & Jessica both did a great job at acting together! I loved it but I'm not sure if everyone will cause I didn't laugh at every single joke cause some were just corny... So I give it four stars instead of five. But other than that I thought the show and singing it's self was cute!,1102982400,3,321,4.03125
2072995,2,B0002A2VUK,"Whilst I do like Jessica and Nick, (I was a fan of Jessica since ""I'm gonna love you forever"" and I always liked 98degrees), this is embarrasing.

On Newlyweds, I think she's actually funny.  I love the show and I don't see the negatives that people talk about.  This however was different.  I can't beleive they need the money, so Jessica and Nick - DON""T DO THIS AGAIN.  I couldn't believe they did such stupid rubbish and kept a straight face.  It's fine to do songs along with other famous singers, but don't sing with a car, and don't do pole-vaulting across the stage and then act high at other times.

Yes there are some good moments in this, but overall,?  I was cringing considerably.",1097625600,13,693,4.488
2072996,5,B0002A2VUK,"This has been arguably the most enjoyable import i have got this year.

Over here in Australia we have just barely started seeing the 2nd series of NewlyWeds on free-to-air tv here, so naturally i snapped up this 'smile time' variey hour excitedly.

But what shocked me was that it was really funny.

A prime example was when Nick decided to introduce his favourite Baseball playing friend.

'Oh Dear' I thought aloud.

But luckily it turned to a classic case of audience abuse, and everyone can enjoy that.

Jessica working at an 'ole style Saloon with the power to read dirty thoughts which results in Nick all wet...

10 Seconds Of Awkwardness with Mr T was another example of irreverence that i enjoyed....

But what topped it off was the music. The songs were delightful.

Oh, and Jess Pole Vaulting...

So if you haven't seen it, or heard of it (Australian people)

buy it now and laugh.",1093910400,10,893,4.624203821656051

8024954,1,B0002A2VUK,"It was dumb. It was not what I thought it would be. No acting skills on Jessica's part. It was all about Jessica not too much of Nick. Whoever wrote the script, didn't do a good job.",1225152000,2,182,3.945945945945946
8024955,4,B0002A2VUK,"If you are a fan of
Nick and Jessica or of the variety show of the 70's you'll love this
pretty chessy but fun, muppets, KITT from nightrider and so much more
very silly but very fun",1216080000,2,182,3.945945945945946
8024956,2,B0002A2VUK,What a waste of money.  Waste of space. Waste of time.  I'm a fan of both Nick and Jess but you'd be ashamed to own this. Not worth a dime.,1134172800,6,139,3.6
8024957,3,B0002A2VUK,"Ok now don't get me wrong, some things in the variety hour were really funny, but then again there were alot of things in there that are sooo LAME!! In my opinion they are trying to be Sonny and Cher and EVERYBODY knows that Sonny and Cher are the absolute BEST and nobody will ever compare to them! Nick and Jessica can try but...sorry guys it will never happen! Comedy hours are great when Sonny and Cher do it but Nick and Jessica just make it look bad so Nick and Jess PLEASE im begging you PLEASE stick to singing!",1123632000,3,519,4.2
