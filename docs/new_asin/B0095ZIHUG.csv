4 stars for the movie
2 stars for the quality of the DVD

I saw Killer Force in the theatre when it was released.  It was one of my favorite films of the 70s - still is.  Besides, how can you go wrong with a movie featuring Peter Fonda, Telly Savalas, Christopher Lee, O.J. Simpson and the lovely Maud Adams?  It's well paced, there is plenty of action and takes place at a diamond mine facility.  The music composed by Georges Garvarentz fits very well and is thoroughly enjoyable.

I videotaped this movie when it aired on WTBS in the 1980s and I dare say the picture quality of this DVD is barely any better.  Literally, it looks like it was dubbed from a 2nd generation VHS copy.  Very disappointed, but glad I only spent $5 for both movies as that what this DVD is worth.  I have not yet watched Breaker!

The best version of Breaker! Breaker! I have seen. A great wide-screen transfer starring Chuck Norris of course, ably supported by George Murdock.
Killer Force (1975), a fairly good full screen transfer starring Peter Fonda, Maud Adams, Hugh O'Brian, O.J. Simpson, Christopher Lee and Telly Savalas. I have a Beta factory print of this one and the DVD print looks about the same. An entertaining film, full of action and familiar faces lead by a bearded Peter Fonda.",1374624000,3,527,5.0
