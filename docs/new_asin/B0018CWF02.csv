3415167,5,B0018CWF02,"I love both Christina Applegate and Jean Smart. I was so glad to see Jean win the Emmy so I purchased the DVD set - thinking, this must be really good.  And it is.

3415168,5,B0018CWF02,"In the 1990s, Christina Applegate proved that she was more than capable of playing something other than sexy ditz Kelly Bundy on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Married-with-Children-The-Complete-First-Season/dp/B0000C9JFQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Married with Children - The Complete First Season</a>. She starred in the short-lived sitcom Jesse, playing a smart, sexy single mom. That show had a strong first season but too much internal tinkering by the network resulted in a lame follow-up and subsequent cancellation. After dabbling in movies for a few years, Applegate has returned to the small screen with Samantha Who?

Samantha Who? allows Christina Applegate to showcase her considerable comedic chips. With Jesse, she demonstrated a knack for verbal comedy and with a film like the underappreciated&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Sweetest-Thing-Unrated-Edition/dp/B000069HYG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Sweetest Thing (Unrated Edition)</a>, a knack for physical comedy. This show allows her to combine both of these aspects of comedy in a wonderful way. Applegate is not afraid to look silly and act goofy but there is always an intelligence to what she's doing. There's something very sympathetic about her that makes us root for Sam to reinvent herself.

The episodes are shot very much like a film - a romantic comedy broken up into half hour chunks. The dialogue is quite cleverly written and delivered in the same fashion as vintage screwball comedies - fast and furious. Samantha Who? is so well done it makes you wonder how the hell it got on the air on a major network like ABC? There is such a lack of imagination on network television that a show like this is a refreshing breath of air. The success of a smart and funny show like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ugly-Betty-The-Complete-First-Season/dp/B00005JPII/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ugly Betty - The Complete First Season</a>&nbsp;(also on ABC) paved the way for this show and proved that sitcoms don't always have to pander to the lowest common denominator.

The first disc features an audio commentary for the Pilot episode by actress Christina Applegate and executive producers Donald Todd and Peter Traugott. The two producers briefly talk about the origins of the show. They spend most of the commentary telling filming anecdotes and mentioning footage that was cut out. Applegate doesn't really contribute much but does crack a few jokes and state the painfully obvious at times.

The second disc starts off with ""Samantha Whoops?"" a brief collection of bloopers and blown lines as the cast break character and laugh at something they or someone else did.

Finally, there are seven deleted scenes with optional introductions by Donald Todd. He puts these cut scenes within context of the show. They are mostly extraneous subplots that were cut for reasons for time. This fairly amusing footage but you can see why it was cut.",1221782400,3,3049,5.858108108108108
3415169,5,B0018CWF02,just love this show.  Good comedy which are hard to find this day and age.,1216684800,2,74,3.933333333333333
3415170,5,B0018CWF02,"Girl gets hit by a car, girl loses memory of everything before the accident,girl finds out that she was a VERY mean person, girl has a change of heart now that she has a chance to start over, gril wants to be nice and correct the mistakes that her mean self did before she lost her memory.

After watching one episode of this show I was laughing and wanting more. Christina Applegate is amazing in this. Her acting is just so dead on making you laugh at how she exaggerates everything. Jennifer Esposito (who plays Andrea, Samantha's best, and only, friend before her memory loss) is also very funny in this because she basically plays a friend that is always drunk/hung over and very mean.
Samantha's parents in this are just hysterical because they are the typical mom and dad that are still treating their adult daughter like a child and ignoring her opinions and driving her crazy.
Even though a lot of people are saying that the story is not very original, I think that they get a lot of mileage out of it.
If you aren't sure that you will like this show after (at most) 2 episodes watch it on abc.com first and then decide whether you want more.
I am absolutely getting this because it kept me laughing through the whole episode. Even though the episodes are less than 1/2 hour long, I think that it is a good way to keep people begging for more. I nearly lost my mind one week when ABC announced that it would instead air ""Dancing With the Stars"" for the entire night!",1213488000,19,1475,4.402930402930403
3415171,4,B0018CWF02,"I really came to enjoy SAMANTHA WHO during its strike-shortened first season.  The premise was not necessarily all that brilliant -- a complete jerk of a human being loses her memory in a car accident and gets a fresh shot at her life -- but it provided a great platform for Christina Applegate to play a character who is in the process of self-recreation.

This is not going to go down as one of the great series ever nor even as one of the finest comedies.  It was not even the best new comedy of the 2007-2008 season (that title belongs to ALIENS IN AMERICA, but since I apparently was only one of about four dozen people to watch that one, no one knows that).  No question most of the appeal lay in Applegate's wonderfully appealing performance in the lead role.  Even though everything we learned about the old, bad Samantha was reprehensible, it was delightful to see her gamely take a new shot at life.  And she is aided by some great supporting players.  I especially loved Melissa McCarthy, best known to most TV viewers as Sookie St. James from THE GILMORE GIRLS, who plays Sam's childhood best friend Dena, whom she jettisoned as they aged and Sam moved into the cool crowd while Sam joined the uncool crowd.  Jennifer Esposito is great as the one person who was friends with the bad, old Sam and continues to be friends with the new, nicer Sam.  Barry Watson is excellent as Sam's ex-boyfriend Todd (who is still living in her condo), who starts the series off sheepish about telling her that they broke up shortly before her accident to finding himself newly attracted to the nicer version of his old girlfriend.  Kevin Dunn and Jean Smart are great as Sam's parents.  The one character I wish they could do more with is Tim Russ as Frank the doorman.  He is excellent as far as his character goes, but so far they just haven't been able to do much with it.  Hopefully that will change.  He was one of my favorite characters on STAR TREK VOYAGER as the Vulcan Tuvok.  Hopefully he'll have more to do in Season Two.

All in all, this is a fun, well written, and excellent (if unambitious) series.  It is a great vehicle for Christina Applegate.  Most of all, it is just a very, very pleasant show.",1211068800,15,2209,4.466334164588528

3415216,3,B0018CWF02,"This 2007-08 Season about this ingenious and funny sitcom about a a selfish and crass businesswoman who gets amnesia during a car accident which ran for 2 years on ABC from 2007 to 2009.

Getting acquainted with her old life, Samantha Newly(Christina Applegate) receives a second chance at being a decent and thoughtful friend and daughter, but often stumbles in her strained efforts to be a force for good.

Samantha is initially shocked at her pre-amnesia reputation for cruelty, random displays of power, mean spiritedness to co-workers, a lack of compassion for her boyfriend Todd (Barry Watson), and brutality toward a childhood friend, Dena (Melissa McCarthy). More than any of that, however, Samantha is pained by her apparent, longtime estrangement from her mother (Jean Smart) and father (Kevin Dunn), wondering how on Earth she could have done without them in her life.

The first 10 or so episodes of Samantha Who? find the new-and-improved heroine trying hard to capitalize on a different personality and perspective on things. She apologizes for old slights and unintentional, new mistakes, and leaves a lot of goodwill and some confusion in her wake. But with time and flashes of remembrance of her old life, Samantha slowly becomes a hybrid of her new sweetness and vintage schemer.

Both devil and angel, she becomes a more balanced survivor and pretty funny character. The show's creators and writers give the superb cast great material and lines on the theme of rampant dissatisfaction in relationships and hope for the future.

The scenes between Applegate and Smart, especially, are the stuff of an instant classic. The second half of Samantha Who: The Complete First Season loses a bit of steam, generating a little less laughter, though story ideas are still fresh and original. But on the whole, this is a series to embrace.

Unfortunately this sitcom toppled after only 2 years and was cancelled in the Summer of 2009, due to weak ratings.",1391990400,,1963,5.061919504643963

Samantha Who? was a series that never quite found its niche.  It seemed like most episodes were about relationships, dating or otherwise.  That can be interesting, but there was no quality workplace, as Mary Tyler Moore had in her show, nor any counterpoint with supporting characters that we might be interested in.  Given that, it was too much to expect Ms. Applegate to carry the entire series herself.  Had they tweaked the show with another star in a supporting role, the show might've worked.

Apparently no one really liked Samantha (except for her stuck up friend Andrea) prior to her being hit by a car which caused her to have amnesia.  She had a good job and boyfriend but when she began discovering herself again she found out that she really didn't like her job (and was eventually fired) and that she was cheating on her boyfriend.  When her and her boyfriend broke up all she did was want him back but he had moved on with another girl...while living in Samantha's apartment?!?!

Her chubby childhood friend came back into her life and I like that they added her character into the show...I hate when everyone in a show has to be perfect looking.  So the first season is just Samantha trying to remember her life and discover who she is now...that and the pursuit of her ex boyfriend.

My favorite show was when the mother and the best friend toilet papered the mom's old high school rival's yard.  Just the thought of a grown woman doing something like this is a hoot.

She's got no recollection of her parents, her best friend and her (ex) boyfriend.  So as she tries to regain her life, what little she knows of it, she realizes that she wasn't a very nice person before the accident.  She was calculative, backstabbing, self-centered and faithless.  And whenever she has flashbacks, it is always about something unpleasant she'd said or done to a loved one.  So she sees her lost memory as a clean slate.  She is now the ""Good Samantha,"" except that at times this good Samantha finds herself doing some not-so-good things.

I love this TV show.  It is so well written and genuinely funny.  Christina Applegate is awesome; I have been a fan of hers since Married... with Children.  Cecelia Ahern -- author of P.S., I Love You and Love, Rosie (a.k.a., Where Rainbows End) -- created this show and I couldn't enjoy it more.  I also love the cast.  Samantha's feeble and eccentric parents (Jean Smart and Tim Russ) and her BFF Andrea (Jennifer Esposito) are hilarious.  I also like Dena (Melissa McCarthy), Samantha's chubby former high school buddy.  I kind of have a love/hate relationship with Todd (Barry Watson), Samantha's ex-boyfriend.  She is silly when she's around him, but he also gets on my nerves.  I couldn't help but wonder why she doesn't order him to move out of her apartment.  Anyway, I like the DVD (in spite of its limited features) and I so look forward to picking up season two.  This show isn't as popular as it should be, and I'd be surprised if ABC does a season three.

Every cast member pulls their weight and they feed off of each other.

3415281,4,B0018CWF02,"As a lifelong t.v. fan, I just don't know what we did before shows were available in complete seasons on DVD.  Like a lot of people, I missed SAMANTHA WHO? during its initial run.  And thanks to DVD, I can now rectify that mistake.

The premise is simple enough: After waking from an 8-day coma with retrograde amnesia, a woman (the often-underrated Christina Applegate) sets about finding who she is.  But the catch is that, who she WAS before her accident was not a nice person.  At all.  With the at-times dubious support of her family and friends, Samantha sets out to become a better person with the second chance she's been given.

Like I said, simple enough.  But the writers don't use amnesia as a cop-out for cheap laughs (an early episode makes an in-joke to this effect, referring to amnesia as a tool for ""lazy writers"").  It is instead used to illuminate the human condition, albeit with some very funny stumbles along the way.  When Samantha starts having flashbacks to what will aptly become known as ""bad Sam,"" Applegate really gets to open up.  As funny and innocent as she plays Sam in the present, the Sam of the past is a complete 180 turn into an evil, mean-spirited, backstabbing opportunist.

It's an addicting journey (again with the DVD sets...I watched the entire series in 2 days) that's both funny and real.  It's not perfect, though, and the latter half of this abbreviated (15 episodes) season seems a bit unfocused.  Still, Applegate--who also serves as a producer on the show--surrounds herself with an equally-adept cast, including Jean Smart, Melissa McCarthy and the somewhat underutilized Tim Russ as Samantha's sage, dry-witted doorman.

The only extra features are a far-too-brief montage of outtakes, and some deleted scenes.  But there's a nice foldout booklet included, in which the various characters offer advice to Samantha.

The best thing about this season one set is that it made me a fan, hungry for the next season of Samantha's story.  There's not that many sitcoms out there these days, and even fewer that one could call original.  But SAMANTHA WHO? is quite refreshing.  I know I won't forget to watch it now.
