6587374,4,B00MK2VDDE,Full and fair disclosure: I am an Orson Wells fan and recently purchase five of his films. I really enjoyed the film. Everything worked well for me.,1400457600,,148,4.518518518518518
6587375,5,B00MK2VDDE,"THE TRIAL: The Trial is a terrifying, dark, twisted Kafkesque nightmare of a film, boosted by Orson Welles's stunning, dark visuals, and of course, a staggering, brilliant performance from Anthony Perkins. Perkins, in one of cinemas greatest, most befuddled performances, is absolutely electrifying as Josef K., a man who is arrested but never told why, caught up in a labyrinth of deceit, lies, and vaguery. Haunting and scary, The Trial a two-hour nightmare that is absolutely unforgettable.

Straight from the psyche of Orson Welles, this excellent film is not to be missed.

6587376,2,B00MK2VDDE,"Yeah, I think any dvd that features pictures of the actors on the cover that do not match their portrayals in the movie itself should be a red flag that signifies ""stay away""! I mean the picture of Welles on the cover is from the late 1970's at the very earliest.",1360627200,,263,4.176470588235294
6587377,3,B00MK2VDDE,"I found a lot to adore in The Trial, but just as much to furrow my brow over. The cinematography is stunning; full of visual metaphor and gorgeous photography, it's an unyielding show of moviemaking expertise. Welles plays up the bleak, ""no tomorrow"" nature of the exterior scenes, the structured chaos of the workplace and the hedonistic excess exhibited by the various stages of the trial itself, each to great effect. The story, though, feels too flighty and nebulous for my taste. It should come as no surprise, being a translation of a Kafka novel, that the entire picture often feels surreal and confusing. It continuously floats and sputters just beyond the grasp of understanding, like a moth delicately avoiding a set of flailing hands. The premise may have been established nicely during the slightly more straightforward opening scenes, but as the duration grows it becomes too ambitiously ambiguous for its own good.",1300233600,,928,5.071895424836601

6587379,2,B00MK2VDDE,"It was only after I purchased this that I realized a copyright claim was never made on this film and it has always been in the public domain, meaning there are innumerable ""bootlegs"" floating around of inferior quality of which this is one, whereas in 2000 Milestone Film & Video released a restored version based on the original negative. While this DVD delivers the goods, the quality is pretty bad, there's not even a proper menu to the film, the sound and picture quality are very average and there are no extra features whatsoever. Considering this is just an inferior dub for which the DVD maker would have had to pay $0 in licensing fees, the list price of $15.99 is hefty indeed. I'd seek out the restored original and stay away from bootlegged copies like this",1255824000,32,769,4.62043795620438
6587380,1,B00MK2VDDE,"I really don't think this works. Is it deep and meaningful, just because it borrows from Kafka? The theme of `man against an uncaring bureaucracy' only works if you are drawn into the life of the main character, which I wasn't. (Yes I know this isn't all its about.) Surrealism wasn't just stringing a few illogical, off beat ideas together. I don't think this film is thought provoking or surreal to have sets furnished with stacks of rubbish newspapers and other documents. What was the purpose behind a whole bunch of candles decorating a set? In the end I really don't care if that is supposed to mean anything or not.

There are some very good actors in this film, Anthony Perkins for one. Orson Welles as K's legal advocate, is commanding, especially the way wells uses his fabulous voice, but why is he in bed the whole time? Look, I know that there are answers to that, but they are ridiculous, and it just doesn't add to the Kafkaesque. If this is supposed to be a sort of existential psychological thriller;  then just doesn't work. Where is the frustration, the torment and the mental anguish? I've been put through far worse trials teaching for the Victorian education department!

The cinematography is reminiscent of, but not as good as `The red desert' by Michelangelo Antonioni, which was produced around the same time. The film quality in `The Trial' varies enormously; really sharp images of portraits and some great shots of eyes, but any wider shots are out of focus. The contrast varies badly and attempts at dramatic, back lit, rim lighting for example, are just too subtle for the quality of the film's cinematography to pull off.

Now about the audio: There is some really nice music in this film, classical and jazz. I don't know what went wrong with the recording of the dialogue but it sounds like it has been dubbed! The `office' scenes remind me of `Brazil' by Terry Gilliam, and whilst it isn't the same film; `Brazil' does a much better job at very similar kinds of themes. For me `The Trial' is just trying far too hard to be deep and meaningful.",1234051200,4,2078,4.653950953678474
6587381,4,B00MK2VDDE,"What The Trial lacks in comprehension (purposely at that) it makes up for in cinematography, set design, art direction and music. Essentially a nightmare tale, Joseph K. slowly comes to madness as his accusation for some unknown crime leads him into the abyss of a legal system, full of strange, abusive, mysterious, confusing people.
As a film I couldn't sit through it at once, I had to get up and return a couple times because the convoluted situation makes it hard to follow. This aspect is surely purposeful, Welles is a master of storytelling and images, and the production itself proves amazing.
I would highly recommend this for it's adaptation of Kafka's posthumous story, beautiful and horrible direction, cinematography, set and art direction and music.",1220227200,16,764,5.12

8672869,5,B00MK2VDDE,"The name has a double meaning--the trial of a boy accused of rape, and the trials of an academic lawyer trying his first live case.

Glenn Ford plays the lawyer perfectly, not as a natural genius, but as a decent human being in a hard situation.  He has to face the real temptations of an advocate: self-doubt over his lack of experience; naked fear; the chance to put political convictions or fame ahead of a client; and, in the worst moments, despair.  Glenn Ford's character in Trial has to meet them in his first case, and the tale is one of the best moral adventures I'd like new lawyers to see.  Quite a few old ones, for that matter.",1490659200,,640,4.352941176470588
8672870,5,B00MK2VDDE,"I received TRIAL as described on this page.  1955 Glenn Ford.  It is a made to order DVD-R with video and sound both excellent.  Played fine even in my fussy Sony jukebox.  Subtitles would be nice but this has none.  Amazon should remove the confusing reviews of THE TRIAL but it seems they have done nothing to correct the mixing of reviews for both movies on the page.  BTW, I think the movie is very good.",1480204800,4,408,4.302631578947368
8672871,4,B00MK2VDDE,"WARNING: There are 2 films entitled TRIAL.
Unfortunately, amazon.com has mixed the reviews for both films
which is very confusing...

""TRIAL"" was released in 1955 with Glenn Ford and Dorothy Maguire.
""THE TRIAL"" was released in 1962 with Anthony Perkins and Orson Welles.
The stories are completely different and there is no connection between them.

Technically  this is not a review but an attempt to clarify the issue.",1447977600,7,421,5.161764705882353

8672873,4,B00MK2VDDE,"Unfortunately two different sets of film reviews are being attributed to one another here at Amazon . That's too bad . Be that as it may , I saw the fascinating and greatly involving social justice drama indicated above . You know me . I'm not gonna lay it all out for you (plot , print , etc) . Suffice it to say , Glenn Ford was pretty darn good and Juano Hernandez and Arthur Kennedy were brilliant in the film Trial . Juano , who I'm seeing a lot of as I visit these older films on Amazon and Warner Archive Instant , portrays a black judge circa 1955 and he's just outstanding . Kennedy was nominated for an Academy Award I learned subsequent to watching the picture . If he did not win I'd be fairly well disappointed . His naturalistic performance is exceptional . Some aspects of the film are certainly a bit dated and the film's third reel could only happen in Hollywood (in all probability ?) . I want to see the picture again . Soon . That's my testament.....Ben",1423699200,,973,4.264864864864865
8672874,5,B00MK2VDDE,Great film. It depicts how (in this case the Communist Party) some radicals will use circumstances to further their agenda. We see it today and I challenge you to pick out similar cases. The acting and cast were exceptional. Juano Hernandez as the Black Judge was especially outstanding. If Anthony Perkins was in this film I missed him. Glenn Ford starred.,1423008000,,357,4.868852459016393
8672875,4,B00MK2VDDE,I'd forgotten the surprising deviation fro the novel's ending.,1422057600,,62,6.0
8672876,5,B00MK2VDDE,"First of all, as an earlier reviewer pointed out, this does not star Anthony Perkins. It stars Glenn Ford and Arthur Kennedy who both turn in excellent performances. Arthur Kennedy is especially good as a Communist Lawyer.
  The Trial is the trial of a  young Hispanic boy for the murder (or accidental death) of an Anglo girl in a California town with plenty of racial predjudice to go around. Glenn Ford is a young and perhaps excessively naive Law Professor who must take the case in order to prove his academic credentials. Arthur Kennedy is a cynical lawyer who gets him the case and ""helps"" him by raising money. Eventually Glenn Ford realizes that he is being manipulated by the Communist Party under Arthur Kennedy and, too late,that the Party prefers the defendant as a martyr than to get an acquittal.
  Spoiler alert: Glenn Ford turns out to be better lawyer than even he believes and the ending, while probably not realistic in a real courtroom, is a ""stand up and cheer"" victory for good sense and the ability of all of us to see past our predjudices and ultimately do the right thing.
  Although set in 1947 it retains a relevancy to today as headlines in Ferguson Mo and New York City makes clear.",1417910400,7,1212,4.609302325581395
