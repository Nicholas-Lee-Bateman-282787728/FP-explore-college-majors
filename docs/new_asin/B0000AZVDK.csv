7997923,5,B0000AZVDK,A very good DVD just the pdf files you have to find on the web look in a Search Engine I found it on Tommy Emmanuel web site he plays like Chet and learned some things from him before he past away.  I would not be a starter on guitar this is kind of hard stuff his harmonics are very hard to do even Intermediate players like me will have a problem with those with enough practice you will get them though.,1355529600,2,406,3.951219512195122
7997924,5,B0000AZVDK,"I got this DVD a few years ago. Its not easy but its worth learning. Chet explains his tunes well, and plays them so smooth it's a joy to listen. With a lot of practice you'll have 9 great guitar pieces to play. They will impress anyone.",1301702400,2,237,4.0638297872340425
7997925,4,B0000AZVDK,"If you are a Chet Atkins fan, and any guitar player should be, this little DVD is something that should always be in your collection. Not just ""how to play licks"" but a look at how Chet approached a song and how he thought.",1239062400,10,223,4.090909090909091
