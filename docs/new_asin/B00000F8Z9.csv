7907621,1,B00000F8Z9,"I purchased this video (Winterizing Your Boat) from Amazon and sent in a review a few weeks ago and it was never posted.  There was also another review that was briefly posted on Amazon for this video.  My review and the other review were less than positive.  Why aren't these reviews posted?

Does Amazon not post poor reviews?  I will no longer buy anything from Amazon until I see these reviews posted.",1169510400,,405,4.569444444444445
