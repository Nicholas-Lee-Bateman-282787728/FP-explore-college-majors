Her videos are tremendous as is her music ! she""s a great visionary , funny , witty entertaining , and a real talent ! Although this copilation does not contain all her greatest work , it still is a great collection !!! It also contains videos from Mystikal !",1313884800,,411,4.024390243902439
8212004,2,B000U35DOU,"I bought this to see the dynamic Missy Elliott...and I got her, for half a disc.  The videos featured herein are not her best, only ""The Rain,"" ""Sock It to Me,"" and ""Hit'em wit da Hee"" making it to the disc.  None of the brilliance from 2001's ""So Addictive"" makes the DVD, not one.  Considering this DVD was produced post-""The Cookbook""...I found this unacceptable.  STAY AWAY...find the videos on YouTube and call it lovely.",1233100800,2,426,4.716216216216216
