8532728,5,B000F7IME4,"This video has really helped me improve my strength and flexibility for triathlon.  Loved the ""brick"" core/cycling workout which was pretty tough.  I like the follow along routine, but needed to advance beyond the video.  The ebook included in the dvd-rom helped me immensely. Very informative and easy to follow.",1208044800,2,313,5.22
8532729,2,B000F7IME4,I purchased this video with the hopes of developing a new core routine with some variability.  This video is basic and not very motivating.  The fancy cover should not sway you into thinking that this will help you expand your core workouts.  If you have never done any core workouts then feel free to buy it.,1203811200,4,309,4.482142857142857
