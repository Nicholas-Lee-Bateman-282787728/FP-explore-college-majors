5565256,4,B00BARKZ1G,"The documentary takes you back to the 1980,s and the beginning o the Orca's demise. It has various interviews and first person narratives of how orcas actually have displayed aggressive behavior within the confined pools in SeaWorld and other places, like Loro Parque in Tenerife, Spain. There is some bloodshed in the movie, so I would advise caution if you plan on taking your kids. This piece is similar to another movie about similar cetacean, The Cove; in both movies you get pieces of a truth well hidden by those with a fat pocket, unwilling to let go the reins of a multi-billionaire industry. It's just sad.

My opinion:

Be prepared to view heartbreaking footage. To pillage another being's young, to dislpay it in front of millions of viewers and lie to the public in order to conceal the animals' frustration--leading to fatal, aggressive behavior--is immoral. It's obvious to you as a viewer how much these animals suffer when they are being taken from their pods by looking at the trainer's reaction to the animal's captivity. The saddest part of the movie for me was Tilikum's abduction. An orca's wailing after its young has been taken from its side is heartbreaking.

So think about it for one second. You're taken from your parents when you are four years old, stuck in a tank made of concrete, and forced to hang out with strangers from a diversity of cultures you would probably hate (each pod of orcas is so different that it's like comparing  the Homo sapiens, a single species, with thousands of different religions) --this is the road to insanity.

It's not only about freeing Tilikum; it's also about stopping the massive hunting of whales and other highly intelligent beings, like dolphins. Cetaceans are having a hard time nowadays. Watch ""The Cove"" and you'll see what I'm talking about.",1376006400,146,1815,4.86084142394822

5565291,5,B00BARKZ1G,"I will admit that this is a very one sided documentary. This film was done to show how Tilikum is responsible for three deaths and how it is wrong for orcas to be kept in captivity. When I was about 7 (about 7 years ago) I watched the Free Willy movies which I loved at the time and I wish that the story of Keiko, the whale in the Free Willy movies was shared. That story had similarities and differences especially since it wasn't a documentary but it had to do with captive orcas. I also wish the movie went in-depth with other SeaWorld orcas. It mainly focused on Tilikum with a few other whales here and there, I wondered if other whales were this bad. After this film I firmly believe that it is bad to keep any large mammal such as an orca in captivity. Especially orcas, with further research I found that in captivity they swim 0.0001% in one day compared to wild orcas. I also know we can not simply release the these animals but I think we should stop breeding whales so eventually we have no more of them in captivity. It'd also be really cool and helpful if we could set up a large area in the ocean for the captive whales to live out their lives in a bigger space. Don't get me wrong SeaWorld has done a lot of amazing things (not for orcas, other animals) but this is one very bad thing in my opinion. I also think that with any whale related injury we can't blame the orcas only people. These orcas are animals of instinct and are much bigger than humans it's like trusting a huge dog with a hamster and not expecting the dog to accidentally injury the little thing. Regarding all of this I think this is a must see, even if you don't like documentaries. I highly recommend watching this it's very intriguing and eye opening.",1515456000,,1741,4.278787878787878
5565292,4,B00BARKZ1G,"This spring breaks excursions to Olrandos Sea World should be interesting. While it has the feel of an extended evening news story, it gives the documentary a sort of respectable class as it chronicles the biography of Tilikum, an Orca captures in the late 1970s, unto his years as a circus animal. Blackfish defaults to actual footage which helps deliver a more pure and raw authentic documentary, while simultaneously opening up its panel for conflicting opinions on the conditions and caretakers of Orca captivity in marine parks.",1514419200,,533,5.137931034482759
5565293,1,B00BARKZ1G,"This movie is a lie and has been debunked with out dated information, disgruntled ex employees that were fired for not doing their job and profited off a trainers death. This is not a documentary",1514160000,,195,4.6
5565294,1,B00BARKZ1G,More of whining than any real facts.  Backed by disgruntled employees without any care for the fact that SeaWorld has done so much good for sea life and taught so many people about the oceans.  These animals that are depicted as being so abused has inspired many to actually care and protect our oceans.  This is one sided and refuses to address the true issues these animals must endure.,1511136000,,388,4.594202898550725
5565295,5,B00BARKZ1G,"How many among us have visited a sea world park? I have been to two of the parks and have visited multiple times over the years. They are popular places for families and the top attraction has always been the live shows, featuring killer whales and other aquatic life. But there is more going on behind the scenes with training and the treatment of the animals, all of which is the subject of Blackfish.

Killer whales are the stars of the show at water- themed parks but as Blackfish demonstrates, these large, intelligent creatures are often not treated the way they should be. The film lets the viewer see, first hand, some of the mistreatment and also points out how employees of these amusement parks often make misleading statements to the visiting public, making it seem like the killer whales are better off living in captivity. Some of the scenes will leave viewers in disbelief as they ponder what would make a business behave in such an extreme money-above-ethics manner.

At the center of Blackfish is Tilikum, the massive killer whale responsible for the deaths of several people, presumably because the trainers failed to follow proper procedure, but it sounds more like a desperation plea to avoid lawsuits. Strangely enough, Tilikum was still permitted to perform and was used for breeding in spite of the deaths. The documentary points out many problems with this decision, ultimately showing how money and greed kept Tilikum around.

To stress the points of the documentary, Blackfish features former Seaworld trainers for much of its commentary. The fact that these are people who once worked at one of the parks and actually interacted with the whales helps add credibility to the documentary. One might try to argue that these are simply disgruntled ex- employees taking out their frustrations on their former company, but I didn't sense that at all. They seemed like people with genuine concerns who hope that, by taking part in a documentary such as this, they can educate the public and encourage activism.

Blackfish is a well- made documentary that paints a very grim picture for orcas and other animals that are used for human amusement and entertainment. There are many emotional moments in the film and it will definitely strike a chord with those who watch it. Its easy to see why it has received such high praise and its effects have been felt by many. Watch it, and get educated on killer whales and what they go through as they live each day in captivity, waiting for their next performance.",1510531200,,2524,4.862790697674418

5565346,5,B00BARKZ1G,"A disturbing and infuriating documentary about the abuse of Orcas in captivity, and how that treatment has lead in turn to a startling number of deaths and serious injuries of trainers.

The film posits that taking an up to 12,000 pound creature used to freedom and traveling up to 100 miles a day with it's incredibly close extended family, capturing it ripping it away from all it knows, and plunking it in a giant concrete swimming pool with strange whales from other pods and goading them into performing tricks multiple times a day is a good formula to lead to these intelligent and amazing creatures to slowly go crazy, and act out. It's a hard concept to argue against.

This is indeed a one sided film, but there are cases where 'fair and balanced' is not an appropriate approach for a documentary. There aren't always two equal sides to every story. This is one such situation.

It's very moving to hear ex-trainer after ex-trainer express their remorse for how the whales were treated, and their sadness and anger for their fallen and injured comrades, And it's deeply chilling to see so much compelling evidence that Sea World knew just how bad things were, and worked overtime to keep it from the press, the public and even the trainers themselves  many of whom were fed lies about the whales (e.g. they live longer in captivity) that they in turn fed the visiting public.  Indeed most of the young trainers only learned how many of their predecessors had been hurt or killed much later in their careers.

The footage of the actual attacks are truly terrifying. This is not a film for kids. But it is a film to remind us of how far companies will go for a buck, and how humans can blind themselves to the sufferings of others  Orcas or other people  when it's in their short term self-interest.",1495497600,,1806,4.621875

Tilikum has been in captivity longer than any other orca whale. He was performing with Dawn, who was a senior trainer at Sea World, when things went wrong. Tilikum grabbed Dawns arm and after several minutes of being dragged under the water killed her. This launched an investigation into Sea Worlds orca whale shows regarding the safety of the trainers, and the inspiration for the documentary Blackfish.
In 2013, producers Manuel V. Oteyza and Gabriela Cowperthwaite released their new documentary Blackfish. The studio responsible for Blackfish is Manny O. Productions and it was distributed by Magnolia Pictures and CNN Films. It was directed by Gabriela Cowperthwaite, and is 83 minutes long. This documentary follows the life of Tilikum, the orca who has taken several lives, while being held in captivity.
Tilikum was taken from the wild when he was only two years old. He was put into an aquarium, and made a show animal. He killed one of his trainers here and it ultimately closed down the aquarium. Tilikum was then transferred to Sea World. Since Tilikum is a male, he had a separate tank from the females, so that they would not become aggressive towards each other. His dorsal fin is flopped to the side, which does not happen in the wild. He then killed the senior orca whale trainer Dawn Brancheau. This launched an investigation on keeping orcas and trainers in tanks. This documentary gives the history of captive of orcas and the result of Dawns death.
The documentary is mostly told by former Sea World animal trainers. This provided a unique perspective to the situation. Most of these trainers knew Dawn and Tilikum. They went through the experiences that they had while working at Sea World. Also, they talked about how they got the job. They did not need any training. Most people, including me, think that you have to go to school and learn about the animals. However, that is not true. They all received their jobs and learned on the spot. In fact, one trainer remembered only working there a week and they let her ride on the back of an orca. Having the trainers tell the documentary gave a unique and interesting perspective.
I would recommend this documentary to mature adults interested in animals. I liked that it was told by former animal trainers from Sea World. It gave a unique twist to the documentary. I liked that the followed the story of one orca specifically. Instead of doing a general documentary about orcas in captivity, following one orca gave it a good storyline. Finally, I liked that at the end the trainers got to witness wild orcas. It showed that the orcas they had worked with were not the same as the ones held in captivity.",1483315200,,2800,4.7633744855967075

5565503,3,B00BARKZ1G,The quality of this movie was good but I do not believe all of the accounts. I think there was a lot of exaggeration and blame put on Sea World when the real inhumane actions were done at other parks and locations.

I feel bad for Sea World because those trainers love the whales and dolphins they work with and have a bad reputation because of things like this.,1475539200,,460,4.2272727272727275
5565504,5,B00BARKZ1G,"Interesting documentary. I agree the park owners kept a lot of the details secret, but I really wonder why someone would not be worried in someway about getting in the water with a Killer whale.  I know the documentary said no person has been hurt by a killer whale in the wild or non have been reported.  Do you go into a lions cage and not expect there to be some risk, they are wild animals.  Even a dog or cat can strike out based on instincts.  I am glad to see they have changed the rules about trainers in the water.

I believe they have stopped the breeding programs, or I hope they have, especially across whales from different areas of the globe.  That is probably the most outrageous thing I learned about in the video, and there is more to the breeding program than this video covered, that is a shame..

Just was in San Diego this summer (2016) and although they hinted at coming changes with the program, it is still a very large draw.  They are beautiful animals that should be in the wild.  I wish each of them had a better future than just swimming in a pool.",1475020800,,1076,4.261083743842365

5565596,5,B00BARKZ1G,"When I was a kid the film Free Willy came out and from that first view, of which millions more came, I wanted to be a trainer at SeaWorld. To swim and play in the water with a big, smart, understaning animal like Jesse the main human character. Then I started going to SeaWorld as often as I could and living so close to Southern California made it easy. After learning as much as I could about orcas in general I wanted to learn about the ones I was looking at and became even more certain this was what I wanted. But to be a trainer there are a lot of things that you have to be able to do and I am now an epileptic but it turns out after all my searching for all things orca I found a history, a very secret, hidden history. This story was not a movie but rea and the endings not happy but mostly terrible. After finding a website and other orca nuts like myself I saw what lies were told (if you have taken the SeaWorld tour you have heard them too). Orcas can live over 100 years in the wild (Corky at SeaWorld San Diego is well over 40). Only .01% of wild orcas have a bent dorsal while every captive male and many females do. And they really do spead much if not all their lives together or pretty close. Imagine your child, you love them and teach them and would do anything to protect them but in the night someone came for her and no matter how long or loud you called she never ever responded and you never knew what became of her. You couldn't even ask because no one spoke your language nor cared how sad you were because that happens in captivity all the time not just to Kassie (they moved not just her daughter but her grand daughter too which the film doesn't mention). It's a heart breaking film but before going to a marine park or taking your children to one give this documentary a chance. It's not just some pack of lies made up by so called ""tree hugers"", it's facts and as they say sometimes the truth hurts. I would watch it without your kids first I've seen some of the footage even  before this film and its hard for me so I'd only watch it without a kid present and then decide if your kid is old enough and mature enough to  can handle it or not. I hope this review helps in some small way because it's thanks in large part to this film and the brave former trainers willing to speak that changes, such as no longer breeding orcas in captivity (at SeaWorld anyway) has stopped and that water works (human in water interaction with trainers) are being phased out. If you want to learn more about orcas both wild and captive there is a great website at www.orcahome.de (I know the ""de"" is German but it's in English) and its how I first got to know all the names and relations of the captive orca community. At least now enough people have seen this movie to really make a change. With every ticket not sold a message gets sent over and over.",1465171200,2,2869,4.167567567567567

It claims that orcas live the equivalent of human lifepsans; according to the Canadian Science Advisory Secretariat and all other studies conducted on orca lifespan this is false. It implies the dorsal collapse is due to emotional stress when it is actually due to a lack of speed swimming. It claims that raking is not seen in the wild; this is false.

But this... This waste of celluloid film. This takes the cake in terms of bad editing. In fact, this movie was just a cheap excuse to milk money out of the tragic death of Dawn Brancheau. Adding to how much of a joke this film is, Gabby Cowperthwaite gets a bunch of trainers who quit allegedly due to the ""abusive treatment"" the orcas at SeaWorld. But the real truth is that they did not quit at all. It turns out that the trainers quit out of spite, or got fired. Some examples include Jeff Ventre who got demoted after it was revealed that he couldn't swim to save his own life. Dean Gomersall got fired for kicking an otter, and John Jett got fired for sticking his head inside an orca's mouth like if he was a neoprene clad lion's tamer.

Most of the footage isn't even from SeaWorld. It's a bunch of stock footage.

Overall, this movie is an insult meant to slander SeaWorld with extreme prejudice and to those who have seen the film and then impulsively go into social media with their ""boycott SeaWorld"" and ""empty the tanks"" hashtags should be ashamed of themselves. especially for using this movie as a way to damage SeaWorld by shaming artists such as Heart, Joan Jett. 38 Special, Willie Nelson, Wynonna Judd, and the Barenaked Ladies into cancelling their concerts there.

I have seen Tilikum perform after Dawn's death.  He is huge, I don't think the film did him justice with how large is truly is.

It would be one thing for SeaWorld to rescue injured whales and then keep them (Such as the place where Winter the Dolphin is kept.  They only keep animals who would not be able to survive in the wild on their own), but to hunt whales and seperate them from their families, that is just unacceptable.

I am avidly against Sea World, and zoo's in general.  Why are we keeping animals in cages, where they don't belong?  Anywhere?  Really?  I am especially horrified about Sea World.

5565693,5,B00BARKZ1G,"Blackfish, is a documentary film that premiered on January 19, 2013. It is directed by Gabriela Cowperthwaite who interviewed many former SeaWorld employees to contribute in stating their claims on the argument between OHSA and SeaWorld. Blackfish informs us about a 12,000 pound Killer whale named Tilikum who supposedly have killed three people during captivity. This documentary drives us into many incidents that give justification for why Tilikum reacts in an aggressive manner. Blackfish is a riveting documentary that surpasses expectations and gives viewers insight that whales in captivity will become very sick and unstable if held too long.

  A big pro that was in Blackfish is the great use of facts, photos, and videos. For instance, a tragic event happened in SeaWorld that generated a significant portion in the film. One of the top senior trainers in SeaWorld named Dawn Brancheau was attacked by Tilikum. Tilikum tugged Dawn by her ponytail very vigorously on the ledge of the pool and made her drown. Blackfish uses the actual footage of Dawn Brancheau's death to show to us that it really happened. Not only do they show footage, but what also helps were the clear photos of her authentic autopsy displaying all the fractures and lacerations all over her body. Blackfish by all means gives us incredible evidence on this death experience and many others which convince us that SeaWorld should not leave whales in captivity. Moreover, the facts were very relevant to the film too. Some of the facts that really caught my eye were regarding Orcas. Howard Garrett, an Orca researcher states ""Females can live to about 104 and males to about 50 or 60."" Neuroscientist, Lori Marino states that ""They have an extra part of the brain that we humans don't have known as the paralimbic cleft, which processes emotions."" These interesting facts really bring out the best in Blackfish.

  On the other hand, if I had to choose one weakness in the documentary, Blackfish I would say they should be even handed with their arguments. Blackfish only suggests to us all the negative things about SeaWorld and doesnt acknowledge any of the positives. A positive they can bring to our attention is that without SeaWorld, no one would be able to see the animals in person. They should indicate both the positives and negatives so the audience can see both sides of the argument. Nonetheless, the point of Blackfish is to show us that SeaWorld thinks it's perfectly fine to leave whales in captivity when all it's doing is causing harm to everyone. In this case, they are supposed to only show the negatives.

  Overall, I strongly recommend Blackfish to Animal Rights Activists and honestly everybody in general. I feel everybody needs to view this film to see what SeaWorld is actually doing to these poor whales with leaving them in captivity. After watching this documentary, people will realize they need to stop going to SeaWorld and that they need to release the whales! Blackfish really emphasizes all the stories including dates and locations with each former SeaWorld employee precisely. I really enjoyed this film, and I'm sure you guys will too. And last but not least, let's not forget, ""Free Tilly!""",1459555200,,3213,4.990654205607477

5565757,4,B00BARKZ1G,"Blackfish is a pretty sad documentary about the treatment of Killer Whales at the Sea World Parks.  How they originally captured them in the early 1980s in the Pudget Sound Iceland.  They used spotter planes and rounded the pods up in nets, tore the babies away from their screaming mothers and put them up for show in small tanks at the sea parks.  You can tell in one of the interviewed former hunters voice that he has a lot remorse for being part of that project even today.  I would have liked more of his point of view on the documentary.  What gives the movie credibility is the testimony of the former trainers.  Some of their experiences about working at the park with the whales is the heart of the movie in my opinion.

Besides the Killer Whale attraction the documentary made me wonder how the other animals are fairing.  What shocked me most was the abuse the poor male whale suffered at the hands of the female killer whales.  I had no idea the females would attack and abuse the bigger male whale because it was not from the same pod.  Those scenes where they show how beat up he was after they take him out of the pool would definitely leave mental damage to the whale.  It is no wonder why the trainers would be in danger.

Sea World does a lot of good things as well.  It is not strictly about the abuse and mistreatment of its orcas in captivity.  The documentary is overwhelmingly negative.  But you have to remember as humans we are already destroying these animals food source by polluting the environment.  How many whales die each year in fishing nets or oil spills caused by humans?  I am not saying capturing Orca's is right, you have to look at the big picture.

I am kind of in the middle ground about this documentary.  Because I love Sea World and think it is a great experience for a family.  I have been to San Diegos Sea World twice and thought it was a very nice park with lots of variety and fun attractions.  I would still take my children to a Sea World Park even after watching this documentary.

I would rate this movie 4 stars it is not easy to watch and is very sad at times but definitely was a story that needed to be told.  No trainer would truly be safe or think about going into the tanks with the whales after watching some of the footage in this movie.  What many would have considered a dream job could become a deadly nightmare.

Being from Oregon I was really surprised that Sea World did not try and bring Keiko the star of the Free Wily movies to their parks.  A lifelong captive whale that quickly died after being set free in the wild.  Kind of a damned if you do and damned if you don't dilemma.",1456272000,,2651,4.313765182186235

5565771,1,B00BARKZ1G,"Should animals be kept in captivity? I own pets, therefore I support captivity and I would be hypocrite, like most Blackfish Supporter are, if I would boycott SeaWorld or other zoological facilities. They always say: ""my dog is a domesticated animal"" well, was the very first dog domesticated though? Didn't they have to capture wild animals from the wild and breed them with other types of their species? I think that we learn a lot from these animals when they are in our care. A lot of what they learn from the animals in their care can be used to better understand animals in nature. Yes, some of this research can happen in nature but to fully understand all the intimate details of these animals you have to spend years studying them. Its not something that is easily done in the wild. 80% of the animals that are currently in their care were born at SeaWorld and not from the wild. Those animals, like Tilikum, that were captured in the wild have been in captivity for 30+ years. They haven't captured animals from the wild in 35 years and have no plans on capturing animals in the future.

I agree with the changes SeaWorld has been forced to make with regards to having trainers in the water with Orcas. Trainer safety should be and is one of their top priorities. Any animal, even our own pets, has the ability to hurt us and our children under the right circumstances. When you're talking about an animal the size of a Killer Whale, you just cant predict how they will behave on a bad day.

With regards to concerns that these animals are living in tanks that aren't big enough for them Im not really sure what the answer should be to solve this. I wholeheartedly understand the migratory nature of these creatures and how they shouldnt live in fish bowls but the same could be said for any living animal that is cared for in our zoos and aquariums. Should bears, monkeys, sharks, lions, giraffes, and elephants have larger enclosures in zoos and aquariums? You can see that answer at many of our national zoos as they continue to increase their living areas. The harder problem to solve is how to find the money for those advancements. What type of impact financially do you think these parks will face after being boycotted? How is that going to HELP those animals currently in their care? They CANNOT just let these animals go back into the wild without significant amounts of rehabilitation and preparation; and even then I truly don't think those animals who were born at SeaWorld would EVER be able to adapt in the wild.

SeaWorld is one of the leaders in wildlife rescue and have saved over 27,000 animals who have been hurt, injured, or sick in the wild. Their primary goal when they rescue these wild animals is to be able to release them back into their environment. Im thankful that they help conserve our natural resources by protecting and saving these precious creatures. They wouldnt be able to continue these efforts if everyone decided to boycott them and there aren't enough non-profit volunteers out there to support massive rescue efforts like those in the 2010 BP oil spill; which saved 100 engendered sea turtles.

Education, this is a big one for me! If it weren't for parks like SeaWorld, many children would never be able to see these animals up close. Their parks educate children and adults on how our decisions impact the lives of these animals. They educate us on how leaving litter on the beaches can impact the health and well being of dolphins in the wild. I think one of the reasons I have such an affinity to these animals is because SeaWorld inspired me to care more about Orcas and dolphins. SeaWorld inspires people! We wouldn't care mich about Killer Whales if SeaWorld wouldn't exist. Thank you SeaWorld!",1451347200,3,3754,4.649096385542169
5565772,1,B00BARKZ1G,"This is not a documentary.  It's an opinion piece.  And it's full of outright lies and misinformation.

This review is not about whether or not it's legal or ethical to keep large mammals in captivity.  In most cases, I would say they shouldn't keep large mammals in captivity.

The problem with this movie is that it takes people who have not worked at Sea World for decades (in some cases) commenting like they know what goes on now.  They overlay misleading dialogue over videos taken out of context.  And they artfully cut interviews in such a way that several of the people interviewed are  coming out and against the film.

If you truly believe that keeping animals in captivity is wrong, then you should want a documentary that gives the whole truth (good and bad) and shows that the bad outweighs the good.  This movie is for people who are lazy and want something they can just click ""like"" on and not put any real thought into.

Real life is not so simple.  It's not going to be easy to reintegrate whales born in captivity into the wild.

5565774,4,B00BARKZ1G,"I am 100% bleeding heart liberal when it comes to animals and some of the footage in this documentary was so heartwrenching I literally had to turn away. Keeping such intelligent, LARGE animals in what is probably the proportional equivalent of a jacuzzi is beyond inhumane, it borders on cruelty.  There is simply no justification for keeping large animals with a tremendous instinct and need to roam in captivity unless they are infirm -- tigers, wolves, dolphins, whales.  Entertaining snotty kids is just about the worst reason conceivable.

Where this documentary loses credibility with me is where it becomes less about the well-being of whales, but more about big bad SeaWorld versus the trainers and OSHA. Wait, what? Since when did adult humans need to be told that a top predator called KILLER WHALE (not fluffy bunny, not cuddly mouse) is inherently dangerous, and that risk is something they voluntarily take on when they get in the water with these animals? The OSHA expert himself said that he doesn't mess with orcas and that they rule the water.  When I get in a car I understand the inherent risk of getting in an accident and weigh that risk against the benefit of driving. When I climb a mountain, I weigh the obvious risk of serious injury/death against the thrill of the summit.  I bet everything that this is exactly the decision the trainers make.  The documentary makes it sound like SeaWorld chains non-sentient trainers to the pools and forces them to train whales or face starvation.

Ban capture and captivity of whales because there is simply no justification for it.  But seriously WTF does OSHA have to do with saving whales?  They made no move to ban whale capture by ANY means; they are only (further) limiting the captive whales' contact with other living beings.",1450051200,,1797,4.865573770491803

They discuss their love for these whales and how they loved their jobs, but over time had to face conflicting feelings over the lives the wales were living in captivity, and the risks they were knowingly taking by preforming with them.

There's a fair amount of controversy in the reviews about this documentary being bias, and yes, it is bias. There are two sides to every story, and just because they're not argued at this same time doesn't mean the side that is arguing is wrong. Just like anything in life, mistakes have been made.

5565795,2,B00BARKZ1G,"Let me begin by saying that the only reason I am writing this review is that I hate for myself and others to be manipulated.

From the family of former SeaWorld trainer Dawn Brancheau:""
The film (Blackfish) has brought a great deal of attention to the welfare of animals, and for that we are grateful. However, 'Blackfish' is not Dawn's story. Dawn Brancheau believed in the ethical treatment of animals. ... Dawn would not have remained a trainer at SeaWorld for 15 years if she felt that the whales were not well cared for.
""A human life was lost that day and it feels as though some believe her death was just a footnote.""

Anyone that doubts this can spend just a couple of minutes doing an online search of Blackfish Lies or Debunking Blackfish. Or simply click on the following links:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V95F8rzQDWk or http://seaworldcares.com/the-facts/truth-about-blackfish/
In fact, they have even lowered themselves to taking out of context statements made by trainers.  For this to be considered a legitimate documentary it should at least try to be accurate and non-manipulative which, it is NOT.
This is simply a propaganda piece filled with errors, omissions.
This so-called documentary has since been debunked:
1. ""SeaWorld Keeps Their Whales In Chlorine-Filled Tanks.""
The three Shamu Stadium facilities have 132 million gallons of salt water recycled and reused every day.
2. ""Their Dorsal Fins Are Flopped Over. It Means They're Sick.""
It is simply the affect of gravity over time on the fibrous connective tissue that makes up dorsal fins and tail flukes which, has zero affect on the orca's health, welfare, and agility.
3. ""They Keep Tilikum Alone In A Pool So Small That He Can't Move.""
That was the medical pool.
4. Sea World only cares about money
From 2010 - 2013, funds invested by SeaWorld in the maintenance, safety, and technological advancements in the killer whale areas of the facilities alone was over $70 Million.""
5. ""In Blackfish, they show you footage of orcas getting captured in the 1970s. This is true; in the 1970s, heaps of orcas were captured and sold to marine parks. However, these days marine mammals are only captured in Asia and Russia. For over 20 years, SeaWorld has never captured an orca from the wild or supported industries that do catch them"".
6. Teeth drilling:
In captivity, killer whale's teeth often get worn down and they require some drilling. The whales are specifically trained to comfortably stay there with their mouth open (a very basic husbandry behavior) while trainers check their teeth or even clean them. The tooth being worn down does not always have to do with biting the concrete.
This is not even a complete list.

Killer Whales at SeaWorld are getting better healthcare than most people in the U.S. and have a life span equal to wild Killer Whales.
Just a few examples:
1. Preventative health care with monthly health exams.
2. A team of water quality experts on call 24/7.
3. 24 hour a day observation.
4. Personal trainers.
5. Multi-million dollar, sophisticated, habitats that are constantly maintained.
6. Nutritionist.
7. A holistic behavioral program that focuses on health, exercise, and mental challenges.
SeaWorld has saved over 25,000 animals over the last 50 years.
(A complete breakdown of these figures can be seen on their website.)

Blackfish was made by members of PETA, so of course its going to be a propaganda piece.
PETA is in many ways the source of this propaganda piece and they believe the following:
1. Drinking Milk - cruel to cows
2. PETA's homeless pets centers have one of the very highest rates of euthanizing in the U.S.A..
3. All animal testing must be stopped.
4. Pokemon glamorizes violence against animals.
5. No pets
6. No animal products for food or clothing.
7. Commercial use of any animal is wrong even if it increasing that species population and saves it from being endangered or extinct. 60 minutes
8. Accused of Eco-terrorism in the United States. Wikipedia",1447027200,,3990,4.967065868263473

5565821,5,B00BARKZ1G,"I am reading a lot of ""reviews"" of the movie that I am pretty sure are from current SeaWorld employees or shareholders.
The fact is this: if you do not like the film, don't watch it. Otherwise, beware that what you will see and hear in this documentary are crushing blows to the animal industry.
As humans, we seem to feel the need to ""own"" everything. Why do we keep animals in cages? Why do we profit from their suffering? From the early days of Barnum and Baileys, to the current days of SeaWorld, Loro Parque, and the Miami Seaquarium, we find it amusing to force animals to do our bidding. And this film attempts to question that. But the more pressing issue here, I think, is how we get these orcas. Captured off of Puget Sound, these animals are consistently separated from their families and pods, netted, transported (sometimes over a span of up to 85 days), and dumped in small, inadequate, and empty tanks where they are housed, made to perform, and made to earn their food. Anyone saying that this film is simply propaganda needs a reality check.

Imagine this: you are sitting at your computer right now. You are comfortable. You stand and walk to the kitchen and grab some food. You sit back down. Your mother calls, and you answer. ""How was work?"" ""It was good. I got paid today."" ""Love you."" You decide that the day is beautiful, so you change your clothes and go for a run. What a great day.
You get back an hour later, take a nice hot bath, and get in bed to binge watch Netflix. Life is awesome. You plug in your phone: battery's dying. You lift your head. BAM. You are stunned by the web of a net. You can't escape. Above you, strange creatures are making noise, laughing, taking pictures. You reach for your phone to call for help. Call mom. Call the police. But you can't reach. You scream. But no one, except the strange creatures, can hear you. You start rolling around, thrashing, kicking. But the net is strong. And you are lifted in the net. The air feels thick. You see that your neighbors are in nets, too, but you can't hear them or help them. You are lowered into a canvas bag, your arms, head, and legs sticking through holes. You are put into the back of a huge truck, and you are driven for miles away from your house. You are sealed in a metal box, and you are occasionally given air and food. But you have nowhere to go to the bathroom. You feel afraid and anxious and dirty. You spend hours, days, months traveling away from home. So far away from home. Your mother must be worried. Your little brother must be crying. You lose track of the days. It's so dark.
And then one day, you see the light. ""Freedom,"" you think.
But you are greeted with another truck, another drive, more strange people and stranger noises. You are pulled toward a hallway. On the other side, there is light, and a strange smell. You are pushed into a room, and a large metal door is closed. You spend a few days pacing back and forth. A few times a day, someone tosses some food through the door. You refuse to eat at first, but then you can't help yourself. You eat all the food. You wait for the strange figures to return, even though you hate them. You think about your family.
Weeks later, a strange being takes you outside onto a platform. It moves its arms and makes noises. It uses food to make you move to a certain area. You don't want to, but your stomach is growling angrily. So you follow the food. And the figure gives you a small taste. And for the next three months, you do this each day. And you learn that if the figure makes a certain noise, you should move a certain way. And if the figure holds its hand up, you should touch its hand. It calls you a strange name. You try to tell it that this isn't your name, but it doesn't understand.
And one day, you notice a strange smell as you are led to the platform. And when you exit, there are hundreds of these strange figures watching you and making noise. You are so scared. But you haven't eaten, and this figure wants you to turn about, lie on your stomach, clap your hands. And you do. Why do you do it? Because hunger is far worse than this. Because if you don't, the figure will deprive you of food. Because maybe if you do, you can go home.

And then it's thirty years later. You've been at this for thirty years. Your body hurts. Your cage is too small for your size. The food is the same, each day. You haven't used your language in thirty years. Maybe you forgot it. Your legs hurt because you can only walk a few feet in your tiny cage each day. You are bored every day. So bored. So you started chewing on your cage. And you break your teeth and injure your jaw. Your head hurts because you hit it against the walls during the night. And you hate these figures. They don't speak your language. The simply tell you what to do. How to act.
You go to sleep one night. And you don't wake up. You have always hoped that the least these figures could do for your efforts and sacrifices is to give you a plaque or at least bury you. But they cut you open, say that you ""died happy, and of old age"" (even though you were only 50), and toss your body in a landfill. You are forgotten, because they find another human and give it your name.

Now look down. You are safely at home, or work, or school. You know that this will never happen to you. But it is happening right now. This film is telling you this message. If you take anything away from this, it is to not buy tickets to these places, because you are directly funding something that is inhumane. If you stand by and do nothing, you are as bad as the person putting a wild, free-born creature in a net and profiting.",1442534400,3,5656,4.264432029795159

5565861,5,B00BARKZ1G,"This review is from: The Cove (DVD)

A must see for anyone that is concerned about big business and it's abuse of the environment in order to make money. For a long time now,
Sea World has been sugar coating the facts of how they obtain and care for the marine life they use in their theme parks.
Finally, a provocative and enlightening look at Sea World and their most unsettling cover-up, the death of an orca trainer by an animal that had an extensive history of violent behavior and the way Sea World has treated that particular animal during the time it has been in the care of the facility.
This is an awakening for anyone that has been duped into buying the fairy tales that Sea World has spun all in the effort to not be held responsible for their part in death of the trainer and the less than stellar treatment of an animal that was ripped from it's family in the wild at a very young age in order to entertain mindless humans like a side show freak.",1437523200,,960,4.274725274725275

But, the marketing and promotion of these beautiful creatures is a shame. They should be kept in the wild as evidenced by the content of this documentary.

5565914,5,B00BARKZ1G,Arrived on time & was excellent.,1432944000,,32,4.5
5565915,3,B00BARKZ1G,"Blackfish is a movie that mainly tries to explain the terrible captivity for killer whales used for shows, more specifically at SeaWorld. Blackfish uses mostly logos about orcas to show how they are suffering by using scientific figures about their lives in the wild and comparing it to their miserable lives at SeaWorld. Blackfish uses Tillikum, an orca that was captured in 1983, as a main character from the orcas side. On the other hand, the movie uses former SeaWorld trainers, orca researchers and experts. The tragedy theme appears when it comes to the trainers. Its kind of showing that the trainers were also victims of SeaWorlds lies. The pathos and ethos appeals are evident in the movie when it covers the trainers, researchers, experts or even public media side. These emotions show how the movie tries to exonerate many guilty sides and blame only SeaWorld and the similar firms by using lots of pathos on the trainers side while the main victim is the orca. However, the trainers notices many times that SeaWorld does wrong thing, the researchers knew from before that SeaWorld lies, and the public media publishes what SeaWorld says. I think the movie ignores all of the trainers acts and makes them victims, avoids talking about the silence of the researchers and media, and directs all the blames against SeaWorld.
Blackfish starts with flashback showing footage from Dawns death with music and people talking in the background. The short flashback shows that there is a crime.  After the flashback, the movie starts with interviewing some former SeaWorld trainers. The pathos appeal is clear here. Emotional moments, reasons behind trainers joining SeaWorld, and emotional music and effects make the viewer love them and just want to hear about their experiences. I think we can say its pathos to make the trainers ethos; after all the emotions the movie makes the viewers feel about trainers; they are now, no doubt, honest people. In an emotional way, Blackfish brings Dawn to life using trainers reviews and footage about her. After that, the movie brings SeaWorld to the scene using recording from an investigating with SeaWorld Paramedic, Thomas Tobin, followed by public medias footages show the anger of people. All these direct the anger of watchers towered SeaWorld. All what have been mentioned up to this point shape the wonder, why all the researchers, media and many other responsible departments waited until someone died to do something. Basically, the production makes me feel that we don't stand against injustice; if we do, its not until its against humans. One of the footage archive from CNN in Blackfish a news anchor says If you were in a bathtub for 25 years, don't you think youd get a little irritated, aggravated, maybe a little psychotic?!. The anchor is attacking Thad Lacinak, Former SeaWorld Executive, with these words. Therefore, people knew it was wrong, but no one have stand against it until Dawns death.
Back to he root, the logos appeals cover this part where in Blackfish they talks about hunting the killer whales. Figures and some information about hunting the whales are shown. At this part also, John Crowe, a whale hunter, talks about his adventures with hunting whales. I noticed that in his part there is no music or emotional effects. Some emotions come from the way John talks, but in Blackfish John Crowe mentions that although he knew it was wrong to hunt whales, he did it anyway. Blackfish doesnt show hunters being really guilty. Although this class of society, hunter, is not enough educated to figure out how wrong is the act they are doing, they still are guilty, because as I mentioned, John Crowe knew that, but he didn't stop. Now Blackfish starts talking about Tilikum. He was hunted in 1983 and brought to SeaLand. The logos appeals still there, actually, most of the talks about whales are logistic. Blackfish shows that SeaWorld was lying about some facts related to whales. The age, the fact of the dorsal fin and that the killer whales live better and longer by them, all these were lies by SeaWorld. The concern is why the public media and researchers didn't respond to that, did they know they were lying? In Blackfish, Howard Garrett, an orca researcher, said We knew by 1980, after half a dozen years of research, that they live equivalent to human life spans. And every potentially embarrassing fact is twisted and turned and denied one way or another. So they knew it. One of the pathos appeals comes with whales is when they separate the baby whale, Kalian, from her mom, Katina. That part is very emotional, it makes the watcher feel its human baby being separated from her mom. The trainers, as they mention, knew there was something wrong but they didn't do anything.
Blackfish brings also some stories and footage about accident happened by killer whales. Pathos is included in most the stories were they bring relative of victims to talk about it. Two ladies narrated one story about Keltie Byrne who was killed by Tilikum before SeaWorld bought him in emotional way. In the story about Byrne, the news paper lied or ignored this!. Many other stories are mentioned but public media and responsible companies ignored all of them. The most effective part in the whole movie is in Spain, when Estefania Rodriguez talks about her fianc Alexis Martinez, Loro Parque Trainer, who was killed by killer whale. This part was full of emotional feelings that make audience cry. Another face in this part was the bad face of the companies thats responsible for all these insane acts. That face appears when the managers came to the hospital with their lawyers and all they care about is to show that they were innocent. At the last, Blackfish brings the story of Dawn Brancheau, The main story, and starts blaming SeaWorld in order to direct the facts and stories in the movies toward it. However, the analyzing of Dawn accident by the trainers and experts at the end makes viewer thinks it was Dawn fault. The Blackfish ends telling what was the reaction and judgments on SeaWorld and trying to convince audiences to stand against this institution.
In conclusion, Blackfish shows the guilt of SeaWorld and many other similar companies by using many sides witnessing against them. Blackfish, some how, shows that there are another guilty sides, however, the pathos appeals reject audience from realizing that. We cant make full judgment since SeaWorld didn't participated, but if they had, I think the only thing they can say is  were not the only guilty side.",1432944000,,6543,4.9096657633243

5565922,5,B00BARKZ1G,"First, the mundane: delivery, the physical product was excellent, fast, no problems with Amazon's service.  Second --  AND MOST IMPORTANT -- this is a film that SHOULD, MUST be seen!  It's well done, documented, and entertaining while at the same time telling the story of whales in captivity.  I read the book, Beneath the Surface/Killer Whales, SeaWorld, and the Truth Beyond Blackfish by John Hargrove that introduced me to the movie.  Together, they tell a very different story than is purported by SeaWorld pertaining to the treatment and well-being of Orcas in captivity.  I say this is a MUST SEE since the the television airwaves are being bombarded by SeaWorld's commercials creating an ""everything is fine"" narrative.  For us -- the audiences of SeaWorld, lovers of these magnificent creatures, and witnesses to amazing feats by both the human trainers and five to ten ton majestic behemoths --  information and truth are paramount to know.  Do we believe keeping these whales in captivity to amaze and put us in a state of wonderment is a price to high to justify or is SeaWorld's position that no harm comes to these whales is acceptable.  I believe the film makers and the trainers themselves tell a story -- entertainingly, fast-paced and magnificently -- tell a story that we must all consider.  Get the film.  Read the book.  Make your own judgement.  You'll be entertained and mesmerized while viewing.  And that makes for a great film!",1432512000,,1453,4.946280991735537

The documentary is a cash cow for those who produced it and they only did it to make money. They made a heart wrenching film about...  nothing really, when you look at what's really horrible and being done to whales. But people would buy it because it's heart wrenching to see babies taken from their moms... more so than to see whales getting killed in the wild. and the 5star people are eating it up. BUT... WHALES are not being helped at all!!! here's a fact for you from (us.whales.org)...

Japan, Norway, and Iceland still KILL 2,000 whales every year!!!!

Why didn't they make a movie about that? I'm guessing there's no money in that! All this arguing about a couple of whales in captivity, whom by the way are doing more to educate people about whales than the jokers who made this film, when there are thousands and thousands of whales killed every year, year after year.... this fill is total BS, and I'm not going to support people who are just using a sad situation to get rich while the real issues goes unnoticed and unreported!!!",1432252800,10,1192,4.534883720930233

SeaWorld TELLS YOU this but do some research and you'll quickly find that there are hundreds of non-profit marine animal rescue groups that do one hundred times more rescuing and spend much more money than SeaWorld, when SeaWorld has thousands more employees and makes millions and millions in profits. The difference between the true animal rescue groups and SeaWorld is that SeaWorld pays big money to publicize every single rescue they are involved in, versus the other TRUE rescue groups which focus only on the animals and their well-being and aren't concerned with publicizing every move they make. SeaWorld has more money and pays big bucks to make sure everything they do gets a big press release.

This film is excellent, even if your drive train does not veer to the left. The reason is mainly for SeaWorlds dishonesty, and arrogance. Of course, this is a documentary and it is subject to opinions and bias. But the case they present is pretty strong and there is not much room for questioning. The main character of the film is Tilikum, one of SeaWorlds main attraction. As intelligent as these animals are, you almost wonder why the Orca attacks were questioned. The events that led up to the death of two trainers explains why the attacks occurred. It is interesting nevertheless, that Tilikum remains an attraction at Sea World.

There's little or no attempt to show the ""other side of the story"" or even acknowledge that it exists, and that's unfortunate.  It also makes it less valuable to discuss with kids to have a real conversation about whether or not the ideas in this movie have great merit and accuracy.

If you're stupid enough to make a career participating in this type of horrible (torturing Orcas) work then I could care less if you are hurt or what your working conditions are like.

5565990,5,B00BARKZ1G,"This is the heartbreaking story of Tilikum, an orca who was captured as a baby by SeaWorld and taught to do trick to entertain us.  I know I might be going out on a ledge here, but I believe that some day we'll look back on this period of time as one of the cruelest times for animals, and Orcas will bring home how cruel we once were in our ignorance.

I know that people will say that Orcas are just animals but their behavior says otherwise.  Through this film I learned that Orcas learned all about the boats that come to take their babies from them. The males would head up one channel of the waterway, while the mothers and babies would head up another to throw the boats off the scent.  What this says is that Orcas remember events, and fear the same thing happening, so they have a plan that they all adhere to as a group.  That doesn't exactly sound like a dumb beast to me.

Another instance came when the 4 1/2  calf of one of the captive female whales was taken from her.  Keep in mind that families stay together for life, so this mother and calf expected to be with each other forever,  and the whales trusted the trainers to care for them, so when the mother and baby were separated and the baby sent away, the mother cried in a way that SeaWorld had never heard before.  When a whale expert was brought in, it was discovered that the mother was sending out a long-distance cry, as if her baby could hear her.

Story after story was told by the trainers who worked at SeaWorld with the whales every day, until finally, some couldn't, and some were killed.  Trainers told stories of decades of whale attacks, both against the trainers and against each other.  Orcas live in close-knit families, just as humans do, and they live just as long as humans, nearly a hundred years for the females.  Imagine another species coming into our human families and kidnapping the children, making them live as entertainment in tiny pools for the rest of the life?  Sounds like slavery, and maybe someone day we'll learn exactly what Orcas as trying to tell us and that might not be a happy day for us.  Just as we assumed other cultures had no soul(and women), we might be shocked to learn that the whales and dolphins do indeed have souls.

Ultimately this is the story of Tilikum, a bull male who grabbed a female trainer and dragged her to the bottom of the pool to her death.  It's the tragic story of a baby whale taken from his family, beat up by strange females, milked for his sperm, locked in small pens when finally he breaks and kills someone who loves him.  For the last 3 years Tilikum sits alone in his pen, coming out only for his wave to the crowd.  I can't help but think that inseminating female Orcas might be considering rape if they could communicate with us and I'm equally sure that we wouldn't want it done to us without our permission.

One of the things a representative from SeaWorld said was that whales in the wild suffer from fin-collapse.  Having observed Orcas for nearly 30 years in the wild, I'd say that fin collapse NEVER happens in the wild.  Whales in SeaWorld are crippled from their captivity. They kill only in captivity.

Tilikum is a dangerous, wild animal and if he were a dog, he'd be put down.  Instead, Tilikum is used for breeding purposes and now there are many Orcas in SeaWorld that are his children but hopefully without his neurosis's.  I've been to SeaWorld and it was a great experience for the kids, but I had no idea how awful it was for the whales.  I will never go back to one.",1427068800,4,3537,4.376722817764166

5566001,4,B00BARKZ1G,"It's rather a shame that this movie is recommended viewing alongside idiot agitprop hit pieces like Food Inc. and The Cove. Where those movies are about privileged white people attempting to impose their biases on the rest of the world and often coming up with outright moronic conclusions and conspiracy theories, this movie is a fairly comprehensive take on the problems of Sea World and the way that the place trains its employees to spout half-truths and outright lies.

Much of the film focuses on the trainers who are obviously conflicted about their role in the sea shows. Some advocate releasing the killer whales while others seem like they would be content with larger tanks that allow for greater mobility. Regardless, there does seem to be a palatable sense of frustration when it comes to working with animals who are suffering from their captivity.

It is a muckraker movie, but it's one of the better ones.",1424908800,,921,4.897435897435898

The fact that you could see something up so close that would normally be in the depths of the ocean is thrilling . This movie tells the story of how our human curiosity and even love of animals can go awry when we cross boundaries or try to 'humanize' an animal whose natural instincts are diametrically opposed to ours. The footage does give you a perspective of the incredible attachments to each other the whales have. It's also tragic in telling of how , un-knowingly, we contribute to the suffering of captive animals. You are drawn to the whales and also to the trainers who have lived with the animals & love them, yet risk their lives. Much has been learned over the years from witnessing how whales respond , their hierarchy, their intelligence. But sadly, the 'teachers' have given and taken lives in the process. Perhaps this glimpse into reality will cause positive changes in respecting the animals, and in finding better ways for humans to learn about/ admire these majestic creatures.",1424908800,14,1154,4.717821782178218

I dare anyone to view this entire film and say that having Orcas in captivity for our entertainment is okay. It is so, so, soooooo not okay. :-( I have to confess, the aquarium in BC they talk about in the beginning of the movie, I have been to many, many times as a kid, young adult and loved it. I could not wait to go there almost annually. I thought it was so cool to be right there ringside to see these magnificent creatures and even had a chance to touch them. Just oblivious to the truth, not wiling to see the full picture. Never trying to see life from their eyes.

5566033,1,B00BARKZ1G,"With a degrees in environmental policy and behavior, environmental education, it is easy to spot this ""documentary"" as propaganda.  It's claims are false, ill-researched, presented by ""experts"" who aren't qualified and makes leaps of faith not based on fact.  Anybody who watches this and then doesn't do their own independent research is lazy, dangerous and is not only doing themselves a disservice, but also the animals this film purports to care about.  Blindly following a one sided propaganda film can be dangerous guys, there are plenty of examples throughout history to support this.  Please look things up before you make a decision.

I do have to say that as propaganda it is very effective.  It causes a knee jerk reaction that always lands on the side of the filmmaker.  It shows what the uninformed believe to be experts making claims that the average watcher will never bother to verify.  Unfortunately, this leads to the masses basing their decisions on false and untrue claims.  Very unfortunate.  I guess though that the filmmakers did their job, they made their money regardless of the harm they may have caused.

One more thing.  After watching this and seeing the holes in it's arguments, the fact that CNN shows this repeatedly and claims it as a factual documentary is disheartening.  It is sloppy journalism that is misleading thousands. CNN should be ashamed -- very unfortunate.

If somebody truly cares about these animals, they should do more than post nasty comments about Sea World (who happens to rescue and rehabilitate hundreds, sometimes thousands of animals a year).  They should get up and clean up the beaches; They should donate to whale research; They should educate themselves on these whales and the true dangers that they face throughout the world.

Detractors have claimed the movie's interviewees are bitter employees who left years before practices and procedures were updated.  John Hargrove actually worked at SeaWorld and drank the Kool-Aid until 2012.  Other interviews in the documentary are also of senior trainers, whale experts, and witnesses to attacks.
To their credit, no one in the documentary blames Tilikum for the three people he has killed, the whale is bored, frustrated, and lonely in his tank, and still has that distant memory of being free, before he was captured at sea.

They have a great rescue program set in place, and many sea animals would not have survived if it wasn't for their rehab efforts. I think this movie has brought awareness to many, and I'm hoping more people start standing up for animal rights. I'm happy to hear that Sea World is making some positive changes with their company, and would eventually like to see them stop the animals performing all together.

Sea World hasn't captured orcas from the wild in over 30 years, while this documentary portrays it as if it is still a daily occurrence. The individuals commenting are not current employees and are therefore not privy to changes and enhancements made by the company. I fully agree the family units within the park should not be separated to the extent possible and that they deserve larger tanks (which is probably the only very positive outcome of this movie). But let's equate this to a different animal species and see how people feel. Are there not dog owners who maintain large dogs in small apartments that are taken from their mothers and sit home alone all day trapped? Are there not times when ""tame"" household dogs have been known to attack and kill because at the end of the day they are instinctual animals? Those of us who are not vegetarians, are animals not raised for the sole purpose of being killed for food and are all types of sea animals not hunted in the wild for food? I think having a handful of Orcas for public viewing as well as research is completely acceptable. The next time a complaint comes through about an Orca sitting in one spot for hours not moving in its tank, that person should look at their dog solemnly sitting in the corner unable to run freely in the wild because they have been captured and have an ""owner.""",1418083200,6,1427,4.556420233463035

5566072,5,B00BARKZ1G,"""Blackfish,"" is likely the best movie about the antics of SeaWorld and it's attempts to present itself as an educational tool to justify the capture and ""enslavement"" of what I believe to be one of the earth's 3 smartest species...maybe the smartest.  Certainly it's not balanced because it wasn't meant to be but neither was it dishonest about SeaWorld and the 'fake facts' they present to the public.
I had the privilege of working with Ken Balcomb in the summer of '91 and came to respect these creatures even more than I already had.  Even people want to teach/learn of these animals they should take a trip to Puget Sound and see orcas in their native habitat. And it probably will cost little more than a family trip to SeaWorld and be far more entertaining; plus there are so many other things to be seen.  In defense of SeaWorld on one point....they have developed a successful rehab program but they don't allow the public to see it except with exceptions like a school field trip.  Too bad but that's SeaWorld pretending to exist for research and not for money.",1417305600,2,1071,4.650793650793651

5566076,1,B00BARKZ1G,My mother wanted to see the movie. Though I told her there are two sides to the story and I refused to see this ugly and hateful side of a place we have both see more then once many years ago. She said alright and watched the movie with my father and after it she had me come up and wanted to know why I didn't want to see it. I told her everything I found on the internet and she nodded her head and asked me who's side I am on. The woman who made the movie or sea world for all the good they have done for the animal's. I told her Sea World's side since the woman who made this movie last year is still being hateful towards a company who is taking the very high road against this hateful and gross misunderstanding of everything Sea world has done.

5566081,5,B00BARKZ1G,"Everyone should watch this documentary. If you've ever visited an aquarium, ever thinking of it, or just because you're a human being. Because humans should not get to decide that highly intelligent animals should be wrenched from their family units and imprisoned in captivity. Sometimes being kept in a tank so small it's like us being kept in a bath tub! Being abused, having their food witheld if they don't perform, sometimes kept insolitairy confinement. How would you feel after 30 years of this treatment? And this is for our so-called ""entertainment""! Well, sorry, but it's not entertaining. It's not a fun, family day out to see these dolphins and orcas having to be treated like this. Humanity? It's inhumane. Makes me ashamed to be ""human"". It included honest and candid interviews with previous trainers at Seaworld, information from previous orca hunters-turned-protectors, and experts in these creatures.

I applaud the makers of Blackfish and everyone who contributed to spreading the word about such horrific, heartbreaking treatment purely and simply for greed and money.

Powerful, raw, and a must-see. This should be shouted far and wide. Empty the tanks, ban orca hunting and the horrific dolphin captures in Taiji, together we can do something now to give them their lives back. :'(",1416700800,2,1304,5.1753554502369665

5566085,1,B00BARKZ1G,"This is a so-called documentary but its so loaded with falsehoods from ex employees who left a long time ago and were looking for their 15 minutes of fame.  None of the information from the 3 most prominent voices was current as they had not been around for years and much of it was completely untrue in order to stir up controversy.  The director/producer definitely had an agenda and essentially geared the whole thing from snippets of comments from people who would say anything in order to get some financial gain out of their participation.  They understood that it was a smear piece and fabricated sensational stories to accommodate the agenda.  The three main people who were no longer employees ended up asking questions from SeaWorld employees in the guise of curiosity about the death of one of the trainers because they were so out of the loop about the park and the whales.  I watched this movie knowing much of the behind the scenes aspect to SeaWorld, the whales and their trainers and caretakers - what a load of crap that was told!

It is just this kind of agenda that has no place in the conversation about marine mammals.  This is from an animal activist perspective which only seeks to muddy the waters with fabrications, untruths and sensational nonsense to achieve the agenda of extreme activism that has no basis in facts or logic, no education or expertise from people who truly are the advocates and the people who actually get out there and help whales in the wild while trying to educate the public with real facts and real knowledge.

If you want to truly understand the real situation about killer whales in captivity and in the wild,  SeaWorld and its role in all this as well as the state of the ocean and its animals, do yourself a solid and read Killing Keiko by Mark Simmons.  This is a true account about Keiko based on the completely true experiences of someone who was actually working and training him to be in the wild.  This is a book that tells you the truth about this controversial subject based on reality, logic, and the facts from the perspective of someone who truly has the best interests in mind for killer whales and all of marine life without the agenda of the activist mindset and goal of taking peoples' money for doing nothing constructive to help the marine life and ocean world.

5566099,5,B00BARKZ1G,"This film is essential to watch. It illustrates the harsh reality of Orca whales that are living their lives in captivity. When Orca whales are taken into captivity it effects not only them, but their mothers that remain in the wild (Orca whales in the wild never leave their mother's side even as they are adults.), and it also effects the innocent and good intended trainers that are employed to work with the whales. Orca whales are also known as killer whales, but there is not a single report of them attacking humans in the wild, but orca whales in captivity have killed humans more than once. This documentary makes it clear of how wrong it is to keep these wonderful sea giants in captivity. They say that history is taught so that it doesn't repeat itself; I think the knowledge contained in this documentary should be spread to every one so that Orca whales are never again captured or put on display for profit, and innocent kids don't grow up with dreams to work with sea creatures and good intentions, then get killed when they finally reach their dreams, ever again.

Basically, they are the heroes/SeaWorld is the villain, even when they refer to events in which SeaWorld appears to have been the ""good guys.""  Do they really think that animals who had been raised in captivity would do better if just set free? Granted, the way orca calves were taken from the wild by various entities was cruel and stupid--and decades ago. Yes, SeaWorld has made a lot of mistakes, but maybe they are also contributing to research and education in an area where lots of money is necessary to get anything accomplished; how many grants has SeaWorld money paid for?

5566149,5,B00BARKZ1G,"This is the most powerful documentary film I have ever watched. Your life will change after watching this...your humanity will explode at the sheer obscene history of events leading up to the death of a beautiful young woman doing what she loved.
 I am grieving for the Orca's that were killed in the brutal captures. It will open your eyes and ears to the endless suffering these magnificent animals have endured at the hands of Sea World Parks and Entertainment. Not only have they been hiding the truth for Fifty Years they are still denying these slaves their freedom. They still are doing all they can to keep young and old females pregnant for life. The ticket sales are keeping them and their yet unborn offspring prisoners. The mortality rate for calf's is high, if they grow and survive they are forced for life.
 This film is so compelling, it has broken down the lies and propaganda and exposed the harsh cruelty we all grew up with, paying for and believing in Sea World. No more, the end of that dark industry  is in sight. As we humans evolve we will never allow this slavery to continue.
There are many options to Empty The Tanks and Retire the Orca's in captivity. There are many people and plans to help out.
 Lolita at Miami Florida SeaAquarium has been floating there in a tank for Forty Four Years!
 Thank You! Ms. Gabriela Cowperthwaite for showing true compassion and respect for these highly intelligent mammals. I am shocked and surprised at the cavalier arrogance of Sea World, to think we would tolerate the gross abuse they practice on these highly intelligent and emotional prisoners.
  From the horrible captures to the continued use of psychotropic drugs and forced impregnation you will be enthralled and moved by Blackfish. I am sorry the Motion Picture Academy did not award Oscars for this highly popular film. I am buying more copies to distribute to schools and teachers to make humane treatment of Orca's a priority for our youth. The Truth is Sea World is a For Profit Corporation on the stock exchange as SEAS ticker. The corporate executives are selling off toxic stocks and fleeing the Blackfish Effect.
  There is no respected research science and they are not producing anything of importance except paychecks and the occasional rescue of wounded turtles and manatees. The Orca's deserve their Freedom they earned it.
  Blackfish Movie delivers thought provoking conversation about our own humanity and how we treat all animals.",1409788800,,2471,4.859523809523809

5566204,5,B00BARKZ1G,"I watch documentaries every year, and once and a while I see a good one. Usually when I watch a documentary it never really makes me want to follow its cause or to think more into the subject. But then there are those few mesmerizing ones that stick into my head. When I watched 'Blackfish' I was stunned and outright horrified really. It changed what I thought about the subject, it really did. The raw footage and excellent interviews really sparked my interest in the subject.

'Blackfish' focuses on the consequences of keeping killer whales in captivity. In particular it focuses on the killer whale, Talikum, who killed three individuals while held in captivity.

'Blackfish' features a ton of interviews from former trainers, who all gave us their opinions on the events of capturing killer whales and turning them into attractions. They helped alot with moving along the documentary, really telling the story actually.

I liked the use of real footage of the events; it helped me get emotionally involved with this documentary, and really helped prove the trainer's points. Keeping killer whales in a habitat is not healthy, or safe for anybody, and it shows you can't be too careful either.

This film uses real events and really explores them. I liked how the topic was truly dissected and explored. The creators of this documentary knew what they were doing, and really put there two cents into their opinions and what came out was a film that not only is entertaining, to say the least, but also informative. The film is compelling, shocking, and just attention grabbing.

All in All, 'Blackfish' is a winner. The film explores the topic, and pushes its message so far that you think you're going to collapse, but you don't because what you're watching is real footage, and with the help of the real trainer's narrating the film, it really makes you think about the topic, in a powerful way. In that this film is a success story. 1/6/14",1404691200,2,1948,4.802985074626866

Is there no justice in this world?
I was shocked to see how much these animals suffer.  In the wild the timid ones could get away from the aggressive whales.  They are helpless & trapped in the pool at Sea World.

5566236,4,B00BARKZ1G,"This is an eye-opening, saddening account of the plight of orcas kept in captivity primarily to serve as circus-like performers in various marine worlds. These creatures are made to suffer merely to supply us with casual entertainment.

This documentary does a good job of waking us up to the pointless cruelty were inflicting, and the waste of life entailed. Some of the commentators on the film are former marine world trainers who quit their jobs in order to be free to speak out publicly against the abuses they now regret being party to.

However, the film could have been even better. Its a little disjointed, recounting cases here/there, then/now, in which both humans and orcas have been injured or killed as a result of the animals unnatural confinement.

Then it misses a few chances to give viewers further insights into the nature of these black fish. The writers could have included some more of the kinds of details that I learned when I went whale-watching off the coast of Vancouver. For example, this documentary doesnt explain that orcas aren't really whales at all  killer or otherwise. They are actually dolphins whose current name might have been an early transposition of the term whale killer.

Also, this documentary states that orcas have never been known to kill humans in the wild. According to the whale-watching boat captains, thats true  but not for this documentarys implied reason that orcas might find some intellectual sympathy with humans and recognize us as kindred spirits. Rather the boating captains believed there were no attacks in the wild because humans are simply viewed as being relatively bony slim pickings for the orcas when they have larger prey available. The whale-watching crew said that one of a wild orcas favorite repasts would be a moose.

This conjured an eerie picture in my mind. I imagined an orca slithering out of its natural watery medium, through the Canadian forests at night, sneaking up on unsuspecting ungulates. How could that happen? But no, the crew member explained that moose like to swim between the many islands off the coasts of Vancouver and Seattle  and the orcas pick them off then.

Despite the fact that Black Fish could have included more such choice details and been a little better organized, it remains a brave and awakening must-see documentary.",1399680000,,2331,4.987113402061856
5566237,5,B00BARKZ1G,So informative. Makes you think about the killer whales and how unfair their lives are living in captivity. It is amazing what these animals go through and still live.,1399680000,,167,4.793103448275862
5566238,2,B00BARKZ1G,"The basic premise of Blackfish is that orcas have been torn apart from their families in the wild and driven to a pattern of psychotic behavior and violence by waterparks that then ignore and deflect any responsibility for the deaths that result. The film interviews incident eyewitnesses, scientists and former SeaWorld trainers to build a seemingly compelling case that this is a gross, decades-long case of animal cruelty that ignores animal rights, human safety and puts profit and entertainment before common sense.

This is a beautifully-shot documentary but my BS-detector started going into overdrive fairly quickly as it makes a series of faulty logic jumps that form the foundation of what is obviously more of a character assassination of SeaWorld than any real attempt to portray a balanced view. A supposed neuroscientist is presented early in the show who makes a slew of very unscientific statements along of the lines of 'finding parts of the animal's brain having emotions that human don't even have', which I'm pretty sure sit straight in the middle of the Venn diagram of unscientific and unprovable. Next up they find two eye-witnesses to an early trainer attack who are apparently are the only ones who can ID Tilicum in an orca lineup from 30 years ago, despite investigatory reports being unable to find the instigating orca. Then they accuse SeaWorld of starving the animals, deliberately using a known psychopathic orca, covering up video evidence and effectively running a complex ""tricks for food"" racket.

Far from claiming to be an expert on SeaWorld's operations, I decided to ask a friend of mine who was a trainer at SeaWorld San Antonio for several years. Many of her comments aren't consistent with the portrayed attitude or approach of the water park in the movie, and then when I started digging around on the Internet I find some of the film's own participants expressing outrage at the way their interviews were presented. SeaWorld has a rebuttal site and there are a range of former trainer video on YouTube that are also worth viewing to see their reactions if you're interested in both sides of the story.

Regardless of what you think about the captivity of killer whales - and I'm pretty sure that in 50 years they won't be held in tanks - the contents of this documentary are so one-sided to be ridiculous. As an emotional pull of the heart-strings utilizing clever editing and a carefully constructed narrative it's highly effective but putting aside the emotional elements it doesn't stand up to much scrutiny. And no, I'm not an employee of SeaWorld - I just like some balance in my documentaries. Jeff Beal's music score was great, by the way.",1399420800,14,2691,4.949115044247788

5566248,5,B00BARKZ1G,"BLACKFISH tells the story of Tilkum, a killer whale bred in captivity, who ended up taking the lives of several people, most recently trainer Dawn Brancheau.  Many reviewers have already commented on the ways in which director Gabriela Cowperthwaite uses the documentary to comment on the ways in which Seaworld exploits the killer whales for financial gain, while claiming to treat them humanely.  What perhaps emerges most tangibly from her narrative is the limitations of human understanding surrounding these creatures; they are either perceived as friendly, cuddly creatures or as killer predators.  Little attempt has been made to try and construct alternative behavioral models that take into account the fact that killer whales are highly intelligent creatures who think and react in certain ways in the wild.  While the documentary includes several interviews with experts in whale behavior, it seems that they are lone voices: many of the former Seaworld trainers - who provide evidence of the ways in which captive whales were treated - come across as well-meaning yet basically ignorant.  They were perfectly content to parrot Seaworld's official propaganda to incredulous audiences, but spent little time or energy trying to discover things for themselves.  In that sense BLACKFISH comes across as a cautionary tale of how capitalism constructs false dreams that often prove so convincing that no one bothers to try and challenge them.  As a result, it is the killer whales that suffer.  The fact that such creatures strike back is seldom due to the fact that they are ""angry"" or ""resentful"" of their trainers, but rather borne out of frustration with a life in which they absolutely no power of self-determination.  BLACKFISH is an angry documentary, but is no less compelling for being so.",1398729600,,1804,5.236111111111111

I am surprised they will even perform for us.  They probably do it in order to be fed and survive.

I don't think this film is propaganda -- if it was, it would be very, very pro-whale and not even have SeaWorld trainers talking.  The trainers obviously cared and loved these animals and it was repeatedly shown throughout the film that they regret their decisions with how they handled the whales, but none of the trainers deliberately wanted to harm these whales.  Unfortunately, you can't make a wild animal happy in captivity -- they are NOT raised to live with us.  And any animal that wasn't born to live with us is going to be hard to handle and raise issues mentioned in this documentary.

All in all, for those who still support SeaWorld, if you love something, sometimes it means giving up what you want.  SeaWorld can still run, but they should stop showcasing whales and dolphins.  There are too many scientific facts proving the emotional harm caused in a captive animal more than there are facts showing a whale is content. Why go against the majority fact that's based on a living creature's emotions?

5566298,5,B00BARKZ1G,"I just finished watching Blackfish. God, where do I start?
Firstly, I'd like to say that the director has tried to maintain as unbiased a position as possible and has kept the focus on the whales, such as Tilikum, rather than specific people to blame. Of course, all documentaries have some biasses, but the director has obviously tried to just state the facts, not hearsay, which in this case (as touchy a topic as this) is probably for the best.
Secondly, I believe that Blackfish showcases what captivity (not just SeaWorld) can do to ANY sentient being's sanity, and I believe we are dealing with ticking time bombs until such time as animal exploitation and entertainment is banned from the public. These whales/dolphins (any animal if you want me to cover everything) should not be made to perform for food or praise, or out of fear - animal entertainment should be a thing of the past. We look back at old circus images (even Dumbo) and cringe at the way things were done (and in some instances are STILL done today); what ARE we going to think of ourselves in the next 50-100 years? We are an evil species, and sometimes it takes the actions of a few animals to bring that into light. I think that we've got to stop dominating the creatures of our planet. If we are supposedly the rulers of this planet kingdom, shouldn't it therefore be our duty to rule it justly, mercifully and peacefully?
Lastly, please watch this documentary. It was exciting, informative and horrific. You could see the love the ex-trainers had for their whales. Don't blame the workers, blame the institution.
I personally DON'T want SeaWorld in it's entirety to shut down. I believe that CHANGE needs to happen (sooner rather than later). I'm sure SeaWorld can come up with other attractions that do not focus on Live attractions, and use their research into marine life to help protect, save, rescue and rehabilitate said wildlife, then release it back into the wild. Surely THAT sort of press coverage is better than the backlash they are receiving at the moment. Wake up SeaWorld, Wake up WORLD...",1395964800,,2083,4.741046831955923
5566299,5,B00BARKZ1G,"Excellent and insightful movie.  I always assumed that all of the animals in captivity were previous rescues who couldn't be released back into the wild.  To learn that some of these animals were captured for the sake of entertainment was very disheartening and I realize very naive of me to believe so for all of these years.  I have always loved theme parks but after learning what some animals go through for our entertainment and corporations to make a buck, I just feel shame for having supported this for all of these years.  I hope that more people get the opportunity to watch this video and decide for themselves what is an acceptable form of entertainment.  We could never substitute in a giant pool/enclosure the awesomeness that these animals have been taken from in the wild.",1395964800,,788,4.764705882352941
5566300,3,B00BARKZ1G,"Particularly amusing in this documentary was when the liberals, as they were rightly exposing corporate fraud with rather obvious facts, had to make the distinction that one of the reasons the industry was disastrous was because incoming whales being ripped away from their homes in fact had their own nationality, ""genes"", and language, and thus arbitrarily throwing these different genes and nations together created hostility between the whales. VERY amusing that liberals, who's sole mission in life is the destruction of human nationality, race, and even sex, and who actively encourage the flooding of formerly white dominant countries with all sorts of human types, in their anthropomorphizing do the exact opposite thing to 'save the whale'.

The whales should be free, of course. Bourgeois liberal man is vulgar, of course, and now apparently even vulgar to himself, so he anthropomorphizes. This pseudo-documentary could have been 30 minutes long. All I really wanted to know about was the whales, not the smarmy, emoting, do-gooder sentimentality of white-liberals from the Coast.

The whales, with their enormous brains, were locked in a pool for 25 years or more. Certainly that builds rage. But what about us?To be sure, Rage defines the contemporary human. School, work, and then what? I know a girl who 'runs' for fun, its what she does in her 'free-time'. I wonder how strange the idea of running incredible distances for fun would seem to our ancestors?

5566311,5,B00BARKZ1G,"I have this movie, I have read all the reviews from it, & I'm so disappointed that people say this movie was *Propaganda pushed* The only thing being pushed through this movie is education. To not take everything at face value. If you want to know something go and find out for yourself. Which is exactly what the documentarian  did, she went out and sought out the information which surprise surprise can be found everywhere. SeaWorld first off would be alot better off NOT serving alcohol, I'm sorry but how can you say this place is educational and family oriented when you are giving out complimentary beer?

2) I love how people are saying that SeaWorld helps thousands of animals. They only help out the ones who do not bring in high revenue to their park.

3)The difference between zoos and this place. a) You go to a zoo/safari and what do you see (depending on the place & location) You see bears, lions and tigers who lay around, aren't forced to do anything, and actually have a an environment much like the one they came from, and alot of them have so much room to.  b) No alcohol is served or allowed on the premises due to the fact that intoxicated people around children and animals can be dangerous. The parks know this, its why its not allowed. c) Zoos & Safaris DO NOT JUST HIRE ANYONE! They hire people with degrees to work with these animals. Notice none of these people look like attractive supermodels, but look like everyday citizens. Just like you and me. D) The people who work in Zoo's/Safari's are more than happy to answer questions, and will guide you to the proper books/ internet sites to know more about the topic of discussion. Even Veterinarians that I know would rather take their kids to a zoo or safari than rather watch them hop out of a tank for a scarp piece of fish.

Point being is Captivity is not right in anyway, but when animals are bought and mistreated, they are sent to those facilities for better care of life. Zoo's & Safari's spend so much money yearly on fixing things up and making sure that their animals are taken care of. SeaWorld makes Billions BILLIONS of Dollars, and I don't believe they've actually expanded. Let alone provide better water quality for their sea inhabitants. I believe this Movie inspired me more to educate myself on how corporations work when caring for animals. This movie is about education, not lets hate the world. No we will leave that Disney, & Other mindless programs that do not enforce education. Like this movie or not, all I ask is that you do your research, educate yourself, & then ask yourself *What do I do from here* Cause thats all that matters in the end.

5566333,4,B00BARKZ1G,"Initially I discovered this documentary film from watching a teaser trailer on YouTube and after seeing it in the theater, I knew I had to get the DVD.  Blackfish explores what has become a very sensitive and controversial issue of keeping wild animals in captivity.  Director Gabriela Cowperthwaite sets her sights on SeaWorld with the main emphasis on dissecting the psychological impact that is endured by Orcas in extremely tumultuous circumstances.  Ultimately, the years of emotional and physical torment conspire to create incredibly dangerous and deadly outcomes for the trainers who routinely interact with them.  Beneath the awe-inspiring spectacle of exhilarating stunts and the inspirationally uplifting grandeur of crowd pleasing shows such as, Believe there is a dark and morbidly disturbing variable within this equation: virtually all whales in captivity are horribly traumatized and the trainers who work with them are playing a precarious game of Russian roulette that has the potential to turn fatal in the blink of an eye.
Blackfish exposes the dark truth behind the illusion that is SeaWorlds main attraction and the terrifying implications that human and animal interactions have when the show goes horribly wrong.  The defining message behind this film is that for all our expertise and abilities, man cannot attempt to tame goliath.  If you're curious about what really goes on behind the scenes at SeaWorld or are studying killer whales in captivity, then Blackfish is a must have DVD.",1395014400,3,1510,5.350210970464135

5566335,4,B00BARKZ1G,"I found this documentary very thought provoking. It was well planned and executed, but left me with questions. A lot of the information seemed dated and I wondered, in light of the events documented, has Sea World changed their operations other than not allowing trainers to perform in water with the Orcas. And was it primarily only Titicum who was aggressive and hurt people. I liked that this issue is being brought to light and attention. I saw the follow up commentary by another former, but supposedly more recently employed, trainer. His commentary brought up some of the issues that I also wondered about, but actually added little information or clarification. His comments that Sea World is providing the best environment possible for the Orcas is vague. I can identify with his statements that several of these animals have been born and lived their lives in captivity. In that instance, it would be irresponsible to turn them back to the wild. But his justification that they would be endangered by allowing them into larger open sea pools is lame. Their pools and diets etc could slowly be changed over to sea water environment and then allow them into sea pools to allow their systems to acclimate. They are not the same as research animal populations(such as mice, rats) that are developed with specific criteria and in an entirely controlled environment. Those animals WOULD die if let out of their respective environments because their immune systems, digestive systems, etc have been conditioned and/or out right altered such that such a change would overwhelm their ability to develop resistance and accomadation to the new circumstance and exposure to new organisms. As you can see, this documentary has captured my attention, and therefore has accomplished what was designed to do. Kudos",1394928000,,1808,5.070469798657718

5566340,5,B00BARKZ1G,This movie was excellent and informative.  I did not know how smart caring and sensitive whales were.  I did not know how poorly they were being treated.  I would not want to see them at Sea World knowing the truth.  All Gods creatures should be treated with love and respect. I am in awe of this animal. Thanks for making this film.  So sorry for those trainers who lost their lives to bring these great animals to the masses.,1394755200,,427,4.3544303797468356
5566341,4,B00BARKZ1G,This is a really good documentary.  It really shows the truth about how these poor whales are being treated.  It really doesn't seem right that we lock these poor animals up in small tanks for most of their lives.  They really should be free.  Really opens up your eyes about SeaWorld.. and I won't be supporting parks like this anymore.,1394668800,2,337,4.566666666666666
5566342,4,B00BARKZ1G,"This film does a good job of illuminating the conditions that entertainment whales live in. It also does a great job of showing the horrible way that whales are captured. One of the trainers made an excellent point that if there were a dog that killed someone, that dog would be put down. Instead, with Tillicum, he is kept in captivity for his semen, and now almost all the whales at Sea World are his offspring. Propagating the genes of a psychologically unstable and aggressive animal seems like the worst possible way to manage a population. But this is the point, right? Sea World managers don't care about anything other than profit.

I found it to be quite a disheartening film because as a child, I went to Sea World once and just loved it. It's hard to reconcile the joy of that event with the brutality of what life is really like for the animals and the trainers once the audience is not there.",1394668800,2,905,4.484848484848484

5566345,5,B00BARKZ1G,this was an amazing insight to how it really is for the animals kept in captivity. Its so sad and I would hope that many people will watch this and become aware of what their money really is funding when they go to animal parks.

I don't support PETA, never had, never will. I'm not an ""extremist activist."" Activist, yes, now, but not an extremist by whatever means Seaworld defines the word. I honestly do hope that all marine parks go out of business. Businesses rehabilitating injured marine wildlife are not parks. They're vets for fish and mammals and birds that live in and around the water. Wanna see whales and dolphins? Take a wildlife cruise. Can't afford that? I can't at the moment. Open a book.

Having seen them in the waters of Alaska it was hard to watch this video and imagine how trapped and frustrated these poor animals must be.  It's no wonder they attack their ""trainers"" which truly are their tormentors.  Not intentionally because it's clear from those interviewed that they love these animals but all of us should be loving them in their natural habitat.

Think of the family pet.  If it was kept locked in a cage except to come out and perform for visitors, how many owners do you think would be bitten or killed by the family dog?  The whales are much larger but their need to be free to swim and play with the members of their pods are just as important as the exercise and freedom of the family dog.",1394668800,,805,4.405405405405405

5566349,4,B00BARKZ1G,"This movie offers an excellent overview of the life of whales in amusement parks and the understandable conflicts that arise.  The trainers have such huge love and respect for them, but the management sees them only as a means to make money.  Parks will do anything to keep these gentle giants, and this is  cruel punishment for a creature that is designed to travel hundreds of miles a day in the planet's oceans.  Those in close contact with these incredible beings have long felt that it is not right to keep them in captivity at an amusement park.  It's wrong, and it doesn't matter if people are entertained and kids have access to something they many never experience any other way.  The fact is, it's a totally warped presentation and should not be continued.  Whales should not be used to provide a false view of the world.  No one can blame them for breaking out and taking a trainer with them once in awhile; they've been forced to live in a crazy world, and they probably want to help those they love escape too.",1394582400,,1023,4.521739130434782
5566350,5,B00BARKZ1G,"This is one of the best documentaries I've seen on mammals. At first I thought it would be hard to watch (like other true-to-life documentaries that involve torture of animals or people), but that was NOT the case at all. I can see why thousands of fans called it intelligent and thrilling but modest at the same time. The film shows you plenty of evidence of the injured orcas, injured trainers, and the despicable conditions of how the orcas are ""stored"" in captivity, but it does so with restraint so that you can easily share this film with students of all ages. I felt very sad for the orcas and completely activated to join organizations and causes on this issue, BUT I was not depressed afterward.

THIS is also an excellent film for developing critical thinking exercises. If you're interested, here are a few questions you can use with your students after you've shown the film in class. My students were riveted and engaged. They had A LOT to say on this topic and it led to an easy writing exercise.

Critical Thinking Questions for Students:
1) What is the difference in characterization of orcas? Compare what Sea World says to what the trainers have said.
2) What is the nature of corporations and how does this nature affect media coverage? Consider how Sea World handled the news releases of Dawn's death and how the corporation might have been affected by profit, by publicity, etc. Consider the change in response by Sea World weeks then months after the release of the film then the airing of the film on CNN. How did their tactics change?
3) Are some traditions worth changing? When and on what basis is it the right time to change the nature of ""animal entertainment"" in the U.S. and around the world?
4) How have people's view of animals changed over time? Have we become more ""humane"" and ""intelligent"" in our use of scientific information to better understand the animals? Is it a matter of common sense?
5) What kinds of laws should we have in society to regulate the marine mammal entertainment industry?
6) Is Sea World too big to fail? (compare the question to the one about big banks being too big to fail)
7) How does our behavior toward animals affect our understanding of ourselves?
8) What is the impact of myths about animals? How are children affected by the narratives they hear of ""happy"" orcas at Sea World? How does the narrative shift? What impact will the shifting narrative have on individuals and on society?
9) Why is there a revolution against keeping orcas in captivity? And why now? There have been other films in the past, like Free Willy, and Lolita: Slave to Entertainment. What's different about Blackfish or is it a matter of critical mass or the right timing?
10) How did Blackfish and CNN work together to create such a buzz about captive orcas? What crucial factors helped make the transition from an interesting documentary to a film with a lot of attention and media buzz (especially social media)?

Best of luck! My students enjoyed this film very much! They'll never forget it. Me, too.",1394496000,,3045,4.68785046728972

5566352,5,B00BARKZ1G,"I loved this documentary that is currently sweeping our nation. I am slightly annoyed ( at myself grumble grumble) for buying this movie when I could have seen it for free on Netflix or waited to watch it on TV. Never the less that is my own fault and at least I have this movie in my collection now. However like most documentaries I don't really want to watch it more than once. I came, I saw, I became aware of this awful travesty, I cried I........signed a petition to support the ban on Sea world's lives shows and that's the extent of what I can do from my home up here in Oregon.

This documentary is excellent it covers how our knowledge of Orca's has grown over the last 30 years but we still know hardly anything about these intelligent giants. I was pleasantly surprised by this documentary I had not heardmuch on what this movie focused on. I mean yeah I knew it was about Orca's but I thought it was going to be a captivating depressing behind the scene's expose showing the whales being beaten by Sea World employee's and starved. I did not know that the focus is really on the mental abuse these animals are suffering. Being kidnapped from their families and forced into tiny ( in perspective to their natural habitat, the huge vast ocean) tanks with  members of other pods of whales. None of the other whales speak the same language every pod has it's on distinct language or dialect if you will. So these beautiful socially driven creatures are kidnapped forced into a small living space with two strangers it couldn't talk to even if it wanted too. The rest of the movie goes on to document in detail the type of horrific accidents and attacks not only on trainers but on other whales as well. The part I truly enjoyed is the testimony's given by SEVERAL former Whale trainers employed by Sea World as well as the back dated footage from those trainers themselves when they still performed.

While a few tears my be shed at the beginning ( no spoilers I promise) if you are thinking of shying away from watching this documentary because you can't stand to watch  animals suffer( like those soul shattering ASPCA Sarah Mclachlan commercials. Tears!) fear not! There is very little of that. This documentary is very informative and by the end of it you feel so angry at Sea World you vow to never give them another dime and go search for a BOYCOTT SEA WORLD Facebook page, by the by there are several : ). It's definitely a movie worth watching .",1394496000,,2462,4.476614699331849

Sorry I am not influenced to hate Sea World. If you want to free Orca how about the rest of the animals? I am pretty sure all of them are in bad shape tortured, all of them in a small cubes right? Sea World is a business so as the film. I just gave my money to the producer of this film by watching it same thing with Sea World gave more money.

This documentary really showed how obtaining these animals started, what they are trained to do and different situation where Sea World withheld information, amongst other things. I really liked the documentary. However, I think it was made to make you feel a certain way since there was no one ""for"" the idea of keeping Orcas captive. I personally feel a certain way about animals that are in captivity and taught tricks for shows, this documentary just strengthened my personal feelings. To say this documentary geared more towards one way would be appropriate. It does appear to be slightly biased. The only thing I wish would have been added to the documentary was more present day. How do the trainers feel now since OSHA and Sea World regulations have changed? How do new trainers coming in to Sea World react to Tilikum? etc. Overall a good documentary and I have recommended Blackfish to my friends.",1394323200,,1067,4.836065573770492

I strongly believe that captivity will never be sufficient to an animals natural habitat.  I do have little sympathy for rescuing injured or endangered animals, but in the case of SeaWorld it is all about the money; money brings out the worse in some people/corporations.  After the movie, I did perform a little google research on 'truth or fiction of blackfish' and the fictional viewpoints caught my attention too.  For example, the Bridgette Pirtle website ""micechat"" about how misleading and out of context some of her interviews were used in the movie/director.  The problem is that I will never know the real truth.  I don't care that SeaWorld gives back to the community.  Are they giving back to silence their wrongdoings? Does this giving back gain them credit in the courtroom?  I just don't know.  Anyway ranting, my quick pro/cons below

Pros: The point of the movie was to make you sad- success! Did not lose interest and educational regarding Orcas which they are fascinating, smart, caring, and kind mammals. I agree they belong in their pods and in the wild.  Also, it is amazing that Orcas spend their whole life with their pod/family. This makes me never want to visit SeaWorld.

Cons:  The director did not provide any well educated and rounded information on SeaWorld.  Purely, SeaWorld and all connections are evil.",1394064000,,1456,4.938271604938271

Sea world is just another hierchy corporation with different people at different positions sucxing the dxcks of people above them. Unlike other companies, sea world is an unnecessary one.

I have seen other exposs by concerned environmentalists or activists.  Too often, the creators of such documentaries let their passion for the caused at hand overwhelm their technical good sense and what could have been an effective presentation falls far short.,

Happily, this was not the case in this instance. My wife had done extensive delving into this story on the web and brought out some interesting facts about this documentary which explained why it was focused as it was and what its purpose was. Any person who has concerns about how animals in captivity would definitely get the message that places like Sea World should not be considered as completely innocent animal shows.  Although this story was mainly focused on one orca - Tilikum - what was presented was enough to make a general case that these types of shows are exploitive of these magnificent creatures.

The comments by former trainer/employees of Sea World were enough to make the case that this form of ""entertainment"" has nothing to do with conservation or improving the environment.  What it is is abuse of one intelligent species by another. I would make the equivalence to what is done to orcas at places like Sea World to chattel slavery.

My wife and I were pleased by the fact that this documentary did not attempt to be too graphic. That would have been overkill and probably would have distorted the message that I think the creaotr was trying to make.  It is a work which speaks for itself and allows the viewer to come to their own conclusion. It makes the case against captivity of these magnificent creaters without beating the viewer over the head with it.

There were a few lines in the documentary about the orcas having ""great spiritual power"" and further developed emotional lives than humans that seemed to me to be a bit much and unnecessary but other than that I completely support this documentary and I hope it moves people to stand up against the animal abuse and fight for a better quality of living for the orcas.

  Alot of research has been done over the years on Orcas and scientists have come to realize that Orcas are mentally, emotionally, and physically harmed by being kept in captivity and in close contact with humans.  The film covers this info and it also gives eye-witness testimonies of former SeaWorld trainers and people who actually caught some of the first Orcas .  They have a hard time living with themselves, regretting that they ever had any part of this.

Research shows that Orcas will become violent towards humans and each other if you take them out of their natural home, the ocean, and separate them from their original family. Greedy humans are to blame for the injuries and deaths that have occurred involving Orcas.

  These beautiful, intelligent creatures are tortured every day of their lives all for the sake of ""entertainment"" , enabling SeaWorld to rake in the big bucks.  It's disgusting and immoral.

5566423,4,B00BARKZ1G,"Blackfish (Gabriela Cowperthwaite, 2013)

It will be no surprise to anyone who has seen Blackfish, the terrifying, heartbreaking documentary about Tilikum, the psychotic orca, that Sea World have been cranking out anti-Blackfish spin since the movie opened. The film, Sea World (who were offered that chance repeatedly, a title card at the end tells us, to go on camera and offer an alternate version of the story, but always declined) reports, is inaccurate and biased [...]. Funny how they say that now rather than having tried to set the record straight on level ground. I don't know about you, but watching Sea World attempt to defend their actions after the documentary was released looks a lot like those authors who go and attack reviews on Amazon and end up getting lampooned around the Internet [...]. None of which, of course, has to do with Blackfish itself, saving adding some amusing meta when you're watching the thing.

The film traces the life in captivity of Tilikum, an orca who was captured in the late eighties for Sealand, a small park in British Columbia, and wasn't right from the start; while the movie starts off highlighting the big story that started it all (Tilikum killed Sea World senior trainer Dawn Brancheau in 2010), we find out that's not the first time he'd killed a person. And after the first death, which happened there, Sea World bought him. Under the condition, one interviewee notes, that he never be used in performances again; he was supposed to be a breeding whale and that was it. Sea World had other ideas.

While the movie does focus on Tilikum, as it should, it does branch out to advance the hypothesis, and back it up with at least enough evidence to suggest a lot more research is necessary, that keeping orcas in captivity, at least the way Sea World does it, may be at the root of Tilikum's problems; they touch on the family structure of the orca, though they don't go into great detail (and one of the movie's lasting side effects, as far as I'm concerned, should be a burning desire in all who see it to find out a lot more about the social lives of orcas, which one scientist hypothesizes are more advanced than the social lives of any other creature on the planet). They do give us enough to make us understand that Sea World's policy of separating family groups and frequently moving the animals from park to park is probably a good deal of what's to blame not only for Tilikum's problems, but the problems of many captive orcas. (I obviously can't say from Sea World's perspective, but when I worked in retail management in the early nineties, the company I worked fornow defunct, and its parent company has been on the rocks for about a decade nowtreated managers the same way Sea World treats orcas. Their rationalization was that they believed store managers should not stay in one place too long so that they did not build up histories with customers. As I said, I don't know if that's Sea World's rationale, but that's what I was thinking of during that part of the movie.) It's chilling stuff.

Not to say this is a perfect film. It is nakedly manipulative, and the filmmakers obviously cherry-picked interviews and pieces of interviews. There are also some bits that seemed, well, gratuitous. (You already told us Tilikum was bought as a breeding animal, did you have to show us the scene of two trainers, um, harvesting his sperm? Really?) But it pulls no punches, it is thought-provoking, it at least attempts to present both sides of the story (and attempted to go farther in that regard, but Sea World would not cooperate), and it asks even more questions than it says it's going to ask. All of these things are hallmarks of a well-made and worth-watching documentary. Worth checking out. *** ",1392508800,,3765,4.71580547112462
5566424,5,B00BARKZ1G,"According to director and co-writer Gabriela Cowperthwaite, she didn't start out to make a documentary about the treatment of killer whales.  She began an investigation surrounding the death of one of Sea World Orlando's veteran trainers, Dawn Brancheau.  Brancheau was killed by a crazed orca called Tilikum in 2011, but the details were sketchy and allusive.  As Cowperthwaite initiated contact with Sea World officials, she was continually put off.  As a result, there is no official rebuttal to the facts raised in the documentary.

There was also a lawsuit against Sea World initiated by the federal government (OSHA) regarding employee safety being compromised.  The film features interviews with numerous former whale trainers at Sea World as well as those from a Canadian park where Tilikum was originally housed.  There is additional footage, some archival but mostly civilian home movies.  Tilikum had a history of endangering trainers beginning in Canada.

Rather than demonizing Tilikum or other whales, the film suggest/insists the behavior should not be a surprise given the conditions in which the animals live.  This is an emotionally draining film to watch, but it does what good documentaries do, raise the awareness and dare I say, ire, of the viewer.  Like many people, I've visited Sea World on several occasions.  Never again.",1392422400,,1348,5.306603773584905

It can be very shocking to those who have little of no marine research experience or business experience so brace yourself. The film probably will destroy your enjoyment of a marine land theme park.  As a parent, science guy, and business guy I think I need the other point of view along with Blackfish to form a reasonable opinion.  As for my family, they do not like marine theme parks anymore regardless of whether it is an aquarium, or a killer whale... what a shame and loss for me as a fisheries biologist and promoter of proper use of a resource and promoting better stewardship.

These whales (actually they are considered part of the Dolphin Family) are captured and put into in adequate tanks and made to be trained to do tricks, etc.  Blackfish takes you into a world that no one has ever known or seen behind closed doors before until now.

How could you take a child to a show and have them witness the brutal killing of a trainer but these massive giant's that are non threatening in the wild to a human.  Please take some time and watch this, it is a very moving DVD and will have you rethink what we as humans are doing to these beautiful creatures that seriously belong in the wild.  Yes, you can capture a wild animal be it land or sea and train them to do what you want them to do.

5566443,5,B00BARKZ1G,"Obviously I understand that this is a one sided documentary. SeaWorld does work hard to save marine animals in need and get them rehabilitated. Also, I know it is important to do research on marine animals. But that is where I draw the line. How is making these animals perform mindless tricks over and over again for a huge crowd ""educational""? It is not. There animals do not strive in capativity, they die. Life spans in the wild for females can be 100 years and males 50-60 years. In captivity they live maybe 30-35 years. Also, their dorsal fins are drooped. This happens 1% in the wild and 100% time in captivity. The most disturbing parts of this documentary were first these whales were literally stolen from their environments and taken away from their families. Then once in captivity they are forced to reproduce and then many times have their babies taken away. What if you take away a baby from a human mother? Researchers have learned these whales feel even deeper then humans and living with their pods is essential. Babies live with their mothers their whole life. Each pod has a unique language. How would you feel if you were put in a small room with people from all different countries that did not speak the same language as you. Your life would not be fulfilling and you would obviously be very frustrated and depressed.",1392076800,2,1341,4.662447257383966

It was pretty eye opening.  I'm not condemning all zoos or parks, some of them do take proper care of their animals, and it is nice to see animals you may not otherwise be able to see.  However, there are some animals who captivity just isn't humane...orcas, dolphins, wales and other large marine creatures are prime cases.  Just as certain wildlife are not meant to be tamed or to be pets. It's sad because I really did think that Sea World was a place where they rehabilitated animals and then released them or just kept ones who were injured and could not be re-released.  The fact to that Tilicum was used to breed, their inhumane and unnatural breeding practices, and the fact that calves are separated from their mothers instead of the whole family being moved or kept together is not only sad, but seems overtly cruel.  Yes, I realize there might be some bias here as critics would suggest but not overtly so. I think it was a well-done film and pretty balanced.  But beware when you watch it --- it might stoke feelings you weren't sure you had. There were parts that made me quite angry, including Sea World's glossing over problems and then throwing their dead trainers under the bus, basically saying the attacks were a result of some kind of error on their part. These were loyal employees who gave their life for their animals and job and then were spit on by the company after their death to some how save face - revolting.

It was news to me how social these creatures are and what a disruption it is to the orca social structure when their calves are literally ripped away from them. The interviews from previous trainers of Sea World was an eye opener also, on the cruelty on these animals in captivity. Tillikum, the featured whale of the story, is shown how it was in a poor condition before he was bought by Sea World and used primarily for breeding purposes. Perhaps the techniques work for cows, but orcas are not cows. Admiditly, the movie can play on the heart strings, and equate orca captivity to human slavery.

5566464,5,B00BARKZ1G,"This documentary attempts and succeeds to explain the Orca/trainer ""accidents"" at Seaworld which were so awkwardly fumbled over by Seaworld officials.

If you have a heart or a soul this will disturb you. If you have any sort of a conscience this documentary will bring you close to tears. Blackfish gives a voice the beautiful and highly intelligent long suffering captive Orcas. Seaworld has callously ruined their lives, holding them prisoner in bath tub sized tanks for the duration of their lives, which are cut in half, by this act of cruelty. In addition they separate families, babies from grieving mothers. These families are inseparable in the wild, staying together their whole lives.

 I did buy an annual pass to Seaworld SanDiego about 20 years ago before hearing any controversy. My immediate reaction entering the gates was that the tanks the Orcas were kept in were much too small. I felt claustrophobic for them. I recall asking an employee why their fins were bent. They replied that it was normal. I remember feeling uneasy and though completely awestruck by these magnificent creatures, I did not buy another pass. It has been in the back of my mind and surfaces when hearing about ""accidents"" at the park involving trainers. You don't have to be a marine biologist to know this captivity in small holding tanks is totally unnatural, a therapist to know this is emotionally abusive or a lawyer to know this is criminal or that Seaworld officials lie through their gold capped teeth.

 It is a highly profitable industry at the extreme expense of these awesome and sensitive creatures. Everyone should see this important documentary that finally gives Tilly and the other captive Orcas a voice.",1391472000,2,1714,4.979020979020979

What you will learn, the animals are not as ""happy to perform"" as Seaworld would lead you to believe, the whales were originally captured to perform in still to this day too small spaces to live, there are more accidents that happened then they want people to find out about, the animals are separated from parents out of convenience to corporations need for animals to be at specific facilities-causing mental/emotional as well as physical damage to animal.  Many animals damage each other and have gone after trainers out of frustration from being in small spaces with little to do most of the time. Its an unnatural state for  highly intelligent creatures meant to have miles and miles space to conduct themselves and communicate in. You will also see how indoctrinated the trainers are into believing the animals are happy & healthy, and how compassionate they are towards the animals  when they finally see the truth of it. Its a very interesting topic I knew little of but suspected something was wrong about training animals for our entertainment.  I hope more people will vote with their dollars by not support this kind of entertainment and it will just go away. This kind of thing should be talked about to inform others who think its fun entertainment and a way to learn bout these creatures.

5566496,5,B00BARKZ1G,"I was astounded by Blackfish in a number of different ways.

1. Horrifying. We watched together as a family and all agreed that it was gut wrenching to learn and to really have it brought home that captive animals like the majestic Tilikum, instead of being honored and revered are continually, brutally and unrelentingly abused.  From the outset when he was ripped from his mother and his pod as an infant and the members of his community protested and attempted to rescue him (yes, you heard me) to the final view of Tilikum, alone in a pool isolated from his own, we were horrified for him and what is says about who so many humans are. A day does not go by now when i don't become active on the net, for majestic creatures, in general,  and for Tilikum, in particular. The day he is released into a life of freedom and care will be a spiritually important one for reversing the bleak cruelty that marks the souls of the perpetrators.

2. Relevance to all that occurs when money means more than life. A remarkable documentary about why the abuse suits the
conglomerate of owners, likely, shareholders and ""benefactors"" of Sea World. The continual barrage of disinformation, propaganda,
misrepresentation and distortion about the needs of marine mammals, why such a large majestic animal would attack his ""handlers and the placing of blame for their deaths on the human handlers.  Actually, I partly agree, since they went along with keeping Tilikum in captivity, lying about the effects of that captivity on the health and welfare of the the animals in their charge and putting on smiling faces while forcing a wild animal to act like a cute little pet for millions of shrieking customers/visitors to the park (or zoo).

The argument that people can learn to love these animals and fight for their welfare is specious, since the animals' welfare is kept from the audience with disinformation and misinformation.

3.  Excellent portrayal of the mechanisms and issue of behavior modification. Excellent for general psychology classes, social psychology classes, psychology of prejudice classes (many humans think it is ok to abuse animals, because they are lower down on the evolutionary scale than we, the most dominant animal). I am a social, environmental and clinical psychologist and will be showing this to my undergraduate classes for the environmental issues, misapplication of behavior modification (yes, it works to deprive a less dominant living being of food to get them to behave as you wish), it just isn't ethical, Sure you can control the food supply and make an animal do what you want. Nothing new in that, It's just vulgar to do so. Schedules of reinforcement, drive states, shaping and chaining behavior, its all there, just in a disturbing and fascist format. Nothing new in human behavior in the human-human equation or the human-animal one, just bleak and grotesque in 2013. Moral and ethical behavior, do the owners, stockholder of Sea World have any/ Tea Party who cares so much about core American Values, where are you in this question? No where to be seen, of course.

4. Tilikum deserves better. Punished due to his enormous size from infancy on, deprived of stimulation and kept captive in a way if done to humans would be tantamount to keeping someone in a 5X3 dark box without food for 14-16 hours a day for years and years from the age of one and then blaming him/her for winding up unbalanced or angry, or more likely poorly socialized. People have made Tilikum the culprit rather than the end point of incredible human stupidity, brutality and indifference to the beauty, authority and power of this special creature.  Tiikum is prologue to the consistent way the human money machine is grinding up the living land and seas and the way that humans who care about capital over life deny the rights of the living so they can own, profit and violate the living.

See it for yourselves for it offers these perspectives not by preaching, but , by documenting and much more. Tilikum, This is review is a love note to you. I will work so one day you will be free of the burden of doing the ""man's"" work which puts you and those around you at risk, every day.

You really aren't a fish, I know that, but a majestic mammal with a coherent community and language, who, in the wild could have
captivated us and challenged the seas. May the hopes, actions and many dreams of those who have learned about your plight and who care about allowing you a natural and supportive outcome be carried on the wind and change the direction of your life and ours.",1390694400,2,4575,4.762626262626263

I went in with a certain defense thinking it was going to wrongfully trash SeaWorld and I came out with my eyes wide open in the end.  They pulled the veil off SeaWorld and other similar aquarium parks and really tell the whole story of the whales lives.  It's funny because SeaWorld released a Truth About Blackfish article (it's posted on their SeaWorld San Diego Facebook page) and they twist thoughts around and play on words so much so that is becomes even more clear about the true monetary value their captive orcas and dolphins have to them.  It's more about profits than the true happieness of the whales and dolphins.

5566507,5,B00BARKZ1G,"SeaWorld declined to participate in this documentary and I think their PR nightmare might have been less severe if they'd actually contributed. Though the documentary features heavily on one side of the issue, there are attempts by others interviewed to at least soften what's been done by SeaWorld to these animals.  Still, there are heartbreaking accounts of young Orcas taken from their mothers and the resulting depressed cries from the mothers once the separation has occurred.  There are also many accounts from former trainers about the lack of actual training they receive and, in several cases, accurate information they are given about the animals. I think the trainers very much love these animals and do want to make the lives of these animals better, but they aren't fully informed when they hire on. The documentary suggests that SeaWorld's desire to run a business first is a contributing factor to the attitudes of these Orcas and the resulting accidents and, more often than not, blatant attacks.  Blackfish is, at times, hard to watch, but mostly it's a fascinating documentary. I highly recommend it.",1390348800,2,1119,5.137362637362638

I say ""careful,"" because the story tells itself without being over done. The writer and producer could have made this move far more sensational and graphic for pure shock value alone, but the shock this movie delivers has little to do with the tragic death of trainers and everything to do with the tragic lives these magnificent animals are forced to endure for the sake of human pleasure.

5566521,5,B00BARKZ1G,"Before watching this documentary I was unaware of exactly how intelligent Orcas are. Of course they're mammals, but not all mammals can display planning and forethought, and certainly not all have a richly deep and complex emotional life. Unfortunately for Orcas in captivity, it is this ability for forethought and their deep emotions that cause them to suffer.

As this documentary shows, the people who train them are blamed when the animals (quite understandably) lash out at their captors. Really the problem is not a momentary mistake by a trainer, but a systemic human failing in thinking that we have the ability and the right to keep these majestic and intelligent creatures in tiny concrete pools for the majority of their drastically shortened lives.

5566533,5,B00BARKZ1G,"I've loved and dreamed of being a killer whale trainer most of my life. When I got involved in captive wildlife and worked with animals, the more I learned the more objectively I could ask myself if the whales were really happy, and if being an ""ambassador"" for their species was worth it. I can tell you, it's not. When you put a killer whale in a tank, you change everything about what they are, so you don't even see their true nature.
I went from very pro-captivity to very anti-captivity when i went from high school to college. I decided that I'd rather hang out with killer whales in the wild. And that's what I did.
I live on San Juan Island, where part of Blackfish was filmed.
I get to see these amazing family groups very often and my lifelong dreams have been fulfilled. I get to educate people about what a real orca is. Everytime I see them in the wild, I think about their tank counterparts and it solidifies in my mind how ethically wrong it is to attempt to keep them locked up.

What further disturbs me is that with little effort how many lies I've uncovered that seaworld tells.
-don't separate moms and calves BIG LIE
- Daniel Dukes died of hypothermia - LIE - he died of drowning with pre mortem lacerations and injuries and post mortem injuries, and his genitals were bitten off. don't believe me? here's the autopsy report [...]
- Tilikum grabbed Dawn's ponytail - LIE- her ponytail was no where near his mouth in the footage taken seconds before he grabbed her. Multiple eye witness all attest it was her arm. it was a violent attack [...]

Please watch this film,  read ""death at seaworld"", watch ""The cove"", watch ""Lolita, Slave to entertainment"" and for an upper, check out ""The whale"".

Please don't go to any facility housing cetaceans. They evolved to be in the ocean, and that's where they need to be, not in a concrete barren tank performing tricks for our amusement.

Please consider going out on a boat to watch whales in their natural environment, I promise you it's way more educational and an experience none forget.",1389830400,6,2054,4.525606469002695

The expectations of the whale to act as only a means of entertainment is one of the moral questions of the video, as well as, is it moral to keep such an intelligent animal in a pool for its entire life.

I generally base my evaluation of a documentary on content as opposed to professional bells and whistles.  For instance I found ""Vanishing of the Bees"" to be much more compelling than the highly anticipated, ""More than Honey"" that I had to shut off after 30 minutes.  ""Blackfish"" definitely made me pause to think about the way we handle these animals.  Only after watching the movie did I understand why they called a mammal a fish(that's the scientist in me getting annoyed).  Speaking of bells and whistles though, this was a top tier production.

5566555,4,B00BARKZ1G,"I will admit that this is a very one sided documentary. I have read a few one star reviews and they definitely make some very good points. This film was done to shed light on how Tilikum is considered responsible for 3 deaths and how it is wrong for whales to be kept in captivity. After doing my own research I wish that the story of Keiko, the whale in three of the Free Willy movies, was shared. Keiko was discovered in very bad conditions to say the least and after the films money was released to free Keiko. Although it is a great thought, the whale that stars in a movie about freeing a whale gets freed Keiko didn't do too well. Keiko had spent most of his life in captivity making him a bad choice for rehabilitation to be released. Although he was doing fantastic at first, Keiko died at a young age of pneumonia. Keiko was also never able to join any other pods because he was a part of a different family. I also wish the movie went more in-depth with profiles of the other Sea World orcas. I firmly believe that it is inhumane to keep any large mammal such as an orca in captivity. I also know how amazing it is to see these animals up close I mean I love SeaWorld! I also know we can not simply release the whales but I think we should stop breeding whales so eventually we have no more of them in captivity. It'd also be nice if we could set up a large area in the ocean for the captive whales to live out their lives in a bigger space. Don't get me wrong Sea World has done a lot of amazing things but this is one very bad thing in my opinion. I also think that with any whale related injury we can't blame the whales only people. Like the saying their are no bad dogs only bad people. These whales are animals of instinct and are much bigger than humans it's like trusting a Great Dane with a hamster and not expecting the dog to accidentally injury the little creature.

5566561,3,B00BARKZ1G,"The main thing this documentary seems to highlight are the two/three extremes of Seaworld parks. One, Seaworld corp is abusing the whales for financial gain. They are blatantly ignoring known whale behavior making a dangerous job even more dangerous by needlessly stressing the animals and poor breeding habits. And they are now making little to no effort to make the whales lives better. Two, OSHA has absolutely no business in this business. It's like OSHA trying to make bull riders, jockeys, and race car drivers safe. The people working there need to have an understanding that they are working with a large animal fully capable of killing them and decide for themselves if it is worth the risk. Three, the only other view shown is the fantasy ""Free Willy"" view. Virtually all of the animals have never seen the ocean or built any immunities to the various diseases in it. Shooting the animals would be the more humane way to the same goal. Imagine setting your dog free among a wolf pack, same result. While giving factual information it fails to even suggest that there is a solution. Seaworld changed the way we thought about these animals much the same as any other zoo and just like zoo's that started out capturing wild animals and putting them in steel and concrete cages Seaworld and other marine parks need to evolve. Where limited knowledge and ability had us build the tanks we see today we are now able to build bigger, more natural tanks and with our understanding increasing we can have happy, productive animals. We need to get away from the noisey pyrotechnic rock show and return to only displaying natural behaviors. I personally would love to see Seaworld be more like the smaller aquariums where you could view the animals in an artificially natural setting with puzzles and toys and maybe a short show displaying behaviors wild whale perform naturally. Where there were family groups and all breeding was done logically and artificially. But apparently the middle ground and the most obvious solution is NOT being even remotely entertained.",1389484800,4,2066,4.905714285714286

Just as I would see or look at people and respect them for who they were, whether Asian, Caucasian etc, I saw no difference in the majestic ocean creatures that share our planet.  As a matter of fact, I saw man as the inferior one.  Tiny and insignificant next to the enormously skilled Orka whale.

Masters of the ocean  beautiful and serenely peaceful, they radiate such godliness, yet we give them labels that are totally incorrect.  Orka for example means demon from hell Ridiculous isn't it when we are the the real demons from hell.  The perpetrators of heinous acts of kidnapping, deprivation,  torture and murder. We have wronged them in so many ways and we need to take action to stop these barbaric practices  on going.  We keep them in captivity separating them from their families ignoring their wails and laments their grief and sorrow while we continue to laugh, grossly insensitive and dull to their momentous torture and pining for the freedom in the ocean once again.

 Then we starve them  for our entertainment and recreation.  Is this who we are?  Why is man so insensitive to their cries and their pain?  We capture them by using all kinds of dishonest tactics to get them into captivity and treacherous methods then drive them to insanity by imprisoning them in a cramped unnatural environment, keeping them hungry with a minimum of food until they obey our hidden messages of punishment or reward.  Where are their lawyers, to defend them.  Is it fair?  We are the devil that exists for them and for all creatures. Very painful to watch but incredibly powerful as you see the revenge and frustration of the whale. More whales should retaliate and do to  their slave masters what is being done to them,  until man frees all the creatures that he stole from the ocean.  Gratitude and blessings to those who spoke out after witnessing the cruelty taking place. I watched you cry as you spoke, it moved me deeply and now I too will speak out and be the voice for those who go unheard.  Please continue to educate the world who is blinded by the gross suffering of the animal kingdom here on earth. Watch the amazing intelligence and beauty of the marine world that we never knew existed. See them as  superior beings and not just for our entertainment and greed.  We need to become more aware and observe their right to a happy life just like us. Incredible footage of real life attacks made this video so powerful.

Blackfish is about two things.  One, it is the story of a male orca, a ""Killer whale"" or blackfish named Tilikum, who has spent most of his life in captivity.  He is also involved in the deaths of 3 people.  Whose fault is this... Tilikum, SeaWorld, the people who captured Tilikum originally, or the public who demands performing animals?

The second story is about the ethics of manipulating large wild animals to become amusing novelties.  On the one hand, exposing people to magnificent animals like orcas can promote a passionate attitude toward their conservation.  After all, how many of us get to spend time with orcas in the Antarctic or in Puget Sound?  On the other hand, how ethical is it to take an animal, adapted to roaming huge distances in the oceans with its family, and keep it for its entire life in a glorified swimming pool?  After all, we do the same thing with lions, and tigers, and bears, keeping them in miniscule cages compared to their normal home ranges.

[...]

My heart goes out to any animal that is held in some sort of captivity...... constrained from enjoying freedom, exercise, community, natural life functions in the wild. Peer into their eyes, hear their cries ... you can feel the pain of their broken spirit. I've seen Shamu, dolphin, etc.  perform at SeaWorld. Fun to watch, but I have to wonder .... how aware are they about what's going on, are they happy or sad, do they miss normal life (as they know it), will they attack humans near them when some action or perception sparks their innate wildness. We've seen this unpredictable behavior in many different ""wild"" animals held in captivity: bear, elephants, gorillas, gators, ..... I think it's OK for them to ""entertain"" if they enjoy it of their free will, but not when forced. And how do we know? We are just dumb humans who think everything in this world is subservient to us..........unaware and/or uncaring about the other precious spirits that share this wonderful planet with us.

5566586,4,B00BARKZ1G,"A lot of people here seem to get most of their information about killer whales from the documentary and therefore don't have as much knowledge as they should in order to actually judge the situation of captive Orcas.
I've gone through some of the negative reviews and a lot of them show that people have no clue about what's actually going on and misinterpreted a lot of the statements made in the movie. One compares killer whales to other captive animals, mammals, reptiles and so on. To even put reptiles into one category with these whales, is downright ridiculous. And of course, all zoos and animal theme parks, safari parks, whatever, should be closed and the animals released, whenever possible. But I don't know whether an alligator would be happier in the swamp than it is in a zoo pool, but I know for sure, that Orcas and other intelligent mammals are suffering in captivity.

Another reviewer criticizes the statement made in the movie, that killer whales do not display aggressive behavior in the wild. The movie made completely clear that this statement refers to whale on whale behavior, not on hunting and killing prey. Killer whales are apex predators and of course, they're killers, and they kill because they need food, not because they are aggressive animals. Killer whales in the wild don't ram another whale with such force as to break jaws and bleed to death. They may do that to their prey, but not to each other. And to one of the reviewers who claims that SeaWorld knows much more about Orcas than scientists, because SeaWorld watches the animals all the time, and marine scientists just get to see them for a few hours: what is your point? Orcas in captivity don't behave like the ones in the wild, so the knowledge gleaned from SeaWorld footage means next to nothing. And there is extensive research on wild Orcas being done all the time, so yes, marine biologists do know a thing or two about Orcas.
No Orca in the ocean hangs at the same spot for hours and hours on time, doing nothing. They're on the move, all the time. They're not locked up. They are with their families, and here we come to one of the most horrible things being done to those animals: separating families. And I'm not just talking about the ones captured in the ocean. I am also talking about the fact, that marine parks, SeaWorld among them, keep on shipping the whales from park to park, separating calves from their mothers on a
regular basis. They don't stop at breaking up families in the ocean, they keep on doing it to the captive whales too.

Ever heard of Corky? She was mentioned once in the movie, unfortunately not enough information. She was a few years old when she was taken away from her mother in 1969, she's the killer whale who lives in captivity longer than any of the others. In 1993, almost a quarter century after she was torn away from her family, they gave her a chance to listen to vocalizations of her family. According to witnesses, she visibly started shaking and vocalizing poignantly for a long time. Any questions?

What about the mother whale in the movie, who cried and cried because they took her baby away? Did it sound like grief to you? It sure did to me.
Another reviewer says the film is manipulating viewers, for instance showing an infant whale and making it look like they're being taken away from their mothers while they're still infants. Well, if you got that impression, you didn't pay attention. But there's this: killer whales stay with their mothers almost all of their lives (and with extended family, like siblings) and if you ask me, it's almost worse to take them away at a few years of age, because by then they're already used to being with their family all the time!

And no, the movie is not lying about the lifespan of wild whales. I had to laugh at the shameless lies of the SeaWorld reps who told visitors of the park, that Orcas in the wild ,have a lifespan of 25 to 30 years and actually live longer in the park, because of all the great vet care! What BS! Orcas in captivity are sick most of the time, suffering from skin diseases, intestinal problems, dental problems and numerous infections. Antibiotics are a part of their regular diet. Why? Because they live in unnatural circumstances and that makes them sick!

I know it's a worn out comparison but it's valid nevertheless: imagine being locked up in a swimming pool (doesn't have to be a bath tub) for most of your life and not losing it! No matter what you do, no amount of enrichment, entertainment and other well meaning, but ill conceived efforts will be enough to replace the experience of living in the ocean, with your family of origin.

In the end, my opinion about the movie is this: for people who don't have any previous knowledge about the whole issue, some of the movie info can be confusing, misleading, definitely incomplete. I am suggesting to go out and get some books and read up on it.
Nevertheless, the movie started a necessary learning process for many people, who where thinking (like me many years ago) that  those animals are doing just fine in captivity. That is just not true. And thanks to efforts like this documentary we're moving slowly but surely towards a future where eventually no more marine mammals will be in prison.",1389052800,3,5277,4.619402985074627

5566589,5,B00BARKZ1G,"The last time I ever went to a whale park was the old Marineland, which was located on the Palos Verdes Peninsula and is now long gone.  Those were very fond memories of when my family was together and still getting along.  I enjoyed the whale and dolphin shows and I remember how I played with the dolphins between shows by playing with a volleyball that I threw back and forth.  Some years before, I went to Sea World in Mission Bay San Diego a couple of times and enjoyed it tremendously.

I now begin to realize what truly kept these places in business.  Lies, deceit, abuse of animals, threats of termination to employees who wouldn't go along with the program and slick lawyers who kept the doors open and the money flowing.

How do you deal with the death of the trainers?  Tell the press it was an accidental drowning.  Then pack on more lies and cover ups.  A couple of years afterwards, it was like it never happened.  And if any trainers or park personnel stepped out of line (or talked about it to the government or to the press) they were threatened with termination (possibly worse).

As a result, they're able to spin themselves cleaner than Mother Theresa.

Before you plan any vacation, see this documentary and have your kids see it, too.  You'll come to understand that when you patronize these sea parks, you are taking part in cold blooded murder.  Murder as in owners of these parks deferring blame to trainers (some of them dead, so they can't even defend themselves) or other bogus phenomena after an ""incident"" rather than the owners of Sea World (or similar places) taking whales away from their mothers, abusing them physically and penning them up for decades at a time.

Hence, more pain and suffering to the whales and more trainers dying in horrific ways.

With documentaries like these, we need to come to a profound understanding about our relationship with nature.  It is to be respected.  Whether it's our eliminating dependence on fossil fuels that causes global weather catastrophe, or showing basic respect to all intelligent life, whether it runs on the ground, or swims in the ocean.

Otherwise, nature will take care of us.  And it will make the horrors depicted in this film seem astonishingly tame in comparison.",1389052800,4,2254,4.701530612244898

5566601,1,B00BARKZ1G,"This whole documentary is a bit of a sham. It is intentionally misleading sometimes even outright lying. I could go on for ages about what is wrong with this documentary but I'll just say a few things here. The film often uses footage of orcas that aren't Tilikum and pretend that it is. They do this to make it seem like Tilly is alone all the time or always covered in rake marks. They also use footage of a few month old baby orca and pretend that is when the orca was separated from it's mother, rather than years later. This is intended to evoke more sympathy.
The film names SeaWorld as the only ones capturing orcas, but actually it was independent contractors that SeaWorld bought from. And the majority of the orcas they have now (excluding five) were captive born not captured. Yet other companies in other countries are still capturing orcas around the world as recently as 2013.
SeaWorld no longer breeds Tilikum or uses his sperm for insemination, and hasn't for years. The family tree chart they show is also intentionally misleading, going so far as to indicated Tilikum was bred with his own SON (you know a male) Taku twice. Though the film also makes the argument that Tilikum shouldn't have been bred in the first place due to his violent past, but it also makes the argument that his violent nature is due to treatment. If his nature is due to treatment then genetics would have no factor and breeding him would be no problem.
They intentionally inflate the life spans of wild orcas by not factoring in the deaths of baby orcas. Wild orcas often don't make it through their first year, to the point that they aren't named by researchers until their first birthday, and those numbers aren't calculated in to the average lifespans they provide. But they aren't mentioned when discussing SeaWorld's average lifespans.
Then talking about the brains, they says orcas have a section next to the limbic system, and that it must be an extension of the limbic system. What? Why? What else was it next to? Couldnt it be an extension of that? I feel like the logic jump was missing and stated so factually so people would assume it was true but they have literally no idea and are just guessing. Not to mention that we can't take one orcas brain and apply it to orcas in general. They also go on to say that even though the orcas are supposedly more advanced emotionally, they can't form bonds with trainers. But why not?
The footage of whales breaching on trainers and whatnot was crazy, but I don't thinks its proof of psychosis. I mean dominance struggles are pretty common in most animals, its just that with whales they are a bigger deal.
It's absolutely ridiculous that they try to say SeaWorld knew Dukes was in the pool and just left him to die. Ive also always heard that Tilly was circling the pool with Dukes on his back, and was making distress calls. Which doesnt sound like parading around at all. I just don't understand how they think it is possible that Tilly missed the bridge whistle, like their hearing is amazing how could he have not heard it. And they make it seem like Dawn stopped reinforcing Tilly with fish, which I do not think is even remotely possible. I do not at all believe that Dawn would keep asking for behaviors from Tilikum and not give him reinforcement. Not once, not a single time do they ever mention that Tilly is given any form of stimulation besides shows. They don't mention Trua, they don't mention EEDs, and they don't mention daily enrichment sessions. Of course SeaWorld declined contributing to the film, why would they want their words twisted? Also no mention of Lolitas awful situation or Kshamenk, I guess they never attacked anyone so not interesting enough. And that would be excusable if they only talked about Tilikum but they talk about several other orcas. But the point of this film isn't to spread light on orca captivity, it's to make people hate SeaWorld.
Also to anyone trying to Free Tilikum, he is ineligible for release. He has no teeth and thus could not defend himself in the wild, he has holes in his teeth from them being drilled and thus is vulnerable to infection from any strange bacteria in wild water, and he has a hard time with change. He has been at SeaWorld Orlando since 1992 and moving him would be very traumatic. He refused to go in the underwater viewing pool for years because he didn't like the new floors and changes, how do you think he would feel about a seapen or the actual open ocean? Not to mention separating him from Trua who he spends a lot of time with and the other orcas at Orlando that he interacts with through the gate.",1388880000,45,4633,4.569711538461538

When you are a kid seeing wild animals so up close is really exciting.  But as I got a little  older, I mean a long time ago, I found that watching Nat'l Geographic-type shows were a lot more educational AND interesting.  How many times have I gone to a zoo in the past where the animals are sleeping or sitting motionless (or worse--rocking or chewing on themselves--Horrifying.)

I'm a fan of the large nature preservation sites that give the animals a more realistic approach to life in the wild.  It's unfortunate that it takes the loss of human lives for people to notice these places are not right.  If you're not convinced, go watch The Cove.

5566609,4,B00BARKZ1G,"Blackfish is not a pure documentary in the strictest sense--a movie in which the producer endeavors to evenly display information from both sides of the argument.  Rather, Blackfish should be considered an advocacy documentary.  The producer is most certainly using facts and opinions to advocate for one side of the argument and to advocate for action.  There is only about 1 minute of film where a proponent of Sea World provides an antagonistic viewpoint to the producer's theory.  The rest of the video is designed to express, convincingly so, that imprisoning killer whales is animal cruelty and often results in aggressive behavior.

I think it's a good documentary and worth watching a couple times.  When I was young, I though Sea World was a terrific place where captive animals were well cared for and where humans could be educated about the plight of sea mammals.  I also believed that exposing humans to sea life in such close quarters would raise awareness and make humans more sensitive to appropriate ocean conservation efforts.  It accomplishes those things, but at what cost?  Do the ends justify the means?  Is a ""little bit"" of animal cruelty acceptable if it brings in money and raises awareness?

As I grew older and attended more Sea World venues, I began to recognize that these animals did not reside in captivity voluntarily and that restricting animals to little concrete swimming pools or metal cages was unnatural.  Comparing animal behavior in the wild with animal behavior in captivity solidified this understanding for me.  I no longer frequent zoos or places like Sea World because of this realization.  We humans are smart:  We can certainly come up with a way of appreciating and learning about animals without keeping them as prisoners in cages.

Blackfish is worth the watch.  It provides a perspective that Sea World purposely tries to keep out of the public eye.",1388793600,2,1901,5.003184713375796
5566610,5,B00BARKZ1G,"I honestly didn't think another movie could touch me as deeply as The Cove but Blackfish did. I couldn't stop thinking about the majestic  animal for a long time after the movie. Everyone should watch it and understand how cruel Sea World is by keeping these orcas in captivity and how cruel we are by supporting their action by going to watch these shows.
For those reviewers that felt this was biased or what not, think about this, SW has had many chances to show their side of the story, but they haven't. I have been to many of the orca shows growing up and I loved them. But I always felt the space they live in seem way too small for them. Now truly understanding just how little space they have is heartbreaking.

Lastly, taking their young away from them, it is barbaric and criminal. Of someone took my girls or if anyone separate a child from a perfectly capable and loving mother, the world would be outraged and the abductor would be hunted down and justice would be served. Yet here we are, separating a cub from a mother, their response is heartbreaking.  The orca js more than showed just how intelligent and how social they are. Their family structure is not unlike the human. Their protectiveness of their young is every bit as strong, how can we stand by and watch the atrocious acts against these beautiful animals?

Aside from the fact that the documentary is beautifully made, I feel everyone should watch Blackfish to get a better sense how actions for our entertainment has impacted one of the most beautiful animals in the world and the organization that is behind it.

I don't doubt that SW has done a lot of  good for marine biology in other fronts, or that they could, indeed provide a more appropriate environment for the orca in their care, if they wished. I think it is time foe them to step up.",1388793600,2,1825,4.498489425981873

These creatures need to be released but then they will likely die having never been in a pod for so long.  Sea World needs to close down and be held accountable to find a way to return these animals to the wild.  Better they be released and die free then continue to live in that horrible fish bowl.

5566618,4,B00BARKZ1G,"""Blackfish"" begins with a 911 call made from Sea World in Orlando, Florida on February 24, 2010 to report a death: ""...a whale has eaten one of the trainers..."" That trainer was Dawn Brancheau, an experienced trainer of orcas. The whale in question was the orca ""Tilikum"", who was captured as a child in Icelandic waters in 1983. ""Blackfish"" is the result of an effort by director Gabriela Cowperthwaite to understand exactly what happened and why on that day in 2010. She interviews former Sea World trainers who knew Tilikum and his victim, former trainers who knew him from his previous stay at Sealand of the Pacific in Canada, whale researchers, and gets ahold of a lot of video footage of violent behavior by orcas toward their trainers at various marine parks.

At only 1 hour and 20 minutes long, ""Blackfish"" is straightforward and packed with information and interesting stories. Unfortunately, management at Sea World declined to be interviewed for the film, which might have given it a counterpoint. But former trainers Jeffrey Ventre, John Hargrove, Samantha Berg, Carol Ray, Mark Simmons, Kim Ashdown, Dean Gomersall, and John Jett talk about their time at Sea World, their enthusiasm for the jobs they obviously loved, and their initial ignorance about orcas in captivity, including the incidence of violent attacks on trainers, which they claim Sea World tended to misrepresent. Whale researcher Howard Garrett provides some insight into orcas in the wild, and specialist Dave Duffus discusses cases of orcas attacking trainers.

One of the most compelling interviews is early on, as John Crowe recounts his experience 39 years earlier in capturing young orcas at sea, a horrific recollection that announces the film's theme. ""Blackfish"" is steadfastly against keeping orcas in captivity. The former trainers became very disillusioned at Sea World, they became more educated, and some now advocate to move captive orcas to sea pens, where their needs could be better met. It would have been nice to hear Sea World respond to specific accusations, but there doesn't seem to be much room for argument, because marine parks cannot meet orcas' most basic needs. These are creatures up to 6 tons in size, living decades in small tanks, developing health problems that they would not normally have, without even the ability to communicate normally with their fellow captives.

The DVD (Magnolia 2013): Bonus features include 7 short interviews, a trailer (2  min), and an audio commentary by director Gabriela  Cowperthwaite and producer Manny Oteyza. In ""Kanduke"" (2 min), former trainer Dean Gomersall talks about the death of a whale from mosquito-borne encephalitis. ""Death by Mosquito"" (3 min) interviews former trainer John Jett, who wrote a doctoral dissertation on mosquito-borne encephalitis in captive orcas. In ""Orca Teeth Show the Stress of Orcas in Captivity"" (3 min), former trainer Jeffrey Ventre, now an MD, discusses the dental problems suffered by captive orcas and whale mortality. In ""Recollections of a Former Sea World Trainer"" (5 min), John Hargrove recounts a situation in which he was helped by an orca when injured. ""The Truth About Wild Whales"" (5 min) interviews Dr. Naomi Rose, PhD about how orcas fare in captivity. In ""Alternatives to Captivity"" (2 min), Dr. Rose talks about an orca named Lolita whom she hopes will be retired to a sea pen. ""A Note from Director Gabriela Cowperthwaite"" (8 min) interviews the director about how she became interested in orcas and how the focus of the film changed to an activist film once she began making it.

5566632,5,B00BARKZ1G,"""Black fish"" was shot in the aftermath of a fatal accident at SeaWorld in Florida, where a male killer whale killed a trainer, Dawn Brancheau. The film tries to be balanced, with spokespeople both for and against keeping orcas in captivity, but really serves as the brief for the prosecution. Aquarium owners steal young whales from their families, causing the left-behind moms painful grief. The whales are often kept in isolation and slowly driven mad with boredom in their tiny enclosures. Aquarium owners skimp on training the young people who tend to the whales, and feed them self-serving information to share with aquarium visitors. All very damning and sad.

By the end of the film, the filmmaker's need to show aquarium owners as wholly evil (and that killer whales in the wild were always happy and free) gave me the sense that I was getting a pretty biased version of the story. Still, the footage about the large number of killer whale accidents was disquieting. The question is whether there is a better way to house and display these animals without destroying their personalities and endangering the lives of trainers.

5566633,4,B00BARKZ1G,"Blackfish is an intriguing documentary about the plight of Orcas kept in captivity in places such as Seaworld.  It follows the story of one orca in particular, Kilikum, and the death of Dawn Branchea.

Although it has been accused of being one-sided by some reviews, it is important to note that this documentary is not intended to serve as a critique of SeaWorld in particular.  SeaWorld has done some truly wonderful things and has rescued and rehabilitated numerous animals over the years; however, this does not mean that SeaWorld is completely innocent when it comes to its business practices.  This story, in particular, is about how dangerous it can be to put an intelligent creature in an unstimulating environment and assume that all orcas are the same.  As it is detailed in the film, Orcas are highly intelligent creatures that can be argued to have numerous different cultures.  Placing members of these various cultures together in one relatively small pool has proven to be dangerous as this documentary shows.  As such, the goal of this documentary is to highlight some of the facts of the situation, even if they may be damaging for companies such a SeaWorld.

If you are interested in Orcas, this is an excellent documentary to watch.  It provides the watcher with a healthy amount of basic knowledge about Orcas and what they experience in captivity.  In addition, it serves as a healthy reminder of the dangers of keeping wild animals in captivity, especially highly intelligent ones.

If you are planning on being any kind of an animal trainer, I would also recommend this documentary as it, while being a little heavy handed, does provide an alternative view to the ""if you know what you are doing, are a good animal trainer, and follow the rules you will be safe"" mentality. Also, it is a healthy reminder to make sure you do your homework and actually know what you are getting yourself into and actually know the facts as, intentionally or not, you may not be getting the full story from an employer.",1388361600,,2024,4.820809248554913

5566635,5,B00BARKZ1G,"Nine Things about Blackfish

1. Dont be fooled by the oddly bland title, or the fact that you may not have heard of this film. This is a stunning and heart wrenching documentary - perhaps the best of the year.

2. In 2010, SeaWorld trainer Dawn Brancheau was killed by a whale at the park. The official news story was that Dawn made a mistake by letting her ponytail hang out, and the whale grabbed it and she got pulled under.  Filmmaker Gabriela Cowperthwaite thought the story sounded suspicious, so she started digging around. The result was this film.

3. While the death of Brancheau is the hook of Blackfish, that topic isn't really dealt with until the end. The movie is much deeper and more comprehensive than that. Its a compilation of interviews, court testimony, SeaWorld commercials, and home video over several decades.

4. It documents 30 years of SeaWorlds actions, including accounts of how they capture, treat, and train the orcas, especially one particular killer whale, Tilikum.

5. By contrasting SeaWorlds public image with what really was going on behind the scenes, this movie reaches far beyond one sad incident and becomes a blistering indictment of SeaWorld itself.

6. SeaWorld is understandably upset at this film, and released a statement saying, in part, Blackfish is billed as a documentary, but instead of a fair and balanced treatment of a complex subject, the film is inaccurate and misleading... to promote its bias that killer whales should not be maintained in a zoological setting, the film paints a distorted picture

7. Interestingly, the filmmakers repeatedly asked SeaWorld to be interviewed for Blackfish, and SeaWorld repeatedly declined, only releasing that statement after the film came out. That was probably smart on SeaWorlds part. I don't see any way they could successfully defend themselves here.

8. Pixar studios is currently working on Finding Dory, a sequel to Finding Nemo. When the director of that movie saw Blackfish, he rewrote parts of the film, including the ending.

9. If enough people see this movie, it may be able to single-handedly take down SeaWorld.",1388361600,7,2121,5.034285714285715

For our planet and the human animal to survive, we must change our attitude of speciesism or superiority over other animals for greed and other exploitation - such as for vanity, entertainment and food.  These creatures are spiritually and intellectually far superior to us in ways we will never understand, and have the pure and direct connection with nature which is the life force.  They are of other worlds and nations and speak other langages.  Would you or the members of your family want (or allow) your child to be stolen from you to be trained for circus acts? This miracle of this planet was not created for human consumption alone.  Unfortunately, there are few man made laws to protect other animals.

How has it benefited society and what has been the contribution to science from the brutal captivity?  If you have read, ""The Jungle"" you can't help but compare the Killer whale,Tilikum's tragic existence with that of the ill-fated Jurgis Rudkus.

This movie is a work of art. It successfully exposes SeaWorld's darkest secrets, while providing a provocative examination on an incident that took place at a SeaWorld facility a few years ago. The entire industry, thus, is examined, as the same time. This is an industry that SeaWorld is on top of. This orca captivity industry makes SeaWorld's pockets ever so deep. The financial losses that this film is causing them are just now being realized by SeaWorld execs. What should they do? Firstly: stop lying. Secondly: stop lying some more. Thirdly: admit their wrongdoings. Then and only then may people consider forgiving them for their crimes against the world.

SeaWorlds denies every single part of this documentary. They call the makers and supporters of Blackfish terrorists and low-lifes, but any educated person can see through such labels. Yes, SeaWorld is extremely pissed right now. They have every right to be: their darkest secrets they've been hiding for so long are now out in the open. Instead of admitting to their mistakes and poor treatment of orcas, they fight the facts and try everything they can to diminish this documentaries good name. But, what about SeaWorld's good name? Wait, what? Their name was never good to begin with.

Still on the edge of who to believe? Just simply rent Blackfish. The worst thing that could happen is that you'll be out $1. If the latter bothers you -- PM me and I'll send you a dollar.

As of December 2013, Blackfish is available for rental at local Redbox's ($1.20 DVD, $1.50 Blu-ray), iTunes ($5), here on Amazon ($4) and Netflix ($8/month), just to name some of the most popular rental services out there.

5566679,5,B00BARKZ1G,"Blackfish is the story of the infamous Orca called Tilikum. The film features commentary from several former Sea World trainers, former Sea Land workers (Canadian park where Tilikum resided after his capture in 1982), and one of the men who actually captured Tilikum when he was just two years old back in 1982 off the coast of Iceland. Notably absent is any current representation of Sea World.

I watched this with very little knowledge about Tilikum. I had known about the attack in 2010, and I faintly recalled the incident of a man being found in his pool, but other than that I really did not know too much about him. I actually watched this documentary twice, and both times found it very disturbing for different reasons. The first time was because I was far more focused on the whales, as the film talks about more than just Tilikum (though he is the primary focus). I know a fair bit about Orcas in general, and I know that they are not violent animals--normally. They do hunt for food like any other animal, but they don't coordinate attacks on humans in the wild. There has never been a single documented attack on a human in the wild, as this documentary also points out. Now, either no witnesses live to tell about it, or quite frankly it just doesn't happen. This documentary recalls the deaths of not only Dawn Brancheau in 2010, but also of two other trainers at the hands of orcas in captivity who were performers for Sea World and a park in the Canary Islands, Loro Parque, where the whales are owned by Sea World.  There are also several clips of incidents with the orcas and trainers that could have proven fatal as well. We also learn a little more about what really happened to the homeless man who fell into Tilikum's tank.

Disturbance number two for me was hearing the scripted lies Sea World employees tell. In all fairness the employees did not seem to know much about marine life, and this is pretty much stated by all the trainers in the documentary. None of them really knew anything about the animals and just what Sea World told them to do. They also show Sea World employees stating facts that are simply not true. One of the most popular was about the dorsal fins being flopped over. This is something that happens in captivity due to a lack of room to swim, yet Sea World employees will say it happens in about 25% of whales in the wild. Also, their life span is pretty long, yet Sea World claims they live longer in captivity. This is simply not true, and its not like its hard to disprove these things, but that is why Sea World loses creditability quickly. I also found it extremely disturbing that these trainers were not told of incidents involving animals. I understand not wanting to scare people, but you are talking about a 5,000 pound whale not a stray dog. These are powerful animals and the trainers who escaped being killed were just extremely lucky.

This film will open up your mind and have you questioning whether it is right to keep an animal like an orca in a swimming pool (because that's about what it amounts to), and make them work for food. I've never been to Sea World, but after watching this, I will never go and I will strongly encourage friends and family not to go either. I'd rather use my money to keep these creatures free and in the wild where they belong. Tilikum [and all other whales held in captivity] should be released to an open sea reserve where he can just be a whale and not be kept isolated. I do not see Sea World going out of business anytime soon, but its clear that this film is getting peoples attention, and that they are realizing all that glitters isn't gold.",1387584000,6,3648,4.497737556561086

Not surprisingly, SeaWorld refused requests by the filmmaker to be interviewed for the documentary, and their silence speaks mouthfuls!

Now that there is a huge and successful campaign against SeaWorld and their evil ways, they are fighting back with a million-dollar newspaper ad campaign, but I hope they fail and more people need to tell SeaWorld (and similar entertainment venues) enough is enough!

Every major attack or fatality, they have an excuse...anything to hide the fact that these highly intelligent and emotional animals are being driven to what appear to be psychotic breaks towards their trainers.

I'm open to considering that of course, this film was spun to show only what would sway the viewer towards the intended impression. When I see video after video of orca injured by their pool mates, many videos of attacks against trainers of varying intensity, video of adult orcas visibly mourning when their young are ripped away from them at management's whim, and clips of Sea World's PR machine in action working to deny what later is uncovered by numerous eye-witnesses after the latest fatality, I cannot help but think the opinion I formed watching this film is as it should be.

I too would have liked to hear Sea World's side of the story, but according to this film, the company repeatedly declined to comment. Sea World's silence speaks volumes.

I visited and loved Sea World as a child. My young children will not set foot in one as long as I'm in charge of them.

Sea World lies to the public and even their young, easily-impressed new trainers in order to keep the charade going so the company can keep raking in the money.",1387497600,,1522,4.7105263157894735

5566688,5,B00BARKZ1G,"""Blackfish"" IS an effective and persuasive documentary relying on the strength of personal confessions from former trainers of captive killer whales. The archive footage provides a graphic illustration along with the narrative. YES indeed everyone should see this film.

What began in the early seventies out of the waters of Puget Sound was an ignorant mistake. Capturing wild baby orcas was never scientific, and served only to damage the natural process. The wild populations are virtually at our back door steps. The wild orcas give us, on their own accord, the accessibility to observe, study and learn. Let's take common sense steps in implementing efforts to bring this madness to a cease. The Director makes valuable comments about such efforts in the Special Features adjacent to this film.",1387497600,,799,5.2421875
5566689,5,B00BARKZ1G,"Blackfish, so named by the native Americans for killer whales needed to be produced to let a niave public know how poorly Orcas are treated, and how SEA-WORLD trainers are put in harms way in caring for this animal.  Orcas, who are compared to Chimpanzees in intelligence, are gathered at SEA-WORLD enclosures as one happy family; rather, they are snatched from families in the wild and thrown together as strangers.  This causes fights among the Orcas, and unlike in the wild, there's no escape.  The documentary brings the viewer back repeatedly to ""Tilikum"", an Orca with a history of having killed trainers, and this fact, known by SEA-WORLD management was kept from its trainers resulting in repeated drastic consequences.  The corporation apparently wanted to keep Tilikum around for breeding purposes.  In watching this documentary, I was reminded about another one which exposed the human cruelty to some circus elephants, e.g., beating and prodding them with sharp hooks, until they learned to perform for the public.  ""Black Fish"" is difficult to watch sometimes but is a must see for all, in hopes that SEA-WORLD, and others who capture killer whales for profit, or otherwise, will discontinue this and let them live their normal long lives (cut dramatically short in captivity) in the wild.",1387497600,11,1302,5.117924528301887

5566696,1,B00BARKZ1G,"I found this documentary to be very biased and laced with more emotional appeals than objective facts. The 'experts' presented in the documentary, aside from one OSHA Whale Researcher, didn't appear to have the credentials necessary to comment on the specifics things they claimed to be true. The film was emotionally jarring but more based upon the music and the crying interviewees than the facts and events themselves. While it is upsetting that Tilikum and other orcas are captured and treated the way they are in the early segments of the film, I did not like that this film seems to imply that everything bad about this business and industry falls on SeaWorld's shoulders. The company may have made some mistakes, but they do much more good than harm on behalf of all of the animals they care for and this movie chooses to negate all of that by painting them as heartless money-mongers. Also, as an aside I could not get past, the dramatic music and subtitles at the closing of the film indicate that SeaWorld chose not to be interviewed for the film. No wonder, considering every word they would have said would be taken out of context and twisted to fit their own purposes? The film is poorly executed and the organization of the film's points is confusing. The intended message of the film seems to jump from pitying Tilikum to blaming SeaWorld for everything that has gone wrong, even before they were involved with the infamous mammal. This movie is, in my opinion, an example of questionable journalism and I recommend taking the points they try repeatedly drilling into your brain with a grain of salt.",1387411200,30,1615,4.771428571428571

5566708,3,B00BARKZ1G,"I was very young at the time, when I saw the Shamu Show @ Sea World Parks in San Diego.  What I remember, was that the exhibition tank, where Shamu performed with his trainers, appeared way too small.  At the time, and it still haunts me today, I put myself in Shamu's place, during the show, and tried to project the perfect size for that performance tank.  I thought to my self, and concluded, that the tank should be at least tree times larger.  When I studied the ratio of the other related tanks I concluded that the entire Shamu production was one-fifth the size it should be.  That was when I was about twelve years old in 1967.  At that time, Sea World Parks San Diego had only been open for two years.  I figured, ""San Diego Zoo is the top most reputable, immaculately kept, second to none, the most humane and foremost animal sensitive zoo in the world!  Sea World Parks San Diego must also have comparatively the highest and most optimum standards as well!""  After watching Blackfish [HD], rented from Amazon.com, my suspicions were reawakened and verified. ""Blackfish"" is a wakeup call; for mature audiences only!  [Non-spoiler]  I don't believe that OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration), and others like them, that want to ""shut it all down,"" and ""set them [Orca's] free,"" is the only solution.  The only correct precursor to the solution, to the problems faced in ""Blackfish,"" is to bring the facts to light; as did those that worked so ardently on ""Blackfish"" did.  And then, find a safe and humane resolution.

It leaves out any death or gory scenes, but you will be moved by the conditions the whales were kept in (since Seaworld hasn't commented, we don't know how they treat them presently). The ex-trainers themselves provide the info, most feeling very guilty but also conflicted because they had been told one thing by Seaworld and gradually realized the facts they were fed were not true, and they stayed on to care for ""their"" whales to try to help.

The film goes in depth about whales in captivity, and their stressed behavior. It also covers the death of Dawn one of the senior trainers at Sea World.

*Personal experience...*

I was invited to Sea World when I was 14 years old, and from the moment I stepped in, I got a weird feeling. There was something odd about how whales were forced to perform. I was concerned about the small pools they are forced to live in. They also force dolphins to perform tricks, not just orca whales. (Even though this documentary doesn't cover the dolphin issue.)

I wondered why these whales were not let go?
How can a human train these creatures to perform this way?
What happens if something goes wrong, will the whales/dolphins be punished when I leave the show? Will they ever be set free? What about their family, don't they usually swim in groups? Don't they feel lonely here?

This film confirmed my suspicions from my visit to Sea World :(.

Whales belong in the ocean- period. In the wild they catch their own fish, eat as much as they want, and travel wherever they please. That is the point of this documentary. Not so much to bash Sea World, but for humans to understand that animal captivity is cruel, and savage. The tragedy at Sea World was only one example of many.

You can tell he is truly traumatized.  I have watched this movie several times in the past couple of days and you go through several emotions from feeling said and sorry for the animals to pissed off with the company and how they are treating the animals. I went to Sea World when I was little and got to see Tilikum he is a massive and wonderful creature. Watch the movie and see why he acts the way he does.

5566744,5,B00BARKZ1G,"If I could rate this film with more stars I would.  This is such a powerful documentary about the life of Tilikum, a male Orca whale that was kidnapped from his ocean family and brought to aquariums (mainly SeaWorld) to live out his life being exploited for entertainment....During his time in captivity he killed 3 people, recently a trainer named, Dawn Brancheau.
It reveals the captive life these animals  have at SeaWorld, the cruel treatment all for entertainment value for the corporate hounds behind SeaWorld.
This film really opened my eyes enough to start petitions to get Tilikum released, a Facebook page educating people on the unethical treatment of these animals at these parks, and another page to get celebrities and musical groups and singers to cancel performances or visits and make a stand, to be a voice for the voiceless.  What they do is not conservation, it is all for pure profit!!!!",1386892800,5,908,4.921568627450981

Should open the eyes of Seaworld to release these Orcas to live their lives out in a sanctuary and for the public to boycott Seaworld . How sad it was in the film to hear a mother Orca at Seaworld ""cry/mourn"" so loud for days when her calf was yanked from her to be sent to another Seaworld to perform..to line the pockets of Seaworld owners. Highly recommend this award winning documentary.",1386806400,2,597,4.579439252336448

Personally, I think it is a well done documentary that keeps the viewer's attention. I like the way that they organized the information. There are a few flaws and misrepresentations, but after reading SeaWorld's response to the film, I think the film has SeaWorld worried. SeaWorld's assertions against the film had very little merit and only 2 were remotely justified.

Anyways, I recommend the documentary to anyone. It will certainly break your heart at times and make you think.",1386806400,6,754,5.024

5566759,5,B00BARKZ1G,Very informative. We have been to Sea World many times & I was concerned this movie would be heavy handed without much substance. That wasn't the case at all. We were very disturbed by the misinformation the parks are giving to guests. The trainers seem to be loving and mean well but very under-qualified almost as if Sea World wants to ensure they only learn information about Orcas that they want them to know. Tilicum's past and present situation is heartbreaking.,1386720000,4,468,4.790123456790123
5566760,5,B00BARKZ1G,"As background, I had no preconceptions nor expectations when I first went to see this documentary in the theater.  Also, I'm a long time resident of Central Florida, have never been an animal activist, and always loved taking out-of-town visitors to Sea World in Orlando.  The killer whale show was always the highlight of the day.

This documentary is truly outstanding and I was thrilled when the DVD was released.  In many ways, the DVD is even better than seeing it in the theater because of the added educational value of the special features and commentary.  The former trainers who are interviewed in the film do an excellent job in explaining the conditions to which the whales are subjected and provide reasons why unpredictable and aggressive behavior may sometimes occur.  Former trainers Jeffrey Ventre, John Jett, Samantha Berg, Dean Gomersall, and Carol Ray are especially effective in relating the cause and effect of whale behavioral based on the environment in which they exist.  They deserve much credit for their courage to speak out, and their testimony adds tremendously to the credibility of the film.  Expert whale researchers and neuro-scientists add fascinating information comparing killer whale behavior in their natural habitat in the wild versus captivity.  Especially interesting is the discussion of the makeup of the brain of a killer whale, the social bonds among them, and their exceptional emotional capacity.  The entire experience of watching the documentary is very emotional.  The screenwriting, directing, and editing of the film are excellent, much of the cinematography is beautiful, and the background music during the scenes of blackfish in the wild is perfect.

My takeaways from watching the DVD are as follows: a) of all mammals, killer whales are least suitable for captivity; b) captivity shortens the average life span of killer whales and often leads to unpredictable and aggressive behavior that has caused numerous injuries  and some fatalities among trainers; c) trainers should not be in the water with killer whales; d) although Sea World has and continues to do much good in terms of animal rescue and research, they have absolutely no credibility in defending their practices of using captive killer whales in a circus environment.

This is an outstanding documentary and a must see for all interested in preserving the dignity of these highly evolved mammals.  I recommend it highly!",1386720000,7,2442,5.225641025641026

They are stressed out and out of shape compared to the orcas in the wild. The animals are taken away from their pods and taught to perform stupid tricks for the amusement of children. Places such as SeaWorld should get shutdown and the animals should get introduced back into their natural habitat and eventually set free.,1386720000,2,472,4.974683544303797

5566787,5,B00BARKZ1G,"This disturbing and beautiful film is a harsh reminder that we humans can and must offer a less savage, more moral approach to the other conscious beings on this Earth who share our vulnerability to suffering.  We could begin by avoiding each and every one of the shoddy locations like Sea World, that propagate the sordid ""entertainment"" coerced from trapped animals.  ""Blackfish"" appeals to us all with an irresistible eloquence: Please, allow these unfortunate prisoners to experience some actual humanity, and a relocation to humane environments.  And please, close the doors of every park, zoo and circus where cruelty cavorts gleefully behind a mask of ""fun.""

My emotions were extreme as I watched ""Blackfish.""  The flawless blend of children's innocent joy with silent suffering was deft and apropos, and hard to bear. Living death trapped in a concrete prison, lasting perhaps 80-100 years?  What conscious being could possibly deserve or deliver such a fate? How painful to watch the corruption of children's world-view, to see clean, blameless young minds and hearts indecently shaped by the adults around them, as they applauded a cruel travesty.

My only visit to Sea World was sadly marred by looking through an ivy-covered fence that was intended to block the view of the sea lion cellblock.  This was immediately after watching a sea lion with his trainer, doing pranks and pratfalls in front of a delighted audience, with much humorous backtalk from lion to ""adoring"" human, and much amused applause from the bleachers.  A few minutes later I watched unseen, as the luckless animal was brutally whacked and forced into his cage by his doting ""buddy,"" and the iron door slammed in his face.  This was an authentic view of the shameful con that these performing animals are forced into at the hands of humans.  The now abject animal submitted to the abuse in a resigned and servile way, as ugly reality replaced Sea World's counterfeit burlesque of ""fun.""  It has been more than 25 years, and the memory still haunts me.  This race we call human owes something more, something better, to all of our defenseless kinfolk on this planet.

I don't feel guilty but am very angry...they've made fools of us, people, and we've naively supported the abuse.

True, there are many stories of an Orca saving the lives of Eskimos and people abandoned at sea-but, there's a huge difference in temperament of an Orca roaming free in the ocean than one you confine for 20 years in swimming pool-especially an alpha male. Sea Worlds everywhere should be shut down. If you want to see an Orca or dolphins rent a boat a sail along side them, but let's keeep them out of the confines of a bathtub.",1385596800,2,626,4.405172413793103
5566880,5,B00BARKZ1G,"This movie is amazing. The story of whales like Tilikum is heartbreaking. To see what happens to get them into captivity will make anyone tear up. They are extremely smart and have a brain eight times bigger than ours. I have never been to SeaWorld and I won't ever go there. The point of view was from the trainers at SeaWorld who genuinely care about the animals but weren't told everything about the animals they were caring for. A lot of people say it's biased, well SeaWorld didn't want to participate at all to defend themselves. I seriously hate them for blaming Dawn, she can't defend herself. If I went through what Tilikum went through I would be aggravated too. They don't belong in captivity.",1385596800,4,704,4.64
5566881,2,B00BARKZ1G,"Great and informative first 40 minutes. Then we hear the one sided biased view of ex-employees and a couple of activists. I believe whales born in captivity could display aggressive behaviors. Obviously those who work with whales can easily go to a library or rent a dvd that talks about whales to figure out that it is not the safest. But diving is not safe, neither is bungee jumping. Pups are separated from their moms for dogs and cats, yet we don't necessarily condemn it. Having visited the Monterrey Bay Aquarium, which is a research organization, and they have great programs that recover animals and release some in the wild and some are kept in display. Not every animal is able to return to the wild. Not showing this complexity nor any qualities about SeaWorld just makes this a propaganda. it is unfortunate. I thought it would be more along the lines of The Cove, where a broader set of people were heard about the topic. After watching the whales with their trainers in the movie, it made me understand that killer whales do not necessarily kill anyone. If over 30 years, a couple of people were dead, we could try to understand better what went on...

5566916,4,B00BARKZ1G,"I finally finished the movie. I couldn't get through it the first time because this is a very hard to watch and take it all in. I am probably the biggest fan of killer whales out there. Watching this helped to open my eyes to the fact that SeaWorld is a business that is out to make money and be successful. But another thing to think about, a majority of the whales in captivity now were born in captivity or have been in captivity for over 20 years. They just can't be thrown out in the wild when they haven't been exposed to predators or haven't been taught how to catch prey. That is almost as bad as keeping them in captivity. My personal opinion is to stop the breeding of the killer whales in captivity. Let those that are alive continue to live out their years. Because, as humans, we got them into this and we can't just make this problem go away. The only real issue is that SeaWorld the corporation isn't going to stop the breeding because they are making money. But, another thing is that people on here are blaming all of SeaWorld, when its only the political and corporate side that is the problem. I have seen first hand the care and safety for these animals and the trainers. All the trainers at SeaWorld know the risk of their jobs and know that they are putting their life on the line every time they get in the water. But the trainers don't care, if they didn't love their job and these animals, they wouldn't do it. Nobody is making these trainers get in the water with the killer whales, its purely voluntary. I have personal spoke with some killer whales trainers and they all say that they wouldn't change their job for anything. Since the accident with Dawn, the trainers aren't even allowed in the water with the killer whales and the trainers hate it. These animals are the most beautiful and majestic animals that live on this Earth. They have a social obligation that far exceeds that of the human kind. If you think about it, the whales are more advanced than we are, they stick with their families their whole lives, looking out for each other. As humans, it is normal for a child to leave their parents and family at the age of 18 to pursue their life's interest. I feel that most heart breaking thing for me to see was when they we showing the footage from the 80's about capturing the baby killer whales, and when they would move the babies away from their mother and their mothers would grieve and cry out of them. I also became angry when I found out that the whales that we found dead in the nets were filled with rocks and were sunk to the bottom of the ocean. That was just so hard to hear. We as the public need to watch this movie to find out the truth behind what is really going on. And I believe that Tilikum is not a killer!!! He has been through a lot and most of his aggression and frustration comes from what he learned and experienced at a young age. Another thing that upset me was the facts about SeaLand! It was just sad and completely disappointing!!! This movie is a huge eye opener and should be watched by many people.",1385251200,2,3073,4.327556325823224

First, the movie is very one sided.  Having said that, it is important to see what is happening and even the one sided approach can spark conversations that will lead to much needed changes.
Second, Sea World had an opportunity to comment.  They declined.  That speaks volumes to me and leads me to believe they may have been less than honest. I would have liked to have heard their ""side.""
That being said, you cannot completely discount the accounts of the persons who were actually involved with these particular animals.
I believe it is a sincere and horrible tragedy that these animals have been captured at all, ever.
I think this movie is worth a viewing and a conversation.  I gave it 5 stars for the POSSIBILITY that it could have a positive impact on how we see this magnficent animals.  Orcas, also known as ""killer whales"" are actually dolphins.  And to date, there has never been a recorded ""attack"" on humans in the wild.  I think this important to note. In fact, the just the opposite as with smaller species of dolphins. And they have unique ""personalities""... not unlike humans. I am fortunate enough to live in Oregon and not far from where we hosted Keiko (Free Willy) for some time as they attempted to ""rehabilitate"" Keiko enough to release him.  Sadly, that ended tragically. And in Keiko's case, I wish they had never released him.  Clearly he was very deeply imprinted on humans and sought out gentle contact with them even after his release. I believe that while Tilikum and Keiko were both orcas, they are were clearly different in temperament. I don't think you can discount temperament either.  Sadly Tilikum has proven that he has the capcity to harm and the willingness to do so. Further,  I was shocked to hear that the ""trainers"" at Sea World are NOT trained or educated at all.  You can walk off the street and apply to be a ""trainer.""  If you can swim, have an appealing personality and physical appearance, you're in.  No real education, no real training, not even a high school diploma.  Disappointing.  However, to me that puts more of the burden of responsibility squarely on Sea World for the safety of their ""trainers.""
I hope that if you chose to watch this movie that you do so with an open mind and heart.  It's NOT a perfect movie.  I wish there had been more information from the ""other"" side, however, the film still has value in my opinion.",1385164800,6,2596,4.565874730021599

5566920,5,B00BARKZ1G,"When I first saw the trailer for BLACKFISH, I was stunned.  The film looked mesmerizing, an in-depth look into something very few people had probably ever thought about.  I vaguely remember back in 2010, when SeaWorld trainer Dawn Brancheau was killed, but I recall the news reports all saying it was trainer error.  BLACKFISH unveils the truth about what really happened and then throws the curtains aside to expose the psychological damage that is done to killer whales in captivity.

I have to confess that Im not a tree-hugger or animal rights activist, although I do believe we should take care of the earth and treat animals appropriately.  But when I finished watching BLACKFISH, I sat for a while and thought about what I should tell my kids about SeaWorld.  They are wanting to go, but now Im not so sure I want to take them.

This compelling self-argument is the very reason every person reading this review should pick up a copy of BLACKFISH and watch it.  The film is not a preachy PETA promotional video or anything of the sort; it is a vivid and candid look at orcas, the treatment they receive in captivity (from both people and other killer whales), and the mental damage that is done to them by plucking them from the wild.

The film is shot well and presents the information in a no-nonsense yet nonjudgmental fashion.  Several former SeaWorld trainers are interviewed and give their testimonies, along with an OSHA investigator that worked on the SeaWorld court case and many other people involved with the industry.  The result is a moving and powerful piece that will make you think.

BLACKFISH is an amazing film and I highly recommend giving it a look.  Regardless of whether you like orcas or not, you cant help but gain respect for them after watching this documentary.  The film is available now in a variety of formats.",1385078400,2,1846,4.728125

5566924,5,B00BARKZ1G,"The film Blackfish delivers a compelling and thought provoking display, revealing a darker depth of Seaworld to the general public who view the film. A good amount of people can admit to having memories of going to Seaworld at one point in time, either with their parents or their children. The movie reveals the shadowy truth of captivity, lingering out of sight, beneath the veneer of family entertainment and Seaword propaganda. It fist highlights this detail in the very beginning of the film by juxtaposing a recorded 911 emergency call, a call given for the death of a senior trainer at the hands of a whale, with scenes of a sea world public act and a commercial. The juxtaposition serves to underscore the grim divide between reality and sugarcoated fiction created by propaganda and public perception. From the greatest details such as the deaths and incidents of injury to the smallest, with the bottom half of the K in Blackfish shaped like a dorsal fin, the film is a superb example of a documentary film making. The bulk of the films testimonials come from former Seaworld trainers, while their recordings, photos, video clippings and diagrams are mostly from public record. The film and special features cover a host of issues created due to orca captivity. Issues from psychological trauma, encephalitis caused by mosquito bites and a significant decline in the quality of life the orcas experience. It covers many other issues as well, but the overall bottom line is the detrimental effects of keeping orcas confined to a liquid cage over time leads to a constant state of torture. The argument of the film boils down to a single fact, orcas are intelligent beings capable of complex emotions and social groups. As a film it is excellent, as a social statement about the injustice of captivity of intelligent animals it is equally excellent. As an avid film watcher and a fan of documentaries, I would highly recommend this film to anyone interested in seeing the other side of Seaworld or curious to add a new documentary film to their collection. I also have absolutely no reservations whatsoever about giving this film a five star rating. If my long winded review still hasn't convinced you that it's an exceptional film, my advice is to watch the film and make up your own mind.",1384905600,2,2298,4.864795918367347
5566935,5,B00BARKZ1G,"First, a disclaimer: I know Samantha Berg and her husband - they were my late father's acupuncturists. I knew Sam for several months before I knew that she was involved in this film, or that she had been a SeaWorld trainer. I consider them both people of the highest integrity.

I had already read a great deal of the background of the film before seeing it, but I was just not prepared for the impact of the film itself. I'm no wilting flower - I served a tour in Iraq as a medical NCO - but some of the scenes were very hard to watch. Seeing the mother orcas after their calves were taken from them was terrible. Having seen orcas in the wild, I had already been anti-SeaWorld for many years, but I had no idea how bad their treatment of the orcas was.

If you have any doubts about whether orcas should be kept captive for human entertainment and profit, your questions will be answered. This film goes right to the source of first-hand information (the former trainers, who all say in the film that at the time they started, they thought they were doing a good thing - and who all say that they now strongly oppose SeaWorld).

5566937,5,B00BARKZ1G,"Okay, so I'm no fan of peta, and this movie definately lost cool points for featuring those peta posters, but this movie is excellent. I've always been against keeping wild animals in captivity- they are WILD, I mean come on! This movie is great for informing people, and is very well put-together. It is deeply saddening however, that it took so much suffering for so long, for a movie as big as this to come out.

The biggest thing I learned from this film is this- when people make millions and billions, they will put anyone and anything at risk. Not only was Tili treated horribly beyond words, but the amusement industry put so many lives in danger. And that is pathetic. I think everyone is used to seeing animals get the shaft, but to so willingly throw humans under the bus and not only put them in harm's way, but KNOWINGLY keep information from them, that could have saved their lives and impacted the way they acted- to make them safer? That is unforgivable. I'm not even gonna mention scarring any visitors- children, especially- who were there at any of the times when Tili injured/killed people. How, after the first time, could anyone keep this poor, suffering animal alive just for a buck? How, can you continuously threaten the lives of so many people?

This film will not restore your faith in humanity. At. All. It will, however, make you want to do more to end wild animal captivity. I mean, I don't believe in setting domestic pets free or anything crazy like that because they have depended on us for decades and that's just cruel and inhumane (not to mention abandonment... which is against the law), but wild animals should STAY wild. It's bad enough that we are killing the environment, isn't it? Do we have to ruin everything we see?

The caption on the cover is excellent- do not capture what you can not control. If only humans would remember that, the world would be in a much better place. Learn some respect for animals, and this will not happen again.",1384905600,3,1984,4.598870056497175
5566938,1,B00BARKZ1G,"A documentary which only tells one side of the story is clearly meant to promote the film-makers bias. I watched this movie carefully, waiting to hear from trainers who would give ""their side of the story not gonna happen. We simply get the inconsistent and shallow comments of disgruntled employees. I was young and didn't know what I was doing. I believed whatever Sea World told me how was I to know? Then we hear the scientific input: Tilacom was kept in a small metal box which clearly would lead any animal to become aggressive. (I agree) HOWEVER, later in the documentary, he is used for breeding, and this statement is made ""How could Sea World breed an Orca who is genetically aggressive. HUHHH?? Are you kidding me? What a bunch of rot! As proof of his danger, someone snuck into the park and was killed by Tilacom during the night. This docu-dummary goes on to say ""How could they keep such a dangerous animal in the park? Huhhhh Are you kidding me?? A meathead sneaks in and goes for a swim with a killer whale, and this is Sea Worlds fault?? We are told by an ""expert"" that Tilacom ""stripped the man naked and ate his genitals"". I'm sure there is NO possibility that he stripped down by himself. Even the best trainers are NEVER to be in contact without a spotter nearby. We are further lead to believe that the trainers aren't told of the risks involved and that the Orca Show should never happen because people can and do get killed. Huhhh Are you kidding me??? Well then, lets outlaw any activity where someone may be killed. Does anyone really believe the trainers don't know of the risk? This movie has some very good points, especially the first 35-40 minutes. We see true atrocities in the capture of baby Orcas and the small poor facilities at Sea Land- clearly abusive. It then becomes a pure mess of a presentation- it is highly manipulative It is a great film to study the effective use of partial truth in propaganda. Here's the formula- 1. Begin with unbiased INFORMATION and comments that are reasonable and informative 2. Gradually, throw in OPINIONS from the aforementioned ""reasonable"" witnesses. 3. Finally, cue the dark musical score, and present misinformation and bias based upon one-sided reports. Whatever you do, don't present any facts or testimonies from those who disagree with your propaganda. ...
Believe it or not, I am conflicted over the Sea World Orca shows. I'm not a ""Catch Willy and Make Him Do Ticks"" fan; however, I want to hear the whole unbiased story.

5566940,4,B00BARKZ1G,"Seaworld.

Most people have been there, but even if you havent, you know what its all about.  Its been the secondary Disney World for years, decades, deemed the more respectable or educational family vacation spot by many for quite some time.  In fact, Sea World has been my familys personal favorite vacation destination for almost six years now.

Honestly, I did not want to see this film because I didn't want to be swayed away from a place that truly makes me happy.

Still, Blackfish has been garnering so much critical praise and has received such a warm welcome from audiences who have responded to its themes and its depictions of the perceived or assumed real Sea World and so, with all the collective yammering left and right I decided that this was a film I had to see.

Blackfish is honestly a very powerful film.  The depictions of these beloved creatures being torn from their families and being confined in oversized bathtubs is heartbreaking, and the way that their treatment is described and the way that Tilikum is discussed is enough to make anyone swear off an establishment like Sea World in a heartbeat.  The heartfelt confessions from former Sea World trainers, their teary eyed accounts, are very convincing (especially in the first half of the film) and the way that the evidence is built around the case being presented really sways the audience in a particular direction.  To call it manipulative may not be entirely fair, considering that many of the points made regarding animal captivity really ring true and shouldnt be contested, even by people who enjoy Sea World (I mean, even before I saw the film I knew that containing these magnificent creatures for my own enjoyment was morally wrong), but the film does fail to paint a complete picture and really establishes its own agenda rather quickly.

Blackfish is VERY one-sided, and its not ashamed of that fact.

Blackfish tries to get to the root of the Sea World problems by traveling back to the late 70s, when boats were chartered and people were hired to rip infant orcas right out of the wild, separating them from their mothers and shoving them into captivity at an early age, in order to be trained from infancy to be entertainment for families.  This early footage and the testimonials by those involved (who didn't have a direct relationship with Sea World) is very commanding and will move even the most stone-faced to empathy.

Really, this is kidnapping.

From this early point, Sea World and their ethics are cast in a very unfavorable light and the image doesnt get any clearer.  Instead, they go into the attainment of a particular orca, Tilikum, who was attained in the early 80s.  Tilikum has a violent history.  Due to abuse from his own kind (the female orcas who shared his living space were dominant and would attack him mercilessly), he grew frustrated and basically became a ticking timebomb.  Then, while he was an attraction at Sealand, he did the unthinkable.  He killed someone.  From that point forward, Tilikums history is unveiled and his track record of unexpected violence and the supposed deliberate white washing from Sea World in order to keep him (for breeding purposes) is exposed in full light, or at least the light the filmmakers wanted you to see.

My issue with Blackfish is not that I necessarily disagree with them.  In fact, I tend to agree with every stand they are taking, but the film becomes so heavily one-sided that it starts to lose some credibility with me, especially when these former trainers begin to show traits of unbridled bitterness.  I mean, if the circumstances were THAT bad, why did you stay on for so long?  Dont say you did it because no one else would take care of Tilikum, because you obviously weren't taking care of him (and couldnt, from what this film attests to).  When one of the trainers goes on and on about how they would NEVER want their children to think containment of these animals was normal, I started to shake my head.  I mean, these are the same people whose eyes lit up when they were discussing WHY they wanted to job in the first place.  To make claims that the animals only made connections with the trainers for the fish they were tossing in their mouths also felt like a falsified jab, since it kind of contradicted the claims that orcas have a higher sense of emotion than humans and even betrayed the tears that the trainers themselves were spilling over the treatment of these animals.

In other words; Blackfish tries too hard.

Still, the message being relayed is a very important one, and Blackfish is a very powerful and well-made film.  I think that it is a good conversation starter, and that it opens the door for more discussion.  I do wish that Sea World had opted to add to this conversation, and yet again, I don't know if their comments would have been treated with fairness since the agenda of these filmmakers is so obvious.

Now, the real question is; will I take my family back to Sea World?  Honestly, I don't know.  There is no denying that watching these animals flaunt their power before your eyes is breathtaking and really a joy to experience, and the joy it brings to my children is unending.  While the series of events that bred a place like Sea World is questionable and morally reproachable even, we are talking about events that no longer take place (the actual ripping of these animals out of the wild).  Those savage beginnings are no more, and so one has to weigh out those incidents before casting a disdainful eye on an organization that has made obvious growth since the 70s and has even done some very charitable and wonderful work with injured animals, nursing them to health and even releasing them back into the wild.  Sea World is not all evil and it is not all smoke and mirrors.  I wish that balance had been struck, instead of trying to sell Sea World as a giant pack of lies.  Still, Tilikums history speaks for itself, and the whitewashing of his past is cause for concern.  These are truly tragic and obviously cautionary tales, and they should cause someone to really ask themselves how appropriate these parks really are.

So, Im still mulling over my overall thoughts, but the message and the conversation are not only clear but important.",1384819200,2,6265,4.705774518790101
5566941,4,B00BARKZ1G,This is one of those stories I find fascinating that it is not more widely known. I was particularly surprised that SeaWorld kept their own trainers and employees in the dark regarding their potential danger.,1384732800,,208,4.9714285714285715
5566942,3,B00BARKZ1G,"I viewed this documentary on Instant Video. I should say that my overall impression might be a bit biased, as I had read a good deal about this film in advance. I had seen the critics reviews and listened to some of the public commentary at various sites. This perhaps has led to a few somewhat biased and unrealistic expectations that were not fulfilled.

I have always held negative feelings towards the idea of keeping large ocean mammals in captivity. I am not completely against the notion of keeping or displaying captive animals for the purpose of conservation, public educational, or even entertainment. It's just that when dealing with animals the size of Orca's, it stretches reason to conclude that one can provide an environment with enough space and stimulation to adequately mimic their natural environment. The sterile confines of an empty concrete pool are so far removed from the daily life of such an animal that one can conclude that such an environment is not suitable for captivity. In a sense, then, this documentary was preaching to the choir in regards to my personal viewership. I will therefore reserve my comments to the actual merits of the film as a documentary.

Overall, the documentary itself is professionally-made and has enough material to keep your interest. From an emotional standpoint, it is exactly what you would expect to see from such a documentary and the director relies heavily on the empathy of the viewer to get the point across. And this is where I think the film falls short--both in what it does and what it doesn't do.

In my opinion, the film relies too heavily on emotion as the primary ingredient and falls short on facts.  There are tidbits of information that are provided by a number of the participating scientists. However, I was hoping for more information than  was provided, For example, we are told about the collapsed dorsal fin that plagues captive Orcas, but are not provided with any information on what negative effects this has on the whale's health or ability to swim.  The trainers also provide little in the way of information and appear to be there as emotional props. They readily share their intimate feelings on the subject but provide little in the way of information on the day-to-day activity of a Seaworld trainer interacting with orcas.  We only hear about the undesirable aspects of the job.

There is also the anthropomorphizing element that pervades the film. A neurologist is brought in to tell us that Orcas are complex emotional creatures with a wide range of complex thoughts and feelings, just like us, perhaps even more so. Apparently, one subject was even examined inside a CT Scan. In a nuthsell, we are told that these aquatic mammals are just like us in almost every way, except for the fins and blowhole. The neurologist seems to be implying that any behavior that resembles the result of human volition equates to the same in the animal itself. The truth is, any truly objective scientist would tell us that we simply don't know what is going on inside the mind of an animal when talking about emotions and their relation to specific instances of behavior. In short, nobody can accurately read the thoughts of another being--no matter how intelligent that being may be. Why did the whale Tilikum decide to pull Dawn Brancheau into the water on that specific day and time and specific place? The truth is, nobody can say with certainty. All anyone can do is offer personal opinion, or at best, informed conjecture.

There are also a number of contradictions in the film. In an interview, a trainer tells us that Tilikum should not be used as a stud animal due to his aggressive nature. The inference seems to be that Tilikum has a genetic predisposition to aggression. However, throughout the film, it is implied that the aggressive behavior of Tilikum is due to the neurotic tendencies brought about by years of captivity, deprivation and abuse. Which left me somewhat confused. Which is it? Is Tilikum genetically predisposed to these incidents of aggressive and hostile behavior or was it brought on by the environmental factors just mentioned?  Again, I think any reasonable scientist would conclude that we just don't know. Animal behavior is not an exact science. There are no certainties when dealing with animals.

Given the unpredictable nature of wild animals, one can readily reach a sound conclusion, via common sense: regardless of whether or not it is ethical to keep Orcas in captivity, it is probably not a good idea to get in the water with a penned-up six-ton Orca. We need OSHA to tell us this? One cannot know with certainty its mental state at all times, and when a six-ton Orca decides to go off, the result isn't going to be pretty. Therefore, regarding the incidents with trainers, I see it as simply the result of the unpredictable nature of a wild animal. If you play with fire, you are eventually going to get burned. Things may go fine 99% of the time, but is that 1%  worth the risk? Apparently a lot of Seaworld trainers believe so.

Overall, the film had too much of a preachy undertone to it for my tastes--enough to be a bit irritating at times. Right from the start, the director pulled out the trump card of emotions, as if it was assumed that the audience would be too dumb to figure things out on their own, using just facts and a more tempered approach. It was like we were being told what we should believe, not what we should conclude. The end result appears to come across as an attempt by the director to shame and enrage the viewer into never daring to attend Seaworld ever again.

Distinctly absent from the film is any realistic and practical solution to the problem of captive Orcas. Simply calling for an end to captivity and an end to Seaworld makes for a good rally cry but does not represent a practical solution to the issue. What do we do with these animals after the closure? If you simply let them go, they will likely meet a quick death in the wild. There is mention of a 'Sea Pen' for the whales to live out their lives. But who will pay to implement and maintain such a structure? Nobody offers any realistic proposals. The film simply ends.

The biggest fault of Blackfish, therefore, is that it represents a shallow play on emotions, a rally cry that falls well short of addressing the really important question -- where do we go from here? Lost in all of the tears and outrage is the fact that when it's all said and done, the Orcas will still remain. Although I sympathize with a good number of the opinions presented in the film, I find it to be at times too naive and short-sighted. It is very effective in casting Seaworld as a villain, but not effective in providing any realistic options for the Orcas -- options that are tenable and practical.",1384732800,17,6806,4.707563025210084

Sea World wants you to believe that the public would not care about wild orcas's if we didn't have these 'representatives' in captivity. That is such a lame argument. We do not have blue or humpbacks in captivity do we? Yet there are millions of people to advocate for them. There is a group of people who go fight with fisherman for them. Ever heard of whale wars?

5566964,4,B00BARKZ1G,"BLACKFISH is an important documentary about the lives of killer whales in captivity.  I found the documentary a good but not great warning that whales are not meant to live outside their natural enviroments and when they are placed in parks for the entertainment of humans tragedy can happen.  This film focuses in on one of the most recent tragedies of the death of a Sea World Orlando trainer who was killed by an Orca who had previous behavioral problems.

I am a fan of these types of documentaries because the most important voice an individual can express is in what they consume or, in general, what we spend our money on.  If we continue to go to parks such as the Sea Worlds we are participating in the continuation of herding young whales and dolphins into enviroments that are unnatural and dangerous for both the trainers and the mammals they train.

The only fault I found in this documentary was that is was not harsh enough in its portrayal of the effects these type of shows have on the animals.  I felt there should have been more history and more facts that really argue that aquarium parks need to outlaw, not only the Orca whale shows, but also the dolphin shows, as they are seriously inhumane and cause mental stress and illness to the creatures who are confined to small quarters and live out their lives in a depressive and hurtful enviroments.

I felt very sorry for the trainer(s) that were injured and brutally killed by dysfunctional killer whales but I felt sorrier for the animals themselves who are at the mercy of people whose priority is making money at any cost.  There are other ways to show young people what treasures every animal on the planet is and it is not by making some of them clowns in a sick water circus.",1384387200,4,1752,4.557324840764331

I went to Sea World in Florida when I was a child. I remember the awe that stayed with me since a naive child, so when I was in San Diego a few years back as a mid-life adult I checked out that location. I noticed during the Shamu show that the male trainer was hustling to get the fish and dump it in the whale's mouth. I turned to my husband and said, ""I guess that fish gives the whale something to chew on instead of the human!"" From what I saw, nothing in this movie shocks me. Just check out the ticket price for dinner with Shamu. Wow.

There is not one reasonable person that can deny what these whales are going through. Do a google maps search for ""Sea World Drive, San Diego, CA"" (or the FL location) and look at the aerial shot where you can see the whales in their tanks. We get cabin fever if we are stuck in our house for a period of time. Imagine what it would be like to be that size of a creature in that tiny of a living space. When I visited San Diego, with all the wacko Hollywood animal rights activists I was hoping the whales were kept out in the ocean and lured in for the shows, but sadly they were not. Not everyone has the ability to feel for another person or animal, which explains the poor reviews on this film (did they even watch it?) There is no way you could visit Sea World, look at the body language of the whales and think ""they're happy!"" They absolutely are not. A falling fin is not normal. You'd have to be brain dead to not think they go crazy in these tanks. There is a way of doing it right and time has shown that Sea World is not interested in caring about the state of mind of the Orcas. They took her baby away from her, cold turkey. They didn't put the baby in the pool next to her and wean her from the mother over time, they just ""did it."" WTF is wrong with you if you think that's okay? Only the self-absorbed will shrug it off. We wouldn't do that to a dog and its puppies (if we cared about their mental state). I'm embarrassed for the human race - we should know better.

The movie itself was very good. The flow of it, the footage they collected was incredible (even though you could tell they matched up footage that didn't represent the true storyline but it helped you follow the story better.) I was expecting a so-so documentary that left me regretting most of the time/life I wasted watching it, like most other documentaries.

Though decried by some as a willfully distorted vendetta against Sea World, it seems to me the film is fair in challenging Sea World's treatment of animal rights issues  precisely BECAUSE Sea World has traditionally had a sterling reputation in the mainstream. ""Blackfish"" is asking society to question and re-evaluate our assumptions about the ""righteous"" public image Sea World spends millions and millions of dollars each year trying to cultivate. This film challenges Sea Worlds public image by changing the frame of things--past events and current practices/philosophies--so that we may see a set of facts and events through the lens of a different interpretation of those facts and events. Far from being propaganda, this documentary is cutting edge investigative journalism at its finest.  Some criticize the film as ""sensationalized"" due to its graphic depiction of some of the incidents discussed.  But far from using the death of a trainer to sensationalize the issues in graphic detail, I consider this instead a bold work willing to go beyond all the Mickey Mouse bullcrap to start an honest conversation even though the conversation involves very unpleasant elements most people would rather not think about.

Seaworld spends hundreds of thousands of dollars a year in wildlife rehabilitation releasing the rescued animals back to the wild if at all possible.  Their efforts have directly led to development of more effective treatments for exotic diseases that have literally saved thousands of animals.  The level of care provided by Seaworld employees is exemplary all the wile being paid by Seaworld to rescue these animals.

Everyone has their own opinion and I'm sure this movie will get a lot of crap but I think it's very enlightening.

That isn't to say that there seems to be any credible counterargument that I've heard elsewhere which isn't brought up here, but I would have appreciated the addition of such statistics as normal whale roaming ranges and such that I've heard elsewhere into this film.  As it stands, the documentary is mostly an emotional one, though there isn't anything much more convincing than the trainers' own opinions.  The film progresses very well, and is never dull.

What I found most interesting is how quick Sea World will blame the trainers in the event that they are killed.  Somehow it is always their fault.  In many of the cases, you can tell the trainers loved working for Sea World, but, upon death, their company turns its back on them and demonizes them.  Unfortunately, that is corporate America for you.

My only problem with the documentary is that it is very one-sided and does not contain any representatives from Sea World to counter some of the arguments.  That is not the fault of the filmmakers though.  Sea World decline to make any comments.

This is the most powerful and eye opening documentary of this kind I've seen in the last 5 years. I'm glad the former trainers participated in this film and woke up to the insanity. But as stated, ""the humans/trainers were the most well-trained animal in this scenario.""  The accepted so much and were so blind to obvious abuses. I'm sure there were people outside the industry who were speaking of the cruelty to animals and danger of Orcas in captivity way back when, so these trainers were definitely either brainwashed or preconditioned by the general mis-education and tactics in society.  What kinds of humans follow orders and do what their told even in the face of obvious abuse of some other being and eminent endangerment to themselves, but the very well trained ones.

5566994,5,B00BARKZ1G,"I watched Blackfish seven times over this last weekend and cried every single time.  I was mesmerized, traumatized, heartbroken, stunned.  I learned a world of valuable information about Orcas that I never knew before.  Sea World isn't teaching it.  EVERY SINGLE PERSON ON THIS PLANET SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO WATCH IT... (including age-appropriate children...especially age-appropriate children.  In a few years, they'll be the rich and famous and influential entertainers and senators and members of the House and the White House.  Unless, of course, there are enough of those kinds of people with that power who can get it done right... HOW ABOUT NOW...? AND NOT WAIT UNTIL OUR KIDS GROW UP.

  If I had known back in the 70s, when I took my daughter as a toddler and an elementary school student to Sea World once a week or more, what I know now... and if I had the power and fame to legislate Orcas and dolphins in captivity as criminal, and you evil, ignorant, money-greedy administrators of the ""marine parks""  (SEALAND!??  REALLY??) Sealand is a segment in Black Fish and is now closed.  It was a  poor-man's version of Sea World... where the Orcas were inhumanely, crazy-wicked-bad 'taken such good care of. Can you hear my sarcasm?  Every man who has ever used these breathtaking awesome highly emotive and intelligent creatures to make money should all serve prison terms:  confined for 25 years in a bathtub.... inside a prison cell.  You can get out of it for a half hour 'show' every afternoon walking on your hands in the prison yard.

The documentary is carefully, exquisitely, professionally, compellingly produced.  I've watched it seven times and have been brought to tears every single time.  What kind of monsters are you humans who are so egregiously abusing and neglecting the Orcas and the dolphins.  These whales come from their own families.  They speak their own languages.  The young NEVER leave their mothers' sides. NEVER. Until the mother dies.  A lot like how humans live with their own families and cultures and languages on the land.

It's not good enough to set them all free.  It's the best we can do at this point, and it is truly not good enough.  They desperately need to be reunited with the pods from which you kidnapped them.  Others, like Tilly, who are old and sick and have already given their best years and made a gazillion dollars for you will need APPROPRIATE care.  A VERY VERY VERY BIG (is a 100-mile square big enough...?)in the ocean.  Preferably with others who would/could socialize with him instead of viciously raking and shunning him.

Those of you who have been in the upper layers of management, and have made the most money are greedy for more and so sociopathologically lacking in empathy and morals are no doubt too lazy and uncaring to even make an attempt to find the RIGHT (original)families for each youngster!

What if somebody came and stole your three little kids and placed each one of them separately in another family; another country; another language and confined them in a bathtub for the rest of their lives?

And the COVER-UPS out of the mouths of Sea World every time a trainer gets injured or killed?  Shame.  Shame all over all of you. Own it. Stand up and own it and tell us you're sorry and that you're going to begin the process of returning as many as possible back into the wild.  NOW.  (With the guidance and leadership of way more than several of the very best people who can be called experts in the species.)  You executives and administrators are beyond the pale.  You blame their injuries and their deaths, publicly, on the very CHILDREN you cheaply hire to train and show the creatures (ages from what... 16 to maybe early 30s? Most late teens and twenties.  America has fallen too far from grace.

I commend Black Fish's producers and research specialists and trainers for contributing.  You all did an outstanding job.  Absolutely excellent.  Thank you.  And thank YOU, CNN, for having the courage to air it not just once, but I am now watching it for the seventh time over this last week.  And still crying.  And praying that God will intervene.  Soon.  He gave us dominion over the animals, and you all have done an exceptionally horrifying job of it.  There's a gigantic amount of PTSD to go around at this point.  GO.  NOW. Immediately: To your children who have loved these wondrous kin of ours trapped in tiny cement swimming pools at all the Sea Worlds...  to your priest, preacher, church and God and apologize and ask for forgiveness from all American people, and then spend the rest of your lives, and no doubt your gazillion dollars, doing your BEST to make it right for every single Orca and dolfin in captivity.

5566995,5,B00BARKZ1G,"This is one of the hardest movies I've sat through this year. It is also one of the films that you must see this year.

There has been much controversy from Seaworld claiming that the film is virtually exaggerating their facts. I don't think this has helped the theme park at all, and I wish more people had seen this to see that there is so much evidence supporting 'Blackfish's argument. It is gripping, moving and frustrating in the strongest of ways.

This is documentary film-making at it's strongest. There is also the argument that you don't get a balanced argument, and that the film lacks Seaworld's side of the story. But they cover the ground pretty perfectly in their absence, they virtually get every other aspect, whether it be the transcript from the courtroom, or the trainers, or the original capturers of the orcas. This film will affect you emotionally, and will probably change your view of killer whale performances.

It doesn't try to manipulate you, even though that is the point of the movie, but it just shows you the facts, and the footage that they have, and it gives you an argument. And I definitely agree with that argument. The film leaves you feeling a little angry and sad.

I admittedly went to Seaworld when I was a child. But when you view it from this perspective, it suddenly becomes ludicrous. It reminds you that these are real animals, being forced to perform to people, so that they can eat their sweets and see the funny looking whale perform. It's crazy.

I actually found it hard to watch at times, and it just completely captivated me. It is one of the best documentaries I've seen in years, and is definitely one of my top films of 2013.

5567001,5,B00BARKZ1G,"This haunting, brilliant documentary is explained in detail by other reviewers here, so I will skip the backstory and make a plea for action.

All of us have the power to put Sea World OUT OF BUSINESS forever simply by refusing to patronize the sea parks. I hope everyone who views this film will make an effort to spread the word and get others to view it too. Then think about it.  And choose to never EVER again buy tickets to these kinds of exploitive amusement parks.

Don't be mesmerized by the glamorous lies, spin and SeaWorld commercials. It's not about ""educating the public, conserving the environment, and supporting wildlife"" as SeaWorld claims.  It's about their history of disregard for the animals stolen from the wild all over the planet, deceit, and trading of trainer safety for the benefit of the billion dollar industry and almighty profits.

Take your kids somewhere else. Teach them about nature in ways that respect the glory of the wilderness, and the intelligence, and natural beauty, of the wildlife that still share the planet with us.

As sad as it is, the real tragedy is not just that trainers like Dawn Brancheau were killed. At least, those delusional trainers made the choice (for whatever reason) to go into those tanks and foolishly transform the splendid, regal orca into nothing but a trained circus clown for profit. The baby whales, like Tilikum, never had a choice when barbarically ripped from their mother's side and subjected to unnatural cage life, solitude, hopeless deprivation, semen pumping for extreme profit, and pathetic daily barking for his fish dinner.

To imprison orcas-- animals of extreme intelligence and emotional depth-- just to amuse your kids for an day on your vacation is morally repugnant and down right disgusting.

Yes, free the whales. You don't need to cry out for a ban. Just don't buy a ticket ever again.

THAT will ultimately free all the imprisoned whales and freak shows like SeaWorld will be looked upon in future years with horror... as primitive, barbaric and crude chambers of torture and shame... and our ancestors will be shocked that we ever had the extreme audacity to exploit them for money in this horrid, heartbreaking way.

Please show your finer humanity. Let's ALL shut down these parks forever! You can change the world with the power of your wallet.

For a real eye-opener, do a search for ""The Orca Project"" online and read about Tilikum's tragic current living conditions now that he is banned to extreme isolation at SeaWorld and see if you can ever believe anything they say again. Though he's too damaged to ever live in the wild again, there are online petitions to pressure SeaWorld to release Tilikum to a supervised ocean sea pen to spend out his days with more dignity and space.

After watching this disturbing documentary on the treatment of Tilikum, I don't wonder why he kills his trainers, I wonder why he doesn't kill all of them.

He was snatched as a baby from his mother and forced to spend most of the day in a tiny black metal box at Sea Land. He was attacked by female whales, his skin shredded. At Sea Land he killed a female trainer so the owner closed the park.

Then Tilikum was bought by Sea World. There he killed another trainer, and probably a male visitor, who was found dead floating on Tilikum's back. He has injured many. Tilikum is viciously attacked by female whales so he spends most of his life just sitting in a tiny, shallow pool. Another sick aspect of his captivity is the use of his sperm to make more Orcas to sell to be exploited. I don't even want to say here how they obtain it. The footage of that in this documentary is truly revolting.

I was angered and heartbroken to learn about some of the atrocities that have occurred to these animals in captivity. I'm afraid I will no longer be able to visit any marine animal park that keeps killer whales in captivity. I understand that there was a time and place for it, to want to learn about these creatures, and captivity was a way to learn about them. However, now that we know the things we know about their social and emotional nature, there is no justification for continuing to keep and breed them in captivity.  If you don't think you agree with me, you need to see this documentary.

5567005,1,B00BARKZ1G,"1st off, I have never been to Sea World; and I DO NOT approve of, nor condone, the capture of wild animals (or mammals) for entertainment purposes.

That said, this is the most ridiculous and dishonest ""documentary"" I've seen in quite a while.

""Sea World"" is going to threat this the same as anyone, or any other 'entity' would, in an event where a WILD ANIMAL (in this case, Wild Mammal) attacks &/or kills someone... There's no ""great conspiracy"" here; and to suggest otherwise is obscene.  Using anyone's death, to promote your personal agenda, regardless of the facts, is obscene, no matter how you try to skew it.

A woman is dead... it is what it is... it happens, in every conceivable ""entity"", PUBLIC & PRIVATE -- THEY'RE WILD ANIMALS/MAMMALS -- it's just way more common for the Public Entities (aka: Zoos)... but they all behave & blame, the same way, afterward: ""Trainer error"", or whatever... because, as these dummies have proven, yet again, some people just can't accept the truth, no matter how how simple that truth is, so they have to blame the deceased, to keep from being sued by an idiot, litigious society &/or family members, who want to place blame everywhere, except where belongs.

Moreover, 99% of everyone interviewed in this ""film"" who talk about the ""traumatized psychosis"" of these KILLER whales -- are not qualified, nor schooled, in the psychology of ANY species... And none, have clearly conducted a formal or informal psychoanalytical study of a whale's behavior before, during, and after ""capture"" -- Therefore, 99% of everything presented in this ""documentary"" as ""fact"" by the FEW semi-qualified to speak on such a matter, is still pure speculation & conjecture.
-- And the people who SHOULD have been interviewed, weren't... or... those interviews didn't reflect the pre-determined ""message"" the Director wanted to put out, so they were discarded & left out of the, LOL, ""documentary"".

That said, yes, common sense would dictate they (captured 'wilds') COULD & MAY VERY WELL BE ""scarred"" by the events... But there's NO evidence the Orcas ARE, nor, any other ""captured"" animal, mammal, reptile, etc.

However, COMMON SENSE would also dictate, that these Trainers CHOSE A DANGEROUS PROFESSION, AND SOMETIMES, THAT DANGER BECOMES REALITY -- IT HAPPENS -- THEY KNOW THIS GOING IN & CHOOSE TO DO IT ANYWAY... JUST LIKE POLICE OFFICERS & FIRE FIGHTERS (only the former's is a million times more certain)!!

Clearly, these people made their choice to work with these Dangerous Animals/Mammals... You don't blame the Animal/Mammal for the accident(s) because ""they're just animals and don't know any better"", or whatever... Well, you can't blame the ""entity"" either, because THEY DID NOT FORCE THE TRAINER TO BE A TRAINER, TO WORK THERE, etc.; and no matter how ""humanely"" a wild animal/mammal is captured, transported, and housed... it is, and will always be, (in this case, a LARGE), DANGEROUS, LETHAL THING... and no amount of ""training"" will remove that aspect of its nature!!
-- I swear, it's like all notions of PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY are as foreign as Orcas are to land!

And the quote, ""There's no record of any Orca being violent in the wild"", was by far the most ludicrous of the countless, insane ramblings, offered up.  -- THEY'RE CARNIVOROUS (""KILLER"") WHALES YOU IDIOT!!!
Plus, as if you can honestly compare the millions of hours of CONSTANT observation done in captivity, to A FEW HOURS of GLIMPSED ""activity"" out in the open ocean, as an actual comparison-argument... LOL; but they try, along with every other conceivable way, to mislead, and lie, rather than have an OPEN AND HONEST DEBATE about whether we should/shouldn't have captive 'wilds' at all (in 'Public' or 'Private' entities).
-- Personally, I would be 100% fine if every 'wild' was returned to the wild, set free, and all Zoos, etc., were closed entirely/permanently... but that will never happen... And these attacks, while extremely rare, will continue.

Regardless, this is without question, the most insane, ideologically inept, maddening, and brain-numbing piece of crap, this year... possibly, of all time.",1382140800,38,4127,5.081240768094535
5567006,5,B00BARKZ1G,"I watched this film knowing very little about the behind the scenes about whale capturing and exploitation of the whales for monetary gain. I kind of figured they weren't as comfortable as they were before they were captured and forced to live in tiny pools compared to a mega huge ocean. After watching this film, it cemented my opinion of never going to seaworld or any aquatic park that's similar to it.

First of all these are killer whales. Killer being the keyword. Nobody said they're friendly or trainable to the extend that they won't harm anyone, which unfortunately was the case in this film. I'm not blaming the trainers for being attacked. I blame the company that set up the situation to make money off of these animals. The lies and excuses they give throughout the movie is mind numbing. The interviews the former trainers gave was informative and seemingly more truthful than the proponents of keeping killer whales captive. Of course seaworld wouldn't be a part of the film. When a company does this in a documentary, it tells me that they have stuff to hide, or possibly are in more legal trouble than letting on. If they're worried about editing, they can do what Dana White of the UFC does. He has his own camera and crew filming at the same time, since espn distorted an interview he had done previously, but I digress.

I like animals. I don't love animals and I'm not a member of PETA or anything like that. I like nature, nature programs and seeing animals in their natural environment. There's something really wrong with having these huge whales in these small pools and it makes me feel sick to my stomach with the way the animals are treating each other since they're trapped. If they kill each other in the wild, it's different. It's because of territory or maybe another reason, who knows, but that's nature. When you put these multi-ton animals into a cage, it's like a wrestling match and the weakest gets hurt, as shown in the movie (I don't want to get into it too much as I don't want to ruin it for anyone who hasn't seen the film). As we speak, sharks are eating seals, eagles are hitting goats off of mountains, and snakes are killing baby mice. It's nature and that's what they're programmed to do it. What they're not programmed to do is live in super small spaces like these whales. Most zoos are pretty good at giving animals enough space to roam and be themselves, with a couple of exceptions. I know not all zoos are 100% perfect, but I know people are keeping a close on them.

Seaworld and other similar water attractions treat these animals like crap and expect them to play by the rules. a 200 pound trainer is no match for a 6 ton whale that has taken all that it's going to take, especially when you take away it's mate and children. I really wish there was a ban on these kinds of places. I know kids can like them, but it's because they don't understand and see what's really wrong here. The only way I can help out is by never ever going to any of these places and guiding my children to stay away from them.

Watch this film because it's a great film and it exposes the cruelty to these animals. Free all of the killer whales back into their own habitat. Not just for the safety of the trainers, but for the sake of keeping killer whales in their own habitat where they belong.",1380672000,37,3332,4.466338259441708
5567007,5,B00BARKZ1G,"These are animals. No matter how well trained or loved from cat, dog or whale things will happen unexpectedly. I found this to be interesting and have never really been fond of zoos, not that they are necessarily bad, but the boredom of the animals drives them crazy. Through this documentary and there a similar one Fall from Freedom, it's quite terrible how they go about the capture of the wild animals and if you watch or read enough about the specie itself. These are pretty bad conditions to keep something intelligent in and their families.

I'd recommend this a watch. It's not a happy doc for sure.",1380067200,14,607,4.62037037037037

5567009,4,B00BARKZ1G,"I eagerly awaited the release of Blackfish after having read the book ""Death at Seaworld"".  I was hoping that the movie would be as riveting as the book, but it wasn't.  Maybe it was because the book was so good, and Blackfish didn't go into the same level of depth as the book (although I don't think it could have).  Maybe because you didn't hear from scientist Naomi Rose in Blackfish and she was such a vital part of the book.  Whatever the reason, Blackfish falls just a little but short, although I think that the movie and book complement each other nicely.

The movie is striking in several ways:

1. How it shows the small tank that the whales were kept in on 'off hours' (barely enough for them to turn around in)
2. Its use of news footage combined with interviews to tell the story
3. How it portrayed the devastating death of Dawn Brancheau, the trainer who most recently was killed by the killer whale

After seeing Blackfish, one wonders how all the trainers interviewed actually worked there, given what was happening.  Several of them seemed quite oblivious and took SeaWorld's word for what was going on with the whales, rather than investigating what was known about the whales as they lived in the wild.  It is gratifying to see how so many of them realized what was happening and left SeaWorld, but one also wonders how anyone could still work there given what we know about these amazing creatures.  It would seem that money and ignorance plays a large part in those trainers that still work at SeaWorld.

The other interesting (and in some way unexplainable) thing about Blackfish is how little the family of Dawn Brancheau appears in the movie and how non-chalant they are, particularly at the end.  I believe it is her sister at the end who talks about how the family will be celebrating her life, etc, and she (or any other members of her family) say nothing against the organization that led to the death of Dawn.  Both my wife and I were astonished that we didn't hear more anger or disdain about what happened.  As far as we were concerned, SeaWorld should rename one of its parks after Dawn Brancheau.

After watching Blackfish, and reading ""Death at SeaWorld"", you can only come to one conclusion - killer whales do not belong in any form of captivity whatsoever.  To continue to use and exploit these intelligent animals is tantamount to kidnapping and torture.  Unfortunately, and the movie alludes to this, money trumps morals in this instance, so because killer whales make money, they will probably always be showcased as they are.

As for me, though, neither I nor my family will ever take part in one of the Shamu shows, and I hope that others follow suit.  If Blackfish turns just one person against Sea World's atrocities, it will have been a success.",1379289600,19,2791,4.6361788617886175
5567010,5,B00BARKZ1G,"I am giving Blackfish five stars not because it is the best-made documentary I've seen, but because everyone should see it.  I teach college students and I often show The Cove; starting this November I will also be showing this movie.  I often hear students (and others) complain that a documentary is biased, as though that is somehow against the rules.  Of course Blackfish is biased; most docs are.  Even The March of the Penguins betrays some pro-penguin bias; we don't notice because, hey, who doesn't like penguins?  Plus, of course, there are no humans on camera interfering with them.

This movie is rather graphic for children, but I will allow my 10yo to see it.  The whale penis was not as disturbing to me as the whale blood, but if blood is the price of entertainment then I think we should all know about it.

The film's argument is not quite as tightly structured as I might like, but I was fascinated and emotionally involved, and I certainly came away convinced.  (Well, maybe I already belonged to the choir.)  There is a Sea World in my city, and, although I have always been uncomfortable with the confinement of animals, I didn't absolutely refuse to go there until I saw The Cove.  It's hard for me to imagine anyone seeing Blackfish and  still buying tickets.",1378080000,99,1282,4.648888888888889
5567011,5,B00BARKZ1G,"""Blackfish"" (2013 release; 85 min.) takes a critical look at killer whales being kept in captivity, and the devastating effects on the orcas AND their trainers. The movie opens with the news in 2010 that veteran orca trainer Dawn Brancheau has been killed at an incident at the SeaWorld water amusement park in Orlando (we don't see any footage of it). From there the documentary goes on to show the beginnings of orca whaling to bring them into those water amusement parks. In the early 90s a young but rapidly growing orca named Tilikum is involved in ""an incident"" at a small park in Victoria, BC, after which the owner decides to shut down the park, and Tilikum is bought by SeaWorld in Orlando. I won't tell you how it all connects to the tragic death of Brancheau, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first and foremost, this is a shocking and yet riveting documentary, one of the likes you don't get to see very often. Second, the movie interviews a bunch of former SeaWorld orca trainers who, with years of wisdom, now decry the multi-million dollar industry that has become these water amusement parks with killer whales putting on a ""show"". Their point of view is clear. Third, there are no reposts from anyone at SeaWorld in the movie (in the end credits, we are told that ""SeaWorld did not respond to multiple requests for an interview"". Last, but certainly not least, towards the end of the movie, we are shown a number of graphic videos of ""when orcas go wild"" and viewer beware, they are not for the faint of heart, but at the same time, they bring home the point that keeping these killer whales in captivity is just wrong, and can lead to disastrous results.

This documentary made a huge splash (pardon the punt) at the Sundance film festival earlier this year. It just opened this weekend at my local art-house theatre here in Cincinnati, and the showing tonight where I saw this at was PACKED, I am happy to say. This movie proves once again that ""facts are stronger than fiction"", reason why I love well-made documentaries like this one so much. Bottom line: this is a shocking and revolting documentary that is simply a must see. ""Blackfish"" is HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1377216000,34,2238,4.648989898989899
5567012,3,B00BARKZ1G,"Blackfish mostly follows the story of Tilikum, an orca captured in the 80s when he was a mere pup, and his rise to fame and infamy within Sealand of the Pacific and, eventually, SeaWorld.  Known to be involved in the deaths of three trainers, Tilikum's story is tragic both for the whale and also for the trainers, some of whom did not truly know the dangers of working with him.  Thrown into this mix are some anecdotal stories about other killer whales, the number of ""accidents"" involving killer whales and trainers and, for some random reason, a whale's sexual organ on display.  I know Blackfish has received a lot of positive press and reviews, but honestly it left me feeling pretty nonchalant.  Not about the travesty that happens to these whales or the tragedy befalling the trainers.  That obviously hit home.  But the documentary seemed all over the place and wasn't really put together very well to make a cohesive whole.  Random parts of the film seem pulled directly from YouTube, and just when it seems like it's making a point, it veers off into randomness; for example, for no real reason we go from the tragedies happening to seeing a pod of whales in the ocean attacking a sea lion.  I didn't really see how this added much to the main thrust of the story, other than to pad the already slim running time.  Additionally, while they tried to make a point of showing how the aggressive Tilikum is used to breed for most of the whales in captivity, I don't see why they had to focus on his, er, erupting member.  I now know that it looks like a tentacle.  So, you know.  I learned something.

My biggest problem with the documentary is that I left not really knowing more than when I went in (erupting member, aside).  The other problem is that it feels cloyingly attached to appeal to our emotions.  How anyone could watch the footage of a whale calling out to her young that's been ripped from her and not feel pathos is beyond me.  And that's exactly what the documentarians are counting on.  It sometimes feels manipulative.  But I say this not as someone who's on the side of SeaWorld, but as someone who definitely agrees that these beautiful creatures should be able to roam free and not be forced to do ridiculous tricks.  I just don't like to feel like I'm being manipulated.

At one point, the documentary tells the viewer that SeaWorld was asked repeatedly for interviews for Blackfish, but they were (here's a shocker) turned down.  Obviously, SeaWorld knows that the documentary is about lambasting them, so why would they submit to it?  Yet, it's played off as if the directors are trying to be fair and balanced; Fox News follows a similar tactic.  Look, Blackfish is a one-sided documentary, telling its viewers things they probably already know: animals in captivity = bad; animals in captivity + interacting with humans = worse.  Worse for the humans interacting with an animal that can't really be domesticated and worse for the animals who have been robbed their freedom.  The best thing the documentary does is show real human emotion for these majestic creatures, often showing how social and family-focused they are.  It's just so jittery in its narrative focus, bouncing all over the place, that in the end it doesn't really make a concrete point, other than one that we can probably reach on our own.  I enjoyed it and I think it's worth watching, but I don't think it's constructed as well as it could have been.",1376956800,8,3454,4.666115702479339

8564917,5,B00BARKZ1G,The way the trainers owned what they did and were honest during the documentary is admirable.  It was poetic that they ended the movie by viewing the orcas in their natural habitat and were moved deeply.  This issue is so multilayered because humans have changed the ecosystem so much that it takes large amounts of money to protect habitat that orcas can use.  Maybe seaworld is so entertaining that they still can raise all the money they tout during the shows without ever having orcas in captivity again?,1530576000,,508,4.75
8564918,5,B00BARKZ1G,This movie will make you think about how we are causing issues with nature by capturing and trying to make intelligent free creatures perform tricks for our amusement.  I found this movie to be provocative and believable. Instead of blaming the whale for attacking or killing trainers maybe we should be asking ourselves why we captured Tilikum and took him away from his mother and POD and subjected him to torture in a tank all in the name of our amusement and to make money for corporations.  So glad to see so many corporations and stars coming out to condemn the treatment of whales and other creatures at parks.  They need to be free!!!,1529884800,,642,4.614035087719298

This documentary tells the story of a captured Orca, from being a baby whale to adulthood. Totally unacceptable to tear the highly distraught baby away from its desperately crying mother. How depraved to keep such a gorgeous animal in a circus atmosphere. When will we stop enslaving other creatures for our entertainment and financial gain? Let's not let SeaWorld off the hook: While no longer performing, the Orcas are still in captivity, in an unnatural environment. Sea World is still planning to use the Orcas as a money maker, one way or another. Sea world has a long way to go to act in the interest of the whales rather than their own financial gain.
