8345423,4,B001V2GGPY,Don't listen to other reviewers on here. There is a dvd version of this dvd. I bought it. I was fortunate to find one when i bought this for my mom. The vhs and dvd are combined in reviews on Amazon. This item is extremely rare and out of print if you are fortunate to find a dvd buy one. I grew up hearing yanni because of my mom. She loved this dvd. You can tell it was made from the vhs. Too much black around the square. I wish it was remade in widescreen blu ray. Zooming in is berter. It's still awesome. Combining his famous music with aerial videos of Greece much like the aerial footage you see on pbs and the smithsonian channel. I don't think his narration is overdone over his music it adds. There are dvds and blurays of his concerts too I bought all of those for my mom as well. This dvd is awesome. My mom thinks so too but it gets one less star then perfection for fading in and out between scenes for my mom who has poor eye sight in old age it freaks her out that it's her and she is seeing blurry no one else is and gives her a headache and she has to close her eyes for a few seconds in those parts. Great all around video that needs to be redone in high-definition and taking out the blurring between scenes part. If it had those this video would almost be perfect.,1483142400,,1286,4.02734375

It is absolutely stunning to watch!
Lets you see totally inspiration to his music!",1379289600,,115,4.8
8345426,2,B001V2GGPY,I expected to see more concert and some arial views of greece with some commentary not talk the whole time. He finally shuts up at the credits. It was very distracting to hear him talk the whole time over the music. I didn't want a travel agent video of greece.,1363651200,,261,4.24
8345427,5,B001V2GGPY,I purchased this as a gift for my father in law. He truly enjoys Yanni and has watched it over and over. Thanks!,1334534400,,112,3.9130434782608696
