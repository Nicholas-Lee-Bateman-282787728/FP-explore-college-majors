I designed and created this instructional DVD for computer novices. No previous computer experience is necessary.

I've been teaching ""computer shy"" adults how to use computers since 1997.

I've incorporated what I've learned from those experiences into my computer help manuals and instructional videos.

This instructional dvd can be played on computers with DVD drives and on television sets with DVD players.
