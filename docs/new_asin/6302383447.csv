7825560,5,6302383447,"""The Incident"" is a made for TV movie about a fictional POW camp for German soldiers in World War II. They are being held in Camp Bremen, in Bremen, Colorado (the movie was actually filmed in Colorado Springs) as thousands of Axis soldiers were throughout the war.

The local town doctor is also the POW camp doctor. He is murdered at the camp and a German sergeant looks to be guilty. A civilian trial is ordered due to political considerations and the local ne'er-do-well attorney played by Walter Matthau is appointed by the judge (played by Harry Morgan of M*A*S*H and Dragnet fame)to defend the German suspect.

Matthau is strong with a wide variety of emotions displayed - not overdone, not underdone - just right. He has several strong scenes with his character's granddaughter played by Ariana Richards (best known as the blond girl from the Jurassic Park movies).

This movie inspired two sequels starring Matthau, Morgan. Richards was in one of the sequels.

I give this one a grade of A-.",1186531200,3,999,4.790697674418604
7825561,5,6302383447,"First of all I would like to point out that I am a great admirer of Walter Matthau. He never disappoints; and so he sparkles in this role of a small town lawyer who is forced to defend a POW German of WW II. There is much political intrigue, and Matthau peels off layer after layer. Far from boring, this film will hold your attention all the way. Though it is a solemn topic in dire times - set in Lincoln Bluff, Colorado in the summer of 1944 -  it has its funny moments as any good film should have. Overall an excellent cast! By all means, this is worthwhile watching!",1074988800,4,572,4.153153153153153
