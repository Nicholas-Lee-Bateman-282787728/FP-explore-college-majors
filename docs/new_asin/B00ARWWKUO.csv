5495058,4,B00ARWWKUO,"An above average little romp into the sci-fi genre, in which a couple from a galaxy far far away are sent to planet earth to bring back one of their cohorts who was sent there on a mission, but liked all the sexy fun she was having and didn't want to leave. Very funny in parts such as the scene where the space travelers, being unaccustomed to restaurant ettiquite ordered every thing on the menu and then walked out without paying. Amy Lindsey is the overly patient girlfriend of an earthling who expects an invasion from space aliens at any time.",1472342400,2,549,4.445544554455446
