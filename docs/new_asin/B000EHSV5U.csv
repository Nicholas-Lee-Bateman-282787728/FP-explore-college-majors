8109984,2,B000EHSV5U,"This film would have been better if the editing didn't require the viewer to piece the story together after watching it. Scenes happen with no explanation and the characters relationships to each other are too quickly thrown out in brief sentences. The story is about three high school girls that play kokkuri, a Ouija like game to talk to spirits. Mio is the nice girl who works at the radio station with her older sister. Hiroko is the shy girl and Masami is the mean girl. Why are these three even friends? Masami picks on Hiroko and sleeps with the boy Hiroko is interested in just because. Mio has a lesbian crush on Hiroko and Hiroko wants to be more like Masami. Anyway, these three get together and summon a spirit to help them with life and decisions. One time Hiroko walks out upset and the other two close out the game. Too bad it takes all three to close out the spirit. The ghost child that is the spirit has a connection to the girls. It is a childhood friend of Hiroko's who drowned. This spirit also appeared to Mio as a child when she almost drowned. Hiroko ends up being possessed and Mio must try to save the girl she loves from being taken to a watery grave.",1383609600,,1178,4.359090909090909
8109985,1,B000EHSV5U,"the scariest thing is that we actually made it through this whole movie.  granted we fell asleep during various parts, the film should have come with a disclaimer that it is more tolerable when watched on 2x fast forward with subtitles.  the acting is both weak and melodramatic, the story line tries to be way more complicated than necessary, rendering the film a confusing mess. less is more.  this film's story line could have woven in less snipits of random stories.  whether good or bad (and this is up to viewer interpretation), the lack of dialogue might have been the best thing about this film.  if you hated the acting, lack of talk was great!  if you really wanted to figure out what was going on, lack of talk confounded that issue.  altogether a lose-lose situation.  save your money and 1.5 hours of your life.  don't watch this horror of a movie.  do something productive...like clean your house.",1153526400,,911,4.708860759493671
8109986,1,B000EHSV5U,"Kokkuri is about 3 school girls (at least we assume they are school girls. They wear the uniforms and talk about school, but we actually never see them attend)who decide one day to summon a spirit named Kokkuri-san using a handmade ouija board. Everything is fine and dandy until the spirit decides it is done playing nice and refuses to leave. This movie falls in the realm of many asian films where it explains as little as possible. But at the end I cared so little for the girls and the plot I didn't even try decyphering it. It is really bad. I found it in the $5.99 bin in Wal-Mart, and now I realize it was there for a reason. I hope I can return it. Boring, lagging and not the least bit scary. The only good thing about this film is it did not have much of a soundtrack. Sometimes movies are ruined by the overpowering music in critical moments, and this was a relatively quiet film. That's about the only good thing I can say about it.",1148860800,,945,4.2555555555555555
