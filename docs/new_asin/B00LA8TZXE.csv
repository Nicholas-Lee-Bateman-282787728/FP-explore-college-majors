8664796,5,B00LA8TZXE,"For ,those of us who are Peter Robinson fans of his books festuring DCI Alan Banks, we were overjoyed to see him come to life in the ITV series. DCI Banks is the head of detectives in the Yorkshire area, and all if the cases take place in these surroundings. We see the city, the country and everything in between.

Alan Banks look like a morose character with not much personality. Stephen Tompkinsin plays Banks. Ah, no, not true., he gas a rich life sometimes. Once married, he has a grown daughter, and in some episodes she is very much present. He lives in a lovely house, and his lives arecwine and music. You may find him at night in his study with wine listening to his favorite music. His other life is his job, and he is good at it. You may be surprise to hear he with his team solves every case.

Andrea Lowe, the beautiful blonde, impetuous at times, plays DS Annie Cabot. She flits in and out if Banks life as his sometime lover. An excellent detective, but makes hasty decisions. DI Morton, played by Carolyn Catz, a lovely brunette, wears a severe haircut. Does not allow emotion into much of her life. She is often brusque with people, needs to learn social skills, and I wonder if she In on the Autism spectrum. She is brilliant and most often correct. I like her best. The Team investigates their crimes, digs up all of the facts and solves every crime. A lot of murder and mayhem, abound.

The development of the characters is great also, in particular Caroline Catz's character (she was in Doc Martin with Martin Clunes as his wife).
This is a great show and I always enjoy watching each episode more than once!",1421280000,,409,4.466666666666667
