8205489,5,B000SK5Z34,"These are original WWII instructional films.  The B-17 film has deleted a two-minute comedy introduction, which was painful to watch anyway.

The B-26 film almost turns into a movie, with the ""green"" Corporal Flight Engineer inadvertantly dumping most of their fuel while trying to transfer it from one tank to another.  They make it back to base on one engine, all the while using the incident as a learning experience on emergency procedures.  The instructor sagely warns that ""you can't turn a B-26 into a dead engine or it will spin out"".  This is one of the myths about the plane that Jimmy Doolittle went from base to base dispelling later on as the B-26 got a reputation for being a ""Widow Maker"".  One does get a keen sense of the complexity of the plane and the fact that it was a ""hot"" plane to fly.

The Corporal later gets demoted to Private and assigned to extended KP.  Of course, nothing happens to the Officer Pilots who were so pre-occupied with teaching and learning that neither one bothered to look at the fuel gauge winding down!

These films are at times a little corny and perhaps a little boring, but give some great insight into what it took to fly these planes.  The series is much less expensive than these films used to sell for individually on VHS and well worth the money.",1233705600,3,1302,4.549356223175966
