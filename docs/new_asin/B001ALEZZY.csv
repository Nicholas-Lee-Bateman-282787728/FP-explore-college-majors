8365598,5,B001ALEZZY,"I had this great BBG DVD along with Lee RItenour 'Overtime' (I am not even sure I remember well that title). The latter is a clean, shiny beautiful DVD of banal fusion-easy listening jazz, impeccably filmed and performed by wonderful, famed musicians. Made me sleep. Boring. Shiny images and frantic camera movements do not help at all rise any emotions. The very former has been a revelation and is a favourite Jazz DVD ever since. It cannot be more different from the american 'jazz' DVD I mentioned. Black as the night, really well made with images supporting the dynamic, improvvisative music of the trio, this is what the Dutch scene and a deep love for classic jazz may be in Europe, from three wonderful musicians at ease with the Bennink's ever provocative rhythm pulses. This is an hommage to the legacy of Bud Powell and MOnk. Not sperimental nor provocative music as Han can be accustomed to, but a heartfelt personal hommage to the Masters (like Han, Ernst and Michiel are also very deeply used to). The DVD includes a fine cd of the trio.",1261008000,,1051,4.686486486486486
