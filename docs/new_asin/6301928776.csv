I wish he could have made 1 subject,the cross, a lil longer on ad lib. Of his shows in general, i feel if sam got even more topics,which is a chore, then being more silly and oh,ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh'd more, he'd make me laugh at most but that may have been his next plan more n more of course, while still ""here"". Maybe he was just saving the rest of his best for heaven.",1184889600,,575,3.9655172413793105

I have a pretty good memory, but this is so special if you've seen it, you'll know what I mean, if you haven't,  and you don't take yourself or life too seriously you'll love this. Richard Pryor + Robin Williams =Sammy boy. I came here to sell my copy, but seeing people are whining that it hasn't been re-released and are looking, I'll hold on to mine. It's that good. I wanted to change all my stuff to DVD but ain't gonna happen. I've been where those people are. Here's what you do, buy it, and if you don't like it, re-sell it. Just as it were a rental. How do you lose. I'll save you some time. You don't. ........Keep smiling",1092873600,,715,4.070921985815603
