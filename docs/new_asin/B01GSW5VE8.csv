7767587,3,B01GSW5VE8,"This is the first UHD disc I purchased to test out my new UHD player and was somewhat disappointed in the video quality.  Not bad, mind you but not the quality I was hoping for.  I would not purchase if you want to use to showcase your 4K system.  Was more impressed with the Dolby Atmos audio.  It is mostly just dialogue but there are some cool sound effects that really float around you in a way that traditional 5 or 7 channel sound tracks just can't replicate.",1487894400,,465,4.25

Breathtaking underwater photography I prefer to watch in 3-D.Worth the money and had good reply value!",1482019200,5,236,4.925

7767594,5,B01GSW5VE8,"Saw it first in 4K on my 4K tv via my 4K player but the movie was a way different experience via my 3D tv .. excellent in 3D .. made me really fall back in love w my 3D tv ..

On a tangent, I wanted to see the difference between my 4K and 3D tvs and there really just is no comparison the 3D experience is so much more superior .. though 4K tv and player makes every movie DVD, blue ray, streaming far better than my 3D tv .. but 3D movie done right just blow the movie watching experience out of the ball park ..",1476144000,42,513,3.706422018348624
7767595,3,B01GSW5VE8,"Actually I was a little disappointed. The undersea photography was not as stunning as some other 3D documentaries, and the use of 3D wasn't as deep in perspective. I feel bad not being more positive. I'm sure they worked very hard on capturing the undersea imagery, and it's all very well produced, but these days, where there is an abundance of beautiful nature documentaries, I'm afraid this one wasn't my favorite.",1476144000,14,417,4.887323943661972
7767596,5,B01GSW5VE8,"The 4K UHD has mixed quality video, so avoid this title if your going to try to showcase your 4k home theater set up. I found the SDR looked less pixelated than the HDR version especially during the water/manta ray scenes in chapter 5.  The best parts of this movie unfortunately are the above water scenes of the busy human cities which match some of the gorgeous 4k videos available on YouTube. One thing I found interesting is the ability to switch between the SDR and HDR versions on the main starting menu. Cool for comparing picture settings between the 2 formats.

UPDATED REVIEW 3/20/2017
Raised the score from 3 to 5 stars, it seems the XBOX One S is a lacking 4K UHD player compared to the SONY UBP-X800 I received today.  This and all of my other 4K disks look much improved on the Sony UHD player especially clarity and HDR color.",1473897600,17,842,4.454545454545454

7767599,5,B01GSW5VE8,"This is a wonderfully made, and critically important issue.  Already, most of the planet's coral reefs are destroyed or near to destruction due to bleaching caused by anthropogenic ocean acidification and rising temperature.  25% of all life on earth lives in coral reefs. It is estimated that 50% of all species will go extinct in 50 years at the current rate.

7767603,3,B01GSW5VE8,"The actual reef parts were wonderful, vibrant, and colorful.  But it got really annoying as they felt they had to keep cutting to sped-up New York City scenes to pound in the idea that a reef is like a city.  I think most of us got that after one cut to high speed NYC, but they kept doing it over and over again.  I think I made it to about 20 minutes before I turned it off, and will donate it to the local library.",1506038400,4,417,3.8823529411764706

7767617,3,B01GSW5VE8,"Good but could have been much better if they included more underwater scenes from other reefs around the globe, the film has a lot of other terrestrial scenes and a PSA regarding global warming.  I appreciate the PSA but wished they stuck to the subject at hand first which is reefs, after all that is why I bought this film to start with.  Put the PSA message at the end of the film instead of spreading it across the entire film every few mins, made me feel like they were schooling me about global warming so it made be not enjoy this film as much as it could have.",1499040000,7,568,4.201834862385321

7767623,4,B01GSW5VE8,"The content of this video is, in many scenes, both stunning and spectacular.  There is some material which originates at a lower resolution and striping is visible as a result of the enhancement process.
The juxtaposition between human habitation and reef is valid but overplayed.  One sequence of a major city time-lapse photography would have sufficed.
The disc set is advertised and labelled as Region 'A' but the 4K and Blu-ray versions have both played on my multi-region 4K UHD machine whilst set to 'B' without difficulty or switching of region setting.  It may be that they are set, in reality, to 'ABC' in common with most current 4K material.",1496102400,,652,4.909090909090909
