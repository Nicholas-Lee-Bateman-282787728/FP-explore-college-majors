2454283,4,B000C8STW6,"Went to see Venom while on holiday, not really heard much about it, so didn't expect much, was kinda worried as used to buy cheap low budget crap off the internet and girlfriend said she would strangle me if it was bad. Well she really enjoyed it and so did I, had good effects and a good few scares, also saw Cry Wolf while we were there and although good, not a patch on venom, obviously Cry Wolf starring Bon Jovi has had more advertising hence the reason it has taken 5 time more in box office since it opened, if I had to choose I would definately recommend Venom",1127692800,3,568,4.172727272727273
2454284,4,B000C8STW6,"Its kind of a sad state horror films are in right now.  What angers me the most about the PG-13 horror films we've been seeing recently is that they were originally supposed to be R.  For instance, all of the ""unrated"" movies coming to DVD (see Grudge, Ring 2, Dark Water, Darkness...the list can go on and on), they were cut down from an R rating to achieve that PG-13 group.  Whenever I bring this up I get yelled at (mostly by those unable to see R rated movies) because they think PG-13 horror films are the end all of horror.  What they are missing is that in the past most, if not all, horror films were rated R and it just feels like a dumbing down when you can't go anywhere to find an R rated horror film but lo and behold PG-13s abound.

I apologize for the digression but it does serve a purpose for this review.  The reason I give Venom a 4 star rating as opposed to the 3 or 3.5 it probably deserves is based on the timing.  I saw this movie this last weekend because my friend suggested (after a horrific screening of The Exorcism of Emily Rose the weekend prior) we see something R rated.

We saw Venom and we both enjoyed it.  Its a throwback to the movies we watched growing up like Friday the 13th, Nightmare on Elm Street and Halloween.  You know the movie, the unstoppable killing machine that doesn't seem too anxious in killing you and settles for simply trudging slowly toward you.  Slow, but unstoppable, and always seems to show up when the protagonists least expect it.  Bullets don't do anything, fire gets shrugged off and yet the killer comes onward killing everyone around the protagonist until he or she (she in this case) can't take it anymore and fights back.

In this case, the movie bases itself around the idea of this Haitian custom (don't know the veracity of this; hollywood or true?) where people will suck out the evil of murderers etc with snakes so that their soul can go into the afterlife.  In this case, take one ""town freak"" throw in an accident and an encounter with about 6 or so of these snakes that contain these evil souls and you have the makings of the town freak becoming a murderer.  Pretty standard stuff and seems almost laughable.  But it is a horror film and you have to make concessions when you see one.  What follows is plenty of death scenes, people getting offed in some memorable ways and some genuinely startling scenes.

Overall, Venom truly is an average horror flick.  I don't want to give people the wrong impression.  This isn't the best horror film I've ever seen.  It probably doesn't deserve a 4, but if you can dispel your disbelief, it is pretty decent.  But this one is unapologetically R rated and filled with some gore, language and scares.  It comes across as feeling like I Know What You Did Last Summer mixed with stylized voodoo with the villain looking like The Swamp Thing.  It does provide some nice jumps, a few scares and, if you are afraid of snakes, some neat scary snake moments.  I jumped, my friend screamed and best of all?  No loud and noisy pre-teens (no offense to the non-noisy pre-teens, I do make a distinction) ruining the movie.  And that, in and of itself, warrants a 4 star.",1127088000,51,3179,4.436206896551724

The story revolved around a group of bored teenagers, and  older  characters have little screen time. I did like the setting - they are very realistic and not the cheesy swamp scenes that are typical in most movies. The plot was okay, but the movie would've been better if more time had been spent on the voodoo angle and less time on bored teenagers trying to find anything to do in a sleepy southern town. Much of the movie is dark and murky, and I really don't like that, but just trying to set the atmosphere, I suppose.

Take your pick between bad writing, cheap special effects, no character development, and a really stupid ending. I like the whole Louisiana Creole background and the mysterious voodoo religion, that no one believe in anymore, but they just didn't take it anywhere. It's 15 minutes of interesting and an hour and 15 minutes of cheesy slasher bull, with typical lines, no eye candy, no comedy, nothing! It was quite boring and the ending just... wow!

2454495,3,B000C8STW6,"Well, Amazon suckered me in with this one! Based on my purchase/ browsing history, the witchcraft of technology put Venom in front of my face as a recommended purchase. The site told me that the DVD release date was May 2011. A little research shows that this title was actually made back in 2005...

Anyway, I was in for a novel experience with this film since, under the influence of a little alcohol, Mrs Milton agreed to settle down to watch this with me. She NEVER watches horror! So, the DVD sleeve offered the following info about the movie:
""From the creator of Scream and the director of I Know What You Did Last Summer...Venom is a fright-filled voodoo thriller loaded with a cast of the screen's hottest young stars!

Set deep in the eerie swamps of southern Louisiana- Agnes Bruckner (Murder By Numbers), Jonathan Jackson (Tuck Everlasting) and Meagan Good (Roll Bounce) are among a group of teenagers trying to uncover the truth behind a friend's mysterious death. What they find is an evil force more deadly than anyone could have imagined! Now they are the ones running for their lives! Also starring Bijou Phillips (Almost Famous) and Method Man (Garden State), Venom is a chilling horror tale sure to thrill you!""

With the impressive opening sentence, half-decent trailer and the promise of a voodoo-fuelled killing machine, I was let done by what followed: a formulaic horror that lacks any real imagination. It could be argued that no horror tale is entirely new but with Venom we seem to have some cliched horror memes in the possessed killer, creepy house, dumb teenagers/ slasher fodder, etc.

For me, there were some clear highlights to the movie, those being how the killer overcomes the voodoo magic keeping him from his prey and also how he dispatches his victims on the whole; I will reveal neither of these things to you in case you do decide to watch Venom.
The voodoo backstory is a nice touch but ought to have been explored a little further to add some depth and perhaps greater scares since this movie failed to even make Mrs Milton jump.

The young cast are adequate in their roles and bring quite the horror pedigree to Venom with: Agnes Bruckner (The Woods, The Pact, Kill Theory, Vacancy 2), Jonathan Jackson (Insomnia, Riding the Bullet), Laura Ramsey (The Ruins, The Covenant) and Meagan Good (The Unborn, Saw V) but it is Rick Cramer who shines and is suitably menacing and physically imposing enough to pull off the role of the possessed killer; but isn't really given much opportunity to perform.

The practical effects in Venom cannot be faulted but the CGI employed for the snakes and other effects was poor and blatantly computer generated. Additionally, many of the scenes clearly used studio sets rather than somewhere a little more authentic, detracting further from the feel of the film.

Overall, I feel this film ought to have been a decent addition to the stalk `n' slash subgenre but it failed to realise its own potential.
Minus the expletives, Mrs Milton's verdict was that Venom was ""Like Snakes on a Plane... with hardly any snakes... and no plane"".",1355443200,,3107,4.79626168224299
2454496,5,B000C8STW6,"I felt that this film is very underrated. If you haven't seen it, I would recommend on a night with friends or a night when you want to discover a gem.",1352764800,,151,3.903225806451613
2454497,5,B000C8STW6,"I absolutely love this movie.  It's pure horror enjoyment without being over the top. The story is simple but complete. Another movie that would have been funny to watch on the big screen....also, I would watch this with my teenagers. There is no nudity! What a surprise.",1348272000,,271,4.76595744680851
2454498,4,B000C8STW6,"... but the DVD edition has the option for English or Spanish subtitles.

Echo Bridge is so inconsistent from title to title in whether or not their releases are subtitled and as of this writing, probably 99% of Echo Bridge releases (from their cheapie ""20 Horror Films on One Disc!"" to single titles) are not subtitled in any way, shape, or form.

As far as a review for ""Venom"", it was an okay little voodoo-esque thriller with a talented cast of enthusiastic actors who are recognizable to those of us who live for horror flicks:

Agnes Bruckner (as Eden Sinclair, the protagonist)
Jonathan Jackson (as Eric, Eden's on-again, off-again boyfriend)
Meagan Good (as Cece, friend and co-worker of Eden)
The late Deborah Duke (as Miss Emmie, the excavator of ""the box"" and Cece's aunt)
Bijou Phillips (as Tammy, another friend of Eden)
Laura Ramsey (as Rachel, and yet another friend of Eden)

""Venom"" was produced by Kevin Williamson and directed by Jim Gillespie.

I liked ""Venom"" on DVD enough to pick it up on Blu-ray, assuming that if the DVD had English subtitles that the Blu-ray edition would certainly have subtitles?

I was wrong. The Blu-ray edition of ""Venom"" is NOT subtitled either in English or Spanish and Echo Bridge has fooled me once again.

In all fairness though, the BD edition does not state that it is subtitled so I really can't blame Echo Bridge for my not being careful enough and not reading the rear-cover specifications.

I enjoyed the film (with all its atmospheric darkness, wetness, greasiness and accursed voodoo-zombie story) and give this well-done horror outing a solid Four Stars out of Five.

But no subtitles for this Blu-ray version when the DVD had subtitle options? That, I don't understand.",1347667200,7,1885,4.90251572327044
2454499,2,B000C8STW6,"Sometimes a horror movie will be released that you cannot wait to dig into. You count down the days to release, watch the trailer as many times as possible, and plan to be at the movie theater the second they open the doors on opening day. Then something happens..the movie isn't playing near you. Hell, the entire STATE that you live in isn't playing the film. Talk about a let down. Such for me was the case behind the Dimension film ""Venom."" Produced under the working title ""Backwater,"" the film was a little bit of a 90's slasher reunion. The film was to be directed by Jim Gillespie (""I Know What You Did Last Summer"") and written/produced by Kevin Williamson (""I Know What You Did Last Summer"", ""Scream""). After countless rewrites of the script, Williamson took his name off the project as writer but kept his producing title. Going into the summer of 2005, the movie was shaping up to be a big hit for the studio. What went wrong?

""Venom"" opens with a Creole woman digging up a small briefcase from the ground in the pouring rain. Because, as we all know, everyone in Louisiana it is always raining. She then proceeds to get in her car and drive down the Louisiana road. Meanwhile at a local burger joint, high school senior, Eden (Agnes Bruckner), is working with her best friends, Rachel (Laura Ramsey) and CeCe (Meagan Good) while the rest of her friends hang around the place. Ricky (Pawel Szajda) is aimlessly flirting with Patty (Davetta Sherwood) and Tammy (Bijou Phillips) by giving them alcohol. Eric (Jonathan Jackson) and Sean (D.J. Cotrona) talk about important matters until Ray Sawyer (Rick Cramer) pulls up in his tow truck. These names couldn't get more white trash if they tried.

After work, Eden begins to bike home alone, but Eric catches up to her to talk to her about going to college in New York. While they were talking, Ray drives up and asks if Eden's alright. He begins to leave when another car, carrying the Creole woman who turns out to be CeCe's grandmother. Her car falls halfway off the bridge. Ray gets out of the truck and helps Eric to save the woman. Ray saves her, but the woman begs Ray to get the suitcase. As Ray reaches in the car to get it, the car capsized into the water. The briefcase begins to move and finally opens releasing several awful CGI snakes. As the car sinks into the bayou the CGI snakes attack Ray, leaving him possessed as he goes after the clueless teens.

Those damn CGI snakes I tell you, they are the cause of half the horror on Syfy! What the movie turns into is a routine slasher movie in which Ray must kill the teens in order to unleash an ancient evil unto the world. The death seems are pretty ho hum as most of the gore is kept offscreen and the characters are about as annoying as you would expect. The one exception being the sweet and surprisingly likable Megan Good as the granddaughter. She delivers her overwritten lines with gusto and she is the right combination of genuine and intelligent. Too bad about those other characters as Good is one of the first of the crew to die. We are left with the bitchy and grossly unlikable Bruckner to carry the day. Why do filmmakers do this? Didn't anyone learn anything from the death of Rachel in the horribly conceived ""Halloween 5'?

It took me seven years for me to watch this as Dimension dumped this into only a few hundred theaters thanks to the tragedy that was Hurricane Katrina. As if the victims involved would have carried about a dumb voodoo movie. Who cares? By the time it was released on DVD, I sure didn't. I definitely didn't after watching this 90 minute mess of a movie. Williamson should have taken his name off this disaster all together. As for Dimension, I'm guessing this was a case of too many cooks in the kitchen. An idea that started out strong but everyone had to get their little grimy claws on the script. Note to Dimension, stick with releasing your horror movies and let the horror filmmakers create their own movie. Also...another note...I wanna see the original cut of Cursed. Thank you.",1341619200,,4051,4.55281207133059
2454500,3,B000C8STW6,"Set in the swamps of Louisiana, the teen slasher Venom (2005) had the bad timing to be released shortly after Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf Coast, which contributed to it tanking during its theatrical release.  Directed by Jim Gillespie, and based on a video game, while far from a classic in the genre, the film is quite well shot, serves up some nasty and creative kills, and moves along at a pretty brisk tempo.

An old woman who is a practitioner in voodoo, is carrying a suitcase containing evil spirits in the back seat of her car, when she gets into an accident at a bridge.  High school student Eden Sinclair (Agnes Bruckner), her boyfriend Eric (Jonathan Jackson), and mechanic Ray Sawyer (Rick Cramer) are on the scene.  Sawyer pulls the woman from the car, but while attempting to retrieve the suitcase, the car falls into the river.  While submerged in the car, demons in the form of snakes attack Sawyer, and kill him.

The old woman also dies, and her granddaughter CeCe (Meagan Good), who is Eden's coworker, becomes extremely agitated upon learning that the suitcase is now empty.  Sawyer's body is taken to the morgue, where possessed by demons, it later comes to life and kills an orderly, before returning to the service station he owned.  When two teenage girls drop by for gas, they quickly become victims of the demon Sawyer.

Concerned about how CeCe is doing, Eden and her friends Ricky (Pawel Szajda) and Rachel (Laura Ramsey) go to visit her at her grandmother's cabin deep in the bayou country, where CeCe, a very junior voodoo practioner, is concerned that Sawyer's body has apparently disappeared.  Before long, the demon arrives and strikes with his favorite weapon, a tire iron.  The survivors are soon joined by Eric, and Sawyer's estranged son Sean (D.J. Cotona), but only find momentarily safety in the house.  They come up with a plan based on voodoo, but the demon is smart, too strong, and won't be denied.

After she helps guide a friend to her death, Eden becomes the ""last girl"".  At times she seems to escape almost in spite of herself, but she does manage to pull it together and crush the demon.  It might be nice though, if Agnes Bruckner's wardrobe included more variety than her work uniform, and a green top.

Venom is a slasher that isn't heavy on character development, but it moves along nicely, and there are enough kills to keep things interesting, if the voodoo theme hasn't become too boring.",1338163200,,2447,4.735849056603773

2454504,1,B000C8STW6,"***SPOILER ALERT***

First of all, let me say that although everyone is entitled to their own opinions, I don't understand how some people could give this crappy movie even 3 stars, much less 5.  On a positive note the acting is fairly decent, there was a lot of blood, so it might be good for some gore hounds, and for all intents and purposes, it was a good attempt at doing something different in a ""horror"" movie.

But as a horror fan myself (and someone with some common sense), the plot made absolutely no sense and the voodoo angle was completely inaccurate.  Hollywood doesn't really know how to do a successful voodoo movie, because they never do the research.  The filmmakers should stick to what they know.  I also found it distasteful for the first 4 kills in the movie to all be of black characters, with the only exception being the one white guy who came back to life to be the killer.  They then go on to kill the only other black character in the movie (C.C. played by Meagan Good) who is also the only one who know about the voodoo and how to stop the killer.  Now all of a sudden Bruckner's character knows all about the voodoo enough to go and stop the undead killer.  Laughable.  Also, the kills are truly lame.  He kills most people with a crowbar, and a couple others with a slash to the throat or a spray-paint gun.  A few of the kills are even done off camera.  Seriously??

I was hoping for some deleted scenes or an alternate ending in the ""Special Features"" section, but in truth what I needed was an alternate movie.

2454508,5,B000C8STW6,"Venom is a classic-style horror movie with elements of mystery, adventure and minimal gore. It is also an ""Indie"" type of movie, in that it stars a group of young actors with lots of energy, who are having fun, planning their lives (and getting killed-off:) I rated it a Nine within this context.

The mystery theme, involving a group of young friends, reminds me of a Nancy Drew type story line. These young friends, with their whole lives ahead of them, are forced to learn about Voodoo quickly (to avoid getting killed-off:)

The horror/Voodoo theme is well-known: A Voodoo Zombie is created when a dead body becomes ""possessed"" by a legion of escaped bad souls. These souls had previously been extracted from unfortunate victims and ""confined"" by a good Voodoo priestess during intervention/cleansing rituals. Unfortunately the bad souls escaped their confinement during an accident).

The adventure theme is classic chase-and-kill: Obviously the Zombie is out for a hellish romp, and killing people left-and-right to strengthen it's evil occupants. Who is going to step-up and kick it's butt?

This movie was deliberately made to be fun and entertaining, as well as provide some Voodoo folklore. A great Friday night romp in the swamp with an evil Zombie! Where Friends get to gather at Voodoo temples, get chased thru a bona-fide Louisiana Swamp, and often get to die!! There's even a hero at the end:)",1234656000,2,1408,5.030042918454936

2454510,3,B000C8STW6,"With the Louisiana swamps as backdrop, voodoo as a catalyst, and young starlets heading up the cast, you'd think that ""Venom"" might just be able to be a decent R-rated slasher/hacker flick.  Instead of that, we get another formulaic PG-13 teen slasher flick with a little more gore and a lot more rough language (hence the ""R"" rating).  Poor Ray Sawyer was just trying to save an old lady's life when he got snakebit.  Unfortunately for him, though, the venom in the snake's bite was a little bit more than poisonous.  It contained the souls of some of the wickedest murderers and rapists you could muster in southern Louisiana.  Now undead and armed with a crowbar, Ray is after any and everybody who stands in his way.  A gaggle of local teens try to stop him by using voodoo, but will that work?  If you can sit through this textbook horror flick you just might find out.

The cast is made up of relative unknowns (at least to me).  The biggest stars (if you can call them that) are Method Man as a cop and Bijou Phillips as the only thing Bijou Phillips seems to get cast as:  the local tramp.  She does get to keep her clothes on in this flick, though.  Everybody in the film does very well with what they're given, but I really never cared if any of them lived or died.

The creature doing all of the wicked business looked decent enough, but didn't have the screen presence of ""Jason"" or even ""Michael Myers.""  He grunted a lot, growled a bit, and freed up a few limbs.  Overall, however, he just wasn't that menacing to watch.

I felt that more could have been done with the voodoo aspect of the film, but I'm just a reviewer.  Why the voodoo wasn't explored deeper is unknown to me.

In conclusion I must say that ""Venom"" is decent enough for one viewing, but there is a lot better horror out there.  I mildly recommend this flick to horror fans.  If you enjoy flicks like the ""Friday The 13th"" series or mediocre horror like ""Dreamcatcher,"" ""Venom"" will suit you just fine.",1186617600,3,1983,4.425414364640884
2454511,2,B000C8STW6,"For making of Dimension Film's ""Venom,"" Kevin Williamson (as producer) joins forces again with director Jim Gillespie who had once helmed ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" based on Williamson's script. As you know, in this 1997 hit horror film, a group of teenagers are stalked and killed by a mysterious guy with a hook, who is supposed to be dead.

In ""Venom,"" a pack of teenagers including Eden (Agnes Bruckner) and her ex-boyfriend Eric (Jonathan Jackson) must run away from the zombie-like murderer with jingling keys, who is also supposed to be killed in a strange car accident. With a different setting (this time, in the swamps of Louisiana) and a spooky photography, the film tries to tell a new story, which is in fact nothing new.

But as you know, slasher films tend to be formulaic from the beginning - flat characters, obligatory love interest, etc. - so story is not everything. I know what really matters is suspense and killings in the end, so I waited for the film to show what it really can do.

What really disappointed me is this - the film is not scary or gory enough. Maybe that's because I have seen so many horror films since the 1980s. Even so, most tricks used here are not particularly original, used by some more famous killers like Jason who did it better.

Only Bijou Phillips and her character as shoplifting girl interested me during the film's 90 minute running time. But the time allotted to her is not very long.",1186531200,,1448,4.60077519379845

Eric and Eden are going through any typical teen romance; going steady one minute, broken up the next.  Eden works at a local truck stop as a waitress. One evening, Ray pulls into the truck stop to get some food.  Known as the local nut case, Ray has few friends and owns a filling station on the edge of town.  Later that same evening, Ray comes upon Eric and Eden on a lonely bridge.  Swerving to miss Eric's jeep, Ray instead crashes into an on-coming car.  The impact of the crash sends the car slamming through the guardrail of the bridge.  The car is now teetering precariously on the side of the bridge. Ray jumps from his truck and goes to the aid of the woman inside the car.  After pulling her to safety, Ray goes back inside to retrieve a suitcase that the woman told him about.  However, both Ray and the car tumble over the side of the bridge and into the water below.  To make matters worse, the suitcase is full of poisonous snakes, who immediately begin striking at Ray.  All that can be heard are Ray's screams as the car sinks.

Ray's body is pulled from the water and taken to the local morgue.  But it doesn't remain there for long.  It seems that the woman in the car was a Voodoo priestess, and the snakes were used to ""cleanse"" people by drawing the evil out of them.  Now, the evil venom is flowing through Ray.  Now begins a bloodbath of carnage as Ray, possessed by the power of the evil venom flowing through him, begins to stalk unsuspecting victims.  One by one, he exacts his revenge on Eden's friends until only Eden remains.  Who will win this final showdown; Ray or Eden?

I've always been a big fan of slasher-type films, and characters like Freddy from the ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" series, as well as Jason from ""Friday the 13th"".  Ray Sawyer fits the mold of the typical slasher perfectly. The motives are the same; kill as many teenagers as possible, and Ray succeeds in this very well.  I thought the story involving voodoo was well-conceived.  The special effects were good, too.

I recommend this movie to horror and slasher fans.  Although the movie is short (only about 80 minutes), there's lots of slashing in a short amount of time.  If you enjoy a good slasher flick, then don't miss ""Venom"".",1174867200,2,2405,4.524361948955916

I wanted this movie to be more like Candyman, and a little less riddled with bubble-gum teen angst.  The cast would probably be better utilized in another film altogether.  I actually wanted to check this flick out as I am a fan of Bijou Phillips, but even her role was wasted and unnecessary.  The one-dimensional character who becomes the super-strong villain Mr. Jangles--there was nothing terrifying about him.

Thus is the storyline of Venom, a half-hearted attempt toward reviving the slasher genre and to create a new Freddy, Jason, Michael baddie.  The movie is produced by Kevin Williamson and directed by Jim Gillespie.  The last time they collaborated was on I Know What You Did Last Summer.  Since then, it's been mostly downhill for both.  What we have with Venom is a pleasing-enough slasher affair, with plenty of blood, just the right atmosphere and a good first hour to sustain its viewers attention.  Beyond that first hour the movie runs out of steam and stumbles on for another twenty minutes until the requisite setup for a sequel.  Don't hold your breath for that one.  The movie is nicely photographed and Gillespie has an eye for style.  You can almost smell the buyou's stagnant water.  It's a desent slasher, and since slashers of any kind are in short supply now-a-days, it's worth a look.

2454515,2,B000C8STW6,"So what kind of movie is this from the director of ""I know what you did last summer?"" It's basically another installment of the same genre with a similar set-up and similar function. Deep down, Venom is just another teen slasher movie. They rode into this film with the same clichd scares, a young group of teens, a psycho killer, and a traditional ending.

So is it worth seeing?

That I can't completely answer for you. If you like more of the same old, then it's probably going to be a blast. The filmmakers were smart enough to throw in a few thrilling moments among the mundane, overused plot. I found some parts to be slightly unpredictable, and they did a good job detailing some suspenseful moments near the third act of the film. The voodoo element allowed for some additional surprises and kept the killer from being simply ""an unstoppable evil force.""

But individually, do the separate factors of this film combine to make a masterpiece? Quite frankly, in my opinion at least....no.  Let's take a look at some of them;

Acting- Well done, well directed too I might add. The acting is realistic to a degree, and brings us into the film. The actors responded (for the most part) realistically to the story line and I think that this was set-up nicely. The major issue here was the persistence in finding a gun when the killer is already dead, not to mention a demon child of voodoo hoodoo.

Lighting- Dim, dark and mysterious; the lighting definitely amplified the mood of this film. Combined with the swamp-like location, I think that it sets a perfect example of what a good location combined with good lighting can do- make a relatively unattractive plot look beautiful.

Special Effects- They set this up pretty well. A few scenes made me cringe and I felt that the artists working on the film definitely put their hearts into it...or bled them out for it. The gore wasn't excessive, but just right for a slasher film, and props to the director for making that call. My only qualm with this is that they used the standard Halloween ""stage blood"" which is just basically a thick bright red liquid that looks nothing like blood despite its color. A few of the actors squirm around in it, only to look like they're rolling around in pizza sauce. There are a few other tacky special effects, including the last major one in the film.

The Killer- Mr. Jangles....? Enough said...sounds like a dog. I'll give the killer credit for being a good actor, but the portrayal needed a lot of work. The make-up kicked it up a notch, but the slow-motion style jumps and action-movie style stunts didn't do it justice. The man looked like an athlete and moved like one...not like a reincarnated being housing the souls of 13 evil spirits. Although I don't specifically know what that looks like....I'm sure they don't run like football players.

So what overall? It's ok. Not something I'd be dying to see, and I'm glad that I didn't run to the theatre to catch the first showing. It has some good moments and some bad, but doesn't really stand out from any normal Hollywood production.

My recommendation?

It's ok. I'd rather go rent Containment instead; the first movie in a long time to completely blow my mind. It's good to know that there is still some talent out there somewhere and that it still filters into the film world now and again...",1161561600,,3346,4.635135135135135

2454518,3,B000C8STW6,"When I was in high school, a depressingly long and ever-increasing time ago, Kevin Williamson was a minor phenomenon, behind teen super soap Dawson's Creek and several slashers (I Know What You Did Last Summer, Scream) which sliced, diced and pop-culture referenced their way into the mainstream.

Times change, however, and Williamson is as far from his Hollywood salad days as I am from my high-school ones. And, howsoever he was actually involved in Venom - he is listed simply as producer, but dominates the making-of featurette - this is not the film to see him return to mainstream crispiness. Not that Venom is not a solid slasher offering - but that is all it is.

In the film we see a group of bayou college kids being pursued and, ultimately, massacred by, a voodoo super-zombie. The set-up is so cheesy that the plot holes make perverse sense (why didn't the boys call the police?) and the whole affair is carried off with an appropriate appetite for gore.

Yes, as a gay viewer, I would have liked to see more of the lead boys. And, yes, the dialogue was disappointing: Williamson has no doubt lost his Dawson's and Scream talent for irony. And, given the absurdity of the situation in which our leads find themselves, the lack of any humour is criminal.

The film was full of CGI-rendered effects, which I find alienating in a horror picture: despite its popularity, anyone can pick CGI a mile off. The zombie villain itself was also problematic, becoming more excessive in its rotting decayedness as the film progressed. This did not so much scare as amuse.

Despite this, I did not mind the film. It did have an air of quality about it, the lead actors were endearingly enthusiastic, and the swampy locales added some extra creepiness.

All-in-all, Venom fails as a mainstream film, but for fans of the slasher form, it is quite passable fare.",1151020800,3,1858,4.7368421052631575
2454519,3,B000C8STW6,"Venom is a little horror film that came and went in the theaters and barely registered on the radar. It's too bad it didn't have more of a life because it's not half bad. I enjoyed the film quite a lot, but It is not going to shake the world of horror of it's hinges or anything. Produced by ""Scream"" creator Kevin Williamson, and directed by Jim Gillespie who did Williamson's own ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"", this new endeavor from the two is far removed those ones. Get to that here in a minute. The movie itself first. The movie takes place down in Louisianna, Bayou country. A voodoo priestess digs up a suitcase from the earth. She gets into a freak accident on a remote bridge, and the contents of that suitcase transform a man into something purely evil. Ray Sawyer(Ric Cramer), is the local grease monkey from the garage who is the unlucky victim. The snake bits transform this man into an unstoppable killing machine, who is transforming into a snake-like zombie himself. The new screen stalker sets his sights on a group of kids we meet early on. The heroine of the film is Agnes Brucknes(who plays Eden), and she is beautiful and a nice find. The other familiar faces here are Jonathan Jackson(General Hospital), Bijou Phillips(Bully), and Method Man(I don't know why but he seems to be making a second career out of popping into horror films. Remember Seed Of Chucky?). The movie surprised me with how decent it actually was. Nothing special, but it was darn entertaining. The movie was shot well, photogrpahed very well, and just looks good. The area they shot in really worked for the film, and there are some really nice set pieces and scenery. Director Gillespie may not always have the greatest of films, but he knows how to set the tone and the look of the surroundings. I found myself kinda smiling at a few things here and there. The cast of victims are adequate for the material, but there are no Oscar winners here. Most of them are pretty much set up to be teen fodder, but the lead heroine Eden got to me. The bad guy himself is quite creepy and makes his presence felt. The movie is not as neat or clean as the producer and director's others films. This is an R rated film, and those R rated horror films seem to be making way for PG-13 rated ones. If nothing else, horror fans should be pleased to know that the gore is here, the body count is here, the jokes are non-existent, and there are a number of hot girls. Why didn't the film find an audience?. I barely noticed any kind of promotion for this movie at all. It was just in the theaters all of a sudden and then gone. Were they even trying?. In the end, I have seen a lot better than ""Venom"", but I have also seen a lot worse. It's a gory, well shot, box of popcorn horrorfest that I found myself enjoying more than I ever expected to.",1150761600,,2825,4.393129770992366
2454520,3,B000C8STW6,"Venom (Jim Gillespie, 2005)

Venom is a trite, but cute, serial-killer-stalks-young-and-beautifuls-and-eliminates-them-one-by-one flick. You've seen it all a million times. All screenwriters Dille and Platten, collaborators on a number of videogame scripts, did with the basic premise was slap some voodoo trappings on it. And yet, it's not a complete waste of celluloid, despite having what may be the single lowest weekend gross of any film in history on its last weekend on the big screen (on five screens, it grossed [...]. I kid you not).

The movie centers on Eden (The Woods' Agnes Bruckner), though I can never figure out why other than ""this movie needs a young-and-beautiful we can show a lot."" It opens with an interestingly shot, but generally useless, cemetery scene that kind of introduces us to the woman we will eventually come to know as Cece's Grandmother, for that's the only way you'll ever hear her referred to. Cece's grandmother digs something up, but on her way home with it, she gets involved in an accident that takes her life, along with that of the local harmless outcast, Ray Walsh (Rick Cramer, recently in The Battle of Shaker Heights). Ray gets himself mixed up with what it is Cece's Grandmother dug up, through no fault of his own, and things get nasty after that. From there, it's another of those ""the suspense comes from trying to figure out who's going to survive, but we already know"" kinds of things.

It's painfully predictable, with the kind of teen-hip dialogue that sounds as if a couple of old guys were trying to sound like teenagers. (Well, guess what?) Still, if you have to watch these kinds of films-- or, if for some reason, you prefer them to more solid fare-- Venom is not a terrible addition to the canon. It's at least halfway intelligent and does contain a few uncomfortable chuckles here and there, usually at the expense of the bad guy. It also runs a scant 85 minutes, which makes it mercifully shorter than most entires in the teen-serial-killer genre. That alone makes it a bit more worthwhile than most. Don't get your hopes up, though. ** ",1149638400,,2102,4.830555555555556

When I saw the previews, it appeared that this was a truly disturbing film that was sure to creep you out and leave you unsettled.  When I saw the film, however, it turned out to be another teen horror flick.

Granted, this movie was quite a bit more entertaining and frightening than some others I'd seen recently (Cry Wolf, Dark Water, etc.).  The swamp setting did lend the movie an added sense of darkness and dread, further darkening the aura of a backwoods town in the middle of nowhere.  Ray, as ""Mr. Jangles"", was a pretty menacing figure and the incorporation of voodoo into the story also helped to make it a bit more interesting and mysterious.  So, the movie had a good setting, tone and villian - ultimately, not too bad.

2454527,1,B000C8STW6,"Before I bash this movie, let's start with a positive. Hollywood had it right when they previewed this trailer during the Exorcism of Emily Rose. They showed about 90 seconds of no named actors screaming for their life in the swamp lands of Louisiana. Finally, a horror movie where we really don't know the actors and don't care how they die as long as they...well, die. So bring in Venom. Venom did have a lot of promise in the beginning. Boy and girl meet on bridge, she wants to leave her homeland and he wants to stay. Bring in guy with big truck who owns gas station down the road. Tells them the bridge is not a safe place to be (tragic foreshadowing maybe?) While we are making a schmorgazborg here, let's bring in a woman driving psychotically with a suitcase in the back of her car. As fate would have it, she hits the side of the bridge and we are left with our first situation: how do we get her out of the car without it tipping over?

So the brave trucker guy decides to be the brave one and help her out (We can't have Jonathan Jackson dying in the first 2 minutes now can we?) and she wants him to take out the suitcase. **SPOILER** Okay if there were snakes in the suitcase that are supposed to ""suck the evil out of you"" maybe they should have done two things: 1) Substitute leeches, they can't attack anything in a one foot radius since they are slower than turtles or 2) LET THE DAMN THING DROWN! If they are stuck in a suitcase inside of a car in the river, do you think they can do any damage? But no, we have to have a reason to go on, and our trucker friend falls victim to drowning and the snakes and goes overboard...How Titanic. What happened, Celine Dion was too busy in Vegas to sing ""My Heart Will Go On"" as he plummeted?

Carrying on, the body is retrieved from the river and who is once believed to be dead is now brought back from the dead, rotting decay and all. One by one he starts taking out no name victims that we really don't care about. Honestly, I was thrilled to pieces (heh, no pun intended) when he wiped those two so called popular girls out. But during all of this, one friend (Meagan Good - the only other actress people will recognize) is hiding a secret from everyone. She knows that this monster (I can't say Shape because that's Halloween) is going around killing and she knows some kind of voodoo or creole magic that might be able to stop it. Great, call the Charmed Ones and have them fly from San Francisco and you are all set! If only things were that easy for her. Using the trucker's son as a voodoo doll, they try to stop the beast but soon begin to run out of ideas. Now here's dilemma number 2: How do you kill something all ready dead?

Unfortunately, this leads to more deaths from actors and actresses that we could care less if they fell in a well or had their limbs removed. Eventually we are lead to a cemetary where trucker dude is doing some rituals inside of a tomb area or what not. Our heroine lies with all her dead friends as she watches loverboy get tossed in there with her. What's this? He's awake?! Will there be two survivors? No. Heroine doesn't know how to shut her mouth when she gasps, causing possessed Linda Blair in trucking attire to go after her. But love is a funny thing and Jonathan Jackson takes one for the team.

Somehow after his death, our heroine is now bad ass and all empowered. Apparently it takes the death of a true loved one to really pump you up. So now she decides to play the Jessica Biel Texas Chainsaw Massacre roll and tries to wail on our villan. Heh, once again he's dead. It finally takes her decapitating him with his own truck to finally get this jerk to die. So what have we learned kiddies?

1) Never get upset if you are not popular in school. Some psycho re-emerged from the swamps will take them out for you. Use your energy for protecting yourself from his wrath next.

2) If you know someone who is into voodoo, do not hang out with them. A sure indication of this would be weird looking necklaces with the skulls of animals on it followed by a horrible braiding job. Stay out of at least a five mile radius from their house. If you hear a scream, just assume the Jamabalaya is too hot.

3) Never wait until your loved one dies to finally take action. I am sure if Jonathan Jackson could have been resurrected too he would have went Charles Manson on his little sweetheart. Two people fighting one villan is easier than one scared wimp.

4) If you are in Blockbuster and wanting to find a good horror movie, skip over both Venom and Dark Water. You could probably find more chills from Scream or Scary Movie for that matter.",1140739200,6,4645,4.28246013667426

I would recommend it for a rental, but as it gets closer to the end, it will start to lose your interest. I got bored with it. It had a ""been here, done that"" feeling to it.

VENOM is a voodoo tale set in Louisiana's bayous, which does provide an eerie backdrop for some of the scenes.  The voodoo element does offer some potential, but the movie becomes a HALLOWEEN and FRIDAY THE 13TH clone complete with a silent stalking villain who just won't die.  The deaths are cleverly staged with appropriate amounts of gore but don't have a lot of impact since we don't establish much of a connection to the cliched characters.
The cast makes valiant efforts, especially Agnes Bruckner and Jonathan Jackson.  The others--Rick Cramer, Laura Ramsey, Bijou Phillips and Meagan Good--are passable.  No comment on Method Man as the doomed deputy.

2454532,2,B000C8STW6,"Pretty much everything that you can say about Venom is that it is pretty much normal or average in every way.  There are a couple good scares, a couple good gore moments, and the plot is very, very average.

The movie doesn't take much time to develop, as we are introduced to the town freak, Ray, who is quickly killed in a car accident on a bridge.  Unfortunately for Ray, the car he is in when it goes underwater is filled with ""voodoo snakes.""  These aren't just any snake.  These snakes are filled with the evil souls of men who were put away by a ""mumbo"" of the voodoo faith.  So, the next logical step would be to have Ray come back to life, to terrorize the group of ""teenage"" friends that compromise the main cast; and that he does.  The movie doesn't even really try to make us care that much about the main characters.  Sure we get a scene of affection between Eric and Eden, and Ray's illegitimate son gets the big oscar-friendly scene of the movie, where he breaks down and starts to destroy his dead old dad's gas pumping station.

The chaos that ensues from this point is your usual slasher fare.  Some edge of your seat moments, but also some laugh out loud moments.  I think Venom could have actually been a mild success in theaters, had it not been released immediately after Hurricane Katrina hit.  I guess Dimension Pictures just didn't really have faith in a horror movie about the Bayou right after it had been subjected to such devastation in the real world.  Oh well, Venom is condemned to its only real chance of public viewing on video.  And, in the end, I guess that's where it should be.",1138752000,,1615,4.412162162162162

Probably not, this movie bombed in the theatres and that's too bad. You see, this movie takes place in the swamps of Louisana, and I guess alot of people were turned off because this came out the same time as Hurricane Katrina was rampaging through the same state. But to damn a movie because of Mother Nature doesn't seem fair, comsidering how hard it is these days to find good horror movies.

It seems Ray Jangles (Rick Cramer) helped the wrong person. He saves this old lady from falling over a bridge in her car, and when he goes back to grab her suitcase from the backseat, he and the suitcase both tumble over and drown in the river. It seems that suitcase had the souls from several bad men and they are now in Ray, who was already known as the town crazy. Some teens (who else?) try to figure out whats going on so they go visit the house of the dead old lady to talk to her grand-daughter. Voodoo plays a big part, and I liked this, it gave the movie a much darker feel.

Our teen cast is good, we have Agnes Bruckner playing Eden, the film's main character, she's not a bad little actress and might I say very, very fine. Laura Ramsey plays Rachel, her best friend, and our usual scared stiff girl, and please be sure and check out the way she dies, really, really cool!! Our male heroes consist of Jonathan Jackson as Eric and DJ Cotrana as Sean, and while I'm  not familiar with either (I'm sure there on some soap opera, or maybe The OC) they do an OK job. I'm sure Mr. Jangles is not going to go down in history with the likes of Jason, Freddy, Chucky or Michael, but he sure could give them a run for there money, he is pure evil and likes his killings to be gruesome.

The death scenes are really the best part of the movie, they are all original, bloody, and quite creepy. Here is another reason I totally dug this, Method Man is in it, and he dies way early and thank god for that, he is so terrible!!! Who told this man he could act? Maybe he should quit blowing all his hard-earned (ya right) money on weed and get some acting lessons!!

So, you must be saying, geez, nothing but praise so far, why only 3 stars? Friggin' CG!!!!!! You see, Mr. Jangles has some help, and it's in the form of snakes, and oh my god is the CG on these serpents pathetic. Like when they come shooting out of his body, I swear to God I busted out laughing, my wife and I just looked at each other in complete shock. How could they sit through this after they made it and leave that in the movie, You think one of the cast or crew had to have said, ""Um, Mr. Director Sir, the CG for the snakes, is just, um, REPULSIVE!!!"" Take that out, and you easily have a 4 star horror movie here.

So, in all an above-average slasher film, the Voodoo and the young, strong cast give this one an edge over most. The villian is very well done and I hope maybe a sequel will come from this, if the crew can maybe realize the reason it bombed was Katrina and not the film itself. I think the scenes in the Louisana swamp only added to the creepy and dark feel of the movie, and that should be a complement, not a slap in the face.

Nothing really happens in Rays life, nothing really happens in this small Louisiana town until one night while driving home Ray rescues a Creole Voodoo Priestess from a car dangling precariously from a bridge only to be attacked by a suitcase full of venomous snakes which are rumoured to contain the souls of the criminally insane. As the car crashes into the river below so does Ray and his kind act is rewarded with a car full of snakes striking him with deadly painful bites in his last few moments of life.

2454540,3,B000C8STW6,"Some films benefit from the fact that there are times when life imitates art (and visa versa).  ""Marooned"" and ""The China Syndrome"" both benefited from what happened with Apollo 13 and Three-Mile Island, respectively (and we will not begin to discuss what happens when a movie is made of a real event that reminded everybody of a movie in the first place).  But sometimes real events can hurt a movie, as when the assassination of President Kennedy became part of the reason the original version of ""The Manchurian Candidate"" was shelved for a couple of decades.  I bring all of this up because in the wake of Hurricane Katrina a splatter flick set in the bayous of Louisiana may well be a case of bad timing.  At least the television series ""Invasion"" got to acknowledge that it might be stepping on some toes with its hurricane references, but ""Venom"" just runs screaming into the face of reality.

Director Jim Gillespie (""I Know What You Did Last Summer"") and producer Kevin Williamson fully intended to create a new movie serial killer in the mold of Michael, Jason and Freddie.  The idea for ""Mr. Jangles"" came from a videogame named ""Backwater"" that was in development (the name has to do with collecting keys on a ring so that they, altogether now, jangle).  Basically he is a tow-truck driver who is possessed by the spirits of a bunch of murderers, which explains both his reliance on a tire jack and his impulse to kill, kill, kill.  Ray Sawyer (Rick Cramer), was just your average deadbeat-dad tow-truck operator, but then he ended up at the wrong place at the wrong time.  Now, this gets a bit complicated because Ray gets bit by a snake, but not just any snake.  This is a snake that carries the souls of 13 murderers, which happened to be in a box that happened to be in the back of car that happened to be driven by a voodoo priestess that happened to go off a bridge because Ray's tow truck was on the wrong side because the two main teenagers in the film, Eden (Agnes Bruckner) and Eric (Jonathan Jackson) were discussing their futures on the bridge.

Once voodoo enters the picture you can understand the Louisiana connection to the film.  I guess we can assume, for the sake of argument or just watching the film, that ""Venom"" takes place before Katrina, but it is hard to ignore the irony that what the dead teenagers in this film go through is not as bad as what happened in New Orleans at the Superdome.  The problem is that paying attention to the rules of voodoo that are explained in the film are not that helpful because the story abandons them to engage in standard slasher action.  Being related to voodoo priestess is not as good as actually being one, but even the obvious but somewhat promising idea of a voodoo doll could be helpful under the circumstances.  But the screenplay fails to take advantage of even that so that ultimate ""Venom"" does not have much going for it once you get past the location.  A lot of contemporary horror films are flawed because the basic story elements are stupid in some significant one, but here my complaint is that this film is not as smart as it could be given the set up.

Flint Dille & John Zuur Platten (the ""Constantine"" video game) wrote the story and were helped on the screenplay by Brandon Boyce (""Apt Pupil,"" ""Wicker Park""), and I have to say that one of them did come up with a scene I liked.  Zombies are apparently like vampires in that there are certain things you can do to stop them from crossing your threshold.  Well, Ray might be possessed, but Mr. Jangles must have picked up some of his basic tow truck driver knowledge because I like the way the killer makes the mountain come to him even if it was not enough to justify rounding up on this one.  However, the only thing that separates the dead teenagers who do not get killed from the ones that do is that their names appear at the top of the credits, so there is nothing special happening on that end.  When the one person who has been raised believing in voodoo is more freaked out than the ones who do not believe, that is not a good sign.  Gillespie does a better job of taking advantage of the Louisiana swamp setting than the voodoo back story, but then the whole excuse for making this 2005 splatter flick is to kill people and Mr. Jangles does that even if he does not have the decided flair of his competition.",1137542400,2,4360,4.485461441213654

2454542,4,B000C8STW6,"Its kind of a sad state horror films are in right now. What angers me the most about the PG-13 horror films we've been seeing recently is that they were originally supposed to be R. For instance, all of the ""unrated"" movies coming to DVD (see Grudge, Ring 2, Dark Water, Darkness...the list can go on and on), they were cut down from an R rating to achieve that PG-13 group. Whenever I bring this up I get yelled at (mostly by those unable to see R rated movies) because they think PG-13 horror films are the end all of horror. What they are missing is that in the past most, if not all, horror films were rated R and it just feels like a dumbing down when you can't go anywhere to find an R rated horror film but lo and behold PG-13s abound.

I apologize for the digression but it does serve a purpose for this review. The reason I give Venom a 4 star rating as opposed to the 3 or 3.5 it probably deserves is based on the timing. I saw this movie this last weekend because my friend suggested (after a horrific screening of The Exorcism of Emily Rose the weekend prior) we see something R rated.

We saw Venom and we both enjoyed it. Its a throwback to the movies we watched growing up like Friday the 13th, Nightmare on Elm Street and Halloween. You know the movie, the unstoppable killing machine that doesn't seem too anxious in killing you and settles for simply trudging slowly toward you. Slow, but unstoppable, and always seems to show up when the protagonists least expect it. Bullets don't do anything, fire gets shrugged off and yet the killer comes onward killing everyone around the protagonist until he or she (she in this case) can't take it anymore and fights back.

In this case, the movie bases itself around the idea of this Haitian custom (don't know the veracity of this; hollywood or true?) where people will suck out the evil of murderers etc with snakes so that their soul can go into the afterlife. In this case, take one ""town freak"" throw in an accident and an encounter with about 6 or so of these snakes that contain these evil souls and you have the makings of the town freak becoming a murderer. Pretty standard stuff and seems almost laughable. But it is a horror film and you have to make concessions when you see one. What follows is plenty of death scenes, people getting offed in some memorable ways and some genuinely startling scenes.

Overall, Venom truly is an average horror flick. I don't want to give people the wrong impression. This isn't the best horror film I've ever seen. It probably doesn't deserve a 4, but if you can dispel your disbelief, it is pretty decent. But this one is unapologetically R rated and filled with some gore, language and scares. It comes across as feeling like I Know What You Did Last Summer mixed with stylized voodoo with the villain looking like The Swamp Thing. It does provide some nice jumps, a few scares and, if you are afraid of snakes, some neat scary snake moments. I jumped, my friend screamed and best of all? No loud and noisy pre-teens (no offense to the non-noisy pre-teens, I do make a distinction) ruining the movie. And that, in and of itself, warrants a 4 star.",1132704000,2,3156,4.436206896551724
2454543,4,B000C8STW6,"The movie takes place ina small Lousiana town, where a tow-truck driver falls off a bridge with a car that has a box full of of evil snakes. These snakes are used in rituals that involves evil people who souls are sucked out by snakes. This leads the driver to be bitten by the snakes and receive all of their evil souls. He declared dead only to return to kill anyone who stands in his way. It's up to some young teens to try and stop this inhuman being. This movie did offer some good gore and cool deaths, also a bad ass character. There is no need for a thick storyline,when it is going back to old school hack and slash. To sum it up a pretty dam good movie for such a simple plot. I say check it out. I saw this movie in the theater and have no regrets.",1132704000,2,759,4.0
2454544,3,B000C8STW6,"First of all if you want to see this movie, good luck finding it! I saw a couple ads for ""Venom"" and it looked right up my alley, but I could not find it playing anywhere. Finally it came to our small, 45 theater megaplex...and got shoved into the smallest theater in the joint! Luckily the janitor wasn't storing his bucket in there so I had a place to set my $10 coke and $45 bucket of popcorn...(and they wonder why folks aren't lining up to see movies anymore!) Also...I am in full agreement with another reviewer here, that ""Venom"" is refreshing if for no other reason than it's ""R"" rating. I love seeing all of the horror films coming out of Hollywood, but come on, why are they all PG-13? I want some gore, some adult scares, I want my ""R"" rated horror films back! Anyway, ""Venom"" isn't bad, it's your typical slasher flick, and the slasher is given a pretty cool voodoo twist for motive this time around. I don't want to say too much because I hate reviews filled with spoilers. But this could become a franchise if successful at all. I loved the bayou setting, and thought the truck used by the killer was a great visual. The effects are good, and the acting is....slasher flick level acting, but who goes to these movies to see acting anyway? It's a cool little movie that should have been released a little closer to Halloween...don't miss it...if you can find it.",1127865600,,1375,4.438735177865612

8096474,4,B000C8STW6,"When you're in a hurry, pack light.  In this case, pack snakes.  You never know when they might come in handy.  This is especially true when two vehicles park on a bridge so the drivers can have a chat.  A third vehicle comes along and the story begins as Ray Sawyer (Rick Cramer) ends up in the drink with said suitcase full of snakes.  Things do not turn out well for poor Ray, or anyone else who comes in contact with him.

Yes, this is your standard slasher flick, Louisiana style, with a little voodoo tossed in for atmosphere and no sense of danger.  Of course the usual ploys are used, including that old chestnuttrap a group in an isolated house and pick them apart at will.  There are no surprises, just the typical smash and grab.  Rays weapon of choice is a crowbar and a tow truck.  He also proves quite handy with chains.

I like this movie precisely because it is a run-of-the-mill slasher flick.  They accomplished exactly what they set out to do.  It serves its purpose.",1516752000,,986,4.411111111111111
