2052197,5,B00020FV16,"Each time I do the Prana Power Yoga video, I seem to enjoy it more. I have found it to be an amazing introduction to Power Yoga. I have only been doing Power Yoga for 6 months (and I am self-taught-never taken a single class), so I have found Taylor's instruction on all of the poses most helpful. Her video is very comprehensive. She has included quite a few poses that my other videos don't and she also has a nice spiritual bent included. I am now a marathon runner, and this video leaves my muscles stretched and leaves me feeling very relaxed and invigorated. The abdominal section is wonderful - more challenging than any other yoga video that I have. Prana Power Yoga video would be a great resource for anyone interested in starting/improving their Power Yoga practice.",1086825600,,777,4.597122302158273
2052198,5,B00020FV16,"This DVD simply provides wonderful yoga instruction.  Taylor, the instructor, very clearly leads the viewer through the routine which is a fairly vigorrous and fun workout.  Taylor, however, really teaches the yoga student about the more spiritual aspects of yoga.  The video seems professionally produced and is not ""cheesy"", like some yoga videos.  I highly recommned the DVD for both new students and experienced yogis.",1084838400,,422,5.446153846153846
8019458,5,B00020FV16,"My nine year old daughter loves doing yoga to this video. Directions are clear, pacing is fast enough to keep her interest.",1162598400,,123,4.636363636363637
8019459,1,B00020FV16,"I have been doing Yoga for several years, and purchased this video for the purpose of supplementing my regular practice.  Unfortunately, this DVD did not nearly live up to my expectations.  I found Taylor's instructions to be greatly lacking in all respects.  Her rapid-fire, fast-passed delivery as well at her annoying counting made it extremely difficult to get through the video, and more importantly, to get a proper workout.  The video would have been much more beneficial if the focus had been on the poses rather than the close-up's of Taylor where the poses were impossible to view.  Skip this one -there are much better Yoga DVD's out there.  Don't waste your time or your money!!",1120003200,4,690,4.905172413793103
8019460,5,B00020FV16,"This DVD was a much needed escape from the typical fast paced aerobics DVD or running session that I have used in the past- and I was not disappointed in the sweat that I worked up (and work up everytime I come back to Taylor's power flow!).  Taylor's voice is smooth and relaxing, and her instructions are very clear and suitable for both beginners and advanced students.  The flow is unlike any other yoga video I have tried- it is exciting, challenging, relaxing, and spiritually fulfilling all at the same time.  I recommend this DVD for ANYONE who wants to take their fitness to a new level- both spiritually and phisically.",1116460800,,629,4.648648648648648
8019461,4,B00020FV16,"Since yoga should be paced by the breath, we all seem to know just how fast or slow we want to do our yoga, yet realistically, most of us have at least some dynamic range in this regard. Taylor Well's instruction is a little brisker than I like, but to be fair, she starts with a slower, longer-holding warmup before launching into the flow, so you have some time to center, focus, and commit to the practice. Different instructional videos push on our boundaries in different ways. The first time I tried this one, I became a bit frustrated with the pace, and left it on the shelf for several months before trying it again. The second time, knowing what I was getting into, I let go of my resistance and found a new way to enjoy my practice at a quicker pace. An unexpected benefit resulted: I'd never been able to leap all the way back to my hands from down dog; I always had to re-adjust my feet after landing. Something about the quick pace made me activate my abs at the right moment to ""pike"" into position. I only mention this experience to encourage fellow yoga practicioners to be open to differences in instruction rather than faulting one instructor because their teaching style isn't what you are expecting. ""Prana Power Yoga"" is a quick-flowing 1 hour practice. Wells is indoors, in her studio, with her class. There is no music, and Wells narrates throughout, with a good sense of timing, a sparse sprinkling of instruction on body dynamics, and some slightly annoying counting. I still give the video 4 stars because the sequence of the asanas is good, and for me, the practice resulted in a good sweat, and a centered feeling that came from not having enough time in or between the asanas to let the mind wander. A different kind of centeredness than I'm used to, but hey, why not?",1116201600,4,1797,4.532307692307692
8019462,1,B00020FV16,"Well, this is the worst yoga DVD I ever owned. If you are looking for something more than exercise program taped in a small room - forget this DVD.  There are no music, no views, no style, no character what so ever, her voice, well ... I had to turn the volume down - it droved me crazy. And when she started counting 1,2,3 like this was aerobic's class - that was it. For anyone looking for something more than exercise - skip this, though I know how hard it is to find a good quality yoga DVD...",1114214400,2,497,4.071428571428571
8019463,3,B00020FV16,"I was not impressed with this video.  I found it difficult to understand what the instructor was saying, I feel she is speaking to fast at times when switching positions. The camera is focused on her and at times you do not see the poses being performed.
Perhaps those who been doing yoga for some time would find this a better paced video.",1088035200,2,340,4.396825396825397
8019464,5,B00020FV16,"This DVD has been a great addition to my home exercise routine. I am somewhat new to power yoga and have been delighted to see that, not only do I feel more flexible and relaxed after each practice, I also feel like I got a real workout. I was able to pick up the basics of the flow in just one session and Taylor does a great job of pointing out how to modify the postures to accommodate special needs (bad lower back, etc.)  I particularly like Taylor's emphasis on the mental aspects of yoga practice, as opposed to focusing on every little technical detail of the poses. My other yoga tapes spend so much time focusing on where to put your foot, etc. that I get distracted from the actual flow of the practice. I would highly recommend this DVD to folks interested in beginning/improving their power yoga practice or simply adding a new option to their home exercise routine.",1087516800,4,879,4.459627329192546
