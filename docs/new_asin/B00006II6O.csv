1776519,5,B00006II6O,"Over the years Mickey Mouse has become more of a corporate symbol as opposed to a cartoon character in his own right.  Today his smiling face and famous ears grace a million and one products, and he is arguably one of the most famous fictional characters of all time.
Here at last is the original Mickey in the full black and white splendor.  See, perhaps for the first time, why this clever, spunky and all-together likeable little guy achieved the fame he currently enjoys.  Walt Disney Treasures collection continues in a fine tradition with ""Mickey Mouse in Black and White.""  Chronicling the birth and rise of an American icon, included on this DVD are all of Mickey""s black and white shorts.  From the famous first synchronized sound cartoon ""Steamboat Willie"" to his final black and white appearance in ""Mickey's Service Station,""  all 34 toons are included complete and uncut with original soundtracks.
As if this wasn't enough,  ""Mickey Mouse in Black and White"" contains interviews with animators Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston, rare pencil tests and other earlier visualizations of Mickey.  Leonard Maltin adds his commentary has he has on other Disney Treasures DVDs.

1776522,5,B00006II6O,"Moving on to Wave two of Walt Disney Treasures DVD series, we go back to the beginning or at least to the beginning of what separated Disney from it's competitors. After a few bumps, Walt comes up with a little mouse character that would become an American icon and although a much cruder version of the mouse we all know today he was still essentially the same likable hero.

The first disc includes 20 shorts including Mickey's first 'Steamboat Willie' and it looks very good considering its age. The rest of the cartoons like past volumes are in various condition ranging from very good to excellent. While some of them show signs of wear, none of them look so bad that they are not completely watch-able. It is more important that the cartoons are intact with no edits. It does appear that the original title cards have been tampered with on all the shorts on both discs.

The cartoons can be viewed in Chronological order or Alphabetical order, but there is no 'play all ' feature!....a little bizarre? The first disc has some very cool features including story boards and pencil drawing of a few of the cartoons and of course an elaborate stills gallery. It also has a great Easter Egg in which we get to see The Mickey Mouse Club long before it became a TV show. The old news reel footage is pretty interesting and we get a rare cartoon Minnie's Yoo Hoo, which was the first Mickey Mouse Club official song. The first disc rounds out with some interesting facts presented by Leonard Maltin and a nice feature-ette with on screen interviews of two surviving artist from the studio in the early days.

The second disc includes 14 cartoons and some more interesting extras including pencil test, story board sequences and a poster gallery. The set comes in the signature tin and lithograph repo that we have come to expect by now. This is a fine volume showing the growth of Mickey in the early days and I highly recommend this to all animation and Disney fans.

1776533,4,B00006II6O,"This two disc collection from the Disney studios was one of the early Disney Treasures recordings.  In this case, we've got 34 shorts from Mickey's early career.

The collection starts off with the first Mickey cartoon ever, ""Steamboat Willie.""  In it, Mickey is working on a steamboat.  There's very little plot, but lots of fun gags with music.  It does introduce Minnie and the character that would become Peg Leg Pete.

This set collects a sampling of the Mickey shorts from that debut in 1928 to 1935.  Since most movies of the time were black and white, these shorts are all black and white as well.  Over the course of this set, we also get to see the original appearances of Donald, Goofy (called Dopey Dawg at first), and Pluto.

The shorts themselves are of varying quality.  Many of the early ones have no real story and are just a bunch of gags accompanying a soundtrack.  They are fun, but they wear thin quickly.  Fortunately, things improve on the second disc.  We start to get actual stories that incorporate the gags fairly well.  I find these more interesting and fun to watch.

Either way, it is interesting to watch how the animation developed.  To be honest, the early shorts aren't that great to look at.  It's hard to believe that Snow White was only a decade away.  But by the end of the set, the drawings are getting much better, even if Peg Leg Pete's wooden leg seems to jump from leg to leg at will.

Unfortunately, the quality of these shorts shows their age.  There is lots of grain and dust.  The sound is decent.  I do understand the time involved in restoring old films, but it would have been nice if an effort had been made.  But don't misunderstand, these are definitely watchable shorts.  They just aren't as clean as something done in the last two decades.

Ultimately, this is a collection that will appeal to die hard Disney fans.  Casual fans will enjoy parts of it, but us die harders will love every minute.",1203292800,2,1950,4.547550432276657
1776534,5,B00006II6O,"I purchased for the entertainment of the kids of course.  The black and white for the littlest of babies.  Some with just music, less stimulating to the infant. (Not all are subtle of course as voice soon followed the video movement)

Kid's enjoyed somewhat, but probably not as much as Dad in reviewing the classic(ness) of the feature.  Good history of Walt Disney, Mickey and the advent of cartoons from the earliest of days.  Helps to conceptualize how much animation has evolved.",1194393600,,484,4.853658536585366
1776535,5,B00006II6O,"The Walt Disney Treasures series presents these classics quite well. Follow the evolution of Mickey Mouse starting with this collection. Beware though, Mickey wasn't originally created as a ""role-model"" so this set wouldn't be good for children.

Very minor.",1130976000,3,257,5.023809523809524
1776537,5,B00006II6O,"Pretty good stuff for classic animation fans. These cartoons are relatively plotless, but full of funny gags expounded on various situtations.

In particular, I enjoyed BLUE RHYTHM which has Mickey and crew rocking out (or perhaps ""Jazzing out"" is more time-appropriate) to the ""St. Louis Blues."" It's clear that Uncle Walt was a big jazz fan. The first three MM cartoons STEAMBOAT WILLIE, PLANE CRAZY (I like where Mickey tries to kiss Minnie and she resists on the plane-that sly dog!), and GALLOPING GAUCHO are real knee slappers, as are MICKEY'S REVUE, THE KARNIVAL KID, and THE CHAIN GANG.

Yeah, these toons have their moments of political incorrectness. BIG DEAL! The generation of SOUTH PARK, THE SIMPSONS, and LIQUID SWIM, (not even people familiar with TOM & JERRY or the LOONEY TUNES, in fact) et. al. will not be shocked, warped, or traumatized by anything here. Some animal cruelty (by a mouse, at that, but as in LOONEY TUNES it's too offbeat to take seriously as opposed to live-action) abound in Steamboat Willie, and gags involving outhouses, bodily functions, Minnnie's panties, cow udders, drunkenness, et cetera abound elsewhere, but who hasn't seen this kind of thing before? What child who has ever gone out to play isn't aware of such things?

To the crybaby sissy critics who feel that these cartoons are oh-so traumatic for the kiddies and (gasp) so terribly disgusting-go watch Barney and the New Zoo Revue with your raggedy ann dolls!

1776538,5,B00006II6O,"This is out of print, and the only way you can get it is to pay a lot of money for it.  Is it worth it?  Well, I certainly think so.

1776539,3,B00006II6O,"If you can actually acquire these rare DVD's (and the ever-elusive collectible tin), you'll simultaneously be impressed and disppointed.

First and foremost, this collections is a wonderful compilation of vintage 20's and 30's cartoons, not just encompassing the period in which cartoons were popularized and evolved into the form they are today, these black and white shorts define that period.  Each cartoon is in excellent condition, with clean picture and relatively clear sound (although the original audio limitations of these ""sound cartoons"" constitutes the real audio handicap).  While not all of them are in window box format, like Steamboat Willie, they are appropriately croppped to show the maximum picture on your screen.  For some people today, this can be annoying, but for purists this is the best and only way to view old movies.

Unfortunately, Disney DVD's are notoriously substandard compared to other studios, and this is no exception.  The most annoying quirks are the unavoidable introduction at the beginning (why does anybody think we would want to see this every time we insert the DVD?  just give us the main menu please) and the absence of a ""play all"" option (as if anybody would want to have to manually select each chapter on a movie).  In addition, while Leonard Maltin's comments are interesting and informative (including background on Al Jolson's talkie, the Jazz Singer), they can be annoying.  More than anything, the comments seem to be a disclaimer to sanatize some of the more questionable scenes (such as Mickey drinking, smoking, chewing tobacco, etc.) that are nowadays inconsistent with Disney's wholesome image.  Even worse, the exact same and unavoidable disclaimers repeat before multiple chapters (do we really want to see the exact same thing again?).  And of course, as has already been mentioned, the 1928-1935 caption is misleading, as this is only a select few of the cartoons really released from that period.

Three stars for the marvelous content on these discs, but the actual product is lacking.  If only a more compotent vintage company like Kino or Image Entertainment had been able to produce this set, it would be a lot more than just an inferior DVD sold by its collectible tin.

Interestingly enough, Maltin makes one comment about how just because some of the shorts contain unrefined, questionable, and even racist humor, they should not be locked away in the vaults.  Yet, one has to wonder why else Disney has done just that?  After decades of being unavailalbe, the studio makes an inadequate and underproduced supply avaialable, only to seal it up in the vaults again (but as predictable as Disney is, they'll probably re-release it again in 10 years).  Of course, i supppose one has to keep in mind that Disney is marketing mostly to these collectors who appreciate the serial-numbered tin but not the actual cartoons.  If nothing else, Disney could at leat re-release this set without the tin--that's all that's really availalbe anyway.",1096070400,22,3009,5.118609406952965
1776540,4,B00006II6O,"A couple of notes to ""Yarby"".

Leonard Maltin is not a self appointed expert.  He is the author of ""Of Mice and Magic"", the authorative book on theatrical American animation.

If you would check another of Maltin's book ""TV Movies"", he gives ""Song of the South"" a very high rating.  It is BECAUSE of people like Maltin, that the ""questionable"" material in these collections gets shown at all.  There is great presure these days to cut all this material out.  (Note recent bows to pressure stopping screenings of Charlie Chan movies on cable and ""The Birth of a Nation"" at a cinema in Los Angeles.)

Maltin is one of our best American film historians.  If you don't like his screen presence, I recommend you to his numerous books.  He is a fine writer.",1095120000,8,751,4.586466165413534
1776541,3,B00006II6O,"But, of course, you can't but love these cartoons. These were made back when the efforts of the artists weren't constrained by financial considerations. Thus, within the same frame, there are sometimes more than two things going on at once, and often both hilarious. This is what cartoons were meant to be.

The drawback to this set?....the inclusion of the self-appointed movie ""expert"" Leonard Maltin, spoiling an otherwise perfect DVD set. His PC comments, while usually insipid, are also often insulting....pointing out minor ""offensive"" points in the cartoons which in actuality are merely a reflection of the time in which they were made. He seems to think he is the only one who understands this perspective, and he has to explain it to what he must conclude is a brain-dead viewer. It is individuals with thinking such as Maltin's that have prevented such classics as ""Song of the South"" and ""Amos and Andy"" from being released on DVD, on the presumption that the audience is too stupid to evaluate the place in history of such shows.

I guess one would expect this screwed-up perspective from Maltin, having read some of his comments in his books. He always seems to be reprimanding those responsible for movies of the past, instead of ignoring the obvious (the era from which they come) and praising their value.

The only good part about the Leonard Maltin comments? They can be skipped by using the chapter button on the remote. It's just a pity that one has to use it so often. Some of his comments are even tacked on at the beginning of individual cartoons....this is the most annoying of all, just like flies at a picnic.

Of course, since the producers at Disney consider the Maltin sequences bonuses, you really don't get much but the cartoons...and a lot of this nitwit....on this set.

Five stars for the cartoons.....the transfers are as good as can be expected for cartoons of this age.

However a BIG problem I had was one which I've seems to be a problem on MANY Disney DVD's....a random appearance of closed captioning. Closed captions appear at the beginning of many of the cartoons. After a brief appearance, they go away, until the NEXT cartoon is started.

For the ""bonus features"".....negative 10...I prefer my ""picnic"" without the ""flies"". Obviously, based on many of the negative Maltin reviews on this site, I am not the only one.",1092182400,7,2362,4.8316831683168315

it does include every Mickey Mouse cartoon from Steamboat Willie to the mid 30s.
These cartoons show how Mickey evolved in the earliest cartoons to a rattish looking mouse, into the more classic Mickey we know.  Cartoons are violent in some cases (Mickey torturing a cat!!!  Say it aint so!!) to downright adorable.  The DVD extras, including a look at Mickey memorabilia and introductions by Leonard Maltin, as well as a promotional Mickey Mouse cartoon made for Nabisco, make this DVD well worth it.",1087948800,,685,4.779661016949152

The beef has already been noted that this disc does not have the Play it All feature like the color set has. So if you're getting it for little kids there is no ""set it and forget it"" option. They'll either have to know how to move around in a menu or you'll be back at the TV every 5 minutes to advance it to the next cartoon.

The Iwerks-drawn wierdness of ""The Karnival Kid"" justifies the purchase of these discs alone. I regret the absence of a ""Play All"" option but I can see how its omission is justified to prevent the use of this material as electronic babyminder fodder. I have no trouble with the social attitudes and understand many of the jokes of the 1920's/30's but certainly our attitudes about race have changed (I hope) and Al Jolson isn't the easily recognisable stereotype he was when still alive....Leonard Maltin's explanatory announcements before cartoons that would offend the offendable are crystal clear even to those of heightened offensitivity, and preferable to just consigning these cartoons to the bin of history.
If I have a criticism it is that they are not generally available in the uk (all should have the chance to see these).
An especial treat is to see ""Steamboat Willie"" with a sequence not normally seen, it wasn't on the VHS issue of 1982, and despite being featured in an Ub Iwerks documentary had been excised from the copy of the cartoon that followed the documentary!

But it is meant more for the adult who truly appreciates the time and musical work that went into these old but classic shorts.
This is a history of Mickey Mouse in the making. As an adult I truly enjoy seeing different animation styles. These shorts are fun and show the work of a great and forever-living character. I'm very happy that these shorts, which are difficult to find on televison, are now available.

Before I bought this, I had only seen bits and pieces of Steamboat Willie and Plane crazy. I've very proud of owning this DVD set. It even comes in a nice metal container!
The cartoons are very funny. Lots of slapstick, singing objects, and Mickey smoking cigars in front of a beer. In that age of animation, characters were allowed to drink liquor(Tom & Jerry have gotten drunk quite a few times!) and smoke cigars(ohhhh, I've seen lots of that in old cartoons). This is very fun to watch. There's also tons of information, like the cultural reference of a character yelling ""MAMMY!"" when they get soot on their face. There was an entertainer back then that put on black makeup and sang a song called ""MAMMY!"". The term can be offensive to African-Americans today.
I love this DVD set. Some of the visual gags remind me of Tex Avery cartoons. I never knew Walt Disney and his talented crew were THIS good! Definitly something to watch many times. Who CARES if it's black and white, has scratches and is old? It's good stuff.",1050364800,8,1176,4.5
1776551,5,B00006II6O,"Review of the movie: Walt Disney began his animation carrer, working for Chales Mintz; Walt was the creator of many series of silent cartoons (The ""Alice"" shorts, where he mixed live action with animation (he didn't invented it, Max Fleischer invented this) and where Peg Leg Pete made his debut, and the Oswald Rabbit cartoons (something like MM but with long ears)... suddendly, Mintz cut out the money for the WD shorts, and he (and Ub Iwerks) quited, and began to work on their own.
The first attempt to made animation was Mickey Mouse (with silent cartoons (Plane Crazy and Galloping Gaucho)), but it was ignored by the public... then Walt Disney had a great idea!, what if the make sound cartoons? (in a almost speechless era in the movies), and he released ""Steamboat Willie"" that was a big hit in 1928 (Ub Iwerks almost did all the animation for those shorts), from here, Mickey Mouse was a big star, and Felix the Cat and Oswald were straight to the bottom.
The earlier MM cartoons are a little ""surreal"" and with some ""weird humor"" (they were similar to the Felix the Cat shorts..., in these shorts, you can expect some Political Incorrect stuff (like MM torturing animals, or some black faces characters, so parental discression is warned), but affortunatelly, in thos non-PC short, you get a disclaimer from Leonard Maltin.
The DVD review: The remastering of those shorts are good (but could be better... perhaps couldn't be perfect because those shorts are almost 70 years old), the sound is good, but you must not expect a Dolby surround 5.1 (considering the age of the cartoons), the amount of the short are good, but could be better (the second disk only have 2 pages of shorts, while the goofy collection have 4), the extras are good (an interview with Frank and Ollie (animators from the Disney era), some picture galleries) but the best feature of the DVD are the shorts themselves; in the foreign language support, only english audio and closed caption in english (some spanish subtitles would be good, but i guess that the WD treasures are intended for the US market only :( )
This is a great DVD for all the animation fans outthere (like me), but maybe the kids will find it boring; if you find this DVD in stock somewhere, don't hesitate and buy it (because there where only 125000 copies)",1049328000,4,2312,4.711111111111111
1776552,3,B00006II6O,"I got this one mostly because it has the first Mickey film ""Steamboat Willie"", and also out of a sense of curiosity about what the early films were like.
The selections are all pretty clear but still sometimes scratchy, guess the restoration people couldn't fix everything. I found the stories to be rather boring, posibly because the age in which they were produced makes them so alien to modern sensibilities (Maltin touches on this in discussing the types of humor, racial stereotypes were one example).
I found that I didn't like most of the stories except for that one Mickey and the beanstalk story- Giantland(?). I did think it was interesting to see an early version of Goofy, then called Dippy Dawg, little resemblance to Goofy as he is today.
Film students/historians will find something to watch here, casual viewers and small children will be bored.",1047081600,2,861,4.904109589041096

My 4 year-old watches in awe...however, I would love to be able to play these in their entirity so that when I have to take care of something around the house, I don't have to be beholden to the TV every 10 minutes.  Disney managed to set up the ""School House Rock"" DVD in exactly that way.  You have the option of watching any one part, group of shorts together, or the whole DVD uninterrupted...they could have managed with this one.  I am very happy that this is my only complaint, but I don't think I would purchase more like this.",1046217600,4,578,4.275229357798165
1776554,5,B00006II6O,"This collection of  black-and-white Mickey Mouse shorts from the 1920s and 30s is a treasure trove of vintage shorts. Not only does the DVD set feature some of Mickey's better-known shorts like ""Steamboat Willie"" or ""Orphan's Benefit"", but also some equally charming rarities such as ""The Gorilla Mystery"" and ""Blue Rhythm"". All of the included shorts, unlike previoud showings of these shorts on Television,  are also uncensored and many feature introductions by film historian Leonard Maltin to put into perspective what would be considered today as politically incorrect. Bonus features are also included including an interesting look at the original Mickey Mouse Clubs in the 1930s and pencil tests and sketches from the disk's shorts. The shorts themselves may not be as flashy or action-packed as many of today's cartoons, but these music and joke-filled films are full of nostalgia and are must-haves for any Disney fan.",1045785600,4,927,5.299319727891157

Well maybe the genuises wanted the DVD buying community to not be so lazy to not be able to select another cartoon from the menu! Comon people. That is no reason to give a DVD 1 star. This cartoon collection is made for the adults benefit, not some kid who's glued to the television all day. The DVD is fantastic. Leonard Maltin provides introductions for the more ""contrivercial"" cartoons and puts them in their proper context. The picture is superb, especially for these cartoons being almost 70 years old. I hope Warner Brothers realizes that there is a market for classic cartoons and releases their Looney Tunes in this type of format.",1044662400,3,780,4.700729927007299
1776556,5,B00006II6O,"After reading a review of this excellent DVD set on a site called cartoonresearch.com I understand now why there was no ""PLAY ALL"" feature.  Many of these cartoons have many stereotypes, some ""unsocial"" activity from the Mouse, himself and ""Mammy"" of course...these cartoons are not to be shown for 4-year old kids....after all many of you may be parents that would like to sit their child unattended in front of the TV but you can't because of the fact there's no ""PLAY ALL"" feature.  But the kids will probably find these boring and may get the wrong impression.  true, many of you will disagree but the abscence of ""PLAY ALL"" isn't a mistake after all.

As for the play all problem, go to a seldom used option built right into most dvd players: random play. It works great until you hit the chapters that show the storyboards, then you have to manually skip through it. It works better on the Goofy DVD set since there are no storyboards to stall it up. As for the cartoons themselves, my kid loves them. He laughs harder at these than he does most other shows. A blast for all ages.",1044316800,4,584,4.086956521739131
1776558,2,B00006II6O,"Generally I found the title amusing.  I found that the inability to play all shorts without interruption (like on previous ""Treasures..."" releases) rather frustrating.  Maltin's comments while factual and informative really didn't need to dwell on the politically incorrectness of the some of the shorts.  In case most of the viewers didn't realize, all the shorts were done before the ""enlightenment"" of the politically correct movement.
However, what frustrated me the most was:
1. Consistent poor mastering.  I know these are old shorts, I know it was probably difficult - but please, please clean up the sound.  I don't expect 5.1 Digital, but stereo with out hisses and pops would be nice.  I suppose it would be difficult to remove the scratches and other artifacts in the video - but this is their corporate symbol they placed on the DVD, they needed to show some more respect and care.  Disney, next time you release these, clean up the presentation or don't bother.
2. Inconsistency between shorts.  Some shorts started off with the original credits and musical score.  Other shorts started off with a newly created (probably circa 1980's) screen that displayed the year the short was originally released and then it was off to the original credits and musical score.  Even my 6-year-old son noticed the difference - Walt must have rolled in his grave over this lack of attention to details.
Otherwise this title is delightfull and should be purchased by any serious Disney/Mickey Mouse fan.  However, the title felt like it was rushed to market.",1044144000,9,1555,5.011673151750973

1776561,4,B00006II6O,"I'm not going to elaborate on the 2 disc set. As far as I'm concerned, it's a five star set that apoligizes for not being PC.
On disc one, there is a hidden bonus.
STOP HERE IF YOU WANT TO FIND IT YOURSELF.
The hidden bonus is Malton's explanation of the 1920's - 1930's Mickey Mouse club, the (extremely rare) ""Minnie's YooHoo"" cartoon that usually began the Mickey Mouse club meetings, And a news reel on a 2 day festival.
The 2 ways that you can obtain the hidden bonus:
1. First go to the bonus material menu. Then right arrow down till you highlight ""Register your dvd"". Then press the up arrow.
At this point, Mickey's cowboy hat should have turned blue. Press play, and it will start. (Malton intro is chapter 1, Minnie's YooHoo is chapter 2, 2 day festival is chapter 3).
2. After going to the bonus menu, press 6 on your remote.
Incidently, to bypass the nonPC apology from Malton that occurs several times, press the forward to next chapter arrow on your remote (ie: those cartoons that contain the Malton speech are broken up into 2 chapters - the speech (ch. 1), and the cartoon (ch. 2)).
Enjoy.

Addendum: Incidentally,had Malton not put the PC clause in the films (this and many other Disney cartoons), they would have never been released. Disney was concerned about releasing it, and some soft hearted (and soft headed) liberals would surely try to sue the pants off them. This way, there is a warning, and the animations don't have to go through a lot of unnecessary (and unwelcomed) edits. Malton should be thanked, not criticized.",1041120000,49,1548,4.588447653429603
1776562,4,B00006II6O,"This is a wonderful collection of delightful cartoons.  Only some of them have been available on VHS (or VCD) in recent years, sometimes in ""colorized"" versions.  It's an eye-opener to see the original black-and-white animation, which is technically more primitive, but not inferior in energy or artistry, to the color animation that soon displaced it.  I have three reservations.  First, the collection is not complete.  Given that this is a canon that will not be expanded and is not often reissued, it could and should have included all the MM b&w cartoons from 1928 to 1935.  [Postscript: Volume II of Mickey Mouse in Black and White is scheduled for release in December, 2004.] Second, like the player queen in Hamlet, Leonard Maltin ""doth protest too much,"" that is, apologizes too much (at some half-dozen points on the disks)for aspects of the cartoons that would not make it past the censor today.  Are we so Puritanical in 2002 that we need a sociological explanation of Mickey pulling a cat's tail, or smoking a cigarette?  These are cartoons, for Pete's sake. Even the arguably more offensive matters, such as (mild) racial stereotypes, are over-explained by Maltin.  Perhaps this was necessary to get the cartoons past today's guardians of political correctness, but I hope not.  Finally, and most important, the cartoons show the destructive effect of time on negatives and prints, with little evidence of clean-up. One hoped for more effort at digital restoration, a la the Snow White DVD.  But these are tough times at Disney, and perhaps budgets are restricted.",1040947200,5,1578,5.054054054054054
1776569,4,B00006II6O,"I have waited and hoped for years that these old B&W cartoons would be released on DVD. My friends all call me crazy because teh first thing I played on my state of the art DVD player and HD TV projection home theater system was ""Skeleton Dance"".
I love these cartoons, and enjoy Maltin's setting up of the context of these gems.
But one of my favorite ways to play the other colleciotns Mickey Mouse and the Silly Simphonies) is to let them play continuously in hte background at parties.
This DVD does not allow that. It REALLY irks me! I'm hoping that it is just an oversight and will be corrected in a revision. I'd be happy to buy it over again to get that feature.",1040860800,5,670,4.283464566929134
1776570,4,B00006II6O,"Having grown up with the impression that Micky Mouse was no more than a wholesome, no nonsense gentlemouse (who, honestly, bored most of the kids of my generation), I was truly shocked when I first put in these DVDs. Mickey once burgeoned with personality and naughtiness.
""Steamboat Willie"" has Mickey turning animals into musical instruments by beating on them, squishing them, stepping on them, throwing them by their tails, etc. If that wasn't enough ""Plane Crazy"" has Mickey torturing poor Minnie in a small airplane: when she refuses to kiss him, he rolls the plane, dives and barnstorms. When the plane is again level, Minnie is trembling with fear. Mickey just smiles and asks once again for a kiss. This clearly isn't the Mickey Mouse I know, and I was beginning to suspect why these black and white cartoons were so hard to find. Years ago, there was an edition put out on laser disc (remember those?!?!) but that's the only other definitive collection I've ever seen until now. Perhaps Disney didn't want to soil Mickey's reputation, as Leonard Maltin says in one of the DVDs commentaries.
If you can swallow a little cruelty and early twentieth century sterotypes (there are numerous ""Mammy"" references as well, and Native Americans are treated rather badly in one toon where they're depicted as scalping, hooting bloodthirsty wolves) these cartoons are a blast. I didn't expect to laugh so much, particularly at the early toons by Ub Iwerks(one of the greatest names of all time). They have a style and personality that the late Mickey lacks to this day.
The DVD set also shows Mickey becoming more and more ""proper"" as the years go on. By disk two the hilarity starts to calm, and I found myself laughing less and less until disk two's finale: ""Mickey's Service Station"" which has Mickey, Donald and Goofy in their familar roles. It's a good way to end the disk.
The supplementary material is also helpful, but Leonard Maltin's commentary could have been compacted into one presentation rather than spread throughout the DVDs. I became annoyed with seeing Maltin every third or fourth time I pressed ""Play"" when I expected to see a cartoon. His commentary and interviews do give good background information, but I would rather not have them shoved in my face.
In short, a great collection that explains Mickey Mouse's popularity for those of us unfamiliar with his early wild days, and a host of culturally significant debuts: Mickey, Minnie, Goofy, Donald, Pluto. Buy it and get to know all sides of the mouse that once roared very loudly and naughtily.",1040601600,2,2568,4.8922018348623855
1776571,4,B00006II6O,"This is a set that has been deserving to be put out for the past decade. As stated in other reviews, not all of the Mickey B&W cartoons are here, but the character is well represented by what is here. Its fun to watch the character evolve from Plane Crazy and Steamboat Willie as a happy-go-lucky sort to Mickey's Service Station where he is in the process of being straight man to Donald Duck and Goofy. The majority of the cartoons are fun to watch some near 70 years after their premiere with the sight gags usually associated with cartoons take a back seat to the musical and sound experimenting the studio revolutionized in animation. The sets only drawbacks are that the collection is incomplete (hopefully another Mickey set is due) and the play feature does not let you watch one cartoon to another as you have to select each and everyone. If you're looking at this set to make you feel the kid in your heart and relive times long ago, you'll not be disappointed and its well worth the price.",1039392000,,1000,4.5

1776573,4,B00006II6O,"I was leery of this set, but bought it without hesitation. My greatest concern was that the highly revisionist modern-day Disney would butcher these early, rude 'n' crude Mickey Mouse cartoons, which are rife with animal abuse, drinking, smoking and racial/cultural stereotypes. These cartoons are so much better and livelier than the stale, dull ""Silly Symphonies,"" which are important historically but bland as tapioca. Maltin provides on-screen mea culpas for the blackface gags and outhouse humor, but defends every American's right to see these pieces of our cultural history, and to view them with hindsight and intelligence. That said, these 34 cartoons are corkers. It will surprise some to see how zany and surrealistic these early Mickeys are. They are almost as daffy as the pre-Code Betty Boop cartoons of the Fleischer brothers. My favorite is the anarchic ""The Karnival Kid,"" a 1928 cartoon that made me laugh non-stop. Transfers are decent, considering the age and condition of these films. Some obviously suffered vault neglect, and given the volatility of nitrate film stock, I suppose we're lucky to have them at all. There is little to no tampering that I could see, tho' the 1930-32 cartoons have something weird going on with the title cards. You'll see what I mean when you view them. I wonder why they re-did the cartoon titles, and why they're so jerky and wobbly. The extras are quite thoughtful, and more substantial than on the ""Silly Symphonies"" set. This is essential viewing for anyone who loves the rough and tumble days of pioneer animation.",1039132800,27,1573,5.077220077220077
1776574,5,B00006II6O,"That's right, Mickey's somewhat of an animal abuser, politically incorrect and sexist! IT'S GREAT! Disney has impressed me this time around, by making this collection FOR ADULTS. Thank you! In the uncensored ""Steamboat Willie"", Mickey plays a female hog's teats like a xylophone! Wait'll you see the script for this scene! He kicks animals out of the way, forces his affections on Minnie in a couple of cartoons...man! Mickey kicks some serious butt in these old 'toons that begin in 1928 and run thru 1935. Let's face it, not many young kids will get a kick out of these...they won't care for the antique animation, the black and white, the lack of special effects or even the plotlines. But we who appreciate these early 'toons for their POLITICAL INCORRECTNESS, nostalgia and artwork need this in our collections. Included is an Easter egg of the FIRST ""Mickey Mouse Club"", a club that was held in movie theaters in the 30's. You will definitely get a kick out of these...you can view them in chronological or alphabetical order as well. Thanks again, Disney...looks like you're getting on the right track for those who were the first to grow up with you.",1039132800,,1158,4.824120603015075
1776575,5,B00006II6O,"Of Mickey Mouse, E.M. Forster once noted, ""Certainly one would not recognize him in a trap.""  This collection of early Mouse cartoons shows Mickey before he became a corporate symbol and his impish humor was toned down.  (In the course of the series, you can see Mickey's character whittled down to a mere straight man, while supporting characters gradually steal the lion's share of laughs.)

Many of these cartoons were made before the Production Code was enforced, and they feature language and behavior that would shock a family audience today.  But for animation fans who complain that the Disney studio was always too innocent and sentimental for its own good, this package is a useful corrective.  It's about as far away from fairy tales and suburban reveries as it can get -- much closer to the surreal antics of the Fleischer studio than the sitcom blandness of later Disney films.

The quality of video and audio transfers varies widely from cartoon to cartoon.  The picture ranges from adequate to excellent, and the sound, adapted from original source materials, is quite good given the age and condition of the source material.  The plentiful extras are geared more to animation buffs than general viewers, but they're consistently interesting.  Disney has put together a terrific package here, possibly the best of the ""Walt Disney Treasures"" series to date.

1776577,5,B00006II6O,"Despite this being a seminal moment in DVD history having the black and white Mickey Mouse cartoons available in the best possible digital format, this Disney Treasures collection is not a complete set.  As mentioned, this set will contain 34 black and white MM shorts, but they are only selections out of about 75 made between 1928-1935.  Last year's ""Silly Symphonies"" collection was put together in a similar way with a little more than half of the 73 or so made.  Rumors are that next year's DT series will include a ""Mickey Mouse in Living Color Vol. 2"", which means that host/compiler Leonard Maltin possibly intends to include second volumes of past and future collections in this series that don't contain everything in one set due to large amounts originally produced.  When these MM black and white shorts were available on laserdisc years ago, they were also released in two volumes.

Here is a complete list of the B&W selections on this collection (year-by-year) straight from the Disney press release:

1928--""Steamboat Willie"", ""The Gallopin' Gaucho"", ""Plane Crazy"" (actually the first official Mickey Mouse short--originally silent with sound added later and re-released following the success of ""SW"").

1929--""The Karnival Kid"", ""Mickey's Follies""

1930--""The Fire Fighters"", ""The Chain Gang"", ""The Gorilla Mystery"", ""The Pioneer Days""

1931--""The Birthday Party"", ""Mickey Steps Out"", ""Blue Rhythm"", ""Mickey Cuts Up"", ""Mickey's Orphans""

1932--""The Duck Hunt"", ""Mickey's Revue"", ""Mickey's Nightmare"", ""The Whoopee Party"", ""Touchdown Mickey"", ""The Klondike Kid""

1933--""Building a Building"", ""The Mad Doctor"", ""Ye Olden Days"", ""The Mail Pilot"", ""Mickey's Gala Premiere"", ""Puppy Love"", ""The Pet Store"", ""Giantland""

1934--""Camping Out"", ""Gulliver Mickey"", ""Orphan's Benefit"", ""The Dognapper"", ""Two-Gun Mickey""

1935--""Mickey's Service Station"" (Curiously, ""Mickey's Kangaroo"" is not included here. This was really the last B&W Mickey cartoon done shortly after he premiered in color in ""The Band Concert"").

The press release has stated that, in addition to all the features mentioned above, there will also be rare footage of the only MM B&W pencil test known to exist.  This pencil test was done for ""The Mail Pilot.""  Also, new interviews were apparently done with the legendary animators Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston for the documentary.  Much-needed audio commentary (presumably by Leonard Maltin) has also been added to the poster gallery on disc 2 that was absent from last year's ""Mickey Mouse in Living Color.""

For those not acquainted with last year's ""Mickey Mouse in Living Color"": that collection collects Mickey's first three years in color between 1935-1938.  Next year's rumored Vol. 2 will probably complete the color Mickey, going up to his last short under Walt Disney--""The Simple Things"" (1953).

More rumors for next year's DT series: ""Wartime Cartoons"" (originally intended for this year) and ""The Chronological Donald"" (obviously the first phase of the many Donald Duck cartoons produced through the 1930's-1960's).",1032566400,139,3058,5.535483870967742
