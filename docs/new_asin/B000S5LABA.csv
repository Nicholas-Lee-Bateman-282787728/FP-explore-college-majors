They've yet to ever disappointment me.",1266624000,2,820,5.157894736842105

8204279,4,B000S5LABA,"I rate this a 4 stars!!! Not because of quality, because the quality is great.... Not because of sound.. because the sound is AWESOME....  but because of the damn dvd is a region 2... and most dvd players in America do not play region 2 dvds....  :(  other than that.. this is a Must have Item for a GazettE fan!!!!!",1222732800,,316,4.233333333333333
8204280,5,B000S5LABA,"I ordered this DVD for myself and I watch it almost every day. The production value is great and you even get some backstage footage. They don't show the whole encore (which is sad) but what they do show is an amazing concert with great sound. If you are a GazettE fan it is a must have. And if you aren't that big on them GET IT ANYWAY, It will change your mind and you will be in love with the passion they throw into their music.",1222473600,,432,3.9770114942528734
