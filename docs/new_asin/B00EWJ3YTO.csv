We need those and we need to be informed in that way, but what I loved about this film is that, by the end of it, I felt great about America and the world.
As a European, we do have a fascination about America, there was always a ""mirage"" attached to it. This film is able to proof this ""mirage"" really exists...America is indeed a fascinating place!!!
I can't recommend this film enough! I think everyone is really going to love it!",1383523200,,588,4.3545454545454545

I am not a film critic, but like most people, I do have an opinion, I can reflect and have a reaction to something. I therefore will not judge any technique, dialogue or wardrobe choices, but I will share how it made me feel, what it made me think and what I took away from it.

One of the reasons this film captured my interest was because it was made by two men, one British and the other Australian. While neither were raised in the U.S., each had eventually made the U.S. his home because visits to America during his youth captured his imagination.

Others opinions and interpretations of us here in the USA have always been of interest  opinions of actions that have, rightly so I my opinion, labeled some of us ugly Americans for example. Outsiders eyes focused on our potential or current stereotypes can be the glaring spot light we need, as it could make us evaluate what is behind our actions. Then, in this perfect world Im imagining, we humbly alter the behavior or respectfully offer explanation of just why it is so damn important we do that.

This American Journey is a series of unplanned, random interviews post 2008 elections from everyday Americans and their thoughts on the country, politics, the economy, energy policies, religion and how these matters currently effect their lives. The only thing planned was the route - over three thousand miles by car beginning in New York City to Southern California through the deep South, the Mid and Southwest.

Some amazing stories were shared by an eclectic range of people including: a 'practically' homeless musician, a gas station attendant, a Wall Street insider, a Marine, a cowboy Preacher, a wise women of Taos, Judges, store owners, store clerks, nurses, and a gun buyer.

Over all, I was definitely left with a feeling of hope and a belief that the typical folk of the U.S. do have it. I was also often reminded that appearances are misleading as nearly all of the participants clearly expressed their disappointments with the state of the Country, could acknowledge that we are losing our way but that they understood change requires all of US to make it happen.

Interjections and reactions from the filmmakers frame and complement the experience for viewers, giving me a sense of their involvement - they really did want to know, it wasn't just a project for them.

It's a quest of sorts to rediscover the America as Blackthorne & Basqaili knew it long ago. The results? In spite of the cold weather, eating on the road, the wonderful motel accommodations and the fact that these two were perfect strangers just a couple weeks before they ventured out across the country, they collected over eighty interviews, gleaned some life lessons, a puppy they named Bodhi and then put together a film you SHOULD SEE.

And their adventure did make me think, what answers would I have given if these two strange men and their camera approached me?",1383436800,5,2954,4.75390625
5948947,5,B00EWJ3YTO,My favorite part is the fact that you assume a lot about the people being interviewed~until they speak~and then you end up with a story that is completely unexpected~Loved the bath tub scene :>),1395187200,5,194,4.735294117647059
5948948,5,B00EWJ3YTO,Great movie by these guys.  Doesn't take itself too seriously and is both thought-provoking and funny. A great documentary film that shows you the impact of the financial downturn on various parts of the U.S.,1393891200,2,208,4.942857142857143
5948949,5,B00EWJ3YTO,"I chose this five star rating because I assumed the people Paul Blackthorne interviewed would respond in a certain manor, and I was pleasantly surprised by most of their reactions...Mr. Blackthorne did an excellent job of both interviewing and directing, ""This American Journey""...It was a pleasure to watch!",1393113600,3,308,5.4375
5948950,5,B00EWJ3YTO,"This film is an excellent lesson on Humanities. It will leave you inspired, surprised, heartbroken and in absolut awe of the cross section of cultural diversity, political and religious beliefs across America.",1393027200,,209,5.5625
5948951,5,B00EWJ3YTO,I loved this move.  I thought it was quite touching and a fun look at America.  Especially the folks in the mid-west.  And what a cute puppy!,1391731200,,141,4.148148148148148
5948952,5,B00EWJ3YTO,"I purchased the DVD as a gift for a family member, having been familiar with Blackthorne from TV work going back a number of years. We all watched and loved it.

This isn't a detached, academic documentary. The filmmakers are part of the narrative. If that's not the type of documentary you're comfortable with, then you probably won't enjoy this. Which is, sadly, your loss.

Personally, I find the more informal storytelling deeply effective and affecting. It acknowledges that it would be silly to claim you can encompass the realities of an entire nation via two guys driving across the country in a van. Instead, it focuses on trying to grasp the more ephemeral heart and soul through vignettes with (mainly) chance encounters. These casual chats are interspersed with some personal comments from the filmmakers that give them a context.

Of course, no film story is successful without some good cinematography, and it walks the line between ""up close and personal"" and ""scenic"" very well. It has a suitable cinema verite vibe without compromising quality or missing the chance for some gorgeous vistas.

In the end, it effectively takes a series of snapshots about the American experience, frames them from the perspective of two ""foreigners"" living here, and manages to create a whole picture that's really about the human experience. It's a lofty goal but undertaken with so little pretension that it's all the more moving.",1390867200,6,1431,5.0508474576271185
5948953,2,B00EWJ3YTO,"You can't see much of America in this movie. Some passages, like informal conversations between the two travelers are not necessary (the scene in the bathroom -- unacceptable). I expected to watch the places, not just local people talking about American problems in a chaotic way. Boring!",1390867200,,288,5.148936170212766
5948954,5,B00EWJ3YTO,"This was a wonderful journey to take across America.  We have become so jaded and so judgmental in our society, this movie takes you on a journey of discovering what real people are really thinking and how we judge someone by their socioeconomic status and physical appearance, without bothering to get to know them...Mr. Blackthorne takes the time to ask and listen.",1390608000,2,367,4.919354838709677
5948955,5,B00EWJ3YTO,"Truly a wonderful, thoughtful and heartfelt documentary.  Great to see that above all, the American people still have hope and continue to work towards a better future.  I highly recommend this movie!  The extras are well worth it too.",1388620800,2,235,4.9743589743589745
5948956,5,B00EWJ3YTO,"This is perhaps the best documentary I've seen on American. Paul Blackthorne  and Mister Basquali take us on and adventure to discover America the land that they have chosen to live in. They didn't sugar coat it, they didn't only show the good, they also showed that bad and the ugly. In my opinion the showed the true spirit of america in picture and sound; they captured what makes America great and why it will continue to grow and become even better despite all of it's problems and warts.  It shows what makes America great is it's people and their determination to make America a better place to live. Buy this DVD! You will want to watch it with your family and friends and I know I will watch it again myself because I loved it so much!",1386374400,2,744,4.384057971014493
8610035,5,B00EWJ3YTO,What a lovely man and a great adventure! Made me want to pack some snacks and a puppy and drive across the US myself. Asked some hard hitting questions a lot of people would be afraid to..so bravo!,1522627200,,197,4.2105263157894735
8610036,1,B00EWJ3YTO,A little bit lame.  I know Paul Blackthorne from Movies and did not expect him to be such a dweeb .,1503187200,,99,3.7142857142857144

8610038,5,B00EWJ3YTO,"An interesting look at America during hard times. The interviews with citizens from NY to LA are often surprising and up lifting. If you ever wanted to travel across America and learn what others think of the government actions and policies, faith, green energy, etc., in a civil and thoughtful manner, you'll like this road trip documentary.",1483056000,,342,5.017543859649122
8610039,5,B00EWJ3YTO,"It was very well edited, and well shot. I also loved how the two filmmakers incorporated their own thoughts, while keeping the main focus on the strangers they encountered. I'll be recommending this documentary for sure!",1462233600,,220,5.138888888888889

8610043,5,B00EWJ3YTO,"I can't rave enough about this delightful film/documentary. Entertaining, enlightening, inspiring. You will want to see this duo travel to other destinations. They let the people they meet speak for themselves.  The movie reveals the rich tapestry of thinking and political and social views in the US. And most striking was the level of intelligence and insight that many people have.",1413072000,,384,5.295081967213115
8610044,5,B00EWJ3YTO,I think this is a brilliant insight to the events in America today.  Not living there it gives you a slight look into what some people think is happening to America today.  Well done Paul x,1396742400,3,189,4.222222222222222
