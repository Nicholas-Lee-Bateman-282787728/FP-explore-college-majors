8362216,1,B002BWD7CS,Quite possibly the worst thing ever to appear on a screen.  Supposed documentarians interview numerous people about two guys nominated for Stuntman of the Year. Some famous faces do appear and they should be ashamed of themselves for any $ the received. Just a lot of useless talking (some swearing). AVOID!,1436227200,,307,5.019607843137255

8362218,3,B002BWD7CS,"This movie had so much potential but fell short for me. Ross Patterson's performance was great as always, but the laugh to length ratio of the film just left so much to be desired. Notable cast members include Taylor Negron, Lin Shaye, Ross Patterson, and Alanna Ubach. If you are a big fan of any of them then it is certainly worth a purchase.",1430092800,,344,4.390625

8362220,5,B002BWD7CS,This film is totally unique and fun with an unexpected plot!  I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a fun film.,1370390400,,123,4.3478260869565215
8362221,5,B002BWD7CS,"The movie it self is awesome! If you like mockumentaries, Stuntmen is one of the best. It has many great actors that will surprise you.",1259539200,6,135,4.44
