For some reason (explained at the end) Gerry Anderson (Casper) is sent a secret DNA code by Russians who dress in black/navy blue and walk to heavy bass music. However Gerry didn't get them. Instead his daughter got them by accidentally printing out a ream of printer paper in an effort to print out a drawing she did on a computer of a horse (dad kids her and calls it a giraffe). She hides the paper in her school bag unbeknown to Dad. He has her for the weekend while his wife (MILF Oxenberg) is ...? I'm not sure. The Russians show up and trash his place and try to get him, but he gets away. When the cops show up there is no sign of anyone being there, including the dead body. The movie steals bad lines from other movies in an attempt to be cute such as ""Woman: Can't live with them. Can't shoot them.""

Even the seduction scene was lame. No sex. No nudity. They could have at least teased us by having the woman run the shower and showing her drop a towel on the floor. If your going to steal from other films, take something good. The action was slow paced and not very exciting even during the action scenes. The movie suffered from a bad script. I though India Oxenberg did a good job as a child actor. Van Dien is her real life step-dad and her mother played her mother who once dated John Kerry. During his run for the President, Karl Rove started a muck campaign claiming she was his daughter.",1361404800,,1539,4.181818181818182
