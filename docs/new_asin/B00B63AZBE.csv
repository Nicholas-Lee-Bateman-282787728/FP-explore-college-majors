8563156,5,B00B63AZBE,"Just Planes has produced many excellent videos of operations at various world airports. Their newer Blu-Ray releases are even better as the Blu-Ray process increases the sharpness of the images and thereby makes the videos more enjoyable. This particular Vancouver airport video joins several others in this process and is informative. The two opening landing sequences from a pilot's cockpit viewpoint are a nice touch. In addition Vancouver has two large float plane facilities, one at the south side of the airport itself and another in the downtown area. Both of these are shown with their busy operations. Otherwise the variety of air carriers and aircraft types in use at the main airport is indeed enjoyable.",1479254400,,715,5.172413793103448
8563157,1,B00B63AZBE,"This video did not go in to very much detail about any area. It seems to have been sponsered by local sites/restaurants. Also, I ordered it because it was a 2009 release. Most of the video was obviously shot in the 1980's. The quality of the picutre is horrible. I would not buy this video.",1250726400,,290,4.290909090909091
