7209222,1,B00Y9DSVMS,"MGM have decided reissue Mad max yet again as 35th Anniversary edition
this is the 3rd time they've reissued the film on blu-ray with exact same content as their previous blu-ray's
and guess what there's absolutely nothing special about this new blu-ray version
it's an insult MGM are advertising it as 35th anniversary edition, when it isn't
there is no new special features at all
the extras on this new 35th version are exactly the same from the previous blu-ray version of Mad max
the only Difference is the cover art actually
it's a bulls*** release if you ask me
if you love this film your better of buying the shoutfactory/scream factory blu-ray version
which has lots & lots of special features
 there's a new retrospective featurette about the film which has new exclusive interviews
with Mel Gibson , Joanne samuel, David Eggby, goes for about 30mins
plus other interviews & Audio commentaries from the old MGM dvd
so your better off buying the Scream factory version , not this rubbish 35th anniversary from MGM
1 star for this new reissue, 5 stars for the scream factory blu-ray",1443571200,65,1090,4.797872340425532

7209224,5,B00Y9DSVMS,"this is a awesome movie. i didn't know that this movie was Mel Gibbsons first role. he did an outstanding job on playing Max. can't belive that this is the movie that started his career and i didn't know that he was from Australia. this is a great film. the special effects are ok but for the time the movie was made they were good, the story is good and the action and acting is good. this is one of those 1980's  movies that everyone loves and became a cult classic. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do",1437523200,,524,4.087378640776699

7209227,1,B00Y9DSVMS,"Movie is a classic.  The movie itself receives 5 stars from me.  The single star is for the horrible pakage that the movie has been put into.  The digital copy is Ultraviolet rather than iTunes; movie aficionados as well as those who use digital copies know that iTunes is the better option but this isn't the forum for that debate.  Second, the movie itself is not the original movie, it is the dubbed version, removing the Australian accents and the Australian English used in the original movie.  Why not include both?  A 35th anniversary product with the actual original product missing?  The product was thrown together to make a quick buck off of Fury Road's near future Blu-ray release.  Insulting to the fans as well as the collectors.  The other version here on Amazon, the collector's edition, includes the original Australian version, the dubbed version & several interviews and documentaries... this one has the trailer for the movie... big deal.  The collector's edition is by far the better value.",1436918400,31,1011,4.928994082840236
8717739,5,B00Y9DSVMS,I'm glad that I bought this for my collection,1521158400,,45,4.111111111111111
8717740,4,B00Y9DSVMS,I love the movie and the BLU-RAY performed flawlessly.  I was mildly disappointed because the case was plastic not metal as I had been expecting.  Or is it plastic encased metal?  The spine is definitely metal.,1517270400,,210,4.777777777777778
8717741,5,B00Y9DSVMS,"Another classic movie. Glad to have a blu ray version. Not sure why the product description says Tim Burns. Of course, Mel Gibson is the star.",1515283200,,142,4.5
8717742,3,B00Y9DSVMS,"Can't fault the movie. 5 Stars there. It is a classic.
But FYI to anyone buying with Movies Anywhere in mind: as of 2017-11-28 the digital copy included in this does NOT qualify for Movies Anywhere, AND it will only allow you to redeem it on UltraViolet -OR- Google Play, not both, and not iTunes at all. So 2 stars off for that.

To some of the other reviewers who seem to enjoy taking shots at those of us who review both the movie AND the product, I am reviewing WHAT I BOUGHT, part of which includes a digital copy. That the studios, after all this time, still continue to attempt to control my digital choices artificially is unacceptable; as long as they continue to be unwilling to clearly indicate in product descriptions what digital rights are and are not included, I am going to continue docking stars on their product. This is a ""them"" issue, not an ""us"" issue.",1511827200,3,873,4.45625
8717743,5,B00Y9DSVMS,"It's Mad Max,
impossible to rate it below 5 starts!

One of my all time favorite movies from the first time I saw it on ""The Movie Loft"" (TV) as a kid.

The ""Multi-Format"" version was $7.88 & got me the Blu Ray (to replace my DVD),
and (what I really wanted) an Ultraviolet Digital Copy of the movie.

It also came with 4 roughly postcard sized still pictures from the making of the movie.

I haven't had cable in 7 or 8 years,
so keeping my favorite movies like this available to stream (I use Vudu) means there's always something on that I like!

Random info:
My movie did actually come in a Red Blu Ray case as pictured if that matters to anyone,
I've ordered others pictured that way, but this is the first time I actually got it in a red case.",1505520000,,748,4.13103448275862

8717745,4,B00Y9DSVMS,Transfer to BluRay sucks! But still a great classic film. Had they taken the time to upgrade and refine and remaster the transfer then definitely 5 stars. Sad. But worth owning.,1499904000,,177,4.741935483870968
8717746,5,B00Y9DSVMS,there is review 4 this movie on here that states that the it only has the English dubbed audio version & not the original Australian English accent audio... not true. Both options are available under the audio set-up for the movie & listed on the back in the audio selection!! too bad they didn't pay a little bit more attention!,1497744000,,329,4.5
