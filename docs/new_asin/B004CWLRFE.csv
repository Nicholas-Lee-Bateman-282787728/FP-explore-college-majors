4329297,5,B004CWLRFE,"Love the books, love the show.  The scenery and characters are easy to watch, although I think the translation could be a bit better.
I will be sad when I have finished all the episodes, there isn't anything like this on American tv.",1365120000,,233,4.4186046511627906
4329298,5,B004CWLRFE,"Even if you are not studying Italian, as I am, you will find these very entertaining. The ensemble of characters is quite engaging and dynamic, and the stories are inspired. I only wish there were more episodes, as I am far from tired of this series. If you are studying questa bella lingua, it's an enjoyable way to hear it spoken at a normal conversational tempo, while you benefit from the helpful English subtitles. I consider this program superior in quality to ordinary American tv crime dramas, and recommend it heartily.",1355443200,4,528,4.813186813186813
4329299,5,B004CWLRFE,"We have been hooked on this great series of mysteries from Sicily!  His personality and those of his subordinates in addition to the native population are great entertainment and a look into their culture.

Our only regret is that there are only 22 episodes!",1345248000,,258,4.840909090909091
4329300,4,B004CWLRFE,"In our insatiable thirst for detective thrillers, foreign language productions have the benefit of introducing us to a different way of life in a setting which might well suggest the location of our next holiday.

In this case, the drama is set in the fictional Vigata, a quaint old stone-built town spreading over a hilly Sicilian coastline bathed in perpetual sunshine. Detective Montalbano occupies an elegant flat overlooking the Mediterranean where he can relax swimming at the end of each stressful episode.

We are introduced to a slow-paced (apart from the crimes, that is) way of life revolving round food - a man will put the enjoyment of a good meal before rushing to greet his lover - and the extended family, where relatives and workers gather on a sunny terrace to consume plentiful meals together.

Smartly turned out and astute, Montalbano somehow commands the respect of his staff despite the kind of volcanic outbursts which would have him sent on an anger management course in Britain. Like most detectives, he is on shaky terms with more senior officials, perhaps in part owing to his tendency to break the rules, but survives in his post, probably because he always seems to solve the crime in hand, usually through his ability to make deductions from very slim evidence.

The denouement is often unpredictable, partly because the very complicated plot tends to have a few twists which are hard to follow - and to be honest at times implausible. It's quite fast-moving, so with the sub-titles as an added constraint you have to concentrate.

Overall, it's worth watching as the characters are well-developed, the dialogue is amusing, the cases have intriguing aspects, and all does not end happily in every respect - there is a gritty undercurrent, say in the suffering of Tunisian immigrants in ""The Snack Thief"" or the continual hints at bribery and corruption amongst higher ranking officials, making the ""honest"" Montalbano a rarity.",1335225600,,1958,5.030864197530864
4329301,5,B004CWLRFE,"This series never ceases to entertain me.  The discs gave me no problem, as one reviewer said.  I can't wait for the next episodes to become available.",1311984000,,151,4.555555555555555
4329302,5,B004CWLRFE,"The DVDs are NOT defective, contrary to what a previous reviewer has said. Additionally, all the performances are terrific, especially Luca Zingaretti. The Sicilian landscape and interiors are as beautiful as ever and the dialogue is entertaining, although sometimes the translation leaves something to be desired. Don't miss these episodes if you like the Montalbano books!",1309910400,2,374,5.696428571428571
4329303,5,B004CWLRFE,"The three episodes include:

4329342,5,B004CWLRFE,"Montalbano is always Montalbano; meaning that he is better in my estimation than any other current fictional detective.  He and his crew work, and banter, with each other like real life people.  And, there is a great deal of humor present, even in serious criminal investigations -- just as there is in every day police work.",1381363200,3,325,4.785714285714286
4329343,4,B004CWLRFE,"As usual, Montalbano's investigations are interesting and full of drama. Nonetheless, the outcome of one of the chapters is quite predictable; that's why I'm giving a 4 star instead of a 5.
