8614895,4,B00FEMGBXO,"Vladimir Fedoseyev and his Moscow Radio Symphony Orchestra (now: Tchaikovsky Symphony Orchestra) have given us a splendid Tchaikovsky Cycle on DVD (Arthaus, see my review) recorded live in the Alte Oper Frankfurt 1991, for todays standards in slightly dated video but still in very acceptable audio.  The new set was recorded live in the Vienna Musikvereins-Saal in March 2009 in good, but not outstanding PCM Stereo. The recording level is fairly low, and you may have to crank up your amplifier. As to the video, it is technically fine, however the camera often bores us with endless pans/zooms of the hall instead of staying with the orchestra sections: this is quite annoying. Long shots of the Musikvereins-Saal show that the camera team was much less interested in the music making than in the venue. Even when the focus is on the musicians or the conductor, it is erratic. This is even more deplorable as the Moscow musicians as an ensemble as well as in groups or solo work are excellent and deserve better. So does Fedoseyev who has his musicians so well prepared that they play on the beat  not after the beat as many European orchestras do.

In case you had any doubts about their expertise in the classical-romantic repertoire, forget them. The Beethoven Second is exceedingly well done: both muscular and sensitive to the finer nuances, very much up to par with todays best readings. This applies to the gravitas of the first movement with its Marseillaise allusions and the entire score up to the brisk  but never blurry  finale. I would have wished for a bit more tenderness in the shimmering second movement and for less slowing down in the Scherzos trio, but this is a matter of personal taste.

If you are familiar with Fedoseyevs earlier Tchaikovsky Cycle (DVD, Arthaus), you will appreciate that he re-visits the Fifth Symphony in the same spirit but also with fresh insights. With the exception of the finale, the tempi in both recordings are very similar. The first movement, from the brooding initial bars to the powerful resolution at the end, is quite monumental, albeit touched by some valedictory melancholy. The Andante cantabile and the Valse are equally graceful and, as can be expected, played with idiomatic perfection. Surprisingly, the finale clocks in at 11:59 (as opposed to the earlier reading at 13:58) and is more gripping and passionate than the earlier version which has quiet moments of introspection and is altogether statelier and almost festive. Both are convincing in their own way. The disk also has a couple of charming encores, performed with smiling gusto by all concerned.

All in all, this is a great Fifth, very different from but equal to Valery Gergievs interpretation with the Mariinsky Orchestra (DVD Mariinsky 2011). I would gladly give the disk five stars, but the stupid camera work calls for a demerit point.",1389657600,3,2869,4.952182952182953
