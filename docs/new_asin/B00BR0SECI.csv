This was the time that Clint Walker wanted out from his Warner contract to get into movies. So its the time that we start seeing the characters to Bronco & Sugarfoot being introduced on the shows.

5668106,5,B00BR0SECI,"Cheyenne has always been one of my favourites and season five is no exception, the quality of picture and sound is quite remarkable given the age of the original films and the process of transferring them on to disc. The sad part for me in Australia is the poor exchange rate slowing me down from more frequent purchases. I am really looking forward to seasons six and seven as I am sure they will be of equal and outstanding quality.",1462233600,,434,4.4375

Clint Walker and James Garner were my favorite actors as I was growing up, and hardly missed any of their shows.

5668146,3,B00BR0SECI,"It is easy to like Clint Walker, but this is not one of the best western series. The stories are not particularly good - though there were a few exceptions. Too many shows concern fighting against idians. Cheyenne is supposed to live among indians (cheyennes, obviously), but in every second show we see him killing them. There are some very noble indians, though, but usually they are renegades from reservations. Reservations were terrible places, so it is just natural that they escaped and fiought. I find myself hoping that indians will win, but always are disappointed. This series is also very studio-bound and it shows. It begins to bother though it was not uncommon in those days. The price is also a bit steep for 15 shows.",1396915200,,733,4.7795275590551185

The cost of Maverick,season 4 is just way too much. Also,please release 77 Sunset Strip,Surfside Six and Bronco.",1391558400,,269,4.625

5668151,5,B00BR0SECI,It is a shame that the Cheyenne series did not go longer than it did.  Clint Walker made the portrayal of Cheyenne very real to his fans.,1379721600,,137,4.074074074074074
5668152,5,B00BR0SECI,"excellent quality...cheyenne was my favorite of the 1950's tv westerns...even though it suffered(as all of those tv westerns),from the out of period guns..as the use of 1892 winchesters..but that was hollywood",1379635200,,209,5.774193548387097
5668153,5,B00BR0SECI,I grew up watching this series and it's still a quality show. I've enjoyed all five seasons so far and it brings back great memories of my childhood.,1378684800,,149,4.357142857142857
5668154,3,B00BR0SECI,"As some others have noted, there must be zero manufacturing quality control on these Warner Archive made-on-demand (MOD) DVD-Rs.  I've ordered five seasons of this show, and several DVDs in each of seasons 2 through 5 were seriously scuffed - a far, far worse track record than any other sets of DVDs that I've ever purchased.  The only seasons *without* scratched DVDs was the first season, but those are proper pressed DVDs that evidently come from a different sort of manufacturing/packaging line than these crappy MOD DVD-Rs that Warner loves so much.  And, since I'm complaining, remember that MOD DVD-Rs will NOT play in anything but a standard DVD player hooked up to a TV.  In every way MOD DVDs are a very bad format which I avoid at all costs... after all, one can make their own MOD DVDs easily from TV broadcasts, and *those* discs will play in ALL of ones' various players.  The Cheyenne TV program itself is a classic, which is the only reason I put up with Warner's crap manufacturing and too-high prices.",1378425600,5,1020,4.707865168539326

5668156,5,B00BR0SECI,In season four and five Cheyenne takes some new directions by adding Bronco Lane and Sugarfoot to the mix. This actually helps bring so variety and new life to the show. Please keep publish all seven seasons of the outstanding and well-liked series. Highly recommended.,1377993600,,269,5.0
5668157,5,B00BR0SECI,Can't get enough of this series.  Loved it as a kid . . .love it as an adult.  Clint Walker was just great as Cheyenne.,1377907200,,119,3.72

5668159,5,B00BR0SECI,"Love the show.  I bought it just to see  Morris Ankrum and Gerald Mohr on the Dawson Creek episode ---  #6 episode I believe it is.

Season 5, Episode 6
Incident at Dawson Flats (9 Jan. 1961) off imdb.

Clint Walker was a very fine actor and soft spoken but a very big man.",1376352000,,273,3.9814814814814814

5668162,4,B00BR0SECI,"I don't know about anyone else and I guess that doesn't matter. All I know is I liked the show then and I like it now. Don't need any techncal review. I just like it. And that's all there is to it. Here we go again with the ""need twenty more words"" thing. I think nine words would do just simply nicely.",1374969600,,303,3.903225806451613
5668163,5,B00BR0SECI,"The Cheyenne series continues to spark my interest because Clint Walker still gives his very best performance as
well balanced person on or off the set. There's no foul language in any of his pictures, so I wouldn't hesitate recommending
them to open-minded teenagers.
There are two things that do bother me about these Cheyenne movies.  One is the lack of color and the other is no caption provisions.
Pass on my comments to the film studio; maybe they'll make some considerations for future Cheyenne releases.",1374883200,,511,4.941860465116279
5668164,5,B00BR0SECI,"There have been many series since, but none with the lonely stranger riding into town and leaving just as soon as the job is done ,, sometimes without thanks. I think Mr. Eastwood understood this when he did  pale rider !",1373846400,,221,4.390243902439025
5668165,5,B00BR0SECI,"My late father was in the US Calvary around 1915. He loved Westerns and this was his favorite TV Western. What sticks in my mind is that he used to tell me that Clint Walker was the quintessential horse rider who had the touch and control of a horse unmatched by any other Western TV star including the likes of John Wayne, Clint Eastwood, Jimmy Stewart, etc.",1373068800,5,359,4.373134328358209
5668166,5,B00BR0SECI,"I grew up with Cheyenne Bodine, along with Josh Randall, Pallidan, Rowdy Yeatts, Wyatt Earp, Vint Bonner and Johnny Yuma.  They all contributed to what I thought a real man was.

I have only one question?  When will we get the final 3 seasons: 6, 7 and 8 of Cheyenne??",1372809600,4,268,4.32
5668167,5,B00BR0SECI,"This has to be one of the best TV combinations for any Western fan. Season 5 does boast some fantastic Cheyenne episodes, but the standout has to be that we get to see Bronco, which makes for some terrific viewing of 2 top Western greats of the old West. Now all we need is for WB to get their act together and release the Bronco series. Just how good will that look in anyone's Western collection",1372464000,3,397,4.2368421052631575

5668170,5,B00BR0SECI,"Cheyenne is a reliable, well-written Western series, without the Western staple of the idiot sidekick that's so annoying.  Granted, Clint Walker is more about presence than speed, but he carries the role well.  You don't find silly plots in Cheyenne.  He encounters problems and solves them, and if violence is part of the solution, so be it.  We've watched all of the seasons before this, so Season Five was eagerly anticipated.  On the technical side, the prints are clear and so is the sound, though Clint Walker always subscribed to the Marlon Brando mumbler school of diction.  That's OK - they're good shows.",1371340800,2,614,4.912621359223301

5668180,5,B00BR0SECI,"I am an original and continuing fan of this series.  The stories in the fifth season are more complex and developed.  Clint Walker, the actor, and Cheyenne, the character, are more mature than the raw-boned, young drifter of  five years before in the first season.
  ""The Long Rope"" finds Cheyenne returning to his home town with flashbacks to his boyhood.  ""THe Road to Three Graves"" has Alan Hale, Jr. in a strong supporting role, and ""Massacre at Gunsight Pass' has Jack Elam as a crazy Russian count.  One of the best episodes, ""The Greater Glory"", has a determined young Morman woman relying on Cheyenne, Billy the Kid, and God, not necessarily in that order.
  Good stories and good characters.",1368576000,15,700,4.815126050420168

8572989,5,B00BR0SECI,"I'm a new fan - I had never seen the show until I was lured in a while back by an inexpensive first-season set sitting on a shelf in a store looking innocuous, just waiting to lure innocent passers-by into a serious, expensive addiction...

As someone noted, the stories in this season are more complex, and the filming seems more movie-like, too.  The shows also seem darker; not that it was ever a comedy, but I missed some of the light touches of the earlier seasons, like the hilarious scene where Cheyenne carries a baby he has rescued into a bar.  This season was pretty grim.  The show always appealed both to children and to adults, I imagine, but it seemed as if this season they decided to focus more on the adults and set the children aside; which, since I really enjoyed the earlier shows a lot, is a shame.  Still excellent, though, hence the five stars.

A few complaints:

I am sure that Sugarfoot and Bronco are wonderful men, of sterling character, and possibly in their own shows just filled with charisma and personality.  However, they need to take their inferior theme songs and get the heck out of the opening and closing credits so I can hear the entire Cheyenne theme.

Through seasons 1-4, I knew that Warner Brother produced these shows because of the bit at the beginning showing the studios with a big WB imposed over it.  Apparently in season 5 WB decided that viewers were too dumb to figure that out, because suddenly we get the pompous voice announcing, twice, that this is a Warner Brothers production, accompanied by a dramatic fanfare.  Also telling us who the stars are.  Just grates on my nerves!

And I don't much like the little introductory preview part.  For some reason that pulls me out of the show instead of pulling me in.

Anybody know of a list where these shows are discussed?  This isn't actually the forum for it, but it would be fun!",1480809600,,1884,4.545994065281899
