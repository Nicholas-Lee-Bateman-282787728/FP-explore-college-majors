8093259,5,B000BVNY4M,"I got this simply for the James Bond bit where he acts out all the characters.
I love this guy!",1391990400,,95,3.8
8093260,5,B000BVNY4M,This is one funny guy! I've had the pleasure of seeing him live on stage and enjoyed very minute of it. He is witty and talented and VERY friendly to everyone after the show. Joby Saad is AMAZING!,1372636800,,196,4.184210526315789
8093261,1,B000BVNY4M,"Things I find funny:

Conan O Brien
Arrested Development
The Hangover
Seinfeld

As for this guy, I wasn't just not amused, I found this guy painfully unfunny and obnoxious. I don't think comedy could get any worse than this.",1252195200,,224,4.717948717948718
8093262,5,B000BVNY4M,i used this with a youth group and some young adults and they can really appreciate the humor of Joby Saad (The Village Idiot) and its Clean!!,1174435200,2,142,4.296296296296297
8093263,5,B000BVNY4M,"This guy is great!  Side-splitting laughs, just hilarious - a performance every member of the family will enjoy and then want to invite all their friends over to laugh some more. Buy some extras for gifts - you can't go wrong!",1169251200,2,226,4.512195121951219
8093264,1,B000BVNY4M,"This guy fails at his attempt to make stupidity funny.  I now what it means for something to be painful to watch.  I didn't laugh once.

If you want real laughs, try these other Banana DVDs:  Jeff Allen, Mike Williams (hilarious), Taylor Mason (talented), Bob Stromberg (no one tells stories like this guy), Daren Streblow (the hot tub story will have you rolling on the floor crying if you are a man; it will have you scratching your head if you're a woman), Bob Nelson (this guy has more faces and voices than Carter has liver pills).

I would also suggest that you get the Ken Davis & Friends DVD and the Ken Davis ""Lighten up and Laugh"" DVD.  All of these are the kind of DVDs you'll watch again and again when you need a lift.

But if you watch this Joby Saad DVD, my condolences.  You were warned!",1161216000,3,803,4.306666666666667
