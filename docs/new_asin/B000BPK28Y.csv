8090587,4,B000BPK28Y,"Pacifica is traveling with her brother, Shannon, and her sister, Raquel. Pacifica has a terrible destiny. She is referred to as the Scrapped Princess. The Scrapped Princess is said to be born under a cursed star and bring destruction to the entire world. Nearly the entire world is out to kill her. There is nowhere they can hide, so they stay on the move. Shannon is a talented swordsman, and Raquel is a strong sorceress. Pacifica has very good protectors. At first glance, Pacifica tends to seem like a spoiled brat. Sometimes she makes a complete turnaround and shows a sweet and caring attitude. It's kind of wierd how she changes like that. The 3 siblings will meet many people on their journey. Some will become friends and others will betray them. One thing is for sure; there will be lots of action and plot twists.

This series is pretty good. It has a good mix of action, comedy and drama. There are some really good characters that are developed well. This series stays focused on the main plot and doesn't diverge like a lot of the fantasy animes out there. It has good animation, voice acting, and a decent soundtrack. I really enjoyed it, but there are tons of better shows out there. I'll give it 4 stars, because even though I enjoyed it, it didn't blow me away.",1356480000,,1279,4.560869565217391
8090588,5,B000BPK28Y,"As this is the last volume I suggest you buy the first volume... But indeed, I believe the company has now released the entire show in one package already and I say you should buy that one. Great story with a touch of...spoiler. spoiler.

Anyway, buy the show and I promise you a great ride from start to end!",1262131200,,309,4.237288135593221
8090589,5,B000BPK28Y,"The siblings are reunited after some help from an unlikley source and retreat to an isolated spot to wait for Pacifica's birthday. But a stranger's visit, and a request from Pacifica's brother changes their plans, and creates one of the most unusual plot twists I have ever seen. The battles are fought. The secrets are revealed; and an ending results that will truly surprise you.
With only the occasional exception of translation problems, I have been nothing but pleased with this series. Pacifica Cassul is a great heroine, and I thoroughly enjoyed watching her. I'm glad that they brought this show to such an interesting conclusion. Is there a chance of a sequel? Maybe...",1164585600,4,678,4.956140350877193
