Carrie is a classic and is also very poignant in this age where bullying has become such a problem w/our youth and I actually had the pleasure of meeting Sissy Spacek in person very shortly after this film was released.  She was an absolutely wonderful human being.  One never knows what hidden talents a person who is being bullied may possess.  Revenge can be sweet even if one has to sacrifice one's own life for it.  Hello Mary Lou; Prom Night ll is one of my all-time favorites.  Having never seen the original Prom Night (and more than likely never will), I came across this 2nd installment quite by accident one night on late night TV and watched it every time it aired.  Now I can watch it whenever I feel the need.  I love the juxtaposition between the 50's and modern day stories which intertwine in it's story-line.  Mary Lou was a bad but beautiful girl who would stop at nothing to be crowned prom queen including murder even decades later.  Swimfan is a ""fatal attraction"" for teens and makes one wonder just how far one will go to satisfy one's own selfish needs at someone else's expense.  How many of these types of lunatics actually exist in our society?  One never actually knows which is the threat of all horror.  These 3 (w/the exception of Carrie) are not the best of classic horror films but most definitely have a ""tongue-in-cheek"" quality about them that makes one go, ""Oh man!!!"" whenever something creepy happens which is what the Scream films also have in common.  Isn't ""I wonder what is going to happen next?"" at the helm of all good horror films??  These 3 films have that in spades and then some.  It's a terrific package; especially for those who aren't particularly huge horror film fans which I am not.  I can watch these 3 movies, one right after the other and still sleep at night.  They also make you smile or even laugh out loud in places which is the best of all worlds.",1322179200,,2036,4.442048517520216
