8335572,4,B001QFFB4I,"I have been watching the whole series and enjoyed it very much. i wish you had the final production called ""THE END OF THE LAW"". A two hour long episode.",1365206400,,153,4.133333333333334
8335573,5,B001QFFB4I,"I rate this entire series up there with Morse. Constant top class storylines, scripts and acting.  I have never seen any show that comes close.",1307923200,,143,4.72

8335575,5,B001QFFB4I,"Kavanaugh QC is a wonderful addition to our library of British Mystery series. Better than Morse, John Thaw has found the perfect role for his skills as a superb actor. The supporting cast from top to bottom is extraordinary - similar to casting in the Frost and Foyle's War series. The length gives us our money's worth and we can't wait to watch the next one! Highly recommended!

8335576,5,B001QFFB4I,"If you enjoyed the first parts of the Kavanagh QC series then this is a must.  Thaw's character has a little wider range now that he is a widower, but it is the same quality of acting and overall performance that you have come to expect from this wonderful gentleman.  Watched in order you get a complete picture and an ending that only makes you want to to see more--but alas, there isn't more.  This is truly for the John Thaw fan or fan of British mystery/law shows.  It is class at it's best.",1244764800,7,496,4.24468085106383
