4693536,5,B005GRF2QY,"I know some people on here said that the videos were of poor quality. But I didn't have a single problem with them. The packaging was great, and season 10 of Degrassi is overwhelmingly amazing. I've watched every season of Degrassi-TNG and up so I understand when people say that the writers are re-using events, but everything is done in a fresh way with equally unique characters. I would recommend this to anybody who wants all the drama they missed out in high school.",1323475200,4,472,4.630952380952381
4693537,4,B005GRF2QY,"I recently got into Degrassi TNG June of 2011 when I caught an episode of Season 11. This got me curious to explore more of episodes of Degrassi. This was the first season I bought, since with season 11 being on a short break they were showing season 10. I thought this was a great season with amazing drama, well that is until I started watching the earlier seasons.

Seasons 2-6 was on a blowout sale for 14.99 each and I grabbed them the first chance I got thinking I will not see them being sold for a while. This got me started on a two month long Degrassi marathon (I went through the seasons really quickly since they were very interesting). When watching the first few seasons I got a sense of realism and it didn't feel like a soap opera. I realized that a lot of ideas were recycled in the 10th and 11th season. The original characters: Emma, Liberty, JT, Toby, Craig, Jimmy, Eleanor, Paige and the rest were very solid characters. While the new cast felt like they were a knock of version of the original cast.

I would say the 9th season is when everything spiraled down because we lost the original members and were only left with Simpson. The new kids really didn't have an identity of their own; they felt like copies of the original.

- Sav = Craig: They both are crazy about music and are involved in a band (difference is Craig knows what he is doing and can sing) and they both at one point or another against their parent's wishes stole a vehicle for a concert.

- Holly J = Paige: the rude stuck up  blonde who gradually shows compassion and caring towards others

- Bianca = Alex: Tough Girl who causes problems who later gets reformed and steps onto the good side

- Claire = Emma: The activist that stands up for what's right, the down to earth type girl.

- Riley=Marco: pretends to date girls to hide his sexuality from the world, confused if he is gay or not. The plot basically is the same.

I'm sure there is more, but at the moment I can only think of these few.
The stories are reused at the best maybe changed a slight bit. It felt as if they gave up on originality and depended mainly on stories from previous seasons.

To sum all of this up: If you haven't seen Degrassi TNG 1-9 and season 10 is your first season, then you wouldn't notice any difference since the story will seem new and fresh to you. However if you are a fan who has been following from the previous seasons, this season will feel like a dramatic soap opera with 90% of the story lines taken from its previous seasons. However this time new kids are present who come off as if they are trying to fill the shoes of the originals.",1320364800,5,2631,4.296969696969697

8472226,5,B005GRF2QY,"The different volumes discs were pressed differently. One volume has screen printed discs, and the other set is Double Sided DVDs.

I stopped watching Teen Nick after ssn ten vol one. So i got this so I can rewatch the first half before moving on. I think this is were degrassi started doing half seasons with titles, which makes me feel like its okay to collect the later seasons, without starting with early seasons.",1392076800,,418,4.648648648648648
