8702433,5,B00TP1QO5U,"I really enjoyed the slow, thoughtful and quiet pace to this. I enjoyed seeing Adrian on his journey, and as it continues and will into the future. I am of Native Hawai'ian heritage and much of the wisdom and advice from the Native American healers deeply resonated with me. The Western doctor also had much to add of value. I really appreciated this film!",1534118400,,356,4.578125
8702434,5,B00TP1QO5U,"I gleaned ALOT  from the Spiritual Leaders in this film. This movie is much bigger than autism. The outsiders comparison of autistics and Native Americans was interesting.  The film soared way above ""autism as a disability"".  The filming and speakers were excellent. ( Intentional or not, I THOROUGHLY DISLIKED THE ENDING reducing back down to an institutional setting for handicapped people !  Yuck. Was nothing learned ?  ( Or your too comfortable or habitualized  in your handicapped lifestyle and day center.)",1518998400,,513,5.271604938271605

8702436,5,B00TP1QO5U,"A really inspiring delve into Native American views of autism and special needs in general, with healing words of wisdom and encouraging words of practical advice. I love this documentary, and am so relieved to hear people speaking about autism in  a truly understanding and truly accepting way.",1488499200,,295,5.145833333333333
8702437,5,B00TP1QO5U,This film is a must see for anyone who has interacted with autistic individuals and for anyone who is exploring Native American Spirituality.  Adrians films resonate deep within the heart!  The lineup of indigenous Traditional Elders is quite amazing!  Adrians quest to learn about his culture and to heal his inner wounds is a journey we all must undertake.  Im so glad to have watched this movie and to share it with my parents.,1454284800,2,430,4.77027027027027
8702438,3,B00TP1QO5U,"The lessons, in this, film are basic but, good ones. I knew it all. And those who read my blogs enough should know them all already. The main character is a young adult with Autism who speaks and travels around to different Indians too learn how to handle his outbursts, anger, and mindset .",1453507200,,291,4.407407407407407
8702439,5,B00TP1QO5U,I loved it.  I was diagnosed as an adult and see autism as a great gift.  This is not so true for younger people; they see autism as a disability. Some of the most interesting people I've met are autistic. I found the documentary to be fascinating and helpful as an honest glimpse into autism intermingled with the peacefulness of native culture.,1445731200,2,346,4.564516129032258
8702440,5,B00TP1QO5U,"What Adrian Esposito has created in this film, in my eyes, is the close relationship between Native American Culture and the the culture of people living with Disabilities.  What I saw was the commonality of Native Americans and people living with differences and the treatment they have received by others by means of genocide and ridicule.  Adrian begins this film with his thoughts of his schooling being separated from the mainstream and I recognize his thoughts as my own son's thoughts regarding societies generalization that our kids can't.  The oppression is real and our kids act out accordingly with these preconceived ideas that our children are not good enough.

The importance of Adrian's work is that our ""brothers and sisters with disabilities"" are OK just the way that they are.  I see my own son with his anger on the mistreatment of himself and others that he has witnessed and as taught in this film I see Sam with a higher level of conscientiousness that he was born with.  I know that with acceptance of people with disabilities and to understand their gifts that were given to them there would be less suppression and therefore less anger.

It is my hope that this film be incorporated in the teaching of adults who would like to work with people with differences.  Maybe adults can learn to work with the ""good human element"" that our kids, who grow into adults, are born with.  Adrian is going to amaze the world with his insights and his ability to tell his stories.  The journey has just begun and I am looking forward to seeing more.  Adrian has found his purpose and Adrian is perfect just the way he is.

This film warmed my heart.  I had the opportunity to get a glimpse of how I can help myself and my son gain serenity and peace.  Thank you Adrian.",1429920000,2,1780,4.627388535031847
