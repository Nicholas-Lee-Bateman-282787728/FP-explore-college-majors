8515402,2,B007EQQSOA,"Two INFORMATIVE Stars. This short video, ""Lady Gaga-Dancing In The Dark: Unauthorized Documentary"" is more of a string of short clips of the expected highly-favorable commentary from 4 fans, interspersed with still photos and dance studio & on-stage videos and award film clips. Not really a documentary, I don't believe she even speaks beyond singing. It gives mostly Wikipedia-level background information: birth day and location, parents, early skills and schooling, including early black and white photo, origin of her stage name, the Julliard and Tisch factors, the family ultimatum, Lady Starlight, Akon, ""Red and Blue, Stefani"", songwriting, the fan effect, and social media. I learned a few things that were new to me and there is lots of happy fan talk about this talented, award-winning, and hardworking artist. Written by Laura Troth. Recommended as a brief overview for new fans and the curious. Two ENLIGHTENING Stars. (Beleave Films. Samatha Fields Productions. Unrated, but contains the usual Lady Gaga risqu&eacute; dance video clips. Color. CC. Time-34:50.)",1464134400,,1074,5.515151515151516
8515403,1,B007EQQSOA,"""Hey, I have an idea, I'm going to get four of my friends who have nothing to do with Lady Gaga together and go to a park in New Jersey and interview them about what they think of Lady Gaga, add a few voiceovers with info everyone already has heard a million times about Lady Gaga spoken over clips of her videos and a few TV appearances, and then charge people $14.95 for it!!""

I was going to give this DVD two stars just to be nice, since the people who made it did take the time to take a video camera to the park in New Jersey and spent about five minutes copying down Lady Gaga's wikipedia page for the voiceovers, but the people that are interviewed for this ""documentary"" are so annoying and so inane, and they put ""the UNTOLD STORY"" on the DVD case, that they only deserve one star. This DVD isn't even good enough to be put on youtube, it's that bad. Oh, and it's only 30 minutes, not 70 minutes like the amazon details state. That's 30 minutes of my life I'll never get back...

Did you know Lady Gaga has gay fans? Did you know Lady Gaga has sold a lot of albums and has had a string of hit singles? Did you know Lady Gaga wears some crazy outfits? These are the main revelations in this ""untold story"" of Lady Gaga's rise to fame. If you didn't know any of these things then you're probably not looking up Lady Gaga DVD's on amazon in the first place, or you're over 80 years old and don't know how to use the internet.

The four people interviewed are the biggest sham. They don't know Gaga, don't work in the industry, and don't have any insider information about Gaga. They're just four regular people rambling out boring opinions about Gaga.

  - There's the giggly young woman who likes to play with her big feather earring. She makes the shocking revelation that Gaga has a lot of gay fans, and that she has friends in the LGBT ""organization"".

  - There's the ""arty chick"" with long hair and a sort of short-sleeved peasant top talking about Gaga's artistry and thinks Gaga will be president in five years.

  - There's the guy on a leather couch meant to look like someone in the music industry (he's not). He didn't see Gaga in NYC when she was performing before she broke big, but he DID see a video clip of Gaga when she was performing before she broke big!! He also says Gaga is four or five albums into her career. Um, not counting anything released before The Fame, she has only released 2 1/2 albums (The Fame, Fame Monster (which is technically an EP and Gaga herself said not intended to be a full album), and Born This Way). It makes you wonder if the people being interviewed even know who Lady Gaga is...

  - Finally there's the most inane of the four, the gay guy commenting mostly on Gaga's style. He talks about how he never sees anyone wearing designer clothes that you see in a fashion show (and implies that no one buys them, which would mean that there would be no fashion designers putting on runway shows if their clothes weren't selling season after season...), but he always sees people dressing like Lady Gaga, including himself. He's supposed to seem like he's some Williamsburg gay hipster, but if he never sees people wearing designer clothes then he must live in Kansas or something (no offense to the stylish people living in Kansas). Then he contradicts himself by talking about a Versace dress Gaga wore [for those unable to see the hypocrisy -- he says no one, including Gaga, wears designer clothes from runway shows but people dress like Gaga, and then talks about Gaga wearing, um, a dress from a designer that was in a runway show] Where does he think Gaga gets a lot of her clothes (that the Haus of Gaga doesn't make for her)?? He also talks about Gaga wearing the coat made out of Kermit the Frogs because she wanted to wear Kermit the Frog and not something from a runway show; but that Kermit the Frog coat was by Jean-Charles de Castelbajac, and it was shown in a runway show before Gaga wore it. I don't mean to belabor this point, but this is all that's in the DVD: a bunch of regular people just rambling on about what they think, most of which is uninformed or doesn't make any sense.

There's no ""untold story"", there's no new information about Gaga, there aren't even any intelligent or interesting opinions on Gaga from the people interviewed. This DVD went out of print very quickly after it was released, probably so the people who made it could avoid being taken on Judge Judy by people who bought it.",1344816000,3,4475,4.399515738498789
