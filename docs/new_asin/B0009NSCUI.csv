2306324,5,B0009NSCUI,"But I am not sure if its the entire seires, as I watched it avidly.  only 8 episodes?  Still Henry is glib and fast talking.",1397520000,,124,3.92
2306325,5,B0009NSCUI,One of the funniest BBC series you will come across.  I have watched this series over and over again.  We watched this series with many others from the BBC broadcast.,1396224000,,166,4.5
2306326,3,B0009NSCUI,"Nothing beats the first series of CHEF.  There is one episode in this disc worth more than a few chuckles, but still not worth the viewing of the whole Series Two.  The change and/or add-on of characters changed the chemistry greatly, and reduced the laughs as well.",1393891200,,266,4.638297872340425
2306327,4,B0009NSCUI,Although I found it hard to watch the second series at times overall I enjoyed the series.  Because of some of the changes that were made with characters and themes my interest began to get a little lost by the close of this season.,1388275200,,232,4.2727272727272725
2306328,5,B0009NSCUI,I am a chef and I found this series hilarious! Very enjoyable! Too bad the series was discontinued in the U.K.....,1368230400,,114,4.476190476190476
2306329,5,B0009NSCUI,"I cannot say enough good stuff about Chef, series two.  I love every minute of the tape.  Chef is the British version of America's Hell's Kitchen in a way.  I love the dry humor.  The quality of the tape is excellent and it arrived in perfect condition in the time promised.  I cannot wait to have more tapes of Chef.  If you joy British humor you will love Chef!",1296691200,,363,4.188405797101449
2306330,4,B0009NSCUI,"meh, if you like BBC comedies, you'll have to give this one a go.  It's good!",1272412800,,77,3.8125
2306331,4,B0009NSCUI,"Being a long time fan of the chef series, I finally got series One and Two on DVD, a nice upgrade from the old taped VHS version.
Both series are great, sound and picture wise a little lacking, but who cares when it is the dialog, the insults and totally blown out of proportion tantrums, you want to watch. I am exstatic that i have them in my collection now, for years of enjoyment, as you can easily watch many of the episodes over and over. If you are a fan like me get ,1 and 2, don't bother about series 3.

8063948,5,B0009NSCUI,"Watched this years ago, and then it disappeared! Lenny Henry is super hilarious, playing the ""finest"" chef in England, possibly the world! It's British humor at it's best. I wish he would've continued this series until...forever!!!! But since that's not possible, I'll take what I can get.",1403136000,,289,5.170212765957447
