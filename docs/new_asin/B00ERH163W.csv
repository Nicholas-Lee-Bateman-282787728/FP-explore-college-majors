5935055,5,B00ERH163W,Love this movie! I'm a Norma Shearer fan and as always she did a wonderful job in this film.,1407196800,2,92,3.8947368421052633
5935066,5,B00ERH163W,A masterpiece of film-making from the glory days of Hollywood before World War II. On a par with Gone With The Wind in its production values.,1461715200,3,141,4.461538461538462
5935067,5,B00ERH163W,Great film! No one can touch Norma Shearer for the luminous perfection of her Marie Antoinette. Robert Morley's debut as Louis XVI is brilliant. If only Sophia Coppola had had someone like him for her film. It is just as much a movie about the late 30's style as Coppola's was about the early 21st century's. But the aching romance and stunning beauty of Shearer puts this in an altogether different category. The scenes between her and the very handsome Tyrone Power define love on film. It is a very touching movie about people caught in the bear trap of monumental historical change. Prenez garde!,1460851200,3,600,4.723809523809524
5935068,4,B00ERH163W,"Wonderful. gorgeous, touching! Norma Shearer is exquisitely beautiful in this thing...and Tyrone Power ain't bad either!",1454198400,4,120,6.5625
5935069,4,B00ERH163W,"If this movie had been filmed in technicolor, it would've been categorized as one of the greatest films of Hollywood's Golden Age (right up there with Gone With the Wind) and I would've rated it five stars instead of four. But despite this, Marie Antionette holds up very well with it's beautiful sets, lavish costumes, and Norma Shearer's Phenominal and heartbreaking portrayl of the tragic Austrian born princess turned queen of France turned scapegoat turned political prisoner of the bloody French Revolution. As much as I love Bette Davis, the Academy Award for best Actress in 1939 should've gone to Norma.",1449792000,5,612,5.069306930693069
5935070,5,B00ERH163W,"Norma Shearer was wonderful though a bit old to be playing Marie Antoinette. I have read books about her life and the French revolution, and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised how accurate this late 1930's movie was. The sets were extraordinary and reminded me of Versailles which  I did visit years ago. Robert Morley in his debut was fantastic as Louis XVI. The one disappointment was Tyrone Power who looked handsome but needed some acting lessons.
When they are imprisoned you feel the tension ratchet up and it keeps you in its grips until the bitter ending. Well done and highly recommended to all.",1436918400,3,610,4.700934579439252
5935071,5,B00ERH163W,"Oh .... I lost my head over it!. Seen many versions of the story, but this is the one and only! Just the best! Norma Shearer is the best one to play the queen ....The time period was presented just as it looked and is preserved today.",1431216000,6,234,4.0

8608786,5,B00ERH163W,"A triumphant tour de force for Norma Shearer, Gladys George and Robert Morley!  This is so far superior to the recent film about Marie Antoinette that I cannot stress this enough.  Norma is magnificent, acting in the grand manner throughout.  It's difficult to imagine anyone else in the role.  The absence of Tyrone Power's name above, shows that being pretty is not enough.  There were moments where he was on screen but otherwise absent without leave.",1473724800,3,454,4.921052631578948

8608788,5,B00ERH163W,"This DVD Classic from Warner Brothers is second to none about the Marie Antoinette Tragedy.  Although 18th Century France as an ally enabled the American Colonies to prevail as a nation and win the American Revolution, the cost ruined the finances of France in tandem with drought plus the aristocracy.  The French Aristocracy was so privileged, the people rose up, revolted and formed a Republic.  Marie Antoinette was a young teenager, but Norma Shearer portrayed her with real style.  Although there is considerable Hollywood panache and romantics, nevertheless this classic movie re-enacted how it really happened:  Robert Morely portrayed timid Louis XVI from the ballroom via the boudoir to the guillotine.  the Prince and the Princess were taken away from Marie Antoinette before she went to the guillotine.  Although Tyrone Power appears subdued, his acting gave the perception of pending doom that was not able to be reversed.  Overall, this is a Hollywood gargantuan production and a classic worthy of 5 star rating!",1464998400,9,1026,5.251533742331288
