5657179,5,B00BN3ED3I,"The DVD's did not play on an Australian DVDrecorder, I had to purchase a cheap recorder and convert it to All areas.  This did not bother me at all but I had requested on several occasions whether it would play on an Australian DVD so may I suggest to you that when people purchase DVD's from you that you emphase that you must all an ALL REGION DVD player to play the DVD.  No hassle - everything fine.
