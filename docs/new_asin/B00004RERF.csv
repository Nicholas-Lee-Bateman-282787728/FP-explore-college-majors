7920793,4,B00004RERF,"Good movie, remember seeing this when it was first released in ' 65, and when I saw it again, it was even better than I remember. Strong performanceS by Michael Parks, Kim Darby and Ann-Margret. Recommend it. Maybe they'll release it on DVD",1361059200,3,240,4.604651162790698
7920794,4,B00004RERF,"I received this product in a timely manner. The movie was well packaged. The movie has some ruff spots, but is overall in excellent condition. I got just what I wanted. I am pleased.",1310083200,,182,4.382352941176471
7920795,5,B00004RERF,"Michael Parks is wonderful in this.  Ann-Margret is great as the spoiled, materialistic rich girl.  Marlon Brando's sister plays the mom.  Kim Darby of ""True Grit"" fame is the little sister. There is a bit of everything in this story.  Alcoholic parents, infidelity, coming of age.  It's all beautifully woven together in this somewhat forgotten film that shouldn't be missed.  The late David Carradine and Larry Storch also make appearances here.",1299456000,2,447,5.225352112676056
7920796,5,B00004RERF,"3 Cheers for Amazon.com and the seller of my ""hard to find"" video selection.  There is nothing better than reliving the past with a favorite old movie and if it's in superb condition, excellent video quality and has AnnMargret & Michael Parks that's a weekend movie to stay home for!!!! I HIGHLY recommend Amazon & this seller.  Great product, price and movie.",1255564800,,360,4.790322580645161
7920797,4,B00004RERF,"While set in a specific time & place, Bus Riley's dilemma is a timeless one: how does a young, yearning, intelligent person break free of a restrictive society & its many alluring entrapments, and become an individual, following an individual path? Michael Parks delivers a rich, nuanced performance, ably supported by a fine cast. Ann-Margret is a delight as the luscious ex-girlfriend who draws Bus back into her very pleasurable web for awhile -- the film is smart enough not to make her a villain, but simply someone who has it all (or so it seems) but knows that she's still missing something from life. And both Janet Margolin & Kim Darby show why they should have had bigger careers than they did: both are fresh, believable, empathetic. Not everything is neatly tied up by the end, but new possibilities appear, and we realize that Bus may well be on his way to that individual path. Recommended!",1113955200,10,904,4.764331210191083
7920798,4,B00004RERF,"You've got to love a movie whose main character's first name is ""Bus"" - whether that's his given name or a nickname is never explained. This film should have made Michael Parks a superstar, as he turns in a stellar performance. Bus returns home by bus (what symbolism!) after 3 years in the navy. He literally runs into his former girlfriend, who has married a rich old man in his absence. You know he can't resist her charms for long. Who could resist the gorgeous Ann-Margret at her seductive best? However, by the end of the film he breaks off his affair with her, realizing that their relationship is going nowhere.
In addition to his romantic troubles, Bus searches for a fulfilling career throughout the film, not wanting to go back to his old job as a mechanic. In fact, he bristles at the suggestion to do so by the local bartender, played by the talented Larry Storch. ""I'm sorry, Bus. I'll go down to the bank and suggest that they make you president."" Bus replies, ""Do me a favor...drop dead!"" Throughout a series of failed jobs, the local garage owner keeps urging Bus to go back to work for him as a mechanic. You know he can't resist his persuasiveness for long. Who could keep saying no to the great James Doohan? I think the character he plays in this movie formed the basis for his character Scotty on Star Trek. Then again, that may be too much of a stretch!
This is a movie that proves you can go home again. It also begs for a sequel. I'm anxiously awaiting the release of ""Bus Riley's Still In Town!""",1002931200,10,1521,4.435714285714286
7920799,3,B00004RERF,an almost james dean type film but the real scene stealer is janet margolin(david and Lisa). Her character is so real to life that she touches your heart and you mentally urge bus riley to fall in love with her. A much  sought after video of fans of fims of real life emotions.,959817600,3,277,4.226415094339623
7920800,4,B00004RERF,"Anne Margret in a pool with her clothes on; what more can I say! Like many Anne Margret fans this film has long been a holy grail for me. It revolves around a former Navy man (Parks) who returns to his small town many years  after he left. There he meets his former High School flame (Margret) the  local sex kitten who in the interim has married the local Millionaire. She  works her whiles on him culminating in the afore mentioned fully clothed  dip in the pool to seduce him. While not a timeless classic along the lines  of say PICNIC, or RAINTREE COUNTY, the film is still mildly entertaining,  and has long been high on the wish lists of fans to be released on video.",955324800,16,674,4.309523809523809
