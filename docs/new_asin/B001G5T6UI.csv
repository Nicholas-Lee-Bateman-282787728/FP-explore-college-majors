3596005,5,B001G5T6UI,"Often Emma gets a bad rap because she didn't go West after Joseph was murdered. This movie does a fabulous job of showing her as the historical records do. As an elect lady of God. A woman acquainted with much sorrow, but with a love for her husband and for his work that was unmatched.",1477526400,,286,4.218181818181818

3596009,1,B001G5T6UI,"Got 5 minutes into a piece of emotionally manipulative garbage, and turned it off.  This is a promotional product for the mormons.  Mormons will love this movie, but it is not historically accurate.  It portrays people as good or bad, evil or heroic.  And the lighting, music, costuming and makeup all clearly define who the good guys are (the mormons) and who the bad guys are (everyone who isn't mormon).  When everyone else is against you, it is really important to question whether they are all just being mean and picking on you, or if you are possibly in the wrong.  According to this movie, bad things happen to good people because God is testing them or because bad people are under the power of the devil.  But that isn't how people are.  People are good and bad, a mix of virtue and vice.  The troubles that the mormons faced were a result of their own bad behavior, but this movie, and the other promotional movies the mormon church has put out, ignore things like the Kirtland Anti-Banking Society, Gallitin, Missouri, Sidney Rigdon's extermination order on all non-mormons which instigated the infamous extermination order given by Governor Lilburn Boggs.
The lighting, color saturations, and ambience of this production reflect the genre of fantasy fiction instead of historical non-fiction.  If you're a mormon looking to stroke your ego on your church's history, then knock yourself out, but anyone else looking to understand the history of the mormon church and what the LDS church thought of Emma Smith should be referred to the writings of Brigham Young.  I would also encourage you to look up the debate between Emma's son and his cousin Joseph F. Smith (future president of the LDS church).  This may be the LDS church's attempt at restoring some honor to their founder's first wife, but let's not forget that the ones who slandered her honor and tarnished her reputation in the first place are the very ancestors the LDS church reveres who crossed the plains.  Emma Smith did not cross the plains, and she did not remain with Brigham's branch of the church.  She didn't believe Brigham Young was to be Joseph Smith's successor.
In conclusion I suggest anyone ask themselves: if this is really the truth, why embellish it with so much emotional stimulation?  Shouldn't the truth stand on it's own without telling us how we should feel about it?  I felt like in this movie I was told sincerely that this is what I should believe the truth to be, and that I should feel good about it and warm and fuzzy.  That's not truth, that's manipulation.",1471564800,3,2562,4.773242630385488

3596033,5,B001G5T6UI,Best story I've seen about Joseph and Emma. You really get a sense of the great character of this fine woman. My heart goes out to her for all she suffered. She may have had some issues with polygamy at the end but she was truly an elect lady. I pray that she and Joseph are united now for eternity. Film is very well done but covers only the first years together. Well acted and directed. Good quality for a small budget film. I don't know what they would add anyway.,1450915200,,468,4.153846153846154

3596053,5,B001G5T6UI,"Beautiful sketch of the life of Emma Smith and her husband, the prophet Joseph Smith, and the events of the Restoration of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints as seen through her eyes. The trials she and her family were asked to pass through are astounding, but even more astonishing is the faith-filled way they handled those trials. The overriding theme of the movie is the strength isn't something you have, it's something you find with the Lord's help, and that ordinary people can do extraordinary things with His watchful care. Love the way Kathryn Nelson, Nathan Mitchell, and so many other wonderful actors portray these real people and make this part of our history come alive.",1436832000,,698,4.873949579831932

3596075,5,B001G5T6UI,This is a beautiful wonderful filn for anyone interested in the life of an amazing woman. I was agnostic for most of my adult life even though I felt god. I decided to become a born again protestant. I studied the church three years ago and went to services with the elders i kid u not I felt like i was home.  I felt so welcomed and loved. Something I never felt before. Im 31 now swallowed my pride and finally accepted Christ into my heart. Right after I felt the holy spirit leading me back to the church. I attended a non denomination church and I didn't get that feeling of pure love as I did in the lds church. I respect everyones opinion and beliefs but in no way is this church a cult or preach we can become gods on other planets.  Scientology the peoples temple etc...are and were cults. This church saved my life and the love I get from the ward and just fellow lds is so beautiful almost magical and I only feel it with the church. The church made me a better person and a reason to get up in the morning with my heart knowing im part of a worldly family. I love this church more then anything and I advise one does there own research go to service.  Talk to the elders. Read the bom and I promise christ will lead you in the  right direction.,1435104000,,1256,4.114285714285714

Such an inspirational and amazing movie that is a true story and if you are a person of faith and are interested in the church this movie will blow you away and touch your soul.  The actors did an amazing job at the portrayal of the prophet Joseph and his amazing wife Emma.

3596114,3,B001G5T6UI,"Not a great film, but just to straighten out the anti-Mormons (from Wikipedia):

""Joseph Smith publicly condemned polygamy, but there is ample evidence that Smith both taught and practiced it, had a number of wives sealed to him, and may have had sexual relations with at least some of them.  Though there were allegations of paternity in some of these polygamous marriages, no children have ever been proven to be Smith's. There is ongoing genetic research to determine if any descendants of alleged children have Smith's genetic markers, and so far all tests have been negative.""

In other words, Joseph smith got Emma Smith pregnant 11 times, but there is zero evidence of any other pregnancies - and this at a time when birth control was unavailable.  Hardly what I would call a man keeping a harem.  If he was a lech with 30 lovers, where are all the children?",1408838400,,865,4.74

But my favorite thing about this is that it's from Emma's side of the story and it's not sugar coated. You find that she, and Joseph, were just human like everyone else. They had their weaknesses and mistakes, but they also tried their hardest to keep going, be positive, and help each other & others despite the many disappointments and hardships they experienced.",1366934400,,450,4.857142857142857

3596158,5,B001G5T6UI,I love Emma & hurt for all the hardships in her life..I laughed & cried watching it..She stood fast backing Joseph a TRUE PROPHET OF GOD...I recommend this movie to everyone..,1363478400,,175,4.67741935483871

3596184,1,B001G5T6UI,"I expected this film to be a sugar-coated distortion of indisputable historical events, but I could not imagine that the LDS Church could sink this low and dishonor Emma's memory so much.
The movie, which is about a dialogue between old Emma Smith Bidamon and her daughter Julia, was supposed to show Emma's real life, but on the contrary, it purposedly omits the most interesting and crucial events.
History informs us that Emma, along with her son, Joseph Smith III, apostatized from the LDS Church and joined the rival RLDS Church.
She burnt the revelation concerning plural marriage and her relationship with Joseph was not only about dancing and kissing, as the movie wrongly shows; according to Emma's children, friends and ""sister wives"", the couple had many fights over polygamy.
Emma had also verbal confrontation with the ""sister wives"" she was aware of. After Joseph's marriage to the Lawrence and Partridge sisters (four orphans who lived with the couple), she became very bitter with them so they were forced to leave and find another home.
I see the movie not only as an insult to Emma's memory, but to section 132 of Doctrine and Covenants too.
Sealing for eternity is depicted as something wonderful and joyful, while plural marriage, which is part of the same revelation, is portrayed as a sacrifice that broke the couple's hearts.
According to Mormon prophets and the revelation itself, plural marriage brings many blessings to people who practice it: it is not a sacrifice, but rather a reward in heaven.",1337990400,24,1523,4.976470588235294
3596185,4,B001G5T6UI,I liked this movie because it helped me understand better what Emma went through... we mainly focus on Joseph... she was the rock behind him... and anyone who criticizes her should walk a mile in her shoes and lets see how you do.

3596188,5,B001G5T6UI,"I converted to the LDS church recently & I absolutely love it. This film is awesome & so realistic. It brought Emma Hale Smith to life for me. People love to bring up negative things about Mormons but all I can say is I have never been closer to the Lord. God called me to the church. * AND, NO - they do not practice polygamy!!! Geez. It was outlawed by the church itself 120 years ago at the same time other folks had to stop practicing plural marriage. It was not just a mormon lifestyle. Anyway, if people will ever stop talking about that boring old subject, quit exaggerating the truth, & end their pleasure of making up negative lies about the church - others would have the opportunity to see the real truth of the LDS church. It is indeed beautiful!",1310774400,13,758,4.3076923076923075
3596199,1,B001G5T6UI,"Polygamy is only mentioned one time in the entire film (97 minutes).  Emma is never shown interacting with ANY of Joseph's other 30 plus wives.  Joseph is never shown interacting with ANY of his additional 30 plus wives.  This is obviously preposterous.  In the film Emma states that polygamy broke her heart and Josephs.  Yeah, I'm sure Joseph's heart was broken after having sex with his 30 plus wives, some as young as 14 years old.

This film is for brainwashed Mormon's only and is of very little interest to anybody else.  There are 100s of boring little quips of wisdom that totally disrupt the flow of the movie (if you can call it that).  You could just pull up 1,000 Mormon quotations on Google and read them one after another and get the same result.  This makes the movie almost impossible to watch.  I guess that is good in a way as nobody outside the church will want to view it -- Mormon's still have no idea how to make a good film.

At the end of the film they don't portray Emma (along with children) leaving the Mormon church and marrying another man - Lewis C. Bidamon.  Nor do they mention Joseph III, Joseph's son, starting a rival organization called the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints and becoming its President.  Emma would later become a member of this rival church and support her son in doing so.

There is definitely the material here to make for an interesting film if anyone desired to do so but this is definitely not it.",1308096000,22,1478,4.48689138576779

3596202,5,B001G5T6UI,"The story is well written and this is one of the best-produced L.D.S. history-based movies in every aspect that has been produced by anyone! The blu-ray is the best photography I've seen on any movie yet and I'm an aspiring photographer! Over and over throughout the movie I just kept saying ""this is the kind of quality I've been hoping someone would produce and finally has; superb cinematography, color, sharpness, screenplay, storyline, and the acting is pretty darn good too."" Few movies produced today (including l.d.s. movies) have a truly positive, life-changing affect on their viewers--but this one brought me closer to Joseph and Emma, and helped me understand and appreciate them in very motivating ways; I want to be worthy to associate with good people like them in the eternities so I had better take more care and work harder to stay on track in this life--if you know what I mean! My faith and hope were strengthened through this movie! Emma was a spiritual giant just like Joseph and this movie helps you to understand that. I would like to show this to every young woman in the church because I think Emma, in this movie, is such a positive role model for women and young women. So glad I bought the blu-ray version because on my blu-ray player and HD TV this film is what I would call ""full of eye candy"" it is so gorgeous and well-produced and filmed. After just the first viewing, it's one of my favorite movies! This kind of uplifting and inspiring entertainment is what people need to be watching and being inspired by today! I went out and bought ""Praise To the Man"" also, and I now want to get the other movies produced by T.C. Christensen as well!

3596203,4,B001G5T6UI,This was pretty good.  I would like to see a little more about her life after Joseph's death.  It is unfathomable what that woman had to bear for love of her husband and her God.  She never had a life of her own.  Her home and her husband were always being invaded because of Joseph and her belief in him.  I ache for what she had to bear even 150 years later.  I wonder would I have her courage and fortitude.  Thank God I have not had to find out in the way that she did.,1268697600,5,473,3.8645833333333335
3596204,4,B001G5T6UI,"My wife and I both enjoyed this film and have added this to our collection for our family. The story was well done and places everything into perspective and adds another angle to the history of The LDS Church. The title can lead you to believe that the entire film is about Emma Smiths life, but in reality it shows the trials of Joseph Smith and the early years of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints and the effect these events had on Emma.

I purchased this on Blu-ray and was expecting a bit more out of the picture quality for a high def title. The picture is soft but contains wonderful colors with the occasional blemish on the film throughout. I agree with the other review that the audio levels were pretty low which shows a lack of experience from the production company. That being said, all of this can be forgiven by people looking for wholesome and uplifting entertainment. In ""Mormon Cinema"" this is a realistic and rewarding story that you'll enjoy.",1239062400,10,978,4.556818181818182
