3921797,1,B002FG9ND2,"There is nothing ""gymnastic"" about this DVD.  It is plain-old water fitness using a few different pieces of equipment (a disc, a bar, and a noodle).  I am a certified aqua aerobics instructor and there are many moves featured on the DVD that I would never do in my class due to potential injury, especially to the shoulder.",1275868800,25,323,4.551724137931035

8368968,1,B002FG9ND2,"Not what I expected, this video shows different water exercises, but not continually so you have to see how it is down each time boring.  More instruction that doing.  Will be shopping Round again ",1446595200,,197,4.735294117647059

8368972,1,B002FG9ND2,This exercise video is a terrible disappointment. The background music sounds like something out of the 70s. It primarily focuses on arm exercises. This is a very disappointing purchase.,1391212800,3,186,5.448275862068965
8368973,1,B002FG9ND2,I am an aqua aerobics teacher.  Most people who take water aerobics are over 50.  They can not do the moves that this instructor does on this DVD.  I felt I wasted my money.,1379635200,,173,4.029411764705882
8368974,3,B002FG9ND2,"I purchased the Power Aerobics DVD to help get some ideas for teaching my water aerobics classes. The exercises are safe and effective and can be taken up or down in intensity if you'd like. The DVD is very repetitive in that you see lots of the same move before moving on, but it's a good workout and I would recommend this DVD. With this price you can't really go wrong!",1310083200,4,372,4.253521126760563
8368975,1,B002FG9ND2,Don't buy a DVD by it's cover.  Waste of money - wish I could return. Do not have one good thing to say about it.,1279929600,12,113,3.52
8368976,1,B002FG9ND2,"I expected a high energy DVD/CD that could be used to first to watch, and later as music/instructions for a hearty water workout.  This is a slow workout, instructions translated (poorly) from a foreign language, with soft unenergizing background music.  I should have returned it.",1276560000,22,281,5.222222222222222
