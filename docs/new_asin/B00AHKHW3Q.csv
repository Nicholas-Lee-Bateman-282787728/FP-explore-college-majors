5425111,5,B00AHKHW3Q,"I really enjoyed this DVD. As a beginner, I thought this DVD was easy to follow and yet challenging on my core muscles. I can see how doing this DVD along with the rest of my workout routine will get my core tight and toned. Tara is a great teacher that you can learn how to do the moves correctly and having Tia do it as well just goes to show that yoga is something that normal people can do, even if not perfectly the way Tara does.",1359331200,,435,3.9545454545454546
5425112,5,B00AHKHW3Q,"Great for beginners. None of the usual ""flower child"" dialog you get with most Yoga DVD's. Very relaxed and easy to do. Easy routines and a great workout. I'd recommend it to anyone.",1359158400,4,182,4.545454545454546
5425113,5,B00AHKHW3Q,"Got this dvd for my fiance and she is just beginning yoga and she really likes it. If you are trying to lose weight and trying to get stress free. This workout is perfect! She's a big fan of Tia and loves this dvd, its only a hour so perfect for people just start off",1359072000,3,267,3.8727272727272726
5425114,2,B00AHKHW3Q,"I was so excieted to put the DVD in, and start the work out, I would of wished that I enjoyed the work out, there was no pre intruction on how to do the excercise, I was hoping there was intruction before getting right into the yoga position, nope straight to the point. Now if your a little heavy this yoga can hurt you because there is no basic intructions that are given. I want to get down maybe a dress size and then try it again. But if your thighs are heavy its to tough to do. I love Tia, but your already thin so, I must say it was deligthful to see you in action......",1358985600,,578,3.948717948717949
5425115,4,B00AHKHW3Q,I really enjoyed this workout. Tia was down to earth and the instructor made it easy to follow the yoga routine. The emphasis on the core is helpful and really works! I would reccomend this dvd to beginners who are just starting out learning yoga.,1357776000,,247,4.511111111111111
5425145,5,B00AHKHW3Q,"this is the best yoga workout ever, not very relaxing because of talking and laughing in it, but the workout is spectacular!",1370563200,,124,4.681818181818182
5425146,3,B00AHKHW3Q,"I liked the video a lot....when I first got it.  After the third or fourth time of doing the exercise, I realized I was getting a little bored with hearing the same conversation each time.  It would have been best if they could just exercise.....quietly or at least just have Tara explain what to do and do away with all the ""talk"".  I haven't used it in a while because i don't want to listen to the conversation that takes place during the routine again and again and again.....",1366070400,4,480,4.370786516853933
5425147,5,B00AHKHW3Q,"its great for people who are beginners in yoga and its great  to reccomend to friends and family
who loves yoga",1364860800,,111,4.285714285714286
5425148,3,B00AHKHW3Q,"I love Tara Stiles and am always on the lookout for workouts by her or featuring her. The moves in this video are nothing new compared to what you find on her youtube channels or on her other DVDs. Tia Mowry is cute and a welcome addition to your regular Tara Stiles video but I could have done without all the giggling they do, I found it distracting when trying to get into the routine. Great routine for for those with a bit more experience or for those getting back into yoga.  Real beginners to Vinyasa flow may find it a bit tough as it's faster than other types of yoga. I've been doing Tara Stiles routines for two years, if you stick with it, a video like this will eventually become easy.",1362960000,2,698,4.2481203007518795
5425149,4,B00AHKHW3Q,"I saw this video on an episode of Tia and Tamara and decided to try it out because I like the girls and wanted a new way to work out. I've done pilates before (as in worked along to a tape a few times about 5 years ago) but I'd never tried yoga so I thought this would be a good addition to my running/biking workouts. I've been working out regularly for about 6 months, but I'm still not in shape; I'm gaining muscle but I'm still overweight. That being said, this video was very easy to follow along with, and the ab/arm workouts make my muscles feel strong. I've been alternating this video with a few other workouts for about 3 months now, and I'm still loving it. Tia and Tara get along well, they offer multiple approaches to more difficult poses, and the flow is even and relaxing. I'm borderline obsessed with this workout.

There are only 2 cons to this program (in my opinion, this may not be a problem for others). One is that, although this is a core video, you spend A LOT of time on your hands (in downward dog, plank, and other like poses). If you're heavy, this may be a little harder on your hands. They do move quickly through poses, however, and you aren't putting your weight on your hands for too long at one time. The other issue is these girls are CHATTY. The first time it's cute and you don't really notice it, but after a while their little banter gets real annoying. I've cursed at the TV a few times when being held in a tough pose for a while because Tia and Tara are talking. Overall though, these little qualms shouldn't be enough to deter you from getting this video; its a good workout that almost anyone could do, and it single handedly turned me on to being a yoga fan. My muscles are working in ways that running and biking never would have reached. Great DVD!",1362268800,10,1796,4.2823529411764705
5425150,5,B00AHKHW3Q,I was pretty new to Yoga and this DVD helped me out So much. Arrived in a very timely fashion and I highly recommend it to anyone.,1361836800,,130,3.8518518518518516
5425151,5,B00AHKHW3Q,This is a really good yoga DVD.  Kudos to Tia and Tara for sharing their skills and talent with us.  I felt the effects of this workout immediately after completing one session.  I love when that happens.  Word of advice:  please stretch before you begin.  I learned my lesson the hard way and am now paying the price for it.  But I will be back at it soon.,1360627200,2,357,4.161764705882353
5425152,5,B00AHKHW3Q,"I'm a yoga instructor, so I bought this for my sister to introduce her to yoga, and she loved it!",1360022400,2,97,3.9
5425153,3,B00AHKHW3Q,"I love Tia and I like Yoga but this is NOT for beginners. I will admit that I am out of shapish, but I have done some yoga before.  This video goes way to fast and does not really explain the move or show modifications much if you are not able to do the moves.  This is my first time doing the video and I do think that I will be able to get the hang of it, but I would like more explanation of moves if you are going to say this is for beginners. I think it is a medium level. I think this video could take me from a beginner if I am consistent about it.  I will let you know how it goes.",1359763200,4,589,3.622047244094488
5425154,3,B00AHKHW3Q,First time trying yoga so it could be trying to adapt. It's sorta boring but again that's my personal opinion.,1359331200,,110,4.55
8551670,5,B00AHKHW3Q,I've had this dvd for months and finally decided to try it out.  I've been weight lifting and doing HIIT for awhile and needed a program to really open me up.  I love Tara and her gentle commentary but I completely agree with other reviewers!! Tia's chatter kind of ruined the FLOW of yoga. However I love the hip opening stretches in each move.  Perfect to do after a strenuous workout when your muscles are already warm.,1483401600,,422,4.454545454545454
8551671,3,B00AHKHW3Q,I love the mowry sisters so I was really looking forward to this. I am not a yoga person so I am starting from the start and give this a good easy to follow for a beginner. Cons would include the talking between the two of them. Tara Stiles seems like she is just being nice and not a good fit for how friendly Tia is. I love Tia if it was just her I would give this a better review. Just not good chemistry fit and far too much talking and not enough direction if your not watching you aren't sure exactly whats happening. It has a ton of planks in this video I almost felt like if I only did planks I could have skipped buying this video all together.,1466812800,,653,3.9545454545454546
8551672,5,B00AHKHW3Q,You will definitely feel the burn five minutes into it. I love this DVD!,1436918400,,72,4.214285714285714
8551673,5,B00AHKHW3Q,I love my DVD,1432857600,,13,2.5
8551674,5,B00AHKHW3Q,first time ever doing yoga and I LOVE it. I have had two babies who are 17months apart and my mommy belly is starting to go away after just 5 workouts,1424649600,,150,3.870967741935484
8551675,4,B00AHKHW3Q,Routine is difficult to learn as a beginner. Overall enjoyed the relaxation of the yoga. Both ladies were pleasant throughout the routine.,1403827200,,138,5.318181818181818
8551676,2,B00AHKHW3Q,Horrible. I am taking classes and had this at home to do in between. I could not even get through the first 10 minutes without being uber annoyed. They laugh and talk way too much! The moves are too quick for beginners. No mods. Not relaxing at all. This one is going to the trash! Save your $$,1401753600,,294,4.086206896551724
8551677,5,B00AHKHW3Q,"I give this five stars because it works, well at least for me it does and I bought because it is focused on your core however it's you are working out more than just your core. Great dvd!",1371340800,,187,3.9473684210526314
8551678,5,B00AHKHW3Q,"I'm a big big fan of the Mowry sisters and this video is so much fun, it's exercise and fun all at the same time. Tia and Tara are really good in this video, I highly recommend it for people who are beginners in yoga.",1371081600,,217,3.8444444444444446
8551679,4,B00AHKHW3Q,"The workout is good and flows easily. The routine isn't too easy nor too challenging and hits all the major muscles. However, there is just too much chit chat between Tara and Tia. They have good chemistry and obviously have a good relationship, but there is too much giggling for a yoga DVD.",1370822400,2,292,4.528301886792453
