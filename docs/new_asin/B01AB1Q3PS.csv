8746886,3,B01AB1Q3PS,"This is a fable based on the outlaw Belle Starr which is entirely made up of well-worn cloth. It tells a tale of a willful beautiful rich southern lady who is infuriated when she learns that the South lost the Civil War. She is angry because some Northern renegade soldiers killed her father. Her brother who fought for the South tries to get her to accept reality, but she refuses. She is courted by a Northern major, a friend of her brother, but rebuffs him. Instead she joins with Sam Star, a handsome renegade southerner and marries him; hence her name is Starr. The gang soon turns to criminal activity, which she dislikes.",1468368000,3,628,4.566371681415929
