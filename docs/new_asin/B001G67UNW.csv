8304059,5,B001G67UNW,Globe trekkersnalways puts out a good product!,1433635200,,46,5.714285714285714
8304060,5,B001G67UNW,Very good and I highly recommend it for use in Spanish Classes to acquaint the students with Latin America.,1430265600,,107,4.684210526315789
8304061,3,B001G67UNW,"For the cost, it's dated, spends way too much time on climbing volcanos and the Mayan history. There are better up-dated dvds out there on your specific areas of interest in Central American countries with interviews including locals and ex-pats. Trying to cover every country in a minimal time frame doesn't cut it.",1422144000,,316,4.981132075471698
8304062,4,B001G67UNW,I've always loved  watching Globe Trekker and it's cool that you can purchase your favorite episodes on dvd.,1420502400,,108,5.0
8304063,4,B001G67UNW,"The Ruta Maya episode is great- I showed this to some of the high school classes I teach and they enjoyed it.  Perfect mix of entertainment and education, especially if you are studying Guatemala or the Mayans.

Don't bother with the El Salvador/Honduras episode, it was a waste of time and I'll never get my life back from that hour previewing it.  There's a short clip in El Salvador that would be worth showing classes.

I haven't watched the other episodes yet... hopefully they're good.",1417651200,,491,4.741176470588235
8304064,5,B001G67UNW,Loved It.,1413331200,,9,4.0
8304065,3,B001G67UNW,"This series is reliable in showing the culture of different countries without glossing over the difficulties. There are scenes of real natives as well as tourists' views of the locales. The audience is middle to high school; just be aware that there will be scenes of people smoking cigars, a big export in two of the countries.",1377820800,4,328,4.771929824561403
8304066,4,B001G67UNW,"I bought this DVD on recommendation from a friend at work.  I am going to be traveling through central america this summer so I am eager for anything and everything that has to do with traveling through that area!  I found this video to be very helpful, as far as giving one a general introduction to the different cultures and the variety of things there are to do in the different countries represented. I appreciated that it was thorough enough to guide the viewer through quite a few places/activities that are ""off the beaten path."" The only downside to the video is that it's barely 3 hours long.  I wish they spent more time in each country. But then again, I could watch like 50 hours of travel through this region so maybe that's just me! :o)",1304208000,10,751,4.467153284671533
8304067,4,B001G67UNW,"The Lonely Planet travel series is different from many of the other travel series such as Rick Steves, Samantha Brown and so on.  Each episode is a little quirky.  It seeks to express a feeling more than landmarks. The advantage with  their Central American series is you get to see countries that aren't often featured on travels DVDs.  If you want all the Central American episodes buy this single pack.  Much more economical than purchasing single episodes.  Enjoy!",1252713600,15,468,4.935897435897436
