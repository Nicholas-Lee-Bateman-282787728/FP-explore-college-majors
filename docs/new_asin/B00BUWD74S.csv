5676852,4,B00BUWD74S,"I like horror films. this is a horror film (scarey with Ms Potente doing a great job) and it's sequel (just ok). ""anatomy"" is one of three films that literally made my flesh crawl- the other two were the original ""carnival of souls"" and ""audition"".
I have a background in medicine and have done cadaver work...let me put it this way..there's an old saying ""Now the shoe's on the other foot""...",1372896000,,393,4.549295774647887
8574373,5,B00BUWD74S,Franka Potente acts great in both movies on this double feature although Franka plays a smaller role in the second Anatomy.,1498521600,,123,4.904761904761905

8574375,1,B00BUWD74S,"I hate the English over dub - i originally viewed the original Anatomie in German, and it was awesome!! I am going to purchase the German version.",1445990400,,146,4.444444444444445
8574376,3,B00BUWD74S,"I loved the first film. The second one, not so great. My review is mostly on the quality of the BluRay. They didn't improve the audio or video quality for the first movie (I haven't watched the second one yet.) It's a grainy picture and the audio is low. I recently purchased the BluRay of Lola Rennt, and that was improved a lot. Beautiful picture and sound is great on that one. I wish they'd cleaned up Anatomie before transferring it to BluRay",1428537600,2,447,4.397590361445783
8574377,5,B00BUWD74S,Thank you !!!!!!,1406160000,,16,4.666666666666667
8574378,5,B00BUWD74S,"I saw these awesome movies on one of the Premium Channels awile back and was very impressed with the GERMAN mind-set on thriller filming techniques!
So glad I decided to have them permanently in my movie collection.
DVD arrived in super condition and in a timely fashion--Thanks!  !  !",1400198400,,285,4.795918367346939
8574379,3,B00BUWD74S,"I had never seen these movies before. And I only bought them because they were inexpensive. After watching them, I felt they were good as far as the acting went. But that's about it. The story was ok, but could've been more evenly paced. the star, Franka Potente, was in the first one, but only had a couple of brief appearances in the second one. Only ok as thrillers.",1394323200,,369,4.36231884057971
8574380,5,B00BUWD74S,"You know, Mill Creek Entertainment has another winner here.  Anatomy & Anatomy 2 are German made horror movies.  These are concerning renegade doctors of the ""Anti-Hypocratic"" Society who feel that the Hypocratic oath of the medical field holds medical science back.
  The real terror here is, the movies make it seem plausibly real.  I will hand it to the Germans for making me feel scared of doctors over this one.",1393718400,,416,4.885714285714286
8574381,3,B00BUWD74S,"Not exceptional. The video quality is like the dvd, the second anatomy has no english language spoken, only forced english subs. No features.",1384041600,,141,5.173913043478261
8574382,5,B00BUWD74S,"I really enjoyed this set a lot and now owning it on Blu-ray. The original I thought was fantastic. The sequel, although not nearly as good, was still a decent sequel and pleasant to watch. Great price on this set. This set does have English subtitles for both films. Seems Mill Creek and Echo Bridge are now finally realizing some people need this for hearing issues.",1372982400,4,368,4.590909090909091
