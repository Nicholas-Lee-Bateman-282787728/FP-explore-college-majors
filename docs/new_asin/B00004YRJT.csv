Imagine my surprise when I put in the DVD and there's no dance instruction at all! The whole DVD is of professional dancers doing their routines. They are definitely talented (though some were very overdone), but that's not why I bought it.

CD1 has a good selection of songs for different dances, but CD2 is nothing but Tango.

A very big disappointment. I'm returning it.",1140566400,,608,4.509090909090909
7927458,1,B00004YRJT,"The dancers are superbly skilled -- no question there -- but this film is neither entertaining nor informative.  There is virtually no unifying theme other than the dancing itself. It is not about competition, nor is it instructional or emotionally compelling, so what is the purpose of this production?  If it's meant to be about partner dancing, the emotional connection between the couples on the dance floor should be given great emphasis.  However in this film, that connection is lost -- completely.
It displays the dazzling technical skills of the dancers, but what good is that without communicating feelings. The problem seems to lie within the choreography of the individual routines.  Although the dancers' lines match beautifully, it's like watching two solo acts performed simultaneously.  Compare the performances in this film with those couples doing competitive ballroom or figure skating as shown on TV...you'll see what I mean.",1017273600,10,945,5.358108108108108
7927459,2,B00004YRJT,this DVD is really just scenes from some dances... but technique is not so well and the series are not so impressive... If you are watcing dance comp. on Eurosports than no need to buy this DVD...,1017187200,,196,4.324324324324325
7927460,5,B00004YRJT,"This DVD has a very good cross section of both International as well as American Style dances in both the Latin/Rhythm and Standard/Smooth categories.  It was recorded with excellent care in Asheville, NC at the Grove Park Inn.  The performances are all done by DanceSport Champions and are as beautiful as they are energetic and fun to watch.  The music chosen was also great. This DVD is one that will entertain most lovers of ballroom dancing, and will keep us practicing the extra hours so we can some day hopefully dance as well as the professionals.",993340800,17,555,4.760416666666667
