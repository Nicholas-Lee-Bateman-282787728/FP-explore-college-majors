2269639,5,B00097E6UO,This was an absolutely thrilling video.  It's too bad it wasn't marketed here in the US.  It's an excellent movie on the holocaust.,1255737600,,131,4.6521739130434785
2269640,5,B00097E6UO,"The boy played a good part well showing a lot of feeling with expresion, shielded from some truths of the war and used to keep a secrete with hes IQ level using chess as sorce. Finding out more of the war and finding his way on his own to fill a goal left to him by his mother and later to find his real father, good ending and a lot of hard ships the boy has to come to terms with. I brouhgt this movie to see what this child did during the war and how he copted with it.",1232668800,,472,3.73
2269641,5,B00097E6UO,"This movie is so moving. It is always amazing to me what people who survived the Holocaust did. In this case a small boy. I do not want to ruin the story for you in any way.

If you love to se people helping people and the triumph of the human spirit then this is a must see.",1212364800,2,275,3.7413793103448274
2269642,3,B00097E6UO,"This film has a lot of good points, including a sensational acting job by the young protagonist, who is utterly convincing as a worldly Resister in Nazi-occupied France in 1942, true to his family's heritage.  And there are some subtle tributes to film classics here and there--""Oliver Twist"" and ""Casablanca"" for example.  Some of the cinematography is brilliant.

The basic conception--a young boy who has had to grow up in a world where he is in constant danger, may even have to sacrifice his life, and happens also to be a chess prodigy--is terrific and could have made a beautiful, unforgettable film.  Alas, there are too many illogical leaps.

The kid is protected by an elite corps of Resistance fighters, so why is he not in more control of his situation? Why does his mother agree to an exchange that makes no sense--it's not like the kid is being held captive, as was suggested earlier in the film he would be if caught?  How does his estranged father instantly become a skilled guerilla warrior, when he had been an indolent playboy?

The boy turns in an outstanding performance, but the others range from bad to really bad.  I could not tell if the film is dubbed, but even that would not explain some of the dialogue that sounds as if it's being read.  The character of the ""Professor"", who's trying to help the Nazis, is unclear. Is he just a nihilist?  His conduct suggests that, but why isn't he more complex?  Why does he ultimately give up?  Has he grown to love the boy, child of his former student?

Finally, there is too little in the way of intrigue here.  At the end, I was waiting for a twist of some kind.  It's not by any means a bad or boring film, but it could have been so much better.",1196553600,,1716,4.490322580645161
2269643,4,B00097E6UO,"Since the film's basic plot has already been reviewed, I will just add a few comments.  The ""dirty little secrets"" seem to be coming out now about how American businessmen helped finance the Nazis-- also the fact that the Swiss were hardly innocent bystanders, raking in all of that Jewish cash.  So I think the movie ""does good"" in tempting viewers to investigate the truth.

This is a LONG production, 130 minutes, and I thought it did drag a bit in spots.  Perhaps, had I learned how to play chess, those segments would have been more interesting to me.

The scenery and settings were intriguing-- especially the old French cars and telephones.

I had difficulty with two plot elements:  First, trans-Atlantic phone calls were popping back and forth with modern, fiber-optic ease.  Second, the boy's father instantly changed from a piano-playing party guy to a hardened resistance fighter just as soon as he hit European soil... a little difficult to believe.

But all in all, a good effort and psychological study of how the horrors of World War II affected an 11-year-old. Thomas Sangster's acting was superb.",1136332800,22,1114,4.9144385026737964
2269644,3,B00097E6UO,"This foreign film gives us a picture of World War II from a different perspective.  The young boy was a chess wiz and with his memory helped to keep his mother's crusade alive.  There is much violence in this movie based on the novel DADDY by Loup Durand, but then that was how life was in Germany and France in those tumultous years.

It was interesting to see a movie made where that kind of thing really occurred in the 1940s.  It was much better than seeing top name American actors pretending.  These actors made it appear almost real.

I can't say why I bought the DVD, could be the enigmatic pose of Thomas Sangster.  The photo on the front makes you want to hug that child.",1121299200,15,681,4.31496062992126
2269645,4,B00097E6UO,"TamA has already given us a tantalizing synopsis of this movie's intriguing scenario.  It takes place primarily in France rather than Germany, yet the Nazi occupiers are everywhere, and we are not allowed to forget for a moment their heartless menace to anyone daring to operate an underground resistance movement. Paranoia would not be too strong a term for the mood induced.

I like this film despite many seeming improbabilities in the plot.  Stories so intricate and subtle often require many viewings to connect all the dots.  Here I dearly want to explain why (as happens again and again) a character must do something the hard way rather than the easy and obvious way.  It's always painful to see excellent filmmaking lavished on a foundation of sand.  This movie has piqued my interest enough to want to read the novel on which it is based, if only to answer such questions. If the answers are good, I'll gladly raise my vote to 5 stars.  If not, I'm afraid I'm too generous with 4.

But now for the many attractions. The masterful Klaus Maria Brandauer brings his experience in ""Burning Secret"" to bear for another role as an urbane, complex, psychologically scarred villain opposite a sensitive, solemn, very intelligent hero only 11 or 12 years old (in this case, Thomas Sangster).  Both stars are mesmerizing, as are several other actors.  The cinematography is gorgeous throughout, exteriors and sumptuous interiors. The buildup of tension erupts in several breathtaking action scenes.  And the composer of the dreamy, melancholy score deserves an Oscar.  A CD should be released just so we can enjoy the music.  For fans like me of cinematic atmosphere, this film provides it in spades.

If only I could be confident that the whole is more the sum of its parts.",1115596800,23,1775,4.873333333333333
2269666,5,B00097E6UO,The film was great.  Thomas Sangster is such a good actor; in fact all the other actors were good too.,1423699200,,102,4.1
2269667,4,B00097E6UO,"I purchased this movie for my dad and it's the best story, one worth watching. If you like a very good drama then you will enjoy this film.",1417478400,,139,4.0
2269668,5,B00097E6UO,"A magnificent DVD just like a historical novel.  This production gives life to the tragic issues of La Rafle (French: The Roundup) of the Juif (French: Jews) which commenced planning during 1942 and started during the Summer of 1945 by Nazi Occupation of France.  This DVD is entirely correct in its presentation the Roundups took place in both the occupied and unoccupied Zones of France.  What this DVD reveals - and the world should applaud this effort - the French people - religious and humanist - stood up and through the French Underground as well as individual efforts defied the Nazi Gestapo and Nazi Collaborators to save the Jews.  The French hid large sums of monetary wealth in Switzerland and elsewhere to save the Jews.  the Actors depicted the roles which adults played in the Round Ups.  As a former military officer, the feature I found most helpful to completely grasp the impact on the French - including the Jewish refugees - was the mental, emotional, physical, psychological and spiritual trauma that was experienced by the young - through the extraordinary acting of Thomas Sangster as the 11-year-old French boy named Thomas:  Precocious and brilliant describe Thomas Sangster in this production - you would have to view this DVD production to
appreciate the proposition how Thomas Sangster portrayed the tragic realities to appreciate the historical facts of the holocaust
incidents in World War II France and other European Nations.  The Nuremberg War Crimes Trials emphasized the German People were not on trial, but the Nazis and their role in the Third Reich.  This DVD will enable you to understand this principle applied by the Allies.",1412812800,2,1667,5.032727272727273

2269670,3,B00097E6UO,Its a interesting film but it has been cut down by about 60 minutes. The original running time was 180 minutes. and some scenes were cut or shortened. I wish it had been released in its full running time.,1404691200,2,204,4.256410256410256

I now can say I have seen the movie lots of time
the story line is great and see how it all unfolds wow
I gave it four stars love it",1371686400,,178,3.475
2269672,5,B00097E6UO,It was amazing what the boy went through and what he held in his mind.  He was dedicated in preserving what his mother started.,1369958400,2,127,4.291666666666667
2269673,4,B00097E6UO,"Good story line.  Only thing I found confusing is that the movie is presented in 2 parts.  Nowhere on the cover does it say this, and there's no index at the beginning of the film.  You have to play through the credits of ""Part 1"" until the end when ""Part 2"" begins.",1366243200,,266,4.076923076923077
2269674,2,B00097E6UO,The movie is slow and seems jumbled together. There are philosophical rantings from a philosophy professor and a lot of talk about the game of chess. I like chess but when it becomes part of the theme of a movie then the word boring enters into the description. The scripting is poor and the director is low level at best. save your money.,1322870400,,339,4.396825396825397
2269675,5,B00097E6UO,"Excellent period film.  I think that it captured the French Resistance and their war against the Nazi occupation and was very realistic about the price that they paid for it.  It did not sugarcoat the sacrifices that their families and they made.  The use of the young chess prodigy with the capacity to memorize ""50,000"" games as a means to explain his ability to memorize ""the list"" that so many died for made his accomplishment realistic.  Young Thomas Sangster is an excellent young British actor who has a great future.  He is now in his early twenties, and I look forward to him in adult roles.",1317427200,6,600,4.622641509433962
