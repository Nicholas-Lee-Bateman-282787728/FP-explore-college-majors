2114843,5,B0002PUGVQ,"I love Yoga Dance Earth! Serena is very encouraging, not at all intimidating as she leads you through flowing steps, easy lunges (not too low, and with a dancey flair), and some upper body movements to gently tone your body. This is NOT a traditional sculpting workout - there are no weights, etc., and the exercises are hidden in the dance -- but it is a lot more fun! The simple drumbeat in the main workout works well with the fun African/Middle-Eastern style hip and shoulder moves, and she does an encouragig affirmation dance/chant (""I love my skin, I love my face, and I celebrate me!"") The three 20-minute workouts are similar in nature, so it's not often that I do all three at once -- but I usually do one from Yoga Dance Water after doing one from Yoga Dance Earth!",1185926400,,776,4.471830985915493

2114845,4,B0002PUGVQ,"I own all of Ms. Contello's DVD's and I think that her workouts are very ""mindful"" and inspirational. The workouts are broken down into 3 workouts on each DVD. Each one is similar to one another, but a little more challenging @ each interval. I REALLY like her music that she chooses and she is very personable in her instructions, which are easy to follow. I would recommend this (and other) DVD's to anyone. It is a really neat twist of yoga/dance/whatever. It brings a spice to any workout collection and also opens your mind a little wider to the way you percieve things in life.",1136851200,13,583,4.509433962264151
2114846,5,B0002PUGVQ,"I've done yoga for almost 30 years.  I've done tai chi for almost 10.  Aerobic dance for just about 20 years, and belly dance for probably 5 years.  I have exercise tapes of all kinds, even country line dancing.  To keep a variety going, I cycle through them, but have always yearned for one tape that combines my main loves -- yoga, tai chi, aerobics, belly dancing, and exotic dance.  This is it!  I've finally found it!  And, when they talk about global dances, they mean it.  On this tape, you learn and practice African, Latino, Indian, and Spanish dance techniques.  Sarina blends them beautifully with the yoga, tai chi, aerobics and belly dance while really inspiring you by sharing her childlike joy in the music & body movement.  Nicely chosen music that neither drowns out her instructions nor is so quiet in the background that you can barely hear it.  It is just right, as is her voice and sweet way of instructing you.  There are warm-ups, workouts, and cool downs (3 of each) on the DVD.  Really, this is something for those at most levels of fitness and dance ability.  Start slow, make your movements not so big....then as you get used to the movements and get practiced, get as enthusiastic as she is.  I'm addicted to this one and the Fire one.  I have yet to try the Water one, but it is my next purchase.  :)",1128729600,32,1329,4.470833333333333
8030533,5,B0002PUGVQ,"I really enjoy those short dancing workout routines. They are really fun, and since they are short as well, it is easy to fit them into a daily routine, and I am always looking forward to them. Even if I don't feel like ""working out"", they are such a pleasure, that once I started, I truly enjoy them. I have the ""Water"" and ""Fire"" DVD as well, and I switch them up. I can only highly recommend them, just the word ""Yoga"" is deceiving, if you are expecting ""Yoga"" you might be disappointed, and better look for something else. She offers easy dance moves, paired with some simple mainly leg workout and stretching sequences incorporated into dance moves.",1417737600,,654,4.5508474576271185
8030534,5,B0002PUGVQ,my wifes loves this video when she's not talking about this one she's talking about the fire or water video. She says they are fun to dance to and is a great workout,1414368000,,165,4.03030303030303
8030535,5,B0002PUGVQ,"This is the most enjoyable Yoga DVD I have ever watched, I danced with her in free will.  She prompts us to just be ourselves and dance our heart and spirit out.  She is amazingly sweet in her speaking and in her helpful step-by-step guidance.",1410998400,2,243,4.377777777777778
8030536,2,B0002PUGVQ,It irks me that yoga has become such a buzzword for selling products that this dance video should incorporate the word yoga in its title.  It is fun to exercise to but it has nothing to do with yoga.  I may have given more stars if it had a more relevant title.,1405900800,2,261,4.0
8030537,5,B0002PUGVQ,"The Yoga Dance DVD series is fantastic if you love to dance and sit too much.  I started using the videos to get back in shape and get stronger after a lengthy illness, and they're great.  Each video includes three 20-minute segments that get progressively harder (beginner, intermediate, advanced).  Each of the segments includes a warm up, aerobic work out, cool down and stretches.  They're low impact and Sarina gives tips on how to increase/decrease the workout intensity to fit your needs.

Each DVD focuses on something different.  ""Earth: Toning & Sculpting"" is a good all-around workout with lots of leg work.  ""Water: Stregthening & Flexibility"" is my go-to workout when I've been sitting too much and my back is stiff.  ""Fire: Fat Burning & Weight Loss"" is more aerobically challenging.  All the DVDs include moves to increase flexibility and provide a nice (but short) aerobic workout.

The 20-minute sessions are easier to fit into a workday, and they're fun so I'm motivated to do them. The music is international; on ""Earth,"" it's mostly African drums.  Dance moves come from many styles: ballet, African dance, flamenco, etc. As an instructor, Sarina is calm and gives clear instructions.

After trying and rejecting lots of DVDs, I've found a treasure in this series. If you're looking for a fun, gentle, short dance workout at the beginning and intermediate levels, this could be great for you, too. Note, however, that it's not about yoga (I don't know why that's in the title).",1373414400,4,1497,4.967871485943775
8030538,5,B0002PUGVQ,This is a good video one of the best I have seen Sarina is a good teacher the vido is easy to follow,1371427200,,100,3.391304347826087
8030539,2,B0002PUGVQ,"If I were 50 and looking for a gentle dance routine themed in different elements, this would be a good DVD for me. I have done a couple of the dances from the Water DVD and one from the Earth DVD and there is nothing relating to yoga in the two. I bought the Fire one also and I'm sure I'll run into the same thing. I have practicing yoga for 3 years and do it every day. I was looking for a supplemental practice that incorporated dance which is why I bought these. I have NO IDEA why they are titled Yoga Dance. So far I have danced to drums and done some salsa and hula Polynesian moves. Nothing wrong with the dance for what it is but I'm very disappointed it is completely misrepresented as yoga combined with dance.",1357084800,4,721,4.120567375886525
8030540,3,B0002PUGVQ,"Each section of the video is VERY short. The warm-ups are twice as long as the actual workout and you go for under 20 minutes for each section. If you tell the main menu to play all then you have to wait through credits to get to the next one just to get a decent length of time in your workout - just using the chapters was easier, link all the 'workout' sections together and do those, then do one of the cool downs at the end.

I'm not sure why this is called yoga dance. There are yoga ideals - such as the connection to the earth and the rooting of the heels, and the mountain pose, but really this was more ike a modern dance with mind fusion - not yoga dance.

It was a fun DVD, but it probably won't find its way into any normal rotation of my exercise; it will just be something I pull out when I need a little extra oomph on top of a normal routine.",1275436800,2,859,3.9310344827586206
8030541,1,B0002PUGVQ,"Seriously, this dvd is so-o-o short, and quite disappointing. I don't know why it is called Yoga Dance because there is no reference to any yoga posture or explanation of correct ways to hold the body to receive full advantage from the workout. I'm sure this teacher is a very sweet person who has wonderful classes, but this does not transfer well to a DVD program. I have had a lot more success with teachers like Shiva Rea who give real instructions as they teach.",1204761600,2,467,4.5058823529411764
8030542,5,B0002PUGVQ,"I've had Sarina's three Yoga Dance DVDs for a few months and I continue to use them regularly (at least 2-3 times per week).

Yoga Dance Earth is the most aerobic and challenging of her DVDs and you will get a good leg workout dancing African-style to the beat of the drums. You will also work your arms a lot, especially in the third workout.",1192579200,9,343,4.276923076923077
