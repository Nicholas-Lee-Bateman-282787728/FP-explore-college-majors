8672895,4,B00MKISKHU,"This new Italian band released a DVD after only one album, and because of this, they decided to play
the complete ""Zarathustra"" suite of Museo Rosenbach,one of the best song coming from the Italian
scene. This is a logical decision when you know that the original singer Stefano ""Lupo"" Galifi is
with the band. What we got here is a complete new version of that song that is a symphonic prog rock
epic with a playing that is rough with heavier guitar riffs and a solid rhythm section with Palo
Tixi on drums. This song being inspired by the work of Nietzsche has some dark atmosphere with long
instrumental passage that coexist with some lighter atmosphere with the delicate piano of Elisa
Montaldo. Like i said, because the band has only one album, the 2 DVD contains the album
""Zarathustra"" in the act 1 of The Seoul performance and on the encore as a medley. The second disk
has also some excerpts  of this song, but who is going to complaint to hear that song with a modern
new sound and arrangements. This second DVD is a collection of various appearance in Italy and in
Nearfest in USA. The sound quality is not the best, but better than some bootlegs material. The act
II of the main concert is the original songs of the band from their first album and it's in the vein
of ""Zarathustra"", if you enjoy bands like Banco or Il Balletto Di Bronzo, you will enjoy this band.",1441584000,,1376,4.4603174603174605

8672898,5,B00MKISKHU,"She got off to a bit of a slow start, with her singing a bit flat. Her vocal range was not as broad as on her records, but her voice at the concert was lower, which I loved and her voice was much richer. She sounded older and more professional on stage. By the second half of the performance she was in very high gear. She is always a knockout; very pretty without being slutty or revealing in dress in the least. She's sexy without even trying. She really belted out the songs. My wife and I were pretty riveted to the dvd. This was the first time we saw her in a concert video. We never saw one of her shows. I admit I am a huge fan. I have everything she has done as far as her studio albums and many of her videos. It seems that there are many bogus Avril DVDs out there, and even sold by Amazon. This one was great. It was obviously filmed off a TV program, so I guess it was a bootleg, but so what? Highly recommended to any true Avril Lavigne. fan. We love Avril!",1391212800,3,970,3.9794871794871796
8672899,5,B00MKISKHU,"A great DVD from the earlier days of an original dynamic Canadian singer, This DVD shows how Avril if she is not already an icon soon will be. This DVD shows the promise she showed,",1368144000,,181,4.2
