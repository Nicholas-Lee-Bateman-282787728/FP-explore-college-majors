Very, very entertaining.  Listening to the audio is entertaining for the driver as well.",1384214400,,257,4.521739130434782
4983661,5,B006CR2O8Q,you have to write something in here or it will not let you rate it what is not to love it is the Penguins,1379548800,,105,3.4166666666666665
4983662,5,B006CR2O8Q,We have almost the entire collection of Penguins of Masagascar and this is one of them. Makes great entertainment for long road trips.,1374364800,,134,4.869565217391305
4983663,5,B006CR2O8Q,"I wish with all my heart they would sell the season of Penguins of Madagascar. This will be a hit in your home, many classic penguin cartoons. Very Satisfied with purchase.",1372118400,,172,4.580645161290323
4983664,4,B006CR2O8Q,"...but then I enjoy most of the Penguins cartoons.  Targeted for the young, but enough little asides to entertain older audiences.  Or maybe I'm just not that mature.  Either way, I had fun.",1370304000,,190,4.696969696969697

4983666,5,B006CR2O8Q,"Nickelodeon doesn't seem to be broadcasting Penguins of Madagascar episodes any longer, and Verizon FIOS doesn't offer it on-demand, so I purchased all 8 available Penguins DVDs.  This one is fantastic, and so are the other seven.  The total running time is 92 minutes and the episodes are: Paternal Egg-stinct; Hard Boiled Eggy; April Fools; Siege the Day; Operation: Neighbor Swamp; Otter Gone Wild; Two Feet High & Rising; and Sting Operation.",1368316800,,446,5.180555555555555
4983667,5,B006CR2O8Q,"If you like the boys and their adventures, this is a must for your collection. While it is lacking a special feature like ""Dr. Blowhole"", it still has some great shows from the series. Enjoy!",1365120000,,191,4.485714285714286
4983668,5,B006CR2O8Q,"The whole story behind Ducky is great.  The Penguins realize that they have influenced Ducky way too much in their commando ways, and take responsibility for that mistake.  At the end, Skipper asks Ricco to ""hide their shame"".  Great video.",1363305600,,240,4.95
4983669,5,B006CR2O8Q,"No matter how old you are, you can laugh along with the kids when watching these shows. Glad there were many episodes on this DVD as a well.  My husband and I wish they would release and make available by the seasons.",1359849600,,217,4.166666666666667
4983670,3,B006CR2O8Q,"The penguins are always fun.  But the introduction of baby characters was a not a great direction to take them in.  I prefer the episodes withe Dr. Blowhole, or where they are tackling larger than life dilemmas, but the duckies just didn't inspire the same sense of adventure. So it was OKAY, but not fabulous.",1356652800,,310,4.618181818181818
4983671,5,B006CR2O8Q,"The Penguins are always a laugh and I expect more movies in the future, we have them all and watch them throughout the year.",1353196800,,124,4.208333333333333

""The Penguins Of Madagascar: Operation Get Ducky""
(Dreamworks, 2012)
---------------------------------------------------------------
Another great collection of wacky, fast-paced, clever, completely kooky adventures featuring the Penguins of Madagascar, animation's most unlikely group of action heroes... The secret-agent commando penguins in the New York Central Park zoo! The series' trademark manic action and wild wordplay whirl past at a mile a minute, with oddball story ideas and kooky characters galore. This volume introduces a new character to the zoo menagerie, a cute yellow duckling named Eggy who is featured on the cover... Perhaps Eggy is a little too cute: for a moment I worried that the little peeper might become the focus of the show the way Timmy did with the Shaun The Sheep series, but Eggy was the focus of a two-part story arc, and then they went on to other topics. Like I say, there's plenty of fun stuff on here: my favorite episode involved the normally sweet-tempered Marlene going out of her gourd when she leaves the comforting confines of the zoo. And of course King Julien is as hilarious as always!  Good family entertainment... recommended! (Joe Sixpack, ReadThatAgain childrens' media reviews)",1351209600,,1296,5.75

4983674,5,B006CR2O8Q,"As always, the penguins do not fail to entertain and make me laugh. All the episodes are cute and a pleasure to watch over and over again. Great writing,story lines, and animation. A total winner.",1336608000,,196,4.628571428571429
4983675,5,B006CR2O8Q,The Penguins never disappoint.  The true stars of Madagascar have got a winner of a series in my opinion. I just hope they keep it up.,1333065600,6,134,4.153846153846154
