3496282,3,B001BNFR80,"I liked this DVD because it was customizable (you can choose 40  minutes of dancing and/or 15 minutes of toning with a 5 minute warm-up option) and I like a longer workout.
I did not like this DVD because:
1. There was a lot of standing and stepping with arms close.  My heartrate monitor never made it to a full cardio workout.
2.  I thought that the instruction was just okay.  Not enough advanced warning as to what was coming up next.  Now we'll do a cha-cha and ""GO!""
3.  I thought the instructors were not as ""fun"" as the first DWTS DVD.  They were monotone and almost boring. Not quite, but close.
I really wanted to like this one because of the funtionality of it, but it didn't work for me....maybe for beginners?",1222041600,89,722,4.343283582089552

3496287,4,B001BNFR80,"Video is good. As a beginner, some of the steps take a little longer to learn. However, the pace is slow enough that you can pick the moves up in god time. It also allows you to view it with sound so you can hear the counts or without the sound if you have the steps mastered. A nice feature.",1458518400,,292,3.8833333333333333
3496288,1,B001BNFR80,"This is very unprofessional and does not give any kind of decent workout. It's poorly directed and it looks like the ""trainers"" have never watched a workout video; they have no energy or enthusiasm. A waste of money.

3496300,5,B001BNFR80,"For someone that does not have salsa experience but love the salsa moves, I enjoy the work out from both dancers.  Both are very direct in what steps to take and how you should do it.  It starts off as low then high intensity.  Both have their own segment when teaching the class and you have the option to move with or without the instructions.  To get the full affect I suggest investing in dance shoes. I purchased my pair from Erotic Salsa Shoes.  Or if it may be easier for others to use ""jazz shoes"" which moves easier on carpet. I purchased mine from payless shoe source.  I use the shoes for other workouts depending on the intensity and if I need the ankle support, which is also important. The dvd is put together well by both partners.",1421020800,,746,4.330935251798561

3496306,4,B001BNFR80,"This has helped me on my way to weight loss and health improvement. Dancing is fun so I actually want to do it. 3 of the 4 routines are pretty tough for me still, but I'm getting there. The Merengue segment is the only one I can do all the way, fully. Cheryl teaches the Merengue, and I like how she brings beginners in slowly and gradually, not so overwhelming. I give this 4 instead of 5 stars because I wish that they had done beginner and advanced segments for each of the 4 dances instead of just one 10 minutes for each dance. I would want 7 or 8 minutes of easy and slightly slower then a separate segment of the same dance twelve to fifteen minutes of more advanced, faster. The transition happens too fast for me with the other 3 dances, especially the ones Max is teaching. Max looks amazing and impressive doing it; I just can't keep up with him. Somebody who isn't as heavy as me might not have so much trouble. I still recommend the video. The included toning workout (about 15 minutes) is worth the cost of the video even without the dancing; it's an excellent everyday workout for building strength.  My balance, endurance, and muscle tone have improved.",1408924800,4,1169,4.412037037037037

3496310,5,B001BNFR80,was a little hesitant about buying the dvd. While working out with the dvd i initially thought the basic steps will not really get me a work out. But 1/2 way into the dvd i was sweating and trying to keep up with the moves. Enjoyed it. The toning part of the dvd is great too. Was sore the next couple of days. The good thing is you can push yourself to a level comfortable to you.,1401148800,,381,3.961038961038961

3496312,3,B001BNFR80,"At under $10, if you truly love the show and these dancers in particular then you may want to try it. I feel that there are probably better, more in depth fitness DVDs out there to learn the dances properly as well as those that would be simpler but elevate your heart rate more.

3496313,5,B001BNFR80,"Workout video I borrowed from the local library and like it so much that  went ahead and purchase it. This video is an hour long and starts with a five minute warm up and continues with the first dance, if you are a dancer or have try some zumba you will not have any problems following merengue steps. The second dance is cha cha cha nice and easy almost like salsa, follow my mambo and closing with samba. All of the dances were not difficult I will recommend this video for beginner. Don't get me wrong you will get some serious sweat and high heartbeats.

LOVE THIS DVD",1398384000,,573,4.296296296296297
3496314,3,B001BNFR80,"I wrote a whole review and it was erased, had to sign in again. no salsa; music is low, and all I like about it is the choices you can make on the menu. Same as ""walk away the pounds"" and I have that.",1391040000,,200,3.5681818181818183
3496315,2,B001BNFR80,"its ok, and they dance really good and I really like them, but never did practice with it. Maybe I'm lazy, that's what it is.",1388620800,,125,4.04
3496316,4,B001BNFR80,"First, as other reviewers have stated as a negative, this IS a dance video.  However, dance IS a form of exercise, so it's a positive issue for me ... and learning latin moves was exactly what I was looking for.  Until recently, I've managed to keep in shape by dancing for fun or cleaning the house (not so fun), but a bad back and knees coupled with the weight gain from quitting smoking all caught up to me at once.  When I'm in my best physical shape, I look like Cheryl, so watching her is a lot like watching what I used to look like in the mirror ... this is a huge plus for me.  Maksim is just the icing on the cake.

As this is a dance video, it's probably important to understand that you should wear some sort of dance shoe, preferably something with a bit of a heel (for the ladies) and leather soles (men and women).  You need shoes that move on the floor properly, and gym shoes aren't the best for this.  I have several pairs of character shoes already, so this wasn't an issue.  Unless you're used to dancing in heels, don't wear the narrow heels these professional dancers do!!!  Dancing in proper shoes helps the moves form much better than tying to do them in your cross-trainers.

I've only had the DVD for two days.  Yesterday, I simply watched it (FFWDing as needed) to get a feel for it.  So far so good.  Today, I moved the coffee table and got started.  I only did a bit of each dance to learn the basic movements, but I still feel like I got a complete workout.  And, while I got my feet tangled a couple of times, it was great fun and I even found myself laughing.  What could be better than that?

Tomorrow, I will do the warm-up and ONE of the dance selections ... probably the cha-cha because I had the most fun with it today.  If I can keep on track, every day I'll choose a different dance after the warm-up.  Hopefully, I'll be able to add a second dance to the line-up soon, and so on and so on until I can do the complete workout at one time.  I don't think I'll get bored with this anytime soon!!!

I with I could give this a 4.5 star rating.  It doesn't deserve the 4 I'm giving it, but I can't quite give it a 5, either.  Unfortunately, the music doesn't quite match the tempo of the dancing.  I have a very strong sense of rhythm and timing, so this throws me a bit.  Of course, it could just be me!",1386201600,,2338,4.130820399113082
3496317,1,B001BNFR80,"DANCE instructors should teach dance and NOT exercise!  If you want to learn to dance, this is the DVD for you.  Did not get a good workout due to the fact that your trying to learn dance moves.  I would not not recommend this to anyone",1385424000,,236,4.086956521739131
3496318,3,B001BNFR80,I became bored with the DVD after awhile. It was alright for the first couple times but I would not purchase these series again.,1385164800,,128,4.375

3496320,5,B001BNFR80,"Fun and easy to do!  I don't think you are going to lose 100 lbs doing this, but you will certainly improver your stamina and coordination, and definitely lose some weight if you are consistent!",1376697600,2,194,4.542857142857143

3496322,5,B001BNFR80,"I attempted 2 of the 4 dances and had a fairly easy time following along although I am not a dancer. It is fast and the major problem was with the turns, I was always going the wrong way or on the wrong foot.  I think the problem is you are watching them like looking in a mirror. It would be easier if I was in line with them, but I will get the hang of it. Each dance segment is 10 minutes long and I would recommend doing the 5 min warmup before starting. I love that you can program what you want to do. The dancer's toning session is tough for me but I am a senior with a heart defect and pacemaker. There are a lot of lunges and pushups which are really challenging because they increase the heart rate above my capacity, but I did most of it. Not too sore today. I can see why the stars shape up and lose weight if they are doing this several hours/day for weeks...... It was a fun way to exercise a little differently. Most of my other dvds are Leslie Sansone. I will definitely purchase others like this once I master these four routines............",1373500800,,1058,4.111111111111111

3496325,4,B001BNFR80,"This DVD would have earned 5 stars from me if it had been just a wee bit slower paced with more detail to some of the steps as it's a challenge to constantly pause, slow or stop in order to get the moves down correctly.  But an excellent workout and pretty easy to follow for a beginner.  Much better than the Julieanne Hough DVD that is really more for an intermediate or advanced dancer.
I would recommend this one to intermediates or younger beginners and would love to have had more of Maks in the instruction classes!",1369872000,,522,4.371134020618556
3496326,2,B001BNFR80,"The reviews were kinda bad for this but I was feeling optimistic when I ordered it.  If you have done Zumba, this is going to feel geriatric.  The music is totally for squares - there's no way to get into the rhythm, because it's the least inspiring ""Latin"" music you'll ever hear.  Latin Cardio Dance?  Hmmm.  How bout Latin Relaxing Dance?  I won't go into the definition of ""cardio."" but the use of the word in context with a work-out dvd would imply that your heart-rate might go up and lead to weight loss.

I will say that if you're brand new to Latin dancing and want to learn the steps in a slower, easy-to-follow fashion, this might be right for you.  I will keep searching for a fast paced cardio dance dvd (that isn't put out by Zumba).",1368576000,2,747,4.323741007194244

3496329,4,B001BNFR80,"There is no way I would ever want to be without this DVD.  There are two reasons why I must have it in my collection.

This video gives great instruction on four Latin dances that are very fun to do.  They don't give the best cardio workout, but some of them can be good for toning, such as the cha-cha.  These dances are good for warming up or doing one more dance before you cool down after some more intense cardio.

Secondly, I really like the toning workout at the end of the video.  If you do it correctly your legs, arms, and abs will burn.  They keep a quick pace to keep your heart rate up and do nice breathing and stretching.  I like to incorporate it after doing two other dances from these videos.",1366588800,,710,4.169117647058823

3496338,4,B001BNFR80,This workout is lots of fun! I am not a good dancer so having to focus on what they are doing makes the workout go by quickly. The toning workout is really good. It hits all major muscle groups in a short time and you feel it working. Very encouraging :),1353456000,,254,4.0

I went for all of them and it got my heart rate high (and the fun meter reached Pluto).  If you don't exercise because you find it boring /difficult/ lengthy but you enjoy dancing this is the workout for you.  I've used it for 3 days, and so far this is the run-down:  first day my heart rate reached cardio and my legs were on fire.  Second day I exaggerated the hip movement and the core bounce of the samba for an incredible core workout!  Today I woke up a bit sore on my core and legs (yey is working!) but most importantly I'm ready for more!  Once I get the routine down, I will try dancing it with actual Latin rhythms to see my new moves in action :)  Is fun, you will sweat, and get a cardio/core/legs workout.

3496349,1,B001BNFR80,"I was very excited about this video until I got it. There was much to like about it if all you wanted to learn were the steps which are easy to learn anyway. They do a good job teaching the steps, but steps don't make a good dancer. They need to break down the other parts of the dance, the hips, shoulders, arms, waist, etc. Just doing the steps does not make the dancing look great or feel great. When you know how to move everything to the music, it is fun and looks good. I guess I can watch and watch and figure out how the rest breaks down, but that is why I bought this CD.

However, after recently joining Weight Watchers, and getting serious about regular exercise/activities, I decided to supplement this video when I can't make  Zumba class.  Well, let me tell you, it is quite a workout.  Not as intense as my Zumba class, but close and a great replacement.  I love the options to ""play all"" with or without instructions, and or to pick the dance you wanna learn.  I also like how on every dance there are both male & female so you get to see the body & hand styling difference.  So, yes I would recommend this.

3496360,4,B001BNFR80,"While the cover says ""Latin Cardio Dance"" , I believe that this is more of a toning video. While some of the dances do raise your heatbeat up , I would say that this is more of a light cardio workout. However while this dvd may lack in some hardcore cardio , I still gave it 4 stars because of the toning in this video. With all these dances you felt your abs,buns, thighs,calfs, and arms working out. That is if you were passionate in your dancing.

Now I would conisder myself an intermidate level when it comes to excersizing, however I will admit that their are still some days where I feel lazy and don't want to work out too hard. With this particular dvd , if you work lazily with it then yeah , your not going to sweat, or if your just doing small steps, not working to your full potiental then yeah this workout is going to dissapoint you. However today I did this workout today and I was sweating up a storm for the first time to this dvd. That's because I really got into the moves , instead of making my moves small , I started making them bigger such as twisting my hips more and taking bigger steps when doing front/back breaks. I have done this Dvd about 5 or  6 times and the first few times I wasn't sweating to any of it except on the toning section of this dvd. Today I was sweating up a storm though from beginning to end, because I was really giving it my all when doing the moves. I know this sounds like common sense, but is seems like a lot of reviewers are giving this a bad rep ,and I believe it's because they didn't give it thier all when doing the workout. Which is understandable, because the instructing in this video can be confusing or hard to understand at times (it is easier though then the other dancing with stars dvds )

Anyways I wrote this so that the reviewers who gave a bad rating to this would maybe give it another chance, and for those of you who are thinking about getting this , but are getting nervous with all the negitive reviews on here, would be willing to give it a chance still.

This dvd includes a customize option which is really nice if your short on time and want to fit in a bit of quickie. It includes a warm up , merangue , cha cha, samba ( which really got my heart rate up the most), mambo , and then a 15 minute routine of toning and sculpting , which really kicks your butt!

3496361,2,B001BNFR80,"I got this video to see if I wanted to order some of the other Latin workout/zumba tapes. I was pretty disappointed. The instructors don't seem to understand the nature of a workout video - you have to warm up, workout, and cool down AT HOME. Not everyone has a ballroom complete with wood floor to work with. The female instructor went way too fast to follow the up tempo steps. She acted like she was being judged on the show or something. The male instructor was better but all those spins are hard on the knees unless you have flooring like a dance studio.
You do break a sweat (hence the 2 stars), but there are better videos featuring more competant instructors out there. Keep looking!",1290643200,,692,4.456692913385827
3496362,2,B001BNFR80,"I have to agree with others --- I like Cheryl and Maksim but this just didn't do them any justice.  Cheryl seemed like she had planned everything out and killed all spontaneity.  A perfect example was when she went to the other dancers to show us the finer points of their moves --- it was so strangely stilted.  Maksim was on the other end, and seemed like he was making up the routine as he went.  I'm sure this wasn't true since the background dancers were in step with him --- so this made him more natural but made the routine seem a bit awkward.

I've had minimal dance experience including a year of ballroom dance yeeeeears ago and did not have a problem picking up any moves even for those dances I had not learned before.  I felt they really did try to stick to the simple basics (except for one move that Cheryl threw in that was rather complex and seemed almost off the beat) which also made it rather dull (not much you can do about that sticking to basics.)  So it probably depends how much background you have and how quickly you pick up things.  They do not break it down oooooooone-twoooooooooo-threeeeeeee --- which would be appropriate for those who have 0 experience and/or maybe not that quick to pick up moves --- they show you one-two-three.

As with all dance type videos I've seen thus far, I wish someone would find a nice way to present them as you would see them in a live class where the instructor is in front of you with their back to you so you can copy their moves (same left/right leg/turn direction) and see their front in a mirror. Instead you are facing each other and have to compensate some.

As a cardio workout, I consider myself at an intermediate level of fitness and this did not work up a sweat for me.",1289952000,,1747,4.3476923076923075
3496363,3,B001BNFR80,"""Dancing with the Stars: Latin Cardio Dance"" was the DWTS franchise's second attempt at a workout, and to be quite honest, it wasn't much better than the first one.  It's focused more at beginners with simplistic steps and minimal arm movement; also, the instructors aren't the best teachers for a workout video.  Maks is better than in the first video since he seems more friendly, but he still could seem more energetic.  Cheryl is just bad as her cuing is horrible, and she appears to be very fake.  However, the dances are still fun to, and here is a breakdown of each:

Warm Up - First, you start off with a short, 3-4 minute warm up that Cheryl teaches.  It consists of very basic stretches, and most people should be able to follow.

Merengue - Led by Cheryl, this is definitely one of the easiest, low impact routines on the DVD.  It starts off EXTREMELY slowly teaching you the basic Merengue step (kind of a mixture of a march and a swivel) half time, then it gradually builds up to showing that basic move fast.  Eventually, Cheryl introduces some steps that move a bit differently in the merengue, but everything is taught slowly, and this dance is very low impact and beginner friendly.

Cha-Cha - This also starts out very basic, with Maksim, who is the instructor of this dance, teaching the basic cha-cha rhythm.  Then you move that rhythm forward, to the side, back, etc.  The second half gets a bit more complex as Maks introduces syncopated timing, which is quite fast.  It is taught very slowly at first, however, before being taken up to full timing, but this makes the dance best for Intermediates.

Samba - Cheryl leads again with this dance which is not only the most complex but also the highest impact of all the dance routines.  This routine has the worst cuing, as Cheryl just calls out ""Now!"" before the step is done, and almost none of the moves are broken down.  However, I, as a rather advanced exerciser/dancer, loved this segment the most with its somewhat complex steps that really got my heart rate up.

Mambo - As Maks leads this routine, the difficulty goes WAY down again to the level of the Merengue.  This dance very much resembles the cha-cha, only without the cha-cha-cha rhythm.  It is very easy, but its movements are big which kept my heart rate up from the Samba.

Toning - Now this was my favorite part of the entire DVD!  It mixed toning with stretching to create a feel-good strengthening workout.  Cheryl and Maks co-teach this routine starting out with some squats and lunges at the beginning.  Next come some more balletic toning exercises with very balletic arms.  Then more leg toning with more lunches, and finally, the toning section is finished with push-ups and more stretches.

Overall, this is an OK Latin dance workout that Beginners and low Intermediates will really enjoy.  More advanced exercisers might want to skip this DVD, though, unless they are huge fans of the show.",1286841600,5,2938,4.678362573099415

3496374,3,B001BNFR80,"I enjoy dance workouts and took many years of dance training when I was growing up, mainly in jazz dance.  Dance for me is a fun way to get my work out in.  I wasn't quite sure what to expect when I borrowed this from our local library.  I enjoy the show and love to dance so I thought it was worth a go.  Weekly, I have dance workouts in my rotation and I especially like Lisa Nunziella's dvds. If you have done any type of latin or salsa style dance dvd's you will be familiar with the steps here: cha-cha, meringue, mambo & samba.  There were a few turns and a quick box step that could give you pause for a moment, but basically, this would be pretty easily followed by someone who had some experience with dance dvds.  That said, I believe that if you want to learn a few moves and are willing to practice a little bit, you could do this as a beginner.  The moves are broken down slowly and that gives you time to catch on to the moves.  If you want to learn and are willing to practice you could pick up the steps here if you were a newbie to dance.

The dvd is approx. one hour long with a 5 minute warm-up, and about 10 minutes on each dance style (split instruction, by Max & Cheryl from the show).  You finish off with a nice dancers toning training/cool down, which includes some stretches and yoga moves to give your muscles a nice finish.

Overall I had fun with it, but would probably not purchase as I would not be challenged enough.  One thing that I wish that this dvd had was a training section where they broke down the steps separate from the actual workout.  This would allow you to hit the ground running on the workout once you had practiced the steps.  Over time I don't want to have to slowly do the moves after I have long mastered them.  I prefer Lisa Nunziella's 5 day latin dance system due to the way she breaks down the steps away from the actual workout so I don't need to slow down.

Bottom line-fun-doesn't seem like a workout, works your core very well, and when I wore my pedometer while working out I had logged in 4500 steps, so you are moving.  I would say though if you are beyond beginner, or have had dance experience whether by dvd or class, you may find this too slow for your tastes.",1275955200,,2228,4.168224299065421
3496375,2,B001BNFR80,I bought this because of the price and thought it would help remove pounds and inches in the waist and leg area.  I thought it was kind of boring.  Also I found that for beginners like me they go to fast over some of the steps and you cannot catch them.  Also in doing so they do some of the steps so fast if you don't understand how they explain to do them or catch it when they do it slow once or twice your out of luck.  I think the only think I like about this cd is the warm up and the tone up at the end.,1273276800,,510,3.6513761467889907
3496376,4,B001BNFR80,"Ok, truth be told I'm a little out of shape. I bought Dancing with Julianne and couldn't even go past the warm up. I figured that this Latin Cardio dvd would be similar. It starts up with a short warm-up and goes on to the merengue taught by Cheryl. This one is probably the only one of the dances that really uses your core. Then Maks teaches the Cha-cha. I happen to find that Maks goes a little slow in both his dances. Then Cheryl again with the Samba. This one reaches a point where it goes super fast, which is good, except you don't know the steps. The last dance is the Mambo by Maks. Again, a pretty slow dance. Then there's the exercise segment, which is actually very good. I finished the whole dvd in one take, but I will say that it wasn't pretty and I didn't do it right. It takes A LOT of patience to get the steps just right. And they don't take time to explain a lot, so if you're like me (with two left feet and no rhythm) this might take a looong time to get down just right. Overall, the dances where fairly short in comparison to say, Julianne's dvd or the Dance of the Pounds dvd. I didn't really feel my heart rate going until I got to the very end of the dvd (the exercise segment). HOWEVER, my legs were crazy sore, so much so that when I got to the exercise segment, I couldn't do many reps because my legs would literally TREMBLE. So obviously, my legs got a kick out of it (pun intended).
This is a good video if you want to learn how to dance as well. If you can get the steps, you've got your basic merengue, chacha, samba and mambo moves down.
Overall, a good dvd for a nice leg workout, the end segment is pretty good and you actually learn to dance! I like this video. Also, don't get discouraged if you can't get the steps right away, keep practicing! You'll get them if you keep seeing and doing them.",1272585600,,1836,4.131284916201118

3496378,3,B001BNFR80,I was so excited to try this when I bought the workout since I love dance workouts but something with this exercise DVD didn't quite work. There was a very akward feel to it and it just felt kind of quite and dull. I started this right after having a baby and I was very out of shape and not once through the whole video did I feel short of breath or like I was getting a really good cardio or muscle workout. In all it was just too easy. I lost interest very quickly and regret buying it now.,1269907200,,493,3.94
3496379,3,B001BNFR80,"First of all, Amazon, why won't you let users give half values for stars? Because I really wanted to give this 3.5 stars.

Anyway. I have done two other Dancing with the Stars DVDs, Dance Body Tone and Cardio Dance, and this one is definitely my favorite out of the three. In this one, the dances are explained more slowly and clearly, and the annoyingly inept instructors (Kym and Ahsly--especially Ashly) are dispensed with. The dances are much easier to learn and therefore more fun to do, since you can really get into them instead of spending the entire time trying to figure out what the instructors are talking about.

However, this DVD is not without its flaws. For one, while Cheryl is quite good at slowly and carefully explaining things, she just doesn't have the right energy level. She talks slowly and dully, so I don't find her terribly motivating as a teacher. On top of that, she's constantly repeating herself: ""feel it in your core"" ""bend and straighten your legs"" etc. It gets tedious. We get it Cheryl. That's not really how you teach something, just saying the same obvious sentence over and over again. Maybe it would be helpful if she was repeating a difficult concept but bending and straightening the legs is generally pretty obvious when it comes to walking in place. Maksim's teaching style, however, is pretty good. He has a higher energy level and gives more helpful, less repetitive instructions.

The other problem I have with this DVD is the lack of variety. All the dances on the DVD are pretty much the same, and utilize basically all the same steps. While this is good in a way, because it really gives you a chance to learn the moves, it gets a little boring after a while. Where the other DVDs were too complicated, this one is a bit too simple. In keeping the dances simple and easy to learn, they became homogenized. For instance, the instructors don't ever really give you anything specific to do with your arms or upper body. Maybe if they added some arms/upper body stuff to make the dances a bit more complex, there would be more variation overall. And because the dances are so simple and taught slowly, you don't get a huge cardio workout here. Some, sure, but you won't be breathing hard and begging for water afterward.

All that being said, I will say that these dances are fun to do and their simplicity makes it easier to add your own flavor to the dances. I enjoy doing this DVD, I just don't think it's the best dance DVD out there. But if you're looking for something that's simple and gentle, that's broken down into short workouts that you can mix and match, and you like Latin dance, this DVD is not a bad place to start.",1268265600,4,2678,4.5613305613305615
3496380,2,B001BNFR80,"I love the idea behind this - people like ""Dancing with the Stars"" and actual dancing lessons are expensive, so it would be cool to learn a few moves that might hopefully be applicable later at weddings or other such events.  That is why I picked up this video, but I was sorely disappointed.

I have done many workout videos in my day, and I enjoy watching the background characters to see what kinds of errors they make.  Although I am always surprised by how many there are in these ""professional"" videos and expected a few, I cannot believe how many errors in formatting (and by foreground/background characters) there are in this video!  Cheryl literally trips over her own feet during her first segment when she demonstrates a move.  In her second segment, she leads off with the right leg only, leaving you feeling lopsided at the end of the workout!

Max isn't much better.  He is the king of ""Put your arms up and take a breath..."" while he tries to think of what to do next.  He miscounts the number of repetitions you make a number of times and seems to lack an awareness of the fact that people doing this video will be mirroring his moves, often calling out incorrect leading legs for us to follow and making for a funny ""correction dance"" on the part of the watcher.  I am sure that this is not an easy thing to learn, but it's as if they never practiced leading into the taping of this video.  The final 15 minute workout is hilarious because Cheryl and Max just keep shoveling the routines off on one another awkwardly, as if neither one can remember what to do next, so they just give up and pass it off.  I loved the fact that during the cool down, Max has you doing some seriously intense push-ups, one-legged no less!  I feel like my heart-rate was higher during this part than at any other point in the entire video, and it was the cool down!!!

This is a thrown together piece of junk video, I didn't get much out of it - it will likely sit on my shelf for the next 50 years.  What a waste.  The only amusing part was trying to figure out if the dark-haired woman in the background had terribly hairy armpits, or if it was just the shadow cast by her arms.  *Spoiler Alert!*  By the final 15 minute segment, she puts her arm over her head and bends to the side, revealing that it was just a weirdly placed shadow for all of those segments before.

I've been doing the workouts for only a few days now, but so far I really love this dvd! Instead of making a pot of coffee first thing when I wake up, I pop this in and do the warm up and one of the dances, which only takes about 20 minutes or so! I love that you can choose which workouts you want to do- they're pretty easy to follow, but I am totally out of shape so some of the moves are pretty tough- like others have said, it kinda goes from easy to advanced moves pretty quickly, so for now if I start tripping over myself I just go back to the easy moves while they are adding all the spins and what not to them... I had been having a lot of back aches, but since starting this my back hasn't been hurting at all & I have so much more energy! I look forward to continuing the workouts, as they seem to get a little easier each time I do them & am hoping to continue seeing some good results!

3496384,2,B001BNFR80,"I bought this DVD because I loved the idea of doing a dance workout. My husband and I took dance lessons for a year, so when I noticed this on the shelves I bought it.

Pros- you do get a sweat, but have to keep moving inbetween segments.
Cons- I am mildly klutzy but thought with a little bit of dance lessons in my background I should be fine. The video really didn't do a good job of explaining as the demos were fast paced. I had a hard time getting the right steps in and it was horribly hard to follow at times. The dancers wore black and it was hard to tell whether kicking in front or back. Occassionally the men and women were dancing opposite (understable if based off a dance, but still confusing from a cardio workout standpoint). The fine points were often not explained, and I feel the workout was somewhat harmed as the form is sometimes as important as the basic move.

Maybe a very simple basic segment with the moves broken down and practiced slowly would be in line before the rest of the video is in order?",1262044800,,1026,4.256410256410256

This seemed to fit the bill and I'm happy to report it fit the bill better than I expected.  Cheryl has a nice instructor voice without being overly cheery, pushy or judgemental.  Maxim needs to speak up and use a few more words of instruction but his portion was good.  The variety of ways you can use this one DVD was also more than expected.  You can design your own work out, having the different instructions flow in the order of your choice. Cool!",1260921600,,542,4.2745098039215685

At some point in the video, the dance moves Cheryl does get really fast and for someone who has never done the moves before, it can get confusing. The music is entertaining and I felt like I got in a decent workout. I feel like if this a video you do very regularly, you should see results. I only just bought it so I don't know yet. They could offer more direction before proceeding into the fast tempo dancing. The perk: even if you don't know how to do the uptempo dance moves, you still feel energized enough to make something up so you at least get some exercise!",1260576000,,644,4.201612903225806
3496388,4,B001BNFR80,"Many people including myself complained that the ""Dancing w/the Stars: Cardio Dance"" had too little teaching & too much fake banter. Well, they listened. This is taught going slow at first & speeds up quick, with much more teaching (though could still be more & several times cues are missing) & almost no needless banter. You can tell they really tried to keep the pace up so people don't say it has too much teaching or not moving.
The classic ballroom music that myself & other people don't like as much as newer music, but that is the style/music they do on the show, so I guess I can't complain.
This only has the choice of music w/instruction or just music, though you can customize which segments you want to do in the menu. This is what I feel gives these workouts the stiff & tedious feel & that Cheryl & Maksim keep to minimal teaching. Also they stay ""professional"" which usually means for anything, stiff & cold. I think their warmth does come through, it's just the producers/directors idea to stay formal.

Warm-up - 4 min
Cheryl leads with all 2 other women, Maksim & 2 male dancers, basic isolation, hip & rib circles & stretching & etc.
Merengue - 10 min
Cheryl leads with all other dances except Maksim. She teaches you the basic & then teaches several other variations. She does teach slow at first, but many times goes from a nice slow pace to the normal VERY fast true speed which is jarring for all the dances she teaches. This is like being in a real dance class, but sped up.
Cha Cha - 10 min
Maksim leads with all dancers except Cheryl.  He also teaches pretty well, going slow at first, he teaches front, back, side, crossovers, etc. He teaches also a couple steps at the end but barely teaches them.
Samba -
Cheryl leads with all other dances except Maksim. She does stay with a basic step touch way too much, but she puts great emphasis on the core & bounce & I did feel since I really exaggerated it.
Toning - 15 min
Cheryl & Maksim take turns teaching w/all the dancers. Cheryl w/a lot of squats w/side leg lifts, lunges w/toros rotations. Maksim is next w/ballet is next w/plies & grand plies, side leg lifts, standing knee lift w/elbows behind head touch crunch, w/etc. basic step moves (ballet workouts especially NYC ballet is much better). Cheryl w/lunges with dance step style, knee lift w/step out. Maksim w/wide stance side stretch, deep lunges, plank w/leg lifts,  dolphin, static plank, push-ups, push-ups w/leg raised, breathe & done.

Yes, the music. Unless you like old band style isa bit of a drag, but I like they always have you moving as they teach. I think they should have build up the slow to fast so it can be more accessible to beginners with left feet, & anyone who knows the routine can do it full speed during the instruction like I do with all my dance dvds.
Speaking of which, most of these dances are basic 2-3 steps, step fwd/back or step to the side or cross. Most don't need a mirror or the instructor's back to you, but some really needed it as some will be lost. Considering they have all those backups, it's a waste they didn't have someone be a modifier of speed & another to always show their back. Having instructors face mirrors tend to make dance instructors more self-conscious, serious & concentrate on their form more then the teaching which makes it a bit more dull usually.
Saying that, if you can get past the music, it's a good workout & they teach you many variations of each style in a short time. Yes, this is easier to follow then Cardio Dance for beginners, though I am glad I have played COUNTLESS dance workout dvds in the past, especially Zumba, etc.

Not a work out at all! Didn't even break a sweat. The segments are too short and its boring.

The steps are shown separately and just repeated over and over, but never put into a routine. There is no sense of flow or cohesion. The dancers are pretty to look at, and obviously can dance.  However, there is a point when the instructor says ""lets have some fun"", and the camera cuts to one the background dancers: her face is as animated as a corpse. She was just as bored as I was. The Dance off the Inches title is a much better DVD if you are looking for a ballroom flavored workout.",1252281600,4,655,4.224
3496397,3,B001BNFR80,The best part of this video is that Cheryl and Maks project their voices very well.  They make it easy to follow the moves.  However I have a carpeted home and doing these moves on a carpet does't work well. I even tried barefeet but that didn't work either. You need an uncarpeted area to really formulate the moves. These are a good workout but you need to have the right floor in your home. If I had a nice dance studio that would be perfect but I don't.  That is my biggest disappointment is that I just can't do them in any room of my home - which was the whole idea of getting the DVD!,1248393600,,591,4.034188034188034
3496398,3,B001BNFR80,"If you're looking for a full cardio workout, this is not the video for you.  There is a whole lot of going over specific steps and not much actual dancing.  It has potential to be a good cardio supplement (not a full replacement for your current routine) once you master it enough to concentrate on the exercise aspect of the dances and not so much on learning the steps.

But if learning basic Latin dance steps is your goal and you are willing to put in the time and effort, this is a pretty good video.  It's always much harder to learn dance from a video rather than a real, live instructor, but if you can't afford classes or your schedule isn't flexible enough for them, this is a decent substitute.

I agree that Cheryl and Maks do not make great instructors.  But let's not kid ourselves ... they are professional dancers, not fitness video instructors.  They're on the DVD because they'll sell the video to DWTS fans better than some unknown dance teacher or fitness instructor would.  The problem with that is that they are not experienced cuers and don't know anything about mirroring.

So if you want to become good enough at the steps that you'll actually enjoy dancing to this video, it will require a lot of patience and practice.  Get ready to press pause and rewind frequently, because if you're not familiar with Latin dance, you're going to have to do that a lot in order to learn how to do the steps properly.  Cheryl and Maks both move very quickly, although Maks is a little better about it than Cheryl.  I really did get the feeling that Cheryl could not wait to finish filming and get out of there.  The same goes for two of the backup dancers (one of whom is Alec Mazo's brother, Genya, who is very robotic here).  The other two backup dancers seemed more enthusiastic.",1248134400,,1794,4.496913580246914

But Cheryl and Maks had NO ENERGY, they were monotone, and that on-camera enthusiasm that makes workout DVDs fun was just not there. and the dancers that were behind them looked like they were bored and wanted to leave. My enthusiasm slowly dwindled as the DVD went on....and on.

3496433,4,B001BNFR80,"I am writing this review fresh off the first workout.  I am 29 years old and somewhat out of shape, but walk on a regular basis.  About 5 years ago and again 3 years ago, I took ballroom dance classes (including latin dance).

Pros: good cardio (I broke a sweat in all segments except the warmup); fun moves (not your traditional aerobic exercise video); ability to customize workouts.

Cons: rapid progress from beginning moves to more advanced moves (as someone who has taken face-to-face lessons enough to dance in social situations, I felt off-rhythm often and knew that due to the speed, I wasn't performing the moves technically.)

Suggestions: moving forward, I will customize the workout to include the warm-up, 1 dance and the toning exercises.  Once that dance is mastered, I will add in a second dance.  Therefore, increasing my length of exercise, but also increasing my confidence in the routines.  I've found that if I get discouraged during a routine, I'm unlikely to want to continue the exercise, which is the ultimate goal.",1232064000,32,1041,4.908571428571428

The critic I would give the instructors, is that they don't do the best job at explaining the dance steps.  Some of the dances are very simple and one of the dances is very difficult. But I'm looking forward to the challenge.",1231804800,2,312,4.166666666666667
3496435,3,B001BNFR80,"I used to dance and I understand when you're a professional dancer how sometimes they teach as if everyone knows what they're doing and they're just providing the moves. However, for a widely distributed and commercialized work-out/dance video, they could've put on a better face. The moves were fun and I learned quite a few steps. Afterwards, I would actually have to do my other workout videos to feel like I exercised. Definitely great for beginners but if you have background in both dance and are active, this is not for you. Cheryl and Max could've provided more enthusiasm overall, though I'm still excited to watch them on the actual show...they seem to provide more enthusiasm there.",1231718400,2,693,4.931623931623932

This is for beginners, intermediate or advanced would not get any benefits from this except to learn a few dance steps.  I do, however, Like the instructors very much.  Their ques are off from time to time, but over all they are decent instructors.  The only reason I gave this a 1 star is because of the instructors.",1228003200,5,552,4.2
3496439,5,B001BNFR80,"As a long-time ""Dancing with the Stars"" fan, I was really surprised--just recently--to discover this 2008 Latin Cardio Dance workout. I had no clue such a product existed. I immediately ordered it, not having the faintest idea what the DVD would bring. Suffice it to say, I was ""very pleasantly surprised and pleased.""

The DVD is 60 minutes of a great cardio workout. Even though other reviewers, who are already in great shape, were not particularly pleased, I am. It's been awhile since I have done a strenuous workout. Well, folks, you will get one here!! I have gone through the entire 60 minute program twice and have yet to complete each dance segment. (I'm too out-of-breath.)

Here's what I found:

1. Cheryl led the five-minute warm-up. These exercises must be universal because I did most of them with Jane Fonda back in the day. (Note: It is really fun to see Maksim going through these simple, slow routines as opposed to his lightning quick moves on the floor. He looks just like a normal guy in an aerobics class. Funny. Cheryl looks good.)

2. Chery led the first workout, ""Merengue."" Her teaching style is simple and direct, yet encouraging. When she shows the next step, she has the class continue to do the preceding movement, then adds the new. Because this is a cardio workout, there is no stopping to show in detail what she is doing. That is the purpose of the rewind button. Better yet, do these routines in front of a mirror or sideways to your television screen so that you can better process what is next. I found facing the screen made me do double processing: seeing, translating to the other side of my body, then doing. Standing sideways eliminates the translating step.

3. Cha-Cha is a 10-minute dance workout with Maksim. Surprise of surprises! Maksim is a patient teacher. Following his directions was a bit easier than following Cheryl. Each instructor, however, keeps viewers part of the team through focused directions. ""Keep your hands at waist level."" ""Keep your core tightened."" ""Focus on breathing. Don't hold your breath.""
And so on.

The Samba (Cheryl) and Mambo (Maksim) both follow the routine established in the first two dance workouts. What I learned throughout was how many of the steps I recognized from the competition. The viewer actually learns all the basic steps to the four dances, even including turns.

The final workout is ""Dancer's Toning Workout,"" which Max says all ""students"" must go through before beginning rehearsal. It ""improves strength and flexibility...to develop and maintain a toned dancer's body"" (liner note).

Overall, I recommend this cardio workout. It is a fun (?), instructional, beneficial way to increase your heart rate and learn all the steps to four dances. As I am pretty much out of shape (for a short while longer), I find the workout vigorous. I have already ordered the 2007 workout with Maksim, Kym, and Ashly teaching the Cha-Cha, Samba, Paso Doble (my favorite), and Jive&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dancing-With-the-Stars-Cardio-Dance/dp/B000MMMTC8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dancing With the Stars - Cardio Dance</a>

3496440,2,B001BNFR80,"I'm a bit dance challenged and was hoping this would not only give me exercise but would teach.  It was hard for me to follow for some reason.  Anyhow, even if it's b/c I've got two left feet, they were not enthusiastic and it was even awkward at times...it felt very hurried and boring for them.  I'm giving this two stars b/c of my left feet (my problem) and b/c I did like the very last segment.  Still, I'm quite disappointed that these pros couldn't do better for something  the non-pros will be doing at home.  :(",1226275200,,519,4.298969072164948

3496442,4,B001BNFR80,This is good exercise and stretching but I am curious as to why Cheryl and female dancers are wearing heels and sexy outfits during the dances [they don't in stretching]; I certainly don't exercise that way :-),1225324800,,210,4.702702702702703
3496443,3,B001BNFR80,"When I watch Dancing with the Stars on TV, I admire how quickly the celebrities learn the steps and sometimes multiple dances in a week.  I didn't think learning the samba or mambo would be so challenging.  I didn't find the instructors really knew how to lead an exercize video.  You don't get enough warning when it comes to the steps and it is hard to be motivated by their voices because they are reading off of cards or something.

I also didn't find this to be a great cardio workout.  It was fun but I'm kind of disappointed I bought it.",1225324800,4,544,4.294117647058823

3496445,5,B001BNFR80,"I found this to be easy to follow, it is dancing, they do show you the moves, and your core DOES get a fantastic workout!  Even doing only the warm up, one dance section, and the additional dancers workout at the end got my heart pumping and I was sweating up a storm!  I love the fact that you can customize your working out by choosing which segments you want to do and it will play them seamlessly without you having to stop and push buttons!

Now for those with no musicality or rhythm, it may be harder for you to pick up and follow.  I suggest just focusing on one segment until you master it.  Watch the segment through a couple of times first then follow along and anytime it gets too complicated or you haven't mastered that step yet, just return to the basic step and keep trying till you get it.

And...you can take the steps you learn in this video, get with a partner and actually do them out on a dance floor!  So, if you bought this video thinking you'll be able to apply what you learn on the dance floor, you can, but if you aren't a strong dancer and don't pick up choreography quick, try taking lessons from an instructor and use this video for practice.",1223769600,118,1173,4.233183856502242

It may not be as fun as the other video, but they help you really learn the right way to do the steps, rather than just doing them. If you dance everyday, then you probably won't get much out of it, but if you're just looking for a fun way to get some exercise, it's a good video. Plus, any excuse to look at Maksim is worth it! :)",1223424000,17,484,3.7549019607843137

She looked VERY uninterested in the whole thing. Cheryl seemed to stumble quite a bit in her talking, and I thought Max was better, probably due to being in the other video.

Cheryl and Max are not very good with their instructions. They both lack enthusiam about this work out. It's almost as if they were going through the motions because their locked into a contract or something!  Especailly Cheryl! The Samba is the worst work out of all! At one point she goes entirely too fast like she's out on the dance floor with a partner and not instructing others! They both should have watched some other professional work out videos and learned how to instruct a dance class!,1223164800,13,629,4.422413793103448
