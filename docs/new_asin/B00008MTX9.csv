1853004,1,B00008MTX9,I love the Care Bears BUT... I hate Animae!!!  (I call it Japanimae.) The Care Bears and other Characters are talking but their voice doesn't look right or sound right.  It says it was made in the USA but it sure doesn't look like it. My kids watched it once and have never asked to watch it again.  They love to watch The Care Bears Movie.,1050278400,,340,4.121212121212121

7985560,3,B00008MTX9,I bought this so long ago I don't even remember much about it.  Your rating system is much easier to use.  I didn't rate before because it kept kicking it back so just gave us.,1408147200,,176,4.0

7985563,5,B00008MTX9,"I was 14 when the Care Bears came out. These episodes from the original TV series are exactly how I remember them - trite, sentimental and badly animated (think Thundercats). I bought this DVD for my son, who was 3 at the time, and he was absolutely glued to them. This DVD and the Bedtime stories DVD are definitely the better buy when compared to the newer 3-episode DVDs (Tenderheart Tales & Land of Enchantment, and overlap significantly (only one different episode on the 3-episode DVDs).",1130457600,,493,4.744186046511628
7985564,1,B00008MTX9,"This movie was a big let down to me.
As a giant fan of the Carebears, I had bought the original 2 Carebears movies, as well as some of the VHS tapes that come with the stuffed animals not too long ago.
Seeing this dvd in the store, I was thrilled to find another Carebear movie and of course bought it right away, along with the Bedtime Story dvd.
They were both a horrible disappointment to me though, and if I could I would have taken them back and gotten my money back! It didn't match up at all to the original Carebears movies and show, and several of the voices were quite awful! Nothing at all compared to the originals!
Original Carebears fans will not like this dvd at all.
My advice.... do not waste your money on any of the 3 dvd's in this set!",1072569600,6,755,4.142857142857143
7985565,5,B00008MTX9,"This is a great video and should be considered by every parent to watch. Kids will love this fascinating tale that will keep them on the tips of their seats throughout the whole video. There is a moral to the story, so it is education and fun all at once. This video is not only entertainment, but educational too!",1055721600,,314,4.338983050847458
7985566,3,B00008MTX9,"All this DVD features shows from the DIC era of the Care Bears. The animation wasn't that great while the stories were decent.
Episodes include:
The Last Laugh, The Show Must Go On, Mayor for a Day, Soap Box Derby, The Girl Who Cried Wolf, Forest of Misfortune and Concrete Rain.
Note: Loyal Heart Dog is featured more in these episodes than the later episodes. In fact he doesn't even speak in the later ones.
Please note that some of these WERE released on video in a limited released. I think it was the same company that released some of the Muppet Babies long lost videos from 1984-1987. When Nelvana took over the series and released videos, everyone forgot about these.
I'm going to wait on the Nelvana episodes to come before buying this DVD.",1050883200,10,750,4.562962962962963
7985567,4,B00008MTX9,When I bought this video I had no idea how great it would be. It has the original cartoons and I practically remembered every episode. It is over an hour of authentic care bear. If you are a care bear lover you will fall in love with this movie,1050451200,3,244,4.0
