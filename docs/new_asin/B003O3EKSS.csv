8401387,1,B003O3EKSS,I have no idea what possessed this director to make a documentary about his boring family!  Only his family could maybe derive some enjoyment from his memories.  It's like being invited to a party and being treated as an outsider.  You won't understand any of the jokes because you're not an insider.  You're not even introduced to the characters.  I don't understand what the point was from beginning to end.,1441584000,,409,4.785714285714286

8401390,5,B003O3EKSS,"I was able to see this movie at SXSW this year, and I'm grateful that I had that privilege.

I really enjoy being able to look into a stranger's life and just learn random tidbits that would otherwise remain unknown. Being able to see the life of Suzette Gondry was very interesting. The film seemed like a personal movie that Michel made just for him and his family, but it was neat being able to watch this film and feel as if you're being welcomed into their lives--if even just a small part.

After learning about all the ups and downs of her life and watching the impact she has had on many people, I felt as if Suzette had been a part of my life.",1277078400,8,652,4.166666666666667
